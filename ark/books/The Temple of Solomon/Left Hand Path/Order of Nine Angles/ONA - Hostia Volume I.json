The MSS contain further details of the sinister tradition of that Order and compliment the information about it already available in the books 'Naos', 'The Black Book of Satan' and 'The Deofel Quartet' as well as that published in the journal 'Fenrir'. The aim of· publishing these MSS is to make the rituals and methods of this sinister tradition available to all those who might be interested. Such publication, as will be evident, enables individual potential to be fulfilled, aiding the emergence of a new Aeon. ,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Tradition of the Sinister Way The essence of genuine Satanism can be simply stated: it is a way to inner development, the goal of which is a new individual. This way involves three essential stages and these exemplify the spirit of that way and the individuals who follow it. The first is direct experience, the second is direct practice and the third self-development. The first involves direct experience of both the external 'world' and the inner (or psychic) 'world' through striving to achieve certain goals both practical and magickal. The second involves using 'practical' (or causal) and 'magickal' (or acausal) energies to manipulate others, situations and energies in a practical way -producing changes in accord with certain goals. The third involves beginning the process again but starting from the new level of self-understanding and ability attained -persuing different {and probably more complex)goals . A Satanist is an individual explorer -following in the footsteps of others (and perhaps using their gUide books) but always seeking further horizons, daring to defy convention (in ideas as well as in morals and attitude) yet part of an evolutionary succession enabling what is experienced to be understood and become beneficial. For this reason, a genuine Satanist understands tradition as important and necessary -the culmination of centuries of insight and experience, a useful gUide which enables further progress and exploration: a starting point for that inner and outer journey which is begun by Initiation, as well as a map of the way chosen and followed. This tradition is not sacrosanct -but it does possess a validity until the individual reaches the stage where the unique genius within each individual has been brought to fruition enabling the creation (from experience and self-insight) of a unique way and a fulfilling of a unique Destiny. In magickal terms, this is the stage of Internal Adept, where that unique Destiny is made known (dis-covered) and where the individual Initiate has developed the talents necessary to fulfil it by a following of the previous stages - a stage reached from between three to five years after Initiation. The tradition (explicated in the 'seven-fold sinister way') provides only a beginning -it is for the individual to go beyond it, toward the dangers and rewards of the Abyss. It is, however, necessary -since it is, in one sense, a 'short-cut': enabling self-development to be achieved far qUicker than would be the case without it as well as fully enabling the explication of individual potential. This does not mean that following it is easy -the path may be shorter, but it is just as dangerous (and in some places, more so). It is a mountain path to the summit rather than a meandering valley path, and enables the horizon, the other mountains waiting to be conquered, to be seen -as they cannot be seen from the wooded valleys below. But each new Initiate must walk this path -alone. And for each it is a new experience, a process of direct learning and a personal achievement, for only a very few have ever ventured that way before and stood atop the summit that is 'Internal Adept' to see in the distance the still higher peaks that wait beyond the Abyss. What is important is following that path -and going beyond it, toward the Abyss -actually undertaking the journey and experiencing in real time what is encountered and seen: of being takne to the very limits of your endurence and abilities. No one can do this for you -just as the path does not lead to some pleasant grove where you sit at the feet of some 'Master' listening to their past experiences and fables. It does not involve you staying comfortably 'at home' with the security of your known world and friends and ideas, just as it is not a 'mental' journey done in comfortable surroundings and with no physical effort or danger. It 1S practical, and direct -and involves physical and psychic hardship, and while you may be a little soft when you start, you will not be so when you succeed, Just as if you believe you are tough enough now, you will be rudely awakened. Is this what you really want? O.N.A."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"-• • • • • • -. The Seven-Fold Sinister Way: A Comprehensive Guide Aim: ----Essentially three fold: a) Initiation; b) magickal Adeptship; c) fulfillment of individual wyrd and potential. Stages: 1) Neophyte; 2) Initiate;3)External Adept; 4) Internal Adept; 5) Master of Temple/Mistress of Earth; 6) Magus/Magistra;7)Immortal Note: Initiates are sometimes known as 'Novices', Neophytes as 'Oblates'. External Adepts as 'Professed Brother/Sister'; Internal Adepts as Priest and Priestess; a Magus as 'Grand Master'. Neophtye: Tasks: Study of Esoteric tradition as given in Order MSS -particuarly Black Book, Naos, Azoth and 'Fenrir'. After this preliminary study (c.l month) undertake ritual of Self-Initiation [Black Book] and construct simple form of the Star Game [Naos]. Initiate: Tasks: Study septenary system in detail[Naos etc.] and begin workings with the spheres and the pathways. Study and use of Tarot. Undertake hermetic workings/rituals for specific desires/personal requests. Continue with study and use of Star Game -relating the abstract symbolism to the Tree of Wyrd, septenary etc. Set a demanding physical goal[e.g. running 20 miles in 2! hours or less or cycling 100 miles in less than 5! hours or walking 32 miles in less than 7 hours: it must be one of these] train and achieve it. Seek and find a companion and Initiate this individual [Black Book] and then undertake the workings with the spheres and pathways with this person. Begin to tl~ach this individual the Star Game. and use the game together. Undertake the Grade Ritual of External Adept. *The first stage is the awakening of the darker/unconscious aspects within the psyche. These aspects/energies are identified with in the rite of Initiation and then symbolised in the workings with the spheres and pathways following Initiation. These workings give practical expereince of the darker forces/energies. The Star Game begins the process of objectifying these energies in a more conscious way: giving greater insight and control. and this is the beginning of self-awareness since the Tree of Wyrd is symbolic of individual consciousness. both unconscious/ acausal ('sinister') and causal. as well as representing the forces/ energies beyond the individual psyche. The setting of a physical goal. by the Initiate, and the training to achieve it. is important because it enhances the vitality and developes personal qualities important to the magickian: determination, elan and so on. This task must be undertaken, for without it, the Initiate stage is not complete. The seeking. finding and working with a companion begins the confrontation with the 'anima/animus' energies/archetypes resulting in practical experience of them as well as enabling the use of sexual magickal formulae [qv Rite .of Nine Angles etc.]. This is a very important part of developing self-awareness, and the 'ritualized' setting enables both practical experience and the possibility of developing self-insight. (This 'ritualized' setting is first the workings with the spheres and pathways, use of Star Game, and then later the organization"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"of a Temple [see below].) External Adept: Tasks: Organize a magickal group/Temple for the performance of ceremonial rituals as given in the Black Book -the Ext. Adept as the 'Master'/ Mistress of this Temple, the companion as the 'MIstress/'Master'. It is the task of the new External Adept to find suitable members, Initiate them and so on. Regular sunedrions should be held [Black Book, for details. The Ext. Adept is called a 'Choregos' while running the Temple.]. After the group has been run for c. 3-6 months, the Ext. Adept should set another but more demanding physical goal, train and achieve it. [For example, running a marathon in less than 3 hrs (men) or 3hrs 30 (women); cycling 100 miles in less than 5 hrs (4:45 if really determined) or wal~ing 50 miles in 13 hrs.] After running the Temple for between 6-12 months, choose a Priest and Priestess from the group to run the Temple while the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept is being undertaken. °Notes: The titles assumed by the Ext. Adept, the companion and those appointed 'by the Ext. Adept to positions within the Temple such as Priest and Priestess, are purely honourary, and do not signify the achievement of the magickal grade associated with that title in the 'Seven Fold Way'. It is one of the tasks of the Ext. Adept ('Choregos') in running the Temple to appoint suitable members to fulfil the positions required by rituals (e.g. Priest, Altar-Priest, Thurifer and so on). It is up to the Choregos whether to inform members that the Temple is organized as part of the tasks/training of an Ext. Adept in the sinister path. If the Choregos decides to do so inform the members of this, then those members, should the Choregos so wish, may also begin to follow the tasks of the Seven Fold Way as above: the Choregos always keeping a step or two (in terms of Grades) ahead of them. No one can be appointed to the Grades themselves: not even by a Grand Master -the Grades must be achieved by each and every individual, the only exception being Initiation. Initiation may be given, according to the ceremonial ritual [Black Book] by anyone of the grade of External Adept and above who organizes a Temple, provided that the Initiate completes the initiate tasks as above. The final task of an External Adept is to prepare for and undertake the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept. *The tasks of an External Adeptdevelope both magickal and personal skills. The organizing and running of a Temple brings further magickal.' experience as well as enables several archetypal roles to be lived, this living vitalizing (partly through the energy of the archetypes) the individual, enabling greater magick. One of the roles is that of the 'shadow' -the sinister magickian adept at ritual. The personal qualities developed include manipulation, the charisma of power and sexual/material pleasures. There is also a growing self-awareness, and understanding of archetypal energies as well as the further confrontations with the anima/animus. There may also be glimmerings of the unique wyrd of the individual - a wyrd revealed through the ritual of Internal Adept."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"---Internal Adept: Tasks: Depending on the wyrd of the individual, either continue with and expand the Temple (training Initiates in the Seven Fold Way and so on) or begin the personal tasks revealed by the Grade Ritual.

Study of Advanced Star Game and esoteric, aeonic aspects of both forms of the game['cliology' etc.]. Preparation for and undertaking of Nine Angles rituals: 'natural' and/or 'chthonic' according to desire. Further training of companion up to and including Grade Ritual of Internal Adept, if required.

This is above and beyond the tasks mentioned in the various gUides to the 'seven-fold Way', which gUides were intended for publication and thus did not contain the secret tasks. These secret tasks are outlined in the MSS 'The Secret Tasks of the Sinister Way.' One of these tasks, undertaken by an Initiate, is an \"Insight Role\". An Insight Role is in effect an extended magickal ritual and involves the indiVidual living in a certain way and striving for a specific (often non­esoteric) goal. It involves playing a specific 'role'. The novice is expected to learn from this experience. It is important that the novice identifies with the role to the extent that friends/associates and those the novice is brought into contact with by virtue of that role do not realize the novice is playing a 'role'. For the duration of the Insight Role, the task of that role should be the main interest/occupation of the novice. Insight Roles, as a technique, have been used by Satanic novices for at least a century, and this technique has as its primary aim the gaining of self-insight by the novice using the technique. The technique also developes certain skills -some magickal, some involving the gaining of Satanic judgement and insight. Expressed simply, Insight Roles develope Satanic character. Until qUite recently, Insight Roles were wide-ranging and also exceptionally difficult to undertake -the novice was expected to undertake a role which was the opposite of what they considered their own character to be. [qv. the now deleted Order MS 'Insight Roles' I &II.J The technique, however, has been recently revised by the Grand Master representing traditional groups. In this revised form, it is an extremely effective noviciate technique, although (like all genuine esoteric techniques of Satanic magick) it is still difficult to undertake and still requires a genuine Satanic commitment from the novice. Like the Sinister Way itself, it is not for the dilettantes or the imitation 'Satanists' who merely wish to play at being Black Magickians. One essential aspect of an Insight Role is that it requires the novice to change their life-style and usually their place of residence. Another, is that it tends to isolate them from non-Satanists. Third, it often brings them into conflict and confrontation -with others, and themselves. Fourth, it tests them -forcing them to find inner strengtils and reserves. Or, of course, it destroys them -or makes them renounce their Satanic quest and vows. All these are necessary. All Insight Roles are demanding; some are physically dangerous. All force the novice to make choices-to learn. All, when successfully undertaken, build self-confidence and thus character. All, in brief, express Satanism in action. The novice is expected to make his/her own choice from the roles outlined below. It must be undertood that: (a) only the roles listed below are actually Insight Roles, so the choice must of one of them; (b) the completion of at least one of these roles is necessary before the Internal Adept rite can be undertaken. It is usual for the novice to undertake an Insight Role follOWing Initiation and after the completion of the tasks outlined in the MS 'The Seven Fold Way ­A Comprehensive Guide' (i.e. after completion of the tasks associated with the stage of Initiation and before undertaking the rite of External Adept). However, if the novice Wishes, an Insight Role can be undertaken when he/she is an External Adept and has completed all the tasks of an External Adept (such as running a Satanic Temple for a certain period of time). Generally, it is adVisable for the novice to undertake a role before External Adept. Further, should the novice so desire, two Insight Roles can be undertaken, one after the other. This is an interesting experience -but requires a demonic commitment."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"During some of the roles, the novice should try and keep their Satanic views and beliefs secret, and become in fact a shape-changer, a chameleon. The Roles:-o Either by foot or by bicycle or by accepting lifts, travel alone around the world, taking between six months to one year (or more). You must live frugally, and carry with you most of what you need. You should travel to as many countries as possible, the more remote the better and expect sometimes to find work to enable you to travel further. o Become a professional burglar, targetting only victims who have revealed themselves to be suitable (e.g. by testing them -qv. the Order MSS dealing with victims etc.). The aim is to speCialize in a particular area -e.g. Fine Art, jewellery -and become an 'expert' in that area and in the techniques needed to gain items. o Undertake the role-of extreme political actiVist and so champion heretical views (by, e.g. becoming involved in extreme Right-Wing activism). The aim is to express fanaticism in action and ~e seen by all 'right-thinking people' as an extremist, and a dangerous one. o Join the Police Force (assuming you meet the reqUirements) and so experience life at 'the sharp end' and being a servant of a higher authority. * All roles should last for at least six months and all must be completed (i.e. you leave them) before the end of eighteen months. All the roles will by their very nature test your Satanic Views and beliefs and thus your desire to continue along the sinister way. All will expose you to difficulties. Once the choice is made, it is up to you to find means of undertaking the role -e.g. in the case of joining the Police, finding reasons why which will •\t convince a selection panel; in the case of becoming a burglar, finding someone to buy your stolen items and so on. The essence of these Insight Roles can be succinctly stated: Incipit Vitriol. ONA 1989\t ev • Note: In times of actual War, an alternative InSight Role is to join one of the Armed Forces and so gain combat experience."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Secret Tasks of the Sinister Way The Order MS \"The Seven Fold Sinister Way - A Comprehensive Guide\" details the tasks and so on which an individual following the sinister path must undertake in order to reach Adeptship and beyond. That 'Guide', however, is exoteric. There are, in addition, esoteric tasks to be undertaken. These tasks have remained secret by virtue of their nature -they represent genuine Satanism in action and as such often are 'a-moral'. Such esoteric tasks are revealed following a Satanic Initiation. Further, to understand these tasks, it is necessary for the Initiate to be familiar with, and in agreement with, the secret teachings explicated in the various esoteric MSS -for example, 'The Hard Reality of Satanism', 'Satanism, Sacrifice &Crime', 'Culling - A Guide to Sacrifice', 'Guidelines for the Testing of Opfers', 'Victims - a Sinister Expose', 'The Practice of Evil in Context'. For a long time, the matters mentioned in these secret MSS were transmitted only on an oral basis it being forbidden for the teachings and practices so transmitted to be written down or divulged to non-Initiates. However, as explained elsewhere, this has now changed. Accordingly, this MS will detail the secret tasks which a Satanic novice must undertake as part of their commitment to Satanism. That is, these tasks -and the others detailed in the MS 'The Seven Fold Sinister Way - A Comprehensive Guide' -are both required and necessary: without them, there can be no genuine advancement along the way, for such tasks develope that character and those abilities which are Satanic and which thus represent the presencing of the dark forces on Earth via the agency (or vehicle) of the Satanist. As has been stated many times, genuine Satanism requires commitment -it requires self-effort, by the Initiate, over a period of years. It involves ordeals, the achievement of difficult goals, the participation in pleasures and the living of life in certain ways. Only thus are self-insight and genuine Occult abilities born -only thus is an Adept created. Neophyte: Before Initiation and after undertaking the tasks of a Neophyte as given in the 'Guide' MS:(a) find an area where game is plentiful and, equipping yourself with either a cross-bow or an ordinary bow (such as a longbow) hunt/stalk some suitable game and make a kill. Skin and prepare this game yourself (if necessary 'hanging' the game until it is ready) and (when ready) cook and eat it. \"Game\" in this context means [for the U.K.] venison, hare, rabbit, partridge, pheasant, Wildfowl and so on. In effect, you are assuming the 'role' of hunter. (b) obtain, from a Nazarene place of worship, some 'hosts'. If you are seeking Initiation into an established group, this will be your test of fidelity (etc.) and the hosts will be used in the celebration of the Black Mass. If you are undertaking a self-Initiation (as for example given in The Black Book of Satan) then immediately following this rite you should trample on or otherwise defile these 'hosts' (e.g. by urinating on them) saying \"By this deed I pledge myself to counter Nazarene filth and give myself, body, blood and soul, to Satan, Prince of Darkness.\" You should then burn the hosts or what remains of them by placing them in a vessel containing flammable liquid and setting this aligh~, laughing While the burning seals your gesture and your oath. Initiate: After the rite or ceremony of Initiation and following completion of the tasks as given in the 'Guide' MS, you should choose and undertake, for between six to eighteen months, an 'Insight Role'. [See the MS 'Insight Roles - A Guide'.]"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"External Adept: (a) With the Temple (formed as one of the tasks of an External Adept -see the 'Guide') perform a Black Mass with hosts obtained by a neophyte of the Temple wishing Initiation. (b) Train several members, and yourself. in the undertaking of tests relevant to choosing an opfer. Select some sUitable victims. using the general gUidelines for so selecting, and undertake the relevant tests. The victim or victims having been chosen, perform The Death Ritual with the intent of eliminating by magickal means the chosen victim(s). Thereafter, and having completed all the necessary preparations, select a further victim using Aeonics or sinister strategy as a gUide and undertake a culling either during a sUitable rite (e.g. the Ceremony of Recalling) or via practical means. You may elect to do this latter yourself, or you may nominate a trusted, sUitable member in good standing to undertake this for the glory of the Temple, using a method of your own devising. At the same time. perform a Death Ritual. It must be stressed -(i) the victims must be chosen according to Satanic principles as given in the various Order MSS; (ii) those chosen must be tested according to Satanic principles as given in the relevent MSS; (iii) the acts or acts of culling may arise from your own implemenation of Satanic strategy and tactics or from one of the members of your Temple who is fulfilling Satanic wyrd by some role or Satanic act, that member having elected to follow the sinister path in a committed way.

They are Satanic. As such, they are fitting only to a minority. Some who profess to be Satanists (and who may be seeking a Satanic Initiation in an established Order)will read them, or hear of them, and be surprised, perhaps even appalled. 'They are not necessary' they or some others will say, fearing to really begin following the reality of the Left Handed Path as marked out by those tasks. But Satanism and the Left Handed Path are as they are -dark, dangerous, difficult and full of diabolic ecstasies. So it is, so it has been and so shall it be -to enable evolution while the fearful majorities in their sloth and delusions continue their morbid existence. ONA"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Sellins Water:By Ohe :Riyer Question: What is Satanism? Answer: Satanism is £undamentally a way o£ living - a practical philosophy o£ li£e. The essence o£ this way is the belie£ that we all as individuals can achieve £ar more than we realize during our li£etime. Most people waste the opportunities that li£e can, does and Can be made to bring. We are gods when we awake. Q:How do you then understand magick? A: Magick is essentially the opening up o£ areas o£ consciousness latent within all -a means o£ changing the individua~ and the world. The techniques o£ magick (£or example, rituals) are simply means to achieve this. For too long magick has been mis-understood as 'spells, conjurations' and the like,and while such things are magick, they are only a beginning, a mere intimation o£ what real magick is all about. Q:You o£ten use the term 'traditional Satanism'. What does this mean? A: Traditional Satanism is a term used to describe the sinister path which £or centuries was taught on an individual basis £rom Master{or Mistress) to pupil. To this path belongs the Septenary System, Esoteric Chant, the comprehensive training o£ novices (including the development o£ the physical side), the Star Game, and ­most importantly -the Internal system o£ magick (the Grade Rituals etc.). This path is also known as the Seven-Fold \\-Iay. Q: I've heard o£ La Veyand his 'Satanic Bible'. How does the Seven-Fold Way di££er £rom his Satanism and those who £ollow his views? A: La Vey took what may be described as the popular/media conception o£ Satanism -the black-robed, Mephistophelean £igure -together with the 'pleasure principle' and some simple magic{k), mixed it with the qabala and various historical myths and legends pertaining to the dark side, and served the whole lot up to a gullible audience. The whole thing was pretty pathetic -although it did provide some with a £ew thrills. There was no substance to either La Vey or his 'Church': no inner path, direction or way. Nothing original. The Seven-Fold Way, on the contrary, possesses direction, and goes £ar beyond the external type of magick implicit in both the 'pleasure principle' and ordinary sorcery. tt offers the individual the di£ficult (and sometimes dangerous) path to genuine Adeptship -to sel£-mastery, self-excellence and ultimately wisdom. It is not a refuge £or the neurotic, the weak-willed or the sel£-deluded, but rather a challenge to the daring. Those who follow in the foot-steps o£ La Vey (as a recent 'Temple' does) have added little -they are still trapped by 'role-playing', still fettered by sel£-delusion (often about their magickal abilities) and still lack not only sel£-insight but also that spontaneity which is one of the marks of a genuine Adept. They concern themselves still with the awarding of meaningless titles, seek members"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"• and the recognition of the 'authorities'. They teach the same historical mish-mash as La Vey and possess an originality quota of zero. They have failed to understand that the ceremonial, ritualistic and 'theoretical' approach is but the first_ small step toward inner progress.Because of this, there can be no organized 'Temple', no 'authority' within it, no pros~lytizing and no awarding of grades/initiation or titles. There is only -in the genuine path - a limited amount of guidance, and the struggle of the individual through experience. Q: But surely rituals are important -e.g. the Black Mass? A: Yes -but only in the beginning stages of the Way when the novice/initiate is discovering the hidden (or magickal) forces of nature and themselves, and is daring to walk along the' path to Adepthood. Ceremonial and hermetic rituals are the province of the novice and the 'External Adept' and are pointers to what is beyond. Q: Which is what? A: First, the discovery of the unique Destiny of that individual I second the living of that Destiny, and third, for those whose Destiny becomes fulfilled by such living, the crossing of the Abyss. From the Abyss the Master and Mistress is born. All this takes many years. Q: What then is the purpose of your Order? A: To offer our teachings and guidance to those who might be interested. In former times, teachings were kept secret, but there is no need for that now: the opportunity is open to all. Q: But are you not still secretive? A: Yes and no. Those who seek hard enough will find us, and those who are sincere will not be put off by the obstacles placed in their way (sometimes by us). For those who are, there are plenty of other groups around. Q: What about Initiations? A: We do not offer Initiation -candidates achieve Initiation. We do not offer nor award (for money or anything else)Grade Rituals or titles of any kind: these are again achieved by individuals, through their own toil, hardships, terror and joy. We simply guide them toward the self-achievement that, e.g., the Grade Rituals represent. Any other way is simply fraud and self­deception. Grade Rituals -which signify the different stages of achievement along the Seven-Fold Way -may be likened to running in a race. You either race, or don't; and if you race, you either win (achieve the goal) or do not. You may pretend to yourself that you have raced and run, but in the end you are fooling only yourself. \\ Q: What, then, are the Grade Rituals1 A: They are tasks, simple in form, but difficult to complete successfully. For example, the Grade Ritual of I~ternal Adept simply involves the candidate in living totally alone and isolated for at least three months: without any of our modern 'conveniences'/technology, and without speaking to anyone. Simple to describe -difficult to undertake. The 'ritual' is the (alchemical) change which occurs in the individual by virtue of living so for at"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":", J , least three months. Such primative isolation creates the Adept, bringing a genuine mastery of magick and a lasting self-insight. It is the intention of the Order to publish all the Grade Rituals in the next issue of 'Fenrir'. Q: Returning now to the popular conception of Satanism, what about sacrifices, the blackmailing of members, sexual crimes and so on? A: Satanism is all about -in its beginnings -making conscious (or liberating) our dark or shadow nature. In the past, certain experiences were often undergone in order to achieve this, and some of those experiences were often frowned on by 'conventional' society. Some might have been 'illegal' at the time as well. But gradually (at least in traditional Satanism) a way was found to 'short-circuit' these evolutionary experiences which enhanced the consciousness and thus wisdom of those undergoing them -if they survived, of course. Thus was Internal Magick evolved. This enabled the experiecing of the dark side,and its integration, as well as made possible what was beyond. This system had been gradually refined and enhanced, and while it avoids the quicksand of criminality it is still not lacking in danger or difficulty. It offers, in short, the distilled essence of thousands of years of evolutionary understanding -and makes possible the next stage of our evolution as a species: Homo Galactica. Q: You stress the development of the physical side. Why? A: Because traditional Satanism aims to develop the whole individual -mind, body and character. We give our novices difficult physical goals to achieve (such as running 20 miles in under 2t hours -fitter individuals are naturally given more difficult tasks) because the striving for such goals, and their achievement, develops qualities necessary in any Adept. They are tests of determination and character, and sort the serious out from the pathetic. The striving also creates a physical joy, increasing the vitality of the person. Q: I met someone recently who claimed to be a 'Master'. I had my doubts about him. Is there some way of identifying a genuine Master? A: The answer should be obvious. A Master is someone who has passed beyond the Abyss, the stage beyond an Adept. In consequence he will be somewhat detached: intense and serious, but also natural, spontaneous and quite cheerful (almost playful, sometimes). But perhaps most of all, he will not tnke himself too seriously, and he will certainly not playa 'role' or fulfil the expectations of novices (e.g. by dressing up, cultivating a 'demonic' stare and answering questions mysteriously). He will possess that illusive quality -natural charisma. Q: What about wealth -and power? Surely all Satanic Masters possess these? A: Some do, some do not. The sign of a Master is neither wealth nor power, but achievement -of wisdom, skill in esoteric arts, and original creation (e.g. the extending of human knowledge, artistic creativity). The Destiny of each ~laster is different, as is the life-style which reflects that Destiny. For example, out of the four Masters who exist in the West at this moment in time, one lives"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"a somewhat isolated existence with hardly any material possessions, while another lives in relative luxury and splendour. The former concerns himself primarily with aeonic magick, while the latter teaches a few pupils. Genuine Masters do not conform to someone else's expectations or ideas: they are individual, and unique. Q: Do you worship a being called Satan? A: Genuine Satanists do not worship anything -not even themselves. Fundamental to Satanism is a desire to overcome, to accept challenges and to seek to know and understand. A genuine Satanist would rather die -laughing and defiant -than submit to anyone or anything. Most people waste their lives and die old and miserable: the Satanist revels in life and adventure, and knows the right time to die, for challenges never end. This way of living is hard, and this way of dying breeds fear among the feeble multitude who prefer comfort and security to the ecstasy of living on the edge like gods. As to Satan -each Initiate discovers the reality for themselves. All that need be said is that there ~ external forces beyond the psyche of an individual: in genuine Satanist magick there is identity with these darker external forces, not a fear of them and certainly not a submission. This, of course, is somewhat dangerous -but the strong survive, and the weak perish. Good riddance to the weak. Q: So, fundamentally, you would say that Satanism is the way you live your life? A:Yes,as I indi~ated at the beginning. Magick -of whatever type -enhances your life, and is a way to knowledge and increased vitality. Magickal acts are important in the beginning, but most important of all is our attitude to life and our ways of living. This is why we despise the Nazarene philosophy -the Satanist is proud, strong, defiant, while a Nazarene is afraid of living, afraid of dying and mentally sick: weighed down by guilt and envy. The meek espouse peace because they know the strong would destroy them -so they infect the strong with the disease of 'pacifism', with guilt because they are strong ••• Q: But surely that pnrticular philosophy -of, as you call it, the 'Nazarene' -is dying out today. A: As an organized religion it might be -but over the past two hundred or so years this poisonous philosophy has sprouted various political and psuedo-political forms, and it is these forms which are eroding our vitality. There have been a few attempts to cut out the cancer -but they have unfortunately failed, and the cancer grows and spreads. Q: What, then, can you do? A: Why should we do anything? Most people are stupid and deserve their fate. We offer an alternative -those who have if only in a small way the Promethean spirit will be drawn to us and thus have the opportunity to master their own Destiny. It is up to each and every individual: we can point the way, but they must make the effort to walk along it."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"J ] J .\" • .5;,,;~ SJ..-A..... ~.t:c.1t:.. ' Satanism is dark, and Satanists revel in evil. As a word, evil is regarded as deriving from the Gothic (via Old English) \"ubils\" implying 'beyond' and 'going beyond due limits'. Later, the word -like so many others -was re~interpreted 'morally', in the abstract terms of Nazarene fundamentalism and 'evil' became a general term, applied to one's opponents and those excesses which timid and psychically ailing Nazarenes feared. Genuine Satanists do evil, they cultivate evil: they are evil, in all senses of the term now accepted. Imitation Satanists, however, play mental and intellectual games: they enjoy the 'thrill' of calling themselves Satanists. Some go further, and may revel in a local notoriety, finding a vicarious pleasure in being known as a 'Satanist'. But these imposters do no evil -in fact, they explain (quite often) that Satanism has been misunderstood and is really rather a \"moral religion\" (or something of the kind), perhaps even an 'ethical knowleqge'. Such people are pathetic ­and certainly not Satanists. In the beginning, a genuine Satanist will cultivate evil on the personal level -by going to and thus finding his or her limits. This involves more than just going beyond the (accepted) limits imposed by society or whatever. It means experience, on the practical level, of evil and all that it implies. Later, when the Satanic novice has some experience and thus self-understanding and mastery, there is impersonal evil. The first is s~nister shadow magick of the external and internal kind. The second is sinister shadow magick of the aeonic type -the manipulation, changing, of individuals and events on a not insignificant scale, that is, one which produces tangible results and often disruption/creation/evolution and thus continues the sinister dialectic of history. This is called 'shadow magick' not only because it is mostly secretly done, but also because it is dangerous,psychically and physically, involving as it does acts of defiance against the restrictions imposed by all other forms and individuals . Neither of these mean a type of juvenile \"rebellion\" nor purely 'mental' acts (achieved by ritual or anything else). They mean a directed, calculating, purposeful involvement in real life and situations: for the beginner Satanist (the novice) just as much as the Adept. What differs, is the aim ­at first, it is personal, to aid self-mastery, understanding and thus build Satanic character; then, it is impersonal or aeonic. Thus one image of the genuine Satanist -someone in control, seeking more mastery of life; seeking more challenges and goals and insights. Let me be explicit so I cannot be mis-understood. 1) The Satanic novice will aspire -to what is beyond, in all things. This means practiCal experience, testing Destiny and achieving difficult goals in the personal life. It means real danger in the real world, not cheap manufactured 'thrills' of self-induced stupour and loss of control -but rather, life and liberty threatning situations. These may be and often are amoral, illegal and evil -all laws are \" fundamentally an accumulation of tireles attempts to stop creative individuals making life into instants of poetry\". Naturally, some guidance may be needed -it is easy to become lost, directionaless, or caught -and this is where the advice of a more experienced Satanic Adept may be useful. However, the acts of a Satanist are not random nor mot~veless and neither do they arise from any weakness of character nor uncontrolled desire. Instead, they arise from fulfilling Satanic wyrd -or, viewed another way, from presencing the energies of 'darkness'/Satan on the Earth in accord with sinister intent."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I I --• • '1 • • An example will explicate this. A Satanic novice, having developed to a certain extent via ordeals such as Grade Rituals, the achievement of personal, physical goals and the organizing and running of a Satanic Temple, desires to go further. For this, practical experience and some guidance is needed. Let us assume the novice is advised or chooses to use a political form to achieve this experience -and thus becomes involved with radical 'right-wing' politics because such people already possess an element or two of Satanic spirit, the 'other sides' in this form and at this moment in the history of this aeon representing the Nazarene disease in another gUise. Thus, she takes part in direct political actions -this is both exciting and dangerous, given the prevailing sickness of this age. Gradually, she acquires practical experience \"on the edge\", and hopefully some real, tangible enemies, if she is performing right. These enemies probably hate her for her political views -and some of them may even try to harm her personally. Thus, one or more of them deserve to die -or at least come to some harm, psychically if not physically. For they not only threaten her own Destiny and thus achievemen~, but also Satanic wyrd, because she by her actions is fulfilling higher, Satanic goals (in simple terms, presencing the darker forces via a tangible form). This fulfilling is expressed in the form she is guided toward or chooses for herself via a knowledge of Aeonics. On the practical level, she can and should undertake magickal rites (such as the Death Ritual) to aid her -but other means can be used, such as assassination. She may wish to do this herself, ,or she may manipulate others into doing it. The result is the same -personal experience and development, and aeonic energies presenced via the execution of the act. Thus is her own evolution, and that of the acausal or sinister, furthered. Given the nature of the form chosen, this Satanic novice, by using such a form to the utmost of her ability (that is, seeing it as fulfilling a part of her own Destiny -conventionally, \"believing in the correctness of the views so espoused\") goes beyond the norms of society and its herd majority and thus achieves personal knowledge of the illegal and the forbidden (in that society). 2) Beyond this, when Adeptship is attained by experiences such as the foregoing, the Satanist will try and open a nexion -to directly access acausal energies on Earth via rites such as Nine Angles etc. This is the beginning of aeonic shadow magick -and this involves an even greater commitment to change than before, on the practical level. What form or forms this takes depends on individual wyrd. dis-covered by the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept and prepared for by previous rites, and experiences. It may be political, as it may be the use/manipulation of archetypal forms/ images with sinister intent -or involve using 'religion' as a Satanic instrument of change. Whatever the form, the changes are supra-personal ­they effect more than a few individuals. In fact, they radically disrupt existing forms and norms. For example, a political form may be chosen and used. After some time, violence, riots somewhere, the spread of a new idea ... The rising of a type of State in essence inspired with sinister energies and thus contributing to aeonic evolution ... Perhaps a war. to propitiate with blood the darker forces '\" Thus. it will be understood that Satanists act in a directed way. whether they are novices. or Adepts.

I .-l .J J DIABOLIC ETYMOLOGY Diabolic: The word 'diabolic' itself derives from the Greek oLa~a>..>..w meaning to \"pass beyond\" or \"over\", from the root oLa -\"through\" and, as a causal accusative, \"with the aid of\". Later, OLa~a>..>..w acquired a more moral sense for example 'to set against' (Aristotle) although it was sometimes used (as oLa~o>..oc;;) when a 'bad' or 'false' sense was meant, as for example, a false accusation. Later still,OLa~o>..oc;; became \"devil\" or \"The Devil\" in the sense of Nazarene theology. Devil: . The early forms of the English word 'devil' are regarded as deriving from the Gothic (e.g. the Old English divull 'diabaulus' which came from the Latin 'diabolus'. However, the Old English 'deofol' and kindred words like the Old Frisian 'diovel' could possibly be derived from the suffix 'fel', a variant of 'fell' meaning fierce, savage, wild. Then the original form, e.g., deofel, would mean the 'fierce/ savage/wild' god. There is some justitification for the use of the Latin prefix in this manner -e.g. 'deodand', which occurs in 12th Century English. It is interesting in this context that 'fell' (from the Latin 'fello' )was often used to describe both a wild, fierce person (such as an outlaw) and a brave man or warrior. Much later, the word passed into general usuage as 'felon' -with a moral sense. Satan: This is often regarded as from the Hebrew, meaning accuser. However, the Hebrew is itself derived from the Greek aL.La ­\"an accusation\" -qv. Aeschylus: aL.Lav txw The Greek form became corrupted to the Hebrew 'Satan' -whence also 'Shaitan'. In Greek of the classical period aL.La and oLa~o>\"D were often used for the same thing, particuarly when a 'bad' or 'false' sense was required. It is not generally known, outside of certain academic circles, that Hebrew is Greek [a Jewish scholar once wrote a book with that title; it did not please his brethren] -that Hebrew is essentially in its origins a corrupt form of Greek, with some other influences thrown in. Ev i 1: The word 'evil' derives from the Gothic 'ubils' which meant a 'going beyond' (the due measure) -and did not have a 'moral' sense.

Externa1 Magick This is resu1ts magick or sorcery. and it is the magick of the Initiate and Externa1 Adept. It itse1f exists in two forms: ceremonia1 and hermetic. Ceremonia1 is ritua1 magick -ceremonies and rites where more than two individua1s are invo1ved. Ceremonia1 magick can be done for basica11y two reasons: to create/ draw down and then direct magicka1 energy for a specific aim (e.g. cursing). or to represent through words and symbo1ism the myths/know1edge of a particu1ar tradition or cu1tus. Sometimes. however. the energy generatedJ by a symbo1ic rite can be directed to a specific end -as in the B1ack Mass. Hermetic ritua1s usua11y invo1ve one or two individua1s ('sex magick' is usua11y hermetic) and are genera11y done extempore. They require those undertaking them to possess or be capab1e of deve10ping during the ritua1. an empathy with the forces/energies emp1oyed. as we11 as possessing the necessary desire to direct the forces/energies. In contradistinction. ceremonia1 ritua1s are usua11y written down and when performed a set text is fo11owed. with on1y minor variations to a110w for the emotion of the moment. Interna1 Magick This is when magicka1 techniques (e.g. Grade Ritua1s) are used to a1ter the consciousness of an individua1. The rites of interna1 magick 'open the gates' between the causa1 and the acausa1. and change the perception from 'ego' consciousness to the 'se1f' and what is beyond. In the Jungian sense. interna1 magick produces 'individuation'. and 1eads to Adepthood. The main rites of interna1 magick are the hermetic workings associated with the spheres and pathways of the septenary Tree of Wyrd. and the Grade Ritua1 of Interna1 Adept which invo1ves the individua1 1iving in iso1ation for at 1east three months. It is one of the main functions of estab1ished Orders and Temp1es to prepare their members for interna1 magick and offer guidance a10ng the way. Aeonic Magick This is the magick of the Master. the Mistress of Earth and the Magus. and its basis is an understanding of those forces which inf1uence 1arge numbers of peop1e over 10ng periods of time. On one 1eve1, aeonic magick is the a1teration/distortion of such forces; on another, it is the 'creation' of new energies and their dispersion over the Earth to change conscious evo1ution. In one sense. this is the 'b1ackest' magick of a11."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"I ..J J ~ I J ] ] J ..., 1 -] ] J .. • 1 .i Satanism, as a way of magick, has no seasonal rites, no servitude or submission to any diety and no fear. There are thus in Satanic rites no defensive circles or measures of any kind: only an exultation in the forces of the rite, a prideful possession and mastery. Rituals are often done at the time of the full moon because it helps one to see when the ritual is done outdoors and because it gives atmosphere to the rite. Sometimes, rites are conducted on or around the seasonal changes -solstice and equinox -because there is magickal energy present then (due to Earth's changes) and this energy can be harnessed. The same applies to planetary workings -the rising and setting of planets (astronomically calculated for the horizon of the observer -and not using the frandulent 'planetary' tables given in most books) • Such planetary energies exist -but are generally small, and have little effect on rituals done correctly. Most Occultists delude themselves about the nature and extent of these energies (this is particuarly true of the Moon) ­to become sensitive to them is difficult in our shielded, technological society. Generally, only Adepts ( and the naturally gifted) possess the required empathy. However, this said, the full moon is rightly associated with 'lunacy' and 'demonic' possession -as anyone who has worked nights at Mental Hospita~ will testify. This power can also be harnessed during a ritual. Celebratory rites in traditional Satanism are of two kinds -1) those that express the energies of Satanism -e.g. the Black Mass, Ceremony of Recalling -and whose performance thus distorts the currents of the Nazarenes and the Old Aeon; and 2) those which create new energies appropriate to the Satanic age of fire to come -e.g. invokations to the 'Dark Gods'. The Black 1-1ass is still celebrated simply because the Nazarenes ( and their allies) are still powerful and still polluting us with their filth. It is still the main ceremonial rite performed on a regular basis by organized Temples, and -like all ceremonial rituals ­its performance gives identity to the Temple, strengthening the magickal and personal ties of the members as well as furthering the work of the Prince of Darkness because it is a rite of Black Magick. The mysteries of the Nine Angles form an important aspect of genuine Black Magick. On the physical level, the nine represent energy Vibrations -for according to tradition, a crystal shaped like a tetrahedron responds to voice vibration of the correct pitch and intensity. In simple terms, the crystal amplifies the power of thought and produces magickal change. Quartz gives the best results, although spinel may be used. The tetrahedron shape has to be created from the natural material by a skilled operator. On another level, the nine symbolize (that is, re-present) the progression of Aeons and thus the Aeonic energies. The representation is that of the nine combinations of the three alchemical substances (9(9) e(~) ec~) etc.) over the seven fundamental levels, these levels being the spheres of the septenary 'Tree of Wyrd'. The Star"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"J ] l J I I ~ -] ] •lI• Game is a physical representation of these symbols the seven boards are the spheres, and the pieces are the alchemical variations. (It should be noted that the nine main variations spread over the seven spheres also represent an individual -their consciousness, life and wyrd.) Thus the magick or 'sorcery' of the Star Game ­an imitation (magickally done) of an Aeon or individual whose change (the moves of the Star Game) is manipulated by the magickian (the 'player' of the Game). The Star Game has two sets of twenty-seven pieces -one set white, the other black, representing the two aspects of cosmic Change (or the causal and acausal). These pieces are spread over the seven boards. The Nine Angles also symbolize the seven plus two gates (or spheres) that join our causal universe with the acausal (or 'magickal') universe. The seven are the spheres of the Tree of Wyrd (zones of magickal energy), and the other two are the Abyss -where the causal and acausal meet in temporary stasis -and the acausal itself, which is beyond even the Tree. The Abyss, in the septenary system, lies between the spheres of Sun and Mars, and its crossing is the ordeal of the Adept and the genesis of the Master/Mistress of Earth. It signifies the beginning of acausal perception. The other important form of Black Magick is to do with self-survival after death. This can be done in two ways, depending on the aim of the operator. The first is transference of the essence of self-hood, near the moment of physical death, into another physical body, ensuring thus the continuation of existence on the physical level. The second in passing the acausal Gate -creating an existence entirely in the acausal dimensions. The first involves finding a suitable body to inhabit; the second has some resemblance to the creation of the 'diamond body' in some of the esoteric schools of Taoism and it is this form which is generally undertaken by the Adept. The first is sometimes done as a temporary measure or if the wyrd of the individual compels completion of some task on the physical. The process of the first involves the creation of a strong 'astral self' -via chant and visualization and strengthened through acts of magick over a period of time, sometimes using a crystal tetrahedron to ensure the right amount of magickal energy. Thus an 'astral double' is created -and this energy is most usually stored in a crystal until the time for transfer. Meanwhile, a donor should have been found - a good, healthy specimen. The psyche of this donor is then infiltrated through both astral and physical contact. The actual transfer occurs during a ritual with both donor and operator present (the former may be hypnotized or drugged or otherwise enticed) ­consciousness being transferred to the 'double' which then ousts the weakened psyche of the donor. The second form is actually the next stage of conscious evolution -and the goal of the Adept."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"II .. ] • , What it is important to realize about traditional Satanism is what is meant by 'Satan'. Traditional Satanists regard Satan as not simply a symbol of self consciousness, but rather as a representative of those supra-personal forces beyond the individual psyche. To see 'Satan' as simply a self symbol -as two recent 'satanic' groups do -is, firstly, to be self-deluded about the nature of cosmic forces, and second, to make (or attempt to make) Black ~1agick tame and safe. To deal with greater forces is to court danger -psychologically and physically. Traditional Satanists see this danger as a means: the strong survive and the weak perish; this simply being a reflection of genuine Satanist philosophy rather than the tame view spewed forth by the imitation and toy 'satanists' who abound today. Satan _ in traditional Satanism -is never represented pictorially, and apprehension of the physical or causal manifestation of our Prince is an experience that each Satanic novice achieves for themselves by undertaking rites of Black Magick according to the dark tradition. This apprehension mayor may not change when the new Master or Mistress of Earth is born via the ordeal of the Abyss, and it is up to each and every Adept to undergo this experience since the reality cannot be taught -only experienced in the primal Chaos that is the Abyss. What pictorial representations that are used, are those of the forms sometimes chosen by the Shape-Changer himself, for the Prince of Darkness·must have his fun with feeble mortals. It is important to realize also that the name 'Satan' is not His real name -it is a convenient epithet, used because it expresses part of His nature. There is, in fact, no real 'name' as we understand names -only perhaps a sound vibration (which cannot really be written down) which summons Him to our consciousn~ss and our world. In a sense which few people will understand, Satan is the essence of the acausal: the cosmic force of Chaos whose intrusion into our causal dimensions disrupts the entropy that linear time produces. Our species requires and has required symbols to enable apprehension and evolution -and this is true also of the Initiate (and to a lessor extent of the Adept) who belong to that lower order. The Abyss destroys -or creates a new species, a new 'mind' capable of funotioning on levels not normally accessible to those of the lower order. And the most potent symbol of certain cosmic forces has been, and still is, Satan. In reality, Satan (who has a secret or 'genuine' name known to all Initiates) concerns Himself generally only with Aeonic magick -the changing of this world. Through Him, the Masters and Nistresses work Internal l-1ap;ick, and through their Orders, Initiates undertake rites of External Magick, to the glory of Ilis name."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"... ... .... .. J i .J ] ] Satanic Influence - A Modern Tale It is a fact -seldom fully understood and appreciated -that most individuals follow the creative lead of a few. It is also true that some of this majority absorb the creativity of others and bring it forth again, sometimes slightly altered, to claim it as their own -and that this whole majority needs the stimulas of new forms, ideas and ways, born via a creative genius or two, to vitalize them and begin the process of inter,,;,: and external change . The recent history of Satanism gives evidence for this. Various types of Satanism have emerged over the centuries, as have various exponents of it. Historically, Satanism is often taken to be -by those unacquainted with the Left Handed Path -as Diabolism, that is, the invokation of the Devil and the making of a pact with Him. This is evidenced in the medieval Grimoires and in those who were accused of such things. Later, various individuals were regarded as 'Satanic' and as teaching a form of Satanism, the most familiar being A. Crowley, Esq. Still later, various organizations emerged, each claiming to be Satanic and each teaching what they called was authentic Satanism. The most significant of these are the Church of Satan (Anton LaVey), the Temple of Set (Michael Aquino) and the Order of Nine Angles (ONA). Diabolism: Central to all forms, is fear -of the powers, entities invoked. Hence the use of various forms of protection such as 'circles'. The \"pact\" so familiar from the Grimoires and accounts of Diabolism was one between a Master (The Devil) and a servant (the sorcerer). Implicit in all forms of Grimoire-type Satanism is the belief (deriving from Nazarene religion) of Satan as a fallen angel ruled over, ultimately, by \"God\" -there is always the possibility of being 'saved'. The archetypal Diabolist was a lapsed or practising Nazarene whose conjurations brought excitement and a sense of the 'forbidden'. Crowleyism: While 'Thelema' as a doctrine and belief is regarded by many non-Occultists as \"Satanic\", there is very little real Satanism in it or indeed in Crolwey's own life and works. The work of crowley is, in many ways, a continuation of the Eastern-influenced esoteric groups and societies active before and during his own time - a type of Westernized Tantra heavily imbued with qabalism. The archetypal follower of Crowley is someone versed in Occult doctrines and mysticism who seeks through sex and other rites certain states of consciousness and who is orientated toward a belief in 'Thelema' as a new faith/creed. Church of Satan: The church achieved a high media-profile due to the showmanship of LaVey. He expounded a philosophy of unenlightened egotism and self-interest together with a belief in carnality. The rituals were in the tradition of the Grimoires and imbued with qabalistic symbolism/notions (including some deriving from Crowley). Further, the Devil was dispensed with as an external Power -making the LaVey type of Satanism more of a practical belief system than a dangerous (in Occult terms) undertaking. Temple of Set: The Temple was and is an essentially intellectual development of the Church of Satan. To the original was added an intellectual infrastructure (deriving in part from various mythologies and traditions) and an organizational"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"--l .. .., ... 1 .. .. • 1 structure with the aim of making Satanism a new 'religion' acceptable to a significant number of individuals. Both the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set (the latter more so than the former) insist upon belief in their own version of Satanism -and expect the adherent/member to accept/conform. There is thus a fostering of dependance by the individual upon the group (and in particular the leader(s) and Master). Order of Nine Angles: The Order first emerged to public view in the early 1980's (eh) and basically taught that Satanism was a means to attain self and Occult insight and abilities, and that this could only be done on an individual basis via direct, personal, experience. The archetypal Church of Satan member was a black-robed figure who played a \"role\" and who placed ego-fulfilment and pleasure before everything. laVey was accepted as a 'Master' and an auhtority to be revered -and a personality cult Qeveloped. The archetypal Temple of Set member is someone who has read a lot of Occult literature, who engages in discussions with others about their beliefs and practices, and who likes the charisma and appeal of being a 'Satanist'. Often, they dress for the part -and need a group identity, a sense of \"belonging\". They also accept Temple authority and are content to let an organization confer advancement upon them (in the form of titles and positions). The archetypal ONA member is the lone sorcerer/sorceress struggling via practical (and sometimes dark) experiences toward self-attainment, gUided by the teachings of the Order and by an occassional meeting with someone who has gone that way before . Each of the above manifestations will be considered in turn. But what, then, is Satanism? By what criteria can such manifestations be judged? First, let us consider what Satanism is not. It is not an acceptance of conventional morality or ways of living; it is not a belief, or faith, which causes a rejection of the reality (and harshness) of life; it is not a refuge for the failures, the cowards and the weak ... Satanism is about pride, an acceptance of individual worth. It is about defiance ­challenging the accepted, seeking to know the unknown and seeking the discover, to explore and to conquer: a refusal or bow down or givu in . It is about excellence -of going beyond what is, in personal terms; of achieving a greater awareness and understanding than the majority. It is a desire to experience the limits of living, to strive for the gods The Diabolist is insipid and rather pathetic, a historical curiosity only - a footnote in the psycho-pathology of the Nazarene religion. Crowley was a rather underdeveloped egotist who lacked the character to develope real self-insight~ He could and did manipulate others, and did possess some Occult powers (intuitively) and some understanding of the Art of magick. His followers are trapped by the flaws of his system -chief among which are a belief-system (in 'Thelema') and methods which encourage self-stupifaction and self-satisfaction (and thus the illusion of development) rather than real self-insight and thus Occult abilities. Church of Satan members{and to a lesser extend those of the Temple of Set) accept a sanitized Satanism - a \"safe Satanism\" where the Darkness is said to be only within, where it cannot threaten them. They also are stuck on the bottom rung of Occult understanding -seeing nothing beyond the ego and the carnal. The Temple of Set claims to go further, but there is little or no practical experience of evil, of the Sinister, of those Dark forces which are part of the cosmos -there is instead an intellectualizing. There is also no going to extremes, in living, no ordeals which challenge(and make) character. No quest for personal excellence.

In brief, a fostering of a type of mental servitude -in belief and in practice. All these are contrary to what Satanism is. Only the ONA understands and practices Satanism as it is, with its insistence that Satanism is about individual self-development in both the real and the Occult worlds, and that this can only be achieved by hard, long, dangerous and ~oilsome experience. Further, the ONA has exhibited a creativity and an understanding which makes all other manifestations pale into insignificance. Thus, it is not surprising that it has been so influencial in the past few years. This influence has, however, seldom been acknowledged -other groups and individuals often borrowing the teachings, methods and ideas and claiming them as their own, this 'borrowing' not being confined to \"Satanic\" or Left Hand Path groups in general. This is both natural, and necessary ­given the sterility of creativity which exists and has existed in such groups, and given the nature of the human species in general, and the Satanic in particular. The chief contributions of the ONA toward an understanding of Satanism in particular and the Occult in general may be briefly described: 1) Satanism and the LHP as a means to individual development leading to Adeptship and beyond -via practical experience and ordeals (qv. the Grade Rituals); 2) the emphasis on developing both the mental and physical character of the individual; 3) a greater understanding of magickal (and Occult) forces -and thus their nature -via the development of the concepts of causal and acausal, and an abstract system to represent this, enabling conscious apprehension (as against belief and superstition); 3) the re-structing of magickal forms and symbols in archetypal terms ­in particular the septenary Tree of Wyrd and the Deofel Quartet (the later explicating the archetypal, particularly in the 'real world' from the viewpoint of the sinister novice); 4) the creation of a Sinister Tarot whose images ~ sinister and thus imbued with Satanic energy; 5) the emphasis on the individual Initiate working alone and achieving practical goals -without accepting in a religious way a higher authority -and making this achievable by all via the publication of practical gUides to all aspects of Satanism (Naos, Black Book etc.); 6) revealing and significantly extending Aeonic Magick -enabling any individual to undertake such works; 7) bringing an awareness of the Dark Gods -of the sinister energies/forces which exist and which are supra-personal and thus dangerous to individuals, one aspect of which has been symbolized by \"Satan\"/.. the Devil ... ;8)an emphasis on the personal qualities -the character ­of a Satanist, enshrined in the concepts of excellence, honour and the mottto \"die, rather than submit to anyone or anything\"; 9) are-affirmation .. of the positive, life-enhancing nature of Satanism as against the stereotyped image of obsession with death and decay -and a moving away from the \"role\"/image of the Satanist as showman-type 'Devil'/Mephisto figure obsessed with carnality and pandering to his/her own weaknesses, and seeking media-attention, toward the secretly working lone sorcerer/ sorceress concerned with their own development and works of esoteric sinister magick .,. A perusal of literature, statements and other such causal forms by other groups and individuals since the manifestation of the ONA will show the extent of its influence -of how, in a subtle way, such individuals and groups have been changed by a sinister organization.

In short, there has been less real self-discipline and more ego-biased stupidity and stimulation. Adeptship, and the wisdom that lies beyond that, is obtained by a slow, hard process which requires self-discipline and the self-overcoming of hardships.

This is in complete contrast to what happens outside of genuine esoteric traditions where there is adherence by the individual to abstract doctrines, ideas and beliefs -that is, there is little or no understanding based on experience, on the reality apprehended through trials, hardship, explorations and discovery. ~agick returns the individual to their inner core -destroying illusion, affectation and abstraction of the arid intellectual type. Of course, one should really say -real magick, properly used, does this. There is an awful lot of pretentious 'magic' and 'magick' about. '\\/hat differentiates real magick is first the practical nature of its methods (which are both 'internal' ­ie. psychic -and 'external' -ie. involving practical work and experiences in the real world, not just \"in the head\")and second its structure or system: a working toward a definite goal. This goal is Adeptship (part of which may be said to be the ~ungian 'individuation) and what lies beyond even this: wisdom. The striving for this goal (an:: the striving is necessary: it is not a 'gift' from someone) changes the individual in significant ways -there is a re-orientation of consciousness, insights and aChievement. The way of magiclt (as explicated by the seven-fold way) enables each individual Initiate to develope their Olm unique understanding or 'view of life' or 'world-view' -that is, it creates character, it uplifts the individual, seperating them from the anonymous majority who mostly merely exist rather than live and who nev evolve and understand. Today, individuals are 'mass-produced' ­and conform to the accepted ideas and norms, even in the 'rebellion' that occurs, where the 'herd' or some fashionable 'trend' or 'idea' is followed without any understanding. Everything is categorized, made into moral opposites -and there is developing in society an almost religious zeal about certain attitudes, a zeal which restricts individual freedom and expression and which destroys genuine individuality. All this, however, goes mostly unnoticed, so low is the level of general insi~ht - a situation brou~ht about, in part, by the comfortable lives most people in the ::est today live; insulated as they are by technolo~y, by material possessions, by the com,]exity of Modern life and by ideas from life in its realness, rawness and danger. That it is n~cessary to give an example to illustrate the categorization and zeal which is increasingly occuring is a sad reflection on the general level of understanding.

(aNA 1990 ev)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"l l • Manipulation I -Sinister Themes It is a fact of external sinister magick that manipulation is necessary. There is manipulation of forms, images and magickal energies as well as direct and indirect manipulation of people. People manipulation can arise from many factors and be undertaken for many reasons. Initially, it is often done by Initiates because they wish or desire to revel in the feeling that such manipulation can and often does bring - a sense of power and re-inforcing of the ego: it creates a sense of self-identity and purpose, enhancing the \"role\" of Satanist/Black Magickian. Beyond thi$ is the use by the External Adept of various roles -such as Priest or Priestess -which by their nature involve certain amounts of manipulation of others, e.g. in the running of a Temple or group. Experience brings skill - a learning from mistakes, and thus a more subtle approach. Instead of direct confrontation, there is a \"flowing with\" the other persons(s) and then a skillful re-direction of them: i.e. they believe they are acting freely rather than being manipulated. Beyond External Adept, there may be further use of such skills depending on the wyrd of the Adept. [See Appendix for one such form.] What all levels have in common is the acceptance of the belief that the magickal Initiate is superior to the non-Initiate: that others can be used to achieve personal/magickal goals. In the beginning, of course, this sense of superiority may be unfounded and mis-placed -arising from simple arrogence and self-delusion. However, if the Initiate truely learns, and really follows the hard path of internal magick, then this will be transformed into a reality, the External Adept having acquired the skill and begun the process of developing character: that which sets them apart from ordinary mortals. In addition, certain abilities will be developed (some connected with the 'Occult') and latent potential drawn forth -creating a new individual from the pre-Initiate one. The post-Initiate will realize the rather limited understanding of the majority and see them as swayed by all kinds of external and unconscious influences: in short, understand that they are not really free. They will be seen as directed and controlled in varying ways by various means -by archetypal forces within their own psyche, directly or indirectly by others and by ideas/forms/Institutions/ideology, as well as by the various patterns psychic energies assume (one of which is the ethos of the culture/civilization to which they belong). To the sinister Initiate this will be illuminating and also useful, providing opportunities for experimentation and self-learning, as for example via running a Temple. There is no morality here -only the judgement of experience: most people are consciously and esoterically not very well developed. In fact, they are still rather primative. The Initiate takes a dispassionate view -although there will be times when direct involvement leads to emotional commitment/ involvement, and thence to a self-learning from the experience(s), as must be in the progress from Initiate toward the other Grades. Initially, however, others are seen as a means. Gradually, there is a move away from this -from the direct, personal involvement to the more indirect and magickal: an internalizing. This brings awareness of the Initiate's own psyche and thus real understanding. There may be and mostly still is manipUlation of others -but this has evolved from the random to the directed, centred on what the Initiate believes is his or her own destiny in magickal terms. The same applies to the manipulation of magickal energies -there is an evolution away from the undirected external type (which quite often arose from the unconscious -i.e. was not consciously understood) first to the internal as a process of internal magick, and then outward again but in a directed form, the direction arising from the magickal goals set, those involved in following the sinister path. In brief, there"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"is an awareness of that balance which is so important for true Adeptship. This balance -for an External Adept -is expressed in the understanding, from experience [i.e. not \"from book-learning\"], that magick as a directed form is not always causal when used to assist the individual externally (and sometimes internally) -that is, it involves other factors which the individu\\.L at the time of working/ritual, may not be aware of/in control of. In short -the illusion of having achieved control/mastery of all magickal forms by techniques, is broken. One of the factors involved in this is the wyrd of the individual; another is the wyrd of the Aeon; another -and perhaps the most important for the individual to understand -is the nature of magick itself: no one who has not transcended beyond the Abyss can direct/control in a causal way all the divergent forms any magickal energy assumes in the causal. Quite often, however, most of the divergences go un-noticed when \"practical magick\" is performed, because the time-scale of those divergences is not the same as that of the effects which are or become noticed by the Initiate/External Adept and which mostly are taken to be the \"success/failure\" of the working. Some of the divergences are or may be in themseives of no consequence to the individual undertaking the working -i.e. produce no discernable outward effects -and even when they or some of them are of consequence, the Initiate/External Adept usually either ignores them or accounts for them in other, temporal, ways. A recognition of/sensitivity to the divergences begins the process that leads from External to Internal Adept: once again, practical experience is the teacher. it should be obvious that those which are of consequence (whether noticed or not) effect these acausal changes upon the individual due to (a) the wyrd of that individual and/or (b) the wyrd of the aeon. Thus the learning curve which magickal workings impart. In a sense, each Grade Ritual and the associated experiences, imparts more ability to apprehend and thus control the causal manifestations -gives more skill at manipulation, both magickal and of people (there is a stage when the two are understood as the same thing), as well as brings an awareness of the acausal effects beyond the time-scale of the working and its desire/results. The understanding of the limits (well, some of them!) often occurs following the solo Nine Angles rite by an External Adept -at first intUitively, and then more consciously. This begins the process of consolidation and leads either to further self-insight, return to self-delusion, or rejection of magick and the quest. For, in essence, the solo rite is a foretaste of the chaos of the Abyss -undirected acausal energy, the effects of which (i.e. what results from its presencing in the causal[\"on earth\"] ) are mostly unforseen and often unwanted, the ritual itself being so structured (or rather unstructed) that little or no direction is given for the energies -they flow and presence according to their nature, the individual being a channel. [Note: this is what happens to a greater or lesser extent in external workings by an Initiate/External Adept re the 'acausal component' of the working.] Thus, the wyrd of the individual to some extent directs and/or disrupts the flow, producing certain changes in the causal. The nature of these changes thus depends on that wYrd. Thus the essence of magick -and hence sinister manipulation -is glimpsed and then apprehended, in most for the first time. This enables both the causal and acausal components of the energies accessed via a magickal working to be controlled and manipulated and thus presenced in the causal, and it is this which marks the true Adept: the Internal Adept possesses the understanding, and the Master/Mistress can make that understanding real. *** 1990 ev .. ­, 1­"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"-1• Manipulation II One of the fundamental principles of Black Magick is elitism:the belief that the majority are essentially beneath Initiates in terms of understanding, intelligence and ability. This gives the foundation for manipulation ­both on the personal and the magickal level. The Black Magick novice is generally scornful of others -until and unless worth has been proved or shown. However, as explained previously (Manipulation I) an experienced novice will have learnt the subtlety of manipulation: direct confrontation as a mode of manipulation will seldom be used(unless a person or group deserves to be so treated: or such an an approach is magickally necessary). Instead, there will be the \"flowing with\" approach -manipulation without the person or persons being aware of it. Quite often, this approach is \"psychological\"; at other times it may be psychic (e.g. directly magickal) -or perhaps via the charisma of the magickian overpowering the personality of the person(s) in question. Whatever, there will be an arrogence based on the belief of one's own superiority -and thus an isolation. For a true Black Magickian is essentially a strong individualist who finds his or her own company preferable to that of others -unless those others can be useful in some way. That is, there is no dependance of any kind, particuarly not emotional, on any other individual or individuals. This, of course, is what the novice strives to achieve. It cannot be achieved qUickly -or even by \"will\" alone. Rather, it is a cumulative process -an alchemical change, a re-orientation of personality, and such changes take time. In the seven-fold sinister way, these changes occur during the stage of External Adept and are a necessary prelude to the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept. One of most important aspects of this change is that involving the companion -the initial emotional involvement gradually changing, ceasing to be a dependance but rather a partnership, a mutually evolved understanding; the passion (both sexual and emotional) which possessed the novice giving way to a maturity. The arrogence of the Black Magickian is not an empty one: it is not a posturing. Instead, it arises from within: from the knowledge and insight the novice has gained into him/her self -by having achieved in both the personal and magickal sense. Thus the magickal and practical goals which are set for novices -they d~velope self-assurence, a pride and that arrogence which is truely Satanic. The training for and achievement of these practical goal~ usually takes the novice to the limits of physical and mental endurence ­and this builds character in a specific way [or defeats the novice who gives up and either lets self-delusion triumph -\"I don't need such things: they are out of date/unsuited to me; I have achieved enough anyway ... ­or abandons the magickal quest, perhaps later to try another \"method\" (which is easier) or find another \"teacher\"). Initially, this arrogence is outward and expressed by manner. attitude and perhaps appearence. Later, when Adeptship becomes achieved, it becomes cloaked -except in the eyes and in that charisma which marks a Black Magickian. Initial manipulation is often of the external kind -an adjunt to external magick -later, it becomes \"internal\" (concerned with the internal goals of the External Adept) and still later, aeonic (bound up with supra-personal, acausal energies). [qv. Deofel Quartet for examples of the various types appropriate to Initiate and External Adepts.) ONA 1990 ev"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Ritual Magick -Cure and Sedue Ceremonial-Magick enables us to capture again and again those moments which not only shape our lives but which can extend the possibilities of our existence: those moments when we know with an exhileration and an insight that transcends words, when we become more than a single isolated individual burdened with a causal-existence. For some time there has been a denial of and attempts to undermine the ceremonial in magick: there has arisen a plethora of self-written rituals and \"chaos\" type workings. This, however, arises from a misunderstanding of the nature of ceremonial. Basically, there are two types of ceremonial workings in magick: dure ceremonial, and sedue ceremonial. The first is essentially ritual used for internal magick -to produce/provoke/inspire changes within the consciousness of those participating/attending. The second is (or r~ther should be) a performance which transports the individual participants to another realm and which engages their whole being. It is not however a possession -but rather a developed awareness, a new way of being distinct from \"everyday\" existence, one in which all the elements (mind, body, emotions etc.) are a unity. A sedue ceremonial is an artistic event of the highest type because it is a conscious attempt to make the acausal real (to presence it) in causal time. However, like any artistic performance, a ritual can be good, indifferent, bad or great depending on the talent and abilities of those performing/conducting it. If it is any of the first three, it will not achieve its purpose. A great performance is one which captures the essence of the ritual -which brings the acausal, which \"opens a nexion\", and which thus has the magickal power to transform. This of course is a rare event -at least these days -and like, for example, a great performance of a drama or a symphony, requires both talent and preparation. Unfortunately, in the past as in the present, ceremonial rituals when attempted are done mostly by inept performers with little or no preparation and little if any empathy with the magick which the ritual re-presents. Thus the ritual is magickally ineffective: non-inspirational for the participants/congregation. Further, elements of self-delusion (regarding the \"magick\") are mostly present. Such \"performances\" tend to confirm the mistaken belief that ceremonial forms are either boring or outmoded or both. A ceremonial ritual should be vivifying -and awaken \"numinous\" feelings. It should stimulate all the senses -for a sedue ritual in a subtle way; for dure ritual in an obvious/overt way. Incenses and fragrences should stimulate the sense of smell; the eyes should be stimulated by colour and imagery; hearing by the sounds of chanting, by music, words; the intellect by the symbols/content/intent; the passions by the spirit or elan of the performance and perhaps the sight/gestures of an individual or individuals performing a specific \"role\", their manner of dress (or undress) and their physical movement. A ceremonial ritual is a seduction -of the participants/congregation by he/she/they conducting it or the power of the rite itself because the rite captures or transforms an aspect or aspects of the acausal. This seduction is subtle if the ritual is a sedue one, and obVious/overt/harsh if it is a dure one. But by its nature it always has a temporal structure as it always is a nexion to the acausal -if it is a genuine magickal rite, that is, one that possesses when performed acausal (or magickal) energy/power. Both of these aspects -the temporal structure and the nexion -are important, although hitherto esoteric. Each shall be considered in turn. First, temporal structure. This means that the ritual has a beginning, a middle (or 'action'/development) and a definite end: it is confined in temporal time, and while a specific"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"-., .. n I \" .. specific performance may be 'fast' or 'slow' depending on the mood and the intensity, it is generally of a certain duration. Second - a nexion. This means that in form and content (e.g. the techniques used to draw upon magickal energy) it is effective -it accesses the forms/symbols and so on required for its purpose. This means more than that it 'produces emotion'. Emotion arises or should arise from the performance by the effort and talent of the performers. Rather, such accessing means it re-presents certain elements of the acausal in an accessable form, such as archetypes or numinous gymbols. This requires what can only be called a type of 'artistic creation' -and this in itself can be of varying quality, as in music or any creative endevour. Most creations, however, as rituals, are not effective: they do not presence the acausal, although they may produce emotion and perhaps the occassional insight. Emotion, however, is not magick -just as \"intellectual stimulation\" and/or undisciplined behaviour are not, although such things result and are expected to result from what passes for \"magickal rituals\" today. Only rarely does a creation become or be magickal -that is, a nexion, despite the intent of the person or persons who undertake such creation. Thus, no amount of desire, no amount of intellectual knowledge can make or create a ritual which is magickally effective. Only rarely does a creation become or is magickal. It may become so due to the \"aura\" or \"tradition\" surrounding it (partly due to past performances) -but even in this instance it must still possess some aspects which access the acausal directly. It is magickal when it is that rare entity: a genuine magickal creation. The temporal structure and accessing of a ritual mean that a genuine rite, once created or transmitted via tradition, must be respected for what it is: effective performance requires fidelity to the temporal limits and its internal structure -in terms of all its formalized elements such as words, chants, symbols, images, colours etc. Outside of this, there can be (and indeed should be) artistic interpretation, a vivifying of the original by the talent and skill of the performer(s). A genuine magickal ritual is a work of art -and requires 'interpretation', that is, performance, to presence the acausal. it is in short a conscious causal expression of aspects of the acausal -and in performance lives in both the causal and the acausal. Hence its power to transform. [It should be remembered that only ceremonial magick is being considered here -the above does not imply that only ceremonial forms are effective as magick. There are many other forms or means of accessing the acausal.J Given this understanding, it should be obvious that there are very few rituals, written down or transmitted, which presence the acausal and which, in an inspiring performance or interpretation, are capable of transforming either the consciousness of others or of producing changes in the causal metr~c itself. That is, there a few rituals which possess in their written form the potential to be a nexion to the acausal: and even these require inspirational performance: rehearsal, planning, the correct intent or desire ... In short, the creation of \"atmosphere\" and skill/ability in performance. The rituals that proliferate today -and most of those regarded as 'traditional' -may in their performance pass some moments of causal time and may even fill some individuals with emotion (and boredom is an emotion), but they are not and never will be magickal. Of the rituals that do exist, those in 'The Black Book of Satan' together with a few others (such as The Ceremony of Recalling in its various forms) rank as supreme works of magick. Some other rites possess the potential to do even more on the causal level (e.g. the Nine Angles rites) -producing aeonic changes.

The Alchemy of ~1agick Magick is not an object for academic study -it is essentially practical. It also requires self-discipline and training ­the acquisition of skills. Xo books or teacher can teach magick: it can only be learnt by practice, by the trials and errors of eA~erience. All books and teachers can do, at best, is guide: tow~rd and into the rel~ant experiences and offer some explanations for cause, effect and what is beyond the causal. Similarly, wi11ful self-expression will be mostly counter­productive. What is required of the novice and Initiate is self-discipline and that insight which arises from achievement and adversity. Modern life, however, has made these things difficult -it is easy to be self-opinionated, to accept the comforts of.~odern living and the lack of self-discipline, just as modern \"methods\" and \"ideas\" about \"magick\" make it seem that understanding of and achievement in magick is easy: all that is needed are the relevant books/grade manuals/ information and a chaotic mind/attitude/approach. There is not and never has been any substitute for self­learning from experience. The real learning of magick occurs by the individua1 novice, alone: group work and group experience merely confirm that learning and extend the techniques, the forms that are used. This is so because real magick is internal -an alchemy of psychic change. It is the techniques which are external. For instance, sexual ma:;ick is a technique of magick -it is not magick or 'magickal' in itself -just as ceremonial ritual is a technique. All tec!miques are forms which are dormant -they need vivifying, bringing to life: they need to be infused with the 'breath of life'. This vivification is magick, and its achievement is individual, that is, it does not rely on the form -on minute details of performance or technique. Sometimes, this vivific~tion is shared -e.g. between two individuals undcrtal:ing a seALIal rite or a group gathering for a ceremony. For too long the techniques have been rezarded as magickal in themselves, leading to a complete misunderstanding of magick -as, for example, by Crowley and his followers and by adherents of latter-day \"chaos\" techniC}ues. kagick is beyond technique -techniques and for~s merely presence the magick in the causal, and to access the magickal ener~ies sldll is required.

In the past, a few Adepts of the LHP -and the occassional notorious individual interested in dark sorcery -tried to secure for themselves an acausal existence by dark rites of sacrifice, and as a result dark legends arose. But such means are not really necessary. Before describing what is necessary, a brief examination of such acausal existence will be in order. According to a sinister tradition we as individuals possessed of consciousness have both a causal and an acausal aspect to that consciousness. The acausal is latent (or mostly so) and magickal Initiation awakens it -opening a gate or nexion to the acausal. This allows the acausal to be apprehended (usually via a symbolism such as the septenary Tree of Wyrd) and acausal energies to be used/directed (i.e. 'magick'). The result is an 'expansion' of consciousness. Progression by the Initiate to the higher grades of initiation is actually the expansion of the acausal in individual consciousness (or, viewed another way, the progression of the individual into the acausal) - a balance of causal/acausal being achieved in 'the Abyss'. Beyond this, because of the balance so attained, it is possible to transcend to the acausal -to create an acausal existence when the causal ceases (ie. physical death) . The acausal is not however, a \"dreamy realm\" or some kind of nirvana/heaven. It is rather, the very essence of Being -beyond opposites, primal Chaos. Nirvana and such like are abstract moral forms -ie. they are \"unbalanced\" since they lack darkness, the sinister, the negative ..... [Nirvana and such like are usually described in terms only of 'light'.] The acausal is the realm of the Dark Gods -and these beings are not imaginative symbols'.\t for the titillation of consciousness, nor simply a part of the psyche, to be transcended or negated or whatever by 'forces of light'. Rather, they exist independant of our consciousness [yet such is the nature of the acausal that they are also part of what is dormant within us] and while they may be accessed (or 'dis-covered') by consciousness and thus presenced in the causal (on Earth) their actual intrusion would totally disrupt sentient life in the causal -like the meeting of matter and anti-matter. Sinister magick (of the aeonic and internal kind) may be said to be like a machine or engine where containment of opposites is possible and controllable in certain amounts and under certain conditions. [In simple terms, sinister aeonic magick contains the flow of the acausal into a temporal form -usually an Aeon and its associated civilization -via a nexion/ma gickal centre to thus over thousands of years increase the amount of the acausal that is presenced, increasing thus evolution in individuals in accordance with sinister goals.Such is one of the forms of real Black Magick.] The nature of acausal existence may be apprehended by individuals by certain sinister rites such as those of the Nine Angles. To ach~eve an individual acausal existence the sinister path must be followed, from Initiate to Internal Adept to Master/Mistress and beyond because this following of such a path in the way indicated (qv. Naos and Black Book) creates acausal consciousness in the individual over causal time. The Grade Ritual of Grand Master/G. Mistress makes the Adept more acausal than causal. Beyond this, is a simple ritual (the solo Nine Angles rite done by the Grand Master/G.Mistress) when consciousness is transfered beyond the nexion opened/created by the previous Grade Ritual. Immortality -the final stage of the way -is then achieved. followed then or shortly thereafter by causal death, although consciousness can be transfered to inhabit another causal body, thiS is not usually done as wyrd is achieved. Simple, really, although this alchem~cal process takes about 25 years. By virtue of the nexion, the new Immortal alters the temporal structure of the world. usually for an Aeon. Now the secret has been revealed, the possibility is open to all. But it is doubtful if more than one or two a century will try, such is human weakness. •\t DNA 1991 eh"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"i .. • • .. ! Baphomet -A Note on the Name The name Baphomet is regarded by traditional Satanists as meaning 'the Mistress (or Mother) of Blood' -the Mistress who sometimes washes in the blood of her foes and whose hands are thereby stained. [See 'The Ceremony of Recalling'.J The supposed derivation is from the Greek -~a~~ ~~.pa and not as is sometimes said from -~~.~D~ (the Attic form for 'wise' ). Such a use of the term I Mother' /Mistress was quite common in later Greek alchemical writings -for example, Iamblichus in 'De Mysteriis' used ~~.p~~w to signify possessed by the mother of the gods. Later alchemical writings tended to use the prefix to signify a specific type of 'amalgam' (and some take this to be a metaphor for the amalgam of Sol with Luna in the sexual'sense). In the septenary system Baphomet, as Mistress of Earth, is linked to the sixth sphere (Jupiter) and the star Deneb. She is thus in one sense a magickal 'Earth Gate' [qv the Nine Angles] and her reflexion (or 'causal' as against her 'acausal'or sinister nature) is the third sphere (Venus) related to the star Antares. According to esoteric tradition the Antares aspect was celebrated by rites in Albion c, 3,000 years BP -in the middle and toward the end of the month of May and some stones circles/sacred sites were said to be aligned for Antares. In contrast, the sinister aspect of the Mistress (i.e. Baphomet) was celebrated in the Autumn and was linked to the rising of Arcturus, Arcturus itself being related to the sinister male aspect (second sphere of the septenary), later identified with Lucifer/Satan. Thus, the August celebration was a sinister hierosgamos -the union of Baphomet with her spouse (or 'Priest' who took on the role of the sinister male aspect). According to tradtion, the Priest was sacrificed after the sexual union, where the role of Baphomet was assumed by the Priestess/Mistress of the cult. Thus, the May celebration was the (re-)birth of new energies (and the child of the union). Tradition relates this sinister sacred Arcturian rite as taking place once every seventeen years. Once again, some sacred sites in Albion are said to be aligned to the rising of Arcturus, over three thousand years ago. In the Middle Ages, Baphomet came to be regarded as the Bride of Satan ­and it from this time that both 'Baphomet' and 'Satan', as names for the female and male aspect of the dark side came into use (at least in the secret sinister tradition). Hence the traditional depiction of Baphomet -a beautiful mature woman (often shown naked) holding up the severed head of the sacrificed priest (usually shown bearded). To some extent the Templars revived part of this cult, but without any real esoteric understanding and for their own purposes. They adopted Baphomet as a type of female Yeshua but with some bloody/ sinister aspects -and contrary to most accepted ideas, they were not especially 'Satanic'. Rather, they saw themselves as holy warriors and became a military cult with bonds of honour, although their concept of 'holy' differed somewhat from that of the Church of the time, including as it did dark/gnostic aspects. Their sacrifices were in battle -and not as part of a specific rite. The image of Baphomet (e.g. by Levi) as a hermaphrodite figure are romantic confusions and/or distortions: essentially of the symbolic/real union of Mistress and Priest and his later sacrifice. The same applies to the derivation of the suffix of Her name with I w i s d 0m,. (and a male imageat that !) -eventhe confused gnostics understood 'Wisdom' as female. o.N.A"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Baphomet -A Note on the Name II There is a tradition regarding the origin of the name Baphomet which deserves recording, even though it is not regarded as authentic, having no present-day proponents. This tradition regards the name as deriving from ~ouaacr'tLC; ­the Greek name for the Egyptian goddess Bastet, recorded by Herodotus (2.137 ff). It is interesting that Herodotus identifies the goddess with Artemis, the goddess of the moon. Bubastis was regarded as the daughter of Osiris and Isis and often represented as a female with the head of a cat -cats were regarded as sacred to her. Artemis was a goddess unmoved by love and she was regarded as Apollo's twin sister (the identification of her as a 'moon goddess' followed naturally from this since Apollo was linked with the sun). Like Apollo, she often sent death and plagues, and was propitiated sometimes with sacrifices. It is interesting that (a) ~ou~acr't£La is the Pythagorean name for 'five' [qv. Iamblicus: Theologumena Arithmeticae, 31]•\t perhaps a link with the 'pentagram'?; (b) the Templars, with whom the name Baphomet is associated, were said to have worship­ped their deity in the form of a cat. *** The tradition recorded above, and the one described in part I, both regard Baphomet as a female divinity -and both are esoteric traditions, hitherto unrecorded. It is possible that both are correct -that is, that the actual name Baphomet derives (as mentioned in part I) from the Greek ~a~~-~~'tpa: the prefix refering to being 'dyed/ stained' or 'dipped' in blood -qv. Euripides,Hercules Furens: ~aLvO~EvWL nL'tUAwL nAuYX&£LC; iHa'tOYH£~aAOu 't£ ~a~aLC; uopac; (1190) The suffix derives from 'mother' or 'mistress' used in a religious sense (qv. Iamblicus 'De Mysteriis'). This name -Baphomet -is thus a descriptive one for the \"dark\" (i.e lunar) goddess, to whom sacrifices were made, and which was actually known in former times as 'Bubastis' -that is. Bastet, to whom cats were sacred. Thus, Baphomet could be regarded as a form of Artemis/ Bastet -a female divinity with a 'dark' side or nature [when viewed via conventional morality] to whom sacrifices have been. and continue to be. made. Sinister tradition regards Baphomet as the Bride of Satan/Lucifer -this would fit well since Lucifer is often regarded as a form of Apollo: Artemis is the female form('sister') of Apollo. Here. it must be remembered that both Apollo and Artemis were not aetherial. moral and lofty divinities (the classical gods have been romantically misinterpreted) -they could be. and often were. deadly and dark: both 'sinister' and 'light'."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"• • • • • • j A Gift for the Prince - a Guide to Human Sacrifice In ceremonial rituals involving sacrifice, the Mistress of Earth usually takes on the role of violent goddess or 'Baphomet', the Master of the Temple that of either Lucifer or 3atan, the sacrifice being regarded as a gift to the Prince of Darkness. This gift, however, is sometimes offered to the dark goddess, the bride of our Prince. Human sacrifice is pOHerful magick. The ritual death of an individual does two things: it releases enero7 (which can be directed -or stored, for example in a crystal) and it draws down dark forces or 'entities'. Such forces may then be used, by directing them toward a specific goal, or they may be allowed to disperse over the Earth in a natural way, such dispersal\" altering what is sometimes known as the 'astral shell' around the Earth. This alteration, by the nature of the sacrifice, is disruptive -that is, it tends toward Chaos. This issimply anoth~r way of saying that sacrifice furthers the work of Satan. Sacrifice can be voluntary, of an individual, involuntary, of an individual or two, or result from events brought about by Satanic ritual and/or planning (such as wars). Voluntary sacrifice results from the traditional Satanist belief that our life on this planet is only a stage: a gateway to another existence. This other existence is in the acausal realm where the Dark Gods exist. The key to this other existence is not negation, but rather ecstasy. A Satanist revels in life because by living life in a joyful, ecstatic way, the acausal that exists within us all by virtue of our being, is strengthened. For Satanists, not only the manner of living is important but also the manner of death. We must live well, a~d die at the right time, proud and defiant: not waiting sickly and Heak. The scum of the Earth wail and tremble as they face Death: w~ stand laughing and spit Hith contempt. Thus do we learn how to live. Voluntary sacrifice usually occurs every seventeen years as part of the Ceremony of Recalling:the one chosen becomes Immortal, living in the acausal to haunt the edge of our minds. An involuntary sacrifice is when an individual or individuals are chosen by a group, Temple, Order. Such sacrifices are usually sacrificed on the Spring Equinox, although if this is not possible for whatever reason another date may be used. While voluntary sacrifices are always male (and usually twenty-one years of age) there are no restrictions concerning involuntary sacrifices other than the fact that they are usually in some way opponents of Satanism or the Satanic way of living. Great care is needed in choosing a sacrifice: the objec~ being to dispose of a difficult individual or individuals ~ithoutarousing undue suspicion. A Temple or group wishing to conduct such a sacrifice with magickal intent must first obtain permission from the Grand ~Iaster (or Mistress). ~f this is given, then detailed preparation must begin. First choose the sacrifice(s) -those whose removal will actively benefit the Satanist cause. Candidates are zealou~ interfering Nazarenes, those attempting to disrupt in some way established Satanist groups or Orders (e.g. journalists) and political/business individuals whose activities are detrimental to ·the Satanist spirit."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"(Sacrifice -2.)

Both (2) and (3) can be undertaken either directly by ! the group/Temple/Order or its members or by proxy. Proxy ~ I involves the Master or Mistress finding a suitably weak-willed individual and then implanting in their mind by hypnotic means a suitable suggestion. Whatever method is chosen a date for the sacrifice should be set and on that date a s~itable ritual undertaken. This ritual is most usually the Death Ritual -if method (3) is chosen, ~he Ritual is performed twice: first, seven days before the chosen date, and then on the date itself while the member/proxy is undertaking the sacrifice. The energy of this latter ritual is then directed (or stored temporarily) or dispersed over the Earth by the person conducting the ritual. Method (2) involves the Ritual of Sacrifice. The victim or victims are brought or enticed to the area chosen for the Ritual, bound by the Guardian of the Temple and at the appropriate point in the Ritual sacr~ficed by eitherl the Master or Mistress using the Sacrifical Knife.

The manipulation of the energies/forms and so on varies in the different MS, as the aim or intent of such manipulation does -for example, sometimes it is for direct personal desire/gratification, sometimes it is due to unconscious factors, sometimes it is due to a desire (sinister and otherwise) to change/aid a particular individual or individuals. However, just as important in each MS as this covert/ overt form of magick is how and why individuals become changed via it in many and various situations. Thus, for example, sometimes change occurs because of personal involvement with others, sometimes through being influenced (either consciously or unconsciously) by magickal energy (which itself may be directed at that individual by another), sometimes through mediums like music (with perhaps some 'magickal' input from another), sometimes via personal confrontation with unconscious fears and/or insights • All of these changes are presented in the various HSS from differing perspectives -and these perspectives are sometimes individual (directly personal) as they are sometimes magickal. The perspectives change -from MS to MS and sometimes within a single ~IS -and while the perspective may be 'sinister' it is also sometimes 'moral': that is, seen from the viewpoint of an individual adhering to 'conventional morals/attitudes'. This diverse variation is intentional, since by it the reader is (or should be) able to objectify the action/changes/characters and thus understand the influences (magickal and otherwise) behind these, particuarly with reference to the psyche. This understanding is aided by the fact that each MS is related to a particuarly septenary sphere and thus to some extent deals with the energy/magick/influences both unconscious and conscious o~ that sphere. However, as in real life and real magick, other influences (from other spheres) may sometimes intrude and complicate matters and the reader should be capable of understanding the interplay. The understanding that results from a reading and study of the MSS (using the themes, questions and so on revealed here and in other notes on the quintet) is part of the process of Initiate awareness -and should assist those following the seven-fold way to arrive at a personal understanding of their own psyche as well as that of others.

The ~irst o~ these is 'traditional Satanism' -represented by such groups as the ONA -and the second derives ~rom the teachings promulgated by Anton La Vey and includes his 'Church o~ Satan' as well as the 'Temple o~ Set'. In both aims and intent, the two traditions di~~er considerably, and while traditional Satanism may be said to have its roots in Europe (particuarly Britain) the La Vey tradition is primarily American and o~ ~airly recent date. The primary aim o~ traditional Satanism is the achievement, by the individual, o~ magickal Adeptship and this is achieved by Initiated individuals ~ollowing what is called the 'seven­~old way' (sometimes called the 'seven-~old sinister way'). This way is essentially a series o~ magickal techniques, teachings and goals and during its early stages may be said to consist o~ an exploration, by the individual, o~ hidden/latent/sinister/~orbiddenareas o~ consciousness. During these early stages, practical magick is employed, and traditional Satanism distinguishes between 'external' and 'internal' magick. The ~irst type is primarily sorcery; the second, an exploration/expansion o~ individual consciousness. One o~ the tasks o~ an Initiate ~ollowing this seven-~old way is the ~ormation o~ a magickal/Satanic Temple ~or the per~ormance o~ ceremonial rituals. Among these rituals is 'The Black Mass'. However, these ceremonial rituals -and external magick itsel~ o~ whatever kind ­represent only the ~irst ~ew stages o~ the sinister seven-~old way: they are, essentially, a practical training in magick and magickal technique. It is beyond these stages that the real work o~ an Initiate o~ the 'Dark Tradition' begins, and these more advanced stages involve that Initiate in 'Internal' magick -the development o~ individual consciousness. Thus, traditional Satanism is concerned with the 'inner development' o~ its Initiates, and its ~ollowers are ~ew in numbers. Neither theY,nor Jhf ~roups to which they belong, proselytize, and traditional/~'san~s'ocial, religious or political connotations whatsoever. Rather, it is an esoteric way o~ living ~or those ~ew individuals who might be interested - a way ~ounded on Western Occult tradition (an aspect o~ this tradition is known as the Septenary system). The La Vey type o~ Satanism concentrates on a glori~ication·o~ the individual 'ego' and an indulgence in the pleasures o~ li~e. Both the Church o~ Satan and the more recent Temple o~ Set are organized on the basis o~ Satanism as a religion with all that this implies in terms of acceptance o~ doctrine and adherence to an individual leader/master/speci~ic group. The ~undamental tenets of this religion were stated by La Vey in his 'Satanic Dible'. While the Church o~ Satan and the Temple o~ Set di~~er on some organizational matters, they both take this 'Satanic Bibl~' (and other works by La Vey) as their starting point, and 1n many respects the Temple o~ Set may be said to be a 'schism' ~rom the Church o~ Satan. Other Satanic groups both in America, Europe and elsewhere, take these two ' orgainzations as their own 'role model' and ~ollow both their teachings/philosophy and methods o~ magical working."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"••• .. .j . J '.... I J l , Basically, the teachings of La Vey and those following him have their origin in the qabalistic, Grimoire tradition. Ther.. is an identification with the 'demonic' aspects and a desire to use this to further personal goals and ambitions. Generally, followers of this tradition of modern Satanism do not believe in any existence after death, seek practical mastery over others, exult in the pleasures of the flesh, perform rituals and ceremonies for their own benefit and see their beliefs in religious terms. The main groups -the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set ­also actively seek followers, engage in public avowals of Satanic faith and offer members various titles and offices. The aims of these groups include winning converts for their religion, making that religion more accessable and acceptable, and, ultimately, bringing that religion into social prominence. The majority of individuals who profess to be Satanists and who do not belong to any particular grouping, almost without excepti~n adhere to the La Vey tradition. This is so because of the 'publicity profile' attained by La Vey and, following him, Aquino (of the Temple of Set) and because of the ready availability of books dealing with this aspect of Satanism. The fundamental aims of this type of Satanism may be simply stated as the glorification of the ego and the return of instinct. There is not, in this type, any glorification of 'evil' and certainly not any 'Satanic criminal behaviour'. Instead, there is an attempt to change the way the individual views the world -toward what may be termed a more Mephistophelean and Machiavellian approach. In contrast, the followers of more traditional Satanism believe that this approach is only a beginning. These followers eschew the religious approach and instead concentrate on achieving self-development beyond the stage represented by the 'ego'. Traditional Satanism also believes individuals can create for themselves an existence after death, and this creation is seen as one of the fundamental aims of this tradition. Further, traditional Satanist groups and teachers are secret, and those who, after perhaps a deligent uearch, find them and seek to follow their seven-fold way are subjected to many ordeals before being accepted.

Satanism, in many divergent £orms,existed be£ore the Church o£ Satan in both the Old and the New worlds ­and those £orms, as well as new ones, continue to exist independant o£ both this Church and the writings o£ its creater. Thus groups and individuals which claim that the Church o£ Satan (in either its present or its original £orm) represents the only genuine £orm o£ Satanism are, histori9ally, deluding themselves • Such claims are usually based on one or more o£ the £ollowing: (a) The £ounder o£ the Church o£ Satan inaugurated a 'new Satanic' age and this inauguration makes all other ~orms o£ Satanism invalid/super£luousi (b)a mandate was given by some supra-personal being; (c) there is a •pure , tradition and this £orm is represented by a presently existing group. . Basically, those who claim to be 'genuine' Satanists divide into three groups: the Church o£ Satan, the Temple o£ Set and some small European groups (both the Church o£ Satan (CoS) and the Temple o£ Set (ToS) are American in origin) among which the ONA is included. From time to time, other groups become mani£est -both they are almost without exception splinter groups/£ronts o£ the Cos or the ToS (e.g. 'The Werewol£ Order': a CoS '£ront'). The CoS accepts (a) and (c) above and as a group adhere with an almost religious outlook to the £ounder o£ the Church and his 'Bible' -£or example, one the £ollowers o£ this Church states (Black Flame, Vol 2 no 2): \"We have a Bible ••• We have a Church. We have a tradition ••• We have a High Priest.\" The ToS accepts (b) and (c) -the mandate emanating £rom the Prince o£ Darkness in the £orm o£ Set and divulged to mortals in 'The Book o£ Coming Forth by Night'. Further, the ToS accept that they are continuing the work begun by the early CoS, that is, they represent the original and 'pure' Church. In this sense, the ToS is a schism £rom the CoS. Hence the con£lict between the CoS and the ToS -both claim to be the genuine £orm o£ Satanism and both date the new Satanic age in the same way -1990 ev is, £or example, XXV A.S. Both o£ these groups have an organizational structure (although the ToS claims the CoS in its present £orm does not any longer possess a structure) and both have teachings and a leader.

Nonetheless, the ToS demands a certain J J J J J J • • • • commitment (subserviance some opponents would say) to the teachings and authority of the Temple, and while this is not as pronounced as in the CoS it nevertheless exists. The squabbles between the CoS and the ToS aids this commitment -on both sides -and to a certain extent necessitates it. Having become established, and having media profiles, both the CoS and the ToS need to continually re-affirm both their identity and their mission -and this has led to the formation of personality cults (more evident on the side of the CoS although Aquino accepts the role of 'Voice of Set'). Both the Church and the Temple are concerned ­although in different ways -with safeguarding what· they see as the authentic tradition of Satanism, and accordingly each tends to be atagonistic to those outside of this supposed tradition, particuarly if individuals and groups espouse views contrary to their teachings and policies. Both wish to protect what they see as their reputation and this tends to lead to suspicions regarding other groups and individuals who espouse different forms of Satanism -as well as sometimes polemics/dis­information against those groups and individuals to further enhance that reputation at the expense of those others. All this is not unexpected given the form of both the CoS and the Tos and the claims made by each regarding the authority and Buthenticity of their version of Satanism -in fact, all the above follows naturally. In contrast, the ONA, for example, is not concerned with either an imagined (or even real) history regarding its own tradition and teachings -or with trying to claim some authority (either supra-personal or via some new aeonic manifestation) for that tradition and those teachings. Basically, some ONA teachings have been handed down by reclusive Adepts and some have been developed recently. What is 'historical' about these teachings mayor may not be valuable today and mayor may not be of interest to aspirant Adepts -indeed, some of the teachings handed down have been superseded and some of just mystifications. What exists is made accessable enabling its usefulness or irrelevance to be judged on an individual basis. What is important however is that the central core (recently codified and extended in the creative sense) offers a practical path to Adeptship and beyond. (This path being explicated in the books 'Naos', 'The Black Book of Satan', the Oeofel Quartet and the Star Game.) The accent is on practical -it is devoid of mystifications, does not involve theoretical discussions, require acceptance of any dogma, ideology or organizational structure. Neither does it require submission to any individual or authority. It is not concerned with converting others, with reputations or establishing a favourable social climate for its adherents. It is, simply, a very simple and practical set of magickally-inclined workings which any individual can undertake for themselves. It does not need to be 'interpreted' by some Master or guide.

Neither does he claim any authority via having belonged to Bome ancient and mysterious group whose 'Master' taught and Initiated him. The truth is simple, and a little ordinary. He was fortunate perhaps in spending most of his childhood and early youth in Africa and the Far East where, in the former, he grew up among peoples who believed in pagan practices and witchcraft, and, in the latter, he came in contact with many and various traditions including LHP Taoist magie and Martial Arts. All this formed a somewhat unusual education (there is no claim to being 'Initiated' into any form) and provided a continuing interest in esoteric arts. This curiosity, interest together with his keen intellect, enthusiasm and zest for danger' led him to, in later youth, to not only seek out LHP groups in Europe but also into many interesting and diverse experiences, and in the late sixties he was Initiated into some LHP groups/underground Satanic Temples. His diverse experiences then and later (some dangerous, some at variance with pervailing social dogma, many dark, some noetical) provided a useful background for an Occult and personal synthesis and led to him taking responsibility for a small LHP group. The teachings of this group were rather garbled, full of mystifications and occassional insights, but they did provide some basis for creative extension. Thus, the new synthesis that was the seven-fold way was created. The original LHP group had no historical significance and did not claim among its former members any person of significance on any level -it was simply a reclusive circle of a few individuals orientated toward the Black Arts whose teachings (such as they were) centred around a septenary approach to magickal alchemy and a 'mythology' about the Dark Gods. (It should be noted that the other LHP groups he joined either derived their magic from a mixture of Crowley/ Golden Dawn/demonism or were rather boring, lacking Satanic zest.) In the early years of the eigth decade of the present century a decision was made to publish the traditions of this small group (the ONA -as it came to be called some decades earlier) together with the new codification. Some of the traditional material concerned Sacrifice and some related to the Dark Gods mythos. No one within this group believes these traditions and methods are unalterable or invested with 'supernatural' authority. As expressed in such published works as 'Naos' and 'The Black Book' they are a practical method of achieving magickal Adeptship and extending consciousness into the next stage of its development. Thus the DNA has no structure because no structure is needed -its members may guide others i£ those others wish, such guidance occuring because those members have themselves undergone (to a greater or lessor extent depending on their own personal development) the tasks of the seven-fold way arid can thus offer advice from experience.

Because of the nature of our consciousness, the Abyss lies latent within all of us -that is, our consciousness consists of both causal and acausal aspects. In this sense, we are all 'Gates'/~e acausal dimensions, although this Gate -and the pathways leading to/from it -often lies undiscovered. Magickal training is essentially the discovery, exploration and use of these pathways • Symbolized causally, the Abyss lies between the spheres of the Sun and Mars in the septenary Tree of Wyrd, and the 'Entering the Abyss' is that stage of magickal development which distinguishes the Master/ Mistress from the Adept. The experience of the Abyss -which the Grade Ritual 'Entering the Abyss' begins -is fundamentally a destruction of the self-image which the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept created and which was glimpsed during the External Adept rite. It is also the destruction of all personal illusions regarding opposites: the final 'withdrawing of projections'. In essence, the Internal Adept has learnt (mainly through the Grade Ritual) to withdraw the projections of the 'ego' from other individuals -that is, their is an understanding of individuals as those individuals are in essence: without the distortion of one's own passions/ideas/prejudices and without the distortions of other people's ideas/judgements and so on. The experience of the Abyss takes this a stage further -there is a withdrawal of all personal projections made by every individual upon others/the 'cosmos' and so on: both personal and impersonal. Thus, the essence is apprehended behind the appearence which the causal produces because it is the causal.Put very simply, the Abyss is the beginning of acausal perception. ­This perception implies a complete understanding of oneself, one's wyrd, as well as an understanding of others, of aeonic influences, and of the 'comsos' itself -the beginnings of wisdom ••• Yet this does not mean a negation of individuality. Rather, it is an enhancement of consciousness. This is so because the Abyss is also the Tree of Wyrd itself -all the spheres and the pathways in both their individual and aeonic forms: the 'individual forms' being Jungian-type archetypes (and the experiences/ understanding appropriate to these) on a personal level, and the 'aeonic forms' being aeonic/cultural myths and images on a supra-personal level, in both 'sinister' and 'light' aspects. Further, the Abyss is also a direct opening or \"Gate\" to the acausal dimensions. The ritual of the Abyss implies an acceptance of acausal energies as those energies are -that is, without any 'abstract', personal or judgemental views. It is a letting 'in' of those Null, Chaotic energies without any hindrence. This of course can be dangerous, but the preparation reduces this danger as well as making possible an understanding of those energies and the 'forms' they mayor may not assume in both the causal and acausal worlds. This latter point is quite important, because there have been many who, unprepared, having experienced some acausal energies via entering the Abyss too soon. Quite often, the result of this premature magickal experience is madness or extreme personal dis-orientation resulting in a 'possessed' personal life~and/or loss of vitality; another and frequent result is personal delusion about one's own abilities and understanding, both personal and magickal. This understanding of the acausal, vital to a 'successful' crossing of the Abyss, derives from the preparation implicit in (a) having undertaken the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept [that is, in essence, haVing spent at least three months alone without any external influences and without any personal contact] and (b) having fulfilled the tasks revealed by that Grade Ritual. This fulfilling of personal tasks (the accomplishment"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"I... ] of part of the wyrd of the individual) is necessary (and it takes from one to many years after the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept) because it dissipates the energy of the 'self-image' that the Grade Ritual produces,] preparing thus a voidness within the Adept. The Adept generally knows when this inner void is reached (in simple terms, the personal, driving energy is gone through achievement of personal goals: the reality, of course, is more complicated and here the advice of a Master/Mistress/Magus] is often saught). The ritual of the Abyss is simple. The physical part (the walk in the specified time without assistance) is essential preparation for the]\t 'magickal' part because it prepares the consciousness in a very speci~ic way as well as draining the physical rescources of the body. To complete the walk given the conditions stated requires determination -and this ] ] determination is released/abandoned when the magickal part of the rite is begun, this release/abandonement occurring quite naturally because the physical goal has been achieved. Thus, there is a 'hidden' wisdom in the construction of the rite (as there is in all the Grade Rituals). The physical part also creates -because of the isolation - a feeling within the individual of being only a part of something more vast, and it for this reason that the walk is undertaken as far from human habitationlas possible. This isolation, the concentration required to walk at a pace-enabling the goal to be reached within the set time, the rhythm of walking, the anticipation of the magickal part, all combine to produce] the conditions necessary within the consciousness of the individual conducive to success. ] As mentioned above, the Abyss is also an opening into the acausal. The 'passing of the Abyss' is the opening of that 'Gate' within us. All ma~ck\t is a glimpse of the acausal. and the stages of the seven-fold]\t way are really stages when the acausal energies are developed and understood in a progressively more emphatic manner -that is. they may be seen as 'pushing that Gate wider and wider' -in the passing of the]\t Abyss there is no longer a Gate. but rather a union or fusion. In another sense, the seven-fold way may be said to be the creation. within the consciousness of the individual. of connections or pathways to the acausal -each stage developes more and more pathways until they form aJ\t conduit through which acausal energy 'flows'. Beyond the Abyss, the individu\"l is part of the acausal 'flow' and has achieved the goal of sentient life. This is really the great secret of alchemy, of magick and of the LeftJ\t Hand or Sinister Path itself -that is, we can create for ourselves another existence in another 'universe' and an existence which con~inues after our causal self dies. The means to this existence is simply -the seven fold way.J According to tradition, the Abyss is also presenced physically in our causal universe. That is, terrestrial and 'Space' or 'Star' Gates existJ where the two universes are joined. In reality, the terrestrial Gat~s may be said to be points where the causal and acausal come close to contact: where there is 'seepage' of acausal energy -the discovery of these placesI f\t and then the 'opening of the Gate' via magick producing Aeonic energy to alter the causal (and thus the individuals in the world).

This double tetrahedron encloses in three-diNensional space the path £rom causal to acausal -the 'Initiate journey' £rom the sphere o£ the Moon to Saturn vii the other spheres, this path being helical (c£. 'The wheel o£ Li£e'). The direction o£ this path is 'counter-clockwise'. In essence, the acausal is a re£lexion (and vice versa) o£ the causal, so the single term 'Nine Angles' describes what is our normal (i.e. un-Initiated) view o£ the septertary, this septenary being a 'map' o£ consciousness and the cosmos. The realization o£ the dual nature o£ the spheres (for example, Mercury is the 'shadow' o£ Mars) arises £rom Initiation and is th~ first stage o£ an esoteric understanding o£ the term 'nine angles'. The term also describes the nine fundamental 'alchemical' forms (represented by the symbols eCQ), 8C'£:) or ~(W), t>t(>') ~ii<.(w) and so on:i.e. the pieces of the Star Game). These forms are the basic apprehensions of magickal energy and thus re-present the acausal manifest in the causal (in the many forms of that mani£estation -e.g. individual consciousness:the images/archetypes pertaining thereto). Hence each of these symbols is an 'angle' re the above description o£ the septenary Tree. These nine fundamental £orms (the abstract symbolism is a stage o£ understanding beyond the purely causal geometric one) exist in many combinations within the nexion which the 'Tree o£ Wyrd' represents -and these combinations are abstractly symbolized by the placement o£ the many pieces of the Star Game over the seven boards ('Spheres') o£ that game. (Note: The Advanced form o£ the Star Game is the most complete representation, but £or convenience the septenary £orm will be used here. It should be noted, however, that the septenary form -dif£icult though it is £or Initiates serves only as an introduction to the Advanced game.) This abstraction, in terms of the Star Game, makes the forms understandable on a level higher than that using words and ideas -this understanding is a new form o£ thinking, a form appropriate to the next century and beyond. Such an understanding arises from playing the Star Game and relating the abstract symbols to conventional representations (e.g. archetypal £orms; the energies o£ the pathways; the symbolism o£ the Tarot and the many and various Occult symbolisms) -this developes the capacity for what may be termed 'acausal thinking': when the conventional representations are abandoned and collocations are viewed abstractly. This 'abstraction' is however a new 'insight' ( a lower form of which is often described an 'intuition'> and not a dry, academic process: it extends consciousness into new and important realms and pre-figures the development o£ a symbolic language which eliminates the confusion, both moral and linguistic, which exists in words and the translation of complex ideas into such words. It is 'mathesis' in the ancient Greek sense and while not being what we understand as 'mathematics' it complements mathematical abstraction and indeed"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"interacts with it in some places: Essentially, the symbolism is a new tool to assist and develope our understanding, and it is via this symbolism that the meanings of the nine angles may most easily be understood without confusion. On a less refined esoteric level (i.e. in more 'conventional' esoteric terms) the nine symboliz~ the sigil formed by connecting the spheres of the Tree of Wyrd with the two most important 'Gates' (see illustration). This sigil describes the energy flow and may be used, magickally, in several ways -for example, as a visualization 'sigil' (in hermetic rituals etc.) as a symbol of the path walked during certain rites (some connected with Esoteric Chant -qv. 'Naos') and when an 'Earth Gate' is being saught with a view to drawing acausal energy through it to change the causal (e.g. inaugurate a new aeon) -the find an Earth Gate the sequence would be begun to end at the 'Earth Gate'. The nine also represents the tetrahedron (for example, tpe crystal one used in the Rite of the Nine Angles) which is itself symbolic of the nexion described by the Tree of Wyrd. Thus, for instance, in the Nine Angles Rite, the crystal represents one aspect of the nexion, the Priestess and Priest the other: together (i.e. the bringing together in the ritual) they enable the nexion to be opened. In this sense, the Priest and Priestess (when conjoined) form a 'tetrahedron' Which, joined with the crystal one, enables acausal energy to become manifest in the causal (the 'world') -,this is the secret hinted at in many historical alchemical MSS (for example the 'Rosarium Philosophorum': \"Make a round circle of the man and the woman •••\") and occassionally depicted .. in drawings. This 'double tetrahedron' is a magickal•.• •. form of the double described above in the first paragraph (the causal geometric one). In some 'esoteric' circles the nine is seen in terms of the five, the five itself deriving from the five angles of the inverted pentagram. This is, however, a mis­understanding, deriving as it does from Viewing the 'angles' two-dimensionally when in fact they should be considered in a three-dimensional way, at first, and then four-dimensionally (the helical path within the tetrahedrons). This four-dimensional view is in itself only a beginning -beyond is the multi-dimensional when both the causal and the acausal spaces are considered.

Thus the importance in the cult of Thelema attached to Set/Shaitan/Satan -an attempt to re-integrate into the consciousness of the individual the duality represented by the formula LAShTAL. However, despite the many claims, Crowley did not inaugurate a new Aeon. His restoration is simply a restoring of something long dead - a kind of necromancy, and as a magickal force the cult of Thelema might as well not exist. In the exoteric sense, 'Shaitan' represents those instinctive levels that are often, in our modern society, repressed in the individual -and Satanic rituals of either the traditional kind or the kind based on the use of sexual formulae, are a means of catharsis: a beginning where consciousness is prepared and liberated from the restrictions implicit in ordinary life. In practical terms -and for the civilization of the West whose dominant religion and ethos has hindered by its distortion all that is natural in terms of sex -this often means participation in rituals such as those given in 'Codex Saerus' or Crowley's Gnostic t-lass or some form of sexual working. Such participation restores the balance that is often lacking. Yet such a participation is only a beginning -and the ritual forms of such a participation are only a means. They are means to experience and if correctly undertaken should provide the individual l~ith an understanding of that aspect of their personality which has been symbolized as Satan (for men) and Lilitu/Darl.at (for women) -the darker, sensual side. Such an understanding is personal in the sense that the personality of the individual is involved, and the perspective achieved is usually that of the life, or Destiny, of the individual in relation to his circumstances and other individuals. That is, there is little concern with or appreciation of, the forces of an Aeon -other than perhaps some vague 'intellectual' understanding: or what is thought of as understanding. This re-integration of the dnrker aspects -lihether it occurs through participation in rituals or via other techniques of magick -is represented, in the septenary system, by the three lOlier .spheres of the Tree of \\.[yrd (r-Joon, ;';ercury and Venus) and these snheres sYmbolize the three sta~es of that re-integratio~ -that-is, Calcination, Sepe~ation and Coagulation to use alchemical terms.

An integration and thus understanding of this nature -enab1ing the individua1 to bui1d upon the foundations thus achieved -of necessity imp1ies the deve10pment of those qua1ities such as reason, 10gic and scientific understanding, which Crow1ey et a1 have abandoned.

Rather, it imp1ies the deve10pment of the mind and a certain way o~ thinking. On both the esoteric and exoteric 1eve1s, the most significant step so far in the ev01ution of our consciousness has been the deve10pment of rationa1 ana1ysis and its extension as the scientific method. The acceptance of this method (which does not prec1ude an acceptance of the forces with which magick dea1s}imp1ies a certain 'view of the wor1d' and a persona1 approach to 1iving: a way which is at once cautious, genera11y optimistic and open and enquiring. This 'view of the wor1d' or way of thinking derives from the ancient Greeks -it is expressed in their ear1y phi10sophy (i.e before the dec1ine represented by P1ato), in their re1igious attitude and in their way of 1iving. It is essentia11y the same attitude exemp1ified by Western paganism, and it is the antithesis of that view and way represented by the re1igion of the Nazarene. The re1igion of the Nazarene inverts a11 natura1 va1ues -as Nietzsche understood. The1ema, and simi1ar be1iefs, negate, as Nazarene phi10sophy and 1ife does, that natura1 spontaneity which is the essence of this pagan 'view of the wor1d' -because The1ema ties the mind in knots of obscurity and metaphysica1 specu1ation (as the qaba1a in genera1 does) -it brief1y frees the spirit on1y to weigh down the spirit with the chains of its own metaph~·sics. The true ethos of the West -which the re1igion of the Nazarene distorted and supp1anted -may be signified by the word 'Azif' and the symb01 of the sunwhee1J it is pagan in essence. The ethos of the West (lfhich derives from the present Aeonic force or 'cur~ent' first estab1ished c. 500 AD) is not and never has been patriarcha1 in the sense that Crow1ey and his f0110wers be1ieved -such a 'patriarcha1' ethos representing the distortion imposed upon the origina1 ethos by the Nazarenes. That Crow1ey and others were unaware of this is indicative of how far removed The1ema is from genuine esoteric tradition. Esoterica11y, the genuine Western ethos is symb01ized by that force which has become 1~0,~ as 'Satan' or Lucifer.

During this time, the distortion of the current caused by the Nazarenes and their allies mayor may not continue ­depending on how certain Initiates use certain powerful magicl\\:al forces. 'vhatever, the 'New Aeon' (the sixth out of the seven that mark our evolution) will have its beginnings on the magickal level within the next few decades -although on the practical level it will be about another three centuries until the effects are apparent. This new Aeon will have no 'word' and its magick will be the magick of 'Thought', that is spontaneous empathy. One of the most fundamental facets of this new Aeon will be the development of a symbolic language which extends the frontiers of thought. Such a language is already prefigured in the Star Game -just as the Star Game itself ,\\'as prefigured in traditional Alchemy. Another facet of the new Aeon will be the emergence of a new type of individual:a type outlined by Nietzsche. This new individual will be fierce, free (of both external and internal/psychic influences), exult in exploration and discovery and possess an essentially pagan attitude to life. It is and has been one of the aims of genuine sinister Orders to produce such individuals -by having their Initiates follow the seven-fold sinister way. What has happened over the past fifty or more years is that the distortion of the Western ethos -and thus the genuine Aeonic current -has increased. Part of this increase is, in fact, due to Crowley and those who have followed him and his system 'dthout really understanding what they ,\\'ere doing. The genuine ~estern esoteric tradition -as distinct from ,~hat most Occultists 'dsh to believe is the 'secret tradition' -has no connection whatever with the qabalah, or Egyptian mysteries and symbolism, and neither does it employ in any way the sorcery of 'grimoire magic' and the forms once appropriate to now dead Aeons be such forms Sumerian, Babylonian, Egyptian or whatever. The basis of the ~estern tradition was and always has been rational in the sense that those 'iho carried on its tradition saught to understand themselves, the world and the cosmos in a detached manner -free from religious/political do~a. That is, to understand things as those things are in themselves: without the projection of beliefs and _ideas .• To this end, the septenary system was evolved, and the 'mysteries' expressed in abstract symbolism (of which Alchemy was one :form).

'great secret' or 'hidden l:nowledge' to be revealed to Initiates only -rather, it was the belief that everything in the cosmos could be understood if one probed, investigated or thought enough about it. That is, the cosmos 'tas seen as a natural order into which individuals could gain insight. From this insight, a new individual would emerge: a more conscious, evolved, person. The tradition thus encouraged the development in the individual o:f empathy via personal experience: an experiencing of all aspects of our o,m nature as h\"ell as the worlds within and without. Thus were the 'rnagickal/Occult' faculties themselves developed. The way o~ this tradition was essentially"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"••• practical -exemplified by the Grade Rituals, tasks and so on of the seven-fold way. There was no speculative metaphysical system, no acceptance of irrational fears and beliefs, no subserviance to someone else's personal mythology. The new Aeon should be a continuation of the process which the genuine Western tradition began. Yet it is possible that this new Aeon may never emerge. The distortion of the Western current does and has represented a desire by some to return to what may be described as an aspect of the Babylonian ethos. This aspect gave rise eventually to not only the poison of Nazarene philosophy and religion, but also to the many political and social sytems and ideas founded in the 'Nazarene view of the world'. There is, at this moment in time, a very real magickal conflict occuring between two forces -those representing (whether consciously or not is immaterial) this Babylonian/Nazarene ethos, and those represent.i.ng the genuine \\;estern (and thus 'sinister') tradition. On the outcome of this conflict the next Aeon depends -there will be either the new Aeon with the blossoming of the individual and the development of consciousness giving thus a liberation from the tyranny of religion and politics, or a return to those essentially patriarchial dualistic values where impersonal ideals/ideology have precedence over the individual. Every act of genuine sinister magick is a step toward the new Aeon.

Two things are obvious. First, the Temple of Set is not a Satanic organization; and second, it is not anJ Occult one. Satanism by its nature is an elite philosophy of living and its genuine adherents are few in number and usually]\t secretive (for a variety of reasons). The individuals who follow this path are generally rebels who either cannot or do not wish to conform. Those who desire the]\t exhileration and danger of extremes: those who cannot and will not obey o~ bow down. In short, those who possess 'spirit'. For them, Satan is adopted as a symbol of .... defiance -and this defiance is and has been highlyJ individual. Rather than accept, they question; rather than believe, they seek to discover for themselves. They have -a dislike of authority and all dogma. Gradually, this spirit of defiance brings a self-awareness: an insight into themselves and others and 'the world', and this results from the diverse (and sometimes dangerous) experiences]\t of life which those individuals undergo. Of course, some never reach this point -they fa±l, for whatever reason or reasons. Further, Satanism is about individuals fulfilling theJ potential of life: they strive to live as fully as possible, to reach out and become like gods (or goddesses). In ...\t achieving this, magick is used as a means -of enhancing life, and understanding. Such striving either makes creative individuals -or it destroys them. This creativity is evident in the life of the individual: through works (e.g. artistic) or through what they achieve (for example-making their own life a work of art which others may try and copy). All this means two essential things. First, they can be no such thing as a Satanic organization or dogma; and second, there can be no Satanic authority (e.g. in the form of an individual). Organization implies conformity and loss of personal identity and authority (however small) •• Dogma implies accepting someone else's beliefs. Authority (of whatever kind) implies subserviance - a mentality alien to Satanists. Furthermore, all these stifle creativity: •\t one hallmark of a genuine Satanist• The Temple of Set is thus an example of what Satanism is not. It is not a religion; it does not possess any 'authority'; it does not need an organization nor any media-profile of 'acceptability'. Of course, some guidance in the initial stages may7tand often is) required by those just beginning their quest, and here the experience of those who have gone that way in the past may be of interest or value. But essentially each individual learns via their own experiences -no one can do it for them: there is no magic formula, no mysterious handshake which brings instant wisdom. For the begineer, 'Masters' and organizations are a snare, a path which leads only to the glorification of the ego of the 'Master'. Such 'Masters' are usually insecure people who need the adulation and attention -it makes them feel alive, important. Naturally, some Satanists play such a 'role' -for a time."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"• 1 ~ I J --] • • But they soon tire of it -it becomes boring. That is, if they are Satanists. Anyone who plays it for more than a year has arrested development -their quest has ended in failure. Regarding the second point made above -viz. the Temple of Set is not an Occult organization. Implicit in any Occult path -Left Handed or Right Handed -are certain obligations stemming from the very nature of Occultism. Wicca, Paganism, Satanism, Black Magick -whatever -all are means, paths which though difCerent in some respects have the same ultimate goal: or at least, when those paths are followed to their ends. In a simplistic sense, the goal is evolution -developing abilities, enhancing already existing ones, re-discovering forgotten ones. Occult paths reveal through the beginning that is Initiation they show the essence hidden by the appearence. Or, expressed a different way, they dis-cover what is concealed. Part of what is concealed is, of course, the 'mysterious' ­another is the occult energies of living things ••• On an individual level, the Occult is the discovery of what is hidden within ourselves, in our own psyche, and Occult paths are processes of self-learning -of what our unique Destiny is and how we relate to the cosmos, this Earth, other individuals. Initiation is the beginning of a quest - a symbol to that part of the psyche normally hidden which the 'Occult' wishes to bring into consciousness, giviing thus understanding. The form that this symbol assumes is actually irrelevant, and Whatever its outer form it implies a responsibility by the very fact that it is a conscious participation, by the Initiate, in evolution. In the simple sense, Initiation is when the individual begins to take responsibility Cor their own development, their own evolution: the first genuine step toward real freedom, internal psychic freedom. It is the birth of one small part of the new age. Naturally, quite often the promise of Initiation is not fulfilled -or is fulfilled only in part -in many individuals. But some continue and of those some may achieve the goal. This promise is why the Establishment and conventional religions discourage Occultism and conduct campaigns against it -for Occultism is a means to real freedom and as such it is a threat to them and their domination of the individual. Occult paths lead to inner freedom and one of the responsibilities of any Initiate is to continue this evolutionary quest by passing onto another or others not only what they themselves may have learnt but also the 'Occult ideal' -inner liberation through an Initiatory quest. This ensures continuity and future possibilities. This passing on is never forced, nor is it in any way dogmatic -for it is related to another aspect of Initiatory responsibility: the respect for differing paths, different quests. Having myself followed a specific Left Hand Path, I am inclined to believe it is worthwhile and effective. But I also realize it is not suited to everyone who wishes to begin their own Occult quest. For many years I recruited for a Satanic group (although 'recruit is hardly the word: offered the path to those who possessed the right qualities is nearer the mark) but I was never interested in mere numbers, in proselytizing and tried hard to dissuade most applicants to test their seriousness -because Satanism is difficult and at times dangerous (in psychic terms). I was always aware that other paths were available and perhaps"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"more suitable to some (indeed, to most who applied). I, as an Occultist, knew that Initiation involves the free commitment of an individual -for the goal was their liberation, not their subjection by me or anyone else. Given all these factors, it is impossible not to• conclude that the Temple of Set is not an Occult organization.I It does not respect other paths, and other individuals, as is shown by their attempts to discredit others and their insistence that they represent the only genuine form ofi Satanism. Furthermore, their dogmatic, religious stance ­with all that is therefore implied in terms of acceptance of Temple authority and mandates -rather than liberating1\t their members actually holds them in thrall, both mental and psychic. Rather than participating in that liberation and evolution which is part of the new age, the Temple of Set actually an offshoot of the old order and its .!.tifling ways of being. This is shown, for example, in their concern with numbers, in trying to recruit regardless of quality and regardless of whether the individual is actually suited to the Left Hand Path -for, for the Temple, numbers mean influence, feathers in the cap of the leader - a sign that the Temple is pre-eminent, flourishing andl succeeding. -Naturally, much more could be written to further detail the reasons as to why this particular organization is l\t detrimental to what we as Occultists seek to achieve by our various paths. But the essence of the matter has been revealed -sufficient to enable readers to judge the matter for themselves.] To return, finally, to the personal level - I have no cause to defend, no desire for personal gain in what I write: only a desire for others to understand what is really important about the Occult and the path which a longJ time ago I myself decided I would follow. Organizations like the Temple of Set undermine what serious followers of the Left Hand Path have been trying to achieve forJ centuries -basically because its members and leaders seek to glorify their own egos at the expense of the inner freedom of others. •••\t ONA"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":".'

Such a declaration will establish for all time a permanent record and willi expose the fraudulent 'Satanists' for what they are -individuals who like to be associated with the glamour of evil and darkness, but who lack the -inspiration, courage and daring to ~ evil and dark. Furthermore, I repeatI what I have written before -Satanism is not now and can never be, an ~ intellectualized philosophy just as it most certainly is not in any way ethical or moral. It is an individualized defiance and an individualized strivingl\t which vitalizes, which affirms existence in an ecstatic way -as such, it is a way of living which courts danger, excess. It is not nor can ever be, dogmatic just as it'never involves submission to anyone or anything. For this reason, there can never be genuine Satanic Churches or 'Temples' where Initiates conform to dogma or authority -such things are not for genuine Satanic Initiates but for the deluded, those lacking spirit and talent: in brief, for the manipulated, rather than the manipulators.-I-\tSacrifice: In genuine Satanism [primal Satanism] sacrifice is accepted, and indeed I necessary. In former times, it involved both animal and human sacrifice. Today, however, it involves human sacrifice only -since there are an abundence of ~ -suitable specimens, due to the increase in human dross. Sacrifice is accepted Satanic practice for several reasons. First, it is a ..\t test of Satanic character -to kill someone on the personal level (e.g• with one's own hands) is a character building experience, and today enables various skills to be developed (e.g. cunning in execution and planning).]\t Second, it has magickal benefits (qv. the Order MS \"A Gift for the Prince\"), Third, it sorts the imitation or toy Satanists out from the genuine -the former find excuses and usually retreat to their comfy, intellectualized world of playing at 'Satanic roles and rituals', or they are genuinely horrified andI.-\texpose themselves for what they are -gutless cowards who lack Satanic darkness . However, as explained elsewhere, genuine Satanic sacrifice is always done for a reason - a calculating purpose. [qv., for example,'Satanism, The Sinister Shadow, Revealed.'] It is never strictly personal -i.e. it does not arise from any desire which is personal, whether unconscious or not. Further, it\t is accepted practice that the victims, the opfers, choose themselveo Thus, opfers are never selected at random just as they are never children (although occassionaly an opfer may be a virgin). Mostly, the victims, whose removal will aid the sinister dialectic, are tested, and only if they fail these tests will they become opfers. The tests, of course, are unknown to the victim. For example, a series of tests, or 'games' are prepared once the victim has been chosen, and each test or game requires the victim to make . a specific choice. One choice leads to another test or game. After a certain number of choices of a certain type, the victim is deemed to have failed, and so chooses their own sacrifical death. Most often, the tests are tests of character -those that are shown to be worthless in character become opfers. Thus, a number of victims are selected -those whose removal will aid<. the sinister dialectic of history [qv. 'The Sinister Shadow' MS for an example.]. These are then, without their knowledge, tested. If they fail, they become opfers. [See below, under 'Crime', for an example of the kind of tests that •\t may be involved -the ones for sacrifice are, of course, much more 'testing'.] The actual sacrifice has two forms: (1) during a ritual; (2) by practical ~eans (e.g. assassination/'accidents') without any magickal trappings. If (2) ~s chosen, then a ritual of sacrifice may still be undertaken, but with a 'sYmbolic' opfer (e.g. a wax figurine named after the actual opfer)."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"• .. ... The actual execution of the act of sacrifice -whether during a ritual or otherwise -will be carefully planned, and calculatingly done. This planning will mean the death will seldom if ever be seen as a Satanic act even if it has occured during a ritual. Today, and in the recent past, most sacrifices are of the second type -i.e. acts of execution undertaken by a Satanic novice 'in the real world', involving assassination and 'accidents' or viewed by others (e.g. the Police) as seemingly \"motiveless crimes\" . Further, in genuine Satanic groups, the execution of this act is an essential prerequisite to Adeptship. The aim of the sacrifice can be either (a) part of a dark ritual -i.e. to presence sinister energies in the causal, causing changes in the world, such changes aiding the dark forces (examples would be the Ceremony of Recalling; the Sinister Calling); or (b) as part of general sinister strategy, adduced via Aeonics. [ Note: This latter occurs when a novice progresses along the Satanic path according to tradition.] Crime: Crime is not an end, but a means. A criminal act is not done because it is criminal but because the act itself has a purpose or intent -the criminality of that act being irrelevant. This purpose is either to aid self-excellence (build Satanic character) or aid sinister strategy. Basically, an act is judged not by whether it is illegal (and thus criminal) in a particular country, but rather by its purpose or intent. Or, expressed more simply, by whether that act can serve Satanism in general and self­development in particular. An example will best illustrate this. A satanic novice conceived the idea of gaining experience by burglary. The monetary benefits were useful, but incidental to the main purpose. As a Satanist, he of course planned carefully and chose wisely. First, the jobs themselves had to be difficult, challenging and thus interesting -they would require careful planning and delicate execution. So he chose Apartments, and entry mainly via windows and roofs -this needed some training and the acquisition of skills, plus daring and courage. Second, the people to be deprived of some of their belongings would choose themselves -they would be 'tested' to see if they were suitable victims. The selection would be by character -according to their nature. This required the novice to use his own judgement and instinct. He would select those who showed they lacked character, breeding, nobility -who lacked, in fact, the virtues of a Satanist. [Note: One of the best exoteric descriptions of 'Satanic' character -and also of those lacking it -was given by Nietzsche in his 'The Anti-Christ'. The Satanist adheres to a 'master-morality'.] The novice selected some Apartments in a city where the pickings would be rich. Then he observed the occupants for some time -watching them, their routines and so on. Next, he arranged for the execution of his tests. Two friends (who were actually Initiates of his Order -or rather the Order he had joined) were enlisted to aid him in this. They would appear, on his signal, and seem to rob him as he lingered near the entrance to the building when one of his chosen victims was near. On the first occassion, the victim ignored the 'robbery', and continued on his way. On the second, the next victim came to his aid and actually knocked one 'robber' unconscious with a punch, albeit for a short time. Thus, the first victim or mark became selected, or rather selected himself by his actions, and it was from his Apartment that the novice stole some things some days later. Of course, the planning and execution of such a test was difficult -requiring acting, timing, manipulation, daring, zest -in brief, experience in the real world. Following this success, he moved to another target and found some new victims for his test. It was interesting that these tests confirmed the novice's· instinctive assessment of the victim's character -and thus aided his Satanic judgement."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"--------' In this example, the burglary was a 'crime', in Law -but, in fact, the illegal nature of the act was irrelevant. The act, and its planning etc., aided the self-excellence of the novice, and thus his magickal development, because it was a Satanic act, not because it was 'criminal' -that is, it involved danger, required skill, judgement, daring, and it was real. It was, in a sense, a practical ordeal and its Satanic character meant that its victims were victims of themselves: the act was akin to an act of 'natural justice'. To some, it may seem a game -and so it was, but one played in earnest, in which losing meant capture and probable imprisonment (factors which made it interesting and worthwhile). And it was only a few incidents in a life crammed with such incidents -at different levels. FUrthermore, this 'realness' is important -genuine Satanists involve themselves with the real world, in real situations with real people and real danger. The imitation Satanists play mental and intellectual and 'safe' games. The difference is that a real Satanist will actually be an assassin, for example, while the imitation Satanist will dream of being one and will probably obtain a moronic pleasure from watching some fictional story and 'identifying' with a fictionalized assassin -or, more likely, will 'act out' such a role in some pathetic psuedo-magickal ceremony and believe he/she has attained something. Naturally, in the real world things can and do go wrong. But as always, the real Satanists survive and prosper, while the others go under, get caught, give up or are killed. Also, sometimes even the best get things a little wrong -but they learn from their mistakes, they grow in character, in insight, in skill. Genuine Satanists are survivors: they learn and prosper, and die at the right time. This growth means that a Satanist moves on -there are always new challenges, new delights, new tests of skill, daring, endurence,courage: new insights. A 'role' is only a role -played, then discarded, transcended. Thus, even crime, sacrifice, tests of others, become left behind, given time -they have served the purpose for which they were intended -and a new being is given birth, one more joins the elect. This is simply another way of saying that a Satanist is never trapped by the act, the desires for and against that act, its consequences, or indeed anything to do with that act, whatever the nature of the act. An act, such as a sacrifice or a crime, is a means -to something beyond. Allacts are experience. A Satanist is above and beyond acts - a master or mistress of them, rather than a slave to them. So it is, so it has been and so it will be -for genuine Satanists. Meanwhile, the imitation Satanists will play their word-games, feast on self-delusions, and continue to claim that 'Satanism' never involves sacrifice, or criminal acts but is a rather pleasing philosophy which has had a rather 'bad press'. But, henceforward, anyone who is taken in by these gutless, posturing charlatans will deserve the epithet 'stupid'. ONA"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Bard Reality of Satanism The hard reality of Satanism is that it is very different from both the media image and the more recent image pedalled by imitation Satanists in both Europe and America. I What Satanism Is: a) Satanism is a quest for self-excellence, involving real danger, real challenges and requiring real courage. It involves taking your body to and beyond its physical limits of endurence. It involves real action, alone: without the support of friends, comrades, lovers, relations or anyone. It involves accepting challenges -physical, psychic, intellectual ­and triumphing soley by one's own efforts. It involves the ~riumph of pure, individual will and desire. b) Satanism is, in part, an inner quest, an exploration of the 'hidden' (and overt) aspects of consciousness: a dis-covery of the darkness within and beyond the individual psyche. This involves 'magickal acts' -such as rituals. This magick, however, is a means, not an end. c) Satanism involves ordeals, both physical and magickal. Those who are suitable triumph; the others fail. [One such ordeal is the Grade Ritual of Internal ~dept -where the candidate lives alone and isolated, bereft of everything except the bare necessities for physical survival, for a period of three months.] d) Satanism requires the practical experiencing of all moral limits, and then a mastery of\t the feelings, desires, pleasures, terrors, pains and so on that J these imply. e) Satanism involves the individual defiance of all subserviance: a Satanist accepts guidance only, and refuses to be dominated or intimidated by anyone. This guidance is toward practical experience, and it by this experience that the novice learns and developes a genuine Satanic character. f) Satanism involves sacrifice -this is a necessary test of character •\t [qv. the MSS \"Satanism, Sacrifice and Crime -The Satanic Truth\", and \"Satanism -The Sinister Shadow, Revealed\" for more details.]. g) Satanism is a means - a method, or way, and the purpose of this means, method or way is to\t produce a specific type of individual: the next stage of our evolution as\t a species. Satanism is thus an expression of evolutionary change -on both the individual level and in respect of 'societies' and 'history'. The individuals so created often inspire in the supine majority a certain terror/awe/admiration/fear/jealousy. h) Satanism is elitist. It does not compromise -its tests, ordeals, methods and character-building experiences are severe and will never be made easier to make them\t acceptable to more people or easier to undertake. i) Satanism is esoteric by nature and intent: it is both a 'secret' way, by virtue of\t its methods etc., and it is not nor probably will be suitable for\t the majority for many, many centuries."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"l 1 ] ] J J ] II What Satanism Is Not: a} Satanism is not, nor can ever be, a religion, nor just a 'philosophy'. A religion means acceptance of authority, the rigid structure of a 'Church' or a 'Temple', and a unified dogma (with the consequent schisms and claims to \"authenticity\"). The religious attitude is the antithesis of what Satanism really is -for Satanism is a way of living, a way of experiencing, in the raw, whereas religion abstracts, limits endevour, behaviour and moralizes. In short, a Satanist plunges into reality, without any supports (moral, psychic or human) whereas a religious person has that reality prescribed by dogma, authority and such like, and is supported by a 'Church', its members and their attitudes. Satanism is an ecstatic affirmation of existence - a taking of existence into new and higher realms, as well as a plunge into existing darkness and the creation of new darkness. b} Satanism cannot have anyone impose upon it any structure, authority, or institution of any kind by claiming a 'dark mandate' or some kind of 'revelation'. There can be no such thing as an 'infernal mandate' of whatever kind because the only thing that really matters to Satanism is experience, its accumulation and the highly individualized learning that results from such experience. A genuine Satanist, for example, confronted by an entity which exhibited all the powers attributed to Satan would not even accept what that 'entity' said and would most certainly not show any submission -instead, they would a defiance, a reasoned assessment of what was said, and then a judgement made from experience. A Satanist never surrenders to anything -and would rather die, proud and defiant, than submit. This applies even to 'Satan'. If and when a Satanist accepts guidance, it is from someone of experience who has explicated Satanism by their life and thus who can offer advice based on that experience. The aim of Satanism is to create willful, characterful, defiant, unique individuals who have or can fulfil their potential as gods ­it is not to create followers or sycophants. An 'infernal mandate' implies sycophancy. c} Satanism does not involve discussions, meetings, talks. Rather, it involves action, deeds. Words -written or spoken -sometimes follow, but not necessarily. The ideal candidate for Satanism is the individual of action rather than the 'intellectual'. By th~ nature of most Satanic actions, they can seldom be mentioned and thus remain esoteric. The essence that Satanism leads the individual towards, via action, is only ever revealed by that participation which action is. Words, whether written or spoken, can never describe that essence ­they can only hint at it, point toward it, and often serve to obscure the essence. Satanism strips away the appearence of 'things' -living, Occult and otherwise by this insistence on experience, unaided. What is thus apprehended by such experience, is unique to each individual and thus is creative and evolutionary. Discussions, meetings, talks, even books and such like, de-vitalize: they are excuses for not acting. A Satanist will sometimes use such forms as he/she may use the form of a Temple -to enhance and/or provoke experiences. But they are then actively manipulating, actively creating experiences -the others involved are being used by that person. That is, there is only one Satanist at such gatherings (usually) -the others may believe they are 'Satanists', but they are deluded."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"J J ] ] -l ---d) Satanism does not apply moral absolutes to real-life situations and forms. This may best be explicated by two examples. First, politics. Satanism does not affirm or deny any political forms or type of politics ­it does not, for example, announce that 'fascism and Satanism are incompatable'. Such announcements/pronouncements arise from a moral bias and a lack of insight into both Satanism and 'society' and thus'Aeonics. A Satanist, concerned with experience, may use a political form for a specific purpose -the nature of that form in terms of conventional politics and morality (such as 'extreme Right-wing') is irrelevant. What is important is whether it can be used to (a) provide experience of living and the limits of experience, and/or (b) aid the sinister dialectic of history. Thus a Satanist may become involved in, or set up, an organization of the extreme Right -this is dangerous, exciting, vitalizes, provides experiences 'on the edge' and should thus aid the development of the character and insight of that Satanist*. What is important, is that this involvement is done for an ulterior, Satanic, motive: what others think and believe about such actions is totally irrelevant. Anyone purporting to be a Satanist who criticizes such an action, whatever the political hue of the group/organization, reveals by that criticism that they are not Satanists -but rather, moralizing nurds lacking in insight and real Satanic understanding. The second example concerns the formation and use of Satanic 'Temples' and groups by a Satanist. A Satanic novice, in order to gain experience of magickal rituals and people manipulation, usually forms a group to perform Satanic rituals. The people recruited are for the most part used -and the novice often assumes a specific Satanic 'role' for this: the role of sorcerer/sorceress. Be/she may dress in a certain way and so on, as he/she may use fables to impress and/or manipulate. This, however, for a genuine Satanist, is only a stage -and one which lasts a year or two. After that, experience and mastery of ceremonial and hermetic magick gained, they move on to new challenges and experiences, as all good Satanists should. Further, the individuals of this 'Temple' or group are not Satanists, although they may believe themselves to be -they are simply being used to afford the novice pleasure/excitement/experience and so on. Bad any of the any Satanic character or potential, they would rebel to undertake their own quest by forming such a group/'Temple' and experience the limits of themselves. Sometimes, the group has another aim -an Aeonic or suprapersonal one, in whict case its life may be extended. But whatever, genuine Satanic guidance by an Adept or Master/Mistress to a novice always occurs on an individualized basis, never within the rigid and constraining form of a 'Temple'. Thus, there is not nor can be any constraining rules applied to the conduct of such 'Temples' and groups -there is no 'moral code', no bounds which cannot be overstepped. The rules, such as they are, are made by the Satanic novice according to their desire and goals. That is, they can do with that group and its individuals whatever they desire to do and no one -not even the Adept/ Master/Mistress who may be guiding them -can set limits or prescribe their behaviour. They must learn for themselves -and from their mistakes, should they make some. This naturally leads to the obvious Satanic deduction that a group like the Temple of Set may contain one, perhaps two, Satanists -who are using the 'members' for their own Satanic goals. This person (or persons) would of course deny this, and if that denial was sincere, they could not be Satanists. What is certain, is that that group cannot contain more than perhaps two Satanists -for the members accept the constraints imposed upon them from above, and are servile, in both theory and practice. They are also not being led into real experiences, but accept a sterile, sanitized and safe 'Satanism' as pedalled by their leader. * It can also aid the sinister dialectic -here, an understanding of Aeonics is important."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"e) Satanism does not seek any form of official recognition as it does not seek to become respectable or the prerogative of a majority. Rather, Satanism operates, and must operate, for the most part in a clandestine or 'underground' manner.j 'Official' recognition mean SOmeone or some organization is granted some sort of \"status\" and thus assumes both in theory and in fact an 'authority' and an organizational structure to support it.

This danger is much more than just a 'mental' or a psychic one of the kind sometimes experienced in magickal workings. It is a personal danger of the 'life or death' kind. If it is not, then it is not tough enough, it is not Satanic. For far too long the]\t pathetic imitation Satanists, such as those in the Temple of Set and the Church of Satan, have had no one to contradict their sickly, wimpish versions of Satanism -they have tried to deny the darkness and evil which arel\t~ssential to Satanism because the frauds in those organizations are fundamentally ~ weak: they have never gone to their limits, never experienced the realness of evil. They have tried to make 'Satanism' safe and 'respectable': they have intellectualized it because they are typical products of this presentl intellectualized, peace-loving, \"we need to be safe\" society. A Satanist is like a beast of prey -in real life, not in fantasy. A Satanist may be and often is an assassin, a warrior, an outlaw -in real life.1 IThe imitation Satanists, however, pretend to be these things -their• fantasy-life is greater than their real experiences of such things. A Satanist seeks and makes real his/her fantasies and then masters the real-life situations and all those desires/feelings which give birth to those fantasies -they live them and then transcend them, creating from those experiences something beyond them: a new individual. Often, things go wrong -but as always in life, the strong survive and the weak perish, are written off. The Satanist creates the dreams, standards of excellence and spirit which others often later aspire to emulate. This creation is in real life, by deeds and deeds alone. Because of this, few indeed are the genuine Satanists. Sometimes their lives (or aspects of them) become public -but often they are hidden, working their darkness in secret, for the benefit of evolution . • ONA 1991 eh"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"1\t The Publication of Esoteric Traditions on the Left Hand Path 1 For a long time, genuine esoteric tradition was handed on on an individual basis, from Master/Mistress to novice. There were many reasons for this, most of them practical: the tradition was esoteric, liable to mis-interpretation, and many of its tenets and rituals involved what would have been regarded as 'heretical', anti-social and/or illegal acts. Furthermore, the methods used to train novices often made those novices into 'outlaws' and set them against conventional society. Also, for a long time, the teaching and teachings of the tradition was heretical in Law - a criminal offense against Church and State. Secrecy was essential and necessary.] This state of affairs pertained until quite recently. With the burgeoning of interest in 'the Occult' in general, the LHP became somewhat less secret and certain aspects of the tradition were discreetly circulated. What were ~ , mistakenly taken to be 'esoteric' traditions and, given the new openess J toward the Occult and the repeal of anti-Occult laws, freely distributed and/or published, were (a) the useless Grimoire/Qabalistic tradition, or (b) a mis-interpreted Crowleyism, or (c) of a showman/ghoulish/self-professed]\t type with bits cobbled together from (a) and (b) with archaic myths and unenlightened egoism thrown in.

The later schism which gave birth to the Temple of Set (born not with a bang but with a whimper) was not unexpected given the structure and orientation of]\t this 'Church' -and neither was the fact that the leader of this schism based his Temple and authority on what was termed an 'Infernal Mandate', and declared Satanism as a religion , much mis-understood.] Meanwhile, the old traditions continued, in Europe and elsewhere, in their traditional way -secretly, accepting but few novices and these only after severe tests and ordeals. The traditions, writings, rituals, methods, ordeals and ! techniques remained unavailable except to those few. After lengthy deliberations j and consultations, the individual representing traditional groups, decided to gradually make the esoteric tradition which he and others represented available on a selective basis, to reveal, for once and for all, what the LHP and Satanism were really about. The real impetus for this decision came from Aeonic strategy -making the tradition available would enable an increase in the number of genuine Adepts, thus hastening the presencing of the darker forces on Earth, and so fulfilling the sinister dialectic of history. This increase, however, would be gradual -over centuries. ] With this dissemination, the purpose, intent and methods of Satanism and the LHP could no longer be mis-interpreted and the posers and charlatans who professed to be 'Satanists' would be exposed -at least to those with any sagacity. With the secrets accessable to those who saught to find them, the real esoteric work could continue, as it always had, in secret -the training, via direct experience, of those few strong and gifted enough to undertake the difficult and dangerous journey along the Left Hand Path.

To facilitate these changes, spare sets of pieces are kept (usually two full sets) beside the structure. An alternative method is to make each piece from a cube of wood or other material and paint symbols on each side of the cube, the symbol/piece in play being the one uppermost.J\t Thus, for example, a cube would be marked with symbols which follow in the sequence enabling, when a move is made, the cube to be rotated to show the new symbol/piece. A spare set (or sets) are also kept, for when the cube-symbols are 'exhausted' and the cube needs changing. Thus, a cube might have the following symbols painted on its side: Bee); e(':!); e(~); tce): ~(~)i 'l(~)-\twhile another would have: 'ri). <10 i\\. ,\\ \\() e (0\\!F(e)j ~(:t::-. jr (~.Ji ece./j e(\\t i +:J ]\t ••• • In the transformation sequence (ere) -;> &( l)-'> e(~) -') 't.-(e) ~ !('l)~£J~'-:' {F(e)-7 f=JC'!)->J f:(!f:') the arrow -> represents -a single transJormation.

For example, if it-is being used to simply try and comprehend the connections/ wholeness of the Earth/individual system (in ordinary magickal terms, Seasonal influences/patterns whereJ\t Seasonal means. the flow from Spring to Summer to Autumn to Winter). then the starting point is the part of the season ... pertaining at that time.

This random selection is done by a process determined before the game starts by the player or players: the most favoured method being to choose, without looking, £rom the spare pieces.

To facilitate the random choice, a complete spare set of pieces is \"kept for this specific purpose and these pieces are used for this purpose only.

Thus, received tradition gave the origin of the Hyperborean Aeon as between 7,000 to 6,000 Be (that is, \" nine to eight millenia before the present\" -this 'present' being c. 1975 ev).J\t Also, the 'Primal Aeon' was given as arising between eleven to ten mil~enia ago. This placed the origin of the Hyperborian civilization (Albion) at around 6,000 orJ 5,000 BC, and thus dated Stonehenge to between 4,500 and 3,500 (the 'later' date -3,500 -being favoured). After a thorough study of these received traditions, and alreview of present archaeological/historical understanding,..... the present writer decided the traditional dates were out by at least a thousand years. When the Order MSS were written (mostly after 1975 ev) to consolidate what had been -apart] from a few MSS such as the 'Black Book' - a mostly oral tradition/teaching, these \"new\" dates were included. -However, the present writer admits that this revision maylwell be mistaken, and that the 'traditional' dates may yet be proved correct. ] i.. It is to be hoped that some time in the future further evidence for the civilization of Albion will be found, particuarly in regard to accurate dating and the confirmation of esoteric tradition concerning the sea-faring nature of the communities (particuarly the links with Iceland/ Greenland/ Canada and the later migrations southward: Greece etc.), the technological advances made and so on. While some evidence for the 'advanced' agriculture of the later period is emerging (e.g. the 'Butzer' Farm project) and the astronomical nature of Stonehenge is now well-established, there is still the view of Albion during the period in question as a rather basic 'Neolithic' semi-nomadic society, rather 'backward' in comparison with the \"civilized\" societies of Sumeria and Egypt. The acceptance of this view is not surprising, given the paucity of eVidence, the lack of archaeological excavation and an almost total lack of \"professional\" interest. Part of the lack of evidence stems from the fact that a lot of the sites have been almost continually inhabited/cultivated with the consequential loss of material/patterns; another is the use of wood in the construction of artifacts -this is rarely preserved and there has been a rather silly tendency to use pottery remains (its 'sophistication' etc.) to judge/date the communities associated with it, whereas in fact at the time pottery was probably considered an inferior material to wood/leather etc. Another stems from a lack of written records -in Egypt, Sumeria and elsewhere there are well-preserved reminders."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"1\t Notes on Rituals -II Forms & Rituals:l The 'Forms' (see the \"Musick, Incense and Forms\" chart] may be used to enhance magickal workings in two ways:]\t 1) The Form may actually be constructed to form the 'inner part' of a Temple (or the whole Temple itself) and the working undertaken within this -with an intent, or desire,]\t appropriate to the sphere associated with that Form. Thus, a tetrahedron shaped 'inner sanctum' would be for Mercury workings: i.e. workings concerned with 'indulgence and transformations' [qv. the tables in 'Naos' and elsewhere]] while a pyramid would be appropriate for Ecstasy and Love. The working may be further enhanced by constructing the Form in the appropriate material.] -2) The Form may be constructed in the material (see table] I on a small scale and this itself may be used in two ways: a) As a focus for vibration/chant -using the appropriate chant for the sphere concerned (qv. 'Naos']. Thus, for Mercury, the tetrahedron would be associated with the] \"Agios Lucifer\" chant*. The vibration appropriate to this sphere would be \"Satan\"/\"Satanas\". ] b) The Form may be used to store/concentrate the magickal energy of a ritual associated with a particular sphere/working by visualization and chant.] The energy, brought by a working will be 'cast into' the Form and visualized as being amplified by that Form. It may then be dispersed, according to desire. (Note: this 'visualization' is what acutally occurs to the energy becauseJ\t of the structure of the Form.] Incenses: The incenses given in 'Naos' for pathworkings are appropriate to those workings and the visualizations of the1• spheres (the Tarot images etc.).

The ~ incense for a particular sphere may be used for any type of working.

Further, to 'find' an Earth Gate (as in establishing the ~ •lmagickal centre of a new Aeon) the sequence would be begun to end at the 'Earth Gate'. This sequence of pathways may be used in two ways:J\t 1)as a prelude by the chief celebrants[e.g. in a Nine Angles working] who 'invokes the energies' appropriate to the particular pathway before the Rite proper: the first is] begun eight days before the Rite. Thus, for a Nine Angles rite, the celebrants would be the Priest and Priestess ­for a 'Dark Gate' ritual (i.e. 'chthonic Nine Angles' working) this would mean beginning at the 'Earth Gate' (the site chosen for the ritual) and invoking on the pathway toward the sphere of Mars [hint: construct a three-dimensional Tree of Wyrd showing the connecting pathways(qv. the Order MS 'the Septenary System' in \"Azoth\") and overlay this with the 'Nine Angles and the pathways' (Earth Gate to Dark Gate for this particular ritual)and the forces involved in this pathway (Earth Gate to Mars) will be clear: as will the symbolism etc. to be employed]. The second invokation on the second night (in this particular rite at the same location) would be Mars to Star Gate, and so on.

The 'intent' of this working may be either: the obtaining of knowledge [as for instance in finding an 'Earth Gate' -or in using the pathways to bring 'self-knowledge'/expansion of consciousness into acausal realms], or with a specific intent appropriate to the 'final point' (sphere or 'angle') where the pathways end.

It also signifies a type of portable shrine wherein an image of a deity was kept. It is, as a word, in common usuage in Egyptian archaeology. In the Occult sense -i.e. as used in the septenary tradition ­it is used to describe both an outer form which holds an inner meaning [e.g. an esoteric book] as well as a physical inner Temple or sanctuary.

In the exoteric sense, Falcifer (the 'reaper') and Vindex (the 'avenger') are esoteric names for the anti-Nazarene mentioned in \"Revelation\" and elsewhere. Vindex can be 'created' by sinister ritual -the chthonic Nine Angles rite when the energy is channelled by visualization and chant into a designated person.

The wyrd of the aeon is often expressed by a symbol/word/ magickal working (e.g. the Hellenic: Eagle/oracle; dance) ­although these are merely outward expressions of the inner essence. The destiny of the associated civilization is most often expressed by an ethos/myth (e.g. for the West: Science/ Exploration) and is expressed via various archetypes, some of which may directly relate to the ethos. An aeon is essentially an ordered manifestation of acausal energy in the causal via an earth-based nexion: this nexion being the 'magickal ·centre' of the Aeon (and thus the civilization). Various cults and their associated mythos are derived from this centre and its energy. For previous Aeons, this ordering was for the most part intuitive and unconscious -i.e. not arising from deliberate magickal acts by Adepts: the finding and opening of a nexion occurred by the very nature of that acausal energy seeking to 'earth' itself. Aeonic change is now understood and gives all Adepts the possibility of creating Aeonic changes. A civilization undergoes an organic process of growth and decay and symbolically it has nine stages, represented by the pieces of the Star Game. (Note: the Star Game -particuarly the Advanced Star Game -gives a complete representation of one Aeon and its civilization if the pieces are placed correctly.) A civilization generally lasts between 1,500 and 1,700 years. From its origin, its takes about 800 years for a civilization to enter its Time of Wars (aka Time of Troubles) and this period of wars lasts on average 398 to 400 years. It is followed by the Imperial stage -Empire or Imperium (aka 'Universal State'). This lasts about 390 years after which the civilization finally falls. The gradual decline of a civilization follows the wane of the magickal energy associated with it -the archetypal forms which presenced this have fulfilled their potential, become exhausted of energy. (Note: the Star Game can be used to show how a particular archetypal form grows and decays, causing changes: e.g. the pieces of one board may be used to designate that archetype -by following the changes of the pieces and the affects on other boards, the principles of change may be seen. )"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"-JW::J~;~:~t~~~ ~ +~~ .:-;:j_::;:~ '~'r ;:0 .. <::;:' ..::E=-::::' J.-.. _c;~._~~.:~~~~.~· .... /_.:;:.:. =f .... :~;~::j;:.:::::~ :::~~:3.::::.

This usually implies having passed the Abyss -but some 'lesser' Aeonic magick can be undertaken by Internal., Adepts. This is so because if latent archetypal energy is present within the psyche of the individual, there will be a blocking/internal distortion of the acausal energy released/created via aeonic rites, and this usually leads-to problems: e.g. psychic distortion, physical problems and so on. Aeonic magick implies, ~or most rites, the individual being a 'channel' or 'gate'. Psychic residues imply a blocking. Archetypes imply a development in time -i.e. causal movement. Put simply, this means 'action' -or a 'story': some role played out by the image and thus fulfilled. In the 'cultic' sense, there is a 'legend'/goal. New images require new motifs: i.e. new forms of fulfilment • 'Mimesis' is one method of aeonic magick that has come down over the centuries (indeed, it was once probably the only means available).1 Basically, this involves imitating some aspect of cosmic/ Earth-based movement/working, and then either ~ollowing the natural pattern or slightly altering that pattern to bring about a subtle change. (This 'alteration' forms the basis for 'black' magick -qv. The Black Hass: the use o~ Nazarene formulae, slightly distorted via sinister intent.) Often, this implies 'acting out' an archetypal role according to a myth/legend/cult. The key here is the identification of the magickian with the role (which is, however, not a possession, as in shamanism) -this requires preparation. This 'acting out' can involve others -'as, for example, in a 'sacred marriage' (qv. 'SUD' and 'moon' as symbols). The intent of the working is then visualized/ chanted. If alterations aredesired, these are incorporated. Mimesis can also be done via the construction of suitable models which are symbolically imbued with 'life'. It may also be done via a 'play/drama' whose participants are unaware of the intent and/or of the symbolism.

This structure can be religious, social, political, business and so on; or (b) drawn £orth via ritual(s) andJ left to disperse (ie. there is no speci£ic intent/aim) according to its nature.

Most aeQnic rites by their nature imply a element o£ random energy which produces £urther change at £irst roughly in accord with the energy/intent o£ the rite: as causal time £lowsJ\t on, the original £orms are re-£ormed via metamorphosis. 5) Any change is possible using aeonic energies -ie. such energies and their use are a-moral. It is t~'e consciousness o£]\t the Adept which via intent directs the energy into speciCic £orms to provoke temporal changes in line with that intent. 6) Changes against an existing wyrd (and such like) require more energy because the 'old' archetypal £orms/patterns need] to be broken down/redirected.

The same applies to re-inforcements of the rite (should these be necessary). 2) Wyrd of present Western aeon is Imperium. This implies what is moralistically called an un-democratic State. One aim of such a state would be colonization of the Solar System and then the stars. In essence, this State would be an outward manifestation of Satanic spirit. Politcal forms to achieve and maintain this Imperium are only a means and must be seen by Adepts in this light. The same applies to 'military' forms. If an Adept or Adepts wish to achieve this wyrd then practical Corms to bring this change must be created/encouraged (magickally) (this applies of course to all aeonic changes). The choice of such forms is made on the basis of practicality, necessity and energies required: it is usually the result of a logical assessment oC eXisting conditions and future possibilities -amoral in essence. An attempt was made by various LHP Adepts earlier this century to use a political form to create a type of Satanic empire on the practical level with the aim of achieving the wyrd of the West. This involved disrupting Nazarene/Magian Corms/ethics/ideas and so on both magickally and on the practical/political level. This attempt was a partial success insofar as it has created a new 'mythos' -there is also archetypal energy stored (and awaiting further use) as well as a nexion now partially open. These offer Adepts the possibility of continuing this work ­perhaps via the same (or very similar) political forms, perhaps by other (7 contradictory) political forms. It is up to each Adept to make their own assessment -and to decide whether they wish the success or no of this wyrd. 3) It cannot be stressed too often that aeonic magick imnlies long-term assessment (from several centuries to millenia) and this time-scale of necessity negates the relative moral values that pertain in a society for perhaps a few decades or centuries. Aeonic insight implies an overview of not only the Aeon in which the Adept has his/her being, but also of previous Aeons and future Aeons. The basis of insight is a rational apprehension of Aeonic energies and ho~ those are made manifest (produce changes) via civilizations and how those civilizations (in their ethos etc.) affect individuals within them. Further understanding comes from magickal experience: how aeonic change is, magickally, possible. The most comprehensive means of understanding Aeonic energies is the advanced form of the Star Game. The essence of the Adept is this Aeonic insight -the breaking free from the bonds (archetypal forms and thus their unconscious/ conscious influence) of the Aeon in which the Adept has his/her being. Further, the bonds of past influences (of previous Aeons) must be transcended also -most who follow or attempt to follow an Occult way fall into the trap of shedding current Aeonic influences only to fall prey to past ones (Egyptian, Sumerian, Greek etc.·) or to be possessed by one 'Idea'/mythos. 4) Present Aeon is dying -its energies are on the wane. Thus time is right to produce aonic changes/find new nexions. ·qv 'Temple of Set' l"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"J J J ] ] ] ] .. ] ] ] ] J Aeonic magick is concerned with two things: (1) understanding the fundamental principles of how certain types of magickal energy (existing in the acausal) manifests and may be made manifest in the causal; and how those energies when so manifest produce temporal change; (2) actually using such energies -via rites etc. ­to bring such change in accord with one's desire or goal. (1) implies learning about aeons and civilizations -how both are formed, live, decay and change via acausal energies -and about how those within them, from individuals upward, are changed and manipulated by the various forms the acausal energies assume. Among such forms are ;chetypes, myths and mythos, ideas, symbols (including artistic r/presentations), as well as the more transient types like politics and religion. (2) implies learning the skills of aeonic magick and follows after (1). The basic skills are aeonic rites (eg. the Nine Angles rites; Ceremony of Recalling), the Star Game, and creative manipulation of symbols, ideas and so on (inclUding the more transient forms). (1) is covered in the many and varied Order MSS dealing with Aeonics and details of the basic skills are given in 'Naos', 'Black Book' and the various rituals (most now available in various publications). This present MS will deal with an area not specifically covered before with a view to dispelling some misconceptions. Sinister aeonic magick implies actual use of the energies ­by individuals -bringing change(s) to the 'real' or temporal world. This use is often misunderstood by non-Adepts of sinister traditions, and particuarly by those who adhere to the old distorted magic(k)al systems. For instance, aeonic magick was used earlier this century to aid a new political form and so try and alter in a significant way the direction of the Western civilization in order to bring about certain futures. These futures (the plural is intentional) would, if they had resulted, have led to the expansion of both a technological and thence an individual kind over a period of many centuries -and this because of the dynamic nature of the form chosen as well as the future transformation of it, via dialectic and internal metasomatosis. The most identifiable manifestation (ie. causal appearence) of this form was National-Socialist Germany. However, most individuals who consider this form, consider it not from an aeonic standpoint but rather from a limited, causal and 'moral' point of view - a view they take, also, of more recent attempts by other individuals and groups, to use that and similar forms for magickal ends. The persepctive of this view is immediate rather than of centuries and millenia and shows a fundamental lack of understanding of not only aeonics but \"also magick itself. The reality is that all significant magick is either Aeonic or ~nternal: External magick is but a child's game, to be played while learning the most basic skills of magick, or for amusement, perhaps, later on. To a real magickian, all types of political (as well as religious and cultural) forms are means -~o be used if they are useful for aeonic or internal magickal goalso Genuine Adepts use many temporal forms -although they never identify with them in the sense of adhere to them causally: from a psychic perspective. In the initial stages of the seven-fold way, for example, some \"roles\" may be assumed by the Initiate to bring insight, challenges and generally experience the 'forbidden', the contrary, the 'heretical'. But these roles are only that -part of an internal, psychic and thus sinister manipulation of forms.

Thus, those who criticize those LHP individuals and/or groups who do and have used political forms in the past -or some other temporal form: social, religious or ideological -clearly I\t show by that very criticism and their subsequent \"labelling\" of those individuals and groups (from their own myopic and relative \"political\" or \"social\" perspective) that they lack not only-\tunderstanding but also insight into the basics of magick. InJ\t short, these \"labellers\" expose themselves as not only unworthy of being called magickians, but also as adherents to the old, Nazarene dominated moral value-systems. Their lack of perspective,I\tand magickal understanding is not, however, unexpected considering-the pathetic state of 'magical understanding' prior to the dissemination of ONA teachings -particuarly relating to Aeonics and Internal magick.] On the individual level -of Initiates -the LHP is decidedly a-political, a-religious and a-social ( where the \"a\" prefix means \"beyond\", \"outside\"), and is devoted to making each Initiate unique: that is, aiding them fulfil their potential, ....\t thus enhancing evolution and creating the next stage of our !\t evolution. The ultimate aim of sinister aeonic magick is to create conditions in the 'real world' such that Initiation and Adeptship and all that these imply in terms of evolutionary understanding and insight, is not only available for all, butJ\t fulfilled. This, of course, is and will be a long-term aim:­perhaps achieved by the end of the next Aeon, perhaps not. But the aeonic magick of anyone present moment (eg. a rite orJ\t form manipulation) aims to presence a part of that future in that present moment or create conditions enabling it. Thus, change is provoked and-;ade possible -in individuals, groups and civilizations. Hence the complexity of aeonics, and the multitude of temporal forms used -but also its simplicity. For, viewed causally and simply, aeonics is change, opposition, creation; l\t provoking challenges and insight~ counter-balancing and adversarial. In short - a dialectic, for individuals, groups and civilizations, as well as aeons. And it is this dialectic which is the 'numen' of sinister magick -its ultimate meaning and its ultimate challenge. Quite simply, it is for those who aspire. The rest can continue their crawling non-existence. Naturally, in aeonic magick some mistakes have been made -some jUdgements have been shown by events to be incorrect.

Esoterically, one aspect of the distortion is represented by the 'qabala'. Both of these are manifestations of what it is convenient to call the 'Magian ethos': that is, an approach to living, a way of thinking/being. One of the external manifestations of this ethos is the 'Babylonian Talmud' and the religion whose codes/teaching are represented by that collection of tracts. Another is the 'Old Testament'. This ethos has, over the last few centuries, become diversified, and now assumes various political and 'philosophical' manifestations. The \"sickness of the spirit\", which Nietzsche analysed in many of his works [particuarly the 'Anti-Christ' l. has changed the direction of the Western civilization [see 'Notes on Esoteric Tradition' and other MSS] and thus its future: Had there been no distortion of the Western 'current' or 'magickal energy' then the Western civilization would now be about to enter the final, Imperial, stage. There would be an outward expansion, led by the elite, firstly world-wide and then, using the technology which is such a feature of the true Western ethos, into outer Space itself with the consequent colonization of the solar system and star systems beyond. This Imperial stage is 'Promethean' or Luciferian in aspect -that is, it is dynamic and expresses that zest for liVing which is pagan [and which, esoterically, is the essence of genuine Satanism]. It is in one sense the dominence of 'action' over thought ­the triumph of 'master-morality'. Esoterically, this is and always has been for all 'higher civilizations' the triumph of honour and those who uphold this most elitist of concepts. [This is so because of the nature of the 'acausal energy' which, \"seeps through a Gate\" at the beginning of each Aeon. Exoterically, this energy is 'sinister/Satanic' as these terms are understood by the Order (qv. 'The Dark Forces'*). It is this energy which 'creates' the civilization -or rather, the civilization is an outward embodiment of that energy, and this impetus to civilization is maintain by the 'elan'/spirit of the creative minority who are (mostly unconsciously) gUided by a feeling of Destiny which itself arises from such energy and which is often enshrined in a mythos/legend. Adepts are those who understand this, and who can thus work with the energy as that energy is embodied at that moment in time. In the past, this understanding was often intuitive -only in the last century or so has this understanding become rationalized, and thus allowed an even greater degree of understanding (and consequently manipulation of the energies).] However, the Western civilization, having been distorted in its ethos, is suffering from a sickness of spirit -an infection. Instead of almost entering the stage of Imperium, it is increasingly inward-turning, increasingly concerned with ideas that are \"alien\" to it -that is, which do not arise from its own ethos. It has been, in effect, unconsciously given a dream and is now striving to live that dream although that dream means its own death. [As with all Aeonics, there is no judgement here -merely a statement of facts. All Adepts must discover for themselves whether they wish to alter the futures which can arise from these facts:and alter according to their own desires.] In practical terms: the distortion is evident in the political ideas of Marxism/communism, in the economic idea of capitalism and in the sociological ideas/value-systems which preach 'equality'. The first and *Published in 'Fenrir' no. 4 [ONote: This MS contains a brief outline only of one particular aspect. To be supplemented by oral teaching.]"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"third of these derive from Nazarene beliefs -there are, in effect, extensions of the Nazarene spirit: the triumph of the 'slave-morality'. The second, when analysed, takes the abstraction evident in an aspect of the 'Magian ethos' stages further. What all this amounts to on the level of effects is that individuals [and this applies particuarly to the creative minority] are:(a) concerned by a 'morbid conscience' and are thus unable to act with spirit/elan, think and act on the basis of reality (esoterically, read 'they act like sinners and penitents rather than Satanists'); and (b) they perceive tlle world/other individuals via the distorting lenses of abstract ideas -these ideas deriving from the distortion. Magickally, individuals have lost contact with the genuine archetypes of their unconscious. Even worse, the 'magic' whichpurports to return these archetypal energies does the opposite -it gives experience of the 'archetypes of the distortion'. This 'magic' is that based on, and derived from, the qabala and the 'Grimoires' of the Middle Ages. [This includes Crowley. 'Wicca' would be one way forward were it not so lacking in Promethean zest -that is, lacking the spirit of true paganism (qv. the Vikings).] For the Western civilization, one of the most powerful archetypes is the Warrior. [Note: Adepts are those striving to free themselves from archetypal influence. Part of this involves living the archetypal role of 'Mage' ••• We are concerned here with the majority who are swayed by archetypes without understanding them.] This Warrior has two aspects, both important vis-a-vis the Western ethos. One is the 'Hero' (where there can be sacrifice of self to the good of the folk); ~he other is 'Conquerer'. In simple terms, the West should now be exalting the archetype of the Warrior: it should be a goal aspired to, and the Institutions and so on of the societies of the West should represent this striving to emulate the Hero/Conquerer -and all for the benefit, not of some artificial idea like 'equality' or 'democracy', but for the communities of the West and the individual who strives to become a Hero/Conquerer. This latter point is vital to an understanding of the present -and thus the future. To take an example from history (a valid one, since all higher civilizations have the same form): The West should now be entering the stage that the Hellenic civilization entered with the Roman Empire at the time of Augustus. In the Rome of that time, the Hero/Conquerer was an ideal aspired to -for the benefit of Rome and those citizens who could profit by emulating that ideal. The Warrior was honoured, and warrior values held sway, giving a zest to life, and expansion for the Empire. This emulation/exaltation of the Warrior archetype by the majority creates the final, zestful, stage of the West (or rather, should have created it) -the strong, the daring, the noble are encouraged and rewarded. The benefit is Empire: for the West this would have been a 'Galactic Empire'. This means that the societies are imbued with the 'Promethean' spirit (or 'acausal/sinsiter' energies).[Aeonically, Adepts have three functions: 1) their own Destiny (which may be to try and become an 'Immortal'; 2)to aid by magick the Destiny of the civilization to which they belong; 3) or to change that Destiny according to their desire. Which of these, they know, in time ••• None of these can be attained without an understanding of that present in which they find themselves: as that present is.] In practice , the Western Empire would have meant the dominence by a racially aware community/nation/federation of first the West and then possibly the world -this giving rise to the foundation of colonies in Space and the expansion of the Empire into other Star systems. It would have been 'racially aware' (that is, basically European in race) because archetypes compel this type of cohesiveness: that is, 'Destiny' in the case of a civilization implies a commanality, a sense of belonging, or 'rootedness'. This makes possible 'thinking with the blood' -that is, genuine 'elan' -and thus an advance/conquest. Where this elitist attitude"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"does not eXi~t, there can be no lasting conquest, and thus no Empire. For the West, this Empire should have begun around 1996-2011 ev and lasted until about 2390 ev after which it, like all Empires, would fall. But then, the Destiny of the West would have been achieved, and with it the dispersal of acausal energy beyond the confines of the Earth. The whole purpose of the Western Aeon was to achieve this further expansion. [Note: There is no 'morality' involved here: just an understanding of magickal, aeonic, energies. The morality which would dismiss a Western Empire is basically Nazarene ••• ] With the fall of this Empire, the 'New Aeon' would assume practical form on the diversity of planets conquered and colonized. There would then be the 'Spring' of not one new civilization, but of many, with the consequent expansion of consciousness. However, what is occuring at present is an increase in the distortion ­that is, acausal energies are weakening, the Western civilization declining. [It must be borne in mind that although the energies of the 'New Aeon' are -or rather can be -emerging now, during the beginning of the 'Winter' stage of the present civilization, they have little effect on the practical level until the new Aeonic centre is found. What effects they do have is largely small and concerned with 'creating new archetypes': these new archetypes influencing things only gradually. It takes several centuries for large scale effects -and a new civilization (i.e. a further upward trend in consciousness) requires the channelling of acausal energy through a new gate as the 'old' one closes. According to tradition, the gate associated with the next Aeon is in outer Space. Hence, on one level, a need to ensure the fulfilment of the Destiny of the Western Aeon.] On the practical level, this decline means an inward-turning culture: an increase of 'appearence' -that is, a reliance, among individuals and societies, on abstract ideas and theories. There will be dominence by Nazarene beliefs and ideas deriving from them -a return to a 'religion'/ social system of living. [A desire to believe as against a desire to kno~/explore.] For the West, this will mean tyranny of the mind (and the body because restrictions on movement will exist) existing with a return to 'barbarism' in certain areas (in terms of 'lawlessness'/attitude to living) leading to a gradual decline and probably (after some hundreds of years) an extinction of the acausal on Earth. [In a simple sense, the acausal is evolution, of species and consciousness: the 'Opening of a Gate' (a new Aeon) an expansion due to the acausal presencing on Earth and within individuals.] Already, this tyranny of ideas exists -together with an increasing physical tyranny to destroy those who do not believe. This tyranny concerns those opinions which contradict in essence the Nazarene/Magian beliefs in 'equality' and 'inward turning morbidity'. [See the MSS 'Aeonics and Heresy'.] Exoterically,the distortion can be remedied by the arrival of the 'Anti-Christ'. Esoterically, the acausal, sinister, energies can be channelled by ritual into an individual/individuals to create Vindex. Vindex will then be the creater of the Western Empire [i.e. the 'Satanic Empire']. This is one way for Adepts of the sinister tradition to use Aeonic energies. [Note: What 'Vindex' and the 'Empire' means to others is different to what happens in aonic terms: the former is outward (i.e. 'moral') appearence, the latter, the essence or eonic 'effect'.] This magick is dangerous -because it draws upon those who practise it the 'magic' of those who have a vested interest in the forces of the distortion . .

The energy of \"S and its changes in causal time, can be described and thus 'expla~ned' by conventional scientific means, e.g. by Physics. The energy of fs and ~ts changes can be described by a new science which uses the non-spat~al geometry of the acausal and acausal time. An Aeon is a form or type of acausal energy which manifests in the causal -i.e. ~t has certain limits in both causal time and 3 dimensional space. It re-orders the causal -which is s~mply another way of saying such acausal energy produces certa~n changes in the causal. A civilizat~on [or rather a 'higher' or Aeonic civ~lizat~on] is how this form, th~s energy, is ordered in the causal -from a causal po~nt of view.

The 'aeon~c' aspect is the roots; the civilization aspect is the trunk; the soc~et~es w~th~n the civil~zat~on are the branches, and the ~ndiv~duals within a soc~ety are the tWigs and leaves.

Its energy, and thus ltS archetypes and so on, 1S determlned by the Aeon Wh1Ch 'creates' [or rather, causes its creatlon/manlfestation 1n causal space-t1me]. These energles, for both a clvillzatlon and an Aeon can be descr1bed in varlOUS ways. The most slmple (and not very accurate) is mythologlcal/archetypal. An Aeon lasts about 2,000 years of causal t1me. It lS linked to a partlcular geographlcal region, and there is a centre to thlS where the acausal energy lS strongest. ThlS is because an Aeon lS a physlcal presencing of acausal energy Vla a nexion -l.e. a nexus between the acausal and the causal. ThlS centre usually acquires a cult or rellglous nature: mostly unconsciously. That is, certaln indlvlduals are 'drawn to this area' and the acausal energy produces/ provokes changes wlthln and external to the psyche of these and other indlvlduals. The llst given below descr1bes the en~rgy of each Aeon which has existed ln mythologlcal/archetypal terms -it is gUide, rather than an exact descrlptlon of the energles, and a gUlde to the changes which are caused in the psyche. [The exact descrlptlon is purely abstract -in symbols -and is given later.] Each Aeon has a particular clvilizatlon associated with it. (See the llst.) Its energy may be expressed in terms of an 'ethos' -that is, how the;f; [where the symbol~; represents indivldual(s)] within that~~ [where the symbol means 'Clvlllzatlon'] apprehend both causally and acausally [or in simple terms, both ratlonally and intuitively] the acausal energy of the Aeon. This ethos, like a ~c ' grows and changes : it evolves. The clvillzations listed are 'higher' or Aeonic ones -those that have changed/ shaped conSClOUS evolutlon. Other clvilizations have existed, but they have generally not contributed significantly to such evolutlon in terms of creatlvlty -they are usually related, in time and space, to an already existlng or a prevlously eXlsting civilization. The criteria for an AeonlC Civllizatlon are: (a) lt possesses a dlstinctive ethos [Note: an ethos is not a 'rellglon' as rellglon lS conventlonally understood.]: (b) it arises primarily from a physlcal challenge [rather than from the disintegration of an exist1ng Civllizatlon(i.e. the challenge as such is soclal)]: (c) it is creative on a large scale. In analyslng civilizatlons and their changes, the work of Spengler and Toynbee lS valuable, although its details are not essent1al. What thelr work has done, lS to contribute some fundamental ideas about the nature and structure of Clvllizatlons -thelr detalled work (such as, in Toynbee's case, historlcal dates and events) adds flesh to the bones of the aeonic theory here propounded, but that theory is independant of such detail which may be and lndeed should be surpassed ln the future. The two most' fundamental ideas of these historlans are Spengler's one of the metamorphosls of what he terms a 'culture', and the genesls of clvilizatlons as glven by Toynbee -thelr origln, classlficatlon, lnter-relation and so on. The ldeas have been comblned with others -some origlnal, some not (some part of 'esoterlc tradition') -to provide the framework for aeonlc/acausal theory outlined here. ThlS framework is 'CI10logy' -the study of those processes WhlCh have caused historical change. The mechanlsm by WhlCh C1Vllizatlons affect evolutlon is that of 'creatlve lndlvlduals'. Most of these are lnfluenced by the ethos of thelr Clvlllzatlon to act, or to express that ethos more consclously, those causlng others to act. Few lndlvlduals in a Clvlllzatlon reach the stage of conscious evolutlon WhlCh frees them from the lnfluence of ethos -be such the ethos of thelr own Clvlllzatlon or that of another. Of course, many are there who belleve they are free of such lnfluence -but bellef lS not the same as reallty.

The same lS true for an Aeon. Such study enables two important thlngs. Flrst, 1t enables an objectlfication. In one sense, this is a withdrawlng of proJectlons (In Junglan terms). Second, it developes already_exlstlng facult1es and creates new ones -the ablilty to reason ln abstract symbollsm, for example, where the symbols are 'numlnous' (i.e. \"allve\") rather than belng slmply 'lntellectual'. That lS, such symbols relate to those things which are lmportant for an lndlvlduals life. fIn a slmple sense, the symbols of cliology are 1mbued wlth 'psychic energies' and thus posses 'power'. More correctly, the symbols re-present acausal energles as against causal ones such as in mathematlcs and phyS1CS.] The symbol1zation enables the patterns, on the levels of an Aeon, a civilizatlon and lndlvlduals, to be followed and manipulated if necessary. It enables 1nslght lnto Aeons, civilizations, individuals, and one's own self, and thus forms the essence of inner esoteric teaching. The symbolization, a~ the present time of writing, is of three klnds, two of WhlCh have been developed quite recently. The first kind lS the mythologlcal/ archetypal -the use of myths/archetypes and such like forms to describe/ represent the processes and patterns. Such representations are traditional, and stlll useful, partlcuarly in the early stages of study. [One type of thlS Klnd of representation is the septenary Tree of Wyrd wlth each sphere belng assoclated wlth various archetypes/myhtologlcal forms and so on.] The second Klnd, is The Star Game - a collocation of abstract symbols WhlCh re-present the acausal as it manlfests ln the causal, these symbols, as mentloned above, belng numlnous ones. The thlrd type, the rudiments of which are described in the Second and Thlrd Parts of thlS present work, is a formalized abstract system WhlCh represents the beglnnlngs of a new SClence. The first and second types are complete. The third type has only begun to be developed -the next few centurles should see thlS new SC1ence complete in most of its essentlals. The mastery of the first type of symbolization is relatively easy. The mastery of The Star Game (in both/septenary and Advanced versions) takes qUite an lntellectual effort, stretchlng the frontiers of conSClOUS evolutlon. The understanding of the third type, takes conscious evolutlon still further. The completlon of this third type will stretch the frontiers almost to thelr llmlts . All three kinds are genuine esoteric Arts . 000 II The Basic Symbolism Before proceeding to descrlbe the symbollsm of thlS thlrd type, some brlef remarks concernlng the symbollsm of The Star Game wlll be ln order. In The Star Game, Aeons may be symbollzed by the boards -l.e. the f1rst board (Slr1us) re-presents the flrst or Prlmal Aeon, the next board, the next Aeon, and so on. The plac1ng on the pleces on a board represents a partlcular stage of an Aeon -the in1tial placlng belng the pre-c1vlllzatlon stage of an Aeon. The movement of pleces then represents the evolutlon wlthin an aeon and its effect upon others. However, all seven boards can be used to represent just one Aeon. The same 1S true both for a C1vlllzatlon and an lndlvldual. Thus, ln the septenary verSlon for lnstance, the seven boards could be used to represent aspects of one Civlllzatlon frc 1tS genesls to its demise -the flrst SlX boards might be chosen to represent the causal changes, and the seventh, the acausal ones, thus:"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"--~~'f.. tJ y(~) '\" -\"\") \"­~(~) '¥rr) (X (f)_ \"­-') (lr:~) ( 1 ) \" -Ol(OL) In thls case, the last board is in 'acausal space' and thus has three causal aspects -Oc, t1~ y He~e~~)h:.;:~;)tr~~~~)~iOf(~) r~f(f5~d ~(:,) ~ t(~) ~ or;) -; T(~) However, another representatlon would be: -! r(~) -(2)T.c~.. )'J -f((1) -Ot:(~) O(OC) In (2) there lS no llnear (2/3 dlmenslonal) representation of causal time as there lS ln (1) [ the basic transformatlon is a linear representation of change]. That lS, in (2) there is no direct, linear sequence from one board to the next. Both representatlons are equally valid -they are merely different ways of vlewing the same thing, and this flexibility is inherent in The Star Game. This lS an important pOlnt WhlCh lS often overlooked -the only constants (or constraints) In/of the Star Game are the seven boards, each of a partlcular number of squares, the number and types of pieces, and the rules governing thelr movement. What the boards and symbols and moves re-present has to be determined before the game is used -when, that is, it is used esoterlcally, and not just as a 'game'.

Genuine Satanism -like all genuine magick -is a path, way or method of individual self-development. Rituals may be and often are a part of this, but these rituals all conform to certain patterns: they are all intended to aid and explicate self-understanding and development, as well as enhance and develope certain 'Occult' abilities. Naturally, some rituals and methods are concerned with the individual experiencing certain emotions and, in Satanism, enjoying certain pleasures. ~owever, because of the aim of Satanism [to aid the attainment by the individual of magickal and personal understanding and thus promote evolution and self-mastery], this experiencing involves a conscious choice or decision by the individual. This makes Satanism of necessity an adult path or way -for genuine Satanism, of the traditional type, is not concerned with proselytizing nor \"corrupting\" others without their consent. Its concern ­it must be repeated -is individual advancement arising from a conscious and free decision by the individual -anything else in not Satanic as it is not magickal. This free choice is part of all genuine Occult and magickal paths: Initiation means this free choice, the decision to begin an inner quest. When there is no free choice about the matter, there is no genuine Initiation -whatever path or way is being followed. Where Satanism differs, is in the aim, the philosophy of life and the techniques used to achieve the aim -these make it a \"Left Handed Path\" [when viewed conventionally] . Thus, there cannot be any such thing as 'childhood Initiation' -nor 1 this participation by children under a certain age in any genuine magickal rituals. What there can be: what there often is -in genuine Satanism at least ­is the simple dedication of infants by their parents to the darker path, and involves only the appointing of guardians to watch over and care for j J I• I• I• \\I• the child(ren) :\"Do you, so chosen, pledge to guard and watch over this newborn and to teach them when the teaching-time is right, our ways ... \" ~rom 'The Ceremony of Birth' in \"The Black Book of Satan\" (ONA)] The time for teaching is when the child, in accord with Satanic philosophy, can choose for themselve -sixteen years of age or thereafter -that is, when they have attained the threshold of adulthood. Hence, there is not, and cannot be, any such thing as \"Satanic\" child-abuse: there can be no child-hood 'initiation', no participation by children under a certain age in rituals, and no abuse, by adult Satanists,of children. This latter is important -Satanism is concerned with the individual gaining self-mastery and self-understanding. The abuser (whether of children, drugs or pleasures) is swayed by mostly unconscious desires and impulses -they may manipulate and try to control others who are susceptible, but they cannot control themselves, or even begin to understand their 'darker' side. In short, they are weak -and generally rather pathetic -individuals, although they may hide behind a \"mask\" or a \"role\". Such people are not Satanists, but rather failures. The Satanist aspires to self-mastery, self­overcoming; to knowledge ... The popular image of Satanism is a lie - a myth invented and fostered by those who have a vested interest in maintaining it.
