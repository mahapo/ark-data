As such, while complimenting the MSS contained in Volume I, they represent part of the 'inner core' of esoteric teachings.

The structure means that each new Initiate/member has one (at most two) Order contacts who channel information/teachings and so on, and who offer guidance/instruction. When this member reaches the stage of External Adept, they usually form their own Temple for ceremonial magick and for teaching, recruiting their own members, whose Order contact thus is that External Adept. Each Temple thus formed exists independantly. Hence, if it or any of its members are 'compromised', the chain cannot lead very far, enabling other members in other Temples to remain secret and so continue with their own work, both personal (following the path to Adeptship) and aeonic (aiding the sinister dialectic) . Further, such a structure is effective, because: it enables each member to progress at theiL own pace; it enshrines a fundamental principle of genuine Satanism [individuality,and freedom from subserviance to authority] and it enables practical experience of a character-building type [e.g. by organizing and running a Temple at an early stage]. Essentially, the Order is secret -and intends to remain so as far as most of its members and activities are concerned. However, its teachings and traditions have been and will continue to be made progressively more 'public', that is, available -thus enabling any individuals who may be interested to follow (if only in part) the way of genuine Satanism, for those individuals by so doing (however slightly) wi~l aid the sinister dialectic, increasing the dark forces presenced on Earth. Some of these may progress to the Order. This 'working secrecy' is necessary because Satanism cannot now be anything other than selective -it is elitist, being a hard and dangerous path, and part of its effectiveness lies in work of an 'underground', clandestine nature [e.g. some essential work is done by those involved in 'respectable' positions, which positions would no longer be available if the Satanic beliefs/practices of those involved in such work was generally known: i.e. they were discovered to be Satanists]. This secrecy will not change in the immediate future [for c. 20-30 years, that is] due to the nature of the societies in which we are forced to work. Satanism can never become (until the 'New Aeon' arrives at least) respectable: for to become so would destroy its numen, its viability as a way to genuine Adeptship. It is dark, evil -for the few who genuinely dare. This daring, as mentioned in other MSS, is practical, in real-life situations, involving danger, requiring courage, and defiance of both one's own limits and those of others, including the society of the moment. While society and other structures restrict and deny the promise of Satan, this dark defiance is required -and, moreover, required as a working system which achieves results, both personally and aeonically. What will change, is the number of individuals who can try this way to liberation -and while this will increase, it will do so only slowly over a period of decades. This will be a cumulative process which will aid (and indeed create) the next Aeon, the Satanic one when what is regarded now as dark and sinister will hold sway. Thus, it has been necessary to disseminate the teachings and traditions of the Order, and this dissemination will continue and increase, as part of sinister strategy. This part of sinister strategy was begun a decade ago by the Grand Master representing traditional groups. It was carefully planned and (so far) has been carefully executed. The initial stage involved circulating some details about traditional Satanism (the Septenary system; dark gods mythos) among some sections of the Occult fraternity. Thus, a few articles were published, and the existence"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"J J\t of the Order itself made known, for the first time outside traditionalist groupings, thus confirming certain rumours about such a group existing, such rumours having beep in circulation for some time. Over a number]\t of years, more information was made available -although still within the 'sub-culture' of the Occult underground. This attracted some interest (and a few Initiates -incidental to the main intent) and was followed by]\t the establishment of , at first, a newsletter, and then a \"zine\", both of these being of an 'underground' nature, both in terms of quality and the manner of distribution (i.e. selective, advertised in similar underground publications). Furthermore, the number of copies distributed]\t was kept low. The aim was two-fold -to create a sense of exclusivity (thus making the Order at first difficult to locate/find) and to pose no direct threat, that is, the zine and those associated with it would be seen] as totally on the fringe, without rescources and probably without any support. Thus, the activities of its members, always secret, would pose no threat and no investigation of any kind would be contemplated. Thus, both J of the aims mentioned above could be achieved -dissemination of the tradition, and preserving the secrecy necessary for valuable work to continue. After a few more years, the next step was taken -the distribution, again on a small scale, of works containing in detail the whole tradition. The]\t format of these works would be the same -of a kind to intimate only a small­scale enterprise. Thus were 'The Black Book of Satan', 'Naos', 'The Deofel Quartet' and other works made more accessable for the first time. Furthermore,] the scarcity of these works would create an 'aura' about them -an aura which hinted at the darkness of the tradition. This would be re-inforced by making available the most sinister aspects of the tradition -aspects which] would also contradict the meanderings of the armchair 'Satanists' who prattled on about Satanism being mis-understood and not really being evil, and who had increasingly come to notice as the decade came toward its end. Naturally, this would provoke a reaction -both from those within the]\t Occult and those without. The reaction from those within the Occult (and particuarly those who said they adhered to the Left Hand Path) would establish their own position, and thus their total mis-understanding and lack of real ] ] insight. In brief, they would continue their word-games and fantasy-roles when confronted by the reality of genuine Satanism. But, equally as important, some would assimilate the tradition, or parts of it (perhaps unconsciously, perhaps consciously by plagiarizing it) and thus not only be influenced by it but also aid the sinister energies it re-presented because of that influence. [Thus, some of the meaning of the term 'sinister dialectic' can be glimpsed.]] The next stage was to give form and substance to certain aspects of the sinister energies that the Order and thus its tradition represented -among such forms being Satanic images (e.g. in the form of Tarot images) and music.]\t These, by their very creation, would presence such energies (unconsciously influencing others·-particuarly 'the susceptable ones'). They also would be distributed in the manner used hitherto, spreading that sinister influence, partly (as the other earlier dissemination had done) via the process of] psychic contagion. Following this, there would be a gradual increase in both the quality and the number of items distributed -without however the genuine darkness of the]\t forms and tradition being diluted. In addition, more subtle approaches would be used -gradually contaminating psychic energies with strands of the sinister and thus overtly/covertly influencing/persuading others outside and within the ]\t Occult, and draWing them into that ever expanding circle of those tOUched by the powers of Darkness. [This paragraph explicates the current stage of play.] ]\t Thus, secrecy is preserved as and when necessary, while the tradition and thus the sinister is effectively spread. ]\t 000"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"J ] Synistry ] The following extracts are taken from \"Synistry -The Way of Satan\", the autobiography of a member of the ONA] The work is explicit in stating not only what Satanism is and involves, but also in detailing the often sinister (and sometimes illegal) experiences of the author.

According to the tradition I was heir to, the ritual was J performed every seventeen years by the Grand Master or Grand Mistress who represented that tradition -the opfer being a Priest of the tradition. In the ceremony, the Mistress of Earth identified with the role of Baphomet. J The sacrifice could, of course, be purely symbolic. It had been a long time since a voluntary sacrifice had occurred, the opfer, in the recent past, being carefully chosen. I believed I should continue this recent trend. I would need to plan the rite carefully -carefully choosing those who would take part. They would be sworn to secrecy, and would have to have no doubtsJ of any kind. I, like a few others, understood the meaning of the rite J itself -it would continue a tradition, creating a link with past deeds and thus magickal energies, and it would also create or draw down its own sinister energies. These could be directed to achieve a specific goal, J or they could be directed into a chosen individual or individual who would have an important sinister Destiny to fulfil, or they could be stored to await further use. Whatever, it was an extremely powerful and sinister rite. J Such a sacrifice would thus be for a specific Satanic goal, and in accordance with Satanic honour the opfer [for this would have to be an involuntary sacrificelwould choose him/her self by their deeds. That is, J their removal would benefit evolution, and consequently aid the sinister. They would not be chosen at random, as they would not be -despite the claims by those who knew nothing about genuine Satanism -virgins or children. They would be those whose removal would actively benefit our long-term aeonic goals. Let me express this plainly so that it will be understood. The victim or victims would be the type of person or persons whose death J by whatever means would not be mourned -someone or many would say: J 'He/she deserved it... ' The sacrifice would be akin to an act of natural justice. Naturally, it would be myself, in consultation with a few others, who would decide, and this decision would be based on sinister strategy ­or aeonics. Such an opfer could be chosen by such means at other times and the appropriate rite of sacrifice performed, but the Ceremony was more specific:J its aims, intent, were for a definite purpose. Accordingly, 'I began to J plan for the ritu~l - I already had a few vague ideas concerning suitable candidates, and asked a trusted Guardian of one of the Temples to begin research into their backgrounds. I also visited a few possible sites for the ritual, researched others, and began to consider those who might participate with me. , Of course, I had undertaken sacrifices before -in the approved manner. And even before those, I had tried a ritual of sacrifice. This was in my~ early days, before I assumed my role as heir. I, with some others involved in politics and vaguely involved with the sinister, planned to sacrifice someone to commemorate the founding our our new political movement. We chose the victim, j ~ and gathered on a crag in Yorkshire one night. Our plan was to will the victim to fall over the cliff to his death. So invokations were done. energies directed. The victim became possessed, stumbled and fell. Unfortunately, he fell only a short distance, and was mostly uninjured. So in that sense the ritual failed. I knew why -of those gathered, only myself and one other really J wanted to cause someone's death. The others were not committed to the sinister. I"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"J ] My other attempts were successful. The victims fell by assassination, or were victims of 'accidents' -all achieved by my \"underground\" political work, and what followed thereafter, as related in an ~arlier]\t chapter. I simply -before the act of execution -dedicated their death to my sinister cause. It was quite simple, and very effective, even in battle. I was merely continuing a long-standing pagan tradition -dedicating ] ] enemies beforehand, and enemies, they deserved Such was the \"approved\" themselves. Naturally, those who then killing\t them, for a cause, of course. Being to perish, their death aiding the sinister dialectic. Satanic manner. Thus did the victims choose have no understanding of Satanism, as well as those who oppose that philosophy of living, portray sacrifice differently. According to them, it is always the 'innocent' who are victims,]\t who are opfers. They seldom, if ever,define what is meant by 'innocent' -and cannot, however they try, define on a satisfactory basis, what 'evil' is. Hopefully, my revelations will destroy such myths -as they will destroy]\t the attempts by the feeble, mostly urbanized, people who call themselves 'Satanists' and who deny sacrifice exists or ever has existed as a Satanic practice. These people know nothing about real, primal, Satanism -they like the glamour of the sinister but are weak individuals, lacking in character,]\t who play at \"roles\" in a fantasy world. They do not have the passion, the spirit, the desire, the pride or the creative genius of genuine Satanists. Such people, in fact, would make good opfers ••.] Finally, what I have written before bears repeating -wars are the ultimate sacrificial rites, and it no coincidence that sometimes the sinister dialectic has aided these, and occassionally brought them about. ] ] ] *•• J ] ] J J J J ]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"J ] Aeonics and Manipulation I J Aeonic magick is essentially the use of magickal energies to effect J large-scale changes in the causal. This involves manipulation of forms, as well as a rational understanding of aeonic changes [civilizations, their ethos, etc.]. The forms involve transfering magickal energy -via the desire/aim -from the acausal to individuals. That is, manipulation of individuals on a large scale, both numerically and over time. The type of the manipulation varies, according to the formes) used and the desire/aim. ForJ example, there can be psychic manipulation via archetypal forms, direct manipulation via words/images/personality; indirect by psychological pressure ... ] Twa forms often used are religion and politics. Essentially, the sinister Adept takes a practical view of individuals insofar as Aeonics is concerned -understanding that the majority in whatever time and place, are by their nature, subjects: that is, raw] material to be used according to sinister strategy. This assessment is a-moral. J What this means in reality is that a goal is set (via a knowledge of Aeonics and sinister strategy -the 'sinister dialectic') and suitable means of achieving it are considered and a decision made. The decision is then J made real, presenced in the causal, by magickal and other acts -regardless of consequences, be they moral, magickal or otherwise. Sinister Adepts -because they are Adepts -only consider Aeonic type goals, J having as Initiates and External Adepts gained practical experience in \"external\" manipulation, that is, manipulation of a few individuals for personal reasons. This aids self-understanding and magickal abilities. The goals of Adepts relate to wyrd and thus Aeonics -they are: 1) the creation of a new wyrd, and thus a new Aeon; 2) disruption of existing wyrd (with either an alternate or no specific goal); 3) altering the wyrd in a] specific way; 4) fulfilling the wyrd of the Aeon. [It should be understood that Internal Adepts -not having attained full Mastery -are still part of the Aeonic wyrd pertaining during their causal life -time.] J An example will explicate this. Present Aeon: Western (or 'Faustian'/Promethean). Present phase: what should be 'Imperium' (the final phase of an Aeon), lasting c. 390 years.J During this last phase the energies of the next Aeon are manifest/created J by Adepts, via a physical nexion (or 'centre'). The practical forms of this new Aeon arise toward the end of Imperium -although some will exist/ be created before then, on a small scale: i.e. they will not seem to J significantly affect 'history'. This present Aeon has however been distorted -its ethos undermined and its forms changed. This distortion is basically Nazarene/Magian [see 'Crowley, Satan and the Sinister Way' and other Aeonics MSS]. It also changes the possibility of Imperium -from an almost certainty to only a minimum possibility.J Sinister strategy, at the present time, is to create a new Aeon of sinister import -and to achieve this, it is considered necessary to J (a) undermine the distortion of the Faustian ethos, and (b) fulfil the wyrd of the Faustian Aeon, that is, Imperium. Both of these will aid, by their nature, the creation of a new Aeon that is essentially Satanic. Thus, sinister Adepts will work, on both the practical and the magickal level, toward the achievement of these aims. This sinister strategy isj part of their vow -their wyrd -as Initiates of the sinister tradition: that is, they are pledged to fulfil it~ if possible, and certainly aid its fulfilment. Other Adepts will have other aims -if a sinister Adept decides J on another strategy, they cease to be Adepts of a certain Satanic tradition, becoming something else instead. Only when -and if -they reach the stage of Grand Master/Mistress will they have the knowledge, ability and understanding to change sinister strategy. * Whether or not they are aware of this, at the time."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"J ] To aid the creation of a new, Satanic, Aeon, the following are necessary: 1) the presencing of sinister energies in particular ways at this present time -i.e. the creation of specific archetypal forms/images/] systems/ideas which affect individuals. 2) the opening of a physical nexion to draw acausal energies in a significant way and enable their presencing. 3) the performance of certain Aeonic rites (e.g. Nine Angles) to create]\t sinister 'psychic pressure', altering individuals. [Note: this is more general than (1) and involves letting the energies presence according to their nature, this nature being formed via the rites used.]]\t 4) the creation of particular and specific practical forms and the channelling of magickal energies into these. 5) the emergence of more Adepts of the sinister tradition -i.e. individuals possessed of self-understanding, Occult insight and abilities, who are]\t imbued with the ethos of the new Aeon. 6) the creation of the ethos of the new Aeon in a way enabling its apprehension (both unconsciously and consciously) by those who are not Adepts and who] are not involved in esoteric Arts. In addition, and as mentioned above, there is (a) undermining Nazarene/ Magian forms/effects; and (b) aiding the fulfilment of a Faustian Imperium.] (a) involves performing rites such as The Black Mass and others from The Black Book of Satan; spreading the tenets/forms of traditional Satanism enabling others to follow the Way (or at least utilize in some form its -lenergies, to the detriment of others); undermining/distorting the distortion itself, both magickally and otherwise[magickally -e.g. Mass of Heresy]. (b) involves assisting in both a magickal and a practical way, those]\t individuals/groups/forms who/which have as their aim a practical expressing of Faustian ideals, and who/which thus assist or contribute to the Faustian ethos.

[Rituals from Black Book perform part of this.] (4) involves forms such as religion, politics, Art, philosophy and]\t practical expressions of these -groups, organizations, \"Art-objects\" and so on: all imbued with the sinister nature of the new Aeon.

Anything else is not sinister -but game-playing.I ~ * All such forms presence the future in the present: i.e. they capture/ re-present aspects of the new Aeon, practically, magickally and psychically. J ,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"l ] ] Aeonics and Manipulation II j Part I considered means; here, we are concerned with what terms like 'new sinister Aeon' mean. First, it should be understood that the present civilization [which re-presents the energies of the Aeon now existing) was, in its ethos, essentially what is termed 'Faustian'. That is, dynamic, questing for knowledge and understanding. The exoteric expression of this ethos is science -or, more correctly, a reasoned approach to the 'world'; a conscious evaluation based on experience/ evidence. Aspects of this ethos are expressed in the Renaissance -and in National-Socialist Germany. This latter is most important, and so often mis-understood. NS Germany represented the quintessence of 'Western' civilization: an exhuberance, a balance between 'Man' and 'Nature', a spiritual force heir to the ancient Greeks and Romans. Civilization means a way of living -and of dying -more than it means Art and artifacts. It certainly does not mean material comforts, or even a certain type of politics (like 'democracy'). The greatest example of and model for a civilization, is the warrior: someone who enshrines honour, loyalty and natural justice (or 'fiir-play'). That this is so seldom understood, today, is evident of how few really understand: of how precious wisdom still is. Further, the fact that the above statements regarding National-Socialist Germany are heresy (in the literal sense) today, explicates the distortion that has occured in the Faustian civilization far better than dozens of words. This ethos, exoterically, is Satanic. That is, the true ethos of the West enshrines a Satanic view of the world - a pagan joy in conquest, experience, living, in seeking and going beyond limits, physically and intellectually. The morbidity of the Nazarene has undermined all this ­distorted it. In essence, therefore, a Faustian Imperium would have been a type of Satanic State on Earth: a fulfilment of the first part of the sinister dialectic of history, and would have made possible the next part or stage, that of a Galactic Empire. It would be during this later stage that another goal would have been achieved - a genuine evolution in consciousness, a higher type of individual, on a massive scale. That is, Adepthood with its self-understanding and knowledge would be commonplace rather than (as now) the preserve of a few. However, Satanism -in both exoteric and esoteric forms -became and is a heresy. Except for a brief and glorious period when an exoteric form achieved power -i.e. NS Germany. Here, exoteric means an outward form or ~: a physical presencing which achieves change in the causal. Esoteric means 'the essence'. An example -an Initiate of the sinister tradition becomes through Initiation an outward expression of Satanic spirit, consciously. The sinister becomes presenced, in the causal, by the actions/magick/life of the Initiate. In a sense, the causal persona/psyche of the Initiate is a \"Temple of Satan\". As the Sinister Way is followed, according to tradition, the Initiate accesses more and more of the sinister -presences more of it in the causal, causing/provoking change both internal and external. As knowledge and understanding increase, there is more awareness of the sinister as it is -i.e. without forms: the sinister ceases to be hidden or occult. At first, the essence of the sinister is hidden or obscured. An exoteric form implies a form, a channel -which is not necessarily consciously understood as a form or channel. A form can be either 'positive' or 'negative' with respect to the morals pertaining at the time -the sinister is beyond opposites but can only be presenced through them at particular times. That is, it becomes 'earthed' through a positive or negative form and thus provokes change and evolution. However, 'morals' ­as mentioned above -does not mean ethical: rather, it implies the prevalling 'spirit' or orientation, the orthodoxy of the moment."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"J l•\t A civilization is itself a form for sinister energy:a form possessed of its own 'life-cycle' (first mentioned by Spengler although not really 1\t understood by him). Thus, a civilizat-ion through its metamorphosis fulfills or can fulfil the sinister dialectic -i.e. it aids evolution toward• new forms, presences the sinister and enables the acausal to be accessed (sometimes directly by a few individuals per Aeon).lThe Western civilization is a link -the fifth stage of the seven that• 1can lead to new forms of existence.

It will involve manipulation by sinister Adepts of vast energies over centuries of time -for without this direction,l\tthis sinister manipulation, inertia will return, entropy increase, and-the petty ones, the visionless ones, the Nazarene-type ones will spawn in their worthless majority until they overwhelm.•. As has been written J elsewhere, civilization is a struggle and requires the triumph of a noble minority who impose their vision on those that they conquer. Thus, the term 'new sinister Aeon' means the triumph of a creativel minority imbued with a specific elan and a sense of Destiny who create and maintain a civilization, this particular civilization extending wellI -beyond the confines of the Solar System. It means the presencing of sinister energies in particular ways, and certain ways of living -ways which are essentially Satanic. What these ways are, has been prefiguredIJ by NS Germany [and particuarly by aspects within that form, such as the Waffen-55) . The means to achieve this -such as aiding Imperium, presencing sinisterI J energies, opening a nexion [and drawing forth 'The Dark Gods') -have already been outlined. What it is important to remember is that the means,] such as political forms, their support/manipulation etc., are part of sinister strategy to achieve a specific goal. That is, they are purely means: IJ not the goal itself, and as such cannot be judged causally or by the standards pertaining at anyone time. They have been chosen to achieve I something, and those who cannot comprehend this do not understand Aeonic I magick.

The latter involves the 'pruning' of unnecessary] elements on a large scale -the creation of an elite capable of making the Aeon a reality. The first involves the creation/aiding of a practical form -and presencing magickal energy into it. It also involves creating the right]\t psychic conditions -within and external to individuals. Some of this is directly magickal, involving magickal energy accessed via rituals etc.; some of it is providing/creating/making available the information and forms J ] of the sinister.

This is because the use of the tradition, in whole or in part [e.g. rituals from the Black Book] by others outside of of being drawn into the tradition, makes those others 'channels' for the]\t sinister energy the tradition represents. That is, they 'presence' sinister energies in a precise and particular way and thus fulfil sinister strategy. The tradition has been given its present form [as] explicated in the various books and MSS] to achieve just this (as well as other things). However, the creation of new forms is important and indeed vital -there must be a continuing evolution. These forms will further access the]\t sinister, and presence it.The tradition itself serves as a Way -both for individuals, and.aeonically: it enables the achievement of individual Adeptship, as well as the fulfilment of the sinister dialectic of history.]\t This will be so for the next few centuries -until the New Aeon becomes a reality. That is, its methods and techniques should not be changed (at least not intentionally by those of the tradition for the next few decades)]\t or 'superseded' -as a way of creating Adepts etc. This is not a question of 'dogma' but rather strategy, as mentioned above. It is vital that this and the reasons for and beyond it are understood by those of the tradition. The external forms [such as arise prior to and during the Aeon] will only]\t arise from an initial coherence of magickal energies and intent -and it is and will be the unchanging form of the 'Way' [techniques, rituals etc.] which will enable this. The new forms created/evolved will add to rather]\t than undermine what already is. Anything else is simply individuals playing at magick (and particuarly playing at Aeonics) without achieving anything and indeed without understanding what they are doing.] Initiation and Beyond: The quest of an individual can only and ever be]\t individual, that is, unique. The quest, made possible and aided by the tradition,developes the individual, enabling individual wyrd to be understood, and lived. It is also makes possible Immortality (qv. ] ] Acausal Existence -The Secret Revealed). Beyond a certain level, Initiates gUide themselves -learning from their own real-life experiences. That is, they have acquired sufficient self-insight and honesty to enable them to do this. When this stage is reached [toward the end of External Adept for some; during and beyond Internal Adept for others] there should be still a following of the ultimate goal - a striving for the Abyss and beyond, although this 'striving' will be more balanced]\t than hitherto. This does not mean the individuals become or develope their own ways of achieveing that goal -that is, not undergoing the Grade Rituals of Internal Adept and beyond according to tradition because they believe they ] ] are not necessary or that they have/can create (d) other means. Should they do this, they will not achieve the specific goal of the sinister way -but rather something else entirely, or else nothing. The reasons should be obvious from the above (Traditions ... ). The Aim: Wisdom. And its living, enabling the last stage (into the acausal... ). J ] This means self-understanding and supra-personal understanding. An apprehension of the world and its forms as they are - a rational knowing: and what is necessary for change, aeonic and otherwise. This knowledge is sometimes sad, and often born from ordeals and having lived the Abyss. It never confers wealth nor privelege, and seldom imbues one with 'happiness'. It is beyond words, but can sometimes be transmuted into a form enabling some others to apprehend if only in part its essence. This aim takes causal time -usually c. 20 years from]\t Initiation (if the Way is followed) -and lies beyond the Abyss. It is balance, beyond opposites, a new way of being. 1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"J Esoteric Tradition VI -lBaphomet, Opfer and Related Matters: The word 'opfer' generally refers to the sacrifice that occurs -symbolic or otherwiseJ\t during certain rituals. There are, generally, two types of opfer: (t)associated with rites to open a nexion, between Aeons -when such an opfer(s) are considered necessary in terms of the 'energy' required; (2) those associated withJ traditional beliefs regarding the 'working of the cosmos. ('Opfers' associated with 'death ritual.s' form a third type.) The second type, according to tradition, was chosen onceJ\t every 17 years and this sacrifice was regarded as necessary to retain 'the cosmic bal.ance' -in modern terms, keep a nexion open (and thus preserve the associated higher civil.ization etc.).]\t The chosen one was made an honoury Priest (this type of opfer was al.ways mal.e -.see bel.ow) and there was a joining between him and one or more women, as Priestesses. This joining was a simpl.e type of 'hierosgamos', and the offspring of theJ\t union(s) were given great honour. At the ceremony itself. the head of the opfer was severed and displayed -usuall.y for a night and a day (although this period may have been longerl\t in the very distant past). The rite was conducted outdoors in a 'Sacred' pl.ace -often a circl.e of stones 0' hil.l-top. The chosen one was abl.e, because of the sacrifice, tolpartake of an acausal. existence -becoming thus an Immortal.-Thus was 'wil.l.ing sacrifice' possibl.e, al.though it is easy to imagine that in later times, the opfer was not al.ways wil.l.ing. Traditionally, this type goes back to Albion and while 1-J originally the ritual. was probably a community affair, it became more and more secretive. What survives to the present day (The Ceremony of Recall.ing with 'opfer' ending) probabl.y reflects the essence of this earl.ier tradition rather than the detail (the words, chants etc.). This essence may be apprehended in the rol.e of the ~fistress of Earth -representativeJ of Baphomet, the dark goddess. It was to Baphomet that the sacrifice was made -hence a mal.e opfer. Indeed, the whole ceremony (of Recalling) can be seen as a celebration of the dark goddess -the Earth Mistress/goddess in her darker/J\t violent/sinister aspect. The 'severed head' was associated with the 'worship' of Baphomet -hence the traditional. representation of Baphomet.] This 'cult of Baphomet' derives from Albion (see bel.ow). The significance of the 17 year cycl.e is unclear -if there was an oral tradition, it has been lost. In the past few decades,] some theories to explain this 17 year cycle have been advanced, but they are unconvincing. The identification of Daphomet as the Bride of Lucifer/Satan probabl.y dates from around the 10th or 11th century ev, as does the use of the name 'Satan'/Satanas as the Earth-bound representative of the Dark Gods. It is important to remember that in earlier times (eg. in Albion during the Hyperborian aeon) there was no cl.ear and/or 'moral' distinction between the 'light' and the 'sinister': the two were seen as different aspects of the same thing. Thus, what we know as the Mistress of Earth (the 'goddess') wasJ both what we now cal.l. 'Baphomet' (the dark aspect) and Gaia (the Earth mother). Likewise with the 'mal.e' aspect -Satan and Lucifer -or Dionysus/Kabeiroi and Apol.l.o. We now understandJ\t all such symbol.s as unconscious/conscious projections onto \"realityl' (where \"reality\" = the region of causal./acausal. mergence) ] -"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"J \"\"'T i-as 'gates'/nexions to the acausal itself, with the seven spheres of the Tree of Wyrd being a 'map' of these gates understanddbleJ by 'non-Adept' consciousness. Thus, the sphere of lolercury re-presents Lucifer/Satan -lolercury, Mars and Sun being the \"male\" spheres, and Hoon, Venus, Jupiter the \"female\" ones] (Saturn being beyond such opposites -'Chaos' itself). The 'cult of Baphomet' was the worship of the dark aspect of the \"female\" energies -where in this context, worship]\t means a striving toward understanding/conscious integration. Traces of the worship of the 'light' aspect survive in the septenary tradition in the name \"Aktlal maka\" (qv notes on ]\t Names and Symbols) and the natural form of the Nine Angles rite. The darker aspect survives, in essence, in the Ceremony of Recalling and the traditions associated with the 'Nistress of Earth' and 'Baphomet'. As to the original name of the goddess]\t in both her aspects, there is a tradition which gives 'Darkat' as the name used before 'ilaphomet' became the common usage. However, 'Azanigin' has also been suggested -as has 'Aktlall\tMaka' for the 'light'/Gaia aspect, although both these are l--merely 20th century (ev) suggestions, not based on any oral tradition. Some aspects of the cult of the (dark) goddess are said to have survived into Greek times in the 'Mystery cults'\t (qv Kabeiroi -and also 'Eleusis' for the 'light' aspect), this being an 'indirect' survival', the 'modern' septenary tradition being a direct one, rrom Albion.] The use of the name 'Baphomet' probably derives from the 10th or 11th century (ev) although the traditional pictorial representation of 'Baphomet' is undoubtedly much older. Aslelsewhere, if there was an oral tradition connected with the-origin of the name Daphomet, it has been lost. Thus, there are no indications as to the 'original' names of the 'light' and 'sinister' elements on the \"male\" side ..lknown to us as 'Lucifer' and 'Satan'. These latter names probably also derive from around the 10th or 11th century (ev) although 'Karu Samsu' (or something very similiar) has beenJ\t suggested for the 'Lucifer' aspect and 'Sapanur' as the 'sinister' aspect. J The rites associated with the first type of opfer ­such as 'The Sinister Calling -cannot be either dated with certainty or seen to be derived from an earlier tradition. In1all probability, they derive from the 12th or 13th century (ev),-although it is quite possible that earlier versions/forms existed. Some have even considered The Sinister Calling as a later version of the Ceremony of Recalling. Again, if there was an oral tradition, it has been lost -all that remains are the rituals themselves. The 'Black Mass' itself (and indeed most of the ceremonial rituals in 'The Black Book') probably orginated around the same time as The Sinister Calling. The original ~Iass was said in Latin, although by the middle of the 20th century (ev) a translated version had found its way into the 'Black Book' of necessity, although some Latin chants remained. ...\t c.N.A . *"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"J J\t The Rite of the Nine Angles J J The rite may be undertaken on either the autumnal equinox (for the Dabih gate) or the winter solstice (for Algol). The Naos rite is suitable for southern climes and will not be given here ­J although in form it is the same as the version given. Ideally, the rite should be undertaken either: a) on a hill-top of pre-Cambrian rock which lies between a line of volcanic intrusion and another rock -in Britain this other rock is 'Buxton' b) in an underground cavern where water flows [this applies onlyJ\t to the 'chthonic' form] c) in a glade consecrated beforehand within a circle of nine stones (the first stone being set on a night of the new moonJ\t with Saturn rising, the second at the full moon and so on: the first stone marking the point on the horizon where Saturn rises) [Note: this applies only to the 'natural' form of the Rite] J ] Further, the time is right when, for Dabih, Venus sets after the sun, and the moon itself occults Dabih or is near to it; and, for Algol, when Jupiter and Saturn are both near the moon which is becoming new, the time being before dawn. These conditions mean that energies are available to enhance the working. J The rite exists in three versions -the natural form, the chthonic, and the solo. The chthonic form may be combined with the Ceremony of Recalling and the Sacrificial Conclusion undertaken] according to tradition. It must be noted however that this combination is exceedingly dangerous -if done correctly with J (a) above and with the conditions for Algol as above, it brings back to Earth the Dark Gods themselves by opening the Star Gate between the causal and the acausal. However, the chthonic form may be successful in bringing to presence the Dark Gods without the Sacrificial aspect if theJ chants are done correctly, the crystal is sufficient in size, and cosmic tides aligned aright [note: this usually occurs when an Aeon is (magickally) ending, the energies being more pronouncedJ in the last three decades. At other times the rite can be used to bring about such changes] The natural form involves a Priest and Priestess [ideally theseJ\t should have undertaken the ritual of Internal Adept -or at the very least External Adept] and is basically a drawing to the Earth of acausal energies -these are left to disperse naturally:J i.e. without any magickal intent. The chthonic form involves a Priest and a Priestess as well as at least one Cantor trained in sinister Esoteric Chant together with a congregation of male and female. This form is either an invokation to the Dark Gods -the energies being dispersed naturally -or a chanelling of those energies into a specific event or events or individual. This chanelling however requires the skill of at least a Master of Temple/Mistress of Earth. The solo form involves one individual and the aim is usually the alteration of the consciousness of that individual: this however is very dangerous."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"J Note: all the above forms require a crystal tetrahedron made of] quartz.

If desired (ie. sinister intent) this energy may be symbolized by Atazoth -a dark and nebulous chaos issuing forth from a] star strewn Space which changes into a 'Dagon' like entity before becoming chaos again. This visualization continues until the sexual climax of the Priestess after which the Priest reaches his] own climax. The Priestess then rises and buries the crystal in the earth of the hill [as deep as possible -this may be prepared beforehand -and leaving few traces].

After this vibration the cantor and Priest (or two Cantors if there are two) vibrate in fourths the \"Diabolus\" chant [see set texts] while the Priestess places her hands on the crystal, visualizing the Star Gate opening (as in I above). After the Diabolus, the Priest signals to the congregation who begin an orgiastic rite according to their desires. The Priest and Priestess then vibrate \"Binan ath ga wath am\" a fifth apart (or an octave and a fifth) while the Cantor(s) vibrate \"Atazoth\"., If two Cantors are present, this Atazoth vibration begins in parallel: the next \"Atazoth\" is a fifth apart as is the third.

If this form is done, it is important for the congregation to visualize the Star Gate opening while they chant -and this visualization should be agreed beforehand and be the same as that of the Priestess and Priest. This form of the chthonic rite is however only effective if the congregation has been trained to chant in the correct manner. A suitable cavern/resonant building/Temple may be used in this instance.

It begins at sunset on a night of the new moon with Saturn rising. The individual should face Saturn and vibrate \"Nythra kthunae Atazoth\" seven times while holding the crystal.

After, the individual chants the 'Atazoth chant', places the crystal on the ground and sits near it, to visualize its interior becoming black and this blackness spreading out to engulf the individual. [Note: This ritual should not be undertaken lightly. There must be a preparedness to exult in the energies.

I Hell I shall be honest -Satanism has been hijacked. By posers, by pseudo-intellectuals and by gutless weaklings who like the glamour and danger associated with it in the public mind but who do not have the guts to be evil -to do dark deeds. These modern days so-called 'satanists' are really Nazarene scum in disguise -worms in dead snake-skin. They prattle on about 'morality', puff themselves up with titles and perform verbal and intellectual gymnastics. They think being Satanic invloves calling yourself a Satanist and dressing up like Dracula or t-1ephistopheles or a vamp. Well, I am sick of these imposters. Those who get a thrill from playing the role but who never actually do anything evil, who never go to extremes, who never stand on the edge -or\"climb down to the darkness of the pit of lIell. Those who have never experienced the limits of themselves in love, in war, in living -these weaklings trying so hard to impress. What, then, is real Satanism all about? First, it is about rebellion -against the conformity of the present. And I mean a real rebel, a real outlaw -someone who cuts a dash, who has charisma, whose very presence makes others uneasy ( and who does not have to wear some stupid 'costume' to do this). Second, it is about testing your own Destiny• So -you believe you are special, do you? Well, prove it! Try something dangerous -try something to see if you get away with it. If not -tough, you failed. There are plenty of others ••• If you succeed, try again, until you know your limits. Choose a good cause, or a bad one or no cause at all, and really live, intoxicating yourself with life, danger, achievement. Do not rest and never be afraid to face the possibility of death. But in all that you do be honourable -to yourself. Carry this honour with you everywhere like a favourate concealed weapon. Third, learn from your experiences -like you would learn from a 'bad' woman (or man) in your youth when sex was still something of a mystery. A real Satanist does not often do magick -they are magick by the very nature of their dynamic, zestful existence. It is experience which teaches, from which you learn -you cannot learn Satanism from books (although some may guide you aright to begin with), it cannot be taught by 'Masters' and never involves cosy little discussions with 'friends' or others. Anyone who accepts a 'Master' and grovels before them ­however slight that grovelling may be -is not a Satanist, just a sucker who sucks. Accepting some 'authority' is a sign you are weak: a sign you need emotional crutches: a sign you are a whimp. So, get off your arse, you suckers, and make Satan proud. Learn to do evil. What is evil? All that restricts life -all that tries to constrain the possibilities. Doing evil means breaking these restrictions and constaints -and taking the consequences of your own actions. Just do -just discover, just smash the chains that hold most others in thrall, and never bow down to anyone about anything: smash them first, or die rather than submit.

Participants: J\t Master of the Temple -Purple robes Mistress of Earth -Purple robes Priestess -naked, upon altar Priest -black robe, tied' with white cord/girdleJ Congregation -black robes Guardian of the Temple -black robes, with face mask J\t Preparation: 1) Seven days before the rite, the congregation assemble in the dwelling of the Master or Mistress. Here they stay until the rite is complete. During the seven days they areJ\t forbidden to speak, wear only ceremonial robes, will abstain from intoxicating drinks and sexual pleasures and eat no meat. (This is a 'Black Fast'.) During the hours of darkness no lights]\t except black candles are to be lit and at sunset on each day they gather in the Temple to chant the Dies Ira: nine times. During the seven days no contact with outsiders is allowed,]\t and no music or intrusive sound, save for the Dies Irae and the Atazoth chant, is to be heard. Both the dwelling and the Temple should be incensed with Saturnian incense. According to tradition, the robes worn will contain a hood/cowl which is to be worn during the daylight hours, these hours being taken up with walking within the dwelling grounds (or a suitable, isolated location nearby) for at least three hours together with such diversions as the r-Iaster and r-astress will arrange. (Note: These diversions -which in recent times include playing the Star Game ­are so chosen so as not to destroy the black tranquillity of the fast. In the past they have included study of alchemical MSS, silent Tarot readings (using sign language/drawn symbols for the reader to express meanings) and practice in performing esoteric chant (Dies Irae/Atazoth chant -fourth/fifths and so on), this latter in the Temple if the Calling is to be performed there. 2) The Temple is prepared seven days before the rite (this applies to the site chosen -which should thereafter"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I l be guarded by appropriate energy). This consists of the Master and Mistress incensing the area with Saturnian incenseJ . while chanting seven times the 'Sanctus Satanas'. T~~y then unite in sexual union, the Mistress visualizing the nexion to the Dark Gods as being gradually opened, though remaining partly closed. l J One planetary hour before the Calling begins on the seventh day, the Temple/outdoor area is made ready by an Initiate chosen for this task. A black cloth is laid on the altar and seven black candles placed upon it and lit. Chalices of strong wine are prepared ready near the altar. A large quartz crystal is placed in the centre of the Temple, on an oak (or wooden) stand. (Note: It enhances the energies if this crystal is shaped as a tetrahedron. Whatever the shape, the crystal should be as large as possible.) The l-1aster brings the Sacrificial Knife. An image of Baphomet, according to sinister tradition, may be present in the Temple, but no other artifacts, furnishings, signs or symbols. l The congregation et al gather outside the Temple, robed asl above, and are led into the Temple by the (naked) Priestess at the beginning of the rite. 3)As the congregation assemble on the seventh day before the rite (they will have been informed some time before by the Master or Mistress of the date of the Calling, its purpose and intent being explained) lots are drawn to decide which man among them shall be chosen. The one chosen by the drawing ofl\t lots (the 'opfer') is free to then accept or decline the honour. If this honour is declined, another lot is held, and the one so chosen may also decline. After this, a further lot is held, the l l result of which is binding. The opfer so chosen by lot is then led by the Guardian(s) to a secure, secluded place and resides there until the rite of Calling begins. Each night and in this place the opfer receives the Priestess for the length of one planetary hour, the Priestess being chosen from among the Temple to be at this period capable of conception. If the Master or ~1istress so desire, another lady in addition to the Priestess may be chosen and received by the opfer at the dawn of each day. It is duty of the Guardian(s) to watch over and care for the opfer during the days before the rite, and lead him to the Templel for the Calling. The Rite: The congregation precess into the Temple, led by the Priestess who is assisted onto the altar by the Mistress. The congregation gather in a semi-circle before the altar, the Guardian{s) holding the opfer by the entrance. The Mistress greets the Master with a kiss, saying: 'To you is it fitting, Master, to speak to our gods for these many. With your own eyes see how we seekers of darkness await this calling forth of our gods!' The Mistress gestures with her hands, and the congregation remove their hoods/cowls. She says: 'So shall we rejoicing, dancel' The congregation begin to dance, counter-sunwise around the altar chanting \"Binan ath ga wath am\". The Master lays the S.

He kisses the opfer, followed by the Mistress and the congregation who kiss the opfer in turn. The ~Jistress then removes the robe of the opfer and begins to raise his secret fire with her lips while the Master gestures to the congregation as a sign for them to remove their robes. They then begin to dance again -chanting 'Atazoth', Satanas and/or shouting/laughing/screaming as they whirl faster and faster in ecstasy and frenzy. As they dance, the Guardian lifts the Priest upon the altar while the Master takes up the S. Knife. The Priestess holds the opfer in sexual union and visualizes the nexion opening as she draws by movement the secret fire from the opfer. She then releases him and on this sign the Mistress signals to the congregation who begin an orgiastic rite according their desires. The Mistress then touches the crystal with her hands visua1izing/intoning the aim/intent of the ca11ing, ad libitum according to the frenzy/energy generated in the Temp1e.

A healthy' society is one that tends to respect the individual right to justice and thus revenge: the two are1\t linked and cannot be seperated without destroying both, leaving an empty shell. A healthy society seeks to respect the individual, and extend their responsibilities and duties,] and one of the most important responsibilities and duties of any individual is to avenge. This view is not upheld by many today -and eertainly by]\t none who form those cliques of legal and social 'professionalism' which infest society today. Instead, the present System seeks to convince us all, from childhood, that only the State has the \"right\" to deal with \"Justice\" -and that only]\t this is \"civilised\". But if' you believe that, you really are ill -one of those pale specimens inebriated by the clever words and ideas of the half-men (and half-women) who] unf'ortunately proliferate today in our comfortable and monied societies. Revenge is natural and necessary. An illustration here might be instructive. A young motorist, high on drink andJ\t drugs, deliberately runs down and kills someone: the classic 'innocent passerby'. After some trouble, the ~olice find this driver and he is charged. When his case comes to]\t court, he manages to wriggle out of the murder charge('lack of suf'ficient evidence'/some legal problem) and is instead convicted of manslaughter. He shows no remorse. He is sentenced]\t to 3 years in prison. After a little over ~ years he is released, and some months later is arrested for drink driving and driving while disqualified. A few more months in prison. Then he is free. Now, in this instance (and many like it) thel ~\t relatives of the victim have a duty to kill this piece of scum -and should be ashamed of themselves if' they did not. Naturally, they would give all sorts of reasons as to whyJ\t they would do nothing -but basically they are, if they do nothing, (a) spineless cowards; (b) degenerate bastards who do not care; (c) so ground down by the System, by the lies]\t and propaganda, that their natural instincts have been destroyed. They -one or some of them -should have killed the offender. Naturally, in the feeble societies of the Western tyrannies, had they done so they '''ould -if caught -have faced \"Justice\"J\t and the legal system themselves: and probably spent longer in prison than the bastard who deserved to die (such is the sickness of the \"West\"). But, until this whole rotten System is]\t destroyed, they should have used the rules of the System against itself -why not, for instance, run the bastard himself down? You would, if caught, only get a few years.

In short, a return of the conquering attitude. All that isJ\t great and worthwhile is built from the blueprint of inner vision, and the greatest vision is conquest -of ourselves, of others, of what is still unknown.

So what dreams are, today, fit enough for those who aspire to be like gods? There are only two, as this century ends. And they are connected. The first is to destroy those edifices which the cowards,J\t the weak, the huddling majority have erected to defend themselves from the natural elite -those few who dare, who defy, who despise and are fearless and conquering in theirJ\t defiance.

'subliminal'). That is, society is developing so as to make practical experience of the] traumas of life more and more distant -the individual becoming shielded not only by the 'State' and its Institutions by also by ideas. Thus, the world is seen via the distorting lenses of these ideas. In the past, wisdom arose usually]\t painfully over a period of time by diverse and often traumatic personal experience -that is, a very individual 'view of the world' was formed as a result of these varied] experiences. Of course, few arrived at even this stage of conscious devlopment. Magick, properly understood, was an attempt to 'short­] circuit' this process -hence, for example, the tasks and proceedures of the Grade Rituals in the seven-fold Way. Thus, magick bUilt, from within and without the individual, a genuine foundation -an 'inner core' which enabled the]\t individual to not only survive in an often hostile world, but also enhance their life quite significantly. Magick restores the individual in a very important way to the 'roots of their]\t being' allowing thus a personal growth. However, society in general does the opposite. Its 'education', its Institutions, its Laws all act together to] produce an individual lacking in spirit: that is, devoid of a personal world-view. Moreover, this occurs whatever the outward political allegiance of the society -ego socialist or capitalist or shades inbetween. -and occurs whether or not]\t a particular society is 'democratic' or overty 'repressive. The only difference between the two is the method: the latter is more objectified and direct, often involving force and] suppression, while the latter is more devious (and all the more dangerous because of this). Essentially, there is growing within nearly all the societies] of the world a concensus and an adherence to a certain set of ideas and values. That is, there is a 'levelling down' of differences together with a real loss of individual freedom-I not only in terms of the ability of an individual to transit J freely, unencumbered by whatever 'past' he or she may have, but equally importantly in terms of inner outlook. There is less and less 'realness' about individuals because the dramatic, foramtive experiences which shape and mould character and which give spirit are either becoming 'illegal'/frowned upon or made impossible by State control and/or indoctrination of] the individual into a certain pattern of living/ideas about life. In the practical sense, one could say not only are the legal restraints on an individual and their actions increasing, but also the direct power which States have over individuals]\t (and this includes information about individuals) are ever growing. This, coupled with cooperation between States in the distribution/exchange of information and the desire for even more] and larger 'federations' of States (eg. like a 'European State') both national and international, means more and more direct personal restrictions and less and less 'inner freedom'. There J is in short, much more superficial ways of living: ways encouraged by States and by those who adhere to what is fast becoming the accepted world 'idea-system'."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"1J -This 'idea-system', it will surprise few here, is based to a great extent on the 'Nazarene view of the world'. Already in one of its many political forms it is established within -the States of the West where its watchwords include 'democracy' and 'equality' and 'freedom'. Of course, these words enshrine clever ideas -but they are not real simply because they]\t belong to something beyond one or at least a few individuals. This is really the crux of the matter. What is real is that which exists for each one of us, and this is and must be ]\t discovered anew by every individual as part of the process of life itself: when it is not, there is no real life -only the appearance of it. There is thus no ~inner essence, only outward form. What this means is that all goverments, States,]\t Institutions or power-groupings negate this essence because our conscious life is a personal process of development pivital upon our understanding of ourselves, the world, the] cosmos and those few others with whom we inter-act in a very personal way: it should not be extrapolated beyond this, and all politics, all religion and all social pressures of whatever] hue contradict this. They are, essentially, counter-evolutionary because they make the individual reliant on that which is not born from within. Thus there can be no such thing as genuine 'democracy/freedom/equality' and all attempts to] create what are only abstract ideas destroy individuality. Such abstract ideas, however, continue to flourish, and they continue to make the individual sterile. There will be, in]\t the near future, more and reliance upon such ideas, more and more attempts to make them a 'reality' in State/governmental forms -ego in Eastern Europe and beyond.] Of course, this analysis forms the core of 'genuine anarchism': but even this is a label, an 'ism' which has evolved into an 'idea' with all the dissent appropriate to an idea. Magick is a means away from all this -it is a practical system,l devoid of dogma, and makes possible the next stage of our -evolution as individuals. As such, it is direct opposition to all power-forms -governmental, religious or social ­] although this opposition is silent and will remain silent. Magick is individual and will remain individual and while current conditions remain not unfavourable as regards the] spread of information relating to its techniques, this will probably change: simply because inner liberation is and will continue to be so for some time the province of a small number of ind~viduals while the devotees of abstract political-and social ideas continue to flourish and expand. This, naturally, is only a brief resume of the problem -, and what perhaps it is essential to remember is that we as artists of the magickal possess the ability to bring-about change: both within ourselves and, should we wish it, within the society within which we live. The essence of the former is the seven-fold way, that of the latter -aeonic magick. •I I"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"J ONA J ~ I ~ ] ] ] ~] ~ ~ ~ ~] ~ ~ J? 0 -~ ~J ~ ] ~ ~ ] ~ , ~ ] ] ~~ ~ ] --J I ~ ~ I ~ I ~ Insight Roles Insight roles is the name given to a dangerous technique aimed at developing personal unders+anding. The technique itself is simple:-it involves the individual living for a specific period of time -between six months to two years - a certain role or 'way of life'. What makes this difficult and dangerous is that the role chosen must be at odds with the individuals' own feelings and view of the world. This brings the individual into conflict with themselves -and sometimes friends and society as well. This forces the individual to rely on themselves and discard in a practical way all the illusions that must be discarded if Adeptship is to be achieved. The technique is not to be undertaken lightly, but once begun ~ be.continued for the allotted time. The technique is normally begun after the Grade Ritual of External Adept and after the individual has successfully run their own magickal group for at least three months. It is imnortant that the individual strive to identify with the chosen role, and not see it merely as an unpleasant task. This identification must begin with a conscious decision to act the role as convincingly as possible. The role itself, for the period of time chosen, should be the main interest and occupation of the individual. In an important way, Insight Roles are magickal rituals extending over a period of time and for the majority of individuals following the seven-fold way (the sinister path) are necessary as a prelude to the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept. It is the experiences undergone (both external and internal) during an Insight Role that give the individual the impetus necessary to undertake and complete the period of isolation required during the Grade Ritual. For it is this period of isolation which is often necessary for the individual to understand and ~ntegrate those experiences. From these, the genuine Adept is born. All Insight Roles, of necessity, seem 'bizarre' to non-Adepts. The individual who decides to undertake the technique should choose a role (from those listed) which is the opposite of what they themselves consider their own personality to be. General Guidelines: When a role is undertaken, you are forbidden to explain to anyone the reasons for this sudden change in your behaviour/attitudes.

There were many reasons for this, most of them practical: the tradition was esoteric, liable to mis-interpretation, and many of its tenets and rituals involved what would have been regarded as 'heretical', anti-social and/or illegal acts. Furthermore, the methods used to train novices often made those novices into 'outlaws' and set them against conventional society. Also, for a long time,the teaching and teachings of the tradition was heretical in Law - a criminal] offense against Church and State. Secrecy was essential and necessary. This state of affairs pertained until quite recently. With the burgeoning of interest in 'the Occult' in general, the LHP became somewhat less secret]\t and certain aspects of the tradition were discreetly circulated. What were mistakenly taken to be 'esoteric' traditions and, given the new openess toward the Occult and the repeal of anti-Occult laws, freely distributed and/or published, were (a) the useless Grimoire/Qabalistic tradition, or · J (b) a mis-interpreted crowleyism, or (c) of a showman/ghoulish/self-professed type with bits cobbled together from (a) and (b) with archaic myths and unenlightened egoism thrown in. The real tradition -with its darkness-J and danger -remained hidden. To (c) belonged the Church of Satan, which made Satanism akin to a fantasy role-playing game or games with some sorcery added to impress. The later schism which gave birth to the Temple of Set (born not with a bang but· J with a whimper) was not unexpected given the structure and orientation of this 'Church' -and neither was the fact that the leader of this schism based his Temple and authority on what was termed an 'Infernal Mandate',· J and declared Satanism as a religion , much mis-understood. Meanwhile, the old traditions continued, in Europe and elsewhere, in their traditional way -secretly, accepting but few novices and these only after severe · J\t tests and ordeals. The traditions, writings, rituals, methods, ordeals and techniques remained unavailable except to those few. After lengthy deliberations and consultations, the individual representing traditional groups, decided ~ to gradually make the esoteric tradition which he and others represented j J available on a selective basis, to reveal, for once and for all, what the LHP and Satanism were really about. The real impetus for this decision came from Aeonic strategy -making the tradition available would enable an increase in the number of genuine Adepts, thus hastening the presencing of the darker forces on Earth, and so fulfilling the sinister dialectic of history. This increase, however, would be gradual -over centuries. With this dissemination, the purpose, intent and methods of Satanism and the LHP could no longer be mis-interpreted and the posers and charlatans who professed to be 'Satanists' would be exposed -at least to those with any sagacity. With the secrets accessable to those who saught to find them, the real esoteric work could continue, as it always had, in secret -the training, via direct experience, of those few strong and gifted enough to undertake the difficult and dangerous journey along the Left Band Path.

It was, in a sense, a practical ordeal and its Satanic character m~ that its victims were victims of themselves: the act was akin to an act of 'natural justice'. To some, it may seem a game -and so it was, but one]\t played in earnest, in which losing meant capture and probable imprisonment (factors which made it interesting and worthwhile).

It involves real action, alone: without the support of friends, comrades, lovers, relations or anyone. 1 J It involves accepting challenges -physical, psychic, intellectual ­and triumphing soley by one's own efforts. It involves the triumph of pure, individual will and desire. b) Satanism is, in part, an inner quest, an exploration of the 'hidden' (and overt) aspects of consciousness: a dis-covery of the darkness within ] and beyond the individual psyche. This involves 'magickal acts' -such as rituals. This magick, however, is a means, not an end. c) Satanism involves ordeals, both physical and magickal. Those who arelsuitable triumph; the others fail. [One such ordeal is the Grade Ritual of• Internal Adept -where the candidate lives alone and isolated, bereft of everything except the bare necessities for physical survival, for a period of three months.] d) Satanism\t requires the practical experiencing of all moral limits, and then la mastery of the feelings, desires, pleasures, terrors, pains and so on that • these imply . e) Satanism involves the individual defiance of all subserviance: a Satanist accepts guidance only, and refuses to be dominated or intimidated by anyone. This gUidance is toward practical experience, and it by this experience that the novice learns and developes a genuine Satanic character. J f) Satanism involves sacrifice -this is a necessary test of character [qv. the MSS \"Satanism, Sacrifice and Crime -The Satanic Truth\", and \"Satanism -The Sinister Shadow, Revealed\" for more details.]. g) Satanism is a means - a method, or way, and the purpose of this means, method or way is to produce a specific type of individual: the next stage of our ... evolution as a species.

In short, a Satanist plunges into reality, without any supports (moral, psychic or human) whereas a religious person has] that reality prescribed by dogma, authority and such like, and is supported by a 'Church', its members and their attitudes. Satanism is an ecstatic affirmation of existence - a taking of existence] into new and higher realms, as well as a plunge into existing darkness and the creation of new-darkness. '\"\" ] b) Satanism cannot have anyone impose upon it any structure, authority, Ior institution of any kind by claiming a 'dark mandate' or some kind of 'revelation'. There can be no such thing as an 'infernal mandate' of whatever kind because the only thing that really matters to Satanism is -experience, its accumulation and the highly individualized learning that results from such experience. A genuine Satanist, for example, confronted by an entity which exhibited all the powers attributed to Satan wouldJ not even accept what that 'entity' said and would most certainly not show l any submission -instead, they would a defiance, a reasoned assessment of what was said, and then a judgement made from experience. A Satanist never surrenders to anything -and would rather die, proud and defiant, than sUbmit. This applies even to 'Satan'. If and when a Satanist accepts guidance, it is from someone of experience who has explicated Satanism by their life and thus who can offer adviceIbased on that experience. The aim of Satanism is to create willful, characterful, ~ defiant, unique individuals who have or can fulfil their potential as gods ­it is not to create followers or sycophants. An 'infernal mandate' impliesl\t sycophancy. c) Satanism does not involve discussions, meetings, talks. Rather, it involves action, deeds. Words -written or spoken -sometimes follow, but not I\t necessarily. The ideal candidate for Satanism is the individual of actionI j rather than the 'intellectual'. By the nature of most Satanic actions, they can seldom be mentioned and thus remain esoteric. The essence that Satanism leads the individual I\t towards, via action, is only ever revealed by that participation which action is. Words, whether written or spoken, can never describe that essence ­they can only hint at it, point toward it, and often serve to obscure the essence. Satanism strips away the appearence of 'things' -living, Occult and otherwise by this insistence on experience, unaided. What is thus apprehended by such experience, is unique to each individual and thus is creative and evolutionary. Discussions, meetings, talks, even books and such like, de-vitalize: they are excuses for not acting. A Satanist will sometimes use such forms as he/she may use the form of a Temple -to enhance and/or provoke experiences. But they are then actively manipulating, actively creating experiences -the others involved are being used by that person. That is, there is only one Satanist at such gatherings l (usually) -the others may believe they are 'Satanists', but they are deluded. I 4"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"I I, J 1 d) Satanism does not apply moral absolutes to real-life situations and forms. This may best be explicated by two examples. First, politics. Satanism does not affirm or deny any pulitical forms or type of politics ­it does not, for example, announce that 'fascism and Satanism are incompatable'. Such announcements/pronouncements arise from a moral bias and a lack of insight into both Satanism and 'society' and thus Aeonics. A Satanist, concerned with experience, may use a political form for a specific purpose -the nature of that form in terms of conventional politics and morality (such as 'extreme Right-wing') is irrelevant. What is important is whether it can be used to (a) provide experience of living and the limits of experience, and/or (b) aid the sinister dialectic of history. Thus a Satanist may become involved in, or set up, an organization of the extreme Right -this is dangerous, exciting, vitalizes, provides experiences 'on the edge' and should thus aid the development of the character and insight of that Satanist*. What is important, is that this involvement is done for an ulterior, Satanic, motive: what others think and believe about such actions is totally irrelevant. Anyone purporting to be a Satanist who criticizes such an action, whatever the political hue of the group/organization, reveals by that criticism that they are not Satanists -but rather, moralizing nurds lacking in insight and real Satanic understanding. The second example concerns the formation and use of Satanic 'Temples' and groups by a Satanist. A Satanic novice, in order to gain experience of magickal rituals and people manipulation, usually forms a group to perform Satanic rituals. The people recruited are for the most part used -and the novice often assumes a specific Satanic 'role' for this: the role of sorcerer/sorceress. He/she may dress in a certain way and so on, as he/she may use fables to impress and/or manipulate. This, however, for a genuine Satanist, is only a stage -and one which lasts a year or two. After that, experience and mastery of ceremonial and hermetic magick gained, they move on to new challenges and experiences, as all good Satanists should. Further, the individuals of this 'Temple' or group are not Satanists, although they may believe themselves to be -they are simply being used to afford the novice pleasure/excitement/experience and so on. Bad any of ther any Satanic character or potential, they would rebel to undertake their own quest by forming such a group/'Temple' and experience the limits of themselves. Sometimes, the group has another aim -an Aeonic or suprapersonal one, in which case its life may be extended. But whatever, genuine Satanic guidance by an Adept or Master/Mistress to a novice always occurs on an individualized basis, never within the rigid and constraining form of a 'Temple'. Thus, there is not nor can be any constraining rules applied to the conduct of such 'Temples' and groups -there is no 'moral code', no bounds which cannot be overstepped. The rules, such as they are, are made by the Satanic novice according to their desire and goals. That is, they can do with that group and its individuals whatever they desire to do and no one -not even the Adept/ Master/Mistress who may be guiding them -can set limits or prescribe their behaviour. They must learn for themselves -and from their mistakes, should they make some. This naturally leads to the obvious Satanic deduction that a group like the Temple of Set may contain one, perhaps two, Satanists -who are using the 'members' for their own Satanic goals. This person (or persons) would of course deny this, and if that denial was sincere, they could not be Satanists. What is certain, is that that group cannot contain more than perhaps two Satanists -for the members accept the constraints imposed upon them from above, and are servile, in both theory and practice. They are also not being led into real experiences, but accept a sterile, sanitized and safe 'Satanism' as pedalled by their leader. * It can also aid the sinister dialectic -here, an understanding of Aeonics is importani."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"l 1 -. ] e) Satanism does not seek any form of official recognition as it does not seek ~o become respectable or the prerogative of a majority. Rather, Satanism operates, and must operate, for the most part in a clandestine or •underground , manner. 'Official' recognition mean someone or some organization is granted some sort of \"status\" and thus assumes both in theory and in fact an 'authority' and an organizational structure to support it. This authority and this structure mean followers, sycophants -and contradict the essence of satanism. 'Respectability' means a moral stance broadly in line with that pertaining at the time -that is, it means a restricting morality, ethics, as well a limiting of action to what is deemed broadly 'acceptable' by the 'society' of the time. Both of these -official recognition and respectability -also mean that the self-appoint~d authority which is recognized and becomes or seeks to be respectable, sets its own limits: there is 'proscription' of other groups, a peer hierarchy and all the many trappings of herd conformity; the triumph of illusive forms over essence. In brief, the deluding of others, rather than their liberation. Since the experience of the essence that Satanism brings is unique, this uniqueness is totally contradictory to all forms that seek to constrain, define and restrict -two of these forms being 'official recognition' and 'respectability'. Some other hard facts about Satanism are in order -to be placed on record. Satanism is hard and very dangerous. This danger is much more than just a 'mental' or a psychic one of the kind sometimes experienced in magickal workings. It is a personal danger of the 'life or death' kind. If it is not, then it is not tough enough, it is not Satanic. For far too long the pathetic imitation Satanists, such as those in the Temple of Set and the Church of Satan, have had no one to contradict their sickly, wimpish versions of Satanism -they have tried to deny the darkness and evil which are essential to Satanism because the frauds in those organizations are fundamentally weak: they have never gone to their limits, never experienced the realness of evil. They have tried to make 'Satanism' safe and 'respectable': they have intellectualized it because they are typical products of this present intellectualized, peace-loving, \"we need to be safe\" society. A Satanist is like a beast of prey -in real life, not in fantasy. A Satanist may be and often is an assassin, a warrior, an outlaw -in real life. The imitation Satanists, however, pretend to be these things -their fantasy-life is greater than their real experiences of such things. A Satanist seeks and makes real his/her fantasies and then masters the real-life situations and all those desires/feelings which give birth to those fantasies -they live them and then transcend them, creating from those experiences something beyond them: a new individual. Often, things go wrong -but as always in life, the strong survive and the weak perish, are written off. The Satanist creates the dreams, standards of excellence and spirit which others often later aspire to emulate. This creation is in real life, by deeds and deeds alone. Because of this, few indeed are the genuine Satanists. Sometimes their lives (or aspects of them) become public -but often they are hidden, working their darkness in secret, for the benefit of evolution.

The Deofel Quartet are instructional texts written in fictional form. [Cheques payable to 1 Thormynd Press.] I In replying to your detailed and reasoned comments, perhaps I should start by saying that in attacking the 'intellectualism' of the Temple of Set, I am1 attacking the mostly non-practical (in terms of living) approach of that and other groups. They have made satanism seem mostly cerebral - a subject to be studied, discussed, argued about, analyzed, rather than being a practical guide to living on the edge. Their practice, such as it is, is again cerebral -magickal workings which are mostly devoid of a primal exultation, ecstasy. In short, their approach revolves essentially around abstract ideas. I am not critical of intellectualism per se - I am regarded by some as 'an intellectual', having been trained both as a scientist and a classical scholar [I have several translations-of Greek Drama to my credit]. Rather, I have tried to make clear (sometimes by exaggerating the point) that I regard Satanism first and foremost as a practical way which involves garnishing experiences of the limits of living, and learning-from those experiences -transmuting the experiences into self-insight, the development of consciousness and so on. I also believe that these experiences must be tough -must take each individual to and beyond their own limits -and that they must be done without relying on anything other than a pure defiance,-a pure strength of character. To me, it seems that both the Temple of Set and the Church of Satan provide 'props' for their members -there is dogma, an organizational structure, a sense of belonging, and the belief that Satanism is somehow a 'fantasy game' or playing at socerers. Basically, intellectualism should follow action -not prejudge it nor limit it. All the members of the ToS and the CoS I have met over the years were full of 'Satanic theory' but had little (sometimes no) experience of going to and beyond their own limits. Basically, they played at Satanism -the occassional (boring) ritual, the odd working with a magickal intent. But nowehere was there a proud, defiant, exultation in living; nowhere was there real Satanic character born from character-building experiences. There was, and is, an awful lot of discusslons, of meetings, of articles, of letters, of 'organizing' things. But try and get one of them to actually do something really Satanic in the real world -to divest themselves of the props (psychic, human and Occult) which supported them, and so return them to their primal nature -was impossible: they were too lazy or weak;J too comfortable with playing their Satanic fantasy roles and games."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"1 J ~ • .. • J -, • • • 2. Regarding my own tradition, and the question of what is and what is not 'Satanism'. I make no claim that the ONA repr~sents the only 'true form of Satanism' -it is simply one tradition among many, although it does pre-date the formation of the CoS. What I express and have expressed, is that organizations like the CoS and the ToS by their very nature actually hinder the development of those qualities which I and some others believe to be central to Satanism.By this I mean that any organization which prescribes a dogma for its members to believe, which restrains them by 'ethical conditions' and which implicitly or explicitly require those members to submit to an organizational authority/Master/leader, is not Satanic. The ToS in particular believes in Satanism as some kind of 'religion'. I, and the Mistress who Initiated me into the ONA tradition, have always seen Satanism as being individualized -concerned with building a unique character, a truely free being. An organizational structure such as possessed by the ToS contradicts this in essence, however many clever words may be used to try and hide this fact. Such organizations breed sychophancy, dependence -one has to 'conform', to a certain degree at least. Of course. I understand some of the tactical reasons which explain why the ToS, for instance, claims 'religious status' -but even these reasons, on examination, show that the adoption of these tactics are unnecessary and actually counter-productive, in terms of producing real Satanic Adepts: i.e. individualsof Satanic character who truely represent an evolutionary development. In my own tradition, for instance, it was the custom to train one, at most two, novices on an individualized basis. That is, a Satanic Master/Mistress gUided one or two novices in the way of Satanism -there was and is no organizational structure, no limiting the behaviour of those novices, only an imparting of tradition and advice born from personal experience of having oneself undergone ordeals and formative experiences in the real world. Sometimes, in undertaking an Adversarial role against the CoS and the ToS, I have been rather strident -but to provoke, to try and get others to think constructively about those organizations and the type of Satanism I believe they represent. I describe the ONA as being a 'traditional Satanist' grouping by which I mean it adheres to certain traditions -chief among these being a guiding of novices on an individualized basis, it undertakes certain rites/practices on a basis established in earlier times, and it accepts that Satan ism is dark, evil in a very real sense (one of which is that there are certain powers/ dark energies which are beyond the psyche of the individual and which can overwhelm it -which are primal). The traditions I inharited were really a mixture ­some ceremonial rituals (such as the Ceremony of Recalling), some legends regarding Albion, some beliefs concerning Baphomet as a dark goddess who was propitiated in former times by sacrifice, some methods (such as 'Insight Roles') used to develope Satanic character, and some ordeals, both practical and magickal, designed to test, to create skill, to provoke self-insight. All these I have made accessable, mostly without comment. I make no claims as to their validity, historically or otherwise. It is for others to judge them, and use them if they consider them to be useful. What I have done. is to refine what I have inherited and add to it, making ·what I believe to be a purely practical system which enables any individual prepared for the hardships and struggles, to reach Satanic Adeptship and beyond. There is no mystery or mystique about achieving Adeptship and Satanic mastery: all it takes is years of self-effort, years of experiences, years of refining abilities and learning new ones. Furthermore, there is no need for me to set myself up as some 'all-knowing' Master empowered by an Infernal Mandate or whatever. What I have done I have done because I followed the traditional way of seeking experiences and because I possessed a Satanic pride which made me survive and learn from those experiences. Many of my experiences -as befits a traditionalSatanist -were dark; an awful lot were dangerous in the 'life or death' sense. I gambled my life, everything, many times. and won."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"--lIJ -3. There is nothing very remarkable about this -or there should not be. .. -. I .. ..., I l l .. Everyone has potential (or at least most do) -but they seldom if ever realize a fraction of that potential for various reasons: they are constrained, by 'society', by their own fears and weaknesses, they are lazy, they prefer 'easy' solutions (such as sitting at the feet of some 'Master') ... To me, and some others, Satanism is a means to realize that potential, to go even beyond that. To do this, radical measures are required -and these are always testing as they are mostly in the real world. By the nature of quite a lot of my experiences, they are 'secret' -they were beyond the bounds of conventional morality and law. Thus have Satanists operated for a long time -in secret, by the very nature of their existence, by the very nature of some of the experiences that are required to transcend the conformity of the herd and the inertia of one's own psyche, and which thus are a 'Yes!' to peing. Naturally, this is dangerous -as you say, it can be an excuse for just plain foolhardiness. But a Satanist is someone who achieves a mastery -who experiences, and then, learning from that experience , transcends it. It is the failures who become trapped (in their own desires and their limited perceptions, for instance). So some fail ­they obviously were not possessed of enough Satanic qualities. That is the nature of our existence -the tough win through, the weak perish. It is not for me or anyone to limit, to prescribe, to forbid -the selection occurs by itself, by 'trial and error'. Each individual must learn for themselves -this is the crux. No one can do it for them. The essence, born via experiences, cannot be learnt from books, it caanot even be taught -it must be experienced. All I and any genuine Master can/~~ give advice, perhaps suggest some experiences which may be interesting and suitable -but the novice must undertake the experiences. If they learn from them, fine. There are more experiences and adventures waiting. If they fail, for whatever reason, or do not learn from the experience -tough! In respect of politics. You mention that if a Satanist used politics, he or she never could achieve political success because Satanism is so unpopular. Naturally, if that Satanist was known as a Satanist -but if he/she kept this secret, as many do and have done, there is no problem. Of course there might be a danger of being 'exposed' as a Satanist -but that in itself is a challenge: to work under \"deep cover\". It requires a special person, certain skills - a Satanic character, in fact. I know of one particular person, many years ago, who did just that, until his aims were achieved. However, my general point concerned a novice who might get involved with politics as a learning experience -for perhaps a year or so. This experience is quite different from that resulting from announcing, publicly, that one is a Satanist (this in itself is an experience which some Satanic novices choose to learn from). To become involved in extreme politics provides many opportunities for manipulating others (speaking in public; writing propaganda); for testing one's courage (participating in a rally/march where one's opponents are in the majority and threaten violence); for learning about comradeship and betrayal. And so on. Further, although fascism as a creed had some links with the Nazarene Church, National-Socialism was, in essence, contradictory to Nazarene philosophy and ways of living. Most modern and authentic National-Socialist groups are anti-Nazarene (as witness Matt Koehl's 'New Order' in the US). But, essentially, the question is not about a particular type of political world-view, be it fascism or whatever, being contradictory or not to Satanism. The question is about all political forms being forms -structures which can be used, for a Satanic purpose, to achieve Satanic goals. 'The question of what might happen to individuals within a certain type of State is only a short-term question, and its asking implies a lack of what I have called 'Aeonic insight'. Basically, Aeonics is a study of those processes which mould individuals and socieities over long periods of time -how people, alone and in groupings, have been and can be manipulated, changed, controlled. It is study of those enerq~es which affect and infect the psyche and which produce and change archetypal forms."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"l 4. ----I ] ] ... --J ] J l ~ and which thus mould character -and thus make 'history'. Aeonics has nothing to do with Crowley. It is a rational analysis of the causes underlying historical change, and Aeonic Magick is the use of magickal energies to effect aeonic change -i.e. change on a large scale over significant periods of time. Basically, Satanic strategy (or 'the sinister dialectic of history' as it is sometimes called) is about using such energies to bring changes broadly in line with Satanic aims -i.e. enable individuals to fulfil their potential, evolve to become like gods and so on.This strategy is based on reality -both in terms of the energies used, and 'human nature'. Therefore, the goals are seen as long term -of centuries of more. The aim has been and is to increase the number of genuine Satanic Adepts, and to provide changes which enable this. Thus, it will be seen that Satanism, when understood correctly, is not soley about self-advancement ~ it is also about using magickal and non-magickal forms/energies to produce changes within societies which incline toward the fulfilment of Satanic aims. This does not mean a kind of 'altruism' -it means a calculating, reasoned assessment and then a striving and working toward certain long-term goals, this assessment and this striving actually enhancing our existence in a positive, Satanic way. In the simple sense, it may be considered as Satanic manipulation on a large scale. The assessment itself, and the reasoned understanding behind it, requires the development of special abilities -one of which may be said to be 'Thought'. This is a development of our consciousness, and leads beyond language. It is a special kind of 'thinking' - a thinking with symbols, although the symbols are not abstract, as in mathematics, but rather 'numinous', archetypal. Essentially, it extends the range of our being. This type of thinking is pre-figured, and made possible by, 'The Star Game' - a collocation of symbols which extends both our intuitive and our reasoning faculties. The mastery of this 'game', and thus the use of a new way of reasoning/being, is a sign that one has taken evolution further -has become almost a new type of 'human', one so far above the majority that it is difficult to conceive one ever belonged to or related to that majority. This rational analysis of Aeonics leads to certain judgements, a lot of which are mis-coJtrued by those who call themselves Satanists because they understand 4 those judgements on a personal basis -usually castigating the individual or group which presents them from what is essentially a 'moral' position. That is, there is a 'projection', by those Satanists (and Occultists in general), onto the forms/judgements that they cannot really understand because their perspective is so limited -so caught up in the constraints of their time and society. This is what I meant by 'cosy, intellectual and basically moral abstractions'. Most who profess to be Satanists cannot see very far -they cannot reason, coldly and unemotionally and deeply. They accept other people's abstractions and ideas and 'reasons' and have not thought the matter out for themselves because it is either too difficult for them or they (once again) are too lazy, too smug, too self-satisfied, too comfortable in their little 'Satanic' world with their 'Satanic' friends. This judgement is part of genuine Satanic character, and arises from the self-insight born via hard, testing experiences and ordeals. A Satanist has to strip everything away -all props, go right back to the primal. This means he/she relies only their instinct, their character, their spirit -their inner resolve. This process takes years -and then, and only then, can the person acquire the other aspects a Satanist needs and must have: the 'intellectual' super-structure, the new ways of being, one of which I mentioned above (vide 'The Star Game'), the skills in magickal and people arts. What has happened is that this foundation, this hard foundation, is lacking in nearly all modern 'Satanists' -they are too soft, have not been toughened, they rely too much on the comforts of society, on what others (like Aquino et all have glven them in terms of principles, beliefs, dogma and so on. Hence, when I say that National-Socialist Germany aided the sinister dialectic, it is mls-understood: as me being a 'National-Socialist' or something of the kind. I am simply stating a fact of Aeonics -as I do when I say that a future State or"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"] 5. -Empire which was inspired by National-Socialism would also aid the achievement of Satanic aims, over centuries. Others, who perhaps have not reasoned deeply about such things, express naive views like a new Satanic age is just around the corner and that politics hinders the coming of this age. I know the reality of human nature and the times in which we live, and I know most people todaY are little different from what they were thousands of years ago (in some ways, we have lost something -as I am aware when I read Homer or Sophocles). They have hardly evolved at all -there is more illusion about 'inner progress' and conscious evolution than there is reality. In fact, the -I\t Occult in general fosters this illusion. Thus I understand that real change arises slowly -most people still delude themselves, are still in thrall to unconscious influences, still swayed by appearence. Our whole modern world ] ] conspires to make this so -magick, and particularly the Left Hand Path, is a means to the essence behind appearence: or rather, it was. Its awe, primal nature, its inspiration, its dark numinosity can really liberate and change. Thus my castigation of those who I see as pedalling a 'safe Satanism', an easy path to liberation -they destroy the one thing capable of liberating those in thrall. And they do it (a) to glorify they own ego, and (b) because they have not understood the way itself.-I trust this willig! interest and perhaps thought-provoking, and look forward to your comments.i ] l ] l ~ ­I !"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"-.. .. 'w :w .. • .. .. .. .­Shrewsbury Shropshire England 28th May 1992 eh Dear Ms Vera, Further to my recent letter, perhaps a few more comments might clarify the position of the DNA, and be of interest to you. . By making certain material available -on s~crifice, for example -and by writing c~rtain MSS dealing with that and other 'dark' topics, I and others have done two things. First, made it clear that such material is part of my tradition and that it recounts what was/is done. Second, returned to Satanism that darkness and evil which really belongs to it (at least in the novice stage) . I have no desire to give Satanism a 'good name' -on the contrary. I wish it to be seen as I understand it to be -really dangerous and difficult. Naturally, many others believe the publication of certain material is mistaken, just as those who oppose Satanism have and can use that material to confirm their views on Satanism. The decision to make such material available was made only after considerable thought with full knowledge of the consequences. Of course, I may be mistaken - I make no claim to be 'infernally infallible'. I welcome positive discussion -the dialectic of learning. My thesis re the nature of certain practices which I inherited is open to discussion, an 'antithesis', from which a new synthesis and understanding may emerge. But all those in other Satanic organizations have done is 'proscribe' the DNA, or attack me personally or mount campaigns of dis-information against the DNA. The whole attitude of such groups, as befits their nature, is patronising -vide Aquino, in his letter to me of October 7 XXV: he, the Master or teacher, and I a student (of potential!) under his guidance and submitting to the rules of the TOS. He, and others, have stated that human sacrifice is not and never has been a part of Satanism. Well, it probably is not and never has been a part of~ traditions -but it was/is a part of my own tradition, according to principles laid down a long time ago regarding the victim or opfer choosing themselves, the act then being akin to an act of 'natural justice'. [qv. the MSS 'Satanism, Sacrifice and Crime'; 'Satanism -The Sinister Shadow, Revealed'; A Gift for the Prince' etc. I shall send you copies of some of these, since they may be of interest.] As with many things, sacrifice can be miscontrued. The affirmation that it has occurred as part of one Satanic tradtion at least can be taken up by those weaklings (in terms of character) who circulate around the fringes of the Left Hand Path, and give them an excuse to indulge in criminal acts. That is, such people fail to understand the reasons for such acts (the correct choice of opfer, for instance) as they can never rise above their own weaknesses. Are these consequences my responsibility, or not? Or am I acting like a Satanist (my kind, anyway) and standing back, perhaps with laughter, when a probable consequence becomes a fact? Does this unsettle you? Horrify you? Does this provoke a challenge and make you question the nature of Satanism? The same applies to the use of politics. Is it worth the death of x number of others (in a war, say) to give birth to one, perhaps two, genuine Satanic Adepts?I would answer in the affirmative. Does that make me cruel? Or Satanlc? .­"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"2. Also, I do not believe it to be necesary nor desirable for Satanism to try and become respectable -or even improve its image. Nor even to try and count~r the propaganda of the Nazarene fundamentalists. Such things are irrelevant. What matters is presenting the essence ot Satanism so enabling individuals to work at their own self-development in a Satanic way. As I mentioned before, Satanism fundamentally means individuals striving togo beyond what they are. This is hard, and means that not many will attempt it: even fewer will be successful. The means cannot be made easier ­for that would destroy the essence. Thus, the ONA is in conflict with groups like the ToS who really want to make Satanism easy and safe and thus become rather more widespread than it is now. It is personal, direct experience, ordeals and so on, which are important. For instance, to achieve Adeptship the ONA believes each individual must undergo certain formative experiences. One of these involves living alone, in an ~solated location, for three months with only the bare necessities required for physical survival. These conditions are necessary, for by so living in such a way the individual strips away all self-illusions,j exposes all their inner weaknesses, and makes them reliant only on themselves . There are no distractions, no friends to give comfort, no material comforts to soften the hardship. This [which is the Grade Ritual of Internal Adeptl is tough. But it is the key to Adeptship. There is no short cut, no easy way. To succeed in this ordeal, the individual must have or develope an infernal strength, a certain character. Naturally, many fail -some renounce their Satanism, some find excuses for giving up. But one either stays the distance, observing the conditions of harshness, or one does not. Many are they who have said that this ordeal is not necessary -they believe there are other ways (all easier, of course), or they are afraid of confronting themselves without the supports normally around them: friends, lovers, organizations, dogma, material comforts. They and others like them can believe what they wish -but that particular ordeal works: it produces a strong, insightful character ready for the new challenges which can inspire an Adept. Or it destroys. I understand Adeptship not as a reward given by someone else (such as Aquino) for what they perceive as 'progress' or 'ability', nor even as the undertaking of any kind of ritual at the end of which one congratulates oneself and appoints oneself as 'Adept'. Rather, it is the achievement of a certain self-insight and knowledge, allied to an understanding and judgement born of experience. It is also mastery of certain skills (some magickal, some not-magickal) and a developed awareness stemming from a synthesis of rational understanding (or 'intellectualism') and intuition. It is a stage in the Satanic way of living - a stage reached by self-effort and struggle. A Master (or Mistress) is a stage beyond this -there is no gift, infernal or otherwise, which confers the attributes of this stage of individual evolution. It is achieved, by the individual, not a reward and certainly not a self-appointed title assumed after a few years playing at Satanism and safe magick. However, it is true that present conditions are more favourable toward the propagation of Satanism than was the case decades ago. But even were direct 'persecution' and anti-Satanic laws to return, Satanism would continue: it would re-adopt the practices of those decades. The cell system: the oral transmission: 'deep cover'. Novices would still be trained: goals would still be aChieved. So 'favourable' conditions are not necessary -indeed, some see them as detrimental: they make organizations like the CoS possible! These present conditions provide some opportunities -of increasing the number of genuine practioners of the Black Arts and of making available for present and future generations the methods and techniques of those Arts. The real aims of Satanism will be achieved whatever the external forms our socleties may take -Satanists, like the shape-changers they are, will adapt and prosper. These aims are essentially two-fold: continuing the tradition (i.e. training Adepts; providing opportunities for seeding Satanism), and gradually changing evolution."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"] 3. The second of these will actually arise from the first -the changes will occur because of the increasing number of Adepts. These may be likened to a new species which at first is small in number but which, over decades and] centuries, increases. In time, it will dominate. The first arises because it is one of the obligations of each new Adept to find someone suitable and gUide them toward Adeptship. These changes will, as I explained in my last J letter, take time -centuries, in fact. There is no way the process can be J speeded up -each individual must acquire the knowledge, the character, the experiences, for themselves, and this takes time. It takes less time now than it did -because we understand more, we are more conscious of what we are 1 actually doing (or at least some of us are). It is possible and indeed probable that over the next century or so the time taken to reach Adeptship and the stages beyond will be reduced. But the situation at the moment is as it is. A century ago it took perhaps twenty or thirty years of one's life to achieve real Adeptship. Now, it. can take as little as five to ten years. What has not changed (at least yet) is the number who reach that stage. AsI wrote many years ago, most people want easy solutions, they want someone to do the work for them, to confer titles on them -or they are so comfortable with their illusions and delusions (regarding their magickal abilities and their self-insight, for instance) that they see no reason to change, to really struggle; to reach toward Adeptship. All I can do is point the way -offer some guidance. It is up to each individual whether they begin the quest, and having begun, whether they succeed.l l The fundamental questions which should be asked are: what, fundamentally, is Satanism? What does it mean in terms of the life of the individual? What does it mean in terms of society? The ONA offers some answers. Organizations like the ToS give other answers, some of which contradict the ONA ones. Each individual must arrive at their own assessment. The ONA offers a practical 1 system which I and others know from experience works -at least in producing our kind of Satanist! The ONA is critical and controversial: it is provoking, Adversarial, occassionally irreverent. This in itself is creative. It engenders response.l Once again, I would welcome your response to the matters raised in this letter and the various MSS.

An open (rather friendly) reply to some of the points you raised has been sent to the Editor - I am sure he would send you a copy should you be interested.J However, tQere are some points which perhaps are best raised in a private letter. First -and perhaps inconsequential out of its context -no one has everJ\t claimed to be 'Head' of the ONA: no such position exists. Your statement on this was somewhat surprising because I felt you would be above using 'Kennel' type tacticsJ\t re mis-information about other LHP individuals and groups. Am I mistaken? Or perhaps the information was supplied by a not altogether too reliable scource here in the U.K.? Second -and most important -your mention of theJ\t MSS concerning sacrifice. These were published basically because they form part of an esoteric tradition, which tradition was being made accessable to those who mightJ\t be interested following a decision to publish Order methods, teachings and traditions. Essentially, such publication lets others decide what is or is not worthwhile or valuableJ\t or interesting from an esoteric point of view -there is not, within the ONA, any control of esoteric information as a result of one or more individuals deciding what is 'right' or 'true teaching' -simply because individualityJ\t is the foundation 9f the \"ONA way!'. This way is the development of self-insight and magickal mastery via individuals following the seven-fold way.] But this background aside, you raise an interesting point in your use of the term 'ethical'. Does Satanism have ethics? And if so, what are they and who formulates]\t them? By the nature of the Temple of Set I am led to assume the answer would be affirmative and that it is the ToS which formulates these. Is this assumption incorrect? If it is not, then I and some others would offer dissent ­l\t based not only on the principle of individuality mentioned above but also on the reality of there existing divergent LHP and Satanic traditions (some of which existed before 1 l the foundation of the Church of Satan). Speaking for myself, I consider debate about ethics futile in a LHP context -except to express the obvious Satanic assertion (qv 'The Dark Forces' in \"Fenrir\" 4) that one essential personal quality is honour born from the quest for self-excellance and self-understanding. One either has this personal quality (or the potential to possess it) or one does not: intellectual debate about it is irrelevant. This quality is expressed by the way of living an individual follows and as far as the ONA is concerned this quality is one of those that marks the genuine Satanic elite from the imitation. Yet we accept that others may disagree S1nce we feel there can be no religious dogma about Satanism1 or the LIIP: no subserviance to someone else I s ideas or \\\"ays •"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"I of living. Each individual developes their own unique perspective and insight as a consequence of striving to achieve Adeptship - a perspective and insight which derives mainly from practical experie~lce, both ma~ickal and personal. Thus we uphold anarchism. Hence the publication of the many and various Order MSS. Yet, all this notwithstanding, I do understand that some may believe that tactically the time was not right to publish some of these }ISS. However, is the time ever right? Once again, some interesting questions arise. For example, for the benefit of those groups (like the ToS) which do adopt a high media profile, is it necessary and indeed desirable for other ~roups and individuals on the LHP to restrict what they say and teach and publish in case such things are mis-interpreted and/or distorted and used against the L~~ in general? This would imply some sort of concensus among those individuals and groups on the LHP - a concenus which it seems bothJ\t the ToS and the Church of Satan wish to achieve by ·claiming a religious 'authority'. To this end there seems to be developing an almost Church-like mentality -with schisms and prohibitions and proscribing of other groups and individuals. Rather 'Old Aeon' values. If such a concensus is indeed necessary (and I and some others have doubts whether it is) then it would seem better achieved on a mutual basis by recognition of diversity and traditions and then the duvelopment of mutual understanding rather than one 6rouP trying to impose its dogma by a religious type belief: such dogma and such belief being entirely contrary to the basic principles of Satanism and the LHP -self-development via self-experience. I and others like me respect your right to promulgate the ~etian philosophy just as I trust you have the sagacity to understand that what La Vey codified and what the early Church of Satan represented is not the only form Satanism can take. Satanism existed in many forms long before La Vey, and the ONA simply represents one such form: a form that has changed and is still changing ­develooed as it is and has been by creative individuals within it. As I mentioned to you in a pr~vious letter some time ago, this does not mean we claim to be a 'peer' or~ani~ation with a claim to some kind of 'authority'. je are simply a small ~roup following our own way - a \\'iay some,.,hat different from that developed by the Church of Satan and the ToS. Our tradition, such as it is, is not static -indeed in many ways the most significant developments (e.g. the Star Game, Grade Ritual codification, Oeofil Quartet) have occurred quite recently. Doubtless these developments will continue. When in the past we and others like us have said ...\t things that others interpret as being 'against' the ToS or La Vey, ,.,e were simply assuming the role of Adversary ­challenging what seemed to be becoming accepted dogma that the only 'real' Satanists are either in the ToS or the Church of Satan. Such a dogma is an historical absurdity and its acceptance an affront to the Satanic desire to know and understand and not meekly believe.

It was also responsible for a more serious kind of damage. It enabled Anton LaVey to announce policies in the name of a fictitious \"Council of Nine\", or in the name of a fictitious official, and thus to escape personal responsibility for his actions. Nor was there any executive body or other official to whom he was accountable.

And of course it plays right into the hands of any anti-Satanic maniac who is looking for \"evidence\" of \"Satanic ritual murder\". Your argument I-that the C.N.A. does not consider itself responsible for such uses may satisfy you, but it certainly doesn't satisfy the Temple of Set as guardian of this religion. l-Indeed Satanism is an ethical religion, and yes, I do consider the Temple of Set the institution consecrated by Set to establish and maintain such an ethical] environment - which is carefully developed in the Crystal Tablet ofSet. As a non-Initiate of the Temple, you are of course at liberty to dissent from this J\t ethical standard. But neither, by your non-Initiatory status, does the Temple consider you a member of the SetianfSatanic religion. You are, in our eyes, simply one more individual affecting \"Satanism\" as a personal hobby. In this you may be more or less skilled, more or less articulate, more or less artistic: these we do not judge. But what we do judge is that in all of this you have not been Recognized by the Temple which exclusively is consecrated by Set. We consider the Temple a sacred -institution, not just one of a number of \"Satanic clubs\" around the world. From 1966 to 1975 CE we held precisely this view concerning the Church of Satan, which welcomed the interest and enthusiasm of amateur \"Satanists\" and \"Satanic\" groups such as the C.N.A. but considered only its own membership and Priesthood formally deserving of the religious titles they held.

But others are quite serious and sophisticated, and deserve our respect and admiration - which are quite freely given where due. Some, upon encountering the Temple of Set, have voluntarily dissolved and commended their membership to it. Some have retained their independent structure and interests while at the same time encouraging/allowing their members to affiliate with the Temple as a formal religion. Some have simply gone their own way, maintaining a polite non-acceptance of the Temple's avowed Infernal Mandate. The distinction we draw in all cases is dictated simply by our sacred regard for the Priesthood of Set, and the Temple under its care, as established by Set in the Book o/Coming Forth by Night. If we did not draw that distinction, then we would ..\t be, at our heart, an insincere and fraudulent religion. Therefore the exclusiveness of the Temple of Set is not born of either arrogance ..\t or competitiveness, but simply of the utter seriousness with which we regard ourselves. It is this same attitude which makes the Temple of Set reject any \"council of churches\", occult or conventional, for the simple reason that we consider our .. religion correct and theirs incorrect.

I appreciate your comments and before passing on to specific points raised, would like to make some general comments. What I sense (and I use the word advisedly) is that you and I, despite our differing methods, are fundamentally trying to achieve the same thing. I here mean in terms of 'esoteric' magick and not in terms of outward terms or expressions. We are both aware of the potential inherent within individuals and how certain forms, magickal or otherwise, can be used to explicate that potential, bringing thus an evolution of consciousness both individual and beyond the individual. Thus are individuals, and 'society', changed over varying periods of time. You have established and maintained an organization and imbued it with certain forms, which forms via their various transformations, create and establish conditions for changes in tune with certain energies. Because of the nature of this organization, and the energies, there is a need to maintain a coherence, a magickal continuity and thus the establishment of a system which protects the viability of all aspects. As to myself, I deal with similar forms but make them manifest in a different way -building in to some of those manifestations a random or 'chaotic' element and into others a 'numinous' aspect. Thus, further forms are developed, in both causal and acausal time, and achieve certain goals, some of which are quite long-term (beyond my own temporal lifetime at the earliest). All these energies are 'sinister' (or Left Hand Path, if you prefer) -at the most simple level this means they enhance our creative evolution; at another, it means they 'disrupt' already existing forms which may hinder such evolution and explication of individual potential. \\ihere we might (and seem to) differ is in our respective time-scale for fundamental change and in making some elements more manifest than others, to achieve specific ends. Of course, I accept that my understanding may not be complete (and might possibly be incorrect on some points) as I assume that you, claiming the title 'Ipssisimus', understand the preceeding four paragraphs without me having to elaborate at lengtho You have accepted a \"role\" ,'Ii thin the Temple of Set with all the duties and obligations implied, and there is much to admire in this. This of necessity means adhering to the principles of what you describe as the 'sacred trust' placed in you vis-a-vis the 'Infernal ~landate'. Thus there is a religious attitude and acceptance. All this I myself regard as natural and necessary, given i"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"2.] ] the vehicle chosen -that is, the Temple o~ Set. The way of the ONA is, however, quite di~~erent -we see our way] as guiding a ~ew individuals to sel~-awareness, to Adeptship and beyond, via various practical and magickal techniques. The emphasis is on guide, on sel~-devlopment, on sel~­discovery. There is no religious attitude, no acceptanceJ\t of someone else's authority, and no mystique: the methods, as divulged in the recently published book 'Naos', are essentially practical. All this arises ~rom the understanding that changes such as I mentioned earlier (regarding individual potential) will occur slowly and ~or the most part on a small scale ~or some time to come: bringing changes to 'society' (aJ\t generalization here, ~or brevity) -and thus to larger numbers o~ individuals -on the timescale o~ a century or more.J The present aim o~ the ONA is to make these techniques ­which give all individuals the means to achieve the next stage o~ individual evolution should they so wish ­more generally availableo These techniques (the Grade Rituals ~or example, and the Star Game) will probably and indeed should be re~ined and extended in the ~uture, as they have been refined in their creation over the past1\t decade or so. Older techniques, inherited by me, have served their purpose -and to an extent have made possible the present advances, including preparing the way, on the1\t level o~ mystique, ~or a dissemination o~ the 'new'. To be more explicit -an 'aura' was created around the ONA (quite deliberately) by using certain methods, magickal ~orms, and by publishing certain material. This aura, existing,1\t becomes trans~ormed -and serves a very use~ul purpose on the acausal level. (In simple terms and on an elementary level, it provides a certain impetus to seek out and try1 the 'new' techniques, the 'new' way -on the level o~ individuals.) Thus, as the new techniques (and hence the new ~orms]\t deriving ~rom them)become more widely distributed, via books such as Naos, the Deo~il Quartet and the Black Book o~ Satan (these last two due ~or publication this Winter Solstice) then the methods used hitherto are no1\t longer needed, and are abandoned -they have served their purpose. It is the same with the ONA: once the techniques and the essence are more widely available then 'membership'l\t as such is irrelevant, since everything is available and accessable (and this includes past methods and teachings) ­the individual taking responsibility ~or their own development, their own experiences (both magickal andl personal). This is the ~undamental point: the responsibility for development ultimately rests with individual desire, just as each individual must make their own assessment o~l\t what is valuable and what is 'ethical/just' ~rom their own experience, it being the aim o~ the techniques o~ the seven-~old sinister '~ay to provide the character-building,1\t evolutionary, experiences. There is no pre-judgement by me or anyone, no set o~ rules. The ~unction of the ONA is now to guide, simply because its members have undergone the experiences of the way and can speak ~rom a positionl\t of experience -an experience which mayor may not be of value to others. Thus the ~undamental di~~erence in our approach. It was -1"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"~. made quite clear to the former Temple of Set Priest you mentioned that each individual is expected to work on the practical level to achieve his or her own magickal development -to actually practice magick, to use magickal and other techniques, rather than just talk about them. This takes quite a number of years, and is a personal effort. Most people cannot be bothered -they want easy solutions -and most people who enquired in the past about the ONA were not prepared to work toward their own self-development. They either wanted someone else to do it for them (be such a someone a 'Master' or an Infernal ~1anifestation) or would not/could not undertake the life-style change necessary for achieving genuine Adeptship (such as spending three months alone under special conditions). Ultimately, their loss. I, for one, do not believe th.reis a 'religious' solution to Adeptship and beyond - a gift, Infernal or otherwise. There is only self-experiencing, in the real and the magickal worlds, and that is it. Wisdom is acquired by the alchemical process of internal change over a period of time: the techniques developed by the ONA may shorten that time from several decades to perhaps a decade or just under, but they do not do away with it, just as those techniques make the possibility of such change available to all. For this reason, the ONA does not attempt to define what is or is not of the Left Hand Path and what is or is not Satanism (or even what Satan is) -each individual arrives at their own understanding via experience. Occassionally, as I have mentioned, there may be the adoption of an adversarial role in order to attack accepted (or even unconscious) dogmas within the broad spectrum of the LHP movement -but that is as it should be, for individuals questing after knowledge lfho refuse to meekly believe. Once again, a 'role' is only a role, played out in the quest for understanding. On the specific point of membership -yes, there is more than one (not that it really matters anymore now that dissemination is being achieved). Not many, it is true, but enough -some only beginning their quests, some more advanced along the way: in this country, in Scandinavia, in the countries of Europe and elsewhere. Of course, all this may confirm your opinion that the ONA is not 'Satanic' (or 'Setian' -this latter I would agree with). Do you therefore understand 'Satanism' as now the exclusive preserve of. the Temple of Set because of the 'Infernal ~!andate' you mentioned? If so, this raises rather interesting questions regarding 'Infernal' authority, revelation and such like -questions partly answered by your use of the term .religion. l{hat then of Satanic organizations which existed before the revelation: such as (to take an odd example) the Order of Satanic Templars here in England which existed (and was undertaking Initiations) before the establishment of the Church of Satan?(It later became known as the Orthodox Temple of the Prince.) Personally, I see Satanism more as a way of living than as a religion: an attitude to life, and one which is ultimately personal, striving to ever more."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"•••••••••••••••• -' 1 J J J J J l I 1 However, as mentioned above, I believe our ultimate goals are the same even though our methods may differ. Of course in this, as in many things, I may be mistaken: I claim no authority, and my creations, profuse as they are, will in the end be accepted or rejected on the basis of whether they work (Satan forbid they should ever become 'dogma' or a matter of 'faith'). I also expect to see them become transformed, by' their own metamorphosis and that due to other individuals: changed, extended and probably utlimately transcended, may be even forgotten.

Cordially yours, ~ / [Editorial Note: In view of the controversy in Occult circles about using 'pseudonyms' and the desire of certain groups to operate 'underground' without media scrutiny - a subject mentioned by Dr. Aquino in his letters and since taken up by a number of others both within and without the LHP ­the following observations are in order: ·It has been for many centuries an established principle among LHP Adepts to work in a reclusive manner in 'secret'. The reason for this is basically two-fold: the magickal work is mis-understood by 'outsiders' [ and often by such people catagorized from their own social/political/religious perspectives] and to try and explain it to non-Initiates was seen as a waste of time; and, secondly, it enabled that work to be undertaken without hindrance from interfering indiViduals and officials. Without this secrecy, the LHP would not have survived. Today, conditions have changed somewhat, but still not enough in some areas. • A labyrinth was created to confuse the merely curious and those seeking to disrupt the magickal work and tradition. • Quite often, LBP Adepts have a 'seperate professional' life (which in some cases is part of their long-term magickal goals) and the 'stigma' of involvement with magick would be detrimental to that. Quite often this seperate life is beneficial to the evolution of the 'Occult' in general as it provides opportunities for dissemination (mostly clandestine). That Some individuals have gone 'public' is fair enough -that is their decision. But those who prefer or need to work 'underground' in order to continue their own reclusive and secret traditions should not be castigated for in many cases they are guardians who can never have a 'public' Occult role.

Expressed esoterically, the aim is to aid the creationJ\t of a 'New Aeon' wherein what is now known as Adept-type consciousness and abilities are the preserve of the majority. This aim is long-term: c.3-S centuries . .J .J This aim involves keeping opening already existing nexions, and opening new nexions, these nexions effectively drawing forth acausal (or sinister) energies. The energy is then directed to achieve specific goals, or left to disperse and disrupt according to its nature. Exoterically, this aim is 'The Return of the Dark Gods' and the creation of a Satanic Age and a Satanic Empire on Earth. To achieve this aim, various tactics, or means, are required. Some are: J J *Existing power structures and thus societies need to be disrupted and re-shaped, enabling some of them to be used to create a Satanically inspired society or societies. *The means and techniques of achieving Adeptship, and thus real individual freedom, need to be made known, thus enabling an upturn in genuine Adepts. These Adepts will form an elite, and from this elite influence will beJ gained and the sinister implemented. Some of this elite may well take or hold or influence various forms of political power in the future when disruption/destabilization occurs on a large scale. Each of these involves certain specific things. For instance, a Satanically J J inspired society could well be of a fascist/National Socialist type -i.e. this type of society would achieve or could achieve certain Satanic goals either directly or via the dialectic of change, and thus aid the ultimate goal: a New, Satanic, Aeon. Accordingly, such views and the organizations upholding them would be aided, mostly secretly. Esoterically, the creation of an Imperium by a charismatic individual (Vindex) would be aided both by magickal means and more directly. Vindex would be a nexion for the dark forces. Essentially, NS type politics is considered as, at this moment of aeonic time, aiding the sinister dialectic, and an NS society as one of the first stages in changing evolution toward the sinister on a large scale. One of the primaryJ goals of Imperium must be the conquest of Space. [This assessment arises from Aeonics.J The disruption of existing forms is necessary, whatever tactics (such as]\t politics) are used to aid the sinister Aeon. Disruption means the destablization of societies -particuarly Western ones, where global power at present resides. On the practical level, this means that the societies must be made the breeding ground for the tactical forms chosen. The peoples must yearn for someth~ -andJ\t what they yearn for must be given to them. That is, their instinctive yearning will be controlled, psychically, via sinister Adepts. They will be made ready, psychically and practically, for what power-structures are required.J\t To achieve this, various archetypal energies must be used and directed, and some implanted in the 'collective unconscious' (e.g. by using archetypes ­manipulating them -and creating new archetypal forms). J\t Further, societies must be destabilized on the practical level. This will be achieved in two ways -via using sinister magickal energies, and by aiding practical disruption. The first means an increase in chaotic type energies: sinister random energies which infect susceptible individuals and drive them to]\t do certain things, to disrupt, cause chaos, spread evil and so on. The second means aiding those things which will undermine societies -e.g. drugs, pornography, crime, political unrest, economic misfortune, racial and other social tensions (including religious ones). Of paramount importance is disrupting those large, influential power structures, the United States of America and the Soviet Union!

That is, without these two power structures, contending rival States would emerge both within Europe and world-wide. There would be many wars as long-suppressed conflicts were fought out, just as] the naturally strong and aggressive would re-assert themselves by using force. ~ In short, natural forces would take over.

The former involves directing magickal energies at the power structures and seeding susceptible minds with certain disruptive/chaotic/directed forms: e.g. the performance of rites, both ceremonial and hermetic, with] specific aims. [Exoterically, the Dark Gods would be invoked, via Nine Angles type I ~ rites, and sent to disrupt/provoke change.] The latter is more restricted, at the time of writing, due to lack of practical influence in that sphere -but three areas to encourage are: 1) The dissemination of Satanic ideas in the countries under Soviet control/influence and in countries where influence can be spread into those countries (e.g. Eastern Europe); 2) The spread of heretical views-1 (e.g. with regard to National Socialism, the Holocaust etc.); 3) Aiding the emergence/influence of Islam to undermine Communist ideology/Nazarene ideals in certain areas. In the case of America, the tactics are similar -to use magickal forces,1 and to encourage overt disruption. The former involves directing energies both chaotic and sinister to infect others; spreading Satanic ideas and methods (e.g. by making available rituals and the ideas of Satanism); and undertaking rites appropriate to destabilizing both individuals and the power structures in1 general. The latter involves supporting various organizations and groups ­on both sides of the political spectrum (to enhance disruption/breakdown); spreading subversive and heretical ideas (e.g. National Socialism); and1 generally trying to break down the society from within -this involves encouraging drugs, crime, and such like (which will provoke not only breakdown, but which will also provoke a reaction, which reaction will become more extreme as theJ breakdown becomes more extreme, this reaction aiding the emergence of natural forces and instincts). Whatever means are necessary can and should be used -the aim is to cause the American State structure to collapse, creating chaos, from which a reaction will emerge, this reaction being of a certain type -i.e. l J tending toward authoritarianism, anti-Nazarene in essence. This collapse of American power will free the world, and enable at present suppressed forces to emerge and take control, which forces will be beneficial to the long-term goals. Nowhere will this be more evident than in the 'Middle-East'. A tide of Islamic fundamentalism would bring great changes, enabling a beneficial alliance between the new power structure which should emerge in America. What applies to both America and the Soviet Union applies to Europe -but America and the Soviet Union have priority at present, at least in terms of magickal energies. That is, the attack occurs on all levels, in Europe, America, the Soviet Union and world-wide (particuarly in the Middle-East)*-but if rescources are or become stretched for whatever reason or reasons, America and the Soviet -Union have priority. J Adepts will immediately understand that even if the strategic aim is not achieved, the disruption/chaos caused in trying to achieve it by some of the1 tactics mentioned, will be Satanic. All such tactics pay homage to Satan!

I-\tConcerning the Temple of Set ~ J The Temple of Set, as both its High Priest and its members admit, understands what they regard as Satanism as a religion. Further, the fundamental basisJ\t on which the Temple was founded is the 'Infernal Mandate' • This mandate, it is claimed, was given to Aquino by the Prince of Darkness Himself (in his manifestation as Set) and, it is said, makes the priesthood of that Temple the only one]\t consecrated by the Prince of Darkness -that is, only the Temple of Set is a true representation of Satanism. The Temple sees itself as a sacred guardian -it has a 'sacred duty' because its High Priest has been chosen by the Prince of Darkness.] However, these two things -which so define the Temple of Set -show that it cannot be a genuine Satanic organization. To prove this, we will consider each of these things in turn -first, the question of an· 'Infernal Mandate', andJ then the question of Satanism as a Religion. Aquino maintains he has a 'sacred duty' because of the mandate, and that]\t this mandate gives him authority to consecrate his Priesthood. Further, he claims that only this Priesthood is truely consecrated to the Prince of Darkness. What this means in practice, is that the Temple of Set has set itself up to be the unique representative of Satanism.] In reality, Aquino claims to have received a Mandate during some magickal working and thereby claims authority. A genuine Satanist, on the contrary, has authority by virtue of his or her Wisdom - and has achieved Wisdom by virtue of ] ] practical experience. There is no need to claim a 'spiritual' authority given by some 'entity' real or imagined be that entity Satan or Set or whatever. Indeed, to so claim such authority via an entity external to oneself exposes the person who so makes the claim as needing this spiritual crutch because they lack real Wisdom -that is, they rely on sa.ething external to themselves, something external to their own achievements. Such an individual has to rely on something external because what really matters is missing - what is missing]\t is that which is created by the following of the Black Arts to the ultimate ending. That is, direct practical experience and the mastery and wisdom which are thereby won.] A genuine Satanic Master (or Mistress) does not need to pose -they do not need to claim they have a mandate. The authority of a real Master or Mistress arises from their experience -it is rooted in them by virtue of their character and is eVident in their eyes, their attitude and their knowledge. They have a1\t unique, individual character -they do not playa 'role' or claim to be in touch or have been in touch with some supra-personal entity. What they say and teach is based on their own experiences, on their own learning -they have struggled l l along the Path for many years, and learnt the hard way, via direct experience. They know because they have done. Accordingly, anyone who claims and need to rely on a mandate given to them -eithe~ by some entity or someone who instructed them -reveals themselves to be a charlatan. To make this even clearer, I shall be personal for a few sentances. I represent a certain Satanic Order -and in a sense I therfore have some 'authority'. But1 I have this authority because, in this Order, I have gone further than anyone ­I have experienced more, and so learned some things. Perhaps I have gained some Wisdom - I certainly have esoteric knowledge and skills beyond that of most others.1 What I say and do arises from my experience -it results from years of effort along the Left Hand Path. My authority is because of my character - a character forged via experience. Ev~n though I had been Initiated by a Satanic Mistress who instructed me for a while, my authority does not derive from her -or from1\t Satan. It derives from my own character. Others can learn from me if they wish ­they are free to judge what I sayar write or create, and learn from it and use it I"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"-J; =J should they wish. They must assess its worth for themselves. I do not make out what I say or write or do to be anything other than mine -except where it concerns some traditions: learned from my Mistress. But even these are to be ~ ] judged on their own merits -there is nothing special about them, nothing 'Infernal' in the sense of a mandate attached to them. They have not been 'sanctified' by the Prince of Darkness Himself -they are not 'sacred' truths. In brief, there is nothing of a religious nature attached to me, the authority I have or those teachings I have inherited and substantially added to. I stand on my own merits, and my creations likewise. The same is true for any genuine Satanist. Why? Because it is in the nature of Satanism. This leads us to the second question: Satanism as a religion. The whole of Satanism is a defiance against the religious attitude. Satanism]\t is a rebellion against all those forms which hold or try to hold our eXistence, our being, in thrall -and the most potent form of thralldom has been and still is, religion. Religion emasculates us -whether it be overtly, via a religion, or] covertly by a religious attitude such as is evident in political or social zealousness, in conformity to a dogma and an authority. Satanism, in essence, is an individual defiance -an individual pride, an individual striving, an individual quest for excellence. It is about fulfilling] the potential inherent in our eXistence -and this means finding and fulfilling our unique Destinies. Satanism means self-effort, self-learning, self-experience: it means each individual striving to become like a god; striving to be like]\t the Prince of Darkness Himself. The Prince of Darkness does not seek weak, docile followers: He desires Comrades, individuals of strength, of Character, full of pride and defiance, overflowing With eXistence itself (which is expressed in deeds, in creation, in changing, in altering evolution). Of course, He (and all genuineJ\t Satanists) use others for Satanic ends -they manipulate. He, as Satanists of character do, has followers -have those who obey. But these are not Satanists ­they are tools, used to achieve something, perhaps broken, but mostly discarded] when what they have been used for has been achieved. They are the dominated, the slave-majority, While the Satanists are the elite, the masters. Satanists are never constrained -they learn for themselves, via experience,J and so progress toward greater understanding, toward a new eXistence. It is the aim of Satanism to produce unique indiViduals possessed of character. Accordingly, a genuine Satanic Master or Mistress or group merely guides others ­merely offers adVice, based on experience. There are no restrictions, no religiousJ\t zeal. There is not and cannot be any dogma -any authority which the indiVidual must be sUbserviant to. There cannot be any form of conformity. If there is ­it is not Satanic.j The Temple of Set constrains its members by dogma, by ethiCS, by making them subserviant to the authority of the priesthood, and to the High Priest himself. It fosters a religious attitude -'believe! because I/we are empowered by Setl1 the Prince of Darkness and so possess his authority'. It restrains -'do not associate With that person/organization,for they are proscribed'. It breeds a sycophancy, stifling genuine experience and creatiVity. Naturally, there any many fine-sounding words and phrases, a great deal ofj intellectualism, which obscures these brutal truths. The Temple of Set . encourages verbiage at the expense of real, dark, sinister experiences. Its members wallow in the illusory world created by words and ideas when they should be alone undergoing formative ordeals. They play at magic(k) and enjoy the glamour of pretending to be 'Satanists' -but they do not go to and beyond the limits of their lives, they do not live life as a succession of ecstasies, they do not go to 'the edge' again and again. Instead, they correspond With one another, meet and talk, meet and talk, do little rituals together or alone, read, and talk and read and write '\" And they know they are safe -the Prince of Darkness has been tamed: he is not really 'evil' (as we are ~ot, they say to themselves and mean it). Ar.d"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"• • • •\t they have their 'progress' mapped out for them -awarded to them by the Priesthood in whom they trust and by Aquino, their High Priest. If they please this priesthood, and Aquino, they are rewarded -exalted to the higher grade and can give themselves and call themselves an exalted name: priest, perhaps, or Aaept, or maybe even Magister Templi if they have truely been sycophantic enough for long enough.•. Meanwhile, the few genuine Satanists get on with their hard tasks - With• following the path of Black Magick by their own efforts, by learning for themselves the hard way. The~work to achieve a real mastery, of themselves, of magick ­making errors, perhaps, but learning, and so growing, so changing and so •1 becoming a changer of evolution itself. For them, there are no restraints, no dogma, no authority. There is only success -or failure. They achieve their own Grades, 1n their own time, and have the self-honesty and the insight to know] if they have really achieved. One illustration to end With. Consider the path of Satanism as a marathon race. There is a start, and a finish, which we will consider to be Adeptship in this]\t instance. Satanists and would-be Satanists line up at the start. The race begins. The Satanist runs the race, and finishes, by his or her own effort -there is no help, only the will to finish, the hardship of the race itself. It is an individual achievement. But the Temple of Set members are those who run some] of the distance, and then find someone running alonside (or perhaps driving along would be more apt) saying \"The rules have been changed! By a decree [read by an 'Infernal Mandate'].The marathon is now only 10 miles -so stop and I ] will award you your certificates [read 'confer Grades'].\" TheTemple of Set members of course believe this person, they do not doubt the Decree -or if they do, they accept it. They stop, and receive their 'rewards' -and believe they] have succeeded: they have run a marathon. But in r~ality, they have deluded only themselves. ] To conclude: The Temple of Set is the epitome of what Satanism is not. ] ]\t 000 ]\t Anton Long ONA ] ] ] ] ] • I"}]
