[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Sinister Dialectic and Diabolical Aims of The Order of Nine AnglesI have heard that some people say that a genuine Left Hand Path organization is a contradiction,since they claim the LHP is essentially anarchic and individual. Do you consider this to be correct,and is the Order of Nine Angles a LHP organization, or even an organization?In respect of the LHP - or perhaps more correct, esoterically, the Sinister Path or Sinister Way - itdepends of course on how one defines this. We have our own definition, and usage, and consider thedefinition and usage of and by others to be irrelevant.For us, and as explained in several ONA MSS over the past three decades, the LHP - the true SinisterWay - is the Way of practical experience, of self-reliance, and of amorality, that is without, or beyond,morality. Thus:(a) the individual learns from direct practical experience, which is both esoteric, magickal, in nature,and also, and vitally, of real-life involving such things as Insight Rôles, overcoming tough physicalchallenges, being heretical, being a-moral, taking risks and courting real personal danger;(b) the individual rejects all dogma, the “religious attitude” and all subservience, and seeks to findanswers for themselves and work things out for themselves, although they may at times accept acertain guidance, and some advice, from someone who has themselves followed the Sinister Way andwho thus can talk and write from personal practical experience; but the individual is free to accept orreject such offered guidance and such advice, with such guidance and such advice being given onlywhen the individual personally seeks it;(c) the individual accepts that they and they alone are responsible for themselves, and that genuineesoteric advancement requires great personal effort over a period of decades;(d) the individual understands that the LHP - the genuine Sinister Way - is a-moral; that is, free fromall moral restrictions, and that each and every follower of the Sinister Way is not bound by the “laws”of any society but instead consider such “laws” as artificial constructs designed to keep individuals inthrall to some supra-personal “authority”; as such, these “laws” and conventional morality itself aredetrimental to the achievement of esoteric Adeptship and esoteric Mastery.In respect of the ONA itself, we are a living nexion - a causal presencing of the Sinister, of certainacausal energies - and as such we both are, and are-not, an organization and an Order. We are so,because we have a Way, a mythos, a system of guidance, a method, which works, is efficacious, andwhich when correctly followed, can produce and has produced Sinister Adepts and SinisterMasters/Lady-Masters. We are so, because, by causally-being, we have produced and do produce andwill produce certain causal changes and effects. We are-not so, because our essence is beyond allthose temporal, causal, forms which makes the living-nexion we are presence itself in manifold waysover a multitude of centuries, some of which forms are “hidden” or unknown to non-Initiates, and evento many Adepts. We are-not so, because the living-nexion which we are and will be is itself limited in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"its causal-living: to perhaps a thousand years; at most, to one and half thousand to two thousand years,after which there will be - there should be - no need for such a temporal presencing, and - if there isthen such a need - another living-nexion will be born, or be manufactured.Thus, as a living Order we offer a certain guidance, and a system of training, for those who might beinterested, just as our Way, our Mythos, can be used freely by others, in whatever way and forwhatever purpose, they choose, which is one reason we reject the restriction, the morality, of “copyright”.You mentioned that the ONA is akin to a living-nexion with a certain causal life-span, of a thousandyears or more. How is this related to the esoteric and practical aims of the ONA?Our aims are of centuries, and more. One of the fundamental aims is to produce more and moregenuine Adepts; another is to change a significant number of people by using, by manufacturing,various causal forms and various “archetypes” - by presencing the Sinister in certain causal ways andthrough certain nexions. Another is to fundamentally alter “society” and produce a new elite, a highertype of human being, and, with and through these individuals, manufacture an entirely new way ofliving, new societies. All these things will take a certain amount of causal time.We have already spent three decades in building the foundations for such changes; in establishing anew dark mythos; in manufacturing certain forms; in using certain already existing causal forms; inPresencing The Dark in certain ways. In guiding many individuals to a certain esoteric achievement.There are other such things, already done, most of which are still esoteric, still hidden even to those,outside of our tradition, who consider themselves Adepts.There are many more things to do, and it is irrelevant to us if people, esoteric-minded or otherwise,understand what we are doing, and why. Their opinion and judgement of us - often erroneously basedon some causal form we or some of our Adepts may use or some rôle an Adept or Master mightassume - is irrelevant.Which is why, I imagine, you personally have never bothered with responding, on the Internet orotherwise, to criticism of the ONA?Correct. Most of the chatter on the Internet is worthless, ephemeral, the product of people with littleesoteric knowledge and even less genuine practical esoteric and personal experience, with such peoplebeing led or controlled either by their own desires or by some unconscious impulse or by some causalabstract form or dogma they do not rationally comprehend, or by all of these things. Such chatter isalmost always immediately reactive, never the product of a reflexion based on experience, and - whenit is not simply inane - it is esoterically and/or intellectually shallow; worthless; pretentious.Genuine esoteric wisdom arises from a reflexion born from personal, direct, practical experience: froman alchemical symbiosis; from that acausal growth that arises slowly over causal time. And it cannot,should not, be expressed in hasty words of the reactive, immediate, emotive kind based upon,dependant upon, some causal abstraction, some dogma, some causal form. Such wisdom is to besavoured; communicated, at best, on a personal basis, and otherwise in some form which enablesothers to reflect upon it, or judge it, over a period of causal time.The only value, esoterically, of this Internet thing is that it allows - for the moment at least - the freedissemination of mythos, of causal forms, of various esoteric Ways, enabling people to access suchthings, and consider them and if necessary act upon or be inspired by them in their own way in theirown causal time. Such action and such inspiration, to be esoterically valid, must of course take acertain amount of causal time: months, most usually years. Thus, the immediacy of chattering Internet"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"forums, and the like, is esoterically irrelevant to us.But haven’t some of your members responded to criticism?No. Some of our associates may have - and I use the word associates advisedly - occasionally donesuch things, most usually as learning experiences for themselves. But no one is authorized to speak byor on behalf of the ONA...Except you - [Anton Long smiles] Except me, naturally.Thus, those individuals, those associates, present only their own views, their own perspective, theirown opinions, deriving as such things do from that incomplete and sometimes erroneousunderstanding which abounds among those who are not Masters/Lady-Masters. I have never botheredto correct such errors and such mistakes as have - very occasionally - occurred when such individuals,associated with us over the past decade, have, via this Internet medium, ventured forth an opinion orview of their own. It is for those individuals to learn, and so correct themselves, and for others to havethe magickal empathy, the esoteric understanding, to perceive such errors and mistakes for the errorsand mistakes they are.Some associates - and the occasional member - have even occasionally produced and published tractsin an attempt to correct some mis-understandings which may have arisen in respect of our Way. Again,I have never bothered to correct such mistakes as may be found in such tracts or answers. But, as wemove now into the third phase of our long term sinister strategy, even such ephemeral, very unofficial,things will cease, since the vast majority of what needed to be published, and said and written, hasbeen, and our living nexion is now so well-established that it does not need such things, and never, intruth, has ever needed them, which is again why I - and those few among us who are Masters or LadyMasters - have never ventured forth any opinion by such means and never bothered with such Internet ephemera.Can you then explain what an associate of the ONA is?Technically, there are ONA members, and ONA associates. A member formally means someone indirect personal face-to-face contact with an Adept or Master/Mistress of the ONA; someone who isbeing guided and thus following our Sinister Way according to tradition, and thus who is part of analready physical ONA nexion, which physical nexion - in Old Aeon speak - is a Sinister “Temple”.There are also “unaffiliated” members who are working alone, who follow our Way, and who are alsobeing guided by an Adept or Master/Mistress of the ONA.Each member - when they attain Internal Adept - is free to guide others, and to establish their own“official” ONA nexion, but they still require some guidance to advance further, toward and into TheAbyss, from whence they may emerge as newly fledged Masters or Lady Masters, who usually do notrequire further guidance.An “official” ONA nexion should not be confused with the Temple - the simple causal construct - thatan aspirant Internal Adept constructs as one of the learning tasks of the Seven Fold Sinister Way,which task is associated with External Adept."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"An associate of the ONA is someone who is doing sinister work on behalf of the ONA and who is incontact (sometimes not on a face-to-face basis) with an ONA member, but who does and who is free todo their own work, and who usually follows or (more usually) developes their own esoteric way andmethods, but who also may propagate the ONA mythos. Such an associate often constructs a new,non-ONA, independent group or organization, which may or may not be imbued with the sinisterenergies which the ONA itself is using, and which may or which may not acknowledge the influenceof the ONA.Of course, many others are influenced by the ONA in a variety of ways, and may or may not use,directly or indirectly, some aspects of our Sinister Way, our Dark Tradition, in whatever way and forwhatever purpose they want, which they can freely do, even if they do not acknowledge the source, theinfluence. Such influence, and such use - and such a hiding of the source of their inspiration - isnatural, and a necessary part of, a necessary extension of, that living sinister presencing which is theONA and which is the ONA mythos, as, of course, the work of our associates is a natural, and anecessary part of, a necessary extension of, our living sinister presencing.You - and others among our kindred sinister-folk - will be aware, for instance, of several esotericgroups which have arisen in the last two decades, wholly or partly inspired by the ONA and ourmythos. Often, such groups last but a few years, and then decay away, as the interest and enthusiasmof the individual or individuals founding them wanes and dies and they themselves fall back into themundane world of non-esoteric folk, or even renounce their sinister quest. Sometimes, such groupsschism, and new ones are formed, and these may last a few more years. But the ONA endures andgrows, slowly, in an alchemical, living way, as is necessary and as befits such a causal presencing ofthe acausal, as befits such a living-being, imbued with acausal energies. Such is the sinister dialectic atwork, and sinister Adepts - and Masters/Lady-Masters - at work, and at play.I have heard it said that some of the tasks of the Seven Fold Way are not necessary, and should only betaken as a rough guide. I’m referring here to such matters as the physical tasks of an External Adept,such as a man walking thirty-two miles, in hilly terrain, in under seven hours while carrying a packweighing at least thirty pounds in weight.Such tasks and tests were designed to physically take the individual to, and beyond, their limits. Todevelope in them a certain personal character. As such, these physical tasks are - for most modernindividuals in the West - hard, and challenging, and require many months of physical training beforethey can be successfully attempted. They are not meant to be easy, and those who say such things asyou mention usually are just too soft, too weak - emotionally, physically, in terms of character - toattempt them, and so make excuses for their failure. We do not care, for thus have they failed thisparticular selection process of ours.As I mentioned - and as by now should be somewhat well-known among sinister esoteric-folk - one ofour aims is to breed, to seed, a new elite, the prelude for a new human species which has beenvariously named as Homo Galactica and Homo Galacticus. If some individuals do not wish to join usin this quest, fine; if they do not desire to undertake the selection process, fine; if they have no dreamof evolving beyond what they are and of thus becoming the foundation for this new elite, this newspecies, fine. The choice is theirs. We simply do not care about them, or about their opinions, or abouttheir excuses, or about their judgement of us.Our tests, our tasks, our Way, is a selection process. Many begin; few succeed. Over the past threedecades, some have succeeded, and this number will increase, slowly, and has increased, slowly. Thereis no easy way to achieve genuine Adeptship; there is no easy way to change yourself - alchemically,esoterically - and so become a part of this new elite."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Our tasks, our tests, our Way, work; the ONA produces sinister Adepts, sinister Master andLady-Masters. But this is a slow process, which is why we have a selection process, why we are, as apractical-form, reclusive; why we do not “recruit”, and why sheer numbers of members do not, neverhave and never will, concern us.The published physical tasks - of, for example, External Adept - are suited to humans who exist, now,in the lands of the West. Suited to those we desire to select, and are certainly achievable by those whomay desire to be of-us, as members, as associates, or as individuals inspired by us. Of course, there aresome individuals who - being supremely physically fit - will find such tasks too easy, and for them, asour MSS mention, there will be higher goals set. But what we will not do is lower these alreadyachievable, if high, standards.Yet there may well arise a time in the nearish future when these high goals will have to made higher(not lower, note) if prevailing conditions, in terms of physical health, nutrition, leisure-time, and so on,continue to improve. In the same manner, it may be necessary, sometime in the near future, for theGrand Master (or Grand Mistress) after me to revise some of the details of the Grade Ritual of InternalAdept, just as I myself revised the details I had inherited, to make the task of living alone, bereft ofmodern comforts, for three months practically feasible in a rather industrialized Britain, allowing thusa tent, and some pre-purchased food, where the original conditions specified building one’s ownshelter and obtaining all food by hunting and gathering. But the essential alchemical, esoteric,elements - and hardship and difficulty - always remain, and, noticeably, such hardship and difficultyalways incrementally increase, in line with our changing slowly evolving civilization.Our tests, our tasks, our Way are ours. They achieve and can achieve what we desire to achieve. Thereare other Ways, other tests, other tasks - but, obviously, they are not ours, not of our Sinister Path, andwhat such others things may (or may not) produce, or whom they may or may not select, are of noconcern to us.We are not now, and will not be, and do not wish to be,”popular”, nor “accepted”; and this will onlyslowly, very slowly, change - if, that is, our diabolical plans succeed, our sinister magick works as itshould, in accord with the sinister dialectic. But even then, it will be at least another hundred years -and probably somewhat longer - before we are understood, appreciated, by a minority, never mind bythe “majority”, and when this minority understanding does occur we will have, exoterically,metamorphozed, in a sinister way, into many other causal forms, while our real essence remains - as itshould - esoteric, hidden, heretical, and with we ourselves thus enabled to continue our diabolic work,in secret.Anton LongOrder of Nine Angles119 Year of Fayen"}]
