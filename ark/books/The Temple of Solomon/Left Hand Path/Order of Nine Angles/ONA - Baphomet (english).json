[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Baphomet & OpferFrom Opfer, Fenrir Vol. II, no 2 The word 'opfer' generally refers to the sacrifice that occurs - symbolic or otherwise - duringcertain rituals. There are, generally, two types of opfer: (1) associated with rites to open a nexion(or 'Star Gate'), between Aeons - when such an opfer(s) is considered necessary in terms of the'energy' required;(2) those associated with traditional beliefs regarding the 'working of thecosmos'. ('Opfers' associated with death rituals form a third type.)The second type, according to tradition, was chosen once every 17 years and this sacrifice wasregarded as necessary to retain 'the cosmic balance' - in modern terms, keep a nexion open (andthus preserve the associated higher civilization etc). The chosen one was made an honouraryPriest (this type of opfer was always male) and there was a joining between him and one or morewomen, as Priestesses. This joining was a simple type of 'hierosgamos', and the offspring of theunion(s) were given great honour. At the ceremony itself, the head of the opfer was severed anddisplayed - usually for a night and a day (although this period may have been longer in the verydistant past). The Rite was conducted outdoors in a 'sacred' place - often a circle of stones or hilltop.The chosen one was able, because of the sacrifice, to partake of an acausal existence - becomingthus an Immortal. Thus 'willing sacrifice' was possible, although it is easy to imagine that in latertimes, the opfer was not so willing.Traditionally, this type goes back to Albion, and while originally the ritual was probably acommunity affair, it became more secretive. What survives to the present day (The Ceremony ofRecalling with 'opfer' ending) probably reflects the essence of this earlier tradition rather than thedetail (the words, chants etc). This essence may be apprehended in the role of the Mistress ofEarth - representative of Baphomet, the Dark Goddess. It was to Baphomet that the sacrifice wasmade - hence a male opfer. Indeed, the whole ceremony (of Recalling) can be seen as acelebration of the dark goddess - the Earth Mistress/goddess in her darker/violent/sinister aspect.The severed head was associated with the worship of Baphoment - the cult deriving from Albion -hence the traditional representation of Baphomet.The identification of Baphomet as the Bride of Lucifer/Satan probably dates from around the 10thor 11th century, as does the use of the name 'Satan'/Satanas as the Earth-bound representative ofthe Dark Gods.It is important to remember that in earlier times (eg. in Albion during the Hyperborean aeon) therewas no clear and/or moral distinction between the 'light' and the 'sinister': the two were seen asdifferent aspects of the same thing. Thus, what we know as the Mistress of Earth (the 'goddess')was both what we now call Baphomet (the dark aspect) and Gaia (the Earth Mother). Likewisewith the male aspect - Satan and Lucifer - or Dionysus/Kabeiroi and Apollo. We now understandall such symbols as unconscious/conscious projections onto 'reality' (where 'reality' = the region ofcausal/acausal mergence) - as 'gates'/nexions to the acausal itself, with the seven spheres of theTree of Wyrd being a 'map' of these gates understandable by 'non-Adept' consciousness. Thus, the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sphere of Mercury re-presents Lucifer/Satan - Mercury, Mars and Sun being \"male\" spheres, andmoon, Venus, Jupiter the \"female\" ones (Saturn beyond such opposites - Chaos itself).The cult of Baphomet was the worship of the dark aspect of the \"female\" energies - where in thiscontext, worship means a striving toward understanding/conscious integration. Traces of theworship of the 'light' aspect survive in the Septenary tradition in the name \"Aktlal Maka\" and thenatural form of the Nine Angles rite. The darker aspect survives, in essence, in the Ceremony ofRecalling and the traditions associated with the Mistress of Earth and Baphomet. As to theoriginal name of the goddess in both her aspects, there is a tradition which gives 'Darkat' (earlyform of Lilith) as the name used before Baphomet became the common usage. However,'Azanigin' has also been suggested - as has 'Aktlal Maka' for the 'light'/Gaia aspect, although boththese are merely 20th century suggestions, not based on any oral tradition. Some aspects of thecult of the (dark) goddess are said to have survived into Greek times in the form of the 'mysterycults' (qv Kabeiroi - and also Eleusis for the 'light' aspect), this being an 'indirect survival', the'modern' Septenary tradition being a direct one, from Albion.The use of the name 'Baphomet' probably derives from the 10th or 11th century although thetraditional pictorial representation of Baphomet is undoubtedly much older. If there was an oraltradition connected with the origin of the name Baphomet, it has been lost.Thus, there are no indications as to the 'original' names of the 'light' and 'sinister' elements on the'male' side - known to us as 'Lucifer' and 'Satan'. These latter names probably also derive fromaround the 10th or 11th century - although 'Karu Samsu' (or something very similar) has beensuggested for the 'Lucifer' aspect and 'Sapanur' as the 'sinister' aspect.The rites associated with the first type of opfer - such as 'The Sinister Calling' - cannot be eitherdated with certainty or seen to be derived from an earlier tradition. In all probability, they derivefrom the 12th or 13th century, although it is quite possible that earlier versions/forms existed.Somehave even considered The Sinister Calling as a later version of the Ceremony of Recalling. Again,if there was an oral tradition, it has been lost - all that remains are the rituals themselves.The 'Black Mass' itself (and indeed most of the ceremonial rituals in The Black Book of Satan)probably originated around the same time as the Sinister Calling. The original Mass was said inLatin, although by the middle of the 20th century a translated version had found its way into theBlack Book - of necessity, although some Latin chants remained.NOTES: The significance of the 17 year cycle is unclear. In the past few decades, some theorieshave been advanced, but they are unconvincing.Aktlal Maka is a chant sometimes used in the natural Nine Angles Rite by the Priestess if theglade has a spring of water. It means 'the flowing waters of Earth' and is chanted in homage toGaia since natural springs are regarded as her children.The 'mysteries of the Kabeiroi' (sometimes spelt Cabiri) is one of the esoteric traditions associatedwith the Hellenic Aeon. In its original form, 'the mysteries' concerned certain deities oftenrepresented in the form of griffins and connected with the sea as well as Demeter - the 'motherEarth' or Gaia.

[See ‘The Ceremony of Recalling’.] The supposed derivation is from the Greek and not, as is sometimes said, from (the Attic form for 'wise'). Such a use of the term 'Mother'/Mistress was quite common in later Greek alchemical writings – for example Iamblichus in \"De Mysteriis\" used to signify possessed by the mother of the gods. Later alchemical writings tended to use the prefix to signify a specific type of 'amalgam' (and some take this to be a metaphor for the amalgam of Sol with Luna, in the sexual sense). In the Septenary System, Baphomet, as Mistress of Earth, is linked to the sixth sphere (Jupiter) and the star Deneb. She is thus in one sense a magickal \"Earth Gate\" (qv. the Nine Angles), and Her reflexion (or 'causal' nature - as against Her acausal or Sinister nature) is the third sphere (Venus) related to the star Antares. According to esoteric Tradition, the Antares aspect was celebrated by rites in Albion c.3,000 BP – in the middle and toward the end the month of May and some stone circles/sacred sites were said to be aligned for Antares. In contrast, the Sinister aspect of the Mistress (i.e. Baphomet) was celebrated in the Autumn and was linked to the rising of Arcturus, Arcturus itself being related to the Sinister male aspect (Mercury - second sphere), later identified with Lucifer/ Satan. Thus, the August celebration was a Sinister hierosgamos - the union of Baphomet with Her spouse (or 'Priest' who took on the role of the Sinister male aspect). According to Tradition, the Priest was sacrificed after the sexual union, where the role of Baphomet was assumed by the Priestess/Mistress of the cult. Thus, the May celebration was the (re-)birth of new energies (and the child of the Union). Tradition relates this Sinister, sacred Arcturian rite as taking place once every seventeen years. Once again, some sacred sites in Albion are said to be aligned to the rising of Arcturus, over three thousand years ago. In the middle ages, Baphomet came to be regarded as the Bride of Satan – and it is from this time that both ‘Baphomet’ and ‘Satan’, as names for the female and male aspect of the dark side came into use (at least in the secret sinister tradition). Hence the Traditional depiction of Baphomet - a beautiful mature woman (often shown naked) holding up the severed head of the sacrificed priest (usually shown bearded). To some extent the Templars revived part of this cult, but without any real esoteric understanding and for their own purposes. They adopted Baphomet as a type of female Yeshua, but with some bloody/ sinister aspects - and contrary to most accepted ideas, they were not especially 'Satanic'. Rather, they saw themselves as holy warriors, and became a military cult with bonds of honour, although their concept of \"holy\" differed somewhat from that of the church of the time, including as it did dark/Gnostic aspects. Their sacrifices were in battle and not part of a specific rite. The image of Baphomet (e.g. by Levi) as a hermaphrodite figure are romantic confusions and/or distortions: essentially of the symbolic/real union of mistress and priest and his later sacrifice. The same applies to the derivation of the suffix of her name with ‘wisdom’ (and a male image at that!) - even the confused Gnostics understood ‘wisdom’ as female. - Order of Nine Angles -"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Baphomet - A Note on the Name II There is a tradition regarding the origin of the name Baphomet which deserves recording, even though it is not regarded as authentic, having no present-day proponents. This tradition regards the name as deriving from - the Greek name for the Egyptian goddess Bastet, recorded by Herodotus (2.137 ff). It is interesting that Herodotus identifies the goddess with Artemis, the goddess of the moon. Bubastis was regarded as the daughter of Osiris and Isis and often represented as a female with the head of a cat - cats were regarded as sacred to her. Artemis was a goddess unmoved by love and she was regarded as Apollo's twin sister (the identification of her as a ‘moon goddess’ followed naturally from this since Apollo was linked with the sun). Like Apollo, she often sent death and plagues, and was propitiated sometimes with sacrifices. It is interesting that (a) is the Pythagorean name for ‘five’ [qv. Iamblicus: Theologumena Arithmeticae, 31] - perhaps a link with the ‘pentagram’?; (b) the Templars, with whom the name Baphomet is associated, were said to have worshipped their deity in the form of a cat. *** The tradition recorded above, and the one described in part I, both regard Baphomet as a female divinity - and both are esoteric traditions, hitherto unrecorded. It is possible that both are correct that is, that the actual name Baphomet derives (as mentioned in part I) from the Greek : the prefix referring to being ‘dyed/stained’ or ‘dipped’ in blood. The suffix derives from ‘mother’ or ‘mistress’ used in a religious sense (qv. Iamblicus ‘De Mysteriis’). This name - Baphomet - is thus a descriptive one for the \"dark\" (i.e lunar) goddess, to whom sacrifices were made, and which was actually known in former times as ‘Bubastis’ - that is, Bastet, to whom cats were sacred. Thus, Baphomet could be regarded as a form of Artemis/Bastet - a female divinity with a ‘dark’ side or nature (when viewed via conventional morality) to whom sacrifices have been, and continue to be, made. Sinister tradition regards Baphomet as the Bride of Satan/Lucifer - this would fit well since Lucifer is often regarded as a form of Apollo: Artemis is the female form ('sister')of Apollo. Here, it must be remembered that both Apollo and Artemis were not aetherial, moral and lofty divinities (the classical gods have been romantically misinterpreted) - they could be, and often were, deadly and dark: both ‘sinister’ and ‘light’. - Order of Nine Angles -"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Baphomet - A Note on the Name III Tradition tells of a community who venerated the goddess in an area of what is now North Scotland. this community is believed to have comprised of the ancestors of 'The Picts', and they were based around the River Oykel. The Latinized form of their name, given by Ptolemy, was Smertae, which means 'stained' or 'smeared folk'. The name by which this community knew the goddess is not recorded, but in Gaulish inscriptions there is reference to a war goddess named Rosmerta. Her name translates as 'the greatly smeared goddess' - that is, smeared with blood. It is quite possible that the Smertae were connected with her worship, and they were said to smear themselves with the blood of their enemies, in her honour. Interestingly, another community which lived near the region of the Smertae during the same era, was known by a name which translates as the 'cat people' (see Note on the Name II). - Order of Nine Angles -"}]
