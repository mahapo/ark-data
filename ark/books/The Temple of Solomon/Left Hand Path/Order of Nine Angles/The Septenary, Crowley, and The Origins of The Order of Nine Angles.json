[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Septenary, Crowley, and The Origins of The Order of Nine AnglesCrowley and The Sinister WayAleister Crowley is regarded, by the ONA, as a rather conventional, if somewhat eccentric, example ofwhat it has been convenient to call The Right Hand Path; that is, the ONA regards him as unconnectedwith any genuine Left Hand Path or any genuine Sinister Way. This is evident in many things,including (1) his reliance upon Old Aeon “Orders” and organizations, with their grand titles, theirsycophancy, their “secret teachings revealed only to qualified initiates”, and especially theirpresumption of awarding titles and magickal grades to others; (2) that he never did any dark andsinister deeds - works of genuine evil - and neither did he and does he inspire any such works anddeeds, or even the presencing of Chaos or genuine heresy; and (3) the pseudo-mystical ramblings ofhis (and his followers) which pass for “esoteric teachings”.Crowley has been criticized by the ONA for several reasons. For instance:1) First, because a study of both his life and his writings make it clear that he never progressed beyondthe stage of Adeptship, if indeed he ever achieved Adeptship itself, which is unlikely. To state whatone ONA person wrote: “What did Crowley actually do, apart from pose and indulge himself?” Hislife reveals only such posing, and a personal Initiate-type indulgence as well as a basic low-levelsinister manipulation of people, appropriate to and often associated with the early stages of a genuineseeker of Occult knowledge with such posing, such Initiate-like indulgence, and such basicmanipulation evident in his Abbey of Thelema.Where, for instance, is the understanding of a genuine Adept: that of manufacturing, and using, newarchetypes and archetypal forms (See Footnote 1 below); where that understanding of Aeonic Magickand indeed of Aeons? All Crowley did - in line with the majority of Occultists of his time, and evidentin his Liber AL vel Legis - is use and propagate the dead archetypal forms of a dead Aeon: that is, andin his case, of those things associated with the former Sumerian Aeon and its associated civilization,the Egyptian.His Liber AL vel Legis - just like Aquino’s Book of Coming Forth By Night - is a good example of atext produced by an Initiate of the Esoteric Arts. That is, it is a work which is quite representative ofsomeone following the early stages of an esoteric Path. To quote an ONA MS, such works are:“In both style and content, reminiscent of a working done by an... Initiate following theseven-fold way - i.e. a working with one of the pathways that link the spheres of the Tree ofWyrd when various ‘entities’ are invoked. [An example of one such working has been published,in 1974 en - The Message of the One of Thoth]. Such workings are generally understood to belearning experiences - when the... novice is exploring, via archetypal symbolism and archetypalforms, their own psyche. Most magickians, of whatever path or tradition, produce such‘communications’ in their learning years. Those who are insightful, learn from these - and then"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the novice moves on: the workings are seen as merely explorations of the unconscious. Thosewho are not insightful, dwell upon such workings - they fail to objectify them, they fail to integratethem via a conscious understanding of what they really are: merely workings with various archetypalsymbols. [A classic case is John Dee.] Those who fail to integrate them, usually see such workings as‘pronouncements’ by some supra-personal being or entity: that is, they are seen as actual andimportant revelations of some ‘deity’. Accordingly, a lot of time is spent ‘understanding’ what theoften cryptic ‘communication(s)’ means, and in writing “commentaries” upon them.”That Crowley spent much of his life writing about and propagating his Liber AL vel Legis - andconsidered it as a work of immense Occult importance - clearly reveals the true level of his ownesoteric understanding.2) Second, because he propagated the corrupt and bastard system of The Golden Dawn, firmly basedas that system was on the qabalah, which qabalah and which corruption of it as used by the GoldenDawn and by Crowley, is the antithesis of the genuine Western tradition, which genuine tradition isseptenary based. Indeed, The Golden Dawn system re-presents and re-infornces, the “Magian”distortion of the Western tradition.This reliance upon the distortion of the genuine Western esoteric tradition is evident, for example, inhis system of “magickal correspondences” deriving from The Golden Dawn, and his use of, andreliance upon, such works as The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage and his writingabout such things as the “conversion of one’s holy guardian angel...”3) Third, because he lacked an Initiated understanding of Aeons, Aeonic Magick and indeed ofMagick itself. His lack of understanding of Aeons is evident in his declaration of a new “equinox ofthe gods” - after writing his Liber AL vel Legis; evident in the mystical and mythical mish-mashcontained in that work, as well as in his many other pseudo-mystical ramblings, where, to give just twoexamples, from many in his verbose book Magick in Theory and Practice, he - the self-proclaimed“magus” - (a) mentions his “word” Thelema as the word of a “new aeon”, and compares it with whathe regards as previous such “magickal” words, such as those of Buddha and Muhammad; and (b)declares, in the Old Aeon speak used by those of the Right Hand Path, that “the essential characteristicof the Grade is that its possessor utters a Creative Magical Word, which transforms the planet onwhich he lives by the installation of new officers to preside over its initiation...” And so on, and so on.[Of course, he could have been \"having a laugh\" here, as elsewhere, but this is - from the evidence ofhis other works and his own life - to be imbuing him with an esoteric understanding he so evidentlydid not possess.]According to the Sinister tradition of the ONA, an Aeon lasts from between one and half thousandyears to sometimes nearly two thousand years, and is:“A particular presencing of certain acausal energies on this planet, Earth, which energies affect amultitude of individuals over a certain period of causal time. One such affect is via the psyche ofindividuals. This particular presencing which is an Aeon is via a particular nexion, which is anAeonic civilization, which Aeonic civilization is brought-into-being in a certain geographical areaand usually associated with a particular mythos.” A Brief Order of Nine Angles Glossary4) Fourth, his much-vaunted but verbose book Magick in Theory and Practice is replete with RightHand Path type pseudo-mystical ramblings, such as “astral planes”, the “body of Light”, magical“circles” and talismans, and with Old Aeon qabalistic notions such as “spirits” and Old Aeonstereotypes such as ceremonial “lodges” and “magickal Orders” working with rules and rigidhierarchies. In that work, all Crowley did was insert his own “law of Thelema” into an already existingpseudo-mystical mish-mash."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Thus, the conclusion is that while Crowley may be of interest to some “Right Hand Path” individualsstill working within the distorted Golden Dawn tradition, he is of no use, and of no interestwhatsoever, to anyone interested in or working within a genuine Left Hand Path and Sinister tradition,and indeed he is of no interest or practical importance to anyone who wants to forge ahead on theirown along the Way of genuine esoteric Arts. Instead, he is a rather good example of the traps, andpitfalls, that await for the unwary, and those who, through lack of direct practical experience(extending to decades) of both the Light and the Dark, prefer pseudo-mystical ramblings and thecomfort of Old Aeon stereotypes to the harsh and dangerous reality of genuine practical Occultism.For at worst he was just an Initiate floundering about, trapped by egotism and delusions of grandeur,while, at best, he was a charlatan who enjoyed, as a good Initiate should, sometimes playing gamesand enjoying japes: someone who never confronted, let alone alchemically synthesized in themselvesor presenced, for others, the Darkness beyond and within, and thus someone who did not (to be kind)progress beyond Adeptship, or (to be realistic) did not progress beyond the stage signified by External Adept.Crowley, The Septenary, and The Origins of the ONAIt has been suggested by several individuals interested in The Order of Nine Angles, and in the life andworks of Anton Long, that Anton Long was “influenced” by both the system of the Golden Dawn andby Crowley, since - as described in Diablerie: Revelations of a Satanist - Anton Long briefly had somecontact with a small ceremonial Golden Dawn based group, in London, when, as a young man, he wasbeginning his study of The Dark Arts. Thus, the assumption is that the ONA itself - and such things asits Seven Fold Way and the Septenary System - are, in part at least, either derived from or influencedby either the work of Crowley or by The Golden Dawn.However, as described in a still esoteric autobiographical MS, written by him and entitled QuodFornicatio sit naturalis hominis, this contact was brief, with him, he admits with the arrogance ofyouth, dismissing both the teachings of the Golden Dawn, and the works of Crowley, as “wishy-washyarty-farty mumbo-jumbo” after a study of, among many other works, Regardie’s The Golden Dawn,Crowley’s Magick in Theory and Practice, his Liber AL vel Legis and other writings, loaned to him bysomeone in that ceremonial group, and after witnessing “several boring, pompous, and veryun-magickal, ceremonial rituals”.The claim that several aspects of the ONA system were derived from or influenced by either the workof Crowley or The Golden Dawn is addressed, by Anton Long, in the still esoteric autobiographicalMS, written by him, dated 118 Year of Fayen, and entitled Emanations of a Mage where he states:“As for the Septenary System itself, this - as I inherited it - was, in essence, an aural tradition,with only a few short handwritten MSS containing some correspondences and giving a briefdescription, and an illustration of, the Tree of Wyrd, and it did not take me long, during my timewith my Lady Master and her daughter, to realize that, if anything, the Golden Dawn system wasa distorted and very corrupt, version of this genuine, and hitherto secret, Western septenarytradition. At that time, following my own Initiation in the Dark Tradition of this, my LadyMaster, the true origins of this system of hebdomadry were not known, although there was anaural tradition mentioning the works of people such as Robert Fludd which were said to containsome allusions to this seven-fold order, and it was only some time later, after I had undertakenmuch research lasting some years, that I considered I had found the original and probablylong-forgotten source."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This source was - and for me, at that time (the early to middle 1970’s e.n.) surprisingly - theworks of various Arabic alchemists and writers, who had not only posited a system of sevenfundamental stages or elements - al-ajsad al-sabaah - but who had also constructed a system of nine emanations of “The One” which included these seven elements plus two others which werequite distinct by virtue of having different aspects, or types of, or sources of, time itself, asdescribed in the alchemical manuscript Al-Kitab al-Aflak.What I found especially interesting - or, to be more accurate, what at that time astonished me -was that here was a system of nine emanations which mirrored, or which seemed to me to mirror, whatI had termed, some years previously, as the Nine Angles, consisting as those Nine Angles did of theseven emanations (or nexions or spheres or Gates) of the Tree of Wyrd plus the twoemanations/nexions which re-present the ToW as itself a nexion (a means to progress toward theacausal), with The Abyss - an actual connexion between the individual and the acausal - being theother one of the those two other emanations/nexions.My actual reason for first using the term Nine Angles, some time before this discovery in Arabictexts, to describe the traditional “order” I had inherited from my Lady Master, was essentially to dowith my other research - since my late teenage years - into tensorial mathematical representations ofSpace-Time, for I had already, due to my own Occult researches, concluded that in order to rationallyunderstand magick, one must posit a bifurcation of Time itself, something I rudimentary described inthe first section of early editions of my Emanations of Urania MS, coining the term Cliology todescribe this rational apprehension. After my initiation - and after about two weeks of learning andstudy with my Lady Master and her daughter - I sensed a similarity between this research of mine, andtheir aural traditions regarding the Septenary System and the Tree of Wyrd (described by a doubletetrahedron), and it seemed to me then that I might be able to find some mathematical connectionbetween the seven plus two emanations of the Septenary (described in one short traditional MS bya double tetrahedron, each of which had nine mathematical angles), and the Tensor which had nine non-zero symmetric components and which formed one part of an equation I had used toconnect normal (causal) Space-Time with that new type of non-causal Space which I then hadtentatively called the acausal.Hence the descriptive name I choose for the tradition I had been Initiated into and whichtraditions I had inherited: the Order of Nine Angles, signifying as that name did not only the basic, andinherited tradition of seven plus two emanations (the Septenary), but also my own theory regardingcausal and acausal Space and Time.”On the question of magickal Grades - as described in works such as Naos - Anton Long, in the sameMS, writes:“The aural traditions I had inherited included several other aspects: first, a basic, and quiterudimentary, system of Grades related to the stages, or the spheres, of the basic Tree of Wyrd;second, a series of tests, or ordeals, for prospective Initiates, and for some of the early Grades;third, some basic and quite rudimentary guidelines for choosing involuntary opfers...It should be understood that these were all aural traditions - nothing was written down. Indeed,beyond the few short handwritten MSS mentioned previously, the only complete manuscriptswere a handwritten early copy of The Black Book of Satan - which in its English version derivedfrom less than fifty years ago - and one other work... Even the traditional esoteric chants were allaural, and had to transcribed, just as the traditional Ceremony of Recording, as practised by thefew secluded rural sinister covens of tradition, was never written down, having been memorizedby the Lady Master whose duty was to conduct the ceremony, along with, of course, varioustraditions regarding Baphomet as the Dark Earth Mother Goddess to whom sacrifices were"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"made...Thus, the traditional task associated with what I came to term the Grade of Internal Adept was forthe person (male or female) to live alone for at least three months in a wilderness type area, duringwhich they had to fend for themselves, building their own shelter and hunting for, and gathering, alltheir own food. As for the Grades themselves, they were traditional, having - in a looser way andaccording to aural tradition - pre-dated the Tree of Wyrd and the Septenary itself, which was regardedas a medieval accretion on something much older, with there originally being no titles, or names (suchas Adept or even Initiate), associated with the various stages of someone progressing along The Path,or Journey, of Wyrd, which stages themselves were never classified numerically (one to seven) butwere rather seen and understood in relation to what later became known as a “knowing of wyrd” andwhich originally was just “wyrd-full”, with this knowing, this progression itself, relating to certainastronomical cycles, such as the seventeen and nineteen years between certain lunar, stellar, and solarevents, connected as those events themselves were with various esoteric traditions and myths,elsewhere described...The Septenary had given some form to such aural and such early traditions, and I myself gave thetradition some more form, thus making many aspects more conscious, and updating such things as theGrade Ritual associated with Internal Adept, since it was no longer really feasible, in a country such asthe British Isles, for individuals to find an isolated area, full of game, where they might live alone byhunting, and gathering, their own food. Furthermore, I desired to make the whole tradition not onlyaccessible - and magick itself more rational and thus easier to understand via notions such a nexion,causal and acausal - but also a means to transform not just a few individuals over several decades, buta much larger number of people, world-wide, thus creating that new elite which might form the basisfor a new type of more evolved human being.”Order of Nine Angles119 Year of FayenFootnotes:(1) An archetype is a particular causal presencing of a certain acausal energy and is thus akin to a typeof acausal living being in the causal (and thus “in the psyche”): it is born (or can be created, bymagickal means), its lives, and then it “dies” (ceases to be present, presenced) in the causal (i.e. itsenergy in the causal ceases)."}]
