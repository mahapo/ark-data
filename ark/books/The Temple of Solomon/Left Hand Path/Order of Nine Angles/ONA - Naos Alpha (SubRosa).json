[{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"An Important Note Concerning Editions of NAOS: There are several versions of NAOS currently in circulation, in both pdf Internet versions, and in printed versions. Most of these versions of NAOS contain errors, deriving as these versions do from a pdf file circulated on the Internet some years ago which pdf version contained several mistakes. A copy of this pdf version with added inserted Comments giving details of the mistakes (and correcting some of them) was issued by RS of the ONA two years ago, and place on the Camlad ONA mirror site. One of these errors is on page 12 of the pdf version, and gives the wrong layout for the Celtic Cross Tarot. Another error is on page 13 which gives an illustration which has no place whatsoever in any ONA document and which forms no part of any ONA tradition. Another error is on page 36 which gives a misleading illustration - refer to page 125 of the pdf file for the correct illustration of the Star Game boards. Another error is on page 80 which gives a misleading impression - the illustration should be 3D, not a two dimensional one. "}]
