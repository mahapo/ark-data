Such magicians are Sinister and ore often than not alone in their journey; separated from the current or tern-oral manifestations occurring in the relative time and space of the Matrix by hich others judge their efforts or compare the validity of their journey •ainst. For example, when it was accepted by Science that atoms were no lOnger the cornerstone of existence, many attempted to place their theories related to existence inside the prevailing trends of quantum physics or theory relativity in order to make their theories more readily accepted and thus credibility be attained, so that the new idea didn't undermine previous. facts stated by highly esteemed colleagues. This may be fine for Theoretical Science - But not for the Occult. The Occult is not, and never will be, an acceptable, provable, fact-based sys-tem of analysis and practice. It is a private madness grounded in the rational, the irrational and the Abyss and is experienced in a unique manner by each magician. No originality ever came from following the expected protocols and trends of the masses or from taking the established 'facts' of science so seri-ously that they were held to be impregnable and remain unchallenged. Science may be a better way of researching the world by breaking it into manageable 7"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HARUSPEX constituent chunks using mathematical/symbolic abstracts than the earlier practice of communing with God through a church to understand the myster-ies-but it is no less immune to corruption, bureaucracy and the painful crawl of time that it takes for an idea to be accepted (usually long after the 'idealer' has been ridiculed, disbarred, humiliated andfor sent to the stake) than the Church was. If I may borrow some classic scientific terminology, the 'fact' is that, owing to the complexity of life, science and religion deal with facets of it in a way no different to that of the isolated sorcerer, i.e. by sorting out for oneself which aspects of life are important, and thus apprehending the world in a specific manner that idolizes some parts of it by building a world-view based upon those shining principles, and shunning or ignoring the rest. What is written by our members illustrates part of a private path and personal breaking through. It is not expected to mean anything to an outsider. Indeed, many out-siders are so entrenched in the Matrix that they are unable to be interesting enough to have their own path. They attach themselves to other's paths as sycophants or vampires to fawn over them, ridicule them, tear them down or to criticize and make foetid pronouncements and denouncements as a vulgar occult parasite or parrot with no understanding of their own and no original-ity: characterized by a lack of magical maturity and the need to destroy. No scientific or religious or psychological edict held to be true is necessarily true to Us. Perhaps in the Matrix it is true and evident but outside of that tem-poral box the only truth is our own sense of validity as magicians moving through the world encountering obstacles, decisions, beliefs, tests, \"truths\" for ourselves; often without recourse to the convenient labels of the Matrix. Al-though sometimes we resort to meeting the Magian halfway by attempting to ride the waves of logic or reason in a manner that suits our critics or speak the language that is expected by our critics, it is only a temporary alight on their own terms. The subsequent mindset we arrive at based on our self-discovery is more highly esteemed as proof/fact for truth than any of the writings, opinions (and even experiences) of others-for the wanderings of a magician cannot help but 'prove' that there is no objectivity, that there are no facts, that the written word differs greatly from esoteric experience, and that while many are 8"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"lNSYNSIAN ified by their own forms, there exists an ever-present quality of chaos that persedes what is known and practiced in magic by those still trapped in the of form, which is generally only the noisy exhalations of the Ego. has been said before that there is communication below the Abyss and .mmunication above the Abyss and never the twain shall meet.

The power of Christianity consisted of a fervent faith in a singular, all-powerful entity: a One. One, meant that there was an unmistakable difference in following the One Way of God and in straying from it. Either did it 100% right or 100% wrong. It was a way that had no loopholes, no deviations from the established route, no alternate route or short-cuts and no thinking for oneself lest one think oneself higher than the Will of the Almighty Creator. Moreover, one began with the disadvantage of Original Sin. In short; the way of God meant humility. Humility before the gold-gilded altars laden with ecclesiastical paraphernalia, heavily encrusted with gems and pre-cious metals, held by priests dressed in the finest silk vestments, housed in mighty ornate edifices of mahogany, teak, marble and stone (incen·sed with the finest imported spices) that modern architecture stands irrevocably in the shadow of. These tremendous idols to the glory of God are a testament to the power of a form that is singular in nature. To strive toward one point, one goal, one God, is to lay all efforts and aspi-rations, all riches bodily and monetary, all prayers, all hopes and fears, all ques-tions and answers, in a perfectly straight road toward one immutable apex. When this apex began to crumble, when science began to erode the perfect word with its heresies and discoveries, God did not die as Nietzsche believed. 9"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"HARUSPEX God and the idea of a single perfect form had been ingrained into a large ma-jority of the world's influential people (and remembering that the global pop-ulation was significantly smaller in ancient times), the fanatical trend of the singular spread far and wide for thousands of years killing and persecuting those who would not accept it. To live, many did. A singular way survived over pantheistic religions because of: a) the bru-tality with which the singular way was promulgated, b) there was less uncer-tainty about things with the Alpha to the Omega covered and a far greater concealment of the haunting memory of the original chaos with everything from life to afterlife taken out of people's hands and conveniently dealt 'with by external authorities. And c) pantheistic religions had no real impetus to at-tempt to annihilate other religions in a holocaust of thought, whilst the drive behind a monotheistic deity was to aggressively pursue all who would not see or hear the singular truth. But I digress; God did not die. He was, and still is, simply transferred. He, God, is nothing more than the recent belief by humanity in one perfect way; and the search, the certainty, the arrogance which encompasses the world-view of each and every individual still unconsciously pining for God in his old form, continues unabated today with the individual projecting the notion of God ontofinto other facets of the Matrix. Individuals put their faith in science, in the wisdom of others, in the idea of 'progress', 'truth', or 'facts', 'democracy', 'peace' or 'the future', and strive to arrange the world just so in a unique and individual schemata that is collectively united by humanities mass desire for a replica of the singular perfection of the God that was. Because of this reasoning that humanity is unconsciously mourning the loss of the reign of God as a totalitarian dictator that told them exactly what to do, when to do it and why, and that it is trying to replace that apex by pro-jecting that same singular will (and it is irrelevant whether the new form is so-called \"adversarial\" or \"rebellious\" against God.

More-er, for me and for many others, particular scientific assertions remain convincing. Science's major downfall, like religion before it, is in its singular-orientated nve to be objective. Philosophy grounds itself in being subjective, but nev-ertheless suffers from the same weakness of being a form: philosophy is mere speculation that is there to be believed or not believed as one sees fit. If we ombine aspects of the two, although it is scientifically true enough that if •ne steps out in front of a fast moving car one will get badly damaged, why, and what are dependent on philosophical suppositions held self -evident. Self-evidence is a great thing, a philosopher's stone; right up until one enters the Abyss. When one cannot even hold one's self evident, then all other sup-positions lose their grounding and begin to float unsecured and disorganized m a chaos that can only be understood if it is organized. But the nature of the chaos before it is organized remains a mystery because so many fear it.A form may be weakened/altered to appease its critics and silence them to entice their support or favour, or the form may be strengthened to discredit or drop out 11"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"HARUSPEX of the argument altogether; but even if some interest is taken in its survival, only a few people realize how incredibly manipulative form can be. For exam-ple; it is important, even when it is 'wrong', that a form be made as solid as possible to elicit a dense and strong reaction to give rise to an equally solid counter-form. But, whatever; we don't expect our methods to be understood. We do expect, over time, that Satanists will come to implement a greater ma-turity in their satanic practice, be at the forefront of a Satanic \"renaissance\" and cease to indulge in the farce the Magian is attempting to pull. Manipulating these greater currents does not happen overnight with the publication of a few manuscripts. Taking into account the length of time for previous attempts by the Sinister Tradition to manipulate esoteric currents and our awareness of the excruciating slowness of the growth of genuine black magical insight -it requires at least thirty years and the prime plateau of many powerful combined wills fulfilling their Wyrd to employ significant changes. Hence there is a division between what is important to our esoteric order and what is important to our exoteric order. Our esoteric order cares nothing for approval of our essays by the majority, and anticipates with good humour the temporary nature of criticism of the contents to issue forth as some individual seizes upon the forms and finds 'fault' with them. We natu-rally expect others to attempt to assert their personal will, their way, their truth, over our exoteric structures. It is not a contest of ego for us; we have no doubt that any quibbles over the locationfdefmition in the Matrix of names, labels and forms singled out by a magician to use as 'separated' examples of 'thing' from the insoluble Black Clay that are laid down in a formulaic hypoth-esis with the tools of the Matrix so a few can approach an understanding (if those forms last the distance), would continue to cause bickering long after each of the founding members of this Temple are dead. What is important is to earth and stay the course to present original ideas. Original ideas come from combining the ideas of others from working knowledge and practice of these ideas; i.e. Synchronicity, the Acausal Voice, Remote Solidarity, the Mind War, our Ritual Magic, etc. Few magical systems can claim to be original with a straight face; even less their followers, and it is vastly harder to build something than it is to tear it down - especially some-12"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"lNSYNSIAN De\\ Anyone can tear something down; after all a form's greatest weak-that it is a form.

Our essays are not the they are 'a' point. They are exoteric scriptures that represent the sum of a magicians understanding in a particular frame of reference at that cu1ar time, no less and no more absurd than the rambling scriptures of other human being. The necessity of humans to bicker and tear each other owes much to the Magian influence and the level of rudimentary teach-.. available to school a person on form and its role in black magic. lhat we see as important is the demonstration of many essays with original making the key notions of Magian magic; i.e. \"form\", apparent and trans-Bent and thus changing the perspective of some by giving an insightful con-to the now long stale {and largely mediocre) art of magic, whilst sharing joke of the egos of its practitioners.

It is from observations of this natural expression, i.e. Na-ture, unsullied by the intrusion of man's 'e', that Nature can divulge the nat-ural pattern of things, i.e. the sacred geometry of the Universe. Even when 'E' has been 'tamed' to suit the 'e' of Man, its retains its essen-tially primal chthonic quality-there must be continued pressure or resistance against the expression of 'E' by man's 'e' to keep it serviceable as such; _i.e. in one mundane example, we mow the lawns and trim the tree branches when they show signs of interfering with power lines on our streets, lest the grass become 'overgrown' or the tree branches 'disruptive' to our Will to power, 'e'. This constant struggle to 'mould the black clay', to mould the primal matter of 'E' and the contents generated by its engine, by the contents of 'e' - is a struggle to maintain a stasis of artificial forms over natural ones. It is a process that can not favour one engine over the other; the E and the e are not divisive when we look at the greater process, but joined in a cyclic dance. However, when the Will of 'e' tries to force 'E' to conform to its Will, there can be dire consequences. Consider the Atomic and Hydrogen bomb. Man's Will to harness the elements of 'E' amplify the opposing Will of 'E' and the detonation that results when that 'Efe' is released is incredible. If we see a road sign as we drive by it-we can, with developed powers of empathy and psychicfoccult skills come to sense the Will that binds that sign to be there. We know a worker probably placed the sign there by order of the Council for which they work. In turn the transport authority issued orders to the Council. Someone in the transport authority decided to Will that sign to be there, whether it was a political decision to placate or bribe voters, or a de-cision based on common-sense to reduce speed-whatever the motive, it is the Will of 'e' that conceived of its implementation. The road sign is thus held there by many combined forces of Will, by the worker who wants to have done a good job by doing what he was asked to do and completing the task of setting up the sign, the Council who have ensured the sign was placed there in order to answer to their responsibilities and obligations as part of a bureau-cratic transport administration, and the individual in the transport authority who decided that it would be a good idea to erect a road sign in the first place 16"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"How WILL SHAPEs REAUTY nng to pressure from other wills or 'e's and external/internal forces. due to these wills, that you are seeing a road sign where it is and why est of the power lines, roads, houses, letter boxes, etc. appear the way they have been placed in such a way, to give rise to your spatial and visual ~tation of the ' black clay' or matter of the 'E' that defines your per-of the clay within a specifically shaped geometry.

This zone is at this time perceived through a third-dimensional prism -but occult faculties or entheogenic drug use can awaken the necessary sight to perceive the zone by other types of prism, or beyond the zone without a prism. But regardless of the shape of the prism - all possible knowledge is limited to and constituted by the singular point of resistance where the two types of content from each engine meet and touch. Everything outside of this contact is unknowable and constitutes the Abyss. When the sign is being placed, the will directed at putting it up can be quite tremendous-with many wills answering to the Will of another, a sort of com-bined effort to will that sign in place is achieved. However, once the sign is placed -the Will of the one who conceived of it has been achieved by resist-ance against the 'E' (i.e. chopping down trees to make roads, making sand into pouring concrete to hold the sign, etc.). In such a case, once the sign is up, the Will of the 'e' that placed it there will no longer be focused upon the act of resisting the particular elements of 'E' in that region specific. The 'e' may even forget all about it and move on to performing some other act of Will. The sign will thus have the power of will withdrawn from it-it will no longer be strongly powered by 'e'-instead it will revert to its original inertness in the service of Man's Will and be left to be claimed by 'E'. Divested of its protec-tion, the sign will easily succumb to the Will of another, whose single will to re-shape the sign's 'E' may prove stronger than the power of the original com-bined wills, now that the power from those combined wills has been with-drawn and the sign, left for 'dead'. The contra can be demonstrated as an active force in Military installations-in which tremendous 'e' Will, and sustained Will at that, keeps the 'E' of these types of installations, firmly in the service of Man's 'e'. That is to say, someone wants the installations there and makes sure they stay there, makes sure they are carefully guarded, secure and private. Unlike the sign, 'e' is not withdrawn from this type of 'E'. If the sign in the first example had guards posted all about it to ensure it stayed upright- a sim-ilar sustained Will would be likely to keep the 'E' of the sign firmly in Man's service.

It is they who carry life, who have life ripped from them, and who secretly, subtly control the move-ments and decisions of their men, whom in isolation, are as soft, insecure and afraid as any of the women they publicly claim to protect (or exploit). Of the creation of life, men penetrate and withdraw-and biologically, can only observe and watch life force. It is not their lot to have wombs or to bear children. I will return to this in future commentaries but it is one of the things that truly divides men and women -to pretend there is no difference is as ig-norantfarrogant to believe we are completely different.

And many go along with this charade thinking and judging the ·~ericans\" as this or that based on such statements, often without the com-mon-sense to question how anyone could know sentiments of that scale of such a diverse and astronomical number of ways in which those brains func-tion. Such a statement is mere \"politics\" or statistics -and is a small example of what constitute to us, the MATRIX, the taking of form and interpretation and hearsay as gospel over what is common-sense, observable, rational, rea-sonable, possible. It is a common sloppy madness that has strongly gripped the world by the long-standing traditional use of abuse of such things as language, logic, form, by a concentrated group of persons who exhibit a similar and ma-terialistic weltanschauung. In my time has the Magian been able to be said to be represented by the apitalist or materialist; before my time, the Magian current was something else, represented by something else. Another example is in referring to the plans or motivations of billions of brains by lumping them all under one umbrella such as 'The Russians', or 'Com-munists' or some other such grouping. The same can be said of the Magian or .Mundanes by the Sinister, or any other \"us\" and \"them\" scenario. While THEM are aware of doing this, i.e. of creating an enemy that is ubiquitous and that are projecting our shadow, our prejudice, our ego; it is necessary to take on guise and take shapes and use generalized terms and reach others on the same level as the Matrix does, therein, others can put up their theories and be-and we will break them down so that they can be free. It seems people can understand when this language form is employed - despite the heavy toll e translational process from esoteric truth, thought or insight takes as it is .lllried through the messenger of the written or spoken word. Our own writings are theory, they work for us and we ascribe a weltan-:luuung of our own around our work, around ourselves; they are driven by convictions made possible by our ego, by our sense of relatedness; however theories sound in words to others, it is not going to affect how these prin--affect our ability to believe in and practice magic based on these princi-that we experience as working sorcery. Some of that sorcery that is taught er our banner of CHANGE may be understood by the astute or wise, but 43"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"HARUSPEX I doubt very much of it is; most people fix their gaze upon the appearance of things, upon the nuts and bolts, the terms and the words, the idea that someone is trying to state something unchangeable, or directly contradict their own view which is taken as a challenge ... The fact is, we teach change. Much of what you say about what you under-stand requires no comment from me or anyone else, you will figure out what you figure out in your own time and in your own way. Our methods are not about controlling others or obscuring magic or pretending we are invincible or infallible (much as our external authoritarian writings may convince some that we are saying just that); they are there for a purpose, written like that for a purpose, a purpose driven by the ego -only when that first purpose has been achieved, when there is a FORM created for the purpose of communi-cating something very particular to a reader, and that connexion is made by the reader, can the next stage of the process begin ... but the processes too are not in the end, important-what is important is the overall work of changing, of confronting the status quo (particularly in thought), of thinking things through, and eventually, with any luck, of seeing one's own power. I continue to learn every day in some way or another. While I may say more than others on a subject, I know better than to believe 'myself' knowing just how deceitful and deceptive are those blinding moments when we feel we've it all figured out. And I know far better than to stop questioning myself or to cease keeping a suspicious eye on my own assertions. I only realise how much I do knowfdon't know when I am asked a question-up until that point, know-ing as much as I do is almost useless because it's a holistic apprehension that powers my feeling of contentment and, dare I say it, 'happiness' .In summary, what I believe, I'm happy to share and have challenged and put to the test-on the merits that it withstands such tests is such knowledge useful tooth-ers ... if it doesn't then I am happy to have it pointed out, I take criticism well, and will happily re-think my 'convictions'. I'm able to change, to make change, to back down, or throw aside my ego to listen to common-sense, or a better idea. But if I have found something, seen something, felt something, observed something that I think should be shared - could be valuable in the Mind War, - I will employ the full force of my ego in its traditional function to give me 44"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE MIND WAR the right mixture of arrogance and confidence to put my view forth forcefully and as completely as I can -even though that seems to be often at odds with the accepted methods. The majority of people don't attack the tools they in-herit and learn to use because it is seen as intellectual suicide. But I have al-ready dis-covered many things that were extremely difficult to translate from experience into shared essay -and slowly the direction that points toward new tools is coming forth in my efforts to make myself intelligible, despite the obstacles, and despite the intense resistance to change or to see things anew from those steeped in the comfort of traditional knowledge. It is through the direct control of their ego that my companions help me to grow and I help them because of our ability to listen, to teach and learn from one another, to warn each other of pig-headedness or of any absolute think-ing ... yet we each possess a strong ego that has the conviction to pursue its own way forward requiring/accepting no interference from others, no external judgement or control and does not need to suck the energy of others to feel its way forward by reward or punishment. This delicate nuance of when to deploy the strength of the ego to overcome obstacles and challenges with its solidity and when to bring it to heel in order to see reason or through another lrindow other than our present rose-tinted view is difficult to balance, but it serves me well. It is good that you question our forms, as well as not require your ego to be right'. It is healthy to admit you are in an awkward position - so are we, so are all of us.

In many ways it has. Learning about the manner in which the human mind set about or was set in its ways of thinking about things can help explain how re-ligion or science or many of the other things that we have to deal with on a day to day basis in society came about. Add to this sort of learning some of the other schools of thought that have added to or taken from the realm of magick such as philosophy, sociology, in fact virtually anything from medicine to space travel, and it starts to seem like magick has played a part in everything. And this is probably the case. Magick may seem a lost art that requires its en-ergies to be revived, but they are still very much a part of the world -they have simply changed form as people have controlled their fear. Superstition is still a very powerful force with many of its remnants still playing an important role today despite that face that many of us no longer believe in demons, ghosts or vengeful gods who will wither our crops or make us sick if we do not appease them. Even today's superstition is rife within people and culture -and with the Catholic Church no longer burning people at the stake for believing in the su-pernatural or divining the future, the occult arts in particular have become an accepted and tolerated past-time, hobby, serious endeavour or even an occu-pation. But even these overt pagan practices or beliefs aside-the remnants of magic are heavily meshed within our society and day-to-day lives -though the meaning for many of them is forgotten. The act of saying 'God bless you' in case the soul flies away when a sneeze occurs is still an ingrained habit of cramming it back in. Children not stepping on side walk cracks for fear of breaking some taboo or their mother's backs, 46"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"PETALS FROM A BLACK ROSE harks back to the idea of sympathetic magic. Fear of walking under ladders has an uncertain origin -but some say the shape of the leaning ladder forms a triangle, the Symbol of the Holy Trinity and therefore by walking through it, you are violating and desecrating God. There is further evidence for this in the Christian practice of hanging crosses in the corners of rooms (where a tri-angle formed) near the roof-where the Devil's energy/presence was supposed to gather. Many houses built in the Victorian era only a hundred years ago have a pointy spike on the eaves which was originally put there in the belief it would stop witches from landing on the roof. People still go to great lengths to avoid accidentally generating the number 13; 13 guests, living at number 13, or other numbers -many Chinese residencies and even hotels go out of their way to omit the number 4, some hotels refuse to number the fourth floor, or call the room adjacent to room 3, room 3a. And of course who can forget Halloween? A time to put on masks to scare away the devils and demons when they walked the Earth by passing through the threshold between their world and ours, when the gateway was at its thinnest during the Solstice. Many of the world's business brands are named after esoteric or magical themes and their associated gods, such as Mazda -again harking back to Sympathetic Magic and the belief that imitating something can allow some of its energy to be stolen or rub off onto the imitator (the very reason for taking so much care with a company logo). Others include Amazon, Ajax, Atlas, Nike, Orion, Olym-pus, Pegasus and those are just a few Greek Mythology examples. These and thousands more forms and associations come from the realm of magick ... But most people or books can tell you this if indeed you don't know it al-ready. And clearly, on its own, knowing a great deal about these links won't really help you to understand yourself or the environment in which you live your life-So what good is this information? I'll tell you. If you look back through books and records on superstition or Etymology (study of the origin of words) you may discover the origin of an act. For example, the -ring-a-ring-a-rosy song sung by schoolchildren all around the world is actually a ref-erence to the effects of the bubonic plague that decimated all of Europe. Again, more information ... and all the books in the world will offer you more infor-mation than you could ever hope to remember or use- so how does this know-ing the origin of things help you? 47"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"HARUSPEX THE CONTINUITY OF BLOOM There is a secret language here. Few people know it. It is not obvious unless you know what you're looking for, and few people do. What is useful about the two interesting but seemingly useless pieces of information above is that they show you a deeply ingrained pattern. The ring-a-rosy tune is still sung, but few children understand what it means - yet they sing it. They have had it passed down to them, and their parents probably sung it. And so on. And so on. Right back to where it first started. In any case, the song has been pre-served somewhere because children still sing it. This is important because it shows two very interesting things that remain the same despite all the differ-ences in who does what. l) that people often mimic each other from generation to generation. 2) People will carry on doing what they've always done even if they don't know what it used to mean just because they've always done it. People are like sheep. Not necessarily in a very fme order where they all do the same thing ... but over generations and hundreds of years there tend to be patterns that stay with people and these PATTERNS can be played with. Meanings change over time and the heart of many meanings are lost through History-but people show a remarkable tendency to repeat themselves, and that sort of behaviour in itself is just as telling of the human race as the story behind why people avoid black cats. So try to find the original meaning of something, and the current one, especially where superstition is concerned. Why is this important? Because unlike the TV show Charmed, there are no fireballs, no genies, no time travel involved in magic (in theory) -there is in-stead willpower and making happen what you want to happen. And if you hold superstitions yourself such as breaking mirrors or crossing black cats equals bad luck-magic is controlling you rather than you controlling it. Be-cause somewhere down the line someone has put in motion the idea that walk-ing under ladders is bad luck (rather than simply a risk of being unsafe), there are now thousands of people who refuse to walk under a ladder. Yet, I've walked under ladders many times and nothing has happened to me. The same goes for the mystical idea of magic coming back 'three-fold'. And I've been practising magic for years. 48"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"PETALS PROM A BLACK ROSE What you're actually dealing with when you talk about magic is r the power of belief. In most people the power of belief is very strong and thev will do or not do anything that might affect their power of belief. Yet at the same time they are totally in thrall to what they believe and TillS can be played with too. I suggest trying the following exercise to give you a practical bands-on experience of the power of belief: -Find someone who is superstitious, and try and get them to break their su-perstition by walking under a ladder, or breaking a mirror, or opening an um-brella inside or whatever it is they are superstitious about. Chances are high they won't be willing or able to defy their superstition. -Whether you succeed or not in getting them to break it, break the same su-perstition yourself. Can you do it? If so, why? If not, why? Magick takes many forms. But before you can start with the outside you have to begin with the inside. Therefore you have to know what's inside you. RED OR WHITE In my opinion, the existence of either form of \"luck\" is entirely up to our own discretion. We choose to let it exist, either for us or for other people. Luck could be considered the opposing force of fate. In a world ruled by fate, there is destiny, a set outcome for each of us from birth. In a world with the possi-bility of chance, i.e. \"Luck\" there is the view that we are free to make our own destinies and that these are subject to shifts and changes from outside forces. But in a world ruled by luck there is always a chance to redeem one's life if it's going down the tubes since there is a belief that circumstances can always be changed. Therefore, good luck, and bad luck-are the same thing, they are \"luck\" and believing in luck, represents the desire to choose a world where we make our own destinies, our own luck. The belief in luck is therefore an indicator of something bigger-it tells us the kind of force which a person be-lieves or would like to believe dominates the world and thus something fun-damental about them. 49"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"HARUSPEX There are two kinds of view, according to Nietzsche: Dionysian, and Apol-lonian. Dionysian basically means a view of the world where the world is con-stantly changed by creation and destruction - each force as beneficial as the other. Apollonian basically means a view of the world where the world is set, is perfect and stays the same. In the Apollonian world there is no luck, things change according to plan -there is fate and destiny. it is already planned and nothing can alter this plan. This Apollonian and Dionysian view is also indi-cated by a person's belief in superstition. Once you know whether you possess the Apollonian or Dionysian view, you may begin to see how powerful these two kinds of perspective are or can be, and how useful they can be to deter-mine someone's personality. THE BLACK SPOT Naturally I expect you to test this for yourself if you have any doubts. The efficacy. or 'truth' of something lies in whether using information or methods you are given enables you to work magic. But magic requires extensive labour even before you attempt to use it. It is important that you start off with a con-fident belief in your own abilities and keep in the back of your mind the sim-ple maxim that nobody can give you magickal prowess. No-one can elevate you to a status of witch or magician using some mystical mumbo jumbo cere-mony overnight. And no one can help you better than you can help yourself. For this reason, I urge you to test the theories you are given. Being told some-thing does not lead to wisdom of that thing. Being told something is only hav-ing knowledge. Hands-on experience and experiment MUST be combined with this knowledge if you are to gain anything from it. Most importantly-knowledge does not have an identical effect when com-bined with experience with anybody. Only you can discover whether you are right or wrong-by gathering as much experience and knowledge as you can in order to combine them into wisdom. Others should not make such judge-ments as to your rightness or wrongness in things, but be assured they will try. My view is that only you can do that-self-judgement is the sign of a great magician -and obviously my view is just a view. If you seek someone who 50"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"PETALS FROM A BLACK Ro-. will give you spurious grades and degrees of magickal you instant enlightenment - there are plenty of groups kind of 'training' in the occult who will make you feel p carry you along in their arms to whatever titles you wish ~ ever -herein lies the first test. Ora et Labora. Do you have raise yourself above the rabble by blood sweat and tears. bv it on your own steam -or do you seek easy answers and a offer you a quick path to enlightenment? Once you answer this what to do next. CRoss AND CUTTING As an example, I can offer you my own experience with anger and depression as useful tools regarding the occult. For many years I tried to use Satanism as an outlet for my anger and depression -but rather than try to understand where my anger or depression came from or what part it played within me ei-ther as a defence mechanism or a survival mechanism-I used BLAME to direct my anger and depression onto other things away from myself. I ran in a circle with my feelings. First, feeling angry or depressed, I would find what had ap-parently caused my anger or depression and make it responsible for blame. By blaming others, in fact by using the excuse of BLAME at all, I would conse-quently justify having anger or depression as being caused by this THING I chose to blame. By doing this over and over, I sustained the idea that outside things were responsible for my anger etc.; a REALITY. Therefore, I clouded 1/HAT and WHERE my anger and depression genuinely came from. I believe the source of anger and depression usually forms in the formative years of wur life when you are most vulnerable to the effects of your environment but ~X~~~Sequently unconscious of them. I could not see that it was my PERSPEC-TIVE that caused both anger and depression. So rather than look back into the painful past for clues, I covered the present scapegoats for my pain. Some years later, when I learned the wisdom of There is no Blame'-I felt free to tackle my deep pains and realised the cause my depression was caused by none other than a lack of UNDERSTANDING 51"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"HARUSPEX -the very thing I had gotten into magic for and to gain. I had blamed people for a long time for what I had deemed 'faults with myself' and this had made me feel all sorts of guilt and self-pity ... But I discovered it was healthy to ex-ercise hate with things that caused me anger or depression (dangerous not to), but also healthy to exercise compassion that the very things that had made me confused (i.e. angry and depressed because I felt I was not allowed to face them because it would involve tearing down walls of love and family, etc.) had ALSO been under the same influence of this confusion. I had no way of knowing what or how my parents went through life, for instance, but I did know that they too were subjected to things that caused misunderstanding, and appar-ently these were passed down to me in the natural cycle of parent / child re-lationships ... As, in theory, I too will pass to my child in turn. I think anger and depression are symptomatic. They represent that some-thing has occurred within us that has created these two states-states that are indicators of what has occurred within us. I suggest it is similar to feeling pain when you are injured, to warn you that your organism is not well. But, like an injury, if one does not heed the warning of pain that indicates one is injured, and ignores it, the warning is practically useless. The same goes for anger or depression. They indicate something, not necessarily negative, has occurred within you that has resulted in the presence of either or both of these two states, like warnings that something may be wrong or imbalanced. I found and confronted (and continue to do so) the root cause of my pain and anger which I have done extensively through writing for many years, as a way of letting go of what hurt me without hurting the people who were involved- because of love, compassion and the wisdom that they too arefwere subject to the same process I AM. I confronted my dark side, my deep shady dungeon-and fought the monsters that dwelt there. It was painful and very hard it hurt my ego very much. But after slaying many of these monsters I saw something very powerful in the act. No longer in fear of my past and then understanding it, the monsters became part of me-united with me because they no longer have control over me. They are part of me. And I am part of them. And all of us are part of IT. Where there is terrible hurt and suffering-the hardest thing not to do - is repeat the cycle. 52"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"PETALS FROM A BLACK. Ro Anger and depression will go together, and you and such things being angry orfand depressed.

You not get far on your journey with these forces driving you. You must drive them. HY11RID PERPETUAL Perhaps we should move on to another exercise and introduce a few means to achieve them in traditional magical methodology. Think about something you want. Something you desire. It can be a small thing or a big thing. A job. Money. Love. Etc. Feel free to use one or all of the following methods to achieve it: Sigil magic: write down what you want, then tangle the letters into a symbol. How? The idea is make the desire unconscious so that your waking mind does not sabotage you in getting it. Remove the vowels, so the phrase \"I want to make a million dollars\" would look like \"wnt t mk mlln dllrs\". Jumble the letter spaces: wn tmk mind llrs. And again, removing a few random letters, capitalizing others: Nw kMt dim IrS. Now stylize each letter and draw your-self a picture with the letters by combining them to-gether, overlapping them, turning them back-to-front until they no longer resemble the sentence at all. It must become intelligible to the conscious mind. Concentrate on this symbol for a few minutes before you go to sleep and think hard about your desire coming true. Sympathetic Magic: this is the art of creating a bond in one object with an-other, i.e. a clay doll with a living person.

If you wish love, acquire an article if possible of the one you love, and attach it to a clay or wax doll that you design to resemble the person you want. The more of their personal possessions, or hair, nail clip-pings, clothing you can add to the doll, the better. Create another doll of you -symbolically join the two dolls by tying them together or marrying them via ceremony. Visualise your desire coming true, as vividly detailed as you can. Visualisation: An easy, silent, but powerful magical method. Simply imagine as strongly as you can your desire coming true. The more detail you can manage the better.
