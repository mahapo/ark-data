'They' are of Thanaterotic nature, mething forgotten by the present human species but well-known by their '.l' ancestors, especially the Celts and Thracians, but also by other peoples -.ell. \"Thanaterotic\" simply means combining Eros and Thanatos, sex and simultaneously: two elements of opposite energy charge which generate opposite emotions -those of lust and terror, of total attraction and repul-simultaneously, but yet paradoxically contain each other within them-ves. The Dark Ones could be perceived by such a paradoxical sense only -They beyond the duality of the reasoning consciousness, beyond the dual code the mind, and so They could cause the mind to collapse when perceived -· that ecstatic part of the mind called by the ancient Germanic shamans rud\" (where the name of Wothan derives from), which is the divine madness, oould perceive Them. Opening one's senses to the energies of the stars and combining them within a sex-magickal ritual in a place of earth power -in fact, the idea of the Rite of Nine Angles -would do wonders provided one isn't some intellectual con-ceptualist only. On finding and initiating a sex-magickal partner, it's vital that the Thanaterotic Illumination is to be sought by exploring different sexualities and roles with each other. A sinister couple should experiment, however, with each other first. One should lead the other till near-death experience and then change their roles. No need to mention the amount of mutual confidence and trust necessary while indulging in such psycho-dramas. 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA Yet it shouldn't be like some soft BDSM whipping play, or like the ego-tick-ling rituals of the lOT which are a mockery of their own name. For example, the psycho-drama shouldn't be less than an art of demonic acting assuming for instance the role of a priest who is to sacrifice the female, or a priestess who is to sacrifice the male, to the Dark Ones-They who are in fact predatory aliens that feed voraciously on human sexual lust and the terror of death ex-perienced simultaneously. Regarding preparation, an analogy is useful here of an unusual habit per-formed by two lionesses which after catching an antelope alive, licked its gen-itals in order to arouse it sexually before killing it. The efficient Sinister predators cook their meat before they eat it - ideally it should first be relaxed, its toxicity by the deathjterror hormones balanced or reduced by those gen-erated by the counter-act of sexual arousal. So inclined are the Dark Ones when they consume their human food via the rituals of sacrifice, and so was cooked the priest of Dionysos - aroused to death by the Bacchans. In this -the opfer is to be willing and not resisting, or, willing and resisting simultaneously till at last sjhe gives up in an orgasmic death. This operation needs great subtlety, and precise balance of energies-no desperation should poison the ecstasy. After all, the Dark Ones are the greater parts of our-selves who feed on the lower life-(lower in the sense of organic, not lower in some hierarchy). So, the psycho-drama being led to its final act (or, to be more accurate, stopped just before its final act), so the process may be continued, one proceeds to adopt the role of the opfer and the one's lover an opportunity to demon-strate her own ingenuity to show how she as a priestess would sacrifice him to the Dark Ones, thus allowing each to experience the Illumination of Thanateros in a way as real as possible-but without a lethal end - since there is a lot of work to be done yet. At the very least such an approach allows its participants to have a glimpse beyond the Gate and into the Abyss where the Dark Ones abide. I see this as an initiatory training marking the passage between the Mercury sphere and 8"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AN APPROACH TO SEX MAGICK Venus sphere, the path of Change itself. A training which would loosen ego's grip better than any other training.

One more thing I should add however, -and its of absolutely crucial im-rtance in sex magick -and that is that effective and genuine magick, espe-'black', will not work if the partners are bored while they are fucking-is, the sex lacks vibrancy, enjoyment, fulfillment both physically and emo-ually. This lack of sexual enjoyment is what gave such tremendous power the Magian (Qv. On Fanaticism and Militant Satanism) and created and ere-their brutal shock troops. Sex should always be as enjoyable as possible for both partners and hereunto -one is advised to learn many ways to pleasure the opposite sex in many parts the body and mind, including footjheadjbody massage, hugging, kissing, simple affection, fmding their erogenous zones, simple romantic gestures, mu-masturbation, laughter, as well as an exploration of as many kinds of sex lS desired including anal, oral, bisexual, etc. 9"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE ORb AL OF THE NINTH MOON AN LHP APPROA H '1'0 A ACTING THE OPPOSITE SEX & PfiYSI&LLt MA a:FEST G nlE A lMAj ANIMUS Arguably one of the hardest challenges of the Sinister Path is locating a mag-ically empathic partner with which to work upon the Path with. No detail is given in Naos as to how one fmds a magical partner to undertake the Sinister Path with-an omission which has led to many an exasperated magician. The Temple of THEM fills this notorious gap by presenting one particular type of ritual Sorcery that worked to bring about the manifestation of the Anima in flesh for the author via an ancient method of the magicians. The basic premise of the sorcery at hand is in the power of WordfWyrd and using the gathering and release of sexual tension to entice the Cosmos (via the vehicle of the Dark Ones) to manifest HerfHim after enough sexual energy has been stored to cause a significant disturbance to the flow of the Cosmic tides of Sex and Death. A tattered scrap of this ancient method of honour remains enshrined in the heav-ily bastardised magian adage -'you can achieve anything if you believe in yourself'. According to a Tradition of Sorcery-the keys to summoning the Dark Ones are Sex and Death. Sex and Death are tides of energy that if sufficiently stored up, can allow brief, or even permanent escape from the Cosmic Being, or in ONA terminology, from one's DestinyjWyrd-allowing one to implement their own. The Cosmic Being is like a vortex that seeks to devour the energy of each human being and draw them and their energy back into its Unity. Sex and Death are its breathing pattern of inhalationfexhalation. Perceived this way, the Cosmic Being is the force that magicians must try to escape from in order to become Immortal, or Acausal. The causal acts of SexfDeath release the stored energy of an individual back into the collective. The way to free oneself from that Unity is to abstain from 10"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE ORDEAL OF THE NINTH MOON Or rather, to abstain from orgasm, while still generating sexual energy, ei-by masturbation, or sex without ejaculation. This lingering threshold of red sexual energy tempts or lures the Cosmic Being to try to take it from Becau se of this, the magician can bargain with the Cosmic Being for certain ors to be bestowed (a vow) before they will give up that energy. In this way Dark Ones can be enticed to manifest in the presence of a magician by Jure of sexual energy generated before orgasm -or the co-mingling of the e-sexualliquids of the female, and the pre-cum of the male -and kept man-by the repeated generation of this most powerful elixir. This limpid juice' elieved to be one of the most powerful elixirs in magical practice, perhaps more so than the red elixir of the beheaded opfer. Our Anima wants to manifest. We feel its power every time we fall in Love experience Lust. Our Anima is then projected onto another human being we come to see that human shell as imbued with that projection - seeing _ thinking of that shell as the very living breathing fantasy of our Anima the flesh, although this process is often unconscious and beyond our control. b en our alchemical growth is altered as we grow psychically, the Anima un-rgoes changes too, and we may come to see that the person we are with, no oger fits us or the ideal of our anima. We then retract it from them, with the o.sequence that we fall out of love. This is very important to understand in lltempting the Ordeal of the Ninth Moon-and in determining a psychic vam-.re from the Anima. The Anima is an organic projection that falls on to people causes us to perceive them as Hir.

If a male, one may begin by drawing a pentagram with an erect cock-the phallus being the nat-ural wand of the male magickian, it should be used accordingly. If female -one may begin by drawing a pentagram with a finger greased with the liquids of the vagina1• Thus is the visualization energized and brought to life. You could promise the Dark One that you would sacrifice your sperm to It only when mingled with female sexual liquids -which is precisely what It wants. So It may even be persuaded to help you in hunting your game. When evoking the Dark Ones the phallus should be considered itself a mag-ickal wand and the vagina the very sigil of the Dark Ones. Herein the specific method is a matter of taste, but one approach is to mas-turbate (switch on the wand in the case of the male) whilst invoking the Dark One that one wishes to commune with -i.e. Baphomet. Try to sustain a prolonged plateau of excitement holding back the urges to ejaculate. The prolonged plateau of excitement while concentrating on the sigil assures an energy field for the Dark One to manifest. The longer that plateau -the better. Ejaculation is not recommended except as an extreme form of sacrifice and only provided the goddess has already manifested and demanded it. Ejaculate only if the Dark One has manifested and demanded your orgasm. 1The Ordeal of the Ninth Moon is primarily designed for males - see \"The Quest of the LHP\" not out of any intended predilection or chauvinism but because the mysteries of the female aspects remain shrouded and could only be divulged by direct exploration and experiment by each Sor-ceress. Here the female reader is prompted to look into what Jung has to say about the Anima/An-imus wherein he even proposed there being multiple Anima's within the feminine psyche. After all, what is the Anima/Animus, if not the sum of all that one lacks, the sum of all one's deficits, a non-being which paradoxically starts to have a real existence, to sharpen one's libido and define one's value system? 12"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE ORDEAL OF THE NINTH MOON _ ote that it is possible to experience orgasm of a dulled sort without spilling s semen -but any full ejaculation without express demand by the Dark will put one back at square one, day one, of the Nine Months. called to release give yourself totally to the experience and Dark One. and dissolve in the vision beyond.

This introduction touches more deeply on how such forms collectively act ~ the service of a higher magic of human ingenuity by crafting a story or .-vtbos of narrative magic for others to follow and champion -thereby gen-rating fanatical devotion and increasing the number of characters involved ~ the mythos's narrative, nurturing others to live out that narrative via the ~rops provided, and use such narrative to create subtle and overt changes in \" Matrix. Such changes can culminate in the creation of one form of the fa-ed Diamond Body. Narrative magick\", as coined by the Temple, pertains to an acknowledge-ment and interest in the existence (persistence) of a story-like quality inherent a single or multiple set of forms that is partly conscious and partly uncon-aous and possesses the power to affect human beings directly. The conscious aspect of narrative magic exists in the continuum of a par-.::-ular set of forms forming a suitable platform or stage upon which certain . -chetypal resonances can be comfortably projected by an individual or group, md a reciprocal projection received. That is not to say that an individual will necessarily be conscious that sfhe being utilized as part of a magickal story (that is not necessary), but rather that because of the power invested in forms collectively by the human race, the necessary conditions created for a being to want to invest time and energy 15"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA in being a part of the 'story' being presented (narrated) can be made 'visible', not only to the individual, but to the collective. The conscious aspect works on the adage \"if you build it-THEY will come.\" The unconscious aspect of narrative magick is rather more mysterious, and a rational analysis can be said to be most difficult if not largely impossible due to inaccessibility to the collective unconscious psyche. However-it is a fact-that stories and mythos play an extremely vital role in the perception and re-action of humanity. Few stories have motivated humanity more than those of creation; the Eddas, the Baghadvita, the Koran, the Bible, for instance are strong examples of narrative magic that seek to provide direction and a moral compass, a praxis and a weltanschauung for humanity. These and many other examples of Creation and End Time stories have survived, some for thousands of years, through the living of their narrative by hundreds of generations of avid listeners and worshipers caught up in the power of their respective Mythos. Even today, more than two thousand years later-the Mythos of Buddha, of Mohammed, of Jesus, lives on in the hearts and minds of billions of be-lievers, motivated by the word that compels them live their life for such a rea-son, in such a way. No one can refute the tremendous power of religion nor its little brother politics - a younger and less archaic form of narrative -but one which has demonstrated it too has tremendous power to manipulate the lives of people and to use that power to cement forms into being or smash them out of existence, time and time again. To bring us closer to home we spoke of the Mythos of the Illuminati being a chance occurrence that propelled a humble gesture in the throes of sulphur in the 1700's into the annals of history as the single most powerful expression to describe the ultimate collective sinister conspiracy. The human imagination is a wondrous thing, a dangerous thing. but a wondrous thing all the same. For all their actual power, reach, wisdom, and truth, whether religion, politics, se-cret organizations, or a garage sale-without others adding to the story, with-out others 'reading' or being absorbed by the Mythosjforms being unfolded-the Mythos fades into obscurity. There are countless examples of attempts to 16"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"art secret societies that have failed because of a lack of the Mythos being eked up and carried away on the lips as reputation. Jung believed that the rise to individual power is reciprocal, in that the col-ctive must desire the individual to assume the role as an individual separate om the collective for such a relationship to work. To encourage this relation--artificially where resistance is met usually involves propaganda and the c:rsuasion of the people. The failure of varied temples and orders, even in my short lifetime with the cult of eighteen years, appears to be regularly due to the collective resistance an idea that is presented out of time, that is, asynchronously with the needs the collective psyche at that moment of collective development. The make break elements of a successful formation appear to rely on such key char-r::teristics as synchronicity, solidarity, proximity, and a message congruous time. If one is able to tap into the collective messages being given by the unconscious collective psyche -to discern the particular push being given 17"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA from beneath or beyond, by deduction-one can theoretically ride that wave, provided one is in sync with it, and does not attempt to subvert the natural process. This synchronicity with the Acausal Voice, does not suit many forms for the propensity of humans seeking control via form and mythos does not usually function on altruism selflessness or a desire to presence the will of the cosmos -and the collective unconscious is its own law and its own physis working independently of the consciousness. As dreaming shows us, themes-sages of the collective psyche are mostly in contradiction to the current psychic conscious state of humanity and are as hard to swallow as they are to hear. Narrative magick involves an individual assessment insofar as it is possible to assess such a scope, of the preset and emerging signs of the individual and collective psyche on a national scale -using such means as the appearance of the architecture, the disposition or attitude, level of perception, level of tech-nology, economic, social and racial factors, political climate, and to a great ex-tent, media. For today, it is media and the forms of technology that carry the media (be-hold the information age!) that are the equivalent of the oral storytellers of myth and magic and story and for that role they receive worship and adoration for the fire-side tales they weave. And because such stories still derive from the collective unconscious -pushing through in archetypal resonances and archetypes, dreams, visions, and forms-they form patterns in a synchronous fashion expressing a similar archetypal message in any variety of forms. This form of magick also utilizes a derivative of the ancient belief in the micro-cosmos and macro-cosmos being reflections of and in the other though not to such an extent that the two are believed to represent a mirror-image. It could also be called a type of sympathetic magic, akin to as above so below, wherein creating a certain alchemical change within the individual naturally has an effect on the outer world, with the potential for a knock-on effect and the re-effecting of the individual. A direct connection to the collective psyche is necessary for the imbuing of forms with the numinous pull-the desire in others to want to manifest them. 18"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NARRATIVE MAGIC ••• However, another important aspect of Narrative magick is to 'control the ll:ory' or to capture the idea in dramatic theatrical terms; 'direct the actors' rithin the play. Form plays a crucial part in this, for if one is trying to intro-duce the means to re-direct a current presenting itself in the here and now; it not always enough to present a good argument for ones case. It is considered _general rule that while people are clinically unpredictable, when they com-municate via various forms of media they do try to be logical -and logic quickly draws a circle around the contents to be made logical in order to form their train of thoughts. Because of this habit, people generally restrict their discussion to the relevant topic using the content provided as cues for what is ~propriate -and 'stick to the subject' -as it were. However, time, and the status quo of all that it encompasses, is often at odds with new ideas, and new ideas often go by the wayside due to lack of interest and especially-a lack of involvement by others in those ideas (relating back to the necessity of others be captured by form for it to live). It is especially true that it merely takes one or two other people to express interest in something and others will nat-urally follow -first out of curiosity -and secondly out of habit. However someone taking an interest does not guarantee the lifespan of an idea- a form's life requires constant nurturing until it reaches a critical mass. It can also be a matter of frustration that the 'right questions' are not being asked, that would lead to a certain collective viewpoint being achieved by the group; this is most often the case when someone is trying to present something ahead of, or, out of time, with the current era and its particular set(s) of noetic characteristics. In such cases, an individual conducting narrative magick can IJI'OVide that interest themselves by creating a second or even multiple anony-mous personas to engage in discussing the topic, thus raising two walls or forms the opposite ends of the idea, trapping or restricting the topic and the circle uound which others will draw their logic in their attempt to join in -to the rel-evant narrative. With the creation of enough 'closed circuits' -or people ma-nipulated into talking about a form-it can reach critical mass, by which is meant e point where less and less of one's own narrative magick is required to keep form afloat and functional, but the form continues to perpetually replicate. 19"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA The new form presents an alternate choice, a divergence from the norm, at least for a while where most forms are concerned, but if taking its cues from the collective unconscious; it is possible that a form could arise that has all the power and duration of a thermodynamic explosion. And by this is meant the possibility for great and wondrous leaps in perception, understanding and wis-dom on a collective level-but also the terrifying raw power of the unconscious to be mishandled, misunderstood, and incinerate those attempting to usurp it. The Temple of THEM cannot with any sagacity predict the outcome of its main and many side-experiments with the collective psyche on the collective mass -this is unmapped and dangerous territory, especially since with our arising, such an approach to magick may become 'popular' with others trying to emulate us in some fashion or another (as humans are wont to do), and a large number of people performing similar experimentation has the potential to wreak terrific collective and individual psychic harm. It is moot to argue for the power of the word or of one individual to affect a nation. I could cite a hundred examples throughout history of men and women who have made a significant difference to the world through lone ac-tion or inaction (fate is fickle!). But I choose to cite Veronica Guerin, the famous Irish reporter who was shot to death on the Naas road in Dublin for her at-tempts to expose those saturating Ireland with heroin in the 1990's. Veronica was the only woman (read person) brave enough to stand up to the dealers, even after she was savagely beaten, shot and threatened - she continued to doggedly pursue leads and publish inflammatory articles in the paper in her quest to save the kids of Ireland from the heroin epidemic - all the while knowing in her heart it was only a matter of time before she was to suffer the consequences of her exposes. Her writing and her death galvanized the entire country to oust the dealers from Ireland and form new anti-drug legislation. Keep in mind that it was only in 1996 that the first Irishman went into a wit-ness protection program-prior to that, i.e. dating from the very birth of Ire-land, you were on your own. The Irish are a hard people. Lastly, the conditions for narrative magic appear to require a period of im-plementation, execution, and narration spanning at least thirty years.

Although in some ways the term draws parallels from the creature of the cultus that has arisen around the 'psychic vampire'-THEM refer to a specific state of being which occupies immediate proximity to a magician, separate from the astral-based wraith reputed to use psychic tendrils and methods of remote drain. The former is believed more prevalent and more dangerous owing to its im-mediate visibility and physicaljpsychical threat, rather than the latter, which is seen (except under special conditions) as a phantasm of paranoia feared only by the superstitious and credulous. ON RECOGNISING THEIR POISONS AND THE MEANS TO THEIR DESTRUCTION Members of THEM have noted a connexion between the psychological emer-gence of the Self and extra-sensitivity to the psychic emanations coming from persons in thrall to a particular state of imprisonment by the Ego. Viz. the \"psychic vampire\". Raised awareness of these emanations stems from successful psychic growth of the Self -where there is developed as a reaction to magicaljmental enlight-enment, a super-sensitive distinction between the two states or modes of mind that govern the organism via particular energies that actively attempt to sustain their domination by suppressing the other mode. The two major modes of being, Ego and Self, were articulated in \"Radia Sol\" as autonomous sentients, referred to as 'Psychanisms', that inhabit the mind. Psychanisms struggle to gain complete control over the psychic faculties of the host organism, and in doing so, determine the energetic mode of the host organism and characterize its level of relatedness to the world around it. Let us turn our attention to one of these modes in particular: the infamous Ego. 22"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ON PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM THE DEVil. OF TiiE EGO ,\\n examination of the Ego is best achieved from the higher degree of the mode Self, whereupon a greater contrast is afforded to study of the Ego because : the distance in psychic growth between the Self and the Ego, than an ex-amination of the Ego from its own mode. First, clarification of a common misunderstanding concerning the Ego and Its erroneous relation to 'selfishness'. The concept of Ego is often used interchangeably with the concept of Self and is said to be highly 'self-centred' or 'selfish'-which is an unfortunate use of words and association - for the Self and the Ego have almost nothing in common. The Ego is better termed 'narcissistic' in that it exists for its own sake. Sloppy distinction between the two terms and generalizing of their re-spective powers is symptomatic of an organism in thrall to the Ego-centric per-spective and a weak undefined sense of the separate Self. 'Selfish-ness' is an unfortunate exoteric social construct used by Ego-centred societies to punish an individual for exhibiting an act of independent will that significantly disrupts the established etiquette of esoteric energy exchange. The Self doesn't require external energy-the Ego does, but the enmity/resistance of the Ego toward the emergence of Self (the arrival of which threatens to ex-tinguish it) often surfaces in the terminology of the Ego-centred society because being acutely prideful the Ego is so hypersensitive and fragile that it cannot blame itself, and hence even other Ego's blame the Self aspect in an organism as responsible for anything actually caused by Ego. In this respect, it is ex-tremely difficult for the Self to emerge and every attempt to do so is condemned r>y the many sanctions in place heavily policed by the tyranny of the ego. The lack of social emphasis placed on dreams despite their prevalence as a vivid phenomenon and the dismissing of them as fancy or rubbish is attribut-able to the fear of the Self and its signs. The ego's treatment of the Self can be likened to the Christian treatment of the Sinister: as Devil incarnate. 23"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA CHAMEI.EONICS As covered in our Temple, Manifesto, the Ego exists as a reaction to the Abyss and is motivated by a drive to conceal Darkness/Chaos with the Matrix. To this end the primary art/industry of the Ego is deception and illusion; skills that every human being naturally excels and becomes adept at. Hence all human beings are 'scorpions' blind to their Ego's origin (and innate tyranny) and one must always remember that origin. The Ego is capable of weaving ex-traordinarily powerful magical spells of form in its bid to deceive. The growth of the Ego in both its young and its mature stage is easily illustrated by com-paring a young child and an adult whose profession involves the ability to lie (though it should be apparent that it is the profession of all human beings to lie as part of their survival drive). A child is sociopathic and is concerned with sating desire and urges immediately and its attempts to lie are usually trans-parent and clumsy. But an adult is able to wait and to defer gratification until the time comes that the desire can be safely or privately sated, and is able to deftly conceal secretive intention with the guise of outward appearance. The methods of an organism's guise are influenced by the elements that were involved in the organisms early problem solving. The basic art of decep-tion begins with the child re-enacting the elements that lead to the sating of a particular desire. I.e. a baby cries to get more milk or attention. If milk arrives when it cries it may eventually make an association (or mental connexion) be-tween crying and getting milk. Such associations rapidly grow in complexity; a small boy may break something in order to get in trouble with the specific intent to re-create the satisfaction and praise that comes from being re-assured and comforted in fixing it or cleaning the mess up, once the stage of the stern telling off has passed. These means of 'provoking a certain situation or out-come' are like a natural form of magic that is rooted in the basic urge of sur-vival and averting danger or unpleasantness by acts of camouflage and deception, play-acting or mimesis (mimicking expected or habitual behaviour). Habitual behaviours of deception hecome ingrained in the organism as a means of defence not only against danger, but against being thwarted in its 24"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ON PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM will. The guises used often become extremely complex over time as an organ-ism is required to formulate many different strategies of deception to deal with a variety of situations that require different kinds of manipulation. And such guises are not strictly limited to individuals, that is, to the realm of the per-sonal. Because the Ego thrives in a construct of mass deception (i.e. the Ma-trixjsociety), the practice of deception naturally filters through individuals and into larger bodies or groups of people such as political or religious move-ments'. A good example of the innate obsession with deception by human be-ings is found in the behaviour of the Russians and the Americans during the Cold War. Both Countries exhibited an amplification of the chameleonic ten-dencies of the human by disguising their political plans, intentions and move-ments and using codes, spies, intense secrecy and espionage en masse in the race to deceive the other about their nuclear capabilities. In this scenario, both Russia and America excelled in demonstrating not only the extent of creativity human beings may go to so as to cloak outward appearances, but that the in-ability to feel secure by one organism is a contagion that can affect others and manifest as a mass obsessive desire. EGO 101 Radia Sol also related a theory as to why the majority of human organisms are ruled by the Ego (due to an inability to recognize the Self), and so remain pris-oners in psychic thrall to the drives of their limbic system or reptilian energy base. The 'reptilian energy base' is the lowest mode of reasoning used by an organism concerning how to solve the immediate problems it faces or satisfy its base 'animal' type urges and desires. Such urges are rooted in the primal base, such as hunger and how to get food, thirst and how to get water, lust and how to sate it, the urge to procreate or acquisitiveness, for example, and the drive to sate these needs as quickly as possible. IJ:t is theorized that collective concentrations of energy by human beings can take on a life of their own and constitute a larger 'organism': belief, form, city. Ethos, etc., and that such 'organisms' - tilled into being by mass human energetic concentration can eclipse the dependency on human energy and manifest separately as a psychical demon. 25"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA Because it's not always safe or advisable to sate ones desires immediately, human beings became chameleonsfscorpions: masters of deception that de-vised subtle or gross ways of getting exactly what they wanted ( Qv. Theory of the Beast). When they couldn't get what they wanted immediately and their desire was thwarted, it was the element of the psyche called the Ego that became frus-trated and caused the organism to throw a tantrum, fly into a rage, weep or cry, or use all means possible to cleverly find a way to overcome the obstacles that beset the Ego's goal. Likewise it was the Ego that caused feelings of joy or the act of laughter and a sense of celebration when the Ego achieved its aim and fulfilled its desire. Exactly what those desires were was determined by a great many factors, in-cluding the time a person was born into, the technology available in that time, the moralfethical background of that person, the culture in which one lived, early impressions of the world, pleasant or negative experiences and any marked effect they had on the understanding or perception of solving prob-lems, dealing with frustration, co-operating with others, trust, love and a host of other indeterminable factors. Precisely because the host of factors involved in shaping the Ego is so large (composed of a deeply profound network of rea-son, memory, experience, ploy, problem solving, ethics, behaviour, emotion, sensatorium and many more diverse and intricate mental equations and con-tents) the Ego is occult and private. Some of the connections an organism's Ego makes between one thing and another can, for instance, be grossly estimated through observing the actions or reasoning of the organism-or guessed at by a deduction of the organism's drive or motivation to act or speak the way it has as a means to satisfy some secret urge. But on the whole, the behaviour of persons and the diversity of their manner of private reason remains a mystery. It is not then possible to discern wholly the contents of the intricate organic 'clockwork' that exists in the mental net of an organism, or fathom the virtu-ally infinite calculations and connexions made by the Ego to solidify the sep-26"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"ON PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM arate elements of the world into one cohesive weltanschauung or world-view that governs how that organism reacts to the world, to other organisms, and to itself. However, it is not necessary to have a complete understanding of an organ-ism's private mental contents in order to recognise the energetic network formed inside an organism symptomatic of psychic vampirism -whereupon the external repetitions of an organism's behaviour or drives can reveal if a certain connexion has been affected or damaged by way of a potent desire left unfulfilled, if the organism harbours a compulsive urge that cannot be ful-filled, if there is an addiction or obsession with calculating or re-experiencing a particular connexion, if a traumatic experience has caused a stagnancy in the growth of any particular connexion or the network of connexions as a whole, or if there exists some other frustration occurring in the processes of the mental network that results in the organism being unable to make further connexions, causes the organism to make irrational andfor unreasonable con-nexions, or if the organism is trapped in a particular cycle of connexions. THE ESSENCE OF THE PSYCHIC VAMPIRE Although the 'pathology' of a person (i.e. the cause of their actions or speech) can be guessed at or to some degree ascertained, it cannot be definitively known owing to its enormous intricacy of billions of connexions. There are neverthe-less specific characteristics associated with a psychic vampire that help to iden-tify it. The first of these is insecurity. The second is a lack of genuine sympathy (i.e. lacking in feeling for the other person and only relating to the world via themselves). A third is concealed narcissism, and a fourth, priority. In the most literal sense, it is a missing, loose, or 'insecure' mental connection that causes the specific neuroses and pathology of an individual. Without being able to complete a mental calculation owing to a complication in the men-tal process for that connexion-the individual is frustrated in their attempts to process an experience, idea or emotion holistically, i.e. using the whole of their faculties to bring a mental process to a satisfactory conclusion. Instead, 27"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA a loose or insecure connexion becomes a focus of obsession whereby the indi-vidual becomes trapped in a loop trying to complete the missing information with only the information it already has, unsuccessfully. If the connexion can-not be formed by the agency of the organism itself, it requires the connexion to be made artificially via the agency of others. To do this it evokes or 're-stages' the conditions that were present when the connexion was first dam-aged. This is usually an unconscious re-enactment, powered by a conscious drive that 'something' is missing and that 'something' can be found if only this or that situation is brought about. Such evocation is intended to bring about the creation of an element or the elements that 'fill in' for the missing component that would lead to satisfaction, and the ability of the organism to move on and form new connexions by shifting its obsessive focus from that injured connexion. The behaviour of an organism involved in setting up those unconscious conditions requires other organisms to assist-to supply the energetic outlay that the psychic vampire needs to begin. This is where energetic exchange, en-ergy drain and psychic rape come in. ENERGETIC EXCHANGE Energetic exchange is usually reciprocal. Throughout life, the Ego will attempt to balance its energetic expenditure by playing an endless game of gambling in gain and loss. In exchanging 'good morning' with a friend or stranger on the street the Ego expends some of its energy in a calculated risk to gain back more energy or at least break even. If the person replies in a manner that is conducive to the conditions re-quired by our Ego to count it as a gain, or energetic reward. That is, if the Ego wants the person to reply in a like manner to count the risk of expenditure a successful gamble by affirming to the personality that it is a \"good, likeable, friendly\" person for instance, and this is the sort of identity that corresponds with the organisms sense of \"I\" -then the personality or \"I\" receives an en-ergetic gain that makes it feel good. 28"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ON PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM How good it feels, depends on how important it is to the Ego to assert the elements that define the identity of the organism. If someone has interest in being a happy person, then having someone return a warm reply will have a higher energetic return to that person than it will to a person accustomed to being suspicious of strangers. If there were to be a loss though, and the person replied rudely, for instance, not only would we have lost our original energetic wager, but we would have suffered a further loss of energy when our Ego's gamble to gain energy is taxed further from a reprisal that injures its pride or sense of \"I\". In such a case, the Ego may seek to extract the energy back from the person by attempting a sim-ilar rude gesticulation to 'even the score' or enter into a war with it for there-turn of our energy. This might be done either by having them apologise and affirm our sense of identity as a good, nice, likeable fellow, or by depleting their energy stores in much the same way they have depleted ours. Exchanging negative com-ments, putting others down, etc. is probably one of the quickest ways to usurp energy from others to feed our own insecurities-whereby 'we' level out the imbalance and justify our actions to ourselves to feel better. If however, we are unable to regain energy directly from someone who has taken it, it may be extracted forcefully from others unrelated to the original incident, continuing the vicious cycle. The nature of the esoteric world reveals this: most of humanity is locked in struggle with psychic vampires. The patterns that repeat in families, friend-ships, groups, relationships, marriages, society, etc. owe much to the stipula-tions of the psychic vampire - most of which will end in nastiness, enmity, disaster and a high amount of destruction in the secret fight to maintain a hold of, and increase one energy imbalance without first fixing the connexions caus-ing the thirst. Yet it is always our own Ego that depletes our energy stores. Firstly by tak-ing the risk of gambling for gain in the first place, and secondly, in being over-sensitive and having its fragility revealed the Ego chooses to be offended. The 'projection of revenge' by the Ego leads an organism to mistakenly take the 29"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA energetic bungle to heart, and to believe its own wishes are synonymous with that of the quite separate, irate Ego. This manifests inwardly as an alignment of our 'sense of identity' with the indignant hurt of the ego and the outward belief that the other party has caused it, i.e. insecurity. ON INSECURITY Insecurity is an incomplete connexion that acts like a leak. Although energy may be poured into it, if there is an open or insecure connexion, energy ex-pended into that connexion will be wasted and lost in much the same way a hole in a bucket will eventually cause the bucket to drip dry. This is the process that causes the insatiable THIRST of the psychic vampire. Only under radical conditions of change in the Ego, personal identity or alchemy, can a psychic vampire ever actually fulfil or fix an insecure connexion. For the most part, an Ego that sustains the conditions or state of mind conducive to the obsession with that connexion, cannot be healed, and if it should become a psychic vam-pire, should be avoided at all costs or destroyed. However, psychic vampirism is seldom one-sided. It cannot be absolutely determined in the favour of one party or the other who is the original initiator for a psychic energy exchange. psychic vampires tend to be charismatic and the victim (prey) may deliberately entice a relationship with a psychic vampire in order to partake of its energy re-serves (the prey perhaps also being insecure) and capitalize on the vampire's gift at fulfilling what is felt to be lacking in the prey. The classic scenario of a beau-tiful but insecure person making a strong bond with someone uglier but con-fident is played out all the time. Whereby both parties 'agree' to the psychic relationship and the benefits that relationship confers. For this reason, an en-tanglement with a psychic vampire may be extremely difficult to break by an outside party, as the vampire and prey often act in symbiosis. That said, let us move onto the hunt. lNrrrAL CONTACT A psychic vampire has powerful intuition, psychic perception and is able to detect very slight changes in emotion, tension, vocal inflection, or danger to 30"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ON PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM its cover being blown -that are otherwise invisible to the average person. It is a terrific mimic, and highly empathic but it cannot feel sympathy-it cannot feel what another person feels. Also, it cannot put aside its own interests for very long and because it is driven by a compulsive obsession to drain others it cannot hide its interests very long. The psychic vampire is a cunning gambler with energy, especially if they have been performing Psychic Drain for a considerable amount of time. They will tend to resort to using the lowest necessary energy expenditure for the highest rate of return and take advantage of the easy gains to be made from appealing to the reptilian urges and desires of Ego-based prey. I.e. appealing to vanity, base sentiments and emotions, siding with the prey's political or re-ligious beliefs or forming a strong bond of 'same-ness' through the laziness of standardized conversations of everyday life. It will generally begin hunting by employing a single tactic (or modus operand1) or \"lure\" to assess potential victims (or 'symbiote' if the prey is will-ing). These tactics tend to belong to the aloof -i.e. indirect means of getting attention such as secretive or sly mysticalfcryptic talk (riddles and unique ter-minology), acting distant and vague to draw one's attention, creating elaborate works of art or speech and pretending they are nothing, making itself the cen-tre of attention but to manipulate circumstances in such a way that it seems the vampire has been elected to be the centre by others rather than itself; being in places where they will be directly seen acting strangely-all while pretend-ing to be completely detached and uninterested in being noticed - these are the wiles of a psychic vampire. Psychic vampires are crafty and patient. Usually, by the time a person has realized they have been attacked by such a creature, the psychic tendril is deep within them. Strange bouts of impolite or uncomfortable curiosity into one's affairs, jealousy, anger, depression, flattery, praise, insults, etc. from an other-wise consistent person may be signs of a vampire losing patience from the ef-fort to hold their deceptive guise. A very adept psychic vampire will require a greater length of time to detect. 31"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA Also be wary of the guise of perfection and of the need of a person to make things perfect, and strangely static as though they were trying to freeze your happiness in time, for you. But ever be just, not all idealists are psychic vam-pires. That said, there are creatures enslaved to their insecurity in every house, in every street, in every city, in every country. There are more psychic vam-pires, owing to the cultural dominance and worship of the Ego, than there are stable Egos that are not corrupted by their own inflated sense of importance. PSYCIDC ENTANGLEMENT AND FEEDING Psychic vampires are cowards that like to isolate their prey. They are highly territorial of prey and in a group, may jealously seek to keep the prey isolated from others to prevent their prey from being fed on or feeding any other per-son. The psychic vampire is keen at detecting very subtle energetic exchanges and possesses terrific empathy. To this extent they have been known to 'work the room' subtly allocating secretive jargon and specialist topics of discussion to each person that only the psychic vampire and the person being talked to can understand in order to keep everyone separated from each other. In this way, the psychic vampire can control the comfort level of the room and can be seen by others as a 'crusader' who somehow breaks the tension and rescues them from their alienation, indebting them to the psychic vampire. The psychic vampire will often (but not always) latch onto the weakest, most susceptible or insecure person with whom they have the greatest proximity and determine what is lacking in their prey that can be supplied to endear the prey to it. If the prey lacks confidence for instance, they may feed them con-fidence by a rich and generous energetic exchange of praise and flattery. The prey will likely be lead to associate itself as a 'team' of sorts with the vampire whereby the vampire will become a 'best friend' by its knack for giving the prey confidence and security. This 'generosity' by the psychic vampire will last only so long however; it is a tactical ploy and the psychic vampire will be most anxious to recoup its energy immediately after it is confident that its prey is psychically entangled. 32"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ON PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM ENARCOSIS {ENERGY ADDICITON} The intention is to cause addiction in the prey to the psychic vampire and to the energy it supplies, thus deterring the prey from wandering very far or for very long from the psychic vampire's side. Owing to the rich increase of energy to the prey's Ego from the initial con-tact, an addiction is formed to the psychic vampire's energetic boosts in much the same way one develops a taste for narcotics. A high is caused by the im-balance of excessive incoming energy. A psychological dependence on the ex-cessive amounts of energy will cause a corresponding crash when they are depleted or no longer maintained. This can lead to a new and unrealistic sense of identity in the prey's psyche similar in many ways to the original narcissism of the psychic vampire. This in itself shows the absolute power a psychic vampire can hold over a person by its knowledge or intuition of these processes and by working as a type of drug-pusher to the limbic system. Using this dangerous ability, the psychic vampire rapidly disintegrates its prey's own identity and plays havoc with its normal energetic stock exchange. Over time, the prey itself becomes a reciprocal psychic vampire too. Once the prey is hooked, the psychic vampire rapidly increases its drain and sets about to exact a terrible revenge. It drops many of its deceptive guises and begins to drain the prey with relative impunity. A psychic vampire's gradual change in behaviour is hard enough as it is for a victim to notice, but with an energy ad-diction in tow it will ignore or justify the psychic vampire's behaviour so long as it can continue getting its hit. INFILTRATION At the point where the relationship has been sustained for a period of a few days, the vampire will test the waters by making self-deprecating remarks in-tended to draw sympathy (energy) from the prey. The Ego of the prey will be 33"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA more than willing to give back some of the rich stores of surplus energy it has received from the vampire during the generous phase because it naturally loves to gamble. It will attempt to reassure the psychic vampire, in the hope that it can continue receiving the energy given by the psychic vampire, who will at first make it easy for its prey to placate it. But over a short amount of time, the vampire will let down its carefully con-cealed narcissism and gradually depress its prey by being increasingly implaca-ble and unreasonable thus requiring more and more effort by the prey to keep an energetic balance. The vampire will cease to cloak its priorities and refer more and more to itself, talking about itself, getting attention on itself, luring energy from others by causing them to take notice or comment on some de-ceptively innocent remark made by the vampire whereupon the vampire will begin draining all it come into contact with in the preys circle by causing the conversation to come back to itself. Its implacability steadily grows until the prey must literally grovel and plead with the psychic vampire to take back its self-deprecating comments, which over time are moved from the belief that they are caused by an external source such as an enemy, parent, etc., and are stemming directly from the actions or inactions of the prey, whose efforts to restore balance by giving energy back to the vampire are now treated as insincere and callous. The prey is called a liar, and so on, in order to extract more and more energy from the hapless host. We have established that this process occurs because of the insatiable thirst of the psychic vampire caused by an insecure connexion, and the need for greater and greater energy hits-much the same way movies must now be full of horrific violence or gratuitous sex to excite the over-stimulated, worn out senses that require ever more exciting and strong imagery and sound to achieve the same levels of satisfaction. A psychic vampire is a ravenous addict who quickly exhausts the energy extracted and requires longer and better highs. They do not of course come because of the severed connexion in the mental networking that simply cannot be fixed and loses all the energy poured into it -to this end the vampire is extremely dangerous; a psychopath that will drain every drop of its prey, but keep going back for more, and expect it to be there. 34"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ON PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM The psychopathology that links the vampire to its prey is extremely difficult to destroy - for even a drained husk will be used to some extent in the vam-pire's repertoire. The vampire is not stupid-it will realize that the drain can only go on for so long, and when the energy drain begins to weaken it will ex-tend its tendrils into those around its prey, including friends, family and ac-quaintances. It may even do this on getting to know the prey, setting about charming the circle of the prey in preparation. It may use the prey to get close to another prey or cause dissension via rumours among the prey's circle. It may make the prey an enemy and sow discord that turns others against it, for it will do ANYthing to get its energetic fix. At this point, the vampire will uti-lize any number of tactics to achieve a sufficient level of drain. Verbal or phys-ical violence, threats of violence, crying, psychological, mental, physical abuse, harsh and vindictive treatment, torture, pleading, making promises, appealing to one's sense of decency, generosity, humanity, religion, politics, blackmail, any number of modes of deception, silent treatment, ignoring the prey, caus-ing trouble for the prey, killing the prey. EXTRACTION (KILLING A PSYCHIC VAMPIRE) The psychic vampire is a relentless psychopath. Because of the enormous dam-age it can do, one must be extremely wary of such creatures, especially so in the extraction of their psychic tendril. To excite them carelessly by giving them any kind of attention, by making a scenefdrama around them, by yelling, arguing, or even reasoning with them, only demonstrates your untapped en-ergetic reserves1 on which they can feed, and is like pouring blood into a swim-1lt is vital to understand that all ego-based intentions are tainted by culturalfsocial illusion. The acts that have come to symbolize 'finality' in society; giving the cold shoulder, narrowing the eyes, giving the finger, walking off in mid-conversation, slamming down the phone, slamming the door, yelling, crying, pleading, reasoning, promising, threatening are all energetic based ex-changes stemming from the same basis as any other action. The idea that there is less energy ex-penditure in some social cues than others, a difference in negative or positive exchanges, is ignorance. Ignoring someone whilst secretly egging them on, I.e. not talking to them but talking about them, is often practised by so-called 'victims' who have themselves become psychic vampires. 35"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA ming pool containing a hungry shark.

Time therefore, will help reveal a clumsy psychic vam-pire, but of those more subtle it is only a weak help. To destroy the psychic hold a vampire has on one is hard. Any display of aggression, sadness, annoyance, verbal animosity, etc., demonstrates only are-serve of energy that the vampire has not tapped. The vampire will amaze at the depths of its cunning in appraising the situation correctly and winning back the trust of its prey by well worded wiles, sweet promises and laments in the beginning, and leave one breathless with the extent of its destructive capabilities if the prey tries to escape later on when the prey is in much deeper wedlock with its tendrils. One has ONE chance to destroy the hold of a psychic vampire. Success de-pends on abiding exactly to and without weakening the resolve at any point; a silent and cold detachment from the psychic vampire. One must anticipate the many tactics the vampire will devise to continue its drain and be prepared to meet them without emotion, without energetic displays, and the same resigned, determined, cold, emotionless detachment to ignore the psychic vampire. One must not engage the vampire in conversation, or rise to emotion under the temptation to reply to the vampire's calculated insults and deprecations. One must not accept any gifts from the vampire, any money from the vampire, any favours from the vampire, nothing, no energy transaction either in matter or in spirit must be performed. One must be prepared for the vampire to attack the ones around it and to set them against the prey, to circulate vicious rumours and sweet promises and apologies in the same day. 36"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ON PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM No communication of any kind with the vampire should ensue. No letters should be read, no replies given to email, letter or phone messages. Any gifts by the vampire should be left exactly where they were delivered.

Flowers, fruits, bears, cars, should be left to wilt, to rot, to age, to rust, as is, without remorse. To give in ONCE, just once, is to show the vampire that if it persists long enough, it will succeed. Again, to give in at any time, to bother to talk to the vampire, to extend an invitation, to let it take you to dinner to apologise for what it has done, to have anything more to do with the vampire is to court disaster. Only ONE time, one moment of weakness is necessary to show the vampire your inability to break its psychic tendril and leave yourself open to further psychic rape. Because the vampire is patient, it will continually ma-noeuvre you into a position where it can drain you. If you take it back and then try to break with it again, you will have cursed yourself forever by your weak resolve. The vampire will not believe your adamant reassertions that you do not want it back, and it will pester you, again and again, sure of itself that if it only does it long enough, you will give in, as you gave in before. If this instruction is followed the vampire will eventually detach from the magician and re-attach itself to a different victim. Even so, the instruction must be per-manently executed with continued silence maintained indefmitely. The vam-pire has an excellent memory of its energetic exchanges and an acute catalogue of its losses. Being vengeful and extraordinarily patient, a vampire will take any opportunity it can to re-attach, even after periods as long as years of sep-aration.

Motivated by this drive he completed insecure connexions and later found the Self. The Self is nuclear, it burns off its own energy, thus there is no need to drain others. But how many psychic vampires have the luxury of knowing Thyself through such hard work and overcoming the role allotted to themselves?

Embarassment, illegality, taboo, shame, fear, reputation, and so on are all very powerful censors -and there is a good reason they exist. The shock to the system of the RC Rite can be extraordinary and highly and permanently disturbing. It can and generally does open gates you cannot close without serious complications-and meeting the content that writhes in the Pit is often forgotten or dismissed because the ego so carefully blocks out the horrific throng that assails consciousness, most of the time. A certain desensi-tization has occurred that rites like the Black Mass help to highlight in regards to the power of our minds to really truly fuck us and make us cower in the corner strangled by our shadows -nightmares still have this power but they are often undesired and arrive of their own volition. The RC Rite allows a con-scious effort into this murky Abyss with no protection except that which the individual may have developed through their long-worked for measure against psychic calamity or spiritual destruction. 1) Obtain for yourself a blank book with no less than 30 pages. 2) On the floor, outside or inside, draw fset up a broken pentagram. Also known as the Acausal pentagram, it does not have a finished protective circle and the lines of the pentagram are interrupted at points (see illustration below). The pentagram is envisioned as having a black energy erupting from the center with its tendrils obscuring the lines of the pentagram and breaking the protective circle. 3) Light and place a white candle at each point of the Acausal pentagram. Burn your choice of incense. 4) Sit outside the Acausal pentagram and meditate for a maximum of 3 min-utes until you are relaxed. Say \"I call on the forces of darkness and the powers of THEM. Fill ME, Guide ME, Show ME\". 43"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MALEFICIA 5) Enter the Acausal pentagram with your book and a pen. 6) Sit in the center. Say \"I open the Gates and I Remember\". 7) Blow out one of the candles and say \"I need no protection, and I abandon myself to you. Fill ME, Guide ME, Show ME\". ou will shortly begin to write, without restraint, without order, without question: the darkest, cruelest, sickest, evilest things you can think of, with the express intention of fueling them upon themselves to see how sick you are capable of. You must write until you either disturb yourself and see the sudden sense in your psychic censors and protection from the Devil come rush-ing in and abandon the rite altogether. To abandon the rite, remove and destroy all ritual items used. Be sure to first complete the pentagram before you rub it out/remove it. Or, plumb the depths of your horrific imagination and cruelty to expose a side of your self your better judgment keeps hidden. The aim here is to delib-erately try and disturb yourself to such an extent you break the locks on your defenses and let the Devil in-and suggested means are acts that involve ter-rible travesties using emotional attachments to loved ones. Once you break those locks-you cannot fix them. Severe psychological disturbance and sui-cidal verges have been reported before by initiates undertaking this rite and complete resignation from the Sinister is not uncommon after performing this rite. If you are ready: 8) Take a few deep breaths. Open your book and begin writing. We Remember The Temple, The TEMPLE OF THEM!

You're warned). 44"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE RITE OF REGURGITATING CHORONZON 9) When you have had enough, stop. Read the book you have written, once to imprint it. When you are finished-Close the book. Take a few deep breaths. Say \"I have been shown and not looked away. I am ready to be shown more. But not tonight/today\". 10) Now, very importantly: leave the circle and destroy the book. Burn it or take time to tear it into the tiniest pieces you can so as to be unreadable. There are two very good reasons for this; 1) so no-one else can see how fucked up you can be, charge you for breaking any laws, and get frightened by your Beast (which they will) as the book has the potential to destroy your familial and friendly constructs and relationships very quickly -but more particularly so you cannot return to read them. 2) the second one you may discover for your-self, but the hint is in the name of the Rite. 11) Blow out the remaining candles. FINISH the broken pentagram before you rub it out/remove it. Break the candles, and the chalkfmaterial used to make the pentagram and dispose of all ritual items including remainders of the book. 12) Optional: Alcohol loosens inhibitions-a glass of wine or enough to get one tipsy without preventing one from writing legibly can increase the hatred and uncontrolled passion of this rite considerably. There are many other vari-ations to increase the energy -these will not be mentioned here but they in-volve violence andfor sexual activity or any imaginative combination as per Black Mass considerations. Music is also an option -wherein THEM suggest anything by the YUGGOTHIC CHOIR. 45"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY MAG IAN The term is loosely derived from the Magi -or the 3 wise men of the Christian fables that followed the Bethlehem star to observe the birth of Jesus Christ. But THEM not only ask what is its name -but also what does its name do, what purpose does it serve? Magi refers to: (1) A political-magical-emotional term to designate a distinction between two groups or attitudes viz, the Sinister and the Magian that may or may not exist, but through which perception of division is achieved through a tension of opposites. I.e. we are A, they are not A, they are B, we are not B. We are therefore opposed to B. And B are opposed to A. The duality of 'us and them' provides the tension through which momentum (usually political) can be achieved in the effort to move away or move toward A or B (this kind of de-construction de-emotionalizes such terms and is effective at breaking the spell or diffusing the energy contained in such words). This is a practice that can destroy illusions automatically created by arranging such words or concepts in such a way as to cast a spell and a practice that THEM uses to escape the Matrix and its prison of morality and duality. (2) An ancient powerful lodge of magicians or persons who have enslaved the world within a certain magical matrix of perception which includes moral-ity and duality from which we have never escaped. This magic has become en-shrined in the worship of the ego and the loss of respect for the unconscious or 'Satanic' forces of which we are equally (3) A person possessed of a selfish, unthinking servitude to the forms of the world that lacks empathy or individual experience and has assimilated into the machine without question or without realization of the process of indi-viduation and the completion of the mind toward a higher state. 46"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY MlNDWAR The belief in an 'occult' war between multiple forces, external and internal to the human being, engaged in by human forces to either remember our total being, capacity and potential and accept the notion that we are limited in what we can understand and know about ourselves or the operations of the universe (and so is everyone else) by facing our fears and discovering the language and origin of forms that affect humanity on fundamental levels; or force humanity to forget its origins and other psychic elements in favour of enshrining the ego and continuing the tradition of covering what is, with an endless array of forms, as an archaic remembrance to keep out the original chaos and the fear it generated. A battle of wills to have forms placed in their appropriate context to free us from their illusive slavery i.e. archetypes; or to allow forms composed of duality and morality to dominate perception, and thus to control choice and reality through the manipulation of forms by playing on inherent weak-nesses of the human organism to certain ones. This War should not be consid-ered as simple as us and them for the simple reason, both us and them reside inside and outside of us, that is, our enemies are as much a part of us as we of them. And the concept of division itself is a form used to manipulate and con-trol. Only recognition and control of the Shadow can help free us from un-consciously being manipulated by its tyranny. Only the desire to create a bridge between the conscious and unconscious can unlock the genuine magic of the hidden psyche and the human collective experience. MVIMAEDIVM \"Mvimaedivm\" is not from any existing language, but was influenced by read-ing grimoires full of occult magic and latin. It means \"Know Now My Way\" -and is used synonymously within the author's philosophy, websites, word-press and autobiography. ONA The Order of Nine Angles.

SATANIST THEM break down every defmition ad infinitum and therefore settle for the accepted and general consensus of the term Satanist, as well as allowing for any number of others to co-exist as individual perceptions each as valid as the next, since they are all just as easily and equally invalid. Satanist - someone who strives to be like Satan. SINISTHRION A collective description for the group of individuals associated with or in some way connected to the Sinister. STAR GAME The Star Game is a representation of the nine aspects of the basic three whose changing in causal time represents a particular presencing of acausal energy. That is, the nine represents not only the nexion that is the presencing of the acausal evident in our psyche and consciousness, but also many other nexions as well. This particular representation is an \"abstract\" one, as distinct from the more \"causal\" symbology of The Tree of Wyrd (and of the septenary sys-tem itself). The Star Game exists in two basic forms: the \"simple form\" and the \"advanced\" form, and one of its aims is to develope acausal-thinking (beyond causal abstractions) and thus skill in five-dimensional magick. It can also be played as a \"game\", akin to chess, and can be used magickally, to presence acausal energies. The basics of The Star Game are described in the ONA mes-sage \"NAOS\". 48"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY THEM (1) The Ancient Ones in the literal sense of perceived and unperceived forces, both named and still unknown, that create and define reality and psy-cho-physical limitations for our species; (2) The Ancient Ones in the figurative sense of the phantasms; we use to describe them without full consciousness of what they are or our full relation to them, i.e. Satan, Demons, Devils, Entities, Spirits, Gods; (3) The collective association of the psyche as bi-partmental (conscious and unconscious), and the importance of acknowledging the jungian aspects of the psyche as the way forward through learning, or struggling towards driving the organism with other functions other than the sole dominance of the ego; (4) The Ancient Ones in relation to the Psyche that treats demons as existing sentient entities or intelligences but doubtful as to whether they exist solely in the realm of imagination or exist as products of the psyche-or exist outside of human consciousness and perception. THE MATRIX The World and everything in it but not as it is known by name. The Matrix implies a wire-frame view of the world built on an inherent mistrust of the self to accurately determine or define what 'is' any further than appreciable convenience -and the affirmation that whatever it is exists despite us and what we call it, of its own accord. It has however, been covered with illusions borne of form and names and has become cloaked in a meta-reality that forms the backbone of human perception and on-going tradition, brain-washed into every new life. The Matrix is as much of us, from our thoughts and connec-tions, assumptions, learned behaviour and habits, as it is external to us but forms a complex relationship where the inside and outside meet.

The Tree of Wyrd itself is one symbol, one representation, of that meeting (or \"inter-section\") of the causal and acausal which is a human being, and can be used to represent the journey, the quest, of the individual toward the a causal-that is, toward the goal of magick, which is the creation of a new, more evolved, individual. WYRD Wyrd is a concept in Anglo-Saxon culture roughly corresponding to fate or personal destiny; or that which comes to pass. It's the awareness of which des-tiny develops through a connection, and empathy with the forces of the world from which one's own sense of self is derived in context with those forces, and a conscious understanding that impels one toward a certain realization of one's purpose(s), and the fulfilment or denial of thatfthose purpose(s). 50"}]
