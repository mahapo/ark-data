Fundamental to magic is a belief that the phenomenal world of the five senses is incomplete. Magickians believe that we live in a world quite different from the one our five senses show to us -they believe that every living thing pos-sesses, because it is living, certain energies which we as individuals can sense and 'see' if we become receptive to them; just as we can become receptive to the effects of symbols and language on ourselves and others to the extent that we can discern the methodology beneath such forms and sometimes, deduce the motivation. This receptiveness is one of the aims of magickal or Occult Initiation-and may be said to involve the individual in becoming aware of the essence of things that is hidden by their outward appearance and this applies to other individuals, as well as 'things'. An example of this is the existence of a hidden underlying narrative being subtly ;overtly created around us through various forms andfor suggested by means of a singlefmultiple literary/visual form(s) such as are used in propaganda, Media or networked messages where multiple reinforcements of a similar message each play a part in a total collaboration to induce individuals to act a certain way. Another example is in the arrangement of a complex set of literary/visual forms that utilize influential devices such as logic, sentiment, precedence, emotion, morality, etc. to invoke emotion 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ENGRAM through nationalism, patriotism or racism, for instance, within the readerjviewerjparticipant. Recognition of such forms and the forces acting through them on each of us and others, as well as direct practice and assump-tion of various forms to explore them first-hand enables one to actively see beneath (and thus potentially influence) such presentations rather than merely passively witnessing their parade or being haplessly affected by them. According to the Septenary Tradition, these \"magickal energies\" possessed by things and 'life' derive from what it is convenient to describe as the acausal -that is, every living entity is a point or region where acausal energies manifest in our causal, phenomenal, universe, the amount and type of this energy being dependent on the type of entity. These acausal energies (which science, be-cause of dealing only with causal entities and energies, cannot describe) may be said to derive from a parallel acausal universe which intersects our causal universe at certain places-these places are deemed 'Nexions' and can be any-thing from a location to a movement, a form, a group or a single individual, for instance. We as individuals, because we possess the faculty of consciousness, are 'gates' to this acausal universe. We possess the (mostly latent) ability to 'open the gate' to the a causal which exists within our own psyche to draw from the acausal certain energies, and these energies can and do alter in some way both our own consciousness or other entitiesjenergies which exist in the causal. This 'drawing of energies', and their use, is magick. External magick is the use of such energies, directed by individual desire, to bring about changes in the causal; whilst internal magick is the use of these energies to bring psychic, internal change. To draw upon such energies it is usually necessary for the in-dividual to use some form of framework or symbolism, and techniques of ex-ternal magick use such symbolism to bring about both apprehension of the energies and their control. Various systems of symbolism exist-most denot-ing types of energy by gods, goddesses, spirits or demons. In reality, the actual symbols are only of secondary importance, and a magickian who is following the path to adeptship will soon discard such symbolsjnamesjdescriptions (and thus external magic itself) in favour of apprehending such energies as they are in themselves. 8"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MAGIC In the Septenary Tradition however, drawing upon these energies is first done via the 'Tree of Wyrd' (through exploration of the seven spheres and the pathways connecting them) and then through the 'Star Game'. The Tree of Wyrd may be seen as a map of consciousness: both individual (of the psy-che) and of those regions other than the individual where the acausal and the causal meet. The symbolism of the spheres and the pathways are the first or Initiated stage of apprehension; beyond lies the abstract apprehension of the Star Game, a complex magical chess-type game designed by Anton Long of ONA that teaches a range of adepthood skills, chief among them, abstraction. Akin to many other Nexions inspired into being by the Order of Nine An-gles, the Temple of THEM utilizes the ON A's Tree of Wyrd (see fig. I) to create a magical map of magicaljalchemical stagesjpathwaysjspheres as an authentic western-sinister derived device for its sorceries. Although a study of the Tree of Wyrd (TOW) would take us too far from our present topic - briefly: it is believed that a system of life based on seven represented the authentic devel-opment of the human psyche and its relationship with the world -a system later disrupted by the distortion of the Septenary Tradition by other races, cultures, ideas, and the deliberate interference of the Magi to take control of the Aeons. It is enough to say, the Tree of Wyrd as revealed by the ONA, has a rich and flexible symbolism capable of representing practical facets of Mag-ick, all neatly captured in the Septenary Nonagonal helix of the Tree. External magic is divided into two forms or types: hermetic and ceremonial. Hermetic magick is basically that involving only one or two individuals, whereas ceremonial magick involves more and may be said to be 'formal' mag-ick comprising specific rituals or rites (usually written down and followed ex-actly) and an organized Templejcoven or group. In essence, symbols, names, descriptions, tradition, etc. are only tools to be used to make otherwise invis-ible magic, visible, in order to fill those vessels intended to execute the magi-cians will with the necessary alchemy-itself a magical act. A fourth type of Magic specialized in by THEM is that of Narrative or Mythic Magic-wherein, taking elements from both hermetic and ceremonial magick, a small number of initiates involve others without their knowledge 9"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ENGRAM ~ ....... ~ -· ? -J> .... <!'-~ ...... -------------------------------FIG 1: THE TREE OF WYRD in the participation of their magi-cal evocation using strategic ma-nipulations and Mythos. As the power of stories has proven to hold enormous fascination throughout human history and still does, involving others in an extended magical 'story' that of-fers an alternative to the reigning stories of the Magi is an extraor-dinarily powerful method of caus-ing Change. Such magic attempts to tap into the current collective human psy-che and introduce the fifth dimen-sion of acausality by exploiting the already existing habits and training of those in thrall to the Matrix of Forms built and main-tained by the elements known as the Magian -in such a way as to hurry along or trick the reigning perception of participants into supporting the evocation -in ef-fect a detached and infinite ranged type of magic reminiscent of the Wiccan 'Cone of Power'. With a sustained chant or canto of forms and vibrations keyed to directly effect and alter fundamental tenets of prevailing perception -the collective evocation influences those involved to involve others-thus getting others in-volved as characters in a living, moving, story moving each aspect of the stage, actors and plot like chess pieces accordingly -through the strategic employ-ment of form. Such magic externally takes the form of a hybrid between fas-10"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MAGIC cination and Sympathetic magic wherein the most overt form and the form rith which we have had the most experience and success is that of creating a lythos. Unless highly imaginative or a creator themselves-thereby enabling the option of self-expanding one's choices-people will bounce between those c:hoicesjforms offered. It seems unnecessary to state the obvious, but that is thy prior to the arrival of ONA parties interested in Satanism gravitated to-ward the Temple of Set or the Church of Satan. No-one practiced the ONA-because the ONA didn't exist for them. And now, long after ONA has become a potential choice, as a Nexion of the ONA the Temple of THEM has arrived to dissect and dissolve the spellbinding power of language, form and illusion. The artists, the creative, the genius are the few that are able to raise the bar of choice -the rest must be content to follow in Their footsteps. To date-the Temple of THEM has achieved considerable notoriety despite the deliberate absence of convenient handholds such as a recognizable cult symbol (as of mid 2011, we have since revealed one as we move to implement the second stage of our assault) a recourse to popular occult symbols and methodology, morality, reliance on accepting general notions or an openly ex-pressed mission in the typical vein of darkness for its initiates to gravitate to-ward. Yet it has risen to occupy a seat on a national stage despite the absence of a laid out system of ritual, magical-based symbology or table of correspon-dences for others to work their way through-relying on its powerful Narra-tive Magic alone. Instead of working with the appearances and forms that are manifest by various energies, i.e. investing meaning into particular symbols and forms-we rely directly on communing with the currents of Synchronicity, Empathy, Integrity, Solidarity-abstract words that denote these energies-but more ac-curately represent the core and essence which all the former and gross tools and representations of magic are built from or which all the former represen-tations of magic (ritual, symbology, associations et al.) are built for. Such energies are notably more separate in apprehension as they are than when they are artificially yoked into consciousness via a dazzling array of ar-guably unnecessary forms and often cause extreme disruption when employed, 11"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ENGRAM as has been illustrated many times by the Temple of THEM's members. It is not practical nor possible to discard all forms in the early stages of an initiate's development as stripping away such notions requires long-term dedicated ef-fort and the creation of a special substitute Matrix to prevent one going mad or causing extreme damage to one's psychic entities and make-up. Whilst forms enslave and entrap us - nevertheless, mired in the labyrinth of forms set up to ensnare and subdue us over the Aeons-is where we all begin the Great Work. As an early way of working with and exploring various energies attributed by abstraction to the planets used to loosely equate the raw memes-the afore-mentioned Tree of Wyrd is a masterpiece. It also has the ability, like the pen-tagram, through no intention of its own, to take someone on a specific guided journey merely via its suggestive shape and the context in which it is pre-sented. But why, and how? Such an enquiry requires asking some crucial ques-tions: why is it that human beings necessitate abstracts? Why is it that initiates begin their path by investing time, effort and faith in such concepts as the Star Game, culling (sacrificial taking of life), aeonics (the view that magical events unfold over vast amounts of time and can be controlled by adepts) or for that matter, believe in concepts in general? Why is it that ONA initiat~s the world over follow and accept the guidelines given through the teachings of the ONA, or that setians strive to abide by the complex religious instructions of the set-ian priesthood given in the Onyx Tablet, or that laveyans dutifully copy and repeat the litanies, rituals and satanic points laid down in the Satanic Bible? Moreover -how is it that words, language, symbols, reading, and visuals have become the dominant foundation, the gateway through which informa-tion is processed, interpreted, perceived, for any course of magic and even any coursefway of living to such an extent that forms have the power to incite the basest or most sublime of human reparations and representations? A sym-bol can take on such power that its mere presence can enrage/inspire a people so greatly that the world is set to burn (the Swastika}-or can likewise be in-vested with such numinous power as to enrapture them to such a state they achieve rare heights of collective brilliance co-operation and genius (the Moon landing f Mars Mission which gave us the psyche-bending image of Earth from space). Likewise, laws and regulations, even the most absurd and unjust of them can be self-enforced via a steady stream of words alone through per-12"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MAGIC ceived authority. Yet many of us live unequivocally with no knowledge of who we are, where we come from, or where we are going either individually or as a collective -trusting in the presence of familiar forms and stories to make sense of life's enigmas and to guide us. How is it that abstractions have taken on such validity, solidity, integrity to affect us the way they do? For this is precisely what they are and what they do. Such inquiries lead us into the fundamental apprehensions and special in-terests of the Temple of THEM-wherein a number of hammers are necessary to break through to the other side. Our myriad efforts represent those ham-mers. As each Nexion of the ONA, THEM included, specializes in taking its own approach that assists in some way in the destruction of the Magian we too have our approach which is many approaches. Our various tendrils include: (1) The Black Glyph Society which hosts, archives and preserves those Dark Paths and Scripts capable of causing massive change through their implementation and highly valued as tools in our Occult War which it distributes world-wide; (2) Mvimaedivm Word press which disseminates our writings freely to alter or at least challenge reigning perceptions and also acts as a connective gateway to other Nexions; (3) The Sinister 101 Syndicate, which forum further attempts to break down and destroy various reigning concepts as well as host variants of non-dualist non-abrahamic systems and enable the True Black Magickian to emerge from themselves; (4) Our six-fold variants of Sorcery practised by each member of THEM covering a diverse range of approaches including Chaos, Neuro-Linguistic, Earth-bound and narrative; (5) Our support and assistance in training new initiates, communing and colluding with other Nexions and the presentiment of a united front against our enemies. Through these (and other) approaches/tendrils we seek to disrupt the com-fortable thinking and automatic programming of the human being, to incite realizations of form and its power over us -to ultimately, REMIND you that 13"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ENGRAM you are a unique being who has been shackled by the forms and architecture of an ancient tradition of making slaves of newcomers to Earth and that it is your every power as a free organism to experience Earth as you see fit. Through these approaches we seek to shatter the geometry of the Matrix in an explosion of brilliant shards, setting minds free from domination by forms and bringing yet another piece of the Magian prison crashing to the ground. By our own reckoning-the intellect is a diamond that projects a laser. Pend-ing on the adjustments made to the setting of the diamond, the arc and range of the laser can be narrowed or widened. A narrow laser is able to cut through the hardest substances whilst a widened laser is capable of projecting complex holograms of multi-dimensional representation. The magnificent prisms that are formed via the various lasers of a collective of intellects can, through care-ful tilting of the individual prisms, be concentrated into a laser of such in-tensity that it cuts through time and space, but especially time. The Temple has viewed each of its individual works (each manuscript) as a tool to make an adjustment to existing prisms in the Matrix -adding tilt to each individual diamond or collective prism in a calculated attempt to engineer the construction of a gateway. Wherein the term gateway is descriptive, it is inaccurate, denoting a doorway of some sort-wherein the gateway we intend is actually the collapse of reality and its forms. The premise is that the lasers in a collective diamond prism can be turned in on themselves causing a collapse of the total hologram. To do this requires that the logical functions and courses of action and reaction of each individual diamond in the collective prism be re-oriented to direct their laser either inward all at once-or toward a singular point. The concentration of the collective lasers at a singular point cancels them out and causes the collapse of the Matrix; this can be equated to a sudden mass realization experienced by large amounts of people who then refuse to sustain a form and give it any power. One example of this is the economic re-alization of the ultimate power of the US Dollar which among other things funds (funded) the annual $650 billion dollar military machine of the US which became the focus of the l)uropean Union to displace by creating a new cur-rency to remove much of that dominant power. 14"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MAGIC The collapse of the total hologram is the equivalent of opening a 'Gateway' to another world usually hidden from view by the ceaseless projection of holo-grams. The ceaseless projection of holograms -of collective belief -of so many minds focused on holding up the same or similar world-view, perception fixes the image of the world in place. A collapse is the equivalent of \"mass psychic disruption\". This collapse can be made to occur on a cultural as well as an individual level-though it will undoubtedly take time, two decades of which THEM has already devoted to achieving and only grows more deter-mined with each passing day. Although this theory might sound convoluted -this is a brief way to ex-plain Our Grand Work and the purpose of dozens of our manuscripts specially tailored to 'disrupt' \"normal\" thought and action processing in an individual or group by playing on weaknesses or appealing to strengths in existing forms. Understanding, recognizing and seeing through the context of forms is key to winning the Occult War, as it is music and the ability to show others how to collapse forms; absolutely key. Both internal and external-the collapse of form is a means to presence the Dark Ones with all that entails; Chaos, and Beyond ... 15"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"RADIASTAR ~c_REATING ONE oF 'FHEM-My work and my writing-my approach and my motive and methodology is given below in this short manuscript which details the Alchemical formula by which I have worked. I reveal here the blueprint of my work so that Others may understand or follow it. The dominance of the 'I' in people must be dislodged enabling the unconscious processes and actions of their ego to become consciously observable to them via the creation of a new stream of consciousness. They must understand how they make suppositions, projections, abstractions, tensions, create time, space, form and how they themselves cause and contribute to the reality of these through the engine of their perception. The successful result of this psy-chemical change is to cause a specific doubt of their autonomy that leads to a brief collapse of the Ego and the emergence of the Self. As if -they (the emergent Self) were suddenly operating from another room in the back of their skull, watching their Ego working away at the controls of their organism as a separate entity or function. Once this split-mind state occurs there is no going back. Evolution has been achieved. There is nothing more for you to do. When their mind ceases to perceive itself as a singularity and the individual becomes THEM-a compartmentalized being acutely conscious of sharing its being with more than one function and aware of the previous possession of their mind by the Ego function -both Ego and Self (mere names for forces) become conscious. Now they may use both, rather than be dominated unconsciously by the one. This is Evolution of the Mind. To kill the Machine-means to dislodge that which keeps it running. Which is precisely -the supreme and singular dominance of the Ego which most identify 16"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"RADIA STAR-CREATING ONE OF THEM as themselves. But this involves special tact and secrecy. To warn the Ego of an attack is a fatal error-because if it senses danger to itself it hardens and becomes immovable. It cannot be directly approached and can only be drawn out and co-erced to lower its guard, slowly much as a psychologist must dance around the issues of his patient so as not to frighten him and also to allow the individual to come to the realization on their own. Thus the Ego must be tricked into defeating itself. It's abstractions must be torn apart piece by piece/ its processes broken down and made visible to that indi-vidual so that a special instant occurs in that individual similar to an Out of Body Experience-With the exception that is it Out Of Mind. In this instant, a sudden flash of the awakened Self can see the actions of the Ego consciously and under-stands its own involvement in its perception. This can be done one by one very slowly-or, via our creation of Magickal Socialism, people can be affected in much larger numbers. Magickal Socialism is a specific incantation this Temple has created to weaken the Ego based on what we know about how to lower its guard. This generates the correct emotional state in many people at once necessary for change. There are others like us-who are of a split-mind and consciously, suspiciously regard their own motives. Our movement has sought and seeks them out. We can do nothing for an individual who has already evolved but we Seek THEM out to give them a collective home. Our directive is to target those who have not evolved or who show signs of being on the cusp of self-awareness and need a degree of push. The simple truth is that the banner of Satanism represents an ancient instability of the mind whose current attracts those who are less resistant to change and who may have more chance of re-connecting with their total mind -and it is for this reason alone that our Mythos is wound about darkness. Creating one of THEM is an extraordinarily difficult process -it is often lengthy and the process(es) required varies from individual to individual, instant to instant. It is made all the harder should the target Ego be put on alert that such"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ENGRAM a process is being attempted. Releasing this manuscript, whilst it could help others to understand what we are doing - risks putting the Ego's of many on high alert when approaching or dealing with members of the Temple. It has thus been kept quiet to make our job easier. But at the same time, I feel it is important that this information survive to be used by Others and the only way it will do that is if it is spread to at least some of the population. Now you understand the simple reason behind the secrecy of our motives and our movement the Temple of THEM. But our motive and movement is changing and it is now much less of a risk to make this information available to a few. I remain convinced that whilst it may take many decades of effort, if enough of THEM can be created who create other THEM using this formula then the power structure of the Magi attained through its purchase of the mind - made possible through the unconscious possession of people that keeps them in thrall to forms - will be utterly destroyed. We may not see this event in our lifetime. But I am committed. And believe that we have discovered the secret and the antidote to the poison of the Magian. May our tendrils spread across space and time and deliver us from evil. 18"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ON SONGS AND SINISTER CHANTS The success of any magical working resides in its authenticity. What has been taken from oral traditions as living breathing pieces of magic has often become transformed into an intellectual standpoint-losing much in the translation. The many works of THEM could themselves be said to over-rely on terminol-ogy such as 'methods', 'stances', 'systems' etc. were there not a more subtle undercurrent to such works, viz. an intent to supplement what is lost when the firm and solid notions of the above are dissolved via extended alchemy. It is largely impossible for a person in this age to hold something in their mind's eye, work with some part of the world or its phenomenology-without naming it, describing it, and trying to define it. When science tried to corner life into one finite space it was confounded when life defied known physics and rep-resented itself as both a particle and a wave. And this ingrained determination to narrow something down infinitesimally and bind it to form, word, and meaning is why magic has begun to fade from the world to be replaced with an armada of preconceptions, misunderstandings, and theoretical jargon. Thus it is that the preferred attitude to Sorcery and Magick by THEM is one of the possible approaches. An approach differs from a method. A method is a calculated itemization of the elements involved in any equation by using/creating a specific lens of per-ception through which to define objects and their interplay within strict boundaries-predetermining the result. For instance, those who have sought after the ONA MSS on the Dark Gods, even while equipped with the necessary information of the approach after just finding out about the Dark Gods, seek then to find all information possible on the Dark Gods thus giving rise to a pre-determined method, and further, seek out the results of others of this method immediately queering their own subjective experience beforehand via a created expectation. An approach is not dogmatic, nor does it seek to define ns terms in words or form restricting the whole experience into dry segmen-tations of analysis-it is rather that a holistic 'sense' of the thing pervades the attitude of an approach -the expressions of a certain attitude to take to-19"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ENGRAM ward such things as Dark Gods upon first hearing the words 'Dark Gods', not a rush to simplify, condense, and enclose them in forms and description. Those who quest with a method in hand are confounded by the ONA's explanation of Satan as a vibratory sound for the acausal being; while those who quest with an approach are not. In music one should hear the space and the spaces in between. In the spaces are the strikes of the instruments, notes, vocals -but in the spaces between are the less familiar sounds, vibrations, and split-seconds of silence. Although as much a part of the music and its integrity as the notes -to which we are accustomed to listen to-we have gradually stopped listening for, or hearing, the spaces in between them that contain the other half of the song. The Sinister Chants of the ONA derive from an oral tradition that comprises two very important elements-the melody of the chant, and the vibration of the chant. ONA placed stress on both getting the melody right ('the sinister chants should be sung as a dirge -CB'), but also went to considerable lengths to express the correct vibration, for the vibration is the more important of the two aspects of chant. The following are some notes from Grotowski that may be useful in learning chant - especially Sinister chant: \"To discover the vibratory qualities of an ancient song of ritual tradition, it is necessary to find the difference between the melody and the vibratory qualities. It is not possible to discover the vibratory qualities of a song if one begins to improvise the melody; that is to say if one sings the same song five times and each time a different one appears, then the melody has not been fixed. The melody should be totally dominated in order that one can develop work on the vibratory qualities. But, even if it is absolutely necessary to be precise in the melody in order to discover the vibratory qualities, the melody is not the same as the vibratory qualities. It's a delicate point-because, to use a metaphor -it's as if modern man doesn't hear the difference between the sound of a piano and the sound of a violin. The two types of resonance are very different; but the modern man looks just for the melodic line, without hearing the differences in resonance. 20"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ON SONGS AND SINISTER CHANTS The song of tradition is like a person, when people begin to work on a sup-posed ritual, on account of a coarseness of ideas and associations, they begin -· look for a state of possession or presumed trance, which reduces itself to chaos and improvisations in which one does anything whatever. Forget all these exoticisms; all that is needed is just to see that the traditional song, with the impulses linked to it, is \"a person\". There are some songs that reveal them-selves to be a woman, or a man, or a child. A song of tradition is a living being, and not necessarily a person, but an animal or a force. When we begin to catch the vibratory qualities, this fmds it rooting in the im-pulses and the actions. And then, all of a sudden, that song begins to sing us.\" 21"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INVOKING THE TEMPEST It is for an individual in this Age, imperative as a Satanist, to continuously hone one's capacity for reason and intellect until it shines as a sword of death. But there comes a time with intellect when one's reason cancels one out with the magic of the rational. Where one's thought has de-constructed reality to the point that all actions seem futile, and one is plagued by the inability to give meaning to one's prison of freedom; thus becoming a tortured and exis-tential question mark of a being unable to decide where Wyrd lies or destiny beckons; afraid to invest one's energies in anything lest it prove a later waste of time; a paralysis that comes inexorably with worship of the God of Logic. Such individuals can be seen in abundance in this time; writhing in the agony of philosophic limbo and spraying nihilistic blood in the form of questions; ever questions, and despairing that someone should answer. Mastery, excel-lence in everything; from weakness to strength, thought to feeling; this is the triumphant ecstatic of living that is the mark of a Satanist and of THEM, too. Lest an individual become a specialist, limited to mastery of a single or handful of crafts; above all aspirations carnal, physical; we seek excellence. Thus, ones who believe themselves master of their very nexion; of the flesh and will that is given them, should be able to exercise excellence in silence. We have spoken, and others have spoken in turn, of the Ego; glibly as an abstraction that each can assume to be understood on one's own terms and often assume within the context of the superman mentality/deceitful occult ego to have exorcised or controlled, if even made its acquaintance. While many deny they have one, it is relatively simple to destroy this delusion held dear and reveal the innate function of a phenomenon that leads one invisibly to self-hypocrisy and limitation of being. It is necessary then to demonstrate the awesome power of the Ego and show to those who believe themselves free of it the arduous magical task of the magician of meeting, understanding, and conquering a precise element of our being, made precise by the exercise that follows (note that it is not a requisite to follow the prescribed actions; merely the principles involved). 22"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"• In a blacked out chamber where no light may enter, or outside before the sunrise; assume a standing position, feet a shoulders width apart and hands rested at the sides. • Close your eyes and picture a black, fathomless Abyss (i.e. The Abyss from the movie Into the Mouth of Madness).

One of the defining features of our magic is its lack of empha-sis on aesthetics and its reliance on cold determination-meaning that this rite can be performed provided the intent is present and focused by anyone at any time whatever they may be wearing, night or day. We use the energies as they are without more than the basic trappings present-and more often than not, completely without. We are deadly confident in our ability to use the connec-tions we have made through our sorcery to speak through Them and do Their Will as Ours. For those performing this ritual we provide a note on the intonation: mem-bers of the Temple of THEM do not exhort the Dark Gods to obey us or seek to draw on their favours by wheedling their assistance. We do not command them or protect ourselves from them -we entice them through a deep esoteric understanding of the currents of sex and death and terror. We are sinister and self-possessed emanations of the Dark Gods themselves and our Will is Their ·'/ill. We are cold and sure of our magic. One should have no doubt as to the oower one has-provided one has a sincere and unbroken connexion with Those who give it. Speak with no fear, no doubt, treat the outcome as the rite as a given, as a fact -that only requires you to go back through the motions and formalise your intent.

ATION S Entering its second year, THEM introduced a system of Self-Initiation require-ments to assist aspirants in the transition from other systems of Satanism into our own with the responsibility and manner of execution of such initiation being wholly placed on the shoulders of the discerning aspirant. Our initiation rites are not difficult (indeed only as difficult as someone is willing to make them) but express the intent of our strain of magic to return to self-reliance, self-honesty and self-effort that seems thoroughly lacking in the modern oc-cultist -wherein the Internet, is partly to blame, for its cultivation and en-abling of the habits of laziness and haste. The problem is endemic. A major part of that problem is the relatively new speed afforded to people by which to process and share information, in a cyber-void removed from the physical, without due deliberation on what one is say-ing or what is being said. The other major consideration being that there is an astounding lack of depth or integrity in the studies undertaken by modern magicians into a form-with characteristic erratic flitting from one form to the next seeking to extract blood as quickly as possible and then move on to the next trend or group that takes one fancy. In short: a supermarket mentality. The laziness of the modern occultist has reached such a peak that the ability to overcome obstacles, even little ones, has become all too much of an effort. The natural diligence and ingenuity of people to solve problems has faded with the continuing saturation of receiving (and expecting) immediate satis-faction. It seems too hard now to do anything remotely resembling discomfort or hardship even when the nature of that discomfort and hardship is placed squarely within the hands of the endurer. Because of this laziness there is now untold groups parroting each other endlessly and aimlessly (many under the umbrella of 'Satanism') bickering and grandstanding, without actually doing anything at all to solve the serious problems faced by the Sinisterion.

Although energy may be poured into it, if there is an open or insecure connexion, energy ex-pended into that connexion will be wasted and lost in much the same way a hole in a bucket will eventually cause the bucket to drip dry. This is the process that causes the insatiable THIRST of the psychic vampire. Only under radical conditions of change in the Ego, personal identity or alchemy, can a psychic vampire ever actually fulfil or fix an insecure connexion. For the most part, an Ego that sustains the conditions or state of mind conducive to the obsession with that connexion, cannot be healed, and if it should become a psychic vam-pire, should be avoided at all costs or destroyed. However, psychic vampirism is seldom one-sided. It cannot be absolutely determined in the favour of one party or the other who is the original initiator for a psychic energy exchange. psychic vampires tend to be charismatic and the victim (prey) may deliberately entice a relationship with a psychic vampire in order to partake of its energy re-serves (the prey perhaps also being insecure) and capitalize on the vampire's gift at fulfilling what is felt to be lacking in the prey. The classic scenario of a beau-tiful but insecure person making a strong bond with someone uglier but con-fident is played out all the time.

It should be apparent that the Rain and Sea share very similar properties. An endurance of the Moon may not immediately seem as tactile a ritual as being saturated to the bone by a heavy downpour or being whipped by the salty spray of the ocean carried on the fury of cold winds-but it should be noted that the External Adept Rite of the Order of Nine An-gles employs principles that are deeply esoteric in the instruction to lay un-moving, and watch the stars wheeling across the sky from sunset to sun-up. The same principles used in the Rain Rite are used in the Moon Rite with a full moon being observed and contemplated over the course of twelve hours. PREPARATION Before nightfall on a windy night pouring with rain, a high and isolated hill is selected whereupon the magician is to stand, arms outstretched to endure the elements. Although relatively free to choose one's garments, clothing is not to be waterproof. A psychic connexion is made whereupon the magician meditates on Sinister figures historical or present and realizes the same rain falling upon them has fallen on all such figures. 40"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"RAIN MAGic*K PRIMER Water, like mass, is a finite element.

Essential to Life and merciless in bringing Death. It is present in the most humble of puddles and the deepest of oceans. Like the Moon, upon She who all who have walked the Earth have gazed upon, rain is a bridge; it has touched, at one time or another, all personages, and thus all personages connected to the Sinister. The same rain that fell on Jack the Ripper as he stalked the lantern lit streets of Whitechapel in 1888, fell upon all of the hard faces of the army of invisible phantoms throughout history, standing watch as their wills played forth the strategies that would culminate in Evil. It has trickled across the flesh of all your idols, saturated the soils of the great-est battlegrounds and filled the blackest abysses on Earth with its volume. It has dripped from the entrance of the most isolated caves, from the pagodas of ancient China and the castles of medieval Ireland. It fell unabated, a presence that provoked meditative contemplation in those standing guard thinking on the cold wet night and accompanied the prayers of those in a Temple with its diffuse roar. It has both frustrated and accomplished the strategies of the great-est generals and for millennia set back or brought forth the catch of the humble fisherman. It has been present at the times of the greatest beauty, and the most sublime sadness -at times a passive, at times an active, force of nature, per-meating the lives of all beings plant, beast and man. It descended on the zig-gurats of Sumeria, the birthplace of Western Civilization, and it will fall beyond Solvet Saeclum In Favilla.

The magician approaches the hill with the intent to passively endure the driving rain, not in the spirit of struggle or dominance but in quiet observation to watch, to share time with the rain without intent to direct or shape it, - to let it awash one's senses, one's flesh, one's being with its presence, to endure what it brings in the way of comfort or discomfort. A casual (more accurately, unassuming) physical position should be taken, one that feels natural to take given the circumstances and the magician, such as leaning against a tree, sitting on the wet ground with one's knees bent, or even lying down staring upward into the sky.

However it is held (i.e. known) to evoke a separate energy and thus a different direction to employ sex in the Rite as given above. Experience has shown that the Rain Rite may last as little as a few minutes or as long as a few days. Regardless of the length of its falling, and as you well know, the Rite will fail if one's resolve is abandoned due to human concerns or physical weakness. For this reason, a fast is advised 12 or 24 hours before committing to the Rite and prior training ( Qv. Trial Full Moon Rites to build appropriate stamina and endurance).
