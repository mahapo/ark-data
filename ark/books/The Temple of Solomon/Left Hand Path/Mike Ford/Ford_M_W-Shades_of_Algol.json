Leviathan arise!ForwardPlease be warned. My writings are not always a safe exploration. Generally, every detailhas been practiced, reworked and designed accordingly before it ever is passed to theCoven of which 1 am blessed to call family. The shades within this grimoire are very real,and I hope you will be prepared before entering. Remember, the Gates of Da'ath or\"Hell\" as they call it is found within your mind first and foremost.I have been a student of the Left Hand Path for quite some time now, and consider this avery potent communication of my studies as they were communicated to me. It must beenrevealed to' people that this is the hidden path of Witchcraft some may not wish to beseen, however I am convinced of two things based on this assumption; #1 it was indeedoriginally meant in this context and #2 that this path is not for everyone. Those who dareto use the knowledge within these pages risk much mentally, and have everything to gainfrom its positive use. Knowledge, when transferred into Wisdom is dangerous; thereforerequiring a fortified amount of responsibility and character.The search for communion with the Luciferian Gnosis is not easy, and holds many spikesand nails for those who may lead off the path even for a moment. Stay strong andfocused. The Order of Phosphorus, being something envisioned by all of us within CovenNachttoter welcome those of all paths, seeking to explore their darker selves. The BlackFlame will be brought to you by discovering the hidden source within, this requiresstrength and cunning, from which you will be tested by every measure. This is a positiveapproach to Black Magick, and yes, there is honestly a positive approach. Our enemiesare bigotry, racism, ignorance and weakness. It is time to rise above these empty aspectsof the false ego, and to emerge as Gods and Goddesses of Luciferian Independence.Welcome to the Gates of Hell, enter freely but be warned!

The sahbat path also holds the mysteries of the dream and astral conclave, knownas the nocturnal gathering called 'The Witches' Sabbath\". The soul and spirit of the witch(commonly known as the fetch or astral body) joins with the familiars, intrusive spirits and thedead in the union of the lunar.dream. The Lady of the Darksome moon, Lilith. the bride ofI.ucifcr, the Sun-The Bringer of Light, opens forth the gateway for this initiation into the BlackSun (Algol).The Sabbat, is the ancient aspect of astral ritual, the arcana of the nocturnal body departure, whenthe spirit is able to leave the flesh vessel known as our body to fly in any form towards theconclave of spirits. This sabbat, known in medieval times and most feared among the uninitiated,is (he gathering of daimons, animal familiars, shades and those who drink from the chalice ofBaphomet. The dream sabbat is the core source of initiatory power, of when our spirits are freefrom the shell of the flesh.The Luciferian path is revealed within the Sabbatic Witchcraft tradition as the gateway betweenthe living and the manes of the dead. The sigils of Lucifer in part and as a whole represent anarcane symbolism of self-mastery and transformation, where through the development of thepsyche and what is considered the self, we are able to become as Lucifer. It should be noted thatthe Lucifcrian Gnosis is of self-transformation and eventual astral independence, the separation ofspirit from flesh. In the knowledge of this, one can understand the arcana of Vampiric lorewhispered in the dreaming cycles of the covens of the sabbat.I he Sabbatic Gnosis is fed by the dream lore of the watchers and the fallen angels, who came toearth to instill the wisdom of magical an. the self-transformative act of advancing the self withknowledge and power. This fountain of light, known as the grail is from the Light Bringer knownas Lucifer, the lord of hidden wisdom. The Gods and Goddesses of the Sabbatic Witchcraft circleis among the most demonized fallen angels, such as Asmodeus, Leviathan and Belial. It should beunderstood that the individuals who enter this path must overcome dualities and balance theirlives accordingly. This is the only way knowledge will become a great power of self-deificationand transformation.4The world of sorcery and witchcraft are indeed complicated in the modem age. The image ofWitchcraft, as Anton LaVey defined it in the late 1960's and early 1970's clearly presented astrong definition of what a \"witch\" was 1. in the definition of Satanism. The Witch was, a womanwho used her natural abilities (or unnatural, depending on the individual) to seduce and manifesther Will within an earthly way. Much of the Black Magick was indeed what we would call\"Lesser Black Magick\" and was based on the manipulation of your surroundings. It should bekept in mind that the Satanic philosophy as defined by Anton LaVey is a focus on the here andnow. the mastery of the flesh through Lesser Black Magick. This means systematically, that theSalanist lor the most part is very skeptical and results driven, allowing Magick to come into playonce the conscious mind is focused on obtaining whatever goal may be present."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"**&I •Pilll Huson, in his beautifully presented \"Mastering Witchcraft\", presents the cunning eraII inthe way similar to Gerald Gardner, except Huson was more balanced along the workings of boththe shadow and light. Expanding upon the legends of old concerning Witchcraft. Huson builds a(Mythological approach to the craft by developing inspiration. It is through these means that suchveins may transmit through the nightside the methods and world of Magick and Sorcery.Inspiration is indeed the key towards Magickal success. It should be considered also that Husonwrote of Witchcraft, which is indeed different from Mr. Gardner's Wicca religion.Numerous writers yet since then have taken more a less diabolic side, often shunning those whomay practice their craft upon the Left Hand Path. Considering many Wiccans or New Age typesclaim to be open minded and even \"kind\", many still fashion the same prejudices the Christianshave towards those who hold opposite views to their own.'The tradition of Wicca was founded by a conglomeration of many older magical cults (Egyptian.Qabala, ect) was initially defined as an earth religion. It was indeed Gerald Gardner who broughtmany of these traditions together to manifest to his own desire. Consider that Wicca is actuallySaxon and means \"enlightened?. In a specific letter to Anton LaVey, Charles Pace in 1974defined Wicca as meaning \"enlightened\" not \"wise ones\" ! , meaning the adaptation fromPaganism to Christianity. Gardner did do an excellent job in his manifestation of this religion, butin the process often watered down a significant amount of the alchemical source of positivechange. Charles Pace as it so seems sought to manifest some of this with his involvement withOardner.Charles Pace was a Scottish Witch who was bom in 1920. Pace was known as Hamar'at. Whilebeing a High Priest of a Gardnerian Wiccan Coven in south London, He did have an influence onWicca in the 70's and produced manuscripts based on his developments (as of this writing.currently unpublished).What nukes the Luciferian effective is the ability to form their own ideas, pursue avenues ofopposite methods until all is unified within a workable pattern for the individual. One may chooseto pursue specific patterns of teaching, if as long as they prove concurrent to their individual Willand productive to their own life.The Luciferian Path 3 does not seek to discredit other areas and systems of belief or religiouspractice, we seek to move beyond. All religious leaders are specifically vampires and should thisshould provide insight into the methods employed. The Left Hand Path is one of allegory andsymbolism, and is often misunderstood. The key to the essence our of work lies within the Godform of Shaitan, the initiator or Opposer, the core essence or Psyche resides in the shadow, or thedarkness of the self.The Cabalistic number 75 holds essential keys to this grimoire. the herald star and the number ofthe angel. While many of the rituals are in fact extensions and recreations of the WitchcraftI Ths Satmic Witch by Anton Szandor LaVey, Feral House 1989.Ch*rl<l M. Pace corresponding with Anton LaVey, April 7\", 1974. Blanche Barton, copyright.1 Tht Luciferian Path symbolizes the walking between Dayside (physical) and Nightside (dreaming) andMikJni the knowledge of advancing as a Cod or Goddess itself.4 Cevtn Nichttoter is the founding circle of The Luciferian Sabbatic The Order of Phosphorus, and theNI|htsJd< circle \"Black Order of the Dragon\".i The Coelia, Lesser Key of Solomon Weiser, I99S.tradition, we as within the workings of Coven Nachttoter 4 have sought to communicate a newpath way. This is the Luciferian Path of Shadows, a balanced \"hedge walking\" path that exploresthe depths of darkness and the beauty of dawn. Lucifer stands in both the dawn and the night, thePrince of Darkness and the Bringer of Light. As an adept is aware, one does not master any pathwithout the \"harrowing of hell\". Thus Sabbatic Witchcraft emerges. Many will fear the dark pathof the Sabbatic tradition, especially if they come from a Wiccan background. It is hoped however,that a few witches will seek a new and more adventurous way, one which offers new methods ofmastery and experience.The Luciferian path proves dark and disturbing at first, as the shadows of the dead will walk withyou in dream and waking. The methods employed within this book are those of the twilight,which is balanced between the waking (dayside) and the dreaming (nightside). It is imperative forthe sorcerer to seek mastery of the flesh and the spirit, the balance between the material and thespiritual. Delusion is a disease that is often the destructive factor of the individual upon the LeftHand Path.Just as the Sabbatic tradition is mirrored from the elder avenues of witch-lore so the Setian orLuciferian essence is revealed. The act of witchcraft is in itself sorcery. Why many fear theshadow side of the craft and seek to work only in light is only playing with forces which cannotbe understood in this manner. To truly work with the forces of nature, and to master the self(improve, advance and strengthen) one mustT explore and seek to understand the blackest ofmagick and sorcery. The idea behind this concept is that both the concepts of 'good' and 'evil'may be overcome by transcending each.The fallen angels of ancient lore are considered 'evil' due to their opposing nature: they soughtindependence and their own way (i.e. True Will). They became 'demons' and took bestial forms.There is a clear and relevant explanation for this change and what it represents within a modemcontext. The Christian paths have since turned the old Pagan gods into demons. What is,specifically a demon anyway?The word Demon is derived from the Greek word 'Daimon', meaning spirit. The Greek wordoriginally had no diabolical meaning, Daimons possessed qualities of both 'good' and 'evil'. TheGoetia, the grimoire resurrected by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Aleister Crowleybrought the communion with the fallen angels, or offspring of the fallen angels, known as'Daimons'. The term Goetia itself is from a Greek word for witchcraft and sorcery.!Lucifer is the torch bearer, the very essence of the Black Flame which resides within us all. Asindividuals, the Black Flame is the isolated psyche, the individual which is free thinking andimmortal. Lucifer gave to humanity the greatest gift of all, the gift of life.Many have tried to present Satan and Lucifer as gods of death, yet the opposite is actually theSet is the ancient essence of the individual, the freethinking and strength filled essence that isvirtually the same as Lucifer. The Sabbatic tradition is the expression of the magical currentwhich is known as the Luciferian Path, the Left Hand Path of developing the self within thecurrent of the Serpent, becoming and achieving to reach the aspect of immortality.References to Chaos Magick have applied to the works herein due to the source of the inspiredwork. Chaos Magick is essentially a conglomeration of various systems, despite culture, time or"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"pattern. The system is formed lo work for the individual, which leaves great avenues ofidvancement without overriding belief dogmas that generally manifest with many traditions.The main sigil of The Order of Phosphorus, the very foundation of its magickal work is what iscalled the ALGOL sigil. ALGOL ' is the Luciferian Mirror of immortality and obtainment, thedepth from which the awakened mind shall emerge. This is the Chaos Sphere, with the center theinverted pentagram. The Pentagram is the Eye of Set, the Luciferian core essence of self-deification (developing the self to become as a God or Goddess) through Antinomianism (moving•gainst the natural order, isolating (he psyche and building the Will). Chaos Magick and the LeftHind Path, if approached with a mature attitude may prove a wealth of individual power anddevelopment.The Sabbatic current, as it was formed from oiher areas of sorcery, is dependent upon the varioustraditions which precede it. What should b<r considered is the Left Hand Path conicxi of ilu-Sabbatic current within America (specifically with Coven Nachttoter), and how such may differfrom other Sabbatic traditions.Keep in mind that the practice of the Left Hand Path is not of any vulgar consideration ofmorality. Individuals have choices, and the Luciferian path utilizes God forms, sigils and symbolswhich work with the Shadow side, but in no regard to work 'evil' or averse moral acts. One whotnnsverses this path must be able to distinguish what is right and what is wrong based withinmoral guidelines and rules, the Luciferian SHOULD be a higher embodiment of humanity (andeven seek to move above it) and not be led by so-called anti-moralistic acts.The Sabbatic craft is symbolized through the instruments of art. Every tool developed by themagician is symbolic of his or her self; it holds a small part of their essence. This is partiallydeveloped through consecration and enchantment. The instrument holds an astral thread whichremains with the object.The Instruments of Magickal Art must be approached as extensions of your being. Each oneshould be created or altered after purchase to be personally you! They should reflect who andwhat you are, and the intentions you have of becoming. For instance, if you hold an attribution todivination or to earn a living 'reading the cards', then perhaps consecrating the wand with theligil of the Goetic spirit Guison. I do most certainly suggest such instruments be carefully thoughtout, and kept safe from then on.The attributions to the instruments of the Sabbatic path are based on their method of focus,visualize such forces (in whatever positive aspect this may be according to you belief and desire)and their appearance while creating or consecrating the instruments.The upright Pentagram represents the current which flows to Godhead, the divine consciousnessof the self, which we relate to as the Holy Guardian Angel. The inverse Pentagram represents thelelf as its own independent being, and flows downwards (to the darkness) of matter and thedepths of the mind. This is the symbol of what is called 'Lucifenan independence', the ability toWill and chosen result attainable and separate the psyche by Antinomianism.' Algol is from the Arabic \"Al Ra's al Ghul\" & \"Ri'B al Ohiil\", meaning \"The Demons Head\". 17'\"Century maps label Algol as \"Caput Larvc\" translating \"The Specter's Head\". The sigil itself was designedby the present author for Coven Nachttoter/The Order of Phosphorus.Osiris Risen"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Instruments; of Sabbatic <ArtThe Atbame - Air-Attributed to Air, therefore Lucifer, the Athame is a symbol of the Holy work of the magician.The Athame should be a blade which is straight and double edged. The Athame should bedecorated (if need be) according to the desire of the magician. The Athame is used in castingcircles, banishing, healing, invoking within, and other works of what is called Greater BlackMagick (Will alchemical change within the self to advance and increase the potential forobtaining immortality). The Athame is an extension of beauty, light and the passion of theindividual. Therefore, it is connected with the Holy Guardian Angel in connection wilh the Wand.Consecrate with the following:  J\"Blade, fire born of steel of earth, I do conjure thec, as be my words, blessed by Asmodny,blessed by Lucifer, the working blade of Cain..So mote it be!\"The Evocation Knife --Attributed to Asmodeus, the Evocation Dagger or knife carries the 'elder shadow' or familiarused for the rites of necromancy, evocation, cursing, works of creation and other forms of LesserBlack Magick (Willed change exterior of the self within ones environment). The blade itselfshould appear 'barbaric' and be curved or cruel in appearance. Keep in mind thai the EvocationKjiife is used for blood evocation and spirit (familiar) creations, anything exterior of the sellwhich is defined as Lesser Black Magick. Medieval inspired ceremonial rituals, the summoningof the dead and Goetic rituals would include the use of the Evocation Knife. The 'Elder Shadow'as it is called is a familiar created and bound to the Evocation knife, to exist through it accordingto your will. Asmodeus is the force attending the Sabbatic works of evocation and Goetic sorceryThe Evocation Knife may be made from human or animal bone, shaped and scribed with guardiandaimons or of materials which symbolize the barbaric nature of the Sabbatic Witch, according 10your desires. The Evocation Knife is an extension of what is called the Evil Genius, or the inverseHoly Guardian Angel, the Shadow or darkside of the self. Bless the instrument by the following:\"Blade, forged by the fire of (he Opposer, blessed by the force of Asmoday, I do conjure thec,as be my words...So mote it be!\"The Wand - Fire-Attributed to fire, the wand represents the Will of the magician. Because of Ihe conscious Will,the element is focused as Shaitan, the Opposer or the better known name of Satan: The Force andFire of the spirit is the representation of the Wand, and should be constructed accordingly. Thewand is to be made of wood and should hold two crystals, one at each end to symbolize thepositive and the negative, the polar essence of Magick itself. The wand is connected 10 the HolyGuardian Angel essence of your very self, the higher aspect of your individual Will as adeveloping being of light. One may paint the sigils of guardian daimons which are creaied andbound to the wand using blood or bodily fluids.The Pentacle-Earth-Attributed to the earth, the pentacle represents the very work of the magician, and is thereforeconnected with Belial, the material aspects of being. The Penlacle is the star of the physical self,the very collection of what is called in physical flesh \"I\". The earth is the manifestation ground ofour desires, our very being and our shell known as flesh. The Pentacle is Ihe protection andessence of who we are, and our connected with the earth through Black Magick and SorceryThe Cup - Water-Attributed to water, the Cup carries the memories of our unconscious. Leviathan is the crookedserpent which dwells within our subconscious, coiling and giving us the tools for our ownmanifestation of Will. The Cup should be a Human Skull Cap, called a Kapala and is symbolic ofthe temporary nature of flesh. The Cup may also be a traditional chalice, made of silver andinscribed with the sigils of Leviathan or the Ourabouris, or other water connected daimons orfamiliars. The cup itself is in relation to the great depth, the womb from which all things emergefrom and Ihe memory of all things. The cup itself is feminine in nature, attributed to Lilith and thelunar current associated with water. It might be suggested that one purchases his or her own cupas a chalice (for craft workings of Theurgy) and a skull cap (much more expensive) for theshadow rites. The cup itself should be consecrated in Ihe following manner:\"By the Water of Leviathan I conjure thee,Uy the Water of Lilith I conjure thee.Bless this object, born of my WillTo hold the mysteries of Luciferian wisdom.That this cup shall transmit the mysteries of all memory!So mote it be!\"To consecrate the Kapala. or skull cap, consecrate in the following manner:Trace in your own blood an X, symbolizing the cross roads and the manes which may be calledthere.

The caves of Lilith are reachable through the mirror, and a communication point to theUndead Gods associated with Vampiric Sorcery.The Circle - Hecate•Attributed to the Goddess of the Dead and Witchcraft, Hecate and her Manes and dog familiarsguard the circle, which is the never start and never end source of the universe, perfect from whichnone living or dead may destroy. The circle is barrier from obsession in relation to the mind. Thecircle should always be cast and guarded with your essence, inscribed with sigils of the Gods ofour flesh, that which we create.

Each individual practicing the art of Luciferian Magick willact as an avatar for this force.The Quill -Blood and Sigils-Attributed to our blood, from which we scribe the language of the subconscious (sigils). thewritten text of Leviathan, the Quill is symbolic of Melek Taus, the Peacock Angel known also asShaitan. The Quill is suggestive of a feather from the wing of the fallen angel Astaroth orAsmodeus as well. From which all sigils and spells may be cast, scribed in the ink from thefeather of the Opposer.The Kangling - to summon the dead-Attributed to Lucifuge and the spirits of the astral plane (air), the Kangling is a trumpet madefrom a human thighbone. In Chud ceremonies, the Kangling is used either to exorcize spirits or tosummon the dead. The Kangling may be obtained through importers of Tibetian goods and iscostly. One may carve the sigils of the Fetishes, spirits and daimons which will dwell with theinstrument. Consecrate with a small amount of your blood or bodily fluid.The Drum - to call earth bound spirits.-Attributed to Belial and earth bound spirits, the drum is used specifically in Petro voodoo rites,utilizing off beat drumming patterns to draw the mind through the crooked path. The drum maybe a traditional instrument, consecrated and used accordingly. Some may wish to construct onefrom a human skull, with sigils inscribed and consecrated accordingly. The drum should be usedto induce trance and to call the spirits of caves and hidden within the earth.llaciph Ashara - Earth (night) -Wand fetish made of human bones.•Attributed 10 Lilith, the Goddess of Succubi/Incubi and the gateway through mirrors. The BaciphAshara (literally, 'Bones of Fire' in Ouranian) are human rib bones, inscribed with the sigil of thespecific familiar, bound with blood and sexual fluids. One would use the Baciph Ashara as onewould use the wand, attributed to fire. Lilith is symbolic of this instrument in its earth bound andcamal aspect. One may summon and bind the gateway ofLilith and the Qlippothic forms of chaosthrough the wands. Creating earth bound and fire familiars, evoking demons and other elementalattributed forms are used for such in this form of witchcraft.The Grand Sabbatic Circle-This circle, developed in Vampiric Covens in the early 1990's was later redesigned slightly byby Coven Nachttoter to act as a dual mirror of the Vampiric current and the Luciferian Gnosis.The system of Luciferian Witchcraft acts as the gateway to the black flame, from which theinitiate enters the circle to invoke the Holy Guardian Angel, the Luciferian Spirit within the mind.Each individual practicing the an of Luciferian Magick will act as an avatar for this force.IFetish VesselsFetish Vessels are spirit pots or ngangas. In Santeria, a latin form of witchcraft, the darksideaspect is known as Palo Mayombe. Individuals known to practice Palo Mayombe are calledPaleros. Emerging from Africa in the Congo, Palo Mayombe was said to transverse to theCaribbean during the slave trade to Cuba and surrounding areas in the mid 1500's.Palo Mayombe is well known and practiced in such areas as Mexico, Brazil, Central America andthe like. What should be understood is the essence of which it derives, witchcraft in its purestform. Washed away is the white light, unbalanced feather tiptoe barren goddess worship. What isreplaced is a well-balanced system that advances the process of Self-Deification through the useof Black Magick. Transformation into positive areas of living is the purpose of witchcraft, andnever 10 purposely kill or harm another (unless provoked or in defense)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"It>The essence of Palo Mayombe is working with the shades of the dead, the spirits who have grownin power and exist within the astral plane.

This may be a large simple clay pot if a large cauldron is not feasible.You may use also items such as dolls or created forms to house familiars.CASTING THE CIRCLE (Sabbatic)Casting the circle is significant as it announces your intent of the an of sorcery, realizes yourdivine Will and the manner from which you work the art.Draw circle in flour if not painted in temple.Place 3 candle in each ofthe four cardinal directions.The altar can be on the ground, a table, rock or such.

Theslow breathing technique, as described by Tantrics described a slow rise of astral energy to form ashield and to clear the mind of thoughts other than the goals of the rite you will conduct.The rite as described by Coven Nachttoter is based within the gathering of shadows, theelemcmals formed in magickal workings to protect the physical and spiritual body from attack.This technique may be used to also clear the mind for the purpose of relaxation.The forces summoned in evocation should not be feared, and should be embraced with openarms. Specifically, within a demonic evocation, once the spirit has been evoked into the circle,the individual would enter this circle to invoke the spirit within. In early Black Magic rites theindividual would cower within a circle, threatening the spirit and trying desperately to obtainmastery over this being which he spent so much time summoning. Exorcizing the Will does notmean commanding, controlling and trying to make people, spirits or animals fear you.The specific reason why the Black Magickian or Witch summons or evokes within the triangle ifnui fearful of the spirit is obvious. The direction of the Will means everything, this may beapproached within the concept of space enhancement to activate areas of the brain which allowconcentration. The Command to Look comes to mind.

The mystery therefore is within thesymbolic nature of the familiar, and you will understand that it must dwell with you.Creation of the Fetish or Nganga, the ZarabandaThe pot should be a virgin vessel, previously devoid of use. The phase of the moon has beenfound to provide an excellent formulaic method of creating and summoning the familiar. You willwant to create a sigil based upon the nature of the spirit to be called, and with such other itemsthat hold relation to the spirit. All of which should be placed in the pot while blessing each underthe calling down of the moon. You should inscribe the Zarabanda sigil in your own blood uponthe sigil or pot itself.14When the moon begins to wane, bring your self the first night to the place where the urn may beburied (preferably an abandoned graveyard). If this is an urban area and impossible, use a roomwhich is not slept in by anyone. Cast the circle and perform the Binding of Shadows ritual, thenwith the pot in the circle arouse yourself focusing intently upon the spirit you are evoking. At themoment of orgasm, allow the fluids to go within the pot (if female transfer what fluids possibleby hand). When the orgasm is obtained, the desire should be imagined and not let out of the minduntil the orgasm is finished. The pot should be sealed and buried in the cemetery. Each night,while the moon increases, one should evoke the spirit and call with a focused mind. You maybring gifts of rum or some elixir to offer up to Ihe spirit, which is growing night by night.On the last night of the moon, dig up the pot then take to the sacred place in which the ngangashall be kept. Pour the contents into a larger vessel (if you are using something like a cauldron,ect) or clean off the one which you shall use again. Remove the cover and consecrate the vesselagain while focusing upon the feeding of the spirit.Use incense, oils and an atmosphere that reflects the mood of the work you are undertaking.The sigil of Ihe Zarabanda may be painted in your blood upon the outside of the spirit pot orcauldron, or the sigil of the specific spirit. Place the bones and attributes within the cauldron andenvision a great spirit dwelling within it, you may feel cold or have hot flashes, which mayincrease 10 which you feel very strange. This is indeed normal, keep in mind Ihe shade will helpyour workings so do feed it well.Take now the human or animal skull (which will be a vessel for the spirit) and place this upon thecauldron (if a pot with a small opening, a skull may not be necessary). Place all of the otherhuman bones around the skull or within the pot.At Midnight, when the Black Sun emerges behind the Moon, consecrate circle and place cauldronwithin it, place four black candles which represent the cardinal points of the Infernal Princes.Light each candle, acknowledging the crowned prince as evoke them unto your presence.

The next evening, 1 served the astral by the means of theblack mirror to discover the nature ofihis spirit, which was indeed revealed again as Azathoz,which appears in a black shadow form Dy means of dreaming postures (the death posture in thenightside state is the inversion of Set, the coming forth by night).The first night of nganga creation, as taught to me by my wife (who is of Hispanic origin and hasfamily rools in Palo Mayombe and Santcria), allowed a surge of energy within the graveyard.

The shade was a black shadow which had talon like claws, similar to ourVarcolaci sigil and a night bom astral forms (details within the inner order of the Black Order ofthe Dragon).
