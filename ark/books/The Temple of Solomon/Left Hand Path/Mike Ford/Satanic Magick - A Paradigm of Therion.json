The rite itself is not to glorify Christianity in its degradation, however to present the beauty and diabolic vision of the great rebel in its initial phase. Lucifer, as the bringer of light is the strong angel who was brighter than others; he would not be limited to spiritual togetherness, or giving the spirit to something else. Lucifer became the power of self-love and the power to become. Understand that the Black Mass is a rite of rebellion, of understanding that there is a spark to be created by defying the spiritual tyrants of our age. The Black Mass is generally to be conducted by several participants, however it can be performed by one who has the imagination and focus to do so. The Black Mass may be an invalid ritual for many Luciferians, viewing it as a relic which holds no plausible standard in the higher workings of the Luciferian faith. The Black Mass is indeed a useful relic and should be considered useful in terms of what Anton LaVey called a Psychodrama. The Possession Ritual as shown here is a meaningful inversion of the Catholic Exorcism rite – it is a call to Legion, the darkness within. I suggest any Luciferian who holds a foundation in Christianity at least once, it will lay a foundation of rebellion necessary in the perverse culture of the west. The Black Mass here is based on the Aubrey Melech and Anton LaVey’s work, both of which are highly useful. This is the Aubrey Melech version, slightly reworked according to my own practice. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 I can ask each and every one who may practice the Black Mass to NOT take this as a canon of the Luciferian Path, as it is only a starting point. It may hit the hammer on the anvil, causing a spark, yet the true Black Flame will be illuminated further once you move forward in self-creating works. The BLACK MASS is meaningful as a point of study, practice and focus – but do not mistake it for the practice of depth in the Luciferian Faith. It is a tool of inspiration and self-awakening.

Ford Akhtya October 31st 2008 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 HOW TO USE THIS BOOK This small grimoire or book of wisdom is a paradigm of Luciferian Light from a mythological approach. The system of the Antichrist is one of self-evolution and transformation to ascend into the light. The light is spiritual wisdom, to know the basic principle: 1. I am God and there is no other. 2. The Antichrist is a veiled symbol of self-elevated power and wisdom. 3. Magick is the art of knowing yourself, mapping your self-evolution and becoming like it. The symbolism of the Antichrist is powerful if you live anywhere in Western or even Eastern world. Let us change on a small level the understanding of the antichrist. Do you want to destroy the world? Probably not, if you do, I suggest a mood enhancing prescription chosen by your doctor. An Antichrist wants to build up and make the world better – without the weakness of the sheep religions. The Satanic Magick presented in this book is no doubt powerful, it is not for every Luciferian however it will stimulate many to ascend towards the Empyrean. Use this paradigm of the beast to raise yourself up – use it for a year, two years or a lifetime. Become something better! "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 WHAT IS SATANIC MAGICK? Satanism is slightly different from Luciferian Magick in that it is more ego-direct. The Satanic paradigm is the Adversarial spirit made flesh; the world conquered here and now while the Luciferian paradigm is more expansive in approach and result. Satanic Magick is the ego-focused transformative process; it is about building the self in intelligence, strength of will, spiritual independence and using the Black Arts to achieve your desires here and now! In addition the repressed aspects of the individual are unleashed: they have taken archetypical form: LUCIFER: Pride – be proud of your accomplishments, yet don’t rest on them too long. Prepare yourself to grow and transform accordingly. Just as Lucifer in Satanic mythology takes numerous forms, you too but be able to understand different perceptions and allow the transformative spirit to allow you to shape accordingly. BEELZEBUB: Gluttony – the Lord of Flies or the power of without guilt or restriction. Be cautious not to indulge too much, it can make you lose your edge. LEVIATHAN: Envy – This can be a creative process. Leviathan is the Crowned Prince of Hell, related to the abyss or primordial deep. Once the Satanist can master his or her subconscious mind, Leviathan, the dragon-serpent of the abyss will raise up in the Magickian and give he or she the knowledge of the self. Envy is seeing something we want everyday, lusting for it. Envy is a powerful motivational force – use it, enjoy it and allow it to make you BETTER, smarter, stronger in mind or"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 body – don’t allow envy to insight weakness and failure however, such is the curse. MAMMON: Avarice is the desire for money and worldly possession. One must understand that the need of money is something which causes mastery in this world: what must be clear is when one just finds lust for money rather than a balanced perspective of goals and rewards in life then is it a problem. Mammon is an Aramaic word which means “wealth” or “property”. Christians claim to damn this desire yet many live quite a bit out of touch from the “people” they desire to save, or the savior which their stories tell so much of. BELPHAGOR: Sloth is what the demon Belphagor inspires. The Lord of the Dead in the Qlippoth, Belphagor insights sleep and rest. Sloth is only a problem when it hinders your work. Don’t rest too long, yet enjoy the time you have. ASMODEUS: Lust is the passion the Demon prince Asmodeus inspires. Asmodeus, like other demons brought into Christianity from the ancient Persian “Eshm” or “Aeshma”, fury. Lust drives all creatures and should be viewed as a positive motivator – it is only negative when it can cause pain and destruction. SATANIC MAGICK IS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHMENT The rebellion of the spirit against the tyrannical restrictiveness in the human body and mind. Understand that a majority of mainstream religions of today are based around the Judeo-Christian concepts viewed as the common “right” of today. Let’s consider the topic of death. Christians believe in a reward or afterlife wherein the soul is in perpetual ecstasy, a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 “heaven” if you will. To consider such a foundation for keeping others in line with thought may be an intelligent choice, it is for the sheep rather silly. Heaven or perpetual ecstasy is a state of mindlessness, of non-perception and therefore no insight into experience. Think of how you feel when you do something you enjoy too much – you grow tired of it at some point, needing more to stimulate your senses once again. Heaven would have to be a spiritually designed sensory adjustable system – always expanding and getting more “spiritually” expensive. Is there a union for that, what happens when you grow “tired” and loose the point of ecstasy? Is this the fate of the First Archon? If you believe or have had experience with a type of afterlife, you must understand there is a sense of balance – neither perpetual torture nor ecstasy. Christians must understand that you have this life – don’t live in a state of spiritual fear, restricting your passions or desires. Live your life according to you passion and drive, enjoy it and build an inner sense of experienced spirituality – not blind faith. The reason Christianity has been so popular in the world is due to the long corrupted Roman empire using it as a tool of control – it requires no real “work” or “discipline” to be Christian, just act “good” and pray when you do something “bad”, after all God does forgive everything, right? Embarking upon the path of Luciferian Light, you have to “listen to music with new ears” as Neitzsche mentioned, understanding things differently. That has been the greatest challenge for new Luciferians and Satanists, thinking LIKE the Adversary.

The concept of the Antichrist from a Luciferian perspective is a far older idea than before Christ itself, or the accepted association there from. The Antichrist is the association of the liberated Luciferian Spirit, the self-illuminated one who, clothing the spirit in the darkness of atavistic desires, creates"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 their own world according to the desires of the practitioner. The Antichrist mentioned here is not specifically ordained as “evil” or “anti life”, rather is for the evolution of human life, something reaching toward the Luciferian Light itself. The antichrist in a mythological sense is a powerful archetype and symbol for achieving spiritual and material power in life. For those Luciferians or Satanists who wish to adopt a powerful paradigm, the initiatory focus of the mythology of Revelations and other references may provide a powerful model of becoming. The essence of the paradigm of the antichrist is an evolution of spirit, the ascension of Lucifer as the Morning Star. Does it matter if the biblical reference was a King of Tyre? No, as the foundations of kings in those times were inherently Luciferian. This pathway is a pathway of initiation for those interested in Satanic Magick. An antichrist is an individual, who, embracing Satanic archetypes, seeks to continually transform the self into a perceived anthropomorphic image of the beast. I highly suggest someone who seeks to work in similar mythological concepts to look to the history and mythology of Antiochus IV and Nero among others. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION ANTIOCHUS IV EPIPHANES Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The name Epiphanes translates “The Shining One” and is his own associated title. Antiochus IV ruled the Seleucid Empire during the time of Caligula and Claudius. Antiochus lived in Rome during part of his youth and once he ascended to power, killed his future potential rival (heir to the throne) as an infant. Antiochus first began a war against Egypt, capturing everything except for Alexandria – Rome would have stepped in due to political issues and stopped him if he had proceeded and was forced to leave Egypt and Cypress which he had captured. Antiochus then organized a campaign against Jerusalem, something of which granted him the lofty title of “Little Horn” in the Revelations text. Antiochus invaded Jerusalem and did rather cruel things. Antiochus in his own time in Rome learned the Luciferian principle of solidifying his power; when it is meaningful to be Vain in his spirit, his pride allowed him to affirm that his captives should adopt the customs he chose, else suffer a cruel fate. Antiochus was rumored to have been killed during his war with Egypt that his puppet priesthood was cast out of Jerusalem during this. Antiochus knew that with the war he was forced to give Cypress and Egypt upon destroying them would anger some of his council and people, he could not suffer the Jerusalem rebellion as well. How could one survive in such a world when their cruelty could not match their enemies? "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 As Antiochus IV was the shining one, the embodiment of who we associate traits with Lucifer, is indeed an early embodiment of the Antichrist. Antiochus entered Jerusalem, his army terrifying the inhabitants as their “Wicked One” as they styled him had returned from the Abyss. Antiochus entered the temple to plunder it, taking all the gold and holy relics the Priesthood had collected, slaying many people in the process. It was either during this period or after that Antiochus IV sent his General, Apollonius and a regent Lysias with an army to slay the men of Jerusalem unless they adopt Greek Gods and customs at once. His time of trying to convert them slowly was over, they were a seeming embarrassment to him. It was this act which became the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION. He cut the throat of a pig on the altar of “The Lord” and erected a statue of Zeus in place of the Hebraic God. Antiochus had them either eat some of the Pig, which of course they refused, so they were scalped, skinned and cut their tongues out. He also had their hands and feet cut off, slaying many of the inhabitants. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 THE LITTLE HORN The little horn, the symbol of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the power which speaks great and wondrous things. To understand the initiatory symbolism within the context of this book, the Little Horn represents the aspects of the voice speaking that which will come to pass, creating your own reality. The Little Horn is a power which relates to humanity, to encourage individual ascension and to become a God. The serpent is no longer in the mythological garden, it is here and now. Listen to your instincts, ascend and be as a God! Suggested workings with the Little Horn concept: 1. Perception is everything, think of how you are perceived in the world. The VAMPIRE GATE – The Vampyre Magickian will give advanced initiatory suggestions based on this concept. 2. Studying psychology is a meaningful event, knowing what people want to hear and know. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 THE BEAST and HIS FORMS The imagery of the Beast is symbolic in nature as with any ideal in Magick. The symbolism of the Beast and Dragon is a image of the Astral Existence of the Black Magickian, the life of the physical or material with the astral or symbolic essence. Let us explore the symbolism of the apocalypse, the astral cloaks of the spiritual Luciferian ascendants... The traits of the Antichrist must be understood in a positive initiatory way, not limited to the traditional Judeo-Christian concept of some man of terror ending the world – honestly, Christianity as a foundation religion has done enough to destroy the planet not needing the so-called enemy to help it along. In short, the Antichrist should seek to raise humanity – any initiate may be as an Antichrist, the following are commentary based on this initiatory work. “A King of Fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences..” Daniel 8: 23 – 25 A fierce countenance is one who is strong and willful in posture, in appearance. This is visual magick. Dark sentences is the language of the subconscious – listening to instinct and creating the life you wish. Dark Sentences is the whispering of Leviathan into the ear of the aspirant. The Man of Lawlessness is one who rebels spiritually to find his own path, his or her own way. The Initiatory Antichrist must exalt himself above the God of Gods – this means you must recognize the God within, the Luciferian Spirit and ascend upwards by a solid initiatory path."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 Learning and gaining wisdom is essential upon the path of Magick, the knowledge that you gain in this world will assist you upon the path itself, no matter what the subject is. A great student and practitioner of Magick under the element of Belial is often good at their school focus, their job or anything he or she applies themselves to. BELIAL THE ANTICHRIST ENFLESHED Belial is attributed with the element of EARTH and the NORTH, according to traditional demonology. Belial or Belias, from beli\" and \"'ol\" is the spirit which means “Without a master” and by name translates to the leader of Adversarial strength. This spirit, embodied with the Luciferian Spirit, is the Lord of the Earth, someone who has mastered their own course in life. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, Belial is associated with Malkira or Malik-Ra the Evil Angel, \"the angel of lawlessness\"—\"the ruler of this world, whose name is Matanbuchus\" and relates to the spirit of Lucifer descending into the Body of the Antichrist, being Belial. In a historical and mythological sense, Belial is Nero. Upon Nero’s death, many who feared and loathed him considered him the Antichrist. The Sibylline oracles made reference to Belial as Beliar, who is a great Luciferian Angel who descends into the flesh of a man. It is suggested that Belial will come from the Samaritans, a land of warlike races. It was written that Belial will raise up the height of the mountains, stirring the sea and will behold the power of a great fiery Sun and a Shining Moon. He will be able to raise the dead and perform many miracles. Belial in this sense is one who is able to seek knowledge and gain wisdom by experience, which is gifted with"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 self-illumination. To raise the dead is to summon and control sleeping atavisms and archetypes, to understand the self on all levels. Another text relates to Belial descending into the form of a man, being a great angel and the king of this world. In the “Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs” Belial who is called Beliar is said to emanate 7 spirits of the Adversary which are inherently a part of humanity. The eighth is mentioned as a controlling or encircling factor for the Antichrist. They are: 1. The Spirit of Fornication, who dwells in the mind and senses of the individual. Use this to exercise desire and have restraint where needed. 2. The Spirit of Insatiateness, being hungry for more. In Yatuik-Dinoih this would refer to AZ. 3. The Spirit of Fighting and Aggression, primal instinct given a place to properly manifest and keep it within balance. Learn to defend yourself. 4. The Spirit of Trickery or using the FOUR HELLS in YATUK-DINOIH to master the world around you. 5. The Spirit of Pride, exalting the God which is YOU. 6. The Spirit of the Lie, or Serpent. This is cunning and crafty in mind; announcing the desire you wish to see in your life. 7. The Spirit of Envy, wanting more and using it to improve your life. The enemy may be used as a benefit for motivation sometimes as well. 8. The Eighth spirit is the one of fantasy, using and enjoying the dream and the subconscious mind, it is a way to understand your own life and deep desires. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 THE ANTICHRIST AWAKENED ON EARTH The Antichrist in the reference of an initiatory system is a meaningful association of self-awakening. The Antichrist is one who adopts a meaningful role in society – a politician, a business professional, a lawyer, police officer, teacher – anyone who can influence many. The Antichrist would adopt the Luciferian Religion as one of the deepest meaning – reflecting Light and the Power of Self Love, explaining to others that we must have a balance and understanding of both darkness and light. That Religions such as Christianity are based on fear and tyranny while the Luciferian faith is built on understanding and developing the self. The Antichrist will not be as blasphemous but may display the Luciferian Religion through ACTION rather than word. This would mean a focusing on illuminating humans to recognize that their faith in the spirit must equal their deeds on earth – to offer more responsibility by chosen path, to avoid degrading religions such as Christianity as no longer serving the needs of humanity, while elevating fellow humanity by actions and deeds which raise wisdom and value to all. There are many different ways an Antichrist may arise, you must be willing to advance humanity to ascend as Gods and Goddesses – it is the only way to understand our potential as people. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 THE GRADE SYSTEM OF THE ANTICHRIST Corpus Mysticum Antichristi The System of Ascension begins with exploring the darkness of Leviathan, from which you shall arise and become something new and powerful. This system is non-dogmatic and is meant for anyone wishing to transform in the apocalyptic image of the beast of revelations. The Magickal Quintessence is revealed in the moment of awakening Luciferian Light. The Corpus Mysticum Antichristi may be defined in a detailed manner as a pathway of the independent practitioner. This is the dragon-way of the initiate who is able to walk upon the path of Leviathan. Fundamentally, it is understood in the path of Luciferian Witchcraft that the broad yet tortuous way of the serpent may expand and according to the initiatory learning of the individual. The Path of Corpus Mysticum Antichristi is one based on the foundation of subconscious fear and terror – the Antichrist is the body and human shell of divinity. This essence of divinity is the Ascended Angel Samael, or Belial yet known as Lucifer. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 THE FORM AND SYMBOLISM OF THE ANTICHRIST The concept of the Antichrist through history indicates the nature of the subconscious as Leviathan, the dragon which rises forth from the sea. His power comes from within, it is LEVIATHAN, BELIAL, LUCIFER and SATAN as the Dragon of Fire. Let us explore the colorful symbolism of the Antichrist and the associative symbolism. “thin-legged, tall, with a tuft of gray hair on his forehead, which is bald, while his eyebrows reach to his ears, and there is a leprous spot on the front of his hands. He will transform himself in the presence of those who see him: at one time he will be a young boy but at another time he will be an old man. He will transform himself in every sign, but the sign of his head he will not be able to change” (3:15-17). -Apocalypse of Elijah It is here that the legend or vision of the anthropomorphic manifestation of Lucifer is a powerful individual."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 For the Antichrist initiate to gain a step upon the path, he or she must recognize several representative spirits and elements. THE HEAD – Some depictions of the Antichrist show him with having two skulls or fiery red hair. The hair is also described as being spiked or pointed like arrows and white in other texts. Upon the forehead of the Antichrist is the word KAFIR according to some Muslim descriptions of the Ad Dajjal. “And these are the signs of him: his head is as a fiery flame; his right eye shot with blood, his left eye blue-black and he has two pupils. His eyelashes are white; and his lower lip is large; but his right thigh slender; his feet broad; his finger is bruised and flat. This is the sickle of desolation” - Syriac Testament of the Lord EYES – The eyes of the antichrist are perhaps the most interesting. In Syriac texts the Right eye is Bloody (hunger, anger and passion), while the left eye is Blue-black. In Ethiopian texts the Right Eye is bloody while the left is “Dead” (showing comparison to his knowledge of the spirit world). The Greek texts concerning the Antichrist depict his right eye as Bright as the Morning Star (Wisdom, power) and his left eye being like a Lion (Proud, strong, a King). The eyes are very significant to the essence of the Luciferian Spirit. As you initiate yourself via the Corpus Mysticum Antichristi, you must experience the essence of Leviathan, Belial, Satan and Lucifer. These are not mere demons, they are fountains of power and wisdom, if approached correctly will provide a near-corruptible spirit. I mention corruptible as most humans become corrupt or shift subconscious paradigms without acknowledging their conscious guidelines. Power can destroy when discipline and balance is not present.

Darkness is that from which the world is made from. FINGERS – Like scythes – the sickle of desolation is the sign of the Antichrist. THE MARK OF THE ANTICHRIST – Often the mark has been related to 666, the number of NERO, however ancient text also attributes the mark of the Beast as the “SICKLE OF DESOLATION”.

The Luciferian Magick of “Ahrimanic Yoga” give specific aspects of initiation via Shakti arousal of the Chakras, a deeper symbolic foundation far older that the often corrupt Judeo-Christian concepts here. The ritual of REX INFERNUS is considered spiritual rebellion to a higher purpose – the Magickian is seeking via the power of the Beast/Dragon (Therion) to rise from the depths of Hell (the atavistic) and does not refer to simplistic concepts of rebellious thought. This ritual should be performed with the altar piece being a black mirror – from which the Magickian may only behold the shadow self – the image of idolatry and the search for self perfection. The success of any of the Magick here is to recognize and empower the self through the essence of both Samael and Lilith, how could one exist without the other? How could the traditional “Satan” know woman without the wisdom of his bride, Lilith?

Traditionally, or ideally, the host is sanctified by the renegade priest who traditionally performs Satan’s Mass or stolen from a church tabernacle. Red wine, which better maintains the analogy with the blood of Christ, is used for both black and white masses. The Luciferian may approach the blood of Christ as a vampyric elixir, that which the participants devour the spirit and essence of the dead so-called prophet. A Chalice to contain the wine. Customarily this is silver or any metal or substance but gold, as is a requirement for all the altar furnishings used in Satanism.

The text here is indeed original, perverted and corrupted to a Satanic Ritual of Possession, rather than Exorcism. The ritual is designed to call forth the Wicked Dragon, thus the title of the rite. It may be approach as a prayer of self-inspiration, of self-love and of dedication to the initial focus of the Luciferian Path. It matters not if one believes in “spirits” or not, what matters is the dedication of the rite itself. The performance and recital is meant for the individual performing to let the words and phrases flow and roll of the tongue, focusing each thought on the ritual itself. Let the imagination stir with the ritual, call for Legion within as a part of yourself, not something exterior. The Luciferian does not submit to any God other than what is within, thus he or she must remain in control of their destiny. Draco Nequissime is a Ritual composed for the encircling and possession of the self by the Infernal Dragon, called Satan by most. The daemon called Legion is the invigorating force which initiates by dream. As you will notice, the source of the Possession Ritual is derived from the Roman Catholic Exorcism Rite as well as other sources. It is essential that the initiate should approach this seriously and with a strong and determined Will.

Ahriman is considered one brother created by Zurvan and was the opposing force to Ohura Mazda. Ahriman is also known as Angra Mainyu, an older title derived from Angra Mainyu, being the “evil” or averse spirit. Ahriman is a sorcerer who achieved a means of immortality and power over darkness and shadow. One who creates his desire in flesh. In relation to the sorcerer or practitioner of Yatuk-Dinoih, the individual seeks by developing their own system of sorcery, to become like Ahriman, just as did Akht-Jadu in the Zoroastrian tales. Ahriman is called the Great Serpent or Dragon, whose spirit is a shapeshifter and tester of flesh and mind. It was considered in some Zoroastrian tales that Ahriman and the Daevas, his angels, ecisted between the earth and the fixed stars, which would be essentially of the element Air (much like Lucifer his later identification). In creation myths, Ahriman first saw light and sprang into the air in the form of a great snake, that the heavens were shattered as he brought darkness into light. Ahrimanic Yoga – Achieving control and command over the body. Each ArchDaeva is representative of each Chakra and such are points of specific power in the body. Ahrimanic Yoga represents disunion with the universe, as opposed to union from a Buddhist view. Akha [Avestan/Pahlavi] - Avestan, meaning evil. In the context of Liber HVHI and Luciferian Witchcraft, it is a term signifying the antinomian path."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 Akho [Avestan/Pahlavi] – From the Avestan “akha” meaning “evil”, Akho is mentioned in the Denkard as a word representing a “current” of averse energy or evil, through which one aligning their thoughts in possessing spiritual independence, antinomianism and self-deification one may reach into the spirit of Ahriman. This supports the initatory foundation of the Luciferian path itself – the Adept prepares to become like the Adversary his or her self, based on their own unique path. Akht [Avestan/Pahlavi] – The Sorcerer who was the embodiment of the Yatus, the demonic forces of Ahriman. Akht-Jadu or Kabed-us-spae as he was called was mentioned in Matigan-I Yosht-I Fryan. Akhtya was the founder and member of the Yatus, a coven of ‘demons’ and sorcerers who wandered Persia, practicing and developing sorcery. The name Akht itself means ‘evil’, ‘filth’ and ‘pestilence’, thus relates to the initiatory nature of Akhti as a sorcerer of the Adversary, by the darkness shall he come into light. Akhtya or Azyta is thus considered a symbol of the Zanda, which is an Apostle or Priest of Ahriman. ALGOL – A word which derives from the Arabic Al Ra’s al Ghul, Al-Ghul, or Ri’B al Ohill, which is translated “The Demon’s Head”. Algol was in Hebrew known as Rosh ha Shaitan, or “Satan’s Head”, as some traditions have referred to Algol as the Head of Lilith. The Chinese called Algol Tseih She, which is “Piled up corpses” and was considered a violent, dangerous star due to its changing vivid colors. On some 17th century maps Algol was labeled, “The Specter’s Head”. Algol upon some research has"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 indicated that possibility Three stars which are an eclipsing binary, which may explain some of the rapid color change. Some writers have connected Algol with the Egyptian Khu, or spirit. The Khu is considered a shadow spirit which feeds on other shades of the dead. In reference to the writings and initiatory symbolism of Michael W. Ford, ALGOL is the sigillized in one form as a Chaos Star with an Averse Pentagram in the center. The Pentagram refers to the Eye of Set, timeless and divine, godlike and independent. The Chaos Star is destruction, Change and power – all of which emerges from the Eye of Shaitan, or Set. It is this Chaos which then brings Order. ALGOL is the mirror of the sorcerer, one who may enter and reside in the pulsing eye of blackened flame. Arezura [Avestan/Pahlavi] – Arezurahe griva (Arezura) in the Bundahishin is called “a mount at the gate of hell, whence the demons rush forth”. Arezura is the gate to hell in the Alburz mountain range in present day Iran. The North is traditionally the seat of Ahriman, wherein the cold winds may blow forth. Arezura from an initiatory perspective is the subconscious, the place where sorcerers may gather and grow in their arts, by encircling and manifesting their desire. M.N. Dallah wrote in “The History of Zoroastrianism” concerning a connection with demons holding mastery over the earth, their ability to sink below the earth and that such demons around the time of Zoroaster walked the earth in human form. In the Denkard, it is described that one who becomes a vessel for the “evil religion” becomes physically an abode for “Unholy Demons” or Daevas.
