FordA short dedication to the Luciferian Sabbat and those seeking their own light within thegnosis of the Adversary. The initiation of the witch into the Circle of Cain, the living Sonof Satan and Lilith, the great Harlot and Demoness, the Adversarial deific force of darkinstinctual desire and willed continual existence.With the pen inked in the blood of Abel do I scribeOf when the blade fell I knew pain and a blinding heatOf falling deep into my own created hell, of knowing a heavenOf isolation and self-reliance...Then this ecstasy of transformation.The blood of my shell encircled me, and alone did I first summonForth my father of whom I knew by dreamDid that dragon come and ignite within,My soul, my initiatorBy giving to the daemon did my eyes open anew.I conjure thee, o wanderer who bears a black thorn stickI adjure thee, who the blood of Abel did ignite your sensesWho lifted thee up into the flames of your fatherIn Iblis shadow did you awaken in the arms of Lilith, the Moon.I summon thee, Cain of Old, whose words open the gates of hellI invoke thee, Cain of the serpent skin, who is the first of witch bloodI conjure thee, Cain who is the earthly devil, who is the master of spiritsEncircle and awaken within my flesh, my blood, my mind.By thy depths of which I walk herein shall I become rebornIn the Name and Mark of the Devil, whom I swear my spirit untoI am myself the redeemer and bringer of the Infernal PactWhich holds no bounds nor mortal strain,Yet my desires shall be filled by the Eye within the blackened triangleOf Cain and the Children of Rebellion, rise up with meOf Cain and those going forth by night unto the infernal sabbatLet the devil bless my nameHearken and remain, Satan be thy name...Adversary – Opposer – Fornicator –DeceiverAll of which is my nameBody of shadow, Body of LightAlign in the Noon and by Moon lit nightSo it just begins, life to never endBy flesh or spirit way, shall my mind remain.."}]
