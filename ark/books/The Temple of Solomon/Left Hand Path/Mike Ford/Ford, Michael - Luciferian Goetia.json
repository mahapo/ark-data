This book is not meant for the individual to develop profane behavior, antisocial actions nor abhorrent philosophy which may be defined as not-healthy for the self. The essence of this book is exploring the Luciferian foundations of human evolution, the next step in our spiritual and philosophical ideologies. Any negative behavior or criminal actions (as defined by current society) is considered a deterrent from our individual evolution, thus is not acceptable. Magick is the Highest Art of conscious elevation; it is the specific ascension of the self and an opening forth of Higher Articulation of Self. Magick is the Arte of the Sun, which is fertile and beautiful, the very foundation built in Gold brilliance. Magick is the evolution of the Spirit and the Self, the very path of mediation between us and our Gods. It is ultimately however the separation from us from all Gods and the Emerald Crown of which we adopt – we Become as Gods and Goddesses individual and beautiful in many ways. Black Magick as revealed in current standards is the art of Self-Deification through Antinomianian processes, that by the self separating from the natural order do we move in-between the world of waking and dreaming. In the Art of Primal Sorcery this is defined as Encircling/Ensorcelling the Self in the Dragon’s being. The Circle in the modern context of Magick and Ceremonial Workings is not designed to keep forces out, such as being a philosophy which if employed in this manner, will lay a foundation which causes the magician to fail from the start. The Circle is a Span of self control; it is our influence of who we are and what we will become. Do not fear forces outside the self, your greatest enemy is within. Any magician who is able to summon any spirits in the Goetia should be prepared to face that which they call – or else suffer the consequences. The modern magician understands that no Work may be successful is the intent is not pure and clear. If you seek to summon one of the Djinn of the Goetia, understand how the spirit relates to your mind, how it will manifest in yourself. Do not summon something that which you are not comfortable in working with. Do not on the other hand fear the very forces which you seek to command, be it Angelic or Demonic. Black Witchcraft is working with averse or ‘black’ forces which are translated as shadow aspects of the sorcerers psyche. These shadows of the self are essential to our own self-development and becoming as individuals. It requires that the witch be well disciplined and also well balanced, save from the gates of failure and madness. To look into the Eye of Set and Lilith-Hecate or even Ahriman is to face off forces which would devour any not prepared to become bearers of the Black Flame, a Luciferian Spirit themselves. Once this Pact is made, when the Sigillium Diaboli is upon the mind, spirit and body, then there is no turning back – only the ascension of the spirit as ‘beyond’ the mortal clay."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 In the modern world of magicians, Sathan is our initiator and stimulator of the psyche. One should remember, in Pre-Islamic lore Satan/Azazel is considered the Imagination – Sufism recognizes Satan as the imagination itself. Sathan is thus our announcer of the path, the very fountain of our attainment. In the view of a God form and model, Lucifer (Sathan) is an ideal form to align with in an initiatory sense. Azazel rebelled against the natural order (God – Ain Soph) as he sought independence, fell to the realms of earth and awoke in Hell (earth – the chthonic realm). Rather than fearing and cowering, hiding, Lucifer understood he was an independent Mind and existed independently from the natural order and roused all other fallen angels to stand strong. In this context, Lucifer was creating Order from Chaos. This is a seeming model of the initiate, that we Work towards recognizing our own sense of being, and to expand the circle of control. The Daimons/Djinn of the Goetia are initiatory forces as well. Consider the definitions of Angel and Demon. The significance is beneficial in the context of this grimoire. Angelic Spirits are solar/air based spirits who posses a higher articulation of being, that is, they resonate with the more developed aspects of the self i.e. communion with the Initiatic Guide/Holy Guardian Angel. Demons are spirits/fallen angels which proceed to grow in shadows and the darkness of the earth, but are as significant and beneficial as Angelic Spirits. In unity these Djinn are of Fire and Air, thus enflame the very essence of self in the illumination of being (Black Flame – Self-Perception and Being). Black Magick is the development and refinement of the Self on every level. It can be unpleasant such as questioning yourself and testing your limits, and it can be pleasure filled. It is necessary not to grow lazy while working with these spirits, as the Work will then disintegrate and cause numerous problems. Stay focused and resilient to the purpose of the Work – yet do not allow spirits to control or alter your thoughts. The challenge is great, few will be able to pass beyond the testing grounds of this Grimoire, nor understand the translation therein. Please understand that this grimoire was not created because I felt I could produce something better than Aleister Crowley, nor a sign of disrespect for the original work. On the contrary, it is a love of the original that this edition was created. It is a partial map and record of my personal Work as one of the Luciferian Path, and something which I felt should have a new approach presented. The new presentation of this Work will no doubt open some gates which should not have been opened, or rather needed to opened for sometime. Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas – In these words, I weave this spell.. -Michael W. Ford, Dark Moon, April 1st, 2003. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 The Goetia – Ancient and Modern Considered for centuries a grimoire of “low” magic, the Goetia (loosely translated as “howling” or “wailing”) has been a tome of forbidden black magic. The 72 Spirits of Solomon were meant as a tool of cursing and empowering ones’ lusts. While this may continue to be an aspect of Lesser or Low Black Magic, the Magic of Theurgy (high sorcery) has not been a connection in detail explored – until now. Theurgy is High Magick, or High Sorcery. It is the development of the self in Light and aimed at bettering ones being on numerous levels. “Light” may refer to the perception of being, as Lucifer who is the Lord of the Sun and the Emerald Crowned Initiator of Magick. Theurgy would be the path of invoking the genius or Guardian Angel of the Self. This operation has been dealt with in length in the works of Abramelin, Aleister Crowley’s Liber Samekh and equally brilliant writings by Jake Stratton-Kent and Charles Gonzales. The “Preliminary Invocation” as it was published in Crowley’s 1904 edition, was developed from the London Papyrus 46, being a Greek Exorcism Rite which was translated by Charles Wycliffe Goodwin and published in 1852. It was indeed Aleister Crowley who asserted correctly so that the supreme ritual was the one to invoke the Holy Guardian Angel, as this led to the path of individual perfection. This is a common ground of which the Left Hand Path and the Right Hand Path practitioner may agree. The paths become clearly defined when the RHP seeks to reach spiritual perfection, then letting the consciousness be joined in union with the divine light, or the Hebrew Ain Soph, which is Limitless Light. The LHP practitioner views consciousness and being as beautiful, sacred and worth developing and strengthening. The consciousness from the unveiling of ones True Will or Daemon/Angel would seek to further become like Lucifer and be independent, isolate and separate from the Ain Soph, or Limitless Light. One should remember, it is the Limitless Light from which Azazel – Lucifer sought to be independent from. The Goetia is indeed a tough, powerful and to some a dreadful real grimoire. Those who have hissed and vibrated the sacred names and candle lit summons of the demons of this book have empowered it to heights which revival the legends of Faust and even Horror fiction author H.P. Lovecraft and his tales of the macabre. With Aleister Crowley, whom, in his youth brought forth the shades of the Goetia into Boleskine and other homes, he did so in an experiment of Will. While on the surface, he had appeared to consciously evoke the Goetic spirits to appease his carnal desires, and other material quests; subconsciously he was breaking ground for the development of the Will. The Lemegethon or Goetia as it is called is indeed a forbidden yet essential tool in magical practice. In specific areas of what is termed Sabbatic or Luciferian Sorcery and Magick, a definitive purpose is expounded in the Nature of the Goetic spirits. Magick as itself is defined to raise one up, to ascend. As Magick is a Celestial Work, which defines and strengthens the Will (or the Will strengthens Magick) so that a union be brought with the Baphometic Statements, As Above, So Below. The Goetia is a work of Black Magick. One often views Black Magic (k) in the perception of Aleister Crowley, being the malicious workings of sorcery. A modern or should I say realistic perception is"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 that Black Magick is the arte of ensorcelling the self, building and isolating the psyche. The goal is specifically a higher articulation of the soul and the Will of the individual. It is considered Black because this is the symbol of the unknown, such is a large part of the psyche and subconscious. The Black Magician is therefore one who Works on the self, building and defining the character of “I” or being. The Sorcerer is thus one who encircles energy and the spirits of the dead and the subconscious around the self; to strengthen and explore the avenues of a strong and open mind. The Black Magician also understands the respect which is necessary with working with exterior forces which often relate in an interior context. This is the key to the Goetic Sorcery path which is for this reason considered dangerous. The Path of Magick is that Godform of Lucifer, the Angel perfected. The Luciferian spirit is fire born, alive, vigorous and strong in Will and Pride. Lucifer Ascends in the Sun, and Falls with the Darkening of the Moon. This is the Path of Magick itself – AS ABOVE, SO BELOW. The Luciferian model is presented strongly in this book, as this is a gateway or key to the mind expanding and developing. No longer shall the horrid sickness of Christianity be brought down in the Goetic Work – No longer shall the weak of mind approach this tome without duress. The Walls are torn down yet they are at the same time built higher than they ever have been before. Goetic Sorcery should in itself be the grammar and foundation for the Arte of Magick, which is to ascend in the light and warmth of the Sun. In order to fully understand and perceive the Self and the Light within one must explore the Demonic or Infernal realms. They often bring swift success, and a meteoritic fall into flame – instead of the self within igniting the exterior brings fire unto the self, destroying it. Be the Flame that is the Torch of Magickal Arte. Preliminary Work As one explores and seeks to understand those deep desires which motivate, inspire and sometimes terrify us, we are building a strong blackened tower of self. This allows us to not only understand our feelings and perceptions, but the possibilities of becoming something better. The Goetia as it is a tool of darkness; it is also a tool of strengthening the self – one of fiery light. One must observe the nature of Goetic Spirits, which generally may be harmful or beneficial depending on how may approach them. In a modern context, the Magician is now able to step out of the medieval mode of summoning separately – rather the sorcerer now moves forward into the Point between the summoner and the summoned. This is the Axis of which all change, self-deification and the widdershins dance of the Adversary is accomplished and developed. One may perform rites based around the Princes of the Infernal Realm or the Sub-princes accordingly. Much of this useful information may be found in the S.L. MacGregor Mathers translated “The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage”. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 The Four Infernal Princes are- LUCIFER – East (from Lux Fero, Light Bearer. A common “Shadow” association is Lucifuge, latin for “fly the light” and may have close associations with Mephistopheles. Lucifer in this aspect is the Angel of Light, the Adversary. Lucifer is a title which is beheld by the fire djinn Azazel being the first angel, fallen from the stasis of light. By this manner, Lucifer is the liberator and developer of humanity with his gift of the Black Flame, or individualized self-perception. LEVIATHAN - West (from LVTHN, the Crooked Serpent/Dragon of the Sea. Leviathan is the Daemon of Immortality and initiation, that the Beast and Scarlet Whore moves through to arise from the Oceans as the Beast 666, the Solar Spirit of manifestation and creativity.) SATAN – South (from the root SHTN, meaning Adversary. Satan is the name associated with Azazel the Fire Djinn, who is also Lucifer and Samael. The Goat with One Thousand Names by form. Satan = Set-an, the ancient Egyptian God of Darkness, Chaos and Isolation.) Satan is the Adversary, whose symbol can be viewed as a Forked Stave which rises in the Noon-tide Sun. BELIAL – North (from BLIOL, a wicked one. Belial is the Spirit of the earth, created second after Lucifer/Azazel as a powerful Angel. Belial is a powerful daemonic and angelick spirit and initiator, and is associated with both the infernal and celestial.) The Sub-Princes are (and should be considered Shadow forms of the Infernal Princes) SAMAEL – East (being the Angel of Fire who is Azazel. Samael is the Demon prince who is married to Lilith and father of Tubal-Cain. The root word of Samael is SML, which translates “Idol or image”.) AZAEL – West (associated with Azrael, the Angel of Death or the Egyptian Anubis, the God of the Dead. Azael represents the West and the Realm of Twilight.) AZAZEL – South (associated with the element Fire, as Azazel is the Fire Djinn of Islamic Sufism. In Hebrew Azazel is the Scape Goat, associated with the root OZ, meaning Goat and Devil, sexual force.) MAHAZAEL – North (associated with Earth, being Cain or the Egyptian Set as the Lord of the Earth in Typhonian Lore. Mahazael comes from the root MHZAL, meaning to Consume and Devour and is associated with AMAIMON, a Grand Daemon.) "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 The Rite of the Coiling Dragon (Leviathan, the Crooked Serpent) The Darokin Walk of the coiling dragon is the averse trance-way of the Adversary, thus the initiate becomes as the image and essence of Shaitan through the invocation of the Four Powers under the Infernal Princes. In the coiling of this Black Light and Cunning Fire, may the sorcerer become isolated and strong against the natural order. The individual is separate, yet a fire made vessel of Azazel-Lucifer, known as Azal’ucel, the Daemonic Angel of Adversarial Awakening. Begin the rite in the Southern Quarter, relative to Azazel, the initiator of the path. The sorcerer should construct the circle of the dragon as one uses in this Goetia, encircling the self in the announced conjurations of the Four Quarters. Azazel – I summon thee Fire-Djinn of the Southern Quarter, be the torch which would ignite me, immolate me in your presence, as your child on the path of Shadow unto Light. Samael – Great Dragon transformed, I summon thee as Fulmino-Lucifer, the Morning Star of the East, the Serpent-Angel of the Emerald Crown who fell to earth – awaken now and open forth the gates of the imagination by Air and Dream. Mahazael – Father of the Witch Spirit, who blesses and curses under the hidden and bright moon, I do summon thee forth unto me, initiator of flame and iron, come thou forth unto this circle. Horned Beast and Angel perfected, Awaken to my Northern Calls of the Earth! In hearth and forest shall you walk with me; in shadowed valley shall you walk as me; in desert and mountain shall you carry my body in thy circle of being! Mahazael, incarnate within!

Open forth the path of Serpents! Open forth the path of the Dragon! Hekas! Hekau! Hekas! Working with Demonic Spirits Demonic Spirits are essential chthonic/infernal forces which are bound to and from the shadow and dark places of the earth. One should approach daemonic spirits as something other than the self. They are a testing ground; the ones who would have you face the skull containing the Waters of Leviathan, or initiation. They would have you drink deeply of the Gnosis which reveals the Luciferian Mind, that which questions and is strong within"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 it. One should not approach the Goetic spirits with fear, if the mind is clear upon the initiatory intent then this is a building point of character associated with the spirit therein. Daemonic Spirits/Djinn are the phantasms which congress and communicate with those who partake of the Infernal Sabbat, the conclave of witches and sorcerous beings of night-walking dreaming gnosis. Daemonic (Demonic) Spirits are often Fallen Angels; those who have tasted from the golden cup of the celestial realm of Lucifer, and by falling into the infernal realms have learnt the dark ways of their own sorcerous making. Such Daemonic forces are but in some ways mirrors of our self, we must gain by association and invocation. This, by this Work alone, will strengthen and develop the very self of the sorcerer, the ever changing Luciferian and Promethean Essence from which the body and mind it itself a Grand Grimoire of Shadowed Knowledge. Our soul must be enflamed as the Serpent and must work accordingly as the Devil in Flesh, the Tester of the limits and the initiator upon earth. Work always with a goal in mind and do not dabble with the Spirits of the Goetia. You have been warned. Working with Angelic Spirits Angelic(k) spirits are celestial or empyrean forces, based primarily in the element Air. They are commonly associated with Lucifer and are the higher articulated solar and lunar shadow forms of the initiatic guide, by one conjoined with the demonic spirit the self develops in balance, rather than repression and self-deception. Such Angels are fallen, and contain a Demonic or Infernal aspect to their character. Approach this with respect and seek to become like the essence you so seek. The Angelick Spirits of the Shemhamphorasch are the Guardians who lead one to the Threshold (Azazel, Shaitan). Spirits should be invoked as how Lucifer would command – by resolve and silent perception. Do not act upon impulse; rather refine your thought to work for you. Consider the higher articulation of the spirit and how this may associate with the balanced aspects of the self. In most cases the Demonic is in relation to the Angelic, a combination of Celestial and Infernal aspects. When invoking either Daemonic or Angelic spirits, one must control every thought based on the desire and Will, not to mention the impulses which may come forth. In most cases, the sorcerer will feel differently as he or she invokes the force that is the mind moves with ‘inspiration’ under the spirit summoned."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Such methods of invocation act not in mere possession in most cases, rather activates areas of perception according to the individuals associations of inspirational knowledge or impulses. Angelic Spirits are those which infuse us with the Fire of Lucifer, that which fell from Heaven. This is the gnosis of the Celestial Sabbat – knowledge gained from the Spirits of the Air. The Luciferian Spirits (the Spirits of Air) are often celestial, white shades or blackened shapes, depending on the Lower or Higher nature of their being. It is the goal of the magician to be able to in an astral sense shape shift into either an illuminated or shadowed aspect of being, as is the reflection of the being. Simplicity in Ceremonial Magick and Sorcery is significant to achieve a strong point of gnosis, or magical thought. The operator who is intent on summoning a spirit of the Goetia will be focused on this act, to where he or she identifies with the Daimon in question. To allow a clear and controlled pattern of magickal development, the sorcerer should be calm and focused before hand on a specific and Willed outcome. No individual should enter the ritual chamber to perform Ceremonial Magick while lacking a defined intent and desire. Why are you summoning the spirit? What do you wish to accomplish? How will you learn from this spirit? How will you implement the knowledge obtained from this act? How does this sharpen and define your being further? Two aspects of the self may be crystallized in the development of the Body of Light and the Body of the Shadow; this is by a simplified comparison, the heart of the Adversary. The Adversary is perpetual evolution, storm and chaos. The Light aspect of the Adversary is the Order within the Self which comes through this changing and evolving Chaos of self. The Body of Light/Body of Shadow is directly tied in with the Holy Guardian Angel/Angelic Familiar/Higher Self. The Ritual of the Holy Guardian Angel, Azal’ucel and The Invocation of the Adversary may be employed to achieve contact with this individualistic guide or Initiatic Genius. When you invoke, allow yourself to become enflame into points of ecstasy, you will grow from this. The Body of Light The Body of Light is the astral double which is used to align with the Angelic Familiar/Higher Self. This Daimon is called Azal’ucel, being the Sigillic Word combination of Lucifer + Azazel, being the Torch bearer and awakener through rebellion. The Body of Light may be developed by meditation, yoga and other acts that you may visualize a white or fiery essence which rises from your flesh; it is a beautiful brilliance of white light, the Luciferian Spirit from the Sun. Some Will this light to change into a purple – brilliance or blackened flame within the center, from which an Eye arises. The Eye would represent the Eye of Set/Shaitan, the Adversary and Immortal Genius of Self. The Azal’ucel Ritual and the Rite of the Adversary is a tool which is aimed at Willed practice to achieve contact with this Higher Self. It is used to also clear the mind and focus the self on the Work of which you will undertake.

Find a comfortable place to meditate, decorated in such which would represent the Higher Self/Daimon. Anoint the neck and arms in Abramelin Oil and have the chamber lit with natural light if possible – allowing the Sun to enter the chamber. Remember, the point is to reach the empyrean or celestial realms of the Aethyr, the Higher Consciousness of Self. While quietly meditating, envision the astral body growing, of which a great fire and light is rising above the physical body, envision and Eye within this fire. Raise yourself up in through the Aethyr, from which you are floating and rising in the sky. As you rise begin to visualize a Great Angel before you. There is a great wind which is violent and rushing about you and this Seraph. The angel is illuminated in bright light, with Eyes that are black despite the beautiful and strong continence of this being. The face is saturnine yet strong, and the aura you sense is tinctured with darkness beneath the surface. The body of the angel is almost flame, and his crown is an Emerald Brilliance. In the hand of this Angel is a Forked Staff, which is cruel looking and sharp. The Wings of this Fire Djinn are black and sharp, indicating an infernal aspect not so visible in the flames of self. As you stare into the Eyes of Azazel, called Lucifer or Azal’ucel, a lightning flash comes from his Left Eye into yours. As this flash strikes you, a voice is heard within your mind, a single question is asked. You will know this question as this moment occurs. Move yourself and your body of Light into this Angelic being, and allow your self to become engulfed in his fire. Let the eyes open in the astral plane with the eyes of Lucifer; you shall awaken in this light. Practice this frequently, until you feel an instinctual communication with this force. You are becoming in the Luciferian Light. The Body of Light is used in scrying and of tarot workings as well. Allow the self to listen to the instincts which grant you foresight, this shall be a powerful tool in all that you do in daily life. It is highly recommended to Work with the Spirits of the Goetia after you have achieved a union with the Body of Light, to confirm self-control and focused direction. The Body of Shadow The Demonic or Infernal Aspect or Body of Shadow is equally as significant in the development of the self. The Shadow is developed by meditation initially and eventually by dreaming. One should approach the Shadow as the Devil-initiatic guide, be it as Mephistopheles, Belial, Lucifuge or Shaitan. Some Luciferians invoke the shadow as the Demonic Feminine, as Lilith – Hecate or Babalon, the Crimson Mother of Succubi and the Beasts of the Earth. Some view Ahriman as correctly the Initiatic and Sorcerous Daimon of the Shadow. The Shadow is the Vampyric Guide, the shape shifting and phantom body of self. The Luciferian Path works with such Demonic Forces as Initiatic Guides, and is related directly to the self. The Shadow is significant as the Adversary as it is the Dreamin Body with sloughs off the waking physical body for the dreaming or astral plane to go forth to the Sabbat, or the darkness of night. This is the Immortal and Fiery Eye of Shadow,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 which aligned with the Body of Light, grows eternal and is able to separate from the physical body.

As this is the initiator and God form of the Path of Sorcery, Lucifer is the illuminator of the Soul, the one who allows the magician to bask in the Light of Self and view ones own reflection in the emerald crown, the very Lucifer-stone which fell to earth and remains hidden within the earth, and partially in the heart of man. This rite is designed to provide a short yet inspired Working of Invoking the Holy Guardian Angel, from which one shall seek the communion of their Higher Spirit, Genii, Daemon and True Will. As one comes into contact with the Angel-Daemon, an illuminated sense of self comes forth; a new type of being may begin to develop. The Oath of the Magician of the Luciferian Path is that of Illumination and the Great Work of Becoming. In the Workings of Goetic Sorcery, no matter if the invocations/evocations are done in the aims of Low Sorcery or High Sorcery, one should already have sought an operation of Will and the discovery of the Angel-Serpent Samael, the illuminator of the Path itself. The common logic behind this theory is that you would not take an operation without knowing where you wish to go, the plan of how you shall achieve your goal. Theurgy (High Sorcery) is the Luciferian Principle of Self-Development, the magician seeks to become like Lucifer. The Ritual Let the Sorcerer Cast a Circle about him/her, the Leviathanic – Ourobouris Circle counter clockwise, then in the same fashion, move Widdershins in your alignment with the Four Daemon Princes and SubPrinces, in your own design. Summon then with an Enflamed Mind, the Dragon-Serpent which is the Angelic Essence of the Soul, the Eye of Azal’ucel shall burn forth from the darkness to reveal the Light. The Circle itself is not a tool of keeping Spirits OUT, rather the circle is the concentration point of which the sorcerer summons forth the Energies within the Earth through Him/her self, that it is the ensorcelling of the shades and elementals of the self – the Great Arcana of the “I”, or Luciferian Being. The circle should not be considered a means of protection, the magician who would fear and cower within a circle and still seek to summon forces which he will not become ‘one’ with, is not strong enough as an individual to understand and becoming in the Magickal Art. The Isolate and Beautiful Luciferian Initiate does not fear the forces of which he summons, rather embraces and by the Will controls them. The same type of mastery must be applied to The Summoning of Goetic Spirits, no matter the intent, but with an aspect of Respect for that which you call. Understand the Shades of the Dead have walked beyond the flesh, and should be viewed as advanced spirits which brings us knowledge and initiation. When invoking/evoking Goetic Djinn, know that these fire-born spirits who fell with Lucifer-Azazel, hold too a"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 special knowledge – and the Self and individual mind is that which will commune with them.

Tools of Art THE CIRCLE The Circle is an old boundary which was used back from the eldest days of Magical practice, specifically the Sumerian word Zisurru, which is the circle drawn in flour. The flour itself is known as qemu, such aspects of primal sorcery have survived to the present age in various cultures, in Voudon practices and even Thelemic Magick, Sabbatic and Luciferian Witchcraft. The Flour Circle is not by any means a must, one may create an Ourabouris – Levianthanic Boundary which is symbolic of the Self Encircled, that fascination and self-enchantment leads to the Gates of the Infernal and Celestial Peaks of Magick Light, the awakening of ones Will and divinity. The Circle should be understood as the essence of the Self, that it is the bridge between the waking and dreaming, between the celestial and infernal, the fiery essence of the Azazel. The original circle of Solomon as redesigned by Aleister Crowley is indeed powerful in form, e.g. Ourabouric Circle, but in working with such a more Luciferian focus was needed. The Leviathan which makes the circle, is sigillized and charged essentially with the names of Luciferian power, being SABAOTH (The Lord of the Sabbat, or the Sabbatic God, associated with Zabbathi) ADONAI (The Lord of the Earth, associated with Lucifer) AZAL’UCEL (the Sigillic word formula of Azazel and Lucifer, used as the initiator or Genius of the Holy Guardian Angel Rite presented in this edition) BABALON (the Power form of the Goddess from Lilith – Hecate – AZ, the Daemonic Feminine) LILITH (The Queen of the Sabbat – the Vampyre, the Lady of the Crimson Caul, the Mother of Cain and the creator of Succubi) These names as scribed around the circle are in the Witch-Language commonly known as Theban. This provides a yet known but unseen sigillic formula not indifferent from the Alphabet of Desire, as suggested by Austin Osman Spare (See the BOOK OF PLEASURE, 93 Publishing, Quebec Canada). "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 THE EVOCATION CIRCLE/TRIANGLE In regard to the Goetic triangle of evocation, a distinction should be presented. The Three Points of the triangle refers to the Three Aspects of Hekate, being a meeting place of spirits often symbolized as the Crossroads. The historical triangle in Ceremonial Magic is the materializing point of the Daimon. While the present work explores the path of invoking such forces, the triangle itself served to unite the Demonic (Chthonic/Atavistic) with the Angelic (Celestial/Empyrean). The triangle contains in the center a circle, this is the summoning point of which Solomon was said to bind such spirits. The inside of the triangle contains the name AZAZEL, being a significant change from the traditional MICHAEL. The purpose of this is to have the circle blessed with the deific power of Azazel, who is also more commonly recognized as Lucifer. As the Sorcerer of the Left Hand Path seeks communion and a form of Antinomianian self-deification, an association of self with Azazel is thus made, a formal confirmation of the dedication of the path. It is by this self-deification that the Daimon is controlled within the circle by the focused Will of the magician, rather than a ‘holy’ force. This is a psychological approach in which the sorcerer fully relies on the Will to control the ritual, thus adding a real sense of danger to the rite. Care should be practiced however with this distinction, as the Djinn of this book are both ancient and cunning. Traditionally, the triangle should be 2 feet distant from the magic circle and three feet across. The triangle should be place towards which quarter where the spirit evoked would belong. The base of the triangle would be near the circle, the apex would point in the quarter of the spirit. It is suggested that one observes the Moon also in the operation. The names surrounding the triangle are ANAPHEAXETON, TETRAGRAMMATON and PRIMEUMATION. THE ATHAME OR BLADE OF THE WHITE HILT The White Hilt knife is the Magickal Tool of the Work of Illumination of the Angelic Guide, the Solar and Luciferian Blade of the Divine Will. The White Hilted Knife is used in such works such as Workings of the Divine Will, or Angelick – Holy Guardian Angel. The Athame is also used in circulating and visualizing light around the self – encircling the being. You will want to decorate the handle in the runes of summoning and protection, as first described in “The Key of Solomon the King” (Clavicula Salomonis), Translated by S.L. MacGregor Mathers. The Blade should be made in the hour of Mercury when in the sign of the Ram or Scorpion. You may alternatively conduct such when the Moon is Waning in a more probable time frame. When you obtain a white handled knife, roughly six inches long wait until the Moon is waning. Fill a bucket or basin with distilled and purified water and pour salt, Abramelin Oil and a few drops of your own blood. You will then wish to have a small fire which you will hold the blade over. As it is heated in the flame, envision the fires of Azazel and Hecate, purifying and blessing the blade with your divine Will. When the blade is heated, take the knife and place it in the water – "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 By the Blood I give I empower this Blade, the very knife of my Divine Will By the Moon Waxing and Waning I do receive the Fallen Stars fiery and ancient Blade of steel do I summon thee, with the fires of Azazel called Shaitan do I consecrate thee, by the flames of Hecate do I empower thee! The circle is cast in the Sabbat journey of the Celestial and Infernal – Blessed is this sacred blade – So mote it be! THE BLACK HILTED KNIFE (Evocation Dagger) The Black Hilted Knife is the blade of Barbarous Evocation, the knife dedicated to Shaitan of Midnight and Banal, the Daemonic Adversarial Blade of Lucifer, the sacred weapon of banishing and commanding – the fulgaris lightning bolt of the fallen Djinn. The Black Hilted Knife is used for making the circle and commanding the spirits into the Triangle, the sacred circle within the meeting place of spirits. The Blade may be consecrated in the hour of Saturn. As well when the moon is waning create a distilled water container and fill with blackened pepper, Hecate Oil and a few drops of your own blood. With the flame burning, hold the blade within. Envision the fires of the underworld, of Hecate-Lilith and Banal, of the Daemonic Gods below who open the gates of our own transformation. Envision the fire empowering the blade with the serpent tongue of Shaitan of Midnight, the purifier of the black handled knife. As the blade is immersed in the water, recite- By the Mysteries of the Depths, the Coiling Dragon of Old Beheld to the Gates of Leviathan By Hecate and the Skull Wreathed in Roses, which is silence and beauty I summon thee blade of steel, envenomed in the Darkness of the Earth Do become knife of the Devil’s Claw, my sacred tool of summoning Water-Daemon of the Blade be born By Banal and those of the shadowed realms- Blade be blessed! So mote it be!! THE WAND The Wand is the fiery essence of the Magician, the Will of the Work itself. Create or decorate your own Wand which shall reflect your sacred symbols and desire of your becoming. Austin Spare called these sacred letters as the Alphabet of Desire, a sigillized form of the subconscious and symbols which represent the Higher Articulation of the Self. The Luciferian Will which is self-immolated unto perfection. The Wand should be cut, painted and decorated with the specific Sigils from Ones Alphabet and done so in the Noon Tide Sun, sacred to Shaitan, the Djinn of Fire. The wand corresponds also to the Phallus, the solar vessel which spills forth the Elixir of the Sun. THE PENTACLE OF TETRAGRAMMATON The symbol of strength and conceptual imagery of the Pentacle of Solomon, the Magus who bound the Djinn of this Book. The Pentacle may be worn as a method of encircling"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 the Self in the Mask of Purity, thus remaining a symbol of the Mind in Unity with the Will. Often in evocation/invocation, spirits become points of Obsessional Belief which seem to ‘speak’ or send ‘impulses’ and ‘desires’ to the sorcerer which may be contrary to the purpose of the Ritual. The Pentacle of Solomon/Tetragrammaton is the Sigil of the Will of God (God may represent SET or the Divine Will – the Isolate Self). You may have the Pentacle of Tetragrammaton on your person, symbolic of the Will of the Rite. When one enters the Cross-Roads of Spirits you are in the Arena of Anon, the Spirits which have existed between the Aethyr and the Earth for timeless ages – the take the flesh of our desires, therefore posing a dangerous tight rope walk of obsession/possession. Consider the Strength of Will as the Guide in the Working, thus the reason for one being in direct contact with the HGA/Angel-Serpent and envenomed with the Light of Set or the Adversary. The names within the Tetragrammaton represent the power of Will that the magicians holds in the working, thus within the Pentagram which ascends towards the Luciferian realm of Air. Tetragrammaton is the formula of the Holy Guardian Angel or Higher Self/Daimon (Genius).

Abdia is to Will this spirit or Daimon to join with us in ascended union, that the Luciferian Spirit becomes in this light of the Sun or Moon.  THE VESSEL OF SOLOMON "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 This is in a modern context the Fetish or Urn which is the “home” of the spirit. It is also known as an nganga, such in the methods of primal sorcery. The magician should create or obtain such a pot or urn for which you will summon and bind such spirits to. This is traditionally symbolic to the vessel of Solomon of which he bound the 72 Djinn of the Shemhamforasch. The sorcerer who seeks to transmit the knowledge of old through their essence of being may use these vessels as a womb for the daemon of the Sun or the Moon. Upon obtaining the proper urn or pot, wash and purify the vessel for a time. Allow it to dry in the Light of Dawn until Dusk. Allow the Sun’s rays to purify the urn and prepare it to house the Great Familiars and Djinn of the Fallen Angels, who still walk in spirit among and within us. The Vessel will indeed become their binding place once they have been evoked and then bound into the pot. The most dangerous method of binding the spirits to the vessel is the “Earthenware Virgin” formula designed by Austin Osman Spare. This involves a Sexual technique of self-fascination in which the elixir is kept and buried in the vessel for some days and nights. This is an optional method which is very dangerous to the process which it is created. Vessel Preparation may continue once the pot has been cleaned. The magician will scribe the binding sigil of Solomon upon it, as this will exteriorize the force summoned to reside in this temple in the earth, which you may communicate with by dreams. It is optional for the sorcerer to add a drop of his or her own blood in the vessel to consecrate it as his own. The Sigil will be prepared on Virgin Parchment or some high quality paper. It may have a strong reinforced backing such as a piece of Leather or Toadskin (if common amphibious frogs or such inhabit an area, watch for dead ones which you may use). The Vessel itself may contain a layer of grave soil and images, perfumes or such which you associate with the Spirit. Once the Magicians summons in the evocation circle the Spirit, and then enters the point to become one with the spirit – the very essence inbetween, then the force will be Willed by concentration and enchantment (of reciting the binding"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 spell) into the vessel. If Sexual Evocation, allow the elixir to enter the vessel upon climax. If one is Working with a partner, a woman, then she may utilize both male and female sexual fluids to create and give material basis for the spirit. This is not by itself necessary; the solitary magician may conduct successfully this creation or summoning method alone. Beware the union of the fluids of the Sun and the Moon, as it leads to a strong Familiar who for the inexperienced, may cause mental stress for the magician. After the Evocation and Binding of the Spirit to the Vessel, bury it in a graveyard or some designated area by a great Tree or hidden place. It shall reside there for a period of when the Dark Moon begins and grows towards the Full Moon. You may evoke it above the burial space on those nights, envisioning it growing in strength with your Willed focus. On the Night of the Fullmoon, exhume the Vessel and in the Temple invoke the spirit through the Black Mirror of Circle, seek the inspiration of the spirit and then retire to sleep. Take notes to the dreaming communion and meeting of the force, it will guide you to the answers you seek. Do not threaten or seek to harm the spirit without purpose, but be firm and consistent in your communication. Demand fairly it conduct the purpose of its summoning. The essence of Sorcery is the focused view of Self-Enchantment. Self-Enchantment is the process of remanifesting inspiration aspects of obsessional perception, the instinctual guide which leads one to ‘automatic’ (in reference to Automatic Drawing, the subconscious unveiled) communication with the Serpent-Angel, Azal’ucel (Holy Guardian Angel/True Will) or initiatic guide. Self-Enchantment is also the directional point which is the obsessional direction of ones sorcerous path. The Path of Sorcery is the direct road built from self-enchantment and the union with the isolate core essence of being (HGA). Sorcery is the rejuvenating obsession of encircling belief into flesh. This may be understood by Austin Osman Spare’s conceptual theory of manifestation – Will-Desire-Belief, self-enchantment/obsession leads to the destruction/vampyric death of unnecessary ideals which plague the self in numerous forms. In primal cultures these dogmatic ideals manifest as self-created sickness and disease. By destroying their foundation in the mind, one may absorb their very elixir of ‘life’ and devour their ‘flesh’ as well. This is the very essence of the exorcism of the Tchod Rite of Tibetan Magic – the Rebirth of the “I” as a layered aspect of the core self or Angel-Daemon. The self adds layers of conscious – subconscious antiquity, based on conscious desire and ones surroundings. This may lead to laziness, sloth and an undisciplined Will. It is essential to undertake periodic Workings to invigorate the mind via Self-Enchantment. THE BLACK MIRROR Considered a tool of scrying and divination, the black mirror proves also a tool of contacting and communicating with Spirits and shades of the dead as well. The black mirror is made of something such as onyx or perhaps even a plate of glass painted with a rich black, for which a reflection is still obtainable. Some chaos sorcerers have created"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 black mirrors from a piece of glass with black electrical tape on the reverse side. This proves efficient and inexpensive as well as offering the same affect. That mirrors can be gateways into the realms of the dead and even Hell is no new theory. The Hebrews believed that the mirror was a gateway into the caves of Lilith and her Succubi offspring. Young women were discouraged from using mirrors for this reason, lest they become possessed by the Demoness, who will drive them to sexual acts with sleeping men. The Black Mirror is considered also a tool for Atavistic Resurgence that the demons of the mind or the lycanthropic state may be brought out by enchanting the self to open the imagination to images in the reflection. The Black Mirror in the Work of the Goetia is used as a tool to communicate with the bound spirit or familiar after initial evocation. The sorcerer who summons the Angel or Demon may bind it accordingly to the vessel, and at a later time evoke the spirit again and use the Black Mirror to visualize its form and impressions it may send. If a specific Goetic spirit is bound with the magician as a familiar/famulus, then the Black Mirror is ideal in communication. Some have used divination boards in front of black mirrors to communicate with spirits, this techniques proves a powerful gnosis to step into, as you essentially bring the astral/ghost realm into the physical plane. The mirror is used in the following way- 1. Summon the Spirit in the Evocation Circle 2. Bind the Spirit to the vessel and sigil accordingly. 3. Use the mirror to contact the spirit later after it has been bound. 4. Contact the spirit before sleep to ensure a detailed communication – if you dare. SEEKING FIRST COMMUNICATION- Once the spirit has been properly bound to the vessel, you may wish to communicate or experience the visions it may send you. Keep in mind, all of these visions may not be pleasant and if your Will is weak you have the danger of becoming obsessed with the force. Place the circle again in the chamber in the triangle – If you have made a doll or effigy to hold the spirit, place the doll in the Triangle – This is the very meeting place of spirits. Burn the incense and very few candles should be lit. The ambience of the chamber should be suitable for bringing their world into ours. RITUAL EVOCATION WITH THE BLACK MIRROR “Spirit N. I do rouse thee from the vessel, tomb of darkness. I summon and call unto thee spirit N. to arise from thy vessel and present thyself in the reflection of this mirror. Present yourself in the form of which that is known, impart upon me thy visions of the world of shadows, and that which I seek to know.” "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 The spirit should appear in the black mirror or in the darkened chamber you will feel a presence and then begin viewing images, perhaps even your own visage changing into this form. When you have viewed what you Will, thank the spirit and end the rite. If you sleep shortly afterwards, keep a journal next to you to observe the images which you may see. SEXUAL EVOCATION The Triangle is the very meeting places of spirit and sorcerer, thus is the channeling point of summoning. Place the vessel, doll or pot of which the spirit is bound – along with a copy of the sigil for focus in the evocation circle (triangle). Illuminate the chamber in low light, incense and that which is pleasant to both the magician and the spirit. Visualize the spirit growing within the vessel as you silently summon it – Begin arousing yourself with the enchantments of your own imagination. Understand this spirit is formed from you, something of a familiar and spirit you have given life to. Focus on the desire of which caused you to evoke the spirit in the first place (divination, knowledge, ect) and focus intently upon this. As you reach the climax, focus on the sigil of the spirit and allow your mind to black out (i.e. death posture) in this moment of ecstasy. After you have made this sacrifice of anointing some of the fluids on the sigil, banish (by forgetting or what technique you have created to clear the mind) and end the rite. If you have a partner in the rite, you will both focus on the spirit and not on each other rather than Willed Desire and Lust of the flesh. Concentrate on the aspects of the spirit of which you relate to it, associations, etc. When you reach a climax loose yourself in the ecstasy of union with this spirit and the moment of the orgasm and death posture. THE OTHER MAGICAL REQUISITIES The other ceremonial requisites are suggested by the Clavicula Salomonis Regis, translated by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, edited with an introduction by Aleister Crowley. The proper perfumes and incense may be burnt, and the sacred bath may be prepared. The purpose of the bath is to refresh the mind and prepare it for the Work. Mix the water with soothing bath salts and a touch of Abramelin Oil and other of your choice. Before entering the water, touch thy temples and forehead – THE ADORNATION OF THE BATH “By the Sacred Waters of Hecate and the cleansing light of Lucifer, I am to prepare for the Great Work, and my body shall be a temple of both abstinence and fornication.” After the bath and when you have robed yourself – "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 THE ADORNATION AT THE INDUING OF THE VESTMENTS- “O Set-an, Lord of the Earth, Lucifer, Lord of the Air, Hecate, Goddess of Waters and Shaitan, Lord of Flame, that I shall be wrapped in the cloak of the Wolf and encircled in the Serpents Skin, So it is Done!” The Conjurations The 72 Spirits of the Shemhamforasch “I do summon and evoke thee, O’ Spirit N. by the Flames of Azazel – the Lord of the Earth I conjure thee forth.

As it moves up you will enflame yourself more. If with a partner, they shall envision the same to materialize the spirit. Begin visualizing what this spirit looks like, feels like and what form it takes. Visualize how it speaks to you and the familiars of which it governs. As you reach climax, you ascend into the Celestial Heights of the Luciferian Sabbat – When the mind is led through the Axis of the Point of Light, the solar force of Azazel. Annoint the Sigil in the Sexual fluid of either yourself (if solitary) or both yourself and your partner. At the moment of ecstasy, you shall take the flesh of the beast and along with the Djinn – spirit, descend unto the Infernal Sabbat of the Death Posture, from which you shall emerge in the flesh of the circle. The ensorcerling of belief is significant unto the practitioner who by self-enchantment and the combination of Will-Desire-Belief, have transcended the separation of flesh and spirit. After you have consecrated the sigil, close the circle and the spirit form, while weak, will remain in essence. When the mind becomes interlocked with this force, and the sinking from ecstasy into the Infernal Sabbat of the Waking Self, then it may bring inspiration of what you seek, which shall emerge later.

INVOCATION The Sorcerer may invoke the spirit at certain points of the rite, after the Vessel has been created and the Spirit is bound to it. Initial Evocation and creation rites do not involve this process. At the moment of envisioning this force, summon it now within the sacred circle of self, call the spirit into your self, by Will alone. Some magicians have actually entered the circle, and by their enflaming of self can then possession occur. Let the spirits and shades dance within your mind, filled with the ecstasy of invocation. Control and understand the spirit, never surrender complete control. When you have reached beyond the peak of gnosis, the mind will forget the summons of the spirit and you will close the circle. You may recall this force when you are in need. This is specifically why the mentally ill or weak of mind should not conduct such workings – the self may seek to destroy itself in such a manner.
