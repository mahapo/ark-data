The exam covers topics including celestial mechanics; celestial systems; astronomical instruments; the solar system; nature and evolution; the galaxy; the universe; determining astronomical distances; and life in the universe. The exam contains approximately 87 questions to be answered in 90 minutes. The following is an outline of the content areas covered in the examination. The approximate percentage of the examination devoted to each content area is also noted. I. History of Astronomy – 9% a. Nature of science b. How scientists think and work II. Celestial Mechanics, Including Gravitation and Relativity – 5% III. Celestial Systems – 13% a. Earth and the sky b. Earth and the Moon c. Time and the calendar IV. Astronomical Instruments – 12% a. Measurement and analysis of starlight b. The electromagnetic spectrum V. The Solar System – 19% a. Contents, form, and motions b. Evolution VI. The Sun and Stars: Nature and Evolution – 17% VII. Our Galaxy: Contents and Structure – 7% VIII. The Universe: Contents, Structure, and Evolution – 10% IX. Determining Astronomical Distances – 5% X. Life in the Universe – 3% Below is a list of reference publications that were either used as a reference to create the exam, or were used as textbooks in college courses of the same or similar title at the time the test was developed. You may reference either the current edition of these titles or textbooks currently used at a local college or university for the same class title. It is recommended that you reference more than one textbook on the topics outlined in this fact sheet. You should begin by checking textbook content against the content outline provided before selecting textbooks that cover the test content from which to study. Sources for study material are suggested but not limited to the following: 1. Kaufmann, William J. Discovering the Universe. New York: Freeman, current edition. 2. Pasachoff, Jay M. Astronomy: From Earth to the Universe. Philadelphia: Saunders College Publishing, current edition. 3. Seeds, Michael. Horizons: Exploring the Universe. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, current edition. 4. Zeilik, Michael. Astronomy: The Evolving Universe. New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., current edition. 5. Current textbook used by a local college or university for a course on the subject. All test questions are in a multiple-choice format, with one correct answer and three incorrect options. These are samples of the types of questions that may appear on the exam. Other sample questions can be found in the form of practice exams by visiting our website at www.getcollegecredit.com/testprep. Questions on the test require test takers to demonstrate the following abilities. Some questions may require more than one of the abilities. Knowledge of basic facts and terms (about 45 - 50% of the examination) Understanding of concepts and principles (about 40 - 45% of the examination) Ability to apply knowledge to specific cases or issues (about 5 - 10% of the examination) "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"1.
