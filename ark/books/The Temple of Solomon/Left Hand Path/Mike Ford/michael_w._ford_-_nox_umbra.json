Presented here in the pages of this tome are the hints from which one may come into the \"knowledge of the circle\". The culture specifications are undoubtedly varied, from Egyptian to Ancient Persian to European, however this is wherein one discovers the points or as in Voudon, 'Points chorals ' or hot spaces from which certain areas of textual transmissions develop and occur. Cain as the initiator stands in the cold areas of which many would not visit, wrapping in the cloak of night - it is here you may spark a fire, sit and listen carefully to his tale. This path is dangerous, it may prove ones menial downfall. However, it is not advocating Criminal or aggressive behaviour. Nox Umbra is a spiritual work, and should be viewed as such. PRIMAL SORCERY AND VAMPIRISM Vampyrism is indeed a sinistral (left way or LHP) collection of various aspects of folklore and initiatory currents in Black Magic and Sorcery. What enables sorcery to occur in a productive or destructive aspect is the combination of Will-Desire-Belief. Vampyrism within the current of modern Witchcraft is a development from the Sabbat - the Infernal awakening of the sorcerer as a shadow-manifestation of Ahriman, the Persian- Zoroastrian sorcerous being who was evil, or adversarial chaos embodied. Black Magic has long been viewed as a self-centered and selfish area of study, which often causes obsession and destruction. This, if looked through a RHP (Right Hand Path) or Path of Disillusion (i.e. Christianity) this is accurate according to the belief structure. Keep in mind that Religious pathways such as Christianity hold no Adversarial view piont rather than the extremes of the exact opposite side- which is not a natural point of study in itself. Can the Buddhist understand Christian thinking inherently and objectively? Yes, this path allows psychologically the ability to perceive and understand other views, while still limiting material control and destroing the self in the natural order. Could Christians understand a Buddhist view point-As a majority, No. Can a LHP (Left Hand Path) practitioner understand the religious doctrine of Christianity- Yes, while most of us find subservient behaviour abhorrently disgusting. Yet Christians still view our Walk as the Opposite of what it actually is! A Luciferian loves life, seeks to strengthen it by self-perception devoid of unnecessary egotistical thought. The Sethian/Luciferian understands life is a great opportunity to Come into Being as something greater. The primal sense of dissatisfaction was with Lucifer/Azazel from the time of Heaven, having all the beauty around him was nothing without self-respect and freedom. The price was painful, and dark. Alas, in this darkness was found a light - the Black Flame of individual being. The Vampyre Sorcerer indeed loves life, and the realms of ghosts and shades, we find nourishment in their tombs and black earth. Yet when we emerge in the Light of Shaitan in the Noon Tide Sun, we can appreciate it more. We explore the dreaming Sabbat as wolf and blackened shadow, as Ahriman the Lord of Darkness - As Demon and Dragon, yet in the Dawn light we arise and face the beauty of nature. By the Antinomian path of self-deification (separation of the natural order) we are able to observe and enjoy the breathtaking world around us - the forests, the water, the night sky - all of this pleasures many take for granted. We are awake and nothing can stand in the way of that. We begin to understand who and what we are, the possibilities and the process of changing the natural order in accordance to our Will. This is the Lucifcrian and Sethian Flame of being - the Black Flame itself! There are specifically two methods Of practice in Vampyrisrn as within an initiatory context - mastery of the self and the Left Hand Path approach of Witchcraft and Sorcery. The Vampyre - initiate who seeks the union of Ahriman and the disunion with the natural-order works in the darker or adversarial spirits, what is the same as within Palo Mayombe and Petro Voodoo currents of sorcery. By entrancing the self by the methods of offbeat rhythm, the magician calls forth the Left-Handed aspects of the self, the Vampyric Famulus (Latin for familiar) whom is the shadow-drinker, the Loa of the Grave, whom has survived physical death and is not held in the limitations of flesh alone. The sorcerer by employing the technique of trance-induction by off-beat drumming creates a vortex of sound from which invocation and possesion may occur. The mark of the Cross-Road is the displaced consciousness of the sorcerer who becomes a gateway to Hell (Helan, the meeting place of sorcerers and the dead) In Luciferian and Sethanic Witchcraft, the current of vampyrism is explored through the sorcerous aspects of summoning, creating and controlling shadows and wraiths, all connected by the self. Before"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"practicing the mentally challenging and dangerous rituals and workings in this tome, please take some time to explore what you are and how you may connect with this path. Even for a Luciferian Witch, this is a thorny and treacherous road to roam. You may have certain visitors attracted by the gates you may open. Be warned. A VAMPYRIC WORKING OF SELF STUDY Decorate your temple of Working according to the vampyric path and how it perceives to you personally. In the middle of this room have a nice pillow to sit upon. Have either upon the floor a simple table or small cloth to plate a black mirror upon. Have one candle (black) behind this mirror. Place yourself on the pillow and begin a slow meditation on what you consider a vampyre spirit to be. Think about each attribute and then think of yourself in relation to it. Then hold the mirror and gaze into it. Focus and do not allow your mind to wander. Command the worlds of darkness to open to you, and then watch yourself transform. Will your flesh and astral body to change and morph into a vampyric form you hold identity with. Perceive yourself and remember it. You WILL change in time. If you find yourself frightened or if other shadow forms touch you, a feeling of weakness occurs you should banish immediately and consider not attempting this again. This may be a suggestion of your work in reference to Vampyrism and Shadow Sorcery, both of the Sabbat and the Sethanic Path of Witchcraft will strengthen you in the darkened and tomb soiled shroud of Ahriman. Come now unto his pitch arms and talons, transform in the embrace of the father and mother of the Blood Moon of Tiamat and Babalon. AHRIMANIC VAMPYRE The Ahrimanic Vampyre is one who has isolated the psyche, understanding that we are spiritual beings within flesh. We can thus control our immediate surrounding world. As we are born in darkness, we are nourished in the shadows. As we are strengthened in the Noon-Sun which is the time of Shaitan, we create darkness and shadow equally. The Ahrimanic Vampyre seeks the in-between, or Neither-Neither world of twilight, from which the shades of the dead commune with the living. The shadow may be grown, cultivated and manipulated through the Will of the Ahrimanic Sorcerer, through darkness we expand and strengthen our consciousness. It is this hidden aspect of sorcery and witchcraft which breeds the legends of evil concepts, while it is only a hint at the purpose of the Left Hand Path. This way is devoid of moralistic concepts, thus in the absolute and in the isolation from it, we are uniquely separate from all exterior forces, the very essence of Gods and Goddesses. The Ahrimanic Vampyre is one who separates the psyche from the natural order and masters the Nightside or Astral Plane within our physical world which we seek to control from within. The forms in the Nightside of which we assume (Bat. Wolf, Moth, or a hybrid of each and others) are the extensions of our Will and Desire. The Vampyre is a being which has deified itself through the antinomianian process of Death and Rebirth, one who has passed through the ancient aspects of Set and Anubis, the Guardians of the Threshold. The symbol of the Dragon known as Tiamat or Leviathan is also Ahriman, the coiled beast that is of serpent wisdom. The Dragon has fueled the myths of Dracula, the Dragon Race from Wallachia. Dracos, Draconum is the very shadow of the immortal fountain of Life, which the Vampyre seeks to bask in eternally. Remember, in Bram Stoker's immortal \"Dracula\" novel, the Prince of Vampyres is transformed not by another vampyre. but rather his own self-iniliatory work and Black Magic. Dracula itself was based from two historical figures, Vlad Dracul, whom was of a family of the Order of the Dragon, and Elizabeth Bathory, whose family crest depicted three wolf teeth surrounded by a Dragon(Leviathan, Ahriman). The history of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula has its own curious beginnings in association with folklore and historical figures. Specifically, in Dracula Was a Woman by Raymond T. McNally, Stoker had an original manuscript of the novel which was later deleted, which was published in 1807. The character Harker traveled from Munich to a isolate area from which he comes into contact with a Vampyre female named Countess Dolingen "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"For the sorcerer interested in developing the Vampyric Path, literary and folklore is highly suggested. It is through inspired magickal lore that one may develop their own form of becoming, something which may add to their own arcana of belief. In the YATUK DINOIH, the lines of Persian Sorcery and Vampyrism are close, as connected with the Adversary form of Ahriman. An early ritual described in \"Sacrifices in Greek and Roman Religion and Early Judaism\" by Royden Keith Yeikes describes a Persian blood ritual known as 'taurobolium\", which holds a connection to Mithris and the lore of the Bull. In this ritual, the practitioner slays a bull on a platform, which has many holes in the wood. The blood then pours upon the individual. Symbolically, the sacrifice of the wolf to Ahriman is symbolic only. No blood of an animal or human should ever be used. The wolves would be shadow forms created by the sorcerer who is becoming like Ahriman. The use of blood to call the dead is an old practice. The Huns lacerated themselves to allow their own blood and tears to fall upon their dead. Blood was used also in by the abbot Guibourg who poured the blood of young boys on a \"living\" altar, dedicated to the God Astaroth, living altars such as Madame de Montespan and Madame de Saint-Font. Blood and sacrifice should never be used or employed literally by an sorcerer. One should imagine or visualize, but to harm another human or animal in such an act is a vile misrepresentation of Magickal practice and the sacred nature of living beings. The Ritual of the Summoning of the Vampyric Familiar is an initiation rite of exteriorization. While the sorcerer is creating an exterior force from the interior (the self), this is a process which Austin Spare introduced from his linage within the Luciferian Mysteries. The magician creates a visual image of a vampyre shade from which is an exteriorized form of the self, an elemental of the mind. This is clearly a building point of the Will and an act of becoming. When binding the vampyre to the self and the skull, the magician then sleeps with the form in a death posture overnight, awaking to the meditations upon Shaitan in the Noon-Day Sun. This aspect reflects the self in opposition, and how a balance is necessary and healthy. During the Sleep the Vampyre Shade of the self would feed from the body in the death posture. Requirements A human skull which would have the tap detached (available from Medical Supply companies), this will be the resting place or nganga of the vampyre, which would act as a coffin or tomb. Obtain a small amount from a cemetery of burial ground, which will be the soil of which the vampyre would rest. A sigil representing the vampyre and association would be created. This maybe a sigil of Ahriman or Az, Lilith or Hecate, the Black Eagle or another such form. The back of the sigil may have printed the crest/sigil of Vlad Dracul or Countess Bathory. One may create a mask of the vampyre, which is associated to the Ahrimanic Sorcerer as well. When one prepares the skull the sigil should be placed at bottom, the soil above it and the mask above the soil. When the ritual of the Vampyre is undertaken the sigil will be consecrated and then buried beneath the soil layer. The chamber or Temple should be decorated in the elements and atmosphere of death and the tomb. The altar should have human and animal bones across the temple, symbols and decorations of death and the tomb. The altar should have red and black candles, above the altar the Eye of Varcolaci and Sigil of Algol. The sorcerer should have a grave shroud in while, along with the body painted in a corpse like appearance. Ashes may be used to cover the body. The altar itself should have centered the skull which will be the tomb of the vampyre shade. The evocation dagger and athame should be upon the altar as well. The Fetish will house a Greater Servitor or Familiar, the very aspect of the vampyric essence of being. This Vessel is a tomb for the power of the Ahrimanic Vampyre. and should be revered as such.

"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"RITUAL OF THE ENTRANCE OF THE NEPLILIMIC TOMB OF SAH The Vampyric essence is a form of the shadow of the black magician. The vampyre itself is a being whom is conscious of its essence of being, as well as its nightside powers. The sorcerer focuses upon the vampyric essence throught the shades of the dead, and the darkness and shadow is developed internally. It is visualized outside of the self to present a means of opposition, which allows the self to later realign this focus point of the mind The magician uses the imagination and Will to visualize and create the vampyric form accordingly. In the Full Moon darkness of night, when shades and the manes of the dead remain close to the earth, approach the tomb of Sah in the honor of the self, which is the mysteries of the Nephilim and Watchers, who descended into the Demonium of the Earth, to merge spirit with beast and human flesh.

The Circle design is in Three forms - naturally the number of Hecate, mother of the path. The circle from which the sorcerer stands is the binding sigil, representing black magical transformation in the circle to an isolate consciousness. One smaller circle is of NAS, the Necromantic Shade of Ahriman, the initiator unto the gates of the dead. The Third is Mitrokht, being a Vampyric shade of the Voice of command. This is the element of control the Vampyric essence brings, close to the divinity of the Nephilim, those of the Watchers who drink the blood of the land. The vampyric fetish as created by the sorcerer should be made of a human skull, animal skull or pot. One should relire to the graveyard which houses spirits which one silently communicates and senses about. Sleep for an amount of time in the grave(sunken graves are recommended, as ones body will seemingly sink into the earth with the houses of the dead; upon waking take several handfuls of grave soil which will now be your bed of making, as source for rest and from which the familiar shall reside.

One may choose to also perfume the fetish with ones own favored scent, being something so closely connected to you that a sense of crystallization may eventually occur.

One will use the magickal aspects of obsession and Will - Desire - Belief to set in motion the essence of self-transformalion, the demon emerging in flesh. The chamber should be adorned in the elements of death, of Vampyrie design with such implements, fetishes and elements of Ahriman, Lilith, Dracul or any night born ghost or image which relates therein.

INVOCATION OF THE VAMPYRE QUEEN LILITH Lilith is the mother of the Vampyrie Myth, as well as the symbol of fountainhead of the Daemonic Feminine. The Witch Queen is represented as a partial woman with beast like lower half, owl claws and a hypnotic stare. Within her caves by the Red Sea, the darkness of the earth, the gateway of the Demonum she breeds phantoms, Shades and Lilitu, sexual Daimons which cater to the sorcerers who work in her veil. The Daemonic Feminine itself is defined as instinct, the knowledge of emotion and how one may control their deepest desires. This instinct is the primal aspect of the animals of the earth, how their mind's work, the intuition, understanding, graciousness and ferociousness when the animal hunger emerges. The Vampyric and Daemonic Feminine is the point of intellect which combines and balances elegance and nobility with predatory instincts, the beast itself. It is this balance of being which allows self-improvement and introspection, ultimately to create a Self-Deified and productive God and Goddess. The Luciferian Essence is found within the eyes of Cain, the father of Witchblood, buried deep within the dark well of the watchers, from which our mind is of the deep. Leviathan the serpent guards this gateway of the arcana of sleep, from which the twilight brings the Nightside of the Immortal, those who pass the veil of the Birth Caul of Lilith through the Essence of the Adversary. The Birth Caul itseif is a vampyric reference to folklore of Europe. Called specifically the amniotic membrane, which is a birth caul which almost guarantees in European Folk Lore that one will return from the dead, is the mark of the vampyric aspect of Lilith, the death-mask of awakening towards the Nightside. The Caul itself as described by Adrien Cremene gave the following account, published in Vampires, Burial and Death by Paul Barber- \"Such an infant is born to a woman who has drunk of impure water mixed with the saliva of a demon, or to a woman who, having gone out in the night, her head bare, met a demon which gave her a red cap (coiffe) like his own, which cap causes the child to be born with a caul\". In an initiatory context which implies the connection of folklore with inspired magical practice, the Caul introduced in Ritual practice (by a blood coloured cloth, stained with menstrual blood or otherwise) is the Mark of Lilith and Cain, born unto the night within the mysteries of Vampyrism.

The Skull is also a powerful fetish which may hold the familiar shades of the dead, a projected tomb of bone which holds the gravesoil and sigilic alphabet of the self in shadow.

The face is that of a long dead corpse, streaked with blood red sigils of demonic awakening, Saturnus and other relevant symbols. Seker was known to often appear with the mask of a predatory hawk, thus his servitors wear this black and gold mask.

Coven members involved -Akhtya Seker Arimanius, Davcina and Adrian Dagon. Weather- Cloudy, stormy, very damp and gray. Algol Temple or chamber is decorated in the Necromantic and Vampyric elements attributed to the shadow aspects of Sah, the Tomb of the Hunter (Nephilim). Instruments - Human skull, rib bones (Baciph Ashara), human bone necklace in ashes, Evocation Dagger, Thigh Bone Trumpet (Kangling). Circle placed in middle of room, surrounded with the implements of death and Azrail. Incense - Frankinsense, Necromancy Oil. The main instrument of which the fetish would be consecrated further is the horned Brazilian mask of Belial. I call it such as it was made from a large bull/cow skull, clayed formed a demon visage, five horns which make an averse pentagram, a third eye and teeth made of crystals. At the top of the fetish there is a place for a large machete to be held, from which the blade is a bit rusty - held in by a back of snake skin. This has been an ongoing work to awaken the spirit within, a join in union with a new famulus bound within. Holding the Kangling, facing the West I called â \"I approach the West Gate, unto the winds of funerals of past and to come, I Summon Forth Azrael, the Angel of Death who grants the sight of beyond, the veil is thin! I Summon thee Goddess of the Crossroads, who walks with the howling of Wolves, come forth Hecate\". Phenomena and record - Became too dark to write as I worked through the ritual, two candles burned in the chamber which was sufficient light. Rain poured as I recited. Holding Evocation Dagger â \"Zrazza, Zrazza, UshaNicht, Zrazza, Umpeshu\" \"From the grave I return, Midnight and Midday, from the Black Earth I grow stronger. As the wings of the bat do I fly in spirit through the twilight dreams of others, with the eyes of the Owl do I see, with the limbs of the Wolf do I run. I summon forth the dead from their gray tombs and shadows, Hekas, Hekas, Hekas Hecate!\" \"Encircle me in your shadows ashen, and those within this circle blessed under the cloak of Azrael! \" \"I ensorcell the spirits of the ancestral dead, those who hasten to the circle chant of the Sabbat, come forth, Mighty Dead arise... We of Vampyric Birth do acknowledge thee! The veil is thin, enter this plane of waking and dreaming!\" "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"I, Akhtya Seker Arimanius:- Call forth from the grave that which walks the dream lands haunting And draining those sleeping and unawake. By my oath, signed in blood From which the sorcerous art is pledged, I do call the attendant of this mask andmy own famulus which shall reside within this very object of arte. By the sign of X do I mark thee - eyes which see beyond the veil, mouth of crystals and essence storing objects, horns of five which form the Pentagram of the Fallen Seraphs, infernal flesh formed in fire, serpent skin of stealth and wisdom, blade of Azrail's sunless domain, the very pleasures of the Necromance - I summon thee unto this vessel, rest and grow strong within it, be as with my Temple to hunt, protect and make flesh to that which I so desire. \" \"So it is done!\" Phenomena - Room grew colder, a shadow seemed to envelope us. Adrian was very happy, pointing at the skull, we then each kissed the skull in the honor of the dead, to the honor of Lilith/Hecate and Azrail. The mask/Daemon Fetish was placed back upon the wall near the altar mirror. Closed the circle and the ritual was complete. A RITUAL OF LYCANTHROPY"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Part One When one prepares for the Nocturnal essence of transformation, a decision to explore the bestial aspects of the mind may be considered. The Werewolf since medieval times (and earlier) is a most feared demonic essence, known as the Lord of the Forest. The atavistic elementals within our own flesh is a gateway of transformation, the ecstasies contained therein and our own means of developing and becoming an illuminated (hence Black Flame) Promethean being. Just as we sip at the Golden Chalice of the Luciferian Sabbat, the Sunlight essence of the Fallen Seraph, the Fire Djinn who holds the flame of self-perception, we to sip from the Skull-Cup of the Dead, of Hecate. Noctulia - Hecate is the Goddess robed in black, perched upon her shoulder a Raven. She appears before the circle, as the encirclement of our being, the Gate-Keeper of the realms of the GhostRoads and the Dead. It is Noctulia -Hecate (named also LILITH) whom we sing hymns of the night unto. The Ritual of Lycanthropy is a two part process. The first involves the making of a belt of symbolic wolf skin, and possibly obtaining a wolf, dog or coyote skull (if you had a loyal familiar as a dog which had passed, this is perhaps a wonderful way to honor it.) The altar should be decorated in the Sigils of the Beast, the sign of Hecate. The Evocation Dagger should also be upon the altar, with the coyote or dog skull in the center. The individual seeking the darkness of the werewolf must create his or her own wolf belt. This is symbolic of the belt given to the initiate by the Devil, and is made of wolf skin. In modern times, wolves are a precious and beautiful animal, which should be respected. A replacement wolf belt may be made from leather, with sigils scribed into it which hold the sigillic wisdom of the beast. If one if fortunate enough, a belt buckle with the image of the Devil may prove stimulating to the imagination. Stain your belt black as night, perfume it with the oils of Saturn, Hecate and the Moon. A mask may be made and consecrated for this process of transformation, inscribed with the sigils of the beast. Noctulia - Hecate stands before those who work in the shadow of the devil, opposition which creates change. My own work began with a belt made of leather, I had inscribed pertinent parts of the Sigillic Alphabet, along with rubbing the Oils of Saturn, Luna and Hecate within it. The belt buckle was the Head of the Devil, as Iblis the Opposer. PART ONE The first night, bath yourself and then anoint your body with the perfumes of Hecate and Saturn, cover yourself in black and hold forth a hooded robe sacred for this operation. As you enter the circle, which may be under the Dark Moon (new moon), behold the skull which has been inscribed with the sigils of Belial and Marchosias, You're your Temple area with an X, representing the Crossroads. Unto those who come to the Crossroads (known also as the Ghostroads) are inbetween the sun and the moon, from the living and the dead. Face the Altar â \"Sekah, Sekah, Zrazza Umpesha\" \"By the Hidden Light known under the Black Sun, By the prayers whispered in silence unto the blood dripping moon I summon forth the Adversary, Noctulia - Hecate, Goddess before me this night. I call forth my Lord, the Devil, whom is a shadow of my self, Just as I, isolate and individual Between the Dual Essence of Azoth, from which the Toad awaits, shall the secret gates be opened!\" \"I call upon thee, Satandar and Asentacer, I summon thee forth Phantom of Darkness, I call forth the spirit of the werewolf, beast of darkness and shadow. Send now the gray shape which makes men tremble. Sah Zrizzu usha bapesta zrazza\" Take the wolf/dog skull and use the teeth to mark the left breast with the mark of the werewolf. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"\"I mark myself with the Kiss of the Devil, that I may transform in spirit unto the Phantom shade of the night, I shall become the wolf!\" Take now the Belt, and face the altar â \"From the Devil shall this belt be given, and I shall wear with pride. Whilethe skin of the wolf and the beast is upon me, I acknowledge then that Iam of Seraph Blood, and I am of Lucifer ian Birth. I am both Light And Darkness, the essence of the Opposer within. Witness this rite of Passage NoctuliaâHecate and Lucifer, may the Devil grant me the gates of hell to open forth unto my form of the Wolf. By the Full Moon shall transformation be complete!\" Close circle. Part Two On the Eve of the Full Moon prepare your chamber for the actual transformation into the werewolf shape. This form will be with you as you sleep and when you so seek, shall the shade flesh be worn to transverse the dreaming plane. Have the Devil's Belt upon the altar, with the skull of the wolf. You shall come forth oiled in previous scents of Hecate and Saturn. \"Unparalleled Phantom of Darkness, I come forth to the crossroads this night With the blessing ofNoctulia - Hecate andAhriman I do manifest within my Temple, my being the Werewolf spirit! Just as I am Vampyre my form shall change in the night to the mighty shade of the beast I shall assume darkness in the flesh, tonight I shall become!\" Put now the mask of transformation and the wolf belt. Envision and imagine now your form changing...gray hair covering your body, your eyes changing to white and then to a predatory yellow or black, your teeth lengthening into sharp and cruel canines, your nails growing long and sharp, your ringers becoming bone thin, your face distorts and elongates into a snout, you grow taller, your flesh underneath the fur is corpse -gray... .you stand on two legs, the in-between form of a human - wolf... feel this form, mold your shadow into this shape, that in the dreaming hours when you desire, you may take this form and go forth unto the plane of the Ghost roads. \"I walk in the twilight, I am the beast noble and strong, In this the Wolfs skin I am shadow and darknes! am as Ahriman, the form of the abyss! Moyset, Herren come forth unto my being, for we are as one!\" \"Sah umpesha Zrazza masehaka Hekas!\" So it is done. THE RITUAL OF ENTERING OF BLACK EDEN A Vampyric Samhain Ritual of Becoming \"As the circle is cast, we who partake of the Varcolac Cultus of the Undead shall become something beyond, who shall embrace the animals of the earth as our sacred companions, whom in the twilight of dreaming shall assume forms which please us, and taste the Elixir of the Skull - Cup of Az, Dragon Goddess of the Abyss\" \"I summon thee by the many names of thy calling - Drakul, Lamiae, Empusae, Lilitu, Naamah, Nachtzehrer, from the many names of your Palace in the corpse roads, whom approaches with the howling of wolves, who gathers the shades from the tombs.

As I say these words I write the book of myincantations, from which those of the path may summon me unto a conclave of dreaming. Hearken my voice from the grave and remember always -I have become unto the Ghost Light ofAzrail\" Consider the Ritual of Entering Black Eden as a point of determined direction, or Willed Becoming. The Vampyric shroud is a symbol of binding one to the earth in the unnatural direction, the very Willed focus of the Left Hand Path. In the closing reference of the self in identification with both God and Goddess, Lover and Devouress, this is acknowledging the Daemonic Feminine as a strong and creative part of self. We who awake to this path are but children of Lilith, thus by identifying and self-acknowledging this point will bless the self upon a determined journey of success."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" THE CAVES OF LILITU -A Bestial Rite of Empowerment- The foundation for this working is in the Zoharic myths of Hebrew origin. The K'lifah (called Husks of Evil) is from which Lilith emerges from. Consider also the realm of husks or shells, the Qlippoth, the place of demons. The legends of Lilith portray her as having the body of a beautiful woman from head to navel, and below she is flaming fire. This is also comparable to Lilith as having the continence of beautiful maiden, and below the navel being as a beast with owl claws for feet. Babalon, the Enochian Goddess and reappearing as the Whore who rides the Beast in the Bible, is revealed as Lilith the Goddess of Fire and Beasts. It is Barbara Koltuv, Ph.D. who suggests that the knowledge of Lilith is necessary for strengthening man's ego, the shadow of the self. It is Lilith who inspires sexual dreams, creative inspiration and sensuality. The Daemonic Feminine is therefore essential to the development of man and woman. It is also the gateway to the Sabbat - the dreaming conclave of the Luciferian (Empyrean, of the Light) and Infernal. Lilith in her dark and fiery aspect is one part of the adversary, the opposing force which initiates through antinomianism and self-deification. In a work which pre-dates the Zohar, it is suggested that Lilith and Samael were born by an emanation beneath the throne of God. Their shape was an androgynous being, double-faced and thus revealed as a part of the adversary (the opposer, Shaitan). Samael, in Hebrew legend has Twelve Wings, which integrates Azazel (the Djinn of Fire, Shaitan) and Samael as Lucifer, the force related to the Noon-tide Sun. Samael is thus the Devil, one half of the adversary and the creative/solar force of the Sun. Lilith joined with Samael through Leviathan, the Great Dragon. Ashmodai was said to be another mate of Lilith, whom was said in some Hebrew legends to be two aspects of the same Goddess. The son of Lilith and Ashmodai was called Sariel, the Sword of Ashmodai. His face flames with fire. Sariel had kept a sealed book of secrets, a grimoire with words of power. The Zohar itself explains that Lilith is nourished by the water (ocean) and the South wind spreads her influence, from which places her as the Queen of Beasts. They (the Beasts) are found chanting to her in the dark of night. Lilith went forth to the desert to become the Queen of Zemargad (the desert domain), she then joined with Samael and gave birth to thousands of Liliam, Lilitu, the demon succubi who copulate with the shadow of man and woman. It was when Lilith entered the Desert and began creating demons in the caves by the Red Sea that her bestial aspect and fiery darkness of spirit emerged and grew in its coming into being. She practiced along with her children the Lilitu, sorcery and seduction, and with the sexual fluids created more succubi and demonic forms. Lilith in this aspect is our teacher and initiator of Magick and Sorcery, that by using sexual fluids and charging/consecrating talismans, we may create servitors and familiars. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Son of Samael and Lilith is Cain, the Lord of Horsemen (those who work sorcerous arts and whom spirits ride). An Alchemical working is the creation of Baphomet, or al-aswad, the Black head of Wisdom. This is a state of coming into being, of whien the torch of wisdom (the Black Flame) is illuminated and revealed within. It is a rite of passage, of when the Baphometic Spirit of Fire becomes separate from the natural order. Thus the Ritual of Infernal Union is a Black Magick working of self-empowerment and the beginning process of creating Baphomet, or Cain the Lord of Horsemen in the Sethanic/Luciferian Witchcraft Current. The work of Babalon and Lilith within an initiatory aspect is made through the alignment with the spirit of Lilith, Babalon and her children who would be your kin. By summoning and absorbing their knowledge and impulses, we become closer to Her. In Raphael Patai's \"The Hebrew Goddess\" Lilith is described as wearing jewelry and having red flaming hair. She is dressed in Scarlet and wearing thirty-nine ornaments. She seduces man and fornicates with him; finally arising presenting the demonic and beastlike essence, robed in garments of flaming fire, kills and takes his soul to Gehenna. Lilith is the tester of the path, she who would confront the weakest aspects of the human soul. Those who would not be as Set and Babalon would then be devoured and tossed into the Hell of the Natural Order. Suggested Reading: Barbara Koltuv, Ph.D \"The Book of Lilith\", Nicolas-Hays, Inc. 1986 Raphael Patai - Gates to the Old City, New York, Avon 1980 The Temple itself should be adorned in the decorations of the sabbat and reflective of the aesthetic concept of the daemonic feminine. A black mirror should be placed on the altar - this shall be the gateway from which you shall go forth and they shall come unto you. This is a ritual designed for the children of witch blood, therefore Kin of the succubi and spirits of the Qlippothic realms of wolf and vampire, shade and phantom. You may create a circle from which the spirits shall meet with you, or you may stay near a sleeping place for after the ritual. THE RISE OF THE LILITU Facing the black mirror â \"O' friend and companion of the Night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and spilt blood who wanderest in the midst of shades among thetombs, who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorgo, Mormo, Thousand Faced Moon, I open the Gates to thy realm! \" (-Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft) \"Lilith, mother of Vampyres, Mother of Harlots -patron of shades and the altar of the Infernal Sabbat -J summon thee!\" \"Vultures of the Black Earth, eaters of the dead, Allow me entry into the realm of twilight from which I shall become as my mother, Lilith\" Focus now on the mantra of LIL-KA-LITU, recite slowly and build with repetitive vibrations, taking a quick and steady breath inbetween mantra breaks. Allow your mind to focus only on the Lilitu and Succubi, not as a beautiful woman but beast - woman like, a vampyric tomb haunter who spits blood and sexual fluid. It is the Lilitu who sip of the infernal menstrual blood of Lilith - Babalon, our Witch Goddess and initiator of the path of the Red Caul-stain of Vampyric Birth. Focus this mantra as you move through the Black Mirror, noticing a great cave filled with moss and damp walls. Hear the musick of the succubi, strange and distant flutes and the rattling and rhythm of drums and bones. You enter a room which has pools of blood, before you stands a Lilitu-succubi. Envision the succubi as clawed serpent-like demoness, a face strangely beautiful yet with black eyes and teeth that are beast like. Her lower body is beast like as well, long and thick gray wolf-like hairs with bird talons as feet. Her palms and arms are covered in this hair as well, with one hand holding a skull from which she uses to hold the blood of the pool of which she resides by. The pool itself is filled with blood. As you look at the blood, you notice the reflection of your form as her and she as You. She whispers to you in hissing tones - \"Her passion, her lust, we drink and bathe in Her fornications\"... The tongue of this daemon is a snake like, slithering and black in and out of her pale and course mouth. As you face her, staring into her black eyes you both become as one. She enters you and as the emotions start flowing into one meditate on this coming into being. Feel her ecstasy, the animal hunger and predatory instincts. Keep this feeling close, and when you emerge from the rite, record your emotions and thoughts."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" When you are complete in your exploration of this cave, banish and close the rite. Keep a journal of this working and what you learned about yourself by it. This shadow form is but of you, thus you should seek a regular communion with such spirits. PRAYER OF AKHTYA Purpose of Ritual To achieve Aethyric Communication, inspiration and self-initiation through the anthropomorphic assumption of identity. Akhtya was considered an \"Evil\" sorcerer, the founder of Yatus, or Yatuk-Dinoih (witchcraft) - a guild of sorcerers who practiced black magic or adversarial rites under the direction or path of Ahriman in ancient Persia. Yatuk/Yatus is considered now a Left Hand Path approach to Witchcraft, that is by encircling the self one may achieve self-initiation into the mysteries of the Adversary, the opposition of self against the natural order. The image or archetype through which self is in awakening is the image of Ahriman, refer to the KHORDA"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"AVESTA (Book of Common Prayer) translated by James Darmesteter, from \"Sacred Books of the East\", American Edition, 1898. The ideal mind set of this ritual and any in the Yatuk Dinoih is one working with the most primordial forces of the earth. The Daevas or Demons of the Yatuk Dinoih are 'shades' of Ahriman, which may be summoned and invoked and then absorbed and communicated within a dreaming gnosis. Imagination, not only being Shaitan/Iblis as described by some areas of Sufism, is the gateway to sorcerous art. The following working is a designed, inspired working to Ahriman, through the shadows encircled by Akhtya, the sorcerer mentioned in the MADIGAN-i-FRYANO. The methods of summoning in these texts is focused and derived from High Sorcery and Greater Black Magick. If utilized, they can be made manifest through the process of Will-Desire-Belief, thus inspiring and producing inner change and development. Akhtya is considered an ancient sorcerer, by immortal essence does this spirit remain, and upon earth the vessel of Ahriman is Akhtya the enfleshed Wizard of the Left Hand Path. Instruments and Preparation Create in black cloth a circle, painted in white the triangle - or a circle with your designed 21 letters of the Sacred Alphabet of Desire. In front of the circle (facing North) a black candle (face this direction while reciting - in lore North is the location of the Gates of Hell-Arezura, in Egyptian lore North is the direction of Set) and in the South a White Candle. You may also only have the cardinal points of the circle marked with a letter of your alphabet - only a total of 4 being scribed on the circle.

THE GATES OF AREZURA This is a ritual from which the initiate opens the gates of hell, that is the meeting place of sorcerers and witches - those who travel into the darkness and flame of the Sabbat. The Gates of Arezura is the initiatory point of which \"I\" is revealed and may become. You will realize your goals, your potentials and weaknesses to emerge to one who is becoming as Ahriman. As Ahriman is a form of the Adversary in a primal sense, the darkness of being is to be explored and perceived as an extension of self. The aspect of Ahriman is as half-beast, werewolf type vampyre from. Ahriman is a spirit of darkness, whom resides in the depths of the subconscious - the Gates of Arezura. One should focus on encircling the self in these shadows, which are revealed by the Work itself. The essence of Yatus/Yatuk is the mysteries of sorcery within the self, the keys to the spirit of man. One works this type of considered Dangerous Black Magick as the self-transformation through the image of the Adversary. Akhtya is the sorcerer on earth who drinks of the graal of Ahriman and Az, serpent and wolf. This inversion leads to the strengthening of self under the activity of encircling belief into tangible form. One should prepare for the ritual of Arezura by a deep introspection, becoming aware of what you wish to achieve and become. You master the self through the entry and exploration of the Gates of Hell - it is also the meeting place of sorcerers, witches and Daevas (demons) of the fiery darkness.

Anubis, as defined by E.A. Wallis Budge in \"The Gods of the Egyptians\" presents Am Ut, the \"Dweller in the Chamber of Embalmment\" as the Opener of the North (Ap-Uat) to the realm of Set. Anubis is also called Hermanubis and Death. Heru-em-Anpu is a dual God form, which holds power in both the celestial/Luciferian and Infernal regions. This draws a close connection between the Egyptian Anubis and Grecian Triple Moon Goddess Hecate. As Anubis is the jackal headed Lord of the Dead, he presides in the West. Charles Pace (Hamara't) mentions in the \"Book of Tahuti\" that West is the direction of Water, as well as Darkness. According to his Hermetic teachings, Anubis is also Death and a God form of Necromantic power. Anpu is also a Gateway to Amethes - Amenta - Amentet. This 'underworld' is the equivalent to the Grecian Hades. This is the meeting place of spirits, where the dead gather. The word Hell derives from the Angelo-Saxon 'Helan', meaning to 'Cover' or âConceal'. The Hebrew equivalent of Hades-Amentet is Sheol, which is said to come from the root-word \"to ask\" and \"demand\". The primary inhabitants of Sheol are \"The congregation of the dead\" -Prov. 21:16 Anubis is the Son of Set and Nephthys. This Mortuary God was worshipped in such places as the Abt, the Papyrus swamps and the Lycopolis (the City of Wolves - Jackals). In the Funeral procession, Anubis received the mummy, and lays his hands upon the body in initiation and protection. In the dreaming gnosis of wither the celestial/Luciferian or Infernal Sabbat, one assumes Anubis as the Opener of the Way, the God form of Mortal (mundane) and Vampyric (immortal) rebirth. The altar should be placed in the North. The west wall should have a small table to which you may have an image of Anubis and the bones or images of the Dead. West is the gateway of which you enter and dwell, then you shall emerge in the North from the Gates of Amenta. West Holding the Anthame focus on image of Anpu and recite \"I stand at the gate of the twilight realms. I have passed as a shadow of Death yet in joy and love I shall return in flesh. O' Dweller in the chamber of embalmment I invoke theel Fill my spirit with the mysteries of the jackal and the divine, that through darkness I shall emerge as Light. Am Ut, Hekak, Sekak, Ursha umpesta Zoriodo! Dweller in the chamber of embalmment, by Holy Fire and Blackened Flame, Arise from shadows, Jackal and Wolf, son of chaos born! Surround the self in the enchantments of Death and the tomb, the Anthame should be circled around the self in widdershins, while moving envision the shades of the dead surround and move in a funnel cloud about the circle of self. You are the very spark of life they seek, that by being close to you they shall taste the Light of Set - that Hermanubis, or Death brings the dwellers of the ghost realms to the Light of his father, being Set-an. \"By the Holy Fire of the Night, which burns above the tombs of those who have life beyond, I am this vessel of both Celestial and Infernal, I am blackness and the hunger of the dead, yet I am burning with the Light of the Sun.\" \"I open forth the realm ofAmenthes that I shall walk among its dwellers and seek the communion of the Shades ofAzoth. My lips are the lips of Anpu and from it the mask is raised.\" Face now the North \"From the Darkness of the Oceans do I come forth, yet in the Night do I emerge in the realms of the Dead, Set-an, father of Chaos and strength, do bless my emergence as a Son (or Daughter) of the path of blackened fire.\""},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Envision your body separate, and you are now the mask of Anubis - your body lays within a tomb and you notice the fire of spirit within. This is the very essence of your being and you seek to observe in depth the essence. Reach into your corpse and touch this flame. Feel now the ecstasy of Self-Love and all that you are. Set comes forth and too touches this Flame, as it is his gift originally to the common clay of man under a different guise. Realize and crystallize for the moment who you are, where you wish to go and how you will get there. Suddenly, all Gods and Goddesses as you understand it, are from the Self - that the self-enchantments from Sah are a gift of the Blackened Fires of the Blacksmith called Cain, who breathes with life from Set-an. Drink from the Cup, focus upon your reflection. \"I have sunk unto the depths of the tomb, yet the flame within lives -Hail (magical name), I am awakened into the Light of Set and the knowledge of Anubis. Hail thou self, who shinestfrom the dark moon, Hail thou self, who shinest from the full moon, Hail thou self, Set-an who is the God of Immortal life and Chaos of being, Hail thou self, Anubis who is death and the gateway of the dead, Encircle me in self- love, that I may walk through the gates of the Celestial and Infernal\" Perform now the Ritual of the Triple Hermetic Circle of Hamara't.
