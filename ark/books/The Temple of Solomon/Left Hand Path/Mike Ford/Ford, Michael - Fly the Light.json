[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Fly the LightPsychonaut 75 - Text by Michael Ford (Keteb)Industrial Musick needs the original formula which it came from - Freedom and Self-Liberation. It needs something which breathes that chaotic fire and storm of creativityand aggression. Psychonaut 75 is bringing back the original methodology of apocalypticdesire and the fires which spring from such ideas.“Fly the Light” is a CD recorded by Psychonaut 75 as their most intense, profound aintricate album to date. Being recorded as a musical ritual, “Fly the Light” was structuredaround certain Cabalistic numerical values, PHI and Binaural Beats and a foundationbased around Opening or Creating Gates of Hell within the individual listener, thusthrowing open the gates of the subconscious.The name itself derives from Lucifuge, or Lucifugum, “Fly-the-light” are considered firespirits who live in the astral plane in a spirit form. Lucifuge is also the name of the Patrondevil in the Grand Grimoire, being an emissary of Lucifer the Light Bringer. In thissense, Lucifuge can be a ‘shadow’ which comes from the Above Light of Lucifer, thus aconnected force of rebellion and self- liberation.Contained on “Fly the Light” are 14 tracks, with a running time slightly over 70 minutes.Seven tracks symbolize the Beast of the Apocalypse, being the 7 headed dragon. Theremaining Seven ascend in a crooked pattern around the Tree of Daath, or the Qlippoth.This movement is thus symbolized as the Fly God, Beelzebub, as a form of theAdversary.“Fly the Light” Begins with “Alone and Divided”, an atmosphere of post-industrial chaosand the machinery of a new religion - Luciferian Youth. This album does not move in theclean and shiny future as we so often visualize, but a past of when machinery andmankind were at odds with each other, when one wished to become another by thesubconscious desire of mankind. Pounding rhythm, abrasive and chanting vocals,harmonies and disharmonies move in layers over Industrial and EBM stylized songs, withan element darkness and chaos intensely behind the surface - like a TV screen flashingimages which can only be hinted at...Binaural Beats and PHI frequencies used in the musick of P 75 are programmed aroundnumerical significance or points of Cabalistic idea, this is done by two tones being atdifferent frequencies in each ear, causing then by the difference of the number betweentones, the brainwave itself. This process can be very intense, and combined with lyric andmusical approach, can be a deprogramming and Luciferian tool of self-awakening.Psychonaut 75 encourage individuals to look at “Fly the Light” as like a grimoire itself, abook of Sonic Black Magick, and to view it as the Serpent which speaks to you, offeringa knowledge only if you have the desire to be independent and strong."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“Fly the Light” is not just a ceremony, it is movement, pumping industrial, chaos andsynthesizer driven songs layered with vocal disharmonies and distinct structures.Psychonaut 75 has created a unique sound which brings a touch of dirtiness and filth toebm and synthesizer driven industrial music. P 75 has recorded a sound which has a freestyle reminiscent of early industrial music, some songs filled with flowing structure andothers built around ritualistic concepts.Psychonaut 75 in its current manifestation as a conceptual Satanic Industrial bandprovides an interest in the depth of ideology and theory behind the surface of the songs.Founder and vocalist Michael Ford (Keteb) structured “Fly the Light” around the visionof man and woman falling into the depths of darkness (as with the Legend of Satan) todiscover the inner Fire (Black Flame) of self-consciousness and divinity, to then mutateand transform into something Godlike. This model is loosely attributed to the Averse orBlack Tree of Life known as Black Eden or the Qlippoth. Songs such as “ChaosUnveiled” and “Fleshstretcher” with their violent patterns and machine like rhythms areattributed to the Qlippothic sphere of Geburah Averse, the Demon of the Sphere isAsmoday who origins are ancient Persian as Aeshma (Demon of the Wounding Spear).The song “Angel of Prostitution II” is connected with Yesod - the Moon and the AverseSphere of Lilith, the bride of Satan who is represented of the instinctual, dark side ofhumanity. She was originally called Az and had taught the Fallen Angels how to takeform and copulate to produce ‘Dragon Children’ in some Gnostic and Manichaean text.Her divinity is Sexual Perversion, the original Priestess of Fuck and whore of theshadowed ones (the fallen angels). “Alone and Divided” is connected with Malkuth,Earth and the Demoness Naamah (meaning ‘Pleasant’), a Bride of Samael and considereda Sister of Cain according to some lore. The line of “I am no longer Abel to conceal whatI have become”, Cain is revered in Hereditary and Independent Luciferian Witchcraftcovens as the First Witch and Satanist who had joined in a covenant with the Devil inNod. In addition some initiatory grimoires present Cain as being the Son of Samael(Satan) and Lilith (through possession of Eve via the fruit given by the serpent). Cain isthus a symbol of the SELF which transforms itself through dissatisfaction.“Fly the Light” is in part a symbol of the transformation through the Seven Heads of theDragon of the Apocalypse via the Angel of Prostitution who rides the beast. The Son ofSatan is also represented as a serpent. The Dragon itself holds significance in that it is arelation to Diabolism, in Zoroastrian lore, the Avestan word ‘Devak’ means worm whichis a dragon or snake. An early form of the Antichrist, called “Zohak” and later “AzhiDahaka” is a dragon-king who had two Black and Venomous serpents on his shoulders,who emerged with the initiatory kiss of Ahriman, the Devil. “Fly the Light” represents abeginning of transformation and the Luciferian concepts of Antinomian thought.No longer should children be force fed Christian lies, bending knees to SpiritualWeakness. Bring your Young to us, a New Luciferian Youth!The world we live in is a Christian World, look at what they have brought to humanity"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"with their hypocritical self-deceit - war, murder, rape, incest, ignorance, blind faith andthe slow destruction of the planet. It is time for a new Luciferian Youth, to shape theworld in their own way by putting a new God on a Cross, a God which demands selfstudyand self- worship, not obsessions to spiritual otherness which begins outside theself. Luciferian and Satanic thought begins internally, and then moves outward."}]
