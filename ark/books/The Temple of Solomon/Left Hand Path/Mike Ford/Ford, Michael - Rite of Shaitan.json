The mind is asource of heaven and hell, from which we may align ourselves better through ritualistictools and techniques, it is the Command to Look in progress, in terms of Greater BlackMagick. Robed in crimson or black, white candles upon the altar, and upon two points:North and East representing Belial and Lucifer respectively. Black candles should be atthe point of West and South, representing Leviathan and Shaitan, the fo rce reversed ofLucifer.Holding Athame, trace the unicursal hexagram and focus:“The black of night from which I have dwelled longs for a return to the dawn, fromwhich I shall cast my eyes upon through the shadow. Let the opposites be joined as thetwilight reverses into dawn.”Form an averse pentagram, feeling the flames burn from the source of the pentagram.Examine its essence and what it means to you, this is the source of Sabbaticempowerment through the arcana of self.“Let the four Princes of the Qlippoth bless my emergence from darkness to light, thejourney to Al Dajjal, my center of being.”Facing West:“Leviathan - Master of the self from the depths of the oceans, your secrets shall walkwith me always. I am holding the flame of awakening within and shall hold this oath ofshadow and the graves of the sea shall still whisper into my ears!”Facing South:”Shaitan, Satan, who exists behind Saturn, let the fires of your manifestation be revealedin the rite of your true nature, from which all concepts of ill be forgotten and the essenceabsorbed. I call forth the shadows of flame who reside with BABALON to bless myjourney into the Light of your self.”Facing East:“Lucet, Lucifer, the source of my knowledge of self, Morning Star of wisdom andperfection. Let the light of your essence rain upon me, so that I may become of yourknowledge, from which I may become as God (Goddess) itself. From the dream of spirit,emerge!”Facing North:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“Belial, Belarion, the seraphim who would command the earth. Allow your essence tosurge through me as I stand upon the earth, your very eyes shall mirror my self. I call theeforth from the depths of the earth, give me the strength to become Belarion Al Dajjalwhen I have passed through the veil!”Imagine the Four Crowned Princes flowing within you, that you may absorb and take theknowledge of the Daemonic force to use in a positive, creative way. The baptism istherefore one of self- initiation, so thus the symbols you believed they were are theopposite. Face now and invoke Shaitan, from which you shall awake.The Sigil of Shaitan should be focused upon and a mantra be recited, vibrating the name“Shaitan”.Take now the Athame and focus upon the sigil,“Force emerged from Azoth, from which there is both the beginning and end, I do placethis oath before thee. To seek the shadows, the caverns of the earth, the dead and theirmighty arcana, come forth and bless my awakening. I call to the angelic, the highestmeaning of self, from which all light announces the birth of my being awakened, comeforth from the light of dawn.”“I am the source of Light and Darkness, from which the Peacock Feathers grow.From my essence is the flow of time, the current of life and light.Such shall be hidden and not revealed to the profane, their eyes shut in the forgottenshadows of unbecoming.I speak the words of Darkness as being Zazas, Zazas, Natsatanada Zazas, the secret oathof opening the abyss, these are my words of Manifestation! I create therefore!”“The Dragon which coils in the darkness shall walk with my spirit, while I shall cultivatethe light of dawn from which wisdom springs.The green of the earth is fed from the blood of wolves and the living, from which greatsecrets find their way to my ears. So it shall be!”“Shaitan I am, shadow and light. Let the voices fill with my joyous awakening!”So it is done."}]
