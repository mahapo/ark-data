[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"From a post made in response to questions from theCasting the Circle (Luciferian version).By Michael FordLucifer is East, presiding as the morning star. I have detailed specific descriptions andelements within my Shades of Algol AND the booklet \"Sabbatic Sorcery\". The actualSIGIL of Lucifer is defined in meaning through initiation.Leviathan is generally presiding within the West, however I chose to address the obviousother areas of each prince. You have heard the term \"Nothing is what it seems\", well eachCrown Prince in relation to our subconscious seems to bring forth different elements ofits nature. For instance, you think of Leviathan as a water associated element (which IT isessentially) however it does draw influences of a specific Earth based \"swallowing ofsouls\", meaning Leviathan becomes essentially the Dweller of the Threshold for ourconsistancy of developing Earth Mastery, it becomes WATER (subconscious,unconscious psyche) to EARTH (the commanding of the elements, or the Witch Queen orKing as the Crowned avatar).Shaitan is behind primarily to present a varied opinion of the Opposer, which isessentially the Shadow of Lucifer itself. It is also known as Noctifer, the Bringer ofNight. This is where the balance of the Demonic comes into fruitation, from which wemay not only manifest according to our controlled desire, but also the functions of anawakened mind. Luciferian Witchcraft demands a Hedge Riding ability along with thedetailed awakening of both the Angelick and Demonic. Shaitan would represent theelement of Water within this aspect, and Water to Air represents the dual LuciferianGnosis of Witchcraft embedded through the individual awakening the sorcerous intent, toBECOME.Belial represents in this aspect FIRE, being manifestation, creation and destruction. Fireis generally Satan, or Shaitan which I am not attempting to alter beyond a means ofcontrolling the elements within ones natural ability. Fire with Earth represents successwithin ones individual life, and to achieve goals. Belial is also the other name of theBeast 666, John Whiteside Parsons understood this when he adopted the titleBELARION Armilusss Al Dajjal Antichrist in the late 40's and early 50s before hisdeath. The Sun essentially, equaled to Abraxas, father Sun, must be sought in it'sopposite. Belial is the Angel of awakening inspiration and the ability to make its Willflesh, a kin to Lucifer.The Angels mentioned in the rite are Enochian, with specific elements connected withthem. Those who research that will discover a useful gem within that context."}]
