Vampirism is a nameless faith, found in the forge of the first murderer, whose thirst for life was greater than God itself. The Vampire as myth is a symbol of our dark desires, our wish to devour and compel to our Will alone. Vampirism is absorbing the spiritual and mental energy of humanity, that which we wish to leave behind. Vampirism is essentially Luciferianism, those who are Sethian (Of the Adversary – the Egyptian Set) Ahrimanist or Satanist. It is not a fringe belief, but a distinct mental reality. It is a way of thinking, being and motivating towards goals. It is also a personal religious focus on the path of Ahriman, the Black Dragon.” – Akhtya Seker Arimanius, Magister of The Black Order of the Dragon. The Black Order of the Dragon is not within any conventional representation of the vampire; that is we do not pretend to adhere to the conventional myth of vampirism as being an absolute. BOTD is a guild based on the predatory foundations of strength – will, desire and the combination of belief which creates a new way of thinking. Do not expect some sort of ‘gothicesque’ vampire philosophy, our philosophy is found behind the images of vampires, behind the worldwide myths, the very image of Ahriman and Az. The Vampire seeks to encircle his or her psyche in the womb of the Dragon, to become something more than they previously are. The dragon is the knowledge of self, but the eternal changing possibility of self. By this means, the Dragon is indeed the father of lies; its word is ever"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3changing and becoming. While the word lie represents falsehood, it must be understood there is no truth and nothing remains permanent. Do you not realize one who stands for something on some level has weakness, the Church which lectures all on the importance of their divinity, the murder of spirit and repression yet also has abuse going on within its corridors? How can one recognize any solid perception of truth? Humanity seeks eternally a safety net; a God to believe will save their souls, all the while sending tsunamis, hurricanes, blizzards, and all conceivable disasters upon its own creation. Would this be a spirit you would open your arms to? Does it help you to know that while you sleep, your dreams grow heavy with the failures and shortcomings of a world around you? The Iron Age is here, Kali is awakened and she is very thirsty. Mediocrity has always been accepted, yet by it being perceived and related to, it is consumed and considered acceptable. Remind yourself of the so-called American “slacker” generation, the wonderful nineteen nineties, when if being a college student, it was smiled upon to be someone who continually seeks to underachieve. Is this a highlight of our culture? We live in a world which views a natural disaster yet still finds a way to blame “someone”. We did not do enough to warn them, we did not help fast enough, everyone should have moved faster? Why is this? That nature devours and cleanses a bit of the earth, actually a small fraction we must rush to blame others? Nature dictates survival; this life is the only flesh you will have. Make the best of it. How can one make the best of their life? How does one find the strength to mutate into something else? What is a Luciferian, a Satanist, a Vampire. Here, I will attempt to describe the essence, what you will find in those BORN into this path. Those who understand the beauty in destruction and creation. Those who balance spiritual hope, desire and equal it with their creative Will to become and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4manifest their wishes on earth. This short tome will be hated; humans hate the idea of something better or the possibility of self improvement. Save it for a new year some will say, “This year I will lose weight”, “this year I will finish this project”, you hear the sheep sound this off. Yet they always fall into the possibility which they strive for – failure. It must be considered that Ahriman and Az are not man made. Gods are anthropomorphic images but the essence was NOT created by man. This essence has existed before us; it is a guiding and balancing force in the universe. It is the Black Hole, the very devouring and space warping vacuum which changes all. If you invoke the Serpent within, you will change, you will become something better or worse depending on your mental strength. I have seen a student who showed much promise, yet did not control and develop the beast within and soon murdered another for lesser reasons. Did he hold the thirst which Cain had, to have his brothers blood spilt and to enjoy the music of its death? A Luciferian is able to balance the beast with the angelic or higher perception of self – we can perceive a better being within, thus we should Will it to be by practice and discipline. Do I regret that this student failed? Never, regret is the accomplice to failure and creative negativity. \"Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman--a rope over an abyss... What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end: what can be loved in man is that he is an overture and a going under...” - Nietzsche's Thus spoke Zarathustra Nietzsche’s perspective of man being held within its eternal struggle for both failure and ascension is best described here. We can also from an initiatory perspective understand the ideology behind the Adversary/Opposer formula. The Adversary is both Beast and Angel, it is our possibility of both perceived good and evil. The Luciferian understands there is not good or evil, there is the thirst for continued existence and the possibility of our desire. Do not seek for a world beyond, it will come soon enough. Master what is here now!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5“The most valuable intuitions are the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are those which determine methods. All the methods, all the principles of the scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of the most profound contempt; if a man inclined to them he was excluded from the society of \"decent\" people--he passed as \"an enemy of God,\" as a scoffer at the truth, as one \"possessed.\" - THE ANTICHRIST by Friedrich Nietzsche We are children of the Dragon, the sons and daughters of the Dajjal, the Beast. We are made this by the desire to become, to master and will our desires flesh. The leaders of the world all think in these terms, mostly secretly. Do not believe that any leader believes in truth, all is a lie and we may only temporarily make our desires flesh. As it changes, the world expands around us, by the techniques we have developed to achieve our desires, solidify our means of manifestation, or success. The Children of the Dragon – Predatory Spirituality “And of dragons there is that too, through whom there is so much evil knowledge that it perpetrates injury just like sinners.” – The Greater Bundahishn Predatory Spiritualism is a process of devourment, spiritual mastery and the Will made Flesh. Here the Yatus or Pairikas (Sorcerer or Witch) have shed the flesh of mortal thinking into the blackened depths of Azhi-Dahaka, the Son of Ahriman, the consort of Az-Lilith, the Scarlet Whore and mother of vampires. Here, there is no turning back – this is the circle of Satan, the Devil’s path made flesh in you. As written before, we open now the Drujo Demana, Arezura, the very Gates of Hell. Before you is the Dragon – shall you flinch before this beast then your mind will be destroyed. If you recognize your true nature, that which guided you here, shall then you be welcomed into the Halls of the Infernal. The initiatory purpose of the Black Order of the Dragon is to use the archetypes, symbols and myths of folklore – if pleasing to our imagination – to be used in methods of becoming like these spirits. BOTD initiates practice actual magick, we are seeking ourselves as"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6independent manifestations of Ahriman, thus as the Avesta and other ancient tomes would describe our purpose, as Daevas (demons). Vampires look upon their personal being as GODS, the humanistic concepts of mortals do not guide us in anyway either as it defines within the initiatory context of the circle. To become Wamphyri, the individual must tear away all strains and weaknesses they have picked up since their first birth. In this however, we operate under the Laws of Society and resent all illegal acts – those who may be aligned with the BOTD who adhere to illegal acts will be banished permanently. “The old God, wholly \"spirit,\" wholly the high-priest, wholly perfect, is promenading his garden: he is bored and trying to kill time. Against boredom even gods struggle in vain. What does he do? He creates man--man is entertaining. . . But then he notices that man is also bored. God's pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises knows no bounds: so he forthwith creates other animals. God's first mistake: to man these other animals were not entertaining--he sought dominion over them; he did not want to be an \"animal\" himself.--So God created woman. In the act he brought boredom to an end--and also many other things! Woman was the second mistake of God.--\"Woman, at bottom, is a serpent, Heva\"--every priest knows that; \"from woman comes every evil in the world\"--every priest knows that, too. Ergo, she is also to blame for science. . . It was through woman that man learned to taste of the tree of knowledge.” - THE ANTICHRIST by Friedrich Nietzsche God thus devours and creates anew, thus so do we! Woman is the compliment, the equal to man. She challenges, sometimes dominates, stirs and acts as a muse to man. Lilith is the compliment to Samael, Az is the devouring force which drives Ahriman. Just as woman is an external force, all men and women hold the feminine within themselves as well. The Great Work as described in Luciferian Witchcraft and Liber HVHI is indeed the work of uniting Samael and Lilith within, the coiling of the serpent to beget Cain, the Self. For most involved with BOTD, a parallel with traditional Satanism/Luciferian Sorcery should be observed. If traditional Satanism defines pushing limits, going beyond what is morally \"right\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7and \"wrong\", \"good\" and \"evil\", as well as the mastery of Sorcery and Magick via the Luciferian Edition of the Goetia, Yatuk Dinoih, Liber HVHI, Paitisha, Nox Umbra and other titles, building a superior, elite character then Vampyrism can be seen as an extension of the path of traditional Satanism. That which does not progress, perishes! This is very true and realistic. Any initiate interested in the BOTD will be introduced into a very harsh will training and Alchemical change process. This process is achieved individually, as you will be within your own circle of created arte. No longer shall you look to a group for approval, rather the Daevas and Druj speak through your flesh and shadow within the circle. The Yatus and Pairikas do not need to drink human or animal blood – rather focus the mind towards absorbing spiritual energy – the very soul of the victim. There is no physical harm, nor aggressive behavior. The mind must be the temple for this alchemical predatory process to begin and end. Our minds make flesh according to our desires. The initiate will learn to set his/her mind from the individual human and realize ALL progressive change and evolution is caused by him/her ALONE! The Luciferian IS a god his or her self, a manifestation of Ahriman, thus a Daeva or demon god. The Luciferian realizes that ALL other humans who are not among his/her rank or kin are prey and pawns. Spiritual energy is mentally drained from people through astral contact, as well as clairvoyance among others. The powers of astral hunting through dream and drinking the spiritual blood is ONLY best described through the experience itself. The symbol of the vampyre who drinks blood from sleeping humans (Opfers) is not far removed from the astral vampyre predator - Known as Varcolaci - who drains lifeforce from the sleeping humans astral body. The initiate also focuses via dream control shape shifting and recording"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8dreaming events in a magical journal, this defines the imagination in its strength and weakness. Can this be real, this is based upon discipline and belief. What would be the purpose of investing belief in such a concept? By acknowledging and affirm a concept as a reality do we make this thing a reality, it creates a foundation or view of thought within the mind. By continually striving for self-mastery and predatory spirituality, we become a part of the force we call the Dragon. It answers through us. Through the nightside, the Luciferian through will and practice, can shiftshape, to hunt amoung the shadows. The forms can be several, Varcolaci (a form of demonic bat-wolf and dragon resemblance), to wolf and bat. This is a mental discipline of utilizing the imagination according to ones desire, thus a high potential for magical development. Please refer to the foundations of the Luciferian Path as the gateway to the mind – the imagination being considered “Iblis” or Satan, thus Angra Mainyu. Angra Mainyu – The Doctrine of the Adversary Within the Luciferian Doctrines of predatory spirituality, the nature of the Adept is to master this world in which we live in. There is no desire for the other which detracts from the mastery of the physical, rather a careful balance. Luciferians are by all account spiritual in nature, by sorcery we encircle our desire and belief through gnosis, utilize meditation techniques and aethyrs within the subconscious. By all these things, we never abandon the physical or the realities of our existence. The spirit of Angra Mainyu = Ahriman, is darkness and shadow. Luciferians are deeply involved in the methods of sorcery and their own brands of witchcraft. Darkness and shadow is expanded by the brightness of our illumination, thus wisdom begets darkness. One aspect of the Black Order of the Dragon is to illuminate this light within each Adept, to compliment an independent and ‘opposer’ type"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9of individual. By all accounts the BOTD is indeed a Black School – lessons are given in darkness, there is no visible master yet under this scope of study does the shadow cast down upon the ground in which the Adept treads. Knowledge of the enemy is essential. The Luciferian must study the ways of the enemy – monotheistic Right Hand Path religions – Christianity, et al. Such belief indoctrinates the weak and ignorant, thus should be kept out of the mind entirely, save it poison you to spiritual death. If anything, the Luciferian should seek to devour the very essence of the Tribal Christian God, to drink deep of its knowledge of war, chaos, natural disaster, disease. If you compare the realities of our world with the Christian concept, their God is dormant. Please take your attention to “Luciferian Witchcraft” and specifically the Yatuk Dinoih. The Ten Precepts of Zohak and the Ten Adominations of Akht – Jadu display therein the very foundation of this work, the Luciferian Path and the key to the gates of hell and heaven. Heaven and Hell are indeed spiritual realities, yet also physical sensations. By achieving and devouring we may reach the heights of both, which equally are powerful. Remember the deific force of Ahriman, so sought to break open the gates of heaven and devour his brother Ahura Mazda, the Sun. Morals – Morality changes based on culture and time. What is amoral now will not be 50 years from now. Do not harm those who have not crossed you, respect animals and children as both hold a strong sense of honesty. Guilt – If you think through an action, and are compelled to take it – feel no guilt. Guilt is an emotion which drains your energy as well as creates other mistakes in its wake. Reject guilt, it is an emotion of feeble minded, knee bending Christians. Know Thyself – see to know yourself, in every way. Study your strengths, weaknesses and seek to develop and master both. Do not"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10ignore that which you dislike about you, confront it and master it. Self-knowledge becomes self-love and allows you to become a stronger being. Think before you act! Know your enemy – learn about that which you despise, know it’s workings, purpose and point of view. This will aid you always in confrontation. Love and compassion must be guarded, never love something which poses danger for you. Build the energy within through discipline, will and self-love. Utilize methods which can be as a tool for your becoming. The elements of Luciferian and Ahrimanic Mastery with regards to the Soul are follows. The Dragon The dragon is related to the advanced higher Will of man and woman, it is the Daemon which guides and translates into instinct, it is the hunger to become and know more, it is the voice of strength in rapt meditation. The Dragon is a powerful form of both Samael (Lucifer or Ahriman) and Lilith (Az or Jahi), it is both black and red, the very Flame of Being itself. This Dragon is what separates us from others. This Dragon is shaped by the mirror of our soul, the very core essence of our being. By the Great Work contain in Luciferian Witchcraft, Liber HVHI and other ritual workings I can attest that Ahriman (Lucifer) and Lilith (Az) entwine to the level and depth of what your soul may allow. The Beast is the first level, Chioa as it is called in Liber HVHI, the union of the whore and the dragon, wherein Cain (the self awakened) may be found. This beast is the instinct, the desire and raw demonic hunger to become. Although in initiation, you will develop and become more articulate, never bury this Beast, rather control it and unleash it when you need to, use it as an energy source in which to drive your desires. Allow the Beast to exist and grow more powerful based on your higher desires. Thus, the Holy Guardian Angel, the very Blackened Fire encircled Luciferian Daemon may hold the very chain of the wolf, the beast"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11and allow it to be unchained at the moments of when it is necessary. The Beast holds the very drive which you shall further become according to your desires. The Dragon is further a manifestation of Legion, the very Gates of Hell. Herein you find all of that which you are, what you want to be and what you must do to achieve this. The Dragon is a form of Set, the Lord of Chaos, thus your Daemon and Soul is the very Ordered spirit which controls this chaos and transforms it into Order. Lilith – Mother of Witchcraft The bride of Samael and the very inspiration of Ahriman, Lilith is a force which is breathing within us all. Lilith is the dark primal instinct which allows us to kill and devour, to dominate and master. She is also the instinct of self-sufficiency, to be able to rely only upon the self; to test and to become stronger with knowledge. Lilith holds mastery over the beasts of the earth, she listens to them. Lilith holds the power over the element air. The Adept realizes the significance of the element Air as being dream projection, cursing and commanding flesh (spells and using the Eyes to command presence). The Black Cup offered to the lips of the Yatus/Pairikas is the unbridled chaos found in the feminine current, the red serpent itself. The menstrual flow which is Az, the very gnosis of deep and dark sexuality, shapeshifting and violent intercourse and bloodletting. Az is the very current flow which guides us to the path of the Dragon, Az is that which awakens Ahriman, which stirs his imagination thus awakening the harbinger of darkness itself. To see through the Eye of Az is to behold the material and spiritual power of Ahriman. Goals and Purpose of the BOTD The aims and goals of the Black Order of the Dragon since it’s beginnings in 1993-94 have remained thus:"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12To control and develop of consciousness, thus our inverse/forbidden magick and sorcery. This includes the magic of the astral plane (Ahriman and Az) and earth bound one (Aeshma). Sorcery is the art of encircling energy and focusing the mind towards subjective results, to achieve what we desire most. This involves also the challenge and hardship of initiation, to seek always to become something more. The Dragon itself is hidden in the darkness of the subconscious, the dread filled, fearful thoughts within the mind. Humans who walk within the waking world want you to dive into Oblivion, self-death from the affirmation of anthropomorphic knee-bending. The Dragon (A Founding Brother Nachzehrer compared the dragon to the “Dragon of Revelations to some point) is indeed the essence of darkness in an anthropomorphic form. Tiamat is Chaos, the very blood passed to us from her Lover. The Varcolaci Pentagram, called the Devilcosm also, is a representation of the Vampire Bat and the predatory wraith, the shades of the flesh which make form. Vampyrism is a working and realistic form of sorcery, it is the interplay of the world of dream into flesh, thus the mastery of our own worlds. From this very foundation, the initiate should begin studying the following grimoires at their own pace, allowing for inspired interpretations to be considered. Nox Umbra/Luciferian Witchcraft – presents a cipher to the art of Yatukan Sorcery, this is vampiric in essence because it is a display of the adversarial mind and tapping into powers considered ‘forbidden’. The Ahrimanic Vampyre description displays the very concept of which the Black Order of the Dragon was founded upon. The illustration of the 7 headed Dragon, the Beast of the Apocalypse is the anthropomorphic image of the Antichrist, of the very essence of Shaitan the Adversary. Here we find conceptual opposition of the values which were founded to serve Christianity and Islam, that is servitude, monotheistic knee bending worship, self-denial, self-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13loathing, suffering for the release of spirit and more mind numbing sickness. To worship a sheep herding carpenter who suggests laying down before an enemy is one of the most absurd ideologies every perceived, yet is the most followed. Can this perhaps openly present the intelligence of the masses? Is this the ideal humanity? Yet resist this beast within and what happens? Look at the wars today – genocide, beheadings, and destructive activity. Yet, Western culture does little to make any sort of stand or seek to find solutions. We barter, negotiate and complain. Does a culture which beholds either Christian or Islamic values in practice suggest a healthy outlook? Look at the world around you for this answer. The Ahrimanic Vampyre or Luciferian seeks to walk behind these scenes, seeking no political union, no lie filled policy nor a religious servitude which breeds ignorance. A Luciferian is focused on self-realized goals and is willing to stop at nothing to become something better. The Binding of Chains – The Vampyric Rite of Transformation is essential in the beginning of sorcerous self-deification, the mind set of the Adversary. Thus it must be clearly understood, the path of the Luciferian, the Satanist, or if you prefer, Vampyre is not one of servitude. You must become the Alpha and Omega of your being, the very circle itself. You are the first of the Witch Blood, that heritage of Samael and Lilith, you must walk the circumference of your circle alone. Question everything. Discipline Discipline is essential in any act which demands control – and the ability to maintain it. As presented in Luciferian Witchcraft, all tools are useless unless the practitioner has developed his or her self to being able to control and discipline thoughts, actions and to simply lay the grounds for the manifestation of their desire. All of this requires patience and above all resolution not to give up when something gets difficult."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14Mastery of Discomfort The Luciferian must understand various levels of thought, perceptives without necessarily adopting and identifying with them. The Luciferian understands pain and hardship being an element to use as a tool of strengthening the Mind and Will. Rather than focusing on the pain, ignore it by not identifying with it. This is the opposite of the methods of ritual where belief is invested. Instead of identifying the Luciferian ignores pain from such a self-perceptive experience and use such to build an unflinching Will. \"The Moon Drips of Blood: The Wolf (Varcolaci)” (A Raven and Serpent Masquerade excerpt by Peter Nachtgeist and Michael Ford - Nachttoter) The wolf represents the moon and the strength which flows from its light. The feelings and emotions awakened in the heart of the predator by the glowing and enveloping fullmoon, are in nature similar to the dark, mysterious moods that the sound of howling wolves inspires. We, Vampyres, predators of humans - visualize ourselves as the darkness of nature, nature unveiled. Strong, pure and beautiful. - When the night cloaks my thoughts, and by darkness I'm embraced, when the mist is colored red, and the moon drips of blood, when the chill bites my skin, and I ride the winds of Death, when the shadows haunt the night I lust for my nightly sip..

The scorpion is strength and honor - love and life - It is also the harvester of Death. The Raven represents the darkness that cloaks out spirits. The Raven seems to paint pictures of plague, death and misery. The Raven of us is our nature and being. We are of the night. The Raven is the initiatory veil which guides us to the Eye of Akoman, the very manifestation of darkness and the antinomian mind. When this veil is lifted, there is no absolute good or evil, there is survival and the manifestation of ones natural laws of living. From the Flesh to Spirit From the lands of Transylvania and what is now Romania and Hungary comes the Astral vampire known as Varcolaci. The Varcolaci is said to during the night hours, rise from their physical form and under the cover of shadows, ascend towards the nocturnal sky and drink blood from the moon. Varcolaci is known to appear as a wolf with many mouths, a small dragon or a blackened shape of a demonic winged ghost, filled with an aura of death and lust. In the folklore of Transylvania Varcolaci can travel in several ways: When a woman spins thread alone in the darkness, she may create an astral thread in which the Varcolaci may rise into the sky to devour the moon. Often, the thread would be spun from the accumulated dust and dirt towards the sun and moon, the woman would be covered in blood and continue to spin. She would then have completed the bridge for Varcolaci, therein to wander the dark portals of the cosmos to attack the heavenly bodies. The reality of Varcolaci is so very true. A Vampire is also in fact Varcolaci, once the discipline of Astral Traveling is Achieved, then"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16Varcolaci is able to develop and rise as a demon of great power. This is the path of immortality, of predator and prey. While our kind does not exercise just the rising of Varcolaci as it's primary discipline of vampyrism, the condition and exercise of Astral hunting is very important towards the developing of the Vampyric Godhead, in which under the control of 77 all is possible within Will. Varcolaci is usually soil based, during the waking hours the Vampyr will walk the earth. When the time for physical rest comes, the Vampyr will then leave his physical body. During this the vampyr is able to shape shift at will. The Varcolaci will rise especially when the moon turns a blood red or copper color. The dark spirits will then drink astral blood from either the moon, stars, or the sleeping opfer. Remember, the dream is reality and all is formed within the dream.

They call astral vampyrism \"wrong\" and unnatural. Is it unnatural for the wolf to devour its prey? Is it unnatural for man to kill cattle and other animals for food? An absurd notion for an individual to deny her/his true nature, thus never deny that humans are by instinct predators. Acknowledge this and develop this to become something better. The Ahrimanist/Luciferian looks upon astral travel as a time of meeting with other Daevas who have taken to ascending the human condition. Varcolaci will roam the night and drink from sleeping (i.e..unaware) humans who are sacrificing their own spirit to a God of silent death, the one called Yahweh, who is the herding deity of a dying age. It is, during these times that the Ahrimanist/Luciferian may shape shift into any form according to predilection during ritual/meditation and dreaming cycles. This is not escapism or a fantasy unfulfilled, rather it is a progressive ritual focus of motivating the mind to accept the reality of something better than present state, to exist within the Coils of the Dragon (immortality – represented as Leviathan) and the mind crowned as Druj. The Varcolaci form is always usually different from vampyre1 to vampyre. Some often resemble the demonic shadows of the Varcolaci - Wamphyri pentagram, while some are more wolf-like. The form is according to will and can change when desired. Some will travel and feed from prey in desired beautiful forms, as white and flowing beings or as ghastly wraiths. Astral projection is a several step system of meditation and control. To properly meditate and enter the mindset of astral projections, one must prepare the home or place of this practice in a quiet manner.   1 Vampyre is a Western term used in the context of the Luciferian as the state of a Spiritual Predator of devouring and absorbing antinomian being."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20Take the phone off the hook, turn the TV off, and make sure distractions will be to a minimum.

All elements of ritual are subjective, even the symbols themselves – but once you have consecrated them, they take a life of their own.

The second part of the grimoire is based on the ritualistic inversions of the Avestan texts and the forbidden path of Predatory Spiritualism.

LIBER HVHI is a grimoire written from ancient religious texts such as the Avesta and various Cabbalistic writings. The result is a powerful Luciferian ideology and methodology of ritual and daily-life practice which transforms the mind into the Spirit of the Adversary. LIBER HVHI: EXPLORING THE MIND OF THE ADVERSARY Liber HVHI explores the Qlippothic Spheres, Ritual Sorcery based on the ancient cults mentioned in the Avesta of Yatuvidah, daeva-yasna (demon-worshippers) persecuted by the Zoroastrians.

Beginning with an inversion of the Catholic Rite to instead practice “exorcism”, the inverted and created rite is aimed at “Possession” or liberating the shadow self into a viable, productive focus. The 22 cells of the Qlippoth along with the infernal spheres are presented as valuable aspects of strengthening consciousness and creating an attitude of winning and self-deification.
