The symbol of Set the Adversary shall take the earthen form of the Devil, the solar creative (and destructive) force of change and self-deification.There are two primary faces of the Adversary. The celebrant may construct as mask of two sides, which shall be placed upon the center of the altar.One- The Fallen Seraph Lucifer, the angelick essence of the Black Flame, the very source of our wisdom, being and becoming.Two – The Seraph of Flame, the Djinn Iblis of Fire, Daemon of the Blackened Flame, serpent – beast – dragon – wolf – goat. Satanas is the devil-cloaked initiator of the path of the wise, those who laugh at the warnings of a cringing society.Robe thyself in crimson, the color of flame and movement. The symbol of the averse pentagram, being downward pointing to indicate the union of the fallen angels with humanity to create divinity. In the Sethian Witchcraft Current the sorcerer becomes as SET him/herself, thus in the circle the first of Witchblood unto the path.UPON THE HOUR OF NOON-Invocation of the Djinn of FireYa!

While the rite is called for as one being conducted at both Noon and Midnight, the sorcerer may choose to conduct both the Noon (Light) and Midnight (Darkness) points at both hours, as an further focused point of ensorcelled energy may be raised. This is considering the embodiment of the self is within the perpetual mastery of the psyche in reference to the model of Shaitan. It is essential that the magician looses all perception of anything outside of the circle, that being enflamed and submerged in gnosis, the circle is the circumference of the sorcerers' world. That the ritual is a success is the subjected 'turning the knife towards oneself' in the area of self-directed and willed energy. The Ritual of the Adversary, in conjunction with the Lord's Prayer Averse (used in certain Luciferian Covens to summon the Devil-Cain) provides a powerful foundation for self-deification in the Witches Sabbat Gnosis."}]
