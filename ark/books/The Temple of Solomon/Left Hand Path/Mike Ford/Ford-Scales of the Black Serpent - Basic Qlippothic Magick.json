This grimoire is a basic: stripped down expansion of some foundational Qlippothic texts contained in \"The Bible of the Adversar\", \"Liber HVI-Ir' and others which fueled TOPI-I. This grimoire should be used to challenge and inspire your own inner and outer transformation \\vithin the Luciferian Path. The Order of Phosphorus offers a gatevmy. yet it is up to the Black Adept to go forward through the gateway. The Order of Phosphorus understands that someone who has a strong Will may create a meaningful and productive life. the Black Adept of TOPH understands that the Luciferian is a perfect example of this; self�accountability. honesty. strength of mind and having achievable goals are all examples of purpose and the enduring focus of the initiate.

It has been suggested by students such as Fuller that the philosophy of the Qabalah is about a return to balance as the state of the original Adam of the Jews. While this may be the aim of the traditional Right Hand Path initiate. the Left Hand Path or Luciferian will seek balance in the forbidden. often a place of great power which is concealed due to its potential destructive force. All things worth conquering will offer risk. as a Luciferian you must understand if this is worth your study and prospect into the mysteries of darkness. Within the Qlippoth. the Realm of God is not that of the Hebraic God. It is the Samael. the beast or dragon which commands darkness and � �haos-realms of hell.

The servitors of each Qlippothic order and sphere operate in the same manner.

Once you gain this, however. be careful not to lose your sense of balance and direction. for often it grows easy to fall into this trap. Invoke the dark spheres with the Prayers and Words of Power; you may use sigils which hold direct meaning and others elsewhere such as in \"AKHKHARU\".

STRUCTURE AND PURPOSE TOPH implements a left hand path initiatory style in the formulation of the grade structure, Beginning with entry into Grade 0 -Nahcmoth and the Black Earth. TOPH initiates are instructed to gauge their experience \\\\ilh formal grade work, utilizing the Bible of the Adversary and other key \\\\orks in formulating their individual perception of Luciferianism. This is Ihe 1110st difficult grade to grasp. initiates must think on how their \"Judeo-Christian\" fo undations mllst be shaken off in exchange for a solid fO llndation of Luciferian thought. Instead of \"conjuring demons\" you arc \"'cmpO\\\\cring yourself'. Every invocation is a calling of either a symbolic or spirilual force, what we call a \"Deific Mask\", of energy into the Temple thai is the Mind � Body - Spirit. Every conscious and soon after subconscious act must be attuned towards self-evolution and self-enlightenment. Lucifcrians leam to balance \"'darkness\" and \"Iight\" by \"know thyself' and the application of Magick in self-creation. The Grade levels are deeply connected \\\\· ilh Ihe Qlippoth. wherein each level is directly attributed to the process of Magick you work through at that time. Grade I -The Blackened Forge of Cain is a grade of the real csscnce of practice - here the Three Types of Luciferian Magick are practiced. Initiates discover that they are alone in their development, no matter who is around them� Self-accountability is a corner stone in the work of the Luciferian as he or she discovers their strengths and weaknesses through the application and practice of Luciferian Magick. the art of transforming the self into a Godlike Consciousness. through the darkness of the mind and spirit in Yatukih Sorcery. understanding primal atavisms and dacrnonic energies \\\\ilhin and beyond the self and Therionick Sorcer),. working with lower sorcery and underslanding the animalistic aspects of the psyche.

This is a highlight of the Grade, a true Plastery of the self! It is within this grade that Adepts begin to explore their own chosen avenues of Luciferian Magick and apply them to their unique individuality. Grade 11 - The Witches Sabbat is a state of being in which the Luciferian bas successfully applied the path of Luciferianism and is considered an Adept of Algol. The Adept of Algol will work deeper into the Luciferian aspects of Magick and Sorcery, expanding at their own pace and desire through various inner orders and above. INNER ORDERS AND GUILDS The Order of Phosphorus is an initiatory guild dedicated to empowerment of the individual through willed activation of the Luciferian Path. Accomplishment on the Luciferian Path creates an opportunity for Prospective initiates to join the Black Order of the Dragon, a companion initiatory organization propagating Adversarial Magick and Vampyrism.

TOPH is also an initiatory order for women equally as well. At the close of 2008 TOPH announced the creation of THE DAUGHTERS OF LILITH, an initiatory system parallel to the traditional grades of TOPH however spe cifically focused on the Feminine Adversarial Current.
