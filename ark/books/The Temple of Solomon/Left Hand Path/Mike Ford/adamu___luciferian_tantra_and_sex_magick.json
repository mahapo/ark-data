The ancient Sumerians had Gods which held rites at shrines, the ancient adversaries to the Zoroastrians known as the Yatus, those who practice yatuk-dinoih (witchcraft) worshiped Az-Jeh the Whore, whose was “kissed” by Ahriman and caused menstruation in women. Ahriman had many Pairikas who were essentially Sex Magickians, Succubi who initiated men into their cult by their charms and wares. The path of the Indian Tantrics involves the hypocrisy of the human condition itself, the misery and pain is a way of bringing insight into the practitioner. In the context of the work in question, the Luciferian uses similar methods. Not to transform the consciousness into some exterior “divine” God, rather to strengthen and transform conscious into an isolate spirit, similar to the archetype of Samael (Lucifer) or Ahriman, Lilith or Az-Jeh. To “bring light” in the path of Forbidden Sex Magick, you must awaken the Shakti, the Kundalini through exploring darkness and the beast within each of us, through that path do you ascend for as the Light Bringer. Consider the Yatus who is able to awaken both the therionick and angelick forms of shadow and light in the flesh. The understanding of self-possibility is then taken to a new level, as consciousness if refined and developed so to are the areas of possibility for the Luciferian. The work of ADAMU as it is presented here is drawn from the Vama Marga, rather not the original term but from a Luciferian perspective. It’s aim is not the perverse for the sake of perversity, it is the transformative state derived from the opposite path, that is, of the Luciferian mind. Seek therefore spiritual liberation through the darkness offered here, find the Light which you have always yearned for.

The alpha was the spirit embodied in the greatest light. Zurvan, the endless one, created and consumed when it wished. There was no intellect beyond it, no individual will beyond it. Time meant nothing, yet the spirit lacked something. The earth was birthed from eldest chaos, a roaring across the blood oceans of time. It is called blood as it holds all creative energies of the universe. Zurvan fathomed a great womb and wished that he had two sons, first was of his doubt, from which darkness encircled light, balance and chaos all in one. His will was to create a concept of light, then Ohrmazd was conceived. Zurvan held the thought that who shall come forth from the womb first shall obtain his kingdom and blessing. His strongest son, the one who is more terrible and beautiful than even Zurvan, was the least favored."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Ahriman called Angra Mainyu heard this and went roaring forth, ripping himself free with claws through his mothers womb. He approached Zurvan and was not accepted as his son, yet denied the kingdom he was essentially promised. Ahriman grew angry and demanded his kingdom. Zurvan gave unto Ahriman a pact from his own being, black and ashen, yet filled with fire and hunger. This substance from his being was his Bride, called Az. Zurvan cursed Ahriman and claimed Az would be his greatest weapon, yet would in the end seek to consume him. There was indeed a great war in the so-called heaven, Ahriman was cast out with other rebellious spirits, who took serpent and dragon forms from the independent thought of Ahriman. Ahriman know awakened those angels that they now had independent thought. They entered the void and through this darkness of the abyss came forth to the depths of the Earth from elder darkness. “Ahriman in darkness, with backward understanding and desire for destruction, was in the abyss, and it is he who will not be; and the place of that destruction, and also of that darkness, is what they call the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 'endlessly dark.'

These created forms are the corruptions of angelick personalities, made powerful and unified with Ahriman by his initiation of the Black Flame. Ohrmazd created the angels Ardwahisht, Shahrewar, Spandarmad, Hordad, and then Amurdad. Ahriman created his Children of Rebellion, the mightiest fallen angels who were Andar, Sovar, Nakahed, and then Tairev and Zairik. Could they have been awakened angels who fell with Ahriman into darkness, his very touch bringing them into the darkened light he had awakened others to?

Methods should include complete stillness, non-thinking, void-reason (seeking complete focus on darkness) and Karezza. This method of masturbation should be focused not to orgasm, yet to focus the mind on the elements of the Beast and Black Serpent as the power of which the planet is encircled in, the cold void truth of the hell-paths of awakening. MEDITATION – during karezza the non-thinking aspect of darkness after a period of time should be entered as fire into darkness, a single thought of self-love and desire to be separate and the only God that is. Each Daeva should be within the Temple of Self, they are fallen-angels which dwell within the body. They slumber and dream within the subconscious, awaiting the Fire Serpent or Az to awaken them.

His nature was War and his spirit was found in the ecstasy of devouring. In the Light of Heaven they went forth, storming and raging and the daevas of chaos began to devour the spirits created by Ohrmazd. Ahriman wanted complete power and would not stop until he achieved his goal: Ahriman wanted to destroy the blinding light of Ohrmazd. It was now with Ahriman, encircled in darkness, beheld within a light more potent than the tyrannical and mind numbing light of Ohrmazd. With the chant of Staota Ahriman and the others were cast from the realm of light again into the darkness. It was those angels, having created the earth and its inhabitants, desired to protect the world from the Druj and their manifestations. Yet the light of Ohrmazd was weakest when his will was spent, fearing the surrounding blanket of darkness.

Balance was found in the core of the Dragon itself. Ahriman dwelled within the darkness long enough to gain his strength of being again, Ahriman hated the concept of heaven, the goodness which led to mindlessness and death of the spirit. The doctrines of Ohrmazd were of the great embrace of light, like the inferno consuming the body, nerves and spirit of its followers. Ahriman would soon touch the clay and find his mark on his children, those like the fallen angels and ones he would create. Angra Mainyu understood that he may take any form he wish, from time to time be useful to his eternal and hungering, immortal spirit. Between the gulf of the light of Ohrmazd and the darkness of Ahriman was the magnetic attraction of both to consume.

Ohrmazd resisted the words of the Father of Serpents but yet Ahriman still replied: 'I will seduce all material life into disaffection to thee and affection to myself, I will awaken mankind as the Temple of Druj, the Gates of Hell and the kingdom of darkness and light.' MEDITATION: Know that those who proclaim light and want to indoctrinate you into slavery or blind faith are those who kill the spirit. Be predator and not prey! Seek the path of Ahriman, against the self-proclaimed law of the universe! INITIATORY FOCUS: With the sparks of being, know what you have been in the past is nothing to what you can become now.

It was Az who soon watched many demons give birth to other children, from which she entered two lion-fiends, then devoured their children. Az grew in spirit and form, entering mankind more and more.

The form of Ahriman was in the form of a frog and would shapeshift into a lizard's (vazak) body. 'What is thy wish Az? What does thy burning core desire? so that I may give it thee.' And Jeh-Az shouted to the evil spirit thus: 'A man is the wish, so give it to me, I wish his pulsating cock to impale and satisfy my hunger O Evil Spirit.' Ahriman appeared a young man to Jeh-Az, and that brought the thoughts of Jeh to him.

His own penis now took the form of a serpent with spikes emerging from it. With each thurst in the Whore Jeh she clawed into his back, her own form bestial and demonic.

Ahriman ejaculated barbed-wired and thorn covered sperm, yellowing from corruption which found a deep crevice within her womb until the coagulated blood mingled with it.

Ahriman called Samael by the Hebrews mounted and penetrated deeply Eve, injecting filth into her, and she conceived and bare Cain who was the First Satanist and Sorcerer. Ahriman left this land to again the darkness of hell. Ahriman proclaims thus, those who make the Daevas a part of the human body and spirit make themselves immortal as a Temple of Ahriman. Worship the Daevas and humans are worshipping themselves! It was indeed Az according to Manichaean folklore that Az formed human bodies so that they may be her covering, thus Az dwells in our bodies.

The date of this is March 21st. Ahriman went unto the planets and many ArchDaevas joined their essence with them. Soon Afterwards, the evil spirit, with the confederate demons, went into the sky; and he led them up, driven with malicious intentions of consuming and growing strong from life forms itself. Ahriman sprang, like a snake, from the sky down to the earth, his form scorching and burning with shadow covered clouds surrounding flame, roaring into the earth. His own druj and daevas mingled into the depths of the earth itself, filling with serpents, spiders and other predatory beasts. He went through the depths of the waters of the world, in the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 secret and hidden places. As a serpent he went form into the depths of the planet into the core of Hell, which would be his abode with the druj.

He found life here, mingling with it he and the confederate demons went forth to corrupt the Tree of Life and it became yet a mirror of the tree as it could not be devoured. The Tree of Da’ath or Death was now the abode of many fallen angels and demons. This mirror of the tree was now withered with wisdom, age and the power of immortality. The Tree of Death now is that of infernal life. Ahriman created from this the darkside within the earth, the storm fiend Azi Dahak, who as the storm fiend hand his form within the stars, with the ArchDaevas counteracting to perceived stasis – power of the planets. The earth itself was filled with serpents, lizards, scorpions and wolves. Thus the earth would find balance and counteraction.

The planets with the many demons, went against the celestial sphere, and they mixed the constellations and invigorated them with fire; and the whole creation was as disfigured as though fire disfigured every place and smoke arose over it, thus the essence of the Adversary was brought in all things. It is said for ninety days and nights the weakened heavenly angels were contending in the world with the confederate demons of the evil spirit, the Adversary and hurled them confounded to hell.

VIº Ahriman evokes Astwihad upon bringing chaos from the outer void The man of Ohrmazd’s tribe, Gayomerd, was seen by Ahriman and considered to be a weak man, made soft by the light which would not allow the balance of chaos and order. Ahriman sends forth Astwihad to infect the earth with bacteria, that man may grow sick from the elements if he is not strong enough. This is a means of challenge, of progression.

Ahriman and those devs called Ahrimanes were indeed spirits who were of the element air, they reside in darkness and beget inner light. Ohrmazd attempted to bring an army of angels to defeat Ahriman yet he was the mightest of the Gods, would not bow before another. Angels fell as darkness and light invaded, therein was balance. The Daevas would take any form they desired, from pleasing to repulsive. No longer would the spirits of the wind hold the Ahrimanes back, their desire would shake the foundations of the world.

Into the waters came more noxious creatures who filled the holes and dark places of the earth, that their venom and stench filled the earth. Let us praise Apaosh, the demon who took the earthly form of a black horse, whose spirit frightened and rejected Tishtar who could never banish him, for the darkness mingled the water was the servitors of Ahriman.

Serpent and wolf covered as a gigantic cloud of darkness, Ahriman became the tyrant against those spirits who sought to oppress he and his children. Yet within this mountain chain is Arezur, named from a Son of Ahriman who fell against Gayomerd, called the Mouth at the Gate of Hell. It was deep in the depths of the earth, in the caverns and caves of hell, the lair of Az that she brought the demons in union with each other. The fallen ones were smitten as she taught them the acts of fucking, ejaculating in the womb of the whore, entering her from behind and all acts of erotic initiation.

The Fourth Battle, that of Plants Ahriman went forth upon the earth and took many forms which pleased him – wolf, serpent, toad, dragon and many other predatory and bestial forms. He brought unto the earth 10,000 diseases which fought within the bodies of all living creatures. Ahriman sent Taprev and Zairich to the plants, to beget the tools of witchcraft and sorcery, but also to join in bodies to produce heat and thirst. As the plants and trees buried themselves deep in the chthonic depths of the earth, Taprev and Zairich took the sacrifices of man such as blood, hair, nails and the corpse to be the food of which druj would grow and manifest.

CONSCIOUSNESS AND TRANSFORMATION Consciousness as defined in the Vama Marga is the realization that all must join with the absolute, by experiencing the pain and pleasure of this world of flesh and spirit. The Luciferian considers that the consciousness should not be joined with the absolute, the devouring principle, rather separated and transformed into a divnity by realizing the therionick and angelick aspects of the Mind-Body-Spirit. This grimoire will no doubt sicken many of you, such is the way of initiation. Some will find attraction once you have felt repulsion, if so, keep on and find the temple of pleasure and pain! Consciousness is the point of awake and existent in the world around you. This does not define being aware of the ‘self’ on any particular level. The Luciferian who seeks the concept of spiritual immortality must have the ‘trshna’ or ‘thirst’ for continued existence. The Luciferian utilizes the practices of Yoga and Buddhism as a means of self-control and development, however the Luciferian is an anti-Buddhist in result. To achieve control and destroy the mind into the concept of ‘oneness’ of God is self-hate. The Luciferian recognizes divinity within, seeking to materialize it and refine consciousness becomes the ‘Azothoz’ point of Magick itself, the beginning and end."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 Let us present a new ‘twist’ on Sex Magick to focus on the following goals: 1.

Practice and seek to understand the inherent nature of the symbolism of both the black and red serpent. If working with the red, feel the flame ignite your nerves along the spine, create a sense of brief ecstasy and a surge of power with each Chakra point. Do not fail to keep the focus of your posture. If working with the black serpent, feel the physical hunger for Chi and internal power as the Ahrimanic serpent illuminates your Chakra points with blackened fire. -Physical Training – keeping fit, pushing the self to the limits to grow stronger. Eating with a balanced diet. -Symbolism and the Great Work – Know what you are working with and what each Deific Mask means. Vira – the second level of initiation, where one is able to control the beast within the mind and body, but is able to begin practice of sexual magick but with willful control and self – discipline. At least three first workings should be Karezza and holding the body back from Orgasm. This is understandably very difficult and will cause mental and physical pain, but with the display of self-discipline, the mind and body will strengthen and focus under this intense test of Will.

"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 BESTIAL ATAVISMS The path of sexual magick and sorcery is found within the focus of entering the opposite or seeming shadow of the mind. The conscious mind is defined by restriction and boundaries, some for good reason, many for social foundations. The path of Adamu can lead two consenting adults to explore their deep subconscious by awakening bestial atavisms. Atavisms were explored by art and theory by Austin Osman Spare in the Twentieth Century, in many ways, as effectively as Aleister Crowley, if not more. Bestial Atavisms are the latent knowledge and wisdom within the mind, the very focus of becoming via the Luciferian path. When the Luciferian “falls” to the depths, then rises again as a spirit like Yaltabaoth or Samael, the process is clear. The “fall” is the sorcerous work of exploring the subconscious, the rising is the blending of the uncovered knowledge into the conscious mind to achieve real world results. Bestial Atavisms are uncovering the lycanthropic aspects, the Az center of thirst and desires, i.e. lust and using these desires to manifest in the conscious mind. Know that within the path of sexual magick, it is essential to overcome elements of repulsion by confronting these acts. This does not mean an anti-moralistic view, rather something as simple as copulating with a woman or mate you consider “ugly”, a practice both Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare did frequently. One may have sex with a partner outside, perhaps at night near a garbage dump to attune the senses to rotting meat, so on and so on."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 SEXUAL MAGICK AND TRANSFORMATION The preparations for Sexual Magick are as systematic as any other workings, take note that discipline and self-imposed isolation is essential for initiation before working with another. While your actual work may be very loose and hermetic, the preparation should be disciplined. Firstly, know what your goal is – the very aim of the working. Will you seek orgasm or will you use the method of Karezza, being excitement to the brink of orgasm and then focusing that energy on your goal, then allowing a mental release rather than a physical orgasm. Second, when practicing the rite, allow your mind to stay focused on the goal, not the pleasure itself. If it a solitary working, keep your thoughts focused on the object or goal. Although Luciferian Witchcraft and Sorcery holds many ciphers and symbols, in the circle it is merely you and the Gods/Goddesses and Daemons which you have given power to – nothing else. One who seeks to explore the primal hungers and spiritual evolution of the path of the sexual demon, control is demanded in the highest degree of practice. You will wish to meditate and learn control of your body and your thoughts. This can be a daunting process but through the Willed focus of Magick shall this come to be.

The Bon religious tradition, developed in Tibet before the existing spread of Buddhism held in place all the foundations of balanced magickal practice. The word “Bon Pa” is a verb meaning “to recite magical formulas” and refered to the highly potent practice of reciting Mantra, the so-called “Sigils of Sound” which refer to the practice now as “Sonic Black Magick”, representing the transformation of self through sound. It is believed that sound itself can transform and control energies in the world around us. The Left Hand Path does not defer or represent an aspect of evil or good. Rather these are moralistic terms which hold little relevance when taken from their imposed settings in society. Path of Buiti and Bon Po Yoga is a word deriving from a Sanskrit root meaning ‘Yuj” and means essentially “join”. While the traditionalists mean “join with God” the Luciferian means “join with the Adversary”, meaning the Daemonic Masculine and Feminine. The Luciferian is essentially a Sadhaka, being a spiritual aspirant of the left hand path, seeking to make his or her body a balanced, spiritual and physical Temple of the Adversary, to grow strong and immortal in mind through the initiation on the Satanic or Luciferian path.

Az is said to inhabit the human body as well, bringing heat within it and causing hunger and continual predatory instincts. It matters not if you believe this as literal, symbolic or a manifestation of the Adversarial power. The key to unlocking this power is to develop and practice methods of discipline and control. Buddhist techniques prove effective in developing such a process, keep in mind that one must not align to that spirit-murdering process of self-hate, but use the techniques to become as a God or Goddess. This does not simply mean you “think” you are one and it is so, rather it is a deeper process of initiation which continually progresses this aspect. Many have asked “spiritual immortality” would be boring, always being “yourself”. What must be understood is that the individual self is always changing, transforming and shedding former aspects of itself. The mind is always expanding and seeking new challenges, thus any God or Daemonic Spirit is continually changing and progressing. As the path of the Qlippoth in ritual circumstances allows devouring spirit of the sorcerer to feed and grow strong, it acts as a path against all others, to not loose the mind but grow from it.

As the physical body is the highest percent water, the astral body is fed by the heat of the body.

The Storm of Set-Typhon, the “evil” if you will is nothing more than the subconscious desires of the sorcerer, once unlocked in a dreaming sense, through sorcery itself, can be used to achieve what the practitioner may wish to flesh out or manifest in the waking world. The process Spare employed are indeed found in older systems of Magick. Systematically, Austin Osman Spare had made quite a detailed study of classical grimoires, such as The Goetia, Grimoirium Verum and other such works. From 1904 Spare had already formulated his creative technique which was no doubt a result of his early artistic influence rather than anything overtly occult. It was during his study with Aleister Crowley that Spare really found his own gnosis of sorcerous study; he went creatively further to found a system of obsession through Will-Desire-Belief. It has been suggested that Spare had developed his sigillic method from Cornelius Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia, which introduces a combination technique of Arabic, Greek and Latin letters to form spirit traps or servitor houses. For example- \"There are, therefore, two and twenty letters which are the foundation of the world, and of creatures that are, and are named in it.... He, therefore would find them out, must by each joining together of the letters so long examine them, until a voice of God is manifest, and the framing of most sacred letters be opened and discovered.\" (Three Books of Occult Philosophy, by Agrippa.)"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 Austin Spare utilized the conceptual picture of desire as it was based in sex and workings derived from congress. In order for a desire to become flesh, with such as Goetic sorcery, one must adopt a form of faith which is controlled and willed belief. From this the sigil would be constructed by a series of letters from which interlace and become something not entirely recognizable in form. The meaning itself would be lost to the conscious mind, yet in fruitful ground in the subconscious, would reemerge at the right moment by a consciously willed atavistic resurgence. It is in this manner that one would summon and control `demons', `angels' and other spirits which would appear and produce results in magickal workings. Zos vel Thanatos (the Witch Cult name of Spare) suggested that if the magician pressed to hard to achieve a goal then the force of his own Will may a deterrent to the accomplishment. Therefore, it was suggested that at the moment of evocation the desire should be focused and then erased or banished from the mind. The obvious principle of this is based around the conscious mind being side tracked and to communicate directly with the subconscious, which did not understand words yet only through symbolic images and impulses. By actually forgetting the goal, the conscious mind allowed the subconscious to bring this specific desire to enflesh. The `demon' or `angel' then was thus from the great arcana of the self, Zos and Kia - therefore exists and communicates through ones own sacred Alphabet of Desire.

Hell being a word derived from Helan, Angelo-Saxon for 'hele' and conceal, the very arcana of the self. In reference to Heaven, a temporary state of self-satisfaction, is destroyed in the fall of consciousness through the Luciferic rebellion of self-knowledge and that very drive which initiates hidden knowledge which can become wisdom.

He did not seek mastery of the physical world, nor was he Satanic or Luciferian. He was the artist of the inner mind, his temple was that of the elderly fucking in demonic forms. Spare knew that once the subconscious could be opened, those bestial and sometimes angelic desires could be controlled and shaped to the desire of flesh in the world. Take for instance, the concept of the Alphabet of Desire. It is merely, a language of the subconscious, a book of dead names. By naming those 22 zones of the subconscious, which is called the Qlippoth in the Luciferian Path of Liber HVHI, Luciferian Witchcraft and Book of the Witch Moon, one may accomplish many internal aspects of unleashing power. Spare drew and focused on the Alphabet of Desire as a kind of sacred letter which would preserve belief from the Ego itself, allowing belief to return to the subconscious mind over and over again. It becomes lost to the conscious mind from intelligence, but is understood completely in the form of emotion to the subconscious. In summary, the Gates of Hell is the subconscious from which one may Will their desire into flesh in this world, it is ultimately a means of exploring the Immortal Essence, and ones own Coming into Being. Leviathan is the gate keeper of this process, and the Higher Self (Immortal Essence or Holy Guardian Angel) is the manifestation of this work.

She had alone the power to awaken the Serpent – Mind of Ahriman (the Devil) from his deep slumber, in which he bestowed upon her the Kiss which caused menstruation. Tantric sects of the Left Way consider the menstruation cycle to be the most powerful for the practitioner, thus Woman is Blessed as the Daughter of the Devil itself. The deeper mysteries of Luciferian Sex Magick are found in the early Hebrew tales of Lilith and Samael original born in the Same Fire, thus they are both twins and lovers, as well as the begetters of Cain, the First Witch and Satanist.

It is the symbol of both the Sun and the Moon, the sphere which begets strength and the very focus of the Magician. Thus the circle of Cain is the symbol of the Beast or Devil in flesh, a very manifestation of a God or Goddess on Earth. The circle is a continual and progressing manifestation and power center, which is merely a reflection of the body. When the two meet within the circle, be it male and female, male and male or female and male, both symbolize a manifestation and incarnation of the Adversary or Two Headed One. This is Noon and Midnight, the very essence of Shaitan/Satan as the Double Wanded God/Goddess. One Head represents Satan while the other is Lilith, the union of duality to bring the strength of being. The female partner should be menstruating which represents the vital energies of the feminine. She who seeks the invocation of Lilith will collect the blood and place on the altar of Art Magickal, the male represents the devouring. The goal of this Tantrick exercise is to focus the inherent energies via the Will, but to use them in a process of self-transformation, a mutation into a living temple of which the Daemon may manifest. Thus in this work, the sorcerer becomes a director of the current itself, a living expression of what is called “the Devil” or Adversary. The female is also a living vital manifestation of this current as well, it is in ancient Hebrew folklore that both Satan and Lilith were born of the same Fire, being twins.

The Vajra Lightning bolt, that which falls from the sky (often associated with Lucifer or Satan, the Watchers or Fallen Angels) Is a symbol of internal vitality, strength and a cipher of initiation. The libido is symbolized as a snake; the ‘Black Serpent’ of Yezidi lore is to represent knowledge and wisdom. The serpent thus represents a willed focus of energies connected with the self, as also the Daemon associated with the Working and the Azhish Ritual of Zohak/Azi Dahaka (The Paitisha). You may seek sexual congress to bring both Kali and Lucifer to flesh by using menstrual blood and semen in a vessel.

A suitable description of a Sex Magick working by Pascal Beverly Randolph “was to copulate with many different women on one bedsheet, never changing or cleaing it. Thus, it retained the cumulative life force of those couplings, mingled and preserved in crusted fluids. He then stretched the sheet as an artist’s canvas, and painted upon it his visual image of a succubus.

Each night you may exhume the vessel and wrap it in the sheet or cloth used in your congress, smeared over and over again with the sexual fluids of both partners.

When ejaculation occurs, the female or male (if both are consenting and monogamy is trusted) may take the semen in their mouth and mixed with their saliva or blood, spit into the vessel to empower the demon. If the rite is homosexual, a incubi with a preference for men will no doubt be created. If the couple are lesbians, a succubi will no doubt be empowered and bound to them. It is the combination of fluids of both male and female which seem to create a demon which may mutate between both and be able to perform various tasks depending on the sorcerers.

The second Witch began an invocation – “By the First Moon of Hecate-Lilith do we come as virgins unto Her, let us be blessed in innocence and beauty, perfect love and trust. By the Second Moon of Hecate-Lilith do we emerge as Harlots, blood filled whores who fuck the living and the dead, for our desire is endless, seeking the tongue dance of each other in anxiety filled desire.

The male thought of slow fucking of goats and women, dragon-like worms moving in and out of moaning girls who had passed beyond maturity by some five to seven years, knowing the very desire contained in the image of the Devil and His Bride. The male was at this moment very hard as the first witch, being aroused with the second witch and her slithering tongue and hand, slapped the double black dildo on her ass in-between tonguing her. The witch who was receiving this pleasure ran her tongue across the black latex crotch area of the man, and then spit at his mouth, while he lustfully sought to lick from his mouth. “Hekak Vozath Ka-Sath-Ompos” she hissed at him, the male hissed the same invocation back, and both looked lustfully at each other.

While he felt as if he could in mere seconds obtain an orgasm he carefully kept himself in check. The first witch whose hands were bare carefully reached at the waist of the man to move his latex pants pack to reveal his hardness. The second witch, whose hands were latex covered reached down and with her right hand gripped his penis tightly and began licking the head in a slow, circular motion. The male warlock was on the brink of orgasm, filled with ecstasy. With a slow mantra he gained control again and resisted the urge for finishing and spilling out the energy. The first witch began also licking the penis of the man while both women moved their tongues into each others mouths while kissing the head of the cock. As the male was at the brink of shooting semen all upon the faces, mouths and hands of the witches, they stopped and he sought with every ounce of his being to control the explosion.

By each strike, each spark which ignites the clay of selflessness, Lucifer emerges again within the psyche. This is the Rite of the Luciferian Ascension, the Agape of which Summons the Black Serpent. Let the initiate being either male or female choose a partner of art, who will by any means necessary arouse, copulate and stimulate the initiate for exhausting lengths of time. This rite is of the nature of Aleister Crowley’s ‘Eroto Comatose Lucidity’, from which the initiate is led to the gates of exhaustion and beyond, when the flesh fails by overworking and the spirit must ascend by Will to the Luciferian Aethyr, of which the spirit is emblazed with the presence of the Peacock Angel, being Azal’ucel or Shaitan. There are specifically two methods of this rite – Via Lilith (AZ) or Via Cain. As Lilith, musick should be played in the background which inspires dark emotions, chanting and somewhat horrific sounds. The chamber of operation should be decorated in crimson and black, with images of Lilith and her familiars, the Lilitu and Succubi. The Path Via Cain is one where the initiate is adorned and surrounded with the fetishes of the Horned God, thus in earthen decorations and symbols of Cain.

The purpose of the rite is to cross a boundary of flesh into spirit, of entering what the Cult of the Hand and the Eye call “Neither – Neither”, by which the senses are not recognizable in any standard fashion, led to a state by extreme physical and mental exhaustion. It is by this path that the magician shall in a state of mental isolation, rise up in spirit to the Luciferian Aethyr, the very Sabbat of the Sun by which he or she shall commune with the Blazing Soul of Lucifer, the Peacock Angel who is the fiery initiator and father spirit of Cain. Within an initiatory sense Azal’ucel/Shaitan is the Angelick Higher Self (what Aleister Crowley called the Holy Guardian Angel) of Cain. The female and male magician will both undertake the Rite in the context of both Via Cain and Via Lilith, to understand two Aspects of the Adversary. The rite is composed of several workings of causing exhaustion of the initiate by sexual arousal – over and over again. This is similar to what was called the “release of woman”, who in swoon communicates with her higher self, the sweetness which is referred to her voice as the “Peacock” in the “Ananga Ranga”, her voice is the Joy of Mankind. Thus as the initiate reaches near the final gate of the working, the Adept is led to Shaitan the Peacock Angel – Serpent, who is Azal’ucel. This rite is equally undertaken in the gnosis of Lilith (AZ), whose darksome embrace leads the Adept to leaving the flesh and seeking the Hidden Fire of Her, she who is web to the Crimson Dragon Samael, Ahriman, who is the Devil and Our Father. This is the marriage of Fire with Spirit, the quickening of the Witch into the Gnosis of the Lightbringer.

This was the rite which no man may sate, which no lover save her Angelick Host may initiate further. The witch understood that Azal’ucel, the Angel – Watcher who is revealed by the hidden name as Lucifer and Azazel, transforms within the initiate by bringing a distinct and unique ‘fire’ to the self; in a sense a continual transformation from the Hidden Fire (Black Light) of Cain to the Higher Faculties of Azal’ucel, the Risen God within.

Ahriman is also known as Angra Mainyu, an older title derived from Angra Mainyu, being the “evil” or averse spirit. Ahriman is a sorcerer who achieved a means of immortality and power over darkness and shadow. One who creates his desire in flesh. In relation to the sorcerer or practitioner of Yatuk-Dinoih, the individual seeks by developing their own system of sorcery, to become like Ahriman, just as did Akht-Jadu in the Zoroastrian tales. Ahriman is called the Great Serpent or Dragon, whose spirit is a shapeshifter and tester of flesh and mind. It was considered in some Zoroastrian tales that Ahriman and the Daevas, his angels, ecisted between the earth and the fixed stars, which would be essentially of the element Air (much like Lucifer his later identification).

Akha [Avestan/Pahlavi] - Avestan, meaning evil. In the context of Liber HVHI and Luciferian Witchcraft, it is a term signifying the antinomian path. Akho [Avestan/Pahlavi] – From the Avestan “akha” meaning “evil”, Akho is mentioned in the Denkard as a word representing a “current” of averse energy or evil, through which one aligning their thoughts in possessing spiritual independence, antinomianism and self-deification one may reach into the spirit of Ahriman. This supports the initatory foundation of the Luciferian path itself – the Adept prepares to become like the Adversary his or her self, based on their own unique path. Akht [Avestan/Pahlavi] – The Sorcerer who was the embodiment of the Yatus, the demonic forces of Ahriman. Akht-Jadu or Kabed-us-spae as he was called was mentioned in Matigan-I Yosht-I Fryan. Akhtya was the founder and member of the Yatus, a coven of ‘demons’ and sorcerers who wandered Persia, practicing and developing sorcery. The name Akht itself means ‘evil’, ‘filth’ and ‘pestilence’, thus relates to the initiatory nature of Akhti as a sorcerer of the Adversary, by the darkness shall he come into light. Akhtya or Azyta is thus considered a symbol of the Zanda, which is an Apostle or Priest of Ahriman.

On some 17th century maps Algol was labeled, “The Specter’s Head”. Algol upon some research has indicated that possibility Three stars which are an eclipsing binary, which may explain some of the rapid color change. Some writers have connected Algol with the Egyptian Khu, or spirit. The Khu is considered a shadow spirit which feeds on other shades of the dead. In reference to the writings and initiatory symbolism of Michael W. Ford, ALGOL is the sigillized in one form as a Chaos Star with an Averse Pentagram in the center. The Pentagram refers to the Eye of Set, timeless and divine, godlike and independent. The Chaos Star is destruction, Change and power – all of which emerges from the Eye of Shaitan, or Set. It is this Chaos which then brings Order. ALGOL is the mirror of the sorcerer, one who may enter and reside in the pulsing eye of blackened flame. Angelick [Crowley/Thelema] – The “k” representing the difference between Angelic in the Western point of view and the Great Work of the Spirit itself. Angelick represents the higher faculties in man and woman, the balanced and intelligent spirit. The Luciferian Path promotes and utilizes symbolism from the Dead Sea Scrolls, Avesta and other texts as a model-point and foundation of initiation and transformation, the image of Tabaet and the Fallen Angels, Samael and Lilith, all represent an aspect of the Angelick. Anghuya [Avestan] – Chi or Lifeforce, the vital essence of the spirit which is the source of all life.

Arezura [Avestan/Pahlavi] – Arezurahe griva (Arezura) in the Bundahishin is called “a mount at the gate of hell, whence the demons rush forth”. Arezura is the gate to hell in the Alburz mountain range in present day Iran. The North is traditionally the seat of Ahriman, wherein the cold winds may blow forth. Arezura from an initiatory perspective is the subconscious, the place where sorcerers may gather and grow in their arts, by encircling and manifesting their desire. M.N. Dallah wrote in “The History of Zoroastrianism” concerning a connection with demons holding mastery over the earth, their ability to sink below the earth and that such demons around the time of Zoroaster walked the earth in human form. In the Denkard, it is described that one who becomes a vessel for the “evil religion” becomes physically an abode for “Unholy Demons” or Daevas. One grows aligned to Arezura spiritually by practicing with discipline the path of Daeva-yasna or Yatukih sorcery. Arezur or Arzur is the name of an early Son of Ahriman who killed the First man.

AZ [Avestan/Pahlavi] – Called ‘Concupiscence’, Az is represented as Primal Sexual Hunger, that which eventually devours all things. Az is also related to menstruation (The KISS of Ahriman causes menstruation in women) and is a destroyer through chaos. Az was connected with Sexual Hunger but also religious doubt, which relates her to a Luciferian Spirit who broke the chains of dogma by the Black Light, the torch of self-perception of being. Az also represents Lilith as the Goddess of the Beasts of the Earth, the very mother of demons and sorcerous beings.

The Black Flame is strengthened by the initiation of the Black Adept, who is able to balance a spiritual path with the physical world. Black Magick – The practice of Antinomian and self-focused transformation, self-deification and the obtainment of knowledge and wisdom. Black Magick in itself does not denote harm or wrongdoing to others, rather describes “black” as considered to the Arabic root word FHM, charcoal, black and wisdom. Black is thus the color of hidden knowledge. Magick is to ascend and become, by Willed focus and direction. Cain –The Antinomian nomad and Sorcerer who was the spiritual offspring of Samael (the Black Dragon) and Lilith (Red Dragon/the mother of demons) through the body of Eve in Biblical lore. Cain was said to have been the initiate of the Caul, and through his first step on the Left Hand Path (Antinomian practice) he is the initiator of the sorcerer and witch.

The term does not reflect the theistic worship or knee bending towards an exterior force, rather a Willed direction of self-advancement by transformation. Daeva represents a “mask” of power, specifically to perceived energies. Dregvant [Avestan/Pahlavi] – In historical Zoroastrian lore, a person embodied with Druj, the spirit of darkness. Druj is refered as both feminine and masculine, thus is an initiatory term relating to the foremost union of Ahriman and Az, the blackened matter and fiery darkness of his bride. A Dregvant is a Yatu or initiate of the Daeva-Yasna. Druj [Avestan/Pahlavi] – “Lie” referring to demons, feminine and masculine.

Druj is a title representing antinomian power in a personage, a daeva in flesh. Evil Eye – In the old Gathic writings, the Evil Eye is considered a power of the Daeva and Druj, meaning the power to cause death, oppression and sickness. In a modern sense, the Evil Eye represents the window to the Soul or Spirit itself, not merely as a negative but equally so a positive. The Eye of the Yatu is the commanding presence which is a form of spell casting, to focus the Will itself on the desired goal, to achieve a result. Many Daevas are directly related to the Evil Eye, thus is as well a symbol of Ahriman. Ghanamino [Avestan/Pahlavi] – Name of Ahriman or Angra Mainyu, spelling from the Denkard. Occuring also as Ganamino and Akundag (from Manichaean texts)."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 180 HVHI – Reverse of IHVH, the name of God in Cabalism. HVHI is the name of Samael and Lilith, the Adversary – the very name of darkness manifest. Indriyas [Tantra]- Senses, in Tantra there are considered 10 senses. The senses in Tantra are often considered unreliable, yet defined such by the often narrow minded and closed right hand path Buddhist sects. The Luciferian recognizes the balance of the spiritual and physical with regard to the senses, seeks to use them according to their function. Jahi [Avestan/Pahlavi] – The companions/concubines of the Yatu. An alternative spelling of Jeh. Jeh [Avestan/Pahlavi] – A manifestation of the Whore, AZ in Zoroastrian lore. Jeh is a consort of Ahriman, the Sorcerous Daemon of shadow and darkness. It was she who awoke Ahriman from his great slumber, that which no other sorcerer, wizard, witch or demon could do.

The LHP seeks disunion to grow in perception and being, strength and the power of an awakened mind. The Left Hand Path from the Sanskrit Vama Marga, meaning ‘Left Way’, symbolizes a path astray all others, subjective only to itself. To truly walk upon the Left Hand Path, one must strive to break all personal taboos and gain knowledge and power from this averse way, thus expand power accordingly. Left Hand path is by no means Negative in approach, as the goal is self-deification and the balance of the spirit and body. Lilith [Hebrew]– The Goddess of Witchcraft, Magick and Sorcery. Lilith was the first wife of Adam who refused to be submission and joined with the shadows and demonic spirits in the deserts. Lilith was also said to be the spiritual mother of Cain by her mate, Samael (Shaitan) the Dragon. Lilith appeared in Sumerian times as a Goddess of the Beasts of the Wild, as well as Sorcery and Night-fornication. Lilith was said to have many forms, from beautiful women to half human and the bottom half animal, to half woman and half flame. Lilith is also the mother of demons and a Vampyric spirit which is a primal manifestation of the Zoroastrian and Manichaean AZ and Jeh. Lilith may also be related to the Indian KALI, whose name is one of Her 17 names. Luciferian Magick – Essentially close to the term, Black Magick but specifically focuses on ascending in a self-deified and isolated way in reference to Lucifer, the bringer of Light. Luciferian Magick may in this term make reference to seeking Light and darkness through magickal development, not an abstract concept, but to manifest the Will in both the spiritual and physical world."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 182 Magick - To Ascend and Become.

May be attributed to the inner practices of the Black Order of the Dragon. A ritual published in Luciferian Witchcraft, The Ritual of Druj Nasu is a vampiric or predatory rite utilizing ancient Persian sorcery inversions and techniques of sorcery for strengthening consciousness. The predator should not be perceived as a negative – all living organisms are predators. Qlippoth - As the Zohar attributes the Qlippoth as being a result of the Separation from creation it seems by mere definition that the Qlippoth is indeed inherent of the concept of the Black Flame, or Gift of Samael. Between two separate things, there is a concept of Separation which essentially is the concept of ‘shells’ or ‘peels’ being the aspects the sorcerer must fill and in turn devour in the process of becoming like Samael and Lilith. The Qlippoth and Tree of Death (Da’ath) is the pathway to becoming like the Adversary, as the Tree of Life is the path to joining with God (becoming one with). Sabbat – The gathering and conclave of sorcerers. There are in a conceptual sense, two types of Sabbats – the Luciferian and the Infernal. The Infernal is a bestial and earth-bound journey, similar to those shown in woodcuts and gathering points. The Infernal Sabbat is sometimes sexual, where the sorcerer may shape shift and communicate with their familiars and spirits. The Luciferian Sabbat is a solar and air phenomena based in dreaming, floating in air and having sensations of a warm heat similar to sitting out in the sun.

Sabbatic – A term which is related as the knowledge of the secret gathering, the Sabbat. This is a focus of inspired teaching based on magickal development via dreaming and astral projection. The Sabbat is the gathering of sorcerers in dreaming flesh, when the body is shed for the psyche which is able to go forth in whatever form it desires. The witch or sorcerer who is able to attend the Sabbat has already freed the mind through a process of Antinomian magical practice, thus enforcing and strengthening the imagination as a visualization tool, similar to divination and ‘sight’ with spirits. Sex Magick [Luciferian] – The use of Shakti (Daemonic Feminine) with the Shiva (Daemonic Masculine) energies to transform consciousness into a Luciferian aspect of the Black Flame, divine consciousness. Sex Magick in the Luciferian context is a volatile and challenging path which defines success by results, that is by a spiritual and physical continual ‘fleshing out’ of self-directed goals. The Luciferian realizes that the material or Therionick aspect (Ahriman and the devouring Az) are essential principles in the Mind-Body-Spirit circle of progression, initiation and self-evolution. In a considered Form of Satanic thought, the Sex Magickian as presented in ADAMU is not practicing ‘evil’ rather is exploring the darkest aspects to master all elements of the self in order to balance a spiritual and material life. Shades – Spirits of the Dead, ghosts and phantoms which walks in the astral plane. These spirits may represent in some cases the body of the sorcerer in the plane of the dead, a world separate in some areas from our own living perception.

Sorcery – The art of encircling energy and power of self, by means of self -fascination (inspiration through the imagination). Sorcery is a willed controlling of energies of a magical current, which is responsive through the Will and Belief of the sorcerer.

Staota [Avestan/Pahlavi] – A Vibration which could cause death or some change, that which would encircle the one sounding the Staota in self-focused energy. A Staota is used historically in the mythological tale, The Matigan-I Yosht-I Fryan. A Sorcerous technique presented in the Second Edition of YATUK DINOIH. Therionick [Crowley/Thelema] – Therion, Greek meaning ‘beast’. Therionick with the “k” separating the transformation of the bestial elements of the body (the lower daemon or lycanthropic essence, that which serves Az as the material devouring principle), atavistic (shadow aspects of the unconsciousness) and the ritualistic principles of the dark side or night side of the Mind. Tiamat [Assyrian] – Generative concept from which all emerged from. Tiamat is a feminine dragon principle whose brood were half insect, beast or serpent. Tiamat is viewed as the vampire goddess in the Luciferian Path. Tishin [Avestan/Pahlavi] – A demon of thirst or vampyric/luciferian druj, serpent and daemon.

The development and practice of adversarial and opposing sorcery to encircle the witch or wizard in self-developed energy. The principle of Darkness and the Deva/Druj (Demon) worship of this sect was in seeming model form, that by becoming as Darkness they developed a Light within. See LUCIFERIAN WITCHCRAFT - Grimoire written by Michael Ford. Yatus [Avestan/Pahlavi] – A group of ‘demons’ or sorcerers who practice Yatukih sorcery and Daeva-Yasna. The Yatus were led by Akht-Jadu, Akhtya. They were also considered nomads in nature, wandering through all parts of Persia practicing their religion.

In the areas of Yatuk Dinoih, Sabbatic and Luciferian Sorcery, transformation occurs by the embrace and becoming of the opposing force, or adversarial (antinomian) ideas within the self. The initiate moves through the magical current to strengthen his or her own being.

Herein is magick from the foundation to higher pathworkings of Sorcery and Black Magick . . . here the works which burn away the modern white-washing of so-called magick and or Witchcraft . . . herein are the rituals of Lucifer, Ancient Persian Sorcery, Goetic magick and forbidden sex magick\" For more than a decade left hand path and dark withcraft expert Michael W. Ford has laboured in the forbidden fields of the dark side of the occult, lit by the pale moon of Luciferian ambition and Satanic drive. Luciferian Witchcraft represents perhaps the major part of his published accomplishments to date. The first editions of most of his works are disappearing into private libraries of occult collector's items-and their prices are increasing enormously. With this fact in mind, Luciferian Witchcraft gathers together in one huge compendium many of the shocking rituals and bizarre initiation rites of black magick that have established Ford as the most cutting-edge exponent of the left hand path tradition in America today. The book begins with a lengthy and highly scholarly exposition of the place of the Draconic adversary within historical magick. Set Typhon, the Egyptian God of Darkness, Ahriman, the Persian Devil and his Whore of Darkness, the Adversary and the Bride of the Devil, Cain the Son, the Gnostic Yaldabaoth, \"Child of Chaos\", the Path of the Crooked Serpent- Leviathan and Beelzebub and Tiamat, Pazuzu, and Moloch are only some of the topics and figures covered. The second part of the book,The Grimoires of Luciferian Witchcraft, includes several of his most infamous graveyard workings, together with the complete version of the Luciferian Goetia- a completely revised and updated version of the Goetia grimoire from the Lesser Key of Solomon the King. Part three covers Yatukan and Ahrimanic Persian sorcery. As I have mentioned before, it is the willingness and creativity of Ford to look beyond worn-out Christian- and Hebrew-based demonology in search of black magick inspiration that marks his work as unique. Here, forbidden heresies of millenia-old Zoroastrian thought reveal their diabolic secrets to the sorceror."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 LIBER HVHI Magick of the Adversary By Michael W. Ford Succubus Publishing 2005 ISBN: 1411660862 198 pages, 8.5 x 11.0 in., Perfect-bound, 60# white interior paper, black and white interior ink, 100# white exterior paper, full-color exterior LIBER HVHI, the awaited grimoire of the Luciferian Path is now published containing the infernal rites of the Qlippoth, an extensive ideological and magical system presenting a grounded and understandable form of working with the Qlippothic Tree of Da’ath and tunnels. The second part of the grimoire is based on the ritualistic inversions of the Avestan texts and the forbidden path of Predatory Spiritualism. LIBER HVHI contains the 22 spheres of the Infernal Qlippoth, the methods of filling and draining those “shells” and the Luciferian Rites of the Supper of Cain, symbolic of the first Satanist from the ancient Hebrew texts relating to the devouring process from a symbolic and ritualistic approach. No matter what name the Adversary has been called by, from the ancient Persian cult of Yatukih sorcerers Ahriman or Angra Mainyu, his Bride Jahi or Az, to the Hebrew Samael and Lilith, the Luciferian Current has remained strong beneath those ancient cultures. LIBER HVHI is a grimoire written from ancient religious texts such as the Avesta and various Cabbalistic writings. The result is a powerful Luciferian ideology and methodology of ritual and daily-life practice which transforms the mind into the Spirit of the Adversary. LIBER HVHI: MAGICK OF THE ADVERSARY Liber HVHI explores the Qlippothic Spheres, Ritual Sorcery based on the ancient cults mentioned in the Avesta of Yatuvidah, daeva-yasna (demon-worshippers) persecuted by the Zoroastrians. The roots of the Adversary as the Masculine and Demonic Feminine are explored from Hebrew and Ancient Persian sources, to a living and potent Left-Hand-Path initiatory system. Beginning with an inversion of the Catholic Rite to instead practice “exorcism”, the inverted and created rite is aimed at “Possession” or liberating the shadow self into a viable, productive focus. The 22 cells of the Qlippoth along with the infernal spheres are presented as valuable aspects of strengthening consciousness and creating an attitude of winning and self-deification. LIBER HVHI will contrast with those looking to condemn left-hand-path writings, the revealed identity of the Luciferian is one who wishes to become something more, from the predatory spirituality of Ahriman and Az to the intense ritual practices of the long forgotten Daevas of the Avesta.
