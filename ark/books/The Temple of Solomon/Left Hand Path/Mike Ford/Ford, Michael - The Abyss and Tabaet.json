FordINTRODUCTIONThe purpose of the following essay is to not only examine masksworn by the fallen angels throughout history as well as to examinethe etymology of the spirit of self-liberation and opposition from thepraxis of occult thought. The very passing of power in the Circle ofWitchcraft and Sorcery is the averse way of bringing into unionDaemon and Man, the intent of the Adversary is life and theimmortality of the spirit. As “Luciferian Witchcraft” and “Liber HVHI”provide a foundation of sorcery which incorporates an interwovenpraxis of antinomianism and self-deification, the essential origins ofthe Daemonic Feminine and Masculine should be further understoodby its origins.What is regarded as common knowledge depicts that the Luciferianspirit, what is found are the associative traits and that the Adversaryhas existed long before Christianity. The Avestan texts as well asthe Denkard provide a wealth of knowledge of Ahriman from a righthand path point of view, consider as such a veil which can only bepassed through by the Great Work of initiation.The names and cultural expressions of the Adversary are brieflyexplored as an introduction, from the ancient Persian, Hebraic andeven Norse, the Adversary appears in each. As tempter, war maker,wisdom bringer and devouring predatory spirit. Look to the commonaspects which make the Opposer as a force of initiation.Lucifer/Ahriman/Samael is a spirit which is made viable through theAdept his/herself, this force is expressive of the individual, thus eachmanifestation unique as the initiate in question.THE PRIMAL ABYSS“She filled their bodies with venom instead of blood. She cloakedferocious dragons with fearsome rays And made them bear mantlesof radiance, made them godlike,‘Whoever looks upon them shallcollapse in utter terror!

To raise them as Gods whichshall master all forms of wolves, serpents and those beasts whichprey upon others is the desire of Tiamat. What she gave to humanitywas never cleansed from the ancient darkness in the subconscious,there is still a coiling serpent within.The ancient dragon which personified the primal sea was Tiamat,according to George Barton the name Tiamat was equivalent to thesame stem which meant ‘tamtu’, being the primal waters of theAbyss. Tiamat is the Adversary from a atavistic viewpoint, her formtoo terrible to comprehend. An interesting concept of the demonicfeminine as a motivational factor in all life can be found in thearchetype of Tiamat.The Adversary, long hidden away in a morass of filth by those whowould hate the darkness, those who would commit greater crimes onhumanity and veil such in the words of God. They are indeed old, thetwo-fold principle of darkness, known as the Adversary, call it Samaeland Lilith or the older Ahriman and Jeh, the very isolate God ofDarkness. Tiamat is the very first manifestation of this force, from atime when darkness held in its arms hideous monsters, the verydemonic shapes which still seek our thoughts in the darkest hours ofour mind. In times of stress and turmoil, these atavistic beasts seekto escape from the barbed wire, cruel talons in the mind.The mighty Mummu Tiamat was called the “bringer forth of them all”,yet was equally horrifying to her enemies, Gods she created Tiamatin ancient Assyria embodied all of that which was horrifying andviolent to mankind, from the blackened oceans of the abyss did shefirst rise up, a great sea dragon who had partial elements of otherpredators, the head of a tiger, winged, four talons and a scalecovered tail. This form was that which was from nightmares, whichstill copulates with our dreams and brings us visions of our vastpossibility as living beings.Tiamat was betrayed by her child, Marduk and was joined with him inbattle. In this battle did another plot with Marduk to capture andslay her. When she was cut open, the North Wind bore her blood tosecret places. Gunkel and Bousset describe that Tiamat who was theQueen of the Abyss and darkness, supported by her infernal spiritsrebelled against the higher gods of which Marduk was of.Tabaet is said to be the name of Tiamat, the Book of Enoch"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"mentions this Serpent to not just an abyssic demon, rather a fallenangel who beholds power in the Noon tide sun. The serpent laterwith the use of seduction, tempted mankind to accept the gift of theBlack Flame in the form of an apple, leading to the possibility ofmankind being as Gods if they chose to.Tiamat may be a etymological form of what would become theAdversary as Ahriman/Jahi or Samael/Lilith, the name itself being theenemy of the so-called “righteous”, depending on whoever associateswith the term at that time.THE ORIGINS OF THE ADVERSARYAhriman was first within the womb along with his brother, Ohrmazd.Ohrmazd had overheard Zurvan whisper, 'Whichever of the two shallcome to me first, him will I make king.'. Upon hearing this Ohrmazdtold his brother of this Ahriman ripped from the womb and came forthto his Father Zurvan. It was Zurvan who insulted his son and calledhim dark and stinking but considered the second born, action-lessson Ohrmazd was favored and made sacrifice to his father Zurvan.Ahriman reminded his father of the promise of the first born, but wasgranted a period of time, thus Ahriman went away from those of thearrogant light. Ahriman soon made a pact with his father, which wasmanifest as Az, the bride of darkness.'Pondering on the end, Zurvan delivered to Ahriman an implementfrom the very substance of darkness, mingled with the power ofZurvan, as it were a treaty, resembling coal, black and ashen. Andas he handed it to him he said: \"By means of these weapons, Az(Concupiscence) will devour that which is thine, and she herselfshall starve, if at the end of nine thousand years thou hast notaccomplished that which thou didst threaten- to demolish the pact,to demolish Time.’ - The Dawn and Twilight of ZoroastrianismThe Zurvanites and Zoroastrians held a form of dualism wherein ifone approached from the Zoroastrian view, the power of Ahura Mazdawould be useful in only battling evil, powerless against amaterialistic or spiritual benefit other than using such to keep onefrom temporary torment (the Zoroastrians do not believe in aneternal hell, merely a temporary one once Frashegird arrives). WhenDualism can be overcome, that Ahriman may be recognized in allwhich includes the self firstly, then can one use the power ofdarkness to become strong in both a material sense (if desired) or aspiritual one.Az or Jeh, the whore or demonic feminine, was the 'weapon ofConcupiscence' which “Ahriman chooses it of his own free will 'as his"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"very essence'.”The lightening which emerges from the abyss manifests upon earth,the storm bringing shadow called daemon can be only comprehendedonce the seeker enters the circle, wherein all Gods and Demons meetin the flesh! The Adversary opens forth serpent eyes, finding all inthe primal darkness and with an inner fire awakening the clay onman! Yet it is the compliment of the Masculine in Lilith or Az or theearlier Jahi who is the fiery compliment which rouses her mate tomanifest upon earth!The Feminine which is the essence of Lilith is just as her mateSamael, in the form of Leviathan does she inspire his mind just asfrom his mouth go burning lamps and from his nostrils as smokewhich infused the sacred fire with the adversarial chaos of strife!This primal essence, symbolized as lightening which causes the fireof intelligence is the Alpha of the Adept, the forge of which Cainstretches out a fire-blackened hand to uplift a sword first as artetaught by Gadreel, the shadow-name of the Father of Serpents.There is the immortal spirit which exists in the depths of the mind,guided up through the darkness with an inner fire of Rahab, theangel of violence, whose breath is the lightening of inspiration andself-deification. This ancient spirit rises up from the oceans in ourbodies and envenoms our spirit to the possibilities of our deification!From the great sleep does the Adversary come forth as the balanceof the feminine and masculine, the primal path of the Black and RedSerpent. Rahab, who makes the orbs of light dark with its presence, a shadow cast upon the self-righteous and weak.As Ahriman did he first create the predators of the earth, wolves,serpents, flies, scorpions, did his fire of darkness create the six archdaevaswho bring wisdom and power to mankind, against the mindnumbingarch-angels of Ahura Mazda. Was it not Jahi whose voice ofinspiration rouse the Dragon from his slumber, bringing chaos andmotion into this world? Yet Ahriman brings Order as well, knowingthat stasis is death and the spirit must continually move forward.The Adversary’s origins are found in both the feminine andmasculine, that balance must bring the lively intelligence ofexistence. Here is the sacred cup made from the human skull, todrink of it’s elixir is to taste the lifeforce which illuminates andmakes free the spirit!One may refer to the name of Ahriman or Angra-Mainyu for a sourceof the Adversary on earth. The root of the word Mainyu is theAvestan word, derived from the Latin ‘mens’ meaning the human"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"mind. Angra is “angry” meaning violent motion, determining by Willalone the path and moving against the natural order. Ahriman is thusa powerful sorcerer by defined concept, his bride was the fierymotivation in his spirit and for Ahriman to exist beyond thelimitations of flesh he realized that the fiery aspect was essential tohis motivation.With regard to the Zurvanite view of evolution, Ahriman and AhuraMazda emanated from Zurvan, endless time. Ahriman was essentiallyone who beheld the light from which life could emerge from, howeverit was cloaked in darkness. This light became passed on to thephysical manifestations of Ahriman’s power, wolves, serpents,scorpions, worms, flies and other such creatures were considered ofAhriman.'The twelve Signs of the Zodiac... are the twelve commanders on theside of Ohrmazd, and the seven planets are said to be the sevencommanders on the side of Ahriman. And the seven planets oppressall creation and deliver it over to death and all manner of evil: forthe twelve Signs of the Zodiac and the seven planets rule the fate ofthe world and direct it'.- The Dawn and Twilight of ZoroastrianismOhrmazd and Ahriman both had elements of their being in thecreation and government of the physical and material universe, thusthe Angels and Daevas (demons) were not only emanations fromtheir source, they could be considered to act according to theattributes of their nature, spirit based Daevas were unseen yet hadvery powerful hungers for the human spirit, Vizaresh for instance hadno specific physical attrtibutes but could detect spirits, sat at theMouth of Hell and sought to drag souls into darkness. Material basedDaevas such as Druj Nasu, came in the form of a fly and transformedthe body into dark matter and the spirit into a type of spiritualpredator.THE NAMES AND ETYMOLOGY OF AHRIMAN (SATAN)In Rabbinical, which is old Jewish religious text and Apocryphalwritings, the names of Satan (Adversary) are many. Just as “his”forms are different, so is the source of him, remember that TheAdversary is both of darkness and light and uses elements of both inaccordance with his Will.BELIAL as the name of the Adversary in recent times beenconsidered different from Satan, old grimoire texts mention Belialwas the angel created after Lucifer. Belial is considered by Hebrewtexts to be the father of idolatrous nations, which if you relate thecontext of the early Rabbinical writings on Cain, his “founding of a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"city” is related to “founding a belief system”. As Belial appeared inthe Old Testament, his name has been explained by numerousetymological studies as meaning “wicked” but also one who is theopposer of established authorities. Belial was suggested as meaningin Samuel as the rivers of the underworld, then as a force than aspecific person.The orthography of the Luciferian Path as defined in Michael W.Ford’s Luciferian Witchcraft and Liber HVHI is based – inpart – on thetrans-cultural manifestation of the Adversary throughout time. Belialis held in Hasidic traditions as being identified as a manifestation ofSatan, specifically in the Ascension of Isaiah Belial is called Beliarand is considered the same as Samael, called Malkira or Malak ra theAngel of Lawlessness or Angel of Evil. This name is Sammal Malchiraand is a manifestation of Angro Mainyush or Ahriman.In the Ascension of Isaiah, Belial is called “Beliar; for the angel oflawlessness, who is the ruler of this world” and is called“Mantanbuchus” or Ahriman. In another text, Belial has Seven Spiritsof Deceit which emanate from his being, that is they are connectedwith his existence. In the “Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs” theSeven Demons are identical to the ArchDaevas of Ahriman.“what things I saw concerning the seven spirits of deceit, when Irepented. Seven spirits therefore are appointed against man, andthey are the leaders in the works of youth. [And seven other spiritsare given to him at his creation, that through them should be doneevery work of man. The first is the spirit of life, with which theconstitution (of man) is created. The second is the sense of sight,with which ariseth desire. The third is the sense of hearing, withwhich cometh teaching. The fourth is the sense of smell, with whichtastes are given to draw air and breath. The fifth is the power ofspeech, with which cometh knowledge. The sixth is the sense oftaste, with which cometh the eating of meats and drinks; and by itstrength is produced, for in food is the foundation of strength. Theseventh is the power of procreation and sexual intercourse, withwhich through love of pleasure sins enter in. Wherefore it is the lastin order of creation, and the first in that of youth, because it is filledwith ignorance, and leadeth the youth as a blind man to a pit, andas a beast to a precipice” -THE TESTAMENTS OF THE TWELVEPATRIARCHSThe Septuagint follows a specific Hebraic consideration that Belial,being “Beli’ol” is “The one who has thrown off the yoke of heaven”and is thus without a master.The Luciferian finds connections in the path of history and mythologyand seeks to make them work for he or she in the modern world. The"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"spirit of Belial is of the mastery of the earth, identified with theelement of Earth and the North, from which Ahriman is identical.Consider the four elements however and their association with theAdversary as a spirit of self-deification and self-mastery.SAMAEL is known in the Talmudic texts as being the same as Satan,the chief of Evil Spirits who is known as “The Venom of God”. Samaelis said to have twelve wings rather than the six of normal angels, afavored assumption. As the Angel of Death, Samael was the angel ofpoison which is “sain ha-mawet”, along with Ashmodai, is the Lord ofDemons. Compare to Ahriman and his created daeva Eshm orAeshma, who controls and directs the seven powers of Ahriman.Samael as the Angel of Poison is to the Luciferian as a symbol ofself-mastery and using the world around us to grow in power andstrength, always internal, sometimes external depending on theindividual desire. Luciferians seek to devour the essence of life, theessence of humanity. All life is made stronger by devouring another,this is the law of nature. To be honest to the self, to presentchallenge and overcome such is to attain a foundation upon the pathof mastery.Beelzebub is a name for Satan mentioned in the New Testament withregards to him holding the title of Prince of Demons. The nameBeelzebub or Beelzebuth actually can be derived from Baal Zebub,Baal meaning “Lord” and Zebub which holds reference in Hebrew as“Hostility”, thus Baal Zebub is the “Lord of Hostility” or they enemy,a title of the Opposer.Dominus Muscarum is also a translation of the title of Beelzebub,meaning “Lord of Flies” and relates to the Adversary being in part aspirit of the Air. Baal-Zebub as the name of a God worshipped in thePhilistine city of Ekron around 850 B.C. and was considered acontroller of flies and perhaps plague.If the initiate of the Luciferian Path looks deep within the history ofthe Adversary, little of Christianity may be needed. The Adversary isno Christian creation, nor does it need the concept of “God” as somany have decried. In the West, all Gods and Demons have beentransformed to suit whatever they need it for, such is known as amild case of “Chaos Magick” and thus may be useful. The Luciferianknows the importance of discipline, if you build yourself in the imageof the Adversary with the traits associated with, the Adept will trulybe a God upon this earth.Lilith, known as the Queen of Demons, a bestial body with asometimes beautiful appearance, was called “Mother of Ahriman” andis related to blood sucking vampiric demons and other night spirits."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Lilith is one half of the Adversary is there were, is truly a Satanic orLuciferian source of self-mastery and strength. Lilith is said to howlat the head of 480 companies of demons, having sometimesappearance with a Chariot guided and backed by demonic spirits.Lilith is the fiery aspect of Ahriman or Samael and should beconsidered equal to the Fallen Angel.In ancient non-Zoroastrian writings, M.N. Dhalla makes reference tothe early Hippolytus who wrote that there was a dualistic religion,the father being light and darkness being the mother. With this inconsideration, Ahriman no doubt was a manifestation of theAndrogynous primal dragon Tiamat, which Ahriman and Az emergedfrom later.In the ancient writings of Jacob and Isaac Hacohen of SegoviaCastile, Samael and Lilith were born by an emanation beneath theThrone of Glory in the form of a double-faced androgynous angel,said to be in the form of the one above.Lilith has a long history and a background in all magical practices.She is the one who is of the Astral plane, of the air, and began alllegends of vampiric acts committed at night. Lilith grows strong fromthe blood of humans, but also has been worshiped by rebels sinceBabylonian times. In the Qlippoth Lilith holds great power, “thefemal of Samael is called Serpent, Woman of Harlotry, End of allFlesh, End of Days”.“The name of Baphomet is regarded by Traditional Satanists asmeaning \"the mistress (or mother) of blood\" - the Mistress whosometimes washes in the blood of her foes and whose hands arethereby stained” – Order of Nine AnglesIn some modern Satanic orders, Lilith has appeared as both Babalonand even Baphomet. The Order of Nine Angles related Baphomet asthe Bride of Satan. The dark feminine energies were recognized as avalid magical practice in certain texts, Azanigin being a name of thedark goddess and which such Satanic Magick was practiced. What isunderlying is not what order practices what, rather that the demonicfeminine or the fiery inspiration itself is central to initiatorydevelopment.My grimoires or Books of the Adversary, “Luciferian Witchcraft” and“Liber HVHI” deal exclusively with the dark feminine and masculineas equal forms of the Adversary and Luciferian practice, somethingwhich requires more discipline to work with in terms of initiation as itrequires balance and the application of reason to achieve magicalresults."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"One may consider the demon of the void mentioned in John Dee’sdiaries who is called Coronzom, known by modern Enochian andThelemic students as Choronzon. This demon is considered amadness inspiring beast, causing fragmentation of the mind and theloss of mental vitality. Choronzon in the Black Temple rites of theCharacith Lunar Lodge, from which the author was personallyinvolved in the late 1990’s draw on the energies of Choronzon as aVampire spirit, being something which may be encircled and used asa means of draining the energy or Chi of another through ritualsorcery.Some dogmatic magical practitioners consider Choronzon as a symbolof the false ego or will, which can be viewed by left hand pathpractitioners as residue of the Christianized West, where the self isencouraged to be lost and given to something else called “Godhead”.For some, Choronzon or Coronzom is the Dark Shadow of the Self,the very darkness which the Sorcerer may shape and form accordingto his or her desire.The Ahrimanic or Luciferian knows that the self is the only thing thatis real, as it is the object experiencing all. You can know of sorcerybecause you create results in response to your actions, whilebalancing the spiritual and material. The Hebraic of Choronzon isChVRVNVN and according to Kenneth Grant relates to 333, one halfof 666 with the other being Shugal, the desert howler. As Coronzomis the original name written by Dee, this would add to 323 whichrepresents the Qlippoth of Aquarius which in LIBER HVHI isrepresented as Behemiron, shadows and demonic fragments whichthe sorcerer may utilize to draw energy from.THE ADVERSARY FROM A LEFT HAND PATH PERSPECTIVE\"Our way is all about, in its beginnings, and for those daringindividual who join us, liberating the dark or shadow aspect of thepersonality. To achieve this, we sometimes encourage individuals toundergo formative experiences of a kind which more conventionalsocieties and individuals frown upon or are afraid of......But the strongsurvive, the weak perish.

The Beast headed God has taken many masks in ourworld, the Adversary has also mastered the elements as well.The Adversary is anything but mysticism. When you discoversomething you destroy mysticism, within the circle of Azothoz, youbanish mysticism by obtaining knowledge of the self. Duringpathworkings, camping away from anyone for a period of time,joining the military, doing something which captivates and awakensthe senses, you destroy mysticism.

Mysticism is not-knowing thatwhich cannot be known. A vicious cycle, the new age is trulysomething which is not new, rather a bad filter of what could be awonderful reality.Evil is nothing but an opinion and more or less a perspective of theindividual. The left hand path is defined as the process of selfdeificationand using the energy of the serpent (called Shakti) totransform the consciousness into a timeless being.

It represents the current of what is collectively called“Luciferian”, despite whatever culture it is made manifest in, to useand grow within that dark power. As one moves through theLuciferian path, the initiate becomes like Ahriman yet without theright hand path deficiencies placed upon it in traditional folklore.SOURCES FROM THE AVESTA AND DENKARD“His astral body is that of the frog, the vicious crab.” –GreaterBundahishnAhriman is the sorcerous being which holds within the darkness thegift of life, while his initiation twists and makes a predator of theone who enters the religion of sorcery. Ahriman becomes viablethrough the Adept just as Az or Jeh does. Some initiates of themodern path of Yatuk Dinoih choose a specific daeva to work with,one to cultivate and empower through their own initiation. Thisproves a useful point to which one may gain insight.“Tarik den afraj-pedak” is the dark hell of which Ahriman dwellspartially. It is mentioned in the Bundahishn that the darkness is sothick one may seemingly “cut through it with a knife”. Ahriman is said to have much heat within him, however cold and darkness surrounds him. As with initiation, one enters the darkness which others fear to emerge bearing the same fire of which Az stirs up. “The Five Flames of Ahriman” are described in depth in “LIBER HVHI”.The Avesta is perhaps one of the most powerful Right Hand Pathreligious texts composed. While fragments exist, the entirefoundation of the Avesta is based on prayers and hymns when sungor chanted in a mantra disciplined form, have the ability to create“Staotas” or vibrations in sound. In one may take notice to historicalfoundations of all religions, a major emphasis is upon Sound and theeffect upon those who use or hear it. Sound is essential as it cancreate gateways in the atmosphere, channel and encircle energy andbe sent forth to achieve what you wish. Religious staotas orvibrations of sound may be used to open the mind to subjectiveexperiences which include spiritual meetings, encircling andempowering the self through Daevas and their often dangerouscurrents of energy and much more. The practice of using Staotas“inverse” or backwards from Avestan gathas proves beneficial to theYatus or Sorcerer working in the Ahrimanic gnosis.The Denkard or Dinkart is a collection of Middle Persian writings"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"which hold an earlier significance to the Zoroastrian religion. TheDenkard is an ancient religious doctrine which holds a significantamount of history of the religion and its concepts including that ofthe enemy Ahriman. In early Zoroastrian times it was consideredthat demons or Daevas held sway over man, even making theirabode in the body. The word for this is “katag î nafshâ” meaning“Abode in the soul”. From a left hand path perspective, this act is ofinitiation and should not be avoided.The Denkard describes a secret of the Luciferian power in this world:“Ahriman should be thus cast out from the world; everyone for thesake of self shall extract (him) from the body, since Ahriman has hisabode in human bodies in this world. Consequently, when he has nolodgment in the bodies of men, he will be exterminated from thewhole world; since so long as in the body of any one whatever inthis world a dwelling is made by a (druj), Ahriman (will be) in theworld.” – The Denkard, Book 6: Wisdom of the SagesThus it may be seen that Ahriman is manifest through the sorcerersand initiates of the path. This is the center of the conceptualfoundation of the work of Luciferian Witchcraft and Liber HVHI, tomanifest the Adversary in the individual within their own uniquevisage.SORCERY AND AHRIMANThe literary foundations of LIBER HVHI and the “Yatuk Dinoih” and“Paitisha” found in LUCIFERIAN WITCHCRAFT are found partially inthe Avesta, this is perhaps one of the most significant and powerfulmethods described in magical practice. While ignored, the Avestaholds in its obscure texts right hand path teachings of ritualcommunion with Ahura Mazda. While the Ahrimanic work of theDaeva-yasna is indeed left hand path in approach, the Avestanstaotas and ritual mantras were inversed and transformed intohymns to Ahriman and the Daevas, which are in direct association tothe body and spirit of the Sorcerer. This is in effect, Chaos Sorcerywith defined purpose.In the Avesta, Ahriman is said to be “Full of Death”, from aninitiatory perspective, death is transformation and not an end itself.Ahriman holds “Evil Knowledge” and seeks to manifest the “EvilReligion”.“It is when a man here below, combing his hair or shaving it off, orparing off his nails, drops them in a hole or in a crack” Avesta -VenidadIn Luciferian Witchcraft, the Yatuk Dinoih has a ritual of evocation inwhich the sorcerer makes a sacrifice of nail parings or hair into a dark"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"place in the earth, a crack or hole wherein by such Daevas areproduced in the soil. One may go further to utilize the forces ofchaos to bury nail clippings in some container with soil and within aperiod of one moon unearth them to use them as knives and spearsin a cursing or death-causing ritual, it is suggested in the Venidadthat such nails empowered by Daevas makes knives and falconedwinged arrows which strike the sheep of the righteous.Plutarch wrote of the rituals of the Daeva-yasna in old times, thatthey would sacrifice the blood of wolves to Ahriman by pouring suchwith herbs into the dark place, a hole or cave where the sun does notshine.“unabated by Akem-mano, by the hardness of his malignant riddles”–Avesta – VenidadThe staota or mantra which channels and focuses energy by sound isa tool of initiatory focus in all cultures from Tibetan to Christian,being the encircling of sound to create a desired gnosis. The use ofsound creates vibrations which can affect the individual to achieve aspiritual or elevated state, depression or any state seeminglydesired by the tonal and vibratory frequency. Such soundmanipulation can be proven in Binaural Beats of PHI frequencies,created by two frequencies operating in different ears to create abrainwave corresponding to an emotion. The PHI brainwave frequencyis the actual difference of the two different frequencies in each ear.The use of sound in ritual is empowering, it activates theimagination and allows belief to fully overtake and thus command.The chanting within the circle of art is merely the self awakening intognosis and directly ensorcelling the self in belief of the act fromwhich magick occurs.“The Druj came rushing along, the demon Buiti, who is deceiving,unseen death” – Avesta – VenidadBuiti is a daeva which is the manifestation of idolatry and selfdeification,associated with Buddha in ancient times. As “LIBERHVHI” presents the path of meditation, self-mastery throughAhrimanic Yoga, Buiti is the herald of that path of Magick. If onewishes to master elements of such antinomian magick, it issuggested to study the techniques of Yoga while concealing theintention of becoming a Yatus or a practitioner of the Left HandPath. While the Buddhist seeks to kill consciousness, the Daeva Buitiseeks to master it, to strengthen and expand the concept of “I”.
