No doubt you have considered what it would be like to fly in the night, drain another of energy and live like a God or Goddess. If applied, this grimoire may help you. I strongly advise that you be of sound mind and to have begun a basic study or practice as defined in BOOK OF THE WITCH MOON, LUCIFERIAN WITCHCRAFT and LIBER HVHI – Magick of the Adversary as these books will prepare you. The Vampyre Magickian is indeed one who has stepped beyond the foundations of the Luciferian Path. The model of this path is based in more advanced Magick and Sorcery techniques, which may be dangerous as well. I caution the use of this tome and suggest you not misuse it – it can cause many issues if responsibility is not practiced. The Vampyre Magickian takes the individual and transforms – it awakens you and will require that you shed the beliefs of your past. You will become something better. This will definitely offer a short cut in your initiatory focus – in an age of a “want it now” but the price is diving into the abyss – and having the will to emerge as a devouring god or goddess. You may wish to use some of these techniques, or all of them as a practitioner on the Luciferian Witchcraft Circle – this is entirely up to you. Be sure as you will grow from it and become something better – if not more balanced from the process itself. Notice the spelling of “Vampyre”, denoting the old spelling – a necromantic call to the origins and foundation – a predator if you will. The Vampyre Magickian does not drink physical blood, rather he or she is focused on Chi or Prana, astral energy. Enjoy, may the night embrace you under Lilith’s caress.... "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 A WORD OF WARNING: THE VAMPIRE GATE – The Vampyre Magickian is controversial in design and nature, it is not specifically a part of every Luciferian thought-pattern or practice. This grimoire is meant for those who seek a more permanent paradigm in the design of the possibility of spiritual immortality. The Dark Magicks presented here are actual and empowering, yet may find issue with those depending on their own practice and focus. I wanted to present a methodology of Vampyric Practice to those daring enough to become through it. The main canon of Luciferian Witchcraft is indeed LUCIFERIAN WITCHCRAFT, BOOK OF THE WITCH MOON and LIBER HVHI – all three make specific reference to the type of magickal practice here – some may find the ciphers which lead one to the threshold of the Crooked Serpent. VAMPYRISM WARNING: this book is a grimoire. It gives practical instructions on the possibility of sorcerous practice from a Luciferian perspective. It is not evil or simply destructive. The most powerful message that can be received in this work is that of creation. The Vampyre Magickian should create as opposed to destroying. The author and publisher accept no responsibility for use/misuse of this book. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 VAMPYRISM & THE ASTRAL PLANE This book will introduce you to the modern relevance and the possibility of the reality of vampirism. This practice of vampirism is based on the Nietzsche and Darwin foundations of survival of the fittest. The Vampyre Magickian as it is defined here is within the realm of the Luciferian ideology and practice outlined in LUCFERIAN WITCHCRAFT, LIBER HVHI and BOOK OF THE WITCH MOON. This dark magickal path is not necessarily a path which all Luciferians must seek, but if the spirit is within them, they may do so. This ideological process stands on the foundations that: 1. You are the only God that is. 2. All Deific Masks, Archetypes, powers or spirits must manifest through you. Therefore, to remain in your consciousness, you must be the strongest to keep your foundation identity. See #1. 3. As a Luciferian your primary focus is the retention of knowledge that through experience it becomes wisdom, with that the assumption of power first internally and then externally as you see fit. The Vampyre Magickian is indeed Luciferian, there is no difference in the ideological foundations. Lucifer in the grimoire tradition of the middle ages is considered a spirit of the air, as his element is Air just as his Bride Lilith, additionally he is the bringer of light as his direction is the east. Lucifer as a vampyric spirit"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 is Ahriman the Prince of Darkness. His wisdom is infernal and is hidden. All symbolism of Vampyrism or Vampirism as it is spelled is reflective of the spirit and astral plane. The name Lucifuge means “Fly the Light” and reflects the nocturnal nature of many Luciferian spirits. Just as Lucifer was the brightest of angels, upon his initiation and fall he was encircled in darkness. Thus he has the highest articulation and knowledge, the deviation and perverseness of the darkest aspects. He is both beast and serpent and he may take many forms as well. Lucifer is Proteus and changes at will. The Astral plane when entered will provide an exciting and challenging initiatory experience. You must be willing to trust your instincts and above all know yourself. Astral beings may experience the past – like recordings in specific areas, pass through walls and enter dark places just as a spirit. This of course depends on the initiatory level of the Vampyre Magickian. Much of this type of practice will indeed take time and focus to achieve. Projecting your consciousness out of your body can be a frightening experience at first. Learn to control your breathing, heart rate and to trust your instincts. This will provide you with a powerful method of practice and more than anything help achieve results. As you enter the astral plane, your mode of focus is of course consuming energy in this state. As your"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 consciousness moves out of your physical shell, you will no doubt be exposed to the astral plane as it is. There is no set or defined elements within the astral plane – there are predators though. In this initiatory process, you will align your mind set as a Vampyre Magickian or Sorcerer, thus creating the part for you to become a predator yourself. Your physical body is surrounded and connected by an astral body. This is slightly larger than the physical and can be seen in ritual settings, some types of photography and by certain settings of light. The astral body is affected by the food, mental state, psychical health and more. If you are impaired physically, you need not be in the astral plane. This is the process of developing the will. Those who utilize the ritual practice of shape shifting understand, your limitations are set by you. This goes back to “You are the only God that is” and that before you can experience something more spiritual, you have to realize that you control the extent and power of your destiny. Platonist philosopher Plotinus (A.D. 203-269) defined specific levels of our universe. While they may or may not be valid, they are important in our study and definitions of subjective practice: 1. The World of Matter. 2. The soul-world or spirit of the material universe. This looks downward into matter. 3. The Higher Spirit-world, that looks upward. This would be defined in Luciferian Witchcraft as"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 Azal’ucel, or the Higher Intellect – Holy Guardian Angel. 4. Nous or the eternal blessedness, in short – not some spiritual nirvana but in Luciferian terms the level of wisdom of possessing this world both materially and spiritually. The physical or world of Matter is that of Ahriman the Prince of Darkness. Our material universe is our grounding and experience plane which can be agreed upon. The astral plane is the next level of experience, where consciousness or the psyche is cloaked and released from the flesh limitations of this world. The foundations of vampirism within the practice of Luciferian Witchcraft are based within the study and conventional understanding of The Odic Force, Qi, Chi or Astral Energy. Understanding the concept and study of this process is fully made manifest in the process of vampirism and the absorbing of energy. Qi is the Far Eastern concept of spiritual life force, or energy. This word is commonly referred to or related to the word ‘air’ which can mean astral energy as well. One of the earliest mentioning of Qi is in the Analects of Confucius composed around 479 B.C. The concept of Qi or Chi is indeed lifebreath, the essence of life itself. In the practice of Yoga, specifically, Ahrimanic Yoga, the Luciferian controls the flow of lifebreath throughout their body, growing stronger from refining the flow of this energy through the different chakras. While Qi can be controlled, it is a part of the universe and thus may be absorbed and used magickally. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Qi was written about by the Chinese philosopher Mo Di and noxious vapors that would arise from a corpse were it not buried deep enough. Later Qi was understood as being a part of everything in the material and even spiritual world. Qi was best understood as the energy surrounding the human body, slightly larger than the physical body. Qi is the etheric body, the astral essence which maintains the human body. It can be directly controlled by the mind. Psychic energy or the energy surrounding the human body is transferred from what we eat to energy through resting or sleeping. When a Vampyre feeds in astral form at night, they are gaining a replenished system of energy which is very pure. The Luciferian must have a clear point of focus on how this practice of vampirism works in day to day life. This will be a foundation for those beyond any specific magical practice to establishing a working mind set in predatory spiritualism. The Luciferian understands that devouring spiritual energy is a powerful aspect in magick, it is easily validated from a subjective experience, yet such power comes with a price. If you abuse it, no doubt will you find much loss and pain on the path – you will in turn be devoured. Vampirism is a predatory spiritual path – yet it is not an absolute. Luciferians as predators or Vampyre Magicians are able to hold lasting relationships – we do not prey on each other – we don’t harm people or"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 act outside of the laws of our government.

We are the People of the Lie (Druj), we are the those of demon-flesh – awakened and ancient, forever seeking to further illuminate the Black Flame. Our religion is Sorcery, that which is ensorcelled by our practice of Yatuk-Dinoih (Witchcraft). Life is the great gift of Ahriman, as isolate consciousness (the soul or psyche) is separate from the Natural Order. The BLACK ORDER OF THE DRAGON is entirely spiritual in nature, aimed at the theory of gaining immortality via the psyche. It is the physical path of exhaustion, of when the spirit and flesh are one and become stronger with insight and determination. The core essence of the serpent is the Eye which hides within the flesh. Therein is the power Ch’an, of nothingness and silence..

"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 Luciferian Will and Immortality The Will of the Luciferian is essential in the development of the mind and body of the practitioner of vampirism. The Black Order of the Dragon recognizes both the masculine and feminine demonic archetypes of the path of Luciferian Witchcraft, namely Samael and Lilith. In the auspices of the Vampyric Path, it is Ahriman (the Black Dragon) and Tiamat (the Red Dragon). While Tiamat in this aspect is the primordial form of Lilith, she appears “Black” from the wisdom of endless time. It is that Samael, Lilith and Leviathan are joined in primal union – hence Tiamat is the collected Sumerian Adversary. She is the mother of darkness, dragons and vampirism. Vampirism is a concept which begins in the subconscious. It is a power which hungers, that which seeks to consume all. It has no concern for rules or for the spiritual laws – it is the essence of the law of the talon. This very hunger is related to Az or Lilith, symbolically Tiamat, it is the hunger for continued existence in this physical or spiritual world. This hunger, is manifest in our desire to achieve our goals in this life – to possess life and to become masters of this world. This is why the symbols in Luciferian Witchcraft are strong – Belial, the Lord of the Earth is one such symbol of power and strength. Predatory Spirituality, the instinctual spiritual faith of devouring and absorbing spirits via the practice of magick, defines the characteristics of the Luciferian who seeks to be as a God. Vampirism or Vampyrism, depending on your preference, is neither a fantasy"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 path nor one of role playing. The Luciferian continually seeks to develop and refine the self, via magick and real world experience, eventually practicing a path close to that of the Black Order of the Dragon. 1. All living beings continue existence by feeding on another. We are predators, as Luciferian, we acknowledge the power of the archetype of strength. Samael or Ahriman is indeed a symbol of strength and cunning. The food chain should never be ignored. You can adhere to predatory spirituality and still be a very productive member of society. The Luciferian weaves their webs within the fabric of the society they live in. A Luciferian who is “Belial-like” or “A Lord of the Earth” would not be a prisoner because they cannot obey laws, a good example of a Luciferian is one who runs a successful business or is the head of a charity for battered women. Prey are the weak, predators are the strong. It is as simple as that. 2. Look for ways to always gain knowledge. Experience is the pathway to initiation. Look for wisdom from experience, always test yourself in this way – long trips, extensive exercise to your capacity, college or specific areas of learning – in short, challenge yourself. Building the mind builds the Immortal Spirit. 3. Qi or Life Energy is around all of us. Drain it and grow strong from it. You absorb energy from focus itself – using Aighash, the Persian Demon of the Evil Eye – the Eye represents the soul, use this to mentally connect with everything around you. One of our"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 symbols, Aapep or Apophis, is the Devil Serpent of Ancient Egypt. We seek to feast and drain on life force, on the astral plane and in the flesh. To join us is to be hidden mostly in society, to be the wolf among sheep. Humanity seeks eternally a safety net; a God to believe will save their souls, all the while sending tsunamis, hurricanes, blizzards, and all conceivable disasters upon its own creation. Would this be a spirit you would open your arms to? Does it help you to know that while you sleep, your dreams grow heavy with the failures and shortcomings of a world around you? The Iron Age is here, Kali is awakened and she is very thirsty. Mediocrity has always been accepted, yet by it being perceived and related to, it is consumed and considered acceptable. Remind yourself of the so-called American “slacker” generation, the wonderful nineteen nineties, when if being a college student, it was smiled upon to be someone who continually seeks to underachieve. Is this a highlight of our culture? We live in a world which views a natural disaster yet still finds a way to blame “someone”. We did not do enough to warn them, we did not help fast enough, everyone should have moved faster? Why is this? That nature devours and cleanses a bit of the earth, actually a small fraction we must rush to blame others? Nature dictates survival; this life is the only flesh you will have. Make the best of it. How can one make the best of their life? How does one find the strength to mutate into something else? What is a Luciferian, a Satanist, a Vampire.

Those who balance spiritual hope, desire and equal it with their creative Will to become and manifest their wishes on earth. This short tome will be hated; humans hate the idea of something better or the possibility of self improvement. Save it for a new year some will say, “This year I will lose weight”, “this year I will finish this project”, you hear the sheep sound this off. Yet they always fall into the possibility which they strive for – failure. TIAMAT It all starts with the acknowledgement that you are alone and have the potential for Self-Deification (Godhood). Tiamat is the first power of draconian darkness, the vampire which is the primal union of Lilith and Samael, guided by Leviathan. She is before all others. Tiamat was in the form of a giant dragon, a sea dragon who had the head of a griffin or tiger, wings, claws and a scaly tale. She appears also as a giant serpent. Tiamat resembles the legends of Ahriman as the Dragon. Here is the Adversary, she is the Night and the Abyss. Tiamat can give life and create what she wishes, much like Ahriman created the ArchDaevas to counter creation. Tiamat was a sorceress, a powerful first Witch who was both Vampire and Goddess to all. The demonic feminine is equally important to the Adversarial formula in Luciferian Witchcraft as it is the balance which acknowledges the female generative principle as the foundation of all actions and purpose. The associative name of Tiamat was Tamtu, both names referring to the primeval sea and the dragon"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 which personified it. Tiamat is thus very close to the idea of the Hebraic Leviathan, the Dragon of the Abyss. The Sea is also connected to the abyss and thus the subconscious. In Corey’s “Ancient Fragments” and George Barton’s TIAMAT, The creation and origin of Tiamat was that there was a time when there was nothing but darkness and the abyss of waters, where two hideous beings who were produced from a two-fold principle. There were also men who had wings, or two faces, one body or who had both sexes and the legs of a goat, horns or were serpent like, dragon-men. Over these presided Omoroca, being Ummu Khubur or Tiamat, the Mother of darkness. Tiamat was exalted to the rank of divinity, called “The god who has taken hold of evil”, that she remained in darkness and controlling the forces of chaos. Tiamat was indeed a powerful goddess, a sorcerous being who could create fierce monsters and empower them accordingly. In her battle against the Gods including Marduk, Tiamat first created vampiric beings. It was written that she beget serpents who were unsparing of fang and sharp of tooth. She filled their bodies with venom instead of blood, initiating transformation. “The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him” – Revelations. Tiamat cloaked ferocious dragons in fearsome rays, that she encircled them in the Luciferian Light, they"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 bore mantles of radiance (Black Flame) and made them Godlike. Tiamat thus lifted up Kingu or Qingu as the Leader of these Vampiric beings, she cast a spell which made him the Lord of the Gods, his word would be Law and she gave him the Tablet of Destinies. Kingu went forth to battle and was later defeated. His blood was used to beget the human race according to legend. Let’s consider the path of Tiamat and its relation to vampirism and the Luciferian Path. Rahab is a name associated with dragon and serpent, such is associated as an antagonist against the associated “god” of the Hebraic and early Christian culture. The primal dragon is an atavistic1 force in the blood, brain and deepest memories of the human race. As Tiamat was of the first, this force arises again in the Judeo-Christian texts of Revelations, as the “Behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns” Here we see the manifestation of Samael or Lucifer as the great Dragon, no doubt a calling from the abyss. The abyss is of course symbolic of the subconscious. Let us look inward at the relation of the dragon, as opposed to some outward possibility. The Abyss is considered “evil” as like the Ocean, mankind cannot control it or force restrictions on it. To be within the abyss is to dwell in the dreams of the mind. In our dreams, we can form our desires on a pathway to becoming flesh or reality. Sorcery is a term which denotes encircling, casting lots and visualizing   1 'the deep things of Satan,' – Revelations. Ch.2"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 the result. If you lay out conditions to occur, aligning situations to move in this direction, this is indeed sorcery. Rituals align thought and some believe the astral is controlled by this subconscious activated force. One should think in terms of being a manifestation of this Dragon, for instance: “I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names. The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.” – Revelations The Beast or Dragon, much like the Assyrian Tiamat of old, can represent the Luciferian who has mastered the aspects of Ahrimanic Yoga, that is the power of the demons of the flesh and mind. The control of demons in the body relate to the chakra points which can be focused to heighten individual mind and body power. This can be affected by astral energy – life energy or Chi as it is called. The sea is a source of evil as all is up to the taking – reality can be shaped by dreams. Think about that sentence carefully. What you think can be done today can be made reality tomorrow. Let’s consider the focus phrase of The BLACK ORDER OF THE DRAGON: "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 The Words of the Dragon Tiamat I am that which you hide away from others I am the Eye which seduces all within its gaze. I am the voice of which power is formed. I am the thought of which is exist beyond flesh. We are legion yet we come from one source. There is only one from within you. You are the point and the beginning, Azothoz as the devourer. In nature can you understand my spirit in all things. In doing such you will understand yourself. In understanding yourself you will be able to utilize all of your senses and develop skills to master what you Will in this world. As we see that Tiamat is the Goddess of chaos, the oceans of the subconscious Kingu represents her empowered Will to Form in life. The Dragon is intense possibility, waiting for its means to become real by your desire and belief. With the Tiamat – foundation of vampirism, you may more easily move through the Egyptian or Ahrimanic aspects of Luciferian Sorcery – to utilize the predatory spiritual aspects of each. ENERGY AND BLOOD – Life Essence As we have made reference to Qi or Chi, astral energy. Life energy is taken from human beings without harming them. Life energy is the aura and the very essence which is slightly larger than the human body. The mind directly influences the amount and strength of this Chi energy. Whether you find subjective confirmation in the existence of Chi or not, please take note of the psychological foundations of Predatory"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 Spiritualism. This process aligns the mind to a specific type of Luciferian thinking – a way of approach. Approaching things in a certain way will effect what you get in return. If you start a small building project for your house because you want a recording room – you will no doubt work with a higher sense of urgency than if you are building it for your annoying aunt who is coming to live with you. The Power of Positive thinking means a lot, anyone as a Luciferian should approach life in a positive and productive way. Control of emotions is essential in any successful magical practice. With the psychological and otherwise possible dangers in the Luciferian path, it is important to have the control approach to the actual practice. A good place to start is Ahrimanic Yoga as described in LIBER HVHI. The Chakras are important in channeling and focusing Chi and the associations of the ArchDaevas therein. To start with Taromati, moving upward through the spine will certainly activate a sense of calm and empowerment in the sorcerer. This will give a feeling of rising and elevation as you move up to each additional chakra. The Luciferian who visualizes the twin serpents coil upward around the spine, out of the shoulders and the connection to Akoman in the Ajna Chakra and shortly after the Ahriman aspect above will no doubt hold some results driven workings. Control of nervous movements is also important in the storing and strength foundation of the Chi energy from not only the chakras but the astral body as well.

You may try this before sleeping; it provides a powerful preparation and relaxation practice which will fuel your dreams or nightmares. As in the Luciferian Path, it is essential to the slowed study and planning of your short and long term planning. This means school, career and what you want to do with your life. A practitioner of the Luciferian path will balance the spiritual and material to their own end – not focusing too much on one to stop the other. In terms of magical practice, the Luciferian would implement the practice of magick and sorcery based on the ends they wish to achieve. There is no specific or set practice to proceed – the grimoires offered are suggestions based on practice rather than defined dogma – do what works for you. ASTRAL PROJECTION Astral projection is a process of Magick in which change begins within the self first. In order to prepare your initiatory experience if you chose in Vampyric Magick or Sorcery, it is imperative that you align your mind with forces which are in direct control of the self. Firstly, one must prepare under the process of Asana, or Posture. A posture which relaxes your body to the point of where you can feel energy flow between you and the air around you. Often, Ahrimanic Yoga (LIBER HVHI) will give a foundation for which you may afterwards get in a more relaxed and focused state of mind."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 When preparing to project, keep the spine straight and lay in a position with your arms and legs held straight out – your arms should be resting at your side. Focus on rising up out of your body. An excellent method of developing this is to slow your heart rate by breathing exercises, much of which will control your initiatory advancement upon the Luciferian or Vampyre Magickian Path. Breathe steadily and control your stillness and state of mind. Preparing the Luciferian Spirit In Luciferian Witchcraft, Liber HVHI and all of my other works, there are a handful of rituals and mantras which will focus the mind. Let’s try a more simple, perhaps direct means of preparing the mind. 1. Facing East, have an image of Lucifer as the Bringer of Light on the wall. Have a candle of black on the wall representing the Black Flame, balanced wisdom gained. 2. Take your attention to Lucifer as manifesting everything powerful and light based in your life – that source of strength, invigorating inspiration and power as you can see it. Lucifer as the initiator brings awareness and self-realization – that you can be the God or Goddess and free from yoke or a master. The path involves balancing the demonic and angelic in the self – in short using both aspects equally. 3. Lucifer is the bringer of light which establishes all wisdom and knowing, this is the flowing Lion-Serpent who is of the Sun and the Darkness of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 Night. Let us first establishing the foundation of the Luciferian Guide – the Light. The Black Flame glows and illuminates in you, the Luciferian Spirit surges and is encircled around your being. You do not allow this energy to escape, instead spiral it through your chakras and then up upon the crown of your skull. Once this is established move it downward again through a cycled, repetitive motion of spiral force. This serpent power will establish power in your astral body. 4. Begin a careful focus of this light within your Ajna center – between the eyes. Imagine this Black Flame burn so great that it cast a long shadow on all around you. You are the greatest light bearer of them all. Now you can see there is no other being as bright as you – alone and without any other God. Does it feel so bad after all? 5. Do not allow this great light to expand higher than your crown chakra, you are not stop the process of self-deification, but later test it and strengthen it. Imagine this light can awaken others, that you are fair and beautiful. That there is a strong reason for all love and happiness to surround you. 6. This essence of the Black Flame, this light, as it grows brighter will begin to cast darker shadows, but also magnify darkness around you until your body itself is cloaked. Purple and bluish lightning will electrify the room as it strikes down from this great light. Focus the light to move downward through your material body, through your limbs and surrounding your shell."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 7. Once you have done this, now you visualize your astral body looking unto another angel in front of you. It is not as bright yet in a challenging pose. Visualize your brilliance of being take hold of it and begin ripping it’s essence out as a ball of light from its chest. You shall taste it with your astral mouth, which quickly elongates and sharpens into a draconian fanged serpent – your entire astral body turns black and red, the colors of predatory strength. Your inner light is hidden and encircled by darkness, Ahriman awakes within. As you transform you can feel the burning fire of life, the hunger for more life.

Focus on the balance of your inner light and darkness, how you may motivate your light to control and shape the darkness based on what you wish to achieve. Say in your mind: “By the Essence of Lucifer am I God. I will devour as much energy as I can. I am both as Lucifer and Ahriman, Lilith and the darkness of night. I will cast aside doubt and illusion and devour the hindering light of God until I am unchallenged!” MOVING THE ASTRAL BODY Sit in a chair, legs directly in front of you and finger tips touching each other.

Pressing your fingers together you will want with each exhale to watch and visualize your astral energy to flow through your fingers. This process should continue for several minutes.

This will take some practice but extending the astral from your own body you will notice the tendril can be controlled by your will alone. SERVITOR CREATION AND ASTRAL ENTITIES Creating a servitor is not a simplistic task – but if successful is very useful in evocation sorcery. The Vampyre Magickian who is able to create a vampiric servitor must utilize caution – such an entity is mindless and is connected to the mind itself, proper foundations in banishing and absorbing should be known and practiced to absorb the servitor accordingly.

If you are able to grasp this with ease, you may find further use and power with BOOK OF THE WITCH MOON. Servitors should relate the Vampyric approach you will want to take. The servitor will be used to feed from another so it should have visualized attributes similar to a vampiric shadow – perhaps animalistic, bestial, bat like or like a skeleton or corpse. It may be as horrific or as beautiful as you wish. CREATING A SERVITOR The servitor should be bound to some object. Perhaps you can create an object or use a photo copy of an image – put some aspects of something with it like a bat, leather backing to symbolize wings, animal fangs, etc. You will want to then use saliva, blood or sexual fluid to consecrate and give the servitor the charge of your own being. 1. Create an object for the servitor – it should be based on what you want the servitor to embody. 2. Light a single candle, you may use Karezza or non-climaxing ritual masturbation to charge the servitor. Anoint the sigil-object with something of you – blood, fluid or saliva. 3. You must name the servitor – for instance, calling it NOXUMBRA would be useful if you are using it at night to drain from someone. You will want to hold the sigil and focus your astral body flowing into it, giving it the initial charge it needs."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 4.

Visualize now the sigil of the servitor you have created, holding it send it outward into the Varcolaci-Astovidad sigil through the center of the pentagram. You may use this servitor to see, project your consciousness through it and move towards your chosen victim. If it is around 3 am, they will be sleeping more than likely. If not, you will have to choose a cycle close to when they will be in deep sleep. Send the servitor forth; recall it after a period of 15 minutes or so.

The Luciferian spirit is centered in the element air, thus relating to the astral body itself. The Witches Sabbat in the Luciferian Witchcraft tradition is founded in the dreaming or astral conclave, the subjective experience from which a level of initiation occurs. The Sabbat is a reality, yet it lies behind a veil found. As Tiamat is the Goddess of Vampires, the method of sorcery of draining astral energy should be practiced in everyday life – while secretly, with the intent of immortality. Much of the practice of Vampyrism or Vampirism from a Luciferian focus is based around the Ahrimanic daevas, yatuk dinoih. One may practice vampirism in the following manner: 1. Physical contact (handshake, brush up against, handing something to individual) 2. Sight (imagine a serpent extending from your body to enter their body, draining life force with the eye) – this is of Aighash, Ahrimanic Daeva. 3. Ritual setting (in ritual chamber, using image or word created image to focus the mind on.) This is focused on Akoman the Evil Mind. 4. Dreaming or Nightmare practice. Perhaps the most powerful but also the most difficult. This belongs to Astwihad the Evil Flyer of night devouring daeva. Mal’occhio is the evil eye. The evil eye has long been a symbol of envy but also power. The eye represents the soul and the stronger the glare, the stronger the spirit."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 In Yatukan or Persian Ahrimanic or primal sorcery, there are several daevas of the evil eye: Sur Chashmih/Chishmak, Arashk and Aighash. Akoman’s symbol is often an Eye representing “The Evil Mind”. Hakim Bey wrote that the Yezidi tribes would be cautious not to wear Blue, as it is the color of Shaitan, their lord. It was agreed that wearing this color to ward off ‘evil’ would be offensive. In many rituals in THE BOOK OF THE WITCH MOON specifically LIBER NEHEBKAU, the Tuats or underworld ‘hells’ of ancient Egypt have serpent-devils who seduce with their Eye and devour. Draining energy is best done by the connection to sight. In a crowded room, a concert, a mall, a gathering point watch for those who exhibit a lot of charisma and energy – lock into their solar plexus with your eyes, watch then their breathing cycle. With your breathing, draw in and imagine their life essence draining into your being. The significance of the Luciferian path in relation to vampirism is devouring God. Appling Darwinist principles in this magical process will aid the initiatory path of becoming a being like Lucifer in the capacity in which you seek to be. It is essential to focus on accumulating enough energy to further develop yourself towards devouring Godhead.

PHYSICAL ENERGY VAMPYRISM - Touch This type of vampyrism is the process which requires a discipline to practice, a feeding focus with those whom you come into contact with. This energy, once you have reached into their energy field, will flow into your own astral body with your breath. The very importance of practicing yoga and the discipline associated with it will teach you the points of bodily and mental control. 1.

This may include photo but could be a drawing or name written on paper, depending on your ability and predilection. If you have something of your chosen, have it in the rite – hold it and focus upon it. 2.

Drain and leave the victim sleeping. VAMPYRISM AND NOCTURNAL FEEDING The Vampyre Magickian who is preparing to feed must establish who will be fed from. Once this has been determined, the Magickian must practice a form of mediation to gain control of the body and further strengthen the subconscious desire to drain. At the point of sleep, your focus should be on the one you intend to visit. Remember, the goal is never to harm another – it is to drain enough energy to grow strong from without harming your subjects own astral energy. Balance and know your limitations. Astral Forms- Hag – Sexual desire – the hag inspires nightmares and the vampire who projects in this form causes terror in the victim which spills out astral energy, the hag then drains this energy before releasing and flying out. Think about your flesh wrinkling, graying in color, eyes burning black.. Wolf or Werewolf-Intense sexual desire and lust or aggression.

Attractive Spirit- Usually a Out of Body Experience Vampyre who either feels guilty about their practice of energy draining or is seeking another affectionately in dreams – generally non-threatening. Shadow or Black Shape- Fear inspiring vampyre, those who unconsciously project or are seeking energy without thought for shapeshifting. Demonic form-Appearing in atavistic forms, this vampyre is hungering for life energy and generally appears in astral conclaves or Witches Sabbat’s. When practicing the astral ritual of the vampyre, you must lock in to the astral body of the one you seek. Reach in, visualize this before you sleep and drink deep from the sleeper. The sensations of reaching into the astral body are both electrifying and powerful. The vampyre must ensure that their own body is not drained into the victim, rather the control and unconscious discipline keeps the astral vampyre focused and directed towards one goal. Once you have established the person of your desire, you will want to prepare both the body and mind for the working. Do note that no matter what people want to believe, the mind is directly affected by the body and its state therein.

Recite quietly with a candle for working: “Lilith, Satrina, Abyzou and all of thy names, Mother of Night and Vampiric Hunger, Bless my spirit with the gift of flight. Lilith, Mother of Air Spirits, I shall go forth in the form of my choosing to drink of the life in the night” As you grow more adept with astral projection you will be able to rise from the flesh and take the form you wish. As a Luciferian or spirit of Lilith, you may wish to take demonic forms – if you wish to crawl on the roof of the one in which you will drink from, you may wish to have insect legs. If you have a favorite totem animal, it may be a combination of that and something else. As you lay back in your bed or chamber, complete the steps of stillness and with your breathing, imagine your astral body twisting and mutating into that form you wish – move the center of it, where your consciousness is projected, upward through your throat.

ABSORBING ASTRAL ENERGY You will want to begin the process of moving the astral tendrils from your body and extend out. You may try this process at first by moving throughout the room and onward. As you come into the place of the chosen vessel, reach down to their side. If they are barely sleeping, your presence may startle them awake. If so, you may be cast back into your body. As you grow comfortable with this magickal type of working you may reside and observe them, your presence perhaps even frightening them as they cannot see but sense you. It is that uneasy feeling often obtained from being in so-called haunted locations or during a ritual. Allow yourself to move down to the sleeping person and their unconscious mind will most likely respond and you will see it in their astral body. It may ripple and retract from you.

There is no desire for the other which detracts from the mastery of the physical, rather a careful balance. Luciferians are by all account spiritual in nature, by sorcery we encircle our desire and belief through gnosis, utilize meditation techniques and aethyrs within the subconscious. By all these things, we never abandon the physical or the realities of our existence. The spirit of Angra Mainyu = Ahriman, is darkness and shadow. Luciferians are deeply involved in the methods of sorcery and their own brands of witchcraft. Darkness and shadow is expanded by the brightness of our illumination, thus wisdom begets darkness. One aspect of the Black Order of the Dragon is to illuminate this light within each Adept, to compliment an independent and ‘opposer’ type of individual.

Vampirism – Vampiric practice is the act of devouring/drinking or encircling and consuming energy, life force called Chi or Ki. Lifeforce is the vital energy which flows through our body. It is directly associated with the body in terms of what we eat, our mental state and emotions. In the practice of Ahrimanic Yoga in Liber HVHI, the Chakras are stirred or awakened by the fire snake visualized in meditation and practice. By connecting with the chakras, the ArchDaevas, being centers and deific masks of power, may be encircled and cultivated within the mind and body. This awakens points of serpent-power as it is called, when directed out in magickal practice no matter if it is sorcery to obtain a physical result or one to initiate self-transformation (they are usually connected in some way) this energy is vital. Chi also direct affects the Aura. Depression, anger and over excitability will cause this energy to be used up carelessly and without purpose. Have you not noticed when you exercise you feel vital and direct mentally? The same is such in Yoga practice. Vampirism is the consuming of this energy, from the earth and other life around us."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 Vampirism or predatory spirituality is applied in the real world and in the ritual circle, never applying to consuming blood to any extent. If applied to a psychological aspect vampirism is the subconscious affirmation that “I” or the self is the only God that is, there is no other. How do you know this? If you can have knowledge by interaction with other people – specifically a woman, then you know you are not that woman. Take for instance the word, ‘perspicacity’. The meaning of this word according to the Webster Dictionary is: “Acuteness of perception, discernment, or understanding.” This would be exactly the description of the Luciferian Path with regards to the self or “I”. The self is a widely misunderstood arena of practice in the context of left hand path. The basics, carnal pleasure, are considered the foundation of Satanism and even Luciferian thought. This cannot be so as carnal pleasures are subjective based on the upbringing and social make up of that person. One man’s pleasure is another man’s pain. The foundation of the Satanic/Luciferian Mind is to awaken and discover, “I AM GOD AND THERE IS NO OTHER”. If you can understand that you are not the person talking to you as you are having an unconnected (i.e. you are not connected to their body or the object this applies to being car, bike, cart, etc), interaction with them then it is reasonable to recognize you are separate. If you are separate there is no direct linking connection, you are significant to the number one.

Transformation over time will change the course and mode of initiation, but the aim will be the same – power and spiritual continuation.

This is a rite focusing on the summong of the dragon, the forces of the subconscious, as Tiamat, the Mother of Vampires.

Ahriman is considered one brother created by Zurvan and was the opposing force to Ohura Mazda. Ahriman is also known as Angra Mainyu, an older title derived from Angra Mainyu, being the “evil” or averse spirit. Ahriman is a sorcerer who achieved a means of immortality and power over darkness and shadow. One who creates his desire in flesh. In relation to the sorcerer or practitioner of Yatuk-Dinoih, the individual seeks by developing their own system of sorcery, to become like Ahriman, just as did Akht-Jadu in the Zoroastrian tales. Ahriman is called the Great Serpent or Dragon, whose spirit is a shapeshifter and tester of flesh and mind. It was considered in some Zoroastrian tales that Ahriman and the Daevas, his angels, ecisted between the earth and the fixed stars, which would be essentially of the element Air (much like Lucifer his later identification). In creation myths, Ahriman first saw light and sprang into the air in the form of a great snake, that the heavens were shattered as he brought darkness into light. Ahrimanic Yoga – Achieving control and command over the body. Each ArchDaeva is representative of each Chakra and such are points of specific power in the body. Ahrimanic Yoga represents disunion with the universe, as opposed to union from a Buddhist view. Akha [Avestan/Pahlavi] - Avestan, meaning evil. In the context of Liber HVHI and Luciferian Witchcraft, it is a term signifying the antinomian path."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 Akho [Avestan/Pahlavi] – From the Avestan “akha” meaning “evil”, Akho is mentioned in the Denkard as a word representing a “current” of averse energy or evil, through which one aligning their thoughts in possessing spiritual independence, antinomianism and self-deification one may reach into the spirit of Ahriman. This supports the initatory foundation of the Luciferian path itself – the Adept prepares to become like the Adversary his or her self, based on their own unique path. Akht [Avestan/Pahlavi] – The Sorcerer who was the embodiment of the Yatus, the demonic forces of Ahriman. Akht-Jadu or Kabed-us-spae as he was called was mentioned in Matigan-I Yosht-I Fryan. Akhtya was the founder and member of the Yatus, a coven of ‘demons’ and sorcerers who wandered Persia, practicing and developing sorcery. The name Akht itself means ‘evil’, ‘filth’ and ‘pestilence’, thus relates to the initiatory nature of Akhti as a sorcerer of the Adversary, by the darkness shall he come into light. Akhtya or Azyta is thus considered a symbol of the Zanda, which is an Apostle or Priest of Ahriman.  ALGOL – A word which derives from the Arabic Al Ra’s al Ghul, Al-Ghul, or Ri’B al Ohill, which is translated “The Demon’s Head”. Algol was in Hebrew known as Rosh ha Shaitan, or “Satan’s Head”, as some traditions have referred to Algol as the Head of Lilith. The Chinese called Algol Tseih She, which is “Piled up corpses” and was considered a violent, dangerous star due to its changing vivid colors. On some 17th century maps Algol was labeled, “The Specter’s Head”. Algol upon some research has"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 indicated that possibility Three stars which are an eclipsing binary, which may explain some of the rapid color change. Some writers have connected Algol with the Egyptian Khu, or spirit. The Khu is considered a shadow spirit which feeds on other shades of the dead. In reference to the writings and initiatory symbolism of Michael W. Ford, ALGOL is the sigillized in one form as a Chaos Star with an Averse Pentagram in the center. The Pentagram refers to the Eye of Set, timeless and divine, godlike and independent. The Chaos Star is destruction, Change and power – all of which emerges from the Eye of Shaitan, or Set. It is this Chaos which then brings Order. ALGOL is the mirror of the sorcerer, one who may enter and reside in the pulsing eye of blackened flame. Arezura [Avestan/Pahlavi] – Arezurahe griva (Arezura) in the Bundahishin is called “a mount at the gate of hell, whence the demons rush forth”. Arezura is the gate to hell in the Alburz mountain range in present day Iran. The North is traditionally the seat of Ahriman, wherein the cold winds may blow forth. Arezura from an initiatory perspective is the subconscious, the place where sorcerers may gather and grow in their arts, by encircling and manifesting their desire. M.N. Dallah wrote in “The History of Zoroastrianism” concerning a connection with demons holding mastery over the earth, their ability to sink below the earth and that such demons around the time of Zoroaster walked the earth in human form. In the Denkard, it is described that one who becomes a vessel for the “evil religion” becomes physically an abode for “Unholy Demons” or Daevas.

Az is also related to menstruation (The KISS of Ahriman causes menstruation in women) and is a destroyer through chaos. Az was connected with Sexual Hunger but also religious doubt, which relates her to a Luciferian Spirit who broke the chains of dogma by the Black Light, the torch of self-perception of being. Az also represents Lilith as the Goddess of the Beasts of the Earth, the very mother of demons and sorcerous beings. Az was said to be created in the Zurvan myth as a black substance like Coal, which would devour all creation, manifesting her as a vampyric being.

Black Magick – The practice of Antinomian and self-focused transformation, self-deification and the obtainment of knowledge and wisdom. Black Magick in itself does not denote harm or wrongdoing to others, rather describes “black” as considered to the Arabic root word FHM, charcoal, black and wisdom. Black is thus the color of hidden knowledge. Magick is to ascend and become, by Willed focus and direction. Cain –The Antinomian nomad and Sorcerer who was the spiritual offspring of Samael (the Black Dragon) and Lilith (Red Dragon/the mother of demons) through the body of Eve in Biblical lore. Cain was said to have been the initiate of the Caul, and through his first step on the Left Hand Path (Antinomian practice) he is the initiator of the sorcerer and witch.

The term does not reflect the theistic worship or knee bending towards an exterior force, rather a Willed direction of self-advancement by transformation. Daeva represents a “mask” of power, specifically to perceived energies. Dregvant [Avestan/Pahlavi] – In historical Zoroastrian lore, a person embodied with Druj, the spirit of darkness. Druj is refered as both feminine and masculine, thus is an initiatory term relating to the foremost union of Ahriman and Az, the blackened matter and fiery darkness of his bride. A Dregvant is a Yatu or initiate of the Daeva-Yasna. Druj [Avestan/Pahlavi] – “Lie” referring to demons, feminine and masculine.

Ford has laboured in the forbidden fields of the dark side of the occult, lit by the pale moon of Luciferian ambition and Satanic drive. Luciferian Witchcraft represents perhaps the major part of his published accomplishments to date. The first editions of most of his works are disappearing into private libraries of occult collector's items-and their prices are increasing enormously. With this fact in mind, Luciferian Witchcraft gathers together in one huge compendium many of the shocking rituals and bizarre initiation rites of black magick that have established Ford as the most cutting-edge exponent of the left hand path tradition in America today. The book begins with a lengthy and highly scholarly exposition of the place of the Draconic adversary within historical magick. Set Typhon, the Egyptian God of Darkness, Ahriman, the Persian Devil and his Whore of Darkness, the Adversary and the Bride of the Devil, Cain the Son, the Gnostic Yaldabaoth, \"Child of Chaos\", the Path of the Crooked Serpent- Leviathan and Beelzebub and Tiamat, Pazuzu, and Moloch are only some of the topics and figures covered. The second part of the book,The Grimoires of Luciferian Witchcraft, includes several of his most infamous graveyard workings, together with the complete version of the Luciferian Goetia- a completely revised and updated version of the Goetia grimoire from the Lesser Key of Solomon the King. Part three covers Yatukan and Ahrimanic Persian sorcery. As I have mentioned before, it is the willingness and creativity of Ford to look beyond worn-out Christian- and Hebrew-based demonology in search of black magick inspiration that marks his work as unique. Here, forbidden heresies of millenia-old Zoroastrian thought reveal their diabolic secrets to the sorceror."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 LIBER HVHI Magick of the Adversary By Michael W.

The second part of the grimoire is based on the ritualistic inversions of the Avestan texts and the forbidden path of Predatory Spiritualism. LIBER HVHI contains the 22 spheres of the Infernal Qlippoth, the methods of filling and draining those “shells” and the Luciferian Rites of the Supper of Cain, symbolic of the first Satanist from the ancient Hebrew texts relating to the devouring process from a symbolic and ritualistic approach. No matter what name the Adversary has been called by, from the ancient Persian cult of Yatukih sorcerers Ahriman or Angra Mainyu, his Bride Jahi or Az, to the Hebrew Samael and Lilith, the Luciferian Current has remained strong beneath those ancient cultures. LIBER HVHI is a grimoire written from ancient religious texts such as the Avesta and various Cabbalistic writings. The result is a powerful Luciferian ideology and methodology of ritual and daily-life practice which transforms the mind into the Spirit of the Adversary. LIBER HVHI: MAGICK OF THE ADVERSARY Liber HVHI explores the Qlippothic Spheres, Ritual Sorcery based on the ancient cults mentioned in the Avesta of Yatuvidah, daeva-yasna (demon-worshippers) persecuted by the Zoroastrians. The roots of the Adversary as the Masculine and Demonic Feminine are explored from Hebrew and Ancient Persian sources, to a living and potent Left-Hand-Path initiatory system. Beginning with an inversion of the Catholic Rite to instead practice “exorcism”, the inverted and created rite is aimed at “Possession” or liberating the shadow self into a viable, productive focus. The 22 cells of the Qlippoth along with the infernal spheres are presented as valuable aspects of strengthening consciousness and creating an attitude of winning and self-deification. LIBER HVHI will contrast with those looking to condemn left-hand-path writings, the revealed identity of the Luciferian is one who wishes to become something more, from the predatory spirituality of Ahriman and Az to the intense ritual practices of the long forgotten Daevas of the Avesta.
