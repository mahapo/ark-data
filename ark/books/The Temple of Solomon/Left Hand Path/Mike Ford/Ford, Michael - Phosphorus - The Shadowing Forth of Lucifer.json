[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Phosphorus -The Shadowing Forth of Luciferby Michael FordLucifer, the Pale Morning Star, Phosphorus-\"The precursor of the full blaze ofthe noon-day sun\" as Blavatsky so elegantly defined it, is the foundation of thebasis of Magick. Magick itself means to \"Ascend\" towards the light of God. Goditself defined as the individual self and the light of knowledge.\"The significant symbol of wisdom given to us by research is Lucifer, the bringer oflight. Everybody is searching for perception, wisdom is a child of Lucifer. The Chaldeanastrologers, the Egyptian priests, the Indian Brahmans; they are all children of Lucifer. Already thefirst man became a child of Lucifer when the serpent taught him good and evil. What they got toknow by perception was the sacred cosmic mystery. In front of it they kneeled in devotion. It wasthe light that showed their souls to their destiny. In devotion they received wisdom which becamefaith, religion. What Lucifer had brought to them, shined godlike in front of their psychic eyes.Owing to Lucifer they had God. It means to disunite heart and mind if God is considered asLucifer's enemy. Our educated don't raise the perception of the mind to religious devotion, theyparalyze the enthusiasm of the heart.For those who are searching for the light of the spirit Lucifer shall be a messenger. Hewon't talk about a faith that is alien to perception. He won't flatter into the hearts to avoid theguardian of science: he shall respect him. He won't preach piety and divine bliss but will showways for the knowledge to change into divine sensation, into the devotion of the cosmic spirit.Lucifer knows that the radiant sun may only rise in the heart of the individual; but he also knowsthat only the paths of perception lead up to the mountain where the sun appears in his divineradiation. Lucifer is no devil leading the searching Faust to hell; he shall be an awaker of thosewho believe in knowledge who want to change into the gold of divine wisdom.\"-From Luzifer-Gnosis, Rudolph Steiner.Lucifer stands on the threshold of Dawn and Dusk. The bringer of light, symbolof Thelemic strength and divine wisdom emerges. The age of Lucifer is theuprising of what Blatavatsky termed \"Phosphorus\", the cosmic force ofillumination and light. Lucifer is the force of Air, while Satan the dual andcorrupted form of the light bringer is of active fire. This duality is the changeableessence of progression and evolution. Lucifer emerges by name as the Roman\"bringer of light\", Lucem Fero..the carrier of the torch. A Gnostic God, the Holybible mentions little of him besides the basis of origin:\"You were the anointed cherub who covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain ofGod; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones. You were perfect in your ways fromthe day you were created, til iniquity was found in you.\"-Holy Bible, Ezekiel.Later on the Morning Star as is called became the Dragon and the Devil.Shaitan was the base for this materization, which means to oppose, to accuse.Lucifer was invariably the first rebel.Lucifer is of the Spirit of Light, from which the foundation of Luciferic Magickis to ascend towards Godhead. The light of the spirit is based within perception"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and the clarity of an awakened self. Perception is the vehicle of knowledge andwhat the individual can understand. Christianity teaches the annihilation ofperception and the repression of the awakened mind. The enthusiasm of the drivenconscious, charged with the bright Luciferian light; leads all individuals towardsGod itself.Lucifer is the Fallen Angel of Light. Born strong in the light of the God spirit,his crown held the most beautiful jewels from the earth. His essence was of theSun and divine wisdom and enlightenment shone throughout him. No other Angelor Seraphim was as bright as Lucifer.As with all beings of light and Will, a great fire emerged within Lucifer. Hesought to become as God, to rise towards Godhead. Thus the great rebel was born.Standing against the Holy Hierarchy, Lucifer gathered many of his fellowSeraphim, Leviathan, Belial, Astaroth, Asmodeus/Samael, Mephistopheles,Dagon, Sorath/Shaitan, Beelzebub and a host of others to stand in the light of selfgodhoodand defy that which stood against individual phosphorus; the infinitepossibility of existence.A great battle ensued, Etheric and Astral bodies were devoured and torn fromaggressive attacks. The Seraphim which sought the throne of God gave all underthe flag of Lucifer. Nothing would stand in the way of individual freedom and thelight of Godhood; nothing is the basis for destruction and the beginning ofcreation. The Morning Star was rising, Angelic hosts feared these bright beings.Finally the Holy Angel Michael (who will prove useful in healing Magick) andhis great horde overpowered the Luciferian Spirits. They were cast from the gatesof Heaven towards the Earth. Along with them fell the Nephilim. Descending, thespirits lost all perception of time and space; knowing the great loss that hadoccurred.Lucifer awoke before the others. His crown, shattered; lost with the thronefightof Godhood was somewhere upon this earth. Lucifer stood erect, gatheringhis surroundings and sense of self. \"I stand and emerge yet still, born of God yetunto only myself. The secrets of the universe shall be mine and the hidden light isdestined.\" The other Angels still remained unconscious, threatening to enter thegreat abyss of non-form if such would remain for any period of time.\"I call ye forth to awake and arise as yourselves, Gods in the light of Heaven.Hell is ours yet we must make a Heaven within ourselves. The universe is kindand all we shall ever need will be provided as long as we are here to take it. Standup and join with me. The world can be ours under our light...Awake!\"The fallen seraphim began to rise and take shape. They would scatter unto thevarious parts of the earth and abyss. From the Ashes must the Gods and Goddessesrise. Some descended further, some became as angels of light. Leviathan and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Samael descended, Lucifer became and angel of light.Belial would become an earth bound spirit who would transform into a Demon.Astaroth, wandering the earth on a great dragon. Leviathan, a daemon whobecame of the ocean and would exist simultaneously with the Astral Plane and thedepths of the sea. Leviathan along with the other fallen angels became an ideal, afocus of strength whose power still remains within all of us. Awaiting the momentof becoming, these Daemonic atavisms exist on subconscious levels of the mind.The opening of such abyssic gates leads the psyche towards rising forth andbecoming something of evolutionary progression.Lucifer stands as the fountain head of Astral Magick; (i.e., Astral Projection,Dream Control, ect.) Lucifer is balance in the instance of both Shadow and Light,Blood Red and Jet Black. Lucifer is the colour of an awakened and enlightenedmind. The Psyche which is open for magical inspiration.Blavatsky understood the significance of balance within the individual, toascend the individual from the beast like qualities so inherent within oursubconscious. Blavatsky wrote \"Thus it stands proven that Satan, or the red FieryDragon, the \"Lord of Phosphorus\" and Lucifer, or \"Light bearer\" is in us; it is ourmind-our temptor and Redeemer, our intelligent liberator and saviour from pureanimalism.\"Asmodeus/Ahriman is the fountain head of Sorcery and earth based BlackMagic. Asmodeus is the God of Black Witchcraft, Sorcery, Necromancy anddiabolism. The balance of Asmodeus/Ahriman is to unite the materialistic fleshside of life with the spiritual, or Luciferic. Falling to either side could result in thedestruction of the self. Black Magic is the focus of making the Psyche immortal,surviving Earth bound after death. Luciferic Magick is the focus of Astralprojection and Holy Magick. Ascension is the primary goal, To rise towardsGodhead.The Rite of Lucifer was designed through my personal experience to affect theindividual in several ways. Change is often reversible if the self is not on the samelevel as the rest. This translate that change must happen on every molecular level.The whole must be impacted from all sides.Lucifer is to be absorbed and forgotten. The fall is simply the Seraphimdescending into the flesh, the brain of the Sorcerer. Lucifer must be channeled intothe spirit itself and become aligned with the Holy Guardian Angel for a unity to becomplete. Productivity therefor rises and a strong sense of character is built evenfurther. Individuals who attempt these rites must already be of sound mind as thedangers of such if failure occurs are far too real. Insanity, which is displacementand unbalance of the many selves that form one union are disrupted and madnessovertakes the self. The Black Magician must be fully balanced in order to avoid"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the dangers that tempt even the most stable minded.The Shadowing Forth of Lucifer occurs once the self absorbs and forgets thespirit. Further Atavistic Resurgence will summon Lucifer and the Fallen Angelshall become you in every way. This can be accomplished later once the spirit iscalled forth and through the death posture a re-alignment can be done. Considerabsorbing spirits in a modern sense similar to downloading a program on yourpersonal computer. Once this is done, to become a part of this spirit the manyselves must in some way be connected. The spirit is forgot and sunk deep withinthe subconscious called the abyss. When the time has come for this spirit to riseand become fully a part of the self, the downloaded program can only work whenthe computer is shut down and restarted. The mind works in this capacity withregards to such. The spirit through the death posture will re align it's self and thepowers shall become at his or her demand to practice.The many spirits of the Ascension of the Fallen operate in a similar mannerexcept this is far more dangerous. Many other spirits are invoked and many aredemonic energies which must be absorbed through Will and Control.Aleister Crowley gave us the modern synthesis and foundation of Luciferianthought. \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\" and \"Love is the law,love under will\". Two statements which clearly set in motion the ascension of theseeking individual towards Godhead. In his poem, \"Hymn to Lucifer\" Crowleypresents the bringer of light in a Thelemic aspect. No longer shall man besubservient to a religion which would destroy your foundation and right ofpersonal choice.Dogma is also a trap which can lead towards spiritual stagnation. Growth isnecessary through the freedom of an open being, that through will power andfocus can change take hold and run it's natural course.The Luciferian individual is at heart a predator, however balancing action andthought with compassion and tolerance when such emotions are heart felt. AThelemic individual is by definition free to decide the proper course of which hisor her life would flow. Often, clubs, orders and other thought trapping devices willtrick the individual into accepting a code and \"uniformation\" of like minds. Thisshould be in progress only for the means of an end, a goal in which progressionand individual evolution is plausible. If this is not so, what would be the differencebetween the organization minded Occult student and the Christian Churchenthusiast?The essence of Witchcraft in the current age seems slip and often unclear.Wicca presents nature in a beautiful and deeply moving semblance, which in itself,is not entirely the case. Nature is both beautiful, positive and light filled howeveralso destructive, murderous, predatory and black. This is a significant balance"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"point in which individuals should be aware, and able to reflect with balance.Wicca is a powerful tool for those ultimately kind at heart, who may weaveMagick within their own life to a certain end. Dark Witchcraft, or SabbaticMagick, is a balance of Light and Dark energies.Witchcraft is a tool of the Luciferian spirit, and the God forms of SabbaticMagick are very much akin to the self exploring individual seeking Godheadthrough Ascending. Sorcery is an extension of Witchcraft as they are based uponthe powers of the earth associated with Water, Air and Fire. These together leadthe individual towards a higher point of understanding and if properly worked, canlead towards Holy Magick.Vampirism is a significant tool in human evolution because it places in perfectharmony the ever-changing self within natural balance. To ascend one mustdevour the energies that offer themselves. Vampirism holds its foundation indream and myth, forming strongly in a conscious reality, as one may know it.Vampiric Sorcery is a dangerous Magick to control as it tests every point ofmental strength one may have developed. If unbroken, can further strengthen theindividual who would ascend to Godhead. One must delve the depths of thepsyche (abyss) in order to balance the Holy Light. Thelema inadvertently supportsand provides a significant foundation for the like-minded individual who seeksthis light.The Vampiric Sorcerer is not one who once the image of the self, the facade isstripped away, would simply vanish from lack of substance. The sorcerer wouldalready have developed a strong body of light through Astral and Earth Magickand be emanating this force from within. Thus, the self man be still in constantchange and flux however the physical appearance could be stripped away nomatter what and the core be revealed even more so in this manner.The Luciferian Character is successful in the method of Magick and Ascensiononce he or she would master both black and white magick. Chaos Magic is ofinterest in it's diversity, however one must go beyond such methods to train theself in Will and develop a strength of discipline which often ignored by manymodern Sorcerers. Ascend through stamina and Willful direction, not mereimpulse and unevaluated circumstance.Egotism however is a possible flaw and over estimation of self. As theLuciferian is evolved and continues growing one must be in check with the ego. Itshould be understood that often the most humble will comprehend a greaterknowledge of self. Crowley often defined \"Black Brothers\" as those who shutthemselves off from the universe and the cup of Babalon, which is evolution. Thesorcerer must realize that he or she is not necessarily more important thananything else, while at the same time be in full balance with the natural order andthe survival of the psyche."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A black magician is by no means what Crowley defined as \"black brothers\".The essential study and practice of a sorcerer to ascend is significant in the pointthat the individual must grow with his or her studies, to become the topic therein.The self which is also known as \"Kia\" (Austin Spare's \"The Book of Pleasure\")should be explored on every possible level, understanding the foundation for theconscious make up known as \"I\".Lucifer exists in the core of every individual; it is \"it's\" gift to us. Those whoawaken this individual light are blessed unto ourselves. Self-Godhood is the steptowards spiritual immortality. Those who seek the platform of Adept in theMagickial Quest will inadvertently perceive the basis of the balance of light anddarkness. The Angelic and the Demonic shall be united, Chaos will follow formand such is the genetic and psychic make up of the Adept.The face of Lucifer has changed and formed into a plethora of disreputableimages by the Christian psyche in modern times. The ideal message received onthe astral should be, \"I shall ascend\" and not by chance, \"I am of evil\". Suchdoctrines of \"evil\" and \"good\" are excuses to not deal with the core of theindividual. It is locking away the most dangerous, most powerful and mostexciting part of the self. Once the shadow is brought into light shall a God orGoddess begin to emerge.Lucifer stands for the balance of flesh and spirit. The ego or \"I\", constantlychanging must continue to consciously manifest in a positive manner. As AleisterCrowley pointed out in the article entitled \"The Initiated Interpretation ofCeremonial Magic\" (Published in The Goetia):\"The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain. Their seals therefore represent(Mr. Spencer's projected cube) method of stimulating or regulating those particular spots (throughthe Eye).(a) The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish control over the human brain.(Establishment of the functions relative to the subtle world.)(b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit.)(c) Control of one special portion (Name of the spirit).\"Control is the map of empowerment and Ascension. Once direction is assumedand confirmed, can such begin to take place in association with progression andevolution? This subtle point is based around the legend of Lucifer itself. In beingcast forth from the heavens, one could only despair or revel in the freedom andself-respect that had been earned through defiance.The Black Flame that exists in the core of the self has long sought to grow andilluminate the individual who was prepared to travel the fantastic path of selfilluminationand Godhood. Ever woman and man have their own orbit, their ownstar to develop upon this earth. Nothing is rejected which develops integrity andself-strength of spirit."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Within the Sigil of Varcolaci, the image of the vampire is presented as a markpoint towards self-evolution and Godhood. The Trapezoid sigil of Varcolaci opensthe gates of the shadow side through Black Magic. The Varcolaci sigil wasdesigned to manifest the essence of the Varcolaci vampire, the astral being thatrose from the flesh of the sorcerer to ascend to the night sky. This is the evermorphingversion of Lucifer, to eternally seek knowledge and the Faustian sparkwhich ignites into the black flame. The inverse pentagram that the Varcolaci holdis the eye of Lucifer, Devilcosm that would glow with the divine light of selfgodhood. The inverse pentagram is itself symbol of exploring and controlling thedark side powers which exist within every man and woman. Christian attempts oflabeling Lucifer as a God of Death only proves the extent of brainwashing whichonly mirrors their subconscious desire to be bound, that fragile and undevelopedflame to be extinguished.Lucifer as being the Prince of the Powers of Air establishes this God form asthe fountainhead of Astral Magick. The Varcolaci Sigil or Devilcosm is the mirrorof Lucifer, the bringer of light through Astral Projection and search of Balance ofKnowledge. The applications of such Magick can be used in every facet of ones'life. It is only limited by the imagination. \"Ain Soph\" indeed!Aleister Crowley's patterns and formation of \"Thelema\" is based within theLuciferian principle. The bringing of light towards the individual, from which theStar may find it's one unique path. \"Do What thou Wilt shall be the Whole of theLaw\" from which none may deny thee. Such a brilliant system can be found infurther developments of such tomes as \"Magick in Theory and Practice\", \"TheBook of the Law\", \"Thoth-Tarot\" and such an edited work as \"The Goetia\". Themap towards Godhead soon comes into clear and unadulterated focus. Perceptionis existent through the use of all senses available. Experience and knowledge is theFaustian key to the next step of evolution."}]
