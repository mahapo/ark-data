[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Luciferian Sorcery and Set-TyphonBy Michael W. FordFirst written in 2003 and updated January 2006Suti (Set) and the Devil-forms of ancient Egypt“I am the Crocodile-god (Sebak) who dwelleth amid his terrors. I amthe Crocodile-god and I seize (my prey) like a ravening beast” –“Transformation into the Crocodile-god” from “The Egyptian Book ofthe Dead”Set is considered in the developing Luciferian Gnosis as theAdversary, an early form of the Adversary. The crocodile god Sebak inthe Egyptian Book of the Dead draws some aspects similar in natureto Set, such as the forms he would take. Seemingly, it is consideredby the initiatory focus into the symbol and traits of Set, “Verily theGreatest of the Gods” embodied many different aspects and forms inEgyptian mythology. Seker seems to also be a God associated withthe early manifestation of Set, in the Tuat, one of the tunnels whichwere under the control of Seker were guarded by a serpent with fourlegs, scorpions, vipers and other winged demons.The Arabic word TAWFAN according to E.A. Wallis Budge may hold aconnection to the name TYPHON, considering the Arabic means“Storm”. Apep was known universally as the serpent-devil which heldpower over storms, darkness and night. Set made his forms indarkness as well, yet as Sutekh his “Adversarial” nature was that heexisted both in the Tuat or underworld in the seeming form of Apep(once he mastered this chaotic aspect) and Man-God on earth. AtKom Ombo as well as other places Set was called Nubti and Sutekh,although later identified with the god Baal, whom the Hyskos held astheir highest god.Set is called a mighty warrior who had his kingdom in the North,specifically in the Northern Sky where he dwelled in a star of theconstellation of Khepesh or the “thigh”. As Typhon has long beenassociated with Set the common traits of his nature are clear.Consider the nature of “Typho” as the greeks called him, his naturewas of the beast and he corrupted the natural order, the course ofnature. Set was of this nature as well, an Anti-Nature in that hisspirit was against the natural laws and went forth upon its owncourse. In the Luciferian Path, the common element of practice is to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"forge with your own identification of mythology, your own pathagainst others. That is, by antinomian practice from a spiritualfoundation, the Adept becomes “like” Set or Ahriman, not in anyWestern “evil” definition, rather in the spiritual sense.The names of the Adversary in ancient Egypt (as Set and Apophis)were many, a few examples are:Nak, Sabau, Apophis, Suti, Baba, Smy, Hemhemti, Pakerbeth,Saatet-ta, Qerneru, Tutu, Nesht, Hau-hra, Iubani, Amam, Sebaent-Seba, Khak-ab, Khan-ru,UaiSau, Beteshu, Kharubu the Four Times WickedThe Smaiu and Mesu Betshet were the “Children of Rebellion”, thosewho were shape shifters and cult members who venerated theSerpent as their God. As it was written in Genesis the serpent was“subtle than any beast” and refers to the cunning and mindfulapproach it had towards anything done.The material associated with Set-Typhon is iron, called often “thebone of Typho”. It was by this strength in which Set held dominionover all at some point in time, his forms many and his will andhunger to exist was greater than the efforts of his enemies todestroy him. Set is called the personification of the dark waters andthe desert, his two-fold essence of being is central to his role as thetester and sorcerous initiator.All predators of the spirit who devoured the dead were reposed inthe darkened pits of the Tuat. Aapep, Apep or Apophis was theDemon Serpent of chaos who devoured many, battled often by Set,later Apep was conquered and mastered by Set, soon Apep mergedinto Set. Just as the most common form of Apep was a crocodile, thiswas also a form that Sutekh or Set took as well. Suti (Set) was alsooften a God of Death, devouring spirits or befriending them as well.Predatory Spiritualism had its roots in the world in Ancient Egypt,from what the Gods practice shall some Adepts practice as well.In the Tuat, a demon-serpent called “Sati-temui” who was seventycubits long and was said to grow strong from devouring the souls ofthe dead who were there. There is also a mention of a serpent called“Akriu” who was also an enemy of RA as well. There was a place offire in the Tuat as well, where there was a Lord in the form of a giantserpent who held the power of the Evil Eye. This serpent wouldseduce his prey and then devour their spirits. Know that the forms ofSet are many, the God of Darkness and War is also a creative god ofprogression and shape shifting. He survives by transformation.The path of sorcerous arte known as Luciferian Witchcraft, is perhaps"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"becoming a clearer subject under the Sethian concept of theAdversary as a dual and necessary force. Just as Chaos Magick is adevelopment of primal sorcery, without limitations, the LuciferianPath is a further and refined development of primal sorcery with adefined path towards the Sethian becoming, and the ongoing processof self-transformation.“Luciferian Witchcraft” presents a gateway to gnosis of what ourculture has called Satan, specifically reaching into the roots of theadversary to discover the various cultural traits of the Luciferianspirit. Ahriman is a primary source of this fountain of gnosis,however Set or Sutekh as the God of Darkness is equally asfascinating if one may find a semblance of interest there.Consider the ideals of the Luciferian path. In Luciferian Witchcraft,by Michael W. Ford, the very foundation of the adversary ispresented as a multicultural force, thus existing within the universeand not a creation of mankind. While man had createdanthropomorphic attributes, this spirit if you will pre-existed humanconsciousness. To practice Luciferian Witchcraft and Sorcery, oneessentially prepares the mind and body to be a vessel for this force,not joining in union with it, rather encircling the essence of theAdversary and allowing the self to shape Chaos into self-willed Orderwithin the self. This, by definition alone is Chaos Magick. Whattransfers the title is a result of what transformed the Gnosis itself,the intent of the work.Be cautious in the terms of Chaos Magick, you are not simplyparadigm shifting, rather utilizing chaotic forces to utilize temporaryOrder in the self to grow stronger and progress as an Adept. ChaosMagick in the terms of which I refer to are tools of various forms ofritual belief to construct your own initiatory focus. The foundation isthe consistent aspect of Chaos Sorcery in the Luciferian Path.The Witches' Sabbat itself is composed of two aspects, the Celestialor Empyrean (the highest aspect of Light, Luciferian Fire and divinity)and the Infernal (the lower aspects, the daemonic). What theWitches' Sabbat is the spiritual transference from the waking flesh(everyday life) to the astral/dream rite (the gathering of witches andsorcerer in the arena of the dream). The Sabbat has been exploredsince before the middle ages, in the form of the infernal, daemonicand often demoting in the lens of Christianity. It was Austin OsmanSpare, in his one room apartment in London, awakened to thegathering of spirits, fornicating and procreating the inherent wish ofeach sorcerer. Spare considered the Sabbat most healthy, and notedan increase in mental and physical health and vigor. Spare aroundthis time, in the early 1950's, drew numerous illustrations of theSabbat in various forms, including many infernal aspects of his early"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"career. Kenneth Grant later illustrated much of Spare's LuciferianGnosis in his legendary work, \"Images and Oracles of Austin OsmanSpare\".The Sabbat of the Witches is a dreaming aspect of the imagination,of strengthening the self into the arcana of the Cunning Fire, or BlackFlame. The Lore of Cain as the Lord of Horsemen is the earthenbound spirit who kindles the very flame of self, the illumination ofIblis/Shaitan. He or she is a vessel reflecting its unique touch,different from all others, as well as each other who make walk asimilar path. It is within the nature of the Ourobouros bound mirrorthat we emerge into the dream of spirit flight, when the Sun is theBlack Essence of creation, that all images are cast in the light ofOpposition. Cain is the embodiment of the strength and wisdom ofthe Watchers, the very possibility of divine consciousness awakenedin man and woman.The entry of the Luciferian practice is symbolized in LuciferianWitchcraft’s \"AZOTHOZ\". In this work, I used the method of poemand prose to write a cipher of ensorcelling the self, or spiritualawareness through a Luciferian and Sethian mirror. In this work, myposition was to clearly draw the connection and becoming process ofself-initiation through the lore of the Watchers, the Nephilim, theBlack Eagle and the essence of the Adversary. The combination of Artand text invoke the very spirit of Shaitan and Lilith to those who mayembrace it. Azothoz reaches into the current of magick to manifestitself in the initiate who may be of this essence, born by the spark ofDjinn fire to witch blood. This is a Luciferian process of Self-Liberation which invites a deeper understanding of Daemon andAngel, their union outside of a Christian standpoint. It is theotherness which individuals may seek to inspire, bringing one closerto the Lord of Storms and Chaos, SET to a spirit of Order in the self.When writing of angels, a point of the `angelick familiar', “Luciferianangel” or Holy Guardian Angel may be observed, higher aspects ofour consciousness, while `demonic familiar is the lower, bestialaspects of our consciousness, atavisms, the shadow itself. Here isthe essence of Ahriman as the bringer of shadow, from which weencircle both the higher with the lower. References to the infernaland demonic within Luciferian Witchcraft are aimed as that sameprocess of self-liberation, initiating change and progress of the selffrom a magical perspective.The Sabbat itself stands between normal dreaming and waking, it isa mystical process undermined by determination to change andprogress. In a symbolized working, the dreamer experiences theSabbat be it in the Celestial (Luciferian gathering, communion withthe Watchers) and Infernal (Daemonic gathering, fornication andshades of the dead) to usher forth a strong process of self-initiation,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that the imagination is illuminated and able to stand alone. In anobservation process, the imagination is able by means of Will, tocreate and sustain its own individual independent being of self.As a Sethian perspective, the Luciferian Witchcraft is not in myopinion effective as a RHP tool, but only essentially useful through aLHP perspective. The Sorcerous Path itself is one of selfdevelopment,exploring both ones shadow and light aspects, utilizingthem to ones benefit and ultimately focusing these tools as a meansof becoming. As one enters the Luciferian Circle, the self is encircledin the arcana of I, which Austin Osman Spare defined as the centerof being and the infinite possibility therein. All of the Daemons andAngels of the self as familiars or guides are all an expression ofowns being. Before one becomes cloudy in the waters of Wicca, thepure source must be revealed.To better explain the Luciferian Path in the terms of which is offeredin “Luciferian Witchcraft”, “Liber HVHI” and “”Book of the WitchMoon”, an assessment of the basic tools, God forms and models ofbelief are given here:ApepThe serpent-demon of chaos and the abyssic waters of the Tuat.Apep is the early embodiment of the Sumerian Tiamat or the Sevenheadeddragon of the apocalypse. In early Persian manifestation,Ahriman and the ArchDaevas. In Egyptian lore, Apep is by cipher andstudy nothing more than Set revealed, his primal draconian aspect ofself. Apep embodies the very essence of Set and may even beconsidered associated with his shadow or demonic form. In the Tenthand Eleventh Sections of the Tuat “Set-heh ” is shown as being tothe left of the Gods in a fiery place, Horus standing in front of Sethehin the form of a serpent.AnubisThe Lord of Jackals and Opener of the Way, Anubis is Hermes, theGateway unto Death. Anubis is a tester, one who would way theheart of he or she that sought to emerge or dive unto the Celestialor Infernal realms. Anubis is also a Mortuary God, residing overembalming and funeral preparations. Within Luciferian Sorcery, oneundertakes the mask of Anubis to become like Anubis, some mayseek the shades of the dead or further necromantic experimentsdepending on the predilections of the sorcerer.The Alphabet of DesireConsidered a formulaic point of congress with the `other' or'otherness', the Alphabet of Desire is an unspeakable grammar which"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"communicates with Azoth or the subconscious. Azoth is thebeginning and the end, that which encompasses the in-between. Asa Sethian or Luciferian, may incorporate the Alphabet of Desire as atool of self-determination, or Will to achieve ones goals. TheAlphabet of Desire may be a useful tool of exploration to advanceones knowledge in the learning of herbs and their uses, astralprojection, learning martial arts, understanding tarotcorrespondences, whatever it may be. The Luciferian grimoires suchas LIBER HVHI, Luciferian Witchcraft and Book of the Witch Moonincorporate the Alphabet of Desire as the means of communicationwith the sorcerers' familiar, the `Holy Guardian Angel' and `EvilGenius' of the Cabbala. The 22 letters/paths of the Qlippoth arepresented in Liber HVHI and interestingly enough, as one movesthrough the workings and rituals described in “Luciferian Witchcraft”,“Liber HVHI” and “Book of the Witch Moon”, there becomes littledifference in the HGA and Evil Genius, shadow and light becomeencircled and the self grows as One balanced point within the circleof arte. The alphabet of desire, as Austin Spare called it, representsthe complete arcane of sorcery from which the Black Adept may makehis desires flesh in spirit and in flesh. The methodology of theQlippoth is also within this gnosis. The Order of Phosphorus instructsa basic teaching of the creation of the Alphabet of Desire based onthe 22 Tunnels of the Qlippoth as defined in LIBER HVHI.The 8-Pointed Luciferian Star - ALGOLThe 8 pointed sigil holds several symbols of interest, as onedefinition may be reflected into another. Called the Chaos Star/Sigil,this eight pointed symbol represents the void and non-beingconcerning matter in the universe. Chaos is the most beneficial force,from it the Black Adept weaves temporary Order within the Self. InSabbat Rites, it is the Ritual of transferring the consciousness untothe self. This is reminiscent of the Italian Witches Covens that tookto the Spirit Hunt on the dreaming plane as well. The Luciferianessence of attending the conclave is the meeting place of the Three(consider Hecate/Lilith the Guardians of the Crossroads), it is theSeven Rayed Star which initiates and the Eight Ray which comes theinitiator of Magick, Set himself. Nick Hall points out in \"Chaos &Sorcery\" that the Eight Rayed Star appeared in Mesopotamia around3,000 B.C. as a symbol to represent Dingir (God), Heaven (AN) andStar. This may be viewed in a Luciferian context as Dingirrepresenting the infinite possibility of being, the Fire stole fromHeaven, and the union of the Celestial Going Forth into the Aethyr ofangelick being, the higher intellect or essence associated with theNeter Set. Within “Luciferian Witchcraft”, ALGOL is represented bythe Five Elements of Ahriman, as first described by the ancientManichaean Cult, which was inspired by Zoroastrianism but calledHeretics. These elements of the Prince of Darkness combined thebestial and earthly aspects, from which Ahriman masters all within"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"his circle.The Holy Guardian Angel/The Evil Genius/Congressus cumDaemoneThere has been much in the way of misunderstanding within Magickas to what the Holy Guardian Angel actually is. Some have describedit as an exteriorized force which guides each person, others a forceof the subconscious. I am partial by experience and direction thatthis is a force of the subconscious, the Greater Familiar is a result ofAtavistic workings (which include the Bornless One Ritual) from whichthe Luciferian Sorcerer calls both the Evil Genius (the demonicatavistic nature of self) in unity with the Holy Guardian Angel, theEmpyrean Angelic force, blended with the Demonic Aspect grants ahigher articulation of the spirit force, which is still very much a partof us. The attendant spirit, as Familiar may be considered anAngelick/Luciferian illuminated self. This is of course, not a separateentity but the projected and developed imagination of the Sorcerer,from which he or she may visualize a force created from shadow anddarkness, blending with the higher articulations of a Luciferian Spiritof Flame (Iblis) or Light, thus creating and bringing forth the HGA orAngelick Familiar. There is no mystical guideline for this force, it isvery much a part of your being, illuminated and empowered by yourown desires.Fetishes (lesser and greater)A Fetish is simply a storehouse of power. It represents the sorcererin some way, particularly an aspect of his or her personality. Forinstance, a Vampyric Famulus would be a human skull (the KnightsTemplar were said to worship Baphomet in the form of a humanskull) which holds a consecrated sigil representing the vampyricaspects of self; along with the grave soil of a graveyard in which thesorcerer has rested in and meditated upon death. Fetishes areconsidered a powerful tool in witchcraft and primal sorcery, as theyare gateways of consciousness and a growing extension of thesorcerer. In making a fetish, consider the elements which would suitthe desired purpose of the elemental. You are creating the famulus,from aspects of the self aided with the manes of the dead, Willedinto a form which exists through the fetish or storehouse, butultimately is a repose of the sorcerer's consciousness. A “vampyre”within the context written of here is a word denoting the essence ofthe myths of old, essentially a “Predatory spirituality” which theBlack Adept slowly transforms into upon the path.CainKnown also as CHIVA, or Chioa, the Beast – offspring of Samael andLilith. Tubal-Qayin is the Lord of the Horsemen, the Luciferian Patronof the path, the initiator. Cain in some areas of the LuciferianWitchcraft gnosis is an earth form of Set, the form imposed in flesh"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"and greenery, the desert and the caverns of the earth. Cain may beviewed as a symbolic form of awakening, and much of the LuciferianWitchcraft gnosis is based upon the self-initiatory association withCain. Cain is also considered the Offspring of Asmodeus/Samael andLilith, a child of infernal union. The lore of the Sorcerous Blacksmithis explained in depth in “Luciferian Witchcraft”, “Liber HVHI” and“Book of the Witch Moon”.LeviathanConsidered primarily \"male\" and often “female”, Leviathanencompasses the ancient flesh of Mummu Tiamat, the primalGoddess. Leviathan is the unity of sexualities, from which allemerges from this Dragon of the Depths. Leviathan or the Ouraborusis considered the encircler of ones path, or Will. It surrounds andbrings in all exteriors as designed by the sorcerer's Desire, Will andBelief. Leviathan as featured in YATUK DINOIH is the dragon whichbrings the union of Lilith and Samael within the magician, that thepath is brought forth.Shaitan/LuciferLucifer is the Bringer of Light, the Fallen Angel who prides knowledgeand Wisdom above blind faith and servitude. Lucifer was the Seraphwho with a flaming sword and beautiful visage guarded the Throne ofGod in the Heavens. It was because of stasis that Lucifer sought torebel, to initiate becoming in the exploration of his shadow self. TheAngel then became as Daemon also, holding both quality of darknessand light. Lucifer fell unto earth and sought the very knowledge ofEarth, and within it the powers that such the darkness would bring.Iblis, a title of Shaitan is described in ancient texts as a Spirit ofFire, one whose eternal flame would bow before no one, not even aGod force. Iblis/Shaitan understood he was unique and powerfulwithin his being, and that by separating himself from the naturalorder, would become as a God. “Azothoz” presents a cipher in poemon the nature of the Adversary and becoming.Lilith-Az-Babalon- HecateThe Daemonic Feminine is the fountain of the Witch Cult, in it'sdreaming and waking aspect. While Wicca has taken a more sterileapproach to the Goddess, a Luciferian Sorcerer acknowledges thebeauty of the Daemonic Goddess as a well of power and selfdeification.Through Babalon we drink the blood of saints and emergeas God itself. Lilith is the Succubus Witch Queen of the Sabbat,whom is the very mother of us all. Any within the veil of darknessare from her, we fornicate with her continually in the fruitfulimagination of creation. The above four names are but a glimpse ather face, for she wears many masks in accordance with her role. Allindividuals must invoke Babalon Lilith within, regardless of gender."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"She is reached in the City of Chorazin, from which you seek the SkullCup of Blood, drinking deep from the Immortal Well of her VampyricEssence. Part of the work of Coven Nachttoter (a small group ofwhich the present author is a part of) is to explore and restore thework of John Whiteside Parsons, including the work of BelarionArmiluss Al Dajjal Antichrist, a title of attainment. The essence ofWitchcraft in its rightful Left Hand Path perspective is theillumination and understanding of the Daemonic Feminine, which isrevealed to each sorcerer who treads this path of darkness. Onesymbol of Coven Nachttoter is the Sigil of Hecate, which is a mirrorinto the Gates of the Dead, the abode of the Goddess of Witches.THE SETHIANIC FRAGMENTS OF LUCIFERIAN WITCHCRAFTThese God forms are powerful for the sorcerer who summons them,discovers the atavistic aspects which relate to them, and becomeslike them. One would seek to create such energy forms that may beclosely connected with the psyche, therefore initiating a furtherspeed of ones becoming through manifesting the qualities and traitsof the God forms therein. Atavisms are also used in such a way;while often one may use Atavistic Resurgence as a form of summonmany of the God forms listed above.Some of the Luciferian Witchcraft or High Sorcery gnosis is developedfrom Charles Pace, known in early Wiccan circles as Hamar'at. Pace,who was born in 1920 was an early associate of Gerald Gardner,knowing him from some of the Egyptian Hermetic Occult circles theyassociated in. Pace was known in the 1960's as a Priest of Set andAnubis, and later became a high priest of Gerald Gardner's Coven inSouth London. Charles created two known manuscripts of his lecturesand teachings, which were based on his own Sethanic Cult of Masks.Pace was presenting a Luciferian aspect of Wicca which wouldprovide an actual initiatory ground, rather than a dogmatic andunchallenging religious doctrine.\"NECROMINION\" and \"THE BOOK OF TAHUTI\" were two manuscriptswhich survived Pace, authored in the late 1960's and early 70's.'Necrominion' was based around the Sethanic Cult of Masks, anornate Sexual Magick rite known as \"ANKH-KA\", the Five Fold Kissand material on the Hermetic Tarot which lists different attributesthan Aleister Crowley's own coherent Thoth deck.`The Book of Tahuti' was dedicated to `Austin Ozman Spare' isbased upon the Hermetic Tarot, many of the plates are beautiful andimpressionistic. Included in the manuscript was Hamar'at's TripleHermetic Circle, which was incorporated in Coven Nachttoter and my"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"own magickal work. It presents ANKH KA DJED meaning a triple formand self-invigoration, presenting a similar result as what theBornless Ritual does. The Circle is reproduced with new attributionsbased on my own work in LUCIFERIAN WITCHCRAFT.Charles Pace was a Mortician from Scotland, he was even aconsultant for when Jimmy Page redecorated Boleskine House,painting many murals around the home. Pace was also in troublewith the Wiccans and the British Press in the 1970's for variousreasons. Anton Szandor LaVey was said to have been acorrespondent with Pace as well around 1974.Upon receiving reproductions of the images of Pace, my own workseemed to have opened in a new way, new aspects were to be foundin this forgotten character. Upon receiving these images and text, ameeting was called and we discussed the work at hand and how wewould go on to develop it. It is a clear and direct line into theLuciferian Gnosis, as well as the Sethian aspects of self-evolution.The Luciferian Essence itself is intertwined with the work of theSethian. It is a tool of self-deification and advancement, with a morefirm and serious approach than some Chaos Magick aspects. TheLuciferian Path is one of Luciferian Self-Deification, from which Setemerges behind as the Bearer of the Black Flame. It is time to usherforth a challenging, a potent new form of Witchcraft, a return toPrimal Sorcery with the highest aspects of the Sethian, Ahrimanic orLuciferian spirit.This article was originally published in a Setian publication as“Sabbatic Sorcery and Set” and has since been advanced accordinglyand fully updated.Suggested Reading:Luciferian Witchcraft by Michael Ford ISBN 1411626389Liber HVHI by Michael Ford ISBN 1411660862Michael W.
