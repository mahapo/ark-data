That through my dedication to the path of Witch blood, I shall knowthe secrets not so hidden!”-from “The Book of the Witch Moon”, a Grimoire of Luciferian Witchcraft,Vampyrismand Chaos Magickby Michael Ford, © 1999, 2001Many understand the essence of Witchcraft as in relation to nature andgeneral folk craft. While the folk magic brought from Europe flourished in the formof Wicca, mainly due to Gerald Gardner’s (1886-1964) extensive writings andCoven expansion. The system regarded Magic as a natural process, and to buildknowledge from the earth, from which is powers reside. Many grasped thisideology well, given aid no doubt to the nature conscious fever of the 1960’s (1).It is considered that humanity has destroyed enough of its natural resources tobegin the long process of re-building from the industrial revolution. Witchcraftoffered a sister/brotherhood of individuals seeking the love of nature and folkmagic, from which many in Europe in our current time are seeking yet again.“Witchcraft is the direct descendent of ancient shamanic cultures and practices,which has flourished with humanity since the beginning of time. The essence ofwitchcraft is of two basic aspects, being the discovery of the self and the unitywith nature, and the mastery of sorcery and a balance of both dayside anddarkside practices.” (2)The Sethanic Witchcraft current has been cultivated in Europe through thosewho hold the key to the gnosis within their minds; it seems to speak through theblood. This unspoken aspect of the tradition of the old is known directly asWitchblood, it is a silent, unspoken yet natural degree of the folk ability topractice Magick. This is the inner magickal voice of Angels and Demons, the verycore essence within each initiate that speaks to he/she of their own infinitepotential. While the direction of those involved in the Luciferian Tradition inAmerica are well aware of its context of approach, the defining state ofconsciousness must be adhered to ."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The union of some aspects of Middle Eastern practices such as Sufism andthe various parallel witch ways of tribes of the Deserts are essential productiveand beneficial for the advancement in human thinking. There is much to be learntfrom other cultures, however the heart of such always emanates within a focus offolk magic or witchcraft.The Order of Phosphorus is founded upon the techniques taught through thelore of Luciferian Witchcraft, the lore and legend of the old transferred intomagickal technique. The common history of the gnosis is labeled Sethian as itwas indeed Lucifer/Seth and Azazel who brought the Black Flame to humanity,enabled it to rise above the mongoloid putty of our ancestors and becomesomething beautiful. Witchcraft was a natural tool, taught by Luciferic angelsknown as the Watchers, and their Cain – inspired brethren known as theNephilim. This is the lore of the Nightside, from which legend becomes desirewhich takes flesh.The Shadow – World of the Magickian is shrouded in arcane wisdom andinfernal teachings, all the while embracing the light of the Morning Star and theSun rising within. The actual practice of Magick demands patience and the Will tocontinue, for the many challenges of such a path are meant to weed the strongfrom the weak. What should be considered in some aspects is the fact that we ashumans have developed over thousands of years, still regaining in the depths ofour mind the great Serpents that dwelled, the wolves that devoured their preyand the pulse of nature in general. We are of nature, thus a great bond should bedeveloped therein.The Luciferian current in America is generally hidden from public site, allowingthose who work through such circles to build the Magickal Art through practiceand discipline. Those who enter the gates of Witchcraft will automatically viewthe very Gate of the Left Hand Path. Very few will enter this infernal tread, as itbrings one to the ultimate personal power of self-deification. Many are not able tounderstand this state of being, the ascent to become God or Goddess, thuseither failing and loosing their mind in the Sabbatic Circles of Time or renouncingto a much kinder garden path.The Luciferian Witchcraft tradition of the Order of Phosphorus respects ALLpaths that lead to human advancement and knowledge, including those of thewhite light persuasion. We consider that every individual has the right to believeand practice what he or she Wills, unless it harms another unjustifiably. TheOrder of Phosphorus is against Bigotry and Racism, considering such as the filthof non-human advancement.The Order of Phosphorus as a whole considers itself as a manifestation ofLucifer itself, those who join are literally “Doing the Devils Work” by betteringthemselves. Thought dictates advancement by positive practice of Magick andSorcery. Ones own darkside must be explored in areas not normally embracedby occult orders. The Qlippoth as described in Michael Ford’s “The Book of the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Witch Moon” is a demonic astral region, beneficial to those who dive the mirror ofLilith and become stronger. Through the diving of darkness one shall embracethe light.The symbol of the Devil within Luciferian Witchcraft is symbolic oftransformation within each individual, which appears at first glance, dark andforeboding yet essentially allows a great light of wisdom and power to berevealed. This is the Black Flame, the knowledge of self-consciousness and theprocess of becoming something greater.The Devil is essentially, humanity’s darkside, the very essence of infernalteachings that reveal Man and Woman as holding their own infinite potential. Thelight of knowledge which depicts Good and Evil is a great wisdom few mayhandle responsibly, it allows one to create and destroy.The Devil is defined as the personification of Evil, or the inverse ideology ofwhatever moralistic system is popular at the time. The word devil derives fromthe Greek Diabolos, which originally meant accuser. The word Demon is derivedfrom Daimon, meaning a guardian spirit. A demon in modern context (accordingto TOPH) is a spirit or intelligence which can be related to ones Evil Genius, orhidden self, or the Holy Guardian Angel, which is a perfected manifestation of theself in anthropomorphic form.The Devil would not lead us to death and fire, but to life, creation, pleasure,ecstasy and wisdom.Lucifer has been described within a Sabbatic context before, specifically as thehusband of Diana from the legend originating from Italian folklore. Lucifer (theSun) was the husband of Diana (the Moon); the two were joined in a great unionof opposites. It is the development of the individual towards a partial solitary pathwhich opens each aspect of initiation towards the advancement of the humanspirit. This means positive evolution, discipline, understanding and mentalstrength is the building blocks of understanding.Lucifer is thus the high symbol of Sethian Witchcraft.The Witches Sabbath has long been a misunderstood and oftenmisrepresented expression of Magickal Art. It should be considered that theSethian Witch Cult is an expression of not only Folk Magic and Lore, but that of amodern synthesis of advanced ideals of sorcery, psychology and psychicdevelopment. The Witches Sabbath has long been held in arcane lore as thedream – meeting of the Astrals and Spirits of Magickal Practitioners of the Craft,those who between the Twillight of Dawn and Dusk dive the dream wakingenvironment and meet as spirits and other forms to gather under the Black Sun,or under the arms of Luna, awaiting the embrace of Lilith and Hecate, theQueens of the Sabbath.It is through the Luciferian Circles that the Watchers and Fallen Angels"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"brought to us the gift of what is called Witchblood, the Black Flame of Awakeningthat offered an awakening of senses. Each angel still exists in spirit form uponthe earth, allowing a linage to emerge from different areas of psychic andphysical development.The essence of Witchcraft should be explored within its dream – based roots,the touch of Sethanic initiation. As the Angels brought us the lore of the wise inthe early times, so we must continue to change and progress such ideas intonew ways and techniques. Sorcery is efficient as a manner of implicating yourimmediate surroundings. This involves the specific use of Lesser and GreaterBlack Magick in of its aspects – healing, cursing, astral projection, love spells andmore are essential yet undefined in their approach of performance. This alone isup to the witch who develops his/her system based on personal and individualpreference.The works of Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was an artist who talents ofdraftsmanship allowed direct expression of his developed gnosis of sorcery.Spare’s early drawings were founded on the belief of exploring the self, known asthe Zos (3) and Kia (4). Austin’s system of exploring the self by delving thedepths of the mind is best described by his art alone. The writings of Spare, whilebeing confusing and cryptic, were very poetic and strong. Yet, in the face of hisart were under matched, quite simply, the man was a genius!Spare developed an arcane letter system called “The alphabet of desire”which contained the structure for contact with the subconscious. This aspect ofBlack Magick, allowed the individual to tap the latent powers of the mind andmake such work for him or her. The letter itself should be developed by eachindividual initiate for his/her own Alphabet of Desire, this is where the connectionand development of Luciferian Witchcraft emerges.Witchcraft itself, was silently expanded upon by Spare in his later years. It isknown that he had many dream experiences which allowed him to attend theWitches Sabbath, as well as communicate with many of the attendants. Zos velThanatos (aka. Austin Spare) created numerous glyphs and sigils based on theastral conclave, even writing texts which included a full invocation of theSabbath. Such art and writings no doubt influenced the magickal stream ofinitiation within many individuals later on, as well as announcing the formation ofthe technical term called “Chaos Magick” in the 70’s.Wisdom is the point of conscious understanding that is essential for thepractice and life work of the craft of the wise. One may find considerable study inthe four elements as described by Robert Cochrane of the Clan of Tubal Cain. Asis within all Luciferian traditions, the significance of individual study andobtainment of knowledge is paramount.The answers to all things, according to Robert Cochrane (5). are in the Air –inspiration which is brought on the winds shall give the gift of answers to themany questions you may seek. The trees will bring power and the Sea will bring"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"patience, for as Cochrane wrote, the Sea is the womb which contains thememory of all things.You essentially will be brought to listen to the elements, observe and learn.The one who brings the mind in tune with his or her surroundings is betteradapted to work Magick and achieve the gnosis of which he/she seeks after. Thisis primarily an individual process and involves a large amount of personaldedication. The results, or treasure of the work is rewarded to those whoessentially step through the veil of waking into dreaming and emerge upon thehill of the Sabbat, encompassing the circle of the Witchblood whom have offeredunto Asmodeus, the waking lord of the Sabbath.The Order of Phosphorus, being a Luciferian group focused on solitary,ceremonial and individual growth through one discovering his/her own foundationof magickal practice recognizes the importance of the Sethian Witchcraft lineagethat is present within some of its initiates. It is very much like a call of the blood, itwhispers on the webs of dreams from which you are slowly lifted up to the Stag,naked and awake through the eyes of Lilith and Asmodeus.The Awakening and Dedication chant (performed by candlelight – indoors orout. If outdoors, cast your circle in flour.)\"By the rights of pleasure may flesh procreate from within. Mother of theSabbath, Lilith I awaken to the mysteries of our craft. I dedicate my being to thepath from which my blood dictates. By the mysteries of the Goat and the SerpentI come to thee. I walk now the Sabbatic Path, reborn under the LucifericShadows and Promethean Light!
