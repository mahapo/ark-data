[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Binding of ShadowsA Luciferian Banishing Ritualby Michael FordIn silence, close your eyes and envision a large amount of energy rising up from withinyou. The slow breathing technique, as described by Tantrics described a slow rise ofastral energy to form a shield and to clear the mind of thoughts other than the goals of therite you will conduct.The rite as described by Coven Nachttoter is based within the gathering of shadows, theelementals formed in magickal workings to protect the physical and spiritual body fromattack. This technique may be used to also clear the mind for the purpose of relaxation.The shadows, the same of familiars are some part related to the dead, they may be longforgotten shades which are attracted to the spiritual activity of your own magickal work.They have since lost consciousness and the concept of “I”, thus proving useful inworkings of magick.Summon them with blood and bones, sexual energy and the will sharp and focused. Theywill respond and prove useful guardians while in the astral plane. They feed from ourlifeforce just as we absorb from the sacred Opfer. Never mind harm, they do not seem todraw enough lifeforce to cause any alarm of challenge. These shades, if made maliciousby destructive black magick, may cause considerable harm to the intended victim, oreven seek havoc upon the caster. Be cautious. It is however mostly a chore to create andempower such elementals that one would be focused for an extended period of time tocreate such beings.A traditional banishing ritual proves useful as it allows complete control and cleansing ofthe individua l who performs it. It also, just as anything within magick, must meansomething to the one performing it. This banishing ritual allows passage from shades intoour orbit if you will, while banishing unwanted mental aggravations or unwanted selfcreatedor imposed spiritual hindrances. It is also essential to perform at the beginningand end the each rite, allowing the proper closing in such ceremony.I.

The Circle of the DeadUpon the altar a pre-created Nganga should be with you (creation of ngangas involves theuse of human and animal bones-called a fetish spirit- your blood, sigil, grave soil andsnake skin. This nganga will contain active fetish spirits related to the dead. You will useitems of the dead which may bring shades or manes of the dead which will allow you toform from your own desire demon servitors of protection. One may fuse animal remainswith human to form half beast elementals, or shades that prove useful in defense. Do notallow conversation of any kind with such created servitors, for that is the road of insanity."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Command and Will and allow no argument or discussion with such spirits.Facing the nganga on the altar, take gravesoil and toss a small amount in the nganga.Take then the vial of blood (of your own blood, nothing else.) and pour a small amounton the skull of bones within the nganga.Take the wand, encircling counter-clockwise and intone:“I summon the mighty dead from the spaces of silence from which the grave cradles. Igive you life by blood and by soil, by the essence of my being. Emerge from your sleepof death and encircle my being, protecting my body as I dream and walk the web ofnight. As Thanatos I require your service, for we are bound by the laws of death.”The shade will feed from your astral body while you dream, giving it nourishment toperform the duties of its creation. I have found such shades are forced away from thebody when you arrive back in the flesh."}]
