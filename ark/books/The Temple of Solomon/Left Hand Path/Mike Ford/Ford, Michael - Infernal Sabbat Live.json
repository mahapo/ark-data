In a time when if you were not ‘Christian’ of ‘God fearing’, your life would be made unlivable, the Church became renown for it’s religious aggression against those who did not uphold the Governmental glory of the leaders who preached this religion. Beliefs contrary to the bigotry and tyrannical attitudes of the church and its sterile followers were not accepted. The Black Mass was created as a means of liberation and rebellion through the reversed rites of blasphemy of Orthodox thought. In the invocation of Satan, this archetype of self-liberation was means of release, of seeking knowledge and freedom within the self to have the choice of free thought, action and deed. This is why the serpent is considered an aspect of Satan or Lilith, the serpent is long viewed as a symbol of wisdom and fertility. The Christian Satan was taken from the early mythological folklore of Islam, from which Satan’s (meaning to Oppose or the Adversary) name was Azazel. In the Koran and accepted traditions such as the ahadith, Azazel is said to be made of fire similar to the Djinn, yet not of light as other angels. It is this fire which makes Azazel the brightest angel among the others. Azazel was the preacher to all angels in pre-eternity, seated beside the throne in glory. God created man and demanded all angels bow to his creation, Azazel refuses. He claims fire (the Psychic) to be superior to clay (material), and considered it a test that in Heaven Azazel was the highest angel preaching the Light of God, when cast to earth became the Instructor to Man and Woman in the arts of sorcery and Magick. Azazel (Lucifer) was the brightest angel as he was made of flame, which held in itself the light source devoid and separate from the other elements. Azazel later called “Shaitan” held a precious balance within itself; it is the coincidentia oppositorum, this is the ‘Black Light’ of Iblis, the flame of self-perception and rebellion from which one seeks the balance of self. The destiny and map of ones life is chosen by Thought, Will and Action, thus Iblis is the imagination. Lucifer is thus the imagination of self, realization and the strength to become something better.

This Ritual was designed as a means of Opposition to bigotry and oppression, that Lucifer Rises to awaken each with the Black Flame of Perception and Self-Love, while the Vampyric Archetype announces the communion of the Cthonic Forces of the Earth, the Demonium of the Earth. This Ritual is thus in Two Parts – I – The Ritual of Lucifer II- The Ritual of Lilith Join with us, summon with us – awaken the Black Light and Master the Primal Darkness! Designed to induce the symbolic role of the Vampyre and Lycanthrope in modern society – an unchaining of the restrictive thinking and restrictive cultures. This ritual of Chaos is meant to unleash a demonic state in those who take part in this working. This public performance is a Luciferian awakening of the senses, to summon those very forces which society generally shuns. Musickally Psychonaut 75 is an industrial and ritualistic band which embodies the essence of not only Chaos Sorcery and Luciferian Witchcraft, but experimentation and extreme electronic and hybrid soundscapes. “Gate of Black Earth, Nephillmic Tomb in the Sunless Palace of Azrail, Open forth the dreaming fields of Night, From thy vessel, born of Lilith’s Womb Shall the Vampyre shade awaken Before us – Lilith, Queen of those who walk the shadows- “I come before you, night born as the Queen of the Dead.
