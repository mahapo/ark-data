[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" The Wake of the Red Death A Ritual of Destruction Book of Wamphyri and Shadows \"The Masque of the Red Death\" is a very powerful tale by Edgar Allen Poe, the late poet and writer who raised the level of literature during his time which has changed the field of writing and those interested in the macabre for all time. Poe used a great deal of symbolism in his works, a manifestation of death incarnated into the archetypical Red Death, the tall and gaunt figure of blood red, cloaked in the shrouds of the dead. The Red Death is implemented in this destruction rite as the plague bearer, an extention of Azrael - the Angel of Death as a messenger of Will. This ritual is to be done during the night, past midnight, for then the powers of the astral waves are yours to manipulte and man is vunerable at night, more of a chance of success if they are not of strong mind and spirit. If they are as an equal, then there are several secrets in the destruction not listed in these pages. This is either a hermetic rite or could be ceremonial as well. The Sorceror is to be clothed in a blood red cloak and/or robe. The Sorceror should also be clothed in a white grave shroud which would be placed under the robe or cloak. The face should be streaked in blood red paint or blood, same with any bare skin shown. A personal item of the inteded opfer must be present, be it either a cloth, photograph, paper, etc. A crystal should also be present as well as bones, dagger, above the altar the Wamphyri - Varcolaci Pentagram and the Sigil of Nachttoter - The Red Dragon. This night you shall become vengence and anger - The law of Abraxas is implemented - The spirit of Kali is invoked. Love causing destruction to those who have crossed you. The Red Death Awakes Shrouded in the habliments of the grave, take in your hands the grave soil in which you have blessed as your own, in the other the crystal within which you store your acausal energy.
