There is not one single hmnan concept or cherished thought that maintains its all inclusiveness and soundness in the face of our inevitable appointment with death. It is common knowledge that the average person spends much of their time avoiding thoughts about death, especially their own. This is normal, and it is also the way evolution set things up. In order for a species to thrive, it must concem itself with life. It must emphasize those things in creation that best lead to its own survival. Is it any wonder that sex is one of our most all consmning concems? IT it were not, I can guarantee you that the hmnan species would have died out thousands of years ago. Sorcerers are individuals who purposefully cultivate new, non-ordinary modes of awareness and perception in reference to how they deal with the world around them. Through a sorcerer's cultivated struggle on the path of knowledge, they have come to understand that there are certain attainable energetic truths which under­lay the very fabric of all that we have been taught to selectively perceive as beings with awareness."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"How we have been socialized to think about and interact with the force of death plays a vital role in shaping our overall world view, particularly for a sorcerer. When through tremendous effort, our assemblage point finally shifts and we begin to see the world in new and unfamiliar terms, we will learn to reevaluate those human experiences that have held a dominant position for all of our known history. Anger is transformed into ferocity, love takes on a depth previously impossible to comprehend and death becomes a true companion and ally. The Left Hand Path sorcerer, through their redefining of death begins to revitalize their very existence by way of this relationship and reemphasis. Every culture has its own particular way of relating to and understanding death. A thorough examination of these various cultural interpreta­tions is a necessary part of our own re­socialization in regard to this core human and nonhuman experience. I believe that every one of us should spend time familiarizing ourselves with the way cultures and civilizations around the world and throughout history have approached death as an integral phenomenon of daily life. Here we will find strange commonal­ities as well as greatly unique distinctions. The idea of an afterlife, death as an anthropomorphic and sentient force, and the importance of funerary rites are but a few of these areas of interest, as well as indicators as to how we have attempted to make comprehensible that which is rooted in the unfathomable depths of infinity. 14 Human beings and on the planet earth mon.

The wise embrace and embody this fundamental truth, and through their perceptual adjustment, they create a special kind of relationship with the force of death, which in turn profoundly changes their relation­ship with the force of life, intent itself. To walk with death means that one only developed a relationship with death as a manifestation of life, but also that we have redefined our intemalized understanding of death and all the cognitive and emotional conno­tations that we associate with death. Embracing death is essential. First a basic, deep realization must take place within us. This realization was painstakingly cultivated by Buddhist monks for hundreds of years, and we sorcerers will take the liberty to adopt many of their more effective practices. Meditations conceming one's own death and visualizations of one's dead body are major parts of these techniques and will be combined with the vampyric sorcery techniques of the Left Hand Path. The realization that I speak of is a bodily knowledge that life defines death and death defines life. This comes with an almost automatic understanding that just like the mysteries of the dreamer and the dream; death cannot know life directly as life cannot know death. The essence of the vampyric twilight is that point in consciousness where the dreamer and the dream are fully realized.

Sorcerers agree on this point and adopt the naturally arising altemative angle with regard to energy and its immutable laws. This is the \"third point\" as it is called. Energy cannot be created because the source of all energy is a matrix of potentiality known as dark matter, or as some have called it non-existence. This is an erroneous term that smacks of old school kabalistic thought and does not truly capture that perceptual and energetic mystery that dark matter is and is not. No living being can self generate their energy, and according to the ancient Toltec sorcerers, that left human beings with only a few options regarding the accumulation of additional energy, as well as the storage and saving of energy. If we start with the supposition that we, as energy­generating beings cannot actually create energy from scratch, and that in order to perform the incomprehensible acts of sorcery we so desire we need to have more energy that normal, then we come to the conclusion that there must be a way to simply get and save more energy that we currently have."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"According to the ways of the Toltec sorcerers, an energetic redeployment of our initial energy is the first task that we must undergo before we can move on to anything else. The Toltec and other South American sorcerer's understood that we begin our life growth with a specific amount of limited energy and that in order to perform feats of sorcery; we had to redirect this energy into different channels than those normally utilized during the course of our daily lives. They argued that the majority of our given energy is continually utilized for upholding, or making sense out of the world we live in. This extends from the actual act of organizing sensory data, all the way to investing in a particular set of beliefs or social norms. All these acts require our attention, and that attention demands energy. A redeployment of energy entails a consciously chosen diversion away from those well established and routine perceptual and even physical paths that our energy typically follows out of habit and conditioning. This is why human 1 '�MiWi'c beings crave unique experiences. When something very new is experienced, one's energy is drawn away from its routine path and an expansion of consciousness follows. This expansion of consciousness is typically associated with a spiritual or religious experience. I can tell you that this association is a very common, but dire mistake. The liberation of energy and expansion of awareness has NOTHING to do with anything spiritual.

Recognizing this common mistake will save you decades of floundering in a sea of mysticism and self denial. The true sorcerer knows that non-ordinary experience leads to expanded perception, which in tum leads to expanded capabilities for the sorcerer . We have chosen to use the model and concept of the assemblage point because of its total applicability to an energetic system of sorcery and the fact that there are no spiritual or religious overtones with its application. I will �se a working understanding of the assemblage pomt throughout this work and the reader is advised to consult other works for a full understanding of its existence, purpose and qualities. So, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, and because we need to revamp how we expend our energy in order to break the confines of our ordinary perception, then it also follows that once these bounds are broken, the real, concrete realm of possibility expands threefold. How do I arrive at this? When the assemblage point moves, new possibilities are made manifest as a side effect of a new position of the assemblage point.

Our position of the assemblage point that while we cannot change the very fabric of energetic reality, we can however modify it. This is the next step in the sorcerer's conclusion regarding the law of the conservation of energy. It is that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but it can be redirected, stored and modified to serve an endless array of purposes. These purposes are not those of the ordinary individual, but revolve around the abstractions of sorcery, although they may at times appear to be driven by common desires. The preservation of the self for the pursuit of non-human evolution is not the same drive to regain or retain one's youth in the spirit of useless and self indulgent nostalgia. One of these purposes is to extend one's physical existence and individual consciousness indefinitely as possible. This is not only completely conceivable; it is also a direct and inevitable side effect of the practice of sorcery itself. With the liberation of our ordinary awareness and the expansion of our ability to perceive comes a real, physical change on a bio-atomic level within the body. As we learn to relate to time differently, our bodies react and ordinary ageing simply slows down.

The Left Hand Path is the path to power for the individual strong enough to tread it. In the shadow realm, equality is a lie and a conceptual perversion of the natural order. Of course, permanent physical immortality is not yet possible, but it is however quite conceivable that within a few short decades human beings will have discovered and implemented the means to create total cellular regeneration. This coupled with the most potent sorcery techniques known will combine to form a virtually unbeatable combination, but for now we must apply our efforts in slightly different ways until the future is dreamed into truth. There is a certain point, or energetic threshold that every Left Hand Path sorcerer will approach after they have become saturated with the undoing of the Backwards Way. The assemblage point will have moved a sufficient number of times and far enough that more energy will be required to continue on the Left Hand Path.

This is not a total inevitability, but the path of the Death Deifier is one with the path of the vampire. All throughout the works of Carlos Castaneda we hear about saving and storing energy. Don Juan literally pound it into his sorcery apprentices that the energy that one is hom with is all that there is available. Conveniently, this is the perfect thing to tell young sorcery apprentices when they are first embarking on the path that leads into Nod, but saving and storing one's personal energy eventually does become a perfected act that one continually employs like a cat that constantly cleans themselves out of habit and natural instinct. It is not until Castaneda's book the Art of Dreaming (1993) that we encounter a sorcerer who desperately required that he be given extra energy by another sorcerer to sustain his stagger­ingly long life span. The implication of this act of energy transferral completely contradicted what Don Juan had been telling his apprentices all along. This was probably because he wanted to steer them far away from the abhorrent practices of the old sorcerers; those beings that did achieve a form of immortality, and still influence the current course of our sorceries today. The death defier we speak of here used excess energy given to him freely by another sorcerer for the sole purpose of extending his life.

The sign is usually a blatant gesture by one's victim that will forge a quick and unmistakable temporary link between the vampyric sorcerer and the victim. The ancient sorcerer's were indeed expert manipulators of the life force, and I am convinced that modem tales of vampires have come directly from stories related to these Toltec and South American sorcerers and others throughout history. Vampirism, in part, is the art that concems itself with the individual extension of one's life through the manipulation of vital life energy and the manipulation of one's awareness towards strictly non-ordinary goals. Castaneda's \"death defier\" is the perfect example of a sorcerer who has extended their own individual consciousness far beyond that of the average person, and he did this with sorcery techniques that were the parent techniques of those that we now employ. The world has changed in unbelievable ways over the last hundred years, and our quickening technol­ogy will only help those of us who dwell in darkness. Be not opposed to the future and the wonders that it may hold in the realm of ordinary human affairs, for our world of twilight and shadows feeds off of the glaring energy of the very mundane, and we are able to put to good use that which goes unnoticed or discarded among the living."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"I am not going to go into the details conceming blood versus energy as a choice for vampyric sustenance because there has been far too much time and literature devoted to this issue.

For the sorcerer, there are ordinary human beings and other sorcerers; Sheep and wolves. The most annoying kind of sheep is the one pretending to be a wolf. First of all, you will not successfully experience any form of vampyric sorcery until the fundamentals of sorcery itself are mastered, and secondly if by that time you still feel guilty about taking the life essence from other energy generating beings in order to extend you own life, then you should probably consider other methods. The beings that still retain individual awareness today after countless centu­ries have barely a memory of what it felt like to be human. They cultivated states of being which defies the human form, and eventually altered their own energy shape forever. Is this but one of the many paths that evolution has taken in the struggle for existence and dominance?

More often than not each individual vampire has always felt almost utterly discon­nected from the average ordinary world of human beings, yet they usually display an uncanny ability to adapt to mundane situations and changes in a detached and ultimately fluid manner. It has been my experience that the process of undead initiation takes place in short, cataclysmic ordeals set in between longer periods of adaptation and re-evaluation of one's subjective and objective multi-verse. The black magicians who find themselves penetrating the mysteries of vampyric development will notice early on, even if they are not familiar with the terminology, that the Left Hand Path philosophy and key points of understanding must be stabilized within the psyche and constantly utilized in one's objective world. The sorcerer cannot achieve increasingly vampyric states of existence while oriented on the Right Hand Path. The Right Hand Path magician does not mind that they will eventually give up their physical existence and merge into oneness with their conception of god head. We do however mind. One also cannot comprehend the vampyric state from a dualistic viewpoint. For the sorcerer, the Right Hand Path itself becomes more of a fictional abstraction, where once such a prevalent duality did exist.

These experi­ences in turn work to further free the black magician's awareness, creating greater potential and further isolating their psyche against the objective universe. Remember, what we dark sorcerers refer to as the objective universe is the combined inertia of the common socio-perceptual agreements of the majority of human beings on the earth at a given point in time. This is a process that all grades of black magicians are engaged in, but one that the vampyric sorcerer is swom to push to the ultimate extremes, creating and sustaining a second twilight field of reality within which to dwell safely while further power is gained and continued development takes place.

The whole process may be likened to a descending spiral model, and as long as the sorcerer does not become overly enthralled and mesmerized by the intricacies of each new tunnel, then they will be capable of averting disaster.

There is no white magic, just the personal illusion that one is performing sorcery in a selfless manner for the good of others. Complete selfishness in disguise. A vampyric sorcerer does not necessarily have to consciously practice any concrete form of black magic in order to be performing it. At this level, the sorcerer is an act of black magic in and of themselves, and they exist in natural opposition to the rest of the world. There is no happy medium and no bargains may really be struck between one's humanity and the vampyric state. This is true when one enters the world of sorcery and it is an even deeper realization for the vampire. So what is the major distinction between a sorcerer and a vampyric sorcerer? Well, to begin with the vampyric sorcerer will choose to devote more of their energy to perfecting energy gather­ing techniques.

An analysis traditional vampire mythology and folklore will provide great insight into the nature of V ampyric sorcery. First, the preferable time of operating for any sorcerer is during the hours of night. There are actual reasons for this elaborated on by occultists over the centuries. The main reason that we prefer this time for our regular daily activities is because it is the direct opposite of the commonly accepted waking time for most human beings. The collective awareness of immeasurable numbers of human beings creates an established, routine flow of energy, which in turn aids in keeping the assemblage points of hundreds of thousands of people in its customary position. When great numbers of people in a particular geographical location are sleeping, it allows for a very real loosening of the assemblage point for those who are awake at that time. Sorcerers and witches have always known that the best time to influence the target of their spells is the wee hours of the early morning when most people are sleeping and the self imposed constraints of mundane reality are loosened by their slumber."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The vampire had traditionally been lmown to cast no reflection in a mirror, or to avoid mirrors at all costs. This captures the meaning of the vampire's quest to move beyond the self-reflective nature of ordinary human beings. A vampyric sorcerer will see less and less of their human nature as they look into a mirror over the decades. What is a mirror to a mortal anyway but a time keeping device where they can gradually watch them­selves age away into nothing. Not so for the immortals. The freedom from obsessive self­reflection is avidly sought out by the vampire, as it leads to a loosening of personal boundaries like no one technique can do. The less a sorcerer is identified with haphazardly socially constructed personality, the more energy they will have to consciously and intelligently restructure themselves in a manner most consistent with their highest or lowest aspirations. Vampires do avoid mirrors, because mirrors, above all else reflect reality on one level only. The vampyric sorcerer seeks freedom from the daylight and all that is so harshly illuminates. With the embracing of darlmess comes lmowledge of the powerful magic of shadow. In shadow, those things that are merely hinted at become solid and tangible.

Every time we descend into the realm of sleep it serves a purpose. The intent of the vampyric sleep is to create lucid dreaming experiences that will later serve as a jumping off point for vampyric feeding. For the sorcerer, sleep is either used for rejuvenation and life extension, or for lucid dreaming. Please see Liber Obsidian Obscura (Dark Harvest Occult Publishing, 2010) for a more detailed explanation of the intricacies of dreaming and the movement of the assemblage point. Now, being that the sorcerer intentionally treats every day routines as specific acts of power, it is crucial that the black magician engage their dark energies in transforming their regular mundane sleep time into something else. This begins with the hours that one rests. Trying to maintain a strictly nocturnal lifestyle in today's fast paced, ever changing economy will often be very frustrating. While a nocturnal lifestyle is advised, it need not be totally adhered to.

The room need not be very large, and actually the smaller it is, the better. It must be big enough to house a rather sizeable box or coffin within which you will retire from the world. Sleeping in a large box is ideal for helping the generation of lucid dreams as it actually compresses the energy body and gives greater control over its function­ing. The ancient Toltec sorcerers combined the advantages of burying themselves in the earth with sleeping in a box by seeking out and utilizing small caves as sleeping/dreaming chambers. The coffin should be large enough for you to be able to assume different sleeping positions, and it must be as comfortable as possible. You are not trying to induce dreaming situations by making yourself uncomfortable, although that is indeed among the techniques that we will occasionally use. If you have the capability to purchase a large, or extra large coffin with luxurious satin lining, that would be even better.

This simply means you have properly channeled and focused the death current and the normal time/ space relations of the area are being disrupted.

The ancient Egyptians regarded one's shadow as a separate and distinct part of their multi -layered soul. They believed that one's physical shadow was the matrix for what they understood as their spiritual or etheric shadow. \"The SHADOW (Khabit): The shadow is seen as being of extreme importance. It is the source of one's power of mobility, and one's reproductive power. The shadow may be stolen while someone sleeps, causing the object of the theft to die. Certain powerful sorcerers can detach their shadows and send them on missions of harm or espionage. The shadow follows the dead into the Tuat, thus assuring his or her mobility there. The shadow held the sexuality of the being, and to the extent one's sexuality survived death it was through the shadow. The ba, ka, etc. did not have sexuality as a constituent\"(Webb, 1995).

The shadow has a substance unique to itself and because of this it needs to be exercised with what at first appears to be strict discipline. This shadow self exists beyond linear time and is intimately connected with our sexual energy and the dreaming body. It is not the dreaming body itself, but a shadowy aspect of it that needs to be continually revitalized and groomed with non­ordinary acts of power. The shadow acts when we least expect it, and often is it responsible for executing the most complex of maneuvers for us with very little provocation. It is almost as if the shadow can act independently of our waking consciousness, yet always according to our will, whether we are in touch with what we really want or not. One's shadow can be credited with a sense of direct knowing; sharply prophetic dreams and seeing an event unfold before us seconds before it actually does. The vampiric sorcerer seeks to help their shadow self emerge and to strengthen it beyond its normal human limitations. The average individ­ual has a shadow of their own, but through the calcification of their energy through daily routine and an automatic acceptance of the nature of the world, this shadow depletes its energy, mostly through acts of a sexual nature.

It has been documented that most poltergeist activity seems to surround teenage individuals going through a stormy period of puberty. The truth is that most poltergeist phenomenon and hauntings are tied to us or other people close to the situation and that most paranormal activity are explainable in terms of our own perception and energy levels. This will surely be discovered as science makes headway and expanding our overall understanding of how thought, biochemistry and bioelectrical energy can all combine to effect our environment . Ancient sorcerers worked intimately with their shadows, and some still do. The black magician will seek to exercise and reinforce their dark reflection so much that it will eventually become perceivable to themselves and others on a variety of levels. The act that will instantly begin this process is the feeding of the shadow, and it is a sorcery practice that is rare in modem times and varies from culture to culture. When I was initiated into Mrican shamanism, part of that initiation included the feeding of my shadow. I remember the ceremony well, and wrote down the details so that I would be able to pass this along as a semi-regular sorcery practice for the higher levels initiates.

I became noticeably stronger on a physical level, my dreaming practices became more manageable and my sex drive reached unanticipated levels. This increase in sexual appetite should be a direct and immediate symptom that one's shadow has been successfully fed. I have found over the years that shamanic based systems of magic and religion yield strangely concrete results that other more transcendental and spiritual systems do not. As soon as I began working with the inorganic entities and deities of the Mro-Cuban lines, I was astounded at the objective responses that I got to my efforts. This phenomenon was explained in a very simple way to me by an elder in my own lineage when she said, \"it works because they are real.\" This state­ment truly summed up how the magical-religious approaches of Voodoo, Palo, Santeria, related to by people immersed in them. The ceremonies and daily magical ritual practices of shamanic based belief systems are not gener­ally engaged in as a form of preparation for some form of idealized afterlife. They are worked over and over again in an almost aggressive manner, usually for solid material concems and the accumulation of personal power.

Before attempting to feed the shadow, recommend having reached the first gate dreaming as described by Carlos Castaneda in the Art of Dreaming. This means that the sorcerer had become capable of reaching a high degree of wakefulness during the course of ordinary dreams. The task of the first gate is to become as awake as possible in a dream and to \"isolate\" dreaming objects by looking at them in short glances before they fade or ch�e into something else. This practice will hone the sorcerer's skills for visualization on a level that is far beyond the ordinary, and such skill at visuali­zation will be essential in the regular practice of feeding, as well as in the overall movement away from the human form. Castaneda explained that holding onto the images of one's dreams would cause a temporary ch�e in the shape of one's energy body. This practice will also tend to give the shadow a greater r�e of possible activity and stronger influence in the world of daily affairs. It is with the power of one's shadow and energy body combined that vampyric feeding is done. The ritual for feeding the shadow should be done as directed in this text until the need for any alteration or variation presents itself in a most obvious manner. This will, as always usually occur in dreaming.

As part of the Mro-Cuban religions, blood sacrifices are common and are utilized in many ways for many reasons, however I will not personally endorse such acts. In the ritual of the feeding of the shadow, I will only mention at what point the sacrifice would traditionally be made. The important thing to remember is that at this point, some form of physical life force transference must be made into the actual shadow of the sorcerer in order for the funda­mental nourishment to take effect. To perform the ritual without the necessary transference of vital life force would simply result in an empty ceremony performed for little reason at all. The sorcery of the Left Hand Path is above all things pragmatic, and there are certain basic energetic rules that must be adhered to in order to ensure The importance of the skill of visualization cannot be understated, and it is this skill, force­fully honed over many years that will eventually lead to the vampire's ability to easily manipulate energy at many levels.

Those with an unusual ability for controlling the contents of their dreams often have an easier time with visualization, but these same individu­als would do very well to keep in mind the importance of self discipline as they advance with the higher practices. The subtle energy of the multi-verse can indeed be made to move in accordance with one's will. On an every day level, ordinary people expect certain things to happen in life, and eventually these expectations play out. You could say that although the average human being is not skilled in the realms of intent or visualization, they are still consummate sorcerers. It is their very non-ordinary expecta­tions which, unknown to them actually move the energies about them. The only difference between the sorcerer and the average person is that the sorcerer intends this movement in the direction of their desire, and the average person intends it in ignorance of their true capability. Human beings are geared towards perceiving pattems in seeming randomness. They take chaos and make it into something.

In Voodoo, these characters are called veves, and are created with a variety of substances, usually employing white com meal or powdered egg shells as a base. In Voodoo, veves are ritually drawn in order to evoke and invoke the power of the Loa. The substances used to create each design are always formulated in harmony with the Loa to be interacted with.

Paleros would enact a pact with both elemental spirits and the future Paleros of their sorcery lineage, promising to serve the living sorcerers from beyond the grave whenever they were called. The palero's ponto would be ritually charged and utilized as a form of recognition; a nexus of power where the shadow of the deceased sorcerer could cross over and be given a semi-substantial form by the living sorcerers. This type of purposely intended necromancy was unique in that its power was built up over decades of adherence to black magical techniques of a particular sorcery line. Each line would have its own personalized ceremonies and techniques, but just as with feeding the shadow, they contain core components that must be used as a kind of fundamental structure for the intent of the operation itself. The vampyric sorcerer will actively seek such a personal power symbol through dreaming thereby allowing the sigil to manifest directly from the unknown itself. Go into dreaming with the intent of finding as simple a sigil as possible, and if the sigil cannot be obtained directly through dreaming, then it will surely manifest as a persistent thought in one's mind on a regular basis.

Eventually, the vampyric sorcerer will need to develop the ability to see their personal sigil from the depths of their own death as the future sorcerers of their line cast that specific mark in order to evoke them from beyond the grave. One's sigil should be used as both a magical signature as well as a pictorial symbol of intent, and in this way truly captures the shadow essence of the vampire. Have it fashioned into power talismans in the forms of medallions or rings, and then seek these personal power objects in dreaming. These objects will accrue massive amounts of dark dreaming energy over time, and will eventually be buried with the mummified remains of the black magician. Each sorcerer will leave the world in a way that is unique to them, so in many cases, the sorcerer's personal power objects will become sorcery heirlooms used to evoke their presence and power down through the ages. The vampyric sorcerer's personal sigil should have an almost electrical feel to it when encountered by others.

This is where the mythologi­cal ghoul has its roots. For our purposes, a ghul is the willing human or semi-human servant of a powerful vampyric sorcerer. They are related to familiar spirits in that they function as protectors, servants and sometimes even friends throughout the often lonely and long existence of a vampire. A sorcerer may even choose to purposely merge their human servant's consciousness and vital energy with that of an in­organic servitor, creating a living nexus and very unique power ally.

Suffice it to say that in the beginning, this merging may be intended and the seeds of it may be nurtured, but it will take time for an inorganic ghul and a human servant to become one. There are strange future sorceries that will most certainly manifest which will enable the vampyric sorcerer to energetically implant an inorganic entity into the physical body of their chosen servant."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The ghul is a time consuming and initially drain­ing affair, but one that will pay off greatly down the nocturnal road. The very first manifestation of the ghul will occur as a strange sort of relation­ship develops between the vampyric sorcerer and someone of their acquaintance. This can be a friend, lover or other relation. Their will be a natural dark resonance which will be very recog­nizable to both parties; more so to the sorcerer than the future ghul. The vampire must consciously home in on this initial subtle resonation and intend its amplification. The way to do this is to meditate in a room full of shadows. Light a few candles, or build a fire in the hearth. Sit in a comfortable chair and let yourself relax into a semi-dreaming state. Now think of your human companion. Breathe in their essence and focus on their particular \"feel.\" After you have a good strong pulse of their energy going, move your attention to the connection between the two of you. See this connection as a thick and deep shadow of no particular shape that connects the two of you, even over great distances. Feel the energy of this shadow line and know that it is heavy and strong. These are very abstract propositions, but the power of these visualizations will move the intended dark energy in an already pre-determined direction.

A good ghul will be capable of making things appear as if the vrunpire actually has a day side identity, acting in the place of its vrunpyric master. Mter the initial energetic connection between the ghul and its master has been established, ritual sorceries will need to be employed to further strengthen then bond and give the vrunpire the type of magical dominance that they will need to create a successful and lasting relationship. The ghul will need to periodically take part in consuming small quantities of their master's blood in a ceremonial setting. The ritual for nourishing one's servant will follow, but all the details of this act are basically geared towards setting up the energetic currents of a slave and master relationship. In the sorcerer's world there are always those beckoning at one's portal, eager to serve. It is in their nature, and by their very servitude, they will be able to partially descend into the Tunnels of Set with their master, eventually finding and establishing a place for themselves in the sorcerer's realm. It is a means to an end both for the ghul and the vrunpyric master. Ghuls should live, at all times with their vrunpire as they are guards, servants and magical partners of a sort."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Often a vampire's ghul will come to experience residual dark powers simply through their constant proximity to their master. These commonly manifest as greater dreaming ability, acute telepathy and the ability to shape shift into one or more of the vampire's power animals. Spirits of the dead will also make their presence known to the ghul, almost as if they attracted to them like a sort of beacon. union between ghul and vampyric sorcerer is desired only if the vampire is skilled with sexual magic. The sexual union can be as intimate as is desired however, it is important for the sorcerer to make a conscious effort at sharing only small portions of their energy, and avoiding being unnecessarily drained. Sexual union between a vampire and servant is best done through anal copulation and with the proper use of the corresponding qlipphottic tunnel energies. Anal copulation in itself energetically symbolizes the descent of the black magician into the tunnels and their existence on the Night Side of the Tree of Life. The sexual energy here is directed at nurturing the sorcerer and ghul's shadow substance, rather than directing it towards the human tendency to procreation. The magical formula for anal copulation is that of the will of the black magician extended into the abyss. It mirrors the act of creation for the purposes of the self rather than for the bettering of the species.

The secret to vampyric karezza is to circulate the built up energy through the body, centering finally in the hands. The power then accumulated may be used as a magnetic build up of energy, making it easier to sap the life out of any victim whether dreaming or in actual physical proximity. Sealing the Ghul This method is utilized in co-operation with your ghul in order to create a stronger energetic bond. The connection will allow the vampire the ability to send his/her consciousness into the ghul and experience what they experience. It will allow the vampire to communicate with the ghul over great distances and create a permanent 'tap' for energetic feedings when the need arises. The ghul will also gain some benefits from this practice as well. S/he will be granted glimpses into the altemate realities visited by his/her host vampire and can gain boosts of energy for their own progress in Initiation. illtimately, the Ghul I Vampire relationship works in benefit of both parties.

Instead of the Vampire sitting in front of the Portal and shifting his/her consciousness into the Shadow, the Ghul is placed in front of the Vampires Portal. Once s/he is placed in front of the Portal, the Vampire positions him/herself so that they can clearly see the reflection of the Ghul but not the reflection of themselves.

It requires some time and effort, however the payoff is well worth the investment. Humans are known for their proclivity for weakness and/ or comfort. Humans will literally invest vast amounts of their vitality into wasteful ends such as gambling, drinking alco­hol, using illicit drugs, sexual debauchery, etc. The vampire can recognize this weakness in an individual and learn to tap into these energetic leaks of the human population. A human should carefully be selected for this proc­ess. The process will be easier if it is someone you already know, however 'befriending' someone new can also work. Pick out a person with one clearly defined vice. This may be actually more diffi­cult than it sounds. Most weak individuals have a multitude of vices so finding a person with one glaring issue can be a hard task. I am not referring to someone who has a few drinks on the weekend. This vice has to be an all consuming affair with the individual. Once the person has been chosen, the vampire will become a friend to that person and act in a way as one would act with any friend, however, the vice is never to be brought up.

The target victim should not be aware of this (or any other) part of the process. The second step is to quietly begin to put that person into situations where they are likely to invest even more energy into their vice. Strategically begin to place obstacles into their path. Once they have reached a dangerous point, begin to help them seek help to eliminate the vice from their lives. Constantly create tension and self doubt in them without revealing your nature to them. Once they begin to make progress in their rehabilitation, again, place them in situations where their vice will appeal greatly to them. During this whole span of destruction and rehabilitation, it is important to gather the energy that they invest in their vice and to collect it through dreaming. The cycle of rehabilitation and faltering to the vice should be continually repeated until the source is depleted of energy. The greater the intemal conflict that the victim suffers, the more potent the release of energy will be each time they indulge in the vice they are trying so hard to escape. 82"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"� e ubject, yet do either.

In truth, all earthbound inorganic entities are rooted in the elements and the vampire will no doubt find that they have a strangely pronounced affinity with one or more of these kingdoms and its denizens. Early on my path, I found that I had an unusual connection to the power of the wind. As I grew older is seemed that there were even times that I could consciously connect with the intent of the wind and interact with it in a wholly non-ordinary way. Then, I began having reoccurring dream experiences where I could create whirlwinds, ride the wind or feel the wind's power and pulling inside my body. Years of developing this unusual relationship led me to begin to under­stand the elemental connections that become strengthened as we proceed along the path that goes between worlds.

In the modes of red sorcery, the downward most point of the inverse pentagram. is ascribed to the element of Time. As sorcerers concemed with our utmost potential, we seek to extend our lives and awareness and this cannot be done without a mastery of the element of Time.

Time is a subjective experience, and yet a shared continuum at many levels, depending upon who is sharing what experience at what time. Time roots us in place inside our personal field of existence, and we gain more and more control over it as it flows onto us with each new barrier that we break down.

The Blood is the power and the carrier of the primordial Intent of what is to be. The Blood speaks to us as sorcerers on several levels and it is that which is at the core of the red magic that we practice. Blood has power in and of itself, but blood as a substance is both sacred and taboo depending upon the culture, time and place one finds one's self in. We hold the Blood more sacred that those who worship the Christ and who partake of the transmutation of his blood and body. These rituals had so much power in past centuries gone by, but with time and evolution the very meaning of things change and twist with each human advancement. The ancient pagan spilled the blood of humans and animals on the throne of their deity, and they knew that the God was nourished thereby and could now act in unseen, unknown ways to influence the daily events of a harsh and barbaric ancient world. The Nosferatu and Strigoi discovered the secrets of Blood Sorcery and consumption and ruled those who would have destroyed them. The sorcerers of ancient South America and Mexico become immersed in the secrets of the vital fluids and thus opened up gates into other, nearby worlds; our twin shadow earth with all its inhabitants. The Mrican priests and sorcerer shed the blood of animals in highly complicated and difficult ceremonial processes and made non-human allies who bestowed upon them unimaginable power. Blood has played a central role in magic"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"religion since before the beginning of recorded history and it has only been in modem times that the subject of blood as a thing of power has become considered taboo at best and criminal at the worst. This is not altogether a bad thing as that which is popularly shunned becomes a veritable wellspring of power for the intelligent and cunning Adept of the Left Hand Path. The few systems of sorcery that still employ blood are most certainly shamanic in essence and typically Mrican in origin as these traditions have in some traditional lineages remained almost completely unchanged. Those who profess the idea that these systems can be utilized without the spilling of vital essence are utterly fooling themselves no matter how good their intentions may be. This is not my opinion as a black magician, it is an energetic fact that I have acquired through decades of intimate interaction in these practices and I have most certainly seen both extremes with regard to the variously employed methods dealing in vital essence. We of the Black School strive to see things for what they are and not what we would ideally like to see them be. The employment of vital essence is an ancient and powerful method of attainment and there is no getting around this.

The earth is alive and we are vitally connected to it from the minute we are bom until the moment we pass beyond this world. In strictly sorcery terms, the earth is our dark mother that gives us the very powers we seek. We seek to energetically link ourselves to the earth's awareness and to use her huge reservoirs to propel us into other worlds. We bury ourselves as the ancient sorcerers did in order to re-energize and repair our physical and energy bodies. We seek a jolt from the power of the earth so that we may pass beyond those mundane conditions that are responsible for holding back the individual and the human race as a whole. As vampyric sorcerers, we work with the dark shadow magic of the Earth and its substance is also the basis for many of our work. The Earth for us is a potent, magical substance that goes into everything that we do. Seek out and collect earth from those specific locations where the most powerful and meaningful events of your life have taken place.

The top left hand comer of the pentagram infemal is attributed to the diabolic element of Flame, as the Blood is to water, Flame is the fire that bums that which hinders us along the path and transports us to other realms of elemental consciousness. The ancient vampyric sorcerers used both the elements of water and fire in specialized forms of magic that emphasized their ability or faculty of being able to affect the energy body of the sorcerer. Using dreaming and gazing techniques, sorcerers can link their energy bodies to the fluid and moving aspect of flame or water in order to \"move\" with them into other realms of possibility and Awareness.

The top right hand comer is given the attribute of Shadow as the fifth vampyric element that is integral to the sorcery of the Blood and Darkness. What we have chosen to become is accomplished through a sublime and applied re-definition of the world, with a pronounced emphasis on the in-betweens of reality. These are the gateways to Penumbra; the Realm of Shadows and we give special attention to the development of that part of the \"soul\" the ancient Egyptian sorcerer called the shadow, or Khabit. The shadow is of a substance unlike any other and it relies on the other infemal elements for its mobility, substance and unique self identification. The shadow perfected is indistin­guishable from the self in its completely self­actualized form.

This is a truly interesting exrunple of how our base perception is molded to fit into the over­all evolutionary prerogative of our social majority.

Just as the very atoms in your body are not those that you possessed a year ago, so the darkness reflects this self-renewing property. As time passes, the atoms and molecules of your body are expelled and new atoms take the place of the old. The ancient sorcerers knew that we were not merely static, solid objects existing on a linear time line. They could see that we were beings with awareness who exhibited constantly changing fluctuations of energy. We are bonded energy, continuously fluctuating. We truly exist only now, with a memory of the moment that has just elapsed and visions of an imagined future. For sorcerers, energy is the first reality, and we can merge ours with that of far greater energetic features of the multi-verse at large. Sit in total darkness and begin to breathe the darkness into your body. See and feel it filling you. The boundaries between your skin and the darkness will become blurred with time.

It also resembles the technique of feeding off of the energy of large crowds of people. The grand transfiguration is wholly geared towards the realigning of one's human energetic emanations. All those rites and sorceries of the Left Hand Path which fall into the realm of dream sorcery are rooted both in the objective reality of the vampiric sorcerer, as well as the shifting night sands of dreaming.

Crowley was truly the first magician to hint at the possibility of such an inhuman transformation. He came close to understanding the intricacies of the Night Side of the Tree of Life while expound­ing on his understanding of the three schools of magic in his text Magic without Tears. Here, he breaks down his understanding of the three schools of magic, calling them the white, yellow and black schools respectively. These schools have, as their foundations basic metaphysical views that are supported by Kabalistic and ener­getic formula. A magician, through their magical development eventually finds themselves aligned with one of these three schools and their sorcery practices become rooted in the structural formulas that naturally occur in the cosmos and give rise to the existence of these schools of magic. Crowley understood the white school as subscrib­ing to the view that all of existence is, at its basic root, joy. Crowley was aligned with this school, and his Book of the Law reflects the innermost tenets of the white school of magic. For the white school, existence is pure joy and suffering is a temporary illusion, leading eventually to a pure"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"state of universal joy. The magickal formula of the while school is love under will. The yellow school has given birth to human philosophies of total neutrality, and Taoism is the most reminis­cent of these. The doctrine of the yellow school states that Existence is simply existence, and that the goal of creation and life itself is simply for energy and consciousness to find balance. All acts of interference for good or evil are seen by the adherents of the yellow school as futile, as the universe will eventually find the line of least resistance and create balance. Sorcerers of the Yellow school rarely intervene in anything and their sorcery is compatible with their total alignment of their very beings with nature itself. The magickal formula of the yellow school is absorption. The black school essentially views existence as suffering, and its magickal formula is dispersion, or separation. Crowley compared the philosophy of the black school of magic with the religious tenets of certain branches of Buddhism. I truly believe that Crowley was very confused in his understanding of the doctrines of the black school. He explains that the black school views all of existence as sorrow, which means that the only way to transcend such universal sorrow is through detachment. This, of course is one of the goals of Buddhism. I understand why Crowley made this comparison, but his inexperience with our school left him in a position to somewhat haphazardly fill in the blanks.

Yes, it could be simply stated that the black school understands existence to be sorrow, if you define the extinguishing of individual conscious­ness and the transitory nature of life as sorrow­ful. Crowley was on the right track, but he simply had no affiliation with the masters of the black school. The schools themselves are total in their universal views. Once a sorcerer finds themselves belonging to a particular school they are caught in energetic currents that multiply and initiate further progress along those specific paths within that particular school. The magicians of the three schools are utterly unable to see the views of the other two schools as having any basis of truth . Their philosophies and energetic formulas that sustain their very essence are self-containing. Crowley struggles with his lack of understanding, and in his novel Moonchild, he portrays sorcerers of the black school as entrenched in rash behaviors, with a lack of intelligence and devoid of real purpose. He does, however slightly touch, unknowingly upon one of the greater esoteric formulas of the black school. Our school of magic is more ancient than the birth of both other schools, as our essence is a universal formula derived from the undeniable darkness that is space itself.

Crowley saw Choronzon as absolute chaos, the master of dispersion, and from his school of orientation, this is true. The white magician seeks unification with the mind of the universe, the yellow adept seeks to expand and neutralize all consciousness. The black magician covets the Black Flame that is their individual consciousness, feeding it and fortifying it against the flow of Infinity. They encapsulate their unique essence in a protective shell in order that they may continue, as this is the evolution­ary prerogative of the adherents of the black school, and it will be those black adepts that are the ancestors of those who do survive the millennia to go beyond all that humanity has ever known."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":".

Their sorcery technique will not have the effect that they intended. Sometimes nothing happens at all. Sorcerers all have to learn to conserve their energy in order for continual success and for this reason the magician can regain some of the energy that they invested in the working of failed magic. The expended energy is allowed to continue in the path that it was sent during acts of successful magic only because it is the spark that gives life to the manifested results. In acts of failed magic, there are still results they just are the unintended and undesired results. There is no specific technique to reclaiming the energy from the failed magic. The key to reclaim­ing that energy is to identify the unwanted manifestations and to spend a little more energy to counter those results. Once the failed magic is countered the sorcerer can reabsorb that energy through Portal work. There are a few categories of failures of magic that are commonly encountered. What follows is a description of these failures and how they may be countered. Each of the failures is usually noticed because it disrupts the laws of consensual reality."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Manifesting Failure: This is a very common type of failure where the magic causes entities to manifest in unproductive ways to the Vampire. Egergores, Deities, Thought Forms, etc all can manifest as a result of unforeseen elements to the magical process or to the situation leading to the necessitation of the magic. This magic is usually countered by banishings that the magician is already familiar with, however the challenge may lie in identifying the entity. Chaos Failure: This is an extremely hard failure to recognize because they sometimes appear as just unfortunate or negative natural events. This failure causes ill effects upon random individuals. This is countered, at times, by reversing the magical technique originally used or by countering the manifestations in the random individuals. Blatant Failure: This failure is easy recognize as it produces the exact opposite as the desired effects. This failure is also the easiest to counter. The magician should simply take the results of the failure head -on and there by achieving the original desired results. Worm Failures: This failure is the most danger­ous because it causes health problems (either mental, physical or both) and leaves the Vampire in a weakened state and less likely to be able to counter the results. The best counter of this failure is Rite of Burial (chapter 16) in which the energy received is from the earth itself.

I have found that these failures consume all of the original energy investment rather quickly because of their overtly physical nature. With that in mind, I would recommend letting them run their course unless retrieving that energy is absolutely necessary. Energy Retrieval: After the failure has been countered, the Vampire should employ a Portal technique in which the negative manifestation can be confronted one last time and where the Vampire can watch the manifestation or a symbol of that manifestation to dissolve into an energetic mist that can be breathed in by the Shadow. As a final step the Shadow should re-create the original, unsuccessful, ceremony and breath in the residual energy by visualizing every possible detail of the Working.

Death magick not only encompasses the throwing of curses and murder­ing others through magic, but also the techniques used to transform the self into the unimaginable by hamessing the double sided force of existence itself. Through the rites of death, transformation is attained and all initiation ceremonies in all magically minded cultures enact the ritual death of the self and the self's ascension into a higher (or lower) form. The crowning initiations of Voodoo and Santeria are aimed at shrinking the initiate's ego to the point where their guiding tutelary spirit will seat themselves physically inside the initiate's head. These ceremonies employ heavy doses of both death magic and the magic of creation. The adept black magician would do well to make a thorough and calculated study of death related customs throughout the world and seek to apply these findings to their practices in a personalized and distilled manner. The path of vampyric sorcery employs the red current as well as that of the black, and the major characteristics of red sorcery typically deal with aggression, war, the hunt, sex and blood. The refined vampyric sorcerer walks the line between worlds, and between the red and the black; death and life. All sexual sorcery concems itself with the undulations of the red serpent as all death sorcery does the black and all blood magic; the sorceries of the spilling of the blood and the sorcery of creating through the vital fluids are to be found in the realm of red magic.

We are not of the herd, and we are not fearful of the forbidden realms and that which is so often called taboo. In all actuality, the whole concept of the taboo includes within its core the practice of using taboos themselves so that they may eventually be intentionally broken. This is of course the intentional liberation of calcified awareness and it causes a small, sudden jolt in perception which can be further utilized to manipulate energy or even enter subtle dreaming states. A word of caution from one who has been initiated into genuine Mrican based religious systems and sorceries; do not reject that which you have had no direct experience of, and do not take the word of occultists who merely dabble in such areas as these systems demand concrete participation. Besides, to do otherwise would be more reminiscent of the actions of a Right Hand Path magician. The vampyric sorcerer employs black sorcery to keep then firmly seated between worlds, and in such a position they have greater access to the mastery of time and to an expansive set of new perceptual configurations.

Black sorcery also concems itself with the means and ways of causing and preventing death. The deeper secrets of red sorcery explore the use of blood magic in the non-ordinary pursuits of the sorcerer. The blood holds the code of all that we are and it is the most potent reservoir of energy in living organisms. In Mrican sorcery systems the concept of Ashe or Ache is foundational to all that the priestess, priest, bokhor, etc, does. Ashe can be described as the vibrational essence of a thing. It is akin to the material manifestation of a thing's true name if one were to see it from a Kabalistic point of view and terminology. But, ache is deeper than this. It is the Intent of a thing, and it can be tapped into and manipulated by the sorcerer if its intricate pattems of response and quality are known. There are three primary root, or base Ashes from which all other various energies are composed. Red Ashe, white and black. Ashe is the foundational energetic matrix of creation itself and the three main types are the first aspects of the differentiation of the universal energy. The three Ashes resemble the breaking into three of the main schools of magic. Red Ashe is found in the greatest concentration in animal blood. It is a powerful Ashe and is approached with the greatest caution. White Ashe is found most concentrated in semen, saliva and the breath itself. Black is found most concen­trated in the burnt ashes of any organic life, as well as in black minerals, particularly coal and black stones.

The earth is aware on levels that are extremely difficult for us to comprehend, as are the elements that make up the earth. The V ampyric sorcerer will use the energy of the earth for their continuous rejuvena­tion. This is done through regular ceremonial burial, and the objective effects of this are often astounding. There has been very little written on the subject of burial rituals and earth sorcery, but for us it is an essential topic.

I instantly connected with this energy and felt its potential to aid in my work Burial rituals should ideally be done at night, and if they are shorter in duration then they should be performed between the hours of two and four in the morning.

If at all possible, I advocate bringing a fellow sorcerer or Ghul to keep watch during the sensitive time of your immersion into the earth. Evoking a watcher is also a requirement that I feel should be attended to, and the methods to do this will be dealt with later. If you decide to perform the burial with a befriended black magician, you could even take two separate immersions, so both of you can benefit from the ceremony. The earth itself should ideally be soft enough to be able to dig into with relative ease. The ancient sorcerers would never think of using metal objects to dig the coffin; however I believe that this was an unnecessary taboo and a shovel will save you hours of sweat and frustration. There are two ways to construct your tomb. The first way is both ideal for performing your burial while alone, or if unable to find a helper. Don Juan elaborated on this and taught it to Castaneda so he could perform a burial specifi­cally to heal his energy body. It is also advisable to begin with this method as a way to acclimate your physical and energy body to the strong currents of the earth. This technique requires that you erect a coffin -like box out of plywood or sticks and branches found in the local vicinity. Leave only one end of the box-like structure open so you will be able to slide in. If you think that finding readily available limbs will be easy, I recommend this. Otherwise, feel free to bring some long pieces of plywood.

Once this has been done, begin to dig around the coffin, taking the excess earth and piling it around the base. Continue digging farther out, piling the earth on the coffin until it is completely covered. When you are ready to begin, slide into the hollow mound. Keep enough twigs and earth at the entrance so you can seal up the cell as much as possible from the inside. If you do this with another, they can seal up the entrance for you. Performing the initial burial technique will famil­iarize your body to this new experience, and should any sudden danger arise, you can always burst out of the wood and earth coffin with relative ease. I recommend wearing very loose fitting clothing at first, then gradually moving to wearing nothing at all. It will be important at some points to feel the cool dirt against your bare flesh, and you will be able to intuit when this would be beneficial. The second type of burial will entail digging a grave large enough to accommodate your body with room enough to move around and adjust your position while lying down if necessary. In this case, you will need to have a helper lay branches and leaves over the opening of the hole and then cover the grave with the loose earth. Make sure to keep an opening large enough for air flow, not so much because there will be any danger of suffocation, but because the stuffiness of the small space may become a distraction too early on in the experience. If you have absolutely"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"no one to help you in your sorcery, then you can always start out leaving the grave open and pulling as much loose dirt onto your body as is comfortable, leaving your neck and head exposed. This will not really diminish the effects of the immersion and you will still be able to feel a dramatic change in your perception. This kind of ceremomal burial can be done as often as you like, but should truly be reserved for a rejuvenation and replemshment of your energy. Any personal creative elaborations on burials are encouraged, as long as they are well thought out and their effects carefully noted. More than one or a group of sorcerers may find it beneficial to bury themselves together in a select location in order to strengthen the overall non-ordinary intent of the practice. Finally, as far as locations and material consid­erations are concemed, small caves may also be used. Keep in mind though that caves have a distinct energy all their own and a true burial will require bodily contact with as much earth as possible. I think that caves should be utilized, but not as a replacement for actual burial. The ceremony should begin in darkness and end in darkness, never after the sun has risen. This would be contrary to the intent of accumulating and storing the earth's dark, heavy energy within one's self. While content and encased in your grave, begin a relaxing cycle of deep breathing.

This is an ideal situation and if lucid dreaming occurs, all the better. This means that you have effectively used the energies of the earth and the non­ordinary act of burying yourself to achieve a new position of the assemblage point. This is where potent re-energizing will take place, and practiced visualization will most always end in varying degrees of lucid dream states. A very effective visualization which will increased dark energy and regeneration is to breathe in the darkness and energy of the earth until you feel it throbbing throughout your body. Let it expand and fill you until it is overflowing throughout your tomb. As you rise from the grave, pull all of this heavy, thick shadow with you and let it encase your body and energy body as you leave the area. With the ceremonial sorceries of burial, you will achieve new levels of vitality and enhanced awareness.

This is done first in the vampire's mind by pure force of will combined with the built up accumulation of energy set into motion through sustained acts of sorcery. On a very fundamental level, the budding vampiric sorcerer will be instructed by their elders on how to begin viewing other human beings as food for themselves. The way of the predator demands such a view, and although it seems to be a harsh one, it is not only a view, but a way of handling the world around one's self that causes a pronounced energetic break away from the energy of the human herd. Say it to yourself as you gaze into your black portal; \"human beings are food.\" Repeat this as a mantra throughout the years and feel its truth in your body as that very physical substance, which you have always equated with you, fades and transforms into the substance of dark matter. There has, throughout history been legendary individuals who naturally developed a mentality long these lines of reasoning.

The grand fantasy that many would be vampires have in these modem times is that the physical consumption of blood is wholly unnecessary for the vampire's maintenance of immortal existence. This is a basic fallacy stemming from the most recent resurgence in the occult movement of the 1990s. The hallmarks of this movement left their mark on the true world of the vampires based off of the modem magician's sorcery being mostly driven by techniques of visualization and much wishful thinking. Throw in some humanistic philosophy and righteous­ness and we have the birth of the modem \"energy vampire.\" The simple truth of the matter is that the vampire must, in conjunction with vital energy manipulation (which begins with techniques of visualization) consume large quantities of food that contains exceedingly high amounts of life force, prana, etc. Now, the truth of the matter is that human blood, being the substance of life for the most highly cognitive and evolved species on this planet contains the most concentrated degree of the life force available.

Of course, the vampiric sorcerer would do well to ingest large quantities of living vegetable matter on a daily basis to revitalize them and supple­ment their intake of other food stuff. Dead, cooked meat is useless to the vampire and does nothing to fortify their energetic self. It is actually responsible for slowing down our responses and dampening the influence of our shadow and our energy self. If meat is to be consumed, it must be fresh and barely cooked. Ideally, cooked meat should be prepared by using a citric acid base, such as lemon juice or lemon powder, as is done with some tropical dishes. Remember, we are trying to consume that which is alive. Most westem types of staple food are wholly out of the question for the vampire. Raw fish and shell fish hold very ideal quantities of prana, and should form a good portion of the vampire's diet. The general rule of thumb is that if animal substance is alive when it is consumed, or has been freshly killed, then one can absorb the naturally occurring energy of the being immediately. Now, human blood, being so potent must be taken by those who are willing and able to provide this immense energetic boost. The vampire's ghul is the customary donor, as the act of exchange actually strengthens the link between vampire master and ghul. Blood should be taken ritually, at the prescribed times and in a wholly sanitary mann er. The amount should be small, as not to endanger the victim.

You are not limiting your blood drinking because it is the humane thing to do, but because any expression of our vampiric greed and lust must be controlled in these modem times. Feel free to hate your victim, but be ever so careful in your acts. This feeding is not a violent act, it is an act home of alien needs, so do not harm those who are not willing to en­gage, and take only the smallest amount of blood. A few drops will do, as the energy is so potent that you will immediately feel its effects as if you have just indulged in the most delightful and ener­gizing sexual intercourse. Be sure to fast for at least a days time before indulging in these rites, as the energy absorption will be more easily accom­plished and you will surely feel its effects in a more potent manner. Small amounts of blood consumption should be accompanied by frequent and varying degrees of raw energy vampirism. There are many books dedicated to the visualization techniques needed to begin the process of becoming a proficient energy vampire, and I'm sure than any number of them will have some desired effect, however please keep in mind that once visualization as an aid is mastered, we are seeking a very real transfer of tangible etheric energy and this energy can be physically experienced.

It is at this point that your physical body will begin to change in dramatic ways. Every vampiric sorcerer is different, and you will be no exception. The best place to start with etheric feeding is to retire for the day into your chamber. Relax your­self to the point that you can attain very clear visual pictures in your mind. This is a tricky affair and will fluctuate with time. Some days you will be able to see crystal clear images of people and places, while other days you will have to accept choppy visions that are difficult to attain. It is these time when you will have to use the physical feeling and intention of feeding more than the visual, but do not fear. With time you will be capable of snapping your fingers and caus­ing the shadows to physically gather around yourself and you will be able to simply close your eyes and will the life force out of any person you desire. When you have the image of the victim firmly in your mind, visualize a luminescent web-like sub­stance wrapped around and penetrating within the individual.

It should be understood that a sufficient degree of mastery over one's shadow portal must be attained.

We will perform ritual medita­tions whereby we transform our shadow image in the portal into the likeness of our victims, and draw their pranic force through time and space so that we may fortify, vivify and rejuvenate the very cells of our body.

What this essentially means is that after years of honing one's skills, the vrunpire's assemblage has permanently shifted to a new position, slightly below that of the ordinary person so that they perpetually live in a shadow semblance of the day side. This slight yet permanent deviation in awareness allows one to still effectively interact with the day side, while giving immediate access to the Nagual, or Nod. In this state, new dreruning positions are easily beckoned by the vrunpiric sorcerer, and much like our Toltec predecessors, we simply need to give the slightest nod to the nagual and we will be whisked away. 1 There are three main techniques that we will examine in the art of vrunpiric immortality. The first is whereby the sorcerer willfully departs their physical form and then enters the physical form of another.

If done well, this ensures the Voltec a new life in its entirety, all the way from infanthood to advanced age. This is the most ideal situation, and unfortu­nately one of the most difficult to execute. There are several reasons for this level of difficulty. First, the level of devotion to the vampyric Master by their chosen servants needs to be ex­ceedingly high. The devotees will need to be committed to the early protection and sorcery education of the Master in infant form. Granted, this will be far better than the method used by Tibetan monks in their quest to identify a new Dali Lam.a, but the sorcerer must ensure that they can completely trust the intention of their servants in a case such as this. The newly re-manifested master must be raised in the physical surrounding that they inhabited before they made the transition. Much like the Dali Lama, they should be allowed to play with their old artifacts and be exposed to all the conditions of their former life. They should be allowed to be the children that they are, but immersed in their old magic that they may continuously remember who they are. This process of remembering should last into early childhood, but eventually the master will have completed the physical and cerebral connections to their old form. They will identify with themselves properly and very little discontinuity will exist in their memories. This particular method was the one employed more regularly with ancient vampiric sorcerers of the past. This was simply due to the fact that"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"they had entire estates set up with servants and trusted allies who could ensure the stability of life for the re-manifested master. The economic and social environment of today's world may require the vampire to be more aggressive in their machinations. This leads to our next option in life extension, which is similar to the first but with a variation. This is the true definition of the darkest trick and it consists of the sorcerer will­fully pushing another being out of their body in order for the vampire to inhabit it themselves. This is also a difficult maneuver and is best done with a subject who has an impairment of will such as a drug addiction. It would also be ideal for use on individuals who can be found to be unconscious a good deal of the time. This method is less desirous than the first, but with enough strength it can yield strong results. A variation of this technique is done with the aid of either the sorcerer's apprentice, or the aid of one's ghul. The apprentice may willingly enter into a pact with their dark master so that a symbiotic relationship of bodily possession exists. The agreement stipulates that the appren­tice will allow the Master to enter and posses their body while still physically alive so that after physical departure, they can be called from the plane of shadows in order to temporarily posses their apprentice. There are of course many variations of this arrangement, and any that are effective are encouraged.

This is often the chosen method of many sorcerers because it provides a degree of perceptual flexibility and fluidity unheard of and unattainable in physical form. At this point the Vampire becomes a living shadow and may freely roam new and undiscovered intricacies in the depths of the etemal darkness. One does wonder at the possibilities here, as it would be astonish­ing if after the successful execution of the first method of life extension, the Voltec sorcerer could then after two full lifetimes perform the final feat and willfully choose to become as the inorganics and operate wholly from their shadow realm. This seems to be the ultimate variation on the application of the dreaming technique called the twin positions and would in all likelihood give rise to a dark sorcerer who would be both indestructible and capable of assembling even the most remote and transient positions of aware­ness such as those touched upon in Energetic Sorcery on the Voltec Tree of Night.

The vampire is ultimately a materialist, understanding the energetic root of reality and with the knowledge that this materialistic approach is in no true conflict with the realm of the magical. To us, these apparently diverging paradigms are one and the same, just as to the shaman and Bokhor divinity and power is found equally within the realms of the highest and lowest on every level of creation. The undead sorcerer will use the material world around them as a surgeon uses a scalpel to perfectly execute their art; cutting away that which hinders and shaping and re-shaping reality until the very atoms of one's body resonate with sheer intent.

The ring is the symbolic representa­tion of the vampire's dominion over the flesh and the material realm. They who walk the shadows are they who are masters of the material planes of existence. The ring should always have a stone of your chosen color, and one that resonates with the twilight energies of the realm of Nod.

Then, and only then, shall the vampyric sorcerer ceremonially advance into dreaming; transforming into they who have descended and never returning in physical form to the life they coveted for so long.

The Vampire's Belt & The Hammer of Death The anthropomorphic figure of death is typically depicted as a cloaked or robed skeletal figure wielding a large, formidable scythe. This image is a conglomeration of historical depictions of death that have survived through the millennia, embodying those most pertinent features that so darkly resonate with the minds of humans. Deities of death originally came into existence as goddesses and gods of war as in the psyche of the earliest humans, death as an unnatural and viscous occurrence was associated with the mass slaughter of the battlefield. The death of clan elders through the process of ageing was viewed in a different way, with less apprehension and with a whole different set of cognitive associa­tions. We can see in our modem conception death the accumulated features that held on as the centuries passed to eventually emerge in the form of our holy reaper. The black cloak and black birds of prey are distinctly characteristic of the Celtic goddess Morrigan; reaper of men's souls and owner of the dead as they lay on the battlefield. She is a warrior goddess of war and death who is at once a fierce and beautiful female warrior and a black spirit crow perched on the bodies of dead warriors."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The primary tool of the reaper is usually depicted as the scythe, but this is actually a more recent historical adaptation. The scythe became death's tool early in American history and had some depictions in Europe in the late Middle Ages. In truth the scythe of death was most likely a large war hammer in its original form, and some cul­tures throughout the world still retain this tool as the chosen method with which death takes�., .• ·'''''' the lives of all who live. The West Mrican Orisha of death carries a Hammer and there are many other examples of this throughout the world. The ancient Toltec sorcerers who perfected the arts of energetic sorcery \"saw\" the force of death as a constant rolling wave of energy that perpetually hits all living beings until finally, wearing them down they eventually die. The rolling force or \"the tumbler\" was understood to hit the naval region of human beings; not having much effect on a healthy person, but growing in intensity as the individual ages. \"The rolling force is the means through which the Eagle distributes life and awareness for safekeep­ing,\" he said. \"But it also is the force that, let's say, collects the rent. It makes all living beings die. What you saw today was called by the ancient seers the tumbler.\" He said that seers describe it as an eternal line of iridescent rings, or balls of fire, that roll onto living beings ceaselessly. Luminous organic beings meet the rolling force head on, until the day when the force proves to be too much for them and the creatures finally collapse. The old seers were mesmerized by seeing how the tumbler then tumbles them into the beak of the Eagle to be devoured.

He added that if the force is seen in a deliberate manner, there is minimal danger. A situation that is extremely dangerous, however, is an involuntary shift of the assemblage point owing, perhaps, to physical fatigue, emotional exhaustion, disease, or simply a minor emotional or physical crisis, such as being frightened or being drunk. \" When the assemblage point shifts involuntarily, the rolling orce cracks the cocoon, \" he went on. \"I've talked many times about a gap that man has below his navel. It's not really below the navel itself, but in the cocoon, at the height of the navel. The gap is more like a dent, a natural flaw in the otherwise smooth cocoon. It is there where the tumbler hits us ceaselessly and where the cocoon cracks.\" He went on to explain that if it is a minor shift of the assemblage point, the crack is very small the cocoon quickly repairs itself, and people perience what everybody has at one time or an­other: blotches of color and contorted shapes, which remain even if the eyes are closed. If the shift is considerable, the crack also is extensive and it takes time for the cocoon to repair itself, as in the case of warriors who purposely use power plants to elicit that shift or people who take drugs and unwittingly do the same. In these cases men feel numb and cold; they have difficulty talking or even thinking; it is as if they have been frozen from inside.\""},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"\"Don Juan said that in cases in which the assemblage point shifts drastically because the effects of trauma or of a mortal disease, the rolling force produces a crack the length of the cocoon; the cocoon collapses and curls in on itself, and the individual dies. \"Can a voluntary shift also produce a gap of that nature?\" I asked. \"Sometimes,\" he replied. \"We're really frail. As the tumbler hits us over and over, death comes to us through the gap. Death is the rolling force. When it finds weakness in the gap of a luminous being it automatically cracks it open and makes it collapse.\" \"Does every living being have a gap?\" I asked. \"Of course,\" he replied. \"If it didn't have one it wouldn't die. The gaps are different, however, in size and configuration. Man's gap is a bowl-like depression the size of a fist, a very frail vulnerable configuration. The gaps of other organic creatures are very much like man's; some are stronger than ours and others are weaker. But the gap of inorganic beings is really different. It's more like a long thread, a hair of luminosity; consequently, inorganic beings are infinitely more durable than As these energetic truths have been verified by countless sorcerers, it becomes obvious to the vampyric master that protecting this weak point in the luminosity of our energy form shall be a foremost priority. This is done through the fortification and enhancement of our energy bodies, our shadow and by the very acts of sorcery in which we engage in regularly.

This is done through the use of physical sorcery movements, sheer intent and transfiguration ceremonies conducted throughout the sorcerer's life. We also recommend the construction of a specialized belt or sash which can be used to physically store subtle energy and protect one's vital area from the rolling force in an effort to extend one's health, unlife and awareness. The use of the vampire sorcerer's belt of power is multifaceted as it can become an energy generating device in its own right, but its primary purpose is to shield the sorcerer from the more degenerative daily effects of the tumbler and to project one's inten­sified gathered energy out, onto the surface of the energy body. In this way we are able to shape additional energy and force our energy shape into a slightly modified configuration; one that actually allows the rolling force to break over this more vulnerable center in a way that leaves less damage. This takes the skill of energy manipulation, enhanced by dreaming techniques and the ability to intend the additional gathering of energy on this spot and the reshaping of this energy into a ridge-like shape that will disrupt and disperse the rolling force much as a swim­mer who upon entering the ocean against the waves turns to the side so that the strong waves break and pass around them with less force, leaving them upright instead of lmocking them down. This is the best analogy that I can use when describing what we are looking to do by fortifying this chakra-like matrix of energy and by additionally supplementing this sorcery modification with the sorcerer's belt as a tool of"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The belt itself can be constructed from any material of one's desire, but I have found that in order to make it the most comfortable, a specially designed sash is best. The sash needs to be designed so that when wrapped around one's midsection it completely covers both the umbili­cal area to just above the pubic region. The sash should have a pocket or pouch sewn into it that covers this area and enough slack so that it can continue to be wrapped around the body and tied at the front or the back like a belt or cummer­bund. The color is not important and may be aligned with one's vampyric octarine color, or any hue of one's choice that would be complimentary. The sash can be wom at any time and the more frequently it is wom, the better, however it should always be wom when working any sorcery that involves shifts of the assemblage point. It should always be wom in potentially stressful situations or at any time where the sorcerer's perception is going to be altered in any way. This helps to protect the gap and facilitate faster repair if a shock is experienced and energetic damage is incurred. The sash is specifically designed with a pouch in order that additional protective materials can be added and placed flat against the body for addi­tional power and to strengthen this area. The ancient sorcerers used living green leaves for this very purpose and would benefit from the natural capacity the leaves have for absorbing negative of energy.

The Black Mirror The doorway into the Nightside or realm of Nod is found in those in between places forgotten and unnoticed by the ordinary human being. Nod is accessed most frequently and easily through the arts of dreaming, of which all non-ordinary perceptual states are a form. The sorcerer is expert at inducing subtle shifts in perception and can literally walk into Nod at will any time they wish. All forgotten forms and those that never were are a part of this realm, as it is a place and a state of being. It is vast and impossible to map in its entirety. Nod is entered in dark Kabbalistic terms through the pylon of the Voltigeurs on the Tree of Night. Many Left Hand Path Adepts become highly confused when attempting to leam as much as possible conceming this aspect of the Tree of Life and there are many reasons for this. The first reason is that as soon as we"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"initiatically enter the dark side of the tree, we abandon the soundness of mind and calculated reasonableness that are characteristic of the day side. Kenneth Grant is one of the very few initiated who have elaborated on the night side of the tree with any degree of coherence. Malkuth of the night side is enmeshed within the material world of daily affairs, and it is this power zone that the black mirror, or portal is ascribed to. For those not familiar with the sorcery of the V oltec, this mirror is the exact equivalent of the Voltec Portal. I here refer the reader to Liber Obsidian Obscura once again and to Infemal Gateways specifically. The black mirror is used in a more highly specified way by the black adept who has found themselves on the path of vampyric magic. Yes, it is still employed to easily access the shadow realm itself, but we who are concemed with the accumulation of power also use the portal in a specialized manner to gather and store untold amounts of vital energy to be used when necessary. For the vampyric sorcerer, the portal additionally be­comes a type of sorcery battery, constantly gener­ating the dark and heavy energy of the inorganic realm. Conceive of the Nightside of the tree as such; The shadow of Malkuth is to be found in the twilight energies of the sephiroth Malkuth proper, once enough dark energy has been gathered by the sorcerer, a redeployment of that energy can take place and the portal will open up, leading the black adept to the Nightside power zone of Y esod.

The pylon of the Voltigeur is the Nightside twin of Y esod, and herein lays a further mystery because it is through Y esod that the Right Hand Path magician can willfully or accidentally enter the realm of Nod. This can happen through an over identification with the lunar energies of that sphere, and in particular the Bhakti devotional methods of the Goddess Hecate taken to the extreme. When the magician causes an imbalance in the way that they have approached this lunar sphere, the queen of illusions can be called into action and literally pull the Right Hand Path magician into her grasp. The Nightside of Y esod is Hecate's throne and any who say differently are revealing a dark Kabbalah of their own mind and construction. The true Kether of the Night­side tree is Daath, which extends downward in a manner that completely transcends rationality. The crown of this tree is the non-sephiroth of knowledge itself. \"In such cases the man's policy is of course to break off all relations with the Supernal Triad, and to replace it by inventing a false crown, Daath. To them Knowledge will be everything, and what is Knowledge but the very soul of Illusion?\" (Crowley, 1954). Here the old man Crowley is closer to the truth of the matter than he ever knew . The intricacies of the black mirror or portal are explained in other places, but vampyric sorceries utilizing it will of course follow. Remember as a vampyric sorcerer; the portal is the gateway to your realm and as such you must keep it sacred in your own place and it must be seen by the eyes"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"of no other unless ceremony and ritual demand. The construction of the portal is much like its Voltec predecessor, except as in all things vampyric a small drop of your own fluid should be added to the black paint mixture before apply­ing it to the back of the glass used to create the black mirror. It is preferable to complete the construction of the mirror on a night when the moon is full and the earth therefore full of shadows. Take the new portal and bathe it gently in the full moonlight in clean water infused with a small amount of the essence of jasmine flower. Take the mirror and secure it in your ritual sleep chamber, being sure to hang dark curtains over its face, keeping the surface pure and undisturbed by the light or sight of others. As many have suggested in relation to the Voltec portal, the size should be large enough to allow the shadow reflection of your entire body, at least while sitting in front of it from a distance. In the case of vampyric power tools usually bigger is better. When you depart in shadow, this gate will be your dark doorway into your victim's abode. Here you shall meditate on them and see them in their natural state. Through this portal you will even be capable of siphoning off the energy of others while they sleep and you will also be able to use the gateway as a place to store knowledge and energy. As you progress with its use, you will begin to understand better the nature of time itself as time begins to flow onto your being instead of receding away from it as it does all mortal creatures.

The Scepter The Master Vampire's scepter is their worldly material symbol of their power on this plane of existence. It is a statement in itself and not all vampyric sorcerers will feel that they have earned the right to incorporate this power tool into their personal arsenal of magical parapher­nalia. This power object is bestowed upon the fifth degree within the Order of the Voltec as a representation of their newly acquired powers and their new authority within the order as a whole. The vampire's scepter can be somewhat compared to the wand of the classical magician although it bears no relation to it in its phallic imagery or powers. The energies of the Left Hand"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Path are recognized as primarily feminine with masculinity manifesting as an offshoot or almost a mutation of the primal force itself. The scepter resembles the wand only in that it functions as a focal point and extender of the sorcerers will, but only in reference to the shadow energies it is formed from. The scepter is acquired once a vampyric sorcerer feels they have acquired a good degree of control and dominion over their night and day sides. If one attempts to carry such a magical weapon and badge of honor before one is ready, it will become readily apparent that the object in the vampire's hand is nothing more than a prop used for appearances only. It really becomes a matter of honor and gives automatic prestige. As a magical weapon, the scepter is used primarily to project forth the sorcerers will in the form of their gathered energy and essence. It can be used as a weapon or as a tool of creation or modification. As with all your sorcery objects, you shall either find its perfect design through dreaming, or obtain the scepter first and then forcefully intend to dream of it. If this is the method that you happen to engage in, then after having dreamt of the object, you should upon waking, take the scepter and place it directly upon your abdominal region, simultaneously absorbing and transferring your vital energy into it. As far as the specific design is concemed, the scepter can be as large as a walking stick, but no smaller than 26 inches long.

I myself never felt much of a connection with that force collectively lrnown in Mrican sorcery as \"the dead,\" but as the years passed by and I slowly changed on this dark path of transformation, I found myself growing closer to the shades of the underworld. Traditionally, the scepter should house at least some pieces of the bones of the dead, and it may even be made from a long human bone, such as the femur. H you are fortunate enough to be able to find one this would be ideal. Within the scepter you shall house a powder made from finely ground worm­wood, jasmine flower, human bone, red rose petals and a bit of earth from a cemetery. This powder may be kept within the scepter inside a glass vial for easy access, for a small amount placed just inside the entrance of a cemetery or house of the dead with the smallest drop of your own blood added will entice the spirits within and give them immediate allegiance to you as master of that place. That is unless another sorcerer of any type has already made significant pacts with the spirits there and gained their loy­alty, but truly this is a rare occurrence and it takes many offerings and sacrifices before the dead willingly and intentionally form such a bond. The scepter may also be considered as the sorcerer's primary weapon, and can be fashioned with this in mind. I speak not only of a physical weapon used to stave off actual attacks should the need arise, but primarily a etheric, energetic"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"weapon charged with the darkest intent of the sorcerer and filled with the concentrated ener­gies of the dead. Having a weapon such as this in the more dangerous practices of dreaming is a definite advantage when confronted with unknown, hostile forms of awareness. As the scepter of authority over the representative of the \"umbo\" in Mrican sorcery, one should bring it to the entrance of the cemetery upon its creation in order to receive the blessings of the ladies and lords of that realm. To do this properly, bring with you offerings of fruits, cigars and rum. If you have the privacy of a more rural cemetery, you should place the scepter on the ground and encircle it with the offerings in a way that is geometrically pleasing to the eye as intentionally made geometric pattems always catch the attention of the spirits. Light at least one candle and sit some distance away so that the Loa, Orisha and the dead may sense, receive and appreciate the offering. The spirits of the cemetery shall gently touch your power object and bestow upon it the essence of their authority. As with all of your tools, always keep the scepter out of the sunlight and away from the hands and eyes of others. I suggest having a long black bag like covering sewn specifically for it, so that you may travel with your scepter without any danger of it being exposed to sunlight or other damage. When it is not being carried by you or is not in use, keep it in your tomb as this is the perfect place for it to hold onto your accumulated dreaming energy.
