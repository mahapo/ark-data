Fortunately the cedar for the house fell into n1y hands prac-ltt'niJy for notl1ing.

The dan1ned F\\·enchrnan who O\\vns the hot1se u\"~t. d<>or does not like the harnm.ering.

Before going I asked Marta if she would nH~et with nH· t ~ ,,1. •.. at noon in tl1e restaurant across the street frorn F'ritz's ; 'I'·•' t ment. She agreed without asking any questions. I could s< 'I· 1, • was wondering what it was all about. Her silence pleas<·d '\"• I like Marta. She is y(n.Ing and bE~autifu] i11 the f~lce but. ; 1 I .,1 heavy in the hips and thighs. She always sn1j ]es except \\\\I I• · t• she is concentrating, and then she bites he:r bottorn lip t.lt 11 •• corner. She listens to what I say without interrllpting, whicl1 , unusual in the group. Fritz's girlfriend, a stupid aggressive l: Ill· slut, brought her in abo·ut a year ago. The girlfriend len I,, 11 Maria stayed on. We ordered a l uneh and I tal ked for a while to put he, . 11 ea~c .. For some reason she \\Vas nervous. rrhen I to1d her as d t ·I icately as 1 could that I needed a S'll1a1J atnount of·' her blood .. \\1 first she did not understand what I \\Vanted. She thougl11 l n1eant to extract it frorn her vein like a vampire. When ... 111 finally understood she ·began to giggle, vvhether ·it was f r1•r1t e.rnbarrass1nent or a musen1ent l arn not certain. But . .-.h. · agreed. 1'hat is the only thing that n1atters. Let her t ell I ;• 1 friends whatever she likes, so long as she does not gues~; t 1,. · truth. She says she ean bring n1e the blood in three or !'t\"'\" days. That shou]d be soon enough to prepare the pentael~· 111 tinH~ for the equinox. March 15 (Thursday) Preparatjons progress well. It is aln1ost as though son1,. spiritual f(n·ce is aiding n1e in my search f(n· the n1ateri ah-:. I had no idea where I wuuld get the silver f()r the seal of 1.;] l d ~, but the first je\\veller I consulted had a supply and sold nH· :, t•h,n· of plate two n1illi1netres in thickness. Probably .he llhuq~···d rn.e five tirnes vvhat it is worth .. I paid him without saytng 1\\Uvt.hing. It is a rule in n1agic to buy the n1aterials without hn~~gling over the price. Fortunately the cedar for the house fell into n1y hands prac-ltt'niJy for notl1ing. I bought a broken chest without a lid that hucl been used for storing c1othes and removed the cedar boards fl·uul the inside. The dan1ned F\\·enchrnan who O\\vns the hot1se u\"~t. d<>or does not like the harnm.ering. I would bang-bang-hun~.~ on the chest and the11 he would bang-bang-bang on the wull. l-Ie is always finding son1et.hing to con1plain about. \\Vhen til•· old woman lived there sh.e 11ever corrrplained. This neigh-hnurhood is going to hell, all f()reigners n1oving in and acting hl\\t' they own the place. So1ne night soon 1 will pay hin1 back f()r his racket, 1 protnise. I will send to him J.jlith and she will be wearin.g one of her less t•tPnsant masks. Then I will listen to him scream, and after a ht t.l<' while 1 will bang-bang-bang on the waH. 'rhis whole country h1 ~~oi ng to hell. 'rhe cedar house of the irnage n1ust be built without a single u~tiL 1'h.e sharp steel po]nts of nails n1ight t hreaten the goddess und drive her away. It Inust be put together with wooden pegs nnd glu e .. Lucky for n1e I kn(J\\V ho\\v to do this. My father \\Vas a C'uhinet maker. 1 used to \\vateh hin1 building fine furniture for WPa I thy bliyers. I have decided to use rose inct~nse sticks frorn lndi a f(lr the nt.uals. 'I'hey are c.heap., of good quality and easy to get. If I drill u couple of holes in the inner sides of the house the slicks can )u' set in them and \\viii not need any holder. To be attracting Uu· goddess in a forn1 that is gentle and loving thP incense ,d,ould be of a kind that is light and sweet-s1nelling. I a .m tc·n1pted to use artificial Howers of silk to adorn the house bttt hnve decided to go to the additional trouble~ of replacing living tlowers every few days. In magic it is not good to be cutting too rn:tny corners. 149 ----.. ,..

Since she is unable to read :Latin 1 translate f~n~ her in u general \\vay the first chapter. May 30 (Wednesday) Tonight Marta and I performed the ritual of invocation and olrerjng bef()re the cedar house together. We shared the sub-Ht.ances of the offerings 'vith the goddess in c.on1n1on between us. For the first tin1e as she is looking down into the silver bo\\vl l am taking her earlobes between my fingers. This caused her t.o lean back against 1ny body so I reached around h er \\Vith rny hands and gently began to caress h e r as it says to do in the 1nanuscript.. Still we are not joined sexually. I believe rny tOllCh IH distracting her from the work of divination. ()bvjously it will n•quire great concentration on her part to continue to seek visions in the bowl while she is at the san1.e nloin.ent fe eling urousal.

May 30 (Wednesday) Tonight Marta and I performed the ritual of invocation and olrerjng bef()re the cedar house together. We shared the sub-Ht.ances of the offerings 'vith the goddess in c.on1n1on between us. For the first tin1e as she is looking down into the silver bo\\vl l am taking her earlobes between my fingers. This caused her t.o lean back against 1ny body so I reached around h er \\Vith rny hands and gently began to caress h e r as it says to do in the 1nanuscript.. Still we are not joined sexually. I believe rny tOllCh IH distracting her from the work of divination.

The ord<'r or U H ·i r coming forth is opposite to that given in (j h apter III. ll<·n· t.IH· twelve authorities first come into being. They assist in tlH· 'cort centration' of the seven kings~ th€~ familiar archons of the pl;u H ·t.s common to 1nost Gnostic literature.

In astrology tl1c planets 'rule' the signs. Each of the seven kings has its own sphere of heavt.~n, its own anirr1al likeness, and its O\\Vn day of thE~ \\Veek. Seven archangels~ presumably each dwelling in one of the planetary spheres, are set over thf~ three hundre d and sixty-five lesser angels of the days of the yea r.
