Some sort of spark was clearly ignited. Most – thoughnot all – of those factual books can now be dismissed as fantasy. To be fair,many stories which have taken hold from that time came from people who weretrying to remember events that had taken place decades beforehand, invariablywithout official records or contemporary notes to hand. There were others whowere, alas, deliberately telling ridiculous lies or exaggerating the importanceof their work. Yet deception, myth and all sorts of rumours were almostinevitable thanks to another peculiarly British obsession – that of secrecy forits own sake.As a result, much of the historical record has been distorted. Only now, at thestart of another century with the unprecedented release of many hitherto secretfiles, can the story of some of the stranger operations be told. Many filesremain classified even today, so parts of it remain incomplete. That said, manyofficial records, though, are often as riveting as watching paint dry. When thefirst volumes of official histories of British Intelligence came out in the lateseventies – without names of relevant participants – they were famouslydescribed as ‘written by a committee about a committee to be read by acommittee’.Thankfully, the many thousands of pages which have been released by the Britishgovernment of virtually all the secret agencies’ wartime records contain muchmore interesting material. The phrase ‘British Intelligence’ is one of almostinfinite elasticity, but here, specifically, refers to MI5, PWE, SOE, MI (R),Electra House, Section D and MI14. The notable exception are the records of theSecret Intelligence Service, MI6, which the government – for entirelyunderstandable reasons – has not released. What is interesting is that much MI6CX material may be found in many other files if you look closely enough. Nameshave been redacted; sometimes there are tantalising references to furtherinformation. Handwritten notes to and from its wartime chief, Sir StewartMenzies, may also be found which seem to have not been weeded.Writing this book, then, has been akin to assembling a jigsaw with pieces thatremain hidden. So far as possible, I have tried to back up any assertions withreference to official or at least contemporaneous files. Often this has not beenpossible. Academic papers are useful in providing both context and as anantidote to the more exaggerated reminiscences of participants. The truth, Isuspect, lies somewhere in between.As is probably apparent from the text, I am not a believer in the occult and sohave not – as many have done – told aspects of this story through the prism ofthose beliefs. As such, I have not made use of the more partisan accounts which,as the text makes clear, often peddle unsubstantiated stories and versions ofstories. In some cases – particularly concerning Aleister Crowley – that simplyisn’t possible. The same goes for much of the material on the occult itself.The point here – to paraphrase Admiral Godfrey – is that it doesn’t matter whatI think, or what an academic researcher thinks or a reviewer might think orindeed a believer steeped in the arcane practices of the occult thinks. Whatmatters is what the participants believed at the time. On one point I should beclear: many who did believe in the occult did so for entirely laudable reasons.Not everyone who reads (or casts) a horoscope is a gullible fool. Those whobelieve in other such superstitions do not walk around the house wearing tinfoilon their head. Many are genuine in their beliefs and cannot be dismissed out ofhand.It is a simply a matter of record that in the summer of 1940, the occultprovided a useful tool and, in an odd way, worked. That is, fairly quickly, itshowed its limitations almost straightaway. Ultimately, trying to discern theadvice being given to Adolf Hitler was self-defeating. But in that strange dawnof interest in the subject against the backdrop of the greatest danger theUnited Kingdom ever faced, emerges a remarkable story to which I hope I havedone justice in these pages.Nicholas BoothJune, 2016"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS [contents.htm#a2]I would like to record my appreciation to many people who have – in recentmonths, and, indeed, over the years – provided much needed advice, insights andsplendid help on a variety of curious, yet endlessly fascinating, subjects. Myown ‘occult’ education has been aided by conversations with Professor DeborahHarkness, Dr Stephen Clucas and the late Dr Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, foundingdirector of the Centre for the Study of Esotericism at Exeter University. It isthe writer’s privilege to be able to consult the experts in the field. I am verygrateful to Dr Roger Moorhouse for his advice and knowledge about Georg Elserand the incidents surrounding the explosion at the Bürgerbraükeller, and SirSidney Aster with regard to the Tilea Affair. A number of experts on theintelligence world have freely given of their time and help over the years:David Stafford, Nigel West, Gill Bennett, Eunan O’Halpin and Dr Jo Fox. Anyerrors of interpretation or fact, I should point out, are my own.Phil Baker, the author of an exemplary biography of Dennis Wheatley, wasfantastically helpful, not least in picking up some elementary errors. So, too,was Charles Beck, keeper of the remarkable Wheatley archive and the websitedenniswheatley.info [http://denniswheatley.info], who also helped in innumerableways. A couple of other collectors – who wish to remain anonymous – also helpedprovide some illustrations and background information. Dominic Wheatley,grandson of the great writer, was also very helpful and allowed me to quoteextensively from much of Dennis’s later writings.Paul Busby, biographer of the Second Viscount Tredegar, was incredibly generouswith his reading of the manuscript and advice concerning the convoluted life ofEvan Morgan: Andrew Macklin, who runs the splendid Agnesbernelle.net[http://Agnesbernelle.net] site, was very helpful about the remarkableactivities of ‘Vicky’ during the wartime years; at the Romanian Cultural Centrein London, I would also like to thank Carmen Campaneau for her help with regardto V.V. Tilea and the Ratiu family archive; Peter Fleming’s daughters, Kate andLucy, were very helpful.The staff at Manchester University Library and the Manchester Central Librarywere very helpful in guiding me to find sometimes obscure references. So, too,were Oksana Newman and her cheerful colleagues at Cheshire East Libraries – fortheir help, professionalism and forebearance, I am once again in their debt. Ata time when libraries are seriously underfunded and facing extinction, it is areminder of the great service that they provide.I would also like to thank librarians and archivists at a number ofinstitutions; Hannah Brown at the Wellcome Trust; Dr Philip Young at the WarburgInstitute; Erica New at the National Museum of Royal Navy, Portsmouth; and LiWei Yang at the Huntington in Pasadena.I also owe a particular debt of gratitude to Dr Peter Burt, Commodore andHonorary Historian at the Royal Motor Yacht Club in Sandbanks for helping findthe portrait of Mansfield Cumming. It was painted in 1918 by H.F. Crowther Smithand believed to have been initialled by C himself; Tim Worner, the currentowner, graciously allowed for it to be reproduced on these pages. GillianBarnes-Riding at the Surrey Heath County Museum, was also very helpful inarranging for me to use the image of Max Knight which formed part of anexhibition on his life and (local) times.I would like to thank the staff of The National Archive – particularly, HowardDavies in his earlier role – as well as Jane Rosen, James Taylor and GeoffreySpender at the Imperial War Museum.Friends, family and others read the manuscript. I am grateful for all theirhelp, not least from the shared knowledge and advice of Jeremy Duns and GuyWalters, who know a thing or two about the subject. Thanks also to Dr DavidWhitehouse, for his friendship, encouragement and good advice. Thanks also tothe denizens of Pussycat Alley – V and 3A (codenames as their real identitiesremain highly classified). Sadly, I should record the unfortunate circumstanceof the passing of two friends, Ric Wickham and John Davies, whose companionshipI appreciated at different times of my life. It was Ric who became a fellowobserver of the heavens in my youth; and John, whose wise counsel is now sorelymissed. I think they would have liked this book.I also wish to thank my own agent (literary, not secret), Humfrey Hunter,dedicated handler (who commissioned the book) Mark Beynon, as well as the notexactly clandestine services of not really forged documentation but splendidlydesigned ones at The History Press: Naomi Reynolds, Caitlin Kirkman and KatieBeard.All throughout this time, I have been helped (some of the time) by a black catand (at all times and in all places) a truly bewitching, shining figure. Asever, without Sarah, my wife, the writing of this book would simply not havebeen possible. Her help, love and care in so many ways gave me the strength ofpurpose to head towards my desk. I should also thank her for not putting a hexon me as our workroom teetered with both esoterica and an equally esotericfailing – the loud playing of John Barry 007 soundtracks (‘in the name ofresearch’, obviously). Thanks also to Tilly, who reminded me to have lunch (hisown, mainly) by sticking his claws into my leg on innumerable occasions. ToSarah, thank you, love – it wouldn’t have been possible without you. And now,the back room can be reclaimed from the ghosts (spectres, natch) and the cat canbe fed.Nicholas BoothJune, 2016"},{"pageContent":"CONTENTS 1. Title [title.htm] 2.

I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient servantALEISTER CROWLEYThe only way to describe it is a lair and, in its dimly lit and chintzyostentation, an evil one at that. When the tall naval officer entered, he triedto keep both an open mind and a straight face. The circumstances might well haveportended great dangers for, at face value, this meeting with the self-appointednecromancer who liked to call himself the wickedest man in the world, was one ofthe most extraordinary that the man from Naval Intelligence would everexperience. And given some of the people Commander Ian Fleming RNVR encounteredduring his wartime secret service, that is saying something.With his usual urbane aplomb, the future creator of James Bond took it all inhis stride. As the personal assistant to the sometimes acerbic head of NavalIntelligence, Fleming was used to considering strange and bizarre operations.Wartime expediency dictated that no matter how seemingly ridiculous, nothing wasbeyond their remit. In so many ways, Ian Fleming’s meeting with Aleister Crowleylent itself to his later writings with villains defined by their physicalrepugnance. As several commentators have pointed out, Crowley himself would havemade an ideal Bond villain. It was his eyes, and their unwavering hypnoticstare, that captivated the future thriller writer. Their mesmeric aspectinformed the hypnotic stare – to wit, ‘the whites of his eyes, which showed allaround the irises, lending something impassive and doll-like to his gaze’ – ofhis first ever prototypical villain, Le Chiffre.In the spring of 1941, though, the discussion itself (at face value concerning agenerous offer of help) was politely received. In the previous war, AleisterCrowley had, he claimed, been employed by British Intelligence as some sort ofpropagandist. Now, according to some accounts, this latest meeting was merely astepping stone to even greater employment. The Beast, as Crowley liked to referto himself, was extremely impressed by Fleming’s ‘unalloyed joy in sex, food andthrills’.‘You could well have been an occultist,’ Crowley is supposed to have said.‘I consider that I am,’ Fleming replied, no doubt stroking a black (or possibly,a white) cat for good measure.What exactly they discussed and why has been the source of endless – oftenfarcical – speculation over the years. It has fuelled endless conspiracytheories that have become ever more elaborate and byzantine with the passing oftime. Some are rooted in tongue-in-cheek mischief-making, others as proof of thesupremacy of supernatural forces.The reality, as this book will show, is much more mundane.The greater truth is that while many have maintained their wartime meetingsmacks of James Bond, in truth, his rendezvous with Aleister Crowley reads morelike Austin Powers. According to the dialogue above, courtesy of Amado Crowleywho was supposedly the Beast’s son (in reality, one of a strange number offantasists who gathered in his wake) the overarching sense of theatricality hadmore to do with pantomime.That it took place on the English Riviera is another surreal aspect to thestory.Torquay is hardly a den of devilish iniquity, yet that was where the wickedestman in the world had washed up. By now in his late 60s, Crowley was a pitifulshadow of his former self, thanks to a heroin addiction fuelled by thedebilitating effects of his asthma, made worse by having been bombed out duringthe Blitz. Far from achieving the acclaim and respect he felt he deserved,Crowley was on his uppers. Throughout his life he had embellished details of hisgreatness as a chess player, mountaineer, writer, artist and occult magus butwas, probably more accurately in the phrase of a grandson of one of his lovers,‘the rottenest son of a bitch I ever met’.If Aleister Crowley was never quite a lovable eccentric, he had made a certainstrain of English strangeness all his own. As the man who claimed to be his sonAmado has pointed out, ‘his very eccentricity … was his cover as an agent.’Certainly that seems to have been the case in the First World War and now, inthe Second, that a representative of an organisation as staid as NavalIntelligence had even agreed to meet the self-styled Beast may seem verypeculiar indeed. Yet Fleming’s meeting with Crowley was one of a gatheringseries of surreal events which would culminate that same late spring of 1941with perhaps the most bizarre occurrence of all – the arrival of Rudolf Hess inthe British Isles a few days earlier.images [images/icon.jpg]These surreal events did not occur in isolation and had, at least, some basis inreality. As strange as it may seem to posterity, that same spring of 1941 sawthe zenith of some of the most bizarre aspects of secret warfare – astrology,magic, political warfare and black propaganda – which would emanate from a zoolocated on the outskirts of London. Far from being a concerted effort to harnessthe occult, this particular strand of an already surreal story had begun withthe rather more mundane desire to understand if Adolf Hitler was being advisedby astrologers and ended, with whatever divination of astral significance, withRudolf Hess’s parachute descent over Scotland.Over the years, these events have prompted many strange rumours andcontradictory conspiracies. Ian Fleming’s supposed omniscience extends to notonly being in league with the Beast, but that he had somehow already placed anastrologer in Hess’s immediate circle. This mysterious figure then supposedlybriefed an associate of the Deputy Führer, who then advised Hess to fly toBritain as it was written in the stars (or, at least, an unusual conjunction ofplanets in Taurus). In other words, a very different form of bull was takingplace against the backdrop of what one bemused chronicler – a seniorintelligence official – later termed a ‘period of horoscopes, crystal-gazing andguesswork’.So what really happened when 666 met the literary father of 007?That and similar questions which have gathered like urban myths is the purposeof this book. It will examine, reassess and reveal the reality of what actuallyhappened with some of the more peculiar stories of the secret war, how writersembellished many of them and, underlying it, that the only reason the occult waseven considered was because of desperation as Britain stood alone against theThird Reich in 1940–1. The ultimate irony is that for all this use of seers –and occultists and prognosticators of various hues – none could predict what theend result might be.That was not for lack of trying, and some of the characters involved were, asthe contemporary records make clear, very, very trying. Their number includes arepressed homosexual Hungarian émigré astrologer with a penchant for dressing upin women’s clothes as well as a military uniform that he wasn’t entitled towear; a mysterious agent runner who sometimes paraded around Central London withwhat appeared to be a dancing bear, whose first wife was rumoured to have diedin an occultic ceremony that went hideously wrong; a lord of the realm who wasan ornithologist of some note, dabbled in the occult, recruited to carry outsecret operations with pigeons and whose mother seems to have thought she was abird.As in an early Bond novel where 007 is reminiscing about the good old days – andmoral certainties of a war against evil – he wonders, as no doubt readers ofthis book will at times, if they should be better dismissed as ‘all just thestuff of boys’ adventure books, but it was all true’?The answer, incredibly in many cases in this story, is yes.images [images/icon.jpg]The occult is defined as secret, hidden knowledge. For those who believe in itspower, such concealed wisdom, especially that handed down from the ancients,provides a key to unlocking all the great mysteries of life. Yet so too, in adifferent sense, do intelligence operatives and spies, who are also trying tounravel secrets and hidden information to provide strategic advantage.Significantly, for this narrative, the occult and espionage are linked, as bothconcern hidden worlds, replete with concerns about security, consciousness and asense of righteousness (particularly for those who are cut off from the refugeof their homelands).When both have been combined together, even greater riddles and stranger rumourshave resulted – especially with regard to the Second World War. In the storywhich follows, an even greater blurring has occurred of almost mythic grandeur:art imitates life; fiction becomes taken as fact, the more lurid the moreegregiously so; much evidence has been exaggerated or mangled to become potentfiction; and many urban myths have emerged from the twilight reality of whoevercould make the most ridiculous story sound even remotely plausible.The Second World War was probably the last great battle between obvious good andevil. At some level that stark delineation contrasts truth and lies, informingboth magic and propaganda that were truly also black and white. Ultimately, itis a story of how good won out as British Intelligence prevailed againstbreathtaking incompetence on the part of its German equivalents. It is anall-too-human story of foolishness, bravery and folly involving bedtimeindiscretions, broken promises, curious delusions and bizarre coincidences atthe most unlikely times of the fighting.As the late intelligence historian M.R.D. Foot has correctly diagnosed, many ofthe operations in the Second World War were ‘true to the tradition of Englisheccentricity; the sort of thing that Captain Hornblower or Mycroft Holmes infiction [would] have gone in for had they been faced with a similar challenge’.To their roll call should be added newer, equally ingenious gentlemenadventurers like Kimball O’Hara, Sandy Arbuthnott and William Hannay, created byauthors who had all served, in some capacity, on their majesty’s respectivesecret service. All blurred the boundaries between fact and fiction, none moresignificantly than a character which a vaguely amnesiac Russian general recallsin perhaps the finest novel written by Ian Fleming, a man named Bond.images [images/icon.jpg]In the story that follows, much remains hidden in plain sight.As with 007 himself – a supposed secret agent who seemed to be on first-nameterms with most of the concierges and barmen in the fanciest hotels around theworld – there was a strange paradox. For organisations that were supposedlyconcealed, much of the British secret services were remarkably visible. There ishardly an organisation in the world which has been publicly examined as much asBritish Intelligence. It is, and always has been, one of the most unsecretservices in the world. And, in the face of an official policy never to commenton many claims made against it, much of what has been written has reached thelevel of an urban myth. Even in an era of greater government openness with therelease of many thousands of hitherto secret files, many of the more peculiaroperations during the Second World War have often relied on the invariablybizarre recollections of some equally perplexing characters.As the incomparable M.R.D. Foot has also written, ‘It was only to be expectedthat hoaxers and fraudsters would take advantage of the public’s apparentlyinsatiable appetite for war stories describing episodes of extraordinary courageand adventure.’Given that many people in this story were writers, it is hardly surprising thatthe more ridiculous claims have become embedded within the public imagination,dusted off and reprinted over the Internet and other dubious places. Many of thestories veer from the utterly improbable to the extremely inconceivable. Takingmany of these stories at face value is set with pitfalls. In all the acres ofnewsprint and breathless blogs which have followed, particularly when James Bondelevated him to immortality, too much can be read into aspects of Ian Fleming’ssecret service. Yet as the producer Cubby Broccoli – who was instrumental inputting his creation on the silver screen – noted of one particular scriptmeeting with Roald Dahl, one of Fleming’s wartime colleagues, his ownrecollections were very different to what the writer claimed, ‘but then I wasn’tthe best fairy tale writer in the world’.In other words, the odd leg-pull was to be expected.None are so exasperating as those involving spying and the supernatural. ‘Manyof its protagonists are grail-seekers steeped in the occult,’ notes oneeminently sensible review, ‘who want us to share their belief in magic.’ And yetoddly, the truth, as we will see, is far stranger still, a story that actuallybegan at the end of the sixteenth century when the country faced invasion fromoverseas and also had to consider any means possible in fighting the enemy – andthat, supposedly, included the occult."},{"pageContent":"1007 AND COUNTING [contents.htm#a4]The creation of real life intelligence operative and old Etonian Ian Fleming,Bond borrowed his 007 title from Dr John Dee. The 16th Century British secretagent used the code for his messages to Queen Elizabeth I. The two zeros meant‘for your eyes only’.BBC News, 22 November 2002Intelligence work necessarily involves such cheating, lying and betraying, whichis why it has so deleterious effect on the character. I never met anyoneprofessionally engaged in it whom I should care to trust in any capacity.Malcolm Muggeridge, 1972The first time espionage, deception and the occult came together at the behestof the British government was in the sixteenth century when, by a supposedhistorical coincidence, the symbol 007 was involved. Or at least that was theclaim of someone who has done much to muddy both this and the more recenthistorical record concerning the supposed omniscience of British Intelligence.After all, it makes for great symbolism that a real-life character – on whomShakespeare supposedly based Prospero – was a magician who used that same codenumber, a supposed kabbalistic cipher, in his most secret communications.It is a matter of record that Dr John Dee was an adviser to the ElizabethanCourt on mathematics, geography, astronomy, navigation and philosophy (and theoriginator of the phrase British Empire). His experiments in alchemy, casting ofhoroscopes and supposed conversations with angels have eclipsed the certaintywith which he was most likely an intelligencer (in effect, a spy for the court)as he travelled around Europe. But in all the acres of academic assessment of DrDee’s accomplishments, there is no evidence that he ever used the symbol 007.The writer who made that claim in the sixties, Richard Deacon – whose real namewas Donald McCormick – had been employed after the war by Ian Fleming and knewhim very well. Like so many others in this story, McCormick enjoyed nothing morethan a good, old-fashioned wind up in his writings, bringing to them a certainélan: not many authors in their eightieth year ever manage to publish aconnoisseur’s guide to erotic literature. For many previous decades, McCormickhad spun often similarly outrageous yarns amongst more genuine, easilyverifiable information.When writing a book about the British Secret Service in 1969, McCormick (writingas Deacon) claimed that Dr Dee used the symbol 007. It found a willing,appreciative audience. Spy mania, spearheaded by Ian Fleming’s creation, wasthen at its height. James Bond had become the epitome of cool when, as one wittychronicler has noted, ‘it came to pass that Thomas Connery (later Sean) did – aswomen will tell you – make the word flesh’.But putting flesh on fraudulent bones would become a greater, ever growingdiversion for McCormick and others, too, in the truly cottage industry whichplaces Ian Fleming at the heart of bizarre wartime operations. As the author ofa recent, highly amusing appreciation of Fleming’s impact – that James Bond wasindeed nothing less than the man who saved post-war Great Britain – has written,the author’s real wartime record ‘relied on individual pluck and initiative andwhich, while reasonable as part of a genuine policy of total war, were in theend, irrelevant to the war’s outcome’.images [images/icon.jpg]What is indisputable is that during the reign of Elizabeth I, England was underalmost constant threat of invasion thanks to a chasm in the religious divisionsbetween Catholics and Protestants. Worse, a Cold War had developed over Spain’sdesire for a trade monopoly (which led to an actual outbreak of hostilities in1585). Against this background, the fomenting and foiling of plots against HerMajesty’s government was a constant preoccupation for which her principalsecretary – and unofficial spymaster – had to be constantly alert.In those doom-laden times, Sir Francis Walsingham made it his business to lookat all sources of intelligence (especially ‘foreign places from whence MrSecretary Walsingham was wont to receive his advertisements’, to quote acontemporary chronicle), no matter how unlikely their source nor exotic theirprovenance.Hence his use of the good Dr Dee, who was a curious polymath on the cusp of therenaissance.1 John Dee was undoubtedly the most colourful agent in the land.Most of Walsingham’s informants in foreign courts and within the orbit of bothdomestic plotting and papist cabals were much less vividly drawn. Nevertheless,Sir Francis would stop at nothing in the name of security. He pioneered covertoperations, plausible deniability and encouraged the cracking of codes to revealthe intentions of perfidious foreigners (such as those surrounding Mary Queen ofScots, which would come to include both the Ridolfi and Babington plots).A wary, melancholic man who was eventually worn down by the very weight of thesecrets he was carrying, Walsingham was, in a sense, the first modern spymaster.‘A most subtle searcher of hidden secrets’ in the estimation of a contemporary,William Camden, Walsingham could be described as the spiritual forefather forthe secret service. In the centuries which followed, espionage became a growingpreoccupation for Walsingham’s heirs, both spiritual and literal.With each subsequent threat of invasion, notably following the French Revolutionand the rise of Napoleon, England’s ambassadors were happy to pay agents andstool pigeons for their news. The king’s navy and army had its own spies, too,but it wasn’t until the opening years of the twentieth century – with the riseof the kaiser’s Germany – that espionage gained the imprimatur of officiallegitimacy with the formation of the modern secret service.Then, as now, Britannia had to waive the rules of conventional warfare to faceoff the threat of an arms race, spy scares and a constant worry about foreignterror campaigns. Such was the case when, as late as 1909, the Committee onImperial Defence (a quango of senior ministers and military chiefs of staff)came to consider how to stand off the kaiser’s warmongering; they were stunnedto discover there wasn’t, as was usually claimed, actually a British secretservice in existence.They, it was clear, were as much victims of myth as everyone else and decidedthat they had better do something about it.images [images/icon.jpg]When, in the spring of 2015, the most recently appointed Chief of the SecretIntelligence Service, MI6, Alex Younger, made his first public appearance, hetook care to discuss some of his own experiences: ‘As I speak, there are SISofficers serving in some of the most dangerous and forbidding places on Earth. Ihad the honour of leading some of them in Afghanistan.’ Adding that he was‘particularly proud’ of how their work had saved numerous British and coalitionlives, there was, perhaps without his realising it, also an unacknowledged linkwith why there needed to be a secret service in the first place.Unsurprisingly, a writer was involved.Rudyard Kipling’s Kim is the apotheosis of the Victorian spy novel, whereinunseen agents of the Raj played ‘the Great Game that never ceases day and nightthroughout India’ (a phrase which is used thirty-six times in Kipling’s story)with its own eerie echoes of today’s war on terror and establishing of politicalsupremacy in the Near East. Intrigue, espionage and, at times, secret warfarecentred on the mountains of Afghanistan, where Kipling’s eponymous hero searchedfor a Russian and a French spy. And so it continues today with the Taliban andIslamist insurgents.Kipling’s fiction imitated late Victorian life and exaggerated it a little. Theactual military intelligence organisation in the Raj at the time was hardly onthe scale nor quite as sophisticated as that described in Kim. There was nooverall intelligence-gathering body in India, though, as a foretaste of thingsto come, there was much rivalry and jealousy between those which did exist.Real-life espionage – or rather its deficiencies – soon became more marked atthe turn of the century when the Empire was threatened by Afrikaner insurgents.The Boer War saw a handful of guerrillas running rings around the British Army.Many battalions were brought to their knees by the use of unorthodox forces.Unmilitary methods, suggested a brave and resourceful reporter for the MorningPost, might be a better answer. Winston Churchill would become an importantfigure in distilling the need for greater flexibility, more imagination and theuse of the unconventional.Yet in the first years of the new century, the myths remained. While the BritishEmpire was believed to have the best espionage system in the world, it actuallyhad no agents in mainland Europe. Worse, with continuing trouble in South Africaand on the North West Frontier, various foreigners from without and terroristswithin – encompassing suffragettes, anarchists and, admittedly, people they justdidn’t like the look of – threatened the certainties of kingdom. But, evenworse, was ‘a menace to the rest of the world’, as the Foreign Office referredto Germany’s militarism and expansionism in 1907.images [images/icon.jpg]At the start of the twentieth century, Britain was a naval power with an empirethat stretched across a quarter of the globe. With a navy twice the size of anyrivals, interlopers could hardly be tolerated. ‘If the German fleet becomessuperior to ours,’ the then First Sea Lord had written at the turn of thecentury, ‘the German army can conquer this country.’The Kriegsmarine warships were taken as potent symbols of Teutonic power. Theaccession of Kaiser Wilhelm II saw him declare that the ocean ‘is essential toGerman greatness’. This Germanic desire for naval pre-eminence fuelled an armsrace over the new Dreadnought-class ships, which could both outgun and outrunexisting vessels. These anxieties would be inflamed by erroneous reports thatBerlin was stepping up its building programme. So began the first ever versionof mutual assured destruction: that the Germans would invade Britain or else theRoyal Navy would do the same in German waters as it had done at Copenhagen in1807 and sink the new fleet.No more potent symbol of this Teutonic aggression came in the form of hisImperial Majesty himself. Often appearing in public wearing his naval uniform,Kaiser Bill found glory and a positive fetish in the potential power ofbattleships. Supported by propaganda, many of his underlings in the German Navy– including Admiral von Tirpitz – had concluded that war with Britain wasunavoidable. The kaiser, in conversation with a friend who later, with hispermission, published the conversation in a sensational article in 1908,famously declared: ‘You English are mad, mad as March hares. What on Earth hascome over you that you harbour such suspicions against us?’Something had to be done – and quickly.Naval Intelligence, originally a committee looking at information gathered fromoverseas created in 1882, now concentrated purely on the collection andcollation of all available material about the Germany Navy. Officers who workedfor the Naval Intelligence Division (NID) now became heirs to that grandNelsonian tradition with a far greater acuity than all other militaryintelligence branches (partly because, unofficially at least, it was alsorelying on Lloyds of London). In time, its officers distributed extensivequestionnaires to captains of His Majesty’s Ships, later making secret surveysof Kiel Harbour using cameras.As Germany started to rattle its sabres, a more efficient national intelligenceorganisation was needed right across the board. That was why, in 1909, theCommittee of Imperial Defence came to consider the matter and the need tocounteract a gathering virulence that had taken hold of the British public: theinhumanity and ubiquity of the German spy, a notion stirred by thebreathtakingly malign genius that was William Tufnell Le Queux.War correspondent, lecturer, novelist and unashamed fantasist, Le Queux was,almost inevitably, a contributor to the Daily Mail, where he was given free reinto play on the great fears that foreigners were plotting the downfall of theEmpire. In 1906, a series of his inflamed articles were collected together inbook form as The Invasion of 1910. The ordinary Londoner would have beenhard-pressed to avoid its promotion. With sandwich-boarded men parading up anddown the busiest streets in Prussian uniforms and spike helmets, his work couldhardly fail to draw attention.In vain, the prime minister dismissed Le Queux as ‘a pernicious scavenger’,2 andtoday, Alan Judd terms his work fantastic, awful and ‘bad enough to beenjoyable’. That same year of 1906, he dashed off half a dozen furtherpotboilers. Within a decade, Le Queux had written dozens of similar works, themost famous being Spies Of The Kaiser in 1909. Overheated, melodramatic andreplete with execrable dialogue, he was a kind of Dan Brown de nos jours inclaiming that all his stories were based in reality. The public was simply beingserved what it wanted to hear: legions of German waiters and barbers – potentialpoisoners and throat-cutters numbering their thousands – were waiting to subvertthe country into submission.This, then, was the atmosphere in which the luminaries of the War Department metin the summer of 1909 to consider such febrile claims. And for that, theCommittee of Imperial Defence turned to a curiously benign character in hisfifties, a passed-over naval officer then paddling around in a backwater, bothliteral and actual, who, as his most recent heir and inheritor says, was, inevery sense of the word, ultimately a hard act to follow, an eccentric and aninspired choice to head up the secret service.images [images/icon.jpg]There is white magic and there is black magic, with many subtle variations inbetween, as with shadings of light and dark: there is illusion and there arehoaxes; there is also legerdemain, a splendid word suggesting deftness of touchwith military connotations; there are séances and spiritual happenings, alongwith esotericism, dualism and gnosticism – ancient religions whose supportersshunned the material world and embraced the spiritual one. Indeed, the very wordmagic comes from the Persian magi, whose original meaning was‘fire-worshippers’. Most of those fires were seen in the sky, whose portentsthese high priests found it prudent to discern, such as those which propelledperhaps the most illustrious magi in history towards a stable in Bethlehem.In other words, the history of magic provides us with the fragments of childhoodmemory and half-forgotten (or half-remembered) folk stories. The list is long:Arabian nights; carpets which transported their owners to mysterious lands;rings that granted miraculous wishes; ubiquitous genies in bottles; seventh sonsof seventh sons; and trees which sprout wonderful fruits. Add to them thegrails, quests and dragons of ancient myth, and we can trace a lineage totoday’s Harry Potter and Philip Pullman’s Lyra and Will, which still enthralpresent-day children – and their parents.In a wider sense, hidden or secret knowledge has an irresistible appeal.If the main criticism of the occult is its readiness ‘to relate the unrelated’,the same, too, could be levelled at the fruit of espionage and intelligencematerial. The rich spiritual world – of magic, mysticism, astrology and alchemy– all evolve from the notion that the ancients or other civilizations somehowpossessed the ultimate wisdom. It doesn’t take too great a leap from crackingthese hidden codes to creating those employed by agents right under the noses ofthe enemy.Occultic revelations may be viewed as the ultimate spiritual need-to-know basis.‘When you are operating as an agent in the field, you never know what’shappening behind your back,’ said the late Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke ofExeter University, the acknowledged world expert on these matters. ‘Even yourown people may think you are completely dispensable. That’s very similar to thereligious situation with the mortal in a gnostic world.’Even after the age of enlightenment, when superstition was supposedly banished,divining the truth from specialist knowledge that gave an insight into a higherorder continued. As a result, various occultic concepts have become curiouslyintertwined in the popular imagination, though each represent separatetributaries in its long, often surreal history. Illusion, magic and hidden oreven forbidden knowledge are all viewed as one and the same. Secrets and secrecyare not restricted to one sphere of human endeavour.Small wonder that many people who later dabbled in the occult world were alsodrawn from – and to – the espionage services in the Second World War. Nowheredoes the subject have a starker contrast than that between Great Britain andGermany in the first few years of the twentieth century. The fighting to come inthe Great War made the careers of many of the secret servants who came toprominence in the Second. Their own loyalties to king and kaiser spilled overinto the later conflict. Shadowing it was another far stranger story, involvinghidden and often unexplored dimensions, despite the superficial similaritiesbetween them.images [images/icon.jpg]Wishful thinking, it should be noted, has always been a leitmotif of the secretworld. Who needed dull, prosaic facts when fiction was so much more believable.The main reason Edwardian spy scares took hold was because, for all itsdeficiencies, the fiction captured the public imagination. It is significantthat many of the characters in the story which follows were writers, journalistsand hacks of one kind or another. Both journalism and espionage have intertwinedto create myths of great potency that, as the sometimes acerbic chronicler ofespionage history, Philip Knightley, has commented, are nothing less than‘romantic nonsense that thrives in the intellectual twilight of the intelligenceworld, folk tales on which new recruits are nurtured and trained’.Certainly, espionage and literature share an ancient lineage. The biblical KingDavid had his own ‘emissaries’, Odysseus seized (and killed) a spy to revealinformation about a bivouac, while Rosencrantz and Guildenstern spied on no lessan exalted figure than the Danish Prince himself, Hamlet. Literary links withspies are as old as the novel itself: the Restoration author Apla Behn wasinvolved in espionage, more tragically still was Christopher Marlowe and, in amore pedestrian way, Daniel Defoe. And this literary tradition continues, for nobetter reason then that writers, after all, are as inquisitive as spies. At somelevel, journalism and espionage are almost identical in their needs of gatheringinformation that will gain primacy, either on the front page of a newspaper orelse in a classified document that will be destined for the prime minister’seyes only.Given that many of the more remarkable intelligence officers in the Second WorldWar were writers or journalists, myths were inevitable. With writers of thecalibre of Graham Greene, Somerset Maugham, Compton Mackenzie, Ian Fleming andRoald Dahl, it could hardly be otherwise.Exaggeration was in their lifeblood. When asked about the distinction betweenspying and reporting, one chronicler – who characteristically did a great dealto confuse the two in the seventies – stated outright: ‘There is none.’ The lateWilliam Stevenson, who, as we will see, wrote one of the more misleading booksabout espionage ever, preferred to use the word ‘Spyglass’. ‘All through thecenturies,’ he took care to explain, ‘reporters of one kind or another have putthe spyglass to events.’It is notable that many former spooks were pithily dismissive of their earliercareers as it all seemed so wonderfully absurd. As a journalist who had workedfor MI6 during the Second World War commented, the shoe was usually on the otherfoot. ‘Diplomats and intelligence agents, in my experience,’ the caustic MalcolmMuggeridge would famously lament, ‘are even bigger liars than journalists, andthe historians who try to reconstruct the past out of their records are, for themost part, dealing in fantasy.’3images [images/icon.jpg]There are very few people – let alone fictional agents imperilled by fiendishforeigners – who can make the extraordinary claim of cutting off their own legwith a penknife. This often repeated story about Mansfield Cumming, the foundingchief of the modern Secret Intelligence Service, is not quite true. Yet itremains part of his enduring legend, its peculiar symbolism inevitably growing‘with the telling and it became part of service mythology’ in the words of theSIS’s own authorised history.The current chief, in unveiling a plaque to his extraordinary predecessor, notedwith a great deal of satisfaction that Cumming’s modern-day heirs use ‘guile,creativity – and that thing that he would most certainly recognise – the sheersatisfaction of putting one over on those who mean us harm’. And, in thisparticular context, his self-inflicted sacrifice comes to define much of thepotency of the fables surrounding Mansfield Cumming and why he is still sorevered today within the modern MI6.When the Great War broke out, the 55-year-old Captain Cumming had embarked on anew career as a spymaster without any particular qualification for the job. Anagreeable eccentric with a paunch and, it has to be said, a Mr Punch-likephysiognomy, he was an inspired choice. Cumming enjoyed all the moreentertaining appurtenances of tradecraft – disguises such as toupées, falsemoustaches and a variety of outfits which he obtained from a theatricalcostumiers in Soho – and sometimes disappeared for weeks on end. In someaccounts, it is said that he pretended to be a German businessman, travellingthrough the Balkans, despite the fact that he didn’t speak a single word ofGerman.That his successors still use the first letter of his surname (and, tongue incheek, Ian Fleming appropriated the other) is a remarkable heritage. ‘I am theonly person in the Service allowed to write or type in Green ink,’ says thelatest C – as the chief still signs himself in all official communications –which also reflects Cumming’s naval background.In many ways, it is unfortunate that Mansfield Cumming was born on April Fool’sDay (1859). Many accounts of people who worked with the first C have portrayedhim as little more than a glorious buffoon: wearing a gold-rimmed monocle, witha penchant for disguises and always referring to his work as ‘capital sport’ andgleefully relating such escapades to his ‘top mates’, as he called his closestassociates.Yet he was hardly an upper-class twit. The man born Mansfield George Smith intoa comfortable middle-class existence was a career naval officer who wascommissioned as a sub-lieutenant after attending Dartmouth Naval College. Alater estimation describes him as ‘a clever officer with a great taste forelectricity’. In time, Cumming developed an unusual attribute for a sailor,suffering from chronic, debilitating seasickness. While routing pirates in theStrait of Malacca in the late 1890s, he had to take extended sick leave. Itsannoying recurrence meant that he was declared unfit for active service.Soon, he was restricted to shore-based commands.A second marriage followed into the family of a fairly wealthy Scottishlandowner, Lady May, a prim, demure lady who remained aloof from her spouse’sday job at the family home in Hampshire. Her husband simply added her maternalname Cumming to his own surname. In 1898, he had been seconded to the foreignsection of the Naval Intelligence Division, which by now was distributingextensive questionnaires to captains of His Majesty’s Ships. It later followedthis up by developing a network of volunteer coastal observers all around theworld to record shipping movements, not least those of the increasinglybelligerent Germany.Small wonder the Admiralty was terrified of a surprise attack. With this inmind, Cumming was retired on half pay to a houseboat in Bursledon4 on theHamble, where his work involved the building up of boom defences on SouthamptonWater. These were an intricate series of wires, extended and elongated poles andvarious wooden men-of-war that would easily ensnare any enemy ships trying tobreak through naval defences. In July 1906, Cumming was ‘promoted’ to the rankof commander (ret’d), with his work on boom defences described as ‘valuable’.Though it was hardly a front-line posting, his handicap never stopped him in histracks. Like many other ageing officers who had been invalided out of activeservice, Mansfield Cumming might well have seen his career fade in the glorioussunset that was Edwardian England. What transformed his fortunes was compoundedby the worst spy scares to date – courtesy of two Williams, Le Queux and thekaiser – and resulted in his being summoned up to London to face a committeethat wanted to transform British Intelligence into something more than the‘amateur improvisation’ which was then in existence.images [images/icon.jpg]Some time in the spring of 1908, a failed artist who was subsisting on bread andmilk could be found shuffling aimlessly around a variety of Viennese flophousesfor a few hours of itinerant rest. With nothing much better to do in the capitalof his native Austria, this shambling, anti-social drifter spent most of hisdays visiting museums, libraries, art galleries and the opera. The young AdolfHitler was, his apologists have made out, absorbing as much Viennese culture asany self-respecting artist and future leader of the Deutsches Volk would beexpected to do.5So it came to pass that one day that spring in the Habsburg Treasure House, thesuffering artist caught sight of an elongated sword on to which variousadornments had been inscribed or written over the subsequent centuries.Shambling around the ornate exhibit case, the young Adolf Hitler first saw itsname – the Spear of Destiny – then heard a nearby guide extolling its virtues.‘There is a legend associated with this spear,’ the guide said in suitablyportentous tones. ‘Whoever claims it and solves its secrets, holds the destinyof the world in his hands, for good or evil.’Adolf Hitler was supposedly electrified. The guide pointed out that the spearcould be traced as far back as Emperor Otto the Great in the tenth century AD –if not before. It was, he claimed, supposedly the lance which the Roman soldierLonginus had used to pierce the flesh of Jesus while he was on the cross.Allegedly used by such leaders as Constantine, Justinian and Charlemagne (in noless than forty-seven military campaigns), ‘the Spear had passed like the fingerof destiny,’ one breathless chronicle relates, ‘forever creating new patterns offorce which had again and again changed the entire history of Europe.’Whatever its true origins and its current provenance, Adolf Hitler went over tothe nearby Hof Library to find out more. There were, it seemed, a whole trancheof spears, all of which were candidates for that which had pierced Jesus on thecross. But the one on display in Vienna seemed to be uniquely possessed of thekind of epoch-making powers which your average fascist dictator-in-the-makingand putative tyrant might find useful one day. For three days, Hitler read up onthe legends surrounding the spear. On the fourth, he went back to the TreasureHouse.‘I slowly became aware of a mighty presence around it,’ he would later recall.‘The same awesome presence which I had experienced inwardly on those rareoccasions in my life when I had sensed that a great destiny awaited me.’This revelation presented Hitler with an apocalyptic ‘window into the future’ inwhich his own importance became abundantly apparent, if not immediatelyattainable.The message, though, was simple. He who controlled the Spear of Destiny wouldcontrol the destiny of the world.images [images/icon.jpg]This story is, of course, arrant nonsense, but apologists for the Nazis and theoccult have rarely let the facts get in the way of a good story. The notion thatAdolf Hitler’s ultimate supremacy came from such demonic influences stillpersists today. Most of the preceding story can be dismissed as entertaining,and indeed overheated, fiction.‘Hitler’s rise to power is directly linked to supernatural powers,’ wrote theacknowledged expert on the subject, Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke.‘According to this mythology, the appeal of Nazism cannot be explainedadequately by secular material or material considerations.’The flames of fantasy have been further fanned by that unique repository of theweird and wonderful, the World Wide Web. Even a cursory search on the Internetshows how pervasive the myth of the Spear of Destiny has become. In reality, theobject which now resides in Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches’ Museum has been shown(in a metallurgical analysis from 2003) to date from the seventh century AD.Yet the legend of the Spear of Destiny lives on.For a mindlessly diverting time, simply do a search for the Spear of Destiny onthe Internet. Every kind of site imaginable ‘from ultra-religious Catholic tofascist fruitcake and new age cult’ provide new wrinkles to the essential kernelof the story outlined above. Certainly, by the time Adolf Hitler came to power,these sorts of accounts suggest he had come to view the Spear of Destiny in muchthe same way that King Arthur did Excalibur.The reality of Adolf Hitler’s supposed obsession with the Spear of Destiny isless Indiana Jones and more an amateur dramatic production where the cast ham itup mercilessly in the silly-ass theatrical style of ’Allo ’Allo. Most of theclaims for the Spear of Destiny’s influence on the Führer are hogwash, spread bya fellow flophouse inhabitant who, despite his subsequent stories, was nevereven a friend of the young Adolf Hitler. These particular yarns have beenelaborated by a former British Commando who had been captured in the WesternDesert in 1941 after a raid to assassinate Rommel.Major Trevor Ravenscroft escaped from captivity three times (but was caught oneach occasion) and after the war became a practitioner of white magic. At somepoint, Ravenscroft met Walter Johannes Stein, who claimed to have met the futureFührer in a Viennese flophouse. The truth is Stein never actually knew AdolfHitler at the time and only ever came across the Spear of Destiny legend yearslater, supposedly after finding a copy of a book in an occult bookshop which hadapparently been owned by Adolf Hitler.Major Ravenscroft simply collected them together and embellished them to concocta ludicrously fanciful account of Hitler’s supposed obsession with the occult.The result is what Professor Goodrick-Clarke called ‘probably the single mostinfluential “Nazi Mysteries” book in the English speaking world’. When The Spearof Destiny appeared in 1972, it became a kind of The Da Vinci Code of its day.It certainly caused an uproar with its claims that Adolf Hitler took peyote,attended séances, employed both satanic powers and planetary doppelgängers, aswell as coming under the direct influence of a social network of occultists inMunich and recruited Aleister Crowley as one of his disciples. Althoughconspiracy theorists continue to pick over these kinds of stories, another morerecent historian has aptly noted, ‘books written about Nazi occultism between1960 and 1975 were typically sensational and under-researched’.And, for the most part, complete and utter nonsense.images [images/icon.jpg]Perhaps the strangest part of this already peculiar story is that WalterJohannes Stein was actually Jewish and fled to Britain in 1933. He liked to maketwo claims: that Aleister Crowley was a black magician who had influencedHitler, and that he himself was a ‘confidential adviser’ to Winston Churchill.There is, bizarrely, some truth in the latter, for according to MI5 files he wasan emissary to a nebulous group of anti-Hitler aristocrats to whom he was sentin October 1939 to Belgium. This was part of an an ongoing series of contactswith high-ranking Germans opposed to Hitler via various cutouts and backchannels to foment anti-Nazi sentiment which would, as we will see, come to adramatic denouement.As to what Stein had done in his earlier years, a pall of mystery descends.According to Professor Goodrick-Clarke, Ravenscroft may well have met WalterStein when he was searching for medical treatment, which the latter clearlyneeded at various points in his life. Stein himself seriously claimed that hewas the reincarnation of Charlemagne’s confidant, Hugo of Tours. He alsobelieved he could capture lost moments in time through transcendental meditationor what he called ‘mind expansion’. The latter, in Trevor Ravenscroft’s account,led to the Führer remembering Stein decades later.To say that both were party to wishful thinking is similar to calling AdolfHitler a shade impetuous. While there was never any doubt that TrevorRavenscroft had been an extraordinarily brave man, he was not exactly the mostreliable of witnesses. Ravenscroft never took any contemporaneous notes, andneither did Stein. One evening in 1957, Stein supposedly told Ravenscroft thathe should write the story of the spear. In a bilious irony, Stein became ill andpassed away the very next day.Two decades later, the major tried to sue the writer James Herbert6 for supposedplagiarism in The Spear – the latter’s improbably silly but enjoyable storyabout neo-Nazi terrorism in England – which Ravenscroft claimed was stolen fromhis own The Spear of Destiny. As they waited at the High Court in March 1979, aweirdly illuminating conversation took place. During a discussion with a QC,Ravenscroft suddenly announced that he and his litigant had met before.At the crucifixion.‘I was on the right-hand side of Christ and Herbert was on the other,’Ravenscroft said. That particular legal action ended with James Herbert havingto pay damages for plagiarism. ‘He did so to give his novel a backbone of truthwith the least possible labour to himself,’ said the judge, before adding hisown splenetically vitriolic coda. ‘One must not underestimate the commercialattraction of the rubbish I have attempted to describe.’It is for reasons like this that a powerful urban myth has taken hold about theFührer’s time in Vienna. Wandering around soup kitchens, dressing like a tramp,imbibing half-forgotten items of cultural knowledge to fuel his prejudices, theSpear of Destiny supposedly provides a continuous link with all past and futureworlds of magic and occultic power, a kind of lucky talisman between the worldsof sense and spirit. Three decades later, after the Anschluss which re-annexedhis native Austria, the Führer is supposed to have spent as much time with theSpear of Destiny as he could. That was why it was removed and placed beneath thestreets of Nuremberg, symbolically and significantly, the spiritual home ofNazism’s most Wagnerian excesses.What we do know is that the Nazis did indeed seize the Hapsburg ‘Crown Jewels’ –with which the Spear of Destiny was associated – in 1938 and transport them fromVienna to Nuremberg. It was a pattern of plunder to be repeated around OccupiedEurope. Today, the Spear resides in Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches’ Museum7 andwould, like any other mildly interesting military relic, have led a blamelesslife if it were not for the idiotic claims of modern-day would-be mystics.images [images/icon.jpg]By the time that Adolf Hitler had moved into a homeless shelter at the end of1909 after once more failing to gain entrance to a Viennese art school, theBritish Secret Service was born out of extreme political expediency. Asub-committee of The Committee of Imperial Defence recommended that a unified,national intelligence service be created, ‘just as convinced as any reader of LeQueux’s books that large numbers of German spies were at work in Britain’ in oneacademic assessment.What was originally known as the Secret Service Bureau came into being on 24July 1909. One half concerned itself with home security, the other keeping agimlet eye on the foreigners who were believed to be causing all the trouble inthe first place. Both organisations would be commanded by officers who had beeninvalided out of their respective services.To keep an eye on the enemy within, the government turned to an accomplishedlinguist, Captain Vernon Kell, who had served in the South StaffordshireRegiment in the Boer Rebellion. Kell had returned home with the terrible asthmathat would afflict him for the rest of his life, yet could, in the estimation ofone colleague, ‘smell a spy like a terrier smells a rat’. Heading up the homesection of the Secret Service Bureau, Kell soon exhibited imperturbablesteeliness and a propensity for hand-to-hand bureaucratic fighting with thefellow desk-bound officer with whom he now shared an office.Even though Mansfield Cumming was junior and of a lower rank to Kell, he washardly respectful. According to the records, Captain Kell and CaptainSmith-Cumming spent most of their time bickering over resources, perhaps becausethey had very little else to do. By the time Cumming took up his post at thestart of October, both he and Kell had moved into the War Office and came underthe control of Military Operations.8 ‘Went to the office,’ Captain Cumming notedin his diary on his first day at work, ‘and remained all day, but saw no one,nor was there anything to do there.’In its first few years of existence, Mansfield Cumming’s putative secret servicehad few agents, little money and was ‘frequently frustrated and often overruledand even ignored’. The ‘overseas’ section was continually eclipsed by NavalIntelligence, which was now well into its second decade of operations. Whereasthe navy had a full admiral in charge of its own dedicated intelligence service,Cumming did not even attain the rank of acting captain until 1915. Within weeksof starting his work, he had complained in exasperation to the Director of NavalIntelligence (who had suggested him for the role) that, ‘Surely we can not beexpected to sit in the office month by month doing nothing?’His own meeting with agents went some way to relieve the boredom.Cumming would often arrive by taxi ‘as it is almost impossible for the man – ifa rascal – to point you out to his friends, who may be waiting with a camera’and was diligent in working hard to develop a network of agents, who were mostoften businessmen who travelled abroad. ‘Agents lay at the heart of Cumming’sworld as they lie at the heart of ours,’ the current chief, Alex Younger, hasnoted. ‘They are our lifeblood. They always have been.’ Cumming’s diary, asrevealed by his biographer, has any number of cryptic annotations referring toagents and people who could provide information.Within a year, full-time assistants were assigned to both, and soon Cumming wasasking for an agent in Copenhagen to report on ‘German naval construction andarmaments’, for it was blindingly obvious who would be the inevitable enemy, acountry whose citizens were more likely to invoke magic, superstition and a longoccultic heritage.images [images/icon.jpg]Magic and the supernatural had exerted a peculiar hold over the various Germanictribes which was quite unparalleled in Western Europe. In many ways, the occultuniquely defined the German experience. The Holy Roman Empire, for example,burned to death more than 100,000 people for practising witchcraft. In morerecent times, there had been a steady flood of membership to secret societies –real or imaginary – such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons.The latter, for all the later cheerleading of its evil intent by conspiracytheorists, grew out of the medieval building trade whose lodges for itinerantworkers were transformed over the years to become more akin to gentlemen’sclubs. Soon, its members were believed to be party to hidden knowledge and thesecrets supposedly brought to Scotland by The Knights Templar. Around this sametime, the Bavarian branch of the Freemasons was infiltrated by the Illuminatiand a whole host of conspiracies were triggered.Mysticism had also, by the start of the Edwardian era, become hugely popular inBritain, with the birth of the Golden Dawn, a branch of Rosicrucianism informedby secret knowledge going back to Egyptian times. Many of its members had beenrecruited from yet another sect –– the Theosophical Society – who believed thatimmortal knowledge had been revealed by the so-called Secret Chiefs. Two ofthese mysterious figures had revealed themselves to Madame Helena PetrovinaBlavatsky, the founder and curious promoter of the theosophical philosophy.Tall and shapeless, with thick hair ‘crinkled to the roots like the fleece of aCotswold ewe’, Madame Blavatsky’s head was topped by a fireman’s felt hat and aveil. She lived in a house that she shared with a stuffed baboon which had acopy of On the Origin of Species under its arm. Her version of the occult –‘with its melange of Egyptian and Buddhist elements’, as one reviewer terms it –essentially showed that science couldn’t explain everything. Darwin was wrong.Mankind came not from the apes, but spirit beings who had arrived here fromVenus, via the Moon.Madame Blavatsky’s own mysterious background in Victorian times added to herlustre. On her various travels, she had met a Tibetan sage, Master Morya, whomonly initiates could see: one of many hidden figures who supposedly populatedthe universe and, in one tart reviewer’s later estimation, communicated ‘by akind of interstellar radio, and linking chosen humans [with] the divinehierarchy that rules the cosmos’. In an age of the camera, telephone and thetransoceanic cable, telepathic communication hardly seemed out of place.Madame Blavatsky acted, in effect, as a post office for the Secret Chiefs. Yetwhen people investigated her claims, it seemed her notebook on which sherecorded their wisdom appeared to be filled with childlike graffiti. Both sheand the Theosophical Society were soon condemned by the Society for PsychicalResearch. Other scientists got in on the act, too, wanting, as everybody elsedid, to find proof of life after death.From out of her organisation grew the Golden Dawn, dismissed as a self-regardingcollection of ‘mediums, spells, the Mysterious Orient’ by W.H. Auden. Its ownrituals were its greatest secrets but by the turn of the century, it had passedthrough its own golden age, splintering into factionalism. Around the same time,another organisation was created which would come to have a disproportionateeffect as ‘the world’s most dangerous secret society’.The Order of the Oriental Templars (OTO) had its own leanings towards orientalmysticism – with a certain amount of sexual liberation thrown in for goodmeasure. Formed by a clique of German Freemasons, a wealthy industrialist and anAmerican who had experimented with hallucinogens, the OTO’s leading light wasTheodor Reuss, who had been engaged as a spy to keep tabs on Karl Marx and hisfamily in Victorian England.Under his expert tutelage, the OTO expanded across Europe in the first few yearsof the century, and eventually into the United States. The instrument for thislater expansion was a mystic who not only had been a member of the Golden Dawn,but now took on the name Perdurabo: ‘The brother who will endure’. Yet as onewho examined these tangled origins put it, with his recruitment, the order ‘hadgiven birth to its first pseudo messiah’.His name was Aleister Crowley.images [images/icon.jpg]In the run-up to war, the real-life Secret Chief, Mansfield Cumming, dominatedhis own odd looking-glass world, not least when he moved into Whitehall Court, alarge mansion block just round the corner from the War Office wherein nothingwas ever quite what it seemed. After climbing six flights of stairs, a visitorfound himself wandering through a warren of corridors, coming across mirrors anddoors which, when opened, all seemed to lead nowhere. By the time they reachedthe chief’s office, many felt that they had ended up from whence they hadstarted.C would be awarded no official recognition ‘as we were to be dissociated fromthe authorities entirely’, he noted for the record, ‘and not recognisedsecretly’. Captain Cumming soon developed a reputation for toughness – and it ishard to see how an effective spymaster could be otherwise – as well as mystery.Secrecy for its own sake and also obduracy (‘Obstinate as a mule,’ vividlyrecalled one colleague, ‘with a chin like the cut-water of a battleship.’) wouldcloak much of his work with the aura of great inscrutability. That would becomehis stock in trade, as it continues today for the modern Secret IntelligenceService. Cumming did his best to keep all his ideas, staff and methodsclandestine, ‘as secrets shared with anyone else cease to be secrets’.9His own exploits add to the chief’s marvellously absurd sense of theatre. On onewall of his office was a photograph of a heavily built man in obvious Germanclothing. Cumming delighted when people didn’t recognise that it was him on oneof his own adventures. As well as signing himself C, intriguingly, some ofCumming’s first agents were known as M, P and Q in his cryptic diaries.Cumming’s desk, lovingly transported to what today’s staff call ‘Legoland’, thecurious post-modern building at Vauxhall Cross, was built from oak hewn fromNelson’s Victory. His naval logbooks, recounting many of his escapades, are keptin the modern C’s office and shown to recruits. Another antique which remains inthe chief’s office is the solid-oak clock which Cumming built by his own hand,described by those who have seen it as solid as its maker with a square top, anopen glass front and oversize Roman numerals. According to some, it still keepsgood time, revealing both his mechanical skills and interests.‘Cumming was a surprisingly modern man,’ says the current incumbent as C. ‘Hewas not a bureaucrat, he was an innovator fascinated by technology, and thedevelopment of new equipment ranging from cars and aeroplanes to secret inks andwireless sets.’ As well as his study in Whitehall Court, Cumming spent a lot oftime fiddling around in his own workshop, where he would tinker to his heart’scontent. ‘He had a passion for inventions of all sorts,’ noted one officer withthe unlikely name of Edward Knoblock, ‘and being a rich man, he often bought therights to them, such as strange telescopes, mysterious mechanisms with which tosignal in the dark.’In other words (with apologies to Ian Fleming) C was both M and Q rolled intoone. Cumming clearly loved this aspect of his work, which lead to some highlysurreal conversations, such as that which resulted from enquiries at LondonUniversity about invisible inks. Some time later, in October 1915, the deputyhead of military intelligence at GHQ France noted that he ‘heard from C that thebest invisible ink is semen’, which did not react to the main methods ofdetection.Seminal fluid apparently had the advantage of being readily available.One colleague recalled C’s delight when the Deputy Chief Censor said one daythat one of his staff had found out that ‘semen would not react to iodinevapour’, a great breakthrough at the time. Yet the officer who had identifiedthis novel use had to be moved from his department after becoming the butt ofjokes. At least one agent in the field had to be reminded to use only freshsupplies of the ‘ink’ when correspondents began noticing an unusual smell.images [images/icon.jpg]When, in March 2015, the newly appointed chief of MI6, Alex Younger, came tovenerate Mansfield Cumming by unveiling a plaque at Whitehall Court, he claimedthat Cumming’s service was (‘as SIS is now’, Younger added) ‘a smallorganisation that achieved big things’. As the new chief noted, his firstpredecessor ‘took the service through World War I while incidentally learning tofly a biplane’. The chief was also an early and enthusiastic member of the RoyalAutomobile Club and the Royal Motor Yacht Club. Despite the accident which laterclaimed the life of his son, Cumming became a competitive racing driver of somenote.‘I know of nothing more enjoyable than skimming along at a cracking pace,’Cumming would write in the RAC journal, ‘especially if you are picking up on thenext car ahead.’ Perhaps this devotion to speed explains why he subsequentlydrove his Rolls-Royce far too fast for his own good – and let his great niece,aged just 12, steer it down Piccadilly – or else terrified colleagues when hetook them to his club. In time, many of his officers gained a reputation forindiscreet, indescribable, unorthodox and utterly unruly behaviour, mainlybecause the sort of people attracted to espionage were the least likely to keepsecrets. Many were businessmen involved in shipping, who reported on what theyfound on their travels. More often than not, their information was gossip orfacts regurgitated from newspapers.‘C always employed scoundrels,’ one of his officers would complain, and Cumminghimself once termed them ‘blackguards’. Some absconded with money, never to beseen again: one agent staged his own suicide, disappearing to the United Stateswith all the secret service funds he could get his hands on; another shothimself when he was asked to explain the whereabouts of £28,000 he had been sentby Captain Cumming’s contact. The chief took such escapades in his stride,knowingly referring to some of his agents as ‘scallywags’ and ‘rascals’. On oneoccasion, Cumming said to one ne’er-do-well he wanted to employ, ‘You are justthe man we want’, claiming he knew all about his past history, which waschequered to say the least.Mischief was meat and drink to the chief. Returning officers were often thankedand entertained by Cumming in person. The chief’s private wealth meant that hecould dine at The Savoy and entertained his guests there, where their tales ofderring-do were enough to allow entry into Mansfield Cumming’s innermost circle,a kind of brotherhood bound by scoundrels and secrets of their own making.images [images/icon.jpg]When the Great War broke out, there was no greater scoundrel so far as many inBritain were concerned than the man christened Edward Alexander Crowley, one ofthe more remarkable fantasists and exotic protagonists in this already peculiarstory. Given the nature of many of the characters to come, that is sayingsomething. Aleister (as he styled himself) Crowley was many things: a complexpolymath, egotistical, ambitious, possessed of a brilliant mind but also aself-seeking show off who enjoyed operating in full public view. His variousobsessions with the occult meant that by the outbreak of the Great War, he hadbecome (in the public prints, at least) something of an enigma.Pitching himself as something like the diabolical progeny of Russell Brand andYoko Ono in terms of self-promotion and wilful obscurity, Aleister Crowley wasrelentless in his need for recognition. By now, Crowley was better known forvarious theatrical performances and obscure utterances that baffled most of hislisteners (and diminishing number of readers). Another writer and recruit toMI6, who worked in Russia in 1917 for Cumming, Somerset Maugham, termed him,with perhaps the greatest and simplest accuracy of all, as ‘a fake, but notentirely fake’.Aleister Crowley casts a curious, baleful influence upon this story. Nothing canever quite be pinned down, rather like the man himself, with his devotion tosex, drugs and magic (though, to be fair, the man himself claimed it was poetry,mountaineering and magick). The rock and roll, it should be noted, came later,after The Beatles put him on the cover of their Sergeant Pepper album, therebyelevating him into the iconography of the sixties counterculture. Throughout hislife, Crowley considered himself a prophet rejected in his own land, a fatewhich he claimed only befell ‘most men of distinction’.His own self-reverential mythology was no less pervasive than those spread byagents of Mansfield Cumming’s secret service. His exaggerations created a legendas durable as those of any secret agent. Aleister Crowley termed magic ‘the actof communicating without obvious means’ and always spelled it with a k, ‘todistinguish between mere conjuring and real magic’, as he liked to put it. Thereis even greater smoke and mirrors concerning his supposed involvement inintelligence operations, which are hard to confirm and thus difficult to dispel.To be fair, Crowley had tried to bring together various esoteric traditions,becoming, as we will see, many things to many people.10 It was almost inevitablethat he would create his own sect, though, as perhaps the best parody ever onthe subject put it, he never claimed to be the messiah: he really was a verynaughty boy. Born into the Plymouth Brethren, a strict religious grouping, itwas ironic that his family’s wealth accrued from the brewing of Crowley’s Alesat a brewery in Surrey. The young Crowley did not suffer materially, thoughmentally he was clearly conflicted.His parents were zealots who believed that Christ’s return was imminent. Suchapocalyptic anticipation caused a frenzied reaction in their firstborn son. TheBible was the only book he was allowed to read. There would be no deviation fromits literal interpretation. Christmas was regarded as a pagan festival. Mostother churches were viewed as ‘synagogues of Satan’. Small wonder that thisstrict religious upbringing sparked his interest in false prophets and scarletwomen – and that the very concept of The Beast ranged powerfully in his mind.Sheltered, punished and austere, Aleister Crowley’s was the enclosed childhoodof the rich. At the age of 8, chubby and unworldly, he was bullied andtormented. Finding schools not to his liking, he was eventually allowed to studyat home. While the young Aleister adored his father, he loathed his mother.Edward Crowley was, he claimed, his hero, who ‘never allowed his religion tointerfere with natural affection’. By comparison, he found his mother physicallyrepugnant. With her oddly oriental features, the young Aleister considered thewoman born Emily Bishop his father’s social inferior. Some of his deeplyingrained misogyny stemmed from her prissy Victorian piousness.At the age of 12, his father’s death in 1887 devastated him and he soonrebelled. His mother became more devout (what he termed ‘the hysteria ofwidowhood’). He revelled in sin and when he was 15, Aleister Crowley took greatpleasure in losing his virginity to an actress – in one account – after whichhis mother termed him the Great Beast, wondering quite what she had spawned.Throughout his middle teens, he travelled, fornicated and, with what some mightthink divine justice, was handed into the care of a wilfully cruel uncle. Underthis harsh regime, he became paranoid about people knowing what he was doing.This soon manifested itself, as his biographer Martin Booth notes, in making him‘regard everyone around him as a spy, a trait that allied to his occasionalshyness, was to be an aspect of his character throughout his life’.Yet there were more wholesome distractions for the teenage Crowley. When he was16, on holiday in Skye, he became fascinated by the new sport of mountaineering,or what we would today call rock climbing (though these were, it should benoted, serious expeditions). It gave him a sense of freedom, a feeling of powerand a curious inner harmony. Now he was ready to take on the world, for by nowhe considered himself a genius. Playing chess became an enduring enthusiasm,sometimes playing three games simultaneously, while blindfolded. In October1895, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, supposedly studying moralsciences.‘I found myself my own master,’ he later wrote, ‘and settled down to lead arighteous, sober and godly life.’It didn’t last long. He was a loner and profligate, wasting his immenseinheritance and time on such pursuits as esoterica and black magic. Yet by thesame token, Crowley was well read, opinionated and witty. His arrival inCambridge coincided with the Oscar Wilde Trial, which prompted his dandifiedappearance and sexual loucheness in the hope of being sent down. He devoted agreat deal of time to reading and writing his own erotic literature – whichwould be difficult to get published – as sexual freedom was his greater interestof all.Whether it was from having sex with prostitutes or women he met in taverns,Crowley caught the clap and syphilis. There were more dangerous liaisons, too,which led to his penning some lines of poetry, which, for once, are not opaque:He who seduced me first, I could not forgetI hardly loved him, but desired to tasteA new strong sinSeveral of his biographers believe that his first gay experience, while onholiday in Stockholm on New Year’s Eve 1896, also helped awaken Crowley to magicpossibilities.‘It was an experience of horror and pain,’ he wrote, ‘combined with a certainghostly terror, yet at the same time it was the key to the purest and holiestspiritual ecstasy that exists.’Far from being evil, The Beast was more a dilettante hedonist, the originalTrustafarian who had nothing better to do – such as taking his finals. Afterleaving Cambridge without a degree, Crowley joined a local temple, the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn, and assumed the name of Perdurabo. He did indeedendure, impressing Samuel Liddell Mathers, one of its founders who had initiatedhim into the group. Yet the poet W.B. Yeats, who thought him an ‘unspeakabledegenerate’ and considered him insane, did his best to get Crowley ejected. Hisrepeated boasts of being higher up the order than he really was, his dubioussexuality and his lack of morals meant that many others turned against him.Crowley lost interest in the group, determined to make his mark – and not justof 666 – and began on what one biographer has termed ‘his magical way towardsfame, infamy, vilification and a reputation he could hardly have foreseen’.Thanks to his inheritance, Crowley became an itinerant wanderer, first inMexico, where he steeped himself in Mayan and Aztec Lore, then the Far East. In1902, he took part in the first attempt to scale K2, the second highest and, byrepute, the most savage mountain on the roof of the world. Its reputation asunassailable came true. Thanks to snowblindedness, malaria and hallucinations,Crowley went through sixty-eight days of horror, and the Himalayan mountainremained unconquered.He next turned up in Paris, whose belle époque pretensions bored him. Sometimein 1903, though, a significant development took place at a spa near Edinburgh,where Aleister Crowley met what he termed his ‘Scarlet Woman’ – Rose EdithSkerret, the widowed sister of a Cambridge contemporary. ‘Physically andmorally,’ he later exulted, ‘Rose exercised on every man she met a fascinationwhich I have never seen anywhere else, not a fraction of it.’ And soon, afterjoining together in holy matrimony, his whole world was turned upside down witha series of visions and ecstasies that he alone was privileged to witness.images [images/icon.jpg]Mansfield Cumming’s own interest in magic only ever extended so far as conjuringtricks for his family, and he was, in one contemporary estimation, ‘anextrovert, bluff and charming man, a live wire of boisterous, outgoing natureand a great tease with the children’. He actively encouraged his youngestrelatives to poke hatpins into his wooden leg. In later years, he did the samewith a paper knife for potential recruits: those who winced were deemedunsuitable to join His Majesty’s Secret Service.Captain Cumming’s need for a wooden leg came from a curious episode.11 Justafter the start of the First World War, in October 1914, he was driving in a carwith his son in northern France when it crashed into a tree at full speed.Alastair Cumming was killed instantly. Finding his legs broken and trapped,Cumming somehow found a penknife and hacked at his left leg until he was free.Cumming crawled over to his son and put a coat over him (‘That’s the sort ofchap old C is,’ a later colleague marvelled). Cumming himself was foundcompletely unconscious by soldiers a few hours later. His left foot was thensurgically removed. Captain Cumming was fitted with a false leg and occasionallydisconcerted people by tapping absent-mindedly at it with various unlikely (andoften painful-sounding) objects.C’s curious physical appearance alone was a gift to future novelists and writers(who added to his mystique by never revealing his real name). Somerset Maugham,for example, who had worked for him, later recalled: ‘The thing immediatelynoticeable about him was the closeness with which his blue eyes were set.’So began the myth of the steely, secret servant.‘At first encounter he appeared very severe,’ another of his more famous agents,Paul Dukes, later remarked. ‘His manner of speech was abrupt. Woe betide theunfortunate individual who ever incurred his ire!’ And yet his sturdyreliability – like the clock he bequeathed to the service – means that eventoday, the latest chief of MI6 has termed Cumming ‘our common ancestor’, addingthat the service ‘feels like a surprisingly chief-centred organisation’.It partly stemmed from his ability at infighting. The Secret IntelligenceService carried through the war in a strange bureaucratic limbo: created by theWar Office, Cumming worked out of the Admiralty building, but was paid for bythe Foreign Office. Cumming used this administrative blurring to his greatestadvantage, for he was a shrewd Whitehall operator. ‘C always used to boast thatas he had three masters he had not got one at all,’ a colleague recalled, ‘as hecould always set the two against any objections.’The current chief notes that Cumming ‘as steward of a fledgling organisation,faced a number of attempts by other departments to close him down and lacked thesupport he needed from some quarters in Whitehall’.12 Though MI6 was limited byhaving no agents in Germany, it developed a highly efficient train-watchingservice in Belgium (with fifty-one separate posts at one time) which monitoredGerman troop movements all along the Western Front. In the last eighteen monthsof the conflict, three-quarters of the intelligence gathered behind enemy linescame from a dedicated network codenamed the ‘White Lady’. Cumming’s officersalso gained information from highly placed sources in other countries – notablyDenmark, from a source known as TR-16, a German-born naval officer who had beencourt-martialled for insulting a relative of the kaiser – and now alerted themilitary to the shipping of men and materiel across the North Sea.In other words, both Mansfield Cumming and MI6 had a good war.When information came in to Whitehall Court, it was bound together in largebooks with red cloth bindings, a practice which continued until fairly recently.Today, MI6 reports are still distributed via the Foreign Office, more often thannot electronically, and are still known as CX material. This is an abbreviationof Cumming Exclusively (as in, for C’s eyes only), as they were known in thosefar distant times when Britain faced off the threat from Germany and HisMajesty’s Secret Service rose to the task splendidly.images [images/icon.jpg]There were certain revelations that were only ever meant for Aleister Crowley’seyes. As with all occultic visions, they were both horrible and fearful, yetecstatic and enchanting, which proved, beyond all doubt that he was the prophetof a new age of humanity. In April 1904, he first became aware of Aiwass, amessenger of an ancient god, whom he saw during a séance as a tall, dark man inhis 30s ‘with the face of a savage kind and eyes veiled lest their gaze shoulddestroy what they say’.It was the culmination of three days of magickal activities in Cairo. They wouldset the seal for his own fate along with Rose, his wife and Scarlet Woman, whohad undergone a trance induced by hashish. She told him that Horus, thefalcon-headed god of antiquity in Egypt, was waiting for him. He should, shesaid, go to a temple in their apartment, wherein he heard a man’s voice as theystarted their rituals. This deep voice, ‘musical and expressive, its tonessolemn, voluptuous, tender, fierce’, provided him with the words for what hecalled The Book of the Law, which he faithfully transcribed.Saying this was the religion of Thelema, derived from the Greek word for will –and that he had been appointed the prophet of this same religion – AleisterCrowley had found his worldly vocation. Its central doctrine was ‘Do what thouwill shall be the whole of the law’, which was, in its prophet’s interpretation,nothing less than a clarion call for the hedonistic excess that he made all hisown. Whatever else he might have been, Crowley was a gloriously unpredictablecharacter, making up rules and then subverting them. Opinion veers from hisbeing a blatant devotee of debauchery to a much-maligned mystic and, indeed,holy figure.After his vision, he personally instructed people in the ways of magick, forminghis own cult and sometimes joining others. With his trust funds, he bought ahouse, Boleskine, on the shores of Loch Ness (later bought by the guitaristJimmy Page), where he acted like a laird, intimidated the locals with hisreputation and attended to his magic and writings. To the average reader theywere obscure and, at times, unreadable. He had to publish his own luxuriouslybound poetry – corny, trite and invariably incomprehensible – privately as theydidn’t sell.At Boleskine, Rose gave birth to a daughter, but then Crowley travelled again tothe Far East, setting out to climb another Nepalese mountain, Kangchenjunga, thehome of the gods in folklore. When he first saw it, ‘faint blue, clear white inthe dawn’, Crowley claimed he was only interested in establishing an altituderecord. Arrogance and egotism would be his undoing on this expedition. There wasnear mutiny when a porter deserted and died. Another slipped, caused anavalanche and Crowley refused to help.When he eventually returned to Britain, he found that his daughter had died fromtyphoid in Rangoon. Shocked, his health failed and he was clearly in agony. ‘Iwant blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution,’ he said, eventually abandoning Rosewhile he continued on his life of magical indulgence. He didn’t resume hisoccult activities until 1909, and when he did, they were often ridiculouslytheatrical in public demonstrations of magic and symbolism. By now, the moneywas starting to run out, and his shouting of ‘there is no god’ had more to dowith his own lack of faith than anything blasphemous.images [images/icon.jpg]During the Great War, Mansfield Cumming was not the biggest chief in the secretworld. C was outranked, and, it has to be said, eclipsed by the much morebullish character who had been appointed to the post of Director of NavalIntelligence (DNI) in November 1914. Reggie ‘Blinker’ Hall was cut from asimilar cloth and on one occasion would declare that Cumming’s motto was verysimple: ‘Wisdom is better than weapons of war.’ Hall would have an even betterwar for, in several estimations, he was one of the most impressive intelligenceofficers of his generation. Another went so far as to baldly state that theGreat War was won by ‘the uncanny ability of this great Sherlock Holmes’.Like Cumming, Hall’s was an unfortunate physiognomy: to some he was reminiscentof Mr Punch – and similar to Cumming – with a hook nose, which to ComptonMackenzie, was better suited to ‘a nut about to be cracked by a toucan’. Hisscrewing-up of his eyes and rapid blinking led to his unfortunate nickname.Appearances were deceptive, for ‘Blinker’ Hall was fearless, demanding, buthighly imaginative. His piercing stare and conspicuous false teeth helpeddisconcert anyone he was interrogating. An energetic, fantastic organiser, hiswas, in the awed respect of the US ambassador, ‘a clear case of genius’.The organisation he took over in October 1914 prospered. Captain Hall had been asuccessful, innovative commander of the Queen Mary. With the outbreak of war,the Naval Intelligence Division’s role was transformed into gathering as muchinformation as possible about the kaiser’s navy. The main problem facing the NIDwas simple: how to detect the German High Seas Fleet as they left the KielCanal. So NID developed a network of volunteer coastal observers all around theworld to record shipping movements and, in Nigel West’s apposite phrase,transformed them into a human radar chain.Hall’s men were helped when they received a signal book from the Russians,removed from the body of a drowned officer, ‘a gift more precious than a dozenFabergé eggs’ in the First Sea Lord’s eloquent estimation. Nevertheless, thevoice of Winston Churchill, as well as his DNI, echoed in the wilderness. Morethan anything, Blinker Hall’s appreciation of cryptography meant he gatheredtogether a unique collection of what one later review termed ‘an inner body ofsome half-a-dozen officers attempting the impossible’.Despite decoding German intentions at the Battle of Jutland, higher officers didnot use them to significant advantage and the codebreakers ‘simmered withresentment’ over what had happened. Ironically, in that exchange, Hall’s oldship was blown up. Had the DNI remained at sea he would have almost certainlybeen killed. Within months, though, their work would change the fate of theworld when they unbuttoned an enciphered message from the German foreignminister to his counterpart in Mexico City. America’s entry into the First WorldWar was assured. The Zimmermann message thus ensured Germany’s defeat. Hallfinished the war with his reputation riding high (supposedly, his greatest everachievement was seeing through the most famous femme fatale in history, MataHari).13Yet Reggie Hall was a maverick who had a greater feel for the great game. As onenaval historian who knew him well has written, the DNI ensured ‘the world ofspies, agents, deception, bribery, disinformation, destabilisation, all thatside of Intelligence now stigmatised as the “Dirty Tricks” department’. And as aresult, Hall’s organisation, too, would have another strange claim to fame, whenin the spring of 1916, another curious character came into the view of BritishIntelligence: Aleister Crowley.images [images/icon.jpg]If there was another myth that took hold after the fighting was finished, it wasthat of the superiority of British propaganda. Yet as one historian has noted,it ‘required five years of honest effort in order to devise a psychologicalwarfare system sufficient to meet the needs of a great power at war.’ In lateryears, German writers ascribed this supposed pre-eminence to an inherentfiendishness in the British character compared to the gullible purity of theTeutonic spirit. No greater partisan was the corporal who claimed to have beenblinded by a gas attack in the final year of the fighting. Adolf Hitler wouldnote that ‘propaganda was a weapon of the first class, while with us it was asop to unemployed politicians.’Or, for that matter, underemployed sages.To understand Aleister Crowley’s involvement in British propaganda, it has to beseen in the light of a starker reality: that after those first few years, theconfusion and duplicity of the effort prompted one senior official to take theinitiative, as he always seemed to do, and exceed his own authority. AdmiralReggie Hall would use guile and deception to get his own way and make his ownmark. It would also lead to a reversal of fortune for Aleister Crowley, who hadarrived in New York City on the equally doom-laden Lusitania in 1914. Nothingwas as it seemed during the great Beast’s subsequent American interlude.‘What followed were five years of frequent penury,’ writes Professor RichardSpence of the University of Idaho, ‘and scores of occult workings, mostly of thesexual variety.’ In some accounts, Crowley had moved to America because he hadtaken the huff over not being employed as an agent of intelligence. Hesubsequently authored a handful of virulently anti-British articles, which ledto his vilification in his homeland.The reasons why are worthy of examination. Within two years of the fighting, acertain heavy-handedness had come to characterise the British response todealing with the neutral United States. The British censors interfered with thetransatlantic mails and would blacklist US firms suspected of dealings with theCentral Powers. When one newspaper censor in London came across the story of aBriton proclaiming Irish independence from the Statue of Liberty he took notice.The name was at least familiar. Aleister Crowley was up to his old tricks again.Or was he? Crowley himself later claimed that he was involved in the prosecutionof propaganda, that, as he later explained it, was ‘so blatantly extravagantonly a German would have believed it’. As to how and why, greater mysteries thanthose of the occult now gather. When applying to visit the US thirty yearslater, Crowley claimed he was in Switzerland when the war broke out. He was, heclaimed, hoping to be commissioned into the RNVR, but a few weeks later was‘attacked by phlebitis, which bars me permanently from active service’. Inanother interview with a New York paper, The Evening World, he claimed he wasshot in the leg while ‘in the confidential service of the British government’.Many other rumours about Crowley’s supposed connections with BritishIntelligence have proliferated. Certainly, it is true that he had dealings withthe Naval Intelligence Division. His contact was the Honourable Francis EverardJoseph Feilding, who, like Ian Fleming in the next war, was commissioned intothe RNVR as a lieutenant. Like Fleming, Feilding had many connections in thecity, but, unlike him, also had many interests in exotica. A charter member ofthe Masonic Order of Christ and a former secretary of the Society for PsychicalResearch, Crowley based a character on him in Moonchild who says, ‘investigationof spiritualism makes a capital training ground for secret service work, onesoon gets up to all the tricks’.Feilding’s own, more reliable recollections sometimes muddy the picture further.Aleister Crowley wrote to him, was anxious to work as a spy and, ‘by variouspreposterous performances’, made out that he was disaffected. But it was mostlikely the other way around. In a note to the historian Gerald Yorke, Feildingclaimed that the Beast’s ‘taste for farcical situations’ was a reason for thereluctance in employing him. And yet Crowley, as would be expected, crowed thateven that was all part of a greater plan.‘I knew that the only way I could combat the influence of German propaganda inthe States was to identify myself with it in every way and by making itabhorrent to any sane being,’ he claimed, ‘gradually get the minds of theAmerican public to react against its insidious appeal.’Feilding noted that Crowley also asked him to start a defamation campaignagainst him in the English press, ‘with the idea that this would confirm hisevil reputation in America so far as British Intelligence was concerned’. Andwhen that did eventually take place, because Crowley was well known and lappedup the attention, Feilding noted that ‘treachery to his country was not one ofthem’. Certainly, he was useful to the NID for he could inveigle himself (as heseems to have done) into pro-German circles. Behind that was the hidden hand ofanother master at work.‘Admiral Hall’s policy appears to have been to follow the perpetrators, let theoutrage happen, expose the culprits and turn American opinion against Germany,’writes Tobias Churton, an academic who has done much to illuminate thesedevelopments.American national opinion had also been inflamed by the fallout from the EasterRising of 1916. Even Crowley remained coy about the Irish aspects of his work,some of it carried out with John Quinn, an Irish-American bibliophile who hadearlier hosted Sir Roger Casement,14 an Irish-born consular official for theBritish Government who appointed himself ambassador to the Irish state. As partof a greater propaganda effort, all that the British could do to fight back wasto destroy Casement’s reputation. Professor Spence speculates that Quinn couldwell have been Crowley’s contact, and a report for the US Army’s militaryintelligence division states specifically that it had been ‘determined thatAleister Crowley was an employee of the British government’.As to his real feelings, Crowley later claimed he was patriotic. ‘I still thinkthe English pot as black as the kettle,’ he later confessed, ‘and I am stillwilling to die in defence of the pot.’ Even today, nobody is completely certainif that was true or just how far he was willing to bend his own beliefs in theemploy of a country that soon turned against him.images [images/icon.jpg]With the cessation of hostilities in November 1918 came the most potent myth ofall: that there had been a ‘stab in the back’ of the kaiser’s forces by theDeutsches Volk. And, for good measure, claimed Field Marshal Ludendorff himself,it was even more insidious than that. German troops had also been hypnotised bypropaganda, ‘the traditional British weapon’, as he described it to anyone whowould listen.And so, as Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke aptly explained, Adolf Hitler was‘born’ in Versailles. By blaming Germany’s defeat on such a spiritual malaise,the stage was set for the rise of Nazism and rearmament. The roots of thesubsequent global conflagration came with the unrelenting harshness of theVersailles Treaty, a travesty which directly inspired the excesses of the Naziregime. Adolf Hitler’s motivation was always in ‘tearing the treaty to shreds’.Yet this myth of the stab in the back was nothing compared to one which was, ifpossible, even more pervasive. It would soon come to occupy the mindset of the‘golden pheasants’, the leaders of the Nazi regime: that of the insidiousinfluence of the British Secret Service, which continues today with its supposedinvolvement in the death of Princess Diana or its Machiavellian posturing whichled to the recent invasion of Iraq.The Nazi leaders held an unshakeable belief in the malign, mysterious powers ofthe British Secret Service on a level that matched the occult. Associated withboth came vast skeins of intrigue and mystery which would see the creation of awhole new set of inter-related myths. In the early twenties, a prominentastrologer was sent details of Adolf Hitler’s birth, after which the otherwiseobscure political leader was revealed to be ‘a fearless man of action’ who was‘fated to sacrifice himself for the German nation’.And that was when all the trouble started.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 Dr Dee’s occultic background is often at odds with his range of remarkablescientific achievements. John Dee confounds us today for he was – especially inthe years immediately after his death – viewed as a charlatan. That he was alsoan ‘intelligencer’ for Walsingham there is little doubt. John Dee wasextraordinarily well placed to know what was happening around 1580s Europe,through which he could freely travel. It may well be that the magician’s oftenapocalyptic pronouncements about plague and pestilence which he placed in theears of foreign monarchs were one of the world’s first disinformation campaigns.2 In a survey of intelligence lessons from the Great War, a somewhat tartwrite-up comes in TNA ADM 223/479 ‘Naval Intelligence Organisation – Based on anhistorical analysis of the 1914–1918 war’. On page 7, the reader is referred toLe Queux. ‘The atmosphere is melodramatic. The ingredients are spies,adventuresses, dark alleys, passwords and crime. An Intelligence Official, likethe “Secret Service Agents” of romance is something between a bandit and adetective. He is conceived as a sinister figure, in a slouch hat and cloak,armed to the teeth – a desperate fellow with a shady past and a lurid future.Such was the popular view. But it was only an exaggeration of the officialconception.’3 In several estimations, Malcolm Muggeridge was hardly a great asset to MI6despite his vivid memoirs of his time in Lourenço Marques – now known as Maputo– in which he played up his own attempts at Bondish roguery – philandering,drinking himself silly and loafing. He was, in several colleagues’ estimation, afailure; ‘quite useless’ (Hugh Trevor-Roper), ‘a bit of a flop’ (Graham Greene).In another contemporary estimation, although quick-witted, Muggeridge was ‘quiteirresponsible in action: he is unable to think out the steps of an operation andits probable results’ (HS 3/84, note 25 May 1943). See also E.D.R. Harrison,‘Something beautiful for C’ in War, Resistance and Intelligence, Essays inhonour of M.R.D. Foot (Pen and Sword, 1999).4 The first author to articulate the mood at the début du siècle was arguablythe best. Erskine Childers’ The Riddle of The Sands tells the story of twoessential duffers who somehow manage to foil a sinister German plot to invadeEastern England (discussed later in Chapter 10, p. 281). Childers, at that timea young clerk at the House of Commons, was an accomplished yachtsman who hadmade a number of journeys through the foggy, sand-banked Frisian Islands. Itgave him the germ of an idea for his pair of heroes – a man from the ForeignOffice and his sidekick – who come across a number of small boats. Eventuallythey realise that an invasion is planned when these boats will ‘traverse theNorth Sea and throw themselves bodily upon the English shore’. Childers alsomoored his boat at Bursledon, where Mansfield Cumming was based at around thesame time. There is no evidence that they ever met but it is certainly possiblethat they would have known each other, if only from each other’s reputations inthe local community.5 Very few point out that Adolf Hitler had found a more than obvious way ofavoiding the cold and that he had bankrupted himself by attending variousWagnerian operas. Such musical extravagances provided the soundtrack to hisself-inflicted fantasy of heroic suffering that was later incubated in MeinKampf and other writings. Ostracism, it could be argued, defined the young AdolfHitler.6 James Herbert made use of supernatural plots and, as he said at the time,made horror accessible by writing about the working class. ‘The great advantageof my field is that you can always go way over the top if you’re in danger ofgetting bored,’ Herbert noted. He claimed to have torn the horror genre from thegrip of the bourgeoisie and ‘upper-middle-class writers like Dennis Wheatley’.7 Almost inevitably, some now suggest that American soldiers may not havefound THE Spear at all for the good reason (sic) there has been no subsequentAnschluss. As a result, a spate of modern occultic apologists suggest that whatwas found beneath the ruins of Nuremberg by US troops in 1945 was some sort ofelaborate copy. In this version of the story, The Spear which was rightfullyreturned to Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches’ Museum is nothing but an elaborateforgery. The Americans forged it – the reasoning goes – so they could keep thepower of the real Spear for themselves. Or alternatively, there are theoriesthat escaping Nazis took the original spear to the South Pole or South Americavia U-boat. Quite!8 The balance between operations and intelligence is an importantdistinction, the cause of much confusion in the historical record. Originally,the Security Service was known as MO5, the O standing for Operations. But in1915, Lord Kitchener rearranged the structure of the War Office and created aseparate Military Intelligence organisation that was divorced from operations.Cumming’s organisation became known as MI1(c) while MO5 became MI5. For sake ofclarity, the later variant, MI6, is used throughout this narrative.9 According to the autobiography of Valentine Williams, an MI6 officer whoserved under Cumming, C once told his staff that he intended to publish hismemoirs, The Indiscretions of a Secret Service Chief. ‘It will be asplendid-looking publication bound in red with the title and my name embossed ingold and consisting of 400 pages – every one of which will be blank’ (p. 338,The World of Action, Houghton Mifflin, 1938).10 Crowley, it should be noted, was revered in his lifetime by an admittedlysmall number of people who recognised the seriousness with which he studied theoccult. The fact that he was vociferous in his opposition to the norms ofChristianity meant that he became an easy target for what would be called ‘theyellow press’, particularly in the years after the war. In that sense, he was atrue original as he himself liked to claim. Crowley was a libertarian bohemianwhose philosophical outlook in combining sex with spirituality, humour as wellas mockery managed to upset many people from all walks of life.11 The first airing of this unlikely, but actually partly true story came fromSir Compton Mackenzie in the third volume of his autobiographical writings,Greek Memories (Cassell, 1932). Mackenzie, most famous for the book WhiskyGalore, became a thorn in the side for the intelligence establishment. He wasthe first author to refer to Cumming as the mysterious ‘C’, thereby creating theaura of invincibility to the anonymous secret servant whom those inclined toconspiracy thought was pulling the strings behind the power in the land. Like somany other writers, in his later life Mackenzie mercilessly poked fun at theidea of spying and was later charged with a breach of the Official Secrets Act.He satirised both MI5 and MI6 in Water on The Brain, describing how the twoagencies spent all their time spying on each other. In the introduction to alater, post-war edition, Mackenzie tartly points out, ‘during the Second WorldWar many more people discovered that those responsible for Secret Intelligence[do] behave like characters created by the Marx brothers’ (it is no accidentthat the writer claimed Duck Soup was his favourite film).12 C’s bureaucratic skills would be used to discourage the BritishExpeditionary Force – the army in France – from wanting to set up its ownespionage networks. Understandably, the War Office wanted to subsume Cumming’swork within that new effort. ‘This argument did not sit well with Cumming whoregretted his dimunition of his independence,’ notes today’s official MI6website ( ‘SIS or MI6 – What’s in a name?’, www.sis.gov.uk[http://www.sis.gov.uk]) ‘As a naval officer, he was less than pleased atappearing under the auspices of the War Office.’13 The ‘creole’ woman (as she is referred to in various files, TNA KV 2/2) bornMargareta Gertruda Zelle was the original Desperate Housewife. Better known asMata Hari, the reality of her life is much more mundane than the legends whichhave accumulated in her wake. By the time of the Great War, she was the boredspouse of a Dutch Army officer who, approaching her 40s, fell on hard times andturned to espionage to gain money and alleviate her boredom more than anythingelse. Born in Holland, she became an exotic dancer, her faintly erotic past as atemple dancer in Java becoming one of the first myths she created for herself.Performing on stage and in private performances, Mata Hari travelled aroundEurope during the Great War – where she often stripped with coiled snakes –beguiling audiences with her charms, picking up lovers, duping some and livingthe life of a prototypical femme fatale: deceit, high living, an earthysexuality for sale to the highest bidder. An overwhelming sense of doom suffusedher activities as a secret agent, which were hardly earth-shattering. When theofficial MI5 files on her case were released in 1999 (KV 2/1), they provedanaemic, anti-climactic and more than a little pedestrian. Most Alliedintelligence agencies had latched on to her thanks to contemporaneous newspaperclippings.At various times, Mata Hari had the distinction of coming under the suspicion ofthe French, British and German intelligence services, often all at the sametime. In 1917, the French had her arrested after she had taken a German lover inSpain. Mrs Zelle was later tried and found guilty of aiding and abetting theenemy. Strangely, she never denied what she had done, only the motivation. MataHari was shot on 15 October 1917, at the age of 41. There was never anyunequivocally incriminating evidence against her. Three decades later, one ofher French prosecutors admitted that ‘there wasn’t enough evidence to flog acat’. As her most recent biographer notes, her greatest crime was independence,wealth and ‘she admitted to having a lover. Women like that were immoral and notto be trusted’ (Pat Shipman, Femme Fatale: Love, Lies, and the Unknown Life ofMata Hari, Harper Perennial, 2008).14 Roger Casement had been highly decorated for his pioneering work in humanrights – particularly abuses in the Congo and Peru – for which he was eventuallyknighted. But in 1913, he resigned from the Consular Service to become aself-appointed ambassador to the Irish state. Campaigning for its freedom, hetravelled to America on the outbreak of war and thence to Germany to promote thecause of Irish separatism. After attempting to recruit Irish prisoners of war toform an Irish brigade and obtain weapons, he was dispatched by GermanIntelligence by U-boat just before the Easter Uprising of 1916. Subsequentlyarrested on charges of treason, sabotage and espionage, Casement’s trial wasenlivened by the unseen hand of British Intelligence. Photographs of a diary –known as the Black Diary because of its binding – were surreptitiously shown tothose who had been campaigning for his death sentence to be commuted. Casementwas hanged at Pentonville Prison on 3 August 1916. His files may be found in KV2/9."},{"pageContent":"2HIGHER AUTHORITIES [contents.htm#a5]The supposition that Hitler believed in astrology and employed astrologers wascurrent from 1933 onwards. It is clear that many thought that the only possibleexplanation for his uninterrupted and increasingly threatening run of politicalsuccesses and territorial gains was his access to advance information obtainedby paranormal means, of which astrology was the most likely.Astrology and the Third Reich, Ellic HoweThat the Nazis did not use magic – either white or black – in the prosecution ofwar is, in some estimations, one of modern history’s more enduring puzzles. The‘golden pheasants’, as the Nazi leaders were known by the man in the street, hadmany strange, often contradictory obsessions with both mysticism and the occult.This supposed predisposition to all manner of mysticism forms a strange backdropto the rise of Nazism. Various mystical pronouncements supposedly provide aparticular (not to say peculiar) explanation for its successes.There was, however, no black magic to guide the men in black shirts.To paraphrase Mark Twain, rumours of an astrologer were greatly exaggerated andso, too, were the supposed occultic roots of Nazism. Though a number ofhistorians have argued that the whole basis of National Socialism stemmed fromthe almost occult-like Thule Society, which in both its anti-Semitic andanti-Communist roots appealed to the Nazi leadership, the reality was less clearcut.1 As Michael Burleigh has elegantly diagnosed, the German people took to apolitics based on ‘faith, hope, hatred and sentimental collective self-regardfor their own race and nation’.The supernatural provided an immeasurably better explanation for theFatherland’s loss of face and the post-Versailles malaise in which a once-proudnation found itself. The occult helped alleviate much of the pain of theZeitgeist. It was so much easier to blame the social and economic woes of theWeimar Republic on malign forces beyond their control. At the same time as AdolfHitler’s rise, Germany’s best-known mediums and card readers were able to filllarge concert halls for their demonstrations. Immediately after the Armistice,many educated Germans seriously started to believe in the supernatural.Astrology, hypnosis, clairvoyancy, tarot readings, palmistry and fortune tellingwould all reach their apotheosis in the Weimar Republic. So, too, would‘criminal telepaths’, clairvoyants consulted by the police to shed light onunsolved crimes.Healers, seers and prophets proliferated. A champagne-maker became famous forprophesying the apocalypse and that the only way to stop it was by penance.‘They were all around, these people promising the messiah, all of them togethercreated a mood from which Hitler could arise,’ noted one journalist. And, as aresult, a rabble-rouser from Bavaria was hardly out of place. ‘I believe that itwas also God’s will that from here a boy was to be sent into the Reich, allowedto mature, and elevated to become the nation’s Führer, thus enabling him toreintegrate his homeland into the Reich,’ Adolf Hitler would famously declarejust after the Anschluss. ‘There is a divine will, and we are its instruments.’Worse, Hitler saw himself – as did his many followers – as a magical figure ofsupposed wisdom and oracular power. He would, he claimed, deliver the Germanpeople from the humiliations of Versailles, leading them into a glorious future.Indeed, his self-belief became maniacal and his messianic fervour the source ofhis personal power. Adolf Hitler found a willing audience amongst the rancour,defeat and desperation of the Weimar Republic. And yet for all his railingagainst religion, especially ones based in Jewish traditions, on one occasion,at a Nazi Christmas celebration in 1927,2 he would roar: ‘The work that Christstarted but could not finish, I – Adolf Hitler – will conclude.’ A true warningfrom history that stands as one of the more astonishing.images [images/icon.jpg]In the years immediately following the Great War, when young boys eagerlydevoured the fictional exploits of Bulldog Drummond and Allan Quartermain, thegrowing reputation of the British Secret Service was never higher. Its aura ofinvincibility and invulnerability was unmatched. The ironic truth was thatMansfield Cumming’s secret service was actually fraying at the seams, generallydisbelieved and underfunded. In short, MI6 soon developed a terrible reputationand – worst of all – was irrelevant to the business of government it was chargedto serve.In some ways, MI6 had become a victim of its own success during the First WorldWar. With the arrival of peace, the scope of officially sanctioned espionagequickly became superfluous to requirements. It was suggested that Cumming’sdepartment should be absorbed into one or more of the existing intelligencedepartments. MI6 was little more than organised chaos on which C seemed tothrive. Tales from this time are enlivened with reports of Cumming descendingstairs on his behind or else negotiating corners on a children’s wheeled toy.Today’s service acknowledges that with a staff group called Scooter forhandicapped officers, which refers to ‘the mode of transport Cumming used to getaround the building after he had lost his foot’, in the words of the current C.With the end of the fighting, there was another mysterious organisation whichgenuinely seemed every bit as dangerous as the occult and equally malign as theforces of the devil. The Secret Intelligence Service would now becomepreoccupied with combatting the menace of Soviet communism. It was Lenin’savowed intention, via the Comintern, to bring change and wage revolutionthroughout the rest of world. So the inter-war years for MI6 involved itspreoccupation with undermining Lenin’s revolutionaries, which involved many ofthe swashbucklers who established the secret service’s reputation for derring-doand buccaneering. Various ‘aces’ such as Reilly,3 Dukes and Hill were sent tothe Soviet Union. There they established networks to encourage subversion, fundsabotage and stop the Red Menace in all its ugly manifestations by attempting toassassinate the Soviet leaders.The most potent example was the remarkable Sidney Reilly, who had once plottedto kill Lenin and termed the phrase ‘occult octopus’ as a figure of speech,referring to the worldwide spread of capitalism. Many myths have emerged fromthis time which, as the former intelligence chief Alan Judd has written,‘undoubtedly contributed to the Great Game element of MI6 mythology in which thespy is not only a discreet seller of information but also a man of adventurousaction’.For one man, though, those adventures were virtually over. The greater truth wasthat Mansfield Cumming was worn out (‘C later became a martyr to angina,’ onecontemporary recorded). Now in his 60s, he had fought hard to ensure the agencyhe had founded was autonomous and independent. At a farewell dinner wherevarious people eulogised him, as one attendee recorded, Cumming’s reply wasbittersweet: ‘You have come to bury C, sir, not to praise him.’ According to thelegend which persists today within the Secret Intelligence Service, his heartgave out on the evening of 23 June 1923 after he had shared a drink with anagent who was about to head off on a mission abroad. Years later, when thesixteenth chief came to venerate and eulogise what he termed a Victorianpredecessor, he got it about right when he said that Cumming was simply a hardact to follow.images [images/icon.jpg]The curious irony was that astrology had got off to a rip-roaring start inpromoting the Nazi cause. In 1923 there was an astrologers’ congress in Leipzig,where it was suggested that if their subject was to be taken seriously, aCentral Astrological Office should be formed, and, in time, a new monthlyastrological magazine was published as an official organ. At its helm was thefirst professional astrologer in Germany, Frau Elsbeth Ebertin, who, after beingsent details of Adolf Hitler’s birth, published a chart which showed the futureFührer to be not only a fearless leader but a man of action who was ‘fated tosacrifice himself for the German nation’.Frau Ebertin, whose main claim to fame was her editing of an astrological annualcalled A Glimpse Into The Future, went even further, suggesting in that July’sissue that the ‘man of action’ born on 20 April 1889 should not undertakeanything of importance in November. ‘What on Earth have women and the stars todo with me?’ was, however, Adolf Hitler’s perplexed response when Frau Ebertin’sprediction was brought to his attention.On 8 November 1923 he was arrested after the Munich Putsch, an event which wouldhave much significance, ‘the last desperate gamble of a man’, in one historian’sestimation, ‘who feared he was being deserted by his fellow conspirators’. Itfailed and so Adolf Hitler was thrown into prison for nine months for treason,where he wrote his own wrong-headed ‘masterwork’, Mein Kampf.Almost overnight, Elsbeth Ebertin and her horoscope became a sensation. Like allpoliticians, Hitler was astute enough to see through such bread and circuses forthe masses – for now, at any rate, encouraged – not least in predictions made inhis favour. Fortune telling had become so much part of the Zeitgeist that by theend of the 1920s, Weimar Germany was overwhelmed with spiritual activity. Berlinhad become the capital of the occult world. There were seven astrologicalweeklies, along with more than 20,000 fortune tellers, astrologers, tarotreaders and seers, ranging from quacks to ‘bizarrely costumed leaders of secretbrotherhoods and doomsday religious cults’. Small wonder that leaders, who wereseen as cranks, became so ubiquitous and gained credibility in those worrisometimes when the end of the world did not seem so very far away.images [images/icon.jpg]Irrational, sinister forces were sensed everywhere and, in these troubled times,no more acutely than in the unnerving stare of the former Director of NavalIntelligence. After the war, Reggie ‘Blinker’ Hall became convinced about thedangers of Bolshevism, and like so many others of his class and standing, becameinvolved in various intrigues using his old intelligence connections. Hall hadwanted to continue as DNI, but in pursuing a political career, for obviousreasons, had been forced to resign. Being Reggie, he threw himself bodily intosubversion, particularly after losing his seat in the House of Commons to thegrowing Labour Party. The government needed to strengthen its domesticsurveillance and ability to look at troublemakers who were part of the socialistmenace.So far as he and many others were concerned, MI5 was hardly up to the task. Thegloriously anachronistic figure of the General – as Vernon Kell was usuallyknown – was in one estimation ‘short-sighted and timorous’. As with MI6, thepeace dividend saw MI5’s budgets cut back and, as its official history notes,over the next six years Kell had to fight to keep his organisation alive.4 TheSecurity Service, as it was later formally christened, was decimated, its staffnumbers reduced from 800 to 30 and its budget slashed by nearly two-thirds.It was hardly a crackerjack operation, and for Kell personally the greater fearwas of amalgamation. It hardly helped that the General’s gaze never seemed toreach beyond military or well-bred personnel – truly pukka chaps, given thatmany were retired from the Indian Police – supported by either private incomesor drawing upon pensions drawn from the flickering embers of the Raj.Yet Bolshevik subversion was a potent clear and present danger. The fear of redcommunism would inform its greatest pre-war success in the ARCOS raid in May1927, which involved 150 police officers breaking up a Soviet spy ring,5 afterwhich diplomatic relations were broken with the USSR. As his organisation hadbeen wound down, Kell had little choice but to rely on operators from variousprivate organisations. And that included some of the stranger coves who alsoexisted in the murky, strange overlap of state and far right intelligencegroups. Any number of curious, private intelligence organisations had come intobeing, with none as shadowy as the Makgill Organisation.Sir George Makgill was a writer, businessman and fervent right-winger who stoodas a candidate in the early 1920s for the Anti-Waste League. During the FirstWorld War he had been involved in a court case where a servant felt he had beenslandered, and later still, head of the Anti-German Union, which famously hadled to the expulsion from the Privy Council of two lawyers who did not haveBritish parents. By 1917, he was listed in the London telephone book as beingHonorary Secretary of the British Empire Union.The organisation he set up in the early twenties, with backing from variouscaptains of the coal, mining and ship-owning industries, was described by Kellas secret: ‘somewhat on Masonic lines’. The Makgill Organisation had thedistinct advantage of being disavowed by official sources. Its aim was to rootout subversive influences such as anarchists, communists, Fenians and, from someof the surviving notes, people they didn’t like the look of.Small wonder that secret societies and extreme politics seemed to go in hand inhand: the question is simply one of how far their tendrils extended? From thisremove, it does seem curious that many who were interested in the occult somehowconverged in cabals of right-wing intrigue. Conspiracies do not thrive in avacuum and communism became a potent bogeyman. But of especial note to thisstory, in one account, Makgill ‘also devoted a considerable amount of timeunmasking the cult of evil of which Aleister Crowley, alias “The Beast” was thecentre’. This apparently, concerned an international traffic in drugs, women,children and blackmail, the result of the most notorious phase of the Beast’slife upon which much of his subsequent reputation falls.images [images/icon.jpg]When Aleister Crowley returned home from New York in 1919, he arrived with a newmistress, failing health but a renewed dedication to the cult of Thelema. Andfor that he travelled all over Europe, trying to drum up support, having used upmost of his inheritance. To make ends meet, he wrote The Diaries of a Drug Fiendin twenty-seven days, a kind of Trainspotting du jour, for he had beenprescribed heroin by a doctor for his various ailments, asthma the mostprominent. To say his writing was obscure would be an understatement, for in onereview it was dismissed as ‘a phantasmagoria of ecstasies, despairs and aboveall, verbiage’.The diaries provided more unwelcome publicity and a campaign began against himby some of the more censorious journalists of the day in the rabid tabloid JohnBull. His wartime pronouncements against Britain, however well intentioned, werenot forgotten. So began a new chapter of wanderings. Crowley was determined toestablish a monastic, liberated community for all his followers. By April 1920they had congregated at a hilltop in Cefalù on Sicily where, in an oblongfarmhouse, he established the Abbey of Thelema. Better known as Villa SantaBarbara, it became notorious as a kind of glorified crack den for his initiates.Everywhere you looked was a mess. The paraphernalia of drug use and magickcoexisted with a staggering lack of sanitary facilities. Crowley and hisfollowers regularly imbibed cocaine, opium and heroin, and lived in a junkie’sparadise. Even one of the dogs that was adopted as a pet was called Satan. Somany rumours evolved from this time that they took on a life of their own.Drug-induced orgies and debauchery were so prevalent that one reviewer ofCrowley’s life later noted in mockery: ‘He had sacrificed a goat to a youth – orwas it only a youth to a goat?’And there grew another rumour that during another ceremony a baby disappeared.‘Children under ten, whom the Beast keeps at his “abbey”,’ records anothercontemporary chronicle of the gothic horror to be found there, ‘are made towitness sexually debauches unbelievably revolting. Filthy incense is burned andcakes made of goats’ blood and honey are consumed in the window-less rim wherethe Beast conducts his rites.’For the rest of his time in Sicily, Crowley went rock and hill climbing, tryingto portray himself as at peace – thanks to his sex magick – with himself. ‘Icare nothing for public opinion,’ he wearily declared. ‘I care nothing for fameor success. I am perfectly happy in my retirement.’ And that peace might havecontinued had it not been for a twice-divorced artist’s model called Betty May.She wouldn’t be the first spouse of someone else to come under the Beast’sspell. Yet all along, from when he first answered a door in a kilt with make-upand black wig, she felt uneasy in Aleister Crowley’s company.It was reciprocated in full by the Great Beast.In the events which followed, Betty May was hardly an innocent. She had beenpart of a criminal gang and was called Tiger Woman because of her fierce, felinenature (and looks). Yet all that was behind her when she and her husband, abeautiful spirit ten years her junior, turned up in Cefalù in the autumn of1922. Frederick Loveday was enchanted by Crowley’s spell. A bohemian who calledhimself Raoul, he too existed on a surfeit of hedonism, self-indulgence andthrill seeking. Aleister Crowley was besotted, terming him ‘extraordinary’, afascination that was reciprocated in full.Over the winter, the atmosphere at the Abbey of Thelema turned ugly. As well asthe drugs, Crowley lay down the law. Any infraction of his word was treated withenforced self-mutilation. Many of his magick rituals seemed to involve feastingon various offals, like black pudding made from goat’s blood. Worse was to comeearly the next year when a cat was ritually sacrificed when Crowley announced itwas an evil spirit. When the poor animal was brought into the ceremony, it spatand hissed. In the most popular story of what happened next, Raoul Loveday slitits throat, which sprayed blood everywhere. Shortly afterwards he became ill(though others suggest it was because of unhygienic drinking of water).Either way, Loveday died shortly thereafter from gastroenteritis. His wife hadher revenge. All hell broke loose.There was nothing like a bit of devil fighting for a newspaper on the Sabbath.So it came in February 1923 with an exclusive in the Sunday Express. ‘MoreSinister Revelations of Aleister Crowley. Varsity Lad’s Death. Dreadful Ordealof Young Wife.’ It told the harrowing story of ‘the girl-wife’ who was leftalone to fight the Beast: ‘Since she defied him in every way and managed to keepherself clear of the bestialities of the house, he turned her out into thenight.’All this turned Crowley from a mild curiosity into public enemy number one – theman everyone loved to hate – and the infamy he had always craved was suddenlyupon him. The Great Beast was stunned. In his own mind he was a great leader andgreat man, not a sinister pantomime villain. Soon he came to the attention ofanother with political pretensions. Benito Mussolini, like most Italians, hadgood reason to fear secret societies, not least the Freemasons, who weredecidedly anti-fascistic.The fascist leader had Crowley booted out of the country, whereafter hecommenced his wanderings. Yet for all the tabloid vilification, Crowley hadbecome more of a pathetic figure. One Englishman who caught up with him a fewmonths later found him a large man of 47, inclined to corpulence and a sallowcomplexion. ‘His manner was peculiar and he had a slight cockney accent.’ He was‘disappointingly unsinister’, and in time many also changed their opinion.Aleister Crowley was, in this fellow Englishman’s estimation, ‘a very sillyman’. And, for all the vilification that was meted out, a later review of thistime of the Great Beast’s life – even allowing for some latent misogyny – getsit about right when it asks, ‘in a period defined by the authentic evil of theSS and Ogpu, can we be expected to shudder at Crowley’s unhygienic carryings-onwith loose and hysterical women?’images [images/icon.jpg]After Mansfield Cumming’s demise that same year of 1923, MI6 remainedunderfunded and understaffed, its expertise stretched too thinly. It was unlovedtoo, for useful information was hardly forthcoming. Whitehall awarded it such aslender budget that most of its agents couldn’t afford to use wireless sets.Lack of money also meant downsizing its staff, generally perceived as amateurswho were highly dependent on voluntary assistance, which could be fitted into asingle house off Kensington High Street, on Melbury Road.But not all at the same time. When officers unexpectedly returned from overseas,C’s own secretary had to be temporarily accommodated in the greenhouse outside.Perhaps this explained why the location of the house wasn’t exactly a statesecret. When the new chief arrived at the Kensington house in 1923, he asked apassing milkman who lived at this apparently quiet residential mansion.‘The secret service,’ was his reply.With this temporary move to Melbury Road, MI6 hoped for greater prosperity. Anew broom was needed and after Cumming’s demise it arrived in the resplendentform of another naval officer who, despite superficial similarities, was cutfrom a very different kind of cloth. After replacing Reggie Hall as Director ofNaval Intelligence, Admiral Hugh Sinclair was well regarded, loyal and fair tohis staff – ‘a good team captain’ in a recent assessment – whose charisma anddynamism often worked against him.A nice, eminently clubbable fellow who revelled in a nickname from a play about‘the wickedest man in London’, Sinclair called himself ‘Quex’ because of theraffish associations with Sir Arthur Pinero’s The Gay Lord Quex. Though laterdismissed as ‘a thoroughly unorthodox and somewhat arbitrary commander’ by one,to most of his staff, the new C was always a pleasant, paternal figure. For thecaricaturist, Sinclair was yet another gift: ‘the little man with the face of afaintly surprised frog’ in one estimation.In many ways, Quex Sinclair would not have been out of place in a drawing roomcomedy. One visitor recalled having to enter via the tradesman’s entrancethrough a bathroom with lavatory pans, and entered an inner sanctum that was‘out of this world’. He recalled a table on which was a mother-of-pearl handledpistol, a cigar box and a deep Turkish carpet (‘that you nearly got lost in’),and a desk behind which sat the squat figure of the chief himself.Another officer would recall being asked to see him as very much in the style of007 being called in by M:As the Admiral got up from behind his large carved mahogany desk to greet me, Isaw a rather short stocky figure with the welcoming smile of a benign uncle. Hishandshake was as gentle as his voice, and only the very alert dark eyes gave ahint of the tough personality that lay beneath the mild exterior.At this remove, the second chief of Her Majesty’s Secret Service seems yetanother incongruous choice, for Quex Sinclair also seemed to delight in takingevery opportunity to draw attention to himself. The new C sped around thecapital in an ancient Lancia touring car, sometimes wearing a hat too small forhis head, often with shoes that didn’t match his suits. A bon vivant (with alarge crocodile-skin case containing a hundred cigars somewhere to hand)paradoxically, Sinclair wanted to reform and modernise the service. Today, histime in office is overshadowed by a murky episode involving a forged documentwhich led to the collapse of the first Labour government in 1924.The Zinoviev letter,6 supporting a call to agitprop by the president of theComintern, was most likely forged by serving intelligence officials. BlinkerHall, by now the Union MP for Eastbourne, as well as the serving heads of MI5and MI6, Kell and Sinclair, were involved in handing the letter to the DailyMail. Widely seen as a triumph of the Occult Octopus and the shady right-wingelements who passed the letter on, it would lead to suspicions of conspiraciesby those on the left for years to come. In this case, as the former ForeignOffice archivist who looked into the matter termed it, the result of a ‘very,very incestuous circle’ of a conservative elite network which populated theintelligence world.Early the next year, the Secret Intelligence Service moved to Broadway Buildingsclose to St James and hard by Parliament Square, thereby relieving some of thepressure in having to house staff in the greenhouse. More than that, it wasagreeably symbolic, for the new C would now be nearer to the seat of power.Though he was rather more visible in Whitehall than his predecessor, it was saidQuex Sinclair ‘spent most afternoons at tea time quaffing brandy and soda underthe great portrait of Nell Gwynne’ at his club.The problem was that the service was facing the wrong way and spent too muchtime staring off the Soviet bogeyman. Quex Sinclair was a dedicatedanti-Bolshevist. He would dismiss the Nazi threat almost until it was almost toolate, viewing it through an unappealing prism of anti-Semitism. C thought thatreports of Germany’s aggressiveness was a specious claim ‘put forward by Jewsand Bolshevists for their own ends’. Only too late did MI6 realise the extent ofthe menace of Adolf Hitler, for, as a recruit to its Air Section in 1929 wouldlater write, attention to the Nazi Party was small and ‘official minds seemed toshrug the matter off as just another political party of little consequence’.images [images/icon.jpg]It is perhaps significant that in April 1930, Aleister Crowley had settled, forthe moment, in Weimar Berlin. He fetched up with a new ‘scarlet woman’ andexhibited his paintings, but for someone who was supposedly skint, he generallybehaved with his usual breezy self-indulgence. A singular question remains aboutthis period of his life: was he in the employ of intelligence? In the earlythirties, he was possibly an informant for Britain in Weimar Germany, but histime there, on the available evidence, was more to allow him to spend time withStephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood searching out male prostitutes.But as Richard Spence has pointed out, occult assemblies provided the perfectcover for recruitment, and by now he had become a leading light in the Order ofthe Oriental Templars (Ordo Templi Orientis, or OTO). In this regard, it alwaysseemed odd that Crowley had met one of the order’s founders, Theodor Reuss, inpre-war London. The circumstances prompted Peter Quennell to note that Crowleyhappened to meet a mysterious stranger ‘with prim pince-nez and handle-barmoustache, who one night appeared in Victoria Street, bearing the salutations ofa powerful society of German seekers after the occult, and who turned out to bein his spare time, an agent of the German secret service’.Subsequently, Crowley and Reuss had corresponded, and when the German leader ofthe OTO subsequently suffered a stroke, Crowley sensed an opportunity. WhenReuss died in October 1923, Crowley claimed he was the natural heir to lead theTemplars.The fact an Englishman would now aim to be in charge hardly went down well inWeimar Berlin. It led to a chaotic Leadership Conference of Grand Masters in thesummer of 1925 during his first visit to Germany. The result was that, as withall sects, it split and Crowley had to settle for running a diminished offshoot.In his later writings, Crowley confessed that he also met Hitler’s fellowconspirator, General Ludendorff, with whom they had a discussion on ‘Nordictheology’. Crowley later claimed it was his suggestion to adapt the swastika forthe growing political movement.And then came what was known as l’affaire Crowley, for in one French newspaperaccount, the Beast had ‘been proven to be a secret agent in the service ofGermany’. By the spring of 1929, he was living in some comfort in Paris, hadresumed his writing (his masterwork Magick In Theory And Practice was theresult) and had a new wife in the form of a voodoo princess from Nicaragua.Suddenly that April, without warning, the French authorities kicked him out on‘moral grounds’.Nobody ever got to the bottom of what really went on. But why, as Richard Spenceasks, would the Germans have ever employed someone who had worked against themin the Great War? As one of the leading Weimar spymasters noted, ‘the full valueof a secret service depends on the number and standard of double agents’. Somesuggest Crowley may well have been spying on the communists. A couple of yearslater he had a lodger called Gerald Hamilton, who had been a friend of Sir RogerCasement, and was also a German spy and communist.Around this time, in several accounts, Crowley became a part-time informant forthe British, for he met a man with intelligence connections whom some believewas his handler. And, as prophesised in The Book of The Law, he was the rich manfrom the west, a charming old Etonian called Gerald Yorke, who soon becameCrowley’s business manager, helping promote the cause of his beliefs. Yorke hadan intriguing background as a journalist in the Far East and had suspectedconnections with MI6.As the Nazi party rose to power, it is easy to see why Crowley would be a personof interest to British Intelligence. In the early thirties, one of the Beast’sGerman devotees, Martha Küntzel, had sent Adolf Hitler a copy of The Book of TheLaw, suspecting the German leader’s supposed interest in the occult. Some haveclaimed that the Führer was a devotee of the beast, but within a year of comingto power he had banned most of the organisations of which Crowley was a member.Yet as Gerald Yorke noted, there are similarities between The Book Of The Lawand Mein Kampf. Both are, at some level, Nietzschean rants, and in his variousdrugged states, Crowley had some very odd dreams: in one, the Führer made allhis books compulsory reading in Germany, while in another, Crowley was runningGermany on Hitler’s behalf. Magickal philosophy was the ultimate in the triumphof the will.Rather than welcome him, as some have suggested, the Nazis did the worstpossible thing so far as he was concerned; they simply ignored him. And by thetime he fetched up back in London in 1932, he was penniless and still trying toattract attention. Crowley would joke in later years that ‘legend says that mydossier at Scotland Yard fills a whole room’, but there is little evidence tosupport this.Yet one thing remained unchanged. When a Daily Sketch reporter happened upon theGreat Beast around this time, he left no doubt for his readers how scary he was.It was the unwavering, hypnotic aspect of the eyes that continued to drawattention. ‘Crowley has an amazing appearance,’ the reporter noted, ‘when youfirst look into them [they] are literally terrifying. I hate to imagine whatthey must be like when he is not in a benevolent mood.’images [images/icon.jpg]It was another pair of eyes that were equally terrifying.They were of such an unwavering, cold blue intensity that when a former GreatWar pilot looked straight into them in pre-war Berlin, they struck him as beingakin to those of a dead cod. The words that accompanied his staring werestartling in their other worldliness. ‘There should be only three major powersin the world,’ the Führer flatly declared. ‘The British Empire, the Americas andthe Germanic Empire of the future.’The ice was broken when the Englishman acknowledged that he was not bitter forhaving endured eighteen months as a prisoner of war. They were soon chattingaway like old pals, not least when the Nazi leader became het up about thedangers of communism. And given that his visitor was head of the MI6 AirSection, there was at least some common ground in their discussion.Squadron Leader Freddie Winterbotham had been restless when asked by the DeputyChief of Air Staff to join the secret service. An old Carthusian, he had beenshot down after a dogfight in the First World War and was finding the work ofbeing a pedigree stockbreeder uninteresting. His arrival in MI6 was propitious.Winterbotham was posted to Berlin from 1933 to 1938, where he would witnessGerman rearmament first-hand. Though listed as a member of the Embassy AirStaff, his secret connections soon became well known to the Nazis.Winterbotham’s greatest source of information was a one-time Baltic baron calledWilliam de Ropp, who had worked as a journalist and by the start of the thirtieswas just about the only MI6 source within Germany. Ropp (or Code 821 as he wasknown) provided Winterbotham with details of the emerging Luftwaffe. The Nazis,though, were equally ignorant about the Royal Air Force. So Winterbotham wouldtrade information back and forth. As with much of the espionage world, it wasnever quite clear who was using the other to better advantage.The Nazis would soon refer to Winterbotham as ‘our English agent’, whose role,in one account, was ‘persuading people in Britain to see things the Nazi way’.Winterbotham had arrived in time for the Reichstag fire where, he wouldmemorably recall, the ‘writing was on all the walls, illuminated by theswastika’. One day he was met by Alfred Rosenberg, one of the principalarchitects of Nazi ideology, in full uniform, who astonished him by giving theNazi salute.While staying with de Ropp, Winterbotham was later taken to the Chancellery tomeet the Führer, an experience he vividly likened to entering ‘straight intoAlice’s Looking Glass land’. Within months, Winterbotham met virtually all theother leading Nazis and became aware of the full extent of German rearmament. Inthe face of official scepticism, he repeatedly briefed London on theself-evident expansion of the Luftwaffe. He was able to obtain photostats of itstraining ‘bible’ and went to visit some of the flying training schools.Yet nobody in Broadway Buildings wanted to know.‘I found a rather smug complacency within MI6,’ Freddie Winterbotham would laterrecall, ‘an attitude that was also common around Whitehall.’By now, the Secret Intelligence Service had made itself very unpopular over itsvery same estimates for the growing emergence of German air power. In May 1935,C himself threatened to resign when the prime minister made a misleadingstatement to the House about the extent of Nazi aerial rearmament. A secretcabinet enquiry vindicated Quex Sinclair’s estimates, though Stanley Baldwinsaved face by claiming that he, too, had been misled. The point was, dodgydossiers or not, C’s figures were accepted. Freddie Winterbotham would writethat this would be the turning point of his career as a secret servant and ahighlight for an increasingly embittered service. ‘We all had a drink in theAdmiral’s flat,’ he would recall.images [images/icon.jpg]Though some subsequently claimed the Führer had the devil at his side, it wasclear that Adolf Hitler had little need for supernatural forces in hisextraordinary rise to power. Resentment and the various prejudices of the daywere sufficient. Bolstered by what one historian called ‘the intellectualdetritus of centuries’, Hitler was a canny enough politician to invoke ancientsymbolism. Historically, the swastika had symbolised everything from good luckto fertility. The red, white and black of the SS uniforms were taken from thepriestly robes of the Manichean order, an occult-based religion. The skull andcrossbones symbolised the work of the devil and the SS lettering was based onthe Runic alphabet. In other words, death-fixated kitsch and sinistersentiments, though largely peripheral to the actual cause, represented its bestfoot forward.Other senior Nazis were equally shrewd enough to invoke ancient symbolism topitch politics to a largely superstitious Deutsches Volk. Hess and Himmler oftenconjured up the occult to support their more hare-brained schemes. ‘Göring isworried about the stars on his chest,’ Reinhard Heydrich once famously remarked,‘Himmler about those in his horoscopes.’ In 1935, Heinrich Himmler founded theAhnenerbe (Ancestral Research) branch of the SS, an academy where he couldindulge some of his nuttier fantasies. Indeed, the Reichsführer-SS was hooked.At various points in his life, Heinrich Himmler believed that he was areincarnated monarch, which no doubt prompted the Ahnenerbe to investigate theoccult origins of the Aryan race.Most famously, this involved the dispatch of an expedition to Tibet to look forthe fossils of giants. ‘The usual view of Himmler is that he was an ice-cold,cynical politician,’ one SS officer in his immediate circle crisply recalled.‘This view is almost certainly wrong. Himmler was a mystic.’Even Hitler viewed him as a crank, but a loyal one.In Wewelsburg, Heinrich Himmler established an SS School in an area ofWestphalia long associated with Saxon paganism. A training camp close by aseventeenth-century castle was built and was soon decorated with all sorts ofsigns and symbols, including one in an entrance hall akin to the shape of theSpear of Destiny, perhaps the starting point for some of the more curious myths.Every year at midnight on 2 July, some accounts suggest, Himmler held a ritualin the crypt at Quedlinburg Cathedral after a formal procession.It was there, in 1937, that he had had the bones of his namesake, King HeinrichI, reinterred. The Reichsführer-SS seriously believed he was the reincarnationof the king sometimes known as Henry the Fowler. Himmler, others have suggested,communicated with him in his sleep. Although this suggests Himmler was a truecrackpot, if anything, the deputy leader of the Third Reich was even nuttier.Rudolf Hess was susceptible to various ‘mad’ theories and surrounded himselfwith mystical mountebanks of varying degrees. ‘His was a Manichean universe inwhich the forces of good, the Aryan and particularly the German race, wereconstantly at war with those of evil, the Jews,’ writes the late historian HughTrevor-Roper, ‘and Hitler, to whom his loyalty was no less absolute, was notmerely a political leader but a Redeemer sent by Providence.’The Deputy Führer often slept under magnets to draw out any harmful substancesin close proximity, and routinely tested bedrooms with divining rods to ensureno underground waters could cast any lingering malevolence while he slept.Given all these flirtations with the mystical, it is hardly surprising that thenotion of Hitler having his own astrologer gained credence in the years beforethe outbreak of the Second World War. Increasingly thereafter, innumerablespurious accounts talk of an unknown éminence grise behind the scenes whoadvised and counselled him on the ways of the stars. Stranger still, BritishIntelligence had also come to realise that the Führer had appointed a new chiefof military intelligence who was a surprisingly sentimental fellow and, inLondon at least, some considered him a kind of Catholic mystic.images [images/icon.jpg]It was a salutary lesson for anyone interested in the occult in Nazi Germany tolearn what had happened to one of the few practitioners who had been allowedfree roam within the Führer’s inner circle. That Erik Jan Hanussen was Jewishadds a curious piquancy to his story, though, almost inevitably, within monthsof Hitler’s coming to power, he disappeared from view in mysteriouscircumstances. Hanussen had long since styled himself as the ‘Magician ofBerlin’, where he would routinely stage elaborate séances which – through astutetoadying and promotion – he made into a kind of must-see for any self-respectingNazi. Quite how he came into the orbit of the Nazi leadership, and even when,have been the subject for much debate.Before the election of 1933, Adolf Hitler called in the Viennese-born Hanussen,who had already predicted that he would become Führer. In one, admittedlyfebrile account, the politician came to visit him and fell into a trance. ‘I seevictory for you,’ the seer said. ‘It cannot be stopped.’ So the man born HermannSteinschneider was allowed to help the man sometimes wrongly identified as AdolfSchicklgruber.In his youth, he had become a hypnotist, seer and self-styled psychic detectivewho had started out in the carnivals and music halls of his native Austria. Bythe time of the Weimar Republic, Hanussen was one of the more famous magiciansin the capital. Weimar Berlin was full of seers and mystics who all competedwith each other. Petty jealousies and battles for primacy characterised boththem and their work. All vied for supremacy but Erik Jan Hanussen, through acanny but clever series of self-promotions, became pre-eminent. He bought hisown luxurious cabin cruiser nicknamed ‘The Yacht of Seven Sins’, on which heexperimented with mescaline and peyote, as well as hypnotising women intosustained frenzies of sexual ecstasy.As a result, Hanussen was alternately condemned and supported by the press,depending on whether they supported Hitler or not. It was almost inevitable thatHanussen would bring out his own weekly, in which he could draw attention to thestartling accuracy of his own predictions. When his own newspaper, BerlinerWochenschau, carried a story under the headline ‘Hanussen In Trance PredictsHitler’s Future’ in March 1932, people sat up and noticed.Adolf Hitler would, he calmly predicted, become Reichschancellor in a year’stime. Later that same summer of 1932, Hanussen was ushered into the company ofthe future Führer, an event which has become totemic and around which muchmystery exists. Some accounts suggest this occurred in 1926, but more recentbiographers point out it was actually later in the Führer’s rise. Certainly, themagician suggested ways of making his ascendancy more assured.‘If you are serious about entering politics, Herr Hitler, why don’t you learnhow to speak?’ Hanussen asked.After teaching him about elocution and body language, Hanussen would become partof the leader’s reinvention and eventually cast the Führer’s horoscope – bywhich his fate was sealed. Now in the frenzied atmosphere of divisive politicswhich consumed Weimar Germany, where Hanussen was seen increasingly as a Nazistooge, it emerged that he was Jewish. In September 1932, a Viennese chorus girlwas gossiping that the ‘Aryan prophet’ was circumcised. In communist newspapers,Hanussen was described as ‘Hitler’s Jewish disciple’, ‘a religious quack’ and‘an outrageous swindler’.And when another enemy revealed that not only was he fully Jewish – by the Nazidefinition of bloodlines – but the nephew of a rabbi from the Austrian ghetto,it was reported as a fact in one of Josef Goebbels’ propaganda sheets. Erik JanHanussen denied the charges and soon turned his greater attentions to a shiningbeacon of his own self-aggrandisement.In early 1933, he was ready to open his own ‘Palace of Occultism’ in Berlin. Bynow very rich, as his biographer Mel Gordon notes, the whole enterprise wasglorious, ‘like a spiritual appendage to Versailles’. In some ways, it soundsmore akin to a tart’s boudoir crossed with a gold-bedecked Taj Mahal and anEgyptian temple. Decorated with astrological signs and pure-white marbledreligious statues, it also contained a vast bronze statue of the man himself,dressed in a Roman toga, his left arm rising in a Nazi salute.The innermost sanctuary, The Room of Glass, was Hanussen’s throne. There he satby a large glass table under which a wheel, covered with various occult symbols,would be spun. Hanussen would divine meaning like a croupier attuned to theoccult. On the opening night, he enthralled the crowds of visitors. ‘Hepredicted the blood purge that was to come later and the war with England,Russia and America,’ recalled one.The next night, something terrible happened. The Reichstag was burned to theground. Hanussen’s prediction of the Reichstag fire – or rather of a great housein flames – has led some to speculate that he had even hypnotised Marius van derLubbe, the anarchist supposedly behind the outrage.But then within a month, Hanussen himself disappeared. Ten days later, his bodywas found. The perpetrators were never found but everyone knew who they wouldbe. The savage irony was that the great seer couldn’t see what was right infront of him. ‘I always thought that business about the Jews was just anelection trick of theirs,’ he had said a few weeks before. ‘It wasn’t.’images [images/icon.jpg]Unlike Winston Churchill, who had a natural predisposition to intrigue of anykind, Adolf Hitler said he would never shake hands with a spy, generallydismissing intelligence warnings as fanciful or fantasist. So when, in the earlyautumn of 1935, the Führer himself summoned his new espionage chief to hismountaintop lair, very little was expected. Against the suitably Wagnerianbackdrop of the Berghof, something entirely unexpected happened that Septembermorning.Both Führer and spymaster bonded.In fact, Captain Wilhelm Canaris was just the kind of person Hitler would havehated and normally blamed for the country’s failures. His newly appointed spychief was a fairly typical Wilhelmian brahmin of wealth and bourgeoissensibilities who ran the Abwehr, as German Military Intelligence was known.After a family cruise around the Aegean, the young Canaris – whose childhoodinquisitiveness led to his nickname of ‘Kika’ (snooper) – joined the ImperialGermany Navy in 1905. In time, he became one of the finest officers of hisgeneration, despite his shortness, his inscrutability and what seemed to be afrail appearance.During the Great War, Canaris ‘showed a penchant for clandestine operations andsecret negotiations which earned him a reputation as being something of asuper-spy’, as one biographical entry has it. Something of his reputationpreceded his meeting with Adolf Hitler, which was by all accounts highlyconvivial. ‘You can talk to the man,’ Canaris later told his associates aboutthe Führer. ‘He is reasonable and sees your point of view, if you point it outproperly.’Within a four-month period, Canaris had seventeen private meetings with theFührer. With his baroque and old-world politeness, the canny spymaster wouldlisten and flatter. Canaris was determined to make his service pre-eminent –there were at least another half dozen agencies competing with his – and by acanny mixture of mending fences, playing off rivals and, in the first few yearsat least, scoring some notable successes, he did so. Small wonder that in time,the Abwehr’s rambling headquarters on the Tirpitzufer came to be known as the‘Fuchsbau’, or fox’s lair.As befits someone named for such a wily creature, nobody could ever quite pindown the exact loyalties of Wilhem Canaris. The head of the Abwehr remains aremarkably opaque figure because of the enigma of his personality, living up tohis billing – by Russian military intelligence, who knew a thing or two aboutsuch matters – as the most dangerous intelligence man in the world.In some accounts, including official government ones, it is said that before thewar British Intelligence had no idea what its German equivalent was called, whoran it, where it was based and what it was up to. Thanks to the recent releaseof MI5 papers from 1938, which cross-reference some CX material from MI6, it isclear that Canaris’s opposite numbers were perfectly well aware who he was andwhat he was doing. An MI6 report from Prague dated 25 July 1938 reveals that C’sstaff knew the Abwehr was a function of counter-espionage in the German ArmedServices. The admiral was recorded as having been Chief of the Defence Section(Abwehrabteilung) in the two previous years. And in another CX report it says:‘CANARIS was described as essentially a southerner, and in tastes as well asappearance, more Greek than German.’There, though, the certainties end.In the years to come, Wilhelm Canaris – who was promoted to vice-admiral in 1938and admiral two years later – would become known to MI6 as Theodor. As theofficial MI6 history notes, there has been a great deal of speculation aboutsuch breathtaking links.7 Though he never reported to anyone in the directemploy of British Intelligence, it is clear that Canaris used various cut-outsand intermediaries to let London know exactly what he was thinking. These odd,shifting sands of contacts were amongst the closest-guarded secrets of the warto come.images [images/icon.jpg]In the same way that Mansfield Cumming had dominated the early years of theSecret Intelligence Service, Wilhelm Canaris would set the tone for theorganisation which he came to command. The Abwehr had actually been in existencesince 1921, though such an agency had been forbidden by the strictest terms ofthe Versailles Treaty. Its title meant ‘defence’, as in the sense of wardingoff, for ‘defensive’ counter-espionage was allowed. Originally, the Abwehr was asmall, yet surprisingly effective adjunct to the Supreme Command. Rather likeits equivalents in MI6, throughout the twenties the Abwehr’s officers andreservists were recruited from the old school, all keen to maintain the gloriouscertainties of the older imperial order.8In these early years of Wilhelm Canaris’s ascendancy, he built his staff up from150 to just under 1,000 in three years. It steadily grew, until it took overseveral buildings to the west of Berlin. The small ‘defensive’ organisation wasreorganised into five separate sections, including a large department whichwould be responsible for sabotage in enemy countries. Much of what happened tothe Abwehr in the subsequent intelligence war can be explained by AdmiralCanaris’s curious, invariably inscrutable character. The admiral’s white-hairedcountenance led some to call him Father Christmas, for he was generally seen asan avuncular figure who spoke hesitantly and walked with a stoop, his handsfirmly clasped behind his back.From his Spartan office, Canaris would look out on to the limes and chestnuts ofthe Tiergarten. Most mornings, he would go riding in this park which bisects thecentre of Berlin. ‘The room where Canaris worked symbolised the man and hischaracter,’ his executive officer, Erwin Lahousen, would later recall. ‘Youcould not but notice the simplicity of his surroundings.’ The floor was coveredby a threadbare Persian carpet, along with a small safe and a handful ofportraits. The admiral spent much of his time looking at his faithful pair ofdachshunds asleep on a cot in the corner. It would later be said that Canarispreferred animals to people9 – like the Führer himself – and with good reason.If a man didn’t like dogs, Canaris would say, he couldn’t be trusted.Outside the office, there were equally unlikely pursuits.He enjoyed cooking, often preparing meals for a near neighbour whom he had knownon active service at sea. Their gardens directly backed on to each other’s in apleasant suburb of the capital. This younger man, highly regarded for his mellowand delicate violin playing, was often invited over by Frau Erika Canaris10 tojoin her in musical recitals at their home on Sunday evenings. And in time,perhaps, both she and her husband would rue the day that they had let ReinhardHeydrich enter their lives; his ruthlessness was only ever matched by anoverreaching certainty in the malign influence of the British Secret Service andwhose many pretensions involved signing himself as ‘C’.images [images/icon.jpg]By now, the tide had turned against the occult in Nazi Germany.Within a couple of years of reaching power, the Nazis had banned all publicdisplays of occultism and astrology. Just two years before the outbreak of theSecond World War, it had become a punishable offence to publish or even cast ahoroscope about Der Führer. The head of the Central Astrological Office – a kindof puffed-up, self-congratulatory body to which most astrologers belonged – wasarrested. He was released and became, perhaps understandably, more circumspectin his predictions. Newspapers were banned from carrying astrologicaladvertising. Fortune telling and astrology was also banned in Berlin. Policeraids on occult bookshops and publishers became a regular occurrence. All occultsocieties were outlawed and their members found themselves under investigationby the Gestapo.The reasons were simple enough.Despite some of the more specious claims, the Nazis only ever used astrology andoccult practices to suit their own needs. ‘We cannot allow astrologers to followtheir calling unless they are working for us,’ Heinrich Himmler said at thetime. ‘In the National Socialist state, astrology must remain a privilegiumsingularum. It is not for the masses.’For partisans of the occult, this became an all too inevitable axiom. Suchsecret knowledge was simply too dangerous to be allowed in the hands of theDeutsches Volk. The greater truth is that the Nazi hierarchy didn’t want toallow its influence to be allowed unchecked, nor to have any control. The Führeragreed. In private, Adolf Hitler referred to horoscopes as ‘a swindle whosesignificance should not be underestimated’.The German leader’s interest in the occult was only ever fleeting and dictatedby political expedience. An autodidact with various quotidian chips on hisshoulders, his ostracism was a sine qua non of higher insight which the Führerfelt. Most of it centred, unsurprisingly, on the Jews. Yet despite Hitler’sambivalence, that did not stop his immediate circle from promoting any number ofbizarre ideas.A Munich physician in the Führer’s employ regularly used an astrologicalcontraption he called ‘the sidereal pendulum’, which supposedly gave him thepower to sense the presence of Jews or those of Jewish ancestry. Adolf Hitlerwould supposedly call upon its peculiar ‘mystic’ powers and discuss questions ofracial purity with its creator. Various surreal ‘cosmic theories’ would alsocome to be taken up in much of the Nazis’ cack-handed interest in history: ofuniversal ice, of ancient history and human origins from giants, all fuelled andmatched in the operatic range of Wagnerian grandeur (the composer whom, itshould be noted, Adolf Hitler idolised as the greatest interpreter of Germanfolk spirits, yet another wrong-headed interpretation of history that propelledthe Nazis on their way).images [images/icon.jpg]The key to understanding Wilhelm Canaris’s disquieting protégé was, it wasalways said, the almost operatic side of his nature. When he had first metCaptain Wilhelm Canaris in 1923, Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich had been alanky, blonde cadet most notable for his high-pitched voice, arrogantdisposition and occasional histrionics. His was a complex character and apersonality which one historian aptly calls ‘a cold, calculating, evil geniusand a very real man of many weaknesses’. So successfully did he hide the latterthat even Adolf Hitler referred to him as iron-hearted.With a cruel, thin face which would not have looked out of place in a Van Dyckportrait, Reinhard Heydrich’s arrogance was a mask for crippling insecurities.Being the son of an equally arrogant, often harsh actress and an opera singerperhaps explains his highly strung nature. Heydrich came to be the most fearedspy chief in pre-war Germany when a former pig farmer asked him to write thesynopsis for an intelligence apparatus for the Nazi Party. After twenty minutes,he returned, paper in hand. In this, he gained Heinrich Himmler’s eternalgratitude.Reinhard Heydrich thus bluffed his way into the intelligence world, soonestablishing himself ‘the master of the necessary mysteries’ ofcounter-espionage and threats to the Nazi movement. Soon, his granderpretensions rubbed up against the harsher realities of the time, in that hecould only afford to buy garden furniture for his office. Often rash andimpetuous, he had an impressive memory for detail and a love of the theatrical.In short, Heydrich loved playing the role of a secret service chief, filling theSS library with all the trashiest spy novels – Le Queux, inevitably, amongstthem – and even signing correspondence with an ornate letter C, as the head ofthe British Secret Service was known to do. Such pretensions informed a peculiarvision of MI6. He was told, for example, that the Secret Intelligence Servicewas self-financing (by selling its secrets to the government of the day).Reuters, the Daily Express and the YMCA were also viewed as supposed pawns ofBritish Intelligence.Soon he was the de facto intelligence chief for the Nazi Party. Established aspart of the SS, Heydrich came to command the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), which wouldbe staffed by other sons of the middle classes who had been alienated andrepelled by the rootlessness of Weimar society. The SD was created by Heydrichspecifically to alert the Nazis against threats to the party. Though the Abwehrwas supposed to provide intelligence for the German General Staff, it wasinevitable that it would brush up against Heydrich’s upstart agency. The resultwas much how Nazi Germany liked to carry out its official business: a vast,competing, uncoordinated mess, with often contradictory information reaching thetop via whichever minister or bureaucrat could vie for the attention of theleader.Ostensibly, the Abwehr was responsible for military espionage andcounter-espionage, while the SD looked after ‘political’ crime and espionage.‘Usually the two agencies worked together well, despite extensive duplication ofeffort,’ one historian has written. Though outwardly maintaining a friendship,Admiral Canaris and his former cadet would become the deadliest of rivals by theend of the thirties. As well as post-war myths, there is much mythologysurrounding the relationship of Heydrich and Canaris, almost a Manicheanstruggle, a delicate dance like that of two tarantulas.Sicherheitsdienst agents spied on their Abwehr counterparts. Officials placedmicrophones in opponents’ offices. Heydrich and Canaris recorded intimatedetails about each other’s supposed indiscretions in secret files. All telephonecalls from the Fuchsbau were monitored by Heydrich’s wiretappers. Each jealouslyguarded his own sphere of influence in the hope of gaining pre-eminence with theleadership or, at the very least, that the other would make some sort ofterrible mistake that could be used against them.When Wilhelm Canaris started to become aware of the excesses of the Nazi policestate – particularly investigations of the links between the Wehrmacht and theRed Army – he was dismayed that they had been orchestrated by his former cadet.‘Heydrich is a barbarous fanatic with whom it will be very difficult tocollaborate in a frank and loyal manner,’ Canaris said on one occasion. But aneven more illuminating tale comes from the admiral’s nephew,11 an SS officer whowas interrogated after the war. Constantin Canaris said that his uncle was areligious man who had, in 1937, approached Heydrich on the party and SSattitudes to religion. The admiral told his nephew he had lent Heydrich a bookon the great religions of the world, ‘telling him that he ought to learnsomething of the meaning [of] faith which he was attacking. After a few days,Heydrich returned the book, saying that it was beyond him and that he was notinterested in such matters.’images [images/icon.jpg]In the battles to come, Reinhard Heydrich – and others in the Führer’s immediatecircle – never lost their faith in the ubiquity and infallibility of the Britishsecret service. Yet, ironically, the advice given by MI6 to the Britishgovernment was, by the latter part of the thirties, largely being completelyignored. Having failed to warn of Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia, funding for theSecret Intelligence Service was reduced by disgruntled Whitehall mandarins. Cprotested in vain that lack of money meant it had no presence in those countrieswhich could have ever spotted the Abyssinian attack.To be fair, the Secret Intelligence Service was now preparing for the fightingto come by establishing a new espionage network across Europe. Purely as a formof insurance, one of Sinclair’s deputies, Claude Dansey, a larger-than-lifecharacter known, not entirely fondly, as ‘Uncle Claude’, wanted to create aparallel structure in case the ‘official’ networks based around BritishEmbassies became compromised. Colonel Claude Edward Marjoribanks Dansey was anéminence grise within MI6, an acerbic, querulous figure who, as one who knew himwell said, seemed to be consumed by hatreds. Yet another Indian policeman whosurrounded himself with placemen from the same inefficient old boy network, hisarrogance and incompetence (‘a snob, a bully and a shit’) ensured that he vetoedthe recruitment of graduates. As a result, the overall calibre of MI6 officersstill left a lot to be desired, with one later remarking that they were ‘by andlarge pretty stupid – and some of them very stupid’.Existing only in continental Europe and Greece, Dansey’s Z Network employed acurious mixture of businessmen and journalists who would obtain political andeconomic intelligence. They used, as cover, London Films, run by Sir AlexanderKorda, the Hungarian-born film director who got a knighthood for his trouble.‘It was a very well kept secret,’ Dansey’s widow said many years later. Herhusband sat on the board, which allowed MI6 to keep in contact with its agentsall over Europe. The Z Network also used a tour company (to inveigle agentsabroad) and some kind of chemical one. The problem was that refugees would comeup with any old nonsense (‘prepared to sell anything to anybody’) and, as theywere untrained, were often comically inept.The more formal MI6 network hardly fared any better.The Foreign Office remained unhappy at C’s men using diplomatic cover aspassport control officers (PCOs) and there was a long and bickeringcorrespondence about its general unhappiness. Worse, because MI6 officers mainlyexisted on private incomes, financial temptation proved too great, particularlywith the exodus of the disaffected from Germany.To be fair, the passport control officers were overwhelmed. Some behaveddespicably. Exit visas for Palestine were preferentially issued to richer Jewishémigrés who would hand over vast sums for the privilege. When it became clear in1936, for example, that the PCO stationed in The Hague had been acceptingbribes, he shot himself. In Germany, the demand for exit visas was so great thatFrank Foley – a true-life Schindler if ever there was one – would lament thathis workload grew to such an extent that he had to restrict the time he hadavailable to devote to genuine intelligence gathering.With its officers overwhelmed, whenever genuinely useful information came infrom Broadway Buildings – the CX reports still elaborately bound in red books –very few civil servants tended to believe it. ‘Such a service as the SecretIntelligence Service ought properly to regard itself as always at war,’ the MI6War Book had noted at the end of 1937. ‘An actual state of war does notradically alter its functions, it only intensifies them’. In fact, the greatertruth, as the former Foreign Office archivist Gill Bennett has wryly noted, wasthat MI6 was always at war with Whitehall.Its coverage of Germany was dismissed as spasmodic and fragmented, for in such aharsh, totalitarian police state the usual diplomatic rumours did not filterthrough. Worse, as the official history of wartime intelligence notes,‘clandestine sources were in no position to fill the gap’.Around the corridors of power, an even more pervasive belief was that the agencywas a kind of gentleman’s drinking club for middle-aged nobs – with officersnamed Cuthbert Bowlby and others like ‘Biffy’ Dunderdale and ‘Lousy’ Payne12 –who had also been at Eton, served in the Guards or married well. Suitablecandidates for the secret world were either metropolitan young men drawn fromthe London clubs or else ex-Indian policemen.And when, a few weeks after war was declared, Quex Sinclair passed away fromcancer, the appointment of his successor produced puzzlement at the apex of theestablishment. In one especially damning estimation, it was a complete mysterywhy someone so stupid had been shooed in as the new C. That such a complaintcame from the Duke of Buccleuch, whom he had fagged at Eton, shows just howseamless the robes of entitlement fitted the appointment of His Majesty’s newspy chief.images [images/icon.jpg]With his inheritance of vast estates across the Scottish Highlands and a namewhose pronunciation invariably confused foreigners, Colonel Stewart Menziessounds suspiciously like a character from a John Buchan novel. The scion ofScottish mercantile aristocracy, the chief who would direct MI6 in the SecondWorld War was, in his biographer’s telling phrase, ‘exceedingly good-looking inthe Hannay fashions of the Edwardians’. Born to the powerful elite who ruledhalf the globe, Menzies (pronounced Mingiss) was memorably described as‘sandy-haired, with a soft handshake and an air of indolence, belied by a glintof cunning in his brown eyes’ by one of his later underlings.The Duke of Wellington famously said that the Battle of Waterloo was won on theplaying fields of Eton. Now, in the glorious age of Edwardian England, it helpedthat Stewart Menzies had been a contemporary there with most of the Cabinet.Many of the intelligence battles in the Second World War evolved from those samefields, where sportsmanship had been set at a premium. A contemporary noted that‘Stewart was a beautiful athlete’, often winning the steeplechases, ‘probablythe most coveted race to win at Eton’. During what his friend termed ‘fourblissful years’, Menzies had been a Master of the Eton Beagles, became Captainof the First XI and was elevated to yet another élite within an élite – thePresident of Pop.But more significantly for this narrative, Menzies and his cronies wereintroduced to the works of Kipling by a kindly housemaster. As a result, lifeimitated art as the teacher ‘had a profound love and admiration’ for his seminalKim which his pupils came to share. Menzies was hardly the intellectual dufferothers had made out, for in Rex Benson’s estimation he ‘had a habit of plyingyou with questions and like “Kim” of acquiring knowledge which he put to gooduse in his later professional life’.When war broke out, Menzies joined the Life Guards and in November 1914, duringbattles in the Ypres Salient, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Hisregiment was virtually decimated – nearly a million men were either killed ormaimed – and, on that occasion, he had a remarkable escape when he jumped into atrench full of Prussians. In later years, when opinion was sharply divided overhis effectiveness, Stewart Menzies’ bravery was never brought into question. Ayear later, he joined Field Marshal Haig’s staff, where he became attached tothe British Expeditionary Force Headquarters as part of military intelligence(and, at that stage, it was a collateral branch that was entirely separate fromCumming’s service).13His attachment was to the Counter-Intelligence Division based in Montreuil,where he was engaged in ‘secret service and security work’ (the lapidary wordson his military record). There he took charge of a large staff that was alertfor potential spies and saboteurs. In later life, Stewart Menzies remarked thatthose three years of secret service in the Great War gave him thirty years’experience of the ways of humanity.images [images/icon.jpg]Opinion has been divided over how useful the chief of MI6 in the next war reallywas. Some of his more vociferous critics suggest he was rather hasty andsuperficial, yet Menzies himself was generally liked as a person. One assistantlater noted that ‘no-one could work closely without feeling for him real respectand great affection’. Some said he was not a particularly good judge ofcharacter,14 and in another assessment he ‘had more common sense than learning’.Yet Menzies hardly needed to be a towering intellect, a point lost on(inevitably) towering intellects, for in the fighting to come academicabstraction was hardly necessary.The role Stewart Menzies would play was that of the good and faithful servant.‘C rarely left his desk during the war,’ his assistant Robert Cecil wrote. ‘Onereason was his feeling that he should be on hand if a summons came from the PM,which might come on any day of the week and at any hour of the day.’ The new C’sgreater problem was that he could not escape the shadow of the larger than lifeSinclair. Unlike the rascally Quex, Menzies was reserved – and diffident, somuch so that his ability to remain in the shadows and achieve things covertlywas almost psychological.As deputy chief, Stewart Menzies had capitalised on rumours from Germany aboutan inexpensive new ‘secret writing’ machine which were emanating from the mistsof Eastern Europe. Though adopted by the German military under the impression itwas unbreakable, the Enigma machine was vulnerable. As is now well known, thework of two Polish mathematicians prompted a systematic unbuttoning of itsfearsomely complex internal encoding, with help from MI6.In this determination to unravel the secrets of Enigma, the fortunes of the newchief, Sir Stewart Menzies, became inextricably linked. ‘He would not have heldthe job for more than a year if it had not been for Bletchley,’ said anotherobserver at the time. The new C was hampered by the fact the Secret IntelligenceService had remained chronically underfunded. Starting from a low base, thingscould only have got better for, in the assessment of another intelligenceprofessional, ‘if they had had the money, [they] would have provided us with asplendid organisation when the war broke out and [would be] capable of rapidexpansion’.images [images/icon.jpg]As befitting a future Chief of the Secret Service, the life of Sir StewartMenzies threaded the various seamless robes of the establishment, for he waswell born, well connected and, even more significantly, had friends at Court.15Early in the 1920s, the then Colonel Stewart Menzies happened to be havingdinner with King George V, whom he knew well from his family’s connections tothe throne. Despite his reputation for lack of mental acuity, a certain dry wit– along with an unquestioning devotion to the monarchy – was very much inevidence. Despite his closeness to the royals, he was commendably discreet whenthe king asked him for the name of the Secret Service’s man in Berlin.‘Sire,’ Menzies replied smoothly, ‘if my service has a man in Berlin, I may notdivulge his identity.’The king decided to offer some royal prerogative.‘What would you say if I said “Menzies, give me the name of our man in Berlin oroff with your head”?’‘Sire, if you were to give such an order, and when your order was carried out,my head would roll with lips still sealed.’With his subsequent elevation to the coveted role as C, Stewart Menzies wouldbecome an important player in the most furtive and influential cabal of all:‘the spider in the centre of such a network’, in the estimation of his obituary.He was protected by a real-life Miss Moneypenny, Kathleen Pettigrew – ‘aformidable gray-haired lady with a square jaw of the battleship type’ and – tothe endless procession of visitors who came to gaze upon her beauty – heryounger assistant, Evelyn Jones.And then there were the curious traditions that the chief would now inherit,every bit as preposterous (in some estimations) as the accoutrements andartefacts associated with occult gatherings. The green light above his door, hishabit of using special green ink and signing documents with the letter C, aswell as his frequent disappearances down a secret passageway out of thebuilding, seemed like amateur theatrics better suited to a more innocent, if notheroic, age. Sir Stewart Menzies would thus become the highest secret servant inthe land, living in a twilight world of shadows, where, as one historian hasremarked, ‘it is hard to distinguish with certainty between the menacing and themerely ludicrous’.Queues usually formed, as he could never quite delegate to Claude Dansey (whomMenzies had appointed assistant chief of the service) at the other end of thecorridor. The difficult architect of the Z Network spent most of his timefighting the deputy chief, Colonel Valentine Vivian, usually called Vee Vee, whowas equally serpentine: ‘a nice wet man with no guts’, in one assessment and, tomany, the ultimate ‘yes’ man in his cloying humility and insincerity. To thelower ranks, they were all mysterious, unfathomable figures. Many of the newwartime recruits to the service never quite knew what to expect. And for all therumours of its infallibility, there seemed very little by way of practicalinformation available to recruits. ‘You’ll have to work it out for yourself,’said one station chief.Most were equal to the task. There was something unique about the Britishcharacter which lent itself to the swift management of deceit, treachery anddouble-crosses. Espionage operations carried out in the name of statecraftrequired great imagination, extreme subtlety and, often, sheer improbability,none more so than one of the more remarkable in the story that follows, aself-promoting astrologer who, if his own memoirs are believed, helped win thewar single-handedly.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 In many accounts, German mysticism – which grew out of a twin heritage ofromanticism and paganism – contributed to an occultic counterculture which was apredecessor to Nazism. According to Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke,mysticism was only ever a symptom rather than a driver of Adolf Hitler’s variouspolitical ideas.2 On this same occasion at the Hofbräuhaus, Hitler declared that Jesus ‘wasthe greatest early fighter in the battle against the world enemy, the Jews’.Here, he was referring to the battle against the power of capitalismunderwritten by the Jews. Hitler, for reasons best known to himself, consideredthat Jesus was half Jewish – and therefore free of the ‘Jewish virus’ as hecharmingly called it – because the immaculate conception meant he only had twoJewish grandparents.3 Sidney Reilly, whose own life is laced with intrigue from start to finish,was an odd character for a masterspy for he was later said by his secretary tobe delusional. ‘Once he thought he was Jesus Christ,’ she recalled. An excellentdiscussion is by Andrew Cook in Ace of Spies: The True Story of Sidney Reilly(The History Press, 2004).4 Vernon Kell fought several rearguard actions against plans to force theirextinction or a merger with MI6 – or even worse, so far as he was concerned,Special Branch. Shortly after taking over MI6, Quex Sinclair (see pp.48–53)declared that the secret service had been set up all wrong. Its various branchesneeded to be amalgamated and he clearly thought he should become titular head. Cmade the point that there was no distinction between espionage andcounter-espionage and, in any case, both were needed due to the effects offoreign espionage. This would not be the last time the notion of a unifiedintelligence service reared its head in the twenties – or indeed later.5 The All-Russian Co-Operative Society shared its premises with the SovietTrade Delegation in Moorgate. The spy ring was led by yet another unlikely,self-styled ‘masterspy’, Wilfred Macartney, who was famously described as ‘apink-faced, cherubic grinning youth’. Macartney was an impulsive, former ArmyIntelligence officer who had gambled away his family fortunes, been involved ina jewellery heist and in 1927, came to the attention of MI5 for offering to workfor the communists. The Security Service planted a secret RAF manual on himwhich he then handed to a Soviet contact. Macartney was convicted at the OldBailey, given a ten-year jail sentence and later served with the InternationalBrigade in the Spanish Civil War. Towards the end of his life, several peoplewere quite certain he was teetering on the edge of madness.6 The most complete and well balanced account about the Zinoviev affair comesfrom the former Foreign Office historian, Gill Bennett, in A Most Extraordinaryand Mysterious Business: The Zinoviev Letter of 1924, which was published in1999. As Ms Bennett said at the time of publication, the exact circumstances ofhow the forgery was passed to the Daily Mail will never be known, though severalnames from this narrative are suspected of involvement. Four days before theelection in October 1924, the Mail ran an alarming story on its front pages:‘Civil War Plot by Socialists’ Masters: Moscow Orders To Our Reds; Great PlotDisclosed’. Labour lost by a landslide though Ms Bennett noted at the time ofpublication the impact of the letter on the Labour Party ‘was more psychologicalthan measurable’. She described MI6 as being at the centre of the scandal,although it was impossible to say whether the chief, Admiral Hugh Sinclair, wasinvolved.7 More on this startling link may be found in Chapter 12 (see p.325).8 Atop Wilhelm Canaris’s perennially untidy desk – unvarnished, ink-stainedand looking older than its nineteenth-century vintage – was a bronze cast ofthree monkeys, the supposed symbols of security – minding what you saw, heard orsaid – which as one biographer has written, ‘had a wider symbolism, with echoesof Kipling and the Anglo Saxon world of the Great Game’.9 Wilhelm Canaris, in several writers’ estimations, was a notoriously poorjudge of character. He had an irrational loathing for large men and those whomhe considered to have small ears. He had an insatiable interest in maliciousgossip. He often favoured naval officers and surrounded himself withincompetents and largely incapable time-servers. It was often said that hepreferred animals to people, and his pair of dachshunds, Sabine and Seppl (hisfavourite), followed him everywhere. His love of animals was so great thatofficers would buy pets to curry favour or else talk about them and remind himto feed the birds on his window sills. On one famous occasion, he called theFuchsbau from Rome because one of the dachshunds was sick. Because of theintricate detail in the conversation, his Italian hosts were certain it was allsome sort of elaborately coded instruction.10 Some measure of distraction came from his marriage to Erika Waag, a wealthyheiress who was musical and sensitive, the sister of a brother officer he hadmet during the war. Wilhelm Canaris rarely spent any time with her during theseturbulent times. She gave birth to a pair of daughters whom he generallyignored. Theirs was never a happy marriage and given his effete, lispingdemeanour, various questions about his sexuality have proliferated.11 This was Constantin Canaris (whose files may be found in TNA KV 2/3161). TheAbwehr was clannish, another dimension to its officers not wanting to rock theboat on behalf of its head who was their relative. Another nephew, JoachimWilhelm Canaris, was a desk officer in Madrid (see TNA KV 2/167). Another, HeinzCanaris, was attached to the Abwehr outstation in Lisbon and was only evertolerated as the boss’s nephew. He was ‘no great shakes’ according to one of hissuperiors. One of his nieces worked in Madrid, another in Portugal. And ColonelWaag, who was Frau Canaris’s nephew, later ran the large Paris outstation of theAbwehr out of the Hotel Lutetia on the Boulevard Raspail.12 In today’s world, where complete strangers telephoning from call centresgreet you as their long lost friends, the use of such nicknames is oftenmisunderstood. Throughout the war years, it was common for people to refer toeven their closest friends by their surnames. Nicknames were, as Noel Annanpoints out (note, p. 7 of Changing Enemies), ‘used as a gesture towardsinformality, particularly in the Army and Navy’.13 In some accounts, Stewart Menzies is said to have joined MI6 then. Theconfusion comes from the fact that both MI5 and MI6 routinely sent officers onattachment to the British Expeditionary Force. In Menzies’s case, it was theother way around: he was a BEF officer on attachment to a collateral branch ofMilitary Intelligence. At the time, Cumming’s agency was sub-branch (a) ofMilitary Intelligence 1, one of four divisions under the nominal control of theDirector of Military Intelligence. In later years, when opinion was sharplydivided about his effectiveness, Stewart Menzies’ bravery was never brought intoquestion. What this citation for the Distinguished Service Order didn’t spellout is that the Life Guards had been virtually decimated during the November1914 salient at Ypres. Nearly a million men were either killed or maimed.14 When, in the late sixties, Sir Stewart was first identified as the wartimechief of MI6, in the aftermath of the defection of Kim Philby, one of hisleading critics was the Oxford historian Hugh Trevor-Roper. ‘He was a bad judgeof men and drew his personal advisers from a painfully limited social circle,’Trevor-Roper noted. However critical many were of the organisation (‘it was nota rational extension of an efficient bureaucracy of information’, inTrevor-Roper’s estimation), most regarded the chief with respect. He waspersonally considerate and ‘patently just, patently honest’ (p. 72, The PhilbyAffair, Kimber, 1968). That point was echoed in the recent authorised historywhich termed the new chief a fundamentally honest man ‘where a dishonest onemight have been disastrous’.15 A certain scurrilousness surrounded Stewart Menzies’ royal connections whichhe sometimes positively encouraged. There were whispers that he was anillegitimate son of the king’s (because he never mentioned his father in hisWho’s Who entry) and Stewart Menzies later divorced his first wife on thegrounds of adultery. After his father’s death in 1910, his mother, LadySusannah, remarried. Lieutenant Colonel George Holford was granted that mostillustrious of titles, a Silver Stick, whose function was to stand close to thesovereign’s person to protect him or her from danger. Dating from Tudor times,its name derives from the staff of office which had a gold or silver head.Holford – unlike Stewart’s real father’s somewhat raffish reputation andnickname of ‘Hellfire Jack’ – was solidly dependable and became an equerry tosuccessive monarchs. Fairly quickly, his mother became a lady-in-waiting toQueen Mary and soon, on his first marriage, Stewart married into another familywith connections. His new father-in-law had been an intimate of the Prince ofWales (in whose set his parents also ran)."},{"pageContent":"3THE DEVIL IN THE DETAILS [contents.htm#a6]My aim is to bring light. But then Lucifer was also a bringer of light … Adoctor’s poison cupboard contains wonderful means of healing. But what wouldthey become in the hands of a layman who did not know how much he should take ofthem? Astrology can be poisonous in the wrong hands … Anyone should not beallowed to study astrology, only those who take a solemn oath to us it only forgood.Louis de Wohl, Secret Service of the Sky (1938)For someone supposedly so mindful of the heavenly runes, the late Ludwig van derWohl admitted that he got the timing of his birth wrong. What seems like acurious admission for an astrologer is, in fact, telling. In his autobiography,I Follow The Stars, van der Wohl claimed he was born at 7.45 p.m. on 24 January1903. Later, he admitted it was nearer to 3.30 p.m. This was a deliberateobfuscation, he maintained, as he didn’t want anyone to meddle with his owncharts for their own advantage.This discrepancy speaks volumes about the man whom one secret servant wouldlater dismiss as ‘that German astrologer and exhibitionist’. With an ego thesize of Jupiter (and a stomach to match), van der Wohl would eventually claim tohave played a starring role in the secret war and more or less defeated theNazis single-handed. He would famously declare in another volume ofentertainingly immodest memoirs: ‘In the Second World War astrological warfarewas waged for the first time since the Thirty Years’ War, 1618–48. It was wagedby no more than a handful of men. There were six, as far as I know, on the Axisside: on the Allied side, I believe, I had the honour alone.’The truth was very different, and thanks to the release of his hithertorestricted Security Service files, the story of the Hungarian astrologer can nowbe told. The man who anglicised his name to the less Mitteleuropean andtherefore unthreatening Louis de Wohl would come to alternately bemuse, amaze,amuse, annoy and enrage British Intelligence – often, all at the same time.Louis de Wohl would also have a strange impact on the secret world with a seriesof subsequent events about which so many half-truths have been claimed. So faras Louis de Wohl is concerned, nothing was ever quite what it seemed. It is astory that links high policy and low farce, accompanied by a chorus of naysayerssuch as the MI5 informant who noted that he was ‘a charlatan and a fake’, a viewthat many in British Intelligence later came to quite quickly.Yet the curious character who had actually been born Mucsinyi Wohl Lajos had, ashis later handlers noted, ‘crowded a most adventurous career’ into his shortlife to date. ‘He has lived a large part of his life in Germany and came to theUnited Kingdom in 1935,’ MI5 later noted when it came to summarise hisbackground, ‘where [he] had made quite a name for himself as an astrologer.’Although claiming to be Hungarian, de Wohl spoke with a distinct German accent.After settling in London, he never had his passport renewed and the SecurityService recorded that he was Hungarian in ‘little more than name’. ‘De Wohl doesnot speak a word of Hungarian and has never at any time lived in Hungaryalthough claiming to be the son of a Hungarian nobleman,’ its officers noted. AsHungarians often say of themselves, de Wohl was the kind who would follow youinto a revolving door and end up coming out of it first. The astrologer alsoclaimed to be related to a former Lord Mayor of London, notable musicians, poetsand bankers – and nobody could ever quite determine if any of them were evenever so slightly based in reality.Mucsinyi Wohl Lajos had been born of Hungarian parents and was partly Jewish,but became a devout Catholic. His mother was a baroness – more formally known asV. V. Decifur – while his father came from a lower-middle-class background andhad served in the cavalry. De Wohl senior then worked as a journalist and apolitician, ‘but what his brand of politics was, de Wohl professes not to know’,the Security Service noted. Within a few years, the family had moved to Berlin,where his father had mining interests and became wealthy. Most of this money waslost and the family faced an unfortunate future, not least with the father’spassing five months before the outbreak of war in 1914.Louis de Wohl had been too young to enlist, and then the certainties end. By thestart of the twenties, he was working in a bank in Berlin, where he started towrite. Within four years, he had been sacked. ‘He struggled to become anauthor,’ a good friend of his later wrote, ‘though the actual dates given by himin passages in his books are contradictory.’And that was always the problem with Louis de Wohl’s stories about himself.Nothing ever quite added up, such as his claim that he got by with designingdresses and doing film publicity work. ‘He wrote in Germany some twenty tothirty novels of extremely dubious value,’ the Security Service later noted. ‘Hehas been a bank clerk, film scenario writer, a traveller – commercial andotherwise. He claims in his books to have travelled widely in the East in Arabdisguise.’The mention of such masquerades is significant, as there is an exotic tinge ofthe tales of Baron Munchausen suffusing his exploits. In his autobiography, hetells of visits to exotic places, tracking down drug traffickers, helping policeand so forth. If nothing else, Louis de Wohl had a vivid imagination. But whatwas self-evidently true was that he had a capacity for survival, reinvention andwas, as the authorities noted, ‘an extremely clever man with multifariousconnections’.images [images/icon.jpg]Somehow – and not for the last time – Louis de Wohl broke into high society inWeimar Berlin. The instrument for this was most likely a female companion whostyled herself as ‘a Rumanian princess’ by the name of Alexandra, whom theastrologer married in the mid-1920s. The daughter of a German Jewishbusinessman, the British security authorities noted again with some relish that‘his wife is really illegitimate, being the fruit of sin of a liaison between“the princess” and an Aryan German’. The relationship between Alexandra andLouis de Wohl would come to bemuse and baffle British Intelligence, not leastbecause he seemed ‘to have often frequented cafés in Berlin in feminine attire’(though disguise was crossed out and replaced by attire).His later time in London, as several other people who knew him have attested,also involved curious episodes of blatant transvestism of the exhibitionistvariety. Louis de Wohl’s sexuality became the subject of much speculation.Despite his marriage, the astrologer seems to have been mothered by variousolder women into whose company he regularly seemed to fall.Many people who met him assumed he was gay. Even allowing for the engrainedattitudes of the time, another astrologer who later knew (and liked) de Wohlnoted this marked streak of femininity. At the start of the fighting, thisfellow devotee of astrology, Dr Felix Jay, visited his friend at a party, wherehe was asked to accompany him on the accordion. ‘Louis indulged in one of hisfavourite pleasures,’ Dr Jay later recalled for an astrological magazine, ‘thatof dressing up as a woman. And, indeed, he looked the part, that is if you likePeter Paul Reubens’ “compleat ladies”.’1Whatever the true nature of his sexuality, Louis de Wohl’s life in the twentieshad been that of a social whirl, which often included the glitzy gatherings suchas the one he attended at the Hotel Esplanade in Berlin at the end of 1930.Here, it seems, the son of Prince Heinrich of the Netherlands was introduced tohim. After a discussion, Ludwig agreed to cast his horoscope. At first, theHungarian was ambivalent about these kind of fripperies, until it became clearthere was good money in making such predictions.And then, as if by magic, he was hooked. Astrological forecasts became part ofhis money-making activities. According to his memoirs, the man then still knownas Ludwig van der Wohl was approached in 1935 to do ‘very important’ work forAdolf Hitler. A party member who ‘wore a smart uniform and had lots of minionsworking for him’ came to see him. In der Wohl’s recollection, this sinisterfigure was part of a dedicated office which considered astrology for AdolfHitler (the German Geo-Political Institute in Munich) ‘which employs 1000experts to plot Hitler’s stars’, he later claimed. This was a completeexaggeration but one which der Wohl would later elaborate to great advantage.The only Party member engaged on any such work at that time was Karl-FriedrichSchulze, whose role was much less prosaic. He acted as a censor to stop the morelurid forms of fortune-telling from appearing in the public prints.In his own estimation, der Wohl hated the Führer and his politics, not leastbecause of his own Jewish origins. As he didn’t want to end up in hock to ‘atyrant with one of the most dangerous horoscopes I had ever seen’, he made hisway to London that summer of 1935. Though, as MI5 noted, not technically arefugee from Nazi oppression – he had left ‘somewhat in a hurry’ and, more tothe point, did not ‘know how much Jewish blood he has’. He later claimed in apress interview that he had endured three years of Hitler and knew how evil hisregime was.‘Neither I nor members of my family were ever molested,’ he later claimed to anAmerican reporter, ‘but I saw and heard stories that sickened me.’ The sense ofsuspicion, distrust and disbelief about all these claims suffuse all the variouslater British Intelligence reports, with one, oddly, picking up the rumour thathe was ‘well known in post-war Germany as a Nazi’ rather than being a victim.Yet despite his Walter Mitty-like tendencies, Louis de Wohl soon made his markin pre-war Britain. In the same way that the devil’s greatest trick was to showhe didn’t exist, then Louis de Wohl’s was to summon a plausible enemy out ofnowhere, the so-called Führerastrologe.images [images/icon.jpg]If there was one thing which Karl Ernst Krafft would never do, that was to leavethings well and truly alone. Most people who ever encountered him thought he wasdownright peculiar. The word many used in their descriptions was ‘difficult’,for most were always negative in their initial reactions and subsequentmemories. Partly it was because Krafft had no sense of humour, but also becausehe contrived a deliberately bizarre appearance.‘[He] was short – dark-haired, dark-eyed and with sharp, peering, palefeatures,’ recalled one contemporary. ‘For a long time he looked more like agnome than a human being.’ Another who came to know him well later said ofKrafft – independently echoing MI5’s assessment of Louis de Wohl – that ‘he hadglimpses of genius, but sometimes behaved like a charlatan’.In other words, like most of the astrologers encountered in this story, hefitted right in. By all accounts, Karl Ernst Krafft was a brilliantmathematician who developed, over the best part of a decade, an elaborate theoryof predicting the future based on an individual’s personality. Born inSwitzerland to German parents in 1900, he was a well-known contributor to Swissnewspapers. While an undergraduate, he became convinced by his own elaborateexplanation for human behaviour based on statistics and character. But when hepresented a paper in his last term in Geneva, ‘Cosmic Influences On the HumanIndividual’, one of his professors said: ‘You can prove as much as you like, butyour theory is complete nonsense.’Not only would Krafft now be barred from submitting a PhD on the subject, hewould spend many years trying to find a suitable berth, including, bizarrely,his appointment to a department store in Zürich where he cast horoscopes forcustomers. A certain bitterness set in, which would be fanned by the rise ofNazism. Always highly strung, Krafft would spend time in an asylum beforeearning a living as a ‘psychological adviser’ in the thirties, helped by afinancial legacy from his estranged family. Steadfastly, he was scribbling awayon what he hoped would become his magnum opus that tied everything together.Eventually, it was published in Brussels as De L’Astrologie par la Cosmobiologieà la Typocosmie.To support these ideas, Karl Krafft lectured in Germany, France and England. Thebook – a ‘wonderful mismash’ in one estimation – appeared in August 1939. It issignificant for his supposed abilities that Germany’s signing of thenon-aggression pact that month with the Soviet Union was not foreseen in hisMeisterwerk.Yet his entry into the orbit of Nazi ideologues was almost preordained.Krafft also felt that he was unappreciated in his native land. That he wasanti-Semitic, pro-German and hated the Swiss had much to do with what happenedover the next few months. That same autumn, when war broke out, Krafft was backin contact with a former schoolteacher and classical scholar who knew someSanskrit. Dr Heinrich Fesel was employed at SS Headquarters (later known as theRSHA, Reich Main Security Office) on Prinz Albechtsrasse on various strands ofideological research that encompassed freemasonry, cults and occultism.As noted earlier, Himmler’s various bizarre obsessions informed much of thiswork and, in Charles Wighton’s elegant phrase, the section Fesel worked forcould best be described as the wastepaper basket for half-formed ideas andprejudices.2 ‘There the SS cranks whom even Himmler found too much foundshelter,’ one biographer of Heydrich’s has added.There is little doubt that Karl Krafft’s various musings found a mildlyappreciative audience. Paid just 500 Reichsmarks per month, the Swiss-Germanwould submit memoranda on economics, politics and various speculations for HerrFesel from his various astrological perspectives. Given that he also had a Swisspassport, Krafft could also travel freely and spread the word. Why anyone wouldwant to listen to him is hard to explain, but in his own mind, he now had astarring role.Karl Krafft would have dearly loved to have been Adolf Hitler’s astrologer, forhe often gave readings and public sessions. In pre-war Germany, he more or lessclaimed that he was indeed the Führerastrologe to the more credulous of hisfollowers, a fiction that many within the RSHA were happy to endorse so long ashe didn’t go public. And when it became clear that even as innocuous a subjectas astrology could be used and controlled, it was obvious that ReinhardHeydrich, and more to the point, Heinrich Himmler, envisaged it as some sort oflong shot in the war to come. Karl Ernst Krafft provided Louis de Wohl with hisgreatest raison d’être, who could be cultivated and used as a weapon against theNazi regime.images [images/icon.jpg]That Louis de Wohl and Aleister Crowley would come to the attention of theBritish security authorities was hardly a surprise. Despite the cutbacks, MI5was still alert for saboteurs, anarchists and troublemakers. By the time heshowed up in the mid-thirties, Louis de Wohl was part of the great tide ofrefugees – mainly Jewish – which had started to arrive from Nazi Germany. Theproblem was that it was hard to determine just how honest and truthful some ofthose refugees were.Aleister Crowley had returned home very much with his tail between the legs, andthough the security service has admitted keeping an eye on him – after all, hewas a rabble-rouser of some note – it says that his files were destroyed longago. Some see a great cosmic significance in this. Yet by this time, he was morea figure of fun than anything else.By now, Aleister Crowley had passed the pinnacle of his infamy. With his shavenskull, piercing eyes and general air of louche bohemianism, he picked fights,promoted myths and laid claims to various titles to which he was not entitled.Like so many ne’er-do-wells, he had gone to the last resort of the law inattempting to earn easy money. He sued a bookseller which claimed it hadsuppressed Crowley’s Diary of A Drug Fiend (it had only gone out of print) and,more importantly, the publisher of Nina Hamnett’s Laughing Torso for libel,which came from a mere three sentences referring to his time in Cefalù a decadebefore.When the case came to trial in April 1934, he seemed to relish in the attention.So did everyone else, for some of the exchanges were priceless, such as the onewhere prosecuting counsel claimed the defendant was hardly in a position toassume a higher sense of purpose.‘For many years you have been publicly denounced as the worst man in the world.’‘Only by the lowest kind of newspaper.’‘Did any paper call you the monster of wickedness?’‘I don’t remember which papers.’‘Have you from the time of your adolescence openly defied all moralconventions?’‘No.’It was obvious how it would play out.In his summing up, the judge said: ‘I have never heard such dreadful, horrible,blasphemous and abominable stuff as that which has been produced by the man,’indicating Crowley, ‘who describes himself to you as the greatest living poet.’He lost and had to pay court costs. He was left penniless and was eventuallydeclared bankrupt. Even more so than before, he became a shambolic figure whosejoie de vivre had also evaporated. ‘People meeting him for the first time oftenfeared that he would make indecent advances,’ notes one chronicler, ‘but inpractice, he was more likely to borrow a fiver.’And yet he was still consulted as the titular head of the OTO.It had grown thanks to a disciple – whose first wife had characterised Crowleyas the ‘international crook’ – who had actually worked in Military Intelligence.Now, in the run up to the Second World War Crowley’s protégé would becomepossibly the only person ever to have ever been kept in custody by the German,Belgian and French police and then investigated by the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation.images [images/icon.jpg]When Charles Henry Maxwell Knight passed away in the late sixties, he was betterknown to a generation of children as Uncle Max, a kindly and avuncularnaturalist who taught them how to explore the natural world via many engagingbooks and, more famously, his weekly radio broadcasts. Few of his many listenerswould have ever suspected his earlier role as an indefatigable hunter of spiesand subversives. In some ways it is not surprising, for the same skills neededto track, observe and tame wildlife had been put to better use in Max Knight’sown youth.From the twenties onwards, Knight had been one of the most formidable agentrunners of his generation. As several writers have suggested, he was indeed oneof the most enigmatic and, with a marked interest in the occult, certainly oneof the most unusual. As a gadabout in the twenties, socialising with debutantesand jazz musicians, Knight had the perfect cover. ‘In a world where we are alltending to get more and more alike,’ he had noted in a minute for the files, ‘afew unusual people give a little colour to life!’Max Knight had met Vernon Kell, the Director General of MI5, at a dinner partyin 1925. The general had thought him a splendid chap and recruited him to rootout communist spies. He seemed a perfectly good fellow.That, in Kell’s eyes, was usually enough.Tall, thin with delicate features, he had subverted the miseries of his ownchildhood into a charming, yet inscrutable exterior. Mixing with a fast set ofbright young things with private incomes, Knight was in his element and, afterhaving visited Manhattan, was very much into the new jazz music.Born into genteel poverty, his solicitor father wasted time and money onmistresses, which ended up bankrupting the practise. The young Max was partiallybrought up in the Glamorgan home of a miserly uncle, a tyrant, from whom hecould escape into the countryside. After his older brother was killed in thetrenches, he volunteered for the navy and served in armed merchantmen. After thewar, Knight taught Latin at a prep school and lived with his mother and sisterin a small flat in London that he soon filled with animals.As a result, he sometimes struck an incongruous figure.According to one who knew him, ‘he used to come round to our house on Sundayafternoons after riding in Hyde Park. He had a pet bear that used to go roundwith him on a chain.’ Max Knight and his amazing dancing bear, Bessie, wasprobably the most arresting of the beasts in his menagerie. Sometimes, a bulldogor a baboon would follow them both.At his home in Sloane Street, there were white mice in the living room, grasssnakes in the bath, a parrot in the kitchen and ferrets in the garden. He playedhis adored jazz to all of his animals. He once incubated a nest of adder eggs inhis pocket and later in life, so his obituary remarks, visitors might find himnursing a bush baby, feeding a giant toad or ‘engaging in masculine reparteewith a vastly experienced grey parrot’.Max Knight always liked to maintain that this interest in animals informed hiscareer as an agent runner. And that meant he would come across some very unusualanimals indeed, where, in the words of another agent runner, John Buchan, hewould meet ‘with odd people, in odd places, of fantastic duties which a romancerwould have rejected as beyond probability’.images [images/icon.jpg]Karl Johannes Germer had been Aleister Crowley’s leading disciple in pre-warGermany, where he ran the OTO, Ordo Templi Orientis. He had originally metCrowley in 1925 on a visit to Germany, where he became transfixed by theself-styled Beast. Before the Great War, Germer had been the Berlinrepresentative for a British machine-tool company based in Coventry. Travellingall over Europe, he had been in Tsarist Russia when war broke out and narrowlyavoided internment. In one account, Germer served in military intelligence onthe Eastern Front, where he received an Iron Cross First Class.An obvious question is: did he stay in contact with his masters?He certainly became an important acolyte of Crowley’s and became such a balefulinfluence that the master’s presence – and her husband’s devotion – led to adivorce from his first wife. Like Crowley, Germer was peripatetic and when theNazis came to power, wanted to leave for America with his new wife, Cora Eaton.As he later explained, ‘I failed to get my visa in time’ and remained in Londonuntil the Home Office refused to renew his British visa. It was thus Germer’smisfortune to return to Germany when the Nazi crackdown on occultism came intoplay. Along with all other occultic organisations, the Ordo Templi Orientis hadbeen declared illegal and suspected members were arrested by the Gestapo. On 2February 1935, this happened to him in Leipzig, where he was charged withrecruiting people to ‘follow the Highgrade Freemason Aleister Crowley’. Perhapswhen the Nazi state police found out Germer had sold Elixir of Life pills –manufactured from a neutral base and Crowley’s semen – it had swiftly promptedhis dispatch to Esterwegen concentration camp.Nevertheless, he was released a few months later as more of a nuisance thananything else. Herr Germer then moved to Brussels, where he was arrested,deported to France in 1937 and then interned once more. He eventually emigratedto the United States in June 1941, where he supplied money and material tosupport the perennially skint Aleister Crowley with the proceeds of his variouswritings which were being sold through occultic bookshops in the US.Most of Karl Germer’s own income came from his fortunate predilection formarrying heiresses: after being widowed in the thirties, he subsequently marrieda Viennese piano teacher, Sascha Ernestine André, who continued to support him.When the FBI started to target the Germers, they became so paranoid that theystopped talking in their own house. ‘His conversation is violent Nazipropaganda,’ is one comment from one particular FBI informant, while another hadoverheard him say: ‘Hitler is right in believing Germans are the Master Race.’The G-Men thought Aleister Crowley was Karl Germer’s controller because of theBeast’s previous pro-German sympathies which had been expressed over the years,not least in the First World War. ‘I do feel something is very wrong with thesetwo men [Crowley and Germer] being in constant contact with each other,’ is onetypical assessment. ‘Mr Crowley seemed the brains behind Germer. The latterseems to be a tool in his hands.’ Tool is an unintentionally hilarious choice ofword, as there is also an unsubstantiated rumour that the German had acquiredsyphilis from his master.In this sense, Aleister Crowley was an ideal candidate for espionage operationsas his often eccentric outlandishness blinded many to his rather more complexnature. As several people have also noted, Crowley was also adept at projectingdisguises, deceiving people and, in that sense, never quite revealing his handin all the years to come. In other words, he made a perfect paradox on thefringes of intelligence; well known, yet secretive when he needed to be.images [images/icon.jpg]Even without his obvious eccentricities, Maxwell Knight provides some sort oflink from the occult octopus to the occult in which he was interested. It washard to determine his true politics, for one colleague who knew him recalledthat he ‘had no time for democracy and believed the country should be ruled bythe social elite’. Perhaps it is no surprise that he was originally recruited bySir George Makgill, and in Knight’s later recollection, at his command hadjoined the first Fascist movement in Britain at the end of 1923.For the Fascisti, as they were known, Knight worked in various capacities –publicity officer, deputy chief of staff and, most importantly, its director ofintelligence. In this latter role, he carved out some practices which served himwell in later years. Getting to know people, compiling dossiers on them, as wellas establishing and maintaining cells within other organisations were all partof his approach.This remains the most controversial part of his career, the wellspring for anynumber of conspiracy theories. As a review of this part of his life notes of hiswork for the Fascisti: ‘Maxwell Knight quite clearly stood at the nucleus of themovement, its locus of power, and whatever competence and sophistication itdisplayed, were very largely his handiwork.’ To some, he was nothing less than afascistic agent provocateur who inveigled himself into left-wing organisations.For others, it was almost inevitable that someone so right wing would becomeinterested in the supernatural. For those who hated change, the occult appealedto conservative – with a small c – beliefs as it held everything in stasis. Theoccult world never changes, its myths are eternal verities and, as the writerPhil Baker notes, it is ‘as if nothing essential had changed since the days ofancient Egypt’.The occult was an attractive alternative to the lingering effects of the globalslump and the rise of unemployment by the end of the twenties. By the earlythirties, a sense of doom pervaded the whole of the country. It was, as severalpeople noted, an ominous time, ‘a low dishonest decade’ in W.H. Auden’s famousestimation.In another, it was even simpler – ‘the devil’s decade’.Yet so far as Max Knight is concerned, it might not be quite so clear-cut.As he later noted in his own history of his own work – especially therecruitment of agents – anyone could ‘find amongst his own circle of friends atleast one person who would be suitable for employment as an agent’. An agentrunner should go with the flow: if you were interested in right wing politics,you should mix in right wing circles. The same would be the case for thoseinterested in the left.One thing he always would ensure was plausible deniability.In the early twenties, MI6 had all the experience of running agents, while MI5did not. So Max Knight was employed on a freelance basis by MI6. As its officialhistorian said when his book came out, Knight ‘had a small amateur detective orsecret service in London, consisting of about a hundred individuals in all walksof life, many of whom spoke foreign languages’.They formed a group of what were called ‘casuals’ until there was a major rowand were eventually transferred to MI5. And as Knight later wrote in asemi-confessional note: ‘My association with this body was at all times for thepurposes of obtaining information for HM Government and also for the purposes offinding likely people who might be used by this department for the samepurposes.’Knight claimed he worked for this organisation until 1930, after which, as helater said, ‘it more or less became ineffectual’. After that, he was allowedsome latitude in running his own small department – sometimes known as M Section– because of the rise of the extreme right, not least the brief andself-destructive flowering of the British Union of Fascists.By then, he had shown his mettle and had made, in one official appreciation, ‘anexcellent impression, is perfectly honest, and at need, prepared to do anythingbut is at the same time not wild’. The same, alas, could not be said for theunfortunate woman who was his first wife, whose death is axiomatic for some inthat it had to do with their dabbling in the occult.images [images/icon.jpg]It was almost inevitable where Louis de Wohl would end up when he landed inLondon. The Esplanade Hotel in Maida Vale was home to many émigrés and,famously, hosted Sigmund Freud while he and his family were having their housedecorated (but only after being reassured about the quality of the hotel’scooking). It is a delicious irony in his often quoting Freud – and Jung andAdler – that Louis de Wohl had never studied them in detail and, more to thepoint, didn’t understand what he was talking about.At one point, the whole of the Polish government-in-exile later stayed at thesame hotel, and it was clear that the Esplanade appealed to the Mitteleuropeanastrologer’s own ornate tastes. The ostentaciousness – a heavy continental stylecalled Klubsessel – oozed rococo opulence and was presided over by abespectacled White Russian who was the owner.Louis de Wohl’s was a large room where he received his many visitors, lined withbooks, piles of paper, mementoes and bric-a-brac. ‘Most objects of daily usewere engraved with a baronial coat of arms,’ one later remembered, the hosthimself often dressed like an archduke in his chair. There were large cigarcases, for Louis de Wohl was often wreathed in cigar smoke. Here he deliberatelycultivated a Sydney Greenstreet air of mystery and grandeur, and what onevisitor found an ‘aura of questionable taste’. The same could have been saidabout the astrologer who always seemed to wear ‘a flowing robe or a silkendressing gown’.After anglicising his name to the more acceptable Louis de Wohl, he becamereasonably well known in a short space of time. In Germany he had already been asuccessful novelist, journalist and scriptwriter. Within three years of hisarrival in Britain, he had written a few more novels, had some earlier onestranslated from German and created a few potboilers of the reading-on-the-beachvariety. Consider Satan In Disguise, in which, The Observer noted in its reviewat the end of May 1937, ‘Both dialogue and characterisation are very much aboveaverage’.A year later, Louis de Wohl had written his own autobiography and a referencebook on astrology. Industriousness, then, was one of his greater virtues. In alater interview, his very accuracy, he claimed, ‘gained him respect in the superexclusive international astrological circle’. Yet his good friend Dr Felix Jaybegged to disagree. Having made his own study of astrology, Jay never fell forwhat he terms ‘the scintillating astrological canvasses [de Wohl] painted’. TheHungarian’s astrological wisdom ‘was entirely second hand’. Thanks in part tohis film background, Louis ‘served up the evergreen ingredients garnered fromothers in an attractive, amusing and often sensational manner’.Yet in de Wohl’s own estimation, his 1938 book on astrology, so he liked toclaim, was one of staggering exactitude. ‘There’s nothing supernatural oruncanny about it,’ he said in a later interview in the United States. ‘It’s justcold logic. Stars can affect our doings only 40 per cent and human wills affectthe remaining 60 per cent. But you can’t ignore that 40 per cent.’According to the Hungarian, he would never make impulsive predictions.Weeks of studies of charts, dates and what he liked to call ‘other technicalconsiderations’ would then prompt his drawing up a prediction. And,unsurprisingly, what that really meant was that he was soon developing his ownprivate clientele for readings who also believed his own unshakeableself-belief. Several future colleagues remarked that he had an obvious capacityfor falling on his feet. In the estimation of one, Louis de Wohl wasimaginative, gifted and had the quickest working brain she had ever encountered.In Dr Jay’s more honest – yet affectionate – account, the Hungarian simply madedull lives seem more interesting. His clients accepted him as more than anastrologer: ‘philosopher, saint, prophet and father-confessor’ whose own‘quasi-theological pronouncements often bordered on the ludicrous’. And yet, byan intriguing, entirely characteristic mixture of social climbing, blatantgrovelling and almost feral sense of self-preservation, Louis de Wohl was able –as he later claimed – ‘to convince the highest in the land that astrologicalwarfare against Hitler was a necessity’.images [images/icon.jpg]It had all the hallmarks of the plot of the potboilers so beloved of the time. Abeautiful, rich and somehow tragic redhead passes into a coma, her body isdiscovered and cannot be revived by her secretive, repressed husband, who – whenit came to a spectacular hearing into the circumstances of her death – was moreor less accused of bumping her off for her money. When he appeared at a hearinginto his wife’s death, Maxwell Knight had to endure such an accusation inpublic. His defence lawyer deemed it not a proper question. ‘What I was askingwere questions in order to elucidate if this man was in any way responsible,’the prosecutor then said, ‘not criminally, for his wife’s death.’There were, as with all unexplained deaths, even more lurid rumours: that hiswife had died because of an occult ceremony which had gone horribly wrong, andthat somehow, Aleister Crowley was involved. The fact that Max Knight’s goodname was effectively traduced in court meant a public scandal that could soeasily have derailed his career in intelligence.In the the same year that he met General Vernon Kell, Maxwell Knight had met aravishing, wealthy redhead by the name of Gwladys Poole. With her money theybought a flat on London’s smart Sloane Street, into which Knight moved hismenagerie. Gwladys was hardly a fan, for as his biographer notes, aged just 25,she ‘had not expected to become a zookeeper in addition to her other troubles’.Not only did Max flirt with other women and was largely affectionate, but theirmarriage was never consummated. Nevertheless, Gwladys’s devotion meant sheworked with him in the British Fascisti, where she acted as a secretary. Seekingto invest some of her family money, the Knights bought a pub in Somerset thatGwladys ran during the week while Knight worked in London. She was, at heart, acountrywoman. In Somerset, Gwladys had her own set and friends. At weekends, herhusband did travel down to meet her – only to then disappear, fishing for hours.It was thanks to such gathering abandonment that in November 1935, GwladysKnight took an overdose of barbiturates. Her family accused Max Knight ofdriving her to suicide. There were more lurid rumours. According to his laterassistant, Joan Miller, Gwladys ‘died in the Overseas Club after some sort ofoccult misadventure in which the notorious Alesteir Crowley was involved’.At the time, though, the newspapers reported that it was an open verdict. ‘Mrs.Knight died from poisoning by a barbitric hypnotic preparation,’ the coronerconcluded, ‘there being insufficient evidence to show in what circumstances herdeath occurred.’Such lurid publicity was anathema to MI5. Yet within months, Max Knight’sreputation was rescued by his first great coup – that of the Woolwich Arsenalconspiracy, where the case was saved by one of the braver women Max Knight everrecruited, whose work set the standard for much of his later penetration ofextreme political groups – of both the left and right.images [images/icon.jpg]Though his wife’s suicide had been reported in her real name, the woman MaxKnight used for his first – and possibly greatest ever – coup was only everreferred to, even in his own reports, as Miss X. By the early 1930s, the clearand present danger represented by communism had grown and, as part of his almostroutine activities, Max Knight recruited the first of his long-term agents. Itis instructive to see how. Olga Gray was, as he describes her in his ownofficial report, ‘a girl of 25 from a provincial town’ who was trained as acommercial secretary with six years’ experience (with the AutomobileAssociation).By all accounts, she was spirited, quick and had a photographic memory. Overcucumber sandwiches, she had been asked by another secretary if she would liketo join the secret service. Eventually, she was met by Max Knight at Euston. Shewas the perfect mole: she didn’t know anyone in London. Olga was just 19 whenshe began attending meetings of the Friends of the Soviet Union, a front for theCommunist Party. Working as a typist, Olga soon won the confidence of HarryPollitt, the Communist Party of Great Britain leader, who sent her on a ‘secret’mission to India to pay a recruit. Despite her carefree exterior, as Knighthimself noted, ‘some years of literally leading a double life, cut off from mostof her friends, and under conditions of considerable strain, still furtheraffected’ Miss X’s health. In the account she related to Anthony Masters, Olgaand Max Knight went to a cinema and a black cat crossed the road. ‘The nextevening Pollitt asked me to go to India on a mission,’ she recalled. The banknotes were scored with invisible ink and she hid them within some sanitarytowels. When she met her contact – a jazz band conductor at the Taj Mahal hotel– she was scared. ‘This was the first time I had been really afraid,’ she said,‘and suddenly I realised I wasn’t playing spy games any longer.’Yet as Max Knight realised, working as a secretary gave someone very good accessto what was going on. As he later remarked, any woman who had some basicsecretarial skills offered a unique chance for exploitation. ‘I would statecategorically that it were possible for any business magnate or governmentofficial to be able to see into the mind of his secretary,’ Knight laterconcluded, ‘we would be astounded at the amount of knowledge concerning thegeneral affairs of the business or department in question which lay in thesecretary’s brain.’Ultimately, it was a slow burn of an approach.As Knight himself described it, the aim was always to ‘eventually [get] into aposition of responsibility [to] obtain reliable information about the moresinister plans of the organisation concerned’. The approach, as he noted, should‘always be made by the body to the agent, not the agent to the body’, so OlgaGray waited, as he describes it, to be invited to join the party, ‘the firstmajor step, without laying herself open to any accusation of “pushing”’.It would be another seven years before she came to uncover the Woolwich SpyRing, where it became clear that the most secret details of anti-submarine bombsand detonators had been handed to the Soviets. The conspirators – led by PercyGlading – were jailed thanks to her evidence. The proceedings were held incamera, where Olga Gray was known as Miss X: she was terrified there might berevenge, so her name was kept out of the newspapers. ‘She must be possessed ofextraordinary courage,’ the judge said. ‘She has done a great service to hercountry.’The Woolwich Arsenal spy case was a personal triumph for Max Knight, who beganto rise through the ranks of MI5, being appointed head of B5b, a newly createdsection that dealt with subversive organisations. As such, he became moreinvolved in monitoring right-wing organisations, an irony not lost on severalreviewers of his life. Keeping his eye out for troublemakers was, as onecolleague noted, ‘all of a piece with his feeling for the occult and hisclandestine sexual leanings’.But Max Knight had another surprising sideline. As noted earlier, many of thefigures who became involved in espionage were often writers, an occupation whichinvariably allowed their imagination free rein. So it was with Knight, who hadfound writing another way to supplement his income when married to theunfortunate Gwladys.3 Most were – by common consent – dreadful, though didcontain the occasional nugget of autobiographical note. In one, Crime Cargo, ourhero had served on HMS Worcester – a training ship that both Knight and, acouple of years earlier, another writer who would come to resemble one of thecharacters in his own books and would become a very good friend of MaxwellKnight.images [images/icon.jpg]Dennis Wheatley, by the mid-thirties, was one of the most popular authors in thewestern world, the Stephen King of his day, earning the equivalent of half amillion dollars in today’s money in the years immediately before the war.Looking every inch the former wine importer he had once been, Wheatley was shortand bibulous (with the build and red nose of a true bon vivant), whose interestin the occult came only as a result of its entertaining possibilities. Today,his clubland snobbery, unapologetic racism and borderline anti-Semitism are alittle difficult to digest, yet he was hardly alone in his attitudes at thetime. Always acutely aware of status in society, Wheatley’s own background wastrade, and when, many years later, he joined White’s Club, he remarked it wasn’t‘bad for the Streatham-based son of a shopkeeper’.Growing up in the Edwardian era, Dennis Wheatley yearned to be a gentleman inthe Victorian mould, devoted to, in various degrees, decadence, esoterica andthe pursuit of hedonism on a truly magnificent scale. All would be important inhis later life and, as a result, Dennis Yeats Wheatley casts an important shadowin the shadowy world where the occult and espionage were joined together. Thoughconsidered an expert on such arcane matters as the supernatural, satanism, thepractice of exorcism and black magic, Wheatley genuinely disdained them. He wasonly ever interested in them as a plot device and, as part of his characteristicassiduity, made sure he consulted what he termed the ‘top chaps’ in the field.As a result, many rumours have asserted themselves about his involvement in boththe occult and, later, how that informed his employment by the secret services.It is a measure of his interests that his first volume of memoirs was calledDrink and Ink. Dennis Wheatley only ever got into writing after a decline in thefamily business during the Depression. The author of The Devil Rides Out and TheHaunting of Toby Jugg was gassed in a chlorine attack at Passchendaele. As aresult, he had been invalided out of the Army as a second lieutenant in theRoyal Field Artillery after seeing service in Flanders, on the Ypres Salient.That unfortunate circumstance meant that he would have something in common witha rascal whose body would later be found riddled with bullets and encased inconcrete.Eric Gordon Tombe was, in one journalistic assessment, ‘impaired in health andpossibly in moral character’, and met fellow invalid Dennis Wheatley in ahospital in a camp in Marylebone. After demobilisation and peace, Tombe tookgood times into the stratosphere, chasing women and gadding about town, withDennis often in tow. He took great delight in turning his army buddy into whatTombe called ‘a conscious hedonist’.The pursuit of such sybaritic pleasure would come to a sorry and sudden end witha disappearance which never made sense. It was the newspaper sensation of 1923.Tombe had been shot in the back of the head and forced via a manhole into awell, which was then covered in rubble. It transpired that Tombe’s friend,Ernest Dyer, had shot him and then attempted to empty his bank account. Ratherlike an Agatha Christie story, Dennis put a private detective on him and thecircumstances of what happened affected him deeply. Distressed, Wheatley nevertalked about it.After his first marriage failed, Dennis developed other, suitably eclecticaquaintances whose odd stories and experiences would inform his writing. Therewas, for example, Montague Summers, ‘a mysterious figure with his largemoon-like face, wearing a black shovel hat and flowing cape’, who some wonderedwhether he had actually been ordained or not. It was Summers’ 1936 tome onwitchcraft that, as Wheatley’s biographer notes, ‘with its list of black massand infant sacrifices set the subject back four hundred years’. Others say hewas a satanist who liked to dress as a priest and was sexually aroused by devoutyoung Catholics boys.There was also an Egyptian black magician called Rollo Ahmed who had done timefor forgery, was a friend of Aleister Crowley’s and could, it was said, consumea whole bottle of whisky and remain sober. It was also said that he had lost histeeth when he had messed up a ritual and failed to master a demon. In time, allthese friendships would wane, but another would provide Dennis Wheatley withgreat pleasure and a sense of unabashed fun in the company of his new wife, wholiked him too.His name was Max Knight.images [images/icon.jpg]One evening, Dennis and Joan Wheatley had gone to a party in Hallam Streetwhere, amongst the debutantes and socialites, they met a tall, charming man inhis mid-30s with a striking Wellingtonian profile. ‘The three of us settled downin a corner to talk and it transpired that, like myself, he had been a cadet onHMS Worcester,’ Wheatley later said. They had other interests, too, and in timeDennis Wheatley encouraged Max’s writing. By now, Max had published a handful ofstories and, indeed, the following year he would dedicate his next book to bothhis new friends.Charles Henry Maxwell Knight enjoyed the Wheatleys’ company greatly, and hisinfluence grew. One thing he then did was to keep it in the family, for hewanted to know about suspected communist subversion at Oxford. For this, Knightwanted to enlist the help of Wheatley’s stepson – Joan’s son from her previousmarriage with Jack Younger – at Christ Church, where his history tutor, J.C.Masterman, had Establishment connections.The Honourable William Younger, to give him his full name, had just come downfrom Oxford, and, as Knight later minuted, ‘we had a young man completelyinexperienced but whose flair for political investigation had attracted myattention during the previous year’. He would be an unlikely spy – he had awithered arm from childhood polio – yet he was secretive and found, like manyothers drawn into espionage, an outlet with his poetry. That he used the nameWilliam Mole was another curiosity, going so far as to dedicate one book toCHMK.‘It’s easy to see what made Max’s department such a literary one,’ said a latercolleague from the war years, ‘with so much dramatic material to hand, theimpulse to make a high class story out of it must have been pretty wellirresistible to anyone with the least degree of narrative ability.’As Nigel West has noted, there was an ‘almost incestuous’ overlap between MI5and various literary types. Knight often recruited his staff at the Authors’Club in Whitehall. His protégé, John Bingham, was also the model for GeorgeSmiley, and Bingham’s wife and daughters, who worked for MI5 and were noveliststoo. Bill Younger, late Bingham’s MI5 assistant, wrote Skin Trap, using the oddnom de plume of William Mole. His mother Joan was married to Dennis Wheatley andused the name Eve Chaucer to write No Ordinary Virgin. Younger’s sister alsoworked for MI5, as did their cousin Kenneth, a later Labour MP, whose 1964 bookChanging Perspectives in British Foreign Policy was hardly a page-turner.It is striking that in this milieu, authors who were interested in the occultwere all used to weaving lies and deceptions. But in his later remembrance ofhis wartime work, Knight said he would use ‘as far as possible the service ofpersons whose personal honesty and motives are beyond reproach’. That way, hereasoned, it saved time and effort in checking on the information, though thatwas hardly ever reciprocated.‘If you are going to tell a lie,’ Max Knight would say to his agents, ‘tell agood one and stick to it.’images [images/icon.jpg]If Max Knight was a repressed homosexual who liked animals and was interested inthe occult, then so too was Evan Morgan – but there the resemblance ends, forMorgan, better known in the thirties as Viscount Tredegar, was even morecurious. At times, it seemed that members of his family also consideredthemselves to be birds and, around the family pile in Monmouthshire, weregathered even larger – and scarier – animals than those the MI5 agent runnerused to take for walks. Small wonder that a fellow aristocrat, the Duke ofBedford, called the Morgans ‘the oddest family I have ever met’.Though a complete gentleman, Evan Morgan – exactly as the fictional James Bondhad done – left Eton under a cloud. A gathering storm seemed to follow in hiswake for the rest of his life, whipping up myth, scandal, rumour and, in onebiographer’s recent estimation, a cursed life. ‘Why even both trying to make upcharacters for one’s books when real people like Evan Morgan exist,’ asked oneof his good friends, Aldous Huxley.Viscount Tredegar soon became well known for a collection of animals whichformed a surreal menagerie at his family home in the Welsh hills. At TredegarHouse, a restoration mansion in Newport, the young Evan Morgan kept a curiouscollection of beasts within the stables. He kept a fierce white arctic owl inhis bedroom and boasted that he was the only person who could handle it. Therewas also a small alligator which wandered around freely, as well as kangaroosand monkeys outside. A baboon called Bimbo had the run of the house and therewas also a macaw called Blue Boy, whom he trained to climb up his trouser leg.The bird would emerge from Tredegar’s flies and would fly around, often shockingdowagers with the ripeness of his language (the macaw, not the viscount).On one occasion a black widow spider that was kept in a glass case in the mostformal of the State rooms, the Gilt Room, escaped during a party and waseventually found climbing up a curtain. Evan’s guests were both entertained andterrified in equal measure.Some explained his interest in birds as coming from his mother, Lady Tredegar,who made ever greater birds’ nests and dotted them around her estate. Some wereso large that people could actually sit in them. So eccentric was she thattowards the end of her life, she was convinced she was actually a bird.Young Evan always liked to think he was related to the pirate Henry Morgan, andwas, in every sense, a gay young thing of the twenties. On the occasion of hisdeath, even The Times obituary called him ‘a man of many parts to whom the worddilettante may appropriately be applied’. After the First World War, he wasaccepted as a Privy Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape by Pope Benedict XV. Quitewhy he turned to Rome was never really explained. ‘Lord Tredegar was gifted andversatile,’ notes another contemporary profile. ‘He painted cleverly and whenquite young exhibited at the Paris Salon.’ Also a talented musician and poet, hewas, by all accounts, completely crackers.Yet Lord Tredegar’s social conquests were vast. He married a Russian princess,though it was, as was said at the time, a marriage of convenience. The RoyalFamily enjoyed his antics and the Queen Mother termed him her favouritebohemian. His friends included the writer Somerset Maughan, the heiress NancyCunard, Noel Coward, H.G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, Augustus John and many more.When he became a viscount, he continued to live in London but often spent theweekend at Tredegar House, holding lavish parties, invariably enlivened by hismother. ‘She makes the most wonderful nests,’ he would say.And it is here that, once more, a bird of a different feather appears: AleisterCrowley. It is a matter of record that Evan Morgan met Aleister Crowley in theParis of the 1920s. That much can be stated with certainty; the rest isdifficult to know, because neither were exactly rational or reliable and bothenjoyed making outrageous and often ridiculous claims. In the case of ViscountTredegar, upon his death, most of his papers and letters were destroyed.Conspiracy theories swirl around him – and, as a result, many of the strangerepisodes of his life are invariably explained by the occult. The very odd thingwas that Evan was allowed to stay in the Vatican even though it was rumoured hewould head to Shelley’s grave to make incantations. Though his beaky nose stuckout from under a cowl, it was always rumoured that he wore robes so as to takepart in magic ceremonies, and at the family home in Wales was a black magicroom, so great that Aleister Crowley is said to have expressed his amazement. Itwas only a matter of time before Evan Morgan, too, would be recruited into oneof the more rarefied branches – literally – of the secret world.images [images/icon.jpg]At this point, the names of Max Knight, Evan Morgan and Dennis Wheatley form anunholy trinity surrounding the Beast, all the more piquant for their subsequentinvolvement in secret warfare in the Second World War. As a result, the morepreposterous claims can be – and indeed have been – made about their influence.Max Knight’s nephew told the late Anthony Masters that towards the end of 1936or the start of 1937, Knight and Wheatley applied to Crowley as novices and wereaccepted.‘But my uncle stressed that his interest – and also Wheatley’s – was purelyacademic,’ Harry Smith added. The only problem with this statement is that bythis time, in the later thirties, Crowley no longer conducted any suchceremonies. He was only interested in cadging food, which is rather more germaneto how Dennis Wheatley met Crowley at a Hungarian restaurant on Regent Streetsometime in 1934.As Wheatley’s most recent biographer, Phil Baker, has noted, they had a lot incommon – a devotion to hedonism, Edwardian in their complete rejection ofVictorian rectitude – and, by rights, they should have got on like a house onfire. ‘So it is remarkable that Wheatley never says anything whatsoever aboutthis lunch,’ Baker writes. ‘It provided him with not a single anecdote.’Later on, Wheatley had variants. ‘We had Crowley to dinner several times,’Dennis says in his memoirs. ‘His conversation was fascinating. He gave me muchuseful information and several of his books.’ Crowley gave him a copy of hisbook Magick In Theory and Practice, inscribing it to the more successful author(Wheatley), ‘in memory of that sublime Hungarian banquet’. The Beast would alsoprovide the inspiration for Wheatley to base one of his own villains, Mocata, onAleister Crowley in his novel The Devil Rides Out.images [images/icon.jpg]Any death, however unfortunate, within such gilded company always seems to haveinvolved occult practices. The supposed involvement of the intelligence agenciesadds even more smoke. The rumours about Gwladys Knight’s demise and AleisterCrowley’s supposed involvement are often reported as fact. Though MI5 says ithad indeed kept an eye on Crowley – quite possibly via all the Wheatleyrelatives – he was now approaching his 60s. By now, his life was quiet, on aneven keel and, as Martin Booth notes, he spent most of his time reading,carrying out magical rites, studying the tarot, entertaining visitors andplaying chess.And just weeks before his death in 1977, Dennis Wheatley was most insistent whathe really learned from them. He told the Guardian that he had met a lot of themost prominent occultists of the twenties and thirties. Crowley and that lot, hecalled them:They came to dinner but knew better than to try to inveigle me into any funnybusiness. I’ve never even attended a séance. I’ve only seen one ghost and atthat the time I thought it was a burglar. It cannot do you anything but harm.You can become so interested that you neglect your work and family and if youare at all weak-minded you can pop off to the loony bin. There is no questionabout it that quite a lot of people who are in the loony bin today are what inthe Middle Ages would have been described as victims of possession.images [images/icon.jpg]For the rest of the thirties, Max Knight had his work cut out for him.It is a matter of public record that in the six years after the Führer came topower, thirty agents suspected of working for Germany – twenty-one of whom werenative Britons – came to the attention of the British Security Service.‘Quantity, not quality in agents, seemed to be the aim,’ wrote the service’sdeputy director, Jack Curry, in a first official history of its pre-waractivities, ‘but it was and is impossible to say whether a cloud of agents oflow quality served to hide a few good ones.’Even though hostilities with Germany were seen as increasingly likely, theSoviet threat continued to overshadow everything else (as was the case with itssister service, MI6) until it was almost too late. Writing a few years later,Curry added that ‘it was obvious that in official but wider circles there was ageneral failure to appreciate the character of the Nazi Party’. Based in his newoffices in Dolphin Square, Max Knight’s M Section confined itself to communistand fascist organisations:But in 1938 it was obviously necessary to pay some attention to the desirabilityof having agents who could be used in connection with that branch of Germanespionage which had an affinity with either the NSDAP organisation – in GreatBritain, or pro-German societies and groups which did not properly fall underthe heading of the fascist bodies.On the eve of the fighting, the Security Service began to expand. In 1938, itstill numbered thirty officers and just over 100 secretaries. A year later, MI5recruited another 750 new staff. In a summary of his own work, Max Knightpointed out that he had only employed fourteen agents, one officer and onesecretary.He noted: ‘It will probably come as a surprise – even for personnel of theSecurity Service – to learn that during the vital years between 1935 and 1939,such a small number of agents was available to cover such a vast field of workof the first importance.’ The reason was lack of money, and the fact that goodinformation came out was as much due to good luck as anything. Improbably, hishappening upon one of the most beautiful women in London who was nothing morethan a glorified striptease artist would soon come to have an important impacton the secret war.images [images/icon.jpg]In the run-up to the fighting, then, any number of curious undercurrents andeven stranger characters were flowing around the periphery of the secret world.When the Nazis came to power, they regarded some sort of agreement with theBritish as highly attractive. Indeed, despite their later propaganda claimsdenigrating its excesses, the Nazis saw the British Empire as an exemplar theyshould follow. But they had no direct understanding of Britain, and the academicGerwin Strobl has written of ‘the extraordinary limited factual knowledge uponwhich the regime attempted to base its policies’.Yet the Führer was envious of the prestige of the British Secret IntelligenceService, MI6. Indeed, most of the German leaders had an unshakeable belief inthe power of the British secret service, so much so that when anything wentwrong, they would invoke its mysterious powers. At the time of its supposedgreatest influence, the secret service’s powers were limited. MI6 was hardly themost efficient and powerful organisation which the Nazis feared. As it was, aremarkable cast of characters was ready and waiting for the fighting which wouldsoon consume the whole of the globe, none more extravagantly than a couple ofwriters – and professional rivals – who found themselves squabbling on a trainin the halcyon spring before war broke out.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 It is a curious fact that the undoubted maestro of British deceptionactivities who was later based in the Middle East, Colonel Dudley Clarke, wasarrested in Madrid in 1941 for much the same reasons: he was caught dressed inwomen’s clothes. Though Clarke claimed it was part of an elaborate deception,the discomfiture from his arrest and photograph in feminine attire – whichextended to his wearing of a brassiere and pants –was curiously not exploited bythe Spanish security authorities who were close to the Abwehr.2 Known as Section VII, it would form part of the Reich Main Security Office(RSHA), which had been founded by Reinhard Heydrich and now included all thevarious arms of the police state – the Gestapo, the Kripo and theSicherheitsdienst.3 Much of the mystery surrounding these years comes from the fact many of thesources are anecdotal. For example, a writer called Porter refers to a McGilland gets other names wrong even when mentioning Knight. John Hope in his 1994paper veers on the side of him being fascistic.4 In the last year of Gwladys’s life, Knight had started work on a thriller,which even his sympathetic biographer calls ‘a dire mixture of Dashiell Hammettand Mickey Spillane, tinged with John Buchan’. A typical passage from CrimeCargo (Philip Allan, 1934), reads almost beyond parody:McGurk raised himself up on his elbow, his pig-eyes already glazing, the breathwhistling in his throat.‘You’ve got me – ye treacherous dago,’ he gasped. Then he fell back, bloodrunning from his mouth."},{"pageContent":"4FROM RUSSIA, WITH CONDOMS [contents.htm#a7]At the outbreak of the Second World War, the bodies which carried out[intelligence] functions for the British government were not so well organised,either individually or in terms of the co-ordination of their work, that theyconstituted an efficient system. They had been handicapped by financialstringency and by the lack of priority given to intelligence in the inter-waryears, disadvantages which were reflected less in the small size than in theindifferent quality of their staff.From the Official History of British Intelligence inthe Second World WarThe cold and colicky fear of a customs inspection at eight in the evening wasbad enough without mistrustful, white-gloved security officers in attendance.Yet as the Warsaw Express thundered on through the night, the searching wasinevitable. The two English journalists who were sharing a luxurious compartmentin a Pullman carriage were as impassive as only men of their class and callingcould ever be.Both found the inspection amusing, though probably for very different reasons.In some ways, they were as different as chalk and cheese. Physically, they werea study in contrasts: one was tall, languorous and, in the recollection of theother (who was larger and louder), had ‘the profile of a Tarquinian piper’.Together, they enjoyed a friendly rivalry, the mildest form of one-upmanshipwhich, at times such as this, saw them winding each other up.The two Englishmen watched, aloof and impassive.The mood changed suddenly when one of the guards found a packet of latexprophylactics and held each one of them up to the light. Their owner, for whomespionage and protected sexual intercourse became something of a métier,shrugged it all off. His companion, older and much more amused, was succinctafter the guards had departed.‘You should have swallowed them,’ Sefton Delmer said to Ian Fleming.The train continued on into the night with no further interruptions. It wasMarch 1939 and war, as a mutual friend of theirs would write, was ‘stridinginexorably across those months’. The younger, rather more suave of the pair, whohad actually been on a freelance spying mission in Moscow, would be providedwith the germ of an idea.The train journey in Eastern Europe – with all its inherent dangers andpermutations of menace – was stored in the ever fertile imagination to become aset-piece action sequence in a book which became the favourite reading of alater American president, whose father would shortly declare that the outbreakof hostilities meant the end of the world. But as John F. Kennedy – who claimedthat From Russia With Love was one of his favourite novels – would lateracknowledge, that halcyon spring, it wasn’t too late for the country to awakenfrom the slumbers of appeasement. ‘The result was that Britain felt secure inher defences,’ JFK himself would write, ‘and believed that if they would getthrough the winter without a knock-out blow England would have so built up herdefences that she would easily be able to outlast Germany.’images [images/icon.jpg]Today, the younger man on the Warsaw Express is known throughout the world, notleast for his remarkable literacy legacy which continues to promote the myth ofBritish pre-eminence in the secret world. Ian Fleming’s wartime experienceswould inform many of the later adventures of James Bond, though, sadly, the fameand vast fortunes he craved would prove elusive until the end of his life. Yet aformer MI6 chief has called 007 the best recruiting sergeant the service everhad and, as real-life officers have found, in Alan Judd’s apposite phrase, ‘youcan go to the most remote and enclosed communities in the world and say “I amfrom British Intelligence and I’d like you to help me” and get a response.’At the time of this trans-European train journey, though, Fleming was eclipsedby the career, accomplishments and sheer circumference of his companion. DenisSefton Delmer was a larger-than-life character, blimp-like but not at allColonel Blimp-like, with ‘a genial and Rabelaisian nature’ in the estimation ofone colleague. Delmer was a well-known journalist and bon vivant celebrated forhis various visits to the capitals of Europe. To most of its readers, herepresented everything that was admirable about the pre-war Daily Express, forwhom he was chief foreign correspondent.That he would eventually be overshadowed by his younger companion, there waslittle doubt in his own mind. Even then, Sefton Delmer formed the impressionthat the indolent old Etonian who had been representing The Times on theirjourney to the Soviet Union was something more than a reporter. ‘As soon as Isaw him,’ he recalled, ‘I knew he was on some intelligence job or other.’As to what exactly, the files are somewhat opaque.‘Mysteriously seconded’ seems to be the best way to describe what he had been upto. Ian Fleming, Delmer later added, tongue in cheek, ‘seemed to be acting thepart of one of the Secret Service men he had read about in E. PhillipsOppenheim’ – a famous interwar spy novelist. Pravda would come to hold the sameview and, at the height of Bondmania in the mid-sixties, railed about the twinevils of Western decadence and such bourgeois symbols as 007 himself. ‘Hiscreator is Ian Fleming, who posed as The Times correspondent in Russia in 1939but was in truth a spy for the capitalist nations’.Sure enough, on their return to London, Fleming submitted a lengthy report tothe Foreign Office on the state of the Soviet armed forces. The condoms, hethought with characteristic ingenuity, could also be analysed for their rubbercontent, a telltale indicator of the state of Soviet industry. Very little hadchanged in the six years he had been away from the country since his firstvisit. Stalin’s Russia was still as grim and menacing as it had been in 1933,when Fleming had reported the trial of Metro-Vickers engineers accused ofespionage (at which the chief prosecutor had declared that C was the ‘powerbehind the throne’, so convinced was he – like the Nazis – of the omniscience ofthe British Secret Service).If anything, the USSR was now even more depressing, for the dead hand ofStalin’s paranoia seemed more pervasive. Their trip to Moscow was ostensiblypart of a trade mission, where Fleming, again in his friend’s knowingestimation, ‘introduced me to some very enjoyable characters’. Many, SeftonDelmer later realised, would have fitted nicely into a James Bond story. The twoBritish journalists spent a fruitless evening searching out the private flat ofthe Commissar for Foreign Affairs – and instead booked into a suite in theNational Hotel. A junior member of the British Embassy, Fitzroy Maclean, camelooking for Ian Fleming later that night.He found The Times writer in bed with a girl. With typical aplomb, Ian Flemingapologised to Maclean that he wouldn’t be able to join them for dinner. He was,as Maclean later explained to his wife, ‘very, very busy’. Fleming’s femalecompanion was one of a pair from Odessa whom he and Delmer had picked up in thebar of their hotel. Whether joking or not, Fleming left the lower half of hissilk pyjamas as a present for his own particular girl.1Small wonder, Fleming always claimed he enjoyed the visit. Ever tongue in cheek,he claimed that the Soviet capital was akin to the Gorbals – a well-known slumof the period – in Glasgow. The paranoia engendered by the unknown hand ofSoviet Security remained palpable. Throughout their time in Moscow, Ian Flemingand Sefton Delmer were constantly tailed. On one occasion, the car followingthem burst one of its tyres. Obligingly, their own official driver waited whileit was fixed before driving off again, a scene reminiscent of the cat and mouseantics of the Russians in the film version of From Russia With Love.images [images/icon.jpg]That Ian Fleming and Sefton Delmer had first met in appropriately authenticcircumstances of mystery and intrigue in pre-war Moscow is significant for thesecret war to come. They were drawn to each other not least because they werejournalists. Both Fleming (the scion of an illustrious banking family) andDelmer (because of his Australian parentage) were outsiders. More exotically,Delmer had actually been born in Berlin and had even been repatriated during theGreat War when he was 13. After a scholarship to Lincoln College, he joinedBeaverbrook’s Daily Express in its pre-war heyday. When hostilities broke out,the fact Delmer was born in Berlin and knew all the Nazi leaders personally wasactually held against him.Fleming, the youngest son of a banking dynasty, was the nearest to an outsiderwithin the gilded cage of the Establishment. To some, his aloofness was typicalof the withdrawn superiority of the old Etonian; to others, part and parcel ofthe introspection of his family.Yet – no pun intended – they bonded.Tongue in cheek, Fleming’s one-upmanship extended to the literary milieu. Heincluded a sly reference to his friend in the novel Diamonds Are Forever –‘Isn’t that chap Sefton Delmer a boyfriend of yours, Lil?’ 007 asks his glacialsecretary, Loelia Ponsonby, one of the few characters who was never transferredto the big screen versions of the books.Within months, they would both make their mark on the secret world, particularlywhen Fleming took his friend to lunch and disingenuously announced: ‘I have beengiven a special desk job at the Admiralty.’ In this way Ian Fleming would lethis closest friend know that he had been drawn into the secret world as aspecial assistant to the head of the venerable Naval Intelligence Division, whohad merely specified that he wanted ‘the outlandish, the unorthodox and theinspired’ to be available to him. In Lieutenant Fleming RNVR he got all three,and within weeks, his success and charm inspired the First Sea Lord no less toremark that he was one of those people who could see in the dark.That acuity would be needed to work through the mire of operations concerningpropaganda and psychological warfare. Aiming to drive a wedge between the Führerand his people, inducing ‘war-weariness and defeatism by every means, open andclandestine’, the greater plans in Whitehall were farcical and futile to thepoint of absurdity. For the next couple of years, infighting, lack ofco-ordination and personal enmities would come to characterise the greater storyof British wartime propaganda.Equally pervasive myths and shadows would consume his travelling companion onthat pre-war journey, for at the start of his life, Denis Sefton Delmer had beeninterned as an enemy alien in Berlin during the Great War. Universally known asTom, it was Delmer’s curious fate to have been in Berlin, where his father was awell-known lecturer in English literature. As a later stringer for newspapers,Delmer was determined to enjoy the many social excesses of the Weimar Republic,reporting with relish and enjoyment stories of scandal and corruption. He wasfascinated by the variety of charlatans of one form or another who wereflourishing in the country. When he first attended a meeting of the NationalSocialist Party in 1929, Delmer soon considered Adolf Hitler a lunatic forexhorting his audience not to eat foreign fruit such as oranges.His own appetites were vast. With the outbreak of the next war, as his son FelixDelmer ruefully remarks, weighing seventeen stone (240lb) meant Tom Delmer couldhardly take part in the fighting. Ironically, the security authorities were waryof him and his German background appeared more sinister than it was, so was heldagainst him rather than seen as an asset.With his near-fluent German, Delmer thought he was ideally qualified to become aspy or at least help in the evaluation and interpretation of intelligence. ‘Iknew something of the mentality of Germans at war from having been at school asa lone English boy in starving Berlin during the first war,’ he reminisced.After his strange visit to Moscow in the company of Ian Fleming, Delmer managed– just – to stay ahead of trouble. He was still working for the Daily Express inWarsaw when the first bombs landed, and escaped through Romania before making itback to London. He became an official war correspondent, attached to the FrenchArmy. Delmer managed to escape from Paris just hours before the Germans arrivedand thence undertook a nerve-wracking journey to Bordeaux and back home.Ultimately, Tom Delmer was one of those innumerable square pegs who would notfit into any predetermined circular holes. It would not be long before feelerswere extended towards him from the secret world, and when they did, he wouldseize it as hungrily as he could.images [images/icon.jpg]That spring of 1939, it was clear that war would not be long in coming.The Naval Intelligence Division had, like most arms of British Intelligence,been neglected since the end of the Great War. At the start of the year, a newDirector of Naval Intelligence was appointed; when he took over, Admiral JohnGodfrey would admit that he did not know much about intelligence. But, in thetime-honoured way of all clever operators, he took care to find enough peoplewho did.As raging torrents of information swept into the Admiralty, Godfrey would ensurethe right people got exactly the right information they needed. If nothing else,he was a superb organiser, so his biographer attests, ‘of the devices andunscrupulous art of Intelligence’. Thanks to his energy, determination andenquiring mind, the eyes and ears of the King’s Navy were finally gearing up forthe inevitable.Under Godfrey’s stewardship, Naval Intelligence was soon ahead of the game witha shipshape sense of its purpose. ‘Both MI5 and MI6 tended to be amateurish andold-fashioned in their outlook and methods,’ writes Patrick Beesley in hisbiography of Godfrey, Very Special Admiral, ‘a weakness that was to becomepainfully apparent before the war was three months old.’Ironically, the German naval attaché in London was in agreement. ‘The Admiraltyappears to have exerted to place one of their best officers in this importantposition,’ Godfrey’s biographer records. With a stern, weather-beaten face, theDirector of Naval Intelligence had, in the later estimation of one who workedwith him, the manner of a relentless advocate. He would never suffer fools and,as yet another recalled, ‘with his own quick and penetrating mind he expectedothers to keep up’. Another who knew him well got to the heart of the matter byobserving that he was nothing less than ‘exacting, inquisitive, energetic and,at times, a ruthless and impatient master’. Arousing admiration, loyalty anddownright antagonism in other departments, Godfrey was, in short, the hardest oftaskmasters.The admiral was a seasoned naval officer who was regarded as one of the bestnavigators in the service. Godfrey had patrolled the Yangtse in a gunboat,sabotaged munition dumps in Sebastopol and most recently commanded HMS Repulsein the Mediterranean at the time of the Spanish Civil War. When he was appointedas DNI in early January 1939, his most immediate task echoed that of his mostillustrious predecessor. In the Great War, ‘Blinker’ Hall had found astockbroker to act as his assistant.2Godfrey, through contacts that included the Governor of the Bank of England,sent out feelers to search out the same. One name kept cropping up. Ironically,very little had ever been expected of this dilettante old Etonian, for up untilnow, he had been something of a dabbling failure at everything he had turned hishand to. Word soon spread that ‘someone rather dim in the city who happens to bePeter Fleming’s brother’ had been appointed at the very heart of BritishIntelligence. To many it was a great surprise, for they were inclined to dismisshim as nothing less than a mountebank, often supercilious and aloof.In so many ways, though, the appointment of Ian Lancaster Fleming was aninspired choice, particularly when later working in harness with his old friendSefton Delmer. Fleming was, as Admiral Godfrey would later write, ‘the man forthe job’ and, in this way, more by oversight than anything, James Bond’s futurecreator was able to make his mark in areas like propaganda, subversion and pressmanipulation, along with prompting the creation of both psychological andpolitical warfare. Along with his pre-war friend and rival, they wouldeventually take it to literally new heights and, in the admiral, Fleming wouldencounter the prototype for the steely, imperturbable M of the later Bondnovels.images [images/icon.jpg]The most obvious ingredient for those later stories – ‘sex, sadism and snobbery’in one famously shrill review of Dr. No – contrasted the fact that the formerwas seen as more of a hindrance in real-world espionage. That was certainly theview of yet another supposed candidate for the role of M,3 Maxwell Knight, whoseown aversion to physical satisfaction with women has been well chronicled. Thiswas reflected in his views on running female agents which, in some ways, werecuriously liberated for the time. Knight supported the use of female agents andtook care to dismiss a ‘very long-standing and ill-founded prejudice’ againstthem.‘A clever woman who can use her personal attractions wisely has in her armoury avery formidable weapon,’ Knight recorded. If a woman was a casual interest – asin just a short-term fling based on physical attractiveness – then a male sourceof potential information ‘will very speedily lose interest in her once hisimmediate object is attained’. If the reasons for the contact had more to dowith companionship and sympathy (‘than merely those of physical satisfaction’),a woman would make a much better and longer-term agent. The best way to ensurethat female agents did not fall in love with the men upon whom they were spyingwas simple: steer clear of femme fatales.After the Great War, such temptresses were considered to be the worst sort ofrecruits. Maxwell Knight namechecks Mata Hari as a figure whose greater famecame thanks to her lovers rather than any accumulated wisdom or activity inespionage. ‘I am no believer in what might be described as Mata Hari methods,’he wrote in a post-war review of his activities. ‘I am convinced that moreinformation has been obtained by women agents by keeping out of the arms of theman, than was ever obtained by sinking too willingly into them.’4Though in the modern era many of these musings sound rather like the unabashedcomments of a fully paid-up, card-carrying misogynist, at the time – not leastafter the trauma of his first wife’s death – Max Knight was a new man by thestandards of the day. He took care to note that his own experience showed womenwere not the neurotic creatures many dismissed them as (‘ruled by their emotionsand not their brains’, ‘intuition rather than reason’ and ‘that sex will play anunsettling and dangerous role in their work’) and were valuable recruits.A further insight into his attitudes came from his peremptory dismissal ofagents of his own gender. ‘Taking him generally, Man is a conceited creature,while woman is a vain creature,’ Knight wrote. ‘Conceit and vanity are not thesame.’ The former, Knight added, made men indiscreet, especially when trying toimpress women, for which ‘their outlet for this form of self-expression is theirpersonal appearance, dress etc.’ Knight also noted that as well as her sexualallure, closely allied – and ultimately more important – was ‘the quality ofsympathy’. ‘[N]othing is easier for a woman to gain a man’s confidence [than] bythe showing and expression of a little sympathy; this cannot be done by anundersexed woman.’He had chosen well. None of his agents seemed to have fallen in love with thepeople they were spying on. In his own life, though, matters were morecomplicated. By the time he had written these words, Knight had married again,to a pretty young woman ten years his junior by the name of Lois Coplestone.Though clearly distraught about the death of Gwladys, his new bride was charmedby him and consoled him through his grief. ‘We didn’t lead much of a sociallife,’ Lois later told Anthony Masters, ‘and often we used to sit in the dark inSloane Street because it was the animals’ bedtime.’Fairly swiftly, Max had installed her in his flat, which by now housed a whitebull-terrier, a bullfinch, snakes, salamanders, an incontinent bush-baby, a bearcub, a baboon, monkeys, rats and several birds – including a blue-fronted Amazonparrot who took a virulent dislike to her. Ominously, Lois Knight became awareof something disturbing: how her husband liked to control people. And accordingto another woman who later worked closely with Max Knight, behind that carefreefaçade of a happily married man was, in reality, a repressed homosexual who hadan interest in rough trade. Or at least that was the claim of Joan Miller, wholater wrote a book which, ridiculously, the British government tried to ban in1986.One Girl’s War was fairly harmless, containing, as one review put it, ‘all theingredients of a class yarn – deceit, double bluff, clandestine meetings andfinding betrayal’. Later, using her real name of Joanna Phipps, this particularMiller’s tale reads more like a cross between an Enid Blyton story and a Millsand Boon romance than a systematic attempt to subvert state secrets from fourdecades earlier. Joan Miller herself could have walked straight in from adrawing room comedy, a spirited, upper class ‘gel’ so typical of the time. Yetbeneath the surface, Joan Miller was clearly lonely, restless and rootless. Herstory is tinged with the sadness that her father had gambled away the family’smoney, as a result of which her mother had turned to drink.Working as a mail clerk at Elizabeth Arden, one of her school friends wasworking for MI5 and politely enquired if she would like to join. ‘I want all mygirls to be well bred,’ the director of the service, Vernon Kell, had decreed,‘and have good legs.’ In this regard, she seemed to fit in. She quickly cameinto the orbit of the general’s most illustrious agent runner. In some accounts,Joan Miller was like a lovelorn puppy in Max Knight’s presence and would,another recruit said, follow him to the ends of the earth. Joan quickly becameenthralled by Maxwell’s magnetic personality, which bordered on hero worship.Yet, as she freely admitted, she found him a paradox.Fairly close to the surface he exhibited any number of unappealing prejudices,such as a marked aversion to Jews, gays and communists. Intriguingly, Joanseemed to think ‘his intolerant attitude wasn’t altogether consistent’.Sometimes, he seemed to parody himself and, in time, his lustre palled as shebecame increasingly embittered by his never seeming to notice how smitten shewas. In other words, she may not be the most reliable of witnesses.Many of her claims are all the more puzzling for others had noted Max Knight’sown intuition when hiring people. He had an uncanny ability to get under theskin of people – something he approved of in others when they tried to recruitagents, especially females. ‘That a woman’s intuition is sometimes amazinglyhelpful and amazingly correct has been well established,’ Knight noted, ‘andgiven the right guiding hand, this ability can at times save an IntelligenceOfficer an enormous amount of trouble.’images [images/icon.jpg]When, in the early stages of the war, Tom Delmer went to visit Ian Fleming atthe Admiralty, he could – like several others – sense that his friend was in hiselement. Room 39, Delmer thought, was vaguely reminiscent of a busy bank inTangier. Later termed ‘that legendary room through which all the Navy’s secretspassed’, it was the bustling antechamber to Admiral Godfrey’s inner sanctum nextdoor. It was, as Andrew Lycett has aptly termed it, nothing less than the bridgeof Godfrey’s ship.To call in his staff, the admiral employed a deliciously camp nautical touchwhich Ian Fleming doubtless enjoyed: the DNI simply rang a bell with the Morseletter which indicated the surname of the officer he wanted to speak to. To TomDelmer’s amusement, Fleming was wreathed in cigarette smoke, sitting in hischair by a large corner window. The DNI’s assistant always liked to claim thathe was prone to suffering corns on the backside. When he took his friend in tosee ‘Uncle John’ (as the admiral was called, and not always affectionately), theencounter was startling. Delmer later recalled him as having silver hair and thekindest, shrewdest eyes he had even seen.Room 39 had twenty or so hand-picked officers who collated information fromamongst the chaos and echoing cacophony of noise. Fleming’s colleagues satamongst tightly packed desks, surrounded by ever-increasing mountains of paper.All this frantic activity was accompanied by the constant clack of typewritersand the ceaseless ringing of telephones. Fleming appeared to be chief clerk inthe mêlée of seven commanders, one captain, two lieutenants, two civilianassistants and four female secretaries, along with female admirers or anyoneelse who happened to be walking by.Each day the tall, languorous old Etonian would enter Room 39 to enquire archlyof a stiff colleague just to annoy him: ‘I say Quacker, what’s happening?’ Mostin Naval Intelligence – including the intended recipient called Charles Drake –ignored his barbs. The most fertile imagination in Room 39 of the Admiraltyinvariably indulged his whims.Yet typically, ‘Quacker’ Drake became one of Fleming’s greatest fans.Because most of those people surrounding and outranking him were peacetime navalofficers, they suffered from what Fleming called ‘Senior officer veneration’. AsDrake later explained, that meant ‘you were always a bit nervous of somebodyfiring questions at you [who] was wearing twice as many stripes as you werewearing’.Fleming didn’t have that. He would speak to people as equals and get his ownway. He knew most people – either socially or from school – and was on firstname terms with them. Fleming’s list of social contacts was astounding, oftenmeeting them in the Dorchester Hotel, which his future wife Anne called the‘gilded bird-cage of the rich’. In his naval reserve uniform, he was invariablydismissed by some of his social clique as a ‘chocolate sailor’ – someone who hadnever been to sea or taken part in any action.Yet despite the sneers, Lieutenant Fleming, RNVR, had taken to the navy withcharacteristic self-possession and, against all expectations, revelled in thepaperwork. The nature of his work was perplexing and restless. Despite the fact,as another colleague famously joked, that Fleming ‘hated anything in triplicate– except a large martini’, his reporting background helped. The DNI’s fixer was,in Drake’s estimation, brilliant at ‘drafting papers without being verbose’which, in the Royal Navy, guaranteed action would be taken.Fairly soon, Room 39 would reach far beyond its remit of co-ordinatinginformation that streamed into the Admiralty, which was ‘regularly coming fromhere, there and everywhere’. Ian Fleming soon became Godfrey’s emollient and, inhis own words, ‘a convenient channel for confidential matters connected withsubversive organisations’. In another colleague’s estimation, nobody was able tojolly along the obstinate admiral more effectively than his special assistant.Fleming was simply brilliant, the best kind of ideas man who, working in harnesswith his boss, would come to make their own unique contributions to theprosecution of the secret war.images [images/icon.jpg]For all his railing against the use of femme fatales, Maxwell Knight did makegood use of one particularly beautiful and beguiling woman who lured theunsuspected to reveal information – or more besides. In pre-war café society,the stunning female with the Viennese accent would be able to make her way inthe higher echelons of society, listening in to tittle-tattle and titbits ofgossip. After all, her sister was often to be found sitting in a seashell like asiren of old5 and somehow had married the brother of a rising star in BritishIntelligence.Friedle Gärtner was well connected. Working as a part-time informant for MaxKnight, he later noted, she ‘did very excellent work for us between 1938 and theoutbreak of war’. By posing as a Nazi sympathiser to flush out potential fifthcolumnists, Friedle had used her looks to gain confidences. Today, she would becalled a knockout. Then, the pukka chaps merely noted, ‘there is no doubtwhatever about her very considerable personal attractiveness’.That new year of 1939 had seen Maxwell Knight write a letter to his old friendDennis Wheatley to introduce her as a potential ‘research assistant’. They hadalready discussed her and, as Max noted, ‘it is absolutely essential for thescheme and her own peace of mind that she should not suspect that the job is notan entirely genuine one’. This particular ménage à trois adhered to another ofMax Knight’s approaches in recruiting people. ‘[It] is nearly always necessaryfor our official contact to call in some colleague,’ he noted, who would thentell someone else, ‘and though it is perhaps a little sweeping to say that asecret between three persons is no secret’, at least there would be a sense oftrust between them all.But then a typical complication arose.In Joan Miller’s account, Friedle had also fallen in love with Max Knight, butrealised that Joan herself was already – at least in her own mind – maitresse entitre. A good time girl, Friedle Gärtner was always forgetting the curfew orbeing picked up by the police, thrown into a black Mariah and finding herself inlock-ups with ladies of the night. ‘The clothes we wore in those days were verytarty,’ Joan Miller said about the both of them. According to Joan, Friedle usedto call Tommy Thompson of Special Branch to get her out.Even though there was a war on, she didn’t seem to have a care in the world. Shewould fall in and out of love – and dresses, too. One of her devoted swains wasBill Younger, Knight’s protégé and Dennis Wheatley’s step-son, who consulted hismother on what sort of ring to propose to her with. Joan Wheatley was, to saythe least, horrified.Thankfully the engagement never happened and Friedle carried on much as before,a cross between flibbertigibbet and smouldering siren. For Friedle, at least,one marriage had been enough. A gentile by birth, she had worked in her nativeVienna as a stenographer and, in 1934, married into a very Orthodox Jewishfamily. Though she emigrated with her husband for Palestine, the marriage wasnot successful. ‘I can’t tell you how frightful it was,’ she later told afriend. In the meantime, her sister, Lisle, had married Major Ian Menzies of theScots Guards, who just happened to be the brother of the Chief of the SecretIntelligence Service.This would prove to be her most useful connection in the secret world.Sir Stewart Menzies saw that Friedle could become a useful agent overseas, eventhough she wanted to remain in the United Kingdom with her sister. ‘Her reasonfor coming to me is that her sister married a brother of mine,’ C noted in aletter to MI5 in May 1938, ‘and it is with these relations that she istemporarily staying.’Both Knight and Miller used to stay at Ian Menzies’ house or party amongst hiswell-to-do set. ‘The family was rich and Ian’s house was pretty opulent, as Iremember it, without containing a single tasteless item,’ recalled Joan (whobecame a good friend of Friedle’s). The parties, she recalls, involved gamblingand the most memorable attendees were ‘Greek shipping magnates, middle-aged,lecherous and wearing pure silk shirts’.In time, Friedle would be introduced to even more exotic specimens from thesecret world. For now, as a native German speaker, she was soon attending eventsat the Anglo-German Fellowship, which included dinners and cocktail parties.After the Anschluss in her native land, she had called at the German Embassy tooffer her congratulations. She even tried to join the Arbeitsfront – the GermanLabour Front, to which waiters and barmen were often accredited – though it hadproved rather more difficult than she expected. A typical ‘Nazi Prussian’, asshe described him, had barked, unconvinced: ‘Why are you here anyway? You hadbetter go home.’images [images/icon.jpg]A strange sense of uneasiness accompanied Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’sannouncement over the BBC at 11.15 a.m. on the first Sunday in September 1939that ‘this country is at war with Germany’. Within minutes, an unidentifiedaircraft – later revealed to be a French courier plane – triggered an air-raidwarning. At the same time, the congregation in St Paul’s Cathedral were singinga hymn with the lines:‘O God of love, O king of peace –Make wars throughout the world to cease’when the sirens sounded. The service was temporarily abandoned and continued alittle while later in the crypt.All the terrifying predictions about aerial bombardment which had preoccupiedthe population before the war now crystallised into public panic. ‘In Londonthere was an air of 1918 and even a touch of 1665,’ one author would write. ‘Notsince the Great Plague had there been such a flight to the country.’ Schools andswimming baths were prepared to receive corpses; a million women and childrenwere taken outside the capital to live with strangers; and 8,000 TB patientswere sent home from hospital and – in a marvel of epidemiological control – toldnot to cough over young people. Their beds, they were told in all seriousness,would be needed to accommodate the victims of bombing. Within days, newspaperswere no longer carrying weather forecasts in case they gave aid to the enemy.Soon, they were reporting another very curious phenomenon. ‘Englishmen werespeaking to each other.’Yet for all these apocalyptic pronouncements, there were no massed raids byGerman bombers nor tidal waves of casualties. More civilians were killed overthe next two months from road accidents than any indiscriminate bombing.Reluctance was also apparent at the highest levels. While the army dug trenchesin Hyde Park, the Cabinet argued over its strategy for bombing Germany. When itwas later proposed that German forests should be set alight, the air minister –a former insurance consultant – was horrified.‘Are you aware that it is private property?’ Sir Kingsley Wood exclaimed. ‘Why,you will be asking me to bomb Essen next.’A more refined approach was attempted with what was termed ‘bomph’, leafletsthat were printed up to try to alter the population’s view of the fighting.Greater numbers of leaflets than bombs were dropped by the Royal Air Force inthose first few weeks of war. There was a feeling that if done properly,propaganda would turn the Deutsches Volk against their leaders.But how? It was a simple question with a ridiculously bureaucratic answer.As with much of the subversive activities undertaken by the British governmentat the start of the war, there was no coherence nor clarity of purpose betweenthe trio of separate agencies whose ‘objectives were obscure and overlapping,their relations to older departments ill-defined and often bad-tempered’. As areaction to the Munich crisis, a senior Air Ministry officer realised thatpropaganda could fill the gap to show British grit and determination. ‘A sort ofdepartment,’ he loftily proclaimed, ‘should be set up which would let all theworld know that the lion had teeth and would use them.’ Kingsley Wood, theminister who didn’t want to bomb private property, caught the ear of the primeminister. Sir Campbell Stuart, a Canadian who had worked under Lord Northcliffeduring the Great War, was given four rooms, three staff, one typewriter and thewherewithal to keep quiet.‘There is only one answer to a lie,’ he would declare, ‘the truth even if youhave to bend it a little.’ It was kept off the books as CS or Electra House, EH,close by the Embankment on the Temple. As M.R.D. Foot termed it, Stuart ‘was noGoebbels, but he collected a few sensible journalists and broadcasters aroundhim’. But no sense of common purpose was forthcoming and something as simple asdropping leaflets became a very different battleground.The night war broke out, the Cabinet discussed dropping propaganda leaflets inthe hope of having ‘an important effect on German opinion’. From the outset, itwas only ever envisaged as the military equivalent to ringing a doorbell andthen running off. ‘Bomber units of the Royal Air Force carried out a leafletraid on Western Germany during the night,’ Alvar Liddell would later broadcaston the BBC. ‘None of our aircraft is missing.’ Chamberlain, delighted to be ableto ‘speak’ to the German nation, never really appreciated what was being done inhis name.The dropping of propaganda leaflets and leafleting was half-hearted. An AirMinistry official had the right to veto – in case it brought about retaliation –any material that was prepared. The leaflets themselves were translated intoGerman by a mining engineer called Schmidt, who seemed to have walked in fromcentral casting so far as pedantic Teutons was concerned.‘The results were not good,’ recalled the person in charge.There was incessant wangling over costs and bailiwick disputes between theTreasury and the Foreign Office. Much more time and effort was wasted on arguingfor its own sake and what one historian aptly termed ‘an inter-departmental gameof beggar-my-neighbour’ resulted which would need a firecracker to sort it allout into something coherent and useful.images [images/icon.jpg]It was hardly an act of hagiographical toadying that the title of a splendidbiography of Admiral John Godfrey was called A Very Special Admiral. Like hisassistant, Godfrey was used to thinking outside the box when it came todeceiving the enemy and, as he later noted, ‘to be successful, false scents mustbe laid and something done to tempt the enemy to the spot’. The interests of theDirector of Naval Intelligence were suitably eclectic, especially with what hetermed ‘deception, ruses de guerre, passing on false information, and so on’. Ashe would write a few weeks later after the outbreak of war, all came under the‘general heading of deception and “dirty work” – which, for some reason isregarded as the DNI’s prerogative’.Perhaps that was the legacy of the Machiavellian Blinker Hall. Yet a new war andtechnology which accompanied it ushered in great changes. As his biographernotes, Godfrey would ‘almost certainly be confronted with a whole range ofproblems which had not existed in Hall’s day’. The admiral’s own attitudes towhat were generally termed ‘the funnies’ had been informed by a curious pre-warexperience at sea. While on duty in the Mediterranean, as he noted for therecords, Godfrey ‘once saw a large red turtle, east of Gibraltar, 4–5 milesaway, floating idly on the surface. It looked very like the red head of atorpedo for which we were searching.’So a few weeks after war broke out, Admiral Godfrey made the first ever notes onthe subject of dirty tricks, deceptions and decoys. They are worth examininggiven some of the operations which later came to have the admiral’s imprimaturupon them. In his lapidary way, Godfrey noted that the difficulty behind anysuch operations was how to get the information across and the quality of thatinformation itself. And nobody would do it better, ‘probably’, the admiralnoted, than the British.He went through a number of ideas and warned that they might be somewhatfantastic, ‘but nevertheless contain germs of what I feel to be some goodideas’. The more you examine them, he reasoned, the less fantastic they seem toappear. All would culminate in perhaps the most fantastical of all, the infamous‘Man Who Never Was’ operation. Despite a recent hyped book on the subject,Admiral Godfrey was behind the idea – though it was ‘not a very nice one’, as hetermed it. This would involve a corpse dressed as an airman, as though hisparachute had failed (‘I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpsesat the Naval Hospital, but, of course, it would have to be a fresh one’).Other ideas proposed by the admiral could equally have been employed by Q branchin the later Bond films. Removing food from enemy ships and making them morepalatable by use of plausible instructions to be printed on the outside was one.‘Explosives and means of detonation might thus be introduced into enemysubmarines,’ he minuted, an idea that, sadly, never seemed to see the light ofday.Nothing – no matter how outrageous – would be rejected as possible weapons inthe fight for survival which would come. It helped that the admiral could callupon an imagination as fertile as that of Ian Lancaster Fleming. For the writerwho effortlessly created a memorable hero and macabre villains became theinitiator for other irregular projects at the start of the war. LieutenantFleming was interested in the use of rumour, disinformation and propaganda. Hesuggested metal discs with a five mark note on one side and a propaganda imageon the other, forging German currency and a radio propaganda ship, a kind ofRadio Caroline that would draw German fire and ire (‘the tone of the broadcastsshould be peremptory and occasionally scornful’).images [images/icon.jpg]For all those who knew him, Ian Fleming was, for all his indolent dilettantism,in his element at the Admiralty. Robert Harling, who knew him well during thesewar years, later wrote that he became his own brand image for James Bond aroundthis time. ‘He had a sad, bony, fateful face, strong featured and with veryclear eyes,’ Harling wrote in an appreciation a few days after his friend diedin August 1964. It was illuminating, he said, when the two old friends haddiscussed the war years, Harling had suggested that most middle-aged men seethemselves as between the ages of 28 and 32. It was significant that when warbroke out, Fleming was 31. James Bond’s creator grinned by saying ‘touché’.The literary father of James Bond would represent the admiral at meetings hedidn’t have the time – nor inclination – to attend. In this way, more byoversight than anything, Fleming was able to make his mark in new, oftenbizarre, forms of warfare. These included subjects like propaganda, subversionand press manipulation, along with developing psychological and politicalwarfare as the fighting progressed.As Admiral Godfrey was to remark, war changed intelligence officers fromCinderella into princesses.6 Ian Fleming not only went to the ball like thatmythical figure, but had one, too. It would be too easy – as some morequestionable accounts have done – to read too much into Fleming’s own wartimesecret service. Yet it should be noted that, like so many others, Fleming wasnever inculcated into the greatest intelligence secret of the war. Ultra, thefruit of the labours of the codebreakers at Bletchley Park, was known only to ahandful of people at the apex of the secret world.James Bond’s creator was pointedly excluded from knowing about the unlocking ofthe Enigma machine. That probably explains one of his more hare-brained schemes,which he proposed the following autumn of 1940.7 Operation Ruthless would,according to a note he minuted Admiral Godfrey, have seen Royal Naval personnelpretending to be a shot down crew of a German bomber. By luring an air-searescue boat to retrieve them, they could, Fleming suggested, then hijack theaircraft and steal its Enigma codes. Ultimately, the Bletchley codebreakers werehelped when sailors retrieved the settings from a sinking U-boat in October1942, at a terrible human cost.8images [images/icon.jpg]For all these daydreams, Ian Fleming remained deskbound for most of the war andwas never a man of action like the mythical hero he came to create. ‘He wasn’tJames Bond,’ one of his Naval Intelligence colleagues would caution, ‘he was apen pusher like all of us.’Yet occasionally, Fleming would employ the kinds of rascals who seemed to thinkthat they were. And for that, some genuinely wild and crazy plans that wouldsnugly fit into the earlier James Bond films seem to have been sanctioned in theearly part of the war. ‘What nonsense they were,’ Fleming would later writedisparagingly, ‘those romantic, Red Indian daydreams so many of us indulged inat the beginning of the war – to blow up the Iron Gates of the Danube.’The latter, concerning the great arterial river of central Europe, were a casein point. The Iron Gates are a gorge which forced the flow of the Danube into 25miles of dangerous narrows below Orsova. In strategic terms, they acted as achokepoint between Romania and Yugoslavia, which commended them as a targetbecause of German interest in Romanian oil. Even though difficult to transportand higher in cost than the market value – along with copper, chromium andmanganese – Romanian supplies were important in feeding the Nazi war machine.In some accounts, Fleming turned his mind to doing something about it.So enters our story a remarkable buccaneer who – in his own mind, at least – wasa prototypical 007. Others have termed Merlin Minshall a ‘reach-me-down JamesBond’ who, in the tongue-in-cheek estimation of one official historian ofintelligence, ‘shared Bond’s susceptibility to blondes’. In his obituary in TheTimes from 1987, Minshall was termed ‘a rumbustious adventurer who was bornthree or four centuries too late’. Others have portrayed him more as aMunchausen-like fantasist whose claims, even today, are hard to establish asthey have the barest basis in reality.The son of a newspaper proprietor and nephew of a baronet, Minshall had sailedacross Europe as an antidote to the tedium of studying architecture. He became aracing driver and somehow – like Ian Fleming – ended up a sub lieutenant in theRoyal Navy Volunteer Reserve, though, as his obituarist noted, ‘his was not inany sense a subordinate temperament’.Inevitably, he got on with Fleming, through whom he claimed he found a suitablysurreal sinecure with a junior consular post in Belgrade. It was here that, in1939, Merlin Minshall became a very different sort of architect of what onenewspaper later termed a plan ‘as flamboyant as the RAF’s Dambusters raid’.While there were a number of operations aimed at the Iron Gates, Minshall tookpart, in his own account, in a series of Bond-like adventures, all told in aracy autobiography that was ruined – in one reviewer’s tart estimation – byinaccuracy and bombast. In this overheated account, Gilt Edged, Minshall claimsthat he travelled around Mitteleuropa with a cyanide capsule embedded inside atooth, detonators stored inside a false-bottomed suitcase and had highexplosives disguised as toffees sent via the diplomatic bag.The Germans, in his account, were on to him and – with shades of From RussiaWith Love – he dropped poison into the drink of a German and then booted him outof a lavatory window on a train. All this was carried out against the backdropof trying to block the oil supplies that passed through the Iron Gates bysinking barges. After failing to bribe local pilots, a couple of dozen RoyalNaval ratings manned half a dozen ships which would then cause mayhem at thebottleneck. The denouement was equally improbable: unconvincingly acting as artstudents, the ratings were thwarted from planting bombs when the Germans stoleMinshall’s stock of fuel.‘No matter how preposterous it might be considered,’ Len Deighton wrote, ‘all ofhis references seem to check out.’Others begged to differ. When Minshall first claimed these stories in 1975, ahornet’s nest of criticism was stirred – leaving many others shaken – not leastwith public identification that the main animator of the plans was MickeyMason,9 another remarkable character who was an ex-naval boxer. According tonewspaper accounts, Mason’s plan was to have used 5 tons of explosive to blow upthe banks of the Romanian side of the Danube, which would then block the IronGates.But was Ian Fleming involved? When the noted military historian Ronald Lewincame to review Merlin Minshall’s book for The Listener, he noted that all ofMerlin Minshall’s claims were called into doubt. ‘Even the sophisticated IanFleming is made to talk like a character by Dornford Yates,’ he wrote. There isa certain irony that Yates, too, is best known today for his clubland snobbery,xenophobia and silly-ass Englishness, along with another near contemporary whowas finding his own berth in the secret world hard to find.images [images/icon.jpg]Despite the appearance of chaos and lingering claims from its more dismissiveparticipants, Naval Intelligence – as Ian Fleming’s most recent biographer hasnoted – was the most professional arm of British Intelligence in the openingweeks of the war. Its ascendancy was assured with a simple yet unequivocalcommunication that went out high priority via the short wave transmitters atPortishead. Routed from the Admiralty to every ship in the King’s Navy, the‘snap’ telegram read simply: WINSTON’S BACK!It needed no further elaboration. Two days after war had been declared, WinstonChurchill was re-appointed to the role he had last held at the start of theGreat War. Within two weeks, his friend ‘Chips’ Channon recorded in hisincomparable diaries10 that ‘Winston is already driving the Admiralty todistraction by his interference and energy’.It was especially true for Admiral Godfrey’s department.For Fleming and his colleagues in Naval Intelligence, the outbreak of war meanta deluge of persistent, exacting queries from the office directly above theirs.The newly appointed First Sea Lord would almost drive them ragged with hisunrelenting daily ‘prayers’, as they came to be known, on all manner of awkwardsubjects.‘Pray, what is being done about…’ Winston Churchill would want to know.Within minutes, some poor unfortunate in Room 39 of the Admiralty would have tofind out. Lieutenant Fleming – with his incomparable ability at quickly writingthe most lapidary of prose – usually ended up drafting the answer.The First Sea Lord was hardly infallible and would, when it suited him,interfere with plans and operations. Winston Churchill had had a chequeredcareer, including his years in the political wilderness, which had, in part,resulted from his chronic impetuousness. Indeed, the prevailing wisdom aroundthe corridors of power was that Churchill was possessed of a wrong-headed kindof genius that had burned brightly but ended – as with all political careers –in complete and utter failure.His brainwaves often teetered to the brink of disaster.Appalled by the stalemate on the Western Front in the Great War, Churchill hadarticulated that an attack through the ‘soft underbelly’ of Europe would breakthe impasse. As First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill had dispatched anexpedition to the Dardanelles. When 250,000 troops had been killed as a result,his career as a wartime statesman was over.Since then his political career had been resurrected despite his switchingpolitical sides with such disloyal careerism that it left some onlookers winded.Most recently, Winston Churchill had been a voice in the wastelands, a strident,increasingly monotonous portent of doom. But now, with a solicitous providencethat he put down to fate, the First Sea Lord was where he wanted to be and, in amatter of weeks, the Royal Navy engaged the enemy in spectacular fashion.Churchill himself basked in the glory of victory with the Battle of the RiverPlate that December.By comparison, the First Sea Lord’s relationship with NID would be strained, notleast with what the professional intelligence officers saw as his wishfulinterpretation – especially concerning U-boat statistics and the more vexedquestion of sightings and refuelling in Ireland and Spain. On this issue, theDirector of Naval Intelligence later said that Churchill was at his mostmalignant. ‘There will, of course, be occasions when ruthless criticism is aduty and irregular method a responsibility,’ Admiral Godfrey would mildly recorda few years later, ‘but at no time should consideration of persons be allowed toimpair intellectual integrity.’As a result, the future prime minister would never bring John Godfrey into hisinner circle. Their mutual distrust is reflected in the admiral later tellinghis biographer that the greater tragedy of Churchill’s life was that although heloved strategy, the First Sea Lord was never particularly good at it.Proof, certainly within the secret war, came with one of his Lordship’s greaterobsessions, an issue that would soon come to galvanize – in every sense of theword – his desire to prosecute subversion and guerrilla warfare. It was thevexed question concerning the often gloriously rainbow-hued mineral oxides fromwhich metallic iron could be extracted which would have quite an unforeseen –and significant – impact on the secret war and its prosecution.images [images/icon.jpg]If Military intelligence was, as Groucho Marx famously quipped, a contradictionin terms, no better demonstration came with the War Office’s own branch (knownas Military Intelligence (Research)) which one recruit termed ‘an organisationin which fact and fiction played so smoothly together’. At the start of the war,it was yet another department directed – though at times, that was overstatingthe case – towards sabotage and subversion, existing in a surreal, oftentopsy-turvy world of its own making. Though its staff did not officially exist,one would disconcert his colleagues by shouting ‘Boo!’ at them in the street.Another quickly went out of favour for not looking up and acknowledging thepresence of Sir Stewart Menzies. ‘I thought we were not supposed to know who hewas,’ said the unfortunate miscreant when C happened to pass through theiroffice.Whereas MI5 and MI6 were interested in gathering – or counteracting –intelligence, MI (R) was interested in developing weapons for use behind enemylines. These would involve what one writer has termed the ‘bizarre projects’expanding the role of deception in scarcely believable ways – not least to manyof its own recruits.Joan Bright, who became a secretary in the department, was told to report to StJames’s Underground Station at 11 a.m. on one particular day. She was told tomake sure she wore a pink carnation. At the appointed time, she was led – aftermany changes of direction and what seemed obvious counter-surveillance – to anoffice where a colonel greeted her. Made to sign the Official Secrets Act, asshe left the colonel pointed through the window to another man waiting at astreet corner.‘When you leave here,’ he warned, ‘don’t let him see you. Turn left and keepgoing.’Although not explained at the time, this other fellow was most likely workingfor a rival department within MI6 with whom MI (R) shared a suite of offices at2 Caxton Street, just round the corner from MI6 Headquarters at BroadwayBuildings. Admiral Quex Sinclair had set up his own department within the SecretIntelligence Service, Section D – whose initial supposedly stood for Destruction– to look at attacking the enemy by unusual means. That meant sabotage, but asthe intelligence historian M.R.D. Foot noted, Section D was also tasked to use‘propaganda to shift enemy opinion’.For this, the agency employed a major and a typist. Though there was obviousoverlap with Electra House, ‘no one told Campbell Stuart about him’, oneofficial history notes, ‘and no one told him about Campbell Stuart’. Theduplicity hardly mattered because none was particularly effective in propaganda,nor, indeed, the greater needs of subversion. MI (R), Electra House and SectionD ignored each other but somehow vied to be equally incompetent.Though MI (R) eventually concentrated on work carried out by troops and SectionD on undercover work, their two titular heads soon fell out. Even though theywere both Royal Engineers, they bickered over approach and who should do what.It was a recipe for disaster which played out all over Europe with a series offarcical subversive activities that came to a head with a one-legged teamerchant who had been sent on a mission by someone who seemed to have read toomany pre-war spy stories.images [images/icon.jpg]On that same first Monday in September 1939 – the day after war was declared,when Winston Churchill had been appointed First Sea Lord – another later entrantto the secret world began his own unique preparations for the fighting. DennisWheatley bought a stash of Hugo de Monterrey cigars and several bottles ofchampagne before stopping off at his publishers on his way home. He wanted tosee if they might reprint his books while there was still enough paper left.Whatever else could be said about him, Dennis Wheatley certainly had style.‘During the first week of war, my failure to find any suitable war employmentgreatly depressed me,’ Wheatley would later write. Indeed, his skill at writing,he felt, could become his entrée into the secret war and he offered his servicesto the Ministry of Information. His applications (three separate ones todifferent departments) were never formally acknowledged.Through family connections – his wife, stepson and daughter were all working forMI5 – he was eventually asked to write some pamphlets and tips on how to resistthe invasion (which were later published by Wheatley under the apt heading ofStranger Than Fiction). But he remained frustrated that he could not be put tomore gainful employ, which even his good friend Max Knight could not assuage.Knight asked him to keep an eye on Rollo Ahmed, the curious Egyptian-bornoccultist, and asked if Dennis would ‘sound him out very gently particularlywith a view to finding out if he would be willing to do his sort of workabroad’. Knight does not say what that was and neither did Wheatley.An obvious area for a wordsmith was in writing propaganda. But as Dennis himselfnoted, during the early stages of the war it ‘was so bad that words fail todescribe its rottenness’. It was, he felt, tantamount to treason to waste suchan opportunity so, as the country prepared to fight the enemy, Dennis Wheatleyturned his attention to a new novel in the hope that his own – and the country’s– fortunes would change.images [images/icon.jpg]The MI6 officer who had been tasked to subvert and destroy the enemy byunconventional means as head of Section D was the most incongruous of figureswho thought every operation he planned was a ‘war stopper’. Major-GeneralLaurence Grand was tall, slim and good-looking with a heavy moustache, exudingbonhomie with a curious air of mystery, usually to be found strolling around ina well-cut lounge suit with a scarlet carnation in his lapel. He was, as severalpeople have pointed out, exactly the sort of figure whom Ian Fleming might haveimagined to head up a department of the secret service. That he was, in effect,the head of sabotage and destruction within the real secret service meant thathe tried to live up to his surname. On one occasion an instructor remarked inGeneral Grand’s hearing that he needed a real body to practice sticking a daggerin. ‘I can let you have one, old boy,’ Grand replied. ‘Genuine German. It’s inour freezer. I’ll have it put in your car.’After a lifetime in military service – India, Iraq and Kurdistan – Grand hadbeen tasked to consider subversion without using anything akin to militaryaction. ‘Examining such an enormous task,’ he later said, ‘one felt as if onehad been told to move the Pyramids with a pin.’ Yet the recent MI6 officialhistory describes him as ‘a man of energy and ideas’ whose fiefdom was hisheadquarters on the upper floors of the St Ermin’s Hotel in Victoria.Section D had been established on 1 April 1938 – which he thought appropriate.Everything was low key, informal and came under the purview of MI6 (to avoidprying Treasury eyes so that its budget was kept secret). This probably explainswhy C later handed him £100 in notes from a drawer and never mentioned thesubject again. In the run-up to war, Grand had been in charge of militaryvehicle design but had also worked for MI6. One day, Grand was called in byAdmiral Sinclair, whom he considered looked like a Mexican gangster with awide-brimmed hat and a blue suit with brown shoes.‘I want you to do sabotage,’ C told him.‘Is anything barred?’ Grand asked.‘Not a thing!’Despite the mutual loathing of their directors, the War Office’s MI (R) wouldlater be subsumed into MI6 within Section D in the guise of developingsubversion throughout the world. A number of ‘unusual’ devices were developedincluding, improbably, a suggestion by J.B.S. Haldane FRS for mines to beattached by swimmers or in submarines. ‘Prototypes were tested in The RiverThames,’ Joan Bright Astley,11 recalled. ‘[Using] Boy scouts at strategic spotsto catch them as they floated by.’A number of other devices, including sticky bombs, almost inevitably drew theinterest of the First Sea Lord. When during one demonstration, one bombaccidentally exploded behind some French generals, it disturbed them so muchthat they were never quite converted to the cause.Vive la difference, then, for as the political situation in Europe had worsened,the vague notion of spreading revolt and guerrilla tactics had become, as onemilitary planner noted, ‘the only way’. Yet these were nothing compared to evenmore grandiose plans sanctioned by General Grand’s Section D – into which MI (R)would be folded – which, as the authorised history of the service notes, waslikened to ‘arranging an attack on a Panzer Division by an actor mounted on adonkey’.images [images/icon.jpg]Iron Ore may not seem like the most crucial ingredient for prosecuting thesecret war, but its availability to the Third Reich would act like a lightningrod for all the various glaring deficiencies of British attempts at covertoperations. With the outbreak of war, no less a champion than the First Sea Lordhad realised that one way to cripple the German war machine would be to strikeat its Achilles’ heel – Swedish ore exports.12No longer having access to the extensive French ore fields, Germany’s onlysource of iron ore was Sweden. The Third Reich’s supplies had effectivelyhalved. An attack against the Swedish ore fields, mainly in the north of thecountry, would effectively cut them off completely. Most was either transportedvia the Baltic port of Luleå in summer; or in winter, by train across themountains to Narvik. There were plenty of places which could be attacked to stopthe flow. The First Sea Lord wanted to seize supplies at sea, which horrifiedhis colleagues, but over the next few months a variety of possible scenarios –many more improbable than the last – were suggested.All showed the unreality of the British capability to sabotage the enemy.At his first meeting with Sir Stewart Menzies in December 1939, Churchilldiscussed the matter and later authorised £300,000 to the NID to begin work.That new year of 1940, a Section D agent was sent to Stockholm. to spearheadthis action. Alfred ‘Freddie’ Rickman had already written a book called SwedishIron Ore as cover. Now, for reasons which were never clear, he employed acommunist and a one-legged tea merchant to blow up some of the Swedish mines. Byday, he was an importer of machinery, and by night, clearly, he may well haveread too many trashy spy novels. Rickman communicated with London usinginvisible ink and smuggled in explosives disguised as rubber, chocolate orbiscuits. It got even sillier: a military attaché who helped collect theexplosives hidden within some books pretended to be a French chauffeur – withhat and accent – later terming the whole escapade ‘real Edgar Wallace stuff, ina dark dirty wood at midnight’.With several hundred pounds of explosive hidden in his cellar, Rickman was readyto go at any time in early 1940. There followed months of prevarication – duringwhich Section D developed the notion of destroying the cranes at Oxelösund – themain port facing the Baltic that was ice-free all year round. Newly releasedfiles from 2013 show just how high the planning went. Both C and General Grandmet with the Cabinet several times to discuss this pet project of the First SeaLord’s. All through the spring of 1940, Section D’s efforts in depriving theGermans of Swedish iron ore – and Romanian oil supplies – continued in ahopelessly amateurish vein. A high-ranking Foreign Office mandarin soon came tothe conclusion that General Grand was ‘almost always wrong, his knowledge widebut alarmingly superficial, his organisation in many respects a laughing stock,and he is a consistent and fluent liar’.And still it went ahead with what another file terms ‘a plan which we refer tounder the Capital O’. This was aimed at Oxelösund – also known in some accountsas Operation Lumps – of which both the prime minister and Foreign Secretary wereaware. Rickman said all that was needed was to press the button. His principalagent, a German refugee, panicked – and then the invasion of Norway intervened.At least now the fears of Norwegian complaints about interference in its railsystem had been subverted.A Royal Navy yachtsman called Gerald Holdsworth then flew to Stockholm. Workingwith Rickman, their first task was to move all the incriminating material in hiscellar. Before they could, MI6 in London received a telegram stating that theirman in Scandinavia ‘was found in possession of five hundred weights ofexplosives’. Rickman didn’t realise he had been under surveillance by theSwedish security authorities, who promptly arrested him in possession ofexplosives and maps detailing where they were going to be placed.‘In retrospect the Oxelösund Operation provides an excellent illustration of hownot to conduct a covert operation and also of the price to be paid when thingsgo wrong,’ one academic review says with understated simplicity. Not only didRickman anger his hosts, but also the minister – as the official British envoywas known – who noted ‘they have achieved little in Sweden beyond putting me andthemselves in an awkward position’, as well as the local MI6 station chief(terming the potential saboteurs ‘negligent or inefficient’). Rickman’s handfulof agents – supposed to be gathering shipping intelligence – were arrested andsentenced to short prison sentences.During Alfred Rickman’s subsequent trial – which brought unwelcome publicity –the prosecution suggested that the whole operation had been some sort of Germanprovocation, engineered by undercover elements working for the Gestapo withinthe United Kingdom. ‘Of course there were no “highly placed German agents inEngland”,’ notes the chief historian of the Foreign Office about this farcicaldenouement on the MI6 website, ‘but with Britain’s wartime fortunes at itslowest ebb, it was perhaps better that the Swedes should believe in imaginaryGerman spies rather than the reality of British incompetence.’images [images/icon.jpg]Despite these ridiculous activities, the stage was now set for the greaterbattles of the secret war to come, with all the main players – certainly for thenext few years – now in place. Despite some of the preceding nonsense, so far asthe Nazis were concerned, there was a cunning, evil organisation whose tendrilsgot everywhere and seemed well-placed to stymie its plans and greater ambitions.The British Secret Service.As a result, on war’s outbreak, the SS Intelligence Service attempted tounderstand the enemy forces they would be fighting. It gave especial attentionto the field of foreign espionage. Intelligence, according to Sicherheitsdienst,was a peculiarly British métier, ‘the virtue of their tradition, theirexperience, and certain facets of their national character – unscrupulousness,self-control, cool deliberateness and ruthless action – have achieved anunquestionable degree of mastery’.The myth was widespread in pre-war Germany, so much so that when anything wentwrong, the high-ups in Berlin would assume that His Majesty’s secret servants –or their proxies – were somehow behind it all. But now, at the start of November1939, came the confluence of two events which would link both the occult and thetendrils of the secret war. Both would be related to perhaps the mostembarrassing incident in MI6’s thirty-year history, which in the understatedtones of the recent official history, noted simply that the Germans madetremendous propaganda capital out of it, as well as several heads on a plate anda sense that somehow, the occult had been involved.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 In 1961, Commander Anthony Courtney, a friend of Fleming’s, was compromisedin the very same room with a younger femme fatale as part of what was widelyseen as a honeytrap, when he was photographed with an Intourist guide. Threeyears later it led to a scandal that saw the end of Courtney’s political career,as a kind of curious coda to the Profumo affair.2 Behind the scenes, the former DNI continued to give the latest incumbentgood advice. Where Reggie Hall was secretive and enjoyed splendid intrigue, JohnGodfrey knew how to delegate and consulted as widely as possible.3 In several accounts, Max Knight is taken to be the role model for M, anotion first aired by Anthony Masters in The Man Who Was M. While Knight did runwhat was sometimes termed M Section, he was never known as M. It is not clearhow well Ian Fleming knew him and, in any case, the crusty admiral of Fleming’slater creation is clearly based more on Admiral Godfrey than the bohemianMaxwell Knight.4 Mata Hari was not alone. After the Great War, a number of women cameforward who spun extraordinary tales of their involvement in all sorts ofclandestine activities, all of which can easily be dismissed as fantasy. TheSpecial Operations Executive employed any number of female agents whose variousmishaps led to murders and massacres due to the Executive’s almost criminallevel of negligence.In one account, when Wilhelm Canaris was told about a Second World War agent whohad fallen for a Belgian woman and told her of his forthcoming mission, hemerely twinkled: ‘[It’s] what I always say: there’s trouble as soon as you letwomen get into espionage affairs’ (Wighton & Peis, pp. 76–7). Some writers havegone further to suggest that Mata Hari had an affair with Admiral Canaris, whichcan easily be dismissed as a myth thanks to the release of her MI5 files (seefor example, Nigel West’s Counterfeit Spies).5 As an interesting aside, many Bond girls in the films are also fish. Thatwas the tongue-in-cheek view of the late Alexander Cockburn in an amusing essay,‘James Bond at 25’ in American Film in 1987. This association with the sea beganwith the first film in 1962 when Honey Rider (played by Ursula Andress) ‘comesup out of the sea in Dr. No in one of the most successful associations of womanwith water since Botticelli stood Venus up on a clamshell’. Bond himself,Cockburn also pointed out, in subsequent films was often found in either coldwater or snow. Trying to compensate for what Cockburn termed ‘the distraughtpsychic landscapes of the books’, the filmmakers often filmed underwater wherethe movies ‘take on the surreal texture of a Max Ernst painting’.6 In some accounts, it seems as though Admiral Godfrey and NID were runningsome sort of shadow secret service. From the outset, the admiral wanted toensure that the Naval Intelligence Division extended its nominal brief toco-ordinate information about the war at sea. Yet it should be noted thatGodfrey’s main enemies were Admirals Räder and Dönitz, not Canaris and theAbwehr. For this, he created the Operational Intelligence Centre to co-ordinateall sources of information about the Kriegsmarine, which became criticallyimportant in the later fight against the U-boats.7 Operation Ruthless was outlined in a memo from Ian Fleming to the DNI on 12September 1940, interestingly at the same time as Naval Intelligence started toconsider astrology:I suggest we obtain the loot by the following means:1. Obtain from Air Ministry an air-worthy German bomber.2. Pick a tough crew of five, including a pilot, W/T operator and word-perfectGerman speaker. Dress them in German Air Force uniform, add blood and bandagesto suit.3. Crash plane in the Channel after making S.O.S. to rescue service in P/L.4. Once aboard rescue boat, shoot German crew, dump overboard, bring rescue boatback to English port.In order to increase the chances of capturing an R. or M. with its richer booty,the crash might be staged in mid-Channel. The Germans would presumably employone of this type for the longer and more hazardous journey.8 On 30 October 1942, radar contact was made with U-boat U-559 by aSunderland flying boat on patrol in the Eastern Mediterranean. After a heavyattack by depth charges, the submarine was literally hoisted by HMS Petard, thenforced to the surface where its crew abandoned ship. Led by First LieutenantAnthony Fasson, Able Seaman Colin Grazier and Tommy Brown, a younger lad workingin the canteen, they all entered the sinking submarine. Fasson discovered somerestricted documents and handed them up to Brown in the conning tower. Fassonand Grazier returned to recover some electronic equipment when U-559 lurched andquickly started to sink. Brown jumped clear but Fasson and Grazier were drowned.Their haul was gold dust for Bletchley Park: the German Weather Short Code Bookand the Short Signal Book which enabled the codebreakers to get back into‘Shark’, their name for the Naval Enigma. As discussed in Chapter 12, there hadbeen a blackout resulting from the introduction of a four-wheel Enigma machine.Fasson and Grazier were posthumously awarded the George Cross. Brown received aGeorge Medal.9 An interested observer and participant to these various claims andcounterclaims was Sir Alexander Glen, arctic explorer, shipping industry veteranand, so far as this narrative is concerned, author of Footholds Against AWhirlpool, in which he discusses some of his time as Assistant Naval Attaché inBelgrade in the first year of the war. In a letter to The Sunday Times inOctober 1975, ‘Sandy’ Glen also noted that he, too, had made another remarkablecontribution to the literary legacy of Ian Fleming. He actually wrote JamesBond’s obituary in You Only Live Twice. ‘Fleming knew I had been at Fettes andasked me to fill in that bit of Bond’s life after the slight hiccup that had ledhim to leave Eton at a rather early age. We did this over lunch at the Savoy, alunch which not so strangely brought out a good bit of who was Bond himself.’ Asfor the various discussions of what may or may not have happened on the OrientExpress, another correspondent to The Sunday Times noted: ‘I have never seensuch a window not protected by bars.’10 The day after his appointment, Channon noted Churchill in the Commonswhispering to Chamberlain. ‘He is behaving well,’ Chips observed, ‘but theirdeep mutual antagonism must sooner or later flare up and make co-operationimpossible.’11 As well as saving many MI(R) and, later, SOE files from destruction, JoanBright is often said to have been one of the inspirations for Miss Moneypenny(though C’s assistant Kathleen Pettigrew has a greater claim). Joan certainlymixed in the higher circles where the Fleming brothers could be found. ‘I likedIan,’ she said in one interview just before she died in 2008. ‘I thought he wasawfully attractive and fun, but elusive. I think he was a ruthless man – hewould drop somebody if he didn’t want them any more. That would be it.’ Afterthe war, she married Philip Astley, who had been involved in political warfare,and wrote some fascinating memoirs of her work during the war.12 To feed its blast furnaces, Germany imported three-quarters of its iron orefrom Sweden. After war was declared, supplies continued – 7–10 million tons peryear – which in one contemporary assessment represented ‘a direct act of waragainst Britain’. In the late sixties, a debate about whether Sweden could havestopped the war by shutting off these supplies came to exercise various economichistorians. ‘If the mines of Lapland had ceased working,’ wrote one, ‘the blastfurnaces of the Ruhr would have shut down too.’ The veracity of the variousdiscussions centred – like all economic debates – on the statistics which wereused. The point is that Germany was a heavy user of Swedish ore, something thatAdolf Hitler had recognised as early as 1934, and the delivery of orerepresented, in one newspaper assessment, ‘The neuralgic point of German-Swedishrelations.’ (For further information, see pp 64–65, Nazi Germany and NeutralEurope, Christian Leintz, Manchester University Press, 2000)."},{"pageContent":"5EXPLOSIVE FORCES [contents.htm#a8]The British Secret Service had a great tradition. Germany possessed nothingcomparable to it. Therefore each success meant the building up of such atradition and required even greater determination. The traitors who would stabGermany in the back during this most decisive struggle must be ruthlesslydestroyed.Adolf Hitler to Walter Schellenberg, immediately after theVenlo IncidentThe explosion, when it came, was unexpected and devastating.There was an almighty flash, a deafening blast of noise and debris that killedand maimed several people. In the immediate confusion there was little sense ofwhat had actually happened. But why was already obvious to the people who hadcongregated at the Bürgerbraükeller in Munich, sixteen years after the Führerhad attempted to launch his ultimately abortive putsch. Now, it was aimed tokill both the leader and the most potent shrine to his remarkable rise.Two months after the outbreak of war, Adolf Hitler’s visit to the cavernous beerhall was an immutable fixture in the Nazi calendar. The Führer visited Munich onWednesday, 8 November 1939, partly to see Unity Mitford recovering from asuicide attempt, but mainly to visit the spiritual home of his struggles which,in one estimation, eventually ‘put the ertswhile denizens of the Munich beercellar in the corridors of power in the Wilhelmstrasse’. That same Wednesdayevening he would join ‘the old fighters’ where he had originally declared thathe would save the German people, and, as ever, Adolf Hitler would notdisappoint.Even by his own standards, the Führer was in a belligerent mood.Watched from the front row by most of the golden pheasants, he used the occasionto crow about the superiority of German culture. ‘I believe that a singleGerman, let us say Beethoven, achieved more in the realm of music than allEnglishmen of the past and present together,’ he began. For the next hour, hiswords rose to a screaming crescendo somewhere between ham and histrionics,concluding with a paean to the undying spirit of the fighters themselves. ‘Icannot end this evening without, as always, thanking you for your loyalfollowing through these long years!’ he screamed.And then, to riotous applause, he left the stage and departed from the hallearly. Along with his entourage and local party faithful, he headed back toBerlin via train. Only bar staff and the musicians who had played the tunes thataccompanied his entrance were left clearing up. Thirteen minutes later, therewas an almighty flash, a fearful explosion of dust and debris which followed thecollapse of the ceiling, and a gallery – under which Adolf Hitler had beenstanding – then crashed to the floor. Windows shattered, woodwork splintered andall exit doors were blown out.Eight people – including a waitress – were killed instantly. Amongst the criesand screams, many more were injured. But, more significantly for this narrative,the intended target of the explosion came to believe – expertly stoked by JosefGoebbels and his propagandists – that his escape was thanks to divineprovidence. The story got stranger still when it became inextricably linked totwo of the Nazi regime’s other supposed obsessions: the occult and thesupposedly supernatural powers of the British Secret Service, culminating a daylater with a sting operation on MI6, which would also have many repercussions onboth sides of the fighting and the secret war to come.images [images/icon.jpg]The stars, it seemed, had foretold events of great danger.One strand of this already peculiar story had begun just six days earlier.Events had taken an extraordinary turn when the astrologer Karl Krafft hadwritten to his friend Dr Heinrich Fesel at the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA)in Berlin. Since the outbreak of war, Herr Krafft had been regularly submittinghis prognostications to SS headquarters on Prinz Albrechtsrasse. After decidinghe didn’t want to live in his native Switzerland – not least because of hisanti-Semitism – Krafft was soon submitting papers on the blitzkrieg, thesituation in Poland and the possibilities of invading the West. All werepolitely ignored but in this particular missive, however, he predicted somethingremarkable. Der Führer, Krafft predicted, would shortly be in danger from ‘anattempt of assassination by the use of explosive material between 7–10November’.By the time the letter – dated the previous Thursday, 2 November 1939 – arrivedin Berlin, plans were well afoot for Adolf Hitler’s visit to Munich. There, atthe Bürgerbraükeller, the Führer would address the local party on theanniversary of the putsch, about which a previous astrologer had made so muchcapital in the early days. As such, his visit was one of the few occasions whenthe Führer’s movements could be predicted. What nobody could foresee were theactions – less still, the motivations – of a kind of über-Führer, someone whowas adrift and bore massive grudges, who in one assessment had ‘an abnormal needfor recognition and acknowledgement which was reinforced by a thirst forvengeance for the alleged injustice which had been done to his brother’.images [images/icon.jpg]There is a certain irony that the person who planted the explosives – in asense, a radicalised but hardly suicide bomber – had succumbed to an almostFreudian desire to destroy the Führer (Sigmund Freud himself had been forced toleave his native Germany thanks to Nazi persecution). According to reports atthe time, Georg Elser would have made an ideal patient in a psychiatric ward. Orso Dr Goebbels’ propagandists declared. Small, pale-faced with long hair, evenAdolf Hitler later commented kindly on his ‘intelligent eyes, high forehead anddetermined expression’. Significantly, Elser was a skilled artisan, a worker whomany assumed would normally have been attracted to the Nazi Party. It was alwaysthought that alienation had pushed him over the edge thanks to the repeatedharangues from his overbearing father. As the historian Roger Moorhouse haswritten, in the unfortunate Georg Elser’s mind the kind of people who wereattracted to Nazism ‘perhaps reminded him of the loud-mouthed bombast of hisdrunken father’.Yet for all the portrayal of a misfit, Elser had a girlfriend who knew nothingof his plans. Born in 1903, Elser was never politically involved, rarely readnewspapers and was the kind of introspective loner who few could imagine showingastonishing courage. He only ever joined the Red Front Fighters’ League –streetfighters who enjoyed a good brawl with the brownshirts – to play in theirbrass band.Yet in so many ways, Georg Elser was an enigma.He became a cabinetmaker, a job at which he excelled. Yet he also remained anitinerant and, almost inevitably, during the economic woes of the earlythirties, had to return home as he ran out of money. Soon believing that onlycommunism would ever look after workers like himself, Elser turned against theFührer when trade unions were banned and wages frozen. Fat cats were milking thesystem. So when a Nazi parade traipsed along a route where he was standing inhis home town, he made a point of not saluting. When a colleague suggested heperhaps should, Elser’s reply was illuminating.‘You can kiss my arse,’ the carpenter declared.In the aftermath of the Bürgerbraükeller explosion, the Munich police wereastonished to discover he had taken a year to meticulously plot, plan andexecute the assassination attempt. Georg Elser stole gunpowder from an armamentfactory where he worked. He also acquired some more from temporary employment ina quarry, along with explosives and a detonator. He experimented far from pryingeyes and, after a little research, realised where the kill should take place.It was a pre-war version of The Day of the Jackal – or, at least, Rogue Male,then published to great acclaim about the killing of an (unnamed) dictator.The Führer would never miss the opportunity to rouse with his rabble, swapstories and let them get blind drunk. So Elser made his way to theBürgerbraükeller and started taking measurements and weighing up where best toplace his bomb. The ideal detonation point, he worked out, would be behind thedais where Adolf Hitler would give his speech. There he had noticed the thickstone pillar which acted as the supporting structure for the upper gallery ranall the way around the wall and above the stage. It would be an ideal place tocause maximum destruction. The gallery would be forced to the ground, killinganybody who was unfortunately underneath.Throughout the summer of 1939, Elser refined his work. Though he kept quietabout his plans, his characteristic devotion in collecting all the disparateparts needed to assemble a time bomb attracted attention. Another colleaguebecame intrigued by some of his tinkering. One day, noting him messing with analarm clock, he wondered if it was going to be used in activating a light tospeed up his getting up in the pre-dawn quiet.‘Yes,’ Elser replied, ‘something like that.’That August he travelled to Munich, where he obtained work as a carpenter andwas employed to help renovate the beer hall for over a month. Returning to theBürgerbraükeller each night at nine o’clock, he took his evening meal in thebar, then sneaked up to the gallery, hiding in a storeroom and waited for theplace to close. When the staff had finished up for the evening, he started toassemble the bomb and hid it within the supporting column by the dais. In thequiet and gloom he would work by flashlight. He needed to excavate a cavity –which he lined with cork – in which to hide the bomb.Georg Elser could hardly miss the fact that the pillar had been clad in wood. Asa result, he had to fashion a secret door in the panelling which would not benoticeable. Then, eventually, when he was ready to loosen mortar, he prised outbricks and made sure no debris was left by use of a cloth sack. The beer hallwas indeed cavernous: an expansive space which could hold up to 3,000 drunkenrevellers. As a result, every hammer blow ‘echoed like a gunshot’, writes RogerMoorhouse, ‘and to escape detection, he had to time his blows to coincide withexternal sounds, such as the passing of a tram or the automatic flush of thetoilets.’Each morning he would leave via a side exit. One day, Elser was nearly caughtwhen a waiter found him inside the building. He blithely told him he was anearly customer, ordered a coffee and drank it in the garden.Alarm clocks would be the key. Elser realised he would need a timer to allow himplenty of time to set the bomb and leave. So he created his own clock mechanismwith extra cogs and levers: he also added a second timer as a failsafe. Theclock could run for six days before triggering the explosion. A system of sprungweights would detonate a lone rifle round embedded inside the explosive. Heplaced both in a box to muffle their ticking. He added a sheet of tin plate infront of them to absorb any telltale sound of hollowness should anyone tap thewall.Two months after starting work, he was ready. After setting the alarm andplacing the bomb inside the false door, Georg Elser left the empty bar with thebomb in its place, on the same day that Karl Krafft had written his warning,Thursday the 2nd. Without his ever knowing it, fate – and what has been termed‘perhaps the most disastrous covert operation in the history of Britishintelligence’ – were racing together to collide in a surprising denouement.images [images/icon.jpg]Venlo is an otherwise bucolic border town nestling in the south eastern borderof Holland with Germany, just an hour’s drive from nearby Düsseldorf. It washere at the start of November 1939 that the two most senior secret service menon the continent came to meet emissaries of the gathering conspiracy against theFührer. They had already met a pair of representatives of the German GeneralStaff, and now the two MI6 officers were to meet the mysterious general behindthe Schwarze Kapelle, the so-called German resistance.The two British agents, sipping coffee in the Café Bacchus, were ‘both slightlyparodying what they purported to be’, one contemporary would write, ‘withmonocle, trimmed grey moustache, club tie, touch of the Raj, whence in fact theycame’. Ironically, they didn’t particularly care for each other. CaptainSigismund Payne Best was a larger-than-life character, who always wore spats anda monocle, whom another MI6 colleague later termed ‘an ostentatious ass blown upwith self-importance’.The other MI6 man, Richard Stevens, was a former Indian Army Intelligenceofficer who later claimed he was never ideal for the work he was doing. He wasquite happy to confess that he was out of his depth, for he had ‘never been aspy, much less a spymaster’. A brilliant linguist and excellent raconteur,Stevens was nevertheless ambitious and saw the meeting in Venlo as a way ofending the war before it started.As befitted someone who had been personally recruited by Mansfield Cumming, Bestwas something of a scoundrel in the mould of the old man who had also marriedwell (the daughter of a Dutch general). Stevens had only recently arrived aspassport control officer: he had been briefed before he left that Best wassomething of a ne’er-do-well who worked for the Z Network, the ‘other’ side ofthe secret service. So the dual MI6 networks, supposedly operatingindependently, were now aware of each other’s representatives in The Hague.Worse, they were working together.It was a recipe for disaster.A few days before, their German informants had told them at a meeting inAmsterdam that units of the Wehrmacht would be more likely to resist Hitler ifan invasion of France was thwarted. All in all, this preliminary exchange hadgone so well that their next meeting in Venlo would see the participation of theArmy general behind the conspiracy.Only one minor mystery remained from their previous encounter.‘Tell me,’ Best had asked of his friendly contact, ‘do you always wear amonocle?’‘You know,’ the German replied with a perfectly straight face, ‘I’ve beenmeaning to ask you the same question.’images [images/icon.jpg]Without their ever realising it, Best and Stevens had actually been talking to arising star of the SS, Walter Schellenberg, later chief of the foreignintelligence service of the Sicherheitsdienst. Then working as head of the groupdefending the Reich against foreign espionage, as ‘Major Schammel’ he had beenquietly pulling strings behind their back. Aware of the considerable anti-Nazisentiment within the Abwehr, Schellenberg had brilliantly played upon wishfulthinking in both Berlin and London.Then in his late 20s, Schellenberg was the coming man of the Nazi espionageworld. Recruited after graduation from law school by Reinhard Heydrich, theyounger man would become close to his chief – and even closer to his boss’swife, Lena. Schellenberg was pliable and persuasive, traits noted from his timeat university onwards. Never a brawler, many brownshirts considered him effete:but in his own mind, he set great store by nuance. ‘He believed not in force,nor in nonsense, but in subtlety,’ considered one underling, ‘and he believed hewas subtle.’In the words of another later assessment, Schellenberg was nothing less than ‘ablue-eyed boy’. After linking his star to Heydrich, he had rapidly ascended thehierarchy of the SS in a rise several termed meteoric. A fellow SS myrmidon,Wilhelm Höttl, later told Allied interrogators that Heydrich ‘soon acceptedSchellenberg into his inner circle, in order, as he put it, “to train theyoungster himself”’.With a face scarred by duelling scars, the two often fenced and socialisedtogether. Schellenberg often had to endure another form of fencing as he washardly immune from Heydrich’s Machiavellian posturing. Indeed, Schellenbergwould later record that his mentor perennially engaged in what he termed ‘a sortof cat-and-mouse game, played in terms of trickery and deception’.What really does seem like a tale from a bad thriller actually had taken place acouple of years earlier. Walter Schellenberg had spent a night drinking andwhoring in the company of Heydrich and Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo (alugubrious detective of the plodding variety who, in keeping with thepretensions of a comic book villain, actually kept a machine gun hidden in hisdesk). Far into the night, Heydrich suddenly wanted to know the truth: what wasthe basis of Schellenberg’s relationship with his wife?He protested his innocence. Heydrich smiled and pointed at Schellenberg’s drink.If it tasted bitter, that was because it contained poison. Only if Heydrich wassatisfied with the answer would Schellenberg be given the antidote. He was and,no doubt due to such bizarre incidents, the younger man soon suffered abreakdown thanks to nervous exhaustion. Ironically, thanks to his overwork,Schellenberg’s own marriage failed1 and, for obvious reasons, he stopped seeingFrau Heydrich apart from on formal occasions.Somehow, he survived to not just live another day but also remarry someone whosemother’s sister was married to a Jew, a fact that Reinhard Heydrich was sure tohold over Walter Schellenberg. With that, his boss seemed happy and allowed hisprotegé to prosper in the dark and dangerous currents within the intelligenceapparatus of Nazi Germany. Schellenberg soon found he had a natural aptitude forespionage and intrigue.He later wrote to Heydrich:In Secret Service work, one must never be rash. The careful selection anddeveloping of above-average collaborators is decisive. In order to work in aforeign country they must be virtually natives, and must acquire a ‘valid’profession unless there is some other natural explanation for their presence inthe country in question.Given his starring role in what was about to unfold on the Dutch border, it wassomething the British secret service operators he was about to meet should havetaken to heart. What really happened at Venlo was more cock-up than conspiracy,an event which showed, in one assessment, ‘that fatuous over-confidence inBritish superiority which was endemic on other parts of the imperial structureat the time’.images [images/icon.jpg]Georg Elser himself did not return to the Munich Bürgerbraükeller for anotherfive days. On Tuesday, 7 November, he put the final touches to his mechanism.With the ceremony only a day away, he wanted to make sure that his bomb wouldactually work. At dawn on the Wednesday – the day of the visit by the Führer –Elser then set the bomb, replaced the false cladding and pressed his ears to thepillar make sure the bomb was still working. A faint ticking was discernibleonly to someone who knew there was a bomb there. Security was in the hands of acorpulent, corrupt former nightclub bouncer who indolently did very little andwould hardly have even noticed the ticking.All was set – literally – in the quiet of the beer hall.When Hitler claimed he had the luck of the devil, he wasn’t far wrong.Heavy fog had pressed down all night and the golden pheasants had decided totake the train back to Berlin rather than fly. Had Georg Elser read thenewspapers he would have learned that because of the expected bad weather, theFührer had cancelled his speech, then reinstated it – but then, to make thetrain, decided to start half an hour earlier. In the event, he finished thirteenminutes earlier than Elser had anticipated.2The Führer’s entourage rushed out so quickly that one waitress was amazed at thelarge, unpaid bar bill they had run up – though not quite as stunned as when shewas thrown the length of the hall and through a doorway when the bomb exploded.Everyone else who happened to be on the stage of the Bürgerbraükeller when thesupporting column – which had been draped with a vast swastika – crashed down onthem was killed. Sixty-three others had to be helped out, and many of thevictims of the blast who survived were certain that they had been bombed fromabove.Around this same time, Georg Elser had taken a ferry across the lake toConstance, for Switzerland was his ultimate destination. Elser had reconnoitredthe border the year before but now, aware that the bomb was about to explode, hewas horrified to find things had changed dramatically.Security at the border was intense. A war was on.Guards and fencing were everywhere. Fairly quickly, his nervous pacing as helooked for somewhere to cross the border meant that he was picked up by a coupleof patrol guards. Accompanying them to their post – Elser claimed he was lookingfor a friend – he was searched as a matter of routine. Coming as it did afterthe news of the assassination attempt had broken, even the most dim-witted ofguards would have found a postcard of the Bürgerbraükeller and a Communist Partybadge of interest. Even more incriminating were pliers to cut the border fenceand a drawing of the design of the bomb, possibly to ingratiate himself toanti-Nazi elements across the Swiss border.Georg Elser was handed over to the Gestapo. Word spread, by telephone andteletype, throughout the Third Reich.It is doubtful whether Schellenberg’s own cat-and-mouse game with the MI6 menwould have reached such a swiftly executed climax were it not for that sameexplosion. Even though the Führer survived, the blast was not confined to thehall. ‘There is no doubt that the British Secret Service is behind it all,’Heinrich Himmler told Schellenberg in an early morning telephone call the nextday. ‘[The Führer] now says – and this is an order – when you meet the Britishagents for your conference tomorrow, you are to arrest them immediately andbring them to Germany.’That same morning, Captain Best had fleetingly glanced at a ‘stop press’ itemconcerning the Munich bomb. ‘Very curious,’ he would later write, ‘and Iwondered whether this attempt had anything to do with our people and, if not,what effect it would have on their plans.’images [images/icon.jpg]Astrological significance or not, the Venlo meeting went ahead the next morning,Thursday, 9 November 1939. Exactly on time, Schellenberg and Alfred Naujocks(whom the former termed ‘very shrewd’), an SS man posing as a fellowconspirator, made their way across the Dutch border to the Café Bacchus. Alongwith another seven intelligence staff, they had travelled in civilian clothesand made their way from Düsseldorf the day before.When their blue Buick stopped in front of the MI6 men, three black Mercedessuddenly smashed through the border post. Shots were fired and, within seconds,Stevens and Best’s Dutch liaison officer was shot dead when he went for his gun.Only too well aware of what was happening, Stevens shouted: ‘Our number is up,Best.’ In the blink of an eye, the two MI6 men were handcuffed, kidnapped by theSS and soon found themselves on the front cover of German newspapers, havingconfessed to the crime of attempting to kill the Führer the night before bysetting off the bomb in the Bürgerbraükeller.British newspapers, too, were up in arms. Terming it ‘the impudent and brutalkidnapping incident at Venlo’, The Times subsequently noted that thejuxtaposition of the two MI6 men was ‘so placed as to suggest to uncriticalreaders that the two Englishmen are on a par with the hapless Elser in thecrime’. The same newspaper had also noted that what the Germans called a British‘terror centre’ in The Hague had been uncovered by the SS – in truth, both theMI6 men had been shadowed and their offices monitored.By sunset, the two Britons had been spirited away to the basement of SSHeadquarters on Berlin’s Prinz Albrechtstrasse. Walter Schellenberg and all theothers who had helped in the kidnapping were handed Iron Crosses by anappreciative Führer in person. To begin with, Best and Stevens were treatedwell, separated and occasionally saw each other on their way to the exerciseyard. The mood changed when a young and ‘resplendent officer’ – whom Bestrecognised from photographs – came into his cell.‘So far, you have been treated as an officer and a gentleman,’ Reinhard Heydrichimperiously declared. ‘But don’t think that this will go on if you don’t behavebetter than you have done. You have two hours left in which to confesseverything.’When Heydrich threatened him with torture courtesy of the Gestapo, Best turnedto his normally friendly German liaison officer.‘Who is this excitable young officer?’ he asked.At this point, Heydrich was consumed by histrionic fury and started shouting atthe Briton at close range, spraying him in saliva. By comparison, all the others– including ‘Gestapo’ Müller – treated the two Britons with punctiliouscourtesy. Eventually, Best and Stevens were transported to SachsenhausenConcentration Camp, where they were joined in early 1941 by Georg Elser, withwhose name they would be forever associated.In time, Elser told the camp guards that Best had paid him 40,000 Swiss Francsto do the bombing, although they didn’t seem to believe him. Both bomber andsecret service man later exchanged letters and became only too aware thatanother far more pervasive myth had sprang up: that Venlo was all a diabolicalplot which had been orchestrated by sinister occult influences.images [images/icon.jpg]It was obvious where this rumour came from.From his own precarious perch within RSHA Headquarters, Dr Heinrich Fesel wasterrified after the explosion in Munich. Understandably, he had taken care tohide Karl Krafft’s letter, pretending that he had never received it.Characteristically, the Swiss-born astrologer would not let matters lie. Thesame day as the Venlo incident, Krafft dispatched a telegram to Rudolf Hess atthe Chancellery, which proclaimed that Adolf Hitler was still in danger.Fesel soon had no option but to produce the original letter, which was shown tothe Führer himself. Not surprisingly, Krafft quickly became the subject of aGestapo investigation, was arrested and brought to the very same prison wherethe actual perpetrator of the attempt on Hitler’s life (Elser) and its supposedarchitects (Best and Stevens) were also incarcerated.Karl Krafft somehow managed to persuade the Gestapo he was on their side andthat, under some conditions, astrology could indeed become a great tool. Afterall, hadn’t he predicted that the great leader was in danger? When it becameabundantly clear that Krafft wasn’t remotely party to the plot, the astrologerwas released to work for the Propaganda Ministry. His letter of warningcertainly gave him the very notoriety he craved.‘This is the man who accurately predicted the attempt on the Führer’s life!’exclaimed one high-up on meeting him. But in Nazi Germany such infamy worked inother, invariably malign ways. Unbeknownst to him at the time, Josef Goebbelshad a plan for Karl Krafft that would bring to life yet another curious mystery,about which much myth has been spun in the years since the war – what is usuallyknown as the Tilea affair, supposedly involving hidden knowledge andintelligence shenanigans which have yet to be resolved completely.images [images/icon.jpg]Momentous events in history invariably require momentous explanations.Such a rationalisation satisfies some sort of psychological need for manypeople. Perhaps that explains the accumulation of mysteries since the deaths ofJFK and Princess Diana. Adolf Hitler was hardly immune. When the Führer – whodemanded daily briefings about the ongoing investigation – was handed the fileof the Gestapo investigation of Georg Elser, he was stunned.‘What idiot conducted this investigation?’ he asked.The reasons were simple: why was there no conspiracy? There had to be somethingmore behind such a momentous occurrence. Yet Georg Elser was clearly a solitaryanimal. In truth, he was one of those solid working men who formed the coremembership of the Nazi Party. Such upright citizens were not perceived as athreat and it made no sense to the golden pheasants that Elser was – as would belater said of Lee Harvey Oswald – a lone nut.Foreign or enemy involvement was taken as a given. After all, as the bomb tickedaway in silence at the beer hall, Adolf Hitler had railed against the Britishand their treachery. Here was the ultimate proof of his omniscience. In theimmediate aftermath came the curious concatenation of themes which run throughthis narrative, for as Roger Moorhouse has amusingly written, that same firstwinter of war ‘the ‘perfidious English’ were portrayed as being behind every‘kitten stuck up a tree’ in Nazi Germany.When Walter Schellenberg returned to Berlin that same evening of the Venloincident – just twenty-four hours after the explosion in Munich – he found theRSHA headquarters ‘like a hornet’s nest into which someone had poked a stick’.The Gestapo soon got the unpalatable truth out of Georg Elser. Beatings andtorture – which included the insertion of metal rods under his fingernails andbeing fed excessively salty herrings – culminated in a personal kicking andwhipping by Heinrich Himmler.Yet the carpenter still stuck to his story that he had acted alone.In Walter Schellenberg’s own account, a complete replica of his carpenter’sworkshop was later placed at Elser’s disposal while he was in captivity. He wasallowed to make a complete reconstruction of the bomb and the wooden pillar.But that still wasn’t enough.‘I want you to use every possible means to induce this criminal to talk,’ theFührer said to Heydrich. ‘Use hypnosis, give him drugs – everything that modernscience has developed in this direction. I’ve got to know who the instigatorsare, who stands behind this thing.’ According to Schellenberg, four of ‘the besthypnotists’ in Germany attempted to hypnotise the carpenter. ‘Only one of themsucceeded,’ he noted, ‘but even under hypnosis, Elser gave exactly the sametestimony as before.’Though Schellenberg thought connecting the events with the two MI6 men wasridiculous, that soon became the official party line. In the hands of thepropaganda machine, the supposed involvement of the British skilfully inflamedthe prejudices and excitements of the Deutsches Volk. Divine providence –supported by telegrams of support from the Pope and services of thanksgiving inGerman churches of many denominations – had saved the Führer.And that was what Adolf Hitler had started to believe himself.‘I had the most extraordinary feeling,’ he later told his personal photographer,‘and I don’t know myself how or why – but I felt compelled to leave the cellarjust as quickly as I could’. His messianic fervour now tipped into the furtherreaches of megalomania, but quietly, behind the scenes, the industrious Heydrichwould reassess security measures: the Führer would never come so close to deathagain from a random act by a member of the public. All future attempts on hislife would come from close associates, all the more remarkable for havingfomented within a growing conspiracy in which members of the Abwehr figuredhighly.images [images/icon.jpg]So far as the real life British secret service was concerned, when the news ofthe Venlo incident came into Broadway Buildings, in one account, C wasashen-faced.‘What the devil are we going to do now?’ Sir Stewart Menzies exclaimed.The capture of Best and Stevens would colour Whitehall’s dealings with thevarious German resistance organisations in the years to come. It hardly helpedthat the new C had believed – and continued to do so – that Stevens and Best’snegotiations had been genuine. Coming directly after Menzies had assumed actingcustodianship of the Secret Intelligence Service – the previous Saturday, 4November – it severely limited the new C’s own room for manoeuvre. ACassandra-like chorus started up as soon as it was clear what had happened.‘Every sort of intrigue is going on by those who want to take over theorganisation,’ Menzies lamented to an MI5 colleague. ‘Criticisms are being madefrom every quarter by ignorant people.’Like the Abwehr at the time of Canaris’s appointment, the Royal Navy did notwant any other service putting its own man in place. The two previous Cs hadbeen admirals and there were those who wanted to recruit another naval man.Foremost among them was the First Sea Lord himself.‘According to custom,’ Winston Churchill had minuted, ‘his appointment shouldfall to a naval officer.’ As a direct consequence, Admiral John Godfrey had beenproposed rather than Colonel Menzies, whom Churchill had happily endorseddespite their sometimes rocky dealings. There was a widespread perception thatMenzies was a higher Tory better suited to hunting, shooting, fishing or, at thevery least, propping up the bar of White’s Club – in one estimation, within theservice, he behaved as ‘a selfish feudal landlord, living comfortably at courton income from serfs and lands that he had never visited’.Sir Stewart himself was only too well aware that his appointment – confirmed atthe end of the month – was controversial. As a result, it made him act withuncharacteristic caution, making many of the criticisms almost self-fulfilling.There were those who felt he was an Edwardian anachronism. Yet as his laterwartime assistant Robert Cecil pointed out, in the run-up to war there had beenlittle change in the way spying was carried out. ‘[I]nvisible inks and falsebeards were still standard issue,’ he noted.Given that the war would usher in immense technological change, others felt thatsome sort of intellectual giant – or at least a technocrat – would be bettersuited to leading the secret service. ‘But this is not the attitude of those whoworked with him in the stress of war,’ Cecil wrote, suggesting that it wasessential to have a man of integrity and cool courage. ‘Menzies was the rightman in the right place at the right time,’ he concluded, and for all his faults,the new C was the only service chief to remain in post by the end of thefighting in 1945.images [images/icon.jpg]In the years since the Bürgerbraükeller explosion, any number of weird andwonderful myths and rumours have been put forward for its cause. As with allconspiracy theories, they have their basis with that hardiest of perennials:that a lone figure could never have been equal to the task. Payne Best, also atSachsenhausen, claimed to have heard that Elser had been removed from Dachau toplace the bomb, while other variations suggest similar complicity. PastorNiemoller heard that Elser was an SS sergeant who had been put up to it by AdolfHitler himself.In Best’s post-war memoirs, the MI6 man tells an odd story about having dealtwith an astrologer, whom he does not identify, some time before the explosion.Somehow, the Gestapo had found out. Why, one interrogator in PrinzAlbrechtstrasse wanted to know, had the Briton told this seer ‘not to return toGermany until after the change of the Moon’? As Best later wrote, he had vaguelyrecalled it was a spot of leg-pulling.During the subsequent investigation, Heinrich Himmler himself summoned aViennese seer who underwent a trance to determine the identity of the potentialassassin. Both Müller and Artur Nebe, chief of the criminal police, watched themedium writhe on a sofa. Nebe termed Himmler ‘incurably credulous’, thoughnothing further was revealed.Within the Abwehr resistance it was felt that Heydrich had put Elser up to it;that was why there was never a formal trial. Another important player developedhis own personal view which is, to say the least, surprising. ‘Schellenberg putsforwards the suggestion that the Munich attempt was deliberately staged anddesigned to establish Hitler’s popularity beyond question, at this early stageof the war,’ Allied investigators later determined. In a post-war interrogation,the counter-intelligence chief was relieved that both Best and Stevens werestill alive, fearful that he might be implicated in war crimes had they beenkilled. ‘[Schellenberg] claims that it was he who saved the lives of bothEnglishmen,’ a summary from MI5 notes. Unarmed, he had kept in the backgroundwhile the gun battle raged, terming the subsequent propaganda exploitation as‘ridiculous’ with its linking to the Bürgerbraükeller explosion.In reality, both events hardly derailed his career. Walter Schellenberg’sgeneral urbanity meant that unlike many of his fellow officers, as David Kahnhas written, he ‘could lunch smoothly with foreigners and befriend youngofficials in the Foreign Office and Propaganda Ministry’. Soon he would beattracting jealousy and the spite of others who wanted him to fail.Intriguingly, in later years, when Walter Schellenberg was asked about thedifference between British and German espionage, his response to a fellow SSofficial was equally revealing. In Britain, espionage was regarded as anoccupation for ‘gentlemen of high social standing’, whereas in Germany ‘theworst and most corrupt elements are recruited as agents’. This, Schellenbergsaid, was a deliberate policy of Admiral Canaris. At the time, as he tried tonavigate the dangerous shoals of intrigue, Schellenberg took care to call theadmiral Germany’s greatest spy and, when further prompted, that Wilhelm Canaris‘was an extremely shrewd man who could be trusted in any direction’.images [images/icon.jpg]The first that the canny Abwehr chief heard of the Venlo incident was two daysafter the explosion on Friday, 10 November. On the Saturday, Canaris called hisDutch experts together in Düsseldorf. ‘What are your friends Stevens and Best upto these days?’ he asked Richard Protze, an old crony from the Great War who nowworked in Abwehr counter-intelligence.‘They are under constant observation, Herr Admiral,’ he lied.Canaris saw through that.‘At this very moment, they’re both in Berlin, closeted with the Gestapo at PrinzAlbrechtstrasse.’It was, the admiral said, all Heydrich’s doing and, in the recollection of asecretary, left them in no doubt that they should be wary of dealing withSchellenberg.In several accounts, Canaris was disturbed by the Venlo incident. Aware that theGestapo might indeed find links with the German resistance, his repeatedrequests for information about the interrogation were turned down. Quite why theSD did not make greater capital remains unknown, with Heydrich referring toCanaris at one point as ‘an old fox with whom one has to be on the watch’.It was around this time that the wily spymaster’s own character changed as hebecame only too well aware of the true nature of the Nazi regime. ‘For though hedetested Hitler, he loved Germany,’ notes David Kahn. ‘Working for Germany,however meant furthering the Führer.’ This growing dilemma caused anguish,transforming Wilhelm Canaris’s sociable, affable exterior into a depressivewreck. ‘I have just seen a madman,’ he reportedly said to a colleague after onemeeting with the Führer. As a result, the admiral would escape – both physicallyand psychologically – by leaving the hornet’s nest of Berlin and travel, mostoften, as we will see, to Spain. To some, these journeys were akin to those ofOdysseus, but as several people have pointed out, the Abwehr chief was more likeanother figure from literature. Wilhelm Canaris was the Hamlet of conservativeGermany, not only fomenting anti-Nazi sentiments but actively encouragingopposition while at the apex of the Führer’s employ.Much of the enduring enigma of Wilhelm Canaris coalesces around the murky yetgrowing anti-Hitler sentiment within the Abwehr and Canaris’s involvement –however tenuous – opening conduits to other secret agencies, particularly theBritish Secret Intelligence Service. Yet too much can be read into these variousapproaches. With the Third Reich triumphant, there would be little publicsupport: and thanks to the Venlo incident, the British treated all subsequentapproaches with severe caution.Several of Canaris’s underlings also took care to reiterate his reticence atconspiracy and how he recoiled from outright treachery. Yet he allowed hisdeputies to organise and strengthen anti-Hitler sentiments under cover of theAbwehr’s secret activities (both would eventually be arrested by the Gestapo).His executive officer, Erwin Lahousen, would refer to his approach as ‘fabulous,tantalizing and sometimes incomprehensible’. When Lahousen joined the Abwehr,Canaris specifically asked him not to bring in any of his ‘damned’ Nazis withhim (as he, like many of the true converts to Nazism, were Austrian). ‘I don’twant any of these swine – or at least, as few of them as possible in theAbwehr,’ Canaris said.Lahousen, in his post-war testimony at Nuremberg, noted that Canaris ‘hatedviolence as such and therefore hated and abominated war, Hitler, his system andparticularly his methods’. On this, Canaris was unequivocal. ‘War means acatastrophe far greater and beyond comprehension for Germany and all material inthe event of this Nazi system,’ he said in the hearing of his executive officer.Ultimately, blood was thicker than water. Wilhelm Canaris’s nephew, SS ColonelConstantin Canaris, told interrogators after the war that his uncle ‘was workingagainst Hitler since the beginning of the war: he intended to do all he could tostir up trouble against him and undermine his influence’.images [images/icon.jpg]By the end of the month it was reported in newspapers around the world thatGeorg Elser had been executed. He wasn’t. Though treated well at first – afterall, a show trial would have had him as a star witness against Britishpoliticians in the event of a German invasion – the carpenter effectivelydisappeared from view. Amazing as it may seem to posterity, it was as late asApril 1945 that Georg Elser was taken from his cell and shot in the head. A weeklater, his death was reported in Germany as due to an air raid.Why, many have wondered, did vengeance come so late?In the last days of the Third Reich, the Führer – consumed by the furies of hisown making – made sure all those who had attempted to destroy him werethemselves avenged. Perhaps the simplest explanation comes from OliverHirschbiegel, the director of the recently released drama about the events,Thirteen Minutes. When publicising the film in the summer of 2015, he said:The Third Reich is the worst example of how methodical the German people are. Ifwe do something we do it thoroughly and never stop. There was no way that thesystem would go down and the war would be lost with Elser remaining alive.Besides, Hitler took it very personally.Georg Elser’s activities have proved controversial in another arena, not leastwhen, in 2000, an academic at the Hannah Arendt Institute called his actionsimmoral, starting a fury of criticism for that assertion and the fact they wouldnot have stopped the war in its tracks. ‘Elser should have either stayed in theBürgerbraükeller and warned the innocents or chosen a method that would onlyhave killed Hitler,’ said Lothar Fritze.Even today – as it was in 1939 – the jury is still out on what exactly GeorgElser achieved.images [images/icon.jpg]A different duel to the death now played out against the backdrop of theheavenly firmament. The instrument which would, over the first few months of1940, link both Karl Krafft and Louis de Wohl – an unlikely pairing of thecosmic yin and yang – was an equally improbable, often impetuous and yeteternally jovial figure by the name of Viorel Virgil Tilea. Controversy wouldeclipse his relatively minor role as the Romanian minister in London. Onehistorian who knew him well has termed him a pallbearer to appeasement. Toothers, he was a puckish bit part player who, in a peculiar way, helped ensurethat European countries went to war3 by lending his name to what became known asthe ‘Tilea affair’. Even today, historians debate whether his issue of a warningor ultimatum about German intentions was crying wolf or provocation. Famously,A.J.P. Taylor termed it ‘a mystery’, others preferring the word ‘bombshell’ and,in prompting the guarantee to Poland by Britain and France, led anotherparticipant to term it ‘one of the maddest acts in our history’.Much of the mystery surrounds the unlikely diplomat himself.The mercurial Tilea was an unlikely choice as a representative of King Carol’sgovernment. A football fan who studied at the London School of Economics – and akey figure in the Anglo Romanian Cultural society – the ambassador waspro-Allied, despite a wife whose utterances were supposedly anti-Semitic.‘He is not really a professional diplomat,’ MI5 later recorded, ‘but isprimarily a businessman.’ In March 1939, Tilea had visited the Foreign Office inLondon with some startling intelligence: that his native government had receivedan ultimatum from the Germans that they wanted to take over the Romanianeconomy. It seems reasonably clear that Viorel Tilea’s warning was neither agrand conspiracy nor a unilateral ultimatum, as several writers (the Romanianhimself among them) have suggested. Over the years, various people claim to havebeen involved – with a princess who seemed better suited to a drawing roommelodrama, broken ciphers, an early morning telephone call and one ofChurchill’s cronies.4 All culminated with a meeting with Lord Halifax in March1939 – after he had seen the Polish, French and Turkish ambassadors – as matterswere coming to a head.Coming three days after the occupation of Prague, there was a great deal atstake. Romania was being forced into a corner, as were most of its neighbours.The Chamberlain government could hardly stand by as country after country fellvictim to Hitler’s aggression, and so offered a diplomatic bulwark in the formof a guarantee.When reported as fact in the London press, there were furious denials fromBerlin, Bucharest and the Romanian Legation in London. Tilea had, in a laterRomanian account, been overzealous. The Propaganda Ministry took up the cudgelsand noted that the idea that Romania should only be a supplier to Germany was,as one report had it, ‘alleged to have been the invention of Sir RobertVansittart’, a notable hawk who did his best to arrest appeasement. Whatfollowed was an international incident which led to trade negotiations and, asTilea himself put it, ‘the signing of the Anglo-Romanian Treaty by which Britaingave a guarantee of sorts’ to his country.But Goebbels’ propagandists went further. Tilea’s actions were designed, theysaid in one report, to hold Germany down, to destroy its friendships ‘and tohold positions or establish new ones for the war desired by the Jews against theReich’. And, according to the London correspondent of the Völkischer Beobachter,it was an attempt to repeat ‘the game the British secret service had played’ inMay 1938, to claim that Germany had mobilised, yet another attempt to blamethings on their favourite bogeyman.images [images/icon.jpg]There is a whiff of intelligence intrigue surrounding the Romanian ambassador’sactivities at the time, with claims that a radio signals unit of the Wehrmachthad been listening in to calls and had broken the ciphers of several Balkancountries. It has also been alleged that Romanian diplomatic bags were beingopened. In his memoirs, Tilea says that when he met his staff at the LondonEmbassy, he was shown a safe that could have been broken with a hairpin. ‘Wemust have another one,’ he said. ‘I have bought a new cipher with me and I donot want it to be broken immediately.’In fairness, Romania was caught between the German devil and a deep red sea ofcommunist influence. ‘One Romanian bird in the hand,’ Adolf Hitler later said ofRussian claims to the region, ‘is worth more than two Russian birds in thebush.’Mineral reserves, oil and transportation – of materials from Germany to theUSSR, which Britain also wanted to stop – all played into the mix. The fate ofRomania was, inevitably, linked to its oilfields which, at one point, were evensuggested as a target for capture. As an MI6 assessment noted, with completecontrol over the oil wells, ‘we do not think Germany, and less still Germanytogether with Italy, could obtain enough petroleum to carry on far more than ayear’.But in the first year of the war, British efforts to deprive Germany of Romanianoil continued in the same hopelessly amateurish vein that had been evident inSweden. Everything Section D touched had turned to disaster. They used King’sMessengers to deliver explosives to British Embassies in Eastern Europe, whichupset both the Foreign Office mandarins in London and the ambassadorsthemselves. An initiative to block the Rhine by blowing up oil-carrying bargeswas thus stopped in its tracks, and things carried on much as before.images [images/icon.jpg]When Viorel Tilea had arrived in Britain in January 1939, he lived in greatstyle and comfort in an Oxfordshire mansion. For the rest of his stay,especially when hostilities were declared, he would spend a greater part of histime plotting against the fascist regime which would take over his nativecountry in the autumn of 1940. In a posthumous appreciation of his virtues, oneobituarist regarded Viorel Tilea as quixotic, lively and mentally most agile –and a very good friend to the British. That this assessment came from the Earlof Lonsdale speaks volumes, too, of his ability to make friends at the apex ofthe Establishment. His social circle was wide and another friendship would leadto – so far as British Intelligence was concerned – rather more surrealramifications.The Romanian ambassador, though an ardent anglophile, had always beenperipatetic. While passing through Switzerland in the spring of 1937, Tilea hadmet some Swiss Germans who were obviously pro-Nazi. One of them was Karl Krafft,whom the ambassador recalled had ‘very good connections in influential circles’despite an obvious flaw. He, like most people, found the astrologer mildlyrepulsive.Oddly, Krafft did seem to be aware of some past aspect of Tilea’s life which hecould not possibly have known about. Mildly intrigued, Tilea met with theastrologer again in Zurich and reluctantly agreed to take part in anastrological experiment.Characteristically, Karl Krafft used the opportunity to expand some of hisstranger theories about racial purity and the inevitable growth of the ThirdReich (which had been codified in his masterwork that was nearly ready forpublication). Tilea queried such bold assertions but was sufficiently intriguedto leave behind the dates of birth and sample writings of two prominentRomanians.The ambassador thought nothing more of it.For the rest of 1938, Tilea and the Swiss astrologer maintained an intermittentcorrespondence which culminated with a request for more information on theambassador’s background. Karl Krafft dutifully made some predictions – ‘out ofcuriosity’ on Tilea’s part – about Corneliu Codreanu, the Romanian fascistleader. Krafft predicted that he would be unlucky to survive beyond November1938 (and he was indeed shot on the last day of that month) as well as that KingCarol would suffer a disastrous reverse in September 1940, the date of hiseventual abdication.But what would come to concern the security forces across the fighting came outof the occasional correspondence between these two unlikely characters – theastrologer and ambassador – which would culminate in an even more opaque mysterywhich one participant has justly referred to it as a ‘bizarre incident’. Itshowed the Nazis would leave no stone unturned in trying to gain any form ofadvantage. What became known as the ‘Tilea letter’ – the first ever of its kindin the prosecution of astrological warfare – would convince British Intelligencethat not only was Adolf Hitler consulting his own seer, but that his identitywas none other than the mildly repulsive Karl Krafft.images [images/icon.jpg]Viorel Virgil Tilea was a marked man.Because he had leaked the German demands to Romania, Tilea had not only beenattacked by name in Goebbels’ broadcasts, he had soon become an obvious ‘personof interest’ to the German intelligence services. A far more subtle attack camecourtesy of the ambassador asking Karl Krafft for his horoscope to be cast. TheReich Main Security Office now became involved. At the start of 1940, the Swissastrologer had shown a draft of his astrological study of Viorel Tilea to hissponsors in Prinz Albretchstrasse. When Krafft went to collect his nextpaycheck, Dr Fesel pulled him to one side. His forecast, he explained, wasn’tsufficiently pro-German. Krafft, true to form, puffed himself up by saying thatthe contents were a private matter and stormed out of the building.A number of drafts were then worked on by unknown hands.At the end of February, a horoscope was finally dispatched to Virgil Tilea witha handwritten note that it had been sent by ‘a friend going to Romania’. Agentsfrom the Sicherheitsdienst had sent it by diplomatic courier, where it was thenmailed from Brasov.Ambassador Tilea himself happened to be in Bucharest when the letter showed up –his mother had just died – and was astonished. Karl Krafft’s letter informed himthat he had deliberately been completely left out of the loop by his owngovernment regarding foreign affairs. Both Romania and Germany, the lettersuggested, had ‘good aspects’.The Third Reich, Krafft also explained, was on the ascendant, for if a‘totalitarian ruler had good aspects, his whole nation benefited from it’. Inhis memoirs, the ambassador suggests that Krafft was also trying to get him toresign by predicting Germany’s successes. Tilea also suspected he was on thereceiving end of some non-too-subtle propaganda and a power play courtesy ofGerman Intelligence.Around this time, Dr Heinrich Fesel had supposedly invited Karl Krafft on somesort of intelligence mission to the Low Countries. When he had heard of theletter, Tilea seems to have been delighted with the ‘cloak and dagger’ aspectsof the affair. He decided to stay in touch with the astrologer on the‘assumption that Krafft would sooner or later be bound to give himself away’. Hehad, as the ambassador explained to several people, seen through that onealright, but wondered what might also result.The fact that Karl Krafft had apparently relocated to Berlin that spring of 1940confirmed all of Viorel Tilea’s suspicions. So far as he was concerned, thetruthfulness of Krafft’s predictions had been compromised by his proximity tothe Führer himself. When a second letter – identical, but which had passedthrough the German censor – turned up, the Romanian ambassador realised theywere trying to crack a nut with a sledgehammer.‘This purposeful duplication of the message confirmed all his previoussuspicions,’ writes Ellic Howe, the late British propagandist who discussed thematter with Tilea after the war. ‘Furthermore, since Krafft must be working forHitler, it only remained to persuade the British to take the necessarycountermeasures.’And there was no mystery as to who might spearhead such an effort.images [images/icon.jpg]Here was Louis de Wohl’s moment of glory.If there was ever going to be any sort of countermeasure to any Germanastrologer, he should be the one. Yet despite his uncanny ability to land on hisfeet, the Hungarian astrologer was encountering suspicion in a London that washardly disposed to mystics or mountebanks, especially those from Eastern Europe.By his own account, de Wohl was ‘suspect as a foreigner, while astrology was nobetter than tea-leaf-reading and crystal gazing’’Once again, Viorel Virgil Tilea would be crucial in getting him taken seriously.Sometime in 1939, the ambassador was introduced to Louis de Wohl via a Romanianbanker. Tilea later received a half-hearted endorsement from the astrologer. AnMI5 report notes of the astrologer’s attitude to his excellency:He is a man who expects a quid pro quo for anything that he does, he hasexcellent manners and in Louis’s opinion might be extremely useful provided heis approached in the proper manner. Louis thinks he might be usable at presentespecially in the United States where the handle ‘His Excellency’ would countfor a lot.In other words, they were similar peas from a pod, their vanity invariablyknowing no bounds. ‘Louis describes Tilea as certainly the most trustworthy ofall the Romanians he has met,’ a military liaison officer noted later that year,‘though this does not necessarily mean a lot.’The MI5 files show that Viorel Tilea was in some sort of financial straits.According to de Wohl, he had asked for £3,000 – ‘a fantastic sum of money to askfor’, the Romanian had claimed – to return home. Apparently, the government hadsent him £2,000. He used that money to pay off his debts to someone called Levi.A short while later, Tilea dutifully informed de Wohl about Krafft’s letterwhich predicted German victory (in time, de Wohl, too, would create horoscopesfor the Romanian ambassador). Tilea took it upon himself to discuss the Krafftbusiness with Sir Orme Sargent, an undersecretary at the Foreign Office.Discreet enquiries were made within Whitehall about countering this use ofastrology. Ironically, Sargent reported back that most of the astrologers in thecountry were rather pessimistic and would not make the best propagandists forthe British cause.‘I know an astrologer who is not pessimistic,’ Tilea replied. ‘His name is Louisde Wohl.’Like a light – or possibly supernova – flashing on, the Hungarian astrologerrealised here was his main chance. If he could make the same calculations asHitler’s astrologers, they could provide great advantages for the Britishgovernment. This part of the story – which de Wohl repeated and embellished overthe years – is confirmed by the records. ‘Recently Tilea showed Louis a letterhe had received from a Swiss astrologer called KRAFFT,’ MI5 noted later thatsame year of 1940. ‘Louis says that Kraft (sic) is one of Hitler’s astrologicaladvisers and that the letter contained a great deal of very skilful propaganda.’Indeed, de Wohl soon became rather adept at spreading rumours that Hitler wasunder the influence of a mysteriously malign astrologer. This was soon picked upby the press such as, for example, the Daily Mail’s Berlin correspondent wasreporting that Adolf Hitler was paying ‘great attention to the advice of hispersonal astrologer’. Louis de Wohl made sure that his own special insightswould prove to be of great advantage to the British, although nobody, at thisstage, could be sure what ‘technical’ methods would be used by this mythicalastrologer (if he indeed existed). In his own mind at least, Louis de Wohlenvisaged himself in a mano à mano struggle with the Führer’s astrologer.‘I realised the danger,’ the Hungarian claimed after the war. ‘Hitler now hadfirst rate astrological advice. This man Krafft had to be fought.’images [images/icon.jpg]From the very beginning, a certain airy wackiness informed the British approachto countering the supposed German obsession with the occult and black magic.Nowhere was it more notable than in the first desperate days of the blitzkriegagainst France. In the spring of 1940 came the serious notion of building anapparatus which could project (propaganda) images on clouds over enemy lines.Amazing as it may seem to posterity, both sides then decided to harness themystical powers of a sixteenth-century mystic as a secret weapon.Michel Nostradamus and his impenetrable quatrains provide anyone who wants itwith the vaguest reading of a future malleable enough to suit their ownpurposes. Whether it is the rise of Hitler, the assassination of John F. Kennedyor, no doubt, the point at which One Direction will split up, the medieval seer,of Jewish descent and Provencal birth, has cast a spell. ‘During his lifetimeand afterword, his words have fascinated and flummoxed the West,’ writesStephane Gerson in a recent study. Nostradamiana, as the cognoscenti call it, isan obsession with many curious cheerleaders.There is something for everyone in the vagueness of his writings. Everygeneration sees something of relevance. Oddly, most of the true believers in thepredictions of Nostradamus always seem to forget that the seer himself thoughtthat most astrologers were incompetent. ‘Let the profane and ignorant herd keepaway,’ he had warned. ‘Let all astrologers, idiots and barbarians stay far off.’And perhaps Karl Krafft should have heeded Nostradamus’s own warning.For him, the Tilea business had been terrifying. Far from being manipulated byunknown spiritual forces, Krafft never really saw what was happening to him. Forthe next five years of war, he would predict endless victories for the Naziregime, believing he was inching ever closer to the orbit of his hero – theFührer – to assume pole position: Adolf Hitler’s own astrologer. In reality, hebecame a prisoner trapped in a gilded case of his own stupendous arrogance.images [images/icon.jpg]Nostradamus’s fellow citizens were equally susceptible to his mysteriousquatrains.In pre-war France, as in Berlin, a rising tide of fortune tellers plied theirtrade and, as one recent chronicler has noted: ‘In the early 1930s, a Parisiancould begin his day with an astrological consultation at the NostradamusInstitute, located on the rue de Fauberg Saint-Honore.’ After lunch, he couldattend a public talk or purchase a magazine devoted to those quatrains. Thecollapse of Europe according to Nostradamus’s Prophecies was one of more thantwenty books published between 1937 and 1939 as the political situation withNazi Germany worsened.When war came, French newspapers were soon reporting that citizens were lookingto Nostradamian prophecies for insight. A communist poet, Louis Aragon, latercomplained that his fellow countrymen were making the seer ‘their shadowy,stupefying refuge’. With war looming, government officials asked one particularastrologer called Martin Privat – a journalist who, like Louis de Wohl, foundcasting horoscopes more profitable – to look into the matter. Monsieur Privatsoon published 1940, Year of French Grandeur, which predicted forthcomingmisfortunes for Franco, Stalin and Goebbels. Ultimately, the astrologer claimed,les français would prevail. ‘The West will not kneel down,’ Privat promised.‘France and Great Britain have no reason to worry.’During the successful invasion of France that May, the German PropagandaMinistry disseminated specially written threatening quatrains which were thendropped via leaflets from low-flying aircraft. The verses suggested thatsouth-east France would not be affected by the carnage, thus encouragingcivilian populations to move in that direction. These dozen lines of speciallywritten doggerel were used to seemingly little effect. Ironically, after theoccupation of France, the French authorities actually banned Nostradamiana so asnot to give offence to the Occupying Powers.Yet Britain, too, was interested in Nostradamus.A strange pamphlet, Nostradamus predicts the course of the war, would appear afew years later under Sefton Delmer’s inspired guidance. The text was ascribedto German academics but came from someone who liked to be seen as a Nostradamianfigure, a seer and towering giant of prophecy. The ultimate irony was that thiswas a future that the author, Louis de Wohl, could never quite envisage.images [images/icon.jpg]Nazifying Nostradamus was almost inevitable.A postal official who claimed to have discovered the ‘numerological key’ hadpredicted in the twenties that Nostradamus predicted ‘a prophet with a raginghead’ who would transform the world. In one story that partisans of the occultlike to tell, it was Magda Goebbels who woke her husband after being hooked onthis same book. Although viewing astrology as some sort of medieval throwback,the Propaganda Minister asked Krafft for help.Because he had already declared that Nostradamus had predicted that the ThirdReich would ultimately be victorious, Karl Krafft was given some latitude by theGestapo. He could continue publishing on Nostradamus with the understanding thathe would not discuss his findings (or astrological predictions) in public.Within a year, Krafft’s own How Nostradamus Perceived The Future of Europepredicted a collective nervous breakdown in London, world domination fortotalitarian states and the reign and glory of Great Germania.Yet a mental collapse took place somewhat nearer to home. From the start of1940, Krafft worked with an old colleague who was distinctly frightened by whatthey were doing. ‘During those weeks we both had one foot in a concentrationcamp,’ his friend George Lucht would write. Their every move was watched by theGestapo, and Lucht, more so than the gullible Krafft, was aware that matterswere moving far beyond their control. Within a month, his reluctant colleaguewanted to leave because he and Krafft were not getting on – exploiting andperverting Nostradamus was, in Lucht’s opinion, shameful. Calling it all a loadof nonsense, Lucht left to work in an aircraft factory.Krafft, indefatigable to the last, continued his work and distributed a limitednumber of facsimile editions of Les Prophéties (a work on Nostradamus which wasonly ever available to his friends). Yet the RSHA was worried. They wouldn’t lethis work appear until the end of the year because it appeared to predict anattack on the Low Countries, which was then being planned. And despite laterclaims of conspiracies involving the manipulation of the French seer’s words, itwas always limited in scope.The biggest problem – as with all Nostradamian predictions – was in bending hisopaque prognostications into something that fitted contemporaneously. ‘WhatGoebbels called “occultist propaganda” could both deny human powers of decisionmaking and at the same time spur people to action,’ notes the academic StephaneGerson. ‘It could provide authority and at the same time discredit.’ And in thisregard, there was a later irony that, in one account, when newspapers – inSpain, Sweden and Britain – followed up some of the Nazi propaganda by posingthe question ‘Who is Nostradamus?’, the answer was, ironically, suggested to beAdolf Hitler.images [images/icon.jpg]And so all the various strange themes in this chapter – astrology, the occultand intelligence would come together – with the desperate situation GreatBritain found itself in the early summer of 1940. It would be feared by variousarms of British Intelligence that astrology might become a powerful weapon forthe less mystical but equally malign purposes of propaganda. This would be thegenesis of perhaps the most peculiar efforts ever attempted in the secret warwhose protagonist, as we will see, was none other than Louis de Wohl.This would be one of his greater achievements in working in tandem with BritishIntelligence, the unlikely genesis of perhaps the most peculiar efforts everattempted in the secret war. ‘Because it is claimed that astrology is an exactscience and leads reputable astrologers to the same conclusions,’ one wartimereport for the normally staid Naval Intelligence Division states, ‘it seemedpossible to ascertain what advice was, in fact, being offered to Hitler.’Foremost amongst them: when was the invasion going to land?NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 The former Käthe Kartekamp, a seamstress, was another victim. WalterSchellenberg complained of her carelessness, her frumpiness and – so far as anup and coming bureaucrat was concerned – the worse things of all, poor spelling,grammar and handwriting. Because of this, Schellenberg felt he was being heldback in his career. Matters came to a head when she later attacked him,threatened suicide but divorced him after being offered the purchase of awell-run fashion business. ‘None of you know my husband,’ she later toldHeydrich. ‘He’s selfish. He can never stick to what he says.’2 Given some of the often repeated inaccuracies about this evening, thetimings of events are highly important. Records show that Adolf Hitler finishedhis speech at 9.07 p.m.: he left the beer hall five minutes later at 9.12 p.m.;the explosion took place at 9.20 p.m. There were – as the title of the recentfilm shows – just thirteen minutes between finishing his speech and theexplosion.3 The ‘Tilea affair’ is enlivened by a series of often anachronisticcharacters, many of whom would not have been out of place in a drawing roommelodrama. Chief amongst them was a woman of letters, Princess Bibescu, theParis-based habitué of salons with an incomparable list of political contacts.‘The Germans are at our border,’ Tilea told her. ‘Give up industry and remain anagricultural country.’ Behind the scenes, she alerted an MP and, in turn, LordHalifax himself (as he explained in person to Tilea).Where the actual warning had come from was not revealed until 1996 by Tilea’snephew during a radio interview. Reading directly from his uncle’s notes, theambassador recorded that on Friday, 17 March 1939 his phone had rung at 6 a.m.The voice belonged to Adrian Dumitescu, businessman and general manager ofMalaxa, one of the bigger industrial concerns in the country. Its eponymousfounder, Nicolea Malaxa, was, like Admiral Canaris, of Greek origin and close toKing Carol II, the cause of much speculation at the time. Later that sameafternoon, Tilea called on Lord Halifax in what might be politely termed anexcitable state.4 Churchill’s crony Bob Boothby always liked to claim he was the mastermind.According to one diary account, he claimed that he had made up the story – orrather, suggested to his good friend Tilea that he pass it on to the newspapers.‘Viorel Tilea was a nice but impetuous man,’ Boothby himself later wrote. ‘Hetold me that he was determined to embark on a campaign designed to produceaction.’ Boothby suggested it would be foolish to provoke a premature crisis.‘His activities, however, had some effect,’ Boothby noted, precipitating theguarantee to Poland, which he later termed ‘one of the maddest acts in all ourhistory’. All these themes are covered in Sidney Aster’s splendid paper, TheTilea Affair."},{"pageContent":"6DESPERATE MEASURES [contents.htm#a9]If we can avoid defeat this summer and stabilise, we still have to find some wayof winning the war. We are certainly not going to win the war by offensives inmass and the only way of success is by undermining Germany internally and byaction in the occupied territories. German aggression has in fact presented uswith an opportunity never before equalled in history for bringing down a greataggressive power by irregular operations, propaganda and subversion enlarginginto rebel activities … Seen in this light, the war may be regarded as aninter-connected series of wars of independence … It must be recognised as aprinciple that not only are these activities part of the grand strategy of thewar, [but] probably the only hope of winning the war.Briefing by Director, Military Operations, Sir John Kennedy,to Chiefs of Staff, 7 June 1940, HS 8/259The glorious weather that Whitsun (the traditional Christian holiday which fellon the last Sunday of May) was strangely balmy and peaceful that early summer of1940. Despite the horrifying circumstances of war, most holidaymakers attractedby the traditional seaside delights of Southend looked like they didn’t have acare in the world. But two men, one in naval uniform, the other in armyfatigues, certainly did. Even the most casual glance would have shown them to bebrothers. As they strolled along the seafront deep in conversation, theybetrayed none of the suppressed hysteria which had propelled them here.In Whitehall a letter had arrived, supposedly written by a German agent – allthe more authentic, so it was believed, thanks to misspellings and grammaticalinaccuracies – which suggested the German attack was imminent. That theblitzkrieg would be unleashed upon the Essex town that was disparaged for itswhelks and cheap entertainments was just one of the more bizarre rumours whichhad gathered like so many distraught seabirds all along the shore on that fineafternoon. Yet the veracity of the warning was vouched for by the JointIntelligence Committee, where, in the secret world at least, the buck came to aresounding halt.Which was why Ian and Peter Fleming were there.Older than his brother by just a year, Peter cast a long shadow in which theyounger Ian had grown up. Equally effortlessly charming and confident, they had,as children, fought continually and, though still close in adulthood, were verydifferent. Whereas the younger Ian had been a Sandhurst dropout with a somewhatraffish reputation, Peter Fleming was serious, more handsome and certainly themore accomplished with his bestselling pre-war travelogues. His contemporariesat Eton had considered him the most charismatic man of his generation and, inhis long marriage to Celia Johnson (of later Brief Encounter fame), by far themore illustrious.Now the brothers relished any time they could spend in each other’s company.‘They were an attractive pair, amusing, good looking, sure of themselves, anddevoted to each other,’ recorded their good friend Joan Bright. ‘In detachmentfrom his surroundings which was part of Peter’s character was also present, in adifferent way, in Ian’s.’ The invasion, it was confidently expected, would comeat one o’clock the next morning. For now, the Fleming brothers encountered adistinctly carefree afternoon. ‘Bands played in Palm Court lounges, courtingcouples strolled along the front, queues stood outside cinemas,’ one of themlater wrote. ‘Phlegm, we felt, was being carried a bit too far.’If the blitzkrieg was shortly to be unleashed, these two gentlemen – both formerTimes correspondents – would act as official recorders, reporting on whatactually happened as opposed to what Josef Goebbels’ propagandists wouldundoubtedly claim. They spent the rest of the evening on the roof of theirhotel, alert for any signs of impending enemy activity. Scanning the horizon andthe skies, the invasion never came. ‘[As] the night wore on,’ Peter would laterwrite, ‘we found it increasingly difficult to take the whole businessseriously.’In this regard, other such rumours were not isolated and it was clear – despitethe muddles that were still taking place in the corridors of power with regardto propaganda – that the only way to fight rumour was with counter-rumour. Andin this regard, both Fleming brothers would come to play their own unique rolein what was sometimes disparagingly called ‘attacking Hitler with your mouth’.Within the Naval Intelligence Division, the future father of James Bond hadsettled on ‘Rumour As A Weapon’ to give greater prominence to rumours in themedia. ‘It is submitted that there is no lack of suitable “rumour information”:it is an effective “rumour gun” which needs to be devised.’ In time, Ian Flemingwould liaise with MI6 and the somewhat confused set-up for the prosecution ofpropaganda. For now, Lieutenant Fleming RNVR was enough of a realist to knowthat the scope of these activities was small beer.The same would go for subterfuge, sabotage and guerrilla operations, which asnoted before, had been wrapped up with propaganda. Peter, in his guise asCaptain R.P. Fleming, had already been recruited to elevate ‘special means’ intoa viable weapon of war. As with the farcical situation concerning propaganda,subversion and sabotage would continue to be mired in personal animosity,duplicity and bureaucratic incompetence for the next few months. Unusual formsof warfare would need to be transformed from a popgun to a howitzer to have anykind of impact, and the Fleming brothers would play a central role in thattransformation.images [images/icon.jpg]Sometime in the late 1950s, when the James Bond novels were being published togrowing acclaim, Columbia Pictures in Hollywood decided to investigate thebackground of their author. After all, his publishers claimed, he had been aspecial assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence. But research threw uponly a further puzzle.‘This Fleming seems only to write travel novels,’ one of the researchers found.Right surname, wrong sibling. We must marvel at the way in which they got theFleming brothers mixed up, but the moguls of Hollywood would have been surprisede’er yet at the achievements of Ian Fleming’s elder brother. Superlatives hadattached themselves to him throughout his life with the adjectives‘imperturbable’ and ‘buoyant’ most often associated with him.‘Peter Fleming was a very agreeable man,’ said one colleague from the early partof the war. ‘He had a brilliant brain, was a quick thinker and a wit with a keensense of humour.’ There was a serious side, too, perhaps the result of losingtheir father during the Great War, which in the way of all older children,propelled Peter to assuming the mantle of responsibility. After going up toChrist Church, Oxford, in the autumn of 1926, he developed a habit that wouldastound people who met him for the rest of his life. Billowing in his wake waswhat one colleague memorably called ‘an odour reminiscent of motor tyres burningin syrup’. Childhood illness had destroyed his sense of smell so he was oftenhardly aware of the effect his pipe-smoking ever had on his surroundings.Like his brother, people always warmed to Peter Fleming.‘Unlike many authors of travel books who turn out to be pale, bespectacledlittle men,’ Dennis Wheatley famously remarked, ‘his bronzed tight-skinned facealways gave the impression that he had only just returned from an arduousjourney across the Mongolian desert or up some little known tributary of theAmazon.’Southend, then, had hardly been a stretch.As the author of Brazilian Journey, he had written with typical insouciance that‘São Paulo is like Reading, only much farther away’. By the time he and Ian hadtravelled to Southend at the end of May 1940, Peter Fleming had beeneffortlessly commissioned into the Grenadier Guards after having worked in thatcurious, rarefied branch of military intelligence, MI (R). That Whitsun, theFleming brothers spent a quiet, ultimately pointless evening, enjoying eachother’s company and catching up on family news. There was a certain symbolismthat on the holiday weekend which celebrated the ascension of Jesus into heaven,Peter Fleming, too, had recently returned from the dead.In recent weeks he had been reported missing after the disastrous Norwaycampaign, where Captain R.P. Fleming had been the first British serviceman toland in the fjords. Peter subsequently had the equally bizarre experience ofreading his own obituary. Swedish newspapers had reported the rumours that hehad been killed and, to the chagrin of the family, a flurry of headlines in theLondon tabloids resulted, along the lines of ‘AUTHOR KILLED IN NORWAY’.Taking it all in his stride with his usual aplomb (‘We Flemings are ahard-boiled lot,’ he would later say, ‘but even so …’), Peter Fleming returnedto Scotland and made his way south. ‘Hitler had missed the bus in Norway,’ washow he wittily recalled it in a later broadcast. ‘I had missed the train atInverness; but it didn’t seem to have made much difference to Hitler.’Norway had been a disaster. The British response to the Norwegian invasion wasmuddled and the Chamberlain Cabinet was, in one general’s later recollection, ‘abewildered flock of sheep’. Worse, its most vociferous hawk – Winston SpencerChurchill – had simply failed to recognise that the Royal Navy was not ready toengage the Germans in a fight. Oddly, on his return to London, Peter Fleming hadbeen treated to a remarkable show from the First Sea Lord, whose ownresurrection, politically speaking, would result from the very same disaster ofwhich he had been a key architect.images [images/icon.jpg]As the first son of a banking dynasty, it had been expected that Peter Flemingwould carry the torch for the family business. But in every sense of the word,the eldest son took a very different route. ‘He was the writer in the family,’Ian would later declaim. At Oxford, Peter had been editor of The Isis magazineand a member of the Bullingdon Club. He had also trodden the boards, but it wasquite some time later that Peter met up with an actress who had just made herstage debut and was already well on her way to stardom. Ironically, they didn’tmake any impression on each other at that time. But his later marriage to CeliaJohnson was very important to him, the rock on which his life was anchored.Yet Peter Fleming remained peripatetic. After leaving Oxford he travelled acrossSpain, then to the United States before working at The Spectator, where hearranged sabbaticals so that he could go on further adventures. In April 1933,he saw an advert in The Times which, as his biographer remarks, was ‘justfar-fetched enough to appeal to him’. ‘Exploring and sporting expedition, underexperienced guidance, leaving England June to explore rivers central Brazil,’ itbegan. This strange blandishment led to the book with which he would be foreverassociated – Brazilian Adventure – and which established his name. He alsodeveloped a professional proximity to The Times, in whose name he travelledaround the Far East in the 1930s as a special correspondent, reporting on thefighting between the nationalists and the communists on the Chinese mainland.He loved China – and adventure. In 1936, he travelled from China to India onfoot. That sometimes gruelling trek of 3,500 miles between Peking and Kashmir(‘with many dangers, hardships and hold ups’ as his entry in the Dictionary ofNational Biography understates it) would lead to his incomparable News FromTartary. For the rest of his pre-war career, Peter alternated travelling andwriting, both allowing him to chronicle the experience of war, folly andmisfortune with characteristic verve and wit. After marrying Celia, he took herwith him on his fourth trip East and followed the progress of the Sino–JapaneseWar in 1938.This added another important ingredient to his métier: intelligence, especiallyabout the mysterious East, was badly needed. His travels gave him a uniqueunderstanding and experience of foreign military powers. Unlike his brother, ofwhom it was said could suffer anything but discomfort, Peter Fleming couldeasily adapt to unusual surroundings in the harshest of circumstances. Given hisknowledge of exotic and far-flung places, it was almost inevitable that, withthe onset of war, Peter Fleming would be called upon for ‘special services’.images [images/icon.jpg]As with the secret service, other branches of British Intelligence were lookingto expand. The War Office, as already noted, was distinguished by having asmall, self-contained research department known as Military Intelligence(Research) – MI (R) for short – which, as one who knew its work put it, ‘alwaysseemed oddly named for it had been more concerned with operational ideas thanresearch’. Its staff were assiduously combing Army reserve lists for writers,explorers and experts on foreign countries who could be put to better use thanjust ordinary conscription. Someone of Peter Fleming’s calibre would surely havebeen near the top of anybody’s list of potential recruits. Clever,well-travelled and self-confident officers were at a premium, not least, as oneMI (R) report noted, ‘if war breaks out early’.So, as Peter Fleming’s biographer attests, that same month of August 1939 he wastelephoned by a shadowy colonel and asked if he could leave for China straightaway. By now MI (R) had started to look at ‘what is loosely-termed guerrillawarfare’ in central Europe, North Africa and the Far East. As a well-knowntraveller in Asia, it was no wonder Captain Fleming had already been identifiedas a possible expert. ‘Peter Fleming is remarkable and a useful contributor,’the Deputy Director of Military Intelligence noted in August 1939.His specialist knowledge, it was explained, meant he could train Chineseinsurrectionists against the Japanese. Though busy with his journalism, PeterFleming swiftly penned a paper for MI (R) innocuously termed ‘Notes on thePossibility of British Military Action in China’ which, as he noted, ‘are basedon a fleeting and picaresque experience of the foreign communities in China’.1In an interesting foretaste of his approach to warfare, Captain R.P. Flemingsuggested that British officers should not just send advisers but act asinsurrectionaries and establish cavalry units to impress the local Chinese. Inthe event of hostilities, he emphasised, all this disparate attrition activityshould be accelerated and intensified. To turn it into an effective weapon ofwar, what was needed, above all else, was to define its scope – and, of course,finance.Peter Fleming was preaching to the converted.Subversive and guerrilla tactics had been used at various times to quellrestlessness in the near and far reaches of Empire, particularly in Ireland andthe Palestine mandate, with varying degrees of success. Now they would beexpanded and built upon. In each territory, there would be preliminaryreconnaissance, a mission headquarters and propaganda which ‘should be laid onat an early stage’. Even a handful of British officers (on night patrols andraiding parties) would have a considerable impact as guerrilla leaders. Anyobstacles, from a logistical and diplomatic point of view, could easily beovercome.In the end, for reasons which remain unclear, he wasn’t posted to the Far East.Peter Fleming would thus spend the rest of the Phoney War in London, continuinghis journalism and eventually having to consider some of his guerrillatechniques in more familiar territory.images [images/icon.jpg]The issue which had so exercised the First Sea Lord – and would shortly causeembarrassing headlines – was increasingly looking like a busted flush. The fearsabout Swedish iron ore seemed to have evaporated with the return of spring. Atthe start of April 1940, newspapers were reporting that exports had been afraction of what they had been in peacetime. In other words, the essentialsupplies to feed the German war machine no longer seemed to matter so much.But Adolf Hitler had thought otherwise.The Führer would lavish extra special attention on the Norwegian ports andharbours, whose seizure, he believed, was crucial. Capturing Norway wouldrestrict Britain’s mercantile fleets to ensure they would not have freedom ofthe seas. That way, unlike the previous naval engagements in the Great War, theFührer believed he could deny total victory to the Royal Navy.As a result, the Norwegian port of Narvik would become crucial. As Norway’s onlyall-weather port, it could feed Germany’s voracious war machine all year round.So when, on 10 April 1940, the Luftwaffe landed on Norwegian airfields, it wasobvious why. It took the Wehrmacht just three days to capture all the country’sports (including Narvik) cities and airfields.The British response, as Peter Fleming reflected long afterwards, was a mess.He was hardly alone in being sickened by the chaos and sheer inefficiency. ‘Theerrors were so gross,’ he would later lament, ‘the muddles so pervasive and thewhole affair over so quickly that there weren’t really a great deal to belearned from it.’ And yet when he arrived back in London, he was treated to abreathtakingly bizarre spectacle, that of the First Sea Lord parading around hisinner sanctum at the War Office in his silk dressing gown and about to smoke acigar.Peter Fleming asked his lordship if he would mind if he lit his own pipe.‘Yes,’ came Winston Churchill’s considered reply, ‘I bloody well do!’Captain Fleming was left with the distinct impression that here was someone whocould win the war almost single-handedly. Despite pushing for the Norwegiancampaign, Winston Churchill survived the political fallout which subsequentlysaw the House of Commons in uproar. Parliament’s debate over the fiasco in thefjords on 7 and 8 May 1940 was querulous. After a tired and defensive speech byNeville Chamberlain, various speakers heaped scorn on the lacklustre primeminister. Leo Amery would serve the most devastating broadside, ending with aCromwellian flourish: ‘Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the nameof God, go.’Two days later, he did, as events accelerated.On Friday, 10 May 1940, the Germans invaded the Low Countries. That samemorning, when Neville Chamberlain called in Winston Churchill and ForeignSecretary Lord Halifax (‘that slope-shouldered scarecrow in a derby hat’ inAndrew Roberts’s pithy phrase) it was clear that his lordship was the primeminister’s chosen successor.2 But Halifax wanted to recuse himself and, asChurchill would note, ‘by the time he had finished it was clear that the dutywould fall on me’.Winston Churchill’s elevation to the premiership would not be universallyapplauded, not least by many in the military establishment and the body politic.Everyone, as his private secretary famously remarked, was more than a littlefrightened of him. ‘The mere thought of Churchill as P.M. sends a cold chilldown the spines of the staff at Number 10 Downing Street,’ Sir John (‘Jock’)Colville would famously add. ‘The country had fallen into the hands of anadventurer.’images [images/icon.jpg]Outnumbered, outmanoeuvred and now outflanked, Great Britain would stand aloneat this most perilous phase in its history. German victory was yet anotherforegone assumption. As the Luftwaffe prepared to fight the Royal Air Force,with German aircraft outnumbering British ones nearly three-to-one, there waslittle left in the British arsenal to counter the supremacy of the Führer’sforces.Desperate times would call for desperate measures.In the absence of real forces, the British would have to rely on bluff, blusterand more than a little surreal effort. They were all the country had. Salvationwould come from the cast of characters already noted in this narrative so far.At the apex of this new structure came the politician whose restlessness would,it was feared, ‘get up to the most extraordinary things and undertakeastonishing adventures’, in his assistant private secretary’s estimation.Despite Jock Colville’s sense of foreboding, extraordinary adventures andastounding things would transform the secret war. It would be WinstonChurchill’s presiding genius that special means, stratagems and unorthodox formsof warfare would be transformed into a potent weapon of war. The new primeminister would develop – almost overnight in his urgency and attention to detail– acts of clandestinity and terminal violence which, oddly enough, he turnedfirst on the secret services themselves.Within nine days, even the critical Colville had changed his mind, noting in hisdiary that despite the prime minister’s shortcomings, he was the only man forthe job. Churchill’s own devotion to the secret world, as one historian haswritten, ‘while often dismissed as Boys’ Own romanticism, was also hard-headedlypragmatic and could on occasion be ruthless’. Nobody would be safe from hisgimlet gaze, not even long-serving denizens of the secret world who had servedhim well, but whose more recent performance had been seen as severely lacking.images [images/icon.jpg]The farcical situation in Southend in which the Fleming brothers had foundthemselves was just one symptom of the spy fever that was now running rampantafter the invasion of continental Europe. ‘Fifth column’ paranoia became a newnational preoccupation, with the notion of behind-the-scenes saboteurs andquislings a constant topic of speculation. ‘There is a fifth column in Britain,’one official booklet announced. ‘Anyone who thinks there isn’t has simply falleninto the trap laid by the fifth column itself. For the job of the fifth columnis to make people think that it does not exist.’And there were still the persistent rumours that fifth columnists had opened thedoors for the invaders in mainland Europe. The security authorities had toinvestigate each and every whisper. ‘It was a time when stories of Germanparachutists dressed as nuns,’ one secret servant would write, ‘Charlie Kunz,the bandleader passing information to the enemy through broadcast foxtrots andLord Haw-Haw’s infallible knowledge of when the town hall clock had stoppedfound easy credence.’Rumour and counter-rumour mingled in the lingering summer twilight: of fireworksbeing used to guide German bombers to their targets; of farmers mowing fieldsand deliberately leaving behind chevrons of arrows to point towards cities; orthe signalling of illicit messages from formations of suspicious patterns in theground, such as arrows pointing from Snowdonia to Liverpool Docks, a story whicheven today is more than likely an urban myth despite claims for its veracity.It was an alarming time, which Peter Fleming recalled involved ‘aliens beingrounded up, signposts taken down, milestones uprooted, street-namesobliterated’. With the outbreak of war, all German and Austrian nationals whowere resident in Britain had to report to local police stations. Some wereimmediately detained, while others had their movements severely restricted.After the invasion of France, the situation changed drastically. Internmentorders were extended overnight on the direct order of the prime minister. Chiefconstables were given the power to intern anyone deemed ‘suspect’. The influx ofdispossessed émigrés from all across Europe made matters even worse. From May toJuly, roughly 22,000 Germans and Austrians, as well as 4,000 Italians, wereinterned.It was hardly Winston Churchill’s finest hour, for there were, as one laterenquiry declared, ‘gross mistakes and pathological stupidities’ in rounding upthe suspects. In some case, Jewish refugees were herded together with Nazisympathisers, who continued to taunt them. Certainly the perceived threat fromenemy agents, and the flood of enquiries to government departments whichresulted, burst the registry of the Security Service, MI5. Ramshackle cardindexes of information on potential subversives or known troublemakers could notkeep up with the sheer volume of information being reported.The Security Service was completely overwhelmed.As a result, the new prime minister’s first act was one of terminal ferocity.General Vernon Kell was brought into Downing Street and summarily fired. Thoughhe had served Winston Churchill well in the First World War in rooting outGerman spies, there was no sentiment in the prime minister’s precipitateactions. Now aged 67, Kell was in poor health, often plodding and increasinglyout of his depth.Both he and the organisation he was directing were perceived as failing. As theofficial in-house history notes, ‘the Security Service as a whole was in a statewhich can only be described as chaotic.’ Kell was called into the Treasury, toldby the head of the civil service that changes were needed and was dismissedstraightaway. It was obvious who was behind it. A few days later, Lady Kellgathered MI5 staff in the canteen and announced, ‘Your precious Winston hassacked the general.’ Both the general and his formidable wife would be bitterthat the prime minister didn’t have the common decency to do it in person.The Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service wondered if he was next. WhenColonel Stewart Menzies was called in by the prime minister himself, manypresumed he too would have a rough ride. The pre-war disbelief that invariablyaccompanied CX reports was hardly helped by the fact it had reported – the daybefore it happened – to the Foreign Office on 9 May, ‘there was no chance of aninvasion of the Netherlands’. As the acerbic Colville noted in his diaries, ‘somuch for our renowned foreign agents’.Similar disbelief hung over Whitehall like a noxious cloud. At one of theirfirst meetings, as the authorised MI6 history notes, Churchill ‘dressed [C] downroundly for his failure to produce more information from German-occupiedterritories’. But as Menzies argued, the failures at Venlo had ‘badly dislocatedthe organisation’ and after the occupation, they had lost most of the mainlandnetworks. But, as the official Foreign Office historian has noted, ‘it was not asituation to inspire Whitehall’s confidence in MI6’s capacity either to meet aninvasion threat or to engage in counter-espionage.’Though some high-level sources in Berlin, Scandinavia and the Baltic provideduseful information, the problem – as with all human sources of intelligence –was picking up the wishful thinking of the émigrés. At least the PM had faith inthe current C, and despite the perceived failures, Menzies was the only servicechief to start and end the war.3 There would be other wholesale changes, so muchso that with the apotheosis of Winston Spencer Churchill, ‘the hope wasbeginning to form by June 1940 that, before too long, the gap between the Germansuccess and British failure, in intelligence as in the field of strategy wouldbe reduced’.Above all else there remained pressing questions which only the secret servicescould answer.When would the invasion come?And where?images [images/icon.jpg]Clearly, by the summer of 1940, enough was enough so far as sabotage wasconcerned. There would be no more room for amateurishness, not if WinstonChurchill had anything to do with it. As the authorised MI6 history notes,Section D’s incompetence meant C would ‘wash his hands of Grand’ for Sir Stewartcould see that General Lawrence Grand had too much responsibility, oftenrepresented his own views as those of C and – as he admitted at a ministerialdiscussion – even he couldn’t control him. Taken together, the lingeringfailures cast a baleful shadow along with the ‘multiplicity of bodies dealingwith sabotage and subversive activities’, as one report has it.All would be replaced with a new agency dedicated to mayhem, destruction and theprosecution of propaganda. The politician chosen to handle this new agency was,in his own estimation, known as Dr Dynamo, an economist by training who hadshaped Labour Party foreign policy in the thirties. Dr Hugh Dalton was convincedof his own importance, able and restless. Thanks to what one politicalbiographer has termed his own paranoia, ‘most of the sabotage and subversiontook place in Whitehall’.Yet Dalton – for all his bombast and bullying, which masked his insecurities –was a power within the Labour Party and had, as several people have noted, apathological hatred of the Germans. The Special Operations Executive (SOE) woulduse acts of clandestinity and violence to ‘set Europe ablaze’, in the primeminister’s apposite phrase. Winston Churchill had made it clear he wantedgreater control of the resistance movement in Europe, and Dalton was his chosenrepresentative on Earth. Section D would be hived off into this neworganisation, though that summer of 1940, after the various disasters across theEnglish Channel, the SOE couldn’t set anything much afire. It also took over thevarious half-hearted attempts at propaganda and soon found itself immersed ineven greater infighting.Over the next few months, SOE spent a great deal of its time bickering with MI6for resources and transportation. Worse, it was widely seen as an upstart,‘inevitably viewed with suspicion and jealousy by all existing departments’, asone member presciently noted. Where the secret service operated by stealth, theSOE literally wanted to blow things up. Indeed, Sir Stewart Menzies came to viewthe Special Operations Executive as ‘amateur, dangerous and bogus’, hardlyhelped by the location of its new headquarters close by the fictional residenceof Sherlock Holmes.These Baker Street irregulars were suspect because of their lack of security andswashbuckling disregard for safety. Menzies was happy to let them do what theywanted, providing they didn’t compromise MI6 operations. In the longer term, asC noted, ‘the grave dislocation running two sections of the secret service withintimately interlocking interest under two masters’ would have to be resolved.And watching with interest over his various charges, Dr Dalton, who knew a thingabout political infighting and where the power lay, would note that by thefollowing spring Churchill considered C a wonderful fellow, was always callingfor him and noted, significantly, that ‘we must not have quarrels with C, whohas become so invulnerable’.images [images/icon.jpg]If there was a German invasion it was most likely to come ashore in the Gardenof England, Kent, and at least one secret servant manqué saw that rumours couldbe used to unnerve potential invaders.Come to England this summer and sample the fun we have prepared for you. Trybathing in our barbed-wire enclosures … Try jumping in our ditches and get burntalive. Come by air and meet our new death ray … England or Hell – it’s going tobe just the same you in either.So wrote Dennis Wheatley in a paper he prepared for the War Office.Now in his early 40s, he was finding it hard to find a proper berth. He wouldpublish nine books during the war, all bestsellers, but was still having a hardtime convincing the authorities that he could make a valuable contribution. Whatis puzzling is that he was constantly overlooked by the secret services eventhough most of his immediate family were in the employ of MI5. Somehow hemanaged to slip through the net.Towards the end of May 1940, a delicate, charming captain attached to the WarOffice was being driven by a female driver after a meeting with the SecurityService. Hubert Stringer was preoccupied with a depressing, sadly inevitabletask: how to resist the invasion in the face of far stronger forces?‘Apart from routine stuff,’ he lamented to his driver, ‘I don’t seem to be ableto think of much we can do.’His driver smiled. ‘Why don’t you ask my husband?’ Joan Wheatley asked.And in extolling her husband’s virtues – ‘his specialty is original ideas,’ shesaid with understated firmness – Captain Stringer saw the point. Dennis Wheatleyjumped at the chance of contributing to what would be a new form of warfare.That same evening, he wrote nearly 7,000 words by working flat out through thenight. Two nights later, Captain Stringer visited the Wheatley home in St JohnsWood and knocked back some drink. After a cursory glance (complimenting him that‘it seems full of good ideas’), the captain didn’t want to disabuse thebest-selling author of their importance.‘The trouble is that the machinery creaks so,’ he lamented.So with Stringer’s blessing, Dennis Wheatley forwarded the material to ‘friends’in the various service ministries. At least being a best-selling author had itsadvantages. People would take notice of the name, if not the contents. Histiming was propitious. France had now been overrun, and as the British forceswere being removed from Dunkirk – 350,000 well-trained men reduced, inWheatley’s phrase, to ‘a rabble, which had to be taken off in its shirts’ – manywere convinced there would be an invasion within two weeks.Wheatley’s genius was to suggest nothing beyond the realms of possibility,defences which would hardly have been out of place in far earlier threats to theBritish Isles. Wheatley envisaged the use of floating flares, fire ships and thespreading of flaming oil across the Channel. If they came ashore, he thenadvocated a low-tech approach. Beaches between Beachy Head and Cromer should becovered by beacons built by civilians to illuminate the landings. Nails andbroken glass embedded in concrete would impede the invaders: so would barbedwire ‘borrowed’ from farmers; fishing nets would foul propellers; rowing boatsshould be filled with explosives; shallow trenches should be gouged out andfilled with oil and smoke bombs. As the enemy came inland, trees should befelled upon tanks, petrol stations would be mined and, in their pumps, watershould be mixed with petrol. To further disorientate the invaders, all road andrail station signs were to be removed, a suggestion which Wheatley believes heoriginated. Writing years later, the removal of place names, he confessed, ‘puta lot of people to a lot of inconvenience and all for no purpose’.The coup de grâce was producing the pamphlets which suggested that hell awaitedthe Wehrmacht. ‘If we can get the enemy scared before the start,’ he wrote toCaptain Stringer, ‘we have already half won the battle.’ Written just two weeksafter Churchill’s elevation to the premiership, his words were an inspiring callto arms. Perhaps the strongest weapons, though, were fellow scribes.Intriguingly, his ‘Resistance to Invasion Paper’ suggested the defensive forcesbe leavened with a deliberate selection of civilian liaison officers who werefellow writers, including Leslie Charteris, Peter Cheyney and Evelyn Waugh.Dennis Wheatley wrote:All of these are brilliant speakers. They are mostly ex-officers of the last warwho would work easily with the military: most of them have names already knownto a large section of the public and many of them are professional writerscapable of drafting concise publicity material or instructions for swift issue.Captain Stringer was impressed.‘Come along any time after eleven o’clock,’ he said, ‘and we’ll talk about yourpaper.’images [images/icon.jpg]The prime minister may have promised to fight on the beaches and in the hills,but there would have been few – let alone sufficient – forces to repel theinvaders. So under the greatest secrecy, Winston Churchill ordered the formationof stay-behind units, with the intention of resisting the expected German attackand harassing the Wehrmacht once it had overrun the Home Counties. While theRoyal Air Force prepared to fight in the air, this hastily created nucleus of asecret underground movement would come under the prime minister’s directcommand. Hiding from the invaders, in a variety of weird and wonderful hideouts,they would be, as one who prepared for the invasion noted, ‘a monument to theingenuity of Peter Fleming’.The Auxiliary Units, as they were known, would become his own finest hour.Based on his work for MI (R), they would use guerrilla tactics to disrupt anyGerman invaders. The units were organised into small, localised groups ofmarauders, who would menace the enemy before disappearing to hide in theshadows: in woods, cellars and fields or whatever subterranean hideouts theycould find. Nobody in the network knew other members and their life expectancywas, at most, a couple of weeks.Once the Germans invaded, the cells would meet in churches and apportion work asspies, assassins, saboteurs and radio operators. They would fill milk churns andsewage pipes with explosives and wire up booby traps in country houses where theGermans might base themselves. At their head would be Captain R.P. Fleminghimself, for whom, as his biographer attests, ‘his own long training as a smallgame hunter in the woods round Nettlebed [the Fleming family home] fitted himparticularly well.’Peter Fleming was the obvious choice to actually establish the resistanceorganisation ahead of an expected German invasion. Kent was expected to be thelikeliest area for a landing and it was here that Fleming established his firstheadquarters in an old timber farmhouse that was christened The Garth. His firsttask was to identify the houses which the Germans would take over and thensurreptitiously mine them or fill milk churns with explosives and fuses. Evenmore remarkably, nobody was ever maimed at this time for this work was carriedout under the greater strictures of security.Another group of Auxiliary Unit saboteurs set an elaborate series of traps atthe far end of Brighton Pier. A seagull inadvertently set one off, which threwup planks of wood that crashed on to other trip wires that set of greaternumbers of explosions.It was a lot quieter over the North Downs, where Fleming and his men developedhideouts in which they would patiently wait for the German invaders. One wasestablished in an engorged badger sett on the edge of a chalk pit 7 miles southof Faversham: another was built in an elongated depression, which had supposedlybeen excavated to allow airships to land in the First World War. Withcharacteristically brilliant thinking, Peter Fleming realised the Germanswouldn’t think that a secret hideout – a collecting point for up to 120 men –would be a hole hidden beneath another hole.Equal ingenuity came in the hiding of another hideout in the gnarled,ivy-covered roots at the base of an ancient tree. Anyone wishing to enter it hadto first find a marble that had been hidden in some nearby leaves. This wouldthen have to be inserted into what appeared to be a mousehole. The marble wouldroll down a pipe about 12ft long and plop into a tin can, a signal to the meninside that they should open the trap door.It was, one colleague who inspected the result noted, pure ‘Boys’ Own Stuff’. Asa result, many different legends have developed about Peter Fleming’s work atthis time. One was that he and the first cells of resistance fighters could killdeer with bows and arrows at a hundred paces. While he did acknowledge that itwas his idea to use bows and arrows, Peter Fleming’s own hunting prowess wasquestionable. Most would have been fired by gamekeepers and foresters whoalready had sufficient experience of game hunting.How successful would they have been? Perhaps in the first stages of an invasion,Fleming suggested, they might have been, but as he reflected long after the war,‘reprisals against the civilian population would have put us out of businessbefore long’.Perhaps the most enduring legacy of his work came from the fact that oneparticular underground hideout had been excavated from out of that old badgersett. It gave Peter Fleming the notion for a story that he never quitecompleted. The fragmentary chapters of this unfinished novel, The Sett, areremarkable only for a character’s name which his brother later appropriated forhis own brand of fiction. For reasons which he could never quite articulate, thename Moneypenny struck a chord in Ian Fleming’s mind.4images [images/icon.jpg]The notion of chemical warfare hung uneasily in the air at the time. Nobody inLondon would put it past Adolf Hitler to break the terms of the GenevaConvention, which specifically banned them. ‘If Germany attempts to invade thiscountry,’ wrote one assessment for the War Office looking at German intentions,‘she will be undertaking the most hazardous operation for which the prize willbe world domination.’ And it was clear, with that in mind, that Adolf Hitlerwould show no hesitation in their use.Newly released files show that intelligence in early 1940 had revealed a newrange of weapons were being considered by the Germans: anthrax, foot and mouth,and sleep and paralysis-inducing agents. There were rumours of ‘fire rain’, madefrom a ‘tarry liquid sprayed from aircraft and ignited by incendiary bombs’.The Luftwaffe, it was feared, could drop over 2,500 tons daily. Yet, Germanyknew that Britain, too, was involved in such weapons of mass destruction. Theprevious October, the War Cabinet had agreed to the secret ramping-up ofproduction of mustard gas and phosgene. ‘Press on,’ the prime minister hadminuted, ‘we must have a great store, as they will certainly use it against uswhen they feel the pinch.’And that was something, no matter how unthinkable, which Dennis Wheatleyacknowledged in a subsequent paper looking at the invasion from a Germanperspective: ‘I advocate the use of poison gas and bacteriological warfare ifour troops can be adequately protected from the latter: but this is a matter forthe chemical section and the final decision in both cases lies with the Führer.’Here was something about which the thriller writer was deadly serious. Whatseemed to impress the powers that be was that he had got into the mind of theNazi invaders. ‘Not until British women lick the boots of German soldiers whileBritish men look on,’ he would write of Teutonic motives, ‘can we be certainthat we have achieved our final objective and that Britain will never menace usagain.’And yet, he also realised that the simplest way to destroy the country was notto destroy it, but to épat les bourgeois. The complete and utter destruction ofthe middle classes would ensure that Britain would be subdued forever. TheGermans, he pointed out, might consider a determined bombing of public schoolsand universities ‘because these contain Britain’s officer class of tomorrow’.images [images/icon.jpg]In an odd act of synchronicity, more or less the same task had been given to becompiled by one particular intelligence officer who regularly went horse ridingthrough the Tiergarten each morning with Admiral Canaris. According to hismemoirs, Walter Schellenberg was asked to write a report to help the invaders:rooting out troublemakers at the end of June 1940. The Sonderfahndungsliste GB(or Special Wanted List) is, by anyone’s standards, an extraordinary piece ofwork.The ‘star’ of the Venlo incident had been given the task of reorganising theCounter Espionage department of SS Intelligence, the Sicherheitsdienst. In thelate spring of 1940, he was, as a matter of routine, given an urgent task towrite a guide to the country the Wehrmacht was shortly expected to take over.Schellenberg was asked to detail some of the foibles of the peoples who wouldsoon come under the command of the Führer. Though he claims he was the soleauthor, it is obvious that many hands came to pull the text together.Informationsheft 1940 is unintentionally hilarious while remaining horriblysinister. Once the Wehrmacht got ashore, the SS administrators in its wakeplanned to single out subversives and arrest them. Most of the report isactually a long compendium which would have been invaluable in this most urgentpolitical task. It was supposed to describe all of Britain’s importantpolitical, administrative and economic institutions and their leading players.In other ways, it is an astonishing piece of work.For example, Schellenberg dismisses the International Boy Scout movement as ‘adisguised instrument of power for British cultural propaganda’ which was partyto ‘important anti-German material which is politically and historicallysignificant’. Perhaps subconsciously echoing Dennis Wheatley’s own classprejudices, the invasion guide went to great lengths to describe the invidiousinfluence of the public schools. They were, it was noted, specifically designedto perpetrate the ‘traditions of the ruling class’.Though less than 1 per cent of all children would attend a public school, itsgraduates would take up roughly 80 per cent of all politically and sociallyimportant posts. ‘It is here that the future English gentleman is educated,’ thereport says, ‘the gentleman who has never thought about philosophical issues,who has hardly any knowledge of foreign culture and who thinks of Germany as theembodiment of evil, but accepts British power as inviolable.’ Eton, it wasnoted, was ‘sold out until 1949’, and government ministers Hankey, Halifax,Eden, Oliver Stanley and Duff Cooper were all old boys.In other respects, Schellenberg’s book was handy.The Informationsheft 1940 alerted the invading forces to the identities and lastknown addresses of all potential troublemakers. When its existence was revealedpublicly in 1945, one couple in particular were amused at their inclusion.Indeed, Rebecca West cabled Noël Coward: ‘My dear, the people we would have beenseen dead with!’ Indeed, other names included socialists and social luminariessuch as H.G. Wells and Nancy Cunard, respectively, as well as politicians likeRichard Crossman, who were expected to create trouble but who, ironically, wouldbecome involved in Britain’s first attempts at anti-German propaganda.It is perhaps significant that one name is notable by its absence: AleisterCrowley.images [images/icon.jpg]After a surfeit of every ritual, perverse sexual practice and mind-addlingstimulants, by the time that war had come, Aleister Crowley was literally spent,in both his impotent rage and declining financial fortune. When Anthony Powellmet him around this time, he encountered a man who was positively jaundiced inappearance, his face looking more like a horrible baby, ‘the skin of poroustexture, much mottled, perhaps from persistent use of drugs’.Abandoned by old friends for his persistent poncing of money, The Beast was bynow a hopeless heroin addict, living in a tiny flat in Jermyn Street. The worldhad passed him by and, though prodigious, his diaries were his greatestoccupation at the time. They are filled with the self-pitying symptoms of decayalong with desperate sexual encounters with prostitutes and bus conductresses.Yet notoriety of a very different complexion had attached itself to him thanksto another guest at one of Dennis and Joan Wheatley’s pre-war parties.William Joyce was an oddball whom several people thought certifiable. Max Knightfor one considered him a crank, a former leading light in the British Union ofFascists, not least because as a later MI5 file shows, he ‘could never comewithin reach of a pencil and paper without drawing a coronated devil’s head’. Bynow transplanted to the Third Reich, William Joyce would become infamous as LordHaw Haw, whose crowing propaganda broadcasts were cherished for their comicvalue. Yet some time that summer of 1940, he name-checked somebody who couldhelp reverse the terrible British losses. Lord Haw Haw suggested over theairwaves that Aleister Crowley should be invited to celebrate black mass inWestminster Cathedral.Small wonder that some believe the defenders took guidance from thesupernatural. Witches, it has been suggested without any confirmatory evidence,were employed so that their magic skills could be cast to prevent an invasion aswell as psychically neutralising the Nazi menace. Over the years, Lord Haw Haw’sfacetious suggestion has transformed into the ‘fact’ that he took part in ablack mass ceremony in Ashdown Forest for much the same purpose (this, as wewill see in a later chapter, seems to have been a more recent invention andgiven the name Operation Mistletoe).Intriguingly, early on the morning of 2 June 1940, two RAF fighters werescrambled to chase a German aircraft which jettisoned a pair of bombs. Severalhouses close by the forest received slight damage. ‘Tattered frocks from onebedroom were strewn across the lawn,’ according to one account. In another,garage doors were blown out and boys at a nearby prep school were unharmed,while a lone aircraft was caught in searchlights. ‘We heard the drone of a planejust before and soon after the explosions,’ noted one resident.In the fevered spirit of the time, that too – like the notion of AleisterCrowley or witches being employed to ward off the Germans – is more likely tohave been wishful thinking.images [images/icon.jpg]Though the glorious weather continued well into August, the skies over SouthernEngland that long hot summer of 1940 occasionally darkened thanks to anotherform of aerial bombardment. No greater measure of the desperation felt by theBritish authorities came than in the deployment of unsung heroes of a distinctlyfeathered variety. Strange as it seems to posterity, MI5 set up its owndedicated section to monitor the movements of carrier pigeons as part of theexpected onslaught from the Hun.There should be no surprise in the use of the genus pipio, for pigeons havealways been used in wars for sending messages. In the First World War, theGermans prevented Belgians from breeding them in case spies used them totransmit secret messages. Before the start of the Second World War, the Abwehrrealised that the birds could be vital in the transmission of secretinformation, ‘particularly in the wilder countries where communications weredifficult’. Pigeon sections were routinely attached to its intelligence units inthe field.The SS, too, had its sights on the birds.Himmler’s men had commandeered all privately owned pigeons in Germany andintended to use them for the prosecution of war. Perhaps this explains why MI5had also compiled files on ‘German pigeon personnel’ (probably capturedWehrmacht signallers). It was also noted that the Reichsführer-SS himself had‘been a pigeon fancier and enthusiast all his life, [and] is the head orPresident of the German National Pigeon Society’.To stop this expected onslaught, a Falcon Interceptor Unit was set up withinMI5, with two falconers (Viscount Tredegar and Wing Commander Walker) andtrained falcons. One hitherto secret report remarks: ‘Whilst they never broughtdown an enemy bird – probably because there never were any – they diddemonstrate that they could bring down any pigeon that cased the area they werepatrolling.’ Something approaching panic occurred when two pigeons of ‘unknownorigin’ were found amongst the MI5 coops that summer. ‘Both birds are nowprisoners of war,’ a report remarks with a perfectly straight face, ‘workinghard at breeding English pigeons.’images [images/icon.jpg]If there was one man who was born to talk to pigeons, it was Evan Morgan, theSecond Viscount Tredegar, around whom so many more mysteries swell thanks to hisoccasional friendship with Aleister Crowley. With the outbreak of war, theviscount was put in charge of a Home Guard unit and then joined the Royal Corpsof Signals, where his skills were put to obvious use: training pigeons to carrysecret messages. As a result, he was the most exotic employee for MI8, one ofthe secret departments within the War Office.Perhaps it was inevitable that he would end up doing a different form of ‘bird’.Viscount Tredegar actually spent time in the Tower for an indiscretion that healways claimed came about thanks to Lady Baden-Powell. In many accounts, it isstated that he was arrested after talking about his work to Lady Baden-Powellover lunch and was overheard.Ironically, he actually found himself behind bars thanks to an indiscretion –thankfully, an innocent one by today’s standards – to a group of Girl Guides. Acouple of years later, Evan Morgan was giving a group of Guides a tour of hisoffice when he showed them various items from his safe which he shouldn’t havedone. Only Evan Morgan would get caught talking too freely, hardly helped byhaving a gigantic map of Europe (Bomber Command-style) with pins which indicatedwhere pigeons were being dropped, which also, in another account, revealed wherethe Dieppe landing was being planned.There is also a suggestion that he revealed far too much about his war-workduring a talk he gave at a hotel in London. And for reasons which remainunclear, Lady Baden Powell was indeed something of an enemy to Evan Morgan.After the Girl Guides incident, she pressed, most strongly, for a fullcourt-martial. She succeeded in this attempt. Quite how Tredegar managed toescape serious punishment is still something of a mystery (he was found guiltyof two of the three charges against him but he was severely reprimanded andothers in the establishment intervened on his behalf).It was agreed it might be best if he retire to his country seat. There hereturned for the rest of the war, never to work on military matters again, anddied in the late 1940s, though not before one final mystery involving his oldfriend Aleister Crowley.images [images/icon.jpg]Despite Evan Morgan’s often bizarre activities, active measures involvingpigeons were also being developed to fool the Germans. So, for example, pigeonswere released across the Channel with fake identities to confuse the enemy byfilling the skies with bird of unknown origin. Pigeon fanciers were asked tosend birds at staggered times of the day to ‘decoy’ tired birds into followingthem back to British lofts. Abwehr-bred pigeons in Belgium and Holland weretargeted by ‘contaminating their lofts’.False rings written in German were attached to batches of phoney birds, droppedfrom aircraft. One MI5 report concludes:Far from home they would find their way – as homing pigeons always do – to someloft, and as all lofts were enemy-controlled it would be a German loft. Therethey would be taken in as one of their own pigeons, and if used for messagecarrying, would, of course, go astray. Sooner or later the Germans woulddiscover they had been fooled and they then would have to call in all theirpigeons to check which were the imposters.5However, the first attempt at dropping dummy pigeons out of an RAF plane failedwhen they were sucked into the slipstream and de-feathered. Later in the war, itwas also decided that pigeons should be sent to occupied countries for use inreporting the military situation. Dead pigeons were also dropped with theanswers to questions already scrawled on their tags. That way, the Germansecurity forces would think the famous British Secret Service remained active inthe Fatherland. Famously, one tired pigeon returned home to an MI5 loft with apolite message attached. ‘I had the sister of this one for supper. Delicious!Please send us some more.’Under the direct supervision of the Joint Intelligence Committee, the carrierpigeon sub-committee continued to meet for five years after the war. A strangeplan was then developed as the Cold War started. Fitted with lethal bacteria orexplosives, it was suggested the pigeons could ‘home’ in on enemy targets.Though these ideas were taken seriously by Sir Stewart Menzies, there wereinternal disagreements which meant the plans were ‘continuously forced to swimin a sea of pigeon politics’.images [images/icon.jpg]The fate of the invasion would ultimately rest with some stool pigeons who were,thanks to Abwehr incompetence, more like sitting ducks. Though it had seemed tomany of its opposite number that German Military Intelligence was ‘a first classorganisation’, over the spring and summer of 1940 it appeared as though it wasemploying some sort of secret gag writer to plan its operations. Battalions ofspies would be needed to prepare for the invasion of Britain. Acting aspathfinders, they would warn the Wehrmacht about the lie of the land in theGarden of England, helping guide the forces through the quiet (but nowsignpost-less) country lanes and picturesque villages up towards London andbeyond.‘Where on Earth are we going to get hold of that many of would-be suicides?’Admiral Canaris is known to have remarked as the plans developed.For that he turned to a man with the prominent gold tooth, a friendly,full-faced countenance and a patter that seemed to have seeped in from aB-movie. Major Nikolaus Adolf Fritz Ritter had spent much time in the States andhad supposedly escaped from one tight spot in the Great War by stealing abiplane. Though clearly a fantasist, Ritter’s rise had been bestowed with theavuncular blessing of ‘Father Christmas’ himself.‘I got a note from Canaris telling me that I was one of his best officers,’Ritter later told one interviewer. ‘All he could say was that I was better thanexcellent.’Based in the Abwehr’s large Hamburg outstation which directed operations againstBritain (and later the United States), Major Ritter later maintained that hecould never fathom out anything about der Chef whenever they socialisedtogether. ‘Unlike most Germans who tell you their life story within five minutesof meeting them, the admiral was always closed,’ Ritter would write. ‘We nevergot anything out of him.’Ritter always maintained that he hated both the backbiting atmosphere and officepolitics within the Abwehr. Now, in the summer of 1940, an air of fatalismpermeated the Hamburg offices with regard to its plans for supporting OperationSea Lion, the planned invasion of the British Isles. Vast scepticism accompaniedRitter’s plans, with one mission, in particular, termed ‘Himmelfahrt’, a journeyto heaven, as in wishful thinking.With the occupation of Europe, there were plentiful supplies of potential agentswho could pose as refugees, but they were all recruited too late and withoutsufficient screening for suitability. They had either been blackmailed orattracted to espionage by greed, thrills and a sense of misplaced patriotism.What would be known to the Abwehr as ‘Operation Lena’ and, more prosaically, tothe British as ‘The Brussels Four’6 seemed to have drifted in from cloud cuckooland.They were a ragtag bunch, in MI5’s later estimation, which led to an episodethat was – with typical British understatement – ‘rather falsely alarming in itslocal magnitude’. The only thing they seemed to have in common was a staggeringlack of ability to make themselves inconspicuous. One spoke no English at all,the others, fleetingly; including one, Sjoert Pons, whose supposed superiorityas an English speaker may be gauged from how he described his mission: ‘How thepeople is living, how many soldiers there are, and all the things.’At the start of September, each of them had been led to believe the invasion wascoming very soon. When the Wehrmacht followed, they were instructed to signal byhandkerchief any approaching forces. ‘Ich bin hier mit einem Sonderauftrag derdeutschen Wehrmacht,’ (‘I’m here on a special mission for [on behalf of] theGerman armed forces’) they would say, followed by the password ‘Elizabeth’.Their dispatch from France, in keeping with the conventions of a childhoodadventure, could best be called Four Men in Two Boats. In the still of thepre-dawn darkness of the first Monday in September, they came across the Channelin fishing boats on a perfectly dark, moonless night. At daybreak, one of them,Carl Meier, made his way towards the nearby village of Lydd. As he was thirsty,he walked into a pub (literally so, for as he later told MI5, ‘I stepped intothe room and hit my head on the lamp.’) He drew attention to himself straightaway in demanding cigarettes and cider. It was just after 9 a.m. and the barwould not serve alcohol for at least another hour.The landlady – ‘Mrs Cow’, he recalled – was suspicious.‘I went out and walked round the town,’ Meier recalled. At some point, he gotinto conversation with an Air Raid Warden and, as the official MI5 report on hisactivities notes, ‘somewhat ingenuously over-zealous, he soon began to makeenquiries as to the disposition and number of British troops in the case.’ Whenthe Dutchman admitted he had no identity card, he was arrested and taken to anearby police station. After three hours of prevarication, he finally revealedwhere his friend Waldberg was hiding.The remaining spies – Dutch Army buddies Pons and Van der Kieboom – had landed afew miles away down the coast. Within an hour, they too had been questioned atSeabrook Police Station.Though the mission of the Brussels Four may have been over before it had evenstarted, it did prompt an atmosphere of feverish speculation. The Saturday afterthey had been apprehended in the Kent marshes, the codeword ‘Cromwell’ wasdispatched to all units of the Home Guard, meaning an invasion was imminent.7The Joint Intelligence Committee assessment which prompted it was ‘a significantitem of intelligence’ – most likely the confessions of the Brussels Four.Certainly, much mystery surrounds the role of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris at thistime. Did the Abwehr chief actually go so far as to leak material to the Britishgovernment? After the war, when the diplomat Michael Soltikow asked WinstonChurchill about how he had been so well informed about the German plans, hepointed to Ian Colvin’s post-war biography of Canaris. Another intriguingvignette of Wilhelm Canaris’s duplicity survives from this time. A youngLuftwaffe pilot happened to say in the admiral’s hearing that the Royal AirForce would crumple within six weeks. Somehow managing to keep a straight face,Admiral Canaris said: ‘The Führer is said to give them only fifteen days and theFührer is always right.’images [images/icon.jpg]The Abwehr eventually abandoned sea landings and concentrated on dropping theiragents in by parachute. Two nights after the Brussels Four came ashore, theagent codenamed Summer by the British fell from the skies over theNorthamptonshire countryside. He was the itinerant son of a Swedish parson whohad married a German girl, had crossed the Canadian Rockies by foot and hisfirst job, running a silver fox farm in Uppsala, had ended in disaster.So too did Gösta Caroli’s mission to Britain.During his descent in the middle of the night, Caroli had been dragged forwardby his extremely heavy radio equipment, then the strap snapped and he somehowmanaged to knock himself out. When he later awoke in complete darkness, Caroliwas able to cut himself free from the radio but was rather badly concussed. Hewas later found in a shed by a farmer’s boy and was arrested. A few days later,he was driven down to London and taken to MI5’s dedicated interrogation centreat a former lunatic asylum in Richmond.It was clear he was distinctly ambivalent about how and where the Wehrmachtwould come ashore.‘You haven’t much faith in this so-called invasion of England?’ he was asked.‘No.’The Germans would land, so Caroli had been led to believe, in about afortnight’s time once the RAF was destroyed (estimated to take place on 15September).‘I was told [to] come first to the South Coast and find out about thefortifications on the South Coast,’ Caroli added. But perhaps the oddest detailwas something which he had picked up from the Germans he had dealt with,justifying the sense of disbelief that had prompted the dispatch of theiragents.‘It is impossible, of course, but I have heard about a pontoon bridge over theChannel … ’‘A pontoon bridge over the Straits!’For just about the only time in his wartime secret service, the hard-chargingMI5 interrogator – famously termed ‘a devil in a monocle’ – was rendered, albeittemporarily, speechless.8images [images/icon.jpg]With the onset of the autumn storms, it was clear that Britain would, for themoment, survive. The Brussels Four and Gösta Caroli were not alone. They werethe first of a total of fourteen enemy agents who attempted to land in Britainover the next three months of 1940. All were apprehended in a matter of hours.Ten came by sea and four were parachuted; nine surrendered to the authoritiesstraightaway; twelve were interned, one committed suicide and three wouldeventually be turned against their German masters.At this stage, the prevailing wisdom was that anyone found to be an enemy agentwould have to be executed to make sure others would not be encouraged. And sowith a wearying sense of inevitability, the Brussels Four were brought to trialat the Old Bailey at the end of November 1940. Even though she was aspiritualist, Carl Meier’s mother would have been hard-pressed to predict thecontents of a letter her son had written in Pentonville Prison hours before hemet his end.‘I know that it will be a shock for you to hear that I have passed away when youreceive this letter,’ he wrote. ‘I certainly believe that you will understandthat it is better for me to die for my ideals.’images [images/icon.jpg]At this stage of the fighting, what was later known as political warfare did notexist as a concrete concept. Though the notion of fighting war without weaponswas an old one, in the first few months of its existence attempts by the new kidon the block, the Special Operations Executive, to create and execute propagandawere equally flawed. For some, the SOE’s creation and the dispatch of itsplanning personnel to a variety of old mansions in the Home Counties led to itsdisparagement as the Stately ’Omes of England.To many, they remained the disparate bunch of hopeless and helpless time-serverswho were incompetent, and that included the former head of subversion who wasfinally sent into the wilderness. That September, Hugh Dalton sacked LawrenceGrand (whom he termed King Bomba, after the quixotic Sicilian King Ferdinand)who returned to the army, but not without kicking up a fuss. Dalton didn’t carewhere he went so long as it was ‘some distance off’ (preferably Hong Kong orIreland), but was beside himself with rage when he heard that Grand wanted aposition in the War Cabinet secretariat.By now, it was clear that something more dynamic than broadcasting and leafletdropping was needed to turn the Deutsches Volk against their masters. What wasreally needed was a catalyst, and that would come in the corpulent form ofsomeone who knew Germany, and indeed had walked through the smouldering remainsof the Reichstag with the newly elected Führer himself, to take mendacious andmisleading half-truths and lies into a new realm.Denis Sefton Delmer.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 As regards potential personnel, Peter Fleming suggested recruiting Britonswho were already in situ, including the Keswick brothers of Jardines, hisbrother Richard (‘The best potential leader of irregular troops I know’), andintriguingly, Roger Hollis, a later director of the Security Security (whomFleming noted as follows: ‘MI5: married: circa 34’). Hollis’s work around thistime has been the cause of much speculation, not least for the suspicions thathe was recruited as a Soviet mole and his later starring role in the Spycatcheraffair. Peter Fleming’s pen portrait at the time notes: ‘Did several years inChina with BAT. Though he has not been there recently, his judgment of FarEastern affairs has always impressed me as unusually realistic. His cooperation,or even his comments, might be valuable at an early stage.’2 A very interesting discussion of the events of 10 May 1940 may be found inthe What If? series of books. Andrew Roberts’s essay – ‘Prime Minister Halifax,Great Britain makes peace with Germany, 1940’ – is Chapter 16 of More What If?Eminent Historians Imagine What Might Have Been (Pan, 2003).3 Many of the stories about MI6 around this time have been distilled throughthe recollections of Desmond Morton, a special adviser to the prime minister andlong-time crony, who had been an MI6 officer for many years. This is covered inChapter 11 of Gill Bennett’s superb biography, Churchill’s Man of Mystery:Desmond Morton and the World of Intelligence (Routledge, 2007). What GillBennett aptly termed the ‘Morton Myth’ – that he knew far more than he ever saidor did – has become pervasive, not least with his delivery each day of thedecrypted Enigma material from C to the PM, which Ms Bennett calls MI6’s trumpcard, ‘the goose that laid the golden eggs as Churchill would have it’. Itallowed C to be ‘like a rather elegant and effective spider commanding everypoint of growth’. Her research has shown that the chief of MI6 ‘was far moredynamic and successful, in professional terms, than has often been thought’, aview reinforced by the recent MI6 authorised history which states that thewartime success of the service did not solely depend on signals intelligence.4 It is largely due to the pen of Peter Fleming that we know what might havehappened had the invasion come ashore. Given his work on the resistancenetworks, he was well placed to write a book about Nazi plans for the conquestof England which appeared in 1958 as Invasion 1940!, a spirited and lively bookwhich became a bestseller. It was helped by the fact that various documents werefound in German archives after the war, including the Gestapo handbook which wasusually ascribed to Walter Schellenberg.5 Ireland, too, would be alert to feathered friends. As late as May 1944, ameeting in Dublin revealed that ‘The Eire authorities had already been warned ofthe possible parachuting of pigeons and special instructions have been issuedfor the reporting of stray pigeons.’6 The Brussels Four were so named as they had been trained in the Belgiancapital. Three were of Dutch origins, as shown in their official MI5 files. CarlMeier (KV2/12) had been born in Germany and worked in The Hague. The most exoticwas Charles van der Kieboom (KV2/11), a Eurasian Dutchman who had been a hotelreceptionist in Amsterdam; his friend, Sjoerd Pons (KV2/13) was an innocentnaïf, who had driven ambulances for the Dutch Army during national service. Ponsand van der Kieboom were army buddies. The last recruit, Jose Waldberg(KV2/107), was Alsatian, bilingual in French and German. He had never had a jobuntil he joined the Abwehr. He had already distinguished himself in the invasionof France and Belgium as a fifth columnist, providing information on localarrays of troops.7 Ironically, that same first Saturday of September, salvation came from anunlikely source. In retaliation, for a raid on Berlin, the Luftwaffe’s attentionturned to the capital and the first night-time raid. The Blitzkrieg on Londonbegan. Within hours, Surrey Docks became a vast conflagration of fire. ‘Send allthe pumps you’ve got,’ one fire officer was heard to say (p. 256, Deighton,Battle of Britain), ‘the whole bloody world’s on fire.’8 This entertaining dialogue came from the most frightening part of thetreatment of suspected spies. This was the interrogation by the steely martinetwho was the camp ‘commandant’, Captain Robin Stephens. Known as Tin Eye becauseof his monocle (which he was rumoured to wear in bed), he loathed all foreignersand yet loved his job. A splendid biographical portrait may be found in OliverHoare’s introduction to the book which he edited, Camp 020: MI5 and the NaziSpies (PRO, Secret History Files)."},{"pageContent":"7DARKNESS AND LIGHT [contents.htm#a10]A report has reached us today from a Swiss informant who has for many years hadclose connections with the English Secret Service to the effect it is the planof the English Secret Service, by sending the Duke to the Bahamas to get himinto English power in order to do away with him at the first opportunity.July 1940 telegram to SS Intelligence from LisbonSince the collapse of France, Lisbon has been the principal and at times theonly place through which the Germans could pass agents through this country orwhere they could meet them on their return.‘The German Espionage Organisation in Lisbon’,summary from the summer of 1941 (KV 3/170 52B)Waiting and watching.That’s all anybody could really do and now, scanning the French coast throughthe early morning autumn mists,1 a large, untidy figure was looking fortell-tale signs that the invading forces were ready to embark. It was a measureof some later pride to Tom Delmer that his name had already been added to the SSWanted List. As soon as the Wehrmacht came ashore, he would be instantlyarrested. Not that he knew it at the time, but the former Berlin correspondenthad made high-powered enemies in Nazi Germany.By the second week of September, it was make or break for the enemy across theChannel. The day before, ferocious air battles had climaxed with the mostprolonged and fierce day of fighting – now commemorated as Battle of Britain Day– over southern England. And now, at 8 a.m. on Monday, 16 September 1940, TomDelmer was watching and, as he reported the next day, fifty aircraft were metwith a ‘barrage of fire as I have never seen anywhere before’.It was, he thought, akin to a wall of fire as the sky filled with shrapnel.‘The explosion of shells was one continuous roar,’ Delmer reported in the nextday’s Daily Express. The enemy bombers were forced to turn back as they came inunder the clouds. Further bad weather but no more aircraft rolled in that sameMonday. By early evening, when Delmer had filed his story, there would be nofurther onslaughts thanks to ‘what sailors call dirty weather over the straitsof Dover tonight’.Trying to lift ‘the veil of the unknown’, as Winston Churchill referred to theChannel, would hardly be easy. And yet, trying to not just discern what theenemy was doing, but somehow influence its people would be something to whichTom Delmer knew he could make an important contribution. Ironically, floatingabove him in the early evening mists was a large blimp that had been shot downand then patched up after an attack on the port of Dover. The RAF soonchristened the unfortunate dirigible Sefton, after the man himself. It wasjoined by a pair of large guns named Winnie and Pooh, a pointless politicalgesture by a prime minister, for they would hardly be sufficient to repel anattack.Now, as he scanned the Pas-de-Calais, Tom Delmer knew there was a certain ironythat the politician named for the gun was never particularly impressed byofficial misinformation. With Winston Churchill’s general lack of interest inpropaganda, similar bemusement had accompanied its development to date. Oneparliamentary undersecretary was genuinely perplexed by the academic abstractionand almost tortured intellectuals who had been employed in the Ministry ofInformation.Many writers simply stayed clear. Dennis Wheatley had been one of them.‘Don’t take it too badly that the Ministry of Information had ignored your offerof service,’ one MI5 officer told him, referring to the fact the set-up was ahopeless mess. ‘It would break your heart to be mixed up with such a crew’. Whatthe successful prosecution of propaganda and psychological warfare needed,another participant later wrote, were people ‘caddish and ignorant enough totell dynamic lies.’The efforts to date were too decent and honourable. What was needed were peoplewho were neither. ‘We need crooks,’ was his simple request.images [images/icon.jpg]Earlier that same fateful summer of 1940, Adolf Hitler had, publicly at least,acted magnanimously towards the British people. The German leader raised theissue of ending the fighting with Churchill’s government in the most dramaticterms. On Friday, 19 July, he had stood at a lectern at the Kroll Opera Housewearing his simple uniform and the Iron Cross he had won in the Great War atYpres. Appealing to reason and British common sense, the Führer offered an olivebranch towards the king’s subjects.‘I consider myself in a position to make this appeal since I am not thevanquished begging favours, but the victor speaking in the name of reason,’ hesaid. ‘I can see no reason why this war must go on.’Within an hour, Tom Delmer had taken to the airwaves on the BBC German Service.His was a fiery riposte which had begun: ‘We hurl it right back at you, right inyour evil-smelling teeth.’ The golden pheasants were so shocked at his vehemencethat his name was swiftly added to the SS Wanted List. So, too, were somemembers of parliament, led by the Labour politician Richard Stokes, who wantedto know why ‘a person of no importance’ had been allowed to answer the Führer’soffer.The relevant minister replied that the right to grumble was part of thedemocratic process. ‘We are fighting to preserve our liberties,’ he loftilydeclared. ‘If you call that fighting for nothing or fighting for somethingnegative, I do not.’Indeed, it was largely due to Tom Delmer’s efforts, and his alone, thatpolitical warfare would be miraculously transformed as a viable weapon ofwarfare. Yet for him personally, the line between truth and misinformationremained precarious. Another government minister advised him to carry on workingas a reporter but carry out the occasional broadcast on the BBC German service.One thing which nobody could stem that autumn were the incessant rumours thatthe invasion would come any day. To combat them, Tom Delmer started to promotehis own: that the British Government had imported 200 man-eating sharks fromAustralia. They had, he would claim, been released into the English Channel toeat even the most unappetising of invading Wehrmacht troops.On another occasion, he travelled with a convoy through the Channel, when hegave a language lesson for potential invaders on the BBC German Service. Here,verbatim, is a transcript, done in the style of an enthusiastic languageinstructor:For your first lesson we will take:‘Die Kanalüberfahrt … the chan-nel cross-ing … das boot sinkt … the boat issin-king … the boat is sin-king.’And then, after repeating this, Delmer added a verb declination which would comein useful:‘Ich brenne … I burn.‘Du brennst … you burn.’He ended with:‘Der SS Sturmführer brennt auch ganz schön.’‘The SS Captain is also burning quite nicely.’Yet it would hardly be a vintage time for Tom Delmer.As the autumn of 1940 progressed, his was a time of uncertainty, boredom andwaiting to find a niche somewhere in the secret world. Too old for regularemployment (then in his mid-30s) and most likely too heavy (17 stone), TomDelmer kicked his heels, often frustrated at the bureaucratic delays heencountered. At first he seems to have been rejected by MI5 and was lateremployed, peripherally at least, by MI6 on a strange mission that for all itsfiascos, would lead him directly into the propaganda war.images [images/icon.jpg]For all the fears of invasion, there is much evidence to suggest Adolf Hitlerwanted to neutralise Britain without a fight. Certainly, the Führer hoped thathe could broker peace and, in any case, had made it clear that unless theWehrmacht’s invasion strategy had come together by the start of September,‘other plans’ would intercede – namely, the invasion of the Soviet Union andwhat he termed ‘the final showdown with bolshevism’.In this regard, a destroyed Britain would only really benefit the United Statesand Japan with the dissolution of the far reaches of empire. ‘He thought Britainwould be mad or stupid not to ask for some kind of compromise peace,’ RomanianAmbassador Virgil Tilea later correctly diagnosed in a newspaper article.Yet the Nazis remained fearful of the British Empire and were envious of bothits prestige and resources. The golden pheasants were also fascinated by theCrown and, in particular, the limited powers which the monarch exercised overthe Houses of Parliament. They could never completely understand its honourablemembers’ constant vigilance for any kingly incursions on the due processes ofdemocracy. Indeed, many high-up Nazis speculated that this might have been thereal cause of Edward VIII’s abdication. Now, four years later, the Nazisdesperately wanted to contact this same member of the Establishment, a curious,self-centred man for whom fate and a certain ignominious hubris had seen himabandon the crown for the love of a woman.To understand how the Third Reich wanted to make contact with the Duke ofWindsor involves another theme which will come to engage this narrative: AdolfHitler’s innate ability in making sure his fingerprints were nowhere to be foundanywhere near any controversial actions which might backfire. This stemmed notjust from the Führerprinzip, the fundamental underpinning of the Third Reichthat his word was above all written law. Most famously, Adolf Hitler never puthis signature to any written instructions for the Final Solution. Nor had hisname ever been associated with an earlier peace effort about which he is knownto have approved. Ultimately, Hermann Göring’s approach in the late summer of1939 to the Chamberlain government via his Swedish businessman friend, BirgerDahlerus, to try to stop the outbreak of hostilities had failed.And now he would do the same in behind-the-scenes brokering of peace with theBritish. Publicly, the Führer was generous and magnanimous, as in the KrollOpera House speech, which had prompted Tom Delmer’s vitriol. After all, as hesomewhat ridiculously claimed, his own generosity had extended to allowing Vichyto govern half of the conquered French nation. But behind the scenes that summerof 1940, he called in his keeper of the faith, Rudolf Hess, who would now betasked with looking at the issue of finding peace in broader terms.There were, Adolf Hitler told his deputy, a group of British aristocrats whowere keen to circumvent the belligerent Churchill. The king would listen, Hitlerclaimed. ‘What do I have to do?’ the Führer had asked in exasperation at onepoint. ‘Do I have to go over there myself and talk to them?’Those very words have been a wellspring of much peculiar speculation.Already, one of the Führer’s intelligence services was working on a backup, aconvoluted tale that would prompt two of the more farcical operations of thesecret war, both linked to the possibility of exploring peace. The firstinvolved the recent escape of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to Iberia, wherethey were believed to be under the gimlet gaze of one of the golden pheasants’favourite bogeyman.‘The crux of the matter is that since his abdication, the Duke has been underthe strict surveillance of the British secret service,’ one German diplomaticreport noted that summer of 1940. ‘We know what his feelings are, it’s almost asif he were their prisoner.’ An American diplomat had also chimed in: the dukeand duchess were indiscreet and outspoken against the British government.And out of this notion came a plan to kidnap His Majesty’s wayward brother toleverage peace with the British Government. What followed was another bizarreenterprise with unforeseen consequences, not least for the author of theInformationsheft 1940 report with whom it would be inextricably linked. WalterSchellenberg’s attempts to kidnap the former Edward VIII read more like a crossbetween The Prisoner of Zenda and a Whitehall farce, in which, as noted onehistorian, ‘nothing was too fantastic to happen’.images [images/icon.jpg]Tom Delmer’s blackly humorous broadcasts aside, these first few months of whatcame to be known as political warfare had also been farcical. The whole approachto propaganda had been characterised by false starts, petty mindedness,vindictiveness, amateurishness and stupidity. It was not simply a case of tryingto find the right approach to political warfare, but developing any sort ofapproach at all. Though the formation of the Special Operations Executive hadbeen intended to galvanise unconventional forms of warfare, it had had quite theopposite effect so far as propaganda was concerned. Various bailiwick disputesand political infighting were the immediate result.Threaded throughout this story are the political ambitions of a generation ofpublic-school educated socialists who could not happen upon a ribcage withoutwanting to stick a knife in. Dr Hugh Dalton’s first act on taking over the SOEwas to split propaganda from sabotage. As his firing of ‘Grand Bomba’ had shown,Dalton could be Machiavellian and difficult, and was, in one recollection, ‘agreat booming bully; and even at breakfast time, his manner was horriblyhearty’.Although impressed by ‘black’ propaganda, Dalton spent the first few months ofhis tenure fighting with Duff Cooper (nominally the Minister for Information anda crony of the prime minister) as to who should take the lead in prosecutingpropaganda. A singular question remained: was its distribution overt or covert?If the latter, it would come under the SOE which, because of its very secrecy,meant that no questions could be asked in parliament. Fairly quickly, the firstbattleground concerned printed material: ‘an impudent attempt by the Ministry ofInformation to steal leaflets from me,’ Dalton recorded in his diary thatNovember. Around the same time, when Tom Delmer arrived in Lisbon, there was solittle activity going on that he met a Belgian émigré who asked a question thathe himself would soon ponder.‘Why don’t the RAF drop more propaganda leaflets?’ he moaned. ‘We want all wecan get.’images [images/icon.jpg]Cooper’s snoopers, as the information ministry was invariably known, worked forone of the most unpopular departments of state. ‘It would take hours to describethe perfection in which this piece of chaos has been organised,’ noted onepolitician. To be fair, the Ministry of Information’s purpose was positivelyschizophrenic: as well as disseminating information from all governmentdepartments, it was responsible for censorship. It employed, by repute, 999civil servants who all had one overarching aim – to argue and infight, not justwith rivals but with themselves too. ‘The presence of so many able,undisciplined men in one Ministry was bound to lead to a great deal of internalfriction,’ Cooper himself noted years later. Having taken over the capital’sfirst skyscraper, the Ministry of Information was rapidly expanding in ways thatcaused much puzzlement for the people who worked there. Senate House just offRussell Square would act as a curious magnet for writers, iconoclasts andmalcontents who would come to deride their own work. George Orwell wouldfamously base his Ministry of Truth in 1984 on the situation he encounteredthere (a particular library office may well have been the inspiration for Room101).2Graham Greene became, much to his own astonishment, head of the writers’ sectionbased in a Senate House, which he termed ‘a high heartless building withcomplicated lifts’. Supposedly there to ‘commission and stimulate the writing ofbooks and pamphlets’, Greene was soon bored by the pointlessness of it all. Hesatirised the general atmosphere in his short story Men At Work, which he wrotethat same hot summer. It tells the story of Richard Skate, an official in aMinistry of Information who spends all his time drowning in paperwork. Everyeffort was superseded by events and the building was full of self-important,pompous idiots.‘Propaganda was a means of passing the time: work was not done for itsusefulness but for its own sake – simply as an occupation,’ he wrote.Scathingly, Greene felt the accumulating staff were akin to a kind of fungoidlife, growing and self-replicating to no apparent purpose. ‘To send a minute toanybody else in the great building and to receive a reply took at leasttwenty-four hours,’ Greene noted, ‘on an urgent matter an exchange of threeminutes might be got through in a week.’Greene lasted six months, before finding more gainful employment. ‘I loved theBlitz,’ he later said after becoming an ARP warden. ‘It was wonderful to wake upand know you were still alive and hear glass being swept up in the streets.’Thanks to his sister, Elizabeth, who was already working within MI6, GrahamGreene was recruited into the secret world. He was later dispatched to SierraLeone, where he became known as Officer 59200, based in Freetown. Despite hisown later claims of unsuitability – most famously with the comedic possibilitiesof having to arrange for a blowtorch-wielding technician to open his safe afterhe had locked its code and codebooks inside – his job was to keep an eye onships docking from the neighbouring countries of Vichy France.His later dismissive attitude to the secret world came from various othercomedies of errors which provided the germs of plot devices and ideas for hisown books. Perhaps the most famous concerned his trying to recruit a brothelmadam who, as he reported, had ‘earned her living on her back for a good manyyears’. Greene suggested running her brothel with government backing. But aftercareful consideration in Broadway Buildings, he was informed there was a greaterworry that she might employ whores who were already in the employ of VichyFrance (as, by repute, the best-looking ones from neighbouring countries were).images [images/icon.jpg]It always started with a phone call to the top floor of the Madrid Embassy.A bright female voice announced ‘El tío está aquí’ (‘Uncle is here’) and withinminutes the message would pass down to the head of the Abwehr station in thelarge building on Calle Castellana. It needed no further elaboration. AdmiralWilhelm Canaris would be expected shortly after having flown into the Spanishcapital using one of his many aliases.3 The admiral would find any excuse tovisit the country to which he was sentimentally attached, where he hadestablished a vast network of watchers in the Great War. Most recently, he hadcreated an espionage organisation to specifically help Francisco Franco duringthe Spanish Civil War. It was significant, therefore, that a signed photographof Il Caudillo hung on his office wall in the Fuchsbau. Canaris had made himselfindispensable to Franco, so much so that the Abwehr was far more pervasive thaneven the Spanish secret police, the DGS (Direccion General de Seguridad).Spain, then, represented a release valve.With increasing frequency, Wilhelm Canaris returned to the peninsula torejuvenate his often flagging spirits, finding a ‘constant exhilaration’ in onerecent account. The admiral had a marked empathy with his Spanish hosts. Withthe appointment of a manservant named Mohammed and the ferrying of militaryaircraft to Spain to fetch fresh strawberries, he certainly enjoyed thedistractions of a sybaritic lifestyle.Significantly, his station chief in Madrid was a former naval officer, WilhelmLeissner, who in some accounts has been called the admiral’s ‘alter ego’, thoughwidely seen as pedantic and over formal. But Canaris needed someone he couldtrust as the Spanish capital was an important centre for the Abwehr. Its Madridstation would become one of its most heavily manned. Roughly half the embassystaff were genuine diplomats and support staff, and eventually expanded to takeover the uppermost floor and the basement.4A similar encroachment occurred throughout the country, where nearly fiftyAbwehr outstations covered the country like a spider’s web of interconnections.Yet all seemed to act independently and without reference to Madrid. ‘Theycorresponded with Berlin, described what they were doing and sent in theiragents’s reports,’ one MI6 hand later noted. In other words, chaos was set infrom the beginning, something which would have a significant impact on thesecret war.This vast trawl of information was forwarded to the Fuchsbau with little regardfor filtering. The intelligence trawl from Spain was invariably contradictory ordefied common sense, a situation which became more acute as the war went on.Partly it was because he who made the more astonishing claim was likely to bebelieved, but also because of bureaucratic incompetence. Names were routinelymisfiled or lost altogether. Not only did staff within the central registry haveno language training, but as a post-war interrogation of one Abwehr officer whoregularly visited Iberia noted, they had ‘no experience with foreign names withthe result that persons were often classified under the Christian name or, asoften happened with long-winded Spanish names, under the mother’s family name’.images [images/icon.jpg]One person who always used his family name was the Duke of Windsor.Since the outbreak of war, the former Edward VIII had been kicking his heels inFrance looking for a more meaningful role than the pointless liaison job he hadbeen handed with French Army General Headquarters. When la patrie had fallen inJune, the former monarch had fled first to the Riviera and, characteristically,demanded that a warship pick up him and Mrs Simpson from Nice. His request fellon deaf ears. Sulking and moaning followed, which prompted his various commentsthat only a negotiated peace with Hitler would end things.As with many other refugees that summer – a vast tsunami of them – the Windsorshad headed over the border to Spain ahead of the German forces. Even without theadded complication of their royal personages, Madrid was already a crucible ofintrigue, rumour and shifting allegiances. Though supposedly neutral, Franco’sministers could be characterised by their various competing and virulent strainsof pro- and anti-British feeling, which rose and fell like Atlantic swells. Thegeneralissimo himself had hedged his bets by declaring his country anon-belligerent as opposed to completely neutral. He had sacked his pro-Britishforeign minister and replaced him with his pro-Nazi brother-in-law, SerranoSuńer.Add to that extensive German commercial influence and a primal fear of apowerful Royal Navy, the situation was potentially combustible. A furtherflashpoint for Spanish public outrage was Gibraltar. On his arrival in Madridthat June, the new British ambassador, Sir Samuel Hoare,5 was greeted by awell-organised demonstration that had been looked on favourably by the police.‘Gibraltar is Spanish! Gibraltar is Spanish!’ came the cries.Staying at the Ritz, Hoare found it full of aggressive Germans and was convincedall his conversations were being snooped upon. ‘You can imagine the state ofnerves in which Spain and Madrid find themselves after the German arrival on thePyrenees,’ Hoare wrote to the prime minister at the end of June 1940. ‘I try tokeep an appearance of calm but it is not always easy in face of a completelygermanised press and many germanised departments of state.’The Spanish press were being expertly fed by the Nazi propaganda machine. Intime, the British Embassy itself would be stoned by a Falangist mob, attentivelyphotographed by German intelligence staff.Three weeks later, the Duke of Windsor had shown up at the same hotel.Now the rumours surfaced that both the duke and ambassador were negotiating withthe Nazis for peace to stop the death and destruction. ‘In London, hostilitytowards the duke and duchess was growing,’ writes the academic Neill Lochery, arecent chronicler of these times.For the newly formed administration of Winston Churchill, the situation was morethan embarrassing. What followed next was a series of events, in the recentwords of a German historian, which involved ‘aspects bordering on the ridiculousand not totally free of a certain operatic quality’ that played against animpending sense of catastrophe.images [images/icon.jpg]Throughout the summer of 1940, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris travelled to Spain to laya false trail that, even today, remains murky and mysterious. ‘If for any reason“Sea Lion” would have to be postponed,’ the Führer had supposedly said to him,‘I want to seize Gibraltar.’ When he arrived at Calle Castellana at the end ofJuly, Wilhelm Canaris soon confided to his crony Leissner the real reasonsbehind his visit.In Berlin, the eyes of military planners alighted on the craggy rock and itsimportant military facilities. What became known as Operation Felix wasdistilled through the late summer and autumn of 1940, which would have seen aGerman occupation of Spain as well as its ports in Morocco and the CanaryIslands. The proposed onslaught would be a variation on blitzkrieg, its detailsdictated by the unique topography of the target as he would now determine.‘Uncle’ himself then drove down to Algeciras and watched the shipping whichpassed through the Straits of Gibraltar. The Abwehr maintained a constant watchon convoys and cargoes and, as a post-war examination noted, for all itsshortcomings, Canaris’s men gained significant information from the monitoringof the various vessels and crews which passed through the straits. They alsoobtained information from bribing officials, something which the British alsodid. A game of cat and mouse was played by enlisting local police, stevedoresand clock-watchers for intelligence purposes.Admiral Canaris then moved to a nearby hotel where he listened in to Britishnaval officers chatting at a nearby table before visiting a Spanish army officerwith whom he discussed the colony. Across Algeciras Bay and along the spit ofland which formed the isthmus of La Línea, the Abwehr gazed longingly and attimes forlornly at what a later MI5 security officer correctly termed theshowpiece in ‘an immense military tattoo’ for which enemy agents had a ringsideseat.Nobody could turn an appropriately Nelsonian blind eye to the dangers facingGibraltar from across Algeciras Bay. A later analysis for MI5 records:From these observation stations, [The Abwehr] received constant and valuableinformation on Allied convoys and cargoes. The KO [Abwehr station] also sentpeople on board ships calling at Spanish ports to question the crews on whatthey had seen at sea or in Allied countries. Employees in shipping offices werealso bribed to pass on information to make an extra copy of shipping and cargolists.Indeed, watchers were chosen either for their linguistic ability or theirknowledge of shipping. Worse was an almost primeval fear that the Spaniards werealso refuelling and revictualling U-boats.6On this visit, the admiral’s ‘associates’ were in reality engineers,paratroopers and artillerymen who would shortly stake out the Rock (all with theblessing and complicit military assistance of the Spanish). Their microscopicevaluation of the giant rock led Canaris to envisage what one biographer calls‘a three day military operation resembling a game of cowboys and Indians on thegrand scale’, a major assault on the Rock with crack Wehrmacht units storming inunder Spanish command.Yet, as several commentators have noted, Operation Felix only ever fed that mostarrogant of follies within the secret world: self-deception. An invasion forcecould hardly remain incognito to spring a surprise attack. From high above, thedefenders would easily spot the oncoming forces. Even if they could somehowcamouflage their presence, there was only a single road leading towards thecolony. Steep slopes, turbulent winds and limited landing grounds would precludea parachute or glider attack.For most of 1940, Adolf Hitler had a bee in his bonnet about this most potentsymbol of British power. Whoever controlled Gibraltar essentially dictated navalaccess to and from the Mediterranean.7 Ironically, both the head of the Abwehrand the British prime minister would come to share the same view of the colonythat summer of 1940: that it would save the British Empire. And in this regard,Canaris marvelled at the survival skills of a fellow great intriguer.‘What can I do against the great W.C.?’ he once said in front of his underlings.‘I am only the little W.C.’images [images/icon.jpg]The great W.C. made sure that a gimlet eye was kept on the Duke of Windsor.With the growing heat, both physical and political, upon them, he and Walliswould go on to Lisbon, where the thrice-weekly BOAC flying boat would returnthem to London. That was the last place His Royal Highness wished to go buttheir stay in Madrid had, as Hoare noted, ‘stimulated pro-German propaganda’.Even at his best, the duke was temperamental, self-absorbed and expected to betreated like a king, though his mood swings were hardly helped by the demands ofa difficult wife. And now, with his enforced isolation in Iberia, he was evenworse. Behind the scenes, the oily Suńer consulted with Franco. There was enoughevidence where the duke’s sympathies lay. It was obvious to everyone that hecould be used as some sort of instrument for peace. But what exactly?The answer to this question in the years since has veered anywhere from honestbroker to puppet king. Certainly, the Royal Family in London were convinced thathe simply wanted to avoid the Blitz, for he had always shown a marked aversionto suffering. When, in a strange coincidence, his brother the Duke of Kent wasabout to make his own official visit to Lisbon and asked if he would await hisbrother, his reply was simple: ‘Good god, no.’And behind the scenes, something was afoot.The German foreign minister, the pompous and self-important Joachim vonRibbentrop, thought he could use this situation to curry favour with the Führer.A former ambassador to London, Ribbentrop acted upon all the diplomatic gossip.The foreign minister pointedly excluded the Abwehr and Canaris, who was, as wewill see, in Spain at the same time. He knew exactly what kind of game theadmiral might play. In Walter Schellenberg’s recollections, von Ribbentrop had apeculiar vision of what was going on: ‘The crux of the matter is that, since hisabdication, the Duke of Windsor has been under strict surveillance by theBritish Secret Service.’And every attempt to get him from under its wings had failed.He wanted to mount a secret operation to bring the duke over to the German side,but for what exact purpose was never abundantly clear. For this, von Ribbentropbypassed Canaris, Himmler and Heydrich and went directly to the coming man ofGerman intelligence. Walter Schellenberg was surprised at the summons to theForeign Ministry, the more so for what he was being asked to do: to negotiatewith the duke but to make sure they avoided their favourite bogeyman. ‘If theBritish secret service should try to frustrate the Duke [then] the Führer ordersthat you are to circumvent the British plans, even at the risk of your life.’images [images/icon.jpg]The great W.C. had, cannily, ensured that a swashbuckler was in place to keephis eyes on Spain. Commander Alan Hillgarth had a significance far greater thanhis relatively lowly role of naval attaché based in Madrid, which for historicalreasons was far more important a posting than it first appeared. Hillgarth wasjust the sort of buccaneer who appealed to the prime minister. He had beenwounded at the Dardanelles in the Great War, had prospected for Bolivian goldand written the kind of adventure novels in which he alone could so easily havebeen the star. He had impressed both Churchill and Admiral Godfrey, and wasappointed as joint representative of MI6 and the Naval Intelligence Division.8Almost inevitably, Hillgarth made enemies.Given his closeness to the new prime minister, some felt both succumbed to afolie à deux, each feeding off the other’s natural tendency to self-importanceand grandeur. Yet a swashbuckler was needed because the intelligence structurein Iberia was weak, the result of what an official history acknowledges aslong-term inactivity in the Mediterranean.‘I had, in fact, to create a sort of substitute MI6,’ Hillgarth would laterwrite.It hardly helped that the new ambassador had developed an antipathy to theexisting MI6 Head of Station, Leonard Hamilton Stokes. He was very quicklysidelined by Sir Samuel Hoare, who also ensured that all his other intelligencestaff ‘were in competition with each other for his favour’. The ambassador triedto rise above it by insisting that the service ‘must not fall foul of theSpaniards’ and not get involved with anti-Franco supporters.The day after Sir Samuel had taken up his post, Commander Alan Hillgarth senthim a memo: ‘The British Embassy in Spain, as a whole, has until recentlyrefused to take into account the fact we are at war.’ To Hillgarth’sastonishment, there had been no effective control of the entrance to thebuilding, no night watchman and no specially secure safe for holding secretmaterial. ‘One cannot be too careful,’ he recorded of the situation he found.‘In Spain no one was watched all the time, but everyone was watched some of thetime.’There was little room for manoeuvre. Plenty of Spaniards, he later wrote, wereknown to be in the pay of the Germans. ‘Though they were by no means asinventive or as enterprising as they might have been,’ Hillgarth noted, ‘theywere not inactive and they had some ingenious ideas.’ Rumours were not only thestock in trade of the diplomatic community, for, as he noted, ‘the country liveson word of mouth stories’. By choosing friends who were ‘inveterate gossips’ andheld great influence, Hillgarth could keep his ears to the ground in full viewof the enemy.They were helped as there had been a virtual famine in the Spanish capital formost of 1940, the result, another MI6 officer noted, of the lingering effects ofthe Civil War. ‘People in the streets looked cowed and half-starved,’ KennethBenton recalled. ‘Those who had been on the wrong side could not get jobs, andmany were shot every morning at dawn.’In his New Year message, the generalissimo had acknowledged the hardships – theshortages of wheat, petrol, meat and sugar were acute – but knew he could dolittle.images [images/icon.jpg]When the Duke of Windsor arrived in Lisbon in July 1940, it was an even moreseething cauldron of intrigue, awash with tittle-tattle, gossip, fear and anendless sea of refugees streaming in from all around the occupied Europeanterritories. ‘Lisbon was the bottle-neck of Europe,’ wrote Arthur Koestler, ‘thelast open gate of a concentration camp extending over the greater part of theContinent’s surface.’Grimness and seediness contrasted with the grandeur and brightness of thePortuguese capital. The lack of blackout (not for nothing was Lisbon known asthe Cidade da Luz, city of light) contrasted everything that was happeningbehind the scenes all the more starkly. Gossip grew out of control as people ofall nations came to chat and socialise over drinks. ‘Rumour, counter-rumour andtales of fantasy dominated the conversations in these bars,’ Neill Locherry haswritten. ‘British and German spies told tales to enlist or frighten theclientele.’A surfeit of suspicion descended thanks to the all-watchful eyes of aGestapo-trained secret police. Even if you weren’t a spy, an innocent visitorwould frequently be believed to be one. Informers loitered everywhere in thehope of picking up tips or spotting something which could be traded with thehighest bidder. The docks were the most obvious location. Ships were logged,supplies were disrupted and rumours were spread by using the disaffected lowerranks, especially the seamen who could hardly resist the beautiful women whomysteriously appeared like Sirens of old.Simply stated, they were on the waterfront and on the game.The naval branch of the Abwehr had set up and also financed its own brothelsdown by the docks so the women could obtain information about ships andintelligence about convoys. In its less salacious way, British Intelligence hadofficials pretending they needed similar information for newspapers, Lloyd’sList, jealous wives or even Interpol. As one Abwehr officer noted, the strictercontrol of the Portuguese made their work very difficult. As a result, theSalazar government could not afford to antagonise the Germans. Gamblers were notrestricted to the Estoril casino, for as Neill Locherry writes: ‘It was a policyof knife-edge neutrality, a poker game for the future.’But the problem was that nothing was as it seemed. Lisbon was full of refugees,hotel rooms were at a premium and so was mischief – not least with such shadyclientele. ‘Lisbon is completely covered by a German espionage net,’ a reportfor MI5 by the embassy military attaché noted, ‘There are no hotels,restaurants, cafés, etc, of the slightest importance where there are not manyGerman agents. In the more popular hotels, the head waiters are often Germanagents.’Against this backdrop, the Windsors didn’t want to be the lesser bargainingchips. ‘I won’t have them push us into a bottom drawer,’ he said to Wallis. Onlywith the offer of a sinecure in the sunshine as the governorship of the Bahamaswould the duke leave Iberia. They arrived where he wanted – and expected – tostay: at the glamorous Hotel Palácio in Estoril, where, amongst other things,the barman was reputed to make the best Manhattan in Europe.images [images/icon.jpg]It was a curious fact that the Duke of Windsor ended up at the Mouth of Hellwhere, even stranger, his host was the Holy Ghost. As with some vaguely biblicalparable, there was literally no room at the inn. Of all the Portuguese hotels,the Palácio was the most glamorous – and expensive. With all hotel rooms at apremium (the influx of refugees had increased costs so that only kings couldprobably afford them) both the hotel and the nearby casino, the largest in thecountry, were, as Neill Locherry has written, Rick’s café on a grander scale.The clientele of both were aristocrats, expats, spies, smugglers and diamondtraders. At the Palácio, even the chambermaids were on the payroll.The Boca do Inferno was the name of the region up the coast at Cascais where theduke stayed courtesy of the well-connected and effortlessly charming privatebanker Ricardo Espiŕito Santo. His two-storey house on the edge of Cascais waswell hidden, looking out over the crashing waves of the Atlantic. As a confidantof the German ambassador, he was an odd choice to host His Majesty, a cause ofmuch concern to the British, a private banker with many dealings with theGermans. Yet it was abundantly clear that Santo was pulling the strings. ThePVDE, the Portuguese secret police, would learn exactly what was going on andthe Duke of Windsor would be clearly looked after.Yet the Holy Ghost was hardly the stooge that the British feared. With thebanker’s Jewish wife, Edward VIII made an uneasy accomplice. With dinnerparties, gold and visits to the casino at Estoril, the former playboy prince wastrapped in the gilded palace of his own pomposity, not least when a telegramarrived from the prime minister demanding that he return to Britain. It is saidthat the Duke of Windsor was so upset that he drafted a telegram where hepetulantly resigned all his military commissions. Various German officials inPortugal continued to report gossip that the duke wanted to end the war.The villa where the duke stayed was guarded – at Sir Stewart Menzies’sinsistence – by the local police. A king’s ransom would have been little morethan an extortion for peace had one of the murkier episodes of the secret warbeen successful, around which so many rumours still swirl. Given the appropriatename of Operation Willi, one of the stranger episodes about which even odderrumours have surfaced.Foremost amongst them was Walter Schellenberg himself who added some curiousdetails such as his supposed attempted poisoning by the British. Operation Williwas hardly ever a prolonged operation by German Intelligence.The Reichsminister wanted the duke back in Spain where he could be betterreasoned with. Von Ribbentrop gave Schellenberg the authority to offer 50million Swiss Francs to the duke as an ‘inducement’. ‘Hitler attaches thegreatest importance to this operation,’ the foreign minister said. What happenednext is unclear – one version has the duke meeting Heydrich and Hess – butSchellenberg flew to Lisbon to oversee all the spying operations around theduke’s villa. Operation Willi was always half-hearted and in his memoirs,Schellenberg took a weary, pessimistic tone, not least with the idea to useforce if necessary. The duke, indolently playing golf or visiting the casinos,seemed to be bored in the sunshine.images [images/icon.jpg]For anyone wanting a proper game of poker, the large, round building at the endof the Palácio’s gardens was the obvious place to visit. The casino in Estorilis the largest in Europe and has attained a far greater significance in themythology of Second World War espionage than anywhere else. Full of fat cats,the Riviera set and rich émigrés who had money to escape to the United States,it also had its fair share of hustlers, smugglers, diamond thieves – and spies.And, thanks to his own later visit there, the Estoril Casino would attain a fargreater significance surrounding Ian Fleming’s wartime experiences. In thecompany of Admiral Godfrey, he spied some sinister-looking players who wore darkglasses.‘What if those men had been German secret service agents?’ he asked in a momentof fanciful whim. ‘Suppose we had cleaned them out of their money. Now thatwould have been exciting.’It would be another regular habitué of the casino who would come to attract theattention of British Intelligence. The problem with all foreigners who madecontact saying they wanted to work for Britain was that they could rarely betaken at face value. The Venlo incident showed how careful they had to be. Whatmade it exceptionally difficult was that Portugal was being flooded withrefugees of one sort or another, so when just before Christmas – as crowdsshivered in the streets – MI5 heard a new agent was coming, they were on highalert.‘The German secret service is very active at Lisbon and dispatching agents tothis country,’ a review for the security service would note during the secondweek of January 1941. And in the case of this fellow who made contact at the endof October, everything about him seemed to set off alarms and prejudices: by hisown confession, he was an unlikely spy and playboy with slicked back hair,bright green eyes and what MI5 later called ‘the appearance of being aMongolian-Slav type with rather high cheek bones’.And so Dusko Popov entered the secret war.images [images/icon.jpg]Earlier that summer, the SS Head of Counterespionage quickly came to theconclusion that the once King of England would not want to be a future monarchunder a swastika. On 31 July, a message was delivered to von Ribbentrop thatGermany was about to invade Great Britain. The immediacy of the duke’s possiblerole in brokering the peace increased dramatically. So Schellenberg ordered thecontinual harassment of his royal highness – including the throwing of rocksthrough the window and the telephoning of anonymous threats – which he hopedwould be attributed to the British Secret Service. And then, after morefrustrating days of inaction, came the final order of all: grab the duke at anycost. Schellenberg wisely decided to ignore this last-ditch madness on the partof the foreign minister. ‘Since the Duke has so little in sympathy with ourplans, an abduction would be madness,’ he later wrote.Schellenberg flew back to Berlin, where he was warmly congratulated by Heydrich.‘I feel that you shouldn’t have accepted this assignment in the first place,’ hesaid. ‘Obviously you realised from the beginning how it would probably end. Imust say that you carried it off shrewdly.’The same could never be said for the object of all the manoeuvring. Now en routeto the Bahamas, the Duchess of Windsor thought it an amusing example of how theGermans horribly misunderstood the British character. And in Wallis’srecollection, when he later heard about what had been planned after the war, theduke was stunned.‘But how could we possibly be of any use to them?’ he asked.Perhaps inadvertently, the Duke of Windsor had provided his own epitaph.images [images/icon.jpg]The key to understanding the character of Dusan Miladoroff Popov, several of hishandlers noted, was his charm, a joyous playfulness that attracted people fromall walks of life. In every sense of the word, Dusko (as he was usually known)would lead an enchanted existence with what one recent chronicler had termed‘all the charm, sexual energy and vigour which is the hallmark still of a trueRagusian squire’. Famously, he would be spotted dancing in nightclubs with themost beautiful women.On one notorious occasion he bought a whole horse-drawn cart load of flowers onthe spur of the moment to give to his latest (however fleeting) inamorata. Fromthe moment of his entry into the secret world, he grasped the essentialabsurdity of the situation. A highly developed sense of humour, it was clear,would be needed to survive the dangers and rigours of deceit.The Popovs were a well-established and well-to-do royalist family who lived wellin the ancient port of Dubrovnik, and (‘by Yugoslav standards’, as he later putit) were wealthy. Despite the various upheavals of his native land throughoutthe early years of the century, they were well connected, too. A foreigneducation at a lycée in Paris, an English public school (from which he wasexpelled) and university in the German city of Freiburg followed.By the late thirties, the clouds of war overshadowed his studies. Dusko tookcare to play sports and pursued pleasure in equal measure. To his delight, inFreiburg the prettiest girls were to be found in the Aüslander Club, forstudents who were foreign, like him. The president of which was Johann ‘Johnny’Jebsen, who adopted an aristocratic standoffishness, emphasised by his wearingof a monocle and assuming the supercilious demeanour of the frosty hauteur.Dusko Popov, however, could see through the act.The pair bonded through a shared capacity for fun, which usually involved womenand sports cars. Soon he learned that his new fast friend had managed to avoidmilitary service by joining the Abwehr thanks to the patronage of one of AdmiralCanaris’s deputies, Hans Oster. Johnny Jebsen too was already exhibiting theanti-Nazi tendencies which were now fomenting in the uppermost reaches of theFuchsbau. In the spring of 1940 came another twist in Popov’s native Belgrade. Afriend of Johnny’s – a pompous German who turned out to be the chief recruiterfor the Abwehr in Central Europe – asked Dusko to work for Germany.‘I can’t really say that I was shocked,’ Dusko later recalled, ‘or thatsurprised.’If anything, he was angry with his old friend for putting him in such aposition. To his slight puzzlement, Johnny Jebsen said that there were distinctbenefits of opposing an organisation from within. The next day, Dusko went tothe British Embassy to report this approach from the Abwehr. There he wasintroduced to the Passport Control Officer, the MI6 resident in the Balkans whoused the unlikely name of Fickis. In time, after checking with London, Dusko wasencouraged to join the Germans. A certain amount of circumspection wasinevitable after the Venlo incident the previous autumn.By now, the Abwehr wanted Dusko Popov to be inveigled into the higher reaches ofthe British Establishment in London. Over cocktails in the summer of 1940,Johnny Jebsen elaborated the reasons why. ‘They have been desperately lookingfor a man who can move in the upper stratum of British society,’ Jebsen said.‘The man was to have other qualities as well, as you can imagine. In essence, hehas to have the makings of a superspy.’images [images/icon.jpg]That October, Tom Delmer had flown to Lisbon, where he filed a heavily trailedseries of articles for the Daily Express about refugees from Occupied Europe.They were designed to – and did, indeed – present a vivid picture of what wouldhappen if the Nazis ever invaded Great Britain. It was vintage Delmer stuff,appealing to his vast readership in a newspaper that was then in its heyday, hisown experiences informing much of the narrative. The first, on Tuesday, 24October 1940, referred to his interpreter who had helped him escape the bombingin Warsaw just over a year earlier.Now, according to a note smuggled out of occupied Poland, she and countlessothers had been drafted into manual labour for the Third Reich. The whole serieswas aptly termed ‘The Slave States’ as an antidote to pervasive Germanpropaganda. Warsaw was but a shadow of itself, an agricultural wasteland whoseindustrial might had been destroyed, not just by the bombing but the wholesalelooting and shutting down of manufacturing.It was, Delmer claimed, a pattern repeated all over Europe.There were shortages of food all over the occupied territories, not least inNorway and Denmark, where, according to another informant, there was so littlefuel that rugs were being knitted to keep people warm in offices. All thisinformation came from the refugees with whom he was able to meet and discussfreely. Importantly for the future, there were stirrings of the resistance inthe Low Countries.‘In a thousand ways, Dutchmen and Belgians are carrying on the fight against theintruder,’ Delmer wrote, ‘encouraging their own people, who rejoice in passingfrom mouth to mouth, news of the latest exploits of the freedom fighters.’Certainly, what had been trumpeted across the Low Countries as Hitler’s New Deal– inevitably termed the ‘Raw Deal’ – had seen endless suffering. In his finalarticle that week, Delmer noted that although the psychological scars remained,not least in France where the population was ‘still too exhausted to fight evena war of sabotage’, hope was springing that salvation would be delivered.‘All our reports agree that there is much greater popular confidence today inBritain’s ultimate ability to conquer Germany than there was four months ago,’Delmer concluded from the émigrés to whom he talked. He ended with his ownemotional appeal. ‘I look forward to the day when the passive resistance turnsactive,’ Delmer wrote of the slave states. ‘That day is coming as sure as timegoes on.’Ironically, his own deliverance was upon him.Over the next few weeks, Tom remained in Lisbon, from where he filed otherreports with further information from the ceaseless flood of escapees. Somewere, to say the least, surprising. By early December, he had met a party of 200Jews who, it transpired, had been bribed by the Sicherheitsdienst to escape fromNazi Germany. ‘You have no idea what it feels like to be out after the seveno’clock curfew hour for Jews,’ one of them told him. In Berlin, she said themain topic of conversation was about RAF bombing. And later, when he was askedto pass on a letter for a teenage refugee – later printed in full in the Express– Delmer reported that on one train passing through France, this poor girl hadseen some sailors. ‘They said the [Royal] Navy would never surrender to theGermans and that England was sure to win the war.’It was all good, stirring stuff and, by the end of the year, in his guise as aDaily Express correspondent, Tom Delmer was only too well aware of the greatdisparity between intelligence work and journalism. His articles for the Expresswere read by 12 million people, where his reports to MI6 were, as he acidlyrecalled, only ever seen by a few people, largely unread and then incinerated.While visiting the Portuguese capital, in Delmer’s memory, a rabbit-toothed OldEtonian invited him to lunch, where matters of intelligence were discussed.‘You have been working in England for MI6,’ this supposed businessman told him.‘I work for no-one but the Daily Express,’ Delmer replied.There was a smile and an entreaty to cut the comedy.‘I represent MI6 here,’ the Etonian said. ‘You were told in London, I believe,that we might be getting in touch with you?’And soon, much to his surprise, they were.images [images/icon.jpg]For all their fears, none of the British informants in Iberia – and thatincluded Alan Hillgarth’s extensive and usually well-placed agents – had pickedup any hints of transit rights or plans prefacing an invasion of Gibraltar.After seeing London survive the Blitz, the Spanish were impressed. ‘GeneralFranco has lost almost all his prestige,’ Hillgarth had written in September.‘He is regarded by everybody as being asleep and under the thumb of hisbrother-in-law.’ This was Suńer, the Minister of the Interior, who vied for thetitle of most hated man in Europe.Bribery and corruption was occurring and the Spanish Army was ill-equipped andhardly mobilised. With British resolve, many Spaniards believed the Britishwould prevail. But more than that, as Winston Churchill had perceptively notedearlier that year, he suspected Franco ‘only thought about keeping hisblood-drained people out of another war’.And that informed the discussion between the Spanish and German leaders, mano àmano, at the end of October 1940 about the fate of Gibraltar. Adolf Hitlerwearily complained that he would rather have ‘three or four teeth extracted thanto go through that again’. The conference at Hendaye on the Spanish border didnot go well. Neither side was willing to accede to the other. The Führer wasunequivocal. Spain should enter the fighting in January 1941, starting with anattack on Gibraltar. Operation Felix needed to be in motion before the ThirdReich could invade Soviet Russia. Franco, though seemingly friendly, wasintransigent.9Behind the scenes, Wilhelm Canaris had met with the generalissimo privately andwarned him that he should not do as Hitler wanted. The admiral confided thatBarbarossa was already in the planning stages and that the Führer had nointention of invading Spain should Il Caudillo prove too truculent. ‘Franco’sposition,’ said one who was party to the discussions, ‘was totally influenced byCanaris.’The clock was ticking. German troops would need to enter Spain by 10 January1941 for Operation Felix to have any chance of working. But Il Caudillo stoodfirm, insisting that Spain could not join in the fighting because of militaryunpreparedness and lack of food supplies. What Canaris had grasped – and Hitlernever did – was that the window of opportunity so far as an invasion ofGibraltar was concerned had closed.Soon the Joint Intelligence Committee was reporting in London that Franco wouldnot co-operate with Hitler, nor would Germany now invade Spain. Some havespeculated that Admiral Canaris himself was the source of this information. Yet,despite Adolf Hitler’s growing preoccupation with lands to the East, BritishIntelligence remained worried about his capriciousness. ‘If Spain were draggedinto the war by Hitler,’ another MI6 officer based in Lisbon later wrote, ‘therewould be nothing whatever to stop the latter from occupying Portugal.’The long-term fate of Iberia would come to loom large in the secret war fornobody wanted to leave Spain or Portugal in the hands of fate. Given hisincreasing waywardness, Adolf Hitler might suddenly demand precipitate action.What would happen if the Germans seized Spain and Portuguese ports? Worse,suppose blockaded Spanish and, indeed, Portuguese and neutral merchant shipswere forced to fly the swastika? Who knew what whim might prompt him to occupySpain and/or Gibraltar for himself? And in case that happened came an operationwith a name that appealed to one of its unrepentant partisans: Goldeneye.images [images/icon.jpg]Every so often, the gaiety of the nation is immeasurably enriched when somenewspaper or writer claims that they have found the ‘real’ James Bond or atleast the real-life inspiration for 007. One name features repeatedly on thelist and, with his various claims of weekends with C, evenings drinkingchampagne in casinos in the company of statuesque blondes, scars earned toassuage insulted honours in obscure duelling societies, bumping off chauffeursor surviving exploding cars and the injection of truth serum in interrogations,Dusko Popov sounds all too plausible a candidate. Given that Popov also himselfclaimed he was followed by Ian Fleming around the Estoril casino a few weekslater, the pedigree of his claim does seem impeccable.Yet Fleming himself always insisted that 007 was a figment of his over-activeimagination. Significantly, another of the author’s wartime colleagues wouldlater note that Popov ‘exhibited a basic common sense that James Bond neverdisplayed’. If anything, Austin Powers was nearer the mark. Dusko was ahedonist, an accomplished embellisher of tales and a serial seducer of suchassiduity that there still lingers today the rumour of an alleged predispositionto threesomes. As a lawyer negotiating import-export deals from his nativeYugoslavia, it was imperative that he travel freely and live the kind ofcarefree life expected by both sides. He could only do that if the Britishbelieved that he was bona fide, and soon he passed muster. ‘He is courageous,discreet and has great charm,’ an MI5 assessment records. ‘Accustomed to thegood life, he spends money freely.’In other words, he was everything a putative playboy should be.He was self-confident, handsome, witty and completely charming. Most of thepeople he came into contact with – either male or female – were instantlybeguiled by his charisma. Though not exactly good-looking (he was slightlyhunchbacked, though few ever seemed to notice), his charm attracted people, andthat certainly included more mistresses than most Britons could ever understand.Unlike most agents dispatched to the British Isles, Dusko was hardly a socialmisfit on the make.British Intelligence now had to decide whether he was genuine or not. After theVenlo incident, there was a sense that nothing could be taken for granted. Forhis part, Dusko was impressed by the great resilience of the native Londoners.And now he would be afforded the red carpet treatment for he would become a keyelement in pulling the wool over the Germans’ eyes for the rest of the fighting.In the luxurious manner to which he was accustomed, Dusan Miladoroff Popov had,in every sense of the word, arrived in the secret war after his visa had beenapproved at the start of December 1940.After arriving in Britain, as one architect of what followed noted, he was ‘anew agent of high quality who could plausibly meet persons in any socialstratum’, mixing in the rarefied upper circles close to the top. As a result,his conquests – in every sense of the word – included a relationship with astriptease artist and, more importantly (though not carnally), herbrother-in-law, who just happened to be Sir Stewart Menzies. Fairly quickly,that would involve a unique experience for a double agent: he was allowed tomeet the most mysterious and influential figure behind the scenes, the Chief ofthe Secret Intelligence Service himself.images [images/icon.jpg]As the shouting crowds had shown, the great fortress of Jurassic rock that flewthe Union Jack was a festering sore so far as the average Spaniard wasconcerned. Yet for servicemen stationed in Gibraltar there was another form ofbellowing that they enjoyed, usually at closing time, where they would sing atthe top of their voices:Symbol of the British EmpireHaughtily Gibraltar standsNever will this proud erectionBe reduced by Axis handsIf the colony was invaded, which at various times seemed likely, then stepswould have to be taken to maintain essential communications with London. Therudiments of a sabotage network would have to be put in place to subvert thecountry from within. So a sophisticated plan was developed by the NavalIntelligence Division which, if word of it had leaked, would have led to thesummary ejection of British diplomatic officials from Iberia.What was given the name Operation Goldeneye was expanded under the influence ofLieutenant Ian Fleming RNVR. The future creator of James Bond spent much timeshuttling between Britain and Iberia working out the physical details. AsFleming’s most recent biographer, Andrew Lycett, has put it, Goldeneye ‘proved acauldron for inter-service rivalries’ between Naval Intelligence and MI6, aswell as their respective sponsors, the Admiralty and the Foreign Office.Fleming travelled to Lisbon, then Madrid, where he stayed with the Hillgarths.In Ian’s recollection, they went by road to Gibraltar where Mary, Hillgarth’swife, attached a white ensign to the radio antenna, but as Hillgarth’sbiographer has noted, ‘her opinion of his efficiency as a secret agent wasundermined when he left his wallet behind on the table in a restaurant’. On hisreturn, he wrote Alan a most secret letter to say ‘how much I appreciated being“under your wing”.’In those same early months of 1941, Commander Alan Hillgarth spent much of histime assessing the mood of the country. ‘Spanish susceptibilities would in allprobability preclude sailings en bloc to United Kingdom at any rate until theextent of British action crystallizes,’ he concluded. Another option was todispatch Royal Navy ships into ports like Vigo and unload demolition parties.Yet the sabotage to be carried out by H section of the Special OperationsExecutive was vehemently opposed by the ambassadors in both Spain andPortugal.10The files show the veneer of almost oriental politeness surrounding thepoliticking back in London. Sir Stewart Menzies became involved – a letter onblue parchment signed in C’s green ink survives in the NID files – over exactlywho said what to whom, who was responsible for what and all the otherbureaucratic battles which a prolonged bailiwick dispute usually (and tediously)involve.In his usual emollient way, Lieutenant Fleming managed to cover up most of thecracks. Indeed, he was in his element, travelling on an elaborate diplomaticpassport and wearing the dark blue suit and Old Etonian tie that were positivelynatty for the time. As one early biographer has remarked, ‘he must have felt hewas stepping into the pages of Maugham’s Ashenden at last.’ Though Fleming alsocarried a commando knife and a fountain pen fitted with a cyanide cartridge, hiswork was less like James Bond than that of a senior clerk in his pre-warstockbroking days. Fleming’s task was literally to take stock of the situationin and around the Rock.‘I feel that if Gibraltar is lost there is no hope that Tangier could work as aseparate Intelligence Centre,’ Fleming later noted for Admiral Godfrey. At hissuggestion, a local Joint Intelligence Centre should be formed to co-ordinateall sources of information streaming into Gibraltar to make sure nothing wasmissed.On a personal level, there was also an amusing interlude which involved a manwith a name that sounds like something from Fleming’s imagination: CommanderGreenleaves, an embassy official in Tangier who was ‘a most likeable andenergetic man’, in the writer’s estimation. If nothing else, his name appealedto 007’s creator, not least because it was a nom de guerre.Whether they were drunk or not, he and Greenleaves enjoyed themselves. Theirhigh spirits spilled over into their daubing a large V for Victory sign on therunway at the airport, for which Fleming was later carpeted, though at the timehe referred to it as ‘the unfortunate incident’ in his writings to AdmiralGodfrey and left it at that.images [images/icon.jpg]Another purpose for Ian Fleming’s journey south to the Rock at the start of 1941was to meet a silver-haired American divorce lawyer who was an intimate ofPresident Roosevelt. Called ‘my secret legs’ by the polio-stricken president,Colonel Bill Donovan had already visited the beleaguered British Isles to assessa very delicate question.Was Britain worth fighting for?The summer before, the colonel was given a red carpet treatment throughout histime in England. First, he met the king and queen at Buckingham Palace, and thenthe prime minister. Eventually he met Sir Stewart Menzies and Admiral JohnGodfrey. Donovan couldn’t help being impressed by the unwavering British resolveto keep on fighting. Britain, Donovan reported back to the president, would notsuccumb.His clean bill of health would essentially underwrite increasingly closeco-operation between the two countries, prompting the lend lease or ‘destroyersfor bases’ deal which marked the start of more formal Anglo-Americancollaborations at the start of 1941. ‘What we require are weapons, ships andaeroplanes,’ Churchill himself formally told another FDR adviser. ‘All that wecan pay for we will pay for, but we require far more than we shall be able topay for.’Now, at the start of 1941, Donovan was back, touring the neutral states ofEurope to assess the military situation once more. Lieutenant Fleming andCaptain Hillgarth would spend an entire evening briefing this presidential envoyabout the importance of the Goldeneye set-up in case of an invasion. Indeed,when Colonel Bill Donovan reported back in Washington, the president took allhis findings onboard: ‘It is of the utmost importance to make every practicaleffort to keep Spain out of the war as far as acting against the Axis Powers.’It would lead to a lasting working together between the US and the UnitedKingdom. Certainly, Fleming professed himself greatly impressed with Hillgarth’swork and promised to send the Naval Attaché in Madrid some long, fine Henry Claycigars, which he should smoke himself ‘and not give them to your rascallyfriends’, as he wrote on the package he later sent via the diplomatic bag.images [images/icon.jpg]During those same early weeks of 1941, everything also finally came together forTom Delmer. A few days later, when he returned home, Delmer received a telegramfrom Leonard Ingrams, a glamorous former Oxford Half Blue who flew his own PussMoth aeroplane around Europe. They had known each other before the war andDelmer was amazed to find him now a star operative in the secret war. A dashing,philandering kind of financier, Ingrams – father of the satirist and recentlyremoved editor of The Oldie, Richard – was well known for his imagination,insight and wit, and as a result created his own fair share of enemies.But at the start of 1941, he sent a telegram to his pre-war friend who was stillhanging around the Portuguese capital kicking his heels. Tom Delmer wasdelighted to read it: ‘Suggest you return earliest possible and resign fromExpress, important job awaits you.’Leonard Ingrams was as good as his word.When Tom Delmer met him for lunch, the man who was now working in secretintelligence made him an offer he could hardly refuse.‘How would it be if you resigned from the Express and came in full time on thisracket of broadcasting to the Germans?’ Ingrams asked.Significantly, he had obtained clearance for Delmer’s recruitment from allauthorities – crucially, that meant MI5, as Tom Delmer’s own recentlydeclassified files show – and now the journalist and occasional broadcastersuggested a whole new approach to undermining Hitler. ‘Not by opposing him,’Delmer said, ‘but by pretending to be all for him and war.’Leonard Ingrams told him to stop gassing and get on with it. Yet turning thatbasic idea into a functioning reality would take far longer to achieve thananyone thought necessary.Delmer’s background was of paramount importance so far as his future politicalwarfare work was concerned. He perfectly understood the Nazi mindset, somethingwhich had previously counted against him. As a result, he could skilfullycounter the increasingly insidious nature of German propaganda. Delmer was tobecome something of a presiding genius in sensing the potency of ‘blackpropaganda’ and, around this time, was given the nickname ‘Seldom Defter’ bysome, for he would turn a popgun into a howitzer. This change of fortunes wouldbe accompanied by an extraordinary character who came into his orbit, whomDelmer later described as walking down Piccadilly looking like an unmade bed,and who now predicted an invasion would come in 1941.The stars, it seemed, foretold that it was inevitable.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 The Daily Express of Tuesday, 17 September 1940 carried both Delmer’s storyand that of the US correspondent, H.R. Knickerbocker. ‘Hitler’s all bluff,’ saidone army officer to the latter, oddly echoing the rumours which the BrusselsFour had picked up. ‘If he doesn’t come soon we will have to build a bridge forhim.’2 As befitting a ministry that dealt with misinformation, there are manylegends and whispers about the building which is now the administrativeheadquarters of London University. That, for example, both Oswald Mosley andAdolf Hitler intended Senate House to be their respective parliaments and LondonHeadquarters. There is also the rumour that the Luftwaffe didn’t bomb it as itwas a near perfect navigation aid. Finally, there is supposed to the body of oneof its builders entombed in concrete or the often-stated fact that the buildingfaces the ‘wrong’ way.3 It soon became clear that the admiral had come to Spain in the company ofhis closest aides with the ostensible purpose of looking up old friends from theGreat War. On his various wartime trips to Iberia, Canaris would use a varietyof aliases, such as Ernest Volpi and, in Portugal, Wilhelm Gravig, Passport No.1570 (TNA KV 3/3 Canaris MSS Traffic). This time, he used the name JuanGuillermo and was travelling on an Argentine passport.4 The other half of the embassy staff worked for the Abwehr and many of them(eighty-seven officers at one point) travelled on diplomatic passports. Afterthe US entry to the war, the addition of radio intercept staff, attaches and therival Sicherheitsdienst took this figure up to 315 – nearly double thediplomatic staff of 171. In time, the Abwehrstelle would come to occupy two morehouses, several apartments and employ up to 2,000 informants. By the end of1944, there were more than 250 officers based there.5 Samuel Hoare himself was an odd choice. London recognised that such adelicate posting would require more than a career diplomat. Later ennobled asLord Templewood, he had been Foreign Secretary and, in one fell stroke, WinstonChurchill had removed a potential political rival to a hotspot of diplomatic –and other – activity. And with regard to those unavowed, undiplomaticactivities, Hoare had an unusual ace in the hole which very few of his staffknew at the time. In 1916, he had been recruited by Sir Mansfield Cumming to theSecret Intelligence Service, where he had been Head of Station in Petrograd andthe first to report the death of Rasputin. Many years later, Hoare bumped intoKenneth Benton on the steps of his club in London. The older man’s power ofrecall was astonishing. ‘How are all your agents, Benton?’ he asked.6 Most of this suspected activity centred on the Galician port of Vigo in thefirst few months of the war. Raided by Sir Francis Drake amongst others in lessrecent times, Vigo was, by the outbreak of the Second World War, a thriving andbusy commercial port. Yet its very remoteness made it more difficult to monitor,not least because many Spaniards there were openly hostile to the British cause.Though he was on the alert for such actions, Hillgarth later told an Americanjournalist: ‘You can take it as a definite that no German submarine refuelled atVigo during World War II.’7 Because of this importance, the directive for Operation Felix envisagedGerman troops would seize the colony. Three weeks before they struck, theWehrmacht forces would cross the Franco-Spanish border. Luftwaffe aircraft wouldtake off from France and attack the Royal Navy before landing in Spain ready forthe assault. Over 200 guns would concentrate around the rock, firing a barrageof 20,000 shells, followed by dive-bombers which would support the assaultacross the isthmus from La Línea. The rest of the forces would come ashore bylanding craft at North Mole. Mountain troops would be trained in the French Alpsto learn how to scale the crag-like terrain. As the Luftwaffe and the Royal AirForce battled over the skies of southern England, the Rock seemed an obviousnext target.8 More importantly, Winston Churchill had met Alan Hillgarth when he had beenVice Consul on the island of Majorca on the eve of the Spanish Civil War. WhenMrs Churchill complained about the state of their hotel accommodation, CommanderHillgarth put them up for a couple of nights. During the fighting that tore thecountry apart, he was resolute in trying to help stranded Britons, most famouslywhen he persuaded the Nationalists not to attack the battle cruiser HMS Repulsewhen it entered the Republican-held Barcelona to remove British citizens tosafety. The ship’s captain, John Godfrey, was impressed by Hillgarth’s dash,daring and also his great subtlety of mind. Three years later, on beingappointed Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral Godfrey remembered him.Both the British ambassador to Franco and the Permanent Under Secretary at theForeign Office – who had once referred to him as a charlatan – later declaredHillgarth was effective, discreet and exhibited that most elusive of attributesin the intelligence world: good judgement. Commander Hillgarth happily filedreports to both Sir Stewart Menzies and Admiral Godfrey. And the former FirstSea Lord and newly installed prime minister would refer to Alan Hillgarth as ‘agreat prop’ (ADM 223/490). Hillgarth soon minuted that a long shadow castingover Spain was the legacy of the Royal Navy from Elizabethan times. Itsmodern-day representative – following on from Walsingham and Drake – would betaken seriously, because ‘our prestige is still immense in Spain’. Indeed,Hillgarth’s use of the codename ‘Armada’ in correspondence with Menzies echoedthat (and to some, suggested an over-reaching grandiosity).9 Franco’s intransigence manifested itself in a series of logical butintolerable demands before he would agree to taking part in Operation Felix.Germany should supply him with grain instead of the Allies; new weapons andmateriel should be supplied so that his forces could be modernised; and largeswathes of Vichy North Africa should be transferred to Spanish administration.And, most stubbornly of all, General Franco would not sanction a German attackon Gibraltar. That left the residual horror of what one biographer of the Abwehrchief has termed ‘resolving it only by the Spanish themselves’. And that,unknown at the time, was their ace in the hole.10 For the rest of 1941, Alan Hillgarth also remained worried about theinvasion of Gibraltar If it did happen, he would be in the thick of it. ‘Ishould be kept informed of every hint [so] that I can tip off the Spaniards,’ hewrote to Admiral Godfrey, asking that the sabotage come under his wing. Godfreywas aghast – he didn’t want his star attaché compromised – but Hillgarth put hisfoot down. ‘If I’m not to be the head of the Naval Mission,’ he wrote toGodfrey, ‘please get me out of the country altogether and let me be usefulelsewhere.’"},{"pageContent":"8THE STARS FORETELL [contents.htm#a11][The] magnetic power of this man must be broken. To break it, we must not onlyinfluence the peoples all over the world: we must also influence the centre fromwhich the magnetism emanates: we must influence Hitler himself. This is not atall beyond our power. For, although obsessed, Hitler is still a human being, andas such subjected to certain hopes, and certain fears. We must thereforedisappoint and destroy these hopes. And we must increase, and a hundred timesincrease those fears. These two are the main themes of the campaign I suggest,the campaign I have called ‘The Orchestra of Hitler’s death’.‘The ouverture’, introduction to a campaign proposedby the astrologer Louis de Wohl for MI14,Spring 1941 (WO 208/4475)When, many years later, Admiral John Godfrey was asked about his similarities tothe fictional Admiral Sir Miles Messervy – better known as James Bond’s boss, M– he was aghast. The creation of his real-life assistant was nothing like hisown character, so he thought, although several recognised aspects of the crusty,demanding fictional head of the secret service had been lifted wholesale from‘Uncle John’s’ personality.Though some found him hard to take, for all his steely, heavy-handed ways (theDirector of Naval Intelligence always seemed to run on a short fuse) Godfrey’sfearsomeness was tempered by his flashing a demonic smile ‘at the end of agrilling’, as one subordinate remembered, ‘that could make a strong man wet inthe palms and weak in the bowels’. Beyond the stereotype of an irascible, saltysea dog were glimmerings of an intriguing personality. As his sympatheticbiographer has noted, ‘the paradoxes and contradictions of John Godfrey’s careerwere only equalled by the quirk and complexities of his character.’Uniquely for his time and position, Admiral Godfrey engaged a wider socialcircle than most men of the services, for as one of his obituaries from 1968pointed out, the wartime DNI ‘enjoyed greatly the company of scholars andartists, men of affairs and journalists’. His underlings within the departmentwere a similarly glittering collection of minds, with men who had beenbarristers, dons and even graphic designers.Perhaps such eclectic interests explain the DNI’s amazing ability atintellectual abstraction. For someone who had been considered the best navigatorin the service – traditionally employing the sextant and ephemerides – it was afurther mystery that John Godfrey advocated using the stars for other purposes.At the start of the war, Godfrey had suggested to his underlings that theyshould avoid ‘crystal gazing’, yet fairly quickly turned to astrology in thehope of prosecuting a very different form of warfare. As the admiral himselfexplained it, ‘under certain circumstances, it is what people believe thatmatters, not what it is.’Later he said:If one’s opponent is known to be a man who places faith in horoscopy and if, aswe are assured, it is an exact science, based on the date, time and place ofbirth, it would surely be unwise to neglect the existence of any advice beingtendered to him if, as we believed, our own people knew who were giving theadvice and could say what it was.Quite why someone as strait-laced and no-nonsense as ‘Uncle John’ was so mindedto consider such hocus-pocus has itself caused endless speculation. Though therewas the trace of the ‘academic manqué’ about the DNI, another obituary notedthat Admiral Godfrey ‘was appalled at any suggestion that he was even by navalstandards an “intellectual”’.Whatever else people thought of the boss, all agreed that Godfrey was a geniusin intelligence work. ‘The tribute is the more sincere as, in most ways, Idisliked him as a person,’ his underling Ewen Montagu later wrote. Indeed therewas something of a potential personality clash with this scion of the bankingdynasty, headed by his father Lord Swaythling. Many found Montagu hard to take,yet even he was dazed by this, the boss’s most peculiar contribution to thesecret war.‘It had occurred to that ingenious mind that Hitler was believed to have animmense faith in his pet astrologer,’ Montagu later recorded in his memoirs. ‘Ifyou could predict when Hitler was going to be lucky, then it would indicate hemight take a risk.’Even more remarkably, waiting in the wings was someone who could do exactlythat. What happened next would be very hard for anyone to predict, let alone across-dressing Hungarian astrologer who would now come to make his most singularcontribution to the secret war; the result, no doubt, of it being written in thestars.images [images/icon.jpg]So far as Louis de Wohl is concerned, the story would now come full circle – acomplete astrological one, in fact – in the autumn of 1940. With his typicaldevotion to duty, the Hungarian had diligently made it his business to let asmany people within the corridors of power know about his work. It was neverentirely clear how, in a matter of weeks, he came to the attention of theDirector of Naval Intelligence, the Director of Military Intelligence, a leadinginternational financier then working in subversion and, if his claims are to bebelieved, His Britannic Majesty’s Foreign Secretary in the company of theSpanish ambassador.But somehow he did and, so he sincerely claimed, they were interested in what hewould have to tell them about ‘where the next attack would come from’. With theonset of autumn, the immediate threat of invasion receded (temporarily atleast), which meant that nothing remained beyond the realms of possibility.Strange as it may seem to posterity, the Hungarian émigré was no longer beingfobbed off by various branches of intelligence.Or rather that was how he chose to recall what happened.The stars, he was at pains to point out, did not foretell an invasion ofBritain.The first grand opportunity for an island invasion would come a year later, heclaimed. When Crete was subsequently invaded the following May, de Wohl tookcredit for having seen Hitler’s only air, sea and land invasion of the war. And,without the astrologer ever knowing it, Admiral Räder had actually suggested theBritish landing be put back until May 1941, to allow for a wider front for theattack. When de Wohl subsequently announced the first grand opportunity for aninvasion of southern England that same month, there was much scepticism withinofficial circles. By then, given some of his more obvious eccentricities, Louisde Wohl’s MI5 handlers would note, with classic understatement, that he wouldneed ‘careful and tactful handling’.images [images/icon.jpg]While most of Louis de Wohl’s claims about the interest of various branches ofBritish military intelligence in astrology cannot be taken at face value, it isa matter of record that six months earlier – in late March 1940 – the Hungarianhad been, in every sense of the word, a star attraction at the annual meeting ofBritish astrologers in Harrogate. In view of the claims which he would makeexactly a year later (in March 1941, he would completely contradict his earlierviews) it is worth noting what he was quoted as saying at the time.‘Astrology can be poison of the worst type in the wrong hands,’ Louis de Wohlpublicly declared to the press. And, for good measure, he added that anyone whoused the stars to predict death was nothing less than a criminal. At that samemeeting, another astrologer, Charles Carter, was noting that there was already awidespread belief in astrological circles that Hitler was being advised byastrologers: ‘He would scarcely have made war with his own horoscope in such anunfortunate condition.’This, too, was echoed in Louis de Wohl’s later fanciful account, where it wasclear ‘that Jupiter was in conjunction with his Sun’ so the Führer would invadeWestern Europe in May 1940. Behind the scenes, the records show that three weeksearlier the Services Consultative Committee – a War Office ‘think tank’ aimingto think outside the box – had also noted that a large number of Germans weresuperstitious and that ‘it is believed that a good deal of interest is taken inastrology. There was a rumour that Hitler himself believes in astrology, and hademployed the services of an astrologer.’The committee suggested that they should obtain from a well-known astrologer ahoroscope of Hitler, predicting disaster for him and his country and putting itinto Germany by secret channels. This, certainly, was the general approach whichNaval Intelligence eventually took in this rarefied form of psychologicalwarfare. From the outset, though, it was recognised that each astrologer wouldcome up with a different answer: the result, therefore, was to work out whoseprediction would be the most useful for propaganda purposes.Fairly quickly, the authorities had zeroed in on the most vociferous.Given some of the security scares emanating from the Spanish Embassy in August1940, of fellow travellers and agents of undue influence, perhaps it is strangerstill that Louis de Wohl was invited for dinner there, where he was introducedto Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary.Or this, at least, is the astrologer’s claim.In his version of the story, Louis de Wohl was intrigued to meet such a grandee.The various attendees were enthralled as the Hungarian émigré told some of hisstories. They sat in a semi-circle of chairs over port and cigars as theastrologer spoke for an hour. According to the spate of near contemporaryreports which he had been issuing at the time, de Wohl explained that Hitler’sadvisers had told him his aspects were bad until November. ‘I explained all thisto Lord Halifax, then his Majesty’s Foreign Secretary at the Spanish Embassy onthe 28th August 1940,’ he later claimed.1Louis de Wohl had come into the orbit of such influential people thanks to theRomanian ambassador, V.V. Tilea, who had taken it upon himself to introduce theastrologer to various influential people. A society hostess had introduced himto the Duke of Alba, the Spanish ambassador, and things moved very quickly afterthat. In his memoirs, de Wohl believes that Lord Halifax was instrumental inopening doors for him behind the scenes. Six days before the meeting, hislordship had apparently written to him to suggest he come along for a chat. Evenso, the Hungarian was self-aware enough to realise that it would be hard to findsomeone with his skills a berth.‘The very idea that one fine day a member of the House of Commons might get upand ask whether it was true that His Majesty’s Government was employing astargazer, made many of my new friends shudder,’ he recalled. Yet some unlikelychampions were listening. To say that Louis de Wohl was tickled pink by AdmiralGodfrey’s interest in his work is an obvious understatement. It gave him acertain cachet and, indeed, credibility which had been lacking in his efforts todate. By the end of the year, his cup overruneth: the Hungarian was beingregularly consulted by Naval Intelligence, the War Office and, shortly, by hismost amused and assured patron in the fledgling political warfare establishment,Sefton Delmer.images [images/icon.jpg]Never one to hide his star-crossed lights under any inconvenient bushels oftruth, Louis de Wohl always claimed that the admiralty became interested in hiswork because of the startling accuracy of his predictions.The truth is slightly different.Naval Intelligence files show that in September 1940, Louis de Wohl had sent anote to the DNI called ‘The Astrological Tendencies of Herr Hitler’s horoscope’,in which he claimed that the Führer had waited until April 1940 to invadeDenmark and Norway as he preferred to begin action under a new moon. Hitler’scurrent aspects, which de Wohl claimed would ‘influence the Führer for the nextsix months’, contained the curious observation that 15 September 1940 was anominous date for Adolf Hitler. ‘On that day,’ a note on the file says, ‘185German aeroplanes were brought down over southern England.’Suitably amended, the astrologer suggested many of these prognostications couldbe forwarded along the chain of command. As Admiral Godfrey later noted, ‘thesignificance of Hitler’s astrological researches was not whether they werepredictive of the truth but that Hitler believed in them.’ And so on Tuesday, 1October 1940, Admiral John Godfrey minuted his immediate superiors (the FirstSea Lord, Vice Chief and First Lord of the Admiralty) about the possible uses ofastrology. They doubtless wondered if the steely martinet who was theirintelligence chief had somehow taken leave of his senses. Trying to ‘sell’ hisnew idea to his superiors, Godfrey stressed this approach was unusual but ifcarried out in the spirit in which it was intended, would result in significantstrategic advantages.The study, Godfrey advised, would analyse ‘the horoscopes of [Hitler’s]principal advisers, Generals, Admirals and of the Statesmen, such as Mussolini,with whom he has had dealings’. The Director of Naval Intelligence took care toacknowledge that ‘the formation of a group of sincere astrologers prepared towork on these subjects is by no means a fantastic idea’. He added a ten-page‘explanatory note’ that had been written by de Wohl and explained that AdolfHitler had, for quite some time, had his own penchant for astrologers. Giventhat astrology was supposedly an ‘exact science’, then all reputable astrologerswould come to roughly the same conclusions.‘This being so,’ Godfrey added, ‘it is not a science which lends itself todeception as in astrological circles the deception would soon be bowled out.’The DNI insisted that the notions which were being fed to Hitler would bechecked by reputable astrologers. As ever, the name of Karl Krafft was given asthis mysterious, behind-the-scenes influence on the German leader.Doubtless Admiral Godfrey’s superiors wondered if something had beenaccidentally slipped into their coffee when they read the full memorandum thatautumn. Certainly, their lordships were bleakly unimpressed. The Vice Chief ofthe Naval Staff replied – somewhat tongue-in-cheek, one cannot help fromthinking – that if such studies were carried out, ‘we might have a newdepartment of NID’. Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord under whom he had served,thought the proposal ‘interesting’, but that he would want the admiralty to baseits appreciations on ‘something more solid than horoscopes’.Yet the story did not end there. By October 1940, even the Joint IntelligenceCommittee set up to provide one coherent source of information collated from allsecret services was considering the need to consult the stars to predict theinvasion. For the period beginning 19 October, its minutes note: ‘The moon andtides were suitable, the incidence of fog likely, and Hitler’s horoscope, a signto which he was reported to pay considerable attention, was favourable duringthis period.’They were not alone. Another peculiar form of insurance was available.Louis de Wohl’s guesses were as good as anybody else’s. Within weeks, CommanderEwen Montagu and Admiral Godfrey’s secretary in Room 39 carried out the task offinding the most amenable of seers. ‘So Ted Merrett and I were sent round to avast number of astrologers,’ Montagu recorded. ‘The results were veryentertaining but useless.’As Montagu reflected, it might have worked.The denouement was something none of them could predict. It seems that one oftheir Naval Intelligence colleagues became rather too zealous in his interest inthe subject, and ultimately this unspecified gentleman, in Montagu’s understatedphrase, ‘was speedily posted a few thousand miles away from London when it wasdiscovered that he was actually beginning to believe in astrology’.images [images/icon.jpg]The full figure, ‘dressed in a splendid officer’s uniform’ in one recollection,‘complete with a Sam Browne, an expensive leather-covered cane [and] an enormousbeautifully tailored greatcoat’, was a sight that very few of His Majesty’ssecret servants would ever forget. Yet in those ominous autumnal days of 1940,Louis de Wohl was oblivious to any and all brickbats that swarmed, like so manymeteors attracted by his bulky frame. Louis de Wohl didn’t care; recruited, sohe claimed, by a government which, by his own account, was so grateful it madehim ‘a British officer with the rank of Captain’. Indeed, his autobiographicalThe Stars of War and Peace carried a frontispiece showing ‘Captain’ Louis deWohl decked out in just such a uniform. By September 1940, de Wohl claims, hehad formed the ‘Psychological Research Bureau’, which was based at GrosvenorHouse, Park Lane, ostensibly, he claims, to look at the psychology surroundingHitler’s men.2What does sound suspiciously like a typical piece of his self-aggrandisingbraggadocio is actually more interesting. Bizarrely enough, it even has a ringof truth. The Special Operations Executive – then more interested in performingsmall-scale hand-to-hand combat with its political rivals than enemy forces inOccupied Europe – did indeed put de Wohl on its payroll. It underwrote hisexpenses in moving from the Esplanade Hotel to a block of unfurnished suitesattached to Grosvenor House, where he set up shop.Sir Charles Hambro, scion of another illustrious banking family and then adirector of SOE, seems to have been the first to recognise the Hungarian’s valuein ‘black’ psychological operations. In Sir Charles’s eyes, Louis de Wohl coulddo no wrong. As the acerbic former codebreaker Leo Marks recorded, Hambro wasknown by his Baker Street Irregulars as CD, ‘a tiny symbol to embrace so vast aman’. Ironically, the codebreaker was a near neighbour of the boss and had anexcellent view of his bathroom. ‘We frequently had the privilege of watching theoversized banker wedged in his undersized bath,’ he later recalled.Thanks to the release of the astrologer’s files, the full story of hisrecruitment and the granting of his right can now be told. ‘De Wohl was employedpersonally by Sir Charles Hambro to work for SOE,’ a note for MI5 records overtwo years later:In the fullness of his wisdom, Hambro arranged that he would become Captain. Onde Wohl enquiring when he would be sworn in I gathered that a ceremony [was]staged at Horse Guards in which Brigadier Gubbins swore him in, following thewording of an ordinary recruit’s Attestation Form. Even apart from this farce,de Wohl had every reason to believe, and still believes, that he is a Captain inthe British Army. Indeed, as he has never been told he is not, I presumetechnically he is still, in fact.images [images/icon.jpg]Many of the exact details of Louis de Wohl’s early contacts with other branchesof British Intelligence remain sketchy because of a firestorm that took place ina prison in West London. For those who regularly took the Number 12 bus fromcentral London in the autumn of 1940, they soon became used to upper-class‘gels’ – invariably pretty ones, often giggling and walking off together –travelling all the way to that particular route’s terminal stage outsideWormwood Scrubs. If it struck anybody as odd that such a ravishing array of debsand ‘twinsets and pearls’, as they were later termed, were spending theirworking days in a prison, nobody said.In wartime, many secrets were compromised by self-evident absurdities.In time, even the conductors were emboldened to shout ‘All change for MI5’ whenthe Number 12 bus reached the end of the line. Because of fear of bombing ofCentral London, most of the Security Service had been moved lock stock andbarrel to the spectacularly inappropriate surroundings of the Scrubs. It hadbeen a chaotic move, not least with the firing of General Kell at the start ofthe summer. Many of the women who worked for the agency as secretaries (and asnoted earlier, all from ‘top drawer’ backgrounds) found some consolation thatduring the extended good weather that summer of 1940 they had could sunbathe onthe scrubland outside.As the headquarters of a security service, the prison was distinctly lacking.Working in the former cells, there were never enough telephones and each doorhad to be opened from the outside. When the Signal Corps came to rectify thesituation, they left behind a spaghetti of wires that dangled dangerously onfloors and landings. Many MI5 staff were accidentally locked in their cells andhad to wait until someone came to see what had happened to them. Four-foot-thickwalls meant that not only were cries for help unheard, but conditions within thecells were either too hot or too cold depending on the outside weather.On the evening of Thursday, 3 October, 1940, things became even more unbearable.An incendiary bomb landed and burnt off most of the roof of C Wing. With an evenmore curious irony, this was where the famed MI5 Registry had been located. Thatmeant that thousands of personal files on suspected agents, saboteurs andne’er-do-wells literally went up in smoke. Though some had been photographed asa precaution, many of the results were over-exposed. Indeed, General Kell had sobalked at the huge cost of copying the files (£4,000) that he had decided thewhole process was too expensive.3Though the Blitz continued, many within the Security Service felt that thechanges since the firing of General Kell were not for the better. Behind thescenes, an unholy jockeying for power was taking place and another recruit tothe service, who delighted in wordplay and doggerel, would pen a suitable dittyto record the fact:What of the gaol, now cleared of scrubscious youth?At once there occupies its cells and towersA corps of para-military sleuthsWhose devious minds divide the working hourBetween re-numbering their divisionsAnd making even more obscure decisions.That reference to renumbering may seem obscure, but what prompted it was theroot-and-branch reform, particularly within B Division, which dealt withcounter-espionage. And that included a former leading light whose star was nowwaning as much as those which guided Louis de Wohl were clearly in theascendant.On the face of it, 1940 should have been a good year for Max Knight.His work had helped uncover many agents in various organisations whosesympathies were quite suspect. These included members of the Right Club, afascist organisation, and the American Tyler Kent, who worked as a code clerk atthe US Embassy. Yet Max Knight’s autonomy was starting to cause concern, notleast his uncanny ability to get up people’s noses and his inattention todetail. Worse, he had usurped his authority and provided false information in acase that reached the High Court. Even today, the details of how one of hiscontacts essentially perjured himself by creating false evidence, remainsunclear.What resulted was a dreadful mystery – of the gothic and overwrought variety inwhich he specialised – and shows just how far Maxwell Knight would go to get hisman. The object was a misguided pacifist called Ben Greene, who in retrospectwas a harmless, gentle giant of a man. Friedle Gärtner was involved too and,watching aghast, MI5 management took against him. His career suffered and Knightleft London, banished to a house in Camberley, where, with his marriage to Loislong finished, he turned his attention to his menagerie. Pride of place was acuckoo called Goo. It was obvious why such birds appealed to him: they were bothsubversive – infiltrating their eggs into other birds’ nests – and ruthless inevicting the original occupants. By the end of the war, Knight’scounter-subversion department was disbanded and he left the agency if not indisgrace, then certainly with an appropriate wing down.images [images/icon.jpg]If there was one issue which would come to perplex, annoy and exercise virtuallyall the participants in the secret world with whom he ever came into contact, itwas Louis de Wohl’s psychological need to wear his ornate captain’s outfit. ‘Heis an exceedingly vain man,’ MI5 noted sourly for the files, ‘with all theGermans’ love of uniform and rank.’ Indeed, the astrologer’s continued bleatingabout his military garb was just one manifestation of his incessant demands thatsoon started to alienate his handlers. Louis de Wohl never seemed to appreciatethat his commission as a captain appears to have been a ploy to get him offtheir backs. ‘I cannot give you anything in writing as it’s much too secret,’one senior official had told him, ‘and of course, you cannot use the rank.’But this didn’t stop Louis de Wohl getting his own captain’s uniform made up.One friend who knew him well thought that he was like a little boy who had justreceived his Christmas presents early. ‘He stood up, he sat down, stood upagain, walked around the room and looked into a large mirror in silentadmiration,’ Dr Felix Jay recalled when he happened to have visited him when hewas trying out his uniform.At least now, by the autumn of 1940, his dealings with the various intelligenceagencies had been streamlined. Louis de Wohl would now be handled by a hale,well met kind of fellow with whom he felt some kinship for being a fellowscribe. Now in his early 50s, Major Gilbert Lennox had achieved some pre-warsuccess as a playwright after retiring early from the Indian Army. In his roleas a military liaison officer with the Security Service, at times he no doubtfelt that he was now starring in a bizarre cross between a drawing room comedyand farce.As a foreign national, there were many in London who wondered if it wouldn’tjust be simpler to intern Louis de Wohl as an enemy alien. That September, theIron Guard, a far-right movement that regularly employed death squads, forcedKing Carol to abdicate. As a result, Romania became aligned with the ThirdReich, enacted stricter anti-Semitic laws and, almost inevitably, unleashed areign of terror.As a precaution, over the next few weeks in Britain, many Romanians wereinterned. That same month, MI5 vouched for Louis de Wohl’s character, findingthere was nothing to justify adding him to the Hungarian blacklist. Nor did theagency have any objection to his naturalisation as a British citizen. Over thenext few years, as he came to exasperate his handler, internment hung uneasilyas a possible solution to Louis de Wohl’s various antics. But Gilbert Lennoxalways considered it would be a gross miscarriage of justice to intern theHungarian astrologer. ‘After all, he seemed to have done a good job of work, andas far as I know, there have been no complaints,’ Lennox would write. ‘If, onthe other hand he is just dropped, I think the situation would be verydifferent.’For Louis de Wohl personally, the fate of Romania would come to have greaterimpact in his dealings with V.V. Tilea, the ambassador who had acted as hissocial secretary in the early part of the war. According to the astrologer, ‘No4’ (a name that sounds suspiciously like a SPECTRE henchman in an early Bondfilm but was in fact one of Sir Charles Hambro’s liaison officers at the SOE)had asked him outright whether he and Tilea were thinking of going back to theirown country ‘or break with their government and stay here’.They both decided to stay. It was also clear that if it was announced thatAmbassador Tilea had ‘defected’, it would certainly help in undermining both theGerman and Romanian governments. Such an act – which followed a few days later –revealed, as Louis de Wohl noted, that ‘the atmosphere’ in London was that therewould definitely be a British victory in the end’.Thanks to such public displays of loyalty, it was agreed that after five yearsin the country his British citizenship should be expedited. And accompanyingthis, the files also show that the astrologer thought he should be entitled toyet another strange sartorial recognition. ‘I am only sorry that Louis’s ownheart’s desire of giving him a commission and appointing him to a Highlandregiment cannot be granted,’ Gilbert Lennox noted. ‘The sight of Louis in fullHighland dress would have been the most cheering spectacle.’Curiously, around this time the astrologer came into contact with an officer ofgenuine Scottish origins, a subtle and clever official in yet another branch ofmilitary intelligence. The only thing regimental about him, as one of hisadmiring subordinates put it, ‘were his tartan trews’ and soon, like manyothers, he wondered quite what the curious Hungarian astrologer was trying toachieve.images [images/icon.jpg]By now, to his obvious delight, Louis de Wohl was pushing at an open door.Others in Whitehall were also being sent examples of his work, and for onebranch of the War Office it was an element of faith that any insight – no matterhow obscure or surreal – could help face off the enemy. MI14, the branch ofmilitary intelligence that was trying to understand the German military’sstrategic intentions, was headed by the former assistant military attaché toBerlin. When Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Strong had returned to the War Office inthe spring of 1940 to head up this new department, he was looking forward to it.Fairly quickly, he was astounded to find just three officers assigned to him andthey were soon overwhelmed as problems showered down all around them. Their taskwas gigantic, not least after the fall of France, when the German Army tended touse landlines. That meant they could no longer assess the strengths anddeployments of the enemy across the water from monitoring telltale radiotransmissions.But Strong could tune into the German mindset – and that was important.Like so many others, the pre-war assistant military attaché’s voice had been onein the wilderness. By talking to his opposite numbers in Berlin, he got aglimpse of how blitzkrieg would be unleashed. ‘You need three British battalionsto equal one German one,’ he would say. ‘When will people learn this?’In later years, it was always said that Kenneth Strong’s department was set upto read the mind of Adolf Hitler. The man himself always denied this. ‘The ideaof having a group of people put itself in the place of the enemy is an idea[that] is constantly recurring and dies slowly,’ he remarked. In other words,such an aim was wishful thinking. Yet, despite this, as The Times noted at thetime of his death in 1982, under Strong’s guidance, MI14 ‘produced a brilliantand accurate picture of the complicated order of battle and the Reichswehr andof the intentions of the German High Command’. Unlike much of the pre-war MI6 CXmaterial, it was said that his reports from Berlin were so impressive that theyhad persuaded Chamberlain to introduce conscription.The only son of a rector of the Montrose Academy, Strong lived up to the promiseof his surname in terms of his mental agility. After Sandhurst, he had beenappointed defence security officer in both Malta and Gibraltar, and afterreturning to London was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Thanks to his attentionto detail, MI14 very quickly became renowned for the accuracy of its analyses.Lieutenant Colonel Strong’s rise thereafter was meteoric and he would end thewar as General Eisenhower’s senior military intelligence adviser. The AlliedSupreme Commander, like many others, appreciated Kenneth Strong’sclear-headedness in times of turmoil.‘He looked like a beaver,’ the later principal of University College London NoelAnnan, who worked with him in 1940, would fondly recall, ‘an eager beaverbursting [out] of his uniform, with dark hair, a fine forehead, clever, shiftyeyes and so chinless that he came to be known as the hangman’s dilemma.’Strong’s section soon established a reputation for what today would be known asthinking outside the box.Nothing was beyond the remit of ‘The German Section’ and that came to includethe consultation of a water diviner whom Strong christened ‘Smoky Joe’. Therewas also a disturbing incident with a man – who was thankfully, well meaning –who had escaped from a mental asylum and somehow managed to find himself in thelieutenant colonel’s office in Whitehall. ‘As always at such times we found wewere plagued by all sorts of people,’ Kenneth Strong later wrote of that fatefulsummer of 1940. ‘Some of the cranks who felt they had a definite contribution tomake to winning the war.’Amongst their number, almost inevitably, was Louis de Wohl.The Hungarian astrologer had continued to send his various assessments on Germangenerals and admirals to anyone who might care to read them. Gilbert Lennoxnoted approvingly that this would keep his otherwise ‘idle hands occupied – orrather his brain’. That was one way of putting it. When Kenneth Strong came tomeet the astrologer in person, he was too diplomatic to say what he reallythought. Though told his work was invaluable to the war effort, in his memoirsStrong never mentioned the astrologer by name but was in no doubt about hisusefulness. ‘I never discovered the slightest justification for paying heed tothis gentleman,’ he lamented, ‘but I was overruled and the astrologer continuedto receive support and to live in a comfortable flat in a fashionable Londondistrict.’images [images/icon.jpg]At this stage, it is as well to consider some of the weirder and more wonderfulviews of those at the top – then, and in more recent years – for all leaders setgreat store by prescience. That partly explains the devouring of secretintelligence by politicians, but also other forms of information. In someaccounts, Winston Churchill’s own superstitions had led to his consulting aclairvoyant called Reginald Hickling in the Great War as well as a psychicAmerican, Shirley Carson. Sir Stafford Cripps, Churchill’s wartime ambassador toStalin’s Soviet Union, was a devout Christian who believed in what a laterministerial colleague called ‘mumbo jumbo’.Despite Kenneth Strong’s scepticism, there were those in the military who setgreat store in the supernatural. Lord Dowding, who had directed Fighter Commandduring the Battle of Britain, believed in elves. His opposite number in BomberCommand, Air Chief Marshal Harris, sometimes consulted Lyndoe, The Peoplenewspaper’s astrologer, to determine the best time to carry out raids onGermany.4In more recent times, astrologers have taken up their place in the corridors ofpower. In 1997, the French were stunned to learn that their recently departedpresident, François Mitterand, had consulted an astrologer during importantdecisions. Elisabeth Teissier had, it seemed, predicted the fall of the BerlinWall as well as another international crisis which revealed, so far as she wasconcerned, that history seemed to be repeating itself thanks to a leader ‘withthe same astrological cocktail as Hitler – a Taurus with Libra ascendant’. Thiswas Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. There was also asurprising lack of Gallic gallantry in some of the other whispers thatsurrounded Mme Teissier’s work with the late president of the Republic: ‘I actedas his adviser and nothing more,’ the astrologer imperiously declared. ‘It’sdreadful what some people have been saying.’But far more notorious was the interest in the stars of a First Lady.As the former chief of staff to the Reagan White House, Don Regan, famouslyrecorded in his memoirs while the president was still in power, every majordecision ‘was cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco who drew uphoroscopes’. Joan Quigley, who died in October 2014, confirmed her role despitefurious denials from the Reagans at the time. Quigley claimed she wasresponsible for the timing of all press conferences, speeches (including theState of the Union address) and when Air Force One took off. ‘I picked the timeof Ronald Reagan’s debate with [Jimmy] Carter and the two debates with WalterMondale,’ she later told one interviewer, ‘all extended trips abroad as well asthe shorter trips and one-day excursions.’Intriguingly, she always maintained that Ronald Reagan’s horoscope wasbrilliant. ‘His stars are very lucky for a country,’ she told the WashingtonPost in 1988, explaining that what she did was ‘technical work, not crystal ballgazing’. A columnist on that same paper had noted in the forties that VicePresident Wallace, who served under FDR for a term, was ‘a stargazer of manycults’.Other significant political events seem to have been triggered by the heavenlyrunes. As the journalist Woodrow Wyatt noted, when the post-war decision toformally separate Pakistan from India was made, astrologers were consulted. Thenworking as a civil servant, Wyatt recalls that one particular day in August 1947was chosen thanks to the stars to keep both sides happy. ‘So Pakistan began itsindependence in the morning and India in the middle of the night,’ he laterwrote.Various intelligence agencies in the Cold War were mindful of the stars.According to the late Miles Copeland, father of rock drummer Stewart and aformer high-ranking officer of the Central Intelligence Agency, agents wereplanted on Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Sukarno of Indonesia and Mehmet Shehu ofAlbania in the sixties who were well versed in astrological techniques. InFebruary 1966, Nkrumah was visiting China – the timing having been promptedthanks to a horoscope – when a military coup deposed him (which, with a certainsymbolism, had been engineered by the CIA). Around the same time, Sukarno washanded a doctored chart, which the CIA’s ‘Cosmic Operations Section’ (whichCopeland headed) used to help predict his movements. A month after the Ghaniancoup, the Indonesian leader was also deposed thanks to machinations that hadbeen engineered by both the CIA and MI6.A few years earlier, in Copeland’s account, when the Director of CentralIntelligence, Allen Dulles, learned that these doctored charts were being used(‘bootlegging certain charts to certain members of our own White House staff’was how Copeland recalled it) outside normal channels, it was stopped. At aroundthe same time, according to the Bulletin of the Federation of AmericanAstrologers, the Kremlin had reinstated one Yuri Yamakkin, an astrologer whoseown fortunes rose and fell after having failed to warn of the US reaction to theKorean War. Stalin sent him to the Vorkuta gulag, but according to this accounthe was rehabilitated by Khruschev, to allow the Praesidium to study ‘themovements of the Red Star in the heavens’, as one newspaper account concluded.images [images/icon.jpg]At the start of 1941, Louis de Wohl began sending what he classed as ‘elaborateastrological analysis, month by month’ to Kenneth Strong’s department, MI14.Their value can be gauged from an anonymous comment in the margins of therelevant file in the UK National Archives: ‘Of no value – one of MI’s strangersidelines … all 1940/1941 vintage, I think.’It is also equally obvious that nobody quite had the heart to tell de Wohl thathis work was more or less irrelevant. Following on from his earlier reports toNaval Intelligence, de Wohl had already submitted one report on the astrological‘aspects’ which had been influencing the Führer’s more recent decisions.According to de Wohl, Adolf Hitler would be ‘lucky’ from the end of October 1940‘until the end of the first week of March’. It was then, in the spring of 1941,that the runes suggested there would be a grand opportunity for an islandinvasion.When Crete was subsequently taken by the Wehrmacht, de Wohl took credit for theaccuracy and acuity of his work. But now, at the end of January 1941, came hispièce de resistance, a series of predictions about the various leaders(political and military) on both sides of the fighting. For the most part, Louisde Wohl’s self-proclaimed psychological pen portraits are sometimesunintentionally hilarious. The astrologer drew up a table with the kind ofinformation which he believed would be exactly the same as that being given toAdolf Hitler by Herr Krafft. Again, the Hungarian took care to note thesignificant observation that Adolf ‘has never undertaken a major action unlesshe had “good aspects” at that time’. As a result, the Führer’s ‘luck’ was beingordained by the stars.From March 1941 up to the middle of May 1941, ‘Hitler’s aspects are bad. So areGöring’s, except for a short period from April 30th. So are Admiral Räder’s. Theaspects of Keitel and von Brauchistsch [sic] are not too good.’ By comparisonthere were ‘excellent aspects’ in British leaders, but the strangest aspect ofthe Hungarian’s report was to recommend a combined ‘naval and military’ actionagainst Germany’s military ports. It would give the Führer the shock of hislife, ‘to see British uniforms appearing on German soil’.Not everybody was convinced by de Wohl’s psychic powers – to create, as he sawit, a storm of occultic vengeance – though they were obviously happy to hearthat it was clear ‘that Germany would be defeated’.To many, the subject of stargazing seemed like so much nonsense. Around thistime, the first condemnations of Louis de Wohl as a charlatan appear. WhenColonel Lennox referred some of the astrologer’s predictions to Dick White, therising head of counter-intelligence within the Security Service, he noted: ‘Idon’t like decisions of this kind made by reference to the stars rather thanMI5.’Louis de Wohl remained indefatigable.His next suggestion, even by his standards, was equally peculiar and came fromhis own background as a dramatist within the movies. He suggested that a film onthe Anti-Christ be made via the Christian League, where parallels with a certainAustrian-born dictator would commend themselves. For that, there should also bean equally weird tie-in with branding and artefacts.‘There should be a symbol, equivalent to “the mark of the beast” (theswastika),’ he suggested, to market the film. Louis de Wohl suggested this realcross, of metal and of artistic design, ‘to be worn in the same way decorationsare worn, but also in the form of tie-pins, brooches etc.’ As well as fundingand producing the film, the Christian League should also produce a specialbrochure of about ten to twelve pages. ‘This should be printed in this countryas well as in the United States,’ de Wohl suggested. ‘I shall be delighted tocomplete it and I consider it a grand task.’images [images/icon.jpg]Only Dusko Popov might ever be introduced in person by the chief of the BritishSecret Service to a striptease artist with whom he would almost inevitably havean affair. In those first few weeks of 1941, the charming Yugoslav had fallen –not for the last time – desperately in love with his latest inamorata.Appropriately housed at the Savoy, his handlers had asked him how he wanted tospend his first New Year’s Eve in England. Entirely characteristically, Duskohad replied he wanted the company of either a good book or a temperamentalpopsy.At a Georgian mansion in the Home Counties he would shortly find both inabundance within a library and drawing room. To his utter delight, the womenwere as decorative as the expensive chandeliers and ostentatious ornaments. Herewas, exactly as his Abwehr handlers suggested, a suitable entrée into the upperechelons of society courtesy of Sir Stewart Menzies. Little Bridley in Surreywas home to C’s mother, Lady Holford, who in the years between the wars hadbecome a noted hostess.As a lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary, she still mixed in exalted circles.It had struck her son that here was a golden opportunity for the latest recruitto the ‘great game’ to join such a grand set to see in the new year. Sir StewartMenzies had met Dusko a few days earlier in the bar at White’s Club, where, C’scritics always complained, he spent far too much time. Menzies suggested Duskocome along to his mother’s, not least because he suspected he would enjoymeeting two of the most beautiful women in the country. Early that Tuesdayevening in the drawing room at Little Bridley, Dusko was introduced to SirStewart’s brother, Ian, and his Austrian-born wife, Lisle.Next to her was her sister, described by Popov’s most recent biographer as ‘asinger who regularly appeared in cabaret in London nightclubs’. Actually,Friedle Gärtner was something more: whilst MI5 officers later called her a‘super high class mannequin’ who had the mentality ‘of a night club hostess’,others considered her little more than a glorified stripper. It was somethingwhich even Max Knight had not mentioned in his own files when she had gone towork for Dennis Wheatley.Popov was immediately hooked: women and wealth were his abiding wartimepassions. As he related, he found her manner, at first, puzzling. So engrossedwas he in her beauty, he had to be taken away from her by C himself. ‘I thinkyou will have many opportunities to see her,’ the chief of MI6 said, knowingfull well what the service had in store for him.They then retired to a drawing room where Sir Stewart Menzies got the measure ofhis latest recruit. If Dusko’s account is to be believed, the conversationsmacks of James Bond, for not even the chief of MI6 in the comfy confines of aclub-like atmosphere would bandy around secrets. But it was clear the country’sleading spymaster drew the Yugoslav into his confidence, despite one or tworeservations.‘You have too many devices on your banner for my taste,’ Sir Stewart told him.‘You have the makings of a very good spy except that you don’t like to obeyorders. You had better learn or you will be a very dead spy.’images [images/icon.jpg]After her various escapades helping Dennis Wheatley and Maxwell Knight, FriedleGärtner would now devote her considerable energies towards Dusko Popov. Shewould be used ‘to simply entertain him and keep him out of trouble’ in thestrait-laced words of one security review. Perhaps she took the ‘entertaining’part a shade too literally in view of what transpired. Nevertheless, FriedleGärtner became Dusko Popov’s first recruit in what he subsequently claimed tohis German controllers in Lisbon was a network of spies in the making. Friedlewould be used to send purposefully confusing pictures about the politicalsituation in Britain. As she still had family in Germany, it added to her bonafides that her motivation was to ensure that no harm would to come to them.When Dusko was told that Friedle would be taking part in this real-life game ofcharades, his handler Billy Luke smiled salaciously. ‘Congratulations,’ he said.‘You got yourself the most beautiful social mistress in London.’Friedle provided perfect cover. It was entirely natural that she would be ableto take him to all the best homes in the land. Luke added that she wasn’t reallya member of the ‘old firm’. ‘Does an odd chore for us now and then,’ he said. Tothe Germans, Dusko explained she had introduced him to the cream of society.And, as he further elaborated, she ‘specialised in using her social contacts togather political news and secrets and information about new army commands,nominations and the like’.Yet beneath the beguiling beauty was the omnipresent lure of danger which addeda frisson to their burgeoning relationship. It was a dangerous addiction asDusko followed her around the various parties ‘like a goggle-eyed fish who seesnothing but the bait’. Their passion was consummated early in the new year of1941 when she answered her front door dressed in a short terry-cloth robe, withher blonde hair still freshly wet. As Dusko noted, after spending the rest ofthe day in bed they became more than a team. Given the codename Tricycle5 byMI5, Dusko Popov would set up a highly placed network of agents in Britain forthe Abwehr which was under complete British control.Given the peripatetic nature of his import/export business, Dusko did have goodenough reasons to visit London regularly. As a result, at the start of 1941 hewas able to begin an important collaboration with Naval Intelligence and theNID’s point man who had investigated so many of the country’s astrologers. Now,as the Right Honourable Ewen Montagu would later note, he ‘fell under the spellof [Dusko’s] personality, his sincerity, his gaiety and his courage’. Together,they created one of the most important naval deceptions of the Second World Warto stand off the omnipresent threat of invasion.In some ways, Commander Montagu was the very epitome of the Establishment. Theeldest son of Lord Swaythling and thus an heir to great monetary fortune, he hadstudied law at both Harvard and Trinity College, Cambridge. Small wonder thathis finely honed legal skills smelled a rat. Aware of how ridiculously theAbwehr seemed to react, Montagu soon started to wonder if they were not beingtaken in by some sort of elaborate deception operation.‘As the war progressed,’ he would later write, ‘no degree of incompetence by theGermans surprised us.’Doubtless puffing on his pipe one day as he read through the first questionnairethe Abwehr had provided Dusko, he noticed something remarkable: that it lookedas though the invasion of Britain had been delayed (but as Montagu noted ‘therewas no real evidence that it had been abandoned for good’). When it did happen,from the questions Dusko had been provided with, it appeared as though theKriegsmarine would make its way through the East Coast minefields that had beenset up.Montagu provided a suitably doctored chart – that would raise no suspicions fromaircraft patrols or the monitoring of routes of fishing trawlers – which would,as he later explained, ‘encourage as many German ships as possible to steer intothe east coast mine barriers’. This would be handed over to his handlers thenext time Dusko returned to Portugal. But for this ruse to work, they would needa plausible explanation as to how the information had been obtained.‘An English barrister, a naval reserve officer who happens to be a Jew, isscared stiff that the Germans will win the war,’ Montagu later explained to hisagent. ‘He’s heard horrible tales about concentration camps and death ovens andwants to take out some insurance.’Yet for all this ingenuity, Dusko expressed disbelief that such a personexisted.‘Sorry, I thought you understood,’ his naval handler said quietly. ‘His name isEwen Montagu.’images [images/icon.jpg]Astrology, for all the lure and promise of seeing into the future, alwaysremained a double-edged weapon. The flipside to manipulating the German mind viathe stars was that the cottage industry of newspaper horoscopes in Britain couldalso accidentally make predictions which would be too close to the bone (andreveal secrets) or else undermine morale from its sheer and utter pessimism.When, in the spring of 1941, the head of MI5’s counter-espionage section learnedabout the employment of Louis de Wohl, he said that this ‘whole business seemsto me to be highly misleading and dangerous’.Indeed, there was a feeling that horoscopes generally could have a detrimentaleffect on the populace. In July 1941, the Ministry of Information considered thematter in detail. Cooper’s snoopers examined the various astrologicalprognostications which had been made over the previous few months. The ministrystudy found that two-thirds of the adult population read astrology columns. Onlyfour out of ten people gave them any credence while, at most, ‘one in ten, and[those] probably of a neurotic type make astrology a major interest in theirlives and allow it to play some part in forming their conduct’.The report looked at the predictions of Sunday newspaper astrologers andobserved that of the four, none had actually predicted the outbreak of war. Manyhad predicted the recent (and swiftly reversed) British campaign in Libya whilea couple had foreseen the German attack on Russia. By far the most accurate wasR.H. Naylor in the Sunday Express whose column had transformed him into a powerin the land.Richard Harold Naylor had essentially invented the modern horoscope in theSunday Express. By the end of the thirties, a social research organisation hadnoted ‘nearly two-thirds of the adult population glance at or read someastrological feature more or less regularly’. Naylor had correctly foreseen theexplosion of the Hindenburg, as well as the German invasions of Norway, Greeceand Crete. Later in the war, Sir Peter Tennant, the wartime press attaché inStockholm – in reality, the SOE representative there – recalled consulting him.Would Mr Naylor be amenable to tailoring some of his own predictions to help theAllied cause? ‘He was scornful of any suggestion that his art should be debasedin the service of propaganda,’ Sir Peter recalled many years later. ‘And even ifhe did, there would be no joy in it.’Ironically, whispering of another variety would continue against the astrologerwho seemed to be causing a great deal more chaos. That spring of 1941, Naylorhad ‘grassed up’ Louis de Wohl. In this way, MI5 learned that the Hungarian had‘under an atmosphere of great secrecy been publicising a claim that he has beenappointed official astrologer to the British War Office’. As a result, MajorLennox was asked to have ‘a word’ with him and, from the files at least, thereseems to have been no more breaches of security.For now, at any rate.images [images/icon.jpg]They were always newsworthy – as on the occasion three years earlier when it wasreported weather forecasts should be banned – and, as a result, the annualmeeting in Harrogate of British astrologers was a regular fixture of thecalendar in the popular press. A year previously, in March 1940, Louis de Wohlhad related the story of a woman who had been told that she would pass away on acertain date. ‘The men who dare to say such things are criminals,’ he announced.‘It is impossible to predict deaths. We can predict dangers to life but eventhis can be difficult.’And yet now, in the spring of 1941, that was exactly what Louis de Wohl would doabout the Führer himself as part of an ongoing effort to destabilise the ThirdReich. Predictions about Adolf Hitler’s demise now formed part of a greater,more coherent campaign, about which only a handful of secret servants wereaware. Publicly, it provided a coda for the conference; when it concluded, theDaily Mail noted that ‘our astrologers are unanimous that the stars are very badfor Hitler’.At face value, the various prognostications emanating from Harrogate were oftencheery, light-hearted stuff. ‘One thing is certain,’ another Mail columnistnoted, even though he took care to claim astrology was useless, ‘Britain winsthrough to victory with the help of other countries, but fighting the actualbattle on her own.’ On another day, it was reported that Charles Carter, ‘aLondon ARP official’, predicted that he and his fellow astrologers ‘now expectpeace, or the end of actual fighting about December 31 1941’. Another well-knownamateur astrologer, Mr Mauby Cole, predicted ‘a momentous historical event’rather sooner. This would take place, he said, on 11 May due to a majorplanetary conjunction. Ironically, Mr Cole was eventually killed the day beforethat in the last major Luftwaffe raid on London that destroyed most of the Houseof Commons.At the time, it was never clear why all these predictions – especiallyconcerning Hitler’s demise – were rising to a crescendo. This planetaryalignment and the dangers it posed formed the central tenet of a curious articlewritten by a Walter Tschuppik twelve days later in the weekly Die Zeitung, anewspaper almost exclusively read by émigrés. ‘One must remember that theingenious Dr. Goebbels had very quickly realized astrology’s propaganda value,’the author attested a while later, virtually the same words as an hithertosecret document entitled ‘Propaganda: Use of Astrology’.Amazing as it may seem to posterity, they formed the basis of a worldwideconspiracy involving astrologers (many of them unwittingly so) in predicting thedeath of Adolf Hitler. But perhaps the greatest surprise of all was the identityof the person who was manipulating things behind the scenes and had proposed thecampaign in the first place.images [images/icon.jpg]Louis de Wohl always liked to view himself as a virtuoso.That spring of 1941, he had proposed an ‘orchestra of death’ which he wouldconduct to play on Adolf Hitler’s supposed primal fears about dying. It would bethe first ever attempt to ‘psych out’ a foreign leader by use of both politicalwarfare and astrology, thereby affecting the Führer’s ability to make decisions,making him doubt his own intuition and agitating him so badly that he would makethe wrong ones.But it would hardly be an easy task, as the astrologer warned his varioushandlers within the disparate secret services. ‘We are up against a formidableadversary,’ Louis de Wohl began. ‘His personal magnetism is so strong that itsemanations can be felt in all countries of the globe.’Even by the standards of the stories examined in this book, it is one of themost peculiar campaigns ever sanctioned during the Second World War. Yet that isprecisely what took place, with the indefatigable Louis de Wohl manipulating thenews agenda. He wrote on the eve of the astrologers’ conference:I shall undertake as soon as possible to win the collaboration of the BritishAstrologers; Carter, Robson, Glewso, Lyndae, Bailey, Murray, Burnell etc. At theEaster convention of British Astrologers in Harrogate (an assembly of about 300people including 50–60 astrologers, and always visited by the Press), I shal[sic] disclose the sensational news that Hitler’s astrologer himself believes inthe imminent death of the Führer.Oddly, it was clear that such claims would have an appreciative audience.‘Hitler fears death,’ de Wohl noted in his proposal. ‘I know his character wellenough to describe exactly what sort of fear it is.’ The Führer’s ultimatedemise would, de Wohl insisted, be Neptunian, that is ‘mysterious and strange’,something which better describes the astrologer’s own work that spring.Ultimately, the timing would be propitious, for the very Ides of March, when theHarrogate conference had begun, would prompt singular changes in the Germanleader’s luck. From the middle of March 1941 to the middle of May (inretrospect, a crucial time period so far as astrology, misinformation and blackpropaganda are concerned) Adolf Hitler would be enveloped in bad aspects.‘Therefore we must begin to play the symphony of his death in the first week ofMarch and go on playing it for at least ten weeks,’ de Wohl noted. ‘From allparts of the world our instruments must play the melodies of his approachingdeath.’It is clear that the opening notes had been played out at the Harrogateconference. De Wohl confidently announced that Hitler’s astrologer, Karl Krafft,now firmly believed in the leader’s imminent death. ‘By then the orchestra ofHitler’s death should have reached its forte fortissimo in the world,’ he wrote,‘and especially in the United States.’Indeed, Louis de Wohl proposed that on Good Friday, 11 April, mass meetings ofthe ‘Lord deliver us from Hitler’ variety should be encouraged all over theUnion. Lest it seem too ludicrous a proposition, de Wohl helpfully providednames, addresses and details of astrologers all over the world – includingEgypt, India, Ceylon and China – who could play their part. If promoted, itwould mean that Hitler’s death would be commonly anticipated all around theglobe. ‘It is impossible that the whole world speaks of the death of one man,’de Wohl concluded, ‘without this man becoming aware of it. It will haunt him.’images [images/icon.jpg]Louis de Wohl wasn’t the only scribe who was sending reports into various placesin Whitehall in the hope that the high-ups might pay attention. Around thistime, Dennis Wheatley was highly prolific, working up to fourteen or fifteenhours a day. In the spring of 1941, his latest work, Strange Conflict, appeared.‘As long as Britain stands, the Powers of darkness cannot prevail,’ came a pieceof oration from within it. As his biographer has noted, of his eight occulticnovels, seven had a distinct time of propaganda; and as Phil Baker also notes,‘propaganda and magic both involve the manipulation of reality by means of wordsand images’.Strange Conflict was a good read with a familiar theme: that Hitler dabbled inblack magic. ‘I haven’t the least doubt that he does,’ one character says,‘everything that is known about him indicates it.’ As one reviewer said, it wasobvious that Mr Wheatley is perfectly serious and deserves seriousconsideration.Dennis was perfectly serious in his other work. He estimated that he createdhalf a million words for the various ministry officers that same year.Considering them his most satisfying work, they were addressed, so he liked toclaim, to a ‘small select readership of four – King George VI and the Chiefs ofStaff’. Their range and diversity were amazing. Wheatley wrote papers on theimportance of keeping Turkey neutral, maintaining morale within the populationand keeping an endless supply from the US across the Atlantic by the use ofcrude wooden rafts (perhaps explaining why many had what he later acknowledged acomic opera aspect). Intriguingly, in view of the worries about Iberia at thesame time, he suggested swapping Gibraltar for Tangier, for ‘the Rock hasalready lost much of its potency, and looking ahead it is obvious that its daysare numbered’.But more than just writing reports, the bestselling author could play upon hisfame to his best advantage. Dennis Wheatley was not shy in inviting importantpeople out for drinks and dinners to further his wartime career. By the middleof 1941, he was regularly lunching members of the Joint Planning Staff, whoworked closely with Winston Churchill at the heart of the Whitehall war machine.Much as he expected, the writer started to be sounded out for the possibility ofhis joining the secret world. Clearly, being a best-selling author had itsbenefits. Wheatley’s writing skills and fertile imagination could help stamp aunique imprimatur on the covert battles ahead. Lunching provided him with theway of seeing the men at the top; and one paper in particular, ‘After TheBattle’, which looked at what might happen in the future, a notion suggested byWinston Churchill, was well received.‘Whether the war is brought to a conclusion in the spring of 1941,’ heoptimistically concluded, ‘or whether it drags on for several years, there canbe no question about our final victory.’After all the various false starts, around this time the Special OperationsExecutive was starting to get its act together in doing its part to achieve thatgoal. Another high-up also noted that the propagandists were no longer squeamishabout violating peacetime morality involving ‘untruths, deceptions, briberies,forgeries of passports, permits or currencies, acts of violence, mayhem andmurder’. One key player had already emerged, a major whom Dennis Wheatley termed‘a cloak and dagger chap with whom I had numerous friendly dealings’, who haddeveloped his own special plans for a birthday surprise that would be very, verydifferent.images [images/icon.jpg]Celebrating the Führer’s birth would provide a suitable starting point for Louisde Wohl’s ouverture of death. Rumours of Adolf Hitler’s untimely demise wouldstart that same spring of 1941. The Führer’s impending 52nd birthday would actas the catalyst for just such an astrological opportunity. Sir Charles Hambro,the deputy director of the Special Operations Executive, was now also alert tothe fact that both the Führer and his deputy, Rudolf Hess, might be influencedby the often malign influence of the stars.As already noted, Sir Charles’s office had originally been behind Louis deWohl’s move the previous autumn to Grosvenor House. While the files remainopaque, it is clear where his information was coming from. And now, six monthslater, as part of SOE’s lingering involvement in propaganda, Hambro wasinstrumental in convincing his colleagues that ‘all astrological angles wereworth exploring’.Louis de Wohl was clearly in his element.Predictions of Adolf Hitler’s demise would get back to Berlin, Hambroreiterated, possibly affecting his judgement by making him doubt his own abilityto make decisions in the face of the overwhelming certainties of celestialmalevolence. ‘I am always asked to do curious things,’ Sir Charles wrote inApril 1941, ‘and this is probably one of the most curious I have ever been askedto arrange but nonetheless most important. The whole subject has been carefullydiscussed and is being done on a worldwide basis according to a definite plan.’One of his underlings, Leslie ‘Sherry’ Sheridan – an army major who, as thefiles note, ‘also does curious things sometimes’ – was the chosen instrument forselling de Wohl’s plans. A former night editor of the Daily Mirror, Sheridanlater became a barrister before joining the Special Operations Executive. Henever emerged from this oddly twilit world and would achieve a greater notorietyas a post-war ‘cold war warrior’, heading the Information Research Divisionwhich supported the publication of Animal Farm in the Islamic world (where theassociation of pigs and communism need little elaboration).Though he had a temper, caustic wit and clearly didn’t suffer fools gladly,Sheridan’s efforts beheld what one obituary termed ‘the sureness of hisprofessional approach on a subject like propaganda, befuddled as it was by acrowd of amateurs, gifted perhaps but certainly scatterbrained’. In fact, hebecame the lynchpin for Louis de Wohl’s ouverture of death, silently andsecretly helping pull the strings.‘Starting in the Balkans and using his widespread contacts with Fleet Streetjournalists and foreign correspondents, Sheridan built up a network of agentsthat, by 1941, covered the principal neutral capitals of the world,’ as one SOEdocument notes. Some were placed under cover as hacks, while others worked for anews agency, Britannia Ltd, which had been set up on the Strand in London byLeslie Sheridan.In other words, he was well placed to take de Wohl’s exotic prognostications andextend their tendrils all over the world. For that he would need diplomats andadministrators who no doubt wondered if he had taken leave of his senses. Thatearly spring of 1941, Sheridan arrived at the Colonial Office with Hambro’sblessing and supposedly ‘accurate’ astrological data with which to predict thedictator’s downfall.Major Sheridan visited an assistant secretary at the Colonial Office, whoseglobal remit would allow the full symphonic range suggested by Louis de Wohl’souverture of death. Certainly, the assistant secretary then covered his own backby sending his own memo to his colonial colleagues: ‘The idea behind thisstrikes me as fantastic. Major Sheridan (who has no personal belief inastrology) meets all such criticism by admitting it but asking why we should notmake such use as we can of the credulity of others.’The information Major Sheridan brought with him revealed that Adolf Hitler wasborn at 6.30 p.m. on 20 April 1889, making him a Taurus by a few hours. Othersclearly suspected a very different form of bull. Rather like the high-ups in theRoyal Navy, the pukka fellows at the Colonial Office wanted to make sure theywouldn’t be considered nutcases themselves before they would do anything. Anumber wanted reassurances that the topic had been discussed at Cabinet level(it hadn’t, though individual ministers had been informed about the work).Soon, the work began in earnest.As Louis de Wohl had realised, in the run-up to Adolf Hitler’s birthday thatApril, Neptune would be in opposition to his birth sign. ‘Neptunian fate isalways mysterious,’ Sheridan wrote, following on from his master’s voice,‘usually violent and full of conspiratorial danger from closest associates.’Intriguingly, the SOE major recorded for the files that ‘Hitler maintainsastrologer Krafft’ and also feared an untimely demise before he had completedthe work of the Thousand Year Reich. ‘His decisions are reported to beinfluenced by portents in the stars.’If nothing else, a whispering campaign involving his supposed malefic aspectswould destroy the idea that the Führer was possessed of superhuman powers. Theorchestra of astrological deception would include music which ‘may be heardwithin Germany, where astrology is now a recognised science, and even reach theears of Hitler himself, with unsettling effect on his judgment’.SOE dispatched information to spread the word of Hitler’s impending doom inplaces such as Turkey, Egypt, Singapore and West Africa. Perhaps the mostremarkable involved the governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, whosework came under the aegis of the Colonial Office. He briefed a Chinese contactwho arranged for a suitably diabolic prediction to emerge from a planchettemessage (a type of séance) at a Chinese temple in Macao. This was then passed tothe Reuters news agency, which dutifully filed a dispatch which reported thepredictions that not only would Hitler suffer a great reverse in the second halfof 1941 but also die in 1942.But perhaps the most curious statement within Whitehall – that subversivewarfare was being carried out – came on 1 May 1941. ‘An attempt is being made toexploit astrological credulity to our advantage in view of the fact thatastrology is now a recognized science in Germany and that Hitler himself [is]understood to believe in it.’images [images/icon.jpg]What happened next, though, nobody could predict.By the early spring of 1941, there was a certain breathless expectancysurrounding the possible uses of astrology in the war effort which, with theskilful prompting of Sherry Sheridan, had become part of a concerted effort inusing black propaganda and the insertion of bogus horoscopes in newspapersaround the world. ‘According to the stars,’ The Observer later reported of theHarrogate conference in the middle of April, ‘Hitler will try to invade Britainnext month during a “blitzkrieg” which will break out in all its fury between 9May and 11 May.’Fury was a splendid word to describe what happened slap bang in the middle ofthose dates. Instead of needing to look up to follow the stars, something wouldcome down, falling out of the sky in the form of a parachutist – and with him averitable shower of conspiracy theories. Although the official MI6 history notesthat there is no real mystery about the affair, the arrival of Rudolf Hess inScotland remains one of the stranger episodes of the Second World War. It was anevent that would electrify many observers thanks, in part, to the rumours ofastrology being involved. But as is now also clear, much more of the egregiousmisinformation which later resulted came thanks to a rather different maligninfluence: the most treacherous spy of his generation, later to be elevatedwithin MI6 to head all Soviet counter-intelligence, who was actually a Sovietagent himself.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 And, according to this contemporaneous note in the WO 208/4475 file of MI14activities on the ‘Orchestra of Death’, Lord Halifax agreed with him, for in hisfirst interviews with the US press, he spoke of ‘the revelation of a well keptsecret’ – that Hitler had lost the war in June by going to Paris, not London.2 A secretary to Sir Charles Hambro later told Ellic Howe: ‘I’m prettycertain that we did not move de Wohl into Grosvenor House until at least October1940, probably later. I was very often at the so-called Bureau, posing as hissecretary … I had, at the time, to go there to type his “reports” to theAdmiralty and War Office as his English, although good, was still a bit rocky asto grammar.’3 The fire in the registry also means that many of the first contacts MI5 hadwith Louis de Wohl are irretrievably lost. For conspiracy theorists, there is afeast of detail in such a conflagration as many other files were lost, too.4 There was a subsequent curious development in using Bomber Command forpropaganda purposes. ‘You have no chance. Soon we shall be coming every nightand every day,’ read one leaflet which was later dropped over Germany. ‘We aregoing to scourge the Third Reich from end to end if you make it necessary for usto do so. You cannot stop it and you know it.’This leaflet caused a ‘storm in a teacup’ with its political message. As RichardCrossman also noted, the leaflets were diffused as they fell to earth and neverseemed to reach their target. ‘It was a very wasteful way of getting informationto the enemy when the radio could do so much better.’ This set the scene for thework discussed in the next chapter masterminded by Tom Delmer.5 The fact he controlled three agents led to his codename of Tricycle, not,as some have stated, because of his interest in threesomes."},{"pageContent":"9MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR [contents.htm#a12]In the early days of the war, particularly when Britain stood alone in 1940 and1941, the British had little with which to oppose the Germans except deception.They resorted to every type of subterfuge … in order to confuse the Germans asto the amount of military strength (they had) and, more important, itsdisposition. Out of this was born a habit that was later difficult (for them) todiscard.Eisenhower, Crusade in Europe, New York (1968)All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seemunable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we mustmake the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believewe are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.Sun Tzu, The Art of WarOf all the organisations to wage secret war against Nazi Germany, none had amore exotic – or indeed protracted – provenance than the Political WarfareExecutive (PWE). In the spring of 1941, the PWE was the new kid on the block sofar as the British secret services were concerned. Amazingly, it had takeneighteen months of another form of political warfare for everything to cometogether. In fact, the ongoing ‘spat’ between what one official history terms‘two combative and influential ministers’ – of Information and Subversion, ineffect – would not actually be completely resolved until that summer of 1941.The PWE could call upon some illustrious members. With a Bloomsbury groupnovelist as its official historian, nowhere else in Whitehall could have everemployed talents as exotic and diverse as those of Noël Coward, Freya Starck,Jock Bruce Lockhart and Joanna Scott-Moncrieff at various times in the fighting.Fewer still secret agencies would ever have found their staff mingling with theanimals at the zoo attached to Woburn Abbey, where one recorded that a visitingMember of Parliament had been ‘butted by a llama and bitten by a rhea’.Opinion was divided as to quite what it all actually achieved.One former political warfare practitioner famously declared it was ‘a giganticwaste of human effort and public money which could have been better employed inother ways more conducive to winning the war’. But for all the dithering,infighting as well as personal and political bickering, in the spring of 1941the organisation went into overdrive with the arrival of a genius who had beentasked with broadcasting to the enemy. Almost straightaway, Sefton Delmerrecognised the need for something radical and innovative, and took care to upsetthe cosy uncertainties which had hitherto infected the subject.1Tom Delmer became a skilled practitioner in the arcane arts, of what he laterchristened ‘black propaganda’. At its heart was the notion that the Germans werenever to know that such propaganda was British, and later Allied, in origin. Andthough it took a while to establish, Delmer eventually employed many methods ofgetting his message across. Leaflets, pamphlets, spurious broadcasts and aconcerted effort in infiltrating banned documents into Nazi Germany were allused. And rumours – the full range of gossip and odd reports – known as sibs(from the Latin word sibilare, to hiss or whistle) were spread by any number ofsources, agents amongst them.Sefton Delmer understood the German mind and effortlessly worked to exploit itsweaknesses. For all his Falstaffian bonhomie, Delmer was shrewd and ingeniouslysubverted the enemy. ‘But above all Delmer possessed a true modesty and humilityof soul,’ recalled one of his colleagues, Robert Walmsley. ‘He believed,certainly in his own power, but never in his own infallibility.’ As he had beena pre-war correspondent in Berlin, where he had made it his business to get toknow all the Nazi leaders, Tom Delmer was, as a later Foreign Office mandarinand wartime colleague recalled, ‘the nearest thing to a genius which PWEproduced.’images [images/icon.jpg]By the time Sefton Delmer joined the fledgling propaganda effort in the springof 1941, the organisation which had been split off from the Special OperationsExecutive (and would shortly be renamed the Political Warfare Executive) wasready-made for a surreal, circus-like atmosphere given its location next door tothe Duke of Bedford’s zoo. ‘If the Department’s installation at Woburn resembledscenes from the Beatles’ comic TV Magical Mystery Tour film,’ one of itsearliest recruits recalled without need for exaggeration, ‘the early annals ofits sojourn there also had qualities which were sometimes more akin tosurrealism than reality.’And, in the propagandist Ellic Howe’s estimation, nobody expected Sefton Delmerto transform it into a genuine weapon of warfare. The atmosphere, when hearrived, was ‘heavily charged with personal rivalries’.2 Delmer’s most immediatedifficulty came in yet another bailiwick dispute – this time with the BritishBroadcasting Corporation and a rapidly developing personal animosity with itsthen head of German section (who later rose to become its Director General).Then, as now, the BBC considered that nobody had any business encroaching uponits territory. The Corporation was already responsible for what was termed‘white’ propaganda – that is non-subversive, signed broadcasts – which now ledto yet another pointless dispute over which much time, energy and vitriol wasexpended. Who exactly should be responsible for broadcasting propaganda to theenemy? The debate sometimes burst into public view, with Cabinet discussions aswell as bitter rows which erupted in the House of Commons.Technically speaking, all forms of radio communication came under theministerial purview of a forceful, fast-talking Oxford philosophy don whosecapacity to quarrel was well known. Richard Crossman, a Labour politician whowas invariably too clever by half, was responsible for both the BBC overseasbroadcasts and what came to be known as the PWE’s ‘black boomerang’.His own Machiavellian posturing led to an obvious nickname as ‘Double Crossman’,and Tom Delmer would mildly note that his new boss overstepped his authority andwas difficult. Yet even the minister couldn’t help from marvelling at Delmer’swork. In Crossman’s recollection, he happily carried out ‘any form ofsubversion, however odious’, likening him to ‘a chief who not only ate, drankand looked like Henry VIII but equalled that monarch in the genial absolutionwith which he ran his kingdom’.Most of the time, Tom Delmer’s ire was reserved for the former Daily Telegraphcorrespondent in pre-war Germany – whom he had known and not particularly warmedto – the tall, shambolic grandee from the well-known brewing dynasty whoseyounger brother was Graham Greene. Hugh Carleton Greene was responsible for theBBC’s German Service and was never remotely convinced about the very value ofblack propaganda. It put the two former rivals on a collision coursestraightaway. Richard Crossman observed that Delmer and Greene detested eachother and, in his own underhand way, exploited their hatred to the full.‘For deception purposes there was so-called “black broadcasting” – mainly atactical weapon,’ Greene would write many years later, ‘whereas “white”broadcasting was essentially strategic.’ Such circumspection was for hismemoirs. In 1941, however, the fights between the BBC and PWE, not justrestricted to Greene and Delmer, rumbled on for the best part of the year.‘It was not our job to persuade the enemy that, however gloomy our immediatesituation might be, we were confident of ultimate victory,’ Hugh Carleton Greenewould write, ‘and that there were very good reasons, historical, psychologicaland material, for this confidence.’ It would be a long-term job, he decided. Forthis Greene was certain that the truth had to be told, no matter howunpalatable. If the BBC was frank about British, and later, Allied, losses, thenclaims of victory would be that much more believable. ‘It is essentially anauxiliary weapon,’ Greene would say of Delmer’s own version of black propaganda.‘It cannot achieve victories on its own.’As an instrument of policy, however, it only ever became useful after whatRichard Crossman termed ‘a departmental war in which no holds were barred’. ToTom Delmer’s ears, the BBC German Service’s broadcasts were run mainly bydisgruntled émigrés who seemed to be appealing to the Germans’ better instincts.That, he knew, was doomed to failure. Delmer instantly dismissed most of theBBC’s output as spinsterish and narrowly focussed, far too sophisticated andmetropolitan for the average German, which he characterised by their intolerable‘dullness and sanctimony’.The broadcasts were, in Delmer’s later phrase, rather like Maida Vale callingHampstead (not London to Berlin). Even worse, it sounded like propaganda. Suchbroadcasts clearly did not appeal to the majority of Germans ‘but to theinfinitesimal few who wanted to lose [the war]’.His pleas to change the tone of the BBC’s white broadcasts fell on deaf ears.The fanciful, intellectual broadcasts continued. Sefton Delmer realised thattrying to induce any sort of rebellion was a waste of time. Fairly quickly itwas clear that precipitate action would be needed.‘Delmer had an unusual, indeed phenomenal capacity for “tuning in” to, orpenetrating the German mind and its mental processes, almost as if he himselfresembled an ultra-sophisticated radio receiving set,’ one colleague wouldwrite, while another would simply note that he was ‘indefatigable’. Even so, thevarious arguments with the BBC continued and it would not be until the firstweek of May 1941 that the first radio station dedicated to black propagandawould be ready. Even then, as an official PWE minute noted, ‘Mr Sefton Delmerwas choosing the necessary team, the necessary accommodation would not beavailable for two or three weeks.’ When he did, as another record notes, hewould produce talks of a ‘comic, racy narrative’, which were soon a hit, simplybecause Tom Delmer ‘was able to speak Berlin slang, and was capable ofintroducing comic songs into his talks where suitable’.images [images/icon.jpg]If the propaganda effort left a lot to be desired, at least the business ofrunning the double agents was now firing on all cylinders. By the start of 1941,British Intelligence was now orchestrating a dozen or so odd characters who hadlanded over the past few months and turned them against the Germans. Now, withthe threat of invasion receding, they could be used for a more subtle form ofwarfare.The Security Service had finally stepped up its activities to a war footing. Anew influx of staff, a deliberate leavening of a debilitated service with a fewhome-grown intellectuals, had been brought in. Their number included academics,teachers and even a circus owner. Many were lawyers and, indeed, half a dozenwould become judges in the years after the war. They formed the nucleus of a newdepartment which would lead to the greatest intelligence triumph of the war.Its titular head was called, disparagingly at first, ‘the Oxford don’: abone-dry ascetic of a man who had been commissioned in the Intelligence Corpsbecause he spoke German fluently (the only benefit from his internment in theGreat War, a source of much personal distress for him). John Cecil Masterman wasnot only a leading member of the British Establishment, he had almostsingle-handedly created it. A governor of half a dozen of Britain’s most eminentpublic schools, his fame as an amateur athlete and cricketer was legendary.‘He was,’ recalls Sir Michael Howard (a later pupil and historian of SecondWorld War deception), ‘the Greatest and Best of the Great and Good.’Masterman would come to chair the ad hoc committee that would disseminatemisinformation via the double agents. To many he was an odd choice, for ‘theOxford don’ was not universally popular. Behind the clear blue, almostGladstonian eyes, some detected priggishness, others a gaunt humourlessness, akind of desiccated intellectual superiority that grated on some and terrifiedothers. Many of the double agents themselves came to appreciate the icy calm ofhis deliberations. Others thought him wise and tactful.3It is thanks to J.C. Masterman and his report on the Double Cross System that weknow how it all came together. On the cold, featureless first Thursday of 1941,a group of men met in the incongruous surroundings of Wormwood Scrubs. Allrepresented different branches of the military, and in time their numberswelled. This would be the first of weekly meetings of what became known as theXX Committee or, to those initiated, the Twenty Club, which continued rightuntil the end of the war.In the years since, a mythology of sure-footed genius has accompanied itssuccesses. As the files show, it only seemed tentatively so at the time. ‘Dimly,very dimly we began to guess at the beginning of 1941,’ Masterman noted, ‘thatwe did, in fact, control the enemy system.’ Given the chairman’s sportingprowess (he was a cricketing ‘blue’) it is no wonder that he likened the wholesystem to an elaborate Test innings. He wrote:Running a team of double agents is very like running a club cricket side. Olderplayers lose their form and are gradually replaced by newcomers. Wellestablished veterans unaccountably fail to make runs, whereas youngsters whosestyle at first appears crude and untutored for some unexplained reason makelarge scores.In time, the Twenty Club members would be astonished at some of the whimsies ofthe players. ‘It is not always easy to pitch the best side to put into the fieldfor any particular match,’ Masterman would add. The problem was that the natureof many was such that they were hardly trustworthy, some needed better handling‘requiring a great deal of net practice before they were really fit to play in amatch’, and had no idea when they would have to be retired or pulled out.To continue Masterman’s cricketing metaphor, its members never knew when theywould need to bring out the best player on to the pitch. Clearly, trying to foolthe Germans would be a far more complicated enterprise than anyone daredimagine. Many near misses stalked the whole enterprise, particularly as it grewin size and complexity in the later years of the war, when there would beupwards of a hundred important agents all over the world (and at most a dozen,including Dusko Popov, who were vital to the return to Europe). And yet, as theyplanned to manipulate the enemy, not even J.C. Masterman would equivocate. In‘communicating with the enemy almost from day to day,’ he wrote, ‘we wereplaying with dynamite.’images [images/icon.jpg]In all its subsequent endeavours, though, the XX Committee had a whollyunexpected ally. Time and time again, the British secret service couldn’tbelieve how amateurish its opposite numbers were. Certainly, the sea change inBritish attitudes towards German Military Intelligence came at this time.Everything that Admiral Canaris’s staff did seemed so unbelievably idiotic andincompetent that it looked for all the world like some sort of elaboratedeception operation was being staged against the British. Surely nobody could bethat useless?In the estimation of Ewen Montagu of Naval Intelligence, ‘after we hadexperience of German Intelligence, no incompetence would have surprised us’ forvirtually every attempt at foreign espionage from 1940 onwards ended in failure.All its agents who were sent to Britain – and later the United States – werecaptured.The Abwehr, by any rational estimation, was severely handicapped.Firstly, there was little understanding of the qualities needed to recruitsuccessful agents. Secondly, Canaris’s men were never able to find the bestpeople at all. What one of its officers later referred to as the abnormal growthof the agency had a lot to do with it. There were not enough officers with thespecial abilities needed to run an espionage agency efficiently. There was alsotoo much transfer between the office and the field. Nobody was ever able toactually bed down for long enough to make any difference.‘The Abwehr in the field was very poorly equipped with personnel,’ one officerrecalled during a debrief at the close of the war, by which time those verydeficiencies had long since been apparent. And worse, the Fuchsbau was neverable to evaluate the right sort of material; there was simply too much junkclogging the system.‘The trouble with the Abwehr archives was always that they contained too muchinformation,’ the officer recalled. ‘The really valuable stuff was completelylost in the mass of absolutely useless junk.’ Admiral Canaris would increasinglybecome the scapegoat for each and every disappointment. As one perceptiveBritish Intelligence officer lated noted, it was as though the Abwehr believedthe more agents their officers could add to their tally, the better they wouldbe perceived.‘The whole organisation was permeated with “pins-in-the-map syndrome”,’ saidBrigadier Raymond Maunsell, who ran security operations in Cairo. This, morethan anything, made the Germans susceptible to deception as they were reluctantto remove these pins. Quantity rather than quality meant that Abwehr officersdefended their agents – most of whom were under British, and later Allied,control – to the hilt, even when it would have been obvious that they wereeither lying or under enemy control.images [images/icon.jpg]Keeping an eye on enemy aliens meant that sometimes the funny people, as thespooks are often called, had to keep their eyes on some very funny peopleindeed. At the start of 1941, the MI6 representative in Montevideo had comeacross some odd-looking letters which had been dispatched from Nazi Germany to afemale émigré who had relocated to Uruguay. Even stranger, this woman hadexchanged a series of telegrams with somebody who lived at 2 WarringtonCrescent, London W9, which MI6 clearly didn’t seem to realise was a hotel.The name was unfamiliar to the Secret Intelligence Service. Fairly quickly, thisminor mystery was cleared up when Gilbert Lennox later reported, with crispBritish understatement, ‘We know all about him and then some.’ Similar irony wasapparent in his later report that the correspondent was ‘one of the other funnypeople who report to me’. Others, he was certain, may have heard of Louis deWohl, whom he described as ‘a tame astrologer of German upbringing, who isemployed by SO2 for their own fell purposes’ in a note to the Honourable KennethYounger (first cousin to Dennis Wheatley’s stepson, Bill, who also worked forthe Security Service). Lennox continued:He also carries on his private practice as an astrologer and he numbers amonghis clients a great many interesting people, including some of the good and thegreat. As it is often of considerable interest to know who is consulting anastrologer and for what reason, and it is sometimes even more interesting tohear the advice which the Stars give, I have made a private arrangement by whichI get reported to me the names and details of Louis’s clients.The interception of his mail came from the fact his wife seemed to be on heruppers. Alexandra de Wohl was in desperate financial straits because of herhusband’s lackadaisical attitude to money. As the MI6 representative inMontevideo noted, it looked as though she might well be ‘hard up for money asher telegrams appear to indicate but there may be something more in it’.Captain ‘Rex’ Miller, the civilian assistant to the Naval Attaché, had, in themeantime, heard about someone known locally as ‘the baroness’. As she seemed tobe in contact with a lot of known Nazis émigrés and employed German domesticstaff, she was of obvious (though low-level) interest. As a result of all thatairmail from Germany, British Intelligence was keeping a watchful eye on her.By the start of 1941, what had started to intrigue them most was the regularremittance of money from Warrington Crescent. A couple of cables chiding herhusband for not having contacted her were also worthy of investigation. What isnot said in the files is the obvious notion that Alexandra de Wohl might be somesort of front, though quite what she might have been fronting would be hard toimagine.As time went on, her tone became desperate. In one telegram, she complained thatshe had had to move because Louis de Wohl hadn’t sent her any money as hepromised. A few days later came another more urgent cable: ‘FRIENDS CANTPOSSIBLY HELP FURTHER CABLE DATE AND AMOUNT REMITTANCE PAST OR FUTURE COMPLETELYAT A LOSS.’ Alexandra, it seemed, had gone to South America for the duration ofthe war. Gilbert Lennox had met her and was puzzled about her supposed baronialbackground. ‘She is a very pleasant person,’ he wrote, and whether his storyabout ancestry was true, it didn’t seem to matter. Unlike some of the peoplesecurity officials often had to discuss, her ‘morals are of the highest and Ihave never heard anything suggested against her’.Her own pretensions seemed to match those of her husband. ‘To the best of myknowledge she is German by birth,’ Lennox discovered, ‘the daughter of a bankerbut the story is that she is of Hungarian origin and has royal blood!’ Despitewhat he termed Louis’s amatory adventures and habits, they seemed to be veryfond of each other.She treats him as a small boy and he sometimes forgets to write to her. Louis issupposed to have some arrangement for sending her money and has cabled her aboutthis. Obviously, she has been hard up and the cables are about money. I havemyself seen some of the more recent cables and I am quite certain there is nomore in it than appears on the surface.Enquiries in January 1941 via the Bank of England, Louis de Wohl’s own branch ofthe Westminster Bank and their branch in Uruguay showed the monetary remittancewas all above board. ‘Our friend has apparently been doing this since March 1939without any trouble,’ wrote June Bainbridge, one of the astrologer’s handlers atSOE. She noted that there had been a gap of three months when he had hadn’t sentmoney, where it was more likely he too was on his uppers. As this coincided withhis work for Naval Intelligence and MI14, no doubt he wasn’t able to concentrateon commercial clients.For the files, further investigation revealed that Alexandra was described ashis loving wife and though clearly fond of her husband, ‘I should describe herattitude as more motherly than wifely’. There was another dimension as to howexactly his wife was being used. Further enquiries by an SOE official calledCaptain Hope noted that in 1938 Louis de Wohl had been involved with the Batashoe company, and had been trying to set up an agency for selling their wares inthe United States. Such ‘unmanly’ interests beheld something else.‘Hope said that de Wohl was a homosexual and it therefore becomes ratherdifficult to explain his interest in the woman who helped furnish his flat inGrosvenor House,’ the files note. This transpired to be June Bainbridge which,as another file noted, neatly ‘disposed’ of the theory that Bainbridge was deWohl’s mistress. In fact, somebody else who knew the astrologer when he roomedat the Esplanade had been picked up by the Security Service. ‘This woman seemsto be involved with some mystery in view of the fact that de Wohl who ratherblatantly flaunts his effeminate inclinations and habits, has of late maderather a close companion of the woman referred to above.’An intriguing snippet of his contacts concerns a half-salvaged letter to DickWhite, the overall head of counter-intelligence within MI5, which had beenwritten at the start of October 1940. ‘I asked him for the names of any Germanharlots who he had ever met in this country,’ a file notes. As is clear, therising star of British counter-intelligence, like many of his colleagues, wasnever convinced about all the effort with their so-called ‘tame’ astrologer.Dick White simply came to class him as more of a pain in the backside. ‘I havenever liked Louis de Wohl,’ wrote White a year later, ‘he strikes me as acharlatan and an impostor.’images [images/icon.jpg]The problem for all the secret agencies was that many of the people they cameinto contact with overseas were not just charlatans or impostors, but mostlikely dedicated provocateurs. As a result, security was always a thorny issue.For the wartime Secret Intelligence Service, charged with ensuring thesafekeeping of the information emanating from Bletchley Park, any hint thatGerman agents had been doubled (or, worse, that their greater communicationswere being read) would bring down the whole edifice.For MI6, the notion of counter-intelligence became paramount, and none took itmore seriously than the senior officer responsible, the son of a missionary,whose own zealotry extended to not wanting to share any information with anyoneif he could help it. Within the corridors of the secret services, he becameviewed as an unpleasant megalomaniac.Yet Colonel Felix Cowgill couldn’t care less.Around his slender shoulders rested the greatest secret of wartime intelligence,the lifeblood of the XX Committee in turning the enemy’s agents against theirmasters. With good reason, nothing was more important than this electromagneticmanna from heaven. Generically known as Ultra, ‘the extremely tight restrictionwhich [Cowgill] imposed on its distribution,’ one historian has noted, ‘causedsome friction, both within the service and in its relations with other bodies,MI5 above all.’Here was another bailiwick dispute which stemmed from the ultimate ‘need toknow’ basis. It centred on what had become the fastest-growing part of theBritish secret service which Major Cowgill now commanded. On the face of it,Section V of MI6 sounds anonymous, dull and without merit, which was exactlywhat it was designed to be. It was, in effect, a secret service within a secretservice, an acknowledgement that counter-intelligence – and in particular itshandmaiden, counter-espionage – needed to be isolated and insulated from therest of the organisation.With the loss of its European networks, and indeed the Venlo incident, MI6 hadhad to build up everything from scratch. Section V had originally been createdand run during the twenties by ‘Vee Vee’ Vivian, the deputy chief who was betterknown as a fastidious fellow with a monocle, with just a couple of fellowofficers. As a former Indian policeman, Vivian knew the well-known yet eccentricArabist, Harry St John Philby4, a strange cove by anyone’s estimation. It was afriendship that would have many serious repercussions, not least when Vivianbecame Vice Chief to Sir Stewart Menzies shortly after war broke out.Section V grew, like Topsy, to become as large as the rest of the organisation.Far from now just dealing with counter-espionage, it became the keeper at thegate for what is today known as signals analysis, the secure and timelyexploitation of the decoded German radio traffic. At this point, BritishIntelligence could observe messages sent by the double agents as they passedalong the system, which allowed them a ‘crib’ into the Abwehr’s communications.In time, there would be a Section V sub-section for every geographical area ofthe fighting, and by the end of the war it employed roughly 4,500 people. Inparticular, Iberia remained a seething labyrinth of spies, intrigue andsuspected provocations. On his return from Sierra Leone, in the time-honouredway of the British Establishment, Graham Greene would be given a plum job in theIberian section. Though he knew nothing about Spain or Portugal, theirlanguages, their people nor their history, this was not perceived as a handicapat all. Yet, in time, working for Section V, Greene and his colleagues were morethan up to the task. ‘By the end of the war,’ Greene would write, ‘those Abwehrwho were not working for us, we knew were working with completely imaginaryagents and receiving pay to give to their agents, agents who did not exist.’Iberia itself would become, in the grander scheme of things, the eye of theneedle so far as Abwehr-related espionage directed towards Great Britain, andlater the Americas, was concerned. For now, and for the rest of the fighting,Iberia would become the focus for the secret war. The game of the foxes, as ithas been called, was helped by a certain Teutonic thoroughness. ‘We wereimmensely helped by the fact that the Abwehr officers were a gentlemanlyorganisation,’ recalled one MI6 hand. ‘They believed in treating their spieswell, accommodated them at good hotels and sent them on sleepers or first classreserved seats.’By 1941, Section V’s driving force was Felix Cowgill who, as one of hiscolleagues noted, was ‘combative in his work, always prepared to challenge anoffice ruling’. To others, he was nothing short of a tyrant, a bureaucraticbugbear who was completely paranoid on the subject of security. Cowgill, asanother with whom he dealt later complained, had ‘a pathological inability toinform anyone of anything that he can possibly avoid’.In fairness, Cowgill had a very difficult job of it: the secret of BletchleyPark lay within his remit. Yet this great success was also the point of itsgreatest weakness. Any hint to an outsider, let alone the agents themselves,that their hand encoded ciphers were being systematically read, monitored andlovingly transmitted with ‘chickenfeed’ (as false information was known) wouldsee the whole elaborate edifice come tumbling down. By common consent – thoughthere are the usual questioners – the use of Ultra and the double agentsforeshortened the war by at least a year, possibly even two.Understandably, Felix Cowgill wouldn’t share Ultra with anyone.He hadn’t want MI5 officials allowed to see any Ultra material as part of the XXCommittee operations. When they were, he still refused to let representativesfrom the Home Forces and Home Defence Executive see it. Reference to any MI6agents was always removed from the distribution lists. Major Cowgill alsobelieved the rubric ‘most secret sources’ (a euphemism for the decoded signals)was also too revealing, even in reports that had a restricted distribution.‘Cowgill was so imbued with the idea of security that when he was put in chargefor C of this material he was quite willing to try entirely to prevent its useas intelligence lest it be compromised,’ concluded Commander Ewen Montagu (who,as the Naval Intelligence representative, had also been allowed to see some ofthe decrypts) in a post-war summary of wartime intelligence. ‘These viewsinevitably caused friction.’Wearisome bureaucratic battles continued for quite some time.For all his desire for utmost security, the most horrible irony of all was thatFelix Cowgill inadvertently allowed its greatest ever liability to literallywalk in through his door. In September 1941, nemesis literally arrived in theform of a new recruit to Section V itself. This new fellow, whose fluency inSpanish, French and German commended him, had been a journalist (rare in MI6)and a graduate (even rarer). And though he appeared to be a shy yet personablemember of the Establishment, fate had very different ideas for Harold AdrianPhilby, better known as Kim, when he took the reins of the Iberian Section ofMI6’s own counter-intelligence department.images [images/icon.jpg]The instrument which would allow Tom Delmer to extend his reach in broadcastingpropaganda right into the heart of enemy territory had come about thanks to anarbitrary ruling by the US Federal Communications Commission. The limit to thetransmission power of any formally licensed radio station in the United Stateshad been set at 5kW. So when the New Jersey Station WJ2 ordered a 500kWtransmitter in late 1940, the Feds stepped in. Its greater transmission powerwould have allowed the station to reach a wider audience and generate greateradvertising revenue. This would now have important ramifications in the secretwar.In May 1941, the Political Warfare Executive bought the mothballed transmitter,which had already been built by the Radio Corporation of America. In the wordsof the brigadier who conveyed it across the Atlantic, the huge device would nowbecome ‘a raiding Dreadnought of the Ether, firing broadcasts at unpredictabletimes at unpredictable objectives of the enemy’s radio propaganda machine’. Thetransmitter itself was established at Crowborough in the Sussex Downs, while thebroadcasts were recorded at the Political Warfare Executive’s headquarters atWoburn Zoo.Given the codename Aspidistra, after the music hall song (about the biggestaspidistra in the world), its transmission power was bumped up to 600kW so thatit could reach deep into the Third Reich and far across the Atlantic.Incredibly, though it was ready straightaway, regular broadcasts were delayed bynearly eighteen months thanks to the usual interdepartmental squabbles. The BBC,the Ministry of Information and Wireless Telegraphy Board all bickered as to whoshould actually ‘own’ the transmitter. At one meeting, Dick Crossman would notehis repulsion at the ‘atmosphere of club chat and unconscious incompetence’.A station manned by German Marxists was already being supervised by Crossman,who exercised no control over the content. He felt that Tom Delmer should dosomething similar with a more right-wing bias. Many years later, Crossmanclaimed he was inspired by a curious conversation with Leonard Ingrams. A Germanpropaganda station called The Workers’ Challenge was broadcasting in Englishevery taboo under the sun. ‘Old Ladies in Eastbourne and Torquay are listeningto it avidly,’ Ingrams told him. ‘They enjoy counting the f’s and b’s.’Delmer replied in kind. His first innovation was Gustav Siegfried Eins (GeorgeSugar One) which started broadcasting on Friday, 23 May 1941. Using a characterknown as Der Chef – in reality a German-born corporal then working in thePioneer Corps – he sounded like a crusty Prussian general. Delmer’s genius wasto recognise that he should appear to be a patriot, a supporter of Hitler, whocould nevertheless be used to undermine the listeners.Gustav’s overarching aim was to make the listener think he or she had stumbledacross a military organisation that was sending out messages and ciphers. Duringits first broadcast, Der Chef wanted to make contact with Gustav Siegfried 18.There was a message about an agent who should meet at the Union Theatre on anupcoming day at ‘row five, parquet stalls, second performance’. Given that therewere innumerable Union theatres across the Reich, Delmer knew the Gestapo wouldrun around in circles trying to find out where this person really was.The station was also subtly anti-British, which made it sound even moreplausible. A month after it started broadcasting, Delmer was about to head toLondon when he learned of the German attack on Soviet Russia. A debate followedon how this news would be broadcast by Gustav Siegfried Eins. ‘Der Chef is allfor Hitler and his war on the Bolsheviks,’ Delmer told his bemused staff. But,in subsequent broadcasts, Der Chef recognised that there were middle-rankingofficials (known as the parteikommune) ‘who were feathering their own nests inthe soft-job billets far from danger and privation’.Such attacks became part and parcel of the propaganda that was broadcast overthe next two and a half years. ‘While our brave soldiers are freezing to deathin Russia because of the corruption of this parteikommune crowd,’ Der Chef laterrailed when the offensive stalled in the snows, ‘who delayed getting the Army’swinter clothing ready in time because they were out for bigger profit?’To add verisimilitude, Delmer’s team eavesdropped on prisoners of war andinterrupted correspondence: in one famous case from the wife of anindustrialist, which revealed there had been parties for high-ups where thetables groaned with food despite rationing for everyone else. This, too,appeared in a subsequent broadcast. By the time of the final transmission inlate October 1943, accompanied by the sounds of the Gestapo storming the stationand shooting Der Chef, Gustav Siegfried Eins had clearly served his purpose.images [images/icon.jpg]Kim Philby casts a long shadow over many of the stories which follow thanks tohis deliberate muck-raking, deceptions, fun-poking and what one eminentcolleague called the ‘poisoning the well’ of the historical record. So itcontinues unabated today with a highly hyped book about his influence andfriends in high places. Various exaggerated claims have been made for theSection V supervisor, not least with the inevitable comparisons with the mostfamous fictional agent of them all. His friend and fellow MI6 recruit MalcolmMuggeridge considered Philby to have been nothing less than a real-life JamesBond.‘His boozy amours, his tough postures, his intelligence expertise, are directlyrelated to the same characteristics in Fleming’s hero,’ Muggeridge wrote manyyears later.Yet the notion that Kim Philby was some sort of masterspy who somehowmasterminded all Section V’s Iberian counter-intelligence operations isnonsense. He only ever visited Lisbon once and travelled through theMediterranean stations at the end of the war. Far from being a glamorous job,his – like everybody else’s in Section V – was tedious desk work that neededpainstaking (and at times painfully boring) analysis of signals.Yet Philby fitted in straightaway. He was a good boss to work for thanks to hisagreeable nature that was occasionally leavened by an acerbic bon mot. Boyish,almost naive, with a soft spot for ne’er do wells and womanisers, some detecteda controlled hysteria, a hint of suppressed violence ‘which manifested itself inthe often infantile plots his Section V work involved’, in another colleague’sestimation.Yet people warmed to this stuttering Englishman of the old school. He wastremendously good company. In the estimation of another school friend who laterjoined him in Section V, nobody seemed able to pin him down. The fact Philby wassupplying information to the NKVD, the forerunner of the KGB, was never evensuspected. When Kenneth Benton (the MI6 Section V officer based in Lisbon) wasexperiencing difficulties obtaining an official car, Philby laughed. ‘If youwere working for the NKVD,’ he said derisively, ‘you’d get whatever car youwanted at the drop of a hat.’5Philby’s recruitment had come about thanks to his father, who had known ‘VeeVee’ Vivian in India. After his internment, Harry St John Philby was well enoughregarded to be listened to. His son’s noted leftward leanings were dismissed asso much youthful exuberance. Vivian was astute enough to realise that the SecretIntelligence Service needed new, clever people and fluent linguists so his sonwas welcomed. There is a certain irony that in one later Russian intelligenceanalysis of their greatest wartime asset, Philby’s father was ‘an ambitioustyrant’ who had caused the stammer in his son.It also helped that Philby knew most of the people who had also been recruitedinto the secret services. At the outbreak of war, the former journalist with TheTimes had joined the fledgling propaganda effort thanks to knowledge stemmingfrom the Spanish Civil War, where he had been the longest-serving correspondentduring the fighting.After being appointed an instructor in the propaganda department which was beinghalf-heartedly run by the Special Operations Executive in Beaulieu, within ayear he had transferred across to Section V of MI6 in August 1941. As manyGerman intelligence operations against Britain were being mounted from Iberia,he seemed an ideal choice to ramp up counter-espionage against the Abwehr. Withvirtually just a handshake, he was in.images [images/icon.jpg]If there was one adjective that came to describe Ellic Howe, it was impish.Yet that could never quite convey the quicksilver glee of the dark-hairedprinter, ‘cosily rotund, quick witted and quick moving’ in the posthumousassessment of Robert Harling, himself a fellow devotee of design and printwork.Harling, who also worked closely with Ian Fleming, considered Howe a splendidchap who ‘looked more akin to a bohemian circus tumbler’ than a leadingtypographer. But as the head of what was known as Mr Howe’s Department withinthe Political Warfare Executive, he came to have a singular impact on theprosecution of black propaganda that complemented (on the printed page) that ofTom Delmer’s work which carried through the ether.It is a measure of Ellic Howe’s interests, not least in mysticism, astrology andfreemasonry, that he was both a wry chronicler (as his notion of the Woburnactivities being akin to The Beatles above shows), as well as participant in thepropaganda efforts. A puzzling character of Russian background, many found himhard to pin down. ‘Mr Howe’, as he was invariably known, deliberately cultivatedan air of mystery about himself, his background and his various pre-war travelsaround Europe where he discovered a facility for languages. His life changed inthe mid-thirties when he discovered typography and helped run a pioneeringmagazine on the subject.Fairly quickly, he developed an incomparable knowledge of all fonts.In the same way that Tom Delmer revolutionised the black radio broadcasts, EllicHowe would do the same with officially sanctioned forgeries. As the officialhistory of the Political Warfare Executive notes, the earliest attempts atforging leaflets – supposedly written by opposition groups behind the lines –were simply not good enough. It was only when Ellic Howe took over theirproduction later in 1941 that they passed muster.Like so many in the secret war, it took Mr Howe some time to find his métier.With the outbreak of hostilities, he had been recruited as a sergeant in theAnti-Aircraft Command, where he was trained in using ack-ack guns. Like so manyothers with unusual skills, Howe had diligently submitted papers to Whitehall onhow to forge material. As with Dennis Wheatley, he was either overlooked orwould be turned down for more gainful employ.In the summer of 1941, his luck turned with a submitted paper. ‘The DocumentaryWeapon’, as he termed it, had been forwarded via MI5 to the Political WarfareExecutive, where he was recruited by Leonard Ingrams to work on a small postalunit. Ellic Howe’s first work in black propaganda was to create more realisticstamps and envelopes that could be used to cause mischief behind enemy lines.In propaganda circles, though, Ellic Howe’s own sense of fun was infectious.Howe got on with everybody and did a superb job. As the official history of thePWE notes, his work was so vital that he was allowed to set up his ownindependent unit, ‘the most important member of which was Miss ElizabethFriedlander, a typographical artist and consummate forger’. They both consultedwidely. Mr Howe seemed to know every printer, foundryman and compositor in theindustry, so much so that as his friend Robert Harling later noted, the resultwas ‘far more sophisticated forgeries to undermine the finances of the ThirdReich’.It helped that Howe worked brilliantly in harness with Tom Delmer, whorecognised something of a fellow spirit. ‘After Delmer had taken over theprovision of Black Texts, the Howe Unit began to operate on a large scale,’ theofficial history adds. And by 1943, the unit was so prolific that Howe becamemore of a production organiser than printer or designer. Miss Friedlandersweated over the details while Howe outsourced the actual production to variousprinters and paper makers. At any one point in the later stages of the war, asmany as seventeen firms (‘with night shifts at two of them’) might be workingduring peak periods of activity.The range of this output was extraordinary.Mr Howe’s unit could forge batches of 5 million German ration cards or printjust one single, though extremely important, official letter. Of the mid-waroutput of Mr Howe’s Unit, the official history notes that some 10 per cent werestraight forgeries (of stamps and ration cards) while the rest were supposedlyclandestine. About three-quarters were aimed at the German audience. Most famouswas the appearance of stamps within the Third Reich that carried the images ofHimmler and Hans Frank, Hitler’s former lawyer and unspeakably cruel GovernorGeneral of Occupied Poland, instead of the Führer. As well as causing chaos inthe Greater German postal service, the stamps added to the discomfiture for thegolden pheasants that the British secret service was everywhere.Another important recruit at this time was a one-eyed Canadian lecturer fromCambridge University who was employed to look at inducing mental illness in theDeutsches Volk. Dr John McCurdy would write a malingering handbook which Howe’sunit produced. It would be later inveigled into the Third Reich to induce, so itwas thought, even the most loyal of Germans to get sick leave from theirdoctors. As the official history of the PWE puts it, the malingering guide was‘produced in many different editions bound up in fifteen or more different formssuch as books on physical culture etc.’No wonder Ellic Howe’s printers were busy; batches of 16,000 were printed off atany one time with the aim of being disseminated by balloon. This was a work inprogress as, eventually, upwards of a million were produced by the close of thewar. And yet the malingering guide showed what a double-edged weapon politicalwarfare could ultimately be. McCurdy’s guide was very subtle and clever. Apotential malingerer was never supposed to tell the doctor that he was ill,rather describe the symptoms and make sure that he came across as patriotic.‘One single symptom which the doctor has discovered by his own questions isworth ten which the patient has volunteered,’ the text describes.The irony came with what Delmer called ‘The Black Boomerang’ – how the bestintentions came back to hit you – when the Germans retranslated thismalingerer’s guide and dropped it over Allied lines later in the war, in thehope of turning it against the forces who had landed to liberate Europe.images [images/icon.jpg]Towards the end of 1941, Kim Philby had already begun his ascent within theSecret Intelligence Service (MI6). Though it was routinely (and erroneously)later said that he could easily have become the next C, he was certainly one ofthe most important agents ever to be recruited by the NKVD. Philby provided hishandlers with advance warning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union as wellas Japanese intentions to invade Singapore rather than joining the German attackon the USSR.Philby was soon well placed to learn many of the more sensitive secrets of theSecond World War. As head of the Iberian Section, his ‘beat’ was a large one,covering Spanish North Africa, Spain and Portugal as well as the Azores and theCanaries. ‘We were six officers working in what had been a spaciousdrawing-room,’ Philby recalled for Graham Greene’s biographer, ‘so our paperworkwas interrupted by much shop-talk – little of it memorable.’Indeed, it was dull and painstaking work.The fruit of the labours came with the inevitable bureaucracy of the old school.Everything ran on cross-referencing of names and identities mentioned in theAbwehr radio traffic. Every time a new name was mentioned, a new card wascreated within the office. These would be cross-referenced with other cards fromother signals, specifying the details and dates of operations. This eventuallyprovided a ‘lead’ for the relevant Section V officer in Iberia to follow up.Gradually, a priceless picture of enemy agents and case officers would be builtup and updated as and when necessary.By the time Philby joined, Section V was based at Glenalmond, an Edwardianmansion close to St Albans, one of three buildings on Lord Verulam’s estatewhich all formed an MI6 outstation. Given the special nature of its work,Glenalmond was oddly without obvious protection. ‘I recall no security guards orshowing of passes,’ recalled Philby’s old school friend, Tim Milne, about hisfirst visit. ‘Somebody – probably a passing secretary – directed me to a door[which] opened into a large room with unbarred windows on two sides and a viewof the garden.’ The mansion was surrounded by a well-kept lawn, through which apath wound between some chestnut trees. In the distance, an old lily pond couldbe seen in front of an overgrown rose garden.Its bucolic appearance was misleading: this was British Intelligence’s mainbulwark against its enemies in Iberia, building up a complete picture of theenemy intelligence set-up in both Spain and Portugal. Kim Philby was, accordingto Milne, unfazed by the complicated nature of their work. Philby knew everybodyand everything. His attention to detail became what his friend called one of hisweapons as ‘he was always well informed on the subject he was talking about’.In time, Philby used that skill in siding against everyone else’s favouriteenemy within. Oddly, though most of his underlings seemed to like working forhim at Glenalmond, Felix Cowgill’s capacity to make enemies was exploited byPhilby. Ironically, the Soviet Union would now learn that the former head ofSection V was unable to delegate, possessed few social graces and, as they wereno doubt delighted to find out, also smoked vast amounts of tobacco like KarlMarx.Once Felix Cowgill was removed, it would allow British double agent operationsto blossom on a more even keel. Even so, Philby was quickly able to consolidatehis position. ‘You know, I’m beginning to think we’re going to win this war,’ hesaid in Tim Milne’s hearing.By the end of 1941, perhaps the most important step, so far as running doubleagents was concerned, occurred when Bletchley Park broke into the Enigma trafficused by the Abwehr to communicate with the Fuchsbau. This was not just the‘chickenfeed’ of its fabrications transmitted by the double agents, but all thetraffic which the Abwehr and all its outstations exchanged. From the lowliestassistant right up to the higher echelons of Nazi Germany, British Intelligencenow could read everything its opposite numbers were discussing. Small wonder thedissemination of this material was limited for it was gold dust, allowing thedouble agent operations to go up another notch.While the work of Section V that underpinned it was hardly a laugh a minute,comedy was on the menu in some of the stranger decryptions they broke. One radiomessage related a tale of how Spanish communists had shot a pet parrot becauseit had learned from a maid the Spanish for ‘I am a royal parrot and I’m forSpain and Portugal’. Another wireless operator telegraphed to Berlin: ‘I raninto an oxcart while riding my motorcycle, went over the cliff and broke myarm.’On another famous occasion, a signal was received which revealed that Axel, aGerman police dog, had been sent out as a guard for the Algeciras outstation ofthe Abwehr. ‘Be careful of Axel,’ ran another message. ‘He bites.’ A few dayslater came the reply: ‘César (code name for Albert Carbe, head of the Abwehrthere) is in hospital. Axel bit him.’On another occasion, various Section V officers literally fell about laughingwhen scanning a roster for passengers from Istanbul to Madrid when they cameacross the name Mustapha Kunt. ‘All this may seem ridiculous,’ another Section Vman would write, ‘but there was a lot of tensions and roster checking was asdull as it was important; silly humour often kept us going.’images [images/icon.jpg]So it was that on the last day of 1941, wearing the uniform of an officer of theRoyal Air Force, Dennis Wheatley finally entered the secret world. He formallyjoined the specially created secret department whose anodyne name purposefullygave no hint of what it actually did. The London Controlling Section wouldeventually come to have a power and remit far beyond most others in the secretwar. Using the double agents and their decrypted signals, Dennis Wheatley, famedfor his pulp fiction on both magic and the occult, became intimately involved increating wholesale deceptions that would, in the fullness of time, becomeinfamous within the shadowy world of wartime intelligence.Paradoxically, and exactly how they had intended it, both the public and theenemy never knew about them at the time.Dennis Wheatley’s writing skills and fertile imagination could help stamp aunique imprimatur on the covert battles ahead. For all his fears that he wasn’tbeing listened to, The Joint Planning Staff had welcomed his contributions and,as one would write, ‘it still seems incredible that one brain in the tumultuousconditions of 1940/1941 could have produced so inspired, so sensible and sofar-seeing [a] solution.’London Control, as it was sometimes known, was part of a woolly area known as‘Future planning’. To lead it was a Conservative MP, a former minister and scionof a great aristocratic lineage, who once spoke for three and a half hours inone speech. The Right Honourable Oliver Stanley was an intimate of Churchill’sand when he was appointed controller, from the general tenor of his notes, it isclear that Stanley didn’t know what he was letting himself in for. In view ofwhat happened, there is a curious irony that his own job description showed thereason why he would fail. ‘It will not be enough for him just to read papers, asthey are issued or concluded, as they are recorded,’ he noted. ‘He should beable to roam free, stay in contact with the PWE and other agencies.’ Butcrucially, he would never get on to the PM’s list for distribution of the Ultramaterial. He also wanted to expand the section. Three officers would be needed,one each from the services, who should have ‘imagination, initiative and a soundadministrative background’.A measure of how important it was thought to be came from the fact the navalrepresentative never showed up; the army provided an elderly, one-legged oldcove with a saucy sense of humour; and the Royal Air Force, which knew a thingabout feeling threatened, announced there was a war on and nobody could bespared. And that was how it might have ended, had it not been for a few dayslater when a senior planner on the RAF staff remembered the papers which hadbeen showing up over the last few years.‘What about Wheatley?’images [images/icon.jpg]By now, a few months after he had joined Section V, Kim Philby was travellinginto London to meet his Soviet controllers on a regular basis. Nobody suspectedanything for he had legitimate business to attend to at the Broadwayheadquarters of the Secret Intelligence Service. ‘The job was so absorbing andcompletely time-consuming that I would have found it almost impossible toimagine it could take second place to even more important work,’ a colleague,who later joined Section V, noted many years later.Perhaps the greater surprise is that, for all his supposed omniscience, Philby’sreports, and those of his fellow travellers who are generally known as ‘theCambridge Five’, were widely disbelieved in the Soviet Union. His handlers inMoscow exhibited greater suspicions about all of the Cambridge-educated spies –more to do with pervasive Stalinist paranoia than anything – suspecting theywere part of some sort of deliberate misinformation campaign. It hardly helpedhis credibility that some of Kim Philby’s material was downright peculiar, withhis sometimes overheated reports of scandals, clubland debauchery and claimsthat RAF officers ‘under the influence of drugs, alcohol or sexual orgies orBlack Mass are induced to part with information’.An obvious question is: was this some sort of reference to Aleister Crowley? Theanswer may never be known, but, more significantly, Kim Philby was in placewithin the secret world when came perhaps the single most peculiar event of thewar in which many people assume Crowley was involved. Even today, many mysteriesstill linger about the arrival of Rudolf Hess in Scotland in May 1941. All cannow be examined in the true light of themes and people already introduced inthis narrative so far: astrology, political warfare, muck raking by Philby andsomeone who, at his best, was hardly coherent and never seemed to make anysense.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 His reputation for genius was well deserved. As Ellic Howe remarks: ‘Delmerwas far too modest to explain that until he arrived in the spring of 1941 nobodyhad the slightest idea of what was possible in the black department.’ (p. 8, TheBlack Game.)2 Querulousness continued to define the various propaganda efforts. Even acursory glance at the sub-headings in the relevant chapter in the OfficialHistory of the Political Warfare Executive tell their own story: ‘Need torecognize the BBC overloaded’; ‘Mr Kirkpatrick’s Threat of Resignation’; ‘PWEExecutive Committee Fails To Solve The Problem’; ‘Mr Newsome’s Attack on PWE’;and finally ‘Mr Newsome’s Insubordination’.3 To many others, Masterman’s pre-eminent association was unfair because thetrue genius who ran the double agent system was Colonel Tommy Robertson, usuallyknown by his initials as TAR. Masterman later agreed. ‘TAR was in no sense anintellectual but he had certain qualities of a high order,’ he would write. ‘Aborn leader, gifted with independent judgement, he had, above all anextraordinary flair in all the intricate operations of his profession.’And ultimately, it was all about his contacts. ‘It’s not what you know,’ TARwould lament, ‘it’s who you know.’ Indeed, such could be said of Masterman.When, many years later, he attempted to break ranks from official secrecy topublish the history of the double-cross system, his friends in the Establishmentprotected him. His former pupil, later prime minister and then serving asForeign Secretary, Alec Douglas-Home, was aghast: ‘Lock up the best amateur spinbowler in England? They must have been out of their minds.’4 Better known as the father of the Kim Philby, St John, as he was usuallyknown, had been interned as a precaution in 1940 as he had become a vociferouscritic of Great Britain. Described as ‘mentally deranged’ in one recentlydeclassified report, it was believed he was about to head off to India to workon anti-British propaganda. Philby had become highly critical of British policyin the Middle East after working in the civil service in India (where he metVivian) and later the British administration of Iraq. In 1930, he had convertedto Islam and become an adviser to the Saudi king, Ibn Saud. Harry Philby wasinterned for a year and released in March 1941.5 Many years later, when it became clear Philby had defected to the Sovietsfrom Beirut, a sense of delayed shock permeated throughout the hallowed halls ofBritish Intelligence. Ken and Peggie Benton were having drinks with a formerhead of the MI6 Political Section. Mrs Benton suggested Philby’s defectionshould be made to look like a triple cross – that he was still secretly workingfor the British – that he was still in contact with the British Embassy. Thediplomat said that the Russians would shoot him. ‘Yes,’ Mrs Benton replied, ‘andserve him bloody right.’"},{"pageContent":"10SKY FALL [contents.htm#a13]Mr. Churchill made his statement. They heard him at first with incredulity, thenwith rapturous delight. Not a man there but assumed that the war was over, not aman but felt that Europe now to be suffused with the unearthly radiance of a newdawn, not a man but read in the fortuitous apprehension of a single mountebank,the rescue of civilization, justice and the pound sterling.Peter Fleming, ‘The Flying Visit’Horoscope ‘lured’ Hess to Britain: Rudolf Hess was lured to Britain in 1941 by aplot thought up by the late Ian Fleming, then in naval intelligence involvingthe planting of an astrologer on the susceptible Deputy Führer.Peter Hopkirk, The Times, 15 September 1969It was a fall from the sky that should not have surprised anybody.Several people heard the plane circling. Of this, there is little doubt. Themoment its single occupant hurled himself from the cockpit, however, thecertainties evaporate. Many strange and surreal discrepancies suffuse thehistorical record concerning exactly what happened on the late evening ofSaturday, 10 May 1941 high above the lowlands of Scotland, just south ofGlasgow.It was the night of the full moon and an appropriately ghostly sheen of lightaccompanied the events which would shortly unfold. After flying for over fourhours, shortly after 10.30 p.m. a twin-engine German fighter-bomber continued onits way westwards after crossing the Northumberland coast. Eventually circlingover Renfrewshire, the pilot, it is sometimes said, was looking for some sort oflanding site. In reality, he had known all along that he would have to make aparachute drop. Home defence radar had indeed spotted the enemy aircraft (but itwas never followed by scrambled RAF fighters, as is sometimes claimed, defendingthe nearby port and city). Nor was the aircraft shot down. Nor was there awelcoming, waiting committee for the bedraggled pilot.It was left to a handful of unprepared local Home Guard soldiers to arrest theparachutist. He didn’t speak a word of English, so accounts that he told themhis aim – to speak directly to the Duke of Hamilton – can be dismissed, too. Infact, it wasn’t until the wee small hours of the next morning that aninterpreter could be found, by which time it had slowly dawned on others thatthe beetle-browed parachutist was a high-ranking Nazi.It is now that the mysteries about Rudolf Hess’s unexpected arrival mushroomwith myths, rumour and ridiculously silly speculation. Consider the following,for example. That Hess’s arrival was propelled as part of a peace-feelingoperation orchestrated directly by mysterious, secretive Establishment figures –including the Royal Family. That somewhere along the way he was replaced by adoppelgänger, or in his subsequent imprisonment he was either murdered orcommitted suicide. All, or variations on them, are regularly repeated as fact.But, so far as this narrative is concerned, perhaps the most piquant of all isone that is now routinely trotted out over the Internet: that Rudolf Hess waslured to Great Britain by an intelligence sting prompted by his belief inastrology, a compulsion that had been expertly stoked by none other than acharacter already encountered in this narrative. Whether the newly promotedCommander Ian Fleming of Naval Intelligence had indeed prompted this real lifeSkyfall or not, the events surrounding Hess’s arrival were such that, in thewords of one contemporary newspaper, ‘a man from Mars would cause scarcely moreastonishment’.images [images/icon.jpg]By the first few days of May 1941, as noted in the chapter before last, anynumber of strange activities had been taking place within Whitehall with regardto astrology. With the immediate threat of invasion receding, howevertemporarily, Great Britain was in a far stronger position than it had been sincethe outbreak of the war twenty months earlier. Adolf Hitler, too, was welladvanced with his plans to invade the Soviet Union, and needed some greatersecurity before turning East. As the late historian and politician Alan Clarksuggested, exploring the possibilities of a peace treaty at this time would havenot been such an odd concept. Writing in The Times in January 1993, Clarksuggested that this represented a missed opportunity.Rudolf Hess, in Clark’s analysis, came to barter just such a peace deal but hismission was hushed up by Winston Churchill, who saw what he termed ‘the domesticdangers’. The prime minister would not talk to the German emissary1 and, inClark’s estimation, ‘repressed (in conspiracy with the whole Establishment) thedocuments’ which would prove it. This is just one of many wrinkles on the themeof a cover-up which continues today.Even allowing for such a revisionist backdrop, it is now clear that in May 1941there were some peculiar operations taking place within the secret war. Wearinghis army captain’s uniform, Louis de Wohl was being consulted by variousbranches of military intelligence about the use of astrology in prosecuting war;the Special Operations Executive had started to place strange rumours aboutAdolf Hitler’s own use of astrology in newspapers all the world over; but mostimprobable of all, there was already a published scenario which concerned thelanding of a German leader in England and how such an event would be hushed upby the relevant authorities.Even in wartime, Peter Fleming was a prolific writer.The previous spring, after his return from Norway, he had succumbed,‘appropriately enough’ as he later described it, to German measles. Whilerecovering at home on the Fleming family estate, he penned a gloriouslysatirical novel called The Flying Visit, which, in view of events in the springof 1941, is worthy of examination.In so many ways, the Squire of Nettlebed was astonishingly prescient.The novel tells an all-too plausible story of Adolf Hitler, wanting to gloatover his victory over the British, taking part in a Luftwaffe raid over London.A time bomb, disguised as a thermos flask, brings his particular aircraft down.2The Führer is the sole survivor. He parachutes down into the Chilterns, the areawhich the Fleming brothers knew very well from their childhood, where he thentries to make contact with the various politicians who are more likely to wantto sue for peace.At first, Adolf Hitler is hopeful. After coming across a woman in a cottage whomistakes him for a peddler and sets her dog on him (‘a loathsome littlemongrel’), he then tries to shoot himself (with blanks) and then comes across avillage hall in Oxfordshire, the kind of which the author also knew so verywell.This is by far the funniest part of the book. Peter Fleming describes completelystraight-faced how Adolf Hitler enters the back door of the village hall andwalks on to a brightly lit stage where he encounters a man in traditional Arabheadwear, after which ‘a gasp of astonishment and wonder’ comes from theaudience.The Führer then tries to make himself heard above the commotion:‘English men and women!’ he yelled. ‘It is I, Adolf Hitler, who stands beforeyou! I am not your enemy! You are not my enemies! We are not each other’senemies!’The audience screams, the Arab slaps him on the back and then he is promptlyhanded a pound of butter wrapped in a pale blue ribbon. ‘Baffled but beamingtoothily,’ the Führer bows his acceptance. Slowly it dawns on him that he hasactually taken part in a fancy dress competition. When the clapping subsides, henotices an Ancient Briton, a pierrot and an apache and then, as he tries to makeanother speech, a blonde woman dressed as a Rheinmaiden flings her arms aroundhis neck and kisses him.‘Sweety-pie!’ she screams. ‘You’re wonderful!’The blonde eventually takes him into custody. Like Wag The Dog, many yearshence, what follows is a splendid piece of satire on official secrecy. TheBritish government is thrown into absolute confusion. Adolf Hitler’s capturecannot be announced as Whitehall suspects that the Nazis will have adoppelgänger ready and waiting in the wings. When an American newspapermanbreaks the story, the British authorities have no alternative but to parachutehim back to the Fatherland, a policy, Peter Fleming notes, ‘of constructivenegotiation’.images [images/icon.jpg]If something odd was ever going to happen involving a high-ranking Nazi leader,it would have to coincide with a full moon. On the evening of Saturday, 10 May1941, when the lone parachutist was reported to have landed close by a farmhousenear to Glasgow, at first it seemed a curious counterpoint to the unremittinglyawful news about the progress of the war that month.Iraq had declared for the Germans; Vichy had endorsed an important agreementwith Hitler; the Germans had invaded Crete and HMS Hood had been sunk offGreenland. That same Saturday night, the Blitzkrieg had nearly destroyed theHouse of Commons in one of the heaviest air raids of the war. The reports fromScotland were at first confused, but when this mysterious figure was revealed asnone other than Rudolf Hess, there was general incredulity. Weekending atChequers, the country home where he went to avoid bombing raids in fullmoonlight, the prime minister’s reaction was typical.‘Even if it is Hess, I am going to watch the Marx brothers,’ Winston Churchillsaid as he strolled into his private cinema.And it is fair to say, what happened next reads like a script from one of theirfilms. The strange coincidences and odd events have all combined to create anenduring series of conspiracy theories that refuse to be resolved even today.Many are regularly repeated in newspaper accounts and trotted out as fact inspurious interpretations of the historical record. The reality is often far moresurprising than some of these more excited speculations.images [images/icon.jpg]Far from being orchestrated by the Secret Intelligence Service, Rudolf Hess’sarrival seems to have actually raised Sir Stewart Menzies’s blood pressure.Certainly, from the tenor of exasperation in the notes the chief of MI6dispatched in the immediate aftermath, it is clear that there was hardly awaiting welcoming committee organised by ‘the secret services’ for the DeputyFührer. Amazing as it seems to posterity, a handful of Home Guards detained himin a number of remote Scout huts for four hours until he was transferred to theMaryhill Barracks in Glasgow.The apprehension of Hess, then known only as Captain Horn, involved such alitany of blunders that even with the fragments of evidence available in the UKNational Archives it is clear there had been one cock-up after another. Far frombeing on alert (as is sometimes claimed) the authorities were so unprepared thatthe only translator they could find who spoke German sufficiently well was aPolish official from the local Glaswegian consulate.‘It seems incredible,’ C himself later thundered, ‘that this should have beenpermitted.’What is also clear is that the events of these first few hours – so crucial inany investigation – were woefully mishandled. The characters involved and thedecisions they made put the satiric nature of Peter Fleming’s exuberant fictionto shame. What is also immediately apparent is that they were far moreinterested in covering their own backs before they actually did anything. Thispartly explains why Rudolf Hess was not interrogated until three o’clock thefollowing morning.Later that same Sunday morning, the Duke of Hamilton was introduced to RudolfHess, whom the German claimed he had met before the war. The duke – who plays acurious role in this passage – could not remember any such a meeting. Inprivate, the Deputy Führer explained that he had arrived ‘on a mission ofhumanity and that the Führer did not want to defeat England and wished to stopthe fighting’.C followed the case quite closely but he insisted that Rudolf Hess should betreated in a very British way. ‘He will be given no mysterious drugs – if suchexist – to sap his will,’ Sir Stewart minuted his colleagues. ‘There will be noracks, no thumbscrews, no third degree nor the threat of them.’ Significantly,Hess was kept under lock and guard by military personnel, not representatives ofBritish Intelligence as is sometimes claimed in the more febrile accounts of histime in Scotland.images [images/icon.jpg]Perhaps the most telling reaction took place in Cairo that same weekend.Hermione, the Countess of Ranfurly, was working as confidential secretary to thehead of the Special Operations Executive in the Middle East, where her fearsomereputation was such that, as one of her obituaries later put it, she was ‘thekind of woman for whom words such as pluck and spirit might have beeninvented’.3 At some point, she told an important visitor from England about thenews when he happened to be in her office. He looked up, amazed.‘For a moment, I thought she was joking,’ Peter Fleming recalled. ‘You see Iwrote a book about that not long ago,’ he told her, ‘it is called The FlyingVisit.’And in another of those strange coincidences which sometimes bedevilcontroversial aspects of history, Jock Colville, the prime minister’s privatesecretary, happened to have been reading The Flying Visit at the same time. Sowhen it was reported that a senior German had landed, Colville was sure, as helater recorded, ‘that either Hitler or Göring [had] arrived’.A few days later, Peter Fleming’s old newspaper, The Times, ran an editorialcalled – almost inevitably – ‘The Flying Visit’, which mentions a literaryflight of fancy, published the previous year by a well-known young member of itsown staff, calling the event something which had ‘staggered the world’.And then various speculations began in earnest.Did nature imitate art? Or was Peter Fleming party to what would happen? Hadsomething along these lines been planned all along? Was British Intelligenceinvolved? Though the answers to all these questions were a resounding ‘no’, itneither stopped the speculation then nor today as the theories became ever moreelaborate. Peter Fleming later maintained the resemblance to his story wassuperficial and, over the years, it has become another enduring myth that hisyounger brother was also involved in bringing Hess over to the British Isles.One can imagine the Fleming brothers had a good giggle about it. Small wonderthat mysteries, myths and urban legends accumulated in Hess’s wake, not least inNazi Germany and the Soviet Union, where most struck a resonance with thehigh-ups’ favourite bogeyman: the British Secret Service and its supposedoccultic powers and omniscience.images [images/icon.jpg]Within days, the press started to speculate about the reasons behind RudolfHess’s arrival. The same weekly publication for German and Austrian émigrés, DieZeitung, which had carried the whispers surrounding Adolf Hitler’s death, nowpronounced on his deputy’s arrival in the British Isles. Twelve days later anarticle headed ‘Astrology in Hitler’s Service’ claimed that within Hess’sministerial purview was a department called AMO (concerning Astrology,Metapsychology and Occultism) from which Nazi astrologers ‘sent articles tonewspapers all over the world in order to prepare public opinion for events uponwhich Hitler wants attention to be focussed’.Certainly, the AMO didn’t exist and neither did this mysterious astrologer (noris there any evidence of the submission of articles into the US press by Germanastrologers). Walter Tschuppik’s report suggested Hess’s flight on 10 May camefrom that supposedly unusual conjunction of planets in Taurus which Louis deWohl and others had already noted. Like Adolf Hitler, the article claimed RudolfHess had his own astrologer, particularly because the Führerastrologe haddisappeared – probably arrested – and had been replaced by someone of whom allthat was known was he had ‘daemonic dark eyes and black hair brushed back overhis head’.Though not mentioned by name, it was clear this was meant to be Karl Krafft, theastrologer who had been named in various papers as being close to Adolf Hitler.In reality, by this point in the war, Krafft had already been effectivelyconfined for the best part of a year, though he was eventually allowed someleeway. Although Krafft had previously suggested at a public meeting there wasthe imminent possibility of ‘large-scale military operations in the East’ beforethe invasion of the Soviet Union, the Gestapo did nothing.It seems they didn’t have to.Karl Krafft was soon a virtual prisoner in a Propaganda Ministry building inBerlin, where he was believed by some – expertly fed by Louis de Wohl – to becasting the horoscopes of Allied leaders and generals. That way, his‘predictions’ could be tinkered with for political warfare purposes. Sometime in1942, Krafft would eventually suffer a nervous breakdown and refuse to do anymore work, despite Goebbels’s supposed enthusiasm for using the occult forvarious misinformation purposes.‘We are really getting somewhere,’ the propaganda chief wrote in his diary for19 May 1942. ‘The Americans and English fall easily for that type of thing. Weare therefore processing into our service all the experts we can find on occultprophecies etc. Nostradamus must once again submit to being quoted.’images [images/icon.jpg]So why had the Deputy Führer flown to Britain?Rudolf Hess later admitted in all seriousness that ‘the idea had been inspiredin him in a dream by supernatural force’. Within a few days, a party lineemerged from the Nazi leadership that he had been disastrously influenced byastrologers and hypnotists. ‘The extent to which these people are responsiblefor the mental confusion that led him to his present step still has to beclarified,’ the Völkischer Beobachter announced four days later. It was widelysupposed that one or other of them had advised Hess about a suitable date forhis departure.In view of some of the later claims that the Führer had dispatched him on apeace mission, Adolf Hitler, too, was simply incredulous that his deputy woulddo such a thing. Albert Speer was standing outside the Führer’s study when heheard ‘an inarticulate, almost animal outcry’. (Hess told Speer many years laterwhen they were both imprisoned in Spandau about that supernatural dream).General Franz Halder, the Chief of Staff of the Supreme High Command, noted inhis contemporary diaries that the ‘Führer was taken completely by surprise byHess’s flight’, and at the time the general speculated that Hess had been drivenby ‘some mystical sense of mission’. Others who were staying at the Berghof thatfateful weekend recorded the dismay and confusion which resulted. Hitler’sformer lawyer and Governor of Poland, Hans Frank, later noted that he had notseen the Führer so upset since the death of his beloved niece Geli, ten yearsearlier, itself a subject of much prurient speculation.More significantly for this story, when Josef Goebbels heard what happened toHess, he termed it ‘dreadful news, a hard almost unbearable blow’. Thepropaganda minister also found the Führer crushed and in tears. Within a fewdays, an official communiqué noted that Hess had flown as part of a ‘personalinitiative’, the result of a mental aberration prompted by ‘a host ofmagnetotherapists and astrologers’, though the original translation of theGerman was actually ‘mesmerists’.As a result, in Nazi Germany astrologers now became marked men.What became known as the Aktion Hess now gave the Gestapo the wherewithal toarrest many hundreds whose malign influence – ‘astrologers, fortune-tellers andother swindlers’, in Martin Bormann’s phrase – was suspected. That same day, TheTimes reported from Switzerland that ‘close friends’ had said that Hess wasHitler’s secret astrologer. The most mystic of the golden pheasants, HeinrichHimmler, was, by all accounts, particularly bemused.Within a month, the secret police had cast its net much wider with the arrest ofChristian scientists, faith healers and even psychologists and psychotherapistswithout formal medical training. Most astrologers, it should be noted, werereleased within a few days. Particular interest was shown towards ErnstSchulte-Strathaus, who had been on Hess’s staff at the Munich Brown House (thenational headquarters of the Nazi Party) since 1935 and was a keen amateurastrologer. By the spring of 1941, he was actually in charge of theChancellery’s cultural/political office and not Hess’s astrological adviser, assome accounts suggest.His closeness to Hess meant that Schulte-Strathaus was one of the first to beinterrogated. Yet he stated after the war that not only did he not foist hisviews on Hess, he never warned him that 10 May should be a suitable day fordeparture. Whether the Gestapo found any evidence for astrological prophecies isnot known, but it seems Schulte-Strathaus had made a comment in January 1941that the ‘Major Conjunction’ (the presence of six planets in one sign of thezodiac, Taurus) would take place on 10 May 1941 and coincide with the full moon.But that was all. Schulte-Strathaus had also joked that the Earth might welltilt on its axis as a result. He would languish in prison until 1 March 1943 forthis astrologically incorrect jest. Public performances or lectures on anythingvaguely alluding to the occult, spiritualism, clairvoyancy, telepathy orastrology were soon banned throughout the Third Reich. By October 1941, editorswere instructed not to publish anything on such topics. The zodiacal wheel hadcome full circle by late November, when a Party edict asked functionaries toread recent articles in Die Weitliteratur which described the campaign againstastrologers, anthroposophists, clairvoyants and occultists.In the immediate aftermath of Hess’s flight, more than one astrologer foundthemselves imprisoned and incommunicado. Many were asked the ultimate pointedquestion which came from SS Headquarters in Berlin: ‘Suppose that a negro, a Jewand an Aryan were all born on the same day and at the same time, would you makeidentical predictions?’ That some interrogators knew as much as their suspectsis also borne out by the recollection of one astrologer held in Breslau by theGestapo. It led to a farcical exchange with his questioner.‘What are your aspects like at this time?’ the Gestapo man asked.The astrologer hesitantly replied that Uranus was close to his Ascendant and thesun was transiting his Saturn.‘In which house?’ The Gestapo man’s eyes narrowed.‘The ninth.’The astrologer detected the merest flicker of a smile opposite. ‘Then at themoment nothing should surprise you.’images [images/icon.jpg]There was, however, one peculiar intelligence dimension to the arrival of RudolfHess in Great Britain.It all began with a conversation that the Deputy Führer had had the previousautumn with one of his oldest advisers. Though many mysteries remain about whathad happened in Bad Godesburg in September 1940, it certainly does point to ahalf-hearted British disinformation campaign that, ultimately, was cancelledbefore Hess had even considered taking off. Yet it does suggest that there wassome sort of back channel being established by British Intelligence to allowassociates of the Deputy Führer to communicate directly with MI5. By any stretchof the imagination, though, it was hardly an earth-shattering mechanism that‘lured’ Rudolf Hess to Britain. It involved a strange coincidence, a postcardand an elderly widow in Cambridge.Professor Karl Haushofer had once been one of Hess’s teachers at university andcame up with the notion of lebensraum, the need for living space that providedan intellectual justification (of sorts) for Germanic expansion. Haushoferheaded the Institute of Geopolitics which, in Nazi Germany, represented a bravenew world of academic self-interest. In thanks for his support over the years,Rudolf Hess had appointed him president for life of the council that dealt withGerman citizens who lived abroad. The Deputy Führer was also close to his son,Albrecht, a scholar, musician and playwright who spoke English like a native.Almost inevitably, Haushofer Junior became an adviser to the Nazis about Englishaffairs.Significantly, Albrecht Haushofer had met the Duke of Hamilton at the OlympicGames in Berlin in 1936. Like Hess, the then Lord Clydesdale had been a pre-waraviator of some note. The duke’s relationship with the Haushofers was unclear.And though even at the time Hamilton was suspect in many people’s eyes becauseof his pro-peace sympathies, the fact the Deputy Leader of the Third Reichturned up in the middle of the night asking to make contact with him caused hima great deal of embarrassment. He issued any number of libel writs againstjournalists, the first, rarely remarked on, a few weeks later in 1941 when theCommunist Party of Great Britain suggested he was behind Hess’s arrival. Sincehis death in 1973, historians have no longer feared his litigation and, more tothe point, his son James Douglas-Hamilton, himself a historian, has writtenextensively and usefully on the subject. Indeed, the younger Hamilton has shed agreat deal of light on the connections between his father and the Haushofers.So it was that on the last day of August 1940, Rudolf Hess summoned KarlHaushofer. This was the culmination of the discussions which had followed in thewake of the Führer’s peace offering that had been roundly rejected a few weeksearlier. This, as we saw in Chapter 8, prompted Adolf Hitler to jest that heshould head over to Great Britain in person. The belief that there were elementsin Britain who wanted to overthrow Churchill remained potent. Its politicalramifications were now delegated to Hess and the two Haushofers. The DeputyFührer confided in his mentor that Great Britain would seek peace and discussedthe matter with him for over eight hours.Both father and son became involved in the matter. A few days later, HaushoferJunior wrote to urge him to ‘stop something which would have such infinitelymomentous consequences’. As a result, Albrecht himself went to see Hess.Describing the Führer in British terms as ‘a representative of Satan on Earth’,he suggested certain Britons who would be amenable to peace. And Albrecht wouldknow. Unknown at the time, the younger Haushofer was a member of the growingresistance against the Nazi regime. Peace, even with Nazis in power, was betterthan continued slaughter.Yet from the outset both Karl and Albrecht Haushofer knew how difficult it wouldbe to make contact with any British peace element. On 8 September 1940, Albrechtdrew up a memo that he and Rudolf Hess discussed in Bad Godesberg which remainsin the files: ‘ARE THERE STILL POSSIBILITIES OF A GERMAN-ENGLISH PEACE.’ Theirdiscussion, too, took many hours and, at the conclusion, Albrecht suggested thathe meet on neutral soil ‘with the closest of my English friends, the young Dukeof Hamilton, who has access at all times to all important persons in London,even to Churchill and the King’.It was not every day that a letter arrived from England, in this case from thedaughter-in-law of a former Viceroy of India, whose son had been killed in 1937.Violet Roberts was the widow of that unfortunate Cambridge professor ofgeography who, in the years since her husband’s death, occasionally correspondedwith his friend Karl Haushofer. When a letter or postcard (it is not clearwhich) from her turned up in the post that September which suggested he stay incontact via a Lisbon post office box, it was not just a bolt from the blue.It was taken as a sign of providence.In fact, the letter was most likely sent at the behest of British Intelligence.It transpired that Mrs Roberts’s nephew, Walter, worked for SO1, the part of SOEthat dealt with propaganda (and would shortly be hived off into the PWE). Whenreference to this letter was discovered in the British archives in 1999, itsuggested there had been some sort of intelligence conspiracy. The only problemwith this interpretation is that the files clearly show how half-hearted it allwas and went no further. Certainly, the dispatch of this letter was more likelya mirror image of what the Haushofers were doing. The British propagandists wereprobing to see if they could string the Nazis along. If the propaganda effortcould show that there was, indeed, a sizeable peace movement, the notion wouldbe implanted that the Third Reich would not need to invade. It would only be amatter of time before the appeasers took over again.As always, the golden pheasants got hold of the wrong end of the stick.In Albrecht Haushofer’s recollection, his desire to make contact with his oldfriend the Duke of Hamilton was because the German leaders were sure he haddirect access to the king, confirming that odd Nazi view which had prompted thefarce in trying to kidnap the Duke of Windsor a few months before. It was agreedthat in reply they would use ‘the old lady with whom you are acquainted’, asHess described it. In reality, Albrecht was soon telling his father that ‘thewhole thing is a fool’s errand’.A few days later, a polite letter was dispatched via Lisbon by Hess’s brother inwhich indeed Albrecht Haushofer offered to meet ‘my dear Douglo’ in a neutralcountry. When it was intercepted by British censors – ironically, in view ofwhat later transpired – at the Ministry of Information it was, as a matter ofroutine, copied and sent to MI5 and the Foreign Office. Far from beingorchestrated by them, both the Security Service and the FO (which hadresponsibility for MI6) were ignorant of who had actually sent the letter.They let it pass, noting that ‘no doubt the Duke of Hamilton will be tickled todeath’ to receive a letter from Germany after three months. By February 1941,the duke was summoned to a meeting at the Air Ministry in London. At first, hethought this interest referred to a letter he had received in 1939 fromHaushofer warning of war, which he had copied and showed to Chamberlain andChurchill. Another meeting a month later saw MI5 representatives ask the duke togo to the meeting in Lisbon. Hamilton was very, very reluctant, even though itwas pointed out to him that he could claim plausible deniability in case thingswent wrong. Several people who were party to this proposed meeting were surethat, as one of them later said, it was actually a non-starter.Far from involving a high-level conspiracy, there was a farcical cock-up: afterthe protracted moving of files from MI5’s temporary headquarters at WormwoodScrubs following on from the fire that destroyed much of the service’s archivesthe previous October, the original letter from Germany had been lost ormisfiled. And, more germane to this story, by now it was six months since theinitial correspondence had been dispatched. It was going to be very hard toexplain why Hamilton had taken so long to reply. Eventually, the authorities sawsense: in a letter sent to the duke on 3 May 1941, an Air Ministry official,Group Captain Blatchford, informed the duke to stand down, noting, with masterlyunderstatement, that sending a reply ‘might not carry conviction and so haveundesirable consequences’.It certainly did a week later for the Haushofers.Two days after Rudolf Hess’s flight, Karl Haushofer was arrested. WalterSchellenberg could report to his superiors that the Deputy Führer had been‘influenced by agents of the British Secret Service and their Germancollaborators’. At the time, even German statements suggested that he could havebeen lured into a trap as ‘Hess has for years suffered physically’, the NaziParty noted, ‘and increasingly took refuge in various forms of hypnotism andastrology etc.’images [images/icon.jpg]Equally intriguing – and infinitely more revealing – is the role of anothercharacter in British Intelligence whom some have suggested supposedly inveigledastrologers into Hess’s immediate circle to spread the very rumours whichprompted his flight. If so, such a notion would hardly compare with theextravagant plots of his later fictional writings or their transfer to thesilver screen.Did Ian Fleming have a hand in bringing over Rudolf Hess?Given the interest of the Naval Intelligence Division in astrology, it wouldhardly seem out of place. That was certainly the view of one of his post-warcolleagues, Donald McCormick, who, towards the end of his life, enjoyed makingodd claims about his illustrious former colleague which are also now routinelyreported as fact. Writing as Richard Deacon, he first aired the theory fiveyears after Ian Fleming’s death, in his history of the British Secret Service(where he also ascribed the numerals 007 to Dr John Dee).McCormick’s suppositions in the late sixties had the advantage that most oftheir wartime colleagues were still alive and could comment on this new theory.All, it should be noted, denied the idea that Ian Fleming had lured Rudolf Hessto Britain. As time went on, however, McCormick continued to rehash the sameideas – even though they had been denied – and added odd flourishes and toucheswhich he ascribed to the very same people who had dismissed his ideas in thefirst place.By then, in the early 1990s, most had long since died.Perhaps the kindest comment to be made about Donald McCormick is that he wasprolific. In a penetrating, pioneering analysis of the author’s way of working,the thriller writer Jeremy Duns has provided irrefutable evidence that McCormicksimply made things up. In various biographies of such historical figures as LordKitchener and Jack the Ripper, for example, McCormick clearly peppered thenarratives with ‘uncheckable and bogus documents and statements’.So it was with his various statements about Dr John Dee4, Ian Fleming and othersin his various writings about the British Secret Service. The odd thing was thatFleming clearly liked McCormick personally, for his fellow author was clearly alikeable rogue, a flavour of which may be discerned from the headline to hislater obituary from The Guardian in March 1998: ‘Spooks, bars and brothels’.They had originally met in the Barbizon Plaza Hotel in New York. DonaldMcCormick later worked for Fleming as a foreign correspondent when the latterwas running the Kemsley newspaper foreign news operation (during which timeseveral others in his immediate circle still wondered if he was working as aspook). McCormick had served in the Royal Navy during the war and had beeninvolved in intelligence, famously writing a guide to spies in Algiers whichfocussed on the dangers of brothels in the kasbah.A revealing anecdote about his working methods came in the late fifties. DonaldMcCormick was confronted by another author about the inconsistencies andprovable forgeries in the Richard Deacon book about the death of Lord Kitchener.McCormick admitted with a sly wink that whoever was behind it was ‘a very cleverman who enjoys his quiet fun’.That, perhaps, is how Donald McCormick should better be remembered.So far as this narrative is concerned, a much more malign legacy stems from hisaffectionate, though very peculiar biography of Ian Fleming, 17F, published in1993. Once again, Donald McCormick rehashed many of the basic elements of his‘Hess lured by 007 author’ story from the late sixties with new, amazing twists:that Rudolf Hess was lured to Scotland by means of forged astrological charts,as well as mysterious meetings in Portugal and Switzerland, curious emissariesand a ‘chief astrological adviser Ernst Schulte-Strathaus’, who in 1969, theformer PWE executive Ellic Howe had already clarified in a letter to The Times,‘merely talked to [Hess] occasionally about astrology’.Nevertheless, McCormick’s newly embellished account carries another weirdlyplausible invention: that Peter Fleming’s The Flying Visit was part of thegrander deception, ‘doubtless seeing it as a possible means of signalling to theGermans that the British might think if someone were lured to Britain – if notHitler or Hess, then possibly Canaris.’ For as we will see, the notion that thehead of the Abwehr would also be orchestrated to meet his British equivalents isanother story that has grown in recent years – and been ascribed to the literarycreator of 007.images [images/icon.jpg]It is significant that the first public airing of the ‘my brother lured Hess toBritain’ story was vehemently denied by not only Peter Fleming but his brother’sold pre-war sparring partner, Tom Delmer, who was also involved in trying toexploit propaganda value from the Deputy Führer’s arrival in 1941. On the eve ofpublication of Deacon’s history of the secret service, a story in The Times on15 September 1969 picked up on Delmer’s thoughts about Ian Fleming’sinvolvement.‘As an idea, inducing Hess to fly to England by means of astrologicalhocus-pocus – and the bait of the Duke of Hamilton – was something that mighthave appealed to Ian Fleming or even to have been conceived by him,’ Delmer wasquoted as saying in Peter Hopkirk’s story. ‘I am quite ready to believe that.’But crucially, he added that the details were unconvincing.‘It is all too pat and does not fit the fact that the flight on 10 May was notHess’s first attempt to fly to Britain.’In fact, Hess had made three earlier attempts, prompted by his growing sensethat he was being sidelined within the Nazi hierarchy. Many of the peopleinterviewed by The Times were clearly reticent. A certain circumspection wasexpected with regard to the duke (who did not die for another four years), whowas notoriously litigious so far as the Hess story was concerned.Nevertheless, Peter Fleming was more succinct. Ian had never told him about sucha mission, calling it ‘a new legend about my brother’ and leaving it at that.But Donald McCormick was never one to leaving anything at that at all.His later biography of Ian Fleming (dismissed in one contemporary review as‘unoriginal and inaccurate’) claimed to have discovered new and exciting plotsinvolving his old wartime friend. The reality was that many of those same newdetails were very silly exaggerations which took the basic facts of an alreadysurreal story into something else entirely. Namely, that James Bond’s creatordidn’t just approach Aleister Crowley, but together they concocted the use ofboth magic and astrology to lure Rudolf Hess across the Channel in the firstplace.images [images/icon.jpg]Ultimately, the conspiracies surrounding Rudolf Hess’s arrival in Scotland owemuch of their potency to the fact the man himself never really made much senseas to why he had done so. On every side of the fighting – in London, Berlin andMoscow – everyone in a position of power was completely baffled by his suddenappearance over Scotland. In truth, Hess rarely made sense about anything,especially at his trial for war crimes at Nuremberg after the war. Many of therumours emanate from the immediate crackdown on public speculation about hisflight on both sides of the fighting in 1941.With characteristic boldness, Sefton Delmer suggested at the time – against theexpress wishes of C – that Hess should be injected with a truth drug. ‘That’snot done, not in this country,’ said one of his superiors, who was visiblyshocked. Then, as later, Delmer was puzzled as to why no greater politicalcapital was made of the flying visit by Captain Horn, treating him as some sortof Trojan Horse.Delmer, characteristically, decided on a far more subtle approach.He asked for a false page from the Völkischer Beobachter to be made up. This, itwas hoped, would make Hess reveal what he was up to, having seen the (completelyfalse) public vituperation which had followed his departure. Even in hisconfused state, the Deputy Führer took umbrage and, irony of ironies, declaredhimself the victim of a conspiracy. In the weeks afterwards, Rudolf Hess refusedto eat or taste anything without somebody else tasting it first in his sight.By making no statements, it seemed that the government was hiding something. Ina recent review of the propaganda aspects to the story, Dr Jo Fox of DurhamUniversity also notes that ‘Hess’s arrival marked a deepening of pre-existingfissures between black and white propaganda units’. In fact, the ongoingstruggles between Hugh Dalton and Duff Cooper (the ministers responsible for theSOE and the Ministry of Information respectively) meant that they were sidelinedin the greater debate as to what to do about Hess. The Foreign Office became thepreferred conduit. As Dr Fox notes, the Hess affair sealed the fate of the MOIand Cooper’s ministerial career.And so, real life imitated Peter Fleming’s fiction. The British government woulddo and say nothing about the fate of the Deputy Führer. There was, to be sure, adelicate balance. If the British portrayed Hess as mad, then that would confirmthe German propaganda. If his peace offer was genuine, it played into Hitler’shands and made the British look warmongering. Goebbels – four days later –suggested a similar almost cod-British war movie stance: he instructed theGerman media ‘to keep a stiff upper lip, not to react, not to explain anything’.Into this breach stepped Gustav Siegfried Eins.Tom Delmer would never adhere to a party line. It was only twelve days afterHess’s arrival that his first subversive station started broadcasting blackpropaganda. To make it seem as though Der Chef had been broadcasting for awhile, he now implied that he knew Hess was going to do something ridiculous.His followers, he announced, should lie low, which had explained Der Chef’ssilence in the immediate aftermath.The danger, it seemed, had passed.‘First, let’s get this straight,’ Der Chef announced about the Deputy Führer,‘this fellow is by no means the worst of the lot. He was a good comrade of oursin the day of the Freikorps.’But soon, in Germany – as in Britain – Rudolf Hess became a non-person.So far as the public was concerned, he had disappeared off the face of theearth. No photograph was ever publicly produced of him during his imprisonment.As with Peter Fleming’s The Flying Visit, no evidence was ever revealed to showthe circumstances in which he had arrived. There were other rumours which almostinevitably followed: that he would head up a fifth column; that he had come toassassinate the prime minister, lunging at him with a poisoned ring. MI5 alsointercepted letters written to Hess – from cranks, pacifists and religiousextremists – and had to dissuade one press photographer from trying to find theelusive quarry. These rumours still persist today, but as Dr Fox has elegantlysummarised the circumstances: ‘Hess had come uninvited, so he was not an envoy;in uniform, so he was not a spy; unarmed, so not an assassin.’In another story that was circulating, MI5 learned that people were saying thatHess had come with a planeload of drugs and alternative therapies. And as MassObservation, a forerunner of today’s polling organisations, noted that August,‘people want to believe in something which at least appears to interpret eventsin the complex and dangerous civilization in which uneducated people findthemselves confused, worried, many of their certainties weakened.’And that certainly seems to be the case in the years since.If Hess himself thought he was the victim of a conspiracy, so do many others whohave looked into the story. Any number of even weirder and more wonderful‘explanations’ for why the deputy leader defected have been proposed over theyears. With the passing of time, the ‘theories’ have become ever more bizarre:that it wasn’t Hess who flew to Scotland but a double; that Reinhard Heydrichaccompanied him en route in his own fighter; that the British Home Defenceforces were forewarned and ordered not to shoot his aircraft down. The RoyalFamily has also been implicated – through the king’s brother, the Duke of Kent –as have aliens. The Omega File: Rudolf Hess and the Secret German Space Raceclaims he was murdered because he knew all about secret plans for a Nazi spacebase in the Antarctic.images [images/icon.jpg]In 2013, the historian Peter Padfield suggested that far from being a lone nut,Rudolf Hess had brought with him a detailed peace plan:5 that Britain wouldbecome neutral if Nazi Germany withdrew from Western Europe before turning east.This was the basis for recollections of an unnamed academic who helped translatethe document. ‘This was not a renegade plot,’ Mr Padfield noted at the time ofpublication. ‘Hitler had sent Hess and he brought over a fully developed peacetreaty for Germany to evacuate all the occupied countries in the West.’ As wellas learning of this supposed treaty and its contents, Mr Padfield claimed thathe learned salient details about the subsequent cover-up. According to hisaccount, two inventories of items carried by Hess when he was arrested afterlanding were made.Neither has, it seems, ever been released.Padfield found witness statements from a woman living near where Hess hadlanded, which indicate that police were ‘ordered to search for a valuabledocument which was missing’. The item, according to this lady, was discovered‘over near the wee burn in the park’.Further light may be shed on all these matters when, it is believed, a number offiles will be released into the public domain in 2017. While it is true thatthose already released have been weeded – and there are some who believe thishas been done to spare the blushes of relatives of important people – AdolfHitler’s reaction at the Berghof is telling. The fact that, in the months beforehis departure, Hess had been marginalised shows just how unimportant he was as afigure. Yet for many he has become a symbol of the iniquities of Westerncapitalism, ‘a tool for putting pressure at key moments in the war’, in oneassessment. The involvement of the Duke of Hamilton seemed to confirm anEstablishment cover-up. In the late spring of 1941, the arrival of Rudolf Hessnow certainly meant that he would become an unwilling – and unwitting – pawn ina far bigger game.images [images/icon.jpg]As is clear from the equally strange themes examined in this book – ofastrology, political warfare and misinformation – it is more than likely thatRudolf Hess accidentally got caught up in a disinformation campaign concerningpeace feelers and the potential removal of the king. The timing of his flight inMay 1941 was clearly linked to the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union,which occurred just six weeks later. Lord Beaverbrook said as much on severaloccasions after the war: others have speculated that Hess came with the news ofthe upcoming Russian campaign so that the British could ‘swap sides’ in thebattle against the Bolsheviks.Such a notion certainly had an appreciative audience behind the Iron Curtain.Even before the invasion of the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin was alert for plotsand peace talks between his two imperial foes, Britain and Germany. Soon, theNKVD (the forerunner to the KGB) was reporting what he wanted to hear. ‘Hessarrived in England with the full agreement of Hitler in order to begin talks fora truce,’ said one report from the United States to Moscow. ‘Because Hitlerfound it impossible openly to suggest a truce in view of the damage this wouldinflict on German morale, he selected Hess as his secret emissary.’Rumours were soon circulating around the Kremlin. The invariable party line camea few days later in Pravda, which noted that Britain was now ‘a haven forgangsters’. In Moscow, the notion quickly became established that the BritishSecret Service had somehow lured Hess to Britain. When, a year after the fall ofthe Berlin Wall, the author John Costello was allowed to see the relevant NKVDpapers, yet another variable came into play: that Hess was lured to Britain byMI6. This story has it that the Führer was only too well aware that his deputywanted to broker peace but only without injuring German prestige. Eighteenmonths later, in another account, Lavrenti Beria informed Stalin that it was dueto an MI6 plot; yet another account said it was ‘with full approval fromHitler’; and another suggested it was a conspiracy to make peace with Britainbefore the invasion of the USSR.Certainly, that was what Stalin wanted to believe.During a later wartime visit to Moscow, Churchill was astonished when Stalintoasted the health of the British Intelligence service which, he said, hadinveigled Hess into coming to England. ‘He could not have landed without beinggiven signals. The Intelligence service must have been behind it,’ said Stalin.Inadvertantly, the silence on the British side – as one historian has written –was ‘simultaneously inexplicable and disconcerting to the Russians [and]provided fertile grounds for a propaganda coup’. Others suggest that moremileage could have been made. If disinformation had inadvertently lured Hesstowards the UK, another disinformation campaign would now be directed eastwards.The main instrument for what had already been termed ‘running the Bolshevikhare’ involved a complicated game of black propaganda to have the Soviet Unionalter its views.The British ambassador, Sir Stafford Cripps, realised it was a ‘goldenopportunity’ to play or allay Stalin’s fears. ‘[The] Hess incident has no doubtintrigued the Soviet government quite as much as anybody else and may well havearranged their old fear of a peaceable deal at their expense,’ he wrote.Little actually came of Hess’s interrogation concerning Germany’s intentionstowards the Soviet Union – or any other matter. Despite questions being put tohim, the Deputy Führer provided nothing useful at all. At the time, though therewas a growing volume of intelligence that there was a build-up on the Sovietborder, it was only ever believed that this would give Adolf Hitler a morepowerful hand in negotiating with Stalin.On 23 May, MI6 was instructed via its Foreign Office masters that it shouldbegin ‘the exploitation of the Hess incident through underground channelsabroad’ to reiterate the folly of taking Hitler at face value. This obviouslyconcerned the peace pact between the two countries that had been signed inAugust 1939.Directives were sent to embassies in Stockholm, New York and Istanbul, to beadded to by whispering campaigns set into motion by the SOE and others. As many‘whispers as possible’ were to be directed towards the Soviet Union forthwith.Much of this information was already being forwarded by Kim Philby to his Sovietcontrollers. As a result, somewhere within this combustible brew of well-meaningconspiracy is the supposed unseen hand of British Intelligence. ‘The 18,000pages of documents on the Hess affair made available by [the UK NationalArchives], when read in conjunction with archival material of the RussianSecurity Services,’ notes Gabriel Gorodetsky, ‘reveal a deliberatedisinformation campaign carried out by British Intelligence which misfired andled to misinterpretations both at the time and subsequently.’6If it was, as several have postulated, a last-ditch attempt to broker peacebefore the invasion of the Soviet Union, it was a cack-handed one. In Turkey, aGerman assistant naval attaché told a local intelligence official (who thenrepeated it to an MI6 officer) that the real reason Rudolf Hess had flown wasbecause of his disagreements with Hitler over Balkan policy.There is certainly no smoking gun lurking in the files.Perhaps the most revealing detail is that when a contemporary report wascirculated within MI6 which had picked up the rumour that Hess had been broughtover ‘owing to a trap laid by the British Secret Service’, somebody had written‘A new one!’ in the margin.Rudolf Hess had become depressed – in his eyes because he had been deliberatelykept away from meeting the king, whom he believed was party to peace feelers –and shortly, with his move to a holding camp in Wales, his mental statedeteriorated even further. One psychiatrist diagnosed paranoia with a ‘morbidpersecution disillusional system’.There was clearly no way he could be exploited for propaganda purposes.In a final twist, in official MI6 papers released at the start of 2014, there isalso a sequence concerning a Daily Telegraph report from the time on thefinances of Rudolf Hess. It was alleged that he, like all other Nazi leaders,had somehow amassed enormous fortunes in various foreign banks. ‘Unless myofficers have been completely deceived by Hess,’ C himself recorded for the fileon 6 June 1941, ‘there is not the slightest probability in the story. He takesnot the slightest interest in financial matters, nor does he appear to have anyknowledge of business.’Nor, Sir Stewart Menzies added, were Hess’s clothes ‘those of a City magnate’.In another exchange with MI6, when it was asked by the Ministry of EconomicWarfare as to the provenance of the Deputy Führer’s clothes – presumably todetermine how well the German cotton industry was performing7 – Menzies notedthat they ‘were of the cheapest variety and might well have been purchased atMarks and Spencer’.images [images/icon.jpg]To add to the downright peculiarity of the mysteries, at this point theself-styled Beast now reared his head that late spring of 1941. Aleister Crowleywas far from having a good time of it having washed up on the English Riviera inTorquay. His tenancy agreement was up and he confessed to his diaries that anynotion of moving ‘may be upset at the moment by [a German] invasion [which]completes the picture of frustration’.Being passive, it seemed, was the only course of action available to him. He wasat a loose end, not so much dallying in the diabolical, but offering hisservices to anyone who would listen. But at the start of March came a curiousescapade concerning the Soviet entry into the war. ‘The sickle and Hammer havesimply GOT to come in somehow,’ he wrote on 1 March. And he suggested there wereastrological portents, ‘moving up to May 8’, which was yet another extraordinarycoincidence given the arrival of Hess around this time.The Beast’s scanning of the heavens had more to do with a more pressing worry.Even the English Riviera was not immune from air raids. Crowley was more than alittle put out to have suffered a bombing. As ever, a great deal of smoke covershis activities, for in several accounts he was either being watched or consultedby the secret services. There is, however, little evidence to support this. Inone account, he had been making repeated ‘madcap’ suggestions to MI5, includingthe dropping of occult literature over Germany to influence the Deutsches Volk.According to the more febrile reports based on Donald McCormick’s fabrications,Ian Fleming wanted to use Crowley (who was friendly with occultists on bothsides of the fighting) to entice a leading Nazi to Britain.As with all stories about the Great Beast, most remain speculation.After the arrival of Rudolf Hess, Fleming did suggest that Crowley beinterviewed at length. The personal representative of Admiral John Godfrey wasasked to interview the self-proclaimed Beast, leading to the surreal encounterwhich opens this book. Fleming had been invited to meet him in a curious,handwritten letter, which had arrived on the desk of the Director of NavalIntelligence bearing a Torquay postmark. According to some others, he did visitthe Beast in Devon: the evidence is not clear. Fleming certainly cherished theletter as one of the more peculiar correspondences from the whole time of hiswar. Ultimately, the Naval Intelligence Division, decided not to take up hisoffer of assistance, but that has never stopped some of the more peculiarstories from taking hold.images [images/icon.jpg]Amado Crowley, as he liked to call himself, claimed he was Aleister Crowley’sson. In fact he was an occultist whose real name was Andrew Standish, who had,it might be said in the politest of terms, a vivid imagination and yet looked alittle like the great man and suffered from asthma. Amado claimed that hisfather, Ian Fleming and others were involved in a strange escapade around thistime. This story is worth recounting as a wellspring for later rumours andweaves in several other names mentioned in connection with Rudolf Hess’sarrival. Many are all lumped together and routinely referred to in the morecredulous newspaper reports.Standish was certainly never in the immediate orbit of the great man himself.‘Amado claims in his book that Aleister taught him between the ages of seven andfourteen: i.e.1937–1944,’ notes one apologist for the self-styled Beast who wasmore likely to believe him. ‘If so, why isn’t there a single mention of thisvital matter in Crowley’s Diaries? There he records matters as trivial as thebreaking of a tooth or the quality of his dinner: but he does not see fit torecord meetings with an initiation of a son destined to be his successor.’Here, in all its preposterous glory, is what Andrew Standish claimed.One day in early 1940, a short while after war had broken out, three men came tovisit the Beast at his London home. Their appearance scored them for comedy: onewas small, another tall and a final one was fat. This corpulent fellow spokefirst.‘Mr Crowley, you must have heard of me,’ he said portentously. ‘My name is Louisde Wohl, the astrologer.’The world’s greatest necromancer was nonplussed.‘No,’ he replied, ‘I’m afraid it rings no bells.’If Amado Crowley’s account is to be believed, there followed an ill-temperedexchange, the result of two immense egos not just rubbing up against each otherbut rubbing each up the wrong way. His short and tall accomplices, who weresupposedly working for MI5, then asked Crowley what he could do for them. Therefollowed a Catch-22-type riddle: unless he signed the Official Secrets Act, theywouldn’t tell him; but Crowley wouldn’t sign anything unless they told him whatthis entailed. As an expert on German occultism, they reluctantly agreed to payhim money for help.According to Standish (who, it should be noted, was actually 10 years old at thetime) both he and his father signed the piece of paper. They were then taken toa heavily sandbagged building near Downing Street in which a number of seniorfigures were waiting. There then followed yet another bizarre conversation whereeveryone was given implausibly silly codenames. And then they were addressed bysomeone who had genuinely considered astrology as a weapon.‘You come highly recommended by a certain Mr Maxwell Knight, an important figurein the country’s secret services,’ said Admiral John Godfrey. ‘Mr Churchillsought his advice. Consequently, he has asked for you by name.’In this version of the story, using his specialist knowledge, Crowley would helptarget a Nazi leader susceptible to the occult and entice him to the UnitedKingdom. It was suggested that the Beast should meet two German officers – whoseparticipation had been arranged via the Romanian mission in London – and thatone of them was none other than Karl Haushofer, one of Hess’s leading advisers.Crowley père et fils, another admiral and Louis de Wohl then went down toTangmere Airport8 to meet the Germans, who had arrived by aircraft. To say itwent badly was an understatement. Their conversation came to an abrupt endingthat saw Crowley Senior giving a right uppercut to one of the Germans.The conclusion to an already bizarre story gets even more peculiar. Crowleyhosted a firework ceremony in Ashdown Forest, where people in occultic robesdanced. Pride of place was ‘a dummy dressed in Nazi uniform, being sat on athrone-like chair’, which was set on fire and then launched on a cable towardsGermany (it landed a few hundred yards away). The rest, as they say, is history.Aleister Crowley waited for the repercussions from this event and on 11 May 1941was simply informed that ‘the bird had flown’.images [images/icon.jpg]Despite the self-evidently silly nature of these reminiscences, Aleister Crowleymade quite an impression on Ian Fleming for other reasons. He was to store awaythe memory of Crowley’s gross physical characteristics – especially his hypnoticeyes – for over a decade, when they would make a dramatic appearance in the formof a high-stakes card game. A foreign spy’s appearance became a metaphor forvarious underhand activities in the form of strange physical disfigurements, atechnique which Ian Fleming would later use to great effect.There was clearly some precedent in the stories which Fleming had devoured inhis youth. Erskine Childers’s The Riddle of The Sands tells the story of twoessential duffers who somehow manage to foil a sinister German plot to invadeEastern England. Childers was an accomplished yachtsman who had made a number ofjourneys through the foggy, sand-banked Friesian Islands. It gave him the germof an idea for his pair of heroes – a man from the Foreign Office and hissidekick – who come across a profusion and prolixity of small boats. Eventuallythey realise that an invasion is planned when these boats will ‘traverse theNorth Sea and throw themselves bodily upon the English shore’.Our heroes in The Riddle Of The Sands are alert for scars and tics which are thetelltale signs of a dangerous enemy. The weal on arch villain von Brüning’sforehead, for example, indicates his inner conflict. ‘The Edwardian thrillercreates ways of representing the spy’s body that carry through the twentiethcentury,’ notes Professor Allan Hepburn. ‘Fear of invasion from without inChilders’s novel marks dangerous doubtlesness within the body politic and withinthe body itself.’ Given that Professor Hepburn’s mother was Audrey Hepburn, itcould be said he knows a thing or two about appearances.Ian Fleming simply carried on the tradition.In recent years, there has been a cottage industry of speculation about whoexactly the Bond villains were based upon. Fleming ascribed a similar guise asCrowley to Ernst Stavro Blofeld, whose dark hypnotic eyes were similar toMussolini’s.Fleming certainly appropriated that particular name from a fellow member ofBoodles, Tom Blofeld, who was also chairman of the Country Gentleman’sAssociation (and whose nephew is the noted cricket commentator Henry Blofeld).In the book of Thunderball where he makes his first appearance, Blofeld wasdescribed as a large former weightlifter (whose bulk had turned to fat, nowweighing 18 stone) whose sheer animal magnetism was also based on the author’sreaction to Aleister Crowley.Crowley had also provided the inspiration for a truly prototypical protagonistin Fleming’s first attempt at writing a thriller a few years earlier Thisalter-Crowley (or überbeast) would use a carpet beater to assault the testiclesof Fleming’s own alter ago, the spy whom he decided to give his old wartimerank, Commander RNVR.9 Le Chiffre and Casino Royale – along with all theliterary James Bond adventures – would have their origins in the strange wartimeworld in which Fleming had worked, providing them with a certain basis ofreality which others have, for other reasons, blown out of all proportions.10images [images/icon.jpg]The next step, for both Fleming personally and others encountered so far in thisstory, concerned the other side of the Atlantic. A few weeks after the surrealevents surrounding the arrival of Rudolf Hess, the newly promoted commander andhis boss, Admiral Godfrey, made their way incognito to the United States viaLisbon, where they made a visit to the nearby casino in Estoril. Much has alsobeen made of this singular event in the life of Admiral Godfrey’s fixer.To add to its lustre, Dusko Popov (double agent Tricycle, who was regularlyjourneying to and from Portugal), later claimed that Ian Fleming followed himaround the casino. The naval commander won a great deal of money from a foreignbraggart who apparently had annoyed him. Yet Fleming and Popov were never inLisbon at the same time, and Fleming would hardly have worn his uniform as hewas en route to New York on a delicate mission to be examined in the nextchapter. Dusko Popov never actually met Fleming until many years later. So howwould he have known the identity of the handsome Etonian?As with all wartime stories involving Ian Fleming, its telling and significancehave become convoluted, not least with a more recent suggestion of a fullyfledged ‘British spy ring’ in the United States which supposedly employedvarious unlikely Mata Haris and Hollywood stars.Yet the real story is even more remarkable.‘The British used ruthless methods to achieve their goals,’ one Americanreviewer marvelled when the official history of British Intelligence operationsin the Americas was published, ‘by [today’s] standards some of the activitiesmay seem outrageous.’ Certainly, one of the more remarkable charactersencountered so far would become involved in the story, that now moves across theAtlantic. A true humanitarian, of great power and energy – or so Louis de Wohlclaimed – would come to understand the dangers involved. ‘President Roosevelt’shoroscope is perfectly beautiful,’ he said that same summer of 1941. ‘He towersabove all others. A Yogi once told me a man born on the date Hitler came intopower would cause his downfall. Hitler rose to power on 30 January, and that isRoosevelt’s birth date.’NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 This discussion took place at a time when a certain strand of revisionism –called counterfactual reasoning – was then in vogue, particularly by youngerhistorians such as John Charmley and Andrew Roberts, whose biographies ofChurchill and Halifax (in 1993 and 1991 respectively) set the tone for suchdiscussions. The Charmley biography, Churchill: The End of Glory, prompted TheTimes piece by Alan Clark, which was not universally applauded for, as hisofficial biographer notes, many historians were dismissive, one going so far asto say that Clark was ‘an arrogant, self-centred man who talks bollocks’.In his commentary, Alan Clark noted that if peace had been made in the spring of1941, then Britain’s forces could have shored up the defences against Japan. Aninteresting discussion of what might have happened had the Nazis prevailed mayalso be found in Chapter 5, Hitler’s England in Virtual History, edited by NiallFerguson (especially pp. 291–6, Picador, 1997).2 A later real-life plot seasoned within the Abwehr, it should be noted, usedexactly this same device to attempt to kill Adolf Hitler. In March 1943, MajorGeneral Hans Henning von Tresckow decided to take precipitate action after theFührer visited the supreme headquarters on the Eastern Front. The general wouldplace a bomb aboard Adolf Hitler’s personal aircraft thanks to fellowconspirators from within the Abwehr who had provided what looked like twobottles of cognac that were actually British-made plastic explosives. But enroute from Smolensk to Rastenburg, the cold in the hold of the Junker froze thetimer mechanism which was set to explode in mid-flight. Adolf Hitler survived tofly again. The Cointreau bottles were retrieved on the ground by a decidedlyagitated von Tresckow. Unbeknown to him at the time, a few weeks before, armyofficers in Kharkov had independently decided to kill the Führer on a visitthere but he had changed his travel plans at the last moment.3 Hermione had gone to war with her husband, Dan, who was now a prisoner ofwar after having originally been posted to Palestine with their butler/cook,Whitaker. Her reminiscences, To War With Whitaker (Picador, 2001) are one of themore delightful diaries published in recent years concerning sometimesotherworldly stories of how the upper classes played their part. In one seniorofficial’s recollections, the Countess of Ranfurly knew everybody, everythingand was able to ‘outmanoeuvre every general in the Middle East’.4 My own researches into Dr John Dee for another project elicitedbewilderment from several respected scholars about his supposed use of thenumeral 007. Jeremy Duns quotes at length the academic Theresa Burns who haswritten about Dr Dee’s life most recently. ‘Yet for one who had studied much ofthe Dee material which has become available after 1968, Deacon’s book reads likea blurred excited rehashing of ideas slightly out of focus and in the service ofsomeone else’s ego; he footnotes here and there as if for kicks, referring toletters and legend one can find no record of, but weaving a story that is almostplausible.’5 Another ‘new’ theory appeared in 2010 with the claim of John Harris thatRudolf Hess was lured to Britain by MI6, using a Finnish art historian, TancredBorenius, who travelled to Geneva in January 1941. There he convinced the DeputyFührer that members of the Royal Family wanted to broker a peace deal with theNazi regime. Harris claimed that Borenius’s son, Lars, gave him the informationshortly before he died, further expounded in his book Rudolf Hess: The BritishIllusion of Peace (Jema Publications, 2010).6 In this quote, the original text refers to the Public Record Office as itwas written in 1999. Since then, all the relevant MI5 files have been released,which show the bewilderment of official agencies. There is a veritable pick andmix of theories as to which organisation was actually responsible. PeterPadfield (Hess: Flight for the Führer, 1991) and John Costello (Ten Days ThatSaved The West, 1991) suggested the XX Committee was behind it, while Hess: TheBritish Conspiracy by John Harris and M.J. Trow (1999) suggest the SpecialOperations Executive.7 There was also the related intelligence matter of the fact that RudolfHess’s father was a retired cotton merchant who now lived in Egypt, then underBritish control. The relevant security authority, SIME, based in Cairo, kept agimlet eye on him and all enemy émigrés in the country. When Mussolini haddeclared war the previous summer, all Italian property had been sequestrated andall Italian men interned. Their wives were left to fend for themselves, withsome turning, inevitably, to prostitution. There were also perhaps 1,000 Germansin and around Egypt, with a Nazi Auslandsabteilung in existence. The leader inAlexandria was an elderly cotton merchant, whom in one SIME report isrespectfully termed ‘Herr Hess, father of Rudolf’.8 In recent years, a curious story concerning the nearby Lympne airfield hascome to light. In early 1941, it seemed that Adolf Hitler’s own personal pilotwanted to defect and bring with him the Führer. The story began in Sofia, wherea man who claimed to be the brother-in-law of Hans Baur, the Führer’s personalpilot, told a military attaché that this would shortly be attempted. Thematerial in the National Archives has been weeded and contains only RAFIntelligence files. The date for this planned flight was, according to researchby Andy Saunders, 25 March 1941. The salient details – aeroplane, Kent airfieldand high-ranking Nazis – led the head of RAF Intelligence to term it ‘afantastic story’. The full story may be found in the chapter ‘Kidnap Hitler’ inSaunders’ Arrival of Eagles: Luftwaffe Landings in Britain 1939–1945.9 As such Ian Fleming was, as Alan Judd so accurately notes, ‘a headquartersman who helped devise operations and use the intelligence from that in thefield’ (Sunday Telegraph, 25 August 2012). Bond is, his creator noted, a bluntinstrument, who does not gather intelligence or ferret out secrets. But – in thebooks, at least – the derring-do is compensated for by the self-doubt, thevulnerability and what Fleming vividly termed the deathwatch beetle of the soul,the languorous ennui and lassitude. It is significant in this regard that theshrink character of Sir James Maloney is also absent from the films. In thebooks, he advises M on the state of all his 00 operatives, not least when Bondis nearly killed by Rosa Klebb in From Russia With Love and also whenrecuperating after his wife’s death at the start of You Only Live Twice."},{"pageContent":"11ACROSS THE WATER [contents.htm#a14]It is unlikely that any propagandist would seriously attempt to influencepolitically the people of England, say, or France, through the medium ofastrological predictions. Yet in the United States this was done with effectiveif limited results. In the summer of 1941, Louis de Wohl, a bogus Hungarianastrologer, was sent over to the United States by London. He was to becontrolled by British Security Coordination, but his instructions were that hemust never mention Britain or show in any way that was especially interested inher welfare. His mission was to shake public confidence in the invincibility ofAdolf Hitler.From The Official History of British Security Co-ordination,‘Propaganda by the Stars’When the Pan Am flying boat Dixie Clipper arrived at La Guardia on the lastSunday of May 1941, two civilians disembarked and couldn’t help looking verysheepish. To their horror, press photographers descended. The two British‘government officials’, as they soon declared themselves, did their best to hidetheir faces to avoid being photographed. They had flown from Lisbon via theAzores in civilian clothes and were here on a most delicate mission. They didn’twant anyone – certainly not the pack of snappers who had zeroed in on thecelebrated fashion designer Schiaparelli – to know what they were doing.Two weeks after Rudolf Hess’s defection, Admiral John Godfrey and his fixer,Commander Ian Fleming RNVR, had travelled to New York to advise the USgovernment on how to create its first ever overseas espionage service.The timing was, to say the very least, propitious.The president himself wanted to know if espionage activities could help in‘strengthening our defenses to the extreme limit of our national powers’. Afterthe usual customs runaround, the two Britons took a cab downtown to theRockefeller Center, where an elevator whisked them to the 36th floor and anoffice marked ‘Rough Diamonds, Ltd’.What sounds like something from Fleming’s imagination actually did exist: it wasa cover for the headquarters of the British Security Co-ordination (BSC) which,in short order, had become an umbrella for all British secret agencies in theAmericas, including MI5, MI6, the Special Operations Executive and the PoliticalWarfare Executive. Over the years, many silly stories about its omniscience,influence and the extensive reach of its spy rings have been peddled, often bypeople who should have known better in the first place. Alas, that includes itswartime head who, despite his own claims which are still routinely repeated, wasnever a global spymaster, quietly pulling the strings to wage secret war andmaking unpalatable decisions.The truth was more prosaic and subtle – and to understand why, the visit of IanFleming and Admiral Godfrey needs to be placed into context as to what they werereally trying to achieve, a subject of equally frenzied and inaccuratespeculation over the years that has muddied the historical record.images [images/icon.jpg]If the United States was ever going to enter the fighting, the British wanted tomake sure that whoever took over its intelligence service should be somebodythey could trust. After his visit to Europe the previous autumn, Colonel BillDonovan had made a good impression. The British secret services had nowidentified him as their preferred candidate. Donovan was already a genuine warhero, one of the most decorated men in the American military. From humble Irishorigins, by diligence and a certain native cunning, the colonel had become asuccessful law firm partner on Wall Street. Though nearing retirement age, hesoon assumed the mantle of ‘the last hero’. Memorably described by the filmdirector John Ford – with whom he later worked in Burma – as ‘the sort of guywho thought nothing of parachuting into France, blowing up a bridge, pissing inLuftwaffe gas tanks, then dancing on the roof of the St Regis Hotel with aGerman spy’, it is small wonder that legends have attached themselves to the manusually known as ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan.The president realised he needed a foreign intelligence supremo, not leastbecause the United States was becoming the focus for much espionage activity,both overt and covert. Subversion and sabotage by the Axis powers, particularlydirected towards lend-lease supplies by German sympathisers, remained a majorconcern. Italian crime families were bribed to sweep the New York docks for anysuspected influence of both Nazi saboteurs and spies. For the host country itmeant learning new techniques of counter-intelligence and security which wentfar beyond its understanding and experience.Unlike the British, the American government had only a fleeting familiarity withespionage. Though George Washington had been helped by Nathan Hale (who had goneto the gallows for his spying behind British lines) and Pinkerton’s detectiveshad rounded up Confederate spies for Abraham Lincoln, there was little in theAmerican experience concerning sabotage, subversion and covert activities. Itsexisting arms of military intelligence were both limited in scope anduncoordinated – not just with each other but in feeding information upwards tothe apex of political power.The very openness of US society tended to preclude the activities which theBritish had been practicing for centuries. ‘Very few Americans knew anythingabout espionage outside the work of Messrs Oppenheim, Greene and Ambler,’ onehistorian has succinctly written. And now the existing US intelligence system –‘if the jumble then prevailing in Washington may be so characterised’ – wouldneed to learn about it very quickly.By this time, Bill Donovan had been actively wooed by a supposedly ‘quietCanadian’ with piercing blue eyes and an equally legendary capacity for knockingback dry martinis, a fable eclipsed only by the myths which he peddled abouthimself and others with whom he dealt that have yet to be completely demolishedeven today.images [images/icon.jpg]At the offices of British Security Co-ordination, Admiral Godfrey and CommanderFleming were welcomed by its titular head in person. William Stephenson was nota particularly quiet Canadian, nor was he ever called Intrepid, as onebestselling biography once claimed. Stephenson was assuredly never the éminencegrise who secretly pulled strings and single-handedly ran all the secret war’smost celebrated coups from New York. And yet even today that remainsStephenson’s legacy – which, long after the war, the man himself did his best tocultivate – aided and abetted by an offhand remark by none other than IanFleming.Bill Stephenson, Fleming once said, not James Bond, was the real thing.The historical record was hardly helped by the fact that Bill Stephenson wasoften highly secretive and Machiavellian, thereby allowing innumerable myths toaccumulate and intensify in his wake. Most stem from two biographies, The QuietCanadian in the sixties and, most notably, A Man Called Intrepid by his nearnamesake William Stevenson, which appeared a decade later (and was aptlydemolished by the espionage historian Nigel West as ‘hopelessly unreliable’).It is a matter of record that the man himself helped to concoct such fictions.When West met him in 1979, Stephenson was already showing signs of mentaldecay.1 Yet like so many others who felt they had been underappreciated duringthe war, he purposefully over-promoted his record and achievements. When manyinconsistencies were pointed out about his claims, Stephenson continued toinsist they were genuine. At the time of his death in 1993, it prompted theofficial historian of British Intelligence, Sir Harry Hinsley, a formerBletchley codebreaker who was then master of St John’s, Cambridge, to ruefullyremark, ‘the trouble is when the rumours start, you can never kill them’.And now, thanks to the Internet, they continue to proliferate.Even today some accounts identify Bill Stephenson as a cross between James Bondand an all-knowing member of the Illuminati. The best-selling A Man CalledIntrepid certainly perpetuated the most preposterous notions: that he had beendispatched to the United States by the personal intervention of WinstonChurchill (who told him to be intrepid). Yet there is no evidence that BillStephenson ever even met the prime minister. It is unlikely that his photographwas ever found in the remains of the bombed-out House of Commons the followingspring (another oft-repeated claim).As the splendidly acerbic Hugh Trevor-Roper, who had worked for MI6 during thewar (and often had been threatened with court martial for his disdain forauthority), noted in a wonderfully excoriating review of A Man Called Intrepidin 1976, Stephenson had been portrayed as a universal genius, ‘the Midas whoturned all that he touched into gold; the master of economic life; the prescientmastermind who directed all British and American intelligence; the secretmanipulator of presidents, prime ministers and kings.’The truth is more mundane. Though Bill Stephenson was a well connected, highlysuccessful businessman, he had originally been sent to Manhattan in the latespring of 1940 as the ubiquitous passport control officer – under which many MI6staff worked – and was attached to the British Consulate. His real function wasto run British Security Co-ordination, the government’s intelligence ‘window’ onAmerica, which had been set up, at his suggestion, ‘to do a very important job’.When Bill Stephenson arrived in New York, he did so with Sir Stewart Menzies’sblessing as his personal representative in North America. ‘I have appointed MrW.S. Stephenson to take charge of my organization in the USA and Mexico,’ Cminuted his bosses at the Foreign Office that May. British SecurityCo-ordination’s work was threefold: to investigate enemy activities, to stopsabotage against British supplies and to make American public opinion morefavourable in aiding Britain.It helped that the Canadian got on famously with ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan, for theywere cut from a similar cloth. They were both self-made men, dedicatedadventurers who also liked to bend the rules. ‘Each is a figure about whom muchmyth has been woven,’ warns the former Foreign Office chief historian GillBennett, ‘by themselves and others, and the full extent of their activities andcontacts retains an element of mystery.’Bill Stephenson’s wealth would underwrite the move of BSC from dingy offices offWall Street to the prestigious locale of the Rockefeller Center. With increasingurgency, Stephenson’s actual remit in 1941 expanded as an umbrella organisationto take in intelligence, contraband control and propaganda. Working alongsidethe diplomats in Washington, another stated aim for BSC was to cement betterworking relations between the existing intelligence organisations in the UnitedStates and Britain where great advantage could be gained. The vanguard for sucha more formalised approach came from the Director of Naval Intelligence, AdmiralJohn Godfrey, who had already noted: ‘There is no doubt that we can achieveinfinitely more though Donovan than through any other individual.’images [images/icon.jpg]This then was the background to Godfrey and Fleming’s arrival in New York. Inthe Rockefeller Center they drank gin, smoked Turkish cigarettes and talked agreat deal with Bill Stephenson about their main task: how to usher Donovan intothe catbird seat. So far as the British were concerned, Wild Bill was the manfor the job, already identified as the lynchpin of an alliance between Britishand American intelligence that flourishes to this day.But first the amenities would have to be observed.For the Naval Intelligence officers, that meant the heart-sinking prospect of avisit to the main obstacle in the way of their plans. He was a pugnacious andbulldog-faced stumbling block who had developed a terrible antipathy to anyoneencroaching upon his territory – both literal and political – and that includedgreater co-operation between the security agencies of the two countries.J. Edgar Hoover was a nightmare. Quick to anger, vengeful and the ultimate pettybureaucrat, the myth is that Hoover effectively ran Washington by use of dirtytricks, phone taps and blackmail. President Roosevelt, it is often claimed, wasscared of him. In fact, virtually everyone in town found the FBI Director hardto take (‘Very childish, petulant,’ recorded the chief of militaryintelligence), for his methodical mindset was never particularly adept at theneeds of running an effective counter-espionage agency.Despite this, Ian Fleming – as 007 was often wont to do – took a train to thecapital with the admiral in attendance in early June, heading towards theantiseptic offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on PennsylvaniaAvenue. Against the brightness of the skies and monuments, they knew they wouldbe entering the twilight zone of American intelligence fiefdom disputes.Not only were there anti-British elements within the administration, but Hooverwas implacably opposed to any foreign spies working on American sovereign soil.Worse, he saw Bill Donovan’s increasing visibility as the president’s adviser onintelligence as Roosevelt’s folly. Hoover was well prepared to fight anyencroachment on his territory or the prestige of the FBI.Yet Hoover’s organisation hardly commended itself.So far as counter-espionage was concerned, Ian Fleming had already come to theconclusion that the G-Men were ‘amateurs without special training’. Theirnatural instinct was to bust the spy rings which they came across. They hadneither the experience nor the know-how to ‘run’ them against the Germans. TheG-Men were completely at odds with the needs of wartime deception.‘“Intelligence” in the United States generally means ”Security andCounter-Espionage”,’ Fleming would write. ‘The concept of “offensiveintelligence” is not well understood.’The two naval officers did at least come with a shopping list which they hopedwould help build greater co-operation for the future. They wanted the FBI to bemore active in stopping sabotage in naval dockyards, better debriefing ofcaptured saboteurs and greater cipher security. They also wanted to help trainspies to a higher standard and, most importantly, they were pushing for thecreation of a centre to analyse intelligence which would be directed by a singleco-ordinator. Fleming had certainly already formed the view that the bureau wastoo much of a ‘small and uncoordinated force’ to undertake this crucial role inshaping American foreign policy.And so they came face to face with J. Edgar Hoover.The men from Naval Intelligence were ushered into Hoover’s spartan inner sanctumwhere the director – ‘a chunky enigmatic man with slow eyes and a trap of amouth,’ in Fleming’s later estimation – made it all too clear that he waspolitely uninterested. He then complained about a Nazi spy whom he suspected hadbeen ‘whacked’ by British Security Co-ordination. The meeting ended far soonerthan they expected. After a cursory visit to the basement shooting range, theadmiral and his fixer were left blinking in the sunshine outside.A major step forward took place a few days later when they were both invited toa private dinner in Georgetown to meet ‘Big Bill’ himself. Both men knew ColonelDonovan from his earlier visits to Europe. Now they pressed him to lead aunified US intelligence service. Though he had wanted to return to the fightingand be promoted to a general in the army, Donovan couldn’t help being excited bythe possibilities. Espionage commended itself straight away.‘Information is useless unless it is intelligently directed to the strategicpurposes,’ Donovan would write. Long into the night, as he listened to theirspiel, those strategic purposes became abundantly clear if America was going tobe prepared for the fighting which most now thought inevitable. Fleming, forreasons he never explained, remained at the general’s house the next day andprepared some notes on how to create a possible overseas intelligenceorganisation.An American secret service, Ian Fleming wrote, ‘should not be controlled by theFBI, which has no conception of effective intelligence and is incapable of astrategic mentality’. Donovan would use some of Fleming’s lapidary words himselfwhen he wrote to Roosevelt – at the president’s request – a week later. Japanesesabre rattling and Germany’s unstoppable belligerence required precipitateaction. On 10 June 1941, Donovan minuted that the United States was ‘lacking ineffective services for analyzing, comprehending and appraising information’ andthat something should be done about it.And there was no doubt who he felt should be in charge of it all.images [images/icon.jpg]A week later, the two British naval officers visited the White House, whereAdmiral Godfrey spent an hour alone in the Oval Office with the president. Hismessage was simple: make Donovan the undisputed intelligence ‘master’ of theUnited States. Roosevelt agreed with Godfrey’s obvious manoeuvrings. So muchintelligence information was passing through the White House that he lateracknowledged he needed a gatekeeper. After reading Donovan’s paper, partlywritten by Ian Fleming, the president called for the colonel himself.Wild Bill was in a bullish mood, even by his standards: he made it clear that hewould only take the job of intelligence co-ordinator if he reported directly toRoosevelt, could draw money from a presidential emergency fund and that allexisting government agencies would furnish him with help and information.Franklin Delano Roosevelt agreed.Bill Donovan’s appointment, in the words of the subsequent presidential decree,would ‘neither displace nor encroach upon the FBI, Army and Navy Intelligence,or any other department of government’ and would lead to the creation of theOffice of Strategic Services, a secret agency that reflected the image of thetwo-fisted Irish émigré who would run it.On hearing the news, Ian Fleming cabled Stephenson in New York, who wired theprime minister directly: ‘You can imagine how relieved I am after months ofbattle and jockeying in Washington that our man is in position.’ CommanderFleming remained in the capital to help write memoranda on how to co-operatewith the British and staff the American agency. In his clearly recognisablestyle, the future thriller writer waxed lyrical on potential recruits: ‘Musthave trained powers of observation, analysis and evaluation; absolutediscretion, sobriety, devotion to duty, language and wide experience; and beaged about forty to fifty.’James Bond – if not Fleming himself – would have been an ideal candidate.So began a minor historical controversy over whether Donovan was a British agentor there was an overtly malign influence from the British Empire on America’sfledgling intelligence activities. The colonel was certainly well aware that hehad been manipulated into a position about which he had originally beenambivalent. Ian Fleming, whose insatiable desire for adventure and fantasy wasonly truly sated in his literary creations, later maintained that Donovan was sograteful that he gave him a .38 revolver that was inscribed: ‘For SpecialServices’.As a result, Fleming would facetiously claim that he had written the charter foran American secret service on which the Central Intelligence Agency wouldeventually come to be based. It is a statement that also seems to have beentaken at face value by some journalists and writers, elevating the creator ofJames Bond to the very heart of the long, fruitful intelligence collaborationsbetween Britain and the United States, and an importance that he never soughtnor indeed achieved.images [images/icon.jpg]By the summer of 1941, British Security Co-ordination had expanded itsactivities under William Stephenson’s benign patronage. A thousand or moreregular informants would routinely help the British to prosecute the secret warin the United States. Many of these operations involved covert and overtpropaganda (and if need be, its pure fabrication) as well as searching outevidence for German agents and businesses which collaborated with the ThirdReich.Its remit now took in the whole of the western hemisphere, which alsoencompassed offices across the Caribbean, Central and South America. There was alarge censorship bureau in Bermuda, the fruits of whose labours were regularlyshared with a grateful Hoover, despite his obvious disdain for Stephenson’swooing of Colonel Donovan. ‘When the full story can be told,’ the FBI directorlater wrote to the Canadian, ‘I am quite sure that your contribution will beamong the foremost in having brought victory finally to the united nations’cause.’In some ways, British Security Co-ordination was less a secret agency than aglorified literary salon, for some of its most provocative operations made gooduse of two of the most celebrated writers of the time. Nöel Coward had beenhired to report on fascist sympathisers and helped in the setting up of a‘rumours factory’ which used newspaper gossip columnists, magazines and radiocommentators to discredit the more isolationist of Americans.2 When it was thensuggested he take over the whole of propaganda operations back in London, HughDalton minuted that Coward was ‘An indiscreet stinker, off his proper beat’. Ashe noted in his own diaries, Dalton ‘reacted violently’ against such apromotion. ‘The man is utterly unsuitable and attracts publicity everywhere,’Dalton wrote, believing Stephenson would go nuts when he found out.Another writer, whom his biographer describes as ‘a kind of walking magazine ofstories, a conduit of numerous rumours and revelation’, was also employed togreat effect in the United States. After serving in fighter squadrons in Greece,Syria and North Africa, Flight Lieutenant Roald Dahl was now ostensibly workingas an Assistant Air Attaché at the Washington Embassy, where he was supposed tobe the liaison man for all American air forces. He also secretly worked withWild Bill Donovan’s nascent intelligence organisation and was instrumental inhelping with propaganda activities. As always, given the calibre of writers likeRoald Dahl and Ian Fleming, it is sometimes hard to determine what they reallydid and, more to the point, achieved at this time.As a reviewer of Dahl’s secret work has noted, it is hard to know what to makeof many of his and others’ claims – half-truths or true lies, for certain – asit was hardly a coincidence that both Dahl and Fleming became accomplishedstorytellers ‘The BSC agents emerged from the war practiced in the arts ofdeception, obfuscation and seduction,’ writes Jeanne Connant, also noting thatFleming and Dahl became rich and successful as fabulists.Yet neither ever came close to some of the claims of another visitor to Americanshores at this time, who, with the direct blessing of British intelligence, wasbeing allowed some latitude to finally be allowed to vanquish his foes, theFührer and his supposed malefic astrologer, in public. For once, one of Louis deWohl’s predictions had come true, that, exactly as he had identified in hisouverture of death proposal, activities should now be concentrated on the UnitedStates.images [images/icon.jpg]Within a month of Rudolf Hess’s defection, Louis de Wohl had been summarilydispatched to the United States for the culmination of his ‘astrologicalmission’ that had started a few weeks before. His American sojourn was prompted,one colleague recalled, because he wanted ‘world-wide backing’ for hisastrological propaganda campaign. Over the summer of 1941, de Wohl did exactlythat, regularly creating horoscopes that were generally unfavourable to the Nazileadership in the hope that they would be published in the press or highlightedin lectures.In a sense, his American mission was to fight like with like in a country thatthe official BSC history sniffily dismisses as ‘a fertile field for outrépractices’. German-backed astrologers, it was feared, were suspected of doingthe same, influencing mass circulation magazines like American Astrology withthe inclusion of readers’ letters which predicted the inevitability of Nazivictory. ‘At fairly frequent intervals SOE were to send to the New York officeitems of black propaganda they wanted to appear in the American press, in thehope that they would go from there to Germany,’ recalled one party to thisantidote astrology created on the British side.No sooner had Louis de Wohl arrived in the United States, than the BSC arrangeda press conference where he talked of the ‘Neptunian fate’ (as he had termed itin discussion with Leslie Sheridan) which would shortly consume Adolf Hitler.His overarching mission was to disseminate information that Germany was going tolose the war, and so the stories followed. ‘His latest prediction is that Hitlerwill be assassinated within a year,’ the columnist Ruth Reynolds reported a fewdays later.Indeed, the astrologer’s various prognostications knew no bounds as a randomselection of headlines from the US press that summer shows: ‘Seer sees Nazi Doomif U.S. acts in Eight months’; ‘Hitler Ill-fated’; ‘Hitler’s Star Is Setting’;and, most notable of all, a headline from the New York Sun, ‘Seer sees plot tokill Hitler’, below which was a strap head that the Führer would be done in‘within a year’. Noting that the Führer was a doomed man, it added de Wohl’s‘talk of things to come that would be nerve-shattering in their emotionalimpact’. The kill, it seemed, was already under way as the Führer was slowlygoing insane and ‘his own astrologers dare not tell him the truth any longer’.‘Hitler would be done away within a year,’ it added.At this point, Louis de Wohl was making use of a speaking agent based inManhattan called Martin Starr. He seemed to be earning his keep. ‘The learnedastro-philosopher became the darling of the special feature writers,’ he notedin a publicity flyer. ‘Here was drama in the making.’ And according to Starr,the New York papers had started to refer to him as ‘the modern Nostradamus’.Further stories followed, including the one that Karl Krafft had predicted‘Germany will not win the war’. The notion was that the Führerastrologe had beensugar-coating his predictions so as not to upset the Third Reich’s leaders. ‘IfEnglish and French astrologers put their hopes in the fact that the Führer hasno more good constellations from now on, then these people overlook the factthat the work achieved in the last ten years would keep its value and vigoureven if the Führer would suddenly disappear.’By comparison, Louis de Wohl appeared all over the Union.A certain plausible deniability suffused his work, as he had been sent as aprivate citizen. ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan’s prototypical Office of Strategic Serviceswas informed about the astrologer’s activities. ‘Our friends in OSS were notimpressed,’ recalled another of de Wohl’s handlers. ‘I have no doubt that theythought that the de Wohl mission was a cover story for something infinitely moresinister. Perhaps indeed it was.’There remained a global scope to his work following on from his earlierouverture of death. ‘It was planned that the first prophecies which de Wohlwould make upon his arrival in the US should harmonize with pre-arrangedastrological and magical predictions of Hitler’s fall which would be made inother remote parts of the world,’ the official BSC history notes.Everything came together smoothly.From the Egyptian capital, an Arabic newspaper carried some warnings from aneminent astrologer, Sheikh Youssef Afifi. ‘Four months hence a red planet willappear on the eastern horizon and will indicate that a dangerous evil-doer,’ theCairo-based seer was quoted as saying, ‘who has drenched the world in blood,will pass away … this means that an uncrowned Emperor will be killed, and thatman is Hitler.’From Nigeria came a long, involved prophecy of a priest: ‘The cripple stabbedthe breadfruit man in the back. The long-haired one cursed the glass-eyed oneand pushed him from the ledge.’ Thanks to Sherry Sheridan’s efforts, thesestories were picked up by American newspapers and, as the BSC history notes,people began to sit up and take notice.images [images/icon.jpg]The coal-black eyes were burning with fire and the pug-like face was visiblysnarling. J. Edgar Hoover was not happy with the latest British-sent visitor tohis office. The dark-eyed man with the straw-brown hair brushed back, however,gave as good as he got. Dusko Popov smiled despite the venerable FBI director’sonslaught. ‘You come from nowhere and within six weeks install yourself in aPark Avenue penthouse, chase films stars, break a serious law and try to corruptmy officers.’ After a few more barbs, Hoover angrily told him he was trying toteach him how to do his job. Popov couldn’t help grinning as he delivered theline which saw him ejected from the FBI Director’s office.‘I don’t think anyone could teach you anything,’ he said, savouring the moment.This almost mythical exchange in the life of agent Tricycle – which according toFBI files never actually seems to have taken place – obscured a far morepredictable official disinterest in Popov’s work in the United States after hisarrival in August 1941.It was a symptom of Hoover’s insistence that no intelligence operations shouldbe carried out by foreign spy rings – as he saw them – on American soil. Withheart-sinking inevitability, many on the British side thought the FBI wascompletely the wrong sort of agency to undertake any counter-espionageactivities. Bill Stephenson, for one, thought that Hoover’s personality countedagainst any closer working together. A federal domestic espionage agency, henoted, ‘needed as its chief a man less rigid and sensitive to potential rivals’.What seems to have caused Hoover’s ire was Dusko’s arrival with a mikropunkt,the latest marvel of German technology, a microdot machine that could hidesecret information within any document. In fact, Popov would arrive in theUnited States with eleven microdots about his person. In vain did Dusko pointout to Hoover that these had been presented to the bureau on a ‘silver platter’;the director was dismissive.‘You are like all double agents,’ he had said, ‘you’re begging for informationto sell to your German friends so you can make a lot of money and be a playboy.’It has also recently come to light that the director had a special ire for evenmythical playboys. It might have come as a consolation to Dusko that Hoover’shatred extended into surreal realms with the release in December 2014 of a memofrom the early sixties, that showed how out of touch the FBI remained.The bureau, Hoover minuted, should not associate itself with 007 in any way. In1964, the producers of the Bond films had sounded out the FBI helping them withtheir first film which would be shot on American soil. As they startedproduction on their third film in the series, Hoover insisted that far fromco-operating, the bureau should ‘vigorously protest any mention of the FBI orportrayal of its agents in his proposed movie’.His minions were hardly on the ball. In the memo, Hoover noted with puritanicaldismissiveness that the Bond stories were ‘generally filled with sex and bizarresituations’. Almost inevitably, they always seemed to present ‘beautiful womenpresenting themselves to him in scanty attire’.And, in an odd case of life imitating fiction, if Dusko’s memoirs are tobelieved that is exactly what happened on a beach where, in the film that thebureau didn’t want to help make, 007 and Goldfinger meet for the first time.images [images/icon.jpg]In the summer of 1941, while on his supposedly secret mission in the UnitedStates, the fame – and in some estimations infamy – which Louis de Wohl hadcraved for so many years finally now came to pass. Its apotheosis took place inearly August at a meeting of the American Federation of Scientific Astrologersin Cleveland where, his agent later maintained, audiences clamoured to know morefrom ‘one of the most informed authorities on the subject’.Louis de Wohl remained good copy. ‘Hitler’s move on Russia was a great mistake,’he said on the closing day of the conference. And though the views ofastrologers were supposedly banned for broadcast by the Federal CommunicationsCommission, while in Ohio he was allowed to discuss his thoughts about Hitlerand Napoleon on air. While the transcripts seem to be lost, his agent took upsome of the slack. Martin Starr noted:Because of the attempted Russian invasion of the Hitler forces has de Wohl’sintensive study of the Little Corporal and Der Füehrer become one of the mosttimely subjects of the day. Yesterday’s bloody pages of history are mirroredagainst the tumultuous happenings of today with ironic parallel. The subject ismore dramatic than drama itself.As ever, the astrologer could be relied on to grab attention about his certaintyof the Führer’s demise. ‘We can’t predict a date for his defeat,’ de Wohlcontinued, ‘but if the United States enters the war before next spring, he isdoomed.’ This neatly contrasted the astrological situation with a politicianrather nearer to home. ‘President Roosevelt’s horoscope is perfectly beautiful,’he said. ‘He towers above all others.’Louis de Wohl made sure to reiterate this same point when visiting friends inLos Angeles – where the Los Angeles Times called him ‘chubby, curly-haired andbespectacled’ – in early September 1941. The Führer, he revealed, was mentallyill and could not focus during his recent five-day conference with Mussolini.‘Hitler’s horoscope shows he has not long to live,’ the paper reported, ‘as hecould not concentrate.’ But the final word in California was an even moreastounding prediction. The astrologer also announced that ‘between now and 11June 1942 would be the best time for the United States to enter the war’.Even after the invasion of the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, manyAmericans still did not want to become embroiled in the war that had rent thewhole of continental European asunder. The previous September, America First, avociferous pressure group, had been established in Chicago for that verypurpose. Its leading light was a genuine American hero, the first man to fly theAtlantic on his own, Charles A. Lindbergh, whose sometimes anti-Semitic rhetoricoften alienated many of those to whom he was appealing.As the history of the BSC notes, De Wohl attacked ‘lucky Lindy’ for the fact hethought he was an exemplar which made the weak-minded believe that a man who canhandle machines well must be an authority on things of the spirit. Clearly deWohl was an authority: ‘He said that the kidnapped Lindbergh baby was stillalive’ and was one of a number of future Führers being trained at a Nazi schoolin East Prussia.‘De Wohl delivered many other attacks like these upon anti-Britishpersonalities,’ the history notes, ‘and there is little doubt that his work hada considerable effect upon certain sections of the people.’images [images/icon.jpg]It would have made a great scene from a film, exactly as it did at the start ofGoldfinger. A foreign playboy, lounging around with a beautiful woman, suddenlylooks up to see an apparition in dark jacket, white shirt, dark tie andsnap-brim hat. Even on Miami Beach in 1941, Hoover’s men would never relax. InDusko Popov’s memoirs, he explains that this striking scene led directly to aneven more astounding conclusion: that the FBI knew there was going to be anattack on Pearl Harbor.Variants on this theme linger today. The greater truth is that anyone who takesDusko Popov’s claims at face value has to be very careful indeed. One of thereasons for his visit to the United States in 1941 was that his Lisboncontrollers wanted him to establish answers to a series of pressing militaryquestions. The eleven microdots contained several complicated questionnairesabout US and Canadian air defences, the numbers and extent of training forpilots, tank production and dispositions of the naval forces.In particular, one questionnaire was devoted to information which could onlyever have been of use to another Axis power. The Abwehr wanted to know all aboutthe air and naval defences surrounding Pearl Harbor. Dusko says he was shockedwhen he saw these questions. He realised, or so he claimed many years later,that the Japanese were going to attack the United States. Indeed, once he hadsettled in New York, his German masters made it clear they wanted him to visitthe Hawaiian base itself because their Japanese allies were having problemsinfiltrating native orientals anywhere on the island.When permission from the FBI wasn’t forthcoming, he delighted in tormenting hishandlers by taking a trip to Florida with an English model he knew. ‘It seems Ihave the reputation of being a playboy,’ he explained to a horrified FBIsupervisor, ‘and taking a girl on a trip fits my cover.’ According to hispost-war memoirs, it was on a beach in Miami that they looked up to see a man ina hat and tie. A G-Man from central casting strolled over to tell him that hehad contravened the Mann Act – it was a federal offence to cross a state linewith a girl for immoral purposes – and the English lovely was forced to fly backto New York City.According to Popov, he never saw her again. His MI5 and FBI files show thatnothing so melodramatic took place: with a certain amount of reservation (theMann Act was mentioned but only as a vague threat), the Yugoslav was allowed his‘dirty weekend’ in the sunshine state. According to his FBI files, Popov met themodel again in New York City, where an even stranger occurrence took place thathe pointedly didn’t mention in his autobiography.When the Feds pointed out to him that this girl was suspected of having pro-Nazisympathies and had perhaps deliberately made his acquaintance to spy on him,Popov calmly replied that he would have no compunction in killing her. His FBIcontact was once again horrified: even with the bureau’s protection, the youngYugoslav would not be immune from the due process of law: arrest, trial andhanging.‘I’ll take her to South America, then,’ Popov smoothly replied. ‘I’ll kill herthere.’images [images/icon.jpg]To enhance Louis de Wohl’s reputation, while he was in the United States hewould have to make a prediction that would come true. For that, a French navalofficer from Martinique would be involved. The colonial island was a worry forthe Royal Navy because it had the only deep water harbours in the Caribbean.That gave greater latitude for Vichy and German vessels to re-victual.So earlier that summer, Louis de Wohl had made his first public prediction thata ‘strong collaborator’, neither a German nor a Nazi, would go violently insanesomewhere in Central or South America. Three days later, according to a laterreport in the New York Sunday News (headlined: ‘Hitler’s astrologer seesheavenly stop light’), Admiral Robert, leader of the Vichy French Caribbeanterritories, had indeed gone mad.As the BSC history notes, Louis de Wohl really seemed to know what he wastalking about:After all here was a prophet who had made a prediction in New York which wasimmediately confirmed, first by an Egyptian astrologer in Cairo, and secondly bya Nigerian priest in the jungles of Africa. Furthermore he had definitely saidthat within ten days one of Hitler’s allies would be found to be mad.The astrologer’s supposed ability now became a potent propaganda tool.‘For the moment, anyway,’ the official history of British Security Co-ordinationnotes, ‘his reputation shone as brightly as the stars of which he spoke.’‘Few European notables ever made a more retiring entrance in to the UnitedStates than Louis de Wohl,’ his agent noted in promotional literature. Describedas a distinguished author, astro-philosopher and ‘exile from Hitler’sGeo-Political Institute’, he claimed that he ‘he would have to dash offprognostications right and left’.He went on tour and whether in private, at meetings or in widely syndiactedarticles, he repeatedly declared that Hitler was doomed. He later attacked theFrency Vichy government and the isolationist Lindbergh. And for the next year,he made another curious prediction. ‘If Germany is still going it may attempt toinvade the US through Brazil because of its many German colonists’.images [images/icon.jpg]Curiously, Brazil and South America would see many strange events before the USentered the fighting. A minor squall certainly blew up in the run-up to the USelection that November of 1941. Even today, it is a story mired in mysteryconcerning the supposed ‘find’ of a map supposedly taken from a German courierwhose car had crashed outside of Buenos Aires. This time, though, the map’sprovenance was plausibly denied and nobody is exactly sure who was responsible.The map showed South America divided into German states, each with its ownidentified gauleiters. It was most likely a BSC operation and, as such, a usefuladdition to the diplomatic bluster. ‘This map makes clear the Nazi design,’Franklin Delano Roosevelt fulminated, ‘not only against South America butagainst the United States as well.’A few days before the election, Dusko Popov received a cable which read:‘ELIZABETH DEPARTED FOR RIO.’ This was confirmation that he should travel toBrazil for his latest trawl of information about the organisation of the USArmy, so arrangements were made by the FBI for his trip. Popov departed on 16November, and so far as Hoover was concerned it was good riddance. At least theplayboy would reveal who was responsible for German espionage in South America,but the bureau – from the director downwards – wouldn’t like to bet on it.In fact, the trip to Rio was equally frustrating. He had waited in vain for aweek to receive instructions as to how to meet his local contact. With its usualbreathtaking incompetence, the Abwehr outstation in Lisbon had failed to let itsSouth American equivalent know where star agent Ivan was staying. Though hewrote nine letters in all to his contact in Portugal, it wasn’t until Octoberthat he received a reply and was blithely told that none of his earlier lettershad been received. Aggrieved, Popov wrote back straight away: ‘Wonder what hashappened to the radio? Have retained my radio man nearly a month ago and mustsign the lease for the house outside New York. I could avoid a lot of trouble ifyou would act with more speed.’With mounting frustration, Popov made his way to the German Embassy and asked tosee the military attaché. Eventually, after meeting the local Abwehr officer, hewas given $10,000 and more instructions and questions to resume his espionageactivities in the United States. They also discussed the vexed question of thelack of communications. It was agreed that he should buy the parts of a radioset commercially and get his radio operator to assemble them when he was back inManhattan.After just under a month in Rio, Popov set sail for the United States aboard theSS Uruguay, on which, to his delight, a ballet company was returning home. Onreaching Trinidad, he was fully intending to have an afternoon’s illicitpleasure with one of the ballerinas whom he had befriended. When they walkeddown the gang plank, however, a short, freckled man who was obviously Englishappeared.He whispered that he wanted a word. Walter ‘Freckles’ Wren was the MI6 stationchief at the embassy in Port of Spain and had been ordered to debrief theYugoslav. For obvious reason, his handlers in London wanted to know whatTricycle had been up to in Brazil, particularly because the FBI – thanks toHoover’s usual mixture of petulance and heavy handedness – had been less thanforthcoming. Any disappointment Popov felt in losing the ballerina were morethan made up by meeting Wren’s secretary, an English rose who was ‘long-leggedand brainy but also sensationally beautiful’, who provided him with somecompensation. Neither his later memoirs nor hitherto secret files elaborate anyfurther on this latest seduction.images [images/icon.jpg]The smoke and devastation over Ford Island had hardly dissipated before theconspiracy theories began. Amongst the most persistent stories about PearlHarbor comes the agent whose own clairvoyance, if it really had occurred, musthave been unique in the annals of espionage. If Dusko Popov is to be believed,he arrived in Manhattan on the day of infamy itself where he was met by an FBIman at the docks. Because of the detailed questionnaire about the Hawaiianisland, Dusko claimed that he was astounded by the news of the attack.In fact, newly released files reveal that because of worries that he might bewatched by German intelligence agents, contact wasn’t actually made with thebureau until later. More to the point, Popov didn’t dock until the second Mondayafter the attack, 15 December. ‘I never did get an answer to the enigma of PearlHarbor,’ he later claimed. ‘Over the years I have studied the question, tried todraw conclusions, had all sorts of speculation and conjectures.’These murky events have prompted the conspiracy theorists’ smoking gun: thatsomehow the Federal Bureau of Investigation knew all about the impending attackand decided to ignore the warnings. Though there was a basic truth about thePearl Harbor questionnaire, nowhere does it suggest a Japanese attack was goingto take place. To be fair, the FBI Director did paraphrase its contents and hadpassed it on to the relevant military authorities. None of the British filesreleased in the twenty-first century make any contemporary reference to Popov’swarnings of an attack.3Immediately after Popov’s revelations (which came about in his autobiographySpy/Counterspy published in 1974) the FBI took care to re-examine its own files.Even allowing for residual reverence for ‘the old Man’ – Hoover had diedeighteen months earlier – there is little reference to Popov’s supposed warningsin the bureau’s otherwise meticulous files. ‘The Pearl Harbor story is a typicalexample of “Monday morning quarterbacking”,’ an unknown G-Man wrote aftersearching the archives, ‘in that he now plays up an explanation of thesignificance of the material he furnished which our file does not show hementioned contemporaneously.’ Thomas Troy, a former CIA analyst who was theofficial historian for its predecessor, Donovan’s Office of Strategic Services,flatly declared that Popov ‘never personally warned Hoover about such an attack… He warned nobody.’And even in the aftermath of the cataclysmic event that brought America into thewar, the Feds seemed more concerned about butterfly trays which Dusko had seenwhen he visited the German Embassy in Rio. He had, he claimed to his handlers,seen a number of people in a sideroom who seemed to have been poring over whatappeared to be trays of pinned butterflies. It appeared to Popov that they weregoing to be used to smuggle secret information into the United States as theywould make a perfect hiding place for microdots. The result was that shortlythereafter 500 butterfly trays were impounded from the SS Uruguay and examinedin minute detail by FBI forensic experts.On his return to the US, Dusko Popov was uncharacteristically depressed and downin the dumps. So to cheer himself up, he made an extended visit to the recentlyopened and currently trendy ski resort of Sun Valley in Idaho, where he spentmuch of his time getting drunk and chasing women. ‘My nights passed in a blur ofalcohol and sex,’ Popov would later recall.He returned to New York in the new year to good news from the FBI. A transmitterwas going to be installed in a safe house on Long Island. Popov was finallygoing to be allowed to earn his keep and drip feed falsified informationprovided by the US military. Behind the scenes a row started to simmer betweenBritish Security Co-ordination and Hoover as to why he should be allowed to dothis. In the meantime, an FBI radioman sent agent Ivan’s first radio message on27 January from the house on Long Island.It took five days for a response to be heard through the crackling shortwave.Popov wrote to Lisbon in secret ink the next day: ‘Because of situation herehave to be very careful. Can only transmit for a short time so I won’t bediscovered.’ A few weeks later, he started to receive airmail letters fromPortugal in which further clarifications were asked for. Yet the tenor of theletters showed that his controllers were obviously disappointed. To all intentsand purposes, Dusko Popov was stranded in the States with little interest fromAmerican and German intelligence.‘Very little of consequence was developed from the time the radio was set upuntil Tricycle’s departure from this country,’ British Security Co-ordinationreported a while later. It seemed that his great mission to report on the newtransatlantic enemy had ground to a halt even before it had begun.images [images/icon.jpg]Another visitor was preparing to return home in those first few weeks of 1942.In his own mind, Louis de Wohl was always convinced that his US tour had been amassive success. ‘I know from SOE that his propaganda visit to America wasconsidered highly successful,’ Gilbert Lennox noted at the end of the war, ‘andboth before and after that he did a lot of propaganda work which was consideredvery good. He has certainly done more for the Allied cause than many of hisforeign brethren.’But that was written way after the event. Whatever his US mission reallyachieved – and the files show there were many questions being asked – many inBritish Intelligence were now starting to question both his role and theastrologer’s actual value to the war effort. Once again, Louis de Wohl washardly treated as a serious participant in the fighting of the secret war.‘[What] could have been an excellent piece of psychological warfare turned out,from lack of co-operation, into a fair flop,’ another colleague has recalled.By now, virtually everyone in British Intelligence seems to have been fed up ofwhat one called this ‘bumptious seeker after notoriety’. His American sojournwas the last straw. Far from galvanising the British secret services intorealising how important a weapon astrology could be, Louis de Wohl was nowincreasingly being dismissed as a prima donna whose Walter Mitty-like fantasiesextended to some slightly peculiar, unsettling sexual tendencies which theauthorities did their best to keep hidden.The irony is that though he was being employed to create whispers, there weremany more now accumulating behind his back. The security officer of the newlyformed Political Warfare Executive (de Wohl’s ostensible employers after theSOE) now considered him ‘a complete scoundrel’. As a matter of routine, MI5, theBritish Security Service, was keeping a beady eye on all his activities. Anumber of high-ups were aghast when they found out what he had been up to.A number of high-ups were also aghast about Louis de Wohl’s work. ‘I don’t likedecisions of this kind,’ wrote the head of MI5’s counter-espionage department,‘made by reference to the stars rather than MI5.’ Now, as Louis de Wohl preparedto return home to London, an MI6 officer noted for the files that he could not‘believe that anyone is going to re-employ this dangerous charlatan andconfidence-trick merchant’.images [images/icon.jpg]One person who had thought his entry into the secret world would be a cushysinecure found that it wasn’t during those first few months of 1942. Cutting adashing figure in his scarlet satin-lined greatcoat and swagger stick – both ofwhich were very much against Royal Air Force regulations – Wheatley foundhimself in an unusual position. The fact that the London Controlling Section wasthe holiest of holies in Whitehall counted against the work they were trying todo.‘We were regarded as the most secret section in the whole building,’ Wheatleylater recalled. ‘We were kept absolutely incommunicado and not even allowed totell the other members of the Joint Planning Staff what we were up to.’ Thefirst controller of deception lost heart and didn’t seem to understand what wasrequired of him – or, indeed, it.The greater truth was: there was nothing to do.Nobody in Whitehall understood deception, and given the secrecy, they couldn’tdiscuss what they were doing with colleagues. A famous vignette occurred whenthey aimed at deception at Stavanger. When he was told that it would be calledOperation Hardboiled, Oliver Stanley was aghast. ‘Who was the bloody fool whochose such a silly codeword?’In the meantime, Dennis Wheatley was determined to enjoy his food. Even duringthe height of rationing, the occult writer’s consumption was astonishing. To thedevil, a dieter. A typical day would see him consume a couple of glasses ofPimms, then a ‘short one’ of what he termed ‘Chanel 5’ (absinthe – with finewine, ended with port or kummel). And while the country neared starvation, hewould feast on whatever specials were to hand. Smoked salmon, potted shrimps,Dover sole, jugged hare, game or Welsh rarebit. When he got back to the officehe would have a sleep and then there would be afternoon tea and cakes, whichgoes some way to explain one of his more famously strange proposals. ‘Deceptionon the higher plane’ would see the rumour of a Christ-like figure emerging tosave Germany. Unsurprisingly, it got nowhere.At the start of 1942, the balance of the war remained precarious. Even with theentry of the United States to make it a truly global confrontation, there was nocertainty that the Allies would prevail against the Axis powers. It would takethe tide quite some time to turn. Indeed the first half of the year coincidedwith a low ebb of misfortune. The miracle of Midway and the fatal attritions ofEl Alamein and Stalingrad had yet to come. Wherever they looked, the newlymerging high command of Britons and Americans could find some comfort that allthe elements of the secret war – the agents, the deceptions and the decryptionof enemy signals – were gearing up for that singular and most important event:the return to Europe.images [images/icon.jpg]There would be no such epiphany for Louis De Wohl.After arriving back from the United States on 27 February 1942, there was nowelcome. ‘I didn’t expect to be met by a brass band,’ he later said somewhatindignantly, ‘or even one fiddler, but I did expect someone to pay at least someattention to my return.’ Increasingly, he felt that he had been left in thelurch. Miss Bainbridge returned before him and soon became his sounding boardfor a litany of complaints. As always, something insignificant managed to annoyhim.He had returned to Grosvenor House but it seemed that all his furniture had beenkept at his old apartment, to which he did not expect to return. ‘It is not aninexpensive flat,’ a note in the file records, ‘and I think this rathersurprised de Wohl, although his own ideas are not what I should call moneysaving, in the ordinary case of events.’ So he re-took his flat rather than movethe furniture and then, as the note records straight-facedly: ‘To hisastonishment nothing happened at all, and no one tried to get in touch withhim.’As the report makes clear, the vain astrologer had had no premonition that therewas no more work for him back in London, ‘and above all, he had not the faintestnotion that his temporary rank of Captain might come to a sudden end’. He alsowanted access to the money he had made in the United States which had not beenforthcoming.Nor did he have any idea where his handlers had moved to. When he next went tomeet Sir Charles Hambro, he discovered that his offices had moved fromFitzmaurice Place. When he later telephoned Sir Charles’s secretary, the callwas not returned. As the subsequent contact report notes it, de Wohl returned tothe attack.He went to Bush House, where he was shown up to the ‘new people’ but wasrebuffed. Though he knew SOE Headquarters was in Baker Street, thankfully, fromthe point of security, he did not go there. Louis de Wohl, as Colonel Lennoxnoted, was somewhat desperate. With no money and no contracts, he was in a bind.‘It is all just as if the whole thing is a dream,’ he later lamented to Lennox.He wanted desperately to carry on his work, and work with June Bainbridge. Onceagain, he found it inordinately difficult to get hold of her. When he did makecontact, she gently pointed out that he should go back to his life before thewar. June told him that he should move into the Esplanade Hotel and set up shopas an astrologer again. But that clearly was not an option. ‘He also remindedher that he was a Captain in the British Army,’ Lennox noted, ‘and this seemedto entirely flummox Miss Bainbridge.’His various attempts at contacting the authorities had clearly reached GilbertLennox. So the major turned up and listened to the astrologer’s various moans.Louis de Wohl wanted to not just do more of what he had been doing before heleft for America, he wanted to do more broadcasting as he had done in the UnitedStates. ‘He showed me his book of press cuttings of his trip,’ Lennox wrote,‘and from these it certainly appeared that his mission had not been altogetherunsuccessful.’Behind the scenes, British Intelligence were examining what to do next with‘this troublesome case’. In March 1942, Sir Charles Hambro saw him, told him hehad done ‘an excellent job of work in America, that he was to go on leave onfull pay until the end of April and that his future would be considered in theinterval’. Nobody mentioned anything about his ‘temporary commission’ in theBritish Army because as a later note makes clear ‘no one has ever told him thathe does not hold it!’It was clear his future was very uncertain, with one note recording that he ‘atone time exercised some influence upon highly placed British IntelligenceOfficers through his star gazing profession’. Within a few months, theauthorities were simply finding it easier to ignore him. Sir Charles Hambro hadalleged that his one-time golden boy was ‘a complete scoundrel’ and othersthought he might become very dangerous, ‘owing to the considerable influencewhich his charlatanism enables him to exert over the superstitious in highplaces’.They wanted to keep him on side, but get shot of him to another department assoon as possible. But within a matter of weeks, against all the odds, he hadfound a saviour. ‘The outcome is that de Wohl has, in fact, got a job underSefton Delmer, in which he is to be editor of an astrological monthly paperwhich is being send to Germany by surreptitious means.’images [images/icon.jpg]Without spelling it out, this would be the last great hurrah for Louis de Wohl.The astrologer who always liked to consider himself ‘the modern Nostradamus’,would be employed to manipulate the sayings of the original one in perhaps themost dangerous chapter of the Second World War so far as the British wereconcerned.Nothing was off the table so far as the Battle of the Atlantic was concerned.The situation was so serious that the Director of Naval Intelligence had beenprevailed upon to help fight the U-boat menace by any means necessary; so muchso that, in his own words, ‘an element of perfidy, verging on the unscrupulous’,was necessary. Admiral John Godfrey looked no further than his special assistantto ensure that the myriad possibilities of broadcasting subversive materialcould be realised. Any advantage, no matter how quixotic, would be needed. Bythe spring of 1943, the situation had become so very dangerous that all of thepeople in this story – the admiral, Ian Fleming, Sefton Delmer and Louis De Wohl– were involved, but none as important, controversial or improbable as a19-year-old torch singer whose sweet voice gave no hint, as Tom Delmer noted,that she had lost half her family in a concentration camp.NOTESAll file references below refer to documents in the UK National Archives (TNA)or else books which may be found in the bibliography below.1 As Nigel West later noted, it was clear that Stephenson had been ‘exploitedby just about everybody who had ever met him’. The more egregious lies aboutStephenson’s influence are exposed in West’s splendid Counterfeit Spies (1999),as well as his introduction to the official BSC war report.2 In the years immediately before the war, Noel Coward had been employed inParis in a small liaison section which dealt with political propaganda. WhenQuex Sinclair heard about this and was told Coward wore a naval uniform, he issupposed to have quipped: ‘I suppose he had it specially designed for him.’3 Many official records acknowledge the fact that the intelligence agencieshad dropped the ball. There were, according to the Chairman of the XX Committee,J.C. Masterman, clear indications that ‘Pearl Harbor would be the first point tobe attacked and plans for this attack had reached an advanced state by August1941’. One of the most perceptive American investigators after the event – RearAdmiral Edwin Layton, who had been a senior naval intelligence officer – notedthat Hoover’s ‘failure represented another American fumble on the road to PearlHarbor’. Colonel Tommy Robertson, who ran the day-to-day operations of the XXSystem, conceded that ‘the mistake we made was not to take the Pearl Harborinformation out and send it separately to Roosevelt’."},{"pageContent":"12ZENITH [contents.htm#a15]A series of meetings is taking place all over Germany to combat the growing warweariness and dissatisfaction with the Nazi party. Two slogans – ‘Party andnation are indivisible’ and ‘the end of the party is the end of the people’ arehammered into people’s ears by every party lecturer … More and more is beingheard of desertion in all branches of the services, but it should be rememberedthat the oath of allegiance to the colours binds two parties, the soldiers toserve, and the authorities to see to the welfare of the soldiers and theirfamilies. In the majority of cases, these so-called deserters are not desertersat all, but men whose minds are unhinged with anxiety about their families.Transcript of news item, Atlantik Sender, broadcast 9 August 1943The voice, even as it faded in and out of the shortwave static, was enticing,exactly as it was supposed to be. Intimacy was inevitable in the chokingconfines of a U-boat in the swells of the Atlantic, but this was somethingaltogether different. When the German submarine crews inadvertently happenedupon a husky-voiced, seductive female broadcasting to them directly, they couldhardly believe their ears.‘This is Vicky speaking,’ the sultry female voice could be heard saying, ‘itshouldn’t take us long to get acquainted.’ And between German-flavoured jazzrecords, the novelty of Vicky’s honeyed tones invited each of them to dance. Intime, she would reveal items of news far more accurate than anything which wasofficially sanctioned by Goebbels’s Propaganda Ministry. Generally, she made thecrews feel good about themselves despite the terrible confines of their boatsand the horrible conditions.Many German submariners were hooked, especially when the voluptuous Vickyrevealed other intimate details about the average U-boat man’s life at home: thebars where they drank, the names of their officers, the latest gossip from theHotel-Am-Steiphatz, where they were headquartered and even the names of theirfavourite whores and the addresses of their brothels. It was definitelysubversive but didn’t seem overtly propagandistic.And it was, to its creators’ everlasting gratitude, a certifiable hit.The radio station formally known as Kurzwellensender Atlantik, but more often asAtlantik Sender, was the latest, greatest contribution of Sefton Delmer’scontinuing efforts in the propaganda war. The voice of Vicky was provided by aJewish refugee from Berlin, 19-year-old Agnes Bernelle, whose seductive toneshad come to his attention a few months before. Like her, the station wasirresistible, partly because it was forbidden but mainly because its subversionwas subtle. The crews knew it wasn’t operating from within the Third Reich butthat didn’t really matter. It was entertaining and that was all that reallymattered.Unlike the sledgehammer crowing of Lord Haw Haw, whose broadcasts createdderision in their intended British targets, Vicky’s work adhered to SeftonDelmer’s basic principle: to be successful, propaganda always had to tell thetruth. In the face of their constant hardships, it was his intention thatAtlantik Sender would become the submariner’s best friend. And in time it did,even though Vicky would start to slip disconcerting details into her broadcasts,which had been gleaned from prisoners of war.The process had been far simpler than Delmer had dared imagine. Interrogatorsfrom the Naval Intelligence Division realised that their captives might notreveal technical details in which they were really interested. But, sailor tosailor, they were keen to boast about what they had been up to on their shoreleave. And as Vicky could attest, all the nice girls really did like a sailor.This approach to subverting the German submariners had come from perhaps themost fertile imagination in Naval Intelligence. Commander Ian Fleming, withwhatever reserves of inventiveness he had at his disposal, could be relied uponto come up with any number of remarkably crazy ideas that were always worthconsidering. ‘A lot of Ian’s ideas were just plain crazy,’ remarked AdmiralNorman Denning, a post-war Director of Naval Intelligence. ‘But a lot of hisfar-fetched ideas had just a glimmer of possibility in them that made you thinktwice before you threw them into the wastepaper basket.’As Naval Intelligence’s point man for the prosecution of political warfare,Fleming had been the first to realise that U-boat crews could be targeted byanother twist in the uses of radio. Atlantik Sender would employ a heady mix ofsex and music, and team him with his pre-war compatriot, Sefton Delmer, andanother Naval Intelligence colleague, Donald MacLachlan, who had also been aTimes correspondent in the years before the war. And when the station begantransmitting in the spring of 1943, it was badly needed as the fight against theU-boat menace was becoming increasingly desperate.Nothing was considered too far-fetched in the fight against the wolf packs.images [images/icon.jpg]Many years later, when Winston Churchill was asked what had been his greatestworry throughout the six years of the fighting, he replied without hesitation:the U-boats. Indeed, the Battle of the Atlantic was both crucial and decisive, arelentless exchange that spanned from the first hours of the war – when U-30torpedoed the passenger liner Athenia off Rockall – to the very last, when, onthe same day that Adolf Hitler committed suicide in the Berlin bunker, the firstType XII U-boat – the most technically advanced submarine ever built in wartime– slipped into the cold waters off the coast of Bergen Harbour.The fight against the grey wolves, as the U-boats were known to their crews,would involve many thousands of people, by far the more exotic of whom werepropagandists and secret agents. Their unsung, yet key, role in the battle isonly now being appreciated for it was, in the prime minister’s graphic phrase, a‘war of groping and drowning, of ambuscade and stratagem, of science andseamanship’.Nothing too outrageous would be rejected in the fight against the U-boats. ‘TheBattle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war,’ WinstonChurchill would write. ‘Not for one moment could we forget that everythinghappening elsewhere, on land, at sea, or in the air, depended ultimately on itsoutcome.’The combat was merciless, appalling and all the more horrifying for itsfacelessness. There were terrible losses experienced on both sides. Though theU-boat crews were portrayed by German propaganda as heroes who formed aswaggering elite, all were only too well aware that they were mostly doomed. Astaggering 70 per cent of all German submariners lost their lives, with mostonly ever expecting to survive their first journeys to sea. Leading them wasAdmiral Karl Dönitz, a U-boat Commander in the First World War (when he had alsobeen taken prisoner) who has been aptly described as ‘one of the most able,daring and versatile flag officers on either side of the war’ by the official UShistorian of the conflict.Like so many others in post-Versailles Germany, Dönitz had remained in theservice of the reconstituted German Navy for reasons of prestige. In January1943, when he became Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, his apotheosis wascomplete. ‘I wanted to imbue my crews with enthusiasm and a complete faith toinstill in them a spirit of selfless readiness to serve,’ he would remark. Theirbehaviour at sea was uniquely informal, where the privations alone meant thatthey didn’t have to wear uniforms; nor did they have to remove their beards(there was never enough spare water to allow them the luxury of a shave).After the fall of France in 1940, Dönitz set up his bases on the Biscay coast toshorten the boats’ journeys into the killing fields of the North Atlantic.Marshalled into wolf packs, the submarines would form a line and wait forconvoys to appear after being spotted. The sheer size of the Atlantic alone maderadio communications a necessity. When hunting in the packs, a U-boat – or aFocke Wulf Condor reconnaissance aircraft – would radio the position where aconvoy had been encountered. In the operations room at Lorient, all the U-boatswould then be directed by radio to converge in the vicinity.Dönitz’s use of signals intelligence grew out of necessity. The Grossadmiral’striumph led to his greatest weakness: careful control of the submarines meantthey had to be in constant radio contact with Berlin. A network of Alliedlistening stations was thus alert for these transmissions. Triangulation allowedthem to estimate where each U-boat was located. More so than codebreaking, theBritish use of direction finding would be the key to the Battle of the Atlantic,particularly in the period of blackouts when the German naval codes weren’tbeing read.Very few people appreciate that Bletchley Park was locked out of the navalEnigma code for most of 1942, and by the start of 1943, when they were back in,events were looking even more apocalyptic. The Battle of the Atlantic wouldreach its terrifying climax when two convoys lost twenty-two ships in half thatnumber of days at the start of March 1943. If losses had continued at that rate,the results for the Allies would have been disastrous. Anglo-American operationsin the Mediterranean would have failed, aid to Russia would have dwindled awayand there would have been no possibility for an invasion of Western Europe in1944. Indeed, some historians have speculated that Britain could well have beenstarved into submission.images [images/icon.jpg]Life aboard the U-boats was unremittingly harsh.There were no bathing facilities, fresh air was at a premium, as was privacy,and crews constantly complained of rheumatic pains. Technically speaking, thesubmarines were not totally submersible: they spent most of their time on thesurface, which meant the crews had to suffer endless rolling from Atlanticswells. Lookouts got very wet and very cold very quickly. And yet, despite thehardships, the crews were ‘engulfed in comradeship’, in the simple phrase ofone, much to the chagrin of the British secret services who spent a great dealof time trying to understand why their spirits remained so high.‘The morale of U-Boat crews continues good and is not thought likely to declineseriously although since the Russian successes it may have become slightly morebrittle,’ one psychological evaluation records in early 1943. ‘U-Boats are nowbeing manned by younger officers and possess a high standard of personalmorale.’Given their terrible losses, no wonder so many German submariners took refuge insuperstition. Fairly quickly, some boats and certain commanders were consideredluckier than others. The sentimental mysticism of the Deutsches Volk inevitablycombined with other strains of Teutonic fatalism far out in the Atlantic.Crewmen often wore ‘lucky sweaters’ knitted by loved ones as well as BritishArmy apparel which had been liberated from depots in France.Such superstitions became a more fertile ground for subversion.To play on these fears came another remarkable publication called Der Zenit(Zenith), which was aptly named. It would represent the very apotheosis of theuses of astrology in the secret war, thanks to Tom Delmer, who, by now, was, asone colleague would write, ‘both inimitable and too successful to be interferedwith’.For his ‘tame astrologer’, it came not a moment too soon.images [images/icon.jpg]A certain desperation had accompanied Louis de Wohl’s other work.According to his memoirs and the interviews he gave later, the previous summerof 1942, a British officer bought him details of two birth dates and exacttimes. ‘I cannot divulge their names,’ he said, ‘but we would like you to tellus what is in store for these two for this year.’ That July he declared that theolder of the two would triumph. ‘His chart is on the rise and success willfollow him from now on.’ As this was supposed to be Bernard Law Montgomery, deWohl took credit for seeing his victory at El Alamein.By now, there had been official recognition that astrologers might actually tipoff the enemy by making inadvertently accurate predictions. At a meeting of theWar Cabinet’s Civil Defence Committee in the previous January, the whole matterof printing horoscopes and the press was discussed. As the discussions went backand forth (against: they ‘had a harmful effect on public morale’; or for: theywere not accurate ‘but on the one or two sensational instances’ where true), thePrincipal Secretary of the Ministry of Information was asked to investigate.To their surprise, they found the earlier investigation from the previous July.‘The astrologers have a considerable amusement value,’ the committee concluded,‘but otherwise exert very little influence in the public, except in the case ofneurotic individuals, for whom they supply a relatively harmless trap.’Yet, oddly, the boil was broken with a discussion in that most public of arenas,the House of Commons. When, in the summer of 1942, the latest Minister ofInformation, Brendan Bracken, was asked in the House whether he would stopastrological predictions, there was much merriment and laughter.‘Astrologers seem to have the misfortune to be perpetually in conflict,’ Brackennoted. ‘And, as no sensible person takes their predictions seriously, I cannotask our overworked censors to meddle in their mysteries.’The Member for Twickenham then responded in kind. ‘It is well known that Hitlerdabbles in astrology. May it not be that certain articles are written for him?’There was further mirth when he stated that there was no monopoly on Hitler’sastrologers. Manny Shinwell, an old Labour war horse, saw a golden opportunity.The previous weekend, a tabloid had carried a story that suggested a verydifferent form of conflict.‘Is the Minister aware that one astrologer predicted last Sunday a governmentcrisis this month? Is there any truth in that?’images [images/icon.jpg]It was typical of Tom Delmer’s wartime activities that the first time heencountered Agnes Bernelle was in the convivial social whirl surrounding themore cultured of German-émigré circles in London. Agnes Bernelle was, as helater termed her, just a spotty-faced teenager, hardly the siren she wouldbecome when she took to the airwaves. In the ether, with her gravelly voice akinto that of Lotte Lenya, it was not too hard to imagine her living in an Otto Dixpainting. Her father, Rudolf, who had been both a well-known composer ofsatirical songs in Weimar Germany and a successful theatrical impresario, hadlong thought her voice would be ideal for broadcasting.And when Tom Delmer heard her singing, he knew he had found the perfectinstrument for Atlantik Sender. Like a music hall manager manqué, Delmer wouldtransform Agnes Bernelle into a potent, alluring weapon of the airwaves. TheU-boat crews would soon be taken in by her beautiful, breathy voice, leavingthem hanging on for more.Born in 1923 as Agnes Bernauer, she and her family had lived a gilded existencein Weimar Berlin. Spoiled yet playful, she grew up around the theatre and in1930 was cast in a film playing a little boy. Hers was a comfortable, bourgeoisexistence and she, spoiled and indulged, liked to dress up; but then, to befair, so did the Nazis. Her mother’s family was Jewish and she was brought up aProtestant, which didn’t seem to bother her family. Her father was Hungarian,which meant that she could travel on a Hungarian passport when the going gottough.Given the political ferment of the times, she learned early the value of satirefrom her father, who, as she admitted, had foibles that were women and cards.Rudolf Bernauer had worked as an actor, then performed in plays and cabaretbefore buying several theatres. ‘He was a very honest man,’ she recalled, ‘butat times took his honesty to ridiculous lengths.’ He would never smuggle moneyout of Germany and had only a gold watch on him when they did eventually leavefor London.The Bernauer family knew Marlene Dietrich and Albert Einstein lived nearby. Butby far the most astounding encounter came when she was older and was waiting onthe Unter den Linden. She happened upon a politician in the street whom shecouldn’t help from noticing had interesting colouring and, much as she hated toadmit it, was attractive.‘He had red hair and very bright blue eyes,’ Agnes recalled many years later.She was near enough to him that ‘I could kill him if I had a gun’. Fairlyswiftly, this self same rabble-rouser took over the country. And with the fullconfidence of youth, Agnes sensed just how Adolf Hitler was going to changethings. ‘Whereas my Jewish relatives on my father’s side were either killed ortortured in the camps,’ she recalled, ‘members of my mother’s “Aryan” familymarried men in Nazi uniform.’ When her mother was later asked to take somedocuments over the border for obvious Nazi ‘goons’, she knew that it was time toleave.In 1936, she persuaded her father to move to London. Finding the repression andcold of England hard to take at first – her Mitteleuropean vulgarity, as shetermed it, shocked many of her new friends at boarding school – they were ableto settle in London as he had been ghostwriting films. Changing their name toBernelle, her father once more took ownership of theatres and later directedlow-budget films. While attending school in North London, Rudolf Bernelle lether daughter perform with the Free German League of Culture as a social andartistic forum.Strange as it may seem to posterity, in all the time she worked for SeftonDelmer, Agnes Bernelle did not know his real name. He was only ever known to heras ‘the beard’, ‘as no one in our outfit was allowed to know the identity ofthose above or below them’. She would be driven each day to Woburn Abbey where,as she later recalled, the studio had been ‘built into the chapel in one of theAbbey’s wings, which would explain its stain-glassed windows’.As well as talking between records, Agnes would record German versions of songsin the cottage she shared with two other girls. Somewhere in the social whirl ofthe time, she met a dashing Spitfire pilot who, amongst many other claims tofame, was the cousin of Winston Churchill. Desmond Leslie was a composer, acollector of electronic noise and a believer in UFOs. He was entranced by theheavens, having seen ‘an immense green fireball move slowly across the sky anddisappear behind the Sussex Downs’ as a schoolboy. As to his piloting skills, afamily historian tellingly recalled: ‘He destroyed a number of aircraft, most ofwhich he was piloting at the time.’images [images/icon.jpg]Colonel John H. Bevan MC was a frail-looking insomniac, rumoured to possess thebest polished shoes in the British Army. Memorably described as having ‘sleepy,pale-blue eyes and thin fair hair which turned grey from the strain [of] work’,he would turn around the fortunes of the London Controlling Section after takingit over at the end of June 1942. When he took over in the basement at Storey’sGate, Bevan – like his only member of staff before him – was amazed at howlittle was happening.‘Our staff duties are pretty poor aren’t they Dennis?’ he said one day to theoccult writer.‘No sir, I’m afraid they aren’t quite all they might be.’As Dennis Wheatley relates, they had been operating in a vacuum. They needed abetter sense of purpose and what that meant was, thanks to Bevan’s greatknowledge of the army, ‘a directive’. So he and Bevan worked on the scope of theLondon Controlling Section.‘And from that point,’ Wheatley said, ‘Johnny Bevan and I went to work.’It would be easy to over-emphasise the importance and significance of the LondonControlling Section under Johnny Bevan. In a matter of weeks, the colonelrecruited more members in an attempt to give the section a higher profile. Knownas mysterious yet clever men, their exact duties were never quite clear, whichforewent most people taking too much of an interest. They would soon famously becharacterised by Dennis Wheatley as ‘a stockbroker, a thriller writer, a soapmanufacturer and a retired civil servant, all disguised as officers only for thepurposes of war’.They worked in what was known as Mr Rance’s room, close by the Joint PlanningStaff. It was subterranean and secure, covered by 4ft of hardened concrete,reinforced by tramlines, which shored up the room where they were meeting. ‘Thisunderground fortress resembled the lower decks of a battleship,’ Dennis Wheatleylater vividly recalled. ‘It was white-painted and along the ceilings of itsnarrow passages ran a mass of cables carrying light, heat, telephone and airconditioning to the many rooms, most of which were like ship’s cabins.’And it was a happy ship, more like a prefect’s room at a public school where,unusually for the time, everyone was on first-name terms. ‘We were a team,’Wheatley recalled, ‘a good team, and by and large a happy one.’After its faltering start, the London Controlling Section would become sosuccessful that it attracted its fair share of jealous critics. In later years,many who had served alongside them were less than complimentary. Some saw JohnnyBevan and his cronies as indolent amateurs whose greater priorities were shownby their permanent table at Rules restaurant.Its expansion had a great deal more to do with the liaison with MI5 and MI6,helped by Johnny Bevan’s membership of the XX Committee. Bevan also createdseparate committees which would leak information, some via the double agents butalso other channels. ‘Close liaison with the Political Warfare Executive wasalso necessary,’ one chronicler of the deceivers notes, ‘to make sure thatpropaganda did not inadvertently lead the Axis to draw conclusions withdeception plans.’If Bevan provided the cool head of the operation, Wheatley was its flamboyantheart. And in very short order, strategic deception became a well-oiled machinewhose efficiency was fine-tuned by the Enigma decrypts which were streaming fromBletchley Park. With Colonel Johnny Bevan’s arrival, they revolutionised thework of deception. Up to this point, most of the work had been piecemeal anduncoordinated: now it would go to the heart of the fighting of the war.images [images/icon.jpg]Under Sefton Delmer’s equally expert tutelage, Louis de Wohl had also finallybeen given something useful to do. By the summer of 1942, de Wohl was holed upin Atheneum Court, a Piccadilly hotel, where he was paid in cash from secretslush funds but only as a part-time job. That explained why, in Delmer’s amusedrecollection, his tame astrologer had been spotted ‘walking down Piccadilly justlike an unmade bed’.In August 1942, despite being ‘warned off’ – according to a note from an unnamedMI6 officer – de Wohl had been put into contact with the PWE, who reported thathe was still wearing a captain’s uniform. ‘Is it really possible that this manis allowed to wear the uniform of a British officer?’ a senior MI6 man exclaimedwhen they heard. ‘Surely it is time the gullible were protected from thecreature.’For most of the time, Sefton Delmer appears to have just about been able to keepa straight face when he dealt with his increasingly troublesome diviner ofheavenly intentions, terming him a sinister-looking creature.At times, the astrologer was painfully aware that he was being treated less thanrespectfully. Louis de Wohl became petulant. In time, he became such a nuisancethat he was banned from one central London office used by his superiors. SoSefton Delmer was forced to visit him at his apartment in Atheneum Court, wherehe was holed up alone, ‘a vast spectacled jellyfish [of] a man dressed in theuniform of a British Army Captain, puffing over-dimensional rings of smoke froman over-dimensional cigar,’ the propagandist recalled. His warnings had littleeffect on the astrologer’s general behaviour. One messenger who regularly tookhim his money complained that de Wohl kept gassing on for hours about hisastrological predictions. But soon there was an instrument through which theycould be channelled.Towards the end of 1942, he was asked to provide copy for half a dozen issues ofa black ‘astrological magazine’ which were squarely aimed at U-boat crews. TheSpecial Operations Executive was then used to distribute copies of Der Zenitthroughout the French Atlantic ports. It was later noted with some satisfactionthat Admiral Dönitz himself was paying attention to its advice about whenU-boats should not depart on ‘unfavourable days’.Der Zenit skilfully incorporated the dates of known sinkings. By backdating itspredictions, U-boat crews would, it was hoped, come to think of the magazine asparticularly omniscient. Certain future dates were then identified withastrologically unsound conditions along the lines that some departure days werebetter for older vessels or that a particular captain was ill-starred. Seeminglygenuine, it carried adverts for obscure medicines and genuine Germanastrological books. Although the standard of each issue improved, by March 1943Delmer and de Wohl made a curious mistake.In that month’s issue they identified the editor as one Dr Hubert Korsch, awell-known pre-war astrologer. In fact, by then he had been incarcerated in aconcentration camp for two years. Most of the time, Delmer humoured thecorpulent German to make his life easier. The astrologer refused to amend hispredictions, but luckily Delmer found they often coincided with the greaterneeds of psychological warfare. To create even more confusion in the mind ofU-boat crewmen, Delmer would turn his attentions to the same electromagneticmedium that made tracking the U-boats possible at the very moment of theirgreatest success.images [images/icon.jpg]When Atlantik Sender began its broadcasts on 18 March 1943, it did so at theheight of the Battle of the Atlantic. Allied losses had been steadily mounting;1942 had been disastrous so far as merchant shipping was concerned. In June, thesinkings were the greatest of the war – 834,196 tons of shipping – so much sothat American shipyards could not replace all the sunken ships. By the start of1943, the cumulative losses were nudging 8 million tons, much of it sent to thebottom along the Eastern Seaboard.‘Our submarines are operating close inshore along the coast of the UnitedStates,’ Karl Dönitz himself would crow, ‘so that bathers and sometimes entirecoastal cities are witnesses of that drama whose visual climaxes are constitutedby the red glorioles of blazing tankers.’At the start of 1943, Dönitz had the greatest number of U-boats he had ever hadat his disposal. German industry was producing the submarines faster than theAllies could sink them. Bad weather in January reduced the tonnage that wassunk, but the losses were gradually rising in the spring despite the inclementconditions – from 203,000 tons in January to 360,000 tons in February. It lookedlike March’s loss would double that figure again.So now, at the start of the month, the stakes were at their greatest.The situation was self-evidently so bad that precipitate action commended itselfto the men in Whitehall. Nothing less than the removal of Karl Dönitz himself,it was suggested, could solve their problems. That same month, the SpecialOperations Executive was asked to look at how to reduce the efficiency of theU-boats by sabotaging their fuel supplies, their torpedoes, their batteries andall the crews’ ‘amenities’ on land.But more terminal action might be necessary to settle the matter once and forall. ‘The assassination of Admiral Dönitz and/or the blowing up of hisHeadquarters in Paris would profoundly affect the morale of U-boat crews andU-boat operations,’ a file from the Special Operations Executive records,testimony to just how desperate the situation was.images [images/icon.jpg]Under Tom Delmer’s benign patronage, Agnes Bernelle had been transformed into asiren of the airwaves. On Atlantik Sender she became known as ‘Vicky’, quicklybecoming known as a German Vera Lynn whose signature tune was the highlyappropriate A Smooth One. Her fame spread far and wide – not just to the U-boatcrews but all over the world – thanks to the power of the Aspidistratransmitter. Agnes also broadcast on Soldatensender West, supposedly run by apatriotic old curmudgeon who subverted the Nazi regime. To her amazement, shereceived letters that seemed to emanate from Occupied Europe, forwarded, so shethought, by the Swedish Embassy. As Agnes relates in her autobiography, the mainattraction was the constant stream of jazz, a musical form which Hitlerconsidered abhorrent and decadent. ‘This made the German forces want to listento us,’ Agnes wrote, ‘and since the music was interspersed with items of newsand other subtly disguised pieces of propaganda, they would invariably get theinformation we wanted them to have.’The accuracy was vouchsafed by prisoners of war – often taken blindfolded to thestudios as volunteers. A vast network of information was produced to targetthem. As a supposedly patriotic station, Vicky would criticise hoarders asunprincipled, then the audience would cause a run on certain items. ‘If wewanted to lower the morale of the soldiers,’ Agnes wrote, ‘I would simply tell acertain battalion that although it was surrounded and trapped, all was not lost,and I would play them a cheerful tune.’Some Germans, she hoped, would surrender while they had the chance.images [images/icon.jpg]Even though it was clear that the tide of war was on the turn, Adolf Hitlerstill had, at the start of 1943, the satisfaction of knowing that his forceswere arrayed from the north of Norway to the Spanish border, across at leastfour time zones and three different climate regions. His soldiers were freezingin the shadows of the Caucasus and sweltering in dugouts across parts of theNorth African desert.Yet now came an even swifter reversal of fortune within the tangled intelligenceworld of Nazi Germany. Perceptions of Admiral Canaris and the Abwehr wouldchange dramatically. More so than the rise of the SS Sicherheitsdienst –temporarily halted by the removal of its former chief, Reinhard Heydrich, at thehands of Czech partisans the previous summer – the waning of Admiral Canaris’sinfluence would come to paralyse the German intelligence machine.The successful Torch landings, in French Vichy-held territory in North Africatowards the end of 1942, more or less set the seal on the admiral’s career. Whenexperts at the Kriegsmarine Directorate of Naval Warfare analysed theinformation which had been available to the Abwehr, they concluded ‘in thisintelligence battle, we lost the day’.‘Yet again,’ fumed Hitler’s chief military adviser, General Alfred Jodl,‘Canaris’s imprudence and inconsistency has landed us in the soup.’The Abwehr was supposed to provide the Führer, the Supreme Command and theGeneral Staff with everything it needed for the successful prosecution of war.Yet it never actually warned of El Alamein nor the invasions of French NorthAfrica and Sicily or the landings at Anzio. The Abwehr’s fate would also besealed when it singularly failed to report the Soviet build-up around Stalingradat the start of 1943. It had already enraged the Führer by failing to anticipatethe Soviet T-54 tank, the most efficient ordnance on the battlefield, whichcould outrun and outgun anything in the Wehrmacht’s considerable armoury.Admiral Canaris rarely visited Hitler and the Supreme Command anymore. By thestart of 1943, two of his deputies were in jail, undergoing a Gestapoinvestigation into their loyalties and various nefarious activities against thestate. More than anything else, what the admiral had feared all along would nowcome to pass: an extended examination of the Abwehr by Himmler’s men, exposingits inefficiencies for all the world to see.It had all started with something that was fairly routine within the ThirdReich’s espionage services. In the autumn of 1942, a German businessman by thename of Schmidhuber was arrested in Switzerland. Like so many other Abwehrinformants, he was making a nice little packet smuggling foreign currency in andout of Zurich. The head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller, had him arrested as hefelt there was more to what he was actually doing than met the eye.During interrogation, Schmidhuber obligingly sang like the proverbial canary. Heclaimed that he had heard of a ‘generals’ clique’ which was plotting against theNazis to end the war as well as the extending of peace feelers towards theBritish via the Vatican. Even worse, a number of Jews had been exfiltrated outof Germany by enrolling them in the Abwehr and making it appear as though theywere involved in intelligence operations.Schmidhuber knew about these various intrigues as he was close to one ofCanaris’s senior lieutenants, a political adviser called Hans von Dohnayi, andoften visited the Abwehr’s chief of staff, General Hans Oster. Both, thebusinessman claimed, had betrayed military secrets and were personally involvedin plotting against the Führer. When Canaris’s men became aware that theirfriend had been incarcerated, it was too late for them to do anything.After so much smoke, here was a tangible conflagration of the various intrigueswhich were being directed against the state. General Müller wanted to raid theAbwehr’s Tirpitzufer headquarters for he believed that Admiral Canaris himselfwas complicit in all these treasons. Given the obvious political sensitivities,such an action had to be approved by Heinrich Himmler.To the Gestapo chief’s amazement, when the docket came back the Reichsführer-SShad written in his own hand: ‘Kindly leave Canaris alone!’ In all the mysteriesthat surround the great enigma of how the admiral survived for so long, this isby far the most curious.Was Himmler actually protecting Canaris?One of the Reichsführer-SS’s biographers asserts that the head of the SS was‘wedded to Canaris by an almost grotesque overestimate of his professionalability’. Indeed, much of the admiral’s longevity owed to the fact that Himmlerviewed him as some sort of genius and, to some extent, continued to protect him.This may partly have come from the SS leader’s growing realisation that he mightprofit from the sorts of connections the Abwehr was trying to extend to theenemy. With the self-evident failure of the Russian campaign into the laterwinter of 1943, Himmler was certainly nudged in the direction of defeatism byhis own foreign intelligence chief, Walter Schellenberg, which would propel themboth in the most bizarre of directions towards astrology (a story told in thenext chapter).Yet nobody was completely immune from prosecution in a police state.Early in April 1943, a surprise raid from the Gestapo descended on theTirpitzufer. Despite a tip-off from a fellow conspirator, both Dohnayi and Osterwere arrested, tortured, interrogated and eventually executed.Canaris’s almost feral instinct for survival now reasserted itself.The admiral dropped all contacts with his deputies. Though there was not enoughevidence to tie him to the conspirators, he came under increasing suspicion fromhis rivals in the SS and the Sicherheitsdienst. To add to the confusion,Heinrich Himmler himself took a great deal of personal interest in these sortsof intrigues. And, as ever in the acres of speculation concerning AdmiralCanaris’s true intentions, the name of someone familiar to these pages once morereappears.That of Ian Lancaster Fleming.images [images/icon.jpg]So far as the prosecution of psychological warfare was concerned, AtlantikSender started right on time. To date, though, most of the fighting had occurredwithin Whitehall over just who should be responsible for such activities. It hadbeen a miracle that the station ever got on the air, given all the bickeringabout who should actually ‘own’ the transmitter which preceded it. By the autumnof 1942, however, Admiral John Godfrey had been prevailed upon to help fight theU-boat menace, so much so that, in his own words, ‘an element of perfidy,verging on the unscrupulous’ was necessary. The Director of Naval Intelligencelooked no further than his special assistant to ensure that the myriadpossibilities of broadcasting subversive material could be realised. Whereverthere were difficulties, Ian Fleming would invariably help resolve them. Hisspecial assistant would happily call some luminary with the words ‘AdmiralGodfrey feels very strongly about this’, and, as his colleague Donald McLachlanwryly noted, the problem would be smoothed over with an inevitable inquiry aboutthe admiral’s personal assistant, ‘a giant among name droppers’.It was worth it. Atlantik Sender was an unexpected hit.Much to their amazement, the naval interrogators found that many captured U-boatcrews were only too delighted to help bring down the Third Reich. Potentialscriptwriters were carefully screened to ensure they provided all the latestU-boat jargon and background information to make the broadcasts seem as genuineas possible. Many captured crewmen were used for the actual broadcasts whenVicky herself was unavailable.Thanks to the reading of Enigma, it became clear that the Germans themselvesthought that the station’s eclectic mix of information was coming from agents inhigh places, possibly including ones in the Führer’s headquarters. Fleming andDelmer’s work helped perpetuate the powerful myth that the British SecretService was omniscient.In time, Atlantik Sender would subtly undermine every aspect of life at sea byspreading confusion with a beguiling mix of truth and horrifying rumour whichwould reduce morale. Tom Delmer ensured the compilation of a huge file of gossipand personal details that had been collected from intercepted prisoner of warcorrespondence. This allowed Vicky to display an intimate acquaintance with her‘dear boys in blue’, as she called them. Coded messages, disguised as recordlabels and catalogue numbers, were also targeted for resistance fighters.Agnes Bernelle herself was in no doubt that the only way to make people listen –as she had done in her various pre-war cabaret shows – was to be funny. On onefamous occasion, she announced over the airwaves on Atlantik Sender that byspecial request of the comrade ‘blockade-runners who are getting awfully boreddown there in the Gironde Estuary while they await orders to sail’ she wouldplay a choice selection of music ‘from our brave allies in the East’. Thereaftercame an hilarious cacophony of Japanese and Chinese records.Vicky’s very charm was in direct contrast to the unnerving content of many ofthe broadcasts. In later years, Agnes Bernelle often related how the words ofGertrude Stein stayed with her. ‘Everything is so dangerous that nothing isreally frightening’ was a quote that could apply equally well to her own life –as well as those of the submariners to whom she directly appealed. Vicky’sgreatest success was in telling the captain of one particular U-boat that hiswife had given birth to twins. As he had not had leave for two years, in oneaccount he surrendered his boat straight away to be with his family. On anotheroccasion, Vicky also caused chaos in the German post office by announcing thatthe Führer required all good citizens to send samples of urine to the Ministryof Health.Humour aside, many of the broadcasts were designed to be unsettling.Tom Delmer would ensure that information about the losses of crews and theeffects of bombing on the homeland was purposefully included in Vicky’sbroadcasts. Truthful information about the latest allied mining operations wasalso mixed in with false claims. That way, the U-boat crews couldn’t help butwonder if whole swathes of the Atlantic were simply too dangerous to navigate.By August 1943, the Gestapo had become so impressed by the station that itsindividual claims were being investigated for how they might have been obtained.According to their best guess, the station’s transmitter was based inSwitzerland, from where, ironically, the MI6 station in Berne reported inFebruary 1944 that ‘despite the death penalty for listening to illegalbroadcasts, Atlantik Sender is the most popular. The impression gained from PoWsinterrogated [is] that listening at their bases to Atlantik broadcasts is nowthe rule for naval personnel rather than the exception.’images [images/icon.jpg]Did Admiral Wilhelm Canaris actively plan to actually meet with his oppositenumbers in the Allied secret services? It is a stark question which severalpeople have posed, yet another thread connected to the enigma that is the Abwehrchief around this time. It became entwined with his involvement in many murkyand mysterious intrigues, many of which were further rebuffed due to thepervasive influence of one of the most damaging of spies in the history ofBritish Intelligence.If some accounts are to be believed, Canaris wanted to meet both his oppositenumbers – Sir Stewart Menzies and ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan – in Portugal, an eventthat has been characterised as a ‘clandestine encounter between three men whocontrolled the most powerful espionage networks in the contemporary world’.As ever, these stories are exaggerations which result from an intriguing and, asalways with Admiral Canaris, opaque reality. Because of his regular visits toSpain – and in particular, the Algeciras outstation – it was suggested that somesort of accommodation with the Abwehr chief might be considered. As ever, themore egregious claims came from our old friend Donald McCormick, concerning therecollections of a Royal Naval Attaché who picked up whispers from contacts thatno less a personage than Admiral Canaris ‘dropped hints that he might have talkswith a certain naval person’.Needless to say, this was Commander Ian Fleming.‘At times it seemed as though Canaris was practically inviting the NavalIntelligence Division to open secret negotiations with him,’ McCormick claimsthat another of Fleming’s colleagues recalled. ‘But with Canaris one couldn’t bequite sure what his motives were.’As ever, this is just the usual kind of speculative nonsense surrounding JamesBond’s creator that ties various loose ends of a story into a more attractivewhole. For around this time in the fighting, there was a great deal of smokeemanating from a low-burning fire connected to Admiral Canaris’s intentions. Inone account, Sir Stewart Menzies said after the war that attempts to contact theAbwehr chief had been overruled by the Foreign Office for fear of offending theSoviet Union. In another account, one senior diplomat was asked a pointedquestion by an intelligence source: ‘Would you like to meet Canaris?’Though the truth is, as ever, somewhat more elusive. There was an importantchange to the prosecution of the war that had prompted these overtures. By 1943,greater urgency about the resolution of the war had come about thanks to theAllied leaders’ declaration of ‘Unconditional Surrender’ at the Casablancaconference that January. At the end of a military strategy session, FranklinDelano Roosevelt used the phrase that, he later claimed, was a soundbite thatresonated in American history, originally coined by General Ulysses Grant.The president’s public insistence that nothing less than complete and totalsurrender of the Axis powers would be accepted by the Allies certainly causedshock. Take a look at the newsreel footage of the press conference where WinstonChurchill’s reaction was the same as if somebody had slapped him in the facewith a giant fish. Others in the military were stunned, too. If there had beenconditions attached to a potential surrender, the growing internal conspiracyagainst the Nazi regime – centred on the Abwehr, in particular – might have beenmore emboldened.As several historians have pondered, even if an assassination of Adolf Hitlerhad been successful, would the rest of the German military have taken ordersfrom the conspirators? In any case, without the remote possibility of apolitical settlement, why would they ever need to kill the Führer? The stage wasset for what Josef Goebbels termed ‘total war’ in a rabble-rousing speech whichinduced the German determination to fight to the end. There was head-shakingincomprehension on the Allied Side. Sir Stewart Menzies himself warned the primeminister directly that the Germans would now fight ‘with the despairing ferocityof cornered rats’.images [images/icon.jpg]Much of the confusion, and indeed misinformation, surrounding the various peacefeelers supposedly emanating from Admiral Canaris himself has a human cause. KimPhilby ensured that in his position as head of MI6 counter-espionage in Iberiahe would undermine any attempt to make peace. Such rumours, even if unfounded,would as a matter of routine enter his in tray, and he was in a position to dosomething about them.The merest possibility of a separate Allied-German peace settlement remainedhigh on the list of Josef Stalin’s considerable collection of paranoias. As ahighly placed mole, Philby was especially alert for any intrigues that mightcircumvent the influence or safety of the Soviet Union. In one former MI6colleague’s recollection, reports that the admiral wanted to meet were dismissedby Philby as ‘mere speculation’ and their circulation was deliberately limited.More lurid stories still have emerged concerning the assassination of theadmiral himself and his own role in attempting to murder the Führer. Accordingto some accounts, Sir Stewart Menzies himself wanted to meet Admiral Canaris ata castle on the border with Portugal. Indeed, Abwehr decrypts revealed that‘Father Christmas’ was going to be driving from Madrid to Seville on oneparticular day. This, some officers in MI6 suggested, would provide an idealtime to assassinate C’s opposite number.‘I want no action whatsoever taken against the Admiral,’ Philby recalls SirStewart writing in a memo in his personal green ink. If it survives – or everexisted – nobody has ever seen it. In another account, a British launch took theadmiral to meet Sir Stewart at La Linea in Gibraltar, where they discussed waysof bringing the fighting to a close by killing Hitler.Most of these stories can be shown to emanate from mischief-making (a great dealby Philby) long after the war. Sir Stewart Menzies did make a foreign trip toAlgiers around this time, but there is no evidence that Wilhelm Canaris was inIberia at the same time. And though the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Servicewould hardly write ‘off to meet my opposite number’ in his diary, there was nosuch evidence that he ever contemplated such a move.When the late Professor Keith Jeffery came to look through the MI6 archives towrite his authorised history, there was little concrete evidence to show anydirect ties between the admiral and the British Secret Service. There were ahandful of indirect ones, which Prof. Jeffery referred to as ‘the only recordedface-to-face meeting between Canaris and anyone reporting directly to SIS’.They concerned Hala Szymanskà, the wife of a Polish military attaché, who wasnow working as a translator in Berne, a sinecure which had been suggested to herby the wily admiral, who had known her before the war. ‘Canaris knew thatanything he told this Polish lady would be reported,’ reflected another MI6officer long after the war, ‘she being a patriotic Pole. Straight to Polishintelligence, who would, of course, pass it on to us.’Another intriguing aspect to the story – that was not referred to in theauthorised history of the Secret Intelligence Service – was another salient,well-established fact: Wilhelm Canaris also had a mistress in Vienna whosesister was married to Menzies’s brother, Ian. Much was made of this by DuskoPopov in his memoirs, which were written in the seventies. According to Popov’saccount, British spymaster and self-styled master spy encountered each other atthe start of 1943 when they separated from a dinner party under the guise ofdrinking whisky sodas.Menzies, as he had already minuted the prime minister, was completely aghastconcerning the merest contemplation of unconditional surrender. ‘As a phrase, Ipersonally dislike it,’ C is quoted as saying. ‘It means nothing.’ In Popov’srecollection, the Chief of MI6 thought that a negotiated peace may have beenpossible before Roosevelt’s unequivocal pronouncement.Sir Stewart apparently wanted Dusko Popov to be alert for any whispers of plotsto bring down the Führer from his own contacts in Germany. As Popov laterrelated, one of his old university friends who was now in the Abwehr wasincredulous about the removal of the leader. ‘Why the hell should the Allieswant to get rid of Hitler?’ his friend exclaimed on one occasion. ‘He’s winningthe war for them!’And the same could be said of Admiral Canaris and the agency he directed. Therewas certainly a grim logic behind the leaving of both the Führer and his wilyintelligence chief in place. With Adolf Hitler in power, the war would continueon its wayward course: with Wilhelm Canaris remaining in office, there wouldclearly be no German victory in the intelligence war. Yet the dangers for theadmiral now intensified in the remaining two years of the fighting. Though theSchmidhuber affair had not succeeded in landing any punches, the Gestapo alreadyhad compiled reports about Canaris’s unreliability that ran to several volumes.‘Abroad he was widely regarded as the sinister deus ex machina behind all thecrimes of the National Socialist regime,’ wrote Wilhelm Höttl, a member of theSicherheitsdienst after the war. ‘His friends profess to see in him thespiritual leader of all the opposition movements against Hitler and a martyr inthe cause of the fight against National Socialism.’The enigma of Canaris and his true loyalties remains deep.Even with Himmler’s blessing – on one occasion the Reichsführer-SS famouslyremarked that ‘the old man should be left in peace’ – quite why or how theadmiral survived has never been satisfactorily explained, even with the limitedrelease of some diplomatic files in both the British and American nationalarchives of their dealings with the Abwehr at the time. Rather like the Führerhimself, his military intelligence chief had the luck of the devil.images [images/icon.jpg]As the tide of the war changed in those first few months of 1943, Louis deWohl’s involvement in the secret war reached its own high-water mark. Many yearslater, the manner of his prognostications were gently sent up by Tom Delmer whenhe recalled his seer would often frown ‘at me with terrifying ferocity as thoughto reproach me for my infidel cynicism’. By the late summer of 1943, de Wohlworked on a supposed ‘secret’ interpretation of Nostradamus’s predictions with anew twist designed for the purposes of political warfare.The results would also be inveigled into Occupied Europe by SOE-sponsoredpartisans to undermine the very basis for the Führer’s continuing suitability tolead the Reich, as well as his health. There were fifty bogus quatrains inarchaic French, whose German translation refers to ‘Hister’ winning morevictories than was good for him and later being murdered by six men in the night(‘Naked, taken unawares without his armour, he succumbs’). It bore the imprintof Regulus Verlag, a company which had produced genuine occult and astrologicalpublications before the war.Attached to a 100-page booklet called Nostradamus prophecies the course of thewar was what appeared to be a secretly distributed note – supposedly written byKarl Krafft, the Hitlerian astrologer – explaining that its contents were sodangerous, it was implied he had been abducted by the SS because of thestartling accuracy of his predictions. ‘Here, as promised, is the carbon of myletter to the Führer,’ Krafft had supposedly written as a kind of insurancepolicy. ‘I know it is in safe hands.’Dated 14 November 1942, the attached booklet also appeared to have beenprivately circulated by Krafft’s friends. In particular, the supposedFührerastrologe had drawn attention to the leader’s own doctor, Karl Brandt,whom he accused of undermining the Nazi regime by prescribing medicine that waskilling the Führer. This doctor, it was suggested, was nothing less than adangerous quack who, for good measure, was also accused of being a reincarnationof Rasputin. In reality, British Intelligence had fingered the wrong doctor.Adolf Hitler’s personal physician, Dr Morrell, was already prescribing fairlydangerous drugs for his patient.The Nostradamus booklet opened with an unsigned essay entitled ‘Can humans seeinto the future?’ along with a radical new interpretation of the great seer’spredictions. These subtly altered quatrains were the obvious work of Louis deWohl, who provided helpful ‘notes’ to what the various Nostradamianprognostications actually meant. For example:A captain of Greater Germany will approach the king of kings, who justlymistrusts him with a feigned appeal for help.Its meaning, according to the appended notes, could not be clearer. Itcontinued:[F]oreign astrologers linked this quatrain to the case of Rudolf Hess, whosupposedly flew to England to offer the King an alliance against Russia.Other hints and helps are followed before a rousing finale:‘Jupiter in cancer – the great pocket will weep to have elected him. Hister’sruin approaches. From the heavens approaches an army so fearsome that Augsburg,Frankfurt and Berlin grow pale.’‘The great pocket’ alluded to heavy industry. The rest showed that the ThirdReich’s days were clearly numbered as destruction would continue until the veryend.But without his ever predicting it, so too were Louis de Wohl’s days working asan astrologer for British Intelligence. The records show that he was paid £70for this booklet – three months’ salary for an army captain, his MI5 files noted– and that was the final money he ever received from the British government."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEREMEMBRANCE FORETOLD [contents.htm#a16]Like nearly all my professional colleagues, I too was severely persecuted from1933 to 1945. I suffered the same fate as the other German astrologers; I wasarrested and taken to the infamous police prison in Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel. [When]I was released from prison, I was anything but a free man. On the contrary, Icontinued to live as a prisoner on an estate belonging to Himmler’s masseur,Kersten, an estate which served as a secret work camp for specialists and, assuch, was affiliated with the Ravensbrück concentration camp. I was no longerphysically maltreated, but I worked under the constant threat of severepunishment should my calculations prove inaccurate.Wilhelm Wulff, Zodiac and Swastika (1968)By the late winter of 1942, an air of cautious optimism hung over the capital.London was still bearing the tell-tale scars of war, yet it had survived. Thethreat of the Blitz had evaporated. With the Führer’s gaze increasinglypreoccupied by the war in the East, raids were few and far between. By thisfourth autumn of the fighting, there was some flickering hope that with the lastgreat imperial battle of the war – the victory at El Alamein – the tide ofAllied fortunes was on the turn.And now, a very special meeting had been called in Mr Rance’s room.Some of the attendees had flown halfway around the world. Foremost among themwas Peter Fleming, with the tanned countenance of someone who had been workingin India doing what he termed ‘this ungentlemanly stuff far from the heat anddust’. After his various earlier jobs for the Special Operations Executive, hewas now in charge of creating deceptions in the Far East. From the outset, itsscope was limited and, as he would shortly explain to Dennis Wheatley, it was ‘aone-horse show and I am the horse’.Though, as the official history of deceptions is at pains to point out, Fleming‘neither achieved nor could have achieved the imposing results which [he] scoredagainst our German enemies’, he did have his successes. Many read like Boy’s Ownadventures. Peter Fleming developed his own agents and double agents – known asHiccoughs or Cough Drops – along with dead bodies dropped with apparently faultyparachutes, triple agents who spent their time broadcasting insults, completelyfalse officers drawn by an imaginative cartoonist and a real-life double agentwho killed an informant by chopping tiger whiskers into a curry.Back in England, it was time to take stock.After taking extended leave in the company of his actress wife, Celia Johnson,Fleming had spent most of this time shooting pheasants, pondering the now globalneeds of warfare, which had their own special needs, not least in corroboratingevidence implicit in other operations around the world. Now it was time to bringit all together into a coherent whole to create an ultimately false picture ofAllied intentions all around the globe. False rumours had to be backed up with amodicum of truth and, as Peter Fleming would later remark, ‘It is impossible, orat least highly dangerous, to tell a lie until you know what the truth is goingto be.’images [images/icon.jpg]This, then, was a unique gathering of the clans, the only time these curious,secretive and sometimes mystical men ever came together in one location. At theend of October 1942, there was a sense they could achieve so much more.‘The presentations for the conference were immense,’ Dennis Wheatley recalled.‘For days, all of us sweated blood getting out a vast agenda, writing longpapers on the innumerable ways we might hope to deceive the enemy, upon gradesof operators and spheres of influence and arranging accommodation for ourvisitors.’Yet on the morning of the first day there was a notable absentee: the thrillerwriter himself. The meeting had started at ten o’clock sharp but Wheatley didn’tshow until 11.45 a.m. after sleeping through his alarm. He arrived by taxi andbounded into the large conference room as though nothing was wrong.‘I’m terribly sorry I’m late,’ he said in a stage whisper to Johnny Bevan. ‘Ioverslept.’Everyone fell about laughing. Wheatley’s faux pas was a comic counterpoint tothe seriousness of the discussion in hand. It was nothing if not propitious.October 1942 saw – in Winston Churchill’s apposite phrase – the turning of thetide, when finally everything came together. It was a time of new beginnings,too, and an end to the confusion that had often stymied the deceivers’ works todate. That is why the gathering of the clans was so important; it marked thechange from failure to success.Without realising it, everything was now set for the final battles of the war.In Johnny Bevan’s apt phrase, good deception came from double agents,codebreaking and good planning. All allowed them to become the most artfuldodgers in military history, highly adept at playing on the prejudices andcurious beliefs of the German High Command. Johnny Bevan had so manyresponsibilities that his hair literally turned grey overnight, his sleep wasdisrupted into painfully recurring episodes of insomnia and he was often madephysically sick with worry.The London Controlling Section would eventually come to have a power and remitfar beyond most others in the secret war. Dennis Wheatley essentially wrote thehandbook which codified all the steps needed to deceive the enemy. It became astrategic masterplan for the expert deceivers. The occult writer also provided adancing faun, a statuette that represented the trickery of the sprites, that wasplaced in the centre of the room along with a Persian carpet.It seemed a suitable augury for the future and one that did not need any helpfrom the occult anywhere around the world.images [images/icon.jpg]By the time the tide of war had changed, Louis de Wohl’s exit from the secretwar was only a matter of time. In all the surviving files on his dealings withthe secret world, the issue that continued to exercise both him – and theauthorities – was the small matter of his uniform, which he still felt entitledto wear. ‘None of this situation is understood by de Wohl himself,’ wroteColonel Lennox after he was off the payroll. ‘Indeed, why should it be? In sofar as he was given a commission and was never informed that it was only for oneparticular purpose, and would thereafter come to an end.’The problem was that he was starting to draw attention to himself:Since de Wohl’s return from America he has quite naturally had no ration card,for the simple reason that the Army has not issued him with one (why shouldit?), but he thinks he is a soldier and therefore cannot apply for a civiliancard. He has repeatedly asked Sefton Delmer if the authorities will let him havehis military card.The matter came to a head because the management of Athenaeum Court werethreatening to take legal action unless he handed over his ration coupons. Thegreat fear for the security authorities was that if he ever did go to court,‘one could hardly blame him for telling all this to an astonished Magistrate andgaping reporters’.An exasperated correspondent noted that if SOE could hand out commissions ‘toall and sundry’, surely somebody could find him a ration card. Equally, if hiswork for the PWE was worthwhile – ‘and only Sefton Delmer can answer that’ –they should make a card available to him. MI5 realised they needed to keep asclose a surveillance over him as possible. That now involved monitoring his mailand applying for a Home Office Warrant. That way, they could keep tabs on whathe was up to.‘He has a considerable clientele as an astrologer, and in view of the influencewhich he may well wield, by this means it is desirable to learn more of hiscontacts and activities.’Indefatigable to the last, de Wohl continued to issue reports on how the warwould play out. Hitler’s astrologers, he claimed, would not be able to predictvictory for the Third Reich. ‘This is the first year of the war in which reallystrong aspects are shown in the charts of King George VI and of Churchill, and afew really bad ones are in Hitler’s chart.’ But intriguingly, at the end of1942, he had picked up the rumour that units of the Kriegsmarine were carrying‘devices of an astrological nature’ which revealed that there was one last gaspfor astrology in Nazi Germany.images [images/icon.jpg]Mysterious, brooding and certainly paranoid, Adolf Hitler was no slouch when itcame to plots and deceptions. ‘He was,’ as one historian has rightly remarked,‘extraordinarily quick to spot a trick.’ Despite their false start, the artfuldodgers of Storey’s Gate would become highly adept at playing on the prejudicesand curious beliefs of the German High Command. Though Hitler considered himselfa strategist beyond compare, he would ultimately be defeated by tricks as old aswar itself which left him ‘puzzled as well as beaten’.Just one example – for which Dennis Wheatley was inordinately proud – was when,at the start of 1944, the British military mission in Stockholm was spottedmeasuring the heights and widths of tunnels along the main rail routes to Oslo,they took care to let press photographers know about it. This was quicklyfollowed by reports that Allied military engineers were making enquiries aboutload capacities of rolling stock and that British air personnel were inspectingStockholm runways. There were also many rumours within the diplomatic communitythat the Allies were negotiating for transit rights to Swedish islands whichfaced the German Baltic. And when the press reported that the Swedish populaceshould start digging air-raid shelters and stock up on emergency supplies, itwas clear that something was afoot.Was Sweden about to ditch its neutrality?Stockholm, like Lisbon before it, would now become the focus of a number ofmurky episodes in the secret war, which, in another historian’s estimation,involved ‘secret negotiations, trade concessions, economic pressure andfinancial skulduggery’. All formed part of a wave of deliberate provocation anddeception that were part of a wider Allied effort to make it appear as thoughthe Swedish government was about to enter the war on the Allied side. Knownformally as Operation Graffham, its purpose was ‘to induce the enemy to believethat we are enlisting the active co-operation of Sweden in connection withBritish and Russian contemplated operations against northern Norway in thespring of this year’.It was also suggested that after a dash for the Swedish ore fields, the Allieswould invade Norway as a precursor to the main landing. This deliberatelyplanted notion formed part of the greater deception operation known as FortitudeNorth, which jacketed the real intentions surrounding D-Day in what Churchillonce famously termed ‘a bodyguard of lies’. It worked by playing on one of theFührer’s pet fears that an invasion of Scandinavia was imminent.‘I’ve always told you those pig-headed British would go back to Norway,’ AdolfHitler screamed after falling for one such deception. ‘Reinforce it with twodivisions at once.’ The result was that the Führer continued to pour more money,men and weapons into Norway than he ever would do in Normandy. Nearly 500,000troops remained on station there, along with 90,000 naval and 60,000 Luftwaffepersonnel. They were thus not available to repel the Allied assault forces whenthey came ashore on Normandy’s beaches and were not able to alter the course ofhistory in Adolf Hitler’s favour.images [images/icon.jpg]In the meantime, Tom Delmer prospered, not least with another equallyinfluential ‘black’ radio station, Soldatensender Calais (Calais Armed ForcesRadio Station) supposedly broadcasting at the most likely landing point for anAllied invasion. In reality, the station’s aim was to subvert the morale oftroops all along the French coast, including those who were defending theNormandy coast where the invasion would come. ‘Units which show themselves smartand efficient are drafted to the Eastern Front,’ the station repeatedly claimedin an effort to generate slacking. ‘Promotion in France is a sure way to deathin Russia.’These and other strange but true broadcasts became part of Tom Delmer’s endlessfund of war stories. One colleague felt that the journalist ‘had a very amusingwar, but is very doubtful whether his efforts were anything like as successfulas Tom claims’. But even his difficult boss, Dick Crossman, with whom he oftenwas at daggers drawn, admitted that his underling’s approach was successful forthe very good reason that ‘black propaganda seems to have an irresistibleattraction for those in authority’.Agnes Bernelle went on to become a cabaret singer of some note.Perhaps the greater irony is that when she later applied to the BBC OverseasService to work as a broadcaster, she was rejected. By then Agnes had marriedDesmond Leslie, and lived a bohemian – and at times trying – life in London formost of the fifties. In time, they moved to Dublin, divorced and Agnesestablished herself on the arts scene in the Irish capital. She died in 1999,after which one obituary noted that nobody could fail ‘to be impressed by hercourage, energy and dedication, qualities which she showed all her life’.images [images/icon.jpg]Atlantik Sender also represented the highwater mark of Ian Fleming’s career as apropagandist. At the start of 1943, Uncle John, as Fleming usually referred toAdmiral Godfrey when he wasn’t around, had been dismissed without warning ashead of the Naval Intelligence Division. Considered opinion was that theDirector of Naval Intelligence had stirred up ‘a pretty angry hornets’ nest’thanks to his impatience and general tactlessness. When he was absent, it wasnoted that the deliberations of the Joint Intelligence Committee seemed to passalong more smoothly than when he was present.Never one of the prime minister’s favourites, Admiral Godfrey was dispatched –dismissed in some accounts because of his acerbic nature – to become FlagOfficer of the Royal Indian Navy, where it was his misfortune to preside over amutiny during which he went on the air with an order to ‘Submit or perish’.Uncle John’s ‘special assistant’ had been at something of a loss since thedeparture of his best advocate and mentor. Subsequently, he devoted hisattentions to what became known as his Red Indians (a phrase that, curiously,resonates in many of the Bond novels when 007 sometime obliquely referred to hisown wartime secret service). Inspired by German intelligence commandos, Flemingbecame senior commander for a detachment of personnel who accompanied troops onraids to obtain ciphers, weapons and useful information. Fleming helped in themeticulous planning for what was better known as an Intelligence Assault Force.What was also formally known as 30 Assault Unit operated under the directauthority of the Director of Naval Intelligence. Fleming’s Red Indians, as theywere better known, would move in with or immediately behind front line troops tosecure as many secret documents as possible from naval – and, in time, othermilitary – institutions. Its ranks swelled from the toughest of recruits who hadshown that they could survive a choice selection of run marches and assaultcourses, as well as parachute and glider training, safe cracking and explosivestraining.It was clear that James Bond would have passed those tests.Commander Ian Fleming, however, remained resolutely based at the admiralty andagain, despite specious claims, he was never at the forefront of the Red Indiansin the field. So Ian Fleming had to settle for more vicarious participation inthe secret war. During the final stages of the war, he watched with an almostpaternal pride as his subordinates went in with the first troops to return toEurope.Commander Fleming was still invaluable as his new boss’s fixer, but as his mostrecent biographer has noted, ‘Room 39 was no longer the buzzing ideas factory ithad once been.’ There he began to daydream, doodling designs for a holiday homein the sun and squirreling notes for what he called the spy story to end all spystories. Both would be combined in Jamaica, which he would shortly visit toinvestigate strange rumours about Hermann Goering’s Swedish brother-in-law andsuspected U-boat activity.Within a matter of weeks, Ian Fleming had bought a property on the old donkeyracetrack at Oracabessa on the north coast of the island. Fleming christened itGoldeneye after the sabotage network which he had planned in the event of aGerman invasion of Iberia. As for the spy story to end all spy stories, IanFleming’s wartime escapades would provide an endless well of inspiration and,seven years later, on the eve of his marriage, he sat down at his desk andstarted a story about a British spy set in a casino. It was called Casino Royaleand some said he had a great future as a thriller writer.images [images/icon.jpg]Despite the crackdown on astrology after Hess’s defection, there were stillreportedly outbreaks of mysticism throughout the Third Reich. One astrologer,Wilhelm Wulff, who had been incarcerated in Fuhlsbüttel Prison after the AktionHess in the early spring of 1941, had been released to work in a naval institutefor the strangest of reasons. Even after officially locking up most occulticpractitioners, Nazi officials continued to employ mystics to help in the searchfor Allied submarines. In this, they used pendulums instead of dowsing rods.By studying the way in which a pendulum swung, concealed objects such as hiddentreasure or missing people, it was said, could be found. The Germans often didthis over a map (which was how the Munich physician predicted the presence ofJews). The astrologer’s own expertise extended to a particular Indian pendulumknown as Tattua. ‘Day in, day out, the pendulum practitioners squatted withtheir arms stretched out over nautical charts,’ Wulff would write. ‘The resultswere, of course, pitiful.’After Benito Mussolini was deposed in September 1943 – which, oddly, Louis deWohl had predicted (‘This seems an absolutely crucial month for Italy withstrong bad aspects for the King of Italy, the Crown Prince and Mussolini’) –another group of German astrologers were locked into a house in Wannsee by theSS to see if they could predict where Il Duce was located. As late as July 1944,a secret report circulated by the SD (the SS intelligence service) noted thatthere had been ‘a considerable increase in all possible forms of prophecy aboutthe future course of the war’.Clairvoyancy, astrology and numerology were mentioned.And there now came the unexpected rise of Wilhelm Wulff.‘All intellectual, natural and supernatural sources of power – from moderntechnology to medieval black magic and from the teachings of Pythagoras to theFaustian pentagram incantation – were to be exploited in the interests of finalvictory,’ Wulff would write in the late sixties.When he was later introduced to the Reichsführer-SS, he was described as aprofessor of Sanskrit and, strangely, a student of poisons. Rather than helpingHeinrich Himmler devise new ways of killing, the introduction had been effectedso that the self-styled mystic could advise him on Indian matters and theirimportance in the curious genesis of the Nazi mythology.Wulff’s elevation to the inner sanctum had been dictated not by the stars butfor reasons of political expediency: as an astrologer, it was hoped he would bein a position to influence Himmler to assassinate Hitler. The Reichsführer-SS,who in one historian’s assessment ‘seldom took any steps without firstconsulting his horoscope’, was keen to learn about Wulff’s work.The astrologer first met Himmler in the late spring of 1944 in the horriblyappropriate surroundings of a gothic castle in the Alpine mountains surroundingSalzburg. Now, in the final months of the ‘thousand year Reich’, Wulff wouldcome to play a strange and surreal role in the machinations of peace feelers,which were tentatively being extended towards the Allies in the Swedish capital,a city that was ‘a flypaper for peace feelers’.images [images/icon.jpg]By now, it was all over for the occult on the Allied side of the fighting.At the end of 1943, MI6 learned that Louis de Wohl had played his ‘usual line ofmystery man’ when approaching a fellow Hungarian and claimed he was anaristocrat. ‘When addressed in Hungarian it was, of course, found that he couldneither speak nor understand it.’The reading of his mail revealed that he had also been in contact with othercosmopolitan émigrés of whom the authorities were highly suspicious, though theywere, ultimately, pretty harmless. But in June 1943, they discovered somethingmore worrying. He had been in contact with a member of the White Hawk Circle – agroup of spiritualists who met at 72 Queen’s Gate – and one member becamesuspicious. He informed MI5 at the end of May that de Wohl was ‘an indiscreettalker and a bumptious seeker after notoriety’.Though posing ‘as a professional astrologer’, it seemed that the informantlearned de Wohl ‘from time to time gives out he is working for the secretservice’. Even more worrying, this unnamed informant feared something else: ‘Ifnot actually the same “family” as the dark man he might definitely becomerelated to him and his business.’Though not immediately obvious, the ‘dark man’ was Aleister Crowley.‘My firm think he may be very slightly mental,’ the White Hawk Circlespiritualist noted, ‘but the slightly abnormal are just the dark man’s cup oftea.’This is one of the few references to the Great Beast in all the haul of MI5files which have been released in recent years. By now, in 1943, Crowley hadsuffered a bout of pneumonia in Torquay, recovered and, according to hisdiaries, on 17 and 18 June, went to visit an old friend. He entered EvanMorgan’s ‘magick room’ and says very little else about what they did. Early thefollowing year, Crowley moved back to London. By then, at the start of 1944, itdidn’t need an astrologer to see which way the war was headed. But strangely, acouple of seers were involved in fairly brisk traffic involving secretnegotiations within Nazi Germany concerning the very conduct of the war andbringing it to a swift conclusion.images [images/icon.jpg]At the start of 1944 came an event which sent shockwaves through the secretworld and beyond, when Erich Vermehren, who was the Abwehr resident in Istanbul(a scion of a Lubeck family who had twice been awarded a Rhodes scholarship toOxford), defected with his wife. Within hours, the news was deliberately leakedvia the Associated Press that they ‘were disgusted with Nazi brutality’. ‘He issaid to possess detailed information of the greatest value.’It was certainly the final straw for the Führer so far as the Abwehr wasconcerned. When Admiral Wilhelm Canaris went to visit Hitler later that sameweek, he flew into a rage when the head of intelligence said that he was ‘onlytransmitting the reports of my agents’.‘Your agents?’ The Führer screamed. ‘Are they as trustworthy as the Vermehrens?’Hitler was so incensed that in some accounts he actually knocked over a table.Within days, the admiral was removed, effectively pensioned off while most ofhis underlings were dismissed and the Abwehr itself was merged with the SSSicherheitsdienst. With Admiral Canaris’s dismissal, Walter Schellenberg nowtook the prime position as head of the Nazi intelligence apparatus.Schellenberg, in a contemporary conversation, said that eight of the best Germanagents had defected as they were not gentlemen.‘He proposed to train men of good repute to act as agents and announced that hewould endeavour to place espionage on a higher social footing.’As with most activities in Nazi Germany, the amalgamation of the Abwehr and theSicherheitsdienst was messy and protracted. But it meant that Heinrich Himmlerhad got what he always wanted with his favourite, most trusted associate fromthe intelligence world in charge. Indeed, Walter Schellenberg now had a greatergame to play in the closing year of the war: stopping the madness before it gotany worse. A whole new strand of treachery would now intensify as Schellenberghimself would work to overthrow Hitler and negotiate a peace with the WesternAllies. And with this would come a last gasp for mysticism and the strange roleof a man who claimed he was a faith healer but soon came to be much morebesides.images [images/icon.jpg]Once a month, Dr Felix Kersten – memorably described as a ‘great giant of manwho posed as a harmless masseur from Finland’ – travelled to Berlin from hisStockholm practice. His healing hands had come to the attention of senior Nazisbefore the war. The masseur himself had concluded that ‘most high-ranking Naziofficials were unstable, neurotic men, not only evil of intent but quite unfitfor the duties demanded of them’, as he would later write.Intriguingly, Kersten had treated Rudolf Hess in the early years of the war andthe Deputy Führer had allegedly told his masseur that he would ‘make history’ afew days before his departure to Great Britain. Such rumours had brought FelixKersten to the unwanted attention of the Gestapo. Ironically, he would beprotected by the head of the SS himself thanks to his supposed powers; Kersten’shealing hands were used in the relief of Heinrich Himmler’s chronic intestinalpain.In time, the masseur became so well regarded that the Reichsführer-SS referredto him as ‘my only friend, my Buddha’. Given this unusual position of trust,Kersten was able to discuss many matters with Himmler, such as the fate of theJews, which were beyond the scope of most conversations.Significantly, in the first years of the war he had also treated WalterSchellenberg, whose own health problems intensified and which he had blamed onthe British trying to poison him. As a result, the good doctor now became partyto the plots against the Führer and, increasingly, plans to depose him by bothSchellenberg and Himmler. The various plottings of Brigadeführer-SS WalterSchellenberg thus came to fruition with the most cosmic of influences.images [images/icon.jpg]When Wilhelm Wulff was introduced to Felix Kersten by a mutual friend in thewinter of 1942, the Finnish masseur did not strike him as a particularly benigninfluence. ‘Greedy little eyes, which were reminiscent of a child’s, peered fromKersten’s bloated face,’ Wulff recalled. His description of the masseur makeshim sound like yet another prototypical Bond villain, for he was ‘extremelypassionate and sensuous, extremely lazy, extremely vain and ambitious’.After his incarceration in a concentration camp, Wulff was understandablycircumspect at this first meeting. By now, he was a dedicated anti-Nazi. YetKersten insisted that the astrologer could talk openly and proceeded to ask himabout Hitler’s horoscope. It seemed that the Führer had ‘the same Saturnpositions in his natal chart as Napoleon’, in Wulff’s recollection. Kerstenwanted him to show this chart to Himmler, which would obviously help subvert theNazi cause.The astrologer was understandably terrified.‘You must meet Himmler,’ the masseur said in an attempt to calm him down.‘You’ll like him. He is a nice man and can do a great deal for you if you wanthim to.’Wulff had little desire to meet the Reichsführer-SS, but having now come intothe orbit of Felix Kersten, perhaps it was inevitable that he would beintroduced to the rather more subtle Schellenberg. On an ice-cold day at thestart of 1944, the astrologer was introduced to Himmler’s éminence grise in avilla on the outskirts of Hamburg. Ironically, he was handed a copy of SeftonDelmer’s Zenit, which Wulff found extraordinarily good.When he said that the Führer’s prospects weren’t quite so good, ‘He willprobably die under the hand of an assassin, certainly in “Neptunian” – that is,enigmatic – circumstances, in which a woman will play a leading part’,Schellenberg was intrigued. Wulff’s subsequent meeting with Himmler took placeat the Reichsführer’s Bergwald Castle in the shadows of the Alps sometimetowards the end of May 1944.His first impressions, once more, were not particularly good.Heinrich Himmler came across as a political calculating machine, ‘a robot withhorn-rimmed glasses and a metal heart full of magical spells which had been putthere by some evil genius’. After a lunch with some local bigwigs and apretentious discussion about ancient India, they retired to a private room todiscuss Wulff’s horoscopes. Kersten had already taken care to pass some of themon to Himmler. Here was proof, the astrologer said, that the timing was ripe forprecipitate action. The Reichsführer-SS should take note of these predictionsand ‘consider it necessary to overthrow Hitler and enter into peacenegotiations’.Without spelling it out in either of their memoirs, Schellenberg had put theastrologer up to it. Curiously, like Louis de Wohl on the other side of theChannel, Wulff maintained that he never doctored his charts for base politicalmotives nor the needs of expediency. Though Himmler reportedly said that ‘theabuses amongst astrologers are very great’, it was obvious that Wulff’s freedomwould very much depend on following Schellenberg and Kersten’s instructions, nomatter what the stars foretold.Schellenberg, it seemed, was interested in ‘special astrological calculationsconcerning the military situation’.Like de Wohl’s later recollections, it should be noted that Wulff’s memoirs areself-serving and ridiculously exaggerated with his uncanny ability to recallwhole screeds verbatim twenty years after they had taken place. After afive-hour talk with Himmler – lovingly recalled in detail in his 1968 memoir –Wulff predicted that Hitler’s military ventures would come to nought.‘Hitler will not be assassinated,’ he added. ‘There may well be an assassinationattempt, but it will not cost him his life.’They talked more – of whether Russia would prevail, what might happen to theGerman people – before Himmler stared at him with more than a hint of menace.The Reichsführer-SS pointedly remarked that what they were ‘discussing is hightreason and would cost us our lives if Hitler were to find out about our plans’.That same evening, Wulff was chauffeured back to Berlin where the silkyintelligence chief obviously ‘wanted to use me as a means of influencing him[Himmler]’. Indeed, Schellenberg wanted to use Wulff’s horoscopes to prompt theassassination of Adolf Hitler. Himmler himself seems to have been party to this,for he later asked Schellenberg about some predictions ‘and in particular thequestion of concluding peace with the Allies and liquidating Hitler’.images [images/icon.jpg]As history shows, Hitler was nearly liquidated by his own people in 1944.Wilhelm Wulff continued to provide Schellenberg with his own special insightsthat were ordained from the heavenly firmament and, in predicting greater dangerfor Schellenberg personally on or about 20 July, he wasn’t far wrong. Followingthe July Bomb Plot, there followed an unleashing of fury that nobody couldpredict, not least when, in the dying days of the war, indiscriminate revengewas taken against anyone who had sided against the Führer – and that includedastrologers.Perhaps the most savage irony was that Karl Krafft died of typhoid on the eve ofbeing sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. Just about the only one allowedfreedom was Wilhelm Wulf – who predicted a mysterious death not long before 7May 1945, referring to the demise of Adolf Hitler. But nobody expected somebodywho had been arrested in the wake of the July Bomb Plot would also be sacrificedat Flossenbürg concentration camp.Even at this stage, there were some who thought Admiral Canaris might yetsurvive. In the spring of 1945, even under arrest, the old fox was running ringsaround his interrogators, denying accusations, destroying credibilities anddismissing the claims of other plotters as fantasies. His rhetorical skills wereundiminished; his evasions masterly.But then in early April, fate intervened.‘It now emerges from confiscated material found in an Abwehr safe that planswere already afoot in earlier years to effect a change of government by militarymeans,’ said a note that was passed to Martin Bormann by the Gestapo.Throughout his time in Flossenbürg, Canaris had been tapping out morse messagesto the prisoner in the next cell. On the evening of 8 April, came a valedictorycommunication. ‘Nose broken at last interrogation. My time is up. Was not atraitor. Did my duty as a German. If you survive remember me to my wife.’At 5.30 a.m. the next day, guards came for Admiral Canaris.‘Move! Out!’ they cried and pushed Wilhelm Canaris into the corridor. Strippednaked, he was hanged by a noose and, along with many other Abwehr conspirators,thrown into a hastily dug hole in the ground. On that fateful Monday, the USArmy was just 50 miles away and the camp would be liberated just a fortnightlater on 23 April, three days after Adolf Hitler committed suicide.‘Canaris accordingly remained, until the day of his senseless death, what he hadalways been,’ writes his incomparable biographer Heinz Höhne, ‘an imperial cadetand a champion of German claims to international dominance which became steadilyless compatible with the realities of the twentieth century.’images [images/icon.jpg]Ultimately, the peace feelers came to nought. Walter Schellenberg claimed thathe had been trying to save Germany from a yawning abyss since 1940. He wrote:It was a long and tiring road that I had to travel, a road presumablypre-destined, and in the end without result. It was not lack of will andindustry, but stupidity, vanity and brutality on the one hand (my enemies insidethe RSHA) and the indecision of the Reichsführer-SS himself, on the other, whichruined all these plans.Schellenberg gave himself up in Denmark and was interrogated by all the variousAllied intelligence agencies. ‘Actually, all he wanted was to save his ownskin,’ one MI5 official would write. ‘In office, he would be a vile enemy; incaptivity, he was a cringing cad. In office, he would ruthlessly cut down hisopponents; in captivity, he would as ruthlessly betray his friends.’Amongst his belongings was a volume of Kipling’s poetry, including If, with itsfateful lines:If you can keep your head when all about youAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,If you can trust yourself when all men doubt youBut make allowance for their doubting too;‘Have the first four lines ever been in more bitter quotation?’ wrote the MI5interrogator who discovered the book. Schellenberg was tried at Nuremberg andsentenced to six years’ imprisonment but was released early on the grounds ofill-health and died in March 1952, all his last-minute efforts to save his skinhaving come to naught.images [images/icon.jpg]That same year, Louis de Wohl had produced his memoirs which he had been talkingabout for years. In one of his last communications with his most wayward charge,Colonel Gilbert Lennox had had the dubious pleasure of reading drafts and, as henoted for the files, could not ‘safely dismiss the book as merely drivelunlikely to come to any wider notice’. The security services feared that thepublic would get the impression that many important actions were influenced by‘the mumbo jumbo of astrology’ but felt the best approach was to let him publishand be damned.The latter certainly happened to Stars of War and Peace. When Louis de Wohl’sautobiography came out in 1952, one official noted that his memories did notexactly coincide with the realities of the historical record. In the fifties,Louis de Wohl prospered as a film writer in Hollywood, but by the early sixtieshad settled in Lucerne, where he pursued writing about Catholic saints and diedin the summer of 1961.Just over a year before, he had visited London and made what may seem like anodd confession. ‘I still believe cosmic forces can influence people,’ he told areporter, ‘but I believe forecasting can do far more harm than good. I’m glad Ihelped to stop Hitler but now I realise how very fallible astrology is.’In this analysis, at least and at last, he wasn’t alone."},{"pageContent":"NOTES ON SOURCES [contents.htm#a17]INTRODUCTIONOpinion seems to be divided as to whether Ian Fleming and Aleister Crowleyactually met. The letter quoted at the start may be found in the NavalIntelligence files and the original has been located in the Crowley files at theWarburg Institute, London. The bizarre dialogue comes from p. 4 of The Riddlesby Amado Crowley, whose real name was Andrew Standish and, as discussed inChapter 10, was most likely not Aleister’s son. This and stranger episodes aboutthe Beast are related in Amado Crowley’s three books, the middle one of which isquoted from here. The reference to Crowley’s eyes comes from p. 77 of CasinoRoyale: ‘the period of horoscopes, crystal gazing and guesswork’ is from p. 11,Cradock.CHAPTER 1 – 007 AND COUNTINGFrancis Walsingham’s story is related in biographies by both Stephen Budianskyand Robert Hutchinson. Dr Dee’s story has been told by many others, not least bythe academics Deborah Harkness and Stephen Clucas. At various times in the lastdecade, I have had occasion to speak to both of them and other scholarsinterested in the good Dr Dee, a figure of great curiosity and mystery. Thequote about Thomas Connery (later Sean) comes from p. 102 of British Greats(Cassell, 2000), in an essay by Joseph Connolly about James Bond. The notion of007 relying ‘on individual pluck and initiative’ from is p. 47, Winder.Material about Kim is taken from the standard reference by Peter Hopkirk and thebackground about the Boer War from David Stafford’s Churchill and SecretService, a superb book about the future prime minister’s interest in thesubject.Background on the kaiser is from Zara Steiner’s Britain and the Origins of TheFirst World War (Palgrave, 2003); Le Queux is covered in Alan Judd’s biographyof the first C and his quote is from the Sunday Telegraph, 25 August 2012;‘romantic nonsense’, p. 47, Knightley; William Stevenson ‘spyglass’ quote fromobituaries in the Daily Telegraph, 3 March 2014 and also The New York Times, 1December 2013. The quote ‘diplomats and intelligence agents’ from p. 149,Muggeridge.Details on the early life of Mansfield Cumming are from his biographer AlanJudd, the authorised MI6 history by Jeffery; the ‘valuable’ quote about Cumming,from p. 31, West, MI6; and ‘amateur improvisation’ (TNA WO 106/45/525). Anexcellent guide to these earliest years of intelligence is David French’s ‘SpyFever In Britain, 1900–1915’ in The Historical Journal, Vol. 21, Issue 02, June1978, pp. 355–70.Nigel West has examined how myth and literature have intertwined in ‘Fiction,Faction and Intelligence’, Intelligence and National Security, Vol. 19, No. 2,Summer 2004, pp. 275–89. Less accurate but quite readable and entertaining isLiterary Agents by Anthony Masters. For Graham Greene’s background – and how hisliterature fits into the genre – see also Dennis Smyth, ‘Our Man In Havana,Their Man in Madrid: Literary invention in espionage, fact and fiction’,Intelligence and National Security, 1990, 5:4 pp. 117–35.Literature in the field of magic, astrology and the occult contains, alas, agreat deal of twaddle. One person whose writings are assuredly not and standhead and shoulders above others are those of the late Professor NicholasGoodrick-Clarke of Exeter University, whose The Occult Roots of Nazism: SecretAryan Cults And Their Influence on Nazi Ideology (IB Tauris, 1992) is a standardreference. His more recent work Black Sun, Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and thePolitics of Identity, particularly Chapter 6, ‘The Nazi Mysteries’, is anincomparably excellent source. Another paper which provides context is ReginaldPhillips’s ‘Before Hitler Came: Thule Society and Germanen Orden’, Journal ofModern History, No. 35, (1968).The reality of Hitler’s rise to power is taken from p. 109, Black Sun, anddetails on Trevor Ravenscroft and Walter Stein are covered in the same Chapter6, ‘The Nazi Mysteries’, pp. 118–20 of Black Sun. Stein’s activities in Belgiumare covered in TNA KV 6/47; information about James Herbert is taken from hisobituaries in the Sydney Morning Herald, 21 March 2013, and Daily Telegraph, 20March 2013. For the general rise of mysticism see also the Blavatsky biographyby Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, the history of the Golden Dawn by Ellic Howe andStealing from Heaven: The Rise of Modern Western Magic by Neil Drury, (OUP,2011).For the record, many of the wilder speculations may be found in TrevorRavenscroft’s The Spear of Destiny, Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier’s TheMorning of the Magicians as well as Dusty Sklar’s The Nazis and the Occult. Seealso, Peter Levenda’s Unholy Alliance; A History of Nazi Involvement with theOccult as well as Flowers and Moynihan, The Secret King: The Myth and Reality ofNazi Occultism.The standard reference for the Nazi ‘take’ on astrology is Ellic Howe’sAstrology And The Third Reich (Aquarian Press, 1984), an expanded version of hisUrania’s Children, an earlier look at the work. An amusing gallop through thewhole subject is The Fated Sky – Astrology In History by Bevan Bobrick (Simon &Schuster, 2006).The remarkable Mansfield Cumming has been examined by his biographer, Alan Judd,as well as the academic historians Gill Bennett and Keith Jeffery, in a superbbiography of Desmond Morton and authorised history of the Secret IntelligenceService respectively. The speech to English Heritage of Alex Younger, the latestchief, may be found on the SIS website. The various quotes on Cumming are takenfrom: ‘his manner of speaking’, p. 35, ST 25: Adventure & Romance in the SecretIntelligence Service in Russia by Paul Dukes (Cassell, 1938). The unfortunatelynamed Knoblock story is from ‘MI6 used body fluids as invisible ink’, 21September 2010, Daily Telegraph; the whereabouts of the £28,000 is discussed onp. 32, Knightley. Biographical details of Reginald Hall are taken from theOxford Dictionary of National Biography. The quote ‘an inner body’ appears inTNA ADM 223/479.Tobias Churton of Exeter University – like his colleague ProfessorGoodrick-Clarke – has written two standard references to Aleister Crowley, abiography in 2013 and a chronicle of his time in Weimar Berlin which appeared ayear later. General biographical information on Aleister Crowley is taken fromtwo earlier biographies, by Martin Booth and Roger Hutchinson. Furtherinformation is taken from his entry in the Dictionary of National Biography aswell as his own Confessions. A good starting point for studies of AleisterCrowley during the First World War is Professor Richard B. Spence’s ‘SecretAgent 666: Aleister Crowley and British Intelligence in America, 1914–1918’,International Journal of Intelligence & Counterintelligence, Vol. 13, No. 3(October 2000). There are traces of Crowley’s Great War work in TNA KV 1/25 onmicrofiche in Kew. Related files FO/2541, 371/145230 and 371/1216 have all beenredacted.While many see a certain fire of intelligence intrigue burning behind the story,I see more smoke. Professor Spence’s subsequent book, Secret Agent 666, is avery useful guide to the intelligence dimension to Crowley’s life. Background onBritish propaganda in the First World War are taken from Messinger and, to alesser extent, the classic text on psychological warfare by Linebarger,particularly p. 64; ‘so blatantly extravagant only a German’, p. 752, TheConfessions; Churton, pp. 187–88; Crowley, an employee of the Britishgovernment. Cross referencing of MID 9140-808, 19 September 1917; ‘thetraditional weapon’, PWE History, Garnett, p. 2.CHAPTER 2 – HIGHER AUTHORITIESFurther quotes here about the Nazi interest in the occult are taken from:‘faith, hope, hatred’, Burleigh, The Third Reich, p. 1; ‘surprisingly largenumber of Germans’, p. 84, Howe; ‘There is a divine will,’ Donarus, Hitler,Speeches and Proclamations; ‘The work that Christ started’, John Toland, Hitler(Doubleday, 1976), p. 222. Interesting details about spirituality in WeimarGermany come from Heather Wolffram, ‘Crime, Clairvoyance and The Weimar Police’,Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 44, No. 4 (October 2009), pp. 581–601.The authorised histories of MI5 and MI6 detail most of the convoluted history ofboth agencies between the wars, as does Gill Bennett in her biography of DesmondMorton. The quote ‘fellow conspirators’, p. 45, Orlow, History of the NaziParty.The strange character who was George Makgill is touched on briefly in Jeffrey,Andrew and Bennett, Chapter 4 of The Occult Octopus; see also The Sunday Times,17 October 2010, ‘Red Paranoia led MI6 to hire freelance spies’; Makgill’sbackground is taken from various contemporary stories in the (then Manchester)Guardian, 15 October 1915, ‘Londoners and Zeppelins’; 16 February 1916, ‘Mob lawand the friends’; court case on Hills vs. Makgill, see The Guardian and also hisobituary, The Times, 20 October 1926.The Zinoviev letter is discussed in Gill Bennett, A Most Extraordinary andMysterious Business: The Zinoviev Letter of 1924 (1999). Most of the quotes aretaken from The Guardian, 4 February 1999, the day after the press conferencewhere Ms Bennett revealed her findings.The convoluted history of the private intelligence groups – more fully discussedwith Max Knight’s involvement in the next chapter – are covered in John Hope’sexcellent paper ‘Surveillance or Collusion? Maxwell Knight, MI5 and the BritishFascisti’, Intelligence and National Security (1994), 9:4, pp. 651–75. MikeHughes, Spies At Work (1994, available online) examines much of the evidence,with a useful analysis of the interconnection between Makgill, Reggie Hall andothers.Details on Crowley’s time in Sicily are taken from Booth, Churton and Spence;‘in a period defined by’ from Raymond Mortimer, 18 November 1951, The SundayTimes.Bibliographical information about Quex Sinclair are from: ‘the little man’, Readand Fisher, p. 163; ‘that you really got lost in’, Jeffery, p. 226; ‘As theadmiral got up’, Winterbotham, The Nazi Connection, p. 70; ‘spent most of histime’, p. 141, Cave Brown, Churchill’s Spymaster. Freddie Winterbotham’s meetingwith Hitler is described in The Nazi Connection. Ropp details from MI6authorised history; ‘We all had a drink’, p. 153, The Ultra Secret.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke provides the most useful summary of the Nazi interestin the occult. On various leading Nazis’ odd views about the occult, see: ‘Theusual view of Himmler’, p. 51, Cohn, Warrant for Genocide (Eyre & Spottiswoode,1967); ‘redeemer sent by providence’, p. 157 of Hess, The Incorrigible Intruder(Stafford, editor); Hanussen’s meeting was in 1932, not 1926 as detailed inGordon, p. 217. The quote ‘we cannot allow astrologers’, p. 285, Bobrick, TheFated Sky; ‘sidereal pendulum’, p. 119, Black Sun.Wilhelm Canaris has been profiled many times. I have used many incidentaldetails from Brissaud, Höhne and Kahn. Richard Bassett’s biography from 2005 isa judicious assessment. Quotes as follows: ‘You can talk to the man’, Kahn,p.234; MI6 assessment is from TNA KV 3/820a quoting CX-4282 dated 25.8.37; ‘Theroom where Canaris worked’, p. 103, Brissaud. An excellent assessment ofReinhard Heydrich’s role comes from George Brouder, whose book on the Nazipolice state is exemplary. Wighton and Peis contains much useful information;Canaris’s assessment of Heydrich’s character from p. 143, Bassett; furtherinformation from p. 22, Brissaud; Constantin Canaris quote is from p. 17CSDIC/CMF/SD45 quoted in WO 204/1206.Profiles of Claude Dansey: ‘a nice man’, p. 516, from paper by E.D.R. Harrison,‘More Thoughts on Kim Philby’s My Silent War,’ Intelligence and NationalSecurity, 10:3 (1995), pp. 514–25, which discusses the situation within MI6 whenPhilby joined; ‘Alexander Got a Knighthood’ from The Sunday Times, 16 October1983; C’s men upsetting FCO may be found in TNA FO 371 passim; Colonel Vivian’sobit from The Times, 16 April 1969; ‘such a service as the SIS’, p. 190,Bennett; ‘clandestine sources,’ abridged Hinsley, p.10; ‘the background ofmany’, Johns, p. 15.Information on Stewart Menzies taken from his DNB entry, The Times obituary (6June 1968) and some details from Cave Brown, C – Churchill’s Spymaster. Thequotes are: ‘was exceedingly good-looking’, Cave Brown, p. 47; ‘Stewart was abeautiful athlete’, note added to obit from Benson: Robert Cecil assessment,‘C’s War’, from Intelligence and National Security, 1:2 (1986), pp. 170–88;Theodor story on p. 381 of MI6 by Jeffery; background in Harrison paper, MoreThoughts On Kim Philby (op cit); ‘C rarely left his desk’, p. 181, Cecil paper;‘he would not have held’, from Howarth, p. 115, Intelligence Chief Extraordinary(Bodley Head, 1986); and the story about the king, from p. 294, Robert Sherwood,Roosevelt & Hopkins (Harper Brothers, 1948).CHAPTER 3 – THE DEVIL IN THE DETAILSLouis de Wohl’s files were released into the National Archives in KV 2/2821 inearly 2008. As noted in Chapter Eight, because of the fire that destroyed muchof the MI5 wartime registry a great deal is missing concerning the whole processof recruitment and his first contacts with the Security Service in the mid tolate thirties. The astrologer’s own books contain a great deal of odd claimswhich cannot be substantiated. Dr Felix Jay, who was a friend of the Hungarian,wrote a charming, friendly reminiscence in ‘The Louis de Wohl I Knew’ in TheTraditional Astrologer magazine, March 1998, pp. 10–15.Background details from his various dealings with security officials may befound in KV2/2821 dated as follows plus other sources: ‘a charlatan and a fake’,8 April 1941; Mucsinyi Wohl Lajos, 10 July 1945; ‘he has lived’, 24 September1942; ‘De Wohl does not’, 8 April 1941; ‘he struggled to become an author’, Jay,p. 2; ‘he wrote in Germany’, 8 April 1941; ‘an extremely clever man’, 6 October1942; ‘his wife is’, 10 July 1945; ‘feminine attire’, 8 April 1941; ‘whichemploys 1,000 experts’, Los Angeles Times, 9 September 1941; ‘somewhat in ahurry’, 10 July 1945; ‘but I saw and heard stories’, New York Sunday News, 27July 1941.Background details on Karl Ernst Krafft are taken from pp. 130–40 of Howe,Astrology and the Third Reich; ‘There the SS cranks’, p. 183, Wighton, Heydrich:Hitler’s most evil henchman (Odhams, 1962).Max Knight’s career is covered in The Man Who Would Be M by the late AnthonyMasters and Joan Miller’s One Girl’s War. While both are vivid and colourful, asseveral people have pointed out the intelligence background in both is shaky. In1986, the British government tried to ban publication of her autobiography (seeThe Guardian, ‘Memoirs of a MI5 burglar’, 14 November, 1986) which, like so manysimilar accounts, is colourful, entertaining and contains a host of allegationswhose veracity cannot be checked. It seems to have informed the same tone ofMasters’s book.Max Knight’s obits were surprisingly perfunctory: see The Times, 27 January,1968.To set his work into perspective is Chapter 5, ‘God save the King and His AgentsProvocateurs’, of Gill Bennett’s biography of Desmond Morton. Both theauthorised MI5 and MI6 histories (particularly pp. 123–24 of Andrew) discuss thebackground to Knight’s work. As noted in the text, Knight’s own recollections ofhis work may be found in TNA KV 4/227 – Report on the work of MS (recruitmentand operation of agents) during the Second World War. Canaris and women – seeChapter 2, ‘Canaris, Traitor or Hero’, of Unreliable Witness, West, 1984.An interesting angle on the freelance activities of the private intelligenceagencies and Knight was in The Sunday Times, 17 October 2010; as noted above,the paper by John Hope and, though quoting more secondary sources, Mike Hughes’sSpies At Work, have much useful information. Quotes are as follows: ‘he used tocome round’, Sunday Express, 22 May 2011; ‘Maxwell Knight’s quite clearly’, Hopepaper, p. 653.Information on Esplanade Hotel from current owners and line about Polishgovernment from Agnes Bernelle, p. 67; Klubsessel from Felix Jay article; ‘Bothdialogue’ and review are in The Observer, 30 May 1937; ‘gained him respect inthe super’, from ‘Why Churchill had an astrologer’, article by ChristineHotchkiss, p. 11, Baltimore Sun, 1 November 1959, clearly based on materialwritten by Louis de Wohl; ‘There’s nothing supernatural or uncanny’, Los AngelesTimes, 9 September 1941.The death of Gwladys Knight was reported in newspapers in December 1936,particularly The Times of 18 December, ‘Open verdict at Inquest’; pp. 45–60,Chapter 3, of Masters; p. 45, Joan Miller for the ‘occultic’ circumstances. Thestory of Olga Gray is covered in various MI5 histories, but also see p. 48 ofMasters, TNA KV 4/227 and Daily Mail, 10 October 1997, based on the release ofher files.Dennis Wheatley told his own story in three volumes of autobiographies, and, asto be expected from a master story teller, there are clear exaggerations inplaces. Here the record of his wartime papers by Craig Cabell and a recentmasterly biography by Phil Baker, The Devil Is A Gentleman, provided invaluablebackground. Eric Tombe’s story is also revealed in ‘The Surrey Farm Pit Mystery’sequence based on the inquest which was reported by The Guardian; ‘Missing ManIn Concreted Pit’, 14 September 1923; Death Caused by bullets, 17 September1923; Surrey Farm Crime, 26 September 1923. Further details on Montague Summers,see The Times obituary, 11 August 1968; ‘with its list of black mass’ from p.306, Baker; ‘The three of us settled down’ from Masters; William Younger,discussed by Knight on p. 7, KV4/227 as well as more colourful biographicalsketches of him and the Wheatleys from Joan Miller. Wheatley’s dealings withCrowley, Chapter 24 ‘Luncheon with the devil’, Baker, along with Rollo Ahmeddetails and The Times Diary piece, 18 October 1969, ‘Crowley novel’.The complete story of the remarkable Evan Morgan appears in Paul Busby’s Hush,Hush: The Peculiar Career of Lord Tredegar (2013) as well as various newspaperarticles from when his MI5 files were released in 2004. These include TNAWO71/1078 and KV 4/229–231 about MI5’s pigeon policies. A useful article was theSunday Telegraph, 15 June 2002, ‘Huntin’, Shootin’ – and barkin’ about TredegarHouse and its occupants.For the dealings of all three, see pp. 297–305 of Baker; and Knight’sinvolvement with Crowley is also covered on pp. 161–67 of Francis Wheen’sbiography, The Soul of Indiscretion: Tom Driberg, Poet, Philanderer, Legislatorand Outlaw – His Life and Indiscretions (Fourth Estate, 2001). Quotes are asfollows: ‘applied to Crowley’, Masters, p. 90; ‘his conversation was’, Baker, p.300; the overlap of spooks and authors, p. 280, West paper, ‘Fiction, Factionand Intelligence’; ‘They came to dine’ quote from Wheatley’s last everinterview, ‘That Satan Feeling’, 12 January 1977, The Guardian; plus that samepaper’s appreciation after his death, ‘The dean of the occult’, 12 November1977. For Wheatley’s place in literature, see ‘From saintly snob to savageslob,’ The Times, 18 October 1986.Jack Curry’s history of MI5 was published in 1999 by the (then) PRO and thequote ‘it was obvious that in official’ is taken from p. 110. German perceptionsof Britain are discussed in Irwin Strobel, The Germanic Isle, Nazi Perception ofBritain (see p. 226 for quote).CHAPTER 4 – FROM RUSSIA, WITH CONDOMSAmongst all the speculation, the two standard Fleming biographies which aresuperb are those by Andrew Lycett and John Pearson. Tom Delmer’s own BlackBoomerang is a useful and entertaining romp through his life and times. Thequotes are taken from: ‘striding inexorably across’, Joan Bright Astley, p. 31;‘The result was that Britain’, from JFK’s Why England Slept, p. 165; ‘I am fromBritish Intelligence’, Alan Judd, Sunday Telegraph, 25 August 2012; ‘As soon asI saw him’, Pearson, p. 113; ‘His creator is Ian Fleming’, Pravda, 30 September1965; ‘Isn’t that chap Sefton Delmer’, p. 15, Diamonds Are Forever.Admiral Godfrey has been discussed in detail by his exemplary biographer PatrickBeesley and, to a lesser extent, biographical details appear in anotherexcellent chronicle of what the NID achieved in the war, Donald McLachlan’s Room39. The quote ‘of the devious and unscrupulous’ is from p. xix of the Beesleyintro; ‘with his own quick’, McLachlan, p. 3; see also The Sunday Times,‘Churchill’s Secret Battle with “M”’, 22 June 1980, based on the Beesley book.Max Knight’s discussion of female agents is taken from KV 4/227, with the quotesabout ‘a clever woman and others’, from pp. 19–20; ‘We didn’t lead much of asocial life’, Masters, p. 79. Contemporary reviews of One Girl’s War includethat of Deborah Moggach –‘all the ingredients of a class yarn’ – 21 December1986, The Sunday Times. His intolerant attitude, West paper, op cit, p. 67.The ‘Quacker’ Drake quotes are from his oral history testimony to the ImperialWar Museum (Reel 6, IWM 8250, 1984, Charles Hawken Drake); Friedl Gartner’sofficial MI5 files are found in TNA KV 2/1280 with other details in KV 2/1276;‘I can’t tell you how frightful’, Miller, p. 35; ‘the reason for coming’ is anote dated 18 May 1938 in KV2/1280; ‘why are you here?’ is from p. 15 of thesame TNA file.The background to the day that war broke out may be found on pp. 12–23 of E.S.Turner’s The Phoney War, (St. Martin’s Press, 1961). The quotes are taken from:‘Are you aware that it is?’ Len Deighton, Battle of Britain, p. 61; backgroundon propaganda from Balfour and Cruickshank; ‘the results were not good’, RexLeeper comments from p. 17 of Official PWE history; ‘an interdepartmental game’,Cruickshank, p. 15.The story of the NID as the ‘Dirty Tricks’ department is taken from Appendix G,TNA ADM 224/794; Robert Harling’s recollections of Ian Fleming are taken fromthe 18 August 1964 issue of The Sunday Times (immediately after his friend’sdeath); ‘What nonsense they were’, Pearson, p. 130. Merlin Minshall’s book, GiltEdged, appeared in September 1975. It was reviewed under the title of‘Munchausen RN’ by Ronald Lewin in The Listener of 4 December 1975. The SundayTimes Insight Team looked into Minshall’s claims in ‘Will the real James Bondplease stand up?’ (28 September 1975) and ‘Enter The Real James Bond (5 October1975).Further details from Minshall obituary, The Times, 23 September 1987; andthe phrase ‘shared Bond’s susceptibility to blondes’ is from Foot, SOE, p. 12.The story surrounding Winston’s return – ‘already doing the Admiralty’, p. 279,14 September 1939 entry, Channon diary; further details on Admiral Godfrey’srelationship with Churchill from The Sunday Times, 22 June 1980, as well asdetails in the Beesley biography.The entangled history of British sabotage and propaganda is covered in variousbooks such as the official SOE history by Mackenzie, Howe, Foot, SOE, pp. 3 and5. To understand the convoluted history of all three, see Simon Anglim’s paper‘MI (R), GI (R) and British Covert Operations, 1939–1942’, INS, Vol. 20, No. 4(December 2005), pp. 631–53. Section D and Lawrence Grand are discussed invarious books – notably Jeffery and Foot’s SOE history – as well as Grand’s DNBentry and Lampe.The quotes are taken from: ‘an organisation in which’, Astley, p. 31; ‘I can letyou have one’, Lampe, p. 79; ‘I want you to do sabotage’, Black Game, p. 33;‘Carrying an attack on a Panzer Division’, Jeffery, p. 352, MI6. The Rickmancapers, as they might best be termed, have been discussed in various SOEhistories and Stafford’s Churchill and Secret Service. The best papers on thesubject are ‘Iron Ore and Section D: The Oxelösund Operation’, HistoricalJournal, issue 4 (December 1986), pp. 975–76; and the paper by the ForeignOffice chief historian ‘Gelignite In The Basement’, based on the PUSD records ofMI6 on the SIS website.CHAPTER 5 – EXPLOSIVE FORCESThe events in Munich and Venlo in November 1939 have created their own myths.Several historians have noted a discrepancy in the reported dates for the two,which seem to stem from Walter Schellenberg’s own memoirs, The Labyrinth, firstpublished in 1952. It is a matter of record that the Elser bomb exploded onThursday, 8 November 1939; the Venlo incident the following morning, Friday, 9November 1939.The most readable and useful summary of the events in Munich and Elser’s lifewhich preceded it is in Chapter 2, ‘Georg Elser, The Lone Bomber’ in RogerMoorhouse’s Killing Hitler: The Third Reich and the plots against the Führer(Cape, 2006). For further background to the Elser plot, see also MichaelBalfour, Withstanding Hitler in Germany 1933–45 (Routledge, 1988); MartynHousden, Resistance and Conformity In the Third Reich (Routledge, 1997). Forgeneral information on the Third Reich and the importance of the Munich event,see Ian Kershaw, Nemesis, 1936–1945 (Penguin 2000); and Nigel Farndale’s piece,‘The carpenter who almost killed Hitler’, Daily Telegraph, 13 July 2015.Though several people have suggested Walter Schellenberg was a compulsive liar,his various contemporaneous statements in the MI5 KV 2 files – 94 to 99 – alongwith other interviews which have appeared in other archives such as theNuremberg War Trials and in the US National Archive, broadly agree with his ownaccount. A most useful recent account is that of Reinhard Doerries, Hitler’sLast Chief of Foreign Intelligence, particularly ‘The Formative Period’, ChapterIV.Walter Schellenberg’s career is discussed on p. 260 of Kahn; TNA KV 2/95 186 pt7, where ‘meteoric rise’ is mentioned; ‘to train the youngster himself’, 9 July1945, NRA; ‘that fatuous over-confidence’, Foot, Resistance, p. 135. Details ofthe Venlo Incident and its immediate aftermath are discussed in Chapter 2 ofMoorhouse, pp. 43–53 ; the Krafft elements of the story are discussed on pp.169–71 of Howe; and Schellenberg’s memoirs, particularly pp. 91–93, provide asense of how it was playing out behind the scenes, not least with reference tothe Venlo Incident.The quote ‘perhaps the most disastrous covert’ is from Harrison, p. 516; furtherdetails on Venlo, Elliott, p. 103; ‘One Man Against Tyranny’, Mike Dash, 18August 2011, Smithsonian.com [http://Smithsonian.com]. The astrological falloutfrom the Venlo incident is taken from: Bobrick, p. 286; ‘There is no doubt’,Schellenberg, p. 76; ‘very curious’, Best, p. 15. Supporting details from KV2/94 35a; ‘our number is up’, Best, p. 17; how it played out at the time, seeThe Times, 24 November 1939; for their time in prison, see Best, pp. 41–42;‘40,000 Swiss Francs’, Best, p. 228.The investigation is covered by Moorhouse, pp. 51–55, with quote on ‘perfidiousEnglish’ on p. 51; ‘like a hornet’s nest’, pp. 81–92, Schellenberg memoirs;‘every sort of intrigue’ comes from the entry of 24 November 1939 in Volume 1 ofthe Liddell Diaries, Vol. 1; ‘a selfish feudal landlord’, is from Adam Sisman’sbiography of Trevor-Roper; ‘invisible inks and false beards’, from Cecil, C’sWar, p. 183; Best and the astrologer, from Venlo, p. 57, with further detailsdiscussed on pp. 60–61, Howe; ‘Schellenberg puts forward the suggestion’, fromp. 76, Doerries; ‘[Schellenberg] claims that’ from KV 2/95 39a, p. 34; ‘theworst and most corrupt’, KV 2/94 42a; ‘was an extremely shrewd’ comes from theSchellenberg memo, NA T-175 quoted in Doerries.Wilhelm Canaris’s reaction to the Venlo Incident and its aftermath comes fromHöhne; and further details of Canaris’s growing alienation from the Nazi regimeare from Best, p. 177; Colonel Z, p. 212; Kahn, p. 235. ‘Fabulous, tantalising’,Wighton and Peis, p. 23; ‘I don’t want any of these swine’, Wighton and Peis, p.20; Lahousen’s post-war testimony may be found in KV 2/173 and that ofConstantin Canaris in WO 204/1206. The Hirschbiegel quote is from the Farndalepiece, Daily Telegraph, 13 July 2015. See also ‘Drama celebrates man who triedto kill Adolf Hitler,’ The Guardian, 16 February 2015; while the modern moraldilemma comes from the 5 January 2000 issue of The Times, with Roger Boyes’sstory ‘Bomb attempt on Hitler immoral’.The Tilea affair – concerning a short-term threat to Romania in March 1939 – iscovered from Krafft’s perspective in Howe, Chapter 12, ‘The Affair of the TileaLetter’. Viorel Virgil Tilea himself wrote of his experiences in EnvoyExtraordinary – Memoirs of A Romanian Diplomat (Haggerston, 1998). ProfessorSidney Aster, University of Toronto, who also knew him, has provided asplendidly exhaustive discussion of the whole enterprise in: ‘The Tilea Affair’,Diplomacy & Statecraft, Vol. 13, No. 3 (September 2002). Further backgrounddetails are taken from Sidney Aster’s book about the origins of the Second WorldWar; Tilea’s obituary, which appeared in The Times, 25 September, 1972; and themore recent How War Came by Donald Cameron Watt, pp. 169–72.Quotes concerning Tilea and de Wohl are from: ‘He is not really a professionaldiplomat’, from TNA KV 2/2821 102a 17 September 1940; ‘we do not think’, Bennetton Morton, p. 195; ‘We must have another one’, Aster, p. 159. The variousdenials were reported in The Guardian in the following issues: 20 March 1939,‘Germany and Romania, Reported Demands’; 21 March 1939, ‘Britain Trying To HoldGermany Down; 4 April 1939, ‘British Inquiry About Romania’s Defensive Need’.‘Overzealous’ is from Keith Hitchins, Romania 1866–1947, p. 442 (Clarendon,1994); the quote about Vansittart is taken from The Guardian of 21 March 1939;that same newspaper reported the background to various peace talks on 25 April1939; ‘one Romanian bird’, Gorodetsky, Grand Delusion, p. 71; ‘out ofcuriosity’, Tilea’s own book, p. 271; details on Krafft’s work at this time fromHowe, pp. 175–81; ‘his whole nation benefitted’, Tilea book, p. 271; ‘Louisdescribes Tilea’, note in KV 2/2821 102a, 17 September 1940; ‘I know anastrologer who is not pessimistic’, Tilea, p. 288; ‘Louis says that Krafft’ fromKV 2/2821 102a, 17 September 1940.A full discussion of Nostradamus appears in Howe and also, more recently,Chapter 11 of Stephan Gerson’s book, ‘Nostradamus Is Adolf Hitler’; the quote ‘Irealised the danger’ is from Louis de Wohl’s interviews with The Palestine Post,28 October 1945. The French and Nostradamus, Gerson, pp. 213–16; ‘What Goebbelscalled “Occultist propaganda”’, Gerson, p. 226.CHAPTER 6 – DESPERATE MEASURESDuff Hart-Davis’s exemplary biography of Peter Fleming is a standard referenceto the life of ‘The Squire of Nettlebed’, with particular emphasis here onChapter 10, ‘Into Action’, about his time in Norway. Hart-Davis also penned theDNB entry about his father’s good friend: Peter Fleming’s later role indeception work (after 1942) is also discussed in Thaddeus Holt, The Deceivers,Chapter 8, ‘Hustling The East (1)’.The quote ‘always seemed oddly named’ comes from p. 13 of Beevor. As secretaryto the head of MI (R), Joan Bright (later known by her married name of Astley)wrote her memoirs, The Inner Circle: A View of War At The Top (Memoir ClubReprint, 2007). More famous for working within Churchill’s war cabinet, she isan unsung heroine so far as the history of sabotage papers are concerned. Joancollected most of the papers which form the HS series of MI (R) papers and thenthe later SOE series. The details of Peter Fleming’s proposed work in the FarEast is taken directly from HS8/260, which contains the ‘Progress Reports of MI(R)’ from June 1939 to August 1939, from which his paper is taken.The facts and figures about Swedish iron ore comes from The Times, 2 April 1940;Peter Fleming’s conversation with Churchill is described on p. 231 ofHart-Davis; ‘that slope-shouldered Scarecrow’, More What If? (editor, RobertCowley), p. 279; ‘it was a time when stories’, Milne, p. 73; The firing of Kelland changes to MI5, Andrew, pp. 226–7; background on MI6, Jeffery, pp. 341-7;‘it was not a situation to’, Bennett, p. 248; Hinsley, Vol. 1, p. 164 provides auseful background.Biographical details on Dr Hugh Dalton are taken from the Dictionary of NationalBiography, Robert Skidelsky’s Dalton biography (and the review of that book inthe 2 March 1986 issue of The Sunday Times); further details are from Beevor, p.27, and Jeffery, p. 353; ‘we must not have quarrels’, Bennett, p. 252.Dennis Wheatley’s activities in the summer of 1940 are covered in Cabell, pp.30–31; the Auxiliary Units from Hart Davis, pp. 233–8, and Lampe, p. 84;Bioweapons – December 2014 newspapers; Wheatley’s discussion of such weapons ison p. 40, Cabell, and p. 400, Baker.Schellenberg’s role in the Arrest List is discussed in John Erickson’sintroduction to Invasion 1940!, reprinted in 2000 by St Ermin’s Press. The storyabout the Ashdown Forest bombing is from the Derby Telegraph, 3 June 1940. Thestory of Morgan, pigeons and his later court martial is taken from KV 4/229–31and WO71/1078.Nikolaus Ritter spoke with the German author Gunther Peis for his The Mirror ofDeception (Weidenfield, 1977), which often relied on faulty recollections. Yethis meeting with Admiral Canaris seems accurate: see p. 39, ‘I got a note’. Themore accurate recollections of Ritter and the spies he despatched that summer of1940 may be found in various MI5 documents as follows: Ritter’s files (KV 2/88);Carl Meier (KV2/12); Charles van der Kieboom (KV2/11); Sjoerd Pons (KV2/13);Jose Waldberg (KV2/107). Further information used here about Operation Lena, KV2/1699 pp. 17–19; KV 2/1348a; ‘we will need to’, Peis, p. 33; ‘Himmelfahrt’,Farago, The Game of The Foxes (David & Charles, 1971), p. 237; Cromwell,Bennett, p. 60; the Caroli story, KV 2/60, pp. 38–40, with Straits quote from p.39.CHAPTER 7 – DARKNESS AND LIGHTThe story of Tom Delmer’s summer of 1940 are told in his autobiographical TheBlack Boomerang. His report from Dover is in the 17 September 1940 issue of theDaily Express. The quote about the leaflets comes from his interview withrefugees in the 12 October 1940 issue, ‘Little Belgium Stirs’. Details about thereaction to Delmer’s speech come from the Daily Express, 16 October 1940,‘Minister Defends Delmer’s Speech’, and in the immediate aftermath, The Times,25 July 1940.‘Don’t take it too badly,’ Cabell, p. 10; background on Hitler’s speech fromBullock and William Shirer, The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich; ‘We arefighting to preserve’, Daily Express, 16 October 1940; the Tilea quote is fromThe Guardian, 12 September 1965; ‘What do I have to do?’, McGinty, p. 27; ‘agreat booming bully’, Balfour; ‘an impudent attempt’, ‘Dalton Diaries’, 22November 1940; Richard Skate details from Greene’s ‘Men At Work’; ‘I loved theBlitz’, p. 289, Michael Shelden, Graham Greene, The Man Within (1994) andfurther background details from Jeremy Lewis, Shades of Greene (2010, JonathanCape).Wilhelm Canaris’s time in Spain is discussed in a number of biographies andbooks. The quotes are taken from: ‘Uncle is here’, Höhne, p. 429; Kahn, p. 238;Bassett, p. 137; and to a lesser extent, Ladislas Farago, The Games of the Foxes(1971), who later claimed to have met Canaris in person; ‘They corresponded withBerlin’, Kenneth Benton, ‘The ISOS years – Madrid 1941–1943’,p. 379, and Journalof Contemporary History, Vol. 30 (1995), pp. 395–410.Ken Benton was the former MI6 Station Chief in Madrid and his recollections area remarkably candid guide to what happened in the Iberian operation at the startof the war. The quotes are from: ‘no experience with foreign names’, KV 3/271,p. 3 118b, a later review of intelligence from Madrid; most of the Hoare quotesare taken from J.A. Cross, Sir Samuel Hoare, A Political Biography (1977),particularly p. 319; ‘germanised press’, Hillgarth biography by Hart-Davis, p.201; ‘Falangist Mob’, Benton paper, p. 379; Neill Lochery quote is from p. 64 ofhis book, Lisbon: War In The Shadows In the City Of Light, 1939–1945. Thebroader details of Operation Felix are discussed by Brissaud on p. 191; ‘sentpeople onboard ships’, KV 3/371 p. 4; visit to nearby hotel, Höhne, p. 425;Cowboy and Indians quote, p. 429 Höhne.The situation in Madrid is discussed in Hinsley, pp. 275–76; Hillgarth to Hoarememo, p. 331 of Cross; ‘shop window’ is from David Scherr’s history of securityon the rock in KV4/259, pp. 17–18; the observations on the Abwehr come from ‘TheKO in Spain’, from pp. 3–4 in KV 3/271. All other Hillgarth quotes on this pageare from that same document, especially pages 4 and 7.The situation with regard to espionage in Portugal is covered by extensive MI5files. Many may be found in KV3/170–174, the MI5 ‘policy’ series which dealswith espionage activities in Lisbon. In particular, KV 3/170 deals with Abwehractivities in the crucial 1940–41 time period when it was realised how importanta springboard it was for espionage. It is not too much of an exaggeration to saythat the cat and mouse games – guided by decrypted codes – provided BritishIntelligence with their first victories in the secret war.The situation in Lisbon may be found in KV 3/170 81b; Lochery, p. 67; Benton, p.386. All of the details on the Duke of Windsor are from Bloch, Lochery andSchellenberg’s memoir, as well as KV 2/95. In his various interrogations,Schellenberg was oddly reticent about his time in Iberia: as Michael Blochpoints out in his masterly study, his time there can be reconstructed from histelegrams to Berlin (though not all have survived) and his RSHA log – revealingmovements and encounters – which as Doerries noted, p. 15, involved ‘aspectsbordering on the ridiculous’.The situation in Madrid by the end of the year is discussed in: Hillgarth, p.204; Benton paper, p. 379; on Gibraltar invasion, Bassett, p. 200; ‘If Spainwere dragged’, Johns, p. 77. Tom Delmer was in Iberia for three months, filingstories as and when he could. His ‘Slave States’ articles for the Daily Expressare as follows: ‘If they had conquered us’, 23 October 1940; ‘They are forced todig for (Nazi) victory’, 24 October 1940; ‘Freedom Fighters Call it the Nazi RawDeal’, 25 October 1940; ‘This is the day the real France waits for’, 26 October1940. Further details are from 5 December 1940 issue, ‘Berlin’s Bomb curfew’,and 6 February 1941, ‘They said the [Royal] Navy.’Dusko Popov was described as ‘a new agent of high quality’, from p, 56, XXSystem. Of all the double agents, Dusko Popov was one of the more honest. Acursory examination of his MI5 files are at variance with some of his moreextravagant claims in his somewhat self-serving (though highly entertaining)memoir, Spy/Counterspy, which was originally published in 1974. It is clear thatDusko Popov exaggerated aspects of the basic, often prosaic realities of hiswartime secret service and that his memory played tricks in recalling the exactsequence of events. His MI5 files relevant to the early years may be found in KV2/846–850, containing a wealth of details. The more recent biography by RussellMiller tells the more accurate story.The quotes are from: ‘The German secret service is very active’, KV 3/170 6a13.1.41; ‘all the charm, sexual energy’, Bassett; ‘by Yugoslav standard’,Spy/Counterspy, p. 5.The Gibraltar song is from Bristow, p. 50; ‘How much I appreciated, Hart-Davis,Hillgarth, p. 203. The various Goldeneye Files may be found in ADM 223/490; seealso Stafford, Churchill and Secret Service, p. 125. The details of Tom Delmer’srecruitment into the secret world come from The Black Boomerang supported by thePWE Official History.CHAPTER 8 – THE STARS FORETELLThe real story of what Louis de Wohl did for British Intelligence can now betold thanks to the release of all relevant files in the National Archives:notably, his Security Service files in KV2/2821; from Naval Intelligence, ADM223/84 (a handful of pages amongst the more sober [and realistic] business ofNaval Intelligence); the Colonial Office, CO 875/910 ‘Propaganda: Use ofAstrology’; for MI14, the SOE War Diary section on ‘Louis de Wohl: SOE andAstrological Propaganda’, HS 7/216-223; while WO 208/4475 – ‘The Orchestra ofHitler’s Death’ – was an attempt by MI14 to assess ‘the mind of Hitler’ andcontains various MI6 political reports, rumours and odd statements, culminatingin the various prognostications of what is termed ‘our friend’. Clearly, the deWohl musings were a minor operation in the grander scheme and should be read assuch; over the years, they have been exaggerated into something bigger, notleast conflating with the arrival of Rudolf Hess (about which, oddly, de Wohlwas uncharacteristically quiet). A useful summary is P.R.J. Winter’s paper,‘Libra Rising, Hitler, Astrology and British Intelligence, 1940–1943’,Intelligence and National Security, Vol. 21, No. 3 (June 2006), pp. 394–415,though he did not have the benefit of access to Louis de Wohl’s MI5 files whichwere released two years later.For background on Admiral Godfrey’s unusual interests, see: ‘the paradoxes andcontradictions’, Beesley, p. xix; ‘enjoyed greatly the company of scholars’, TheTimes obituary, ‘An outstanding Director of Naval Intelligence’, 31 August 1971;‘under circumstances’, Beesley, pp. 185–6; ‘It had occurred to that ingenious’,Montagu, Beyond Top Secret U, p. 29.The general outline of what Louis de Wohl did in the summer and autumn of 1940may be found in his autobiography (with obvious reservations) though someassertions are supported by the MI5 files. The quote ‘careful and tactful’ isfrom KV 2/2821, 117a 8. April 1941; contemporary reports on the Harrogateastrologers’ conference include: ‘he would scarcely have made war’, Daily Mail,26 March 1940; ‘bad until November’, Orchestra of Hitler’s Death, p. 3, WO208/4475.The culmination of de Wohl’s time that autumn may be found in TNA ADM 223/84 –‘Memo by J.H. Godfrey – ‘The Astrological Tendencies of Herr Hitler’s horoscope’report by Louis de Wohl, dated 14 September 1940; details on his appearance comefrom Jay article, ‘dressed in a splendid officer’s uniform’; Leo Marks on SirCharles Hambro, Between Silk And Cyanide: A Codebreaker’s War (HarperCollins,2000) from p. 26; employed personally by Hambro, KV 2/2821, note 15 October1942.The demise of Knight’s career is discussed in Miller, Masters and the files onthe Ben Greene case which prompted it, which may be found in KV 4/227.The Tilea article ‘Hitler as Napoleon’, The Times, 27 June 1941.

The quote ‘under an atmosphere of great secrecy’, KV2/2281 114a 10 March 1941.The astrologers’ conference in Harrogate in March 1941 was covered by allnewspapers. The quote ‘the men who dare’ came from the previous year’sconference, Daily Mail, March 26 1940; ‘Astrologers are unanimous’, 26 March1941; ‘one thing is certain’, 24 March 1941; ‘end of actual fighting’, 15 April1941. ‘Momentous historical event’, Howe, p. 204.

RobertHarling’s obituary of Howe was in the 8 October 1991 issue of The Guardian,‘Impish imprint of a printer’s devil’. As with Tom Delmer, Howe was too modestto note his own crucial contribution to the subject though, amusingly, he noteson p. 6 of The Black Game, ‘The 545 messy files which are available at the TNA(PRO) survived more by chance than by any scientific archival policy. A briskgallop through his work is contained on pp. 191–92 of the Official PWE History.As well as Tom Delmer’s recollections in Black Boomerang, his nemesis Sir HughCarleton Greene’s The Third Floor Front: A View Of Broadcasting In The Sixties(Bodley Head) deals with his view of broadcast propaganda from pp. 17–30. Anexcellent introduction to the Political Warfare Executive may be found in AndrewRoberts’s intro to the Official PWE History by David Garnett, from which thequote ‘two combative ministers’ is taken from page xi.Other quotes are: ‘a gigantic waste of time’, Giuseppe Martelli, letter to TheTimes, 4 June 1973; ‘the nearest thing to a genius’, Howe, Black Game, p. 95;‘If the Department’s Installation’, Howe, Black Game, p. 44; Crossman detailsand quotes from his biographer, Tony Howard; ‘For deception purposes’, CarletonGreene, p. 25 and other quotes from pp. 21–25; ‘Delmer had an unusual’, Howe,Black Game, p. 19; ‘indefatigable’, Garnett, p. 47; ‘was able to speak Berlinslang’, Howard, Crossman biography, p. 87.The story of the Double XX – or Twenty Club – operations has been told manytimes before, but perhaps the most lapidary version is that from John C.Masterman himself. The Double Cross System of 1939–1945 – and, indeed his ownautobiography, On The Chariot Wheel – are standard texts. Two recent academicpapers tell the background and subsequent history of Masterman’s contribution tothe secret war. See E.D.R. Harrison, ‘J.C. Masterman and The Security Service,1940–1972’, Intelligence and National Security, 24:6 (2009), pp. 769–804; andalso John P. Campbell, ‘A Retrospective on John Masterman’s The Double CrossSystem’, International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 18(2005), pp. 320–53 (2005).The quotes are: ‘Dimly, very dimly’, Masterman, p. 85; ‘club cricket’,Masterman, p. 90; ‘The Abwehr in the field’, p. 6 KV 3/8 131c 31 October 1944;‘The really valuable stuff’, p. 4 KV 3/8 131c; ‘There are signs the German’, KV3/172 116x 15 June 43; ‘The whole organisation’, Holt, The Deceivers, p. 105.The various investigations of the secret agencies into Louis de Wohl and hiswife, Alexandra, are contained in KV 2/2821. The quotes are: ‘We know all abouthim’, 109b January 1941; ‘one of the other funny people’, 109a 20.1.41; ‘hard upfor money’, folio 108b; ‘To the best of my knowledge’, 109b; ‘via the Bank ofEngland’, 109a; Colonel Hope reference from note on 12 May 1941; ‘mysterywoman’, folio B24, 8 April 1941; ‘German harlots’, folio 105a 3 October 1940; ‘Ihave never liked’, note on 17 February 1942. The story of Aspidistra is told inthe PWE history and Black Boomerang; ‘atmosphere of club chat’, Howard, p. 86.Ken Benton’s paper is a useful guide to how Section V operated in Iberia. Thequotes are: ‘By the end of the war’, Life of Greene, p. 172; ‘These views causedfriction’, Montagu, ISO, 25 Sept 1945, quoted in Holt, The Deceivers. Much ofPhilby, Bristow and Benton’s various correspondence may be found in KV 3/170–2,each laboriously dealing with suspects. Kim Philby’s My Silent War, thoughmordantly funny, is remarkable for what it left out. A useful guide is RobertCecil’s ‘Philby’s Spurious War’, Intelligence & National Security, Vol. 9, No. 4(October 1994), pp. 764–68, which sets everything into perspective. A usefulpopular guide is ‘The Lisbon Operation’, Chapter 3 of Within Two Cloaks –Missions with SIS and SOE by Philip Johns (Kimber, 1979). The quotes are: ‘wewere six officers’, Sherry, Greene biography Vol. 2, p. 167; ‘I am a royalparrot’, Bristow, p. 18.Dennis Wheatley in 1941 is discussed by Cabell and Baker; Deceivers, p. 168.‘After the Battle’, p. 164 of Cabell for the paper.As regards Philby’s role, there are two broad camps in analysis: eithermischief-making or severe criticisms. In the former are all his own writings,Kerr paper: ‘A few home truths about Philby’s Silent War’ Cecil, The Times, 2February 1978; for which his INS paper is important – ‘Philby’s Spurious War’,Vol. 9, No. 4 (October 1994), pp. 761–68. More Thoughts on Kim Philby’s MySilent War’, INS, Vol. 10, No. 3 (January 1995), pp. 514–25, where he roundlycriticises SIS and Menzies. Bristow, A Game of Moles, Chapter 2, ‘Spain to StAlbans with Philby’ provides much useful background to the real work of SectionV.CHAPTER 10 – SKY FALLNever in the field of publishing have so many conspiracies been aired by so manywriters and fanned by so many flames over the Internet. From the outset, Iconsulted two level-headed volumes which provided the best insight into whathappened in May 1941: Grand Delusion by Gabriel Gorodetsky (Yale, 1999) andFlight From Reality (Pimlico, 2001), edited by David Stafford, based on aconference at Edinburgh University. Both books provide the all important contextto an often wilfully misunderstood story which has generated a vast literature,which veers from the sublime to the ridiculous. The release in 1999 of therelevant MI5 file (KV 2/38), far from laying ghosts to rest has merely inflamedthe situation. On its first page, the Hess file shows that seventy-nine pageshave been held back, which are fully expected to be released in 2017.Alan Clark’s article, ‘A reputation ripe for revision’, 2 January 1993, TheTimes. The sections from Flying Visit are: ‘English men and women!’, p. 77;‘Sweetie Pie’, p. 81. The work of the PWE, Sefton Delmer and the propagandistson both sides of the fighting in the subsequent months has, for the first time,been examined in an exemplary academic paper. Dr Jo Fox’s ‘Propaganda and theFlight of Rudolf Hess’, Journal of Modern History (March 2011), pp. 78–110, isan exhaustive guide. That same year, to coincide with the 70th anniversary ofHess’s flight, Stephen McGinty’s Camp Z showed for the first time how Hess wastreated after his imprisonment. It is without a doubt one of the better overallchronicles of the whole story. Peter Padfield’s Hess, Hitler and Churchill: TheReal Turning Point of World War Two – A Secret History (Icon, 2011) containsmuch useful, though in places circumstantial, evidence. See also JasperCopping’s story in the 26 September 2013 issue of the Daily Telegraph.‘It seems incredible,’ Gorodetsky, p. 249; notes from C may be found in FO1093.10 folios; ‘for a moment, I thought she was joking’, Ranfurly diaries, p.5; ‘had staggered the world’, The Times editorial, 14 May 1941; ‘Horoscope“lured” Hess to Britain’, The Times, 15 September 1969; see also ‘Book SaysFalse Horoscope Lured Hess to Scotland’, Baltimore Sun, 29 September 1969.For the reaction of the Gestapo, see the chapter in Howe, The Aktion Hess. ‘TopNazi’s Crash Landing in Scotland Remains A Mystery After Seventy Years’, DailyRecord, 13 April 2011. ‘Records unlock secrets behind Hess Mission,’ by MikeEvans, The Times, 11 June 1992.

Further details about Aleister Crowley’s role – which was to say theleast tangential – may be found in Churton, p. 286.The quote from Allan Hepburn is taken from p. 11 of his splendid, sociologicalstudy of the impact of espionage, Intrigue – Espionage & Culture (Yale, 2005).The quote ‘He towers above all others’, from Baltimore Sun, 7 August 1941.CHAPTER 11 – ACROSS THE WATERMuch misinformation about the role of William Stephenson appears in print andthis has skewed – and often still does – the story of why Admiral Godfreyvisited the United States in the summer of 1941 with Ian Fleming. The paper byBradley F. Smith, ‘Admiral Godfrey’s Mission to America, June, July 1941’ inINS, Vol. 1, issue 3, 1986 was the first to show the reality of what occurred.As noted in the text, William Stevenson’s A Man Called Intrepid (1975) andHarford Montgomery Hyde’s The Quiet Canadian: The Secret Service Story of SirWilliam Stephenson (1963) created many myths about his role. Along with AnthonyCave Brown’s Bodyguard of Lies, the former was published in the seventies togreat sales and critical derision. It has taken the more scholarly work of GillBennett, Keith Jeffery and others to unpick the true story of the BSC inAmerica, not least with the publication of the official BSC history itself (StErmins, 2001).A spirited telling of the story of the arrival of Godfrey and Fleming in the USmay be found in the first few pages of Mark Riebling, Wedge: From Pearl Harborto 9/11 – How the Secret War Between the FBI and CIA Has Endangered NationalSecurity (New York, Simon & Schuster, 2002). The quotes are as follows: ‘I haveappointed’, Bennett, p. 254; ‘to organise the American public’, Jeffery, p. 440;‘Fact is a figure’, Bennett, p. 253.For the role of Noel Coward, see note 2, p. 364; also p. 177, Dalton Diaries.The quote ‘reached its forte fortissimo’, is from p. 6, WO 208/4475; for more onRoald Dahl’s work, see The Irregulars: Roald Dahl and the British Spy Ring inWartime Washington by Jeanne Conant (Simon & Schuster, 2003) which,understandably, has only a cursory reference to Louis de Wohl.The barest bones of the astrologer’s visit to the United States were alsodiscussed by Ellic Howe, who did not have access to any files: the quotes ‘atfairly frequent intervals’ is from Howe, p. 212. Those files, alas, arefragmentary, comprising: ‘SOE War Diary: survey of Global activities’ HS 7/216 –HS 7/223, from May to December 1941; the section ‘Propaganda By The Stars’, pp.102–04 of the official BSC history (as noted in the text). Contemporary USnewspaper clippings are: ‘Hitler’s star is setting’, New York Sun, 22 June 1941;‘It was planned’, BSC history, p. 102; see also the Hotchkiss story, BaltimoreSun, 1 November 1959.For Dusko Popov’s time in the United States, see his KV files and also hisbiographies. ‘I didn’t think could tell you’, from Miller, p. 104; mikropunktdetails from KV 2/848; ‘vigorously protest’, Hoover memo, newspapers in December2014; On Miami Beach, ‘I’ll take her to South America’, from Miller, p. 102. Alevel-headed discussion of Hoover’s mishandling of the Tricycle affair may befound in Thomas Troy, ‘The British Assault on J. Edgar Hoover’, InternationalJournal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 3, No. 2, (1989), pp. 169–209.Later Louis de Wohl newspaper coverage is: ‘Hitler’s move on Russia’, APCleveland, 6 August 1941; ‘Hitler will die soon, Stars Inform VisitingAstrologer’, Los Angeles Times, 9 September 1941; ‘Hitler’s astrologer seesheavenly stop light’, NY Sunday News, 27 July 1941; ‘Hitler and the astrologer’,Baltimore Sun, 7 August 1941.

Louis de Wohl’s return to the UK iscovered in: ‘I didn’t expect to be met’, 135a KV 2/2821 4 March 1942; ‘not soinexpensive flat’, 135a KV 2/2821; further details from note 201B, 14 January1942; the phrase ‘complete scoundrel’ and reference to Tom Delmer is a laternote dated 22 July 1942.CHAPTER 12 – ZENITHSefton Delmer’s memories and those of the PWE history coincide: while thehistory of the U-boats comes from various histories, especially Dönitz and theWolf Packs by Bernard Edwards (1999) and the biography by Peter Padfieldpublished by Harper Collins in 1985.
