RosenAs far as we can discern, the sole purpose of humanexistence is to kindle a light in the darkness of merebeing.—C. G. JungNearly six months before Stan Marlan’s superb 2003 Fay Lecture se-ries on the black sun, I had this dream: There was too much light andbrightness everywhere. I gave a talk on the need for darkness and itshealing value. I said I could always leave Star, a town at the periphery.I realized that I could break offand leave and go to the Texas hill coun-try and write haiku.The dream is about enantiodromiaand the restorative necessity ofdarkness and its nurturing solitude. I became aware that I could leaveStar (a constant source of light) and end up alone in the Texas hill coun-try writing haiku. This breaking offand leaving is what I call egocide(symbolic death), which leads to transformation (rebirth) throughcreativity.1The black sun and the alchemy and art of darkness are subjects dearto my heart and soul.2When I was in a psychic black hole contemplat-ing suicide thirty-five years ago, my own darkness went through an al-chemical process involving art.3I was able to transcend my despair andlater transform my depression, healing my soul through creativity.

As Stan Marlan out-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"lines in this important book, the secret is to engage in the alchemy andart of darkness, which yields creative endeavors through Jung’s tech-nique of active imagination. Usually I do this through painting andwriting, most recently by completing a book on The Healing Spirit ofHaiku.4Given my experience with and affinity for darkness, I eagerly readMarlan’s Black Sun,which explores darkness in vast and deep ways.Irvin Yalom states, “Everyone—and that includes therapists as well aspatients—is destined to experience not only the exhilaration of life,but also its inevitable darkness: disillusionment, aging, illness, isola-tion, loss, meaninglessness, painful choices, and death.”5Yalom alsostates that there is an “inbuilt despair in the life of every self-consciousindividual.”6In the deep dark the person alone sees light.—Chuang Tzu7In the introduction, Marlan says that the black sun became a Zenkoan for him. This got me thinking about the time I spent in Japan andthe fact that in the Shinto religion the sun is considered a goddess. Inother words, a black (yin) sun that glows and inspires creative works isSol niger(black sun) functioning as a muse. Thus, in the land wheredarkness is praised, fear of the dark is overcome, and the black sun is acreative fire that heals.8Most striking—and a testament of the truth ofan inner shine of darkness—is that blind people see light in their darkinterior.In chapter 1 Marlan begins with a focus on the sun as the source oflight and its association with the King (a divine archetype). He givesseveral excellent alchemical examples of how the King must die in or-der to be born again. Closer to home, Elvis Presley, America’s “King,”illustrates the theme of this book in that he represents a dark King. Hegot stuck in the nigredo(darkness) and was poisoned. However, afterElvis died he continued to live on, reborn as a dark or blue King withan inner spiritual glow.9In chapter 2 we descend with Marlan into the darkness and see thenecessity of experiencing one’s own “dark night of the soul.” A case of(x)Series Editor’s Foreword"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"a troubled woman is presented, which includes dramatic illustrationsof the black sun. Her image of an “exploding black sun” is associatedwith “the madness of her suicidal feelings.” It may also have foretold an aneurysm in the anterior region of her brain. She survived thisnear-death experience but lost sight in one eye. This case underscoresthe danger involved in getting close to the black sun. Marlan presentsanother case, also of a woman in long-term analysis who creativelytransforms her suicidal feelings based on contact with the black sun.This patient’s words and drawings are profound, and Marlan links thedeep, dark work to powerful archetypal images from art, religion, andliterature.Chapter 3 outlines how analysis (breaking apart) is like the alchem-ical processes of mortificatioand putrefaction. Marlan describes bril-liantly—and reveals through his alchemical psychological approach—how analyzing the ego to death opens the psyche to creative transfor-mations involving the deep art of darkness. In essence, Marlan showsus how darkness heals by shining through.In chapter 4 Marlan focuses on Jewish mysticism (primarily thekabbalah), Taoist alchemy, and illuminating pictures from artists andpatients. Through these it becomes clear that darkness itself glows witha unique spiritual light. Marlan humbles us before a myriad of glimpsesof Sol niger.The last chapter concerns the mystery of Self and non-Self as Oneor Not-One. I think his position would be acceptable to both Lao Tzuand Jung, although Jung was more comfortable with the dark side ofthe Self rather than non-Self. For Jungian analysts who are Buddhists,such as Polly Young-Eisendrath, the paradox of Self and non-Self makesparticular sense.10Jungian analysts who are Taoist in their spiritualorientation are also content with the irony of opposites: nothingness/fullness, dark/light, and evil/good.11Why? Because it is impossible toknow one without the other. Transcendence of these opposites allowsfor the possibility of wholeness and emptiness. And, as we often see inthis book, transformation of the opposites allows for creative art andhealing.In the epilogue, Marlan distills the essence of the journey he hastaken us on from light to darkness and then to the light of darkness it-Series Editor’s Foreword(xi)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"self. I wholeheartedly support Marlan’s maxim of preserving the mys-tery of Self and non-Self as a paradox. In the end it is both/and. LikeVictor Hugo’s last words, we see “black light”:Seeing into darkness is clarity.Knowing how to yield is strength.Use your own light and return to the source of light.This is called practicing eternity.—Lao Tzu12This volume helps us to understand the source of archetypal dark-ness and its relationship to a psychic crisis involving the black sun. Aswe know from Chinese philosophy, crisis involves both danger andopportunity. It is noteworthy that dreams of a black sun or an arche-typal abyss can be both a warning of psychic and/or physical demise aswell as the beginning of a significant renewal.In alchemy the nigredo is first, and, according to Plato, the begin-ning is the most important part of the work. I agree with Marlan thatdarkness has neither been seen as primary nor valued for its inherenthealing power and creative transformation.13The opportunity forhealing through the art of darkness is ever present and extremely wellillustrated in the text.Another example of the alchemy and art of darkness as well as ego-cide and transformation is William Styron’s eloquent memoir, Dark-ness Visible.14It is a book about his fall into a suicidal void and hisstruggle to climb out. Most likely he was guided by a healing glow com-ing from Sol niger.On May 15, 2003, while I was editing this manuscript, there was aluna niger,a total eclipse of the moon by the sun’s shadow. Marlanwrites about the shadow of the sun and its darkness, and where is thismore apparent than in a total eclipse of the moon? Perhaps in our timethis represents the patriarchal Sun King and its shadow, which eclipsesthe feminine, whereas the black sun has no need to eclipse the moonbecause both have a soft glow, one from within and the other fromouter reflection.(xii)Series Editor’s Foreword"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"To conclude, this volume is extraordinary in its breadth and depthand in its objective and subjective scope. Stan Marlan’s method of il-lustrating the alchemy and art of darkness with clinical cases, draw-ings, and paintings is rare and truly phenomenal. Clearly this book willenrich us all.I close with the poet Wendell Berry’s words, which seem connectedto Sol niger:To go in the dark with a light is to know the light. To know thedark, go dark. Go without sight, and find that the dark, too,blooms and sings, and is traveled by dark feet and dark wings.15Notes1.D. H.

What I initially thought was a rare and obscure phenome-non proved to be far more widespread than I had imagined. I havesince found it to be linked to the deepest issues of our mortality and toboth tragic and ecstatic possibilities.The groundwork of my fascination with the black sun was laiddown long ago—in childhood. I remember thinking about death, re-alizing that I would die along with everyone and everything I loved andvalued. My thoughts about mortality took on an obsessive quality, andI wondered why not everyone spent all of their time trying to solve theproblem of dying. Over the years I learned much about the historicaland psychodynamic reasons for my obsessions, and even though theissue of personal mortality no longer aroused in me the same level ofanxiety, I still struggled to find a stance in regard to this inescapableand existential truth of life.I once had a dream of floating on a raft moving toward a waterfall.I was standing with my back to the direction of the flow but was bentover in order to see where the raft was going. I could see that it wouldat some point fall over a precipice, which would mean certain death. Iheard a voice say, “Yes, you are going to die, but you don’t have to bendover backward to see it.” While the truth and humor of this dream gaveme some relief from my obsession, I never quite stood up completelystraight again.My reflective turn toward death marks my melancholic characterand, like the historical alchemist who has a skull on his bench as a me-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"mento mori, concern with mortality remains a part of my psychic real-ity. I now believe that these concerns prepared the way for my engage-ment with the black sun, a dark and burning ball of fire, an intensity ofdarkness and light that became like a Zen koan to me.The Mumonkan, a classic collection of Zen koans gathered by thethirteenth-century, Chinese Zen master Mumon, speaks of the in-escapability of the koan. It is like swallowing a red-hot iron ball thatyou cannot actively expel. However, you cannot passively leave it insideyou either, or it will kill you. The Mumonkan describes the situation asone in which one’s whole being has been plunged into great doubt. All of one’s emotions are exhausted; one’s intellect has come to extrem-ity. Rinzai, a well-known, ninth-century Chinese Zen master, once de-scribed this state as the whole universe plunged into darkness.1Thisdescription fits my relationship with the black sun. Over the years spentin writing this book, I have taken in this black sun like a red-hot ironball that I have been unable to expel. It has become not only my darkkoan but also an enigmatic and infernal light referred to in alchemy asSol niger.Sol niger is an image that Jung wrote about in his late works onalchemy, and though it played a relatively marginal role in his reflec-tions, I have found its implications to merit a far more extensive ex-ploration. This image has shown itself in relation to the darkest andmost destructive situations, in what the alchemists have called theblacker-than-black dimensions of the nigredo.The term nigredois usu-ally thought of as a beginning process in alchemy, roughly equivalentto a descent into the unconscious. In the face of this darkness and thesuffering that sometimes accompanies it, there is a natural tendency toturn away from the psyche. While this defensive process is at timesnecessary, it may also inhibit or bypass a hidden potential in the dark-ness itself. The dark side of psychic life is both dangerous and at timestragic, but the acceptance of its tragic potential was for Jung a neces-sity. He noted that the cure for suffering might well be more suffering.In the Visions Seminar of 1933, a participant, Dr. Baker, commentedon Jung’s ideas and offered the group a passage from Miguel de Una-muno’s book The Tragic Sense of Life:(4)Introduction"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The cure for suffering—which is the collision of consciousnesswith unconsciousness—is not to be submerged in unconscious-ness, but to be raised to consciousness and to suffer more. Theevil of suffering is cured by more suffering, by higher suffering.Do not take opium, but put salt and vinegar in the soul’s wound,for when you sleep and no longer feel the suffering, you are not.And to be, that is imperative. Do not then close your eyes to theagonizing Sphinx, but look her in the face, and let her seize youin her mouth, and crunch you with her hundred thousand poi-sonous teeth, and swallow you. And when she has swallowedyou, you will know the sweetness of the taste of suffering.2There will be little opium and plenty of salt and vinegar as we beginour descent into darkness. Nevertheless, you may also find some sur-prises as we follow Sol niger in clinical practice and through myth, lit-erature, the creative arts, and various traditions at once philosophical,religious, and mystical. The black sun is a paradox. It is blacker thanblack, but it also shines with a dark luminescence that opens the wayto some of the most numinous aspects of psychic life. It proffers a mir-acle of perception at the heart of what Jung called the mysterium con-iunctionis.Considering the complexity of Sol niger will give us an op-portunity to consider Jung’s idea of the Self in a new way—one thatboth critiques and preserves its integrity as a central mystery of thepsyche, which for Jung was always fundamental.In chapter one we set the stage for our exploration by discussing theprimacy of light as a metaphor for consciousness. We then consider theimportance of the alchemical deconstruction of this light, which pre-pares us for our descent into the unconscious. There is a lot of darkmaterial, and the descent is difficult and painful. In chapter two we fol-low a path, not from darkness into light, but from light into darknessand into the shine of darkness itself. Beginning with Goethe’s Faust,welook at a series of vignettes—literary and clinical—in which the blacksun appears and becomes important. These illustrations lead to theblacker-than-black aspects of Sol niger, and these serve as the founda-tion for our ongoing exploration.Introduction(5)"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The third chapter, titled “Analysis and the Art of Darkness,” looks atthe issue of trauma as one response to Sol niger. We examine some ofJungian analyst Don Kalsched’s contributions to this theme from hiswork, The Inner World of Trauma,particularly the idea of the defensesof the Self as an archetypal process protecting the Self from disinte-gration. My reflection on the black sun explores a different perspectivewith regard to the archetypal functioning of psychological life. If wecan for a moment project human intention onto the dark forces thatattack the psyche, I believe their aim is not always to protect but ratherto mortify the Self and to drive it into the unthinkable, which the ideaof archetypal defense seeks to avoid. In this light we also look at thecontribution of Jungian analyst David Rosen to this theme in his bookTransforming Depressionand his idea of egocide and the strange con-fluence of death and new life. From my perspective, this theme ofrenewal does not follow simply from symbolic death but is actuallyfundamental and at the core of Sol niger, which expresses itself in thesimultaneity of blackness and luminescence, the central mystery of theblack sun.We then amplify this imagery by turning to the world of art andparticularly to painters who have spent parts of their careers paintingblack suns and/or a kind of luminescent blackness. We look briefly atthe works of Max Ernst, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Pierre Soulage,and Anselm Kiefer and place their discoveries in the alchemical con-text of the lumen naturae, the dark light of nature. For the alchemists,the lumen naturae is a different kind of light that shines at the core ofmatter and within the ancient idea of the subtle or illuminated body.Chapter four explores a number of different, subtle body images fromkabbalah, Tantra, Taoist alchemy, and contemporary art. These tradi-tions serve as a background for looking at a patient’s artwork, whichJung writes about in his Alchemical Studies,in which a black sun ap-pears in her solar plexus, an important area in many subtle body tra-ditions. It is a place to which, according to Jung, the gods haveretreated in our modern era.Finally we discuss the black sun as an image of the non-Self. Thisreflection focuses on a way of understanding the Self not so much asan ideal union of opposites but rather as paradox and monstrosity.(6)Introduction"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"In writing this book, my childhood concerns about mortality arenot resolved but show themselves in a new dark light that leaves mewith a feeling of compassion and gratitude for each moment of life.This drives my spiritual and therapeutic sensibilities, and thus mywork ends less with anxiety and more with wonder.

Alchemy for the most part had been relegated to the sta-tus of a historical anachronism or hidden away within the confines ofesoteric occultism. To the contemporary mind, alchemists were viewedas working in their laboratories, hopelessly trying to change lead intogold. At best, their practice was seen as a precursor to the modern sci-ence of chemistry.Jung began his reflections with a similar attitude, but as his inquirygrew deeper, he concluded that the alchemists were speaking in sym-bols about the human soul and were working as much with the imag-ination as with the literal materials of their art. The gold that they weretrying to produce was not the common or vulgar gold but an aurumnon vulgior aurum philosophicum—a philosophical gold (Jung 1961).They were concerned with both the creation of the higher man and theperfection of nature. In a 1952 interview at the Eranos conference, Jungstated that “The alchemical operations were real, only this reality wasnot physical but psychological. Alchemy represents the projection of adrama both cosmic and spiritual in laboratory terms. The opus mag-numhad two aims: the rescue of the human soul and the salvation of"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the cosmos.”1This move brought alchemy into the realm of contem-porary thought and was the beginning of a sustained psychology ofalchemy.To see alchemy in this way—as a psychological and symbolic art—was a major breakthrough for Jung and a key to unlocking its mysteries.The exploration and development of this insight led Jung eventually tosee in alchemy a fundamental source, background, and confirmationof his psychology of the unconscious. His imagination was capturedby the ideas and metaphors of alchemy, with its dragons, sufferingmatter, peacock’s tail, alembics, athanors, red and green lions, kingsand queens, fishes’ eyes, inverted philosophical trees, salamanders andhermaphrodites, black suns and white earth, metals (lead, silver, andgold), colors (black, white, yellow, and red), distillations and coagula-tions, and a rich array of Latin terms. All of these images are, for Jung,the best possible expression of a psychic mystery that enunciated andamplified his maturing vision of the parallels between alchemy and hisown psychology of the unconscious. Jung sees all of these as projectedby the alchemists into matter. Their effort was to bring about unityfrom the disparate parts of the psyche, creating a “chemical wedding.”Jung saw as the moral task of alchemy the unification of the disparateelements of the soul, symbolically represented as the creation of thelapis, or philosopher’s stone. Likewise, Jung’s psychology works withthe conflicts and dissociation of psychic life and attempts to bringabout the mysterious “unification” he calls Wholeness.In C. G. Jung Speaking,Jung describes the alchemical process as “dif-ficult and strewn with obstacles; the alchemical opus is dangerous.Right at the beginning you meet the ‘dragon,’ the chthonic spirit, the‘devil’ or, as the alchemists called it, the ‘blackness,’ the nigredo, andthis encounter produces suffering.”2He goes on to say that in “psycho-logical terms, the soul finds itself in the throes of melancholy locked in a struggle with the ‘shadow.’” The black sun, Sol niger, is one of themost important images representing this phase of the process and thiscondition of the soul. Usually this image is seen as phase specific to the early part of the opus and is said to disappear “when the ‘dawn’(aurora) emerges.” Typically blackness is said to dissolve, and then “the ‘devil’ no longer has an autonomous existence but rejoins the pro-(10)Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"found unity of the psyche. Then the opus magnum is finished: the hu-man soul is [said to be] completely integrated.”3In my experience, this is an idealized goal of alchemy, and there is adanger in bypassing the autonomous core of darkness that always re-mains as an earmark of the condition of any humanness. Thus, my ap-proach to the image of the black sun pauses with the blackness itselfand examines it in its own right, not simply as a stage in the develop-ment of the soul. As such we see that blackness itself proves to containin its own realm the gold we seek in our attempts to transcend it. Thisfocus contributes to a new appreciation of the darkness within.Jung’s exploration was influenced by the seventeenth-century al-chemist Mylius, who refers to the ancient philosophers as the source ofour knowledge about Sol niger. In several places in his collected works,Jung writes of Sol niger as a powerful and important image of the un-conscious. To consider the image in the context of the unconscious isboth to recognize its vastness and unknown quality as well as to place itin the historical context of depth psychology and of the psyche’s at-tempt to represent the unrepresentable. Imagining Sol niger in this wayis to see it in its most general sense, but Jung has also extracted from thealchemical literature a rich and complex, if scattered, phenomenologyof the image. The black sun, blackness, putrefactio, mortificatio,the ni-gredo,poisoning, torture, killing, decomposition, rotting, and death allform a web of interrelationships that describe a terrifying, if most oftenprovisional, eclipse of consciousness or of our conscious standpoint.The nigredo, the initial black stage of the alchemical opus, has beenconsidered the most negative and difficult operation in alchemy. It isalso one of the most numinous, but few authors other than Jung haveexplored the theme in its many facets. In addition to the aspects justdescribed, Jung also finds in this image of blackness a nonmanifest la-tency, a shadow of the sun, as well as an Other Sun, linked to both Sat-urn and Yahweh, the primus anthropos.For the most part, Sol niger isequated with and understood only in its nigredo aspect, while its moresublime dimension—its shine, its dark illumination, its Eros and wis-dom—remains in the unconscious.I imagine my work on the black sun as an experiment in alchemicalpsychology. It is concerned with this difficult and enigmatic image andThe Dark Side of Light(11)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"with our understanding of darkness. My contention is that darknesshistorically has not been treated hospitably and that it has remained inthe unconscious and become a metaphor for it. It has been seen pri-marily in its negative aspect and as a secondary phenomenon, itselfconstituting a shadow—something to integrate, to move through andbeyond. In so doing, its intrinsic importance is often passed over. Thisattitude has also been perpetuated in alchemy, which places darknessat the beginning of the work and sees it primarily in terms of the ni-gredo. Yet in its usage of the black sun there is a hint of a darkness thatshines. It is this shine of the paradoxical image that captures my atten-tion. How is it possible to imagine a darkness filled with light or a shinethat contains the qualities of both light and darkness?Jung has noted that darkness “has its own peculiar intellect and itsown logic which should be taken very seriously,” and it is my intent togive darkness its due—not to rush beyond it but to enter its realm tolearn more about its mysteries.4To turn toward darkness in this way isan odd reversal of our ordinary propensity. To more fully understandthe turn toward darkness it is first important to pause and considerhow much the historical primacy of light has infused our understand-ing of consciousness itself.The image of light and its corresponding metaphor of the sun arefundamentally intertwined with the history of consciousness. Ourlanguage demonstrates the pervasiveness of these images, and it is dif-ficult to envision a way of thinking that does not rely on them. In myth,science, philosophy, religion, and alchemy we find these metaphorswidely disseminated. Our language is filled with metaphors of illumi-nation: to bring to light, to make clear, to enlighten, and so on, all servein these and in many other contexts.In Memories, Dreams, ReflectionsJung seems to have capturedsomething of the primordial experience that must have been genera-tive in the development of sun worship. While visiting the Elgonyi tribeof Africa, Jung writes, “the sunrise in these latitudes was a phenome-non that overwhelmed me anew every day.”5He goes on to describe hisobservations a little before dawn, when he was in the habit of watchingthe sunrise:(12)Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"At first, the contrasts between light and darkness would be ex-tremely sharp. Then objects would assume contour and emergeinto the light which seemed to fill the valley with a compactbrightness. The horizon above became radiantly white. Gradu-ally the swelling light seemed to penetrate into the very structureof objects, which became illuminated from within until at lastthey shone translucently, like bits of colored glass. Everythingturned to flaming crystal. The cry of the bell bird rang aroundthe horizon. At such moments I felt as if I were inside a temple.It was the most sacred hour of the day. I drank in this glory withinsatiable delight, or rather in a timeless ecstasy.6Jung goes on to say that “for untold ages men have worshiped thegreat god who redeems the world by rising out of darkness as a radiantlight in the heavens. At the time, I understood that within the soulfrom its primordial beginnings there has been a desire for light and anirrepressible urge to rise out of the primal darkness.”7Against thisbackground it is evident to Jung why for the Elgonyi “the momentinwhich the light comes isGod.”8Jung recognizes the importance of the sun and light in his alchem-ical writings, where he states that the soul is “an eye destined to beholdthe light.”9Likewise, James Hillman, a Jungian analyst as well as thefounder of archetypal psychology, wonders whether the “human eyeprefers light to darkness” and whether human beings are “heliotropic,fundamentally adapted to light.”10The power of this image is also rec-ognized by the postmodern philosopher Jacques Derrida, who com-ments, “each time there is a metaphor, there is doubtless a sun some-where, but each time there is a sun, metaphor has begun.”11The importance of the sun metaphor is further traced by Mircea Eli-ade, historian and scholar of religion, who finds a parallel between sunworship and the spread of civilization and kings. Eliade documents thepredominance of sun religions: “Where history is on the march thanksto kings, heroes or empires, the sun is supreme.”12The sun’s majesty lentits power to the signification of the person and the office of the king.Both the Sun and the King archetypes are highly complex, archetypalThe Dark Side of Light(13)"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"images with multiple meanings. This theme has been extensively stud-ied by Jungian analyst John Perry in his Lord of the Four Quarters: Mythof the Royal Father;Jungian analyst Robert Moore, and mythologist andtherapist Douglas Gillette in The King Within; and more recently as thearchetype of renewal in Psychological Reflections on the Aging, Death,and Rebirth of the Kingby Jungian analyst Stephenson Bond.The sun has traditionally been associated with masculine attributesin patriarchal culture, but this attribution has been relativized anddestabilized by studies such as Janet McCritchard’s Eclipse of the Sun,which demonstrates a wide range of feminine attributes to the sunacross time and culture.13Still, with regard to the “masculine” psyche,the sun, particularly in relation to the king, has been considered a rep-resentation of God on earth. Kings were considered sacred. Figure 1.1shows an image of King Sol on his throne.In general, the Sun King reflects a dominant force of historical, cul-tural, and psychic reality. As an inner figure, he is fundamental to lifeand a well-functioning psyche. There is a long tradition of the King andthe Sun reflecting the qualities of rational order, stability, life force, vi-tality, blessing, joy, and light. The Sun and the King light up the world.The work of Moore and Gillette argues that the inner King as an ex-pression of mature masculinity should not be equated with the abusesof patriarchy and power and with the shadow of the King as Tyrant. Asarchetypal principles, the Sun and the King are not in themselves de-structive or problematic to culture or the psychic life of people. On thecontrary, as noted earlier, they enhance life and are essential to psyche.The problem begins when these archetypal forces overwhelm a devel-oping or immature ego, inflating and corrupting it. When the ego iden-tifies with the transpersonal power of the King and the ego becomesKing, the Tyrant is near, and the King’s energy can be devouring (cf.figure 1.2). In short, the King and the Tyrant are brothers in the arche-typal psyche.The devouring and oppressive shadow side of the King’s energy hasbeen linked in our time to patriarchy and to the one-sided Apollonianvision that has laid the groundwork for an angry critique of our psy-chological and cultural attitudes. If the Sun has led our way into thepresent, with all of the advances that have come with it, it has also led(14)Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"to a massive repression and devaluation of the dark side of psychic life.“There are as many ways to be lost in the light as in the dark,” says story-teller and poet Madronna Holden, who recognizes the peril that oc-curs when light loses touch with the principle of darkness.14On thecultural level we all too often have become lost in our spiritual, Apol-lonian, patriarchal, male perspective. Our roots in European languagesand a Cartesian worldview have led to a personal and cultural elitismthat have fueled charges of racism and colonialism. To the extent thatthese judgments have validity, they reflect a collective, cultural, andphilosophical shadow. Has the light the eye was “destined to behold”displayed a blind spot with regard to vision itself ?Moore and Gillette have observed that, when the King sits on hisThe Dark Side of Light(15)Figure 1.1.

It createsa totality that rejects interruption and refuses the other from within itsnarcissistic enclosure.For a number of philosophers—Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, andothers—there is a dangerous tendency in modernity toward closureand tautological reductionism: “totalization, normalization and dom-ination.”16Levin has noted that behind our Western visionary tradi-tion lies the shadow of phallocentrism, logocentrism, and a “helio-politics” driven by the violence of Light. To put it more simply, theconcern about modernity is that it is governed by male desire andpower and by an egocentric rationality that serves political agendas(16)Chapter 1Figure 1.2. The king devouring his subject, 1625. From Johannes Fabricius, Alchemy: The Medieval Alchemists and Their Royal Art,p. 75."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"that conceal intrinsic violence. In his work Writing and Difference,Derrida speaks of the violence of Light and the imperialism of theoryassociated with it. He notes that this kind of violence also troubled thephilosopher Emmanuel Levinas, whose work was aimed at developingan ethical theory freed as much as possible from the violence implicitin Western metaphysical thinking.17If one agrees with the philoso-phers and critics of our tradition, one might imagine our time as onelocked into the tyrannical shadow of a Sun King who bears withinhimself the seeds of his own destruction.Is it possible to imagine this situation as rooted in an unconsciousidentification with the King and the Light? If so, such unconsciousidentification colors the psyche and has important personal and cul-tural consequences.On the most personal level, analysts have approached such con-cerns not so much philosophically but as they manifest themselves inclinical situations. In The Anatomy of the Psyche,Jungian analyst Ed-ward Edinger, for instance, cites the expressions of unconscious kinglyinflations in “outbursts of affect, resentment, pleasure or power de-mands.”18The refinement of these affects is difficult. As an inner figure,the primitive King/ego must undergo a transformation not only in our culture but also in the lives of people. Alchemy recognizes this fact when it sees that the King is at the beginning—the raw matter ofthe philosopher’s stone—and that he must be purified and refined byundergoing a series of alchemical processes, eventually dying and be-ing reborn.In alchemy, the process of dying, killing, and blackening is part of theoperation of mortificatio. This operation is a necessary component ofthe transformative process of the King and other images of the primamateria such as the Sun, the Dragon, the Toad, and the condition of in-nocence. Edinger devotes a chapter of The Anatomy of the Psycheto thisprocess. The mortificatio process was often thought of as tortuous andas the “most negative operation in alchemy.”19“It has to do with dark-ness, defeat, torture, mutilation, death and rotting. The process of rot-ting is called putrefactio,the decomposition that breaks down organicbodies.”20Edinger has schematized and charted this operation reproduced inThe Dark Side of Light(17)"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"figure 1.3, an example of what he calls “cluster thinking”—thinkingthat is concerned with elaborating a network of expanded meaningsderived from a central image.

The ul-timate goal of the king’s mortification is purification, death, and trans-formation. This process is signified by a series of alchemical imagesthat have been reproduced by Jung, Edinger, Von Franz, and others.These powerful and complex images lend themselves to multipleinterpretations but generally seem to reflect the many aspects of themortification process necessary for alchemical transformation. Thesubjects to be transformed are often represented by an old king, adragon, a toad, or the sun in the process of being wounded or killed byclub, sword, or poison; drowned; or devoured. The phenomenology ofthis process aims to displace or alter the old dominant function of theconscious ego or the underdeveloped, instinctual state of the uncon-scious psyche. It is a wounding or death that prepares the primitive selffor fundamental change.In the “Death of the King” from Stolcius, we see the king sitting onhis throne.22Te n figures are uniformly lined up behind him preparingto club him to death. In another graphic titled “Sol and Luna Kill theDragon,” Sol and Luna likewise are about to club a dragon.23As noted,this creature is often a “personification of the instinctual psyche.”24The struggle with the unconscious is also portrayed in the Book ofLambspring,where a warrior with sword in hand encounters a dragonwhose head he must cut off. A verse describing this image states:Here you straightaway beholdA black beast in the forest,Whose skin is of blackest dye, if anyMan cuts offhis head. His blacknessWill disappear.25Dealing with the dragon requires both a slaying of and an incisive en-gagement with the instinctual ground of the psyche.Figure 1.4 is from the Dance of Deathby Hans Holbein.

Ina well-known graphic (color plate 1), Sol is wounded by the bite of thegreen lion, his blood flowing to the Earth as he is slowly devoured. There have been many alchemical commentaries on color plate 1.The devouring aspect of the lion is represented in this emblem, whichwas first attached to a sixteenth-century manuscript of the RosariumPhilosophorum.28It shows the lion devouring the sun, with the bloodof the lion issuing from its mouth. Abraham equates the sun with thealchemists’ raw stuff, “‘gold,’ which is devoured and dissolved in orderto obtain the ‘sperm’ of gold, the living seed from which pure gold canbe grown.”29The idea is that the raw solar energy must darken and undergo amortificatio process that reduces it to its prime matter. Only then canthe creative energies produce a purified product. In this image thesperm of gold refers not to the ordinary seminal fluid of man butrather to “a semi-material principle,” or aura seminales,the fertile po-tentiality that prepares the Sun for the sacred marriage with his coun-terpart, darkness, which is thought to produce a philosophical childorstone and is nourished by the mercurial blood that flows from thewounding encounter of the Lion and the Sun.30The blood—called redmercury—is considered a great solvent.Psychologically, there is nourishment in wounding. When psycho-logical blood flows, it can dissolve hardened defenses. This then can bethe beginning of true productivity. In dreams the imagery of blood of-ten connotes moments when real feeling and change are possible. Thetheme of the wound can also suggest a hidden innocence, which is alsoa subject of mortification. The green color of the lion, which is referredto as “green gold,” suggests something that is immature, unripe, or in-nocent, as well as growth and fertility.The alchemist imagined this innocence, sometimes called virgin’smilk, as a primary condition, something without Earth and not yetblackened. Typical virgin-milk fantasies are often maintained emotion-ally in otherwise intellectually sophisticated and developed people. Un-consciously held ideas might include sentiments such as “Life should be(22)Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"fair,” “God will protect and care for me like a good parent,” “Bad thingswon’t happen to me because I have lived according to this or that prin-ciple,” “I have been good or faithful, eat healthy foods, and exercise,”and so on. When life does not confirm such ideas, the innocent, weak,or immature ego is wounded and often overcome with feelings of hurt,self-pity, oppression, assault, and/or victimization.The injured ego can carry this wounding in many ways. The dark-ening process can lead to a kind of blindness and dangerous stasis ofthe soul that then becomes locked in a wound, in hurt or rage, frozenin stone or ice, or fixed in fire. From the alchemical point of view, theseinnocent attitudes must undergo this mortificatio process—and in-nocent attitudes await the necessary work of alchemy. Hillman notesthat the blackening begins in “scorching, hurting, cursing, rotting theinnocence of soul and corrupting and depressing it into the nigredo,which we recognize by its stench [a mind lost in introspection about]its materialistic causes for what went wrong.”31Looking for what went wrong is often looking in the wrong place.What is not seen by the wounded soul is that what is happening underthe surface and in the blackening process is a dying of immature inno-cence—a nigredo that holds a transformative possibility and an expe-rience that opens the dark eye of the soul. As Edinger puts it, the soul“enters the gate of blackness.”32Jung refers to the descent into darknessas nekyia.In Psychology and Alchemy,Jung uses this Greek word to des-ignate a “‘journey to Hades,’ a descent into the land of the dead.”33Mythically, as is the case throughout Jungian literature, there are manyexamples of such journeys. Jung mentions Dante’s Divine Comedy,which Dante starts with a statement of the nigredo experience. Hewrites:Midway upon the journey of our lifeI found that I was in a dusky wood;For the right path, whence I had strayed, was lost.Ah me! How hard a thing it is to tellThe wildness of that rough and savage place,The very thought of which brings back my fear!So bitter was it, death is little more so.34The Dark Side of Light(23)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Jung also notes the classic Walpurgisnacht in Goethe’s Faustandapocryphal accounts of Christ’s descent into hell.

Eliot’s “The Wasteland.” His own con-tributions to this theme are in his study of Melville’s Moby Dick,whichhe subtitles An American Nekyiaand which he refers to as an Amer-ican Faust.35Additional parallels are cited by Sylvia Perera, who notesthe Japanese Izanami, the Greek Kore-Persephone, the Roman Psyche,and the fairy tale heroines who go to Mother Hulda or Baba Yaga. InDescent to the Goddess,her own work, she studies the theme from theperspective of the initiation of women and takes up the Sumerian storyof Inanna and Ereshkigal, the Dark Goddess. One could go on citingnumerous examples throughout history and across cultures. As Edingernotes, “the theme has no national or racial boundaries. It is foundeverywhere because it refers to an innate, necessary psychic movement(24)Chapter 1Figure 1.6. Leaden depression of a Benedictine suffering death in a valley of fadingstars.

The artist Ad Reinhardt pointed out that we have a naturaltendency to rush away from such experiences, yet he encouraged us in-stead to “wait a minute,” to hold fast—because looking into blacknessrequires a period of adjustment. The reward for staying is available tothose who have faith enough to withstand “infinite duration.”2Staying with the darkness allows something to happen that escapesus if we are hasty. If we resist our natural tendency to take flight beforepainful experiences, we can descend into the dark aspects of the un-conscious, which is necessary if we are to make contact with whatGoethe calls “infinite nature.”3Turning toward such darkness requiresa willingness to stay with suffering and to make a descent into the un-conscious.Goethe’s great work, Faust,was essential to Jung, who once said that“one cannot meditate enough about Faust.”4Edinger also remarkedthat this work is of “major importance for the psychological under-standing of modern man.”5For Jung, Goethe was in the grip of a de-scent, an archetypal process, a process also alive and active within him"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"as a living substance, the great dream of the mundus archetypus,the ar-chetypal world.

The movement up and out seems to have a uni-versal quality. In the Feast of Icarus,Sam Hazo writes:The poet imitates Icarus. He is inspired to dare impossibilityeven if this means that he might and possibly will fail in the at-tempt. His fate is to try to find silence’s tongue, to say what is be-yond saying, to mint from the air he breathes an alphabet thatcaptivates like music. His victory, if it comes at all, must of ne-cessity be a victory of the instant, a lyric split second of triumph,quick as a kiss.10Hazo’s study of Icarus values the necessity of flight—if a soul is to ahave a vibrant and creative life. It is important as an analyst to learnhow to support such pneumatic and spiritual ascents, to know boththe value of the puerspirit, while at the same time being aware of thedangers of inflation. Like a moth drawn to a flame, our Icarian soulsare in peril when in our aspirations we forget our bodies on Earth andthe call to an integrated life. For analysts, if not for poets, the “quickkiss” must be linked to a more stable relationship to our transcendentpossibilities, so that our eyes are also fixed on waxen wings and on thedanger of burnt souls and black holes.We have had the benefit of the myths of Phaethon, Ixion, Beller-ephon, and Icarus to remind us of the dangerous side of flying too highand too close to the sun, of becoming the prey of Poseidon. The prob-lem for Icarus is not that he wishes to fly (for that is a natural andhealthy emanation of our constitutional potential) but that there is animportant difference between a grounded bodily imagination and adefensive or naive Gnostic flight that leaves the body and the darknessbehind.Analysts on the whole have learned to look at “flight” and “spirit”with Brueghel’s eye rather than that of Ovid. In the Metamorphoses,Ovid describes “the amazement of a fisherman, a shepherd and aploughman when they saw Daedalus and Icarus flying through the sky,(32)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"an event that was interpreted as an epiphany of the gods.”11This amaze-ment is illustrated in the Fall of Icarusby Petrus Stevens and Joos deMomper.Pieter Brueghel, on the other hand, in his “Landscape with the Fallof Icarus” (1558, Royal Museum of Brussels), “inverted Ovid’s theme of placing the emphasis on the humble peasants who continue theirlabor without even a glance at the sky, or at Icarus, the latter reducedto an insignificant figure that had fallen into the sea.”12For analysts to identify with either one of these perspectives has cyclopean conse-quences; it is important to look with two eyes, to see through the per-spectives of both Ovid and Brueghel with an eye to epiphany and toearth-sea, or we ourselves are lost in one-sidedness.My patient’s desire to leave Earth may well have been spiritually mo-tivated, but, if so, it was also a flight from the pain associated with theimage of the borderline schizophrenic girl, a pathologized image of psy-chological distress. One might imagine the psyche saying to her, “Turntoward this figure of darkness that clings to you. That is your guide.”This turning was not imaginable, and her pneumatic dream ego wasdriven with a single intent: to go skyward, sunward. Confronting thisdirection was the wind-spirit which blew her back to Earth and for themoment gently grounded her.In alchemy, it is important that the pneumatic spirit remain in con-nection to Earth as imaged in Stolcius’s Viridarium Chymicum.In fig-ure 2.3, the high-flying bird is linked to the small, slow-moving crea-ture of the Earth, which keeps the spirit from flying away.13When the link to the Earth is not honored, grounding may emergeunconsciously and harshly. I cannot say whether what followed was inany way actually related to the neglect of the dark side of the psyche orwas a part of her biological and spiritual destiny, but as our work con-tinued we encountered a most destructive side of the Sol niger image.In an analytic session my patient reported that she felt something omi-nous in her chest. She described it as a dark ball that had long strandsreaching throughout her body. Her inclination was to reach down andpull it up. Between sessions, in an active imagination she drew the im-age that she felt was lodged in her chest. It was a brilliant sun with adense black center and long, fibrous tentacles (color plate 3).The Descent into Darkness(33)"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"After drawing it, she felt the image was not menacing enough andfelt a need to draw it again.

The long, black fibers remained, and there weremany circular black shapes that my patient described with horror as anexplosion of dead, skeletal embryos (figure 2.4).It was as if she had brought to the surface a compressed and explod-ing black sun that seemed to prefigure her ability to verbalize painfulmemories of her unassimilable distress and the madness of her suicidalfeelings. In spite of this retrieval and the process that it initiated, the im-age, like a devouring demon, did not subside. Shortly afterward, she re-ported a dream in which she felt a nuclear war was inevitable. Whilegrappling with these images, she suffered an aneurism of the anteriorregion of her brain and came close to death. She lost sight in one eye but(34)Chapter 2Figure 2.3.

I could not help but feel some connection between the imageof the black sun and the medical incident, which almost cost her her lifeand led to partial blindness. This led me to wonder whether there wereany documented incidents of a similar kind.In researching the analytic literature, I came across the case ofRobert, published by the Australian analyst Giles Clarke in Harvest(1983). His article is titled “A Black Hole in Psyche.” In it he describesthe case of Robert, a twenty-nine-year-old man who was strugglingwith something that seemed impossible to integrate or explain in termsof conventional, psychodynamic theories. Clarke describes a dream ofRobert’s in which there is an image of a black hole into which the wholeworld disappears. Astronomically, a black hole is a sun or star that hascollapsed in on itself, creating a vacuum that sucks all matter into it-self, a “scientific vision” of Sol niger. For Clarke, the psychology of theblack hole is connected to the failure of psychic life and to somethingthat is an inassimilable and intolerable object of anxiety and dread.14He connects it with a kind of chronic, psychic atrophy that can some-times be literally fatal.Robert’s dream was followed by a series of disturbing images anddebilitating physical symptoms. Clarke reports images of a “stillbornbaby,” a “mutant or monster birth,” abortions, and a “miscarriage.”15Robert “developed migraines, his eyesight suffered, his sense of tasteand smell atrophied, and his legs tingled and ached.”16Finally Robertbecame seriously ill and died of cancer.Another encounter with the black sun is found in Ronald Laing’sbook The Divided Self,where he speaks of the emergence of the blacksun in his treatment of Julie, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia.On the one hand, Julie imagined herself to be any one of a large num-ber of famous personalities, but inwardly she had no freedom, auton-omy, or power in the “real world.” Since she could be anyone she caredto mention, she was no one. She was “terrified by life.... [L]ife wouldmash her to a pulp, burn her heart with a red hot iron, cut offher legs,hands, tongue, breasts.” Life was conceived in the most violent andfiercely destructive terms imaginable. She stated that she was “bornunder a black sun,” and the things that lived in her were wild beasts and(36)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"rats that infested and ruined her inner city.17Julie’s imagery is ampli-fied in Von Franz’s description of Sol niger as the destructive side of theSun god, reminding us that Apollo is the god not only of the Sun butalso of mice, rats, and wolves and that the dark side of the Sun is de-monic and his rays burn life to death. He is a god without justice andbrings death to the living.Laing goes on to note that this ancient and very sinister image of theblack sun arose, for Julie, quite independently of any reading; still, shedescribed the way the rays of the black sun scorched and shriveled her,and under the black sun she existed as a dead thing. Her existence thenwas depicted in images of utterly barren, arid dissolution. This existen-tial death, this death-in-life, was her prevailing mode of being in theworld.19In this death there was no hope, no future, no possibility. Ev-erything had already happened. There was no pleasure, no source of pos-sible satisfaction, for the world was as empty and as dead as she was.In Alchemy,von Franz writes about the shadow side of the Sun as de-structive, unjust, and demonic. She refers to that aspect of Sol nigerwhere the Sun is so hot that it destroys all plants. She recalls a story fromIndochina that relates that a too-hot sun was shot at dawn by a herofigure linked to Saturn. For von Franz, the shadow of the Sun as “a Sunwithout justice, which is death for the living,” reflects “a wrongly func-tioning consciousness” that rejects the dark side of God.18She states, “Ifconsciousness works according to nature, the blackness is not so blackor so destructive, but if the Sun stands still, it is stiffened, and burns lifeto death.” When the psyche loses its natural rhythm and fixates intocomplexes, the unconscious becomes destructive.This version of the black sun appeared in my long-term analysis ofa Catholic priest. There had been significant progress in his analysis ofa serious depression and ongoing suicidal desires, and he was for themost part functioning well with the exception of what seemed to be achronic and deadly complex that still occurred regularly. In these mo-ments he felt he was in a “black hole.” He closed offthe larger sense ofhis life and wanted to die. His heretofore rational sensibilities seemedto be growing delusional. He felt that his skin was too fair for him toreally enjoy life and reported that he couldn’t go out in the sun likeThe Descent into Darkness(37)"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"ordinary people. For him, the Sun was vindictive, and there was a longseries of dreams in which the Sun burnt him severely.My patient recounted a dream:I was out resting in the sun for what I thought was not a longtime. While I was there, the warmth penetrating my skin and mybones did feel good. Next I was showering and I could barelytouch my skin at all. I looked with a sense of alarm, noticing thatmy skin was very red over every square inch. I did not know howthat happened, except that the burn was thorough. My skin wasfiery red and hot to touch, burned so badly that I could barelytouch it. I would be in for a severe amount of pain and did notknow what I was going to do.In this dream, my patient thought of the sun as a hostile force, notunlike that portrayed by William Blake’s painting in which it is “an an-gry, blood-red orb, unleashing its fury on an oppressed humanity”20(figure 2.5).In this ongoing analysis, my patient and I were able to unpack aconsiderable amount of meaning related to this symptom/symbol/image of the vengeful sun, including a significant father complex, hisburning self-judgment, and the scorching demands of his perfectionis-tic expectations. We also discussed the idea of the Self as burning up hisinflations and threatening his ego stance, making it painful even tomove.This work proved valuable. Over the years there were periods dur-ing which the Sun had become gentle, warming, and positive, and hisskin had nicely tanned, integrating some of the darkness. In my judg-ment he was a priest who had come to terms with a good portion ofshadow material, both personal and collective. But, in spite of this, hishostile Sun continued to return.After one of our sessions, my patient wrote the following reflectionin which he was trying to communicate his frustrations and the re-lentlessness of what he came to call his “skin barrier.” He compared itto his work in scripture and to a “stubborn text,” one that just will notgo away:(38)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"It defies interpretation that satisfies me. My wish is to expungethe text but I cannot. I have no choice. The text confronts me andI have to deal with it. I often hate the text! I wish it had never beenwritten. Yet I have to deal with it. My skin refrain is my stubborntext. I insist on bringing it up and coming back to it, because Iam not satisfied with any interpretation. We have not yet comeup with something I can live with. It is at this crucial momentthat I say you can do nothing for me. I lose confidence in ourwork to solve this problem.For my patient, whatever had been accomplished did not go farenough. He was ready to stop our work “unless we deal with my stub-born skin text so that I may live.” Our capacity to relate to what trulybecame a threatening demon was tentative at best; it spoiled his life,and his world became ever darker and more depressed. He stated that“life stinks” and that “the Sun” continued to burn him. Since he feltthere was no reason to live, death was the only thing that was real.The Descent into Darkness(39)Figure 2.5.

Alchemically, the heat is turned up toohigh, and the ego’s skin is burnt, blackened, or tortured with stingingcriticism, producing shame and threatening bodily integrity. Hillmandescribes a similar process of mortification—when the ego feelstrapped or nailed down. It is a time of symptoms and the “grindingsadistic mortifications of shame.”21In figure 2.6, similar feelings are expressed at a point in analysis inwhich a woman was reexperiencing deep feelings of shame. She hadlived “a sheltered childhood” and described “much censorship,” “feel-ing constantly embarrassed,” and inferior. The faces of masculine reli-(40)Chapter 2Figure 2.6.

On the far right, afigure holds up the monstrance, which appears traditionally as a sun-burst. The monstrance is a utensil that is used to contain the presenceof the consecrated Host, which is believed to be the living divinity, theSun reflecting the transformed image of the God-man.Matthew 17:2 says, “and he was transformed before them and hisface shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light.” Forour dreamer, the brightness of the monstrance had turned monstrous,both words—monstrance and monstrous—sharing the same root,and was used to shame and attack her, functioning rather as a Sol niger,creating shame. The attack of her accusers was also a phallic probingabout to goose her (note the cross behind her).Another image of the destructive aspect of Sol niger can be seen inthe life of the poet Harry Crosby. The poet’s life is in his diaries, titledShadows of the Sun, and in Wolff ’s biography of him, entitled The BlackSun: The Brief Transit and Violent Eclipse of Harry Crosby.Crosby is de-scribed as a handsome, wealthy aristocrat who with his wife, Caresse,scandalized Boston society. Caresse divorced her first husband, RichardPeabody, nephew of the legendary headmaster of Groton, to marryHarry. Together, they founded the Black Sun Pressin Paris, which pub-lished exquisite editions of the works of Lawrence, Crane, Pound,Proust and others.22One of Harry’s romances is portrayed by EdwardGermain in his introduction toShadows of the Sun.There, Germainsuggests it is almost impossible not to read these diaries as a poet’s eight-year romance with death, consummated late in the afternoon ofTuesday, December 10, 1929, in a borrowed New York apartmentin the Hotel des Aristes. Harry Crosby and one of his mistressestook offtheir shoes and lay on a bed together fully clothed. ThenHarry pressed a .25 caliber Belgian automatic pistol to JosephineRotch Bigelow’s left temple and blew her head apart. For twohours Harry may have lain alive beside her with his arm beneathThe Descent into Darkness(41)"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"her head. Then he pointed the pistol at his own forehead andpulled the trigger.23For our purposes, one of the remarkable connections to our themeis Harry’s obsession with the sun, which is evident in his work titledChariot of the Sun.Some of the titles of his poems are “Quatrains of theSun,” “Sun Rhapsody,” “Angels of the Sun,” “Sundrench and Sons,”Sun-Ghost,” and “Suns in Distress.” Many of these verses are obsessedwith death, and one might imagine with Crosby’s biographer GeoffreyWo lffthat “the sun had truly struck Harry down, inspired him andblinded him too.”24One of the most poignant images of Harry’s obsession with the Sunis portrayed in his poem “Photoheliograph.” Here one finds the Sun inthe midst of blackness:black black black black blackblack black black black blackblack black black black blackblack black black black blackblack black sunblack blackblack black black black blackblack black black black blackblack black black black blackblack black black black blackblack black black black black25Wo lffis aware that “the black sun was no invention of Harry’s,” andhe equates it with the Sol nigerof the alchemists, “prime matter, theunconscious in its unworked, base state.”26What Germain suggeststhat Harry sought but was unable to find, was the need, like the Sun, toresurrect beyond his own sunset, a project filled with paradox and am-biguity. He notes:[T]he sun that gave sea, soil, and life also stared down withoutpity on its creations and withered them, dried them out, burnt(42)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"them, failed to shine, winking while life failed. Where the sun is,there also find the death principle, the chaos that reigned beforelight dispelled it, the chaos that Harry’s life and work replicatedin miniature.27Harry Crosby was not the only poet to struggle with Sol niger. In herwork titled The Black Sun: Depression and Melancholy,Julia Kristeva, aFrench linguist and Lacanian psychoanalyst, writes about the poetGerard de Nerval and his poem “El Desdichado,” or “The Disinher-ited” (1859). Kristeva believes the poem was written in a fit of madnessin an attempt to overcome a sense of deprivation and darkness. Itseems that Kristeva may even have derived the title of her book from achilling stanza in Nerval’s poem that contains the image of Sol niger.The stanza reads as follows:I am saturnine—bereft—disconsolate,The Prince of Aquitaine whose tower has crumbled:My lone staris dead—and my bespangled luteBears the Black sun of Melancholia28Nerval’s poem most likely is his response to the loss of a loved one:“My lone star is dead.” For Nerval, the loss of this figure is the loss of thelight of his life, without whom he is bereft and his world collapsed; his“Tower has crumbled,” as it were, into the “Black Sun of Melancholia.”For Kristeva, the “Black sun” is a “dazzling metaphor,” an imaginedsun, “bright and black at the same time,” a “Thing” that is cherished inthe absence of the loved one and marks an impenetrable loss.29Tr adi-tionally, it is thought that what is lost in ordinary mourning is eventu-ally let go in the grieving process, the result of which is to hold what islost in memory or, according to Kristeva, in symbolic language.However, some people who cannot let go and who deny the loss cre-ate a situation of impossible mourning and a fundamental sadness towhich they become attached. For Kristeva, such a situation can expressitself as an attachment to a dark sun buried in a crypt of inexpressiblesaturnine affect. This kind of inner presence is really an absence, a lightThe Descent into Darkness(43)"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"without representation, a sadness that is “the most archaic expressionof an unsymbolizable, unnameable narcissistic wound” that becomesthe depressed person’s “sole object” of attachment.30Throughout this process of mislaid grief, the relationship to a lovedone is transformed into an attachment to an inexpressible affect, cryp-tically incorporated. This affect takes the place of the other; its numi-nous quality is held on to with mystical adherence. Thus, ultimately,for Kristeva, the black sun is such a “Thing,” a mark of pathologicalmourning, whose brightness seems to sum up the “blinding force of adespondent mood.”31Kristeva is aware of the alchemical associations with Sol niger andsituates Nerval’s melancholia and the black sun in the context of the al-chemical nigredo, which “asserts the inevitability of death” and which,in this case, “is the death of the loved one and of the self that identifieswith the former.”32For Kristeva, Nerval was a “tireless wanderer” who, after a “fit ofmadness... withdrew for a while into the crypt of a past that hauntedhim.”33His world was filled with “graves” and “skeletons” and “floodedwith irruptions of death.”34It was in such a context, says Kristeva, thatNerval wrote The Disinherited.Kristeva calls Nerval’s poem his “Noah’sark,” albeit a temporary one—temporary because Nerval appears tohave committed suicide.35At dawn on the January 26, 1955, Nerval wasfound hanging in the Rue de la Vieille-Lanterre.In Kristeva’s analysis, though Sol niger may have served to inspireNerval’s creative process, it ultimately signifies massive repression anddeath. For Nerval, the harshness of Saturn foreclosed human life andlinked the god to the literal death aspect of the black sun and to his roleas Ogre and the terrible father.This aspect of Sol niger—destruction as the inevitable outcome ofcreation—may have been at the origin of the myth of Saturn devour-ing his children as soon as Rhea gave birth to them. In the painting Sat-urn and His Childrenby Marten van Heemskerck, Saturn is portrayedas beginning to devour his children, a process that has been linked tomelancholia, which is written on the image next to Saturn. His color issaid to be black and is also associated with winter, night, death, anddistance.36(44)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Plate 1. The green lion devouring the sun.

At times Saturn is a great teacher,as was the case with a man who, approaching midlife, was concernedabout “time passing,” “growing older,” and ultimately with “death”(figure 2.7).A former patient in my practice illustrates some of these themes.The patient had just turned forty and was struggling with what wehave come to call midlife issues, including a confrontation with illness,aging parents, and the loss of a loved one. These conflicts preceded thefollowing dream:I’m in an open space. The ground is a tawny color, and there is alarge, very dark circle many feet, perhaps forty or so, in diame-ter. It is uniformly dark (like the skin of an African) with barelyvisible concentric bands that radiate from the center. Many tallAfrican men appear with staffs. They are so coal black that theyalmost have a bluish sheen. I get a staff, too, and find that we aregoing to do some type of dance around this circle. There is oneother white man, and neither of us is familiar with this dance sowe try to stick together so as not to stick out individually. How-ever, other African men quickly fill the space between us, and weare separated.The Africans are friendly, but they are fierce looking.

Here I want to focus on his angst about becoming forty. He(46)Chapter 2Figure 2.7. Death and the Landsknecht,by Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). From W. L.

He statesthat he was beginning to feel the effects of time and loss and that re-cently he had also had a lot of exposure to mortality. He wanted to“make peace” with his fears or felt they might rob him in ways “otherthan the obvious.” He commented that “when your life is full . . . thenyou feel the shadow as a thief ” and remembered someone saying that“it is a fearsome thing to love what the hand of death can touch.”As he participated in the temporal ritual of moving clockwisearound Sol niger, the patient found himself in a relationship with thevery things he fears. Being thus was hard, like doing an exercise inwhich he let himself down close to the dark core and then pushed upand away from it, all the time moving sideways like a crab along withthe flow of time. It is noteworthy that his sun sign is Cancer, the crab,and that the dreamer came to feel that his movement reflected his ownidentity and destiny.

As the dreamer reflectedon the dream, he felt he was being initiated into time and into his hu-man mortality. He had to connect with this darkness and join in theprimordial human dance with the cycle of time.The importance of dance as a primal form of ritual enactment is de-scribed by the poet Gary Snyder, who states that dance once had a con-nection with “ritual drama, the miming of animals, or tracing the mazeof the spiritual journey.”40Snyder believes that we have lost touch withthis connection and that it is the task of the dancer and the poet to re-gain it—“to put us in touch with our archaic roots, with the world inits nakedness, which is fundamental to us all: birth—love—death; thesheer fact of being alive.” The importance of ritual and initiation asthemes connected to dance is also richly elaborated by Steven Lansdale,who notes that initiatory ceremonies and dances are intended to teachthe initiates what they need to survive in harsh environments.41For ourdreamer, facing the issues of midlife were indeed harsh realities, and, inthis instance and on a personal scale, one might imagine the artistry ofthe dream serving a singular function to the creative artist in drawingthe ascensionist spirit down into the body, feeling, and time. Such adownward movement also requires a kind of dying, in which we comeclose to the mysterious forces of both creation and destruction.Spontaneous expression of the black sun can also be found in the artof traumatized children. In their work, researchers Gregorian, Azarian,DeMaria, and McDonald studied Armenian children who were trau-matized by earthquakes and who had witnessed “overwhelming deathand destruction.”42In these images, the black sun often appears overthe location in which the trauma was experienced. A particularly strik-ing example is shown in figure 2.9, an image made by a seven-year-oldgirl, Varduhy, who was traumatized by an earthquake. Here the blacksun is in the sky above destroyed buildings surrounded by red cloudsof smoke. It was reported that she began to fear everything in herworld: the sun, rain, lightning, hail, animals, buildings, and so on.The authors noted their astonishment at finding this “somewhatunusual” image in their study of children’s art but also commentedthat references to it “can be found in many different sources.”43“For(48)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"instance, there are various kinds of black suns used with differentmeanings in the mythological traditions and metaphors of poetryaround the world.... First of all, the black sun has been referred to asan apocalyptic image indicating darkness and gloom, fear and terror,death and non-being, retribution and oblivion.”44It is noteworthy that, in Biblical passages, the dark sun is linked withearthquakes:The earth quakes before them,the heavens tremble.The sun and the moon shall be dark.45And, again, in the Book of Revelations:When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was agreat earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth.46The Descent into Darkness(49)Figure 2.9.

However, for thesechildren the sun is painted black. The life-giver has turned dark. Therational has turned irrational, the clear lucidity of the sun has beeneclipsed by the darkness and night of disaster and trauma.”48This description is pertinent to the next series of paintings, whichwere made by a woman in a long-term analysis. Her first image has anodd twist. The black sun above is surprising since the scene, repro-duced here in gray scale (figure 2.10), in the original painting appearspleasant and colorful. The green mountains, blue waters, and aquaticlife at first glance can give the impression that all is well, leaving one towonder about the appearance of Sol niger in such a context.On closer inspection, it is important to notice that the mermaid’sface is highly stylized, made up with eyeliner, rouge, lipstick, and so on.This persona was an important factor that covered up her inner dark-ness. Another detail that one might link with Sol niger is the black an-chor on the mermaid’s tail, which is, perhaps, pulling her down towarddeeper feelings and which interestingly calls our attention to a sharkthat appears to be attacking or ready to attack. The face of the mer-maid, like the face of my patient, does not register the pain within.In another painting (not included in this book) a similar theme iscontinued in a portrayal of a childlike woman with a noose around herneck and a dark sky behind her. Like the mermaid, the figure has an in-congruent smiling face and seems totally unaware of the horrifyingimplications of her situation.Later, the patient wrote the following poem:ShatteredShattered like a window panebroken by a stormeach tiny piece of me lies onlyand scattered far beyond repairall my shining dreams just lying there(50)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"I’m broken but I’m laughingit’s the sound of falling glassI hope that you won’t mind if Ishould cry and come in while Iwait for this to passOh God, I’m shattered into fragments common graySweep the pieces all awayAnd then no one will know how much it mattersSomething deep inside of me is shattered!!!!Something deep inside of me is shatteredSomething deep inside of me is shatteredThe angst in this poem is further amplified in a drawing she did ofa figure who appears to be screaming, an image very reminiscent ofEdward Munch’s well-known painting, The Scream.This theme is con-tinued by an image she titled “Whispered Screams”—of a child with adowncast look on her face, carrying luggage from which items areThe Descent into Darkness(51)Figure 2.10.

What fell out in the course of the analysis was the story ofa horrific childhood involving emotional, physical, and most likelysexual abuse. My patient reported that her mother chained her to hercrib, abandoned her, and told her that she wished she had never beenborn. Her birthdays were always marked by this statement of hermother’s, and instead of feeling that her birth was something to be cel-ebrated, she felt nothing but shame.Events such as these left the patient feeling very small and alienated,locked out, and disregarded, dumped in the garbage as it were, waitingfor the other shoe to drop. With considerable talent, she painted thesefeelings: The first is an image of a diminutive child in a gigantic chairwith huge closed doors in the background; another painting depicts achild in a garbage can with a mother figure seemingly throwing a shoeout a window. It appears that, for her, the shoe has dropped.Following these dramatic self-expressions were two self-portraits.In the first, she is a stripped-down tree; all of her leaves are blue. Shewrites in one of the branches, “No self respect,” and the blood of herheart pours out over her head as the redness of shame and growinganger. Over time, platitudes and clichés of the false self no longerworked for her, and her sarcastic humor came to the fore. In responseto those who would say things to her such as “It’s better to have lovedand lost than never to have loved at all,” she wrote alongside her sec-ond self-portrait these lines: “Yeah, right. And it’s better to have skiedand broken every bone in your body than to have never gone skiing!And it’s better to have raised pit bulls and gotten torn to shreds than tohave never raised pit bulls! And I suppose it’s better to have drunkdrain cleaner and dissolved your insides than to have never drunkdrain cleaner?”The weight of these feelings contributed to her feeling alienatedfrom herself and from God, not knowing where to turn. At times thesefeelings led to suicidal ideation and the desire to say good-bye to thisworld. At one point in our work she produced the following drawing(figure 2.11), which summed up her feelings of being overwhelmed byher emotions.This work resembles a personal mortificatio in which she empha-sizes her feelings of inadequacy, entrapment, grief, immobilization,(52)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Figure 2.11.

The octopus in the upper left-handcorner of the image reflects all of these emotions, which, like tentacles,grab at her and are linked to one dark center. I think it is not far fetchedto see the octopus, with its dark center and penetrating, raylike tenta-cles, as another version of Sol niger.As my patient struggled with these emotions, she dreamed of beingin a primitive old house. In the dream she stood in what appeared tobe the kitchen or cooking area, with an ancient-looking, cast-iron poton a wood-burning stove. She recalled the flames burning high andbright. She was dressed in rags and looked down at the floor and sawmice, cockroaches, and a crab scurrying across the floor. At first shefelt frustrated and angry that she could not corner or catch them withher bare hands. Then she found herself holding what appeared to betwo large shells, and, stooping forward, she began to scoop up a blackmouse between the shells and then the cockroaches and the crab in thesame manner. She began to skin and prepare the critters; when every-thing was cooked it all looked white and puffy like scallops.I believe that what is happening in this dream follows Jung’s obser-vation in the Mysterium—that when consciousness descends into theunconscious, it at first has frightening results.49To begin with, it pro-duces poisonous animals such as dragons, serpents, and scorpions. Atfirst my patient could not come to terms with either the overwhelmingoctopus or the irritating creatures of her soul, but when she was able toget hold of them and cook them, they became whitened and poten-tially assimilable. This process might be seen in terms of traditionalalchemy as a move from the blackness of the nigredo to the whitenessof albedo, but it is also the case that, for this patient, the continuing en-gagement with darkness was pronounced. Cooking became a part ofthe way she struggled with her darkness and took it in, but the dark-ness itself was never left behind. Sol niger remained as the dark light ofthe creatures of the night. The instinctual, poisonous remains of Solniger remain fundamental and are not bypassed.In figure 2.12a we see a copperplate engraving in which an alchemistis “processing a scorpion.”“In the past centuries, the most hazardous experiments with animal(54)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Descent into Darkness(55)Figure 2.12.

We can begin to imagine what the al-chemists referred to as the “blacker than black” domain of the nigredoexperience. “Nicholas Flamel stated that at the time of the nigredo,which is ‘the black of the blackest black,’ the ‘Matter is dissolved, is cor-rupted.’”53Such experiences have been with us from time immemo-rial; life can be cruel, and the barbarism of human beings toward eachother reflects this savagery. The universe—for all its creative light andbeauty—gives little solace to ravaged souls as they journey throughlife. In the cold light of the black sun, we understand what Conrad callsthe “heart of darkness” and the horror of the “cry” so vividly portrayedby Eduard Munch and the alchemists.The cold face of Sol niger is, as Jungian analyst Sylvia Perera notes,“totally uncaring” and acts like a sniper or terrorist with dark abandonin the name of some infernal sun to destroy light and life itself. For Per-era, this is the realm of the Sumerian goddess Ereshkigal, queen of theNetherworld and the dead, “unbounded, irrational, primordial.”54Shesays, echoing what has been documented thus far, that this realm con-tainsan energy we begin to know through the study of black holes andthe disintegration of elements, as well as through the process offermentation, cancer, decay and lower brain activities that regu-late peristalsis, menstruation, pregnancy, and other forms ofbodily life....

She symbolizes the abyss that is thesource and, the end, the ground of all being.55In this black aspect, Kali, the Hindu goddess associated with deathand described as “one of the most intoxicating personifications of pri-mal energy in the cosmic drama,” is worshipped by the Tantrics.56The(56)Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Tantrics believe that “sitting next to corpses and other (ghastly) imagesof death” in the cremation grounds speeds their efforts to free them-selves from attachment to ego and body.57Color plate 4, an image painted by artist Maitreya Bowen, portraysthe horrific aspect of Kali in a form reminiscent of the black sun.In one of her left hands, Kali holds a severed head, indicating the an-nihilation of the ego, and in an another she carries the sword of phys-ical extinction.

Hillman, with Jung, sees with a dark eye that refuses tolook at the ravages of the human soul through any simple teleologicalor innocent salvationist perspective.

It means, rather, to discover in the course oflife the way toward death and to find in life’s vital signs the im-manent abyss of death. For Christianity and other metaphysicalbeliefs in immortality, the passing into death is a triumph,anopening toward other regions metaphysically different from life.Contrary to such visions, the true sense of agony seems to me tolie in the revelation of death’s immanence in life . . .To see how death spreads over this world, how it kills a treeand how it penetrates dreams, how it withers a flower or a civi-lization, how it gnaws on the individual and on culture like adestructive blight, means to be beyond tears and regrets, beyondsystem and form.

Such astate of black drunkenness is a necessary prerequisite to under-standing why one wishes the immediate end of this world. It’snot the luminous drunkenness of ecstasy, in which paradisal vi-sions conquer you with their splendor and you rise to a puritythat sublimates into immateriality, but a mad, dangerous, ru-inous and tormented black drunkenness, in which death appearswith the awful seduction of nightmarish snake eyes.

Standing in such a place signifies that the mortifi-catio has been achieved. In alchemy, putrefaction follows the mortifica-tio process. It is an aspect of the death experience and is thought to bethe agent whereby change occurs. Only through the experience of dy-ing and decomposition is new life possible. In this chapter we followthe potentially devastating consequences of an encounter with Sol niger.In so doing, we look first at depth psychology’s idea of defense as a pro-tective gesture and then beyond to a psychology of dying that is richlyamplified in both alchemical art as well as the work of contemporaryartists. Through depth psychology and art, we hope to gain an under-standing of the meaning of a symbolic death in which dying and re-newal together form the central mystery and paradox of the black sun.Edinger speculates that “witnessing the putrefaction of a deadbody... was not an unusual experience in the Middle Ages [and]would have had a powerful psychological impact. The effects of thisexperience might then be projected into the alchemical processes.”1Whether the phenomenology of such experiences are observed inouter life and then projected onto alchemical processes or whether, onthe other hand, such experiences emerge from an attention to psyche’sintrinsic movement toward decay and decomposition, they neverthe-less reflect a process and a place in the psyche.2Bosnak describes the place of nigredo and putrefaction asa dark, often repugnant underworld... [as] an incipient processof rot, rot that is necessary to permit a stagnated process to reacha state of dissolution. A period of stench, disintegration, repul-sion and depression . . .

In this bottom-less pit, one finds death, death as the only reality.... It is a bot-tomless pit.... In this realm there is no light, no possibility forreflection.... The heart is heavy and in the lowest state of the ni-gredo,there are no images.3Although I believe Bosnak is correct that at the “bottom” of thisdarkness there are “no images,” in another sense, as we have seen, theimages of dying and dissolution are endlessly imagined in literature,poetry, painting, and psychology. Sol niger is one such image that isnot an image in the conventional sense at all. The very nature of suchextreme darkness seems to call forth an endless proliferation of at-tempts to describe this void, no matter how unsuccessfully. In Virgil’sAeneid,a Sibyl, or priestess of the sun god Apollo, who accompanieshim on his journey to the underworld, says, “If I had a hundredtongues and a hundred mouths and a voice of iron, I still could not de-scribe all the... varieties of punishment awaiting the dead,” yet Virgildescribes Aeneas’s encounter with a monstrous hydra—a beast withfifty heads—and a swarm of wilted, marooned spirits “wandering aim-lessly along the marshes of the Styx,” spirits who have to wander for ahundred years—awaiting putrefaction.4Many such visions of the un-derworld are widely disseminated across time and culture, from Egyptto Greece, in Homer’s Odysseyand Plato’s Gorgias,from the paintingsof Bosch to fire-and-brimstone preachers who depict an image of thesoul in the throws of the nigredo. Contemporary sources such as StarWa r sand the Lord of the Ringscontinue to resonate with this image.Given the repulsive and devastating impact of Sol niger, it is not sur-prising that there is a desire to escape its consequences and to moveaway from and out of its grip. Peter Tatham, a Jungian analyst, com-ments that it is best to avoid such experiences when possible (1984). Hebelieves that in so doing we may enable ourselves and our patients todeal with their darkness in “acceptable doses, or to put it another way,we are helping them towards an incarnation of the death and rebirthprocess rather than being devoured by it.”5However, he also acknowl-edges that there “will be times when the pull of the black hole is toogreat and our attempts to avoid it will be of no avail.

Then there is “no alternative but to submit to its embrace,knowing what it means and without hope. There are some experiencesinto which we can enter willingly, while into others we can only fallscreaming.”6The horror is exemplified in the Egyptian underworld by Ammut,the Egyptian “eater of the dead,” “the monster [that] is part crocodile,part lion, and part hippopotamus.” Ammut sits “at the feet of KingOsiris in the Hall of Justice where the recently departed must face finaljudgment. As the soul gives an account of its life, Ammut tries to trickand confuse it, hoping to bring about an unfavorable ruling. If the soulis judged unworthy . . . Ammut devours it, sometimes with slow cru-elty.”7Ammut has many brothers and sisters in the dark underworld ofpsyche. The bite of Ammut is much like the crocodile in figure 3.1,which appeared in the images drawn by a woman artist whose journeyinto the underworld we discuss in the next chapter.The horror of such experiences breaks down our rational ideas andnaïve visions of light and eternity. Saturnian time and scythe are theorder of the night, and here we might imagine with Blake thatIn stony sleep [Urizen has separated from Eternity and will behatched as the body of the world:]Ages on ages rolled over him!...In a horrible dreamful slumberLike the linked infernal chain,A vast spine writhed in tormentupon the winds, shooting painRibs like a bending cavern,And bones of solidness frozeOver all his nerves of joy8In such instances, if death does not follow wounding, trauma oftendoes. If Jungian analyst Donald Kalsched is right, the psyche has natu-ral defenses against such trauma. In The Inner World of Trauma,hedescribes the psyche’s response to “unbearable psychic pain and anxi-ety.”9By “unbearable,” he means what comes into play when our or-(68)Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"dinary defenses fail. He goes on to describe how the psyche compen-sates for catastrophic and life-threatening experiences, what the psy-choanalyst Winnicott calls “primitive agonies” and self psychologistKohut refers to as “disintegration anxiety,” an unnamed dread thatthreatens a dissolution of a coherent self. For Kalsched, beyond our or-dinary defenses postulated by Freud and others, “a second line ofdefensescomes into play to prevent the ‘unthinkable’ from beingexperienced.” These defenses and their elaboration in unconsciousfantasy are the focus of Kalsched’s investigation. He shows how aspontaneous symbolic process holds the fragmenting pieces of psychetogether in what he calls a traumatic organization. Because this pro-Analysis and the Art of Darkness(69)Figure 3.1.

What seems counterintuitive in his descrip-tion is that this “protector” should show itself also as a malevolentforce in the psyche, one that often persecutes the personal spirit andshows itself to the dream ego as a daemonic and terrifying force. Henotes that most “contemporary writers tend to see this attacking figureas an internalized version of the actual perception of the trauma.”12However, for Kalsched, this is only half correct since “the internal fig-ure is often even more sadistic and brutal than the actual ‘outer worldperpetrator.’” For Kalsched, this indicates that we are dealing withsomething that is contributed from the psyche, a psychological factorand “an archetypal traumatogenic agency within the psyche itself.”13It is strange to think of such a brutal force as a “protector.” Kalschedexplains that the intention of this daemonic force is to prevent at allcosts the reexperiencing of the horror at the genesis of the traumato-genic organization. The daemons of the inner world, like the templelions at the entrance of sacred spaces, serve to keep away the unpre-pared. They will “disperse [the self ] into fragments (dissociation) or en-capsulate it and sooth it with fantasy (schizoid withdrawal) or numbit with intoxicating substances (addictions) or persecute it to keep itfrom hoping for life in this world (depression).”14Hope would openthe soul, leaving it vulnerable to what is imagined as an even morepainful experience than that which the “protective daemon” enforceson the wounded “personal spirit.”It is often the case, however, that the cure is worse than the “illness,”even if this cannot be seen from within the experience of the over-whelming threat that continues in the wake of trauma. The fact thatthe ego does not notice the problematic character of the cure sets thestage for the fact that “the primitive defense does not learn anythingabout realistic danger.... Each new life opportunity is mistakenlyseen as a dangerous threat of re-traumatization and is therefore at-(70)Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"tacked. In this way, the archaic defenses become anti-life forces whichFreud understandably thought of as part of the death instinct.”15This is not surprising since the “self-care system” will “go to anylength to protect the Self ” in spite of the continual masochistic suffer-ing involved, “even to the point of killing the host personality in whichthis personal spirit is housed (suicide).”16As a result, what was intendedto be a defense against further trauma now becomes itself destructive in a variety of ways: “The person survives but cannot live creatively.”17Such consequences also manifest themselves in the ravages of de-pression and melancholic affect “engineered by our self-care system.”18Kalsched cites Julia Kristeva, a Lacanian psychoanalyst who speaks ofthe black sun. Kalsched’s interest is not in the archetypal image of theblack sun per se but in contributing to a Jungian understanding of de-fense processes and to the operation of the psyche as a whole. For him,the image of the black sun via Kristeva remains a “pathological” prod-uct of the self-care system and a “primitive” expression and image ofdefense in the face of unbearable, unreachable, and even invisible nar-cissistic wounds.For Kalsched and Kristeva, a person attaches to a thing that is in-tended to protect the personal spirit from the unthinkable. In so do-ing, the person is cut offfrom the “spontaneous expressions of self inthe world.”19Living in this devastation, the soul is in a suspension fromlife, a dark enclosure seemingly safe but isolated and stuck in terms offurther individuation. In describing this process, Kalsched seems toequate the “personal spirit” with the inner core of the Self, and fromthis perspective he speaks of the Self as “coherent” and as the “total hu-man personality.” He sees the child or animal images as reflecting thehidden remains of the “whole self.” In symbolic imagery Kalsched seesa larger operating dynamic of the psyche, not just of ego dynamics assuch. In this way of imagining it, he gives a Jungian, archetypal basis tothe psychoanalytic ideas of others such as Fairbairn, Guntrip, andKlein.As we already noted, Kalsched’s contemporary vision of Sol nigerplaces it in the realm of pathology and of the defensive and traumaticorganization of the psyche. Although his contribution reflects theworking of the archetypal dimension, his focus is on the way arche-Analysis and the Art of Darkness(71)"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"typal dynamics protect and preserve the remaining fragments of whathe calls the self or “personal spirit.” But can the archetypal image of Solniger be adequately understood as the product of defense?20If under-stood strictly in this way, Sol niger can be imagined only as a kind ofblack hole whose gravity draws the vulnerable “ego” or Self into a fas-cination, a spider web that traps it into a doomed stasis.My contention is that such a description is only part of the story andthat it does not yet take into account a more fundamental, archetypalrole played by Sol niger in the transformative dynamics of psychic life.One question here is the status of the ego or the self. Does Sol nigerhave an important role to play in breaking defensive bewitchment andin the deconstructing of the ego or the Self itself ? Does the ego requirea dying process, as the themes of myth and alchemy suggest? Kalsched’sanalysis is focused on the preservation and release of the fractured ego.This does not address those moments when the dissolution of the egois required and constitutes a genuine possibility for a nondefensive ini-tiation that aims at far more than self-preservation, fascination, andthe return of the more integrated ego into the flow of life. As impor-tant as this process is—and Kalsched’s contribution to our under-standing of it—the emergence of Sol niger requires a reflection on thatwhich is beyond the humanism of ego psychology and which attemptsto take on questions of the death of the ego or perhaps even the Self aspart of psychic possibility.In the classical and developmental psychologies, the unity of thehealthy ego is the essential structure of the psyche. The question of thedissolution of the ego or Self is almost always seen as regressive anddetrimental, a fusion, or a return to the mother. Some analysts, how-ever, have raised a different perspective, one that has challenged egopsychology and the humanistic position it requires. Such approacheslend themselves to a different understanding of Sol niger and to our in-terpretation of the “death instinct” as being beyond biological as-sumptions, or defensive operations of the psyche, or the death of theego as a regression.One such position is that of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan,who imagines the aggressive energy directed toward the ego not at all asa defense of an ideal unity of the Self, but rather as a rebellion against it.(72)Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"For Lacan, this ideal unity is itself the problem, and the idea of the egois a distortion of reality. The aggressive energy—the “brutal force”—directed against the ego is not, as Kalsched suggests, to preserve the Selfbut actually to break down its defensive function. Psyche’s telos may notbe to protect the ego from reexperiencing trauma but rather to push ittoward the feared unthinkable—to the core of its voidness. The inten-tion of the “death instinct” may be to move psychic organization be-yondthe interests of maternal or paternal preservation of the ego’ssurvival and its humanistic concerns of health and wholeness.21Jungian analyst David Rosen’s work Transforming Depressioncon-tributes to our understanding of such a death process. In that bookRosen coins the term “egocide” to describe the symbolic death neces-sary to the transformative process, a process in which the psyche ispushed beyond its defenses. He states that symbolic death “leads toa ... greater fall, which actually feels like death.”22It is like entering aneternal void and requires a suffering through a death-rebirth experi-ence. Rosen images the dying process alchemically, comparing it to afertile ground—“the underground psychic soil”—in which the seedsof the true self are embedded ans from which they ultimately can ger-minate.”23If the soul in depression is nurtured properly, the results willbe new life for the psyche. This process is similar to what the alchemistsunderstand as mortification. Figure 3.2 shows the relationship be-tween life, death, and the soil as illustrated in the image of the sun inthe shape of a black skull with a golden headdress. The figure—calledthe Lord of the Soil—is a sixteenth-century image from the Kye Mon-astery in Ladakh, India.In another image (figure 3.3) from The Hermetic Museum,grain isseen to be growing out of the grave and “corresponds to the alchemi-cal idea that death is the conception of the Philosopher’s Stone,” themystical goal of alchemy. For Rosen, this deep “organic” process sets inmotion a kind of mourning for the now lost, dominant ego, and hegives examples of this kind of journey through the dark night of thesoul, in which part of the individual psyche must die or be symboli-cally killed. Egocide makes possible a psychic transformation and con-stitutes a death-rebirth process. In that process, ego identity dies or issymbolically killed along with one’s former perspectives of oneself andAnalysis and the Art of Darkness(73)"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"of life. Still, for Rosen, what Jung calls the Self is not destroyed. Whatis killed or analyzed to death is the negative (destructive) ego or false(inauthentic) Self. The primary Self as an archetypal image of theSupreme Being remains connected to the secondary, reconstituted egoand the true (authentic) self, which can be renewed and live its per-sonal myth with joy.24In Rosen’s study, egocide is thus closely tied to rebirth and creativ-ity, and one can begin to reimagine what has been called the “death in-(74)Chapter 3Figure 3.2. “The Lord of the Soil,” photo by Madanjeet Singh.

For Kalsched, too, there is a death that breaks through sterility,bewitchment, and defensive mystical devotion. In his approach ananalysis of defense helps the person to suffer through blockages, and inthe best instances this can lead to a deep sense of compassion that me-diates the experience of the “whole Self and its embodied incarnation.”25What Kalsched does not consider is that the death instinct and thearchetypal image of Sol niger might themselves lead toward a break-down of the defensive stasis.The work of psychologist Mark Welman lends itself to this conclu-sion. The death instinct has been “conspicuously absent in Jung’s psy-chology.”26Welman notes that it is seldom recognized that Jung “sawdeath as the ontological pivot” point in the process of psychic unfold-ing. Welman, therefore, sets out to explicate a Jungian phenomenol-ogy of death. He sees Jung’s thought as going beyond Freud’s idea of the death instinct as a search for literal death. He suggests via Lacanand in resonance with Rosen that its intent is rather a “deconstruction”Analysis and the Art of Darkness(75)Figure 3.3. Grain growing from the grave, symbolizing resurrection. From Edward Edinger, Anatomy of the Psyche: Alchemical Symbolism in Psychotherapy,p. 163."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"of the literalist ego in favor of a symbolic order. He points out that forJung as well, “death” is already a psychological rather than a corporealevent.27He notes that from the point of view of the ego, death is a bru-tal and frightening reality, but “from the perspective of the Self deathappears,” as it does for Rosen, as “a joyful event... a mysterium con-iunctionis[through which] the soul... achieves wholeness.”28For Wel-man, understanding the meaning of death in terms of the archetype ofthe Self offers a way of seeing it in a broader and more adequate waythan Freud’s conception of Thanatos. From the existential point ofview, death is not some “actuality” outstretched in time to be experi-enced later, but rather, as Heidegger, Hillman, Lacan, the Buddhists,and others suggest, as something always already happening in the“now” as an “existential immediacy.”For Jung, this “now” of death is an “imaginal reality: a dark and per-vasive presence and a primordial abyss” that obliterates the light ofconsciousness even as it opens up and frees one for the symbolic life.29Inshort, the power of the death demon at an archetypal level aims at boththe deconstruction of the ego and the creation of new life. In Welman’selaboration of Jung via philosopher Martin Heidegger and other exis-tential thinkers, death fertilizes the imaginal and works to open a po-etic space that brings depth and meaning to everyday life. Welman’sideas closely follow Heidegger’s account of death as a “shrine of noth-ing,” by which Heidegger means a kind of ontological emptiness, anemptiness within which Being is grounded and through which Beingmay be recollected. For many analysts, this way of speaking is unfa-miliar and difficult to understand within the traditional frameworks.I believe, however, that what Welman, through Heidegger, is sug-gesting is not far from Jung’s idea that the Self can be discovered andrecollected through the nothingness of the mortificatio process. Themortificatio process eventually leads to “nothingness,” a nothingnessthat is not literal but existential, imaginal, symbolic, and poetic. For ananalyst to speak in this way by no means bypasses the defensive pro-cesses or the horror of an analysand’s terror of the unthinkable noth-ingness that Kalsched and others so well describe. The point is not toidealize the destructive potential of nothingness and death but to shiftour focus toward the possibility that the psyche itself may call us to the(76)Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"“unthinkable” dissolution of the ego and that this is not alwayswhatwe imagine. Therefore at times the job of an analyst may be not tocollude with the restorative function of defense but rather to help thepsyche dissolve them.As we move from egocide toward the reevaluation of the ego andthe death instinct, we move from a simply biological or traditionalpsychological understanding toward a symbolic and metaphoric oneand from literal death to a deconstruction of the literalist ego, which ispart of the teleological aspect of the psyche itself.In Dreams and the Underworld,James Hillman moves us further inthis direction and speaks of death as a metaphor, separating it from lit-eral death and linking it more to what goes on in the subtle body andin the psychic life.30For him, “the death we speak of in our culture is afantasy of the ego,” and from that perspective we lose touch with sub-tlety. “For us, pollution and decomposition and cancer have becomephysical only.”31He notes that in the great art of other cultures there isa different kind of sensibility with respect to dying, one that has fadedfrom our attention and become part of the modern unconsciousnessand of the psychic underworld. For him, it is in the world of depth psy-chology “where today we find the initiatory mystery, the long journeyof psychic learning, ancestor worship, the encounter with demons andshadows, the suffering of Hell.”32He describes the experience of thisunderworld as a journey that “must be made.”33Describing one suchjourney, he says “it comes as violation, dragging one out of life and intothe Kingdom that the Orphic Hymn to Pluto describes as ‘void of day.’So it often says on Greek epitaphs that entering Hades is ‘leaving thesweet sunlight.’ ”34In this instance, Hillman is describing the underworld of Hadesagainst the mythic background of the Greek Demeter/Persephonemythologem and the psychological mysteries of Eleusis, which, henotes, we still experience today. He refers to our “sudden depressions,when we feel ourselves caught in hatefulness, cold, numbed, and drawndownward out of life by a force we cannot see... We feel invaded frombelow, assaulted, and we think of death.”35The world of Hades is an important focus for Hillman, but this, too,is only one way to imagine this metaphoric space of dying. OtherAnalysis and the Art of Darkness(77)"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"mythologems help to constitute other experiences. Hillman’s “under-world” is a “mythological style of describing a psychological cos-mos.”36For him, “underworld is psyche”; it is a world that can be seenwhen “one’s entire mode of being has been desubstantialized, killed ofnatural life . . . and [is] devoid of life.” To know the psyche for Hill-man, then, is to “die,” to make the “descent to Hades.”37For him, underworld images are ontological statements about thesoul and how it “exists in and for itself beyond life.” In light of this,Hillman reads “all movement towards this realm of death, whetherthey be fantasies of decay, images of sickness in dreams, repetitivecompulsions, or suicidal impulses, as movements towards a more psy-chological perspective.”38In this way he, too, takes up what Freudcalled the “death instinct” and reenvisions this dark side of the soul asa movement toward psychological depth and as an “invisible back-ground that breaks us ‘out of life’ as we know it.” In this way one mightimagine the death of the “ego” as a death of the materialist perspectiveand of the humanism of a naturalistic psychology. For him, the idea isnot to return a stronger ego to life or to the constellation of the “trueself,” which is just as suspect. Rather, what is called for is a “shift in con-sciousness” and a descent to the underworld that “must be made.” Thisdescent is necessary even for the most integrated egos. In dreams andpsychic life there is for Hillman an inherentopposition within thepsyche, and no amount of good-enough parental care should protectthe soul from dying into psychological life. Ultimately, for Hillman,“death” is the most radical way of expressing a shift in consciousness.For most depth psychologists, the journey to the underworld is forthe purpose of a return to life as, one hopes, a more integrated self, butfor Hillman this does not go far enough. The return of the repressedstill does not address the deeper meaning of “death itself ” and the un-derworld psyche.39Hades as a figure of his concern reflects a radicalshift in our view of psychological life, which is qualitatively differentfrom that of our modernist tradition; Hades does not represent amovement into life and wholeness but rather a movement out of life inwhich the literal ego loses its fixed substance. This is a difficult per-spective for modern consciousness to understand. How it differs fromthe perspectives of Jung, Kalsched, Rosen, Welman, Lacan, and others(78)Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"remains to be further elaborated, but on the surface Hillman’s visionseems to be one of a very different sense of psyche.Whatever the differences and similarities between the positions wehave outlined, all of us would agree that the “death experience” mustbe understood metaphorically and psychologically. We have alreadyseen that alchemy has placed the death experience at the heart of thealchemical process. Without entering into the nigredo and undergoingthe mortificatio experience, no transformation is possible. Alchemicalliterature is replete with descriptions, arcane as they may be, of thephenomenology and symbolism of dying, often illustrated with highlycomplex images and symbolic drawings.The Art of MortificatioSymbolic images of the mortificatio have appeared throughout theages, from the alchemists to the postmodern artists of today. Themetaphor of death is richly elaborated in arcane graphics in whichcorpses, coffins, and graves are containers for the mysterious workingsof the psyche. The Rosarium Philosophorum,for instance, contains aseries of such images in which the coffin functions as a container forthe process of transformation. Jung writes that in these images, the“vas hermeticeum... [has] here become sarcophagus and tomb.”40Thistheme also appears in a series of drawings (figure 3.4) that began to ap-pear in alchemical manuscripts during the Renaissance.For Jung as well as for the alchemists, “death” is part of a process oftransformation in which strange and symbolic events take place. It wasimportant to the alchemists and for Jung to illustrate the processthrough images. Because the work of alchemy is concerned with thedying process and a linking of the ego and the unconscious, Jung feltthat this experience could best “be expressed by means of symbols” orimages “born of nature’s own workings.”41For Jung, a natural symbolis “far removed from all conscious intention.”Jungian analyst JeffRaffrightly points out that “alchemical pictureswere not simply illustrations for a text, but attempts to communicate”complex realities and “were a profound expression of the alchemi-cal imagination.”42Alchemical emblems “represent the mysteries ofAnalysis and the Art of Darkness(79)"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Figure 3.4.

Noting that these engravings“transcend both illustration and decoration,” he argues that they con-stitute an independent pictorial language that, in silence but not with-out eloquence, conveys the secrets of alchemy.44De Rola sees theseimages as a kind of alchemical language that “plays [on] . . . doublemeanings, natural analogies and hermetick interpretations of classicalmythology.”45He calls this way of communicating “the Golden Game.”The Rosariumpictures illustrating the dying process are one groupingamong several others. The death experience was pivotal, and Sol nigerwas often intimately linked to the nigredo and mortificatio aspects ofthe process.The metaphoric expression of the dying process is also found inother alchemical manuscripts. For example, chapter two ends with anillustration from Mylius’s Philosophia Reformata (1622), in which theimage of a skeleton is standing on a glowing black orb marking thenigredo/putrefactio stage in the death-rebirth process. Other alchem-ical manuscripts likewise place images of the black sun in similar po-sitions in the process. For instance, alchemist Edward Kelly, in hispaper “The Theatre of Terrestrial Astronomy,” comments that “the be-ginning of our work is the black raven which, like all things that are togrow and receive life, must first putrefy. For putrefaction is a necessarycondition of solution, as salvation is of birth and regeneration.”46In figure 3.5 we see an image of conjunction in which a black sun iscontained in an alchemical vessel. Behind the furnace is a field of greenbarely springing up out of the earth, again linking death with regener-ation. This process is beautifully described in the alchemical manu-script Cabala Mineralis,in which Sol is described as undergoing “sophiccalcinations, and putrefaction.” The common Sun is watered with newmercury and made “one body black and not porous.” Then germina-tion takes place. The Sun is changed from its black color and becomesgreen and is spread out into the vegetation.Another image (figure 3.6) of Sol niger is found in The HermeticAnalysis and the Art of Darkness(81)"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Garden of Daniel Stolcius.47This is an essential, seventeenth-centurysourcebook in the symbolic and meditative tradition in alchemy andone of its most important emblem books.48A translation of the Latin inscription accompanying the emblemreads as follows:Let the highest point of your magisteryBe to remove the earth born shade fromthe rays of the Sun.Let the bird die, and rise up again into the airSo that it may know how to increase its life.49In these alchemical images, the symbology of dying is pivotal, com-plex, and closely linked to transformation. Images of Sol niger anddeath seem to bring what we think of as opposites into proximity. Blackorbs glow with intense light, graves are filled with green barley, anddeath is linked to an increase in life. These alchemical images might beimagined to reflect what Welman calls an ontological “pivot point,” aperspective in which death is also jouissanceand egocide is linked to(82)Chapter 3Figure 3.5.

Likewise for Hillman, death is also the death of a materialistviewpoint, freeing us for imaginal and poetic life, a life beyond life, anda movement into psychological depth.We have seen that images have played an important role in the ex-pression of complex psychological processes, processes that seem toexceed our traditional ways of speaking and imagining. The attempt toexplore ontological “pivot points” and to penetrate paradoxes like Solniger are aided not only by allegorical images but also by the study ofartistic expression in general. How can we understand a death thatmeans new life or a darkness that shines? Images such as these havelong interested artists and writers, even “after alchemy itself had falleninto disrepute as a natural science.”50The death of the ego, blackness,and the transformation of the soul, which were so important in al-chemy, were also concerns for a number of artists. Mona Sandqvistwrites that “alchemy has been kept alive in art, music, and literature bya chain of masters: painters like Bosch, Brueghel the Elder, Max ErnstAnalysis and the Art of Darkness(83)Figure 3.6.

T. A. Hoffman, Balzac, Gerard de Nerval, Mallormé,Autard, Yeats and Joyce.”51The paradox of the black sun is that it is an image that simulta-neously expresses what traditionally has been held to be a pair of in-compatible and opposing phenomena: darkness and light, blacknessand luminosity. Yet, in the image of Sol niger, they are intimately linked.This luminous paradox at the heart of the black sun has been a themeboth explicit and implicit in the work of painters who have painted inblack.Explicitly, there have been a number of artists who have paintedblack suns, including Motherwell, Matisse, Ernst, Calder, and others.More implicitly, the theme of painting luminous blackness has been animportant part of the history of painting and would require a book-length study in its own right. Malevich, Rothko, Reinhardt, Soulages,Stella, and Rauschenberg are well known for their focus on blacknessand the dialectic of light and dark and have dedicated a part of their ca-reers to exploring this theme.Figure 3.7 shows a primitive and powerful rendition of the black sunby Motherwell. Matisse expresses a very different aspect of the blacksun. He thought of black as a luminous color and went on to experi-ment with the idea of black light, with black as luminosity. “The con-cept of black as a colour (not simply as a darkener) had been debatedin painterly circles since the Renaissance, and had been more or lessgenerally accepted by the close of the nineteenth century.”52Still, as arthistorian John Gage points out, the notion of black as a light is “so para-doxical and so radical” that it invites a more careful examination.53Gage’s reflection on Matisse considers a number of possible influenceson him, including that of the philosopher Henri Bergson and themathematician Henri Poincaré, who held that movement exists onlyby means of “the destruction and reconstitution of matter,” a provoca-tive idea relevant to our exploration of Sol niger. Gustave LeBon, anineteenth-century scientist, was also interested in the idea of the in-stability of matter and likewise began to develop a theory of black lightas well.54Although the term “black light” was not generally accepted,it became clear that visible light accounted for less than one tenth of(84)Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"the spectrum and that the invisible portion constituted a far more“important portion of the light,” even though the human eye was notsensitive enough to perceive it directly.55“Black Light was not a con-cept which had any lasting [scientific] impact,” but “Matisse’s ‘blacklight,’ on the other hand, propelled partly by the inner turmoil broughtabout by illness and war, had a long life ahead of it.... What proved tobe contingent and provisional in science has revealed itself as endur-ing in art.”56The oddly titled “Black Sun” by Max Ernst (figure 3.8) was literallypainted in blues and yellows. Ernst was a member of the surrealistmovement for which the black sun was an important image. In the in-troduction to his book, Max Ernst and Alchemy,M. E. Warlick writesabout the prime matter of the alchemist and notes that “it is composedof two essential properties, Philosophic Sulphur and PhilosophicAnalysis and the Art of Darkness(85)Figure 3.7.

War-lick describes how as the alchemical process unfolds, these oppositescombine, and, through their sexual union, the birth of the philosoph-ical child or philosopher’s stone emerges.I am uncertain what Ernst had in mind in his painting of Sol niger,but it is not hard to imagine in this image the conjunction of oppositesin the lower plane and the rounded image of a transcendental pos-sibility above. In this case, a black sun, which is a “union” of Sun andMoon, gives offa strange luminescence or dark light, perhaps emerg-ing from a crossing of opposites that is difficult to describe.The theme of “bridging opposites” and of dark light is also found inthe art of Mark Rothko. Rothko is well known for his powerful black-on-black paintings (figure 3.9). In 1961, John de Menil and Dominique(86)Chapter 3Figure 3.8. Black Sun(1927–1928), painting by Max Ernst. © 2004 Artists RightsSociety (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris.

While the black sun never be-came an explicit theme for him, the binary opposition between lightand dark, subject and object, presence and absence, and life and deathwere fundamental to his art. Rothko’s own reflections on this themeare of interest because for him the opposites are “neither synthesized,nor neutralized . . . but held in a confronted unity, which is a mo-mentary stasis.”58This confrontation creates a “structure” not unlikeErnst’s Black Sunin that it calls the very status of “opposition” intoquestion by overlapping their “terms.” In essence, he finds a way topaint a “brink or border between” opposites and this was the focus ofhis subject.59In his so doing, Rothko’s art expresses the “affectivepower of a state of irresolution or undecidability.”60The idea of undecidability helps to amplify what was earlier calledan “ontological pivotal point,” a point that Rothko continued to ap-proach as he broke away from surrealism and turned toward what hasbeen called “abstract painting.” What he did in these paintings was tofurther what he had been struggling with all along. Art theorist AnnaChave describes this process as “at once inscribing and erasing...Analysis and the Art of Darkness(87)Figure 3.9. Untitled(1964–1967), painting by Mark Rothko. © 1998 Kate RothkoPrizel and Christopher Rothko / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.

One might likewise see the black sun as an image under erasure,undecidable in terms of presence or absence. For Chave, Rothko’sblack-on-black paintings are “directed against the closure of meta-physics,” that is, the kind of thinking that binds one into binary hier-archies and ontological commitments to presence over absence. InRothko’s paintings, Chave concludes, “absence had come to the fore.”Chave notes that postmodern philosopher Jacques Derrida’s termsfor this gesture of effacing the presence of a thing is writing (écriture)and that a “text, whether ‘literary,’ ‘psychic,’ ‘anthropological’ or picto-rial, is precisely ‘a play of presence and absence,’” a kind of artistic fort-da,“‘a play of the effaced trace.’”63Rothko’s attempt to paint this pivotalpoint between presence and absence was also an attempt to paint thevoid. This led some of his critics to consider him a religious man ormystic, a description that he himself denied. One might also imagineRothko struggling with the “death instinct,” as we have described it, asan urge toward the unthinkable. In 1958, while lecturing on his art, hedeclared that “tragic art . . . deals with the fact that a man is born to die.”For Chave, his art “engaged the emotions most subject to repression,those insufferable intimations of mortality and that invasive sense ofnothingness that permeates modern experience.”64Chave cites Adorno:“The greatness of works of art lies solely in their power to let those thingsbe heard which ideology conceals.” Rothko’s black paintings, ratherthan creating a hysterical defense or fascination, served as revelations ofa kind—“less reassuring than troubling.”65As we have seen, engagingthis realm of darkness can have tragic consequences, and so it was ulti-mately the case with Rothko. In February, 1970, he was found in a poolof blood on the floor of his studio, where he had committed suicide, andso he might be seen as yet another victim of the darkest side of Sol niger.Another important painter who painted black-on-black paintings isAd Reinhardt. For twelve years beginning in the early fifties, he painted(88)Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"only black paintings. He also wrote a good deal about his work, and aselection of his writing has been edited with commentary by promi-nent art critic Barbara Rose in a work called Art-as-Art: The SelectedWritings of Ad Reinhardt.66Shortly before Reinhardt’s death, he re-flected on his painting and stated that his purpose was to “push paint-ing beyond its thinkable, seeable, graspable, feelable limits.”67Rein-hardt’s idea was that his painting represented “both the end of theWestern tradition and the beginning of a new mode of perception.”68According to Reinhardt, his black paintings created perceptual de-mands radically different from those of Western painting because hisimages require both the time to see and an act of focusing so demand-ing that it changes the state of the viewer’s consciousness. For him, “theblack paintings are icons without iconography. They function like thehypnotic patterns of the abstract diagrams of tantric Buddhism: theyinduce a state of contemplation which may be defined as medita-tive.... The black paintings, although not specifically ‘religious,’ arean effort to retrieve the dimension of the spiritual in a secular cul-ture.”69In the last ten years of Reinhardt’s life, his paintings became “black,black, black, black, black.”70“Nothing in the painting: ‘No realism, noimpressionism, no expressionism... no texture, no brushwork, nosketching or drawing, no forms, no designs, no calm, no light, nospace, no time, no size or scale, no movement, no object, no subject.’”For writer Richard Smith, Reinhardt’s dozens of published state-ments like this one “burn on the page like a demonic chant.” Like the“neti neti” of the Hindus or the inability to name God in Christianmysticism, there seems to be no way to adequately capture any objectof Reinhardt’s paintings.Ultimately, though, for Smith, “this endless chain of negations [does]not lead to nihilism” but actually reverse the negative association thatthe color black usually connotes. Although Reinhardt himself andmany of his critics reject the religious intention of his paintings, writerNaomi Vine notes that, in his own jottings on the mandala, he wrotethis of his paintings:71“Holy ground, sacred space, fixed point, thresh-old, limit, entrance, ‘gate,’ sign, ritual, pure region; holy of holies,breakthrough from plane to plane... no change, no exhaustion, re-Analysis and the Art of Darkness(89)"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"coverable, repeatable, starting over at the beginning, eternal return,repetition.”72For Vine, such statements indicate that Reinhardt saw his paintingsas an entry point to an attainable, repeatable spiritual experience, anexperience that went beyond nihilism.Pierre Soulages, a twentieth-century French abstract artist, alsopainted black images, which art historian and critic Donald Kuspit hascalled “unsettling, undigestible, out of sight, unseeable, ironically in-visible.”73Like Rothko and Reinhardt, Soulages’s paintings “do not sub-mit to the usual process of perception” and have the effect of displacingand minimizing the ego subject. For philosopher Theodor Adorno,Soulages’s images lead to an “emaciation” of the subject and constitutea “blackness that is too extreme to become the site of human fantasy.”74Such statements bring to the fore the tension between a humanistic egopsychology and a psychology that could do justice to “postmodern sen-sibilities” of abstract art. The complexities of such a psychology mustgo beyond binary opposition and approach the kind of undecidabilitythat opens the psyche to a process of creativity and the sacred.Even though Kuspit finds it oversimplifying, he still characterizesSoulages’s purpose as being to “find the light in the dark, more partic-ularly the light that dwells in the darkness and that, at the moment ofrevelation, is secreted by it, as it were.”75Such a moment is reminiscentof the Elgonyi as noted in chapter 2, for whom such a moment is sacred.Kuspit goes on to suggest that what Soulages points to is the Self at itsmost extreme and “emaciated” point, desperate for the light that cantransfigure it, a light that is always latent and concealed within black-ness.Finally, for Soulages, blackness is not the end but the starting pointfor a subtle, almost inexpressible, light. For the alchemist, I believe,this light was the lumen naturae, which, like Jung’s scintillae, glows atthe heart of matter itself. For Soulages, there remained a primitive andfundamental if not essential split in the psyche between light and dark,which Kuspit feels the painter could never quite resolve. It is as if at thecore of the Self there is a primitive divide, a “cut,” an irresolvable bi-nary state that has also become a theme for a number of painters.

Artist LucioFontana pierced and sliced his canvasses, as if canvas was psyche, in an attempt to show what was going on in the “interior” of a painting.76Other artists changed the way canvasses were constructed and the waythey used material. The very matter of paintings was alchemicallytransformed, and, for some, alchemy itself became an inspiration tocreative process.The work of renowned German artist Anselm Kiefer is filled withobvious alchemical allusions. He broke a number of different conven-tions in the material base of his art, mixing painting, sculpture, andphotography as well as using both “visual and verbal languages longconsidered an impure practice” in the art world. On his huge can-vasses, he uses not only paint but also “straw, wax, lead, wood and hu-man hair.”77In 1984, he painted The Nigredo,and in a critical com-mentary on his work, Jack Flam refers to him as “The Alchemist.”78Lopez-Pedraza, a Jungian analyst from Caracas, Venezuela, com-ments in his book on Kiefer that “the nigredowas called the darkness,darker than darkness.”79However, in the painting by this name, the“mortificatioof the Earth transformed suffering into psyche and art.”80Here as in other paintings Kiefer goes to the margins of the darkestshadows of our history and our personal and cultural life. His art de-mands a confrontation with taboos, indigestible traumas, and the un-healed wounds of our age.Such a conscious struggle with wounds affects the soul of the artistand stimulates the individuation process. In “The Starred Heaven”(1980) (figure 3.10), a photograph of Kiefer appears faded out, and adark, stormy sky is painted all around him.Standing on a snake, the figure has his hands on his hips. Written onthe painting are words taken from Kant, “The starred heavens above[us]: The moral law within us.” For Lopez-Pedraza, Kiefer’s self-imageis an expression of the artist’s individuation. He notes, as other com-mentators have, that in the center of the figure’s chest, at the site of hisheart, is the artist’s pallet, marking the place from which creative ex-pression comes. The starred heaven is then equated by Lopez-Pedrazawith the alchemical scintillae, the first appearance of the soul, theAnalysis and the Art of Darkness(91)"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Figure 3.10.

If this is so, then it is not surprising that thebody image is also fading, perhaps giving a visual register to whatphilosopher Theodor Adorno has earlier called the “emaciation of thesubject.”A second portrait, called “Broken Flowers and Grass” (figure 3.11),lends credence to this view, I believe.In this image, Kiefer is lying on a bed, appearing to be asleep ordead. The entire picture is painted over with broken black-and-whiteflowers and grass. For López-Pedraza, this image has a “hermetic,freakish touch, that of rehearsing one’s own death.”81In and throughthese images, López-Pedraza links depression, death, the body, andfeeling to individuation and the creative processes.From this perspective, the image of dying is perhaps “freakish” inthe same way that alchemical images are—in portraying those “onto-logical pivot points” in which opposites coalesce—life and death, cre-ation and destruction, inner and outer, light and dark, microcosm andmacrocosm. From this point of view, “The Starred Heaven” and “Bro-ken Flowers and Grass” might be seen as an imaging of the relation be-tween the Sol niger of the heart and the scintilla of the cosmos. Theparadox continues to be a theme for contemporary artists.Janet Towbin, who did a series of black paintings influenced by al-chemists, writes:[B]lack is the beginning of consciousness—you cannot have lightwithout darkness or darkness without light. The dyad of blackand white sets up a diurnal rhythm and the contrast is essentialto consciousness. This is the symbol of Tao, the yin and yang.In alchemy, the color black refers to the nigredo,a stage inalchemy where there is an inward turning toward creative and fe-cund activity.

One of the aims of alchemy was to beget this light hidden innature, a light very different from the Western association of light asseparate from darkness. In Alchemical Studies,Jung writes about thelight of nature (lumen naturae), which he calls “the light of darknessitself, which illuminates its own darkness, and this light the darknesscomprehends. Therefore it turns blackness into brightness, burnsaway ‘all superfluities,’ and leaves behind nothing but ‘faecem et sco-riam et terram damnatam’ (dross and scoriae and the rejected earth).”1The process of burning away the inessential was part of the alchem-ical phenomenology of fire intended to bring about a purification. Thealchemists called the process calcinatio.Edinger dedicates a chapter of Anatomy of the Psycheto this procedure.

In one, the black matter is called “the Ethiopian.” Atext by fifteenth-century alchemist and astrologer Melchior says, “Thenwill appear in the bottom of the vessel the mighty Ethiopian.... Heasks to be buried, to be sprinkled with his own moisture and slowlycalcined till he shall rise in glowing form from the fierce fire.”6As noted, alchemical texts have traditionally spoken of this kind ofrenewal as a transition from the blackness of the nigredo to the white-ness of the albedo, but I believe we have to be careful not to interpretthis white outcome of the alchemical process in terms of literal colorsince there is a tendency in modern culture to see white and black asopposites. The whiteness of the albedo is simultaneously a develop-mental step in a series of alchemical processes andthe illuminatingquality intrinsic in the blackness of the nigredo process. The whitenessthat the alchemists speak of is not a whiteness separate from blackness.On the contrary, to understand the “renewal” that “follows” the ni-gredo, one must go beyond simple dichotomies and see into the com-plexity of the blackness itself.7“‘Putrefaction extends and continues even unto whiteness,’ saysFigulus.”8Hillman notes that the “shadow is not washed away andgone but is built into the psyche’s body,” which then exhibits its ownkind of lustration and contains both darkness and “light.”9It was a light Jung came to know in his alchemical studies. In anArabic treatise (1541) attributed to Hermes, the Tra ctatus Aureus,Mer-curius says: “I beget the light, but the darkness too is of my nature.”10In alchemy, light and dark and male and female are joined together inthe idea of the chemical marriage, and from the marriage (of light anddark) the filius philosophorumemerges, and a new light is born: “Theyembrace and the new light is begotten of them, which is like no otherlight in the whole world.”11This light is a central mystery of alchemy.Jung traces the idea of the filius—the child of the marriage of op-posites—to the archetypal image of the Primordial Man of Light, a vi-sion of the Self that is both light and dark, male and female.

Paracelsus also describes the Man ofLight, whose illumination is the result of the integration of opposites,as identical with the “astral” man. The astral, or primordial, man alsoexpresses our own archetypal possibility for illumination and wisdom:“The true man is the star in us. The star desires to drive men towardsgreat wisdom.”12It is interesting to see Derrida’s reading of solar mythology and theproblematics of illumination resonating with Jung’s thoughts aboutthe primordial man; both struggle with primary dichotomies and areconcerned with going beyond the literal nature of light to a more in-trinsic understanding. Derrida’s reading of solar mythology is morecomplex. He agrees with Jung that light should not be simply equatedwith the light of the sun but also linked to the light of enlightenment.Derrida also alludes to a metaphorical Sun that is associated with al-ternatives to the light of empiricist and other specular conceptions. Hespeaks of a light that is a “night light [which is a] supplement to day-light.”13In his commentary on Derrida, Martin Jay notes: “The sun isalso a star, after all, like all the other stars that appear only at night andare invisible during the day. As such it suggests a source of truth orproperness that was not available to the eye, at least at certain times.”14Derrida was aware that there were two suns, the literal sun and thePlatonic sun representing the Good. Derrida notes that, for Plato, theGood was a nocturnal source of all light—“the light of light beyondlight.” Following Bachelard and intimating a philosophical awarenessof Sol niger, Derrida also states that the heart of light is black. Plato’sSun “not only enlighten[s], it engenders. The good is the father of thevisible sun which provides living beings with ‘creation, growth andnourishment.’”15Jung, like Derrida, mentions two images of light: the great light andthe inner light of nature, an innerness that is also an outerness.16Thisdual vision is characteristic of the Primordial Man, whose light is ulti-mately the mundus imaginalis.17This, according to twentieth-centuryLumen Naturae(101)"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"French scholar, philosopher, and mystic Henri Corbin, must not be con-fused with the “imaginary” in our current understanding of the term.18The double nature of light is itself an archetypal theme along withthe invisibility of the so-called inner light. It is a light that is neithersimply subjective nor simply found in the outer world, in phenomena,or in our speech, but it “buildeth shapes in sleep from the power of theword” and can be found in dreams.19The attainment of this light was,for Paracelsus, his deepest and most secret passion. His whole creativeyearning belonged to the lumen naturae, a divine spark buried in thedarkness. The divine spark was, according to the alchemists, an ani-mating principle, “a natura abscondita(hidden nature) perceived onlyby the inward man.”20What Paracelsus called the “luminous vehicle,” neo-Platonic philo-sophers called the “subtle body,” or the soma pneumatikon,a paradox-ical term referring to an intermediate realm that “may be said withoutexaggeration to have been what might be called the very soul of astrol-ogy and alchemy.”21This hidden nature is essential in understandingSol niger.22The Subtle BodyImages of the subtle body have been known throughout history andacross cultures and have been discussed and imaged in a variety ofcontexts. From the Western astrological, kabbalistic, alchemical, her-metic, and magical traditions to Indian, Chinese, Buddhist, and Taoistones, imagining the subtle body has played an important role in med-ical, psychological, sexual, and sacred psychologies. For all of these tra-ditions, human beings constitute a microcosm, internally linked withthe larger universe, and are reflected in a body that is not simply ma-terial but also “subtle” and primordial.23Sanford L. Drob, a philosopher and psychologist who has writtenextensively on the kabbala, traces the emergence of the symbol of theprimordial man in a number of religious and philosophical traditionsfrom the Atman of the Upanishads to the macroanthropos of Plutarchfor whom “the sun is at the heart and the moon located between theheart and the belly.”24He notes that the Primordial Man is also impor-(102)Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"tant in Gnosticism: “In the Nag Hammadi text, the Apocryphon of John,we learn that this anthropos is the first... luminary of the heavens.”25The idea of the Primordial Man also appeared in the Jewish traditionfirst in the literature of “Merkavehmysticism.” Drob notes that the“clearest example of this is found in a work that he dates as “no laterthan the sixth century” titled Shi’ur Koma(the Measure of [the Divine]Body), “where the author seeks a vision of one ‘who sits upon thethrone,’ a gigantic supernal man who is imprinted with magical lettersand names.”26The one who sits on the throne was part of the ecstatic vision ofEzekiel’s chariot and was considered to be an “image” of God. Ezekieldescribes what he “sees” above the firmament: “and the likeness of thethrone was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above. And Isaw as the colour of electrum, as the appearance of fire round aboutenclosing it, from the appearance of his loins and upward . . . anddownward I saw as it were the appearance of fir e, and there was bright-ness round about him.”27Imagining the divine in human form presented a problem for someJewish thinkers. The twelfth-century, Jewish rationalist Maimonides“believed that the Shi’ur Koma was heretical and should be burned,”28but other authorities understood these images differently. Scholem, a scholar of Jewish mysticism and a colleague of Jung’s at the Eranoscircle, held that these images did “not imply that God himself had abody” but that a bodily form could be attributed to God’s “glory” orthe divine presence or “Shekinah.”29As Jewish mysticism developed,especially in Lurianic kabbala, the attempt to imagine the divine tookshape in the image of the Primordial Man, Adam Kadmon, who beganto be imagined in bodily form (figure 4.3a).30The body of Adam Kad-mon is considered to comprise ten sefirot, a kind of infrastructure offundamental archetypes linking God, human beings, and the world.31Sometimes the configuration of these structures is imagined in theform of a tree and at other times as comprising the structure of pri-mordial humans.In figure 4.3b, the archetypal structure shows itself in the spheres ofwisdom, intelligence, beauty, mercy, justice, foundation, honor, vic-tory, and kingdom, which are laid out according to a traditional pat-Lumen Naturae(103)"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"tern, constituting what has also been referred to as the Tree of Life.There have been many descriptions of and variations on both AdamKadmon and the Tree of Life in kabbalistic literature.32Adam Kadmon as Cosmic Man and an image of the subtle body hasalso been taken up in Christian kabbala. In this image of the head ofAdam Kadmon (figure 4.4), the skull is drawn in such a way as to re-veal roots as part of the brain structure, linking his subtle body withthe image of the tree.33From this head, a white light is said to “illumi-nate a hundred thousand worlds....

He writes: “The Kabbalistic Tree, when keyed to the hu-man body is known as the Adam Kadmon or . . . First Man, and de-notes the emanation of the highest spiritual world from above the headdown through the physical world at the feet.

Certain texts speak of 350,000 nadis, through which the so-lar and lunar energies flow” (figure 4.5).38In Praying(color plate 8), Grey depicts what he considers “the spir-itual core of light which transcends, unites, and manifests in the vari-ous religious paths.” Here again he blends the subtle body idea into a syncretist “portrait revealing a sun in the heart and mind.” “From theinner light in the center of the brain, a halo emanates and surroundsthe head. The halo is inscribed with signs of contemplation from six different paths”: Taoist, Hindu, Jewish, Tibetan, Christian, andIslamic.39Grey’s focus emphasizes the significant overlapping unity betweenthe variety of images of the subtle body. However, just as there are dif-ferences in the metapsychologies and individual experiences that pro-duced them, differences in general patterns and particulars also existwith regard to the chakras. Phillip Rawson notes that the “Tibetan Bud-dhists assert that there is a significant difference between their pat-tern of the subtle body and the normal Hindu one.”40These differencesare further compounded as we look at the various traditions we are dis-cussing. Yet, Grey is not wrong about the significant archetypal overlapbetween them.In color plate 9, which shows a traditional scroll painting from sev-enteenth-century Nepal, the ajna chakra is placed in a similar positionas Grey’s sun and is considered the third eye of wisdom. At the very top,not indicated in Grey’s image, are the male and female deities picturedin intimate embrace, signifying the interpenetration of opposite forces.In figure 4.6 we see a full body view of the chakra system. The ajnachakra is again pictured with male and female deities in an intimate re-lationship, and a number of different deities appear in each chakra. Attimes, some of these figures become standardized, but in other repre-sentations they change according to the individual, inward psychic ex-perience of yoga and Tantric practice.Rawson describes how, when “the subtle energy (Bodhicitta) be-comes united with the void of wisdom, the sky of the mind fills with in-finite visions and scenes.

The entire diagram isframed on the right by the spinal cord, which connects the lower torsowith the cranial cavity.”44Rousselle notes that on closer inspection, the whole image is a sym-bolic one and is in essence a diagram of the subtle body and a map of the transformation process of Taoist alchemy. The progression is“physical as well as spiritual. For the body must provide the vital forcethrough whose sublimation the spiritual, immortal man is born.”45Within this subtle body are several images based on alchemical prin-ciples. Taoist alchemy, known as inner alchemy (neidam), focuses onvisualization and the use of symbols in an effort to achieve purifica-tion, spiritual renewal, and union with the Tao.I particularly remember a section of Rousselle’s article dealing withinternal alchemy and Chinese medicine, in which he wrote, “In thedark firmament of our inner world the constellations of the microcosmand the genii or gods of our organs appear.” He is describing a systemof inner, nonliteral physiology, part of the magico-animistic system ofold Chinese cosmology, in which the human being is seen as a little cos-mos. Here the processes of transformation, circulation, and renewal aresymbolically described in great detail as a guide to the initiate’s searchfor eternal rejuvenation and the creation of the immortal Self.In this “inner world” one comes across the cave of the spirit field,the plowing of the earth, and a place where “the spring takes its Lumen Naturae(109)"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Figure 4.7.

The text is filled with provocative images of transfor-mational archetypes that have remained with me over the years.A few years ago I had an opportunity to lecture on Taoist alchemyand Jungian analysis in China. With these images in mind and my cur-rent work on Taoist alchemy in hand, I set out to find the monastery,the Taoist monks, and the Chinese doctors who might help to furtherelaborate this process.In Beijing I had a fruitful exchange with Li Chun-Yin, professor anddoctor in charge of the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Lielaborated on the complex interrelationships between emotions and“organs” that are reported to have physical, mental, and spiritual func-tions. She spoke about the process of healing and the use of dreams inher practice and offered examples.Later I went to the Temple of the White Clouds, where I found a copyof the stone rubbing Rousselle had earlier described. It was a movingexperience to arrive there where the work of internal alchemy had beenpracticed over the centuries. The famous poet Cha Shenxing of theQing Dynasty (1644–1911) described the temple in the following poem:The winter gravel path looks warm,At dusk the old temple is shady and cool.Falling leaves are crushed under my feet,The last sun rays linger in half the court.Grave the closed alchemical stove stands.Serene the stone ordination altar remains.So familiar seem the meritorious pillars.A fairy land indeed this is.47These images capture well the mysterious and legendary temple of thewhite clouds.48While at the temple, I also acquired a book on internal alchemy,which to my knowledge has not yet been translated into English.

The title was something like “The Main Purpose of Life”or “The Root of Life.” Years later Stephen Little published Taoism andthe Arts of China,which includes a few of the same drawings containedin the book I obtained at the White Cloud Monastery. It appears thatthe book is a copy of a 1615 text translated as Directions for Endowmentand Vitality.Little’s commentary states that the text, which is illustrated withmore than fifty diagrams, is a Ming dynasty treatise on inner alchemy.The breadth of the text and illustrations led Joseph Needham to call it“the Summaof physiological alchemy (Neidam).”49The discovery ofthis book and scroll led me to seek out a number of meetings withTaoist monks, many of whom were surprisingly willing to share some-thing of their esoteric practice and knowledge of this text and scroll.50For our purposes here, I focus on the birth of the spiritual embryoin the solar plexus. I have written about an analytic parallel to this alchemical process in an article titled “The Metaphor of Light andRenewal in Taoist Alchemy and Jungian Analysis.”51The solar plexus isan important area of subtle body theory and a center of vital force inTa o ist alchemy.In figure 4.8, from the text by Master Yin, one can see the impor-tance of this center and the dynamic energies that are activated in thealchemical process. The center is called the elixir field, and in this cen-ter a spiritual embryo is born, representing a newly rejuvenated life.The role of the spiritual embryo is similar to Western alchemy’s role ofthe filius philosophorum,which Jung discusses.In analytic practice as well as in Taoist alchemy, the psyche works toactivate this “elixir field.” Experiences similar to these images fromTaoist alchemy appear in analytic practice, but they do so in a highlyindividual way.

He brieflycomments on these images, noting how in this image, the “blackearth” that was previously far below his patient’s feet “is now in herbody as a black ball, in the region of the manipu ̄ra-chakra,which co-incides with the solar plexus.” In a surprising connection, Jung thenstates that the “alchemical parallel to this is the ‘black sun.’ This meansthat the dark principle, or shadow, has been integrated [lifted up] andis now felt as a kind of center in the body.”52Interestingly, Rebekah Kenton, who also has written about thesubtle body, notes in the same way that the sun continually radiates en-ergy to the planets, the manipura, or third chakra and distributes psy-chic energy throughout the entire human framework, regulating andenergizing the activity of various organ systems and processes of life.53She adds that the manipura (or Tiferet) is the self, the midpoint of thepsyche, so it is important not only with regard to the physical body butalso with regard to psychological and subtle body functioning. It is of-ten compared to the dazzling heat and power of the sun.As shown in the images Jung presents, the dark sun is linked to earthand shadow and to caput corviand the nigredo. Thus, Sol niger is herelifted to the center of the subtle body. While the dark sphere itself ap-pears inert, the power of Sol niger shows itself in the background andin the flowering tree of life emerging from the head.

She would open the book randomly, pointto a word, and consider it as a hint for further reflection. Prior to com-ing into analysis, she remembered pointing to a word and readingsomething about the “midnight sun.” The experience of a knotlikefeeling in her abdomen became more acute, and she represented it ina series of drawings (figure 4.11).As she progressed from the first image to the next, arrows pointedto this black center from all sides. In her analysis, she began to focus onthese interior feelings. Next, in another drawing not portrayed here,the dark center expanded, and her body seemed to encircle it. Handsappeared as if to grasp and reach inside this center. The figure’s eyeswere closed as if introvertedly looking down into this expanding dark-ness. The black-and-white, jesterlike hat on the head had tassels look-ing like miniature black suns.

Later a female figure emerged; herblack dress is mandala-like and reminiscent of the vaginal darkness ofthe prior image (figure 4.18b).In these images we see the continuing development of feminine sex-uality, which continues its awakening in the next image.

The male is “the redbird,” “the jade stalk,” “the coral stem,” “turtle-head,” “the heav-enly dragon pillar,” “the swelling mushroom.” The female is “the peach,” “the open peony blossom,” “the vermillion gate,”“the pink shell.” . . . Sexual intercourse itself is referred to as “thebursting of the clouds and the rain.” “Plum blossom” is a subjectpainted tens of thousands of times on beds, screens, and porce-lain—is actually a name for sexual pleasure.57For the Taoist, mutual sexual orgasm is the physical or poetic eventin which an important exchange takes place; the transference of yinand yang energies creates a valuable harmonization of the soul. Thiskind of intercourse can be seen as the cultivation of literal sexual actsin the inner realms of the subtle body, as in some forms of Taoistalchemy. Rawson notes that the inner alchemy of Taoism is closely re-lated to both Indian and Buddhist Tantrism. In Tantric Buddhism,sexual images also play an important role in symbolizing the union ofopposites. The term yabyumrefers to the divine ecstatic embrace ofmale and female figures, which at the highest level are said to link theforces of wisdom and compassion.In Western esotericism such processes are also known (e.g., in kab-balistic theory and in alchemy). Alchemically, such a process is knownas the coniunctioand in some contexts is thought to represent the cul-mination of the alchemical work. However, the alchemists made animportant distinction between the lesser and greater coniunctio. Thelesser coniunctio reflects a premature union of things that have not yetbeen thoroughly separated and properly integrated. Such “integra-tions” do not have the stability of the alchemical goal. Edinger notesthat in reality these two aspects are combined with each other. “Theexperience of the coniunctio is almost always a mixture of the lesserand the greater aspects.”58However, because of its instability, the lesserconiunctio is always followed by a death or mortificatio process. “Theproduct of the lesser coniunctio is pictured as killed, maimed, or frag-mented (an overlap with the solutioand mortificatiosymbolism).”59In the case we have been discussing, the pictured coniunctio of Asian(124)Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"lovers gave way to a mortificatio process. In the face of a troubled mar-riage, her personal attempt at integrating her feminine sexual identityand vitality was once again blocked and left her feeling trapped, unableto move forward in her life or her psyche. She felt again as if things werefalling apart and that she was facing an impenetrable darkness. Shefound herself once again in the midst of a nigredo. The loss of the pre-vious hopeful experience of awakening was excruciating.Entering into this darkness required tears of blood and beingstripped to the bone, but it was also a process in which she began to seea key that she hoped could unlock her blockages. She began to see whatwas behind this black door but was unsure whether it was a vision oflife or death (figure 4.20).Such images reflect an archetypal moment when we stand on thethreshold of our individuation and wonder whether going forward isgoing to lead to our demise. As she went more deeply into her uncer-tainty, the images of life and death appeared together as if they weretwo faces of the same skeletal body (figure 4.21). The outer garmentshave been shredded, and four strange monkeylike figures have ap-peared, one inside and three outside the door. At the bottom of thisdrawing a dreamer is shown with an illuminated orb around her head,and a butterfly, often an image of psyche, sits on her uplifted knee. Inthese images, the ambiguity of life and death is strong. One usuallyimagines dead figures as reclining and living ones as standing up. Here,as if in the underworld, this expectation is reversed. One might alsoimagine the female figure in deep meditation or dreaming and thescene we see above her as her dream or vision.The theme of the dreamer and the skeleton repeats in the next im-age, not included here. This time the pinkness returns in the orb sur-rounding the dreamer’s head and as some kind of shroud over theskeleton. It is hard to say exactly what is going on here, but the pink-ness seems to link the deep dream or meditation to death or to beingstripped bare.In figure 4.22, the dream of death theme seems to bear creative fruit.The pink orb has expanded into a large sphere of two concentric cir-cles in which a tree seems to be sprouting from the dreamer’s solarplexus.

As one moves outward into the second sphere, alone bird appears on the left; on the right, the area is primarily whitewith a touch of pink and black. The emergence of the tree and of bothblack-and-white birds are important alchemical themes.60In Psychology and Alchemy,Jung quotes the alchemist Khunrath,who states, “I pray you, look with the eyes of the mind at the little treeof the grain of wheat, regarding all its circumstances, so that you maybring us the tree of the philosophers to grow.”61For Jung, Khunrathseems to be pointing to the activation of the psyche through active imag-ination. Jung illustrates this using the image of “Adam as prima mate-ria,[whose side is] pierced by the arrow of Mercurius.[He is woundedand] the arbor philosphicais growing out of him” (figure 4.23a). Here,creativity, the flowering philosophical tree, is linked to wounding andthe mortificatio. It would appear that what is essential to the creativeflowering of the psyche is a wounding and a death of the old self, outof which emerges the new life. In this male version of the process, thetree emerges as a phallus.Jung also presents what he thinks is a female version of this process,reflected in the image of the mortificatio of Eve (figure 4.23b). In thisimage, the female’s figure points to the skull symbolizing the mortifi-catio. Here the tree grows out of Eve’s head.62In this case and other descriptions, wounding, death and creativity,and darkness and light are linked together. The flowering of the tree is also sometimes linked to the flight of birds and the freeing of thecreative spirit (as seen from Jung’s Alchemical Studies,reproduced asfigure 4.9 earlier in this chapter).63Birds further amplify this freedenergy, and in alchemy they appear as black or white or in some com-bination of these colors as seen both in my patient’s and Jung’s repre-sentations. Traditionally the transformation of a black to a white birdsignifies the alchemical albedo, a whitening process that suggests amovement of the psyche out of its dark and depressive leadened stateinto a reflective sublimation that lightens the soul and is thought tobring a greater sense of consciousness and freedom. It is a kind ofpurification process and catalyzes psychic development. A classical(128)Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Figure 4.22.

This theme, which continues through thenext several images, follows our exploration of the solar plexus in manysacred traditions. This representation of the philosophical tree devel-ops into the appearance of what Jung might call a philosophical animusfirst standing at her feet and subsequently expressing the creative en-ergy of the tree, his head rooted in her solar plexus (figure 4.24a and b).Along with the tree, the theme of the whitening birds and the albedo ispresent, indicating the upward movement of her psychic energy.My patient identified the figure as the philosopher Foucault, whosework is in part identified with passion, sexuality, and the politics of lib-eration and who further expresses the tree’s spiritual energy.

On the other hand, I believe it instead represented thedevelopment of an eroticized and spiritual unfolding that facilitatedrather than retarded her analytic process.The upside-down figure of the philosopher resembles the image ofthe hanged man in the tarot, an image that has been given many inter-pretations by various authors. At times, the tarot image signifies aturning point, linked to sacrifice and death, leading to a reversal of or-dinary consciousness; the aspirant becomes grounded in higher truthsthat come from above. Tarot authority Eden Gray links this reversal tothe recognition of “the utter dependency of the human personality onthe tree of Cosmic Life.”64For Jung, this turning point can be linked with the beginning of therelativization of the ego and the growing awareness of the Self. The im-age is related to a number of interpenetrating archetypal themes, in-cluding the growth of the filius philosophorum and the theme of theinverted tree (arbor inversa).Filius PhilosophorumWe have already discussed Jung’s idea that in alchemy, when light anddarkness and male and female come together, the filius philosopho-rum is born. This inner child or immortal fetus, a representation thatwe have seen in Taoist alchemy, also appeared in the visions of myanalysand. In figure 4.25a, a man or rabbi figure is standing on a Starof David, which consists of interlocking triangles symbolizing an inte-gration of opposites, above and below, light and darkness, male andfemale.Standing in this place of integration—or where the opposites areunified—implies both the sacred marriage and the birth of the im-mortal child whom, in this image, the wise old man carries close to hisheart.

He saidnothing to her, but she felt a silent connection of considerable depthwith this man.Her images of the wise old man also resonated with her developingfeelings in the transference. As we often sat in silence, she felt as if wetoo shared an unspoken mystery. Associating to the image, she felt thatthe old man was bringing her heart to her. The deep feelings of trans-ference were also captured in an important dream in which she foundherself giving birth to the moon.Lumen Naturae(133)Figure 4.25.

It is of interest to note that from this royalhouse a Messiah was expected to emerge, like the filius emerging fromthe opposites.69For my patient, one might say that such a savior comes in the formof this wise old man bringing her her heart, which he holds in themiddle of his chest. He is walking along a middle ground between mer-maid and lion, his feet planted on a river of voidness composed of theblack rays of Sol niger. It is a path not unlike the mystical middle pillarof the kabbalist that weaves its way between opposites. The middle pil-lar in kabbalistic thought is also referred to as the Tree of Life and is an essential representation of the unfolding of the soul. A variation onthe theme of the tree emphasizing spiritual and psychological develop-ment is archetypally portrayed in an inverted position with its rootsnot in the literal earth but in the heavens, linking it with the forcesabove.The Inverted TreeThe theme of the inverted tree has been richly amplified by Jung as wellas in an obscure but important article by Indian philosopher AnandaCoomaraswamy called “The Inverted Tree.”70Jung notes that “the tree[in general] symbolizes a living process as well as a process of enlight-enment.”71It signifies the creative unfolding of the soul, which can beexpressed intellectually but is not reducible to the intellect. Jung ampli-fies the idea of the inverted tree by citing a number of ancient thinkerswhose ideas are remarkably similar. Sixteenth-century alchemist Lau-rentious Ventura comments, “The roots of its ores are in the air and thesummits in the earth.” The fifteenth-century alchemical text Gloriamundi“likewise mentions that the philosophers had said that ‘the Lumen Naturae(135)"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"root of its minerals is in the air and its head in the earth.’”72Fifteenth-century alchemist George Ripley also says that “the tree has its roots inthe air, and, elsewhere, that it is rooted in the ‘glorified earth,’ in theearth of paradise, or in the future world.”73A rabbi, the son of Josephus Carnitolus, speaks of the inverted treewith regard to a kabbalistic vision noting, “the foundation of everylower structure is affixed above and its summit is here below, like an in-verted tree.” With regard to the kabbala, we have seen that the mysticaltree, as a tree of lights, also signifies man, who in Jewish thought “isimplanted in paradise by the roots of his hair, a reference to Song ofSongs.”74Plato’s Timaeus notes that “we are not an earthly but a heav-enly plant,” a “plant” the Hindus see as “pour[ing] down from above.”75Jung quotes from the Bhagavad-Gita:There is a fig treeIn ancient story,The giant Ashvetha,The everlasting,Rooted in heaven,Its branches earthward;Each of its leavesIs a song of the Vedas,And he who knows itKnows all the Vedas76In the preceding passage, the inverted tree refers to finding a sacredground above. It signifies a reversal and relativization of ordinary con-sciousness that equates with the activation of what Jung calls the reli-gious function.In my analysand’s next image (figure 4.26), two trees appear, onegrowing from the ground up and the other growing downward as ifrooted in the church above it. Although these two trees reflect an ar-chetypal process of the movement of the opposites, an effort to bringtogether both instinctual and religious dimensions of her psyche, theyalso capture the erotic energy of the transference that held both of(136)Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Figure 4.26.

Just beneath the mandala, two monkeys suggestthe presence of the animal instinct or spirit. Nearer the bottom anddeeper down, below the red roots another sun appears. It is as if, belowall of the blackness, another sky and another sun exist.Figure 4.27 seems to be an elaboration of the one just discussed butwith several changes. This time, the center of the illuminated mandalabursts into many colors, and a second church, or another vision of it,is shown in the center of the dark field in the middle of the page. Theentire church is in blackness. Under an arch at its bottom is a sunlikeorb in which we again see the image of the two women seen in thespires of the church of the previous image. Now, however, they are nowfacing in opposite directions and are joined together at the feet, as if to suggest a connection between them. Rather than merging into asimple unity, they have become connected, yet remain separate. At thispoint the process moves away from the theme of the inverted tree andtoward the work of differentiation and doubling.In addition to the two women facing in opposing directions, twolarge butterflies appear, one at the top and one at the bottom. Theirsize has dramatically increased from earlier images, perhaps corre-sponding to the growth of the psyche. The theme of doubling—twosuns, two trees, two women, and two butterflies—has become promi-nent, emphasizing the themes of both differentiation and sameness.Figure 4.28 picks up on this theme by depicting two forces with in-dependent centers. They are beginning to overlap but maintain theirseparateness. These energies are contained in larger egg-shaped, con-centric forms, suggesting the potential for new possibilities.

Each image once again emits an odd luminescence and aplay between light and dark. In the first one are five Sol niger images.Four of them appear on the bottom of the image as black holes withsun images partially illuminating them and the Earth around them.Over three of the illuminated black holes are butterflies and, as if outof the fourth, a masked female figure unfolds from a pale pink-and-green flower. A central dark sun is present in a black sky. One mighthere imagine that from the midst of Sol niger, a new psychic energyshows itself.Figure 4.31 is divided.

It is an undersea image, and a woman issurfacing like an underworld Aphrodite—the initial emergence of herembodiment.I end this series of images with one that appeared earlier in the anal-ysis but that, I believe, was a prefiguration of what might traditionallybe called a Self image that took on a lived form at this point. Figure 4.32is an image of a more integrated and peaceful woman standing in a poolof water, connected to the unconscious and the psyche. A snail andwhite flowers are scattered around the pool. It appears that the womanstands on a sphere similar to the one that surrounds her head like a halo.She stands in a dignified pose, bare breasted, and her skin is pink; hersexuality is expressed as a more natural dimension of her stance in theworld. The lower part of her body is wrapped in a black tunic. A but-terfly, a classic image of the psyche, appears almost as an adornment—pin or buckle—over the solar plexus area.

With this, the analysismoved toward ending. My analysand’s last statement remained un-clear; the feeling that this was not the end of the relationship seemedat the time to refer to her feeling that the inner work with the analystwould not stop with termination, but it also concerned me that thetransference aspect was not adequately resolved or the analyst figureintegrated. However, it was clear that she felt she had recovered some-thing that had been long lost, a comfortable stance in the world that in-cluded her sexuality, eros, and sense of feminine being and that herwork would go on independently of formal analysis.In this chapter we have explored the alchemical idea of the lumennaturae—the light of darkness itself—and amplified it by consideringtraditional images of the subtle body. We have shown how these ar-chetypal images continue to have dramatic resonances with the imagesthat emerge in contemporary analysis. The black sun is one such im-age that plays an important role in the transformation of psychic life.Although this chapter ends in a manner coherent with a traditionalconception of the Self, I have come to consider the black sun as an im-age of a non-Self that has helped me to reimagine my understandingof the Self as Jung has described it.Lumen Naturae(147)"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"chapter 5The Black SunArchetypal Image of the Non-SelfWhat is Divine Darkness?—Pseudo-Dionysus, The Mystical TheologyI begin with nothingness.

Like Jung’s idea of the Self, Sol niger also ex-presses a coincidentia oppositorum—a black sun that shines containsthe paradoxical play of light and dark, life and death, and spirit andmatter. For Jung, the sun was a “symbol of the source of life and the ul-timate wholeness of man” as indicated in the alchemical image of thesolificatio,a process that corresponds to enlightenment or illumina-tion.1In color plate 13, a seventeenth-century miniature, the solificatio"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"is represented as an alchemist whose body is “filled with light,” por-traying the ultimate goal of alchemy.2This represents one of the many important symbols of the Self.3However, for the sun to adequately express human wholeness, it can-not be only an ultimate image of light; it also must include darkness asan essential aspect of its nature. The black sun might well be consid-ered to express this paradoxical dimension of light and darkness andmight ultimately be understood as an archetype of the non-Self. Thisnon-Self should not be considered antithetical to the Self or as an in-dependent entity of any kind. Instead, it expresses a mysterious andparadoxical unknowing that was at the core of Jung’s original attemptto describe the ungraspable wholeness of the psyche.Like the sun, the Christ image represented the Self for Jung. He chosethe Christ figure because it is “the still living myth of our culture,” andmany significant images surround it.4Also like the sun, the Christ im-age became identified primarily with the “light.” In fact, the early Chris-tians had some difficulty in distinguishing the rising sun from Christ.5Jung states that Christ represents the “totality of a divine or heavenlykind, a glorified man, a son of God . . . unspotted of sin.”6Ye t for him,this concept lacks wholeness in the psychological sense. “As the Gnos-tics said, [he] has put aside his shadow, and thus leads a separate exis-tence which manifests itself in the coming of the antichrist.”7In otherwords, the principle of darkness has to manifest itself in some form.Jung realized this, as indicated in this statement concerning the Self.We cannot ignore the shadow that belongs to this figure of light andwithout which it lacks a body and therewith humanity. “Light andshadow form a paradoxical unity within the empirical self.”8For Jung, ultimately, the Christian concept becomes “hopelesslysplit into two irreconcilable halves: the last days bring about a meta-physical dualism, namely a final separation of the kingdom of heavenfrom the flaming world of damnation.”9An ideal spirituality strivingfor the heights is sure to clash with the materialistic earth-bound pas-sion of the modern world. In short, the Christ figure as an image of theSelf “lacks the shadow, which belongs to it.”10For Jung, the Self can neither be limited to images of light nor splitThe Black Sun(149)"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"offfrom its shadow. The Self is a “transcendent concept... that . . . ex-presses the sum of the conscious and unconscious contents” and assuch “can be described only in the form of antimony.”11“For this rea-son, [the process of ] individuation is a mysterium coniunctionis[amysterious conjunction of opposites], in that the Self is experienced ina nuptial union of opposite halves.”12The emergence of the Christfigure embodied the need to achieve this union, but for Jung the figurefalls short of the goal.13Jung’s last work, the Mysterium Coniunctionis: An Inquiry into theSeparation and Synthesis of Psychic Opposites in Alchemy,is dedicatedto the task of describing his idea of a mystical union. The union of op-posites is an attractive idea because it implies psychological wholeness,but the enormity of the struggle involved in any engagement withotherness and with the darkness of the unconscious has become lost asJung’s theories become assimilated and taken for granted. This pointof view has been expressed by Jungian analyst Neil Micklem, who em-phasizes the importance of paradox rather than unity and notes thatparadox usually gets glossed over as our attention moves toward themore attractive idea of the union of opposites.14The theme of the unityof opposites catches the attention of people because it “points in thedirection of wholeness,”15and the idea of wholeness can easily becomea shorthand way to pass over significant tensions. When this happens,the ideal of wholeness can lose its mystery and power and become acliché or caricature. Micklem writes, “As long as we are fixed on mak-ing whole we are likely to miss that paradox.”16Ye t, mystery and paradox are essential to understanding what Jungcalls the Self. For Jung, “paradox is characteristic of all transcendentalsituations.”17This is “because it alone gives adequate expression to theirindescribable nature.”18Wherever the archetype of the Self predomi-nates, there are always conflicting truths, and the history of reflectivephilosophical and religious thought is filled with diverse attempts toreconcile such differences. Just a few of these attempts include Bud-dhism’s middle way, Aristotle’s golden mean, the rational antinomiesof Kant, Hegel’s dialectic, Marx’s dialectical materialism, Freud’s erosand thanatos, Ricouer’s tension between suspicion and belief, and Der-rida’s différance, all of which struggle with the problem in their char-(150)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"acteristically different ways. For most of these, a simple rational mas-tery is not an adequate resolution to the problem of opposites, whichseems to require a continuing attempt to express the complexity of thesoul. Micklem writes that “Paradox enriches, because only paradoxcomes near to comprehending the fullness of life, and without it we areinwardly impoverished.... When we talk of paradox, we mean thepresence of any two conflicting truths present at the same time in con-sciousness.”19To hold two conflicting truths in consciousness at the same timecreates an enormous tension. When confronted with such a situation,most people try to alleviate the tension by merging the paradox into aunity of the same, but in fact each truth must be preserved and is inneed of careful differentiation until the transcendent function trulyproduces a symbolic solution. Symbols too easily become intellectualidealizations. To further illustrate the critique, Micklem points to theimage of the hermaphrodite in the last print of the Rosarium Philoso-phorumin Jung’s essay “The Psychology of Transference” and notes thatmost people simply see it as a symbol representing an integrated whole-ness without really letting themselves experience its grotesque andmonstrous character.20In short, for Micklem, the coniunctio,or rec-onciliation of opposites, is a monstrosity almost unbearable for theego to tolerate.21Ye t it is important to confront such an experience ifwe are to have any genuine recognition of the Self. The tensions we arespeaking about “destroy us, but they also make us,” and so we arecaught in a strange paradox.22Such a monstrosity is present in our ill-nesses and symptoms, and it is important not to turn away from it be-cause it is essential for any differentiated sense of wholeness beyondany idealized ego fantasy. As we have noted, for Jung even the Christfigure could not contain the darkest dimensions of psyche, and, at leastfor some Christian thinkers, the thought of linking Christ and anti-Christ in intimate connection is indeed a monstrous idea.The issue of monstrosity and the Christian psyche is also discussedby Edinger, who takes up the issue of what was left out of Christiansymbolism as it developed over the past two thousand years.23He turnsto the Reusner’s picture Pandora,which he believes contains the es-sence of alchemy and which, for Jung, was the carrier of those psycho-The Black Sun(151)"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"logical elements elided by Christianity and that served as a counter-balance to it.In figure 5.1 we see the assumption of Mary into heaven and hercoronation. In the lower part of the picture one can see what Edingercalls the birth of a monster. What is so shocking for Edinger is the juxta-position of the spiritual image of the assumption with “the image ofthe birth of a monster out of a lump of matter.”24The whole image re-flects the struggle to integrate both the feminine and the principle ofmateriality into the Christian vision. The image is monstrous to theChristian eye, and for Edinger the lower image of a birth from matteris “like a cuckoo’s egg that’s been laid in someone else’s nest.” The egghas been laid in the nest of the Christian vision, and “something un-expected is going to hatch out of it!”25Color plate 14 is an image of the unconscious reproduced fromJung’s Alchemical Studiesin the form of Mercurius, whose three extraheads represent Luna, Sol, and a coniunctio of Sol and Luna on the farright.26The unity of the three is symbolized by Hermes, who repre-sents the quaternity “in which the fourth is at the same time the unityof the three.”27This image captures the quality of paradox and mon-strosity stressed by Jung, Micklem, and Edinger. It is a symbolic unifi-cation but one not easily assimilable by the ego. This image may wellbe considered an example of a transformation going on in the God im-age of the Western psyche by virtue of the alchemical process that hasbeen inserted into it, a process that gives birth to new possibilities. Thenew God image heralds the importance not only of incorporating thefeminine and matter into our vision of spirit but also of “the discoveryof the unconscious and the process of individuation.”28On a personal level, it also signifies all of the struggles of incarnatedexistence: “every hard disagreeable fact” of ordinary life. Edinger usesthe eloquence of Shakespeare to describe the painful facts: “The slingsand arrows of outrageous fortune,... the whips and scorns of time,Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, the pangs of dis-priz’d love, the law’s delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns thatpatient merit of th’ unworthy takes, [leaving us] to grunt and sweat un-der a weary life.”29If one is honest, these insults of life cannot simply be passed over in(152)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"any idealized transcendence. Such experiences hurt, sting, enrage, andsometimes depress and kill us, and yet they must be acknowledged, ne-gotiated, and made conscious if any real awareness of the Self is to takeplace.Edinger notes, as Jung and Micklem have, that “the living experi-ence of the Self is a monstrosity. It’s a coming together of opposites thatappalls the ego and exposes it to anguish, demoralization, and viola-tion of all reasonable consideration.”30It is a violation of everything wehave come to expect as natural, reasonable, and normal. In figure 5.2,Edinger gives us a feeling for this in this image of the unity of oppo-sites. In alchemy, the monstrous aspect of the conjunction is particu-larly emphasized when the opposites that are brought together are notThe Black Sun(153)Figure 5.1.

And by monstrous, al-chemy means fruitless, barren, without issue.33To have a productive conjunction requires that, even when the bring-ing together of opposites is not dramatically monstrous, each figure ofthe pairing remains stubbornly different. Hillman thus describes whata conjunction is not: “It is not a balanced mixture, a composite addingthis to that; it is not a blending of substantial differences into a com-promise, an arrangement; it is not a symbolic putting together of twohalves or two things into a third.”34Here Hillman pushes forward our traditional Jungian idea of thesymbolic outcome of the transcendent function. He emphasizes thatthe stubborn resistance of differences and incommensurabilities maymean that paradox, absurdity, and overt enormity are more character-istic of a union than is androgynous wholeness or the harmony of theunus mundus,or unitary world. The alchemical conjunction beyondthese simple monstrums is more like an absurd pun or the joy of a jokethan the bliss of opposites transcended. As a psychological event ittakes place in the soul as a recognition, an insight, and an astonish-ment. “It is not the reconciliation of two differences, but the realizationthat differences are each imageswhich do not deny each other, opposeeach other, or even require each other.”35The quality of the conjunction that Hillman describes is capturedin the following poems, the first of which is said to summarize the op-erations of Taoist alchemy:Jadelike purity has left a secret of freedomIn the lower world:Congeal the Spirit in the lair of energy,And you’ll suddenly seeThe Black Sun(155)"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"White snow flying in mid summer.The sun blazing in the water at midnight.Going along harmoniously,Yo u roam in the heavensThen return to absorbThe virtues ofthe receptive.36In this image there is a harmony but also the jolting confrontationof differences: “white snow flying in mid Summer.” The second poemis an obscure haiku that humorously captures the subtlety of “the con-junction”:On how to singthe frog school and the skylark schoolare arguing.37In this instance, the frog and the skylark at one level are far apart, yetthey are both creatures that have a song, and from a certain perspec-tive they express the harmony of the universe.An even more enigmatic description is given by a female adept ofthe Complete Reality School (CRS) of Tao, Sun Bu-er, in her poem:At the right time, just out of the valleyYo u rise lightly into the spiritual fir mament.The jade girl rides a blue phoenix,The gold boy offers a scarlet peach.One strums a brocade lute amidst the flowers,One plays jewel pipes under the moon.One day immortal and mortal are separated,And you coolly cross the ocean.38In this enigmatic poem are many strange juxtapositions and hintsof a transcendence that do not reconcile the differences but allow themto stand together and nonetheless express an invisible alchemical con-junction that is quite astonishing. Though Micklem, Edinger, andHillman emphasize the monstrous and/or astonishing aspects of the(156)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"coniunctio, not every genuine experience of conjunction has this qual-ity. Consider this description in Cleary’s recent translation of the clas-sic Chinese alchemical text and meditation manual, The Secret of theGolden Flower:[O]nce the two things meet, they join inextricably, the livingmovement of creative energy now coming, now going, now float-ing, now sinking. In the basic chamber in oneself there is an un-graspable sense of vast space, beyond measure; and the wholebody feels wondrously light and buoyant. This is what is called‘clouds filling the thousand mountains.’ . . . [T]he coming andgoing is traceless, the floating and sinking are indiscernible. Thechannels are stilled, energy stops: this is the true intercourse.This is what is called ‘the moon steeped in myriad waters.’39Here is another description emphasizing the vital pleasures ofunion: “The pores are like after a bath, the bones and circulatory systemare like when fast asleep, the vitality and spirit are like husband and wifein blissful embrace, the earthly and heavenly souls are like child andmother remembering their love.”40A humorous example of seeking an invisible harmony in learninghow to paint occurs in a book by Oscar Mandel.41The author creates ascene in which young Chi Po—the main character—approaches histeacher, Bu Fu, for his first lesson. The fictional character of Chi Po isbased on one of China’s great painters, Chi Po Shih. The account goesas follows:“Young one,” said Bu Fu at the beginning of the first lesson,“though I am a sorcerer, we must begin at the beginning.” “Andwhat’s the beginning?” said Chi Po. “Tell me, my foolish piece ofyouth, if your mother and father could give you anything you de-sired, what things would you ask them for?” That was a questionChi Po had often dreamed of himself, and had answered, too, inhis dreams. So he replied without hesitation: “A new hoop, a dogfrom Peking, strawberries and whipped cream every afternoon,and two rocking chairs, one for Father and one for Mother, be-The Black Sun(157)"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"cause they have always wanted rocking chairs.” “Now sit at thedoor of my cave,” said Bu Fu, “and watch the sky and the trees,and watch above all the wind and the destruction of the clouds,and watch the squirrels and the conies, and dream of the brushand of your hand which will sweep over the silk of your nextpainting.” With this, Bu Fu pronounced several frightful incan-tations, and abandoning Chi Po at the mouth of the cave, hewent gathering acorns. Only the bulbul remained with Chi. Hesat on a branch where he could watch the newcomer, and youcould see by the tilt of his head and the angle of his beak that hedoubted whether Chi could doit. And it wasn’t easy. Now that BuFu had reminded him of the new hoop and the strawberries, ChiPo found it hard to send his thoughts into the trees and to keephis eye on the destruction of the clouds. But the afternoon waswarm, and Chi settled drowsily with his back to the cave, chew-ing on a pine needle as he sat. He watched a cloud leave the topof a cedar and edge cautiously over to the top of another cedar.“Like a tightrope walker,” thought Chi. And then he heard thewind: well now, it ooooed against the rocks, and frushled amongthe leaves, and tickled in the pines, and it just went loose abovethe earth. And on top of the wind went the snitting of the spar-rows, the wild geese, the magpies, and above all, the lilling of thescarlet throated winch, and “Oh,” thought Chi Po, “the treble ofthe birds and the bass of the wind—the high of the mountainand the low of the river—the king and the slave—father andboy—above and below—spring and winter,” and on he went inthis way, delighted with his discovery and getting drowsy indeed,while the bulbul watched him out of his single eye. “Young one,”said Bu Fu, returning with acorns, “what is on your mind?”“Oh,” said Chi Po, a little ashamed, “nothing.” “Excellent, su-preme,” cried Bu Fu, his beard quivering. “You have had yourfirst lesson. Now go home, because I have work in hand. Comeback tomorrow. If your mind is still free of that clutter of straw-berries and rocking chairs, I will allow you to paint a single drag-onfly on a single lotus flower. Offthen!” . . . “So,” said Bu Fu thenext day, when Chi Po came puffing up to the cave, “what of the(158)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"clutter?” “I hope it is still gone, sir,” answered Chi Po. “May I trythe dragonfly, please?” “And the lotus blossom. Yes you may.”And Bu Fu told Chi Po why a dragonfly needs a flower, and whya flower needs a dragonfly, for the one stays in the ground andrises from the ground upward, while the other moves about anddescends from the sky downward. “Therefore” said Chi Po, “Imust paint them where they meet, where down flows into up andup flows into down.”42Engaging the MonstrousWe have been looking at poems and stories that portray the subtlestlevels of the coniunctio as a traceless union referring to a seamless one-ness. However, it is also vital that we not fall into an intellectual ideal-ism and that we keep in mind the astute observations of Micklem,Edinger, and Hillman so that we do not bypass the more beastly aspectsof the unconscious, of which clinical material is a constant reminder.The strangeness and difficulty of engaging the monstrous comes inmany different forms. Working with the darkness of the unconsciousis exemplified in two very different but related examples; the first is ofa psychologist who, in remarkable dreams, discovers an image of Solniger:I am home sitting in an armchair. I realize there’s a pimple on thesole of my left foot. I flip my foot over in such a way that I cantake a closer look at the pimple. I turn my sight away on myright-hand side to fetch a tissue to clean my foot, and when I lookback again, the black liquid has gone back into the pimple. I’mthinking “Oh, that’s odd,” so I press again and this time threeblack liquid traces come out of the pimple.... I quickly grabthem; they have an elastic texture. I try to pull them out, but theyare more deeply and firmly rooted than I thought. I don’t under-stand, so I look closer, bending my head as close as I can to myfoot.

What at first appears to him is a little blemish on thesole/soul of his foot. The sound connection of sole and soul is oftenuseful in entering into the inner meaning and site of the dream. Whatis going on is not simply in his literal foot but also in his dream orsubtle body. Something is appearing in a critical place in the soul, aplace that grounds and links him to Earth, to the place he stands on,his foundation. Although what’s going on at this site seems just a smallthing, the dream ego flips itself over to take a closer look. This gesturein dreams is quite common; a second look reflects a movement towardconsciousness and shows something more to the dreamer than is avail-able at a causal first glance. The dream ego applies some pressure tothis blemish as if to squeeze out something that is under the surface.From this point, a black liquid like a filament starts to flow out. Whenthe dream ego turns away with the intent of just wiping it away, theblackness disappears under the surface as is often the case when deal-ing with unconscious contents. This dreamer remains curious andpresses forward again. As he does so, the blackness reappears and mul-tiplies threefold. He now tries to grab hold of it, and as he does so, itbecomes more solid and has an elastic texture.He then tries to eliminate it by pulling it out of his body but discov-ers that it is more deeply and firmly rooted than he had thought. Onceagain, this kind of image is not uncommon in dreams. I have seen it ona number of occasions in which dreamers are trying to pull somethingout of their mouth, only to discover that it is fastened deeply within thebody and cannot be pulled out. Sometimes this refers to an inability toThe Black Sun(161)"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"say something that one is having a hard time expressing. The intensityof a conflict keeps it deeply connected to the body and the uncon-scious. For this dreamer, there seems to be a continuing desire to be ridof this black stuffbut a more than equal desire to understand some-thing about the darkness within.He brings his head down to his foot, signifying a change in per-spective, a descent of the head to the lowest part of the body, a comingdown of consciousness to see what is going on at the place of thesoul/sole and of blackness. As he does so, he discovers something thathe had not seen before: The pimple is not just a pimple any longer buthas become a hole, actually several holes, through which he discoverssomething alive and breathing. The dreamer’s persistent desire to seewhat is going on is met by the subtle body becoming transparent. Hecan now see inside. Black filaments are everywhere, and he sees a blackbeast living inside himself.As one might imagine, to discover this kind of unknown Othernessinside of oneself, as part of oneself, is terrifying and monstrous. Yet thedreamer continues to try to determine where all this is leading. He fol-lows the blackness in its spiderlike intricacy throughout his wholebody, which is now transparent. This web of tentacles has spread every-where inside him. The change from casual curiosity to existential fearprovokes a desire to get to the bottom of things, to the origin and sourceof the blackness itself. The source is discovered in the solar plexus, aplace where, in literal physiology, a large network of sympathetic nervesand ganglia meet behind the stomach and form a hard, sunlike center.In our dreamer these nerves appear as black tentacles, creating whatone might possibly imagine as a black sun center in the pit of the stom-ach. Here an important vision occurs; the dark center appears as ablack head that has eyes and can see and speak to him. For the first timehe addresses this darkness and meets it head to head as if engaged in aspontaneous active imagination.There is a long tradition of head symbolism in alchemy and early lit-erature, linking it both to the nigredo experience and to our humanpotential for transformation. Edinger believes that “one reason seemsto be the connection between the term ‘head’ and top or beginning.Blackness was considered to be the starting point of the [alchemical](162)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"work.”43Edinger notes that the head also symbolizes the rotundum,theround, complete man. The separated head and symbolism of behead-ing reflect this wholeness as extracted from the empirical man. “Thehead or skull becomes the round vessel of transformation. In one text itwas the head of the black Osiris or Ethiopian that, when boiled, turnedinto gold.”44For our dreamer, the head takes on a less fearsome quality and stim-ulates sweet memories of childhood, but it also becomes a paradoxicalinterlocutor. The dreamer asks, “What are you doing here?” “You calledme,” he/she answers, “I serve you and I don’t serve you.” These para-doxical responses make clear that the black head is duplex and mercu-rial and reflects the complexity of the unconscious psyche, which isboth trickster and guide. It is both male and female; it serves the ego andyet doesn’t serve the ego. In this sense one might imagine this head as aprefiguration of the Self or of the whole man, which is never simply asweet experience.What can it mean that the head “serves and doesn’t serve”? Jungpoignantly expresses this paradox when he says, “The experience of theSelf is always a defeat for the ego.”45Moreover, the oracular headsymbolizes the consulting of one’s wholeness for information beyondthe ego.46In this sense the black head and/or skull is a signifier of thememento mori, the existential knowledge of our own death. Edingerstates that it is “an emblem for the operation of mortificatio.It gener-ates reflections on one’s personal mortality and serves as a touchstonefor true and false values. To reflect on death can lead one to view life un-der the aspect of eternity, and thus, the black death head can turn togold.”47In confrontation with the life of the psyche, the paradoxical truth isthat such engagement brings both defeat and transformation, deathand new life. This ‘truth’ is difficult to assimilate, if it can be said to be“assimilable” at all. Perhaps it is better to say it is the ego that is assim-ilated, not into the unconscious but into the larger life of the soul, amove that, as Hillman has said, “places man within psyche (rather thanpsyche within man).”48Such a process feels like a great danger to the ego, as if it is in dangerof dying. This anxiety leads the dreamer to a medical doctor who indi-The Black Sun(163)"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"cates that in these matters he is not competent. So one might imaginethat what the dreamer is dealing with is not in the realm of the “med-ical body.” Next, the dreamer goes to see his analyst, but the analyst nolonger occupies the same place as he once did; his space has becomeoccupied by an alchemist. For the dreamer, it appears that the psyche issuggesting that help is not to be found in the realm of either medicineor psychoanalysis.So, the psyche places the dreamer into connection with an alchem-ist, with memory, image, and death within his own soul as he recallsthe man who had introduced him to the “black land” and who diedseveral years ago.49The dreamer feels touched and full of respect andnow asks an important question, “What am I doing here?” With this,a deeper dialogue is initiated with the alchemist, who calls him byname and tells him that he is here to see the silence. This is a statementof the phenomenon of synaesthesia. Synaesthesiais traditionally under-stood as a condition in which “one type of stimulation evokes the stim-ulation of another.”50It takes the dreamer out of his experience of theordinary, empirical world and returns him to one in which silence isnot simply heard, but also seen.Merleau-Ponty notes that from this perspective, the “objectiveworld... and the objective body with its separate organs . . . is [often feltto be] paradoxical.”51The phenomenon of synaesthetic experience israther common, but we have lost sight of it because immersion in a sci-entific Weltanschauung has “shift[ed] the center of gravity of experienceso that we have unlearned how to see, hear, and generally speaking,feel.”52We have left our “natural lived bodies” and deduced from ourbodily organization a way of experiencing that is modeled on the physi-cist’s conception of the world of perception.If Merleau-Ponty is correct, it is not surprising why knowledge ofthe objective medical body is inadequate to understand the dreamer’sexperiences. From this perspective, sight and hearing in our everydayconstructed mode are not fundamental in our experience. Might weimagine, then, that the alchemist is pointing our dreamer toward a re-turn to both a more primordial way of seeing and to the lived ratherthan the objectified body?For Merleau-Ponty, the “lived body” refers to something quite dif-(164)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"ferent from the “body” seen as an object of mechanistic physiology orof classical psychology. For him, as for our dreamer, biology and psy-chology are not the sources of the deepest understanding of our hu-man existence. Rather, Merleau-Ponty speaks of a reawakening of ourfundamental ground and of the strangeness and miracle of perception.Such a strange “perception” occurs in our dreamer. As the alchemistleads him down a corridor, he is ecstatic and has a feeling of content-ment, grace, and joy. He feels like thanking God. The dream ends withthe alchemist opening the door to a final complex, luminous, and mys-terious vision—a mobile of the sun and moon.The theme of the juxtaposed sun and the moon is common inalchemy and psychologically represents the tension and/or play of theopposites—of day and night, rational and irrational, conscious andunconscious. In figure 5.3, opposite flames are held by the male and thefemale and merge in the alchemist’s flask. The sun and the moon ap-pear above the flask. Fabricius writes below the image, “Lighting thefire of oneness in a furrow between two waves of the mercurial sea.”53Thus, we might imagine that part of our dreamer’s vision has to dowith the bringing together of the so-called opposites reflected in thedual snakes entwined around the caduceus near the right knee of thekneeling figure. The sun and moon perspectives are further differen-tiated by the images of the solar ax and Foucault’s pendulum in thedream. The individual symbolism of the dreamer complicates the tra-ditional images of the sun and the moon and gives them further artic-ulation, truly creating a complexio oppositorum,similar to the tensionin the alchemical engravings reproduced earlier.The alchemist here opens a way for the dreamer to contemplate avision of the “opposites” suspended on a mobile, which holds a coin-cidence of sun and moon, light and darkness. These images hangtogether in a mysterious suspension, appearing at the end of thedreamer’s journey as if responding to the unanswered questioning atthe core of blackness itself. The images of the solar ax and Foucault’spendulum add to the mystery of this final image, but here I commentonly on the notion of the mobile itself.The mobile is a term said to be coined by artist Marcel Duchamp in1932 to describe the kinetic sculptures of Alexander Calder, who wasThe Black Sun(165)"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Figure 5.3.

Jean-Paul Sartre, the existentialist philoso-pher and writer, wrote the following of Calder’s invention:A mobile does not suggest anything: it captures genuine livingmovement and shapes them [sic]. Mobiles have no meaning,make you think of nothing but themselves. They are, that isall.... There is more of the unpredictable about them than inany other human creation.... They are nevertheless at oncelyrical inventions, technical contributions of an almost mathe-matical quality and sensitive symbols of nature.54The mobile might well be imagined as another provocative modelof the Self. Sun and moon are not joined into any fusion, but each im-age has its distinctive place. They hang together in a strange balance,turning according to the movement of the universe, suspended as iffrom some transcendental and invisible point above, as reflected in thepatient’s dream.Many of the themes that we have been discussing are expressed inthis single dream. In it we find examples of the subtle-body process,the monstrous dark sun, the solar plexus, alchemical transformation,the nigredo, the mortificatio, and the Self. We see the process of psy-chic transformation expressed as the dream ego engages the darknessof the psyche and leads toward an enigmatic and symbolic vision thatdeepens his psychic life.Now we look at a more extensive case vignette, in which the blacksun plays a prominent role. In it a pastoral counselor struggles withthis image and is thrown into an encounter with psychic realities thatchallenge his worldview. The pastor whose work I am about to de-scribe became aware of my research and offered to tell me about hisexperiences. We corresponded for a little more than three months,during which time he elaborated his struggle with Sol niger and his de-veloping understanding of the image. His first experience with theblack sun was in the context of his ongoing Jungian analysis. The im-age of Sol niger emerged in an active imagination. He drew a pictureof it (figure 5.4). In the drawing, there are two human figures; he is onthe left, and a slightly larger figure of a cowboy is on right.

He felt that there was some link be-tween his depression and the image of the black sun that appeared inhis vision. Shortly after he had the experience of the image, things be-gan to shift in his life.He left the institution where he was doing chaplaincy work. He sep-arated from his wife of seventeen years (a marriage that had long-standing problems) and was soon to leave his analysis as well. He wasworking and living alone for the first time in his life, and his depres-sion continued to worsen. When he told this to his analyst, the analystsaid, “No, you aren’t getting worse; you’re getting better.” Because hedidn’t believe that the analyst understood his angst over his depres-sion, he left analysis. He felt that he had to get away from the analyst toliterally save his life.(168)Chapter 5Figure 5.4. Black sun image. Artwork by analysand. Used by permission."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"He struggled with the depression for another year and a half withhelp from another therapist, medication, and a group he was in butfinally reached the point where he was simply not functioning. He wentinto a hospital during the next year for a total of eight months, was dis-charged, and gradually began to put his life back in order. Followinghis hospitalization, he struggled with many aspects of Sol niger in-cluding a masculine-feminine split and issues of the heart, death, sui-cide, and obsessionality as well as with what he called a black hole andspiritual transformation.One of the first things he did upon visualizing the image of the blacksun was to look through Jung’s works for references. One particularpassage impressed him immediately, though it was not until a gooddeal later that he started to experience what his intuition told him wasimportant. This is the passage he found:Despite all attempts at denial and obfuscation there is an uncon-scious factor, a black sun, which is responsible for the surprisinglycommon phenomenon of masculine split-mindedness, when theright hand mustn’t know what the left is doing. The split in themasculine psyche and the regular darkening of the moon inwoman together explain the remarkable fact that the woman isaccused of all darkness in a man, while he himself basks in thethought that he is a veritable fount of vitality and illumination forall the females in his environment. Actually, he would be betteradvised to shroud the brilliance of his mind in the profoundestdoubt.55His personal experience strongly resonated with Jung’s description,and he wrote in a letter:My relationships with women have never been particularly sat-isfactory. I like women and get along well as friends and col-leagues, but intimacy has been difficult. This was the case in mymarriage, and in the couple of relationships I have been involvedwith since then. Since dealing with the black sun, I have recog-The Black Sun(169)"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"nized a lot in myself that the Jung passage implies, and have cometo see that this has been at least part of what has been at the heartof my difficulties with women.There were several things that the pastor was almost entirely un-aware of before his experience of the black sun. One was his tendencyto blame women for his problems. He had done this for years, and eventhough women, including his former wife, complained about the kindof superiority, hostility, and condescension that can come from suchan attitude, he simply could never see it. He always felt himself to be inthe right and usually wondered what in the world was wrong withthem that they could not see it the way he did. However, he did havethe insight that a lot of his feeling life had been deeply buried for a longtime. He began to sense that the feelings of which he was unaware weremanifested in the ways he experienced and dealt with women. For ex-ample, he writes that he had been guilty sometimes of falling into anautomatic teaching/lecturing posture with women. He then becameaware that this was set offwhen women expressed their ideas throughfeelings. It was as if he then had to counter this with his “superior” in-tellect because he could not deal with it on the feeling level. He realizedthat he believed that a woman’s feelings were inferior and that sheneeded his bright intellect to enlighten her. For him, feeling was partof the unknown and thus part of the black sun, which he feared.The pastor reflected that in relation to the black sun, whatever itsultimate significance, a man needs somehow to come to terms withthese feelings of superiority in order to also be aware of the duality inhimself. If a man can do this, then he might not have to project the un-seen aspect onto a woman, a displacement that had occurred not onlyfor himself but also for other men with whom he had worked profes-sionally or who were his friends and colleagues. While he knew thiskind of attitude could be very hard to make conscious, he never reallybelieved that it was buried in him. According to Jung, men often pre-fer to see their thinking associated with the light of consciousness, and thus it is very easy for them to project their own dark moods andthoughts upon women.Although the pastor did not think of it in this context, after writing(170)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"to me about the preceding observations, he recalled an earlier en-counter with the theme of Sol niger and the heart. One day he had de-veloped a pain around his heart and had gone to the emergency roomat a hospital, but the doctors found nothing physically wrong. Oneweek from that day, the same thing happened, and he went back to thehospital, and again nothing was found. When he next went to see hisanalyst and told him what had happened, the analyst suggested thatsince nothing physical was found, the problem must lie elsewhere. Hesuggested that the pastor do some active imagination in relationship tothe heart to see what might happen. For fourteen days in a row, he ac-tively imagined what was going on in his heart, and each time he drewa picture of what he had “seen.”He came to relate what he had considered his masculine-femininesplit to problems of the heart that he traced back to wounds associatedwith his father. As he meditated and actively imagined what was goingon inside his heart, he saw an angry fist, a crowbar, a large black stakepiercing his heart, and later a large black iron ball that later he had iden-tified with the black sun. He speculated on the relationship betweendepression and heart disease and commented that it cannot be healthyto carry around a twenty-four-pound ball of iron in your heart.The work with active imagination eventually led him to a healingprocess: images of a surgical procedure and the extraction of the ironball, a black snake with green vegetation leading the way to the emer-gence of blue waters and a dolphin accompanying a small sailboat inthe final picture of the series. The image that most struck him, how-ever, was the black iron ball that had emerged and was now outside.Although there was a healing of the heart, this image pointed to some-thing outside of himself and outside the realm of consciousness. Forhim it was some darker expression of the soul—instinctual, emo-tional, symbolic, and archetypal. At its core the darkness of this otherwas uncanny and strange and perhaps even unknowable, he thought.It could have devastating consequences, physiologically and in his re-lationships, and it was as unrecognized as a black hole.The theme of a black hole became important to him as an “outerimage” that helped him to grapple with his inner darkness. Just be-coming aware that such things exist in the universe helped him whenThe Black Sun(171)"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"he felt he was losing his sanity or even “becoming a bit psychotic.” Hebegan to do some spontaneous active imagination on the model of ablack hole. He writes that when he was in the throes of the depression,he would draw a blackened circle on a piece of paper. Then, when helooked at it and realized what he had drawn, he was horrified by it. Itwas as if it was able to draw attention and consciousness right downinto it. As he thought more about what black holes are, he was able tosee that they did exactly the same thing in the outer universe that theinner image had been doing to him. Black holes are so dense that nolight escapes them. There were times when his depression felt exactlylike that. In addition he had the sense that he could literally be pulleddown into this thing and lost, in just the way things do not come outof black holes, at least not where they went in.At one point, the pastor’s concerns turned toward death, and hereflected on it as it appeared in his depressive states. He connecteddeath with the black sun. He noted that the primary way that thoughtsabout death entered in was with the preoccupation that he was goingto die. The pattern was that the death thought would be most promi-nent from the morning into the early evening, but through the lateevening it would subside completely. He would then go to bed some-what peacefully, and then in the morning, it would start again. Thiscontinued over a three-year period. Every morning for three years, hewoke with the same concern about death. During that whole time, notonce did it make any difference on any of those mornings that he knewthe fear had subsided the night before and had done so every time.Every single day was a repeat of the identical pattern, seemingly dis-connected from the day before.Although he felt that the ultimate significance of his death thoughtswas symbolic, for a long time he experienced the thought on a literallevel. It took the form of preoccupation with his actual death. “I don’tknow when that awareness [of the literal quality of these thoughts] be-gan to change, but it did. I think it changed a good deal in relationshipto the spiritual changes which eventually came” through a kind ofdeath/rebirth process. In studying the material on the tomb of RamsesVI, he was struck by the following phrase: “the rebirth of the sun atdawn after its night-time netherworld journey, the resurrection of the(172)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"king after his dark and difficult passage through the underworld fol-lowing his death, and the emergence of a higher level of consciousnessafter the arduous and often terrifying examination.” He felt this welldescribed what he went through: “I think I have had to live with theblack sun for these past years to get ready to deal with the furthermeaning.... There is work to be done, though. I think part of it willbe more precise thinking and amplifications regarding the black sun.In other words, there is still unanswered somewhat the question, ‘Whythe black sun?’ ‘Why a black sun?’ ”It was a question the pastor knew could never be fully answeredthrough analysis or therapy. He noted that his dark experiences, likethe sun, had an incredible, seemingly inexhaustible energy. Probablythe most significant thing for him with regard to the whole experienceis that it eventually led him to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church.He had previously been ordained as a Protestant minister for twenty-three years. He felt that because of the depth to which the whole expe-rience of the depression and the black sun took him, it ultimatelyresulted in a spiritual revolution. Since becoming Russian Orthodoxseven years ago, he has continued to understand some things throughthe spirituality of that tradition that continued the theme of the blacksun. He began to offer a number of reflections on the relationship ofthe black sun and the dark side of God. He stated that,In Orthodoxy, it is common to think about God both in terms of“positive” and “negative” theology. This is not unique to Ortho-doxy either. The positive theology involves those clear affirma-tions we are willing to make about God; that God is love, that Godis omnipresent, etc. The negative theology proceeds in a dif-ferent way and basically is the encounter with God through theexperience of being stripped of our delusions and illusions aboutGod and ourselves. My sense is that this corresponds more to theidea of the “essence” of God.Now, with all said, the place I am coming to in regard to Solniger is to say that what it has of God in it is close to this dark,mysterious aspect of God. One way that I have seen that has beenin terms of the change which I experienced in relation to the im-The Black Sun(173)"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"age. Initially, it was terrifying and something that I wanted to fleebut could not.Sol niger and the depression made him aware of things that had tobe faced and dealt with on the psychological level. At the same time,however, he had come to see that all of these factors needed spiritualwork as well. In other words, what Sol niger and the depression revealedto him about his soul, he had come to see in his relationship to God aswell. While this might sound strange, if the psychological and the spir-itual are different but intimately related dimensions, then each willneed its own kind of work.The pastor found that Orthodoxy offers a form of meditative prayerknown as hesycham,a term that means solitude or quietness and thatwas first used by St. Gregory Palamas in the fourteenth century. It hasto do with what was described as an “uncreated light.” This form ofprayer uses the “Jesus Prayer,” which leads to the “direct perception” ofGod and the things of God. The uncreated light is also called the “Ta-borian light” because it is the light that shone forth from Christ at histransfiguration on Mount Tabor. It is a light that comes from God andis not a created light like other light, such as that from the daytime sun.Other saints have reportedly actually shone forth with this light, whichis exceedingly brilliant. He sometimes wondered whether that uncre-ated light might not in some way be connected with the dazzling lightthat proceeds from Sol niger.The pastor and I had discussed the work of Julia Kristeva, and he feltthat his idea is amplified in her work when she says, “The ‘black sun’again takes up the semantic field of ‘saturnine,’ but pulls it inside out,like a glove: darkness flashes as a solar light, which nevertheless re-mains dazzling with black invisibility.”56However, for Kristeva, Solniger seems to remain tied to states of depression. The pastor reflected,“In this is seen again the paradoxical notion of light (‘dazzling,’ ‘flashes’)in the black darkness (‘black invisibility’). Ever since the Sol niger be-gan to take on some positive characteristics, this has been my intuitionabout it—that it is dark but light giving.”For the pastor, the reconciliation of light and darkness is captured(174)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"in The Orthodox Wayby Kallistos Ware, who talks about negative the-ology:And so it proves to be for each one who follows the spiritual Way.We go out from the known into the unknown, we advancefromlight into darkness. We do not simply proceed from the darkness ofignorance to the light of knowledge, but we go forward from thelight of partial knowledge into a greater knowledge which is somuch more profound that it can only be described as the “darknessof unknowing.”(emphasis added by the pastor)57Though this is clearly a statement about spiritual awareness, it is interesting that the darkness is actually seen as an “advance” over lightand a “greater knowledge” than the light of “partial knowledge.”In reflecting on the pastor’s experience, one might imagine an indi-viduation process and the spiritual telos of his depression, leading toan integration of both his personal and archetypal shadow. Such anintegration might be said to have constellated a well-integrated Self,healing a split in his masculine consciousness and ultimately openinghim to an experience of a numinous, dark God image at the core of hisnew faith. His process “ends” with the creation of an important imagerelevant to our experience of Sol niger, with a darkness of unknowing,which is strangely described as an advance over light and as a blinding,divine darkness. This “image” of divine darkness is a well-known as-pect of mystical theology.Mystical TheologyThe theology of the fifth- or sixth-century mystical philosopher Pseudo-Dionysius further amplifies Sol niger in its luminescent aspect. Manyhave come to discern in his writing the hand of a brilliant epistemolo-gist, an early philosopher of language, a Socrates-like teacher, and amystical theologian. Perhaps the best designation of Pseudo-Dionysiusis the one underlined by twentieth-century philosopher and theologianEdith Stein: “Father of Mysticism.” For Stein, his theology representsThe Black Sun(175)"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"the highest stage of “secret revelation,” and she notes that “the higherthe knowledge, the darker and more mysterious it is, the less it can beput into words.” In short, “the ascent to God is an ascent into darknessand silence.”58In his letters, Pseudo-Dionysius writes “The divine darkness is that‘unapproachable light’ where God is said to live.”59In another place he writes, “The pure, absolute and immutable mys-teries of theology are veiled in the dazzling obscurity of the secret Si-lence, outshining all brilliance with the intensity of their Darkness.”60His Mystical Theologyhas been considered to exemplify the Dionysianmethod and to be a key to the structure of the entire corpus.61Pseudo-Dionysius begins with the question What is Divine darkness? and re-sponds that Divine darkness “is made manifest only to those who travelthrough foul and fair, who pass beyond the summit of every holy as-cent, who leave behind them every divine light, every voice, every wordfrom heaven, and who plunge into the darkness where . . . there dwellsthe One who is beyond all things.”62According to the mystical theology of Pseudo-Dionysius, what re-mains of what can be knownis not soul or mind, nor does it possess imagination, conviction,speech, or understanding. Nor is it speech per se. It cannot bespoken of and it cannot be grasped by understanding. It is notnumber or order, greatness or smallness, equality or inequality,similarity or dissimilarity. It is not immovable, moving, or atrest. It has no power, it is not power, nor is it light. It does not livenor is it life. It is not a substance, nor is it eternity or time.

It is beyond assertion and denial.63In such a litany, one gets the experience of the process of negativetheology, which has a tendency to reduce one both to silence and to adarkness that one cannot even call darkness. So, in an attempt to con-tinue to express what the author is referring to, the image of DivineDarkness stands in the place of having nothing left to say. Throughouthis text, we find the metaphors of a darkness of unknowing that ishigher than knowledge: a cloud of unknowing; he who has made theshadow his hiding place; a darkness hidden by light; a nakedness thatexceeds light; a brilliant darkness resplendent; a dazzling obscurity ofsecret silence; a ray of Divine shadow that exceeds all existence; an out-shining of all brilliance with the intensity of darkness; a supraessentialDivine Darkness, beyond affirmation and negation; mystical ecstasy; atranscendent energy that lifts up, beyond sense and intellect; and aneclipse of consciousness that drives one out of one’s mind and leavesone in silence.64For Jung, such images are mad and monstrous, the height of para-dox, linking and transcending what we think of as opposites in such away that ordinary consciousness is radically challenged and subverted.In “Silver and White Earth,” Hillman speaks of such madness alchemi-cally as a process in which Solar brilliance and Moon madness are mar-velously conjoined. The mysterium coniunctionis then is illuminedlunacy.65However, if, with Hillman, we have ended in being out of ourminds with lunacy, it is only fair to say that it is a higher kind of lunacy,a lunacy that is not simply deprivation and solely associated with themoon, depression, or castration, but a lunacy of transcendence, per-haps better associated with art and poetry than literal madness.In Theodore Roethke’s poem “In a Dark Time,” he writes that “theeye begins to see;” and in this darkness, he meets his shadow and thedarkness deepens. Here, in the dark, he finds both madness and “no-bility of soul,” an odd correspondence of opposites. Roethke also doc-uments the via longissamathat leads to the death of the self, set in a“blazing unnatural light,” the point where the “I” no longer recognizesThe Black Sun(177)"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"itself but finds the mind of God and a sense of freedom in the pain ofloss.66Indeed, the poem contains several images associated with Solniger: pure despair, death of the Self, dark light, the nobility of the soul,and madness, all of which form a complex web that may well consti-tute a kind of lunacy.Nothingness and the No-SelfIt was such a higher lunacy that laid the ground for Jung’s more rational,intellectual, and scientific ideas about the Self. Jungian analyst MurrayStein, in Jung’s Map of the Soul,does a nice job of tracing Jung’s pri-mordial experience of the Self, and I quote only a small part that is rel-evant to our reflections here. He describes a point in Jung’s life in 1916,when Jung had a strange visionary experience that led to his writing aGnostic-like text called the “Seven Sermons to the Dead.” Jung heardthe following words, which he transcribed: “Harken: I begin with noth-ingness. Nothingness is the same as fullness. In infinity full is no betterthan empty. Nothingness is both empty and full. As well might ye sayanything else of nothingness, as for instance white is it, or black, or again,it is not, or is it. This nothingness or fullness let us name the Pleroma.”67This pleroma was a Gnostic name given to Jung’s experiential pre-figuration of what later became his hypothesis of the Self. This conceptwas elaborated throughout many of the Collected Worksbut most fullyexpressed in Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self.68Ac-cording to Jung, the Self was a concept difficult to define, and, in spiteof all of his warnings, it is often taken as a substantialized entity. Perhapsit would be of use to remind ourselves that Jung’s Self is not a meta-physical entity. Psychologist and scholar Roger Brooke makes a usefulcontribution by asserting that to think of the Self as a “something” is less accurate than to understand it as a “no-thing,” “a fertile and hos-pitable emptiness within which the things of the world could shineforth.”69In an article that has received too little attention, “Nothing AlmostSees Miracles!: Self and No-Self in Psychology and Religion,” scholarof religion and Jungian psychology David Miller writes what amountsto a deconstructive reading of Jung’s idea of the Self. He claims that even(178)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"though Jung ultimately rejects the idea of a No-Self doctrine, in es-sence what he means by the idea of the “Self ” “has the same ontologi-cal status as the desubstantialized and deconstructed notion of the‘no-self ’ in the apophatic religious traditions. ‘Self ’ is no-self.’”70Turning to the margins of Jung’s ideas, beyond the formulations ofhis ideas as an empirical scientist, Miller recalls Jung’s comment:If you will contemplate [your nothingness,] your lack of fantasy,[lack] of inspiration, and [lack] of inner aliveness which you feelas sheer stagnation and a barren wilderness, and impregnate itwith the interest born of alarm at your inner death, then some-thing can take shape in you, for your inner emptiness concealsjust as great a fullness, if you allow it to penetrate into you.71An emptiness that is also a fullness resonates with figures such asPseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, Lao Tzu, and other masters ofAsian or Western philosophies and religions that hold the concept ofNothingness at the core of psychological and religious life. In essence,this is true for Jung, too. For, beyond the scientific Jung, is the alchem-ical Jung, for whom the so-called Self is “in principle unknown andunknowable.”72This Jung follows the alchemical dictum ignotium perignotius(the unknown [is explained] by the more unknown). In short,for Jung the Self “is tantamount to religion’s no-self.”73The paradoxical tension between Self and No-Self that Miller de-scribes is a point of philosophical debate and doctrinal complexity thatreaches a high point in Asian philosophy and religion—in the dia-logue between Hindu and Buddhist perspectives. The debate is rele-vant for understanding Jung’s idea of the Self since this idea was mod-eled in part on the ancient Hindu notion of Atman/Brahman.The Upanishadic perspective holds that beneath and/or above theflux of the empirical world is an unchanging and eternal Self at the coreof the universe. Buddhist philosophy, on the other hand, rejects such anidea of an unchanging Self and considers any idea of the Self to be animpermanent construction that must be seen through. In the place ofthe Self/Atman, the Buddhists see Anatman (or No-Self ) and Sunyata(Nothingness or Voidness) as a mark of the “real.”The Black Sun(179)"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The theme of this debate has been taken up by transpersonal psy-chologist Sean Kelly.74He contributes to this debate, positing what hecalls “complex holism,” a view in part influenced by Hegel’s, Jung’s, andMorin’s idea of a dialectic that is a “symbiotic combination of two [ormore] logics in a manner that is at once complementary andantago-nistic.”75What’s important in Kelly’s position is not just the idea ofbringing the two perspectives together in unity but also giving impor-tance to their differences. This gives his vision nuance and complexity.In other words, the doctrine that holds the Self (the Hindu Atman/Brahman) as the supreme principle and the doctrine that holds theNo-Self (The Buddhist Annata) as a supreme principle are comple-mentary while at the same timeremaining antagonistic. Kelly rela-tivizes each fundamental idea by noting that both principles “mustnegate the truth of the other in order to point out its onesidedness andits missing complement.”76It appears that Kelly’s idea is parallel to Jung’s. Jung’s psychology wasoriginally called complex psychology, and later, as it developed, an im-portant component of it was the idea that the unconscious compen-sates for the one-sided attitudes of the conscious mind with the intentof achieving balance and wholeness. For Jung, the “Self ” was also acomplex (w)holism, a self-regulating and balancing principle, but whatis interesting in Kelly’s argument is that he applies the idea of comple-mentarity to the idea of the Self itself.77He observes that the concept ofthe Self as Atman is prone to the kind of sterile hypostatization thatimpedes rather than facilitates psychic life. On the other hand, with-out the stability of the atmanic Self, the No-Self Annata doctrine is alsoprone to a sterile nihilism that leaves psychic life adrift.It is worth noting here that for each perspective, Hindu or Bud-dhist, the idea of a complementarity principle can be accounted forfrom within. The Atman/Brahman perspective has its own way of un-derstanding the flux of the No-Self, just as the No-Self perspective ofthe Buddhists has its own way of understanding stability. Those whoare committed to one perspective or another are likely to feel that theantagonistic other does not reallyunderstand its perspective, whichfrom within its own point of view the ideas of its critics are already ad-dressed. Those who hold to their own perspectives alone are tradi-(180)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"tionally considered orthodox, whereas those who seek to break withtradition may be seen as iconoclastic or even heretical, like Jung him-self. The history of ideas and cultures seems to move by virtue of sucha dialectic, though ultimately this may be a too-limited way to imaginethe complexity of history.Kelly’s perspective of complex holism embraces both perspectives,Self and No-Self. To this dialogical complementarity he adds the either/or of dialogic antagonism, which gives the debate a dynamic thrustthat both affirms and relativizes at the same time. If we then imagineJung’s idea of the Self as being subject to a similar critique, the Selfwould call for the complementarity principle of No-Self to keep it fromstagnating into an hypostasized and fixed idea of order, as Hillman hasobserved.For Jung as well as Hillman, the Self as the archetype of meaning re-quires the anima or archetype of life to keep it from stagnation. Hill-man, however, prefers not to speak of the Self at all because of itstendency as a transcendental concept to lose connection with the body.For him, the problem with Jung’s idea of the Self is that it moves towardtranscendence, both mathematical and geometric. Its analogies tendto be drawn from the realm of spirit, abstract philosophy, and mysti-cal theology. Its principles tend to be expressed in terms such as self-actualization, entelechy, the principle of individuation, the monad,the totality, Atman, Brahman, and the Tao.78For Hillman, all of this points to a vision of Self that is removed fromlife, and so it enters psychology “through the back door, disguised assynchronicity, magic, oracles, science fiction, self-symbolism, man-dalas, tarot, astrology and other indiscriminations, equally prophetic,ahistorical and humorless.”79Here Hillman brings together a variety ofideas and images sacred to the orthodox Jungians, which, while not welldifferentiated, serves the purpose of painting a vision of the Self as anunconscious, abstract structure that has lost touch with the dynamicsof the soul. This is a view of the Self that is not acceptable to the ortho-dox Jungian, for whom the Self is both structural, dynamic, and deeplyconnected to life.It is not surprising to find that fundamental concepts such as the Selfare open to multiple interpretations. As noted, there are those who re-The Black Sun(181)"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"gard Jung’s Self as anything but static and others for whom it too easilyloses itself in a hypostasized, outmoded, out of touch, and abstract con-ception that calls out for revision. As I interpret Kelly’s perspective of“complex holism,” the importance of the tension is to reveal how everyfundamental concept has a shadow even when the concept is as wideranging as the Self. In this sense, the complementary/antagonistic ideaof the No-Self reveals the Self ’s shadow as an esoteric and invisibleother that is necessary to the animation of psychic life. Traditionallythe shadow is considered to be the counterpart of consciousness, butthe Self is said to embrace both the conscious and the unconscious di-mensions of psychic life.However, if one follows Jung in the most radical sense while simul-taneously giving credence to the perspectives of Miller and Kelly andto the importance of the idea of the No-Self as being both comple-mentary and antagonistic to Jung’s idea of the Self, then it is reasonableto imagine the Self as having a shadow, a dynamic and invisible Other-ness that is essential to it.Often for alchemy, Sol is the most precious thing, while Sol niger asits shadow is like Lacan’s “petite a.”80This petite a is “more worthlessthan seaweed.”81Ye t without Sol niger there is no ring to consciousness,no dynamic Other that taints and tinctures the brilliance of the Sun.Following the alchemical tradition, Jung writes that “Consciousness re-quires as its necessary counterpart a dark, latent, non-manifest side. . . .So much did the alchemists sense the duality of his unconscious as-sumptions that, in the face of all astronomical evidence, he equippedthe sun with a shadow [and stated]: ‘The sun and its shadow bring thework to perfection.’”82Ultimately, I believe the notion of a shadow of the Self is supportedby the paradoxical play of opposites in alchemy.Sous Rapture, Depth Psychology, and the SoulFrom the beginning of this chapter, we have been grappling with theidea of antinomies, with the paradoxical play of light and dark, life anddeath, spirit and matter. The coincidentia oppositorum and mysteriumconiunctionis are expressions of paradox and monstrosity, madden-(182)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"ing negations and attempts at unifications or transcendence. In an at-tempt to understand Sol niger, we have explored the Divine Darknessof mystical theology, the tension between Hindu and Buddhist visions,and the idea of a complex holism that lends itself to a new way of imag-ining both the Jungian idea of the Self as well as of Sol niger.As we have seen, the problem is how can we speak about whateverit is that is referred to in the preceding? How can we address that in-visible or absent presence that we call the Self or no-Self, Divine Dark-ness, or Sol niger? It has been challenging for the ancient philosophers,religious mystics, and alchemists, as well as for contemporary post-structuralist philosophers and psychoanalysts to grapple with express-ing what is often felt to be inexpressable.For poststructuralist sensibilities, one difficulty that is often ex-pressed is that in every attempt to name that absent presence, there re-mains a vestige of metaphysical speculation, a transcendental signified(for our purposes read as Self ) that is not deconstructed.The French poststructuralist philosopher Jacques Derrida, for ex-ample, finds this to be the case with regard to negative theology, whichhis thought resembles but from which he insists it differs. In his “Howto Avoid Speaking: Denials,” he takes up his relationship with negativetheology:This which is called X... “is” neither this nor that, neither sens-ible nor intelligible, neither positive nor negative, neither insidenor outside, neither superior nor inferior, neither active nor pas-sive, neither present nor absent, not even neutral, not even sub-ject to a dialectic with a third movement, without any possiblesublation (“Aufhebung”). Despite appearances, then, this X isneither a concept nor even a name; it does lend itself to a seriesof names, but calls for another syntax, and exceeds even the or-der and the structure of predictive discourse. It “is” not and doesnot say what “is.” It is written completely otherwise.83While mimicking Pseudo-Dionysius, Derrida might be said to writenegative theology “otherwise,” in a way that does not assume a supremebeing beyond the categories of being. Following Heidegger, he elabo-The Black Sun(183)"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"rates the postmodern practice of sous rapture,which has been trans-lated as “under erasure,” to mark the paradoxical play of “the absenceof a presence, an always already absent present, of the lack at the originthat is the condition of thought and experience.”84In Jungian terms, one might think of this with regard to the myste-rious core of an “archetype itself,” which can never be made fully pres-ent or conscious. When we speak of God or Self, we are naming some-thing whose Being is never fully present and cannot be captured in anysignification. Even to speak of it as having a core or as being somethingis problematic. In Jungian language, we speak of images of the Self, butwhat does it mean to speak of this Self as if it existed as a kind of in-dependent presence or transcendentally signified object or being? Wehave seen that, in negative theology, trying to name such transcenden-tal “objects” always falls short and that they can be referred to only in terms such as Divine Darkness, which does not seem to refer to any“thing” at all. If no word or sign can capture the transcendental notionof God or Being or the Self and so on, then the words or signs that re-fer to it must be put under erasure—or crossed out—since the wordis inaccurate. However, since all signs or words are necessary but alsoshare the same lack, the convention has been to print both the word orsign and its deletion. Derrida gives this example: “[T]he sign is that ill-named thing... that escapes the instituting question of philos-ophy.”85Likewise, if we speak of God, Being, or Self, the convention woulddictate that we express such ideas under erasure as God, Being, andSelf. That which is the absence of the signified, Derrida calls a trace, aninvisible, marked by a sign under erasure. For Derrida, this is an ex-perimental strategy of philosophizing in which what is being referredto as the transcendental arche (origin) must make its necessity felt be-fore letting itself be erased (p. xviii, translator’s preface). This is veryimportant from an analytic point of view because if erasure takes placebefore there is any emotional connection with the other, erasure wouldremain an intellectual game without analytic gravity.It is interesting that Derrida uses the notion of arche-trace, which Iimagine as a philosophically sophisticated expression of what Jungtried to express by archetype—a notion reflective of Jung’s Kantian vi-(184)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"sion. I cannot here elaborate the complexity of this notion except tosay that to follow Derrida’s intent is to “change certain habits of mind,rooted in our traditional metaphysics, in language, representation,ideas of the origin and in our binary logic.” Using Derrida’s strategy ofsous rapture, the notion of the Self under erasure, rather than beingseen as a transcendental idea, essence, or substance, comes even closerto Jung’s recognition of its mystery and unknown quality. Seen as atrace, the Self ’s invisible presence is both marked yet effaced, and itsshadow Otherness, seen otherwise, is both paradoxical and mysteri-ous, both light and dark, yet neither.I believe Derrida’s sous rapture gets at the intention of Jung’s idea ina new and highly original way. It also penetrates into the idea of Noth-ingness beyond its literal and binary designations. Applying his notionto Jung’s concept of the Self adds a perspective that renews our under-standing of the Mysterium Coniunctionisand helps us resist turning it into a simple conceptual unity or idealism, a danger pointed out byMicklem, who emphasized the Mysterium Coniunctionisas a complexiooppositorumof paradoxical and monstrous proportions. As we haveseen, Edinger also emphasizes the mysterious nature of the oppositesand traces it culturally in the development of science and materialismplaced like a cuckoo’s egg in the nest of the Christian vision.Imagine Derrida’s sous rapture as another such cuckoo’s egg placedin the nest of modernism and Jungian psychology. It is paradoxical; itis monstrous, a foreign body that like the egg Edinger describes is alsolikely to hatch something new. I imagine it as a complexio opposito-rum, continually hatching at the core of the mysterium coniunctionis,now bringing into our science and materialism an original, philo-sophical sensitivity to the paradox of language and continually decon-structing our tendencies to logocentrism.Applying Derrida’s idea of sous rapture to the notion of the Self inJung’s psychology opens a way of imagining the Self as under erasure.Imagining such a Self psychologically is an attempt to think aboutsomething that can never be simply identified with any one side of abinary pair—light or dark, black or white, spirit or matter, masculineor feminine, imaginary or real, conscious or unconscious—or withany hypothesized, transcendental notion that attempts to supersede orThe Black Sun(185)"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"lift itself up above these oppositions as if language referred in somenominalist or substantialist way to some literal “thing” or entity.As we have seen, terms such as Self, Being, and God cannot be priv-ileged or given status outside the language system from which theyhave been drawn. For Derrida, following twentieth-century linguistFerdinand de Saussure, these terms derive their meaning in a diacriti-cal way, each making sense only in relation to other signs in a syn-chronic system of signifiers and having meaning only in relationshipto other signs among which none is privileged. Nevertheless, philos-ophy, psychology, and religion all have a long history of master tropesor metaphors that appear and attempt to refer to something beyondthe ordinary images of familiar words, such as Being, God, and Self.These “words” are like arche-traces that refer more to mystical than toliteral reality and, like Hermes, stand at the crossroads of “différance,”a neologism that Derrida coined from the French word for “differ-ence” and which carries the meaning of both difference and deferral.86What is continually deferred is the idea that a word arrives at a literaldestination, indicating a one-to-one correspondence and representa-tion of reality.So, for example, the idea of the Self can never be separated from itsinvisible counterpart, the No-Self, against which it derives its mean-ing. Since an insight is marked by placing it under erasure, the linedrawn through the word Self indicates its negation, its shadow. Thisensures that an idea will not be taken literally and reminds us that ideaswill continue to disseminate throughout time and culture. No con-cept, master trope, or metaphor can ever finally complete the play ortotality of psyche, which, like Mercurius, always escapes our grasp. TheSelf under erasure is always in a process of continual deconstruction,and, like the philosopher’s stone of alchemy, it slips “that grip of Be-griffethat would capture it.”87Hillman’s reading of alchemy imaginesthe philosopher’s stone as soft and oily, countering both those imagesthat point to its strength, solidity, and unity and also our tendency tocrystallize the goal in terms of fixed positions and doctrinal truth.

In short, the “Self isparadoxically notoneself.”92However, insofar as Jung’s Self as a totalityrises above and beyond the psychic and subjective realm and is seen asconstituted by impersonal, collective forces, it is consistent with thepoststructuralist contention that the subject is likewise primarily aneffect of larger collective forces: historic, economic, or linguistic.93Thepoststructuralist view of such forces is quite different from the moremysterious idea about archetypes and the collective unconscious, butfor some philosophers (e.g., Lévinas) and some post-Jungian psycho-analysts (e.g., Hillman), the distancing from subjectivity has becomeproblematic. The question remains as to what extent such a subject isdissolved in structure and function, with a loss of body and ethicalsensibility. In both Lévinas and Hillman, the problem of the body/sensibility and ethics becomes an important theme in the constitutionof the Self/soul, which resists abstraction.94Both Hillman and Lévinasattempt to maintain a subject that is both fleshy and human while, atthe same time, paradoxically, it moves beyond the idea of a reified sub-ject and/or an abstract transcendence.The “subject” Hillman describes is an outcome of having under-gone an alchemical process and/or the successful termination of ananalysis. The transformation of subjectivity is bodily a difficult andThe Black Sun(187)"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"painful process in which the preanalytic or pre-deconstructive subjectmust undergo both change and erasure. This erasure is not a simpleabstract process of thought but rather a powerful experience of nega-tion and mortification that wounds our narcissism and uncovers ourrelationship with the Other and the world, which was the preconditionof any subjectivity to begin with. The negation and mortification ofthe Self is symbolically expressed by the black sun and has been indi-cated here by the crossing out of the Self. The blackness of the suncrosses out the simple Western metaphysical notions of light and con-sciousness. The Self under erasure is shorthand for a complex trans-formation that has been described in different ways, including as analchemical process of deconstruction and/or as an analysis.Archetypal AlchemyIn alchemy as in the literatures of deconstruction and analysis, theshorthand of erasure is richly expanded and amplified. It is part of aseries of complex and subtle processes of dissolutions and coagulations(solve et coagula),negation and conjunction, and mortification and re-vitalization. The idea of erasure lends itself to comparison with certainoperations of alchemy that have to do with the processes of mortifica-tion, calcination, and dissolution and entering into the blacker-than-black aspect of the nigredo, in which the self is ultimately reduced to no-self. Such a focus emphasizes the death aspect of the opus and the powerful reduction of narcissism. In alchemy, the nigredo is oftenplaced at the beginning of the work, and ultimately the blacker-than-black is thought to be surpassed as blackness lightens and yields to othercolors. The changes in coloration reflect subtle changes in the soul.One reading of this process is that it is linear, progressive, and spir-itual. It results in a literal salvational goal in which the lead of the pre-deconstructed or analytic subject is thought to be changed into thegold of a resurrected self, forever beyond further dissolution or morti-fication. For Hillman, this is a literalized reading of alchemy by whichthe stain of blackness is forever dispelled. His critique of such a read-ing parallels the insights of a deconstructive reading in which speakingabout a post-deconstructive and/or postanalytic subject is prob-(188)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"lematic, as if such a self or subject is a fixed outcome or product of such proceedings. There is never simply an “after” of analysis or decon-struction, and expressing it conceptually recreates the illusion of a self-enclosed totality. No one is ever fully analyzed; no deconstruction isever complete; the unconscious or blackness is never totally elimi-nated. The alchemical work of James Hillman emphasizes the contin-uous process of deconstruction while at the same time indicating atransformative process that recognizes a potential for revitalization.Hillman radicalizes our reading of alchemy and resists any allegori-cal or salvationist reading of it. His has been an important voice cri-tiquing any reading of steps and stages, emphasizing instead a way of seeing that regards each “phase” for itself. He stays true to alchemy in organizing his work around colors as aesthetic materials reflectingqualities of the soul. In a series of papers he writes about the “Seductionof Black,” “Alchemical Blue and the Unio Mentalis,” “Silver and theWhite Earth” (parts one and two), and “The Yellowing of the Work.” In “Concerning the Stone: Alchemical Images of the Goal,” he writesabout the rubedo,the process of reddening. In all of the works men-tioned, he tries to see through the linear progression of a unidirectionalmodel simply progressing through time.One of the dangers of placing blackness into a process of develop-ment is the tendency to move too quickly away from its radicality, itsblacker-than-black aspect, its depth, its severity, and the sufferingassociated with it. The unidirectional, spiritualized version of the al-chemical opus wants to move out and away from blackness. Its focus ison the move from black to white, from nigredo to albedo, the classicalalchemical formula. Nevertheless, to focus on movement and transi-tion from one state or color to another, useful as this might be, runs therisk of not seeing with that dark eye that sees blackness for itself andnot simply as a passage to whiteness, change, and generation.The temptation to read alchemy in this way has textual support inEdinger: “[T]hat which does not make black cannot make white, be-cause blackness is the beginning of whiteness.”95“Putrefaction is of sogreat efficacy that it blots out the old nature and bears another fruit....Putrefaction takes away the acridity from all corrosive spirits of salt,renders them soft and sweet.”96The Black Sun(189)"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Classic passages such as these may lead one to focus on whiteness,the albedo of new form, and the soft sweetness of renewal. Such pas-sages describe important qualities of alchemical transformation, butthey can also lend themselves to readings that can reduce the darkdepth of the putrefaction process to a moment of negation in an intel-lectual dialectic. It is useful to recall Edinger’s warnings that the al-chemical work is dangerous and requires torture, killing, and death, aswell as Hillman’s caution that the mortificatio occurs not just once butagain and again. Blackness is not just a stage to be bypassed once andfor all, but a necessary component of psychological life. The black spotis structurally part of the metaphoric eye itself, a potential inherent inthe soul’s visual possibility.Hillman emphasizes that blackness has a purpose: It teaches en-durance, warns, dissolves attachments, and “sophisticates the eye” sothat we may not only see blackness but actually see by means of it.97Tosee through blackness is to understand its continuous deconstructiveactivity as necessary for psychological change.98To read alchemy thisway suggests that its images are “psychic conditions [that are] alwaysavailable.”99They do not disappear. Psychologically, it is easy to be se-duced. The colors catch our eye as they change from black to white toyellow to red, indicating a movement out of despair to the highest statesof psychological renewal (color plate 16). In Hillman’s papers, too, onecan trace such a movement from the blackest mortifications to where,in blue beginnings, Venus collaborates with Saturn and transforms intothe pure whiteness of the albedo.100The perfection of white rots butonly to yellow, opening the way for rubedo, the reddening, libidinalactivity of the soul as it resurrects and revivifies matter, crowning it inbeauty and pleasure. In fact, Hillman describes the alchemical processin this way.101If one stands back and abstracts his descriptions andplaces them into a developmental vision, one could say this is in factwhat he describes as the alchemical process, however watered down.Such a reading, however, would interpret Hillman precisely in theway that he would not want to be read. It would impose and carry overa spiritualizing and developmental tendency from the very readings hecritiques. To read him in this way would be to follow the linear pull ofhis work into a banal cliché. It is always too easy to collapse originality(190)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"and complexity into facile formulations. A careful, serious reading ofhis work means that, in spite of seeing and “moving beyond” the ni-gredo, his texts resist any easy exit from blackness. As he moves fromcolor to color, the traces of blackness remain like a subtle body thatimbues the soul with its own ongoing essence. In short, he preservesthe luminous paradox of blackness.Consider the following from “Alchemical Blue and the Unio Men-talis.” Hillman writes, “The transit from black to white via blue... alwaysbrings black with it. . . . Blue bears traces of the mortificatiointo thewhitening.”102In “Silver and the White Earth,” he states, “‘Putrefactionextends and continues even unto whiteness’.... We must, therefore,amend our notion of the white earth.”103Likewise, in the transit fromwhite to yellow, the process is marked by putrefaction, rotting, decay,and death: “Yellow signifies a particular kind of change usually for theworse.”104Even in the “final stage” of the alchemical transformation—the red-dening—we witness the final dissolution of sunlit consciousness. Thereddening of the goal likewise has darkness in its core. So, even whileHillman indicates the soul’s movement through the color matrices ofalchemy, in each move the subtle essence of blackness works in such away that the essence of blackness is never left behind.While Hillman critiques the idea of a literal spiritual and develop-mental reading of alchemy, still he notes that success in the work de-pends on the ordering of time, succession, and “stages.” The danger isonly in literalizing this ordering or totally fixing the colors of psycho-logical experiences into rigid categories of exclusion that would flatten,deplete, and miss their richness and subtlety. When this happens, time,order, succession, and stages are seen as fixed phases—concrete stepstoward a literal goal. Such a view leaves us trapped in a linear, historicalprogression toward some metaphysical illusion stretched out in timerather than grappling in the midst of differentiated, impelling images.In “Concerning the Stone: Alchemical Images of the Goal,” Hillmangives an example of the complexity of an image in which he refuses toseparate into “positive and negative, dark and light, death and newbirth.” The “grit and the pearl, the lead and the diamond, the hammerand the gold are inseparable.”105For Hillman, “the pain is not prior toThe Black Sun(191)"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"the goal, like crucifixion before resurrection”; rather, pain and gold are“co-terminous, co-dependent and co-relative.” “The pearl is also al-ways grit, an irritation, as well as a luster, the gilding also a poison-ing.”106It is hard to keep these opposite dimensions of experience inconsciousness, but, for Hillman, such a description fits with life, “for weare strangely disconsolate even in a moment of radiance.” Our goldenexperience “again and again will press for testing in the fir e, ever newblackness appearing, dark crows with the yellow sun.”107On such a basis, I propose that the “light of darkness itself,” Solniger, is such a complex image and that the idea of regeneration is bet-ter seen in a deeper consciousness of this paradox than in a movingthrough and beyond it. The paradox holds the “opposites” of light/dark, visible/invisible, and self and no-self together, and in so doingthere is a “light,” an effulgence, or a “shine” that is hard to define or cap-ture in any metaphysical language. Taking Hillman’s lead, my experi-ence has been to imagine the luster of blackness itself in its multiplicityand, like Hillman and Lopez-Pedreza, to resist as much as possible go-ing to other colors to reflect the complexity of experience. In this wayI have attempted to extract the “black” back from the array of colors inorder to give full acknowledgement to its subtle presence. While black-ness appears somewhat different when seen through blue, white, yel-low, and red, its “essence” remains. Here, blackness need not beunderstood only as a literal color but also as a “qualitative differentia-tion of intensities and hues, which is essential to the act of imagina-tion.”108In this way, black remains as a subtle body embracing psychewith its ongoing essence, repeating, deconstructing, tincturing, andmaking itself felt in the very pigment of the soul. It is an essence ofmultiple differentiations and layers of meaning. We have seen thatwriters and painters have long known about the many qualities ofblackness. The following is a remark by the famous Japanese painterand printmaker Hokusai: “There is a black which is old and a blackwhich is fresh. Lustrous (brilliant) black and matte black, black in sun-light and black in shadow. For the old black one must use an admix-ture of blue, for the matte black an admixture of white; for the lustrousblack gum (colle) must be added. Black in sunlight must have grayreflection.”109(192)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"In The Song of Solomon,Toni Morrison states that “There’re five orsix kinds of black. Some silky, some wooly. Some just empty. Some likefingers. And it don’t stay still. It moves and changes from one kind ofblack to another. Saying something is pitch black is like saying some-thing is green. What kind of green? . . . Well, night black is the sameway. May as well be a rainbow.”110Hillman, too, echoes the preceding statements: “There are blacksthat recede and absorb, those that dampen and soften, those that etchand sharpen, and others that shine almost with the effulgence—a Solniger.”111In addition to its multiple differentiations, the black essence is alsoubiquitous—as John Brozostoski well demonstrates in a piece hewrote called “Tantra Art.”112In it he demonstrates the all-pervasive in-fusion of color in our speech. Beginning with black, he highlights itspresence in between our words, often invisible to eye and ear when wefocus only on the literalizing word or meaning. Here we have a sectionfrom Jung’s Psychology and Alchemytreated to the same technique:The (black) lapis(black) says (black) in (black) Hermes: (black)‘Therefore (black) nothing (black) better (black) or (black) more(black) worthy (black) of (black) veneration (black) can (black)come (black) to (black) pass (black) in (black) the (black) world(black) than (black) the (black) union (black) of (black) myself(black) and (black) my (black) son.’ (black) The (black) Mono-genes (black) is (black) also (black) called (black) the (black) ‘dark(black) light.’ (black) The (black) Rosarium(black) quotes (black)a (black) saying (black) of (black) Hermes: (black) ‘I (black) the(black) lapis (black) beget (black) the (black) light, (black) but(black) the (black) darkness (black) too (black) is (black) of (black)my (black) nature.’ (black) Similarly (black) alchemy (black) has(black) the (black) idea (black) of (black) the (black) sol(black)niger,(black) the (black) black (black) sun.As one reads his description, the narrative force of meaning is frus-trated, interrupted, and begins to deconstruct.

This blackjoy is also recognized in the sublime beauty of Hades, where, Jung andHillman tell us, everything becomes deeper, moving from visible con-nection to invisible one, and the invisible glows with the presence ofthe void.The link between jouissance and blackness is also made by StanislovGrof and captured in a series of paintings described in LSD Psycho-therapy.About these images, one of which is presented in figure 5.6 ingrayscale, Grof states that through suffering one reaches the Black Sun,“the manifestation of the innermost core of the human being, the di-vine Self,” which he associates with “transcendental bliss,” not unlikethe descriptions of the Tantric tradition.114The patient whom Grof describes had experienced the destructivepower of volcanoes but had come to appreciate the creative aspect ofthe glowing magma. Giegerich reminds us that this creative fire—afire that also contains the volcanic metaphor of the stream of lava, theincandescent matter—is at the core of Jung’s work.115It is an imageimportant to Jung in his vision of the psyche. Even though Grof isaware of both the destructive and creative dimensions of this primor-dial process, he separates Sol niger, the “destructive” part, from thetranscendent black sun. I believe this runs the risk of splitting the ar-chetype apart. As I see it, both experiences are intimately intertwinedand present in the blackness of Sol niger as an archetypal image.For Jung, Hillman, and Giegerich the price of admission to this vi-sion of the soul is the loss of the materialist viewpoint. Only then canthe soul show itself as both Hades and Pluto, the dark underworld withits fruitful and shining possibilities. Hillman notes that from one per-spective the blackness of night is “the source of all evil,” but that fromthe viewpoint of the Orphics, “Night was a depth of love (Eros) andlight (Phanes).”116The Black Sun(195)"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"This mystical love is well described in a study by philosopher GeorgeScheper.117Hillman resists proponents of religious darkness and theirmystical language, but for Scheper and others, these mystics becomeour most reliable phenomenologists of a dazzling darkness, of Eros andself-forgetting.

The passion of ecstatic love is prominent in Sufimysticism.Henri Corbin links such erotic passion with what the Sufis called blacklight, considered the highest spiritual stage and the most perilous ini-tiatic step. “The ‘black light’ is that of the attribute of Majesty whichsets the mystic’s being on fir e; it is not contemplated; it attacks, in-vades, annihilates, then annihilates annihilation. It shatters . . . the ap-paratus of the human organism.”118This light is considered by the Sufis as “a very delicate spiritual stateinto which the mystic enters just before the fanâ (annihilation) turnsinto baqâ (survival)” and marks “a state shared by both.”119At this mo-ment, the inner eye of the mystic turns dark, and yet it is the pointwhere darkness itself is supreme light.120Blackness (Siyâhî), accordingto Izutsu, in reality is the very light of “the Absolute-as-such” and “cor-responds... ontologically . . . to the stage of Oneness (ah.adîyah)” or“Supreme Blackness (sawad-e a‘ za.m).” “ ‘The mystic,’ Lâhîjî observes,‘does not realize absolute existence unless and until [one] fully realizesabsolute Nothingness.... Nothingness is in itself the very Existence-by-the-Absolute.’ In short, nothingness (or darkness) is in reality exis-tence (light), and light is in reality darkness.”121The Black Sun(197)"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Finally, according to Lâhîjî, there is yet one further ultimate “stage”that can be described—called “annihilation after survival,” whichIzutsu compares to what Hua Yen Buddhism considers the “ultimateof all ultimate ontological stages, the celebrated ji-ji-muge-hohkai...[which] represents the extreme limit which our paradox of light anddarkness can reach.”122In Dancing Streams Flow in the Darkness,Shunryu Suzuki com-ments on a Chinese poem by Sekito Kisen in one of his Zen talks.123The poem is called “Sandokai.” It is about twelve hundred years oldand speaks of the relationship between light and darkness, noting that“In the light there is darkness, but don’t take it as darkness. In the darkthere is light, but don’t see it as light.”124For Suzuki, the absolute is be-yond the limits of our thinking mind and cannot be known. In Invis-ible Light,Paul Murray captures this spirit in a poem titled “Canticle ofthe Void,” part of which follows:(198)Chapter 5Figure 5.7. Image of the coniunctio. From C. G.

This state of unknowing is synonymous withthe mystical poverty that we attribute to the Sufi, who is said to be“poor in spirit.” It is a poverty in which we are reduced to Nothingness(200)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"and God is no one who can be grasped. In a poem called simply“Psalm,” Paul Célan writes:No one kneads us again out of earth and clay,no one incants our dust.

In the Chassidic discourse BasiLeGani,the nullification of the ego is described as a folly of holinessand self-transcendence, in which the spiritual work of transformingdarkness into light is done to the degree where the “darkness itselfwould be luminous.”128Sanford Drob elaborates the kabbalistic recognition of a “darknessthat is at the heart of light itself ” and finds analogies to the black sun inthree moments of negation: in Ayin (as Ein-sof ), Tzimtzum, and She-The Black Sun(201)"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"virah.129For Drob, the Ayin suggests “that nothingness is the source ofall distinctiveness and difference, and thus of all light, meaning and sig-nificance.”130The Ein-sof is referred to as the “light that does not existin light,” and the Sefirot is spoken of as lights that are concealed or, as inthe Zohar, as the light of blackness (Bozina di Kardinuta).131Hasidic teacher Bitzalel Malamud explains that the study of Jewishmysticism involves various classic metaphors that describe supernaldynamics. The Sun is one such metaphor, referring to a nonapprehen-sible level of infinite light “which in its source is completely nullifiedand non-existent but which nevertheless emanates as a ray to createand enliven all creation, spiritual as well as the physical.” The meta-phor, however, does not tell the whole story because we are thinkingabout an infinite “sun” that, if revealed as the direct source of the ray,would leave it and creation no room to exist with any independence.Malamud explains that in order to allow a place for separate existence,the infinite sun needs to be completely contracted. In the language ofthe kabbalist, this is called the Tzimtzum, which is basically the hidingof godliness.132In other words, Tzimtzum refers to the contraction of God’s infinitelight in order to create a space or black void so that there is room forcreation. Shevirah refers, on the other hand, to a brilliant spark thatexists like a scintilla in the sea of darkness that can serve as a basis forredemption. In the kabbalistic universe, light and dark exist in an in-visible interpenetration that, like Sol niger, might well be referred to asDivine Darkness.A friend and colleague, Robert Romanyshyn, knew of my work onthe black sun and had himself been working on a book of poems calledDark Light.He told me that he had no idea why the title had come tohim, and he sent me the following dream of a black sun:V. and I awaken in a hotel room. It is dark outside, and I am sur-prised because it feels as if it should be morning. It feels that wehave slept and the night has passed. I call the hotel desk to ask thetime and someone tells me it is 9 a.m.Then the person says,“Haven’t you heard? Scientists are saying there’s somethingwrong with the sun.”(202)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"In a half waking state, a kind of reverie, the dream seems to con-tinue:I have the sense that the world now will be lit by a dark light.I also have the sense that these scientists have determined thatthere is much less hydrogen (fuel) and/or much less mass to thesun than they had previously expected. The world is going to be-come increasingly dark and cold.But then the dark, nearly black light becomes blue/violet/purple.A blue sun, a beautiful aura of blue color bathes the world. Ithink of the color of the tail of the Peacock in alchemy.In a letter to me he comments that he was left wondering whetherthe world were entering into a dark sun (apart, of course, from won-dering about the personal meaning of the dream for his own life). Al-though it is not my intent to comment on this dream with regard toRomanyshyn’s personal life, I would like to amplify it a bit by notingthat in The Soul in Grief: Love, Death, and Transformation,he discussesthe tragic death of his wife.133Unflinchingly, he lived through a mostprofound darkness and emerged with a sense of gratitude and the re-newal of life. Likewise, in this dream, the darkness of Sol niger trans-forms into an array of colors associated with an alchemical symbol oftransformation, the peacock’s tail, or cauda pavonis:The peacock’s tailin traditional alchemy is said to occur “immediately after the deathlyblack stage” of the nigredo.“After the nigredo,the blackened body ofthe Stone is washed and purified by the mercurial water during theprocess of ablution.When the blackness of the nigredois washed away,it is succeeded by the appearance of all the colours of the rainbow,which looks like a peacock displaying its luminescent tail.”134This appearance is “a welcome sign that the dawning of the albedois at hand, that the matter is now purified and ready for re-animationby the illuminated soul.”135Looking at this image in the light of our ex-ploration of Sol niger, it is not the case that when the nearly black lightbecomes a blue violet and/or purple sun bathing the world in color,that blackness disappears any more than the loss of a loved one evervanishes, but that “blue is ‘darkness made visible’.”136This is an ideareminiscent of Jung’s now famous saying that “one does not becomeThe Black Sun(203)"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darknessconscious.” For Hillman, “the transit from black to white via blue im-plies that blue always brings black with it.”137The image infigure 5.8 emerged at the end of a long-term analysisof a woman artist. Suffering through the multiple mortifications thatanalysis requires to be successful allows a fuller flowering of the imag-ination, which shows itself here in a creative combination of peacockand owl feathers. The image emerged after a couple of dreams, the firstabout the end of a love affair and the second her “first flying dreamever.”Resonant with the cauda pavonis of alchemy, the image’s multicol-ored eyes are prominent. For my patient, the eyes were cat’s eyes and rep-resented a more independent way of seeing that emerged after deepdisillusionment. The owl feathers reminded her of night vision, of beingable to see in the dark of the transcendence of the starred heavens, andof the goddess Athena, to whom the owl was sacred. The owl’s eyes wereAthena’s eyes and as such became related to nocturnal studies, to theacademy, and to wisdom. The owl also has many other mythological ref-erences, including a relationship to the dead sun and to healing.138For Hillman, before healing can take place and the blackness of thenigredo can be transformed into the terra alba,or white earth, one mustbe able to see through multiple eyes and from many perspectives. Fromone point of view, the emergence of the white earth leaves the blacknessbehind, but as we have seen in numerous ways, the terra alba and thedarkness against which it defines itself form an intimate and indissol-uble relationship so that the white earth “is not sheer white in the literalsense but a field of flowers, a peacock’s tail, a coat of many colors.”139Hillman explains that the multiple eyes of cauda pavonis reflect thefull “flowering of imagination [that] shows itself as the qualitativespread of colors so that imagining is a coloring process, and if not inliteral colors, then as the qualitative differentiation of intensities andhues which is essential to the art of imagination.”140Ultimately, for Hillman, these colors are not the same as in the sub-jectivist philosophies of Newton and Locke or of Berkeley and Hume,where colors are considered as only secondary qualities brought aboutby the mind and senses of the observer. Here he reverses the history of(204)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Figure 5.8. Variation of the peacock tail. Artwork by analysand.

Color is now seen as a “primary quality” of the thing itself,not in a naturalistic sense but as “phainoumenonon display” at theheart of matter itself, prior to all abstraction.141In my patient’s image of cauda pavonis, the eyes become promi-nent. They look back at the dreamer, the artist, and us with an intensitythat suggests we are living in an animated, conscious, living universethat not only we see but that also sees us. I remember Edinger oncecommenting that after years of analysis and looking at dreams, it oc-curred to him that the dreams also see us and that this is the awaken-ing of what Jung meant by psychic reality. Hindu artists were wellaware of this phenomenon as can be seen in the image of multiple per-spectives and eyes we see in figure 5.9. It is with the constellation ofpsychic reality that psychological events come to life.When my Jungian colleague Harry Wilmer heard I was working ona book on the black sun, he told me that he had been making yarnpaintings and sewing on canvas since 1941 and that he had recentlymade one titled The Black Hole(color plate 17a). He sent me a pictureof his image and stated that the band across the middle is the MilkyWay and the large sphere in the right lower corner is the Earth. The rowof lights are the aurora borealis, and the gray explosions are gases be-lieved to be released at the event horizon.Wilmer also commented that this image shows the ultimate blacksun that we can expect when the end of time comes. He goes on: “Atthat time, theory tells us that the gigantic black hole will suck in the en-tire Milky Way, the Earth and our entire galaxy, including the Sun....The red dot is the ‘singularity,’ the most dense gravitational body pos-sible.”142I imagine Wilmer’s vision as an ultimate Sol niger image, not re-ducible to either psychological or physical reality. His description isominous and black, but his image is filled with color and life. I re-membered an article in the New York Timesby James Glanz. In the ar-ticle Glanz describes how black holes have been seen as “windowlesscosmic dungeons, ultracompressed objects with gravity so powerfulthat anything that plummets through their trapdoors—surfaces calledevent horizons enshrouding each one—is forever lost to the rest of the(206)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Figure 5.9.

Scientists believe that not even light beams can escape oncethey are inside.”143He goes on, however, to report a surprising, new find by astron-omers who, using an X-ray observatory in orbit around the Earth, havediscovered an intense glow, a glow with the intensity of ten billionsuns, burning just outside the event horizon of a huge but very distantblack hole (color plate 17b). In other words, for the first time, these as-tronomers have seen energy and light pouring out of a black hole andinto the surrounding universe.These observations have given rise to many speculations and prob-ably will for the foreseeable future.144The interpenetration of darknessand light in Wilmer’s vision and the paradox of the enigma of the blackhole is reminiscent of a dream of Jung’s, which he reported in a letterto Father Victor White on December 18, 1946.145The letter was writtensometime after Jung had a second heart attack. Jung writes:It is a mightily lonely thing, when you are stripped of everythingin the presence of God. One’s wholeness is tested mercilessly....I had to climb out of that mess and I am now whole again. Yes-terday I had a marvelous dream: One bluish diamond, like a starhigh in heaven, reflected in a round quiet pool—heaven above,heaven below. The imago Deiin the darkness of the earth, this ismyself. This dream meant a great consolation. I am no more a black and endless sea of misery and suffering but a certainamount thereof contained in a divine vessel.In a similar fashion, at the end of his lifethe French poet Victor Hugo at the age of eighty three had astroke. Four days later, during his death struggles, he, like Goethe,spoke of light, saying, “Here is the battle of day against night.”Hugo’s last words continued what in life he had always done:searching the darkest recesses of human nature for its brightesttreasures. As he died he whispered, “I see black light.”146I read Jung’s dream and Hugo’s comment in the spirit of Lao Tzu,who wrote that “mystery and manifestation arise from the same(208)Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"source. This source is called darkness.... Darkness within darkness,the gateway to all understanding.”147I would like to end with a quote from Arthur ZaJonc, who wrote abook called Catching the Light: The Entwined History of Light andMind:“As we leave light’s expansive dominions, the heavens dim anddarkness quietly falls. Within that darkness there is a silent murmur, astill voice that whispers of yet another and unsuspected part to light,for even utter darkness shimmers with its force.”148So our journey to the black sun ends with a whisper that began andends in darkness, a darkness no longer light’s contrary but a point ofpossibility in which light and dark both have their invisible origin, asimulacrum of substance in a world without foundations.The Black Sun(209)"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"epilogueWe began our exploration of the black sun as an experiment in al-chemical psychology. It begins and ends with an enigma, with a move-ment from the nigredo of light to the mystery of an illuminateddarkness. Imagined in juxtaposition to light, darkness casts a shadowand sets the stage for a new Faustian bargain, not with the forces ofdarkness but with the forces of light. In so doing, the primacy of lightis declared, and the values of science, technology, rational order, patri-archy, and progress lead the way into modernity with its astonishingcontributions to the spread of civilization and to consciousness itself.We have noted, however, that if light and the sun have led us into thepresent, it has also led to a massive repression and devaluation of thedark side of psychic and cultural life and displayed a blind spot with re-gard to vision itself. Philosophical and cultural critics of our time havepointed to the shadows of phallocentrism, logocentrism, and helio-politics, driven by the violence of light, a condition we have consideredpsychologically and symbolized by a one-sided identification withKing/ego and the tyrannical power of an undifferentiated, unconsciousshadow. We have noted that the despotic King as prima materia mustbe relativized, and we have examined the alchemical phenomenologyof the mortificatio in which this primitive King is tortured, beaten, hu-miliated, poisoned, drowned, dissolved, calcined, and killed.These alchemical operations lead to a nigredo, or descent into dark-ness, that ultimately empties the soul and leaves only skeletal remainsand the infernal light of Sol niger. Sol niger has been a difficult image tothrow light upon since, like a black hole, it sucks all light into itself.Thus, in alchemy and, following it, in the depth psychology of Jung, theblack sun has been associated with darkness almost exclusively."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Our strategy has been to stick with this image and to resist any sal-vationist attempt to reach beyond it. Rather, our work has been to hes-itate before the darkness, to pause and enter its realm, following it in alchemy, literature, art, and clinical expressions. Entering this worldof darkness, we have encountered Sol niger in its blacker-than-blackaspects and seen its most literal and destructive dimensions associatedwith narcissistic mortification, humiliation, delusion, despair, depres-sion, physiological and psychological decay, cancer, psychosis, suicide,murder, trauma, and death.In short, we have followed it into the heart of darkness, into theworlds of Hades and Ereshkigal, to Kali’s cremation ground and Dante’sworld of ice, where puer visions of light and eternity give way to Sat-urnian time and the perils of night. Here, rational order breaks down,and traumatogenic defenses come into play to prevent the unthink-able, but the unthinkable itself presents us with a mystery, the mysteryof a death that is not simply literal, but also symbolic. Alchemy por-trays such mysteries in a strange and paradoxical confluence of images:corpses and coffins with sprouting grains and black suns that shine. Itis a mystery that calls for more than defense and constellates a neces-sity that must be entered. As such, we have conceived of it as an onto-logical pivot point, marking a desubstantiation of the ego that exhibitsboth death and new life, light and darkness, presence and absence, theparadoxical play intrinsic to Sol niger as a black sun.For the alchemists, the unrepresentable can be perceived only by theinward person and was considered a mystery at the heart of nature it-self. Its odd light, the lumen naturae, was considered to be a divinespark buried in darkness and could be found in both the prime matterof the alchemist’s art and in the soma pneumatikon,or subtle body. Wehave traced the images of the subtle body in many esoteric traditionsas well as in the imagery of contemporary patients.For all of the traditions we have explored, the subtle body is a mi-crocosm of a larger universe and an image of the divine in humanform. This form has shown itself in symbols of the primordial humanbeing, who, understood psychologically, is an expression of the Self.For Jung, the Self is an idea that attempts to reflect the wholeness of thehuman psyche. It is intended to designate a structure that includes(212)Epilogue"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"both consciousness and the unconscious, light and dark, and was con-sidered a central, ordering principle at the core of psychic life. The Selfas a transcendental and superordinate structure cannot be made to-tally conscious. At its core, it was always considered to be an unknownmystery that disseminated itself in multiple archetypal images acrosstime and culture. We have seen how these archetypal images more orless adequately represent the wholeness of the archetypal structurethat they attempt to express. For Jung, the Self is a psychological lensthrough which to consider these expressions. These images, perhapsby necessity, always fall short of full expression of the archetype ofwholeness. We have considered that the same limitations may apply tothe concept of the Self.Concepts as well as symbols of wholeness and expressions of totalityhave a tendency to degenerate and move toward abstraction as idealizedand rational conceptualizations that seduce us into forgetting that theyfundamentally reflect an unknown. With regard to the psyche, Jungwrites, “The concept of the unconscious posits nothing,it designatesonly my unknowing.”1We have noted the importance of preserving thismystery that constitutes the strangeness and miracle of perception atthe heart of the mysterium coniunctionis. We have concluded that ifwe speak of unity or wholeness, it is important not to lose sight of stub-born differences and the monstrous complexities that, if true to thephenomenon, lead to humor, astonishment, and at times divine awe.As noted, the idea of the Self is Jung’s attempt to capture this complex-ity, but as his theories became assimilated and familiar, his concept issubject to the same fate as all fundamental ideas. That is, they soon losetheir original profundity, mystery, and unknown quality.In our attempt to speak the unspeakable, we have noticed that theSelf, too, casts a shadow, and we have focused on this shadow, recog-nizing the unnamable, invisible, and unthinkable core of the idea,which some have referred to as a Divine Darkness while others havecalled it a non-Self. The non-Self is not another name for the Self butis founded in the recognition of the problematics involved in any rep-resentation of wholeness and a mark for the profound expression ofthis mystery.

One might imagine these images as traces of silence at theheart of what we have imagined as the Self.In an attempt to speak about the Self, we have sought to find inno-vative ways to preserve its mystery, paradox, and unknown quality.Borrowing from postmodern philosophy, the Self has been imaginedas a Self under erasure, as an idea and image that has the mortificatioand self-deconstruction at its heart. Such a Self is always a non-Selfalso. It is a darkness that is light and a light that is darkness, and in thisway of imagining it we have a glimpse of Sol niger.Experientially, these two poles of the archetype, light and dark, arein an eternal embrace, crossing one another in a dance that might looklike the structure of DNA. It appears to me now that Sol niger might beconsidered an archetypal image of the non-Self, having two integratedpoles and multiple differentiations. At one end, the non-Self can beseen in its most literal form locked into the nigredo and the mortifica-tion of the flesh. Here the non-Self leans toward physical annihilationand literal death. At its other pole, however, the archetypal image is nolonger confined to the nigredo and reflects itself in a different light,where annihilation is linked to both the presence of the void under-stood as absence, Eros, and self-forgetting and a majesty that sets thesoul on fire.In all, there is an alchemy and art in darkness, an invisible designrendering and rending vision, calling it to its sourceless possibility.The light of Western metaphysics has obscured darkness; sedimentedreason has thrown it to the shadows, naming it only as its inferiorcounterpart. But darkness is also the Other that likewise shines; it is il-luminated not by light but by its own intrinsic luminosity. Its glow isthat of the lumen naturae, the light of nature, whose sun is not the starof heaven but Sol niger, the black sun.(214)Epilogue"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"notesIntroduction1.Zenkei Shibayama, Zen Comments on the Momonkan,p.28.2.C.

These considerations give rise to many compelling questions.

Are the organizations of defenses protective of the Self or of the ego?Does the Self feel anxiety over trauma, or is anxiety, as Freud suggests, inthe seat of the ego, which is then protected by archetypal processes of differ-ing kinds?

Schwartz-Salant, The Mystery of the Human Relationship:Alchemy and the Transformation of the Self.23.James E. Siegel has put forth an interesting variation on the idea of the micro-cosm in “The Idea of the Microcosm: A New Interpretation.” He states, incontrast or complement to Jung, “Whether or not the collective uncon-scious is a microcosm, the psyche in its entirety is a microcosm with thebody as the earth element,” and he feels that “this finding may have impor-tant consequences for our understanding of the human condition as well asfor our appreciation of Jungian thought” (52). In that article he speaks of aninner sun and moon, inner weather and climate, inner oceanography, andso on and concludes that we reside in an inner world in which “the innersun can be regulated to . . . access the unconscious and to influence if notcontrol the inner weather. This article’s microcosm concept is perhaps theopposite side of the same coin as analytical psychology, and it can perhapshelp to further establish the reality of the psyche” (72).24.

A great deal of uncertainty exists about the origins of Jewish mysticism andKabbalah. Gershom Scholem writes about this issue in his book Origins ofthe Kabbalah.He notes, “The question of the origin and early stages of theKabbalah, that form of Jewish mysticism and theosophy that appears tohave emerged suddenly in the thirteenth century, is indisputably one of themost difficult in the history of the Jewish religion after the destruction ofthe Second Temple” (3). Different traditions of Jewish mysticism have datedthe origins to much earlier sources, but such attributions are difficult toauthenticate.31.Drob describes the sefirot as “the traits of God and the structural elementsof the world” and notes that “they should be capable of providing us withinsight into both God and the totality of the created world” (KabbalisticMetaphors,p.49).32.Two sources for further elaboration of this theme are The Tree of Life;Chayyim Vital’s Introduction to the Kabbalah of Issac;Luria’s Palace of AdamKadmon;and the Gates of Light,by Joseph Gikatilla.33.From von Rosenroth, Kabbala de Nudate,Frankfurt, 1684; referenced byKurt Seligman in The History of Magic.34.

Edingerquotes Jung’s Mysterium Coniunctionis:I must point out to the reader that these remarks on the significance ofthe ego might easily prompt him to charge me with grossly contra-dicting myself. He will perhaps remember that he has come across avery similar argument in my other writings. Only there it was not aquestion of ego but of the self....I have defined the self as the totalityof the conscious and the unconscious psyche, and the ego as the cen-tral reference-point of consciousness. It is an essential part of the self,Notes to Pages 136–50(227)"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"and can be used pars pro toto[part for the whole] when the signifi-cance of consciousness is borne in mind. But when we want to lay em-phasis on the psychic totality it is better to use the term “self.” There isno question of a contradictory definition, but merely of a difference ofstandpoint. (Mysterium Lectures,93, para. 133)Edinger himself goes on to note the following: “So the sun as the symbol ofconsciousness represents both the ego and the Self. The reason for thatdouble representation is that the Self cannot come into conscious, effectiveexistence except through the agency of an ego. Needless to say it can comeinto plenty of effective existence without an ego but it can’t come into con-sciouslyeffective existence without the agency of an ego. That’s why it is un-avoidable that the symbolism of Sol, as the principle of consciousness,represents both the ego and the Self ” (94).14.Niel Micklem, Jung’s Concept of the Self: Its Relevance Today,papers from thepublic conference organized in May, 1990, by the Jungian PostgraduateCommittee of the British Association of Psychotherapists.15.Niel Micklem, “I Am Not Myself: A Paradox,” in Jung’s Concept of the Self:Its Relevance Today,papers from the public conference organized in May,1990, by the Jungian Postgraduate Committee of the British Association ofPsychotherapists, p. 7.16.Ibid., p. 8.17.Ibid.18.Ibid.19.Ibid., pp. 8–9.20.

From Jung’s point of view, theconiunctio was identified as the central idea of alchemical process. He him-self saw it as an archetype of psychic functioning, symbolizing a pattern ofrelationships between two or more unconscious factors. Since such rela-tionships are at first incomprehensible to the perceiving mind, the coniunc-tio is capable of innumerable symbolic projections (i.e., man and woman,king and queen, dog and bitch, cock and hen, Sol and Luna).” From A.

Lacan’s “petite a” is a profoundly polyvalent concept and the subject of liter-ally thousands of pages of exegesis in Lacan’s work. That said, Bruce Finkdiscusses it in terms of “the residue of symbolization—the real that remains,insists, and ex-sists after or despite symbolization—as the traumatic cause,and as that which interrupts the smooth functioning of law and the auto-matic unfolding of the signifying chain” (Bruce Fink, The Lacanian Subject:Between Language and Jouissance,p.83).81.Jung, Mysterium Coniunctionis,p.98, para. 117.82.

Critchely and Dews, Deconstructive Subjectivities,p.26.94. Lévinas, for instance, criticizes Heidegger’s transsubjective concept of Da-seinby noting that “Dasein is never hungry” (Critchely and Dews, p. 30),and Hillman chooses to rely on the word “soul” as opposed to Self becauseit retains a connection with the body, with physical and emotional concernsabove love and loss, life and death. “It is experienced as a living force havinga physical location” and is more easily expressed in psychological, meta-phoric and poetic descriptions (Hillman, The Myth of Analysis,p.207).Both Lévinas and Hillman share a number of overlapping concerns.Both are critical of the primacy of a theoretical model of consciousness inwhich the subject maintains an objectifiying relation to the world mediatedthrough representation. Both support a movement toward a revisionedsubject as an embodied being of flesh and blood, a subject who is fully sen-Notes to Pages 181–87(231)"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"tient and in touch with sensation and who is “vulnerable” and “open towounding” (E. Lévinas, Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence,p.15),filled with “jouissanceand joie de vivre”(Critchely and Dews, p. 29).In addition, both Lévinas and Hillman share a unique, ethical sensibil-ity. For Lévinas, ethics is fundamental, and the entire thrust of his Other-wise than Beingis to “found ethical subjectivity in sensibility and to describesensibility as a proximity to the other” (ibid., p. 30). What this means forLévinas is very different from our usual understanding of ethics. For him,“Ethics is not an obligation toward the other mediated through” formalprinciples or “good conscience.” Moral consciousness is not an experienceof values but an access to exterior being—to what he calls the Other. Froma psychological point of view, this begins to sound like the capacity to seebeyond our narcissistic self-enclosure and actually to have contact withsomething outside of our own egos. The subject is subject to somethingthat exceeds us (ibid., p. 26). The “deep structure of subjective experi-ence”—the responsibility or responsivity to the other—is what Lévinascalls Psyche (ibid., p. 31). Likewise, the thrust of Hillman’s archetypal psy-chology is a movement beyond the narcissistic enclosure in which the aimis a “psychotherapeutic cure of ‘me’,” in which all the me-ness has beencooked out of our emotions (Hillman, “Concerning the Stone,” p. 259).This comparison of Lévinas with Hillman is not meant in any way toequate their thought. A real comparison of their work would require an in-dependent study of what each thinker means by terms they use in common.For instance, the subject for Lévinas is an embodied “me” and nobody else,whereas, as we have seen, for Hillman the “me” is what is to be “cured” and“cooked.” This may or may not be more than a terminological differencesince, for both, the “psyche” is not an instance of some general concept orgenus of the human being: an ego, self-consciousness, or thinking thing,and “both move beyond a concept of an abstract and universal ‘I.’”For Lévinas, the subject is not hard and autonomous but soft, weak, pas-sive, sensual, and fleshy. In Jungian terms, such a subject is one who has in-tegrated the feminine, the anima,the soul. In The Myth of Analysis,Hillmanputs it this way: “[P]sychotherapy achieves its ultimate goal in the whole-ness of the conjunction [in the] incarnation of durable weakness and un-heroic strength” (p. 293). For him this means an end to the “repudiation offemininity” and a termination of misogyny, when we “take Eve back into(232)Note to Page 187"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Adam’s body, when we are no longer decided about what is... inferior,what superior, what exterior, what interior; when we have taken on andtaken in all those qualities not per sefemale but which have been projectedonto women and seen as inferior.” To take back this “inferiority” leads to-ward the therapeutic goal of the coniunctio, which would now be experi-enced as a weakening—rather than an increase—of consciousness. Thismeans “the sacrifice of the mind’s bright eye” and a “loss of what we havelong considered to be our most precious human holding: Apollonian con-sciousness” (ibid., p. 295). Since women as well as men are subject to theinfluences of modernism, their consciousness can likewise be dominated byApollonian identifications, and a similar integration of anima values canlead to a coniunctio that sacrifices the bright eye, which stands above its ob-jects in a specular way. Hillman and others have stated that the anima islinked not only to the psyche of men (Hillman, Anima: An Anatomy of aPersonified Notion,pp.53–55).“A therapy that would move toward this coniunctio would be obliged tostay always within the mess of ambivalence, the comings and goings of thelibido, letting interior movement replace clarity, interior closeness replaceobjectivity, the child of psychic spontaneity replace literal right action”(Hillman, Myth of Analysis,p.295).In Hillman’s emphasis on closeness, movement beyond objectivity, andspontaneity, his thought resonates with that of Lévinas. The subject Hill-man describes is resonant with Lévinas’s postdeconstructive subjectivity ofa “subject afterdeconstruction” (Critchely and Dews, p. 39).95.
