As man ventured to explore the darkness and the secrets it held, the first rites of the ancient craft, conducted under moonlight, were born. The d.oorways within man hi11lself ,vere opened and the unseen forces began to show themselves. Hecate Goddess of all Witchcraft and the watchers under Her rule, led by Her son and brother Lucifer, came forward to meet those few who ventured into the darkness, to answer their call. Here we received the very first teachings from those Witch Gods who predate all myths. In these teachings we learned of the Tree, the route of spiritual ascension to difterent dimensions along pathways to and through other worlds. Hecate and Her children taught spell-crafting, how to affect and manifest changes by bending the elements through will, desire and belief upon the inner planes. The purpose of these teachings? Spiritual advancement. The ascension of the soul, the mind and the spirit. This is the hidden path in Witchcraft, the one that is the route against the natural current, upstream back to the source of all power. Hecate is the patron of the path of the Dark Side. For it is upon this path that we learn to negotiate the nightside of the Tree of Life, the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Death. This is the realm of the witch, our sacred secret universe with its own teachers and guides. This is a place of power, of testing, learning and becoming. A place where man can learn to leap. It is upon these teachings brought to us by the Dark Goddess and her fold that we have built our Witch Craft. '\"Do l(Oil kIlO,(l how I e;uruiI'c ill t!le hearte; alld fllillde; o(lffl711killd?

This is the true domain of the first Goddess. Hecate's followers look beyond the human constructs of good and evil, as the denizens of the Witchcraft world exist beyond this veil. Connection to the Goddess is to be achieved with love and devotion. Following the path She lights through the dark corridors of spiritual advancement, absorbing the knowledge She brings and the teachings She imparts, it is Love of the Goddess that will unlock all the gateways. With rites and rituals we offer this love and devotion on the material plane, that is, Below. Hecate comes first at the doorway of Malkuth/Yesod, the gate of Moon. For though She is the highest tip of the initiating power or trident of Witchcraft, Her lunar feminine current, stepped down from its stellar form, is more compatible with humans than the higher frequencies of some of the other teachers of the art. As She clpproaches us through the lunar gate we undergo an initiation which strengthens our minds and subtle bodies. In doing this, portals of power arc opened, Her current flowing through and accessing for LIS the rt'alm of possibilities, of wllich the astral plane is the first level. On the clstral are performed the Sabbats, both Empyrean (day side) and Infernal (night side); this is the work of Abouc. The rill's of possession are the height of worship. The body is the :emnle ill \\\\'1 .

In the ecstasy of possession we see with their eyes. This is our preparation for further encounters with other guides, for though they are not necessarily hostile, the frequency at which their power and current vibrates can be disturbing to us. The power and presence of the Goddess both protects and assists in human interaction with these other intelligences. It is in these works that our awareness is elevated to the conscious dreaming state. Here are the crossroads of Witch Lore marked by the three crossed staves. Whether we are traversing the paths of the right hand pillar, the left hand pillar, the middle pillar or whether we leap to the shadow side of the Tree, all are accessed by the gate of the three crossed staves.

It is through this powerful love and communion with the Dark Creator of the Witchcraft that we unlock the secrets of the universe. Transformations C1rried upon the ecstatic wave of power that is brought into this sexual congress with the Dark Divinity are the energies and essences of tr,lnsformation itself, those which flow from the throne of Hecate, beyond Thaurniel, through both sides of the tree, now increased by the sexual rite in progress.

It is through this process that we observe one of the purposes of the transmutation of the subtle bodies, making them more crystalline; for in the essence of the soul will be recorded and later remembered those keys and rites. By exploring within as well as beyond, we are able to release and use much power and many talents and gifts bestowed by the Queen of Hell in past lives. Drawing upon this will therefore assist in achieving maximum gnosis and spiritual ascension in the present, as in literal application we embody the ancient addage of Kllo«(l thyself The point of release is also the infusion of the soul with Divine power, which when released by the Witch Goddess will explode through every energy centre; this is the moment when consciousness is at its peak as doorways that are normally hidden or sealed become accessible. The act in magickal devotion of inviting the Goddess to partake in this congress is the joining of two lovers, for Love is the key with which She will open the gates upon the inner planes. Thus begins the process of change as crystalline power flows through all parts of the self, taking its initiatory effect upon the subtle bodies, the mind's awareness, and the soul.

It is the crossroads of legend, of which Hecate, the Goddess of all Witchcraft is the patron. She looks down each pathway simultaneously, watching all those who would follow Her to this spiritual junction. The three crossed staves indicate a meeting point of the triple powers, the energy of three wads, the three paths or pillars of the Tree of Knowledge which merge as they meet at the sphere of Lilith, and again at the throne of Lucifer in Thaumiel as they are traversed upon the crooked path of the nightside travellers who weave their way through the shadows in the darkness towards the Queen of Hell, the crossing points of each pathway illuminated by Her torches as She leads us through the initiations of our ancient craft. The crossed roads are indicative of the waking, sleeping, dreaming state of higher consciousness through which may be attended the astral s,lbbat. It is in this mode of higher conciousness, attained through meditation, transmutation or mind state elevated through powerful rites, such as those of sexual magickal ritual, that we meet face to face with the Gods of Witchcraft.

This is a love and devotion that is understood and reciprocated by the Witch Gods to whom we aspire to stzmd shoulder to shoulder as we walk the path of the Queen of Hell. Initiation This is the acceptance into the dark fold and subsequent passing on of power. There are manv structures and formats of initiation but there is one consistency. That is the declaration of dedication and intent, the pledge of loyalty. You may up to this point have courted the Queen of Hell in ritual, with honour and the devoted offering of the self to Her. In undertaking the rite of initiation you are declaring your un-requited love. This ritual requests the power, knowledge and protection in all realms of the Goddess of Witchcraft. The energy that flows through the being .lS a result of choosing this path is the torch which burns in the blackness of night. The power of the Lady of Darkness will illuminate the very being, marking you as one of Her children. ln all true and genuine rites of initiation, those performed with heartfelt intent and focussed mind, there lies a hidden door. This is not a doorway that may be stepped back through once its threshold is crossed. This for many is the pledge to follow the path of Hecate beyond the mortal flesh, in love, in honour and in devotion. 34"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Rite of the Torchbearer \"True COllllllihllent is at the !euel 0( the ;;oul, oll/lj tiJelj tiJat ri;;l' to tiJi;; ;;/11711 trilly kJlOl(1 we.\" -HECATE This initiation rite of the \\'\\'cwing moon is performed from within the C,lst circle of the arte.

The Dark Goddess is the source of all magick in this arte; the being who gave birth to the legends of the great darkness parting itself to create light; when She made Lucifer, Her brother, son and consort in the Witchcraft. The throne of Hecate is situated in the darkness beyond Thaumiel, beyond the universal Tree itself. This is the stellar origin of the First Goddess, Her throne situated in the void beyond from where Her power flows reflecting through both sides of the universal structure of the Tree; for let us remember that though She is the Dark Goddess of Witchcraft, Hecate is the Queen of not only Hell, but also Heaven and Earth. Intrepid soul travellers journeying beyond the great abyss and riding the magickal current of the kalas of the Goddess accessed through the rites of sex magick have, over time, caught glimpses of the throne of Hecate; a structure, place and energy which projected by the soul is assimilated in the mind's eye as a stone seat atop a giant pyramid of steps. The throne of the Goddess may be seen through the moon of Thaumiel; which itself may be accessed beyond the throne of Lucifer; where stand the Old Gods of Khem absorbing Her power as it flows through this gateway to the spheres below. This moon is a portal through which can be seen the true realm of the Queen of Hell, in the darkness permeated only by green flashing fire, whirling outward into the endless void beyond.

Through these first encounters vvith Hecate, She enhances the being, in initiation and transmutation by altering our subtle bodies and minds thus preparing us for the forthcoming exposure to other members of Her fold, the other Witch Gods. It is the energies of many of these other teachers ;md guides, that in close proximity to our human form <md unprepared subtle bodies may cause disturbance or even harm; without the transitional changes effected by the Goddess, elevating our own spiritual energies thus allowing us to interact with these beings. Hecate expands our minds and spiritual beings in transmutation through the rites of sex magick, Her current charging our souls as the kalas which flow through the entire universe ignite the energy centres that join our many selves, initiating constant change and spiritual advancement, the evolution of the soul which allows the increase of magickal power as nights secrets are bestowed upon us by the Queen of Hell and Her kin. As our Witch Goddess, Hecate is the many faceted complex being upon whom we may call to banish a shade, re-inforce a necessary mcmifestation of a particular desired result, or petition for the transitional act of soul ascension thus attempting to reach beyond the Tree itself.

Evoking Hecate Before we consider the evocation of the other two members of the Trident, let us first deal with the exception to the rule, Hecate. The Queen of Hell is the universal initiating and all-powerful force which presides the rites of the Witchcraft itself. It is through Her power and will alone that you will be able to employ the rites of evocation in the above manner; elevated through and protected by, Her energy. Barring the later works of multiple evocation where it will be necessary to externally evoke the Goddess in order to merge Her power with that of the other Witch Gods, and those rituals which specifically require the evocation of Hecate to be external to the circle of arte, all rites of evocation of the Queen of Hell should if possible, be direct into the circle itself. The purpose of a cast circle when working solely with the Queen of Witchflame is to contain power, not to protect yourself from the Mother of the Craft. There is to be no attempt to bind the Queen of Hell within any point of manifestation. Apart from not being in any 1vay possible, it would be both disrespectful and foolish to attempt to bind the very Goddess who empowers the entire arte and ensures your own protection during the rites of evocation. It is also well worth taking note that a cast circle is no barrier to She who gave birth to the ancient craft of the witch, as you will no doubt experience at some point in your own work as Hecate moves at will through the perimeter of the circle of arte. I cannot stress enough that the purpose of physically evoking the Gods of the Witch realm is a learning process that will enclble you, among other tasks, to later perform very powerful rites requiring the presence of these teachers upon the material plane. The circle of arte is no more a barrier to the Goddess of Witchcraft than it is to a familiar spirit, and therein lies the V,lst difference between the path of the wise and the Christian exorcist. 44"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"A full evocation into the circk of the Queen of Hl'll is a ritl' that is performed on (111 levels, it is powlc'r that resonates through every plane.

Prince of Darkness, Lord of Light The father figure of the primal crLlft is the Great Horned God Lucifer. The first of the watchers and Gods crmted by Hecelte, this powcrful Dark Solar God who is known bv many names predLltes the cntirl' Christian mythos. Next only to Hecate, Lucifer is probably the most muti-faceted of all the watchers and Gods and is the second ruling tip of the power trident of the primal craft of tilt' vvise. Lucifer, like the other watchers and Witch Gods, is a shapeshifter and may appear in l11al1\\' different guises and though His natural and preferred image and persona upon appearance to the melterial plane is that of the Horned Lord, He will on occasion, usucllly during the rites of possession, prbent Himself as a young angelic male being. Lucifer is the Emperor of the Nightside Realm and Master of this Universe, ruling from His throne at the Inner Sanctum of Thaumiel, a position which makes Him Lord of all those who GlOW after Him. The confusion in human understanding of Lucifer comes in part from the many different names and titles that He possesses in many different cultures. Like Hecate, He is an extremely diverse being \\\\'ho to some is known as Sutekh, Set, Setian, Sethan or Sh<litan and to others He is the Son behind the Sun; the Dark Sun. The Goddess created Lucifer when She parted Herself to become two seperate beings one now of light, the other, Herself, remaining dark. As Hecate sits at Her throne beyond the entire Tree itself, so Lucifer watches all who would ascend the Tree from His throne at Thaumicl where many dark veils cover His true bce, hiding it from those too afraid to truly know Him. His dark solar energy is the exact opposite to the lunar flow of the Goddess and the merging of the two forces creeltes the balance of power that is necessary in mell1\\' magickal workings.

From then the power that is infused into the being by Lucifer during further work will yield an excellent sobr compliment to the lunM force of the Queen of Hell in Her lower initiatory form. The Horned God is the primary initiator, through the rites of Hecate, of the crossing in spiritual evolution of the dark Abyss. Lucifer's is the hand that is offered in assistance for the preparation of this most tremendous of spiritual undertakings and evolutions, while His darker half aids in the protection of those who would aspire to this both on the mundane and inner planes. it is the Horned God of Witchcraft who descends the spheres to collect the willing soul. Carrying it against the current of the pre-ordained dayside order, through the tunnels of the night that He knows so well in transdimensional travel and spiritual ascension to the higher spheres, preparing for the lone dark voyage and as such leaping the natural progression. Though His abode is that of Thaumiel, the realm of the Abyss and its crossing belong both to Lucifer and the great King Belial, for it is they who will prepare and guide you upon this, the darkest of nightside journeys. Lucifer is like all the Witchcraft Gods il teacher of the craft in His own right and He holds the keys to many secrets and doorways that will be encountered along the dark path of Hecate. There are five main sigils of the Great Horned God. Each sigil has different origins and is itself a separate junction belonging to this Witch God upon the lightning fi,lSh of ascension, consequently calling a separate vibration of Lucifer and at times performing a different function. In work of any kind with Lucifer and Belial the question is not which sigil to use; use them all; it is which should be the main ,md focal sigil within the work.

For instance if it is the demonic Christian Satan that you go looking for then initi<llly this may be what you encounter though this is not the true face of Lucifer. He is a D,1rk God, but He is far from inimicable to man. The veils of the Witch Gods if encountered, must be crossed in order to reach a higher understanding of these great beings.

Called Beelzebub in grimoires such as the Grimorium Verum, Belial is far more powerful than alluded to in the Lemegeton. Much confusion has arisen over time as to the origin and meaning of the many names of this Witch God with many concluding that the literal translation of Beelzebub or Beelzebuth, which means Lord of the Flies, is an insult to the original name. Yet there is vast significance in this name for it is Belial among others, who generates the buzzing noise that many have spoken of; both in regard to the Abyss, and upon His incursion through the planes. Though a separate being entirely, Belial is still very closely linked with Lucifer, being almost twinned with the Horned God, as His darker half. Created next after Lucifer He is what the Goddess describes as, \"The spawn of my spawn. U The link between Belial and Lucifer makes them almost interchangeable, this coupled with their ability to think collectively can be confusing to some, but they are very separate beings who have entirely different domains, despite sharing similar roles within certain realms. One of Belial's tasks under the will of the Dark Queen is assisting in preparation for the crossing of the great Abyss. It is the energy generated by the Great King; that which is created to infuse into and through the entire being which then lifts the spiritual vibration of the soul, mind and subtle bodies, thus assisting in the transition to the higher planes; which is one of the sources of this vibrational buzzing that is known as the howling in the Abyss. This buzzing, which is also related to the stripping away of the old and unwanted parts of the mundane self in myth and legend by devouring flies as the crossing is undertaken, is the source in part of the Lord of the Flies title and may be heard as Belial makes an unevoked incursion to the physical plane as is highly likely once firm working foundations with the full Trident have been established. It is, if you like, His signature. This Dark God will also use these tiny creatures as emissaries of physical manifestation un occasion. 57"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The titiL' of Bcl,l!

This Witch God is seldom unaccompanied in His incursion to the physical plane and though manv expect, as is written in the old grimoires, Belial to arrive with an ,lrray of familiars, they may be surprised to find that the Moires, the three D<Hk Witch Goddesses of legend ,lfe regular companions of the King of Hell. Belial's energy is at first contact calm, barely hinting at the power which lies beneath the surface and a far cry from the dimensional merging vibrational power which will be experienced by those who choose to enter the dark lake in their spiritual quest. The Great King is, like Lucifer, a Horned God with the ability to shape shift. A talent He will often employ as He changes not only His physical appearance but also the colour of His eyes which may appear anything from sapphire blue in evocation, to burning elemental amber upon incursion through the planes. Loyal to the children of Hecate, Belial like the other members of the Trident has dark veils which mask His true face, hiding it from all but those who would truly know Him in the name of the Queen of Hell. He is an excellent teacher of the Artes of the primal craft, particularly in the works of lllalefica. To the Christians Belial is the Prince of demons, as Beclsebcl, He is Lord of Lords; to the children of Hecate He is the third and final tip of the Trident of Witchcraft.

Any other offerings such as libations of brandy or specially carved and prepared sigils will always be 'Nell received by this great Witch God. A shapeshifter like so many of the Witch Gods, Belial sticks less rigidly to one particular form, preferring instead to manifest across a small spectrum of different persona. When seen in distant, non-evocational manifestation the King will sometimes show as c1 thin black haired man wearing a hooded robe. The similarity here to Lucifer's manifestation of a hooded being can be confusing, the only visual difference being that King Beliar's robe is a deep red. What makes things a little more complex with this imagery is that the two Witch Gods will sometimes interchange between their two projected manifestations, this is a small indication to their ability to think as a collective consciousness or hive mind. In non-evocational manifestation to the physical plane this mighty King of Hell often shows Himself as a red mottled skinned being with reptilian traits to His facial features; thlmgh there is an almost horselike appearance intermingled with this imagery. The horns of the King are much shorter than those of Lucifer and slightly inverted as they sweep back over His head. A serpentine appendage in the form of a coral snake can be seen hanging from each horn and writhing at the sides of Belial's face. The mighty Witch God will always, when manifesting in this manner, show Himself as having burning amber eyes which, much like those of Lucifer increase in their colour spectrum towards red as the energy of the manifestation intensifies. In stark contrast to this the Lord of the Earth will, in two way mirror work, manifest as a huge bald headed male entity (not to be confused with Eurynomous), \\\\\"ith piercing sapphire blue eyes. Quite apart from His immense power Belial is one of the most amazing beings to work with through the mirror gate. When used in this way the mirror is both positioned and opened within the circle. Belial will frequently manifest completely beyond the confines of the mirror itself 60"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"clnd into the sZlcred spZlce of the sphere of night. In yet another contrast to the aforementioned manifestZltions of the Great King, during evoCLltion of a more goetic nature, into the triZlngle of artc, Beliar may when called, show Himself as a shadowy fox faced entity hovering within the triangle. It is through some of these many different faces of the Witch Gods that they impart to us further gnosis. Identifying the many faces of the Gods is in itself a discovery of hidden symbolism which holds clues to the system, and is thus a guiding map, of spiritual ascension. This process illuminates both their own seemingly hidden aspects and their vast importance to those who choose to follow this path. During evocations of Belial it is important to know that the mighty King never travels alone. For though they may not always be seen or even felt the denizens of His many legions and very often the Dark Sisterhood will accompany this King of Hell, watching silently from the shadows. Once the formality of a goetic style evocation of Belial has been peformed it is highly likely that the Great King will become one of the closest teachers to those who are initiated into the lineage of the sacred blood, the very kin of Hecate.

This is not the place for sigil torture and chain rattling, which is not necessary when working under the energy cloa.k of the Queen of Hell. However, all spirits will test a. summoner, particularly in physical evocation. Those who would employ the methods of sigil torture forget that these are trans dimensional, eternal beings. It follows that if they should happen to be on the receiving end of this sort of archaic ceremonial magickal approach, from anyone hiding within the confines of a cast circle, then the spirits of the craft may reciprocate at a later date, not necessarily upon the Earth plane either! Time is on the side of the Great Watchers. Our purpose in goetic evocation is to acquaint ourselves with the higher echelons of the craft. Once a link has then been forged, we can open the gateways of power as we draw ourselves into closer physical contact with the Gods of Witchcraft both inside and outside the circle. The workings of invocation, transvocation and unified congress will shatter the restraints of restrictive fear based ritual, creating gateways through which you may learn to interact with the Gods and spirits of the Witch's craft; as one of them. The triangle of arte is a fixed point upon the physical plane, it is a clearly indicated area into which the being to be called may be invited, it is not a prison. This is evocation as a summoning, calling or invitation to those you wish to work with, not an attempted abduction. These beings are the Gods and spirits from whom you draw much of your witch power and who teach the means of acquiring further knowledge. The edges of the triangle may be adorned with the names of the Trident of Witchcraft. The name of Hecate is to be centred around the circle for it is She who is the ruling tip of the Trident itself.

Once boundaries hewe been established and bonds formed, it is a matter of formality to ilWi te the being to depart the triangle of arte and entering first the sphere of night, then vour own form. It is in the initialising of this advanced and much closer communion with Hecate's kin that one of the advantages and main purposes of goetic style evocation can be appreciated. This is the Witchcraft knowledge lost to those who only work with the confining triangle. Even post-evocation in works with very powerful Gods of the craft, such as Lucifer or Belial, the first impressions of possession may be felt; the subtle prickling sensation upon the skin, that touch which brings with it the ecstatic vibration of pure sexual bliss. Take careful note of these sensations, Witchcraft is much about learning to become sensiti ve to energy. This type of external connection marks the onset of possessive entry into the being, bringing with it the etheric and mental rapid flash exposures of the actual form of the beings who are making the connection. This is likely to be follmved or accompanied by sensations elm! sightings of the Gods themselves moving into and through your form. Glimpses of draconian features and the physical feeling of a reptilian tail passing through the body are the trademarks of both Lucifer and Belial. This type of experience can be either induced as a post evocational beginning to the further work, or may be the result of a n open portal.

Invoking the Witch Gods from inside the cast circle is the next necessary step. In this the triangle of Mte is dispensed with, for now. Sigillic Enchantment Possession may be induced via outward fascination of a sigil of an entity. Though if a connection between you already exists then simply calling the being in entranced fascination will suffice. The Gods of the Witchcraft are all watchers, they see and hear everything. Working in this manner with the teachers of the magickal arte will open the path for incorning transmission work through which some of the most powerful rites of the craft may be imparted to you; received as energy direct into the mind as they enter the being ensorcelled upon the current of the occupying Witch God. This chrystalline gnosis is stored within the self to be retrieved, and decoded from the cellular system of the physical body, ideally at the earliest point post ritual. Entrancement The Gods of the ancient craft may induce possession in a hypnotic fashion. This will be done if the kin of Hecate are encountered outside the circle of arte. It is achieved on their part by the entrancement of the indigo eye through visual fascination and the infusion of a powerful sexual current to the base energy point. The encompassing of the entire aura occurs as waves of ecstatic bliss elevate the senses. This is the point when some of the greatest and most potent secrets of the Witch's craft are imparted.

Just as in reverse it may, under the same conditions, be used as a point of entry to the realm beyond the gate of three crossed staves. The feeling of being pushed back or even displaced will often occur during possession, it will take time for you to allow this to fully happen. Though there . .l[e tried and effective methods to induce possession, there is no set path of entry for the Goddess Hecate when She chooses to partake of the flesh. The Dark Lady comes both from beyond and within. In calling the Queen of Hell to conjoin with you, focus on Her power arriving at the back of the head.

Inner Plane Possession As Goddess of all Witchcraft and Queen of Hell, Heaven and Earth; Hecate is not restricted to invocations or rituals upon the material plane. The Dark Goddess is the source and creator of all that exists upon the path of the nightside traveller. As such She can impart knowledge through teaching and the rites of possession upon the inner planes or any place of Her own choosing that exists between the worlds. To be called to this sabbatic congress feels akin to being pulled subtly but firmly down through the levels of consciousness. It is a summoning by the Goddess that has been likened to reverse evocation as the soul is drawn to, and collected by, the Witch Queen to be instructed in the artes in other realms. It leaves memories of a surreal dreamscape journey of sabbatic learning to be recalled upon return to the mundane sphere. EnsorceIling the Word As channelling in possession trance is the spoken word of the Gods, so automatic writing is the written word. Twinned with this is the ability to create a talisman or amulet blessed in the name of Hecate. This is then literally bound to the part of the body upon which you wish the possession to focus. In the case of automatic writing it is obviously the hand which is the focus of the localised possession. Through the employment of this technique further knowledge may be acquired, written as it were the hands of the Witch Gods themselves. A small amulet bearing the mark of Hecate and attached to a length of leather cord is ideal for this work. It should be blessed in sandalv\\'ood and rose incense through flame, water and salt before being consecrated by athame to the ether in the vortex at the Eye of Hecate into the service of the Dark Queen of Witchfire.

Love and Loss When great love has formed its powerful bonds and two lovers then become separated by the wheel of fate long before their hearts are ready to accept this detachment, it is possible to create a knot of trapped emotion. This entanglement of pure spiritual love can, by permeating the inner planes, cause the restricted spiritual progression of both the incarnate and now discarnate lover. Through invited possession, the process of bringing the discarnate love into the self elilows natural healing. There will always be occasions when this will !lot suffice and another path must be taken to resolve what will become no less than the pain of two anguished souls held neither together nor fullv apart in a state of agonising spiritual and emotional limbo.

The [,lce of the lost lover is often glimpsed in the act of sexual union as consciousness heightened sees the spirit essence; though for many who are not of the craft this is sirnply filed away in the back of the rnind as an emotionally triggered flash of memory. This re-union allows the emotions to untangle and thus settle themselves through the spiritual connection that is made between the t\\\\'o lovers through the unwitting third participant. There are instances, often due to the manner in which the lost love became discarnate, which can leave them spiritually disorientated and unable to intervene. This leaves two beings with deep rooted love unable to progress on their paths in any incarnation upon any plane. In performing the rites of re-birth, the Queen of the Dead, Hecate, may be petitioned to collect and bring forth the discarnate spirit so that both parties may be re-united and their hearts and souls find peace in an act of necromantic love and ritual possession. The Goddess is petitioned through the Western gate, Her lunar vibration being necessary to empower the rite.

While there may always be a preference for the nightside realm of possibilities of which our Dark Lady is pLltron, to rule out in entirety any contact with the many and extremely powerful denizens of the Empyrean realm would be to greatly marginalise one's ability. It would also be naive to assume that although She is Queen of Hell and patron of the nightside, that Hecate as a Goddess does not utilise the power of the Angelic realm. Petty squabbles over shades of daylight, darkness and spiritual territory are for the fantasies of the narrow-minded uninitiated members of the mundane world. The denizens of the worlds of light \"nd dark are the necessary balance to the universe. Polar Opposites Balance through re-polarisation may be greatly assisted by the ritualised opening of either side of the Tree. This allows the filters of the subtle selves to then effect the necessary balancing of the energies of light and dark which affect the status quo and daily health of the human system.

These spirit familiars quickly make connection and acquaintance with the other familiars, geni and spirit beings of the Craft. This will greatly aid you in your own working requirements as the familiar spirit uses these newly acquired spiritual liasons and its own magickal skills to assist you. Energising the Spirit The original pots are to have offerings at each full moon, replenishing the spirit with magickal energy that will allow its continued and loyal service to you and your work. In the case of a buried vessel the offerings may be spilt onto the ground directly above the location of the fetish resting place; in this way the spirit will still be able to absorb the offered energy. An altar vessel may be replenished directly onto the sigil. This is a task in which you must remain both loyal to the being that you have created and diligent in its performance. For if you neglect such a being then the lore of the mte is that it will be compelled to draw from your own energy in order to sustain itself. This depletion on your own energy, unchecked, could cause serious health problems and a neglected being will not be quite as willing to adhere to instructions when the issue must inevitably be addressed. Alongside the necessary magickal energy replenishment, you should bring offerings of flowers, tokens of affection and appreciation and (lther ritual honours to the fetish. This is all energy that the spirit will be able to both absorb and enjoy, making the working bond stronger and more efficient. 131"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"16 THE CAULDRON GATE After working with the spirit pot you em progress to the greater powers of the cc,uldron.

Directly in the centre of the Pentagram there is to be drawn a golden circle with three pentagrams in the middle of it, this represents the full manifestation of the Goddess through this gateway once it is opened. The pot is to be blessed and consecrated in the elements at the quarters. A binding ensures that no utiler being may pass through the gateway of the Goddess, unless of course, this is petitioned for in ritual. Once bathed in incense and dedicated into the service of Hecate, the interior of the vessel is ritually consecrated with your sexual fluid imbued with the kalas of the Witchflame Goddess. The prayers of sealing and binding will hermetically seal the vessel which is then buried at the desired gateway location and site of future rituals.

This grants us the ability, should we need to protect uurselves, of sumllloning great power and if necessary awakening that which even the Witch Gods themselves call upon to manifest their d,lrker aspects. Malefic Origins Malefica comes not from persecution at any point in history, but inste,ld from the very first teachings of the wcltchers. It is born out of the necessity to either defend oneself from harm or avenge ourselves from injustice suffered at the hands of another. Hecate taught first the arte of protection and binding and then tIle black artes of destruction. Like the many creatures of the old forest, the children of Hecate follow their Cl\\vn path; Her path. Just as the inhabitants of the woodlands will defend with tooth and cl(lw their kin and young, so the kin of the Queen of Hell ,lfe gifted with the gnosis of malefica with which they may defend their own. The rules of applying the power of malefica elre only as complicated as people make them for themselves. The Oldest Motives The deliberate psychic att,lCk «111 come in m,1I1V forms, and is usu'lllv the result of either jealousy or lust. The att,lCks themselves manifest in c1ny number of vvays, depend ing of course on hovv they are lau nched. Vlild c1ttacks C,ln range from ill luck to nl'g,ltivl' ,luric p,lin, a feeling of bruising upon the ,lura itself, often felt around the lwad. It is still difficult ,It this level to determine whether or not the ilttack is deliberate; though consulting the spirits of the craft will soon fatholll the answer. 135"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The question then. is whLlt to do Llbnut it. The answer is send it b,lck Or CLlncl'l it out. Both of vvhich are achieved by ViSu,llising the incoming energy connecting with the receiving h,lnd, which is then transferred directly; not via the body; to the projecting hand. The energy is then chLlnnellcd through the projecting hand which points a trident with the three middle fingers and is either returned to source or deflected into the earth. Negative energy that is returned to its source using the powers of the WitchcrLlft Trident will be greatly anlplified. The Signs Astrally launched hatred or deliberate attacks often manifest as scratches upon the skin. These look like old cat scratches, are never open wounds and are usually to be found on the face or sensitive parts of the body such as the breasts. The offender may be revealed to you, their images being shown in astral and mental flashes. The primary familiar is very capable of following the energy trail back to its source and dealing with the person on the other end of it. If the familiar is a goetic entity appointed by Hecate to guard Her children then the chances are that this process will be automatic. The Witch's Jar Those venomous people who retain some past life ability to send these sort of attacks unwittingly, will receive the same reciprocation from an angry familiar or guide as those who bunch the assault deliberately. In defensive aura shielding, Hermetically arrnouring the self and the simple casting of a circle of protection during the night which for the obvious reason of lowered defences is the traditional time of attack will usuallv send enough back to deal with the foolish culprit. Astral bells, adrenaline attacks and the odd night's sleep disturbed bv nightmares are strong indications that all is not well. A witch jar can be created bv filling it \\,\\'ith sharp offensive objects such as broken gbss and old rusty jagged metal. The remaining space is filled with body fluids and the j2Lr is sealed, blessed 2Lnd consecrated in the n2LnW and service of the Queen of Witchfbmc.

The magickal reciproccltion of this itl'lll will cause the offender pain sufficient enough to persuade them that they should divert their attentions to matters elsewhere, such as their own depleting health. It is the power and connection with the 'vVitch Gods thernst'lves that makes the construction of something so simple, so dangerous. Binding Once an offender has been indentified, then cl traditional method of binding with the use of amulets may be employed. The Rowan cross or variations on this theme incorporating the tying together with cord of two twigs as you chant a prayer of protection is a perfect example. The colour of binding is red, it is performed within the circle after sundown with Lucifer's eyes upon the work and Belial's immortal iron fist in prayer to hold fast that which would harm, no matter who or what they are. Binding is sure, it is steadfast, and when performed under these conditions it is breakable only by your own hand. The inclusion of sympathetic links to the subject of the binding such as hair, nail clippings, clothing etc will greatly aid the work. Blades of Bain Many of the ancient craft will not sully their beloved athame with the negative works of malefic magick. Instead they keep a second tool, blessed with Martial incenses in Belial's name for the sole purpose of directing and infusing the baneful elements that are conjured when the black malefic rites are required. This is the blade through \\vhich life itself mav be drawn, or the sympathetic doubles of others pierced in the grand bewitchment of the poppet. Undesired Attention Ihe sexual energies of unv\\'anted lustful astral congress can be surprisingly disruptive. Whilst there is not a great deal that can harm 137"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"your person in this way, the unwanted current that is transmitted during this type of attack can interfere with other magickal work. The Queen of Hell will not allow the advancement through the higher learning of Her craft to be obstructed bv others and if necessary She will manifest in warning. An incredibly dense, high frequency manifestation of the Goddess; in the form of a large black leopard; to the offending party may <It first seem fascinating when initially encountered by the would be attacker. That is until the vibration of the entire surroundings turns hostile. Forced telepathy issued from eyes which can change rapidly from deep green to a blazing furious red will leave the subject in no doubt as to why they have been approached by the highest level entity that they will ever see manifest freely before them. This is simply a warning to the astral pest not to interfere with the work of Hecate; She will not warn twice. The Feral Shadows Any unwanted presence, astral or otherwise may be removed from your immediate surroundings by the summoning of the Wolves of Hecate. The Wolves should not be employed as permanent guardians of the home or temple as their energy is, in the long term, inimicable to our own. It will create a paranoid environment if left unchecked. The wolves can be returned to their domain with a command from their summoner spoken in the name of the Goddess. 138"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Invocation of the Wo~f Spirits of Hecate [ SUI/II/WIT t/ie JIv'olf/'1l Spirit:. of Darkllc:.:.; The SilUilXe Shadow~ of the Queell of Hell; To tIle Will of the Go[i£le~~ onVitchcratt I billd you; Froll/ the Cllue~ bellellth the Gate of De 11th ill the West; I ellll 1/0U /lJrth, ALLU, ill the lIillile of Hecate; Through the Magid.-of the Quee)} of Witch blood fllld Fire; I EII~orcell your Ulltallled Feral Power; To I~elld a/Til to Tellr the IlItrllders of Night; I SUllllllllll you ALLU, BIllck Wolf DeIllOllS; Throllgh Illy ueillS rUllS tIle Blood offhe Kill ofHecl1tc; ALLU, I COllllllllllll thllt you heed, this, My m//_ 139"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Lore of Malefica If you IlIlISt bum thc Stlturnil7l1 alld Mnrtinl ill(CIISCS; A, you walk till' Widdcrshills Patli; To partake of the Lett Hallded ~Vork; UpOIl [(1Cl'k:; 4 till' Wallills, Mooll; Your chl7licc Fillcd [(litll bitter ,(1iIlC; As YOIi WCl7i:'C tllc Tl7l1glcfoot Clwnll; Billdillg nlld Blilldillg, Silellcillg 1711£1 Sl'l7lillg; As tile prayers ol/he Flllleral Iteld ill the Circle arc read; Tlll'l/ lea[1e KilrJlla to those ,(l/lOfeal\" to act; Alld ICilU!'

A certain discipline is required with powerful rites Such as this. However! human nature often leaves one with no other choice but to resort to these dark skills. The necessity and application remain the decision of the individual. Varnpyric Congress Entering the aura of another being is dangerous! particularly if they are spiritually protected. The higher and infinitely more powerful frequency of Hecate will often be required to armour yourself before departing your own physical form to facilitate access to the form of another living person. While this is a process that is normally used in malefic ways it is also a rite of heightened possession that may be performed by two lovers who! when separated by physical distance can enjoy sharing one another!s energies and more from within one body at the peak of sexual ecstasy.

Once sent to the astral self it may be used, because of its heightened vibration ,1l1d the nature of the energy itself, to enter the aura and consequently the very being of the intended. This is facilitated in much the same way that an Incubus or Succubus would gain access to a sleeping hum,tn form from the shadow side of the planes. By radiating the high level sexual current to the sleeping victim, infusing them with this powerful energy, you will arouse and elevate their own thoughts and desires. This causes them to have erotic dreams, releasing thoughtwaves and energies thZlt react to those which are being channelled inward. It is by riding these thoughtwaves and energies released in reaction to your own sexual current, back toward their source that the shield of the aura may be crossed and possession is gained. Once inside, the inner thoughts of the person you have occupied may be accessed, though they will have to be stimulated into rising as the mind is far from an open book at any level. The sexual transmissions that are used to gain access to the sleeping form of another in this way trigger the same reaction as the signals which are sent to the mind by Gamaliel. Creating and releasing the waves of sexual energy which are absorbed in an act of vampyrism, boosting the energies of the self.

King Belial's true role lies in assisting the evolutionary development of the soul for those who follow the Path of the Witch Queen. The fearsome reputation of this powerful Lord of the Earth and Great King of Hell is well deserved if encountered in malefica. Belial is the greatest of teachers and the worst of enemies. His tremendous power and dark persona make Him a formidable force of the malefic arte. The Power of Subjugation Belial is capable of opening incredibly powerful portals through which one or both of you may travel.

A petition upon virgin p,lrchment that has been bathed in thick incense smoke, with blood offered and dripped upon its surface, is an honour that you are extending. in worship, to the Gods of the primal craft as you request their aid in the rites of malefica. The invocational request written in your own red life force and sent forth in flames as an offering is always well received. Red Gates The sigils of the Witch Gods are the gateways which link their domains with our own.

You must tap the one place where there is an abundance of swirling darkness with which you can further empower your work, the Qlippoth. We should not, as the children of the Queen of Witchfire, fear summoning this energy for malefic work. The nightside realm is Her realm, Hecate as Queen of Hell is the Goddess of the Outsiders, the Patron of the Nightside. The Dark Goddess reigns supreme here.

There are several areas in which Lucifuge plays a particularly important role. The first being His ability to snatch the magickal power from another person with occult capabilities should they be attempting to send you harm. Lucifuge's talent for draining the psychic energy of one's enemies is of great assistance, and is matched by His considerable power to ensnare the will of others. If you find yourself needing to disentangle your own aura from an attempted magickal assault this powerful entity will assist all who walk the path of Hecate. The Records Keeper As Records Keeper Lucifuge records all acts of Grand Bewitchment and malefic acts of serious harm in which the po\\ver of the Witch Gods themselves is called upon, summoned or in anyway conjured to assist in or execute this work. This gives the children of the Queen of Hell one of the greatest and most lethal forms of black magick. Lifetimes of Pain The prevention of an evil soul's return to the incarnate form requires you to petition the ruling Witch Gods Hecate and Lucifer for the power to call forth the Records Keeper. This is His role as authority presiding the specific act of malefica that will bind another to the depths of the Abyss itself.

The Earth Dragon In the realm or Namaah rests the mighty force of Draconian power that is Behemuth, the Earth Dragon.

It creates a living circle of not cast, but coiled protection during the three nights of the moon's darkness in the cemetery whilst the Rite of the Waters of the Moon is performed.

Leaping the Path The methods of effecting the leaping forward of the soul in its elevation through the process of spiritual transmutation are varied through different rites and rituals. There are, though, several which when correctly performed will effect an almost immediate reaction, triggering the r<1pid evolution of the soul itself.

The entrance to the Inner Sanctum can be found in Lucifer's realm, within His chamber at Thaumiel. A gateway that \\vill manifest to the mind as a solid stone door marked with a dragon's head that is flanked by two flaming torches. This particular route to the Inner Sanctum will only be revealed through work with the Queen of Hell. She is the guide to this realm, into cmd through the secret passages of Her kin. It is the ecstasy inducing power of the Dark Goddess which facilitates ingress to this point in astral travel. Though the chamber of Lucifer may be accessed through the various techniques and rites, such as Hell's Mirror, the path to the Inner Sanctum and its opening are works which belong to the Goddess alone. Astrally or otherwise, the door which leads to the actual chamber of the Inner Sanctum; if not opened on your behalf by Hecate; must be opened with blood. This is run through the dragon's head seal upon the door itself. In pre-astral ritual you must initialise this process with a rite held within the circle where a carved sigil may be used to petition physically that which you may then repeat astrally with your body of shade once the door is reached. In this way both inner plane door and blood red key may be matched, unlocking the gateway to further knowledge. Beyond Mind and Body Do not allow these descriptions of the astral manifestations of incursions to the Inner Sanctum of the Witchcraft of Hecate to draw you into a journey purely of the mind. The actual journey of the soul to the Inner Sanctum is one that will, for those who perform it, become a voyage that \\vill be experienced on all planes.

Once they have been opened to the individual, thev cannot again be closed. It is for this reason that some of the rites carrv sp,lls of protection upon their workings.

They are that which came before the age of man. A prim;ll force of dark spirits, the shadov\\'s who existed in service to the Dark Goddess before even the scythe bearing shades of folklore. The Legion may be summoned to bind any spirit, human, Qlippothic or utherwise, so great is their power. The gnosis of summoning these awesome shadows is of the Inner Sanctum, it is the raw power of these beings which makes this a ritu<11 which belongs only to the Trident of the craft, under the dominion and will of the Queen of Witchflame. This work is a dark yet powerful addition to the craft of any Witch. The Legion are extremely effective in the works of malefic magick. If such extreme use of power is necessary then so be it, but know that the Legion once awoken, unleashed and committed to such work cannot be halted by another mortal hand, sorcerous or otherwise. Only the might of the Trident can halt such <:In amassed force of dark povver that has been given destruction as its primary agenda. The Legion are not to be confused with the rnighty shades of those long deLld. They are not of human origin and existed long before the ancient ascended mortals.

Power Bestowed It falls within the power of the God of Witchcraft Lucifer to grant the allegiance of a Legion of Night. The Horned ruler of Thaumiel must be called to full physical manifestation and your petition put forth. This is, you could say, a pact. It is unlikely that Lucifer will request in return much more than the diligent use of this tremendous power. Like all watchers He will be fully aware of your intentions before they are stated. Lucifer's carved sigil, the glyph of the Gateway to the City of Pyramids will be required for this work. Traditionally made of stone for such a rite, you will be able to access this work with one that is carved of a darkened wood. During this first meeting with Lucifer; to be held on the night of the dark moon to discuss the allocation of this power; the sigil must be placed at the point of manifestation. Upon agreement to the work, the Dark Horned God will saturate it with His own energy, empowering and encoding it as a key. One with which you will open the gateways of power that will release the Legion. This stone or seal is also the talisman by which they may be commanded. Once the work with Lucifer is completed during this initial opening of the gates which hold the Legion, the sigil is to be wrapped in black silk. It must be kept safe in a magickal chest, brass box or the altar of Hecate until the next dark moon when you will summon the Legion of Night. 178"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"I ~ summoning the Legion The cloak of Hecate is cast and the prayer of the Circle Gate is performed in the name of the Queen of Hell to strengthen the current which flows through this work.

In one widespread application, the ritual entails impaling a live toad to a blackthorn bush until it is dead. The form of crucifixion here shoWing the toad outstretched, so symbolic of the mind of one who is stretched in all directions as they are crossing the abyss, holds more significance than an antimonial interpretation of the Christian crucifixion tale; though this does hold svvay for SOme. Once dead the toad must then be taken to an ant hill or mound where it is placed until the bones are picked clean by the small creatures that are so closely linked in many ways, symbolically and otherwise with the infernal host. Upon the night of the full moon once the latter tasks had been performed the bones were cast, in ritual and prayer to the Gods of the Witchcraft into a steam of running water to observe and obtain the one bone that would resist the natural flow of the stream's current, this being the toad bone in question from which the charm is made. This bone had to be seized with the projecting arm of magickal power and kept safe on the person at all times until the three nights of the dark moon; the third being the night of the dark moon itself. These three dark nights were to be spent in a cemetary as evocations and prayers to the Dark Witch Gods of the craft were rnade for the power of the witch's craft. On the third night the Devil would appear and attempt to take or tempt the bone from the summoner. Depending upon who was successful of course the power of the witch would either be given or the summoner and all that they were was lost and belonged to the Devil.

There is a place in witch lore for sacrifice, but the sacrifice of certain creatures requires the approval of the Witch Gods themselves through powerful omens, signs and messengers. To ignore this and follow the path of the ego, is to defy Hecate directly. Mankind have notoriously continued to follow their egos when no signs have ever been granted, and as lore and legend will show, have paid the price for attempting to take that which is not rightfully theirs. It is from this action of defiance, at least in part, that the legends of the toad rite's ability to cause insanity stem. Though there are also the effects of the crossing of the Abyss itself to be considered. If the rite of sacrifice is granted in no uncertain terms then the toad must first be sought. The very first toad encountered in the search is, by decree of the Dark Goddess, the intended sacrifice of this rite. It must be killed with ritual ceremony and honour to both the beast and the Witch Gods. The ritual of c;ucifixion may then be followed as the toad is bound in cross formation to a blackthorn bush. [n killing the toad, it would LX' unwise to attempt to draw into oneself the spirit of the omen carrier of the Witch Goddess. In the case that the being put before vou is .1 familiar whom Hecate has decided mU5t return to the subtll' planes, you may find that i1ttL'l11pting to (lbsnrb this foreign daemon spirit, of infernal origin, a very unpk.1S(lnt experience indeed! 186 ,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"ThE' binding of the toad in the shape of a cross is the physical symbol of one's sanity being stretched to the four quarters of the universe as the soul experiences the dark crossing that will be triggered by this rite.

If full preparation is not adhered to and the toad is left to die slowly, still living upon the point of its crucifixction, then as it experiences a slow and needless agonising death, so will this experience be mirrored upon your soul during the death of your old self as the process and journey through the dark wastelands of the fallen souls becomes longer and more drawn out than was ever anticipated. Here the law of As Abo(le, 50 Below is reversed in ironic and agonising transmutation. It is in the many possibilities of misinterpretation of the many signs and symbols that the curse of the toad rite may be realised.

Its appearance will be preceded with an abundance of wyrd, omens and dreams before the envoy of the Goddess will, at the correct moment be gifted, its life recently passed or passing before you. The method of death is not important. It is chosen by the Goddess. The creature is, upon this opportune moment a gift from the Goddess of Witchcraft to be accepted immediately.

The Dragon's Flight Breaking the perfection of the circle to kneel at the centre of the pentagram at the point of the merging twin Draconian currents allows the pure energy of Hecate and Lucifer to flow into your Ov\\'n being. The three keys meet within the lock of the five fold star to open the nine gates of the Gods. This releases the unlimited power of the magickal fire of transformation. The crystal spheres are to be taken back into the circle. The rite continues in an unmatched act of love and ecstatic power that releases the twin ophidian forces. In this ecstasy which knows no limits, the twin possession will take you beyond the Heights and Depths of Ernpyrean and Infern<!l. As you ride the dragon; a force created in this unity; the Dark Gods of the Ancient Witch Craft are exalted above the sunset back to the stars and the cosmic order. In exalting the Gods, you exalt and free every part of the self. You free your soul! As the path of the Dragon continues, tIle flames of the Witch Gods; the magickal fire that is released from the gateways of the Gods opened both within and without; will begin to devour and destroy the old self. Flashes of worlds beyond time will be glimpsed during this draconian journey. Powerful messages from both Witch Gods will be received. The process which begins within the circle, continues long after this rite is finished until total transmutation has been achieved. The dark hidden doors to the beyond are now fore\\'er shattered, no steps arc re-traced from this work, there is no return, there is onl \\' reborn.

They are now encoded with many magickal keys. The huge influx of sigils and symbols that will be revealed will unlock yet more occult power and gnosis of the craft. The spheres may be worked through the seven main energy points making the absorbtion within of the power and gnosis easier through the subtle bodies, as crystal key fits snugly into etheric lock. The Nine Gates of the Gods Through the meditational work with the charged spheres the Nine gates of the Gods and their purpose will be revealed.

The Amber stone In performing the Rite of the Phoenix the Magickal Fire of the Gods is not all that is released. Contained within this, the most powerful of tr,ll1smutational works, is yet another sacred occult formula. This work is the conjoining of the sexes, the Solar 12 with the Lunar 13, which creates the magickal formula of the perfect Pentagram. This in turn opens the Bloodstone Gate. Astral gifting of the Red gem to you by Lucifer will confirm the opening of this gatevvay. This powerful process shatters another old gateway releasing from its amber chamber another very ancient being. For those who wish to l'xplore this path the door to its mysteries stands open. This being may not wait for invitation before making His presence felt. It will often manifest not only to those who are marked as children of the Dark Queen, but to those close to them. Those who have not undertaken this work are relatively unarmoured and thus slightly exposed to the being's advances from beyond the open door which leads to the depths of the Abyss.

The very physical presence of Lucifer in His m.:my forms will stretch the mind as His Dark Solar vibration pushes down upon the aura further effecting the magickal transition. This very close proximitv has its purpose as the power and presence of the Horned God assists in heightening the already elevated alkhemical transformation which commenced with the opening of the Gateways of the Gods during the Phoenix rite itself. Through the Eyes of the Horned God During the intense possession work that follows the Rite of the Phoenix vou will be able to see the worlds and realms of the Gods themselves. This is not meditative gateway work, this is the energy of the Lucifer elevating your own spiritual power. Every wall or door becomes a gateway to another dimension. Surfaces become first porous, then fall away to reveal the very real and almost tangible existence of realms such as the blood soaked subterranean tunnels of the world below the Chambers of Thaumiel. Looking this way through the eyes of a being such as Lucifer employs a very powerful tool, fuelled by the energy of the God Himself. The vibration is very heavy and can after time become suffoca ting. With Ie·nough presence of mind you can learn to aim your gaze in order to explore chosen realms directly from the physical plane.

Not all who walk this path will reach its end, this is the nature of such work, inevitably some will fall. First Communion Upon the night of the first full moon after The Rite of the Phoenix has been performed, communion is to be held with the Witch Gods of the Trident from within the circle. This marks the sealing of the Rite, its formal conclusion culminating in full possession with the Queen of Hell. The signs and symbols of the Bennu bird should be both anticipated and looked for in all aspects of being. This is the mark of magickal transformation.

This is a journey that must, under Witch law, be undertaken alone. The gift offered by Lucifer in the palm of His hand; to the children of Hecate who are to (fOSS the desert of fallen soul travellers; is that of a camel. The camel is the symbol of all that is required to complete the journey. All that \\\\·ill be needed can be found within the self, within the inner parts of the mind and soul. The Gates of Astaroth will strip bare all those who undertake this crossing. Here the ego is destroyed and the Moires step forward from the shadows to cut the last cords which hold the soul to any pre-ordained path. King Beliar watches closely all those who attempt this dark crossing, awaiting their arrival upon the distant shore of another world. Any ego left within the self will be more ripped, than stripped, away by the forces of total transmutation which operate from within the depths of the Bbck Lake. Night's Crossing The Abyss, like those who rise through it and those who dwell permanently in it, has its own unique sound. The vibrating hum of the whirling vortex, the open gate that may be seen by both the waking and dreaming mind in crossing, but glimpsed by none who will not dare to enter its Darkness. Once the Gates of Astaroth have been opened and the Darkness entered, visions and manifestations of the lurker can be seen in abundance as the soul forges its path beyond the domain of that which devours all who do not make the crossing.

These two sounds and vibrations will penetrate through to the inner mind, for some this is the sound of insanity. The Abyss itself falls under the dominion of Lucifer; He watches el11 who cross and knows that for those who are prepared, this noise is the key to the gates behind which lie many dark secrets. These sounds which feel so inimicable to the human svstem are the sounds of freedom and power.

Crossing through the Gate of the Silver Star The path of the broken line is once again walked reaching the energies of the Dark Goddess from beyond the gate of the seven stars, Breaking the circle at this point will shatter the gate which leads beyond Thaumiel's moon. The evocational point of Hecate's manifestation must be entered and the stellar energy of the Dark Lady absorbed in slow contemplation of this act and its everlasting effects upon the mind and soul. Witchblood must flow from both arms, as the double current fills the key to the stargate of the Seven Stellar Sisters; the gateway to the Throne of Hecate. The Goddess' energy and Her stellar kalas will enter every part of you; mind, body and soul. As the essence of life and blood magick fills the Silver Star key, the Queen of the Elder Gods answers the call of the Phoenix before Her; the soul \\vho wishes to take flight in eternity, at the time of the body's passing. The prayer of the Silver Star is given as your blood fills the key. 231"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Prayer of the Gate of the Silver Star Where Four ElclIlClltS l1lcet tile Fittll will Rise; Frolll Belilll's Lllilds through till' LUllllr Cllte; A Path I will Rum throllgh ti,e Heart of til(' SUII; Across till' Darkest Lllke ill to the Desert ofNigllt; The Black TOl[ler of the \\I\\'a.stelllllds; CIIStS its Sll!1do[[l at IIll/llCels liS I pIlSS; FolI()«(lilig the Rlluell'st7igllt, [ridc UpOIl tile CcrilCntS' imcA: TlmJ[[gll a Lalld of Killgs, to filld a RCIIll1l of ThnJlles; ~,\\!llere sits the Great Homed God; At the I<.iuer of F/alllcs; Ti,e Dllrk SUII Lights the Path of the [lIl1er COl'ell; III this Pillce ofMidllight wherc the Old Gods Pmt/; To the Quecll ofDarkncss, wlw CIIIIIC betrJr(' all Anciellt Kin; Her Seat of Stolle lies beljolld Tlul/lll1iel's MoolI; Froll7 Lllcifer's Flal1Ies the Phoellix [uill Risc; Two Broken Pllths showlI blj Three ~,\\!itc!1 Gods; The Crossillg is lIIade tOil Stllr belfolld a Star; The Gllte of SeuclI Sisters is the Wal/ of the 0111'; Here is placed the Giftfroll/II Priestess; Shillillg ill till' Black of Nigllt, 11 Sih'cr Star Key; The Thirteell th Door opells to the Reallll ofa Goddess; The CroWII of Kllowledge IIl1d FreedO/lI, I clailll at the Throllc of Hecllte; Now ill Etemih/ Reborn, to 1111/ Queell I Retllm.

Merging with Hecate in ecstatic bliss and spiritual rapture will reveal images of the worlds and even the void itself, which lie in eternity beyond the Throne of the Goddess. These will be seen in portal flashes as gateways shattered by the stellar power of the Dark Divine yield a glimpse of the secrets which await those who would know the Queen of Hell in Her true realm beyond the reaches of time. The Silver Star key is to be kept in a safe place lovingly wrapped in white silk, the altar is the perfect location. The black candle must be buried upright. It is the tower of Lucifer which shall never fall. Beyond the Silver Star This work completed will advance the spiritual being, ,1t the end of this physical incarnation, to a state of crystalline existence. This is the key to sustaining the existence, beyond the realms of the ever circulating veils of time. During the current incarnation ne\\v mental and telepathic links are forged and existing ones increased. This is the culminatinn thus far upon the Path of the Goddess in this ancient cr,lft. Gifts, such ,1S the Ring of Eternit\\·, will be received from the Dark Goddess, m'1fking the soul, directing its course when the time is right, to the Throne of Hecate. 233"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"New currents which will Lll' crossed with and earthed to the existing deep energies which flow from the Dark Goddess will assist in the further spiritual evolution of this arte. Beyond this work lie the Paths to the Stilr beyond the Star. Both upon ilnd within them arc those kin of Hecate who have <1lready stepped beyond the mapped and documented worlds. Since She created Lucifer, the first of Her kin, Hecate has opened Her arms to all who would walk Her Pilth, following the torchlight of Her gnosis in the spiritual ildvancement and evolution of the sLlul. Through the Aeons this was how our beloved crilft was born. Those who have walked this path to this point will now know that they are leaving behind the limits of the mind al1li the ancient restrictions of the universal mapping of the Nightside. The third and final gate to the realm of Hecate's throne is now shattered. This gateway, now open, is that which leads into the darkness beyond the Throne itself. Beyond physical death for those who choose to follow this work is the further exploration of both soul and self. Here lies the Great and Endless Void. Those who have sought and successfully won their crown at the Throne of the Dark Energy Queen may be the next avatars of the Goddess, exploring all that lies beyond; returning with the knowledge and power to further ildvance this ancient, powerful arte. The void is eternal. It is eternity! Like the life incarnate, it must be explored, it must be lived. This is the first step into Godhood, the very first key to divinity where there is no concept of time with which to erode the beautiful soul. Those who are chosen by the Goddess to explore this Darkness beyond their human life are the watchers of tomorrow. Their fate is that of Lucifer, entering the void with the torchlight of magickal gnosis, to illuminate this Darkness for those who would, in love and honour, follow them and walk the Eternal Path of Hecate, Goddess of Heaven and Earth, Queen of Hell. 234"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Path afHecate The Fllllllillg Blood or TmllSrOrillotioll; VV7/icll/lO«(lS(Wlll tilL' Veills or FfeCilte; As T«(lO V\\'itcll Gods Exalted ill lillitl/; Fllr II.bm'e the 11ori::,oll or tI/C Settillg SUII; Is poured illto till' Gmil o(Lucircr; Canlcd/i~OIlI tlf(' Elllcmld (u/licll fell fi\"Olll His Bro«(l; Tills VVitchfire tllilt/lOt(ls/i'Olll tlf(' Dark QUCCII; IllnJllgl1 tllC Veills or tile Se('cII H('(7dcd God; Tlli~ I 11Il\"i.'e Dmllk, Drollk ulltil I cOl/td Drink No More; Tile Poisoll passillg tile lips of tile Mortlll it Kills; Tllc Firc A«(lokelling tllc God Witllill; Thcse Flallles Sustaillillg 1111/ Soul; As the Pyre or tilC P/locllix Bllms all tllllt OIlCC Wos; Risell fro II I tile Fill/lies, tllC GoldclI PatllIIIIE1C /lotUII; Tlll\"Ougll thc Siluer Stllrgate; BClfOlld Stellar gliosis to illulllillatc tile Darkllcss beyolld Her Tlmllle; As Lucifer illto tile Void 1 s/mll go; Tllis is tlic Patli or tltc Cltildn.'11 or Hecate; Crowllcd alld LOt'c{i by their Dark Witcll QuecII; Farfrolll tlte CiutcllCS orDcstilly's Hlllld. 235"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Hail to the Lady ofW;tcl'f!l7iJ1e; Hail to the Goddess of He/!; Hail to the Solar God Lucifer, Master of tIlL' Dark of tl,c SUIl; Bless; Ilgs to the Queel1 (:f ShadoLi's, Hem te; All Hail a/ld great hOllollr to the Witcll Gods this Nigllt.
