[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"CEREMONIAL MAGIC UNVEILED By Dion Fortune This article first appeared in the Occult Gazette in January I933 and has not been available fora wider audience since. It is of particular relevance in revealing D.F's considered opinion aboutThe Golden Dawn as well as Aleister Crowley. If I read the signs of the times aright, the veil ofthe Temple of the Mysteries is being drawn backat the present moment. There are phases in thespiritual life of mankind just as there are weathercycles extending over periods of years, and thetide which began to move during the first decadeof the twentieth century is gathering head as itproceeds. The signs of the times are to be seenin the publication of certain books on magic inwhich the genuine secrets are given, and givenin a form available for any reader with a capacityfor metaphysical thoughts. Among the mostimportant of these are Israel Regardie's twobooks: The Garden of Pomegranates and TheTree of Life. The Garden of Pomegranates, oddly enough,deals with the Tree of Life, the famous glyph ofthe Cabbalists, which is used as a card\u0001indexsystem in which are filed all ideas concerningman and the Universe according to certainwell\u0001understood systems of association, andwhich by means of the pattern of itsarrangement, is used to discover thecorrespondences and relationships betweenthem. The Cabbala is increasingly being recognised as the basis of Western Occultism. Anyone whowants to appreciate esoteric philosophy as taught in that system, and more especially anyonewho wants to make practical use of it, whether in magic or meditation, needs a workingknowledge of the Tree of Life. Information on this decidedly recondite subject has hitherto beento seek in a number of books, some of them rare and hard to come by, and many of themconfused and elusive in their wording. Mr. Regardie has given, in a lucid and concise form, andMessrs. Rider have issued at a moderate price, a most admirable handbook on the technicalsystem of the Tree. It is lucid, comprehensive and concise, and performs a very useful servicein correlating the Cabbalistic, Eastern, and Egyptian systems. It is thus possible for the studentto trace out the interrelation between the two systems which are worked together in the West,the Egyptian and Cabbalistic; and for the Theosophist to recognise the classification with whichhe is familiar, when it is applied to the glyph of the Tree in the technical methods of Westernoccultism. Mr. Regardie has the inestimable advantage of knowing the Hebrew language; in this, as anoccultist, he is unique; for although most occultists working the Western tradition have enoughHebrew to transliterate the Words of Power for inscription on pentacles and talismans or fornumerological work, they number no Hebrew scholars among their ranks, but are all dependenton translations; even MacGregor Mathers and Wynn Westcott did not translate from theA Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"original Hebrew but from Latin versions, and they have saddled the Western schools with sometiresome errors of transliteration and pronunciation. Mr. Regardie gives a classification of the Tree and the constitution of man according to theCabbalists, and of the correspondences between them, which is much more lucid andilluminating even than that given in McGregor Mathers' admirable introductory essay to TheQabalah Unveiled, for he gives the correspondences in terms of modern psychology as wellas of metaphysics and the psychic states. The sections of the book, however, which will be of chief interest to students of the occult, andwhich will cause bitter heartburnings in certain quarters, are his chapters on the attributions andcorrespondences of the Ten Holy Sephiroth and the Twenty-two Paths between them. Theseattributions have been among the special preserves of certain occult schools; but Mr. Regardiegives them, even to the jealously guarded secret of the correct attribution of the Tarot trumps.There will certainly be heartburnings! Mr. Regardie does not specifically state his authorities, but it is unquestionably the systemtaught in the \"Order of the Golden Dawn\", founded by the late S. L. McGregor Mathers, thathe is using. If I have been a Rehoboam who has scourged occult secrecy with whips, Mr.Regardie is a Jeroboam who is using scorpions! However, he has my unqualified blessing, for what it is worth to him. There is no legitimatereason that I have ever been able to see for keeping these things secret. If they have any valueas an aid to spiritual development, and I for one believe that they have the highest value, therecan be no justification for withholding them from the world. The only reason of which I amaware, and one which I suspect of being a weighty one with thosewho have so long sat resolutely upon the lid of occult secrecy, is thatfor purposes of priestcraft and prestige a secret system is a usefulweapon. A weighty reason, this, human nature being what it is, butnot a justification in the eyes of those who have the welfare ofhumanity at heart. It has always been the custom of the \"Golden Dawn\" to wrap itself inthe utmost secrecy. To a certain extent this secrecy is unquestionablynecessary, for many eminent people have at different times belongedto the Order, and they would not have dared to have done so if theycould not have been sure of preserving the secret of their interest in matters occult.Consequently the strict secrecy concerning the names of members and the places of meetingwas and always will be essential. Secrecy is also necessary concerning initiation rites if they are to be psychologically effective;for they should have an element of surprise for the candidate; and the possession of theirsecrets, from which the rest of the world is excluded, builds up a group mind out of the pooledmentalities of the initiated brethren according to certain well-understood psychological laws. Secrecy concerning practical formulae of ceremonial magic is also advisable, for if they areused indiscriminately, the virtue goes out of them. All these formulae have unwritten astralworkings attached to them; if they are used in ignorance by the uninitiated, and without theastral workings, the magnetism which has been worked up in the symbols is given off and notreplaced; but when they are used by the trained occultist, who performs the astral workingswith power, more magnetism is worked up than is given off, and the symbols become stronger.That is why the old formulae, which have been used by generations of trained adepts, are soextraordinarily powerful. Beyond this I do not think occult secrecy ought to go, and I am certainly not prepared to assist"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"it. It is not possible to keep back the tide. Save for the reservations regarding the actual rituals,the day of occult secrecy is over. Whosoever profit by the teachings ought to have them. Mr. Regardie handles, very wisely, the section of his book dealing with the ceremonial rites, forhe gives the principles without the actual formulae. The only formula he gives in full is that ofthe Banishing Ritual of the Lesser Pentagram. I was at first inclined to quarrel with him forgiving this, for one feels instinctively that a formula which is messed about by all and sundry willnot long retain its value for anybody. But on second thoughts I am inclined to acquit him. It isthis formula which is given to the student immediately on initiation, long before he is taught anypractical working, in order that he may be in a position to protect himself in case of astraltrouble. If Mr. Regardie is justified in drawing back the veil at all, then he is, undoubtedly,justified in providing the necessary protection against anything untoward that may comethrough that veil. The Lesser Pentagram is of the nature of a fire extinguisher, and it is verynecessary to have some such device handy, when one adventures into such highly chargedlevels of the Unseen as are contacted by the methods he describes. Now what is going to be the outcome of this general disclosureof the secrets of the Mysteries? As in most drastic happenings, the results will be mixed; but itis my belief that the good will far outweigh the evil. That somefolk will burn their fingers experimenting with that which theydo not understand I have no doubt, but on the whole the gainto serious students will be inestimable. Mr. Regardie has donehis work admirably, both in the spirit and in the letter. The Treeof Life is a book which it would be difficult to praise too highly;it is going to be one of the classics of occultism. When the secrets of the Mysteries are given forth in this manner and with this spirit, I, for one,decline to believe that they are either betrayed or profaned, but rather that the author is dulyaccredited to speak on behalf of Those who can bind or loose, irrespective of tradition or, oathsof secrecy. It is a curious fact that this is the third book of its kind to become available at thepresent moment. I see from an article in the November number of this magazine that Foyle'sare issuing Crowley's Magick in a cheap edition, thus rendering it available for the generalstudent, who has probably never heard of, or could not afford to purchase, the privately printededition which appeared in Paris a couple of years ago. The third person of this unholy trinity ofrevealers of the Mysteries is my humble self, who has been doing much the same thing as Mr.Regardie in a series of articles on the Cabbala which has been running in my own magazine,The Inner Light. I know that I undertook this work under a strong inner compulsion that this teaching must nowbe given out to the world; that it was the will of Those who held the keys that the door shouldbe set open in these matters, and that we were about to enter on an entirely new phase ofoccult activity. So far as I can see, ceremonial magic is coming out into the open, as witnesseven the futile operations of Mr. Harry Price on the Brocken, concerning which I had somethingto say in a previous issue of the Occult Review. One does not see sporadic manifestations ofthe same thing springing up here and there in entire independence; they come from a commonsource. This source I believe to be one of those high spring tides in things spiritual which, fromtime to time, visit our earth. For any organisation to try and close the sluice\u0001gates against it byoaths of secrecy, is to keep back the Atlantic with a broom. It is, therefore, important for those who have knowledge of the subject to recognise the changewhich has taken place in the occult field, lest that field be abandoned to the operations ofquacks. Now that so much has been said by both Regardie and Crowley, it is necessary to saya little more, and so elucidate the whole situation. It must be obvious to anyone who comparesA Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"them that The Garden of Pomegranates and Tree of Life, by Regardie; Magick, by Crowley;and The Mystical Qabalah, by myself, are all dealing with the same system, and the questionnaturally arises, who has cribbed from which? The answer to this is very simple; the systemdealt with is not the private property of any one of us, but is that which I have frequentlyreferred to in my writings as the Western Esoteric Tradition. I have always been guarded in myreferences to this matter, because I took some pretty stringent initiation oaths, and I do notcare for the responsibility of breaking those oaths; but, as previously noted, I have neverpretended ignorance of, or misled any one concerning matters that others had taken theresponsibility of making public. I have never had a taste for priestcraft, whatever other sins aschela or guru may justly be ascribed to me. Mr. Regardie's revelation frees my handsconsiderably further, for it does not appear to me that there is very much he has left unsaid. Iexpect that the pontiffs of the mysteries will tell their neophytes that his books are inaccurateand incomplete; but I think they will find, after they have served ten years for Leah and anotherten for Rachel, as I was made to do, that they are neither inaccurate nor incomplete, and a verygreat deal better put together than the official knowledge papers and side lectures. Now concerning the nature of these mysterious mysteries; as I have already explained, I amwrapped up in oaths of secrecy like a cat in a fly\u0001paper, but I do not feel that this debars mefrom quoting the published works of other writers. When Mrs. McGregor Mathers, in herintroduction to the second edition of her husband's translation of The Qabalah Denudatarefers, in explicit terms, to the mystery school he founded, and intimates that admission may beobtained thereto by applying to her, care of her publishers, and when she publishes a pamphletfor propaganda purposes in the United States which is even more explicit, who am I that Ishould plead ignorance of the existence of such an Order? And when W B. Yeats says, in hisautobiography, that the Order founded by Mr. Mathers was called the “Golden Dawn”, am I topretend that I do not know what the mysterious initials G. D. stand for? Am I also to pretend, inview of what he has to say of his experiences while he was a member, and of the confirmatoryremarks of George Moore in his autobiographical book, Ave atque Vale, that I do not know thatthe “Golden Dawn” concerns itself with ceremonial magic? Does my initiation oath require meto deny these matters or to profess my ignorance of them? If so, it requires me to tell lies. The \"Golden Dawn\" is alleged to owe its origin to thediscovery by Mathers of a set of mysterious ciphermanuscripts; these manuscripts exist, for I have talked withtrustworthy persons who have seen them; but as they werein cipher, they were not able to bear testimony concerningtheir contents. In these manuscripts Mathers is supposedto have found the outline of the \"Golden Dawn\" rituals andthe system of correspondences which is the key to itsteaching, including the correct attribution of the Tarottrumps on the Tree of Life, which enables them to be linkedLip with the astrological signs, a secret that students haveIong sought to discover. It is this system which Crowleyuses in his Equinox, 777, Book Four, and his recentlypublished Magick; which Regardie uses in both his books,and which I am using in my Mystical Qabalah, nowappearing serially in my own magazine. We have none ofus cribbed from each other, but have all drawn upon theMathers' manuscripts. I personally drew direct, because I possess thesemanuscripts; but I did not take the responsibility ofpublishing them, or any of their contents, but worked fromCrowley's 777, as I acknowledged in my articles, using my"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 of 825/01/2005 17:49knowledge of the Mathers manuscript for counter\u0001checkingpurposes. I may say that I found Crowley's books to beaccurate. He himself does not acknowledge his sources inhis recently published Magick, but in his Equinox, now out ofprint, he expressly declares that he is making public the \"Golden Damn\" system ascommanded by the Secret Chiefs. Regardie himself acknowledges his indebtedness to thepublished works of Mathers, Wynn Westcott and Crowley; but as Mathers and Wynn Westcottnever put any of these correspondences into their published works, and Regardie could nothave been in direct touch with the G. D. or he would have known it was not defunct, I concludehe has drawn his information from Crowley's \"A.A\", which is simply the G. D. system underanother name or so it appears to me to be from what its founder says about it. Thus I think we may claim to have traced out this system of correspondences and itsantecedents: Crowley and I drew direct from Mathers \"Golden Dawn\", and Regardie drew fromCrowley's \"A. A\". The next point we have to solve in unravelling our mystery is the relationship of the differentcharacters in this drama to each other. Crowley and Mathers quarrelled. Exactly why, I do notknow; incompatibility of temperament was probably the fundamental cause, whatever theactual occasion of their break may have been. Crowley then started the publication of hismagazine, The Equinox, which came out twice yearly for five years in England and made afresh start in America after the War with one volume, but never got any further. These elevenvolumes are highly prized by the more advanced students of occultism, and the complete set ishard to come by and commands high prices. Some of the contents, however, have beenreprinted in Magick, together with a certain amount of new material. In this magazine Crowley deliberately gave away all that he possessed of Mathers' secrets,including some of his rituals, and tore Mathers' character to shreds. I have never met either ofthe persons concerned in this dispute, but it appears to me that the abuse Crowley heaps onMathers in the pages of his magazine is far more likely to reflect on himself than it is uponMathers. In his criticisms of the manner in which Mathers conducted his organisation he is, Ithink, upon surer ground, for I found exactly the same problems confronting me when I myselfjoined it some years after he left. Practical teaching from official sources was conspicuous byits absence, and unless one was lucky enough to have a personal friend among its memberswith a gift of exposition, one was left high and dry. One was put through the ceremonies, giventhe bare bones of the system in the knowledge lectures and a few commentaries on themcalled side lectures, for the most part of very inferior quality, and left to one's own devices. Theglory had departed in the days when I knew the Order, for most of its original members weredead or withdrawn; it had suffered severely during the war, and was manned mainly by widowsand grey\u0001bearded ancients; and the widows of its founders were somewhat in the position ofthe widow of a certain famous artist when she was asked if meant to carry on her husband'sbusiness. The cloak of Elijah did not necessarily descend on Mrs. Elishah. Nevertheless,anyone with any psychic perceptions at all could not fail to realise that there was power in theceremonies and formulae; and anyone who made a study of them also speedily found out thatin the system of correspondences taught in the G. D. they had got something of inestimablevalue.

D. inextricable confusion, for Mathers seemed to have a peculiar gift for putting his teaching in themost inassimilable form possible (perhaps due to too much reading of Rabbinical literature),were sorted out and assembled in readily available form by Crowley and published in his book777. This book is now out of print, but the more important of its contents are reprinted in thefourth volume of Magick. It is this book which I made use of for my Mystical Qabalah and Iimagine that Regardie also used it for his Garden of Pomegranates. He has drawn very extensively upon Crowley's writings for his inspiration and information, andso much controversy has centred around the personality of that extraordinary man, that it isonly fair to Mr. Regardie to quote a passage in which he explains his attitude in the matter. He says, on page 40, of The Tree of Life: “It will be noted that I have quoted freely fromAleister Crowley, and it is imperative clearly to define my attitude towards this man of genius....It is a pity, as I see it, that the public should be robbed of that superlative freshness andoriginality which are his, and deprived of those aspects of his teaching which are fine,ennobling and enduring, simply because of a certain proportion of his literary output which iscertainly banal, petty, unimportant, and, no doubt, very reprehensible. The personalities andprivate lives of these individuals concern me not at all, and I do not feel disposed to discussthem.\" This, in my opinion, is the right attitude to adopt in the matter. I do not think any educatedperson will dispute the statement that a man's literary work should be judged impartially asliterature, and that his character should not weigh in the balance, either for or against. Ovid andByron both had to leave their country for their country's good, but that does not prevent theirwritings being reckoned as great literature. In a hundred years' time, when the controversiesconcerning his personality have died down, Crowley will be recognised, quite apart from hisoccult work, as a great English writer of both prose and poetry. The man whose work findsinclusion in The Oxford Book of Mystical Verse can meet the jeers of even such an eminentcritic as G. K. Chesterton on a level. Although Crowley's writings are marred by the grossestribaldry and the foulest personal abuse, they are the works of a man of genius and a writer ofmagnificent English, and it is a great loss to occult literature that they are not available for the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"general reader. There could be no more valuable contribution to the occult movement than acollected edition of the works of this very great writer, edited and annotated by some suchsympathetic hand as that of Mr. Regardie, and with the personalities cut out, To speak any word in mitigation of the general condemnation of Crowley is a thankless task, forpanic\u0001stricken people immediately conclude that one is in league with the devil. NeverthelessMr. Regardie has had the courage to do this, and I should like to add my voice to his. To makeuse of a man's work without acknowledgment is no better than picking pockets. As the \"Golden Dawn\" “The A.A.\" and my own \"Inner Light\" must appear to the uninformedobserver to be more or less mixed up together, I feel it is advisable to disentangle them. Thedeeper issues of occultism are evidently going to come out into the open in the near future;therefore a clearing of the ground is imperative. It may be as well to explain my own position in relation to the \"Golden Dawn`. I joined thesouthern branch of the Scottish section of it, since disbanded, in 1919, and transferred fromthere to the section of it of which Mrs. McGregor Mathers was the head, and which claimed theonly orthodoxy. She nearly turned me out for writing The Esoteric Philosophy of Love andMarriage, on the grounds that I was betraying the inner teaching of the Order, but it waspointed out to her that I had not then got the degree in which that teaching was given, and Iwas pardoned. She suspended me for some months for writing Sane Occultism, and finallyturned me out because certain symbols had not appeared in my aura a perfectly unanswerablecharge. However, I transferred again to yet another section of the Order, where, for the firsttime, I saw justice done to what is, in my opinion, a very great system, and continued mystudies without interruption. The Fraternity of the Inner Light\" was founded by me in agreement with Mrs. Mathers, to be anOuter Court to the \"Golden Dawn\" system. All went well at first, and I was in high favour; butpresently I fell from grace; why I never knew. No specific charges were ever made against me,save that of not having the proper symbols in my aura. Finally I was turned out without reasonassigned, save the ridiculous one above. My experiences, when I persisted in using the Ordersystem, I have related in Psychic Self-Defence. Unpleasant as those experiences were, thefact remains that Mrs. Mathers' rejection of me did not close the gates of the Order to me oneither the outer or the inner planes. I personally believe that the Temples of the Mysteries are not houses made with hands, but areeternal in the heavens. I no more believe McGregor Mathers' story of meeting mysteriousadepts in the Bois de Boulogne than I believe Leadbeater's stories of the Masters and theirmarble seats. There is not only folly, but fraud in confusing the planes, and representing thatwhich was experienced subjectively as having actually happened in the world of matter. I have given my life to occultism since I was a young girl, and everything I have seen andexperienced, on both the inner and the outer planes, points away from any centralised humanorganisation. I have seen the most extravagant claims made on behalf of some such GreatWhite Lodge or Temple of the Illuminati, especially by certain American enterprises, for I refuseto call them occult orders; but I have never seen them substantiated. In fact, those who areloudest in their claims give out teaching which would disgrace a patent medicine circular. Bytheir fruits ye shall know them and the fruits of these self\u0001styled adepti are bilious concoctions. The eternal temple in the heavens, however, is another matter and innumerable witnesses, ofevery age and faith, have borne witness to its existence; but they all declare that it is reached invision, and not by any journey into the wilderness, however remote. It is to this eternal temple,and the Masters who rule therein, that I personally look for my inspiration and my authority toinitiate. Whatever system I use is a means to an end and nothing more. I value tradition,however, because I find it to possess a psychic efficacy which is lacking in original systems,A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"however theoretically correct or aesthetically beautiful they may be. It is my belief that Mathers got the keys to his system from the mysterious manuscripts, and thatthese connect up with the genuine European tradition whose symbol is the Roseon the Cross, and concerning which so little is known. I cannot prove this statement on thephysical plane, because I have never been allowed a sight of those manuscripts or anyopportunity to test the statements that are current in the Order concerning its origin; but fromthe psychic experiences I have had in connection with the \"Golden Dawn\" I have formed theabove opinion, for what my opinion may be worth, and I may say that I have had a fairly widerange of experience in practical occultism. It seems to me that whoever can work the system of the \"Golden Dawn` in such a manner as topick up the contacts of the Secret Chiefs need not pay very much attention to the \"Trespasserswill be prosecute” boards put up on the physical plane by persons who are not altogetherdisinterested. The system, when worked by competent persons, is effectual, whether they arechartered or not. But even the \"Golden Dawn\" system, when worked by incompetent persons, isineffectual, as I know to my cost. It is not advisable however, for persons with no experience of practical occultism to make theirfirst experiments with no other guidance than that of a book. Preliminary training is necessary;also a guide with a rope in case of difficulties. But those who have already passed through theOuter Court and stand waiting at the Door Between the Pylons will find, in Mr. Regardie'sbooks, the keys they need. I, for one, wish them Godspeed on their Journey; and may they findthe Stone of the wise; the Summum Bonum; true wisdom; perfect happiness."}]
