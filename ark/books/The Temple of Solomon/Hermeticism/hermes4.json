[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Fourth Book\"The Key\"1. Yesterday's Speech, O Asclepius, I dedicated to thee, this day's it isfit to dedicate to Tat, because it is an Epitome of those generalspeeches that were spoken to him.2. God therefore, and the Father, and the Good, O Tat, have the sameNature, or rather also the same Act and Operation.3. For there is one name or appellation of Nature and Increase whichconcerneth things changeable, and another about thingsunchangeable, and about things unmoveable, that is to say, ThingsDivine and Human; every one of which, himself will have so to be; butaction or operation is of another thing, or elsewhere, as we havetaught in other things, Divine and Human, which must here also beunderstood.4. For his Operation or Act, is his Will, and his Essence, to Will allThings to be.5. For what is God, and the Father, and the Good, but the Being of allthings that yet are not, and the existence itself, of those things thatare!6. This is God, this is the Father, this is the Good, whereunto no otherthing is present or approacheth.7. For the World, and the Sun, which is also a Father by Participation,is not for all that equally the cause of Good, and of Life, to livingCreatures: And if this be so, he is altogether constrained by the Will ofthe Good, without which it is not possible, either to be, or to bebegotten or made.8. But the Father is the cause of his Children, who hath a will both tosow and nourish that which is good by the Son."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"9. For Good is always active or busy in making; and this cannot he inany other, but in him that taketh nothing, and yet willeth all things tobe; for I will not say, O Tat, making them; for he that maketh isdefective in much time, in which sometimes he maketh not, as also ofquantity and quality; for sometimes he maketh those things that havequantity and quality and sometimes the contrary.10. But God is the Father, and the Good, in being all things; for heboth will be this, and is it, and yet all this for himself (as is true) inhim that can see it.11. For all things else are for this, it is the property of Good to beknown: This is the Good, O Tat.12. Tat: Thou hast filled us, O Father, with a sight both good and fair,and the eye of my mind is almost become more holy by the sight orspectacle.13. Trismegistus: I Wonder not at It, for the Sight of Good is not likethe Beam of the Sun, which being of a fiery shining brightness,maketh the eye blind by his excessive Light, that gazeth upon it;rather the contrary, for it enlighteneth, and so much increaseth thelight of the eye, as any man is able to receive the influence of thisIntelligible clearness.14. For it is more swift and sharp to pierce, and innocent or harmlesswithal, and full of immortality, and they that are capable and candraw any store of this spectacle, and sight do many times fall asleepfrom the Body, into this most fair and beauteous Vision; which thingCelius and Saturn our Progenitors obtained unto.15. Tat: I would we also, O Father, could do so.16. Trismegistus: I would have could, O Son; but for the present weare less intent to the Vision, and cannot yet open the eyes of ourminds to behold the incorruptible, and incomprehensible Beauty ofthat Good: But then shall we see it, when we have nothing at all to sayof it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"17. For the knowledge of it, is a Divine Silence, and the rest of all theSenses; For neither can he that understands that understandanything else, nor he that sees that, see any thing else, nor hear anyother thing, nor in sum, move the Body.18. For shining steadfastly upon, and round about the whole Mind itenlighteneth all the Soul; and loosing it from the Bodily Senses andMotions, it draweth it from the Body, and changeth it wholly into theEssence of God.19. For it is Possible for the Soul, O Son, to be Deified while yet itLodgeth in the Body of Man, if it Contemplate the Beauty of the Good.20. Tat: How dost thou mean deifying, Father!21. Trismegistus: There are differences, O Son, of every Soul.22. Tat: But how dost thou again divide the changes?23. Trismegistus: Hast thou not heard in the general Speeches, thatfrom one Soul of the Universe, are all those Souls, which in all theworld are tossed up and down, as it were, and severally divided? Ofthese Souls there are many changes, some into a more fortunateestate, and some quite contrary; for they which are of creeping things,are changed into those of watery things and those of things living inthe water, to those of things living upon the Land; and Airy ones arechanged into men, and human Souls, that lay hold of immortality, arechanged into Demons.24. And so they go on into the Sphere or Region of the fixed Gods, forthere are two choirs or companies of Gods, one of them that wander,and another of them that are fixed. And this is the most perfect gloryof the Soul.25. But the Soul entering into the Body of a Man, if it continue evil,shall neither taste of immortality, nor is partaker of the good.26. But being drawn back the same way, it returneth into creepingthings. And this is the condemnation of an evil Soul."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"27. And the wickedness of a Soul is ignorance; for the Soul that knowsnothing of the things that are, neither the Nature of them, nor thatwhich is good, but is blinded, rusheth and dasheth against the bodilyPassions, and unhappy as it is, not knowing itself, it serveth strangeBodies, and evil ones, carrying the Body as a burthen, and not ruling,but ruled. And this is the mischief of the Soul.28. On the contrary, the virtue of the Soul is Knowledge; for he thatknows is both good and religious, and already Divine.29. Tat: But who is such a one, O Father!30. Trismegistus: He that neither speaks, nor hears many things; forhe, O Son, that heareth two speeches or hearings, fighteth in theshadow.31. For God, and the Father, and Good, is neither spoken nor heard.32. This being so in all things that are, are the Senses, because theycannot be without them.33. But Knowledge differs much from Sense; for Sense is of thingsthat surmount it, but Knowledge is the end of Sense.34. Knowledge is the gift of God; for all Knowledge is unbodily butuseth the Mind as an Instrument, as the Mind useth the Body.35. Therefore both intelligible and material things go both of theminto bodies; for, of contraposition, That is Setting One againstAnother, and Contrariety, all Things must Consist. And it isimpossible it should be otherwise,36. Tat: Who therefore is this material God?37. Trismegistus: The fair and beautiful world, and yet it is not good;for it is material and easily passible, nay, it is the first of all passiblethings; and the second of the things that are, and needy or wantingsomewhat else. And it was once made and is always, and is ever ingeneration, and made, and continually makes, or generates thingsthat have quantity and quality."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"38. For it is moveable, and every material motion is generation; butthe intellectual stability moves the material motion after this manner.39. Because the World Is a Sphere, that is a Head, and above the headthere is nothing material, as beneath the feet there is nothingintellectual.40. The whole universe is material; The Mind is the head, and it ismoved spherically, that is like a head.41. Whatsoever therefore is joined or united to the Membrane or Filmof this head, wherein the Soul is, is immortal, and as in the Soul of amade Body, hath its Soul full of the Body; but those that are furtherfrom that Membrane, have the Body full of Soul.42. The whole is a living wight, and therefore consisteth of materialand intellectual.43. And the World is the first, and Man the second living wight afterthe World; but the first of things that are mortal and therefore hathwhatsoever benefit of the Soul all the others have: And yet for all this,he is not only not good, but flatly evil, as being mortal.44. For the World is not good as it is moveable; nor evil as it isimmortal.45. But man is evil, both as he is moveable, and as he is mortal.46. But the Soul of Man is carried in this manner, The Mind is inReason, Reason in the Soul, the Soul in the Spirit, the Spirit in theBody.47. The Spirit being diffused and going through the veins, andarteries, and blood, both moveth the living Creature, and after acertain manner beareth it.48. Wherefore some also have thought the Soul to be blood, beingdeceived in Nature, not knowing that first the Spirit must return intothe Soul, and then the blood is congealed, the veins and arteries"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"emptied, and then the living thing dieth: And this is the death of theBody.49. All things depend of one beginning, and the beginning depends ofthat which is one and alone.50. And the beginning is moved, that it may again be a beginning; butthat which is one, standeth and abideth, and is not moved,51. There are therefore these three, God the Father, and the Good, theWorld and Man: God hath the World, and the World hath Man; andthe World is the Son of God, and Man as it were the Offspring of theWorld.52. For God is not ignorant of Man, but knows him perfectly, and willbe known by him. This only is healthful to man; the Knowledge ofGod: this is the return of Olympus; by this only the Soul is madegood, and not sometimes good, and sometimes evil, but of necessityGood.53. Tat: What meanest thou, O Father.54. Trismegistus: Consider, O Son, the Soul of a Child, when as yet ithath received no dissolution of its Body, which is not yet grown, but isvery small; how then if it look upon itself, it sees itself beautiful, asnot having been yet spotted with the Passions of the Body, but as itwere depending yet upon the Soul of the World.55. But when the Body is grown and distracteth, the Soul it engendersForgetfulness, and partakes no more of the Fair and the Good, andForgetfulness is Evilness.56. The like also happeneth to them that go out of the Body: for whenthe Soul runs back into itself the Spirit is contracted into the bloodand the Soul into the Spirit; but the Mind being made pure, and freefrom these clothings; and being Divine by Nature, taking a fiery Bodyrangeth abroad in every place, leaving the Soul to judgment, and tothe punishment it hath deserved."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"57. Tat: Why dost thou say so, O Father, that the Mind is separatedfrom the Soul, and the Soul from the Spirit? When even now thousaidst the Soul was the Clothing or Apparel of the Mind, and the Bodyof the Soul.58. Trismegistus: O Son, he that hears must co-understand andconspire in thought with him that speaks; yea, he must have hishearing swifter and sharper than the voice of the speaker.59. The disposition of these Clothings or Covers, is done in an EarthlyBody; for it is impossible, that the mind should establish or rest itself,naked, and of itself; in an Earthly Body; neither is the Earthly Bodyable to bear such immortality; and therefore that it might suffer sogreat virtue the Mind compacted as it were, and took to itself thepassible Body of the Soul, as a Covering or Clothing. And the Soulbeing also in some sort Divine, useth the Spirit as her Minister andServant, and the Spirit governeth the living thing.60. When therefore the Mind is separated, and departeth from theearthly Body, presently it puts on its Fiery Coat, which it could not dohaving to dwell in an Earthly Body.61. For the Earth cannot suffer fire, for it is all burned of a smallspark; therefore is the water poured round about the Earth, as a Wallor defence, to withstand the flame of fire.62. But the Mind being the most sharp or swift of all the DivineCogitations, and more swift than all the Elements, hath the fire for itsBody.63. For the Mind which is the Workman of all useth the fire as hisinstrument in his Workmanship; and he that is the Workman of all,useth it to the making of all things, as it is used by man, to the makingof Earthly things only; for the Mind that is upon Earth, void, or nakedof fire, cannot do the business of men. Nor that which is otherwise theaffairs of God.64. But the Soul of Man, and yet not everyone, but that which is piousand religious, is Angelical and Divine. And such a Soul, after it is"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"departed from the Body, having striven the strife of Piety, becomeseither Mind or God.65. And the strife of Piety is to know God, and to injure no Man, andthis way it becomes Mind.66. But an impious Soul abideth in its own essence, punished of itself,and seeking an earthly and human Body to enter into.67. For no other Body is capable of a Human Soul, neither is it lawfulfor a Man's Soul to fall into the Body of an unreasonable living thing:for it is the Law or Decree of God, to preserve a Human Soul from sogreat a contumely and reproach.68. Tat: How then is the Soul of Man punished, O Father; and what isits greatest torment.69. Hermes: Impiety, O my Son; for what Fire hath so great a flame asit? Or what biting Beast doth so tear the Body as it doth the Soul.70. Or dost thou not see how many evils the wicked Soul suffereth,roaring and crying out, I am Burned, I am Consumed, I know notwhat to Say, or Do, I am Devoured, Unhappy Wretch, of the Evils thatcompass and lay-hold upon me; Miserable that I am, I neither See norHear anything.71. These are the voices of a punished and tormented Soul, and not asmany; and thou, O Son, thinkest that the Soul going out of the Bodygrows brutish or enters into a Beast: Which is a very great Error, forthe Soul punished after this manner.72. For the Mind, when it is ordered or appointed to get a fiery Bodyfor the services of God, coming down into the wicked Soul, tormentsit with the whips of Sins, wherewith the wicked Soul being scourged,turns itself to Murders, and Contumelies, and Blasphemies, anddivers Violences, and other things by which men are injured73. But into a pious Soul, the Mind entering, leads it into the Light ofKnowledge."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"74. And such a Soul is never satisfied with singing praise to God, andspeaking well of all men; and both in words and deeds, always doinggood in imitation of her Father.75. Therefore, O Son, we must give thanks, and pray, that we mayobtain a good mind.76. The Soul therefore may be altered or changed into the better, butinto the worse it is impossible.77. But there is a communion of Souls, and those of Gods,communicate with those of men; and those of men, with those ofBeasts.78. And the better always take of the worse, Gods of Men, Men ofbrute Beasts, but God of all: For he is the best of all, and all things areless than he.79. Therefore is the World subject unto God, Man unto the World andunreasonable things to Man.80. But God is above all, and about all; and the beams of God areoperations; and the beams of the World are Natures; and the beamsof Man are Arts and Sciences.81. And Operations do act by the World, and upon man by the naturalbeams of the World, but Natures work by the Elements, and man byArts and Sciences.82. And this is the Government of the whole, depending upon theNature of the One, and piercing or coming down by the One Mind,than which nothing is more Divine, and more efficacious or operative;and nothing more uniting, or nothing is more One. The Communionof Gods to Men, and of Men to God.83. This is the Bonus Genius, or good Demon, blessed Soul that isfullest of it! And unhappy Soul that is empty of it!84. Tat: And wherefore Father?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"85. Trismegistus: Know Son, that every Soul hath the Good Mind; forof that it is we now speak, and not of that Minister of which we saidbefore, That he was sent from the Judgment.86. For the Soul without the Mind, can neither do, nor say any thing;for many times the Mind flies away from the Soul, and in that hourthe Soul neither seeth nor heareth, but is like an unreasonable thing;so great is the power of the Mind.87. But neither brooketh it an idle or lazy Soul, but leaves such a onefastened to the Body, and by it pressed down.88. And such a Soul, O Son, hath no mind, wherefore neither mustsuch a one be called a Man.89. For man is a Divine living thing and is not to be compared to anybrute Beast that lives upon Earth, but to them that are above inHeaven, that are called Gods.90. Rather, if we shall be bold to speak the truth, he that is a manindeed, is above them, or at least they are equal in power, one to theother, For none of the things in Heaven will come down upon Earth,and leave the limits of Heaven, but a man ascends up into Heaven,and measures it.91. And he knoweth what things are on high, and what below, andlearneth all other things exactly.92. And that which is the greatest of all, he leaveth not the Earth, andyet is above: So great is the greatness of his Nature.93. Wherefore we must be bold to say, That an Earthly Man is aMortal God, and That the Heavenly God is an Immortal Man.94. Wherefore, by these two are all things governed, the World andMan; but they and all things else, of that which is One."}]
