[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Hermes TrismegistusThe First Book1. O my Son, write this first Book, both for Humanity's sake, and forPiety towards God.2. For there can be no Religion more true or just, than to know thethings that are; and to acknowledge thanks for all things, to him thatmade them, which thing I shall not cease continually to do.3. What then should a man do, O Father, to lead his life well, seeingthere is nothing here true?4. Be Pious and Religious, O my Son, for he that doth so, is the bestand highest Philosopher; and without Philosophy, it is impossibleever to attain to the height and exactness of Piety or Religion.5. But he that shall learn and study the things that are, and how theyare ordered and governed, and by whom and for what cause, or towhat end, will acknowledge thanks to the Workman as to a goodFather, an excellent Nurse and a faithful Steward, and he that givesthanks shall be Pious or Religious, and he that is Religious shall knowboth where the truth is, and what it is, and learning that, he will beyet more and more Religious.6. For never, O Son, shall or can that Soul which while it is in theBody lightens and lifts up itself to know and comprehend that whichis Good and True, slide back to the contrary; for it is infinitelyenamoured thereof. And forgetteth all Evils; and when it hath learnedand known its Father and progenitor it can no more Apostatize ordepart from that Good.7. And let this, O Son, be the end of Religion and Piety; whereuntowhen thou art once arrived, thou shalt both live well, and dieblessedly, whilst thy Soul is not ignorant whether it must return andfly back again."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"8. For this only, O Son, is the way to the Truth, which our Progenitorstravelled in; and by which, making their Journey, they at lengthattained to the Good. It is a Venerable way, and plain, but hard anddifficult for the Soul to go in that is in the Body.9. For first must it war against its own self, and after much Strife andDissention it must be overcome of one part; for the Contention is ofone against two, whilst it flies away and they strive to hold and detainit.10. But the victory of both is not like; for the one hasteth to that whichis Good, but the other is a neighbour to the things that are Evil; andthat which is Good, desireth to be set at Liberty; but the things thatare Evil, love Bondage and Slavery.11. And if the two parts be overcome, they become quiet, and arecontent to accept of it as their Ruler; but if the one be overcome of thetwo, it is by them led and carried to be punished by its being andcontinuance here.12. This is, O Son, the Guide in the way that leads thither for thoumust first forsake the Body before thy end, and get the victory in thisContention and Strifeful life, and then thou hast overcome. Return.13. But now, O my Son, I will by Heads run through the things thatare: Understand thou what I say, and remember what thou hearest.14. All things that are, are moved; only that which is not, isunmovable.15. Every Body is changeable.16. Not every Body is dissolvable.17. Some Bodies are dissolvable.18. Every living thing is not mortal.19. Not every living thing is immortal."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"20. That which may be dissolved is also corruptible.21. That which abides always is unchangeable.22. That which is unchangeable is eternal.23. That which is always made is always corrupted.24. That which is made but once, is never corrupted, neither becomesany other thing.25. First, God; Secondly, the World; Thirdly, Man.26. The World for Man, Man for God.27. Of the Soul, that part which is Sensible is mortal, but that which isReasonable is immortal.28. Every essence is immortal.29. Every essence is unchangeable.30. Every thing that is, is double.31. None of the things that are stand still.32. Not all things are moved by a Soul, but every thing that is, ismoved by a Soul.33. Every thing that suffers is Sensible, every thing that is Sensiblesuffereth.34. Every thing that is sad rejoiceth also, and is a mortal livingCreature.35. Not every thing that joyeth is also sad, but is an eternal livingthing.36. Not every Body is sick; every Body that is sick is dissolvable."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"37. The Mind in God.38.

All things in Heaven are unblameable, all things upon Earth aresubject to Reprehension.59. That which is immortal, is not mortal: that which is mortal is notimmortal.60. That which is sown, is not always begotten; but that which isbegotten always, is sown.61. Of a dissolvable Body, there are two Times, one from sowing togeneration, one from generation to death.62. Of an everlasting Body, the time is only from the Generation.63. Dissolvable Bodies are increased and diminished,64. Dissolvable matter is altered into contraries; to wit, Corruptionand Generation, but Eternal matter into its self, and its like.65. The Generation of Man is Corruption, the Corruption of Man isthe beginning of Generation.66. That which off-springs or begetteth another, is itself an offspringor begotten by another.67. Of things that are, some are in Bodies, some in their Ideas.68. Whatsoever things belong to operation or working, are in a Body.69. That which is immortal, partakes not of that which is mortal.70.

Those things that are in Heaven are subjected or placed under it,but the things on Earth, are placed upon it.76. Heaven is the first Element.77. Providence is Divine Order.78.

The immutable or unalterable Good.81. What is Man? An unchangeable Evil.82. If thou perfectly remember these Heads, thou canst not forgetthose things which in more words I have largely expounded untothee; for these are the Contents or Abridgment of them.83. Avoid all Conversation with the multitude or common People, forI would not have thee subject to Envy, much less to be ridiculous untothe many.84. For the like always takes to itself that which is like, but the unlikenever agrees with the unlike: Such Discourses as these have very fewAuditors, and peradventure very few will have, but they havesomething peculiar unto themselves.85. They do rather sharpen and whet evil men to their maliciousness,therefore it behoveth to avoid the multitude and take heed of them asnot understanding the virtue and power of the things that are said."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"86. How dost Thou mean, O Father?87. Thus, O Son, the whole Nature and Composition of those livingthings called Men, is very prone to Maliciousness, and is veryfamiliar, and as it were nourished with it, and therefore is delightedwith it. Now this wight if it shall come to learn or know, that theworld was once made, and all things are done according toProvidence and Necessity, Destiny, or Fate, bearing Rule over all: Willhe not be much worse than himself, despising the whole because itwas made. And if he may lay the cause of evil upon Fate or Destiny, hewill never abstain from any evil work.88. Wherefore we must look warily to such kind of people, that beingin ignorance, they may be less evil for fear of that which is hidden andkept secret."}]
