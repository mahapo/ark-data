For there were in the Chaos, an infinite darkness in the Abyss orbottomless Depth, and Water, and a subtle Spirit intelligible inPower; and there went out the Holy Light, and the Elements werecoagulated from the Sand out of the moist Substance.4. And all the Gods distinguished the Nature full of Seeds.5. And when all things were interminated and unmade up, the lightthings were divided on high. And the heavy things were founded uponthe moist sand, all things being Terminated or Divided by Fire; andbeing sustained or hung up by the Spirit they were so carried, and theHeaven was seen in Seven Circles.6. And the Gods were seen in their Ideas of the Stars, with all theirSigns, and the Stars were numbered, with the Gods in them. And theSphere was all lined with Air, carried about in a circular, motion bythe Spirit of God.7. And every God by his internal power, did that which wascommanded him; and there were made four footed things, andcreeping things, and such as live in the Water, and such as fly, andevery fruitful Seed, and Grass, and the Flowers of all Greens, andwhich had sowed in themselves the Seeds of Regeneration.8.
