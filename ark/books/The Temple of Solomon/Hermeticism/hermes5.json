[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Fifth Book\"That God is not Manifest and yet most Manifest.\"1. This Discourse I will also make to thee, O Tat, that thou mayest notbe ignorant of the more excellent Name of God.2. But do thou contemplate in thy Mind, how that which to manyseems hidden and unmanifest, may be most manifest unto thee.3. For it were not all, if it were apparent, for whatsoever is apparent,is generated or made; for it was made manifest, but that which is notmanifest is ever.4. For it needeth not to be manifested, for it is always.5. And he maketh all other things manifest, being unmanifest as beingalways, and making other things manifest, he is not made manifest.6. Himself is not made, yet in fantasy he fantasieth all things, or inappearance he maketh them appear, for appearance is only of thosethings that are generated or made, for appearance is nothing butgeneration.7. But he is that One, that is not made nor generated, is alsounapparent and unmanifest.8. But making all things appear, he appeareth in all and by all; butespecially he is manifested to or in those things wherein himselflisteth.9. Thou therefore, O Tat, my Son, pray first to the Lord and Father,and to the Alone and to the One from whom is one to be merciful tothee, that thou mayest knowest and understand so great a God; andthat he would shine one of his beams upon thee In thy understanding.10. For only the Understanding sees that which is not manifest orapparent, as being itself not manifest or apparent; and if thou canst,O Tat, it will appear to the eyes of thy Mind."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"11. For the Lord, void of envy, appeareth through the whole world.Thou mayest see the intelligence, and take it in thy hands, andcontemplate the Image of God.12. But if that which is in thee, be not known or apparent unto thee,how shall he in thee be seen, and appear unto thee by the eyes?13. But if thou wilt see him, consider and understand the Sun,consider the course of the Moon, consider the order of the Stars.14. Who is he that keepeth order? For all order is circumscribed orterminated in number and place.15. The Sun is the greatest of the Gods in heaven, to whom all theheavenly Gods give place, as to a King and potentate; and yet he beingsuch a one, greater than the Earth or the Sea, is content to sufferinfinite lesser stars to walk and move above himself; whom doth hefear the while, O Son?16. Every one of these Stars that are in Heaven, do not make the like,or an equal course; who is it that hath prescribed unto every one, themanner and the greatness of their course!17. This Bear that turns round about its own self; and carries roundthe whole World with her, who possessed and made such anInstrument.18. Who hath set the Bounds to the Sea? Who hath established theEarth? For there is some body, O Tat, that is the Maker and Lord ofthese things.19. For it is impossible, O Son, that either place, or number, ormeasure, should be observed without a Maker.20. For no order can be made by disorder or disproportion.21. I would it were possible for thee, O my Son, to have wings, and tofly into the Air, and being taken up in the midst, between Heaven andEarth, to see the stability of the Earth, the fluidness of the Sea, the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"courses of the Rivers, the largeness of the Air, the sharpness orswiftness of the Fire, the motion of the Stars; and the speediness ofthe Heaven, by which it goeth round about all these.22. O Son, what a happy sight it were, at one instant, to see all these,that which is unmovable moved, and that which is hidden appear andbe manifest.23. And if thou wilt see and behold this Workman, even by mortalthings that are upon Earth, and in the deep. Consider, O Son, howMan is made and framed in the Womb; and examine diligently theskill and cunning of the Workman, and learn who it was that wroughtand fashioned the beautiful and Divine shape of Man; whocircumscribed and marked out his eyes? Who bored his nostrils andears? Who opened his mouth? Who stretched out and tied togetherhis sinews! Who channelled the veins? Who hardened and madestrong the bones! Who clothed the flesh with skin? Who divided thefingers and the joints! Who flatted and made broad the soles of thefeet! Who digged the pores! Who stretched out the spleen, whichmade the heart like a Pyramis? Who made the Liver broad! Whomade the Lights spongy, and full of holes! Who made the belly largeand capacious? Who set to outward view the more honourable partsand hid the filthy ones?24. See how many Arts in one Matter, and how many Works in oneSuperscription, and all exceedingly beautiful, and all done inmeasure, and yet all differing.25. Who hath made all these things! What Mother! What Father! Saveonly God that is not manifest! That made all things by his own Will.26. And no man says that a statue or an image is made without aCarver or a Painter, and was this Workmanship made without aWorkman? O great Blindness, O great Impiety, O great Ignorance.27. Never, O Son Tat, canst thou deprive the Workmanship of theWorkman, rather it is the best Name of all the Names of God, to callhim the Father of all, for so he is alone; and this is his Work to be theFather."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"28. And if thou wilt force me to say anything more boldly, it is hisEssence to be pregnant, or great with all things, and to make them.29. And as without a Maker, it is impossible that anything should bemade, so it is that he should not always be, and always be making allthings in Heaven, in the Air, in the Earth, in the Deep, in the wholeWorld, and in every part of the whole that is, or that is not.30. For there is nothing in the whole World, that is not himself boththe things that are and the things that are not.31. For the things that are, he hath made manifest; and the things thatare not, he hath hid in himself.32. This is God that is better than any name; this is he that is secret;this is he that is most manifest; this is he that is to be seen by theMind; this is he that is visible to the eye; this is he that hath no body;and this is he that hath many bodies, rather there is nothing of anybody, which is not He.33. For he alone is all things.34. And for this cause He hath all Names, because He is the OneFather; and therefore He hath no Name, because He is the Father ofall.35. Who therefore can bless thee, or give thanks for thee, or to thee.36. Which way shall I look, when I praise thee? Upward? Downward?Outward? Inward?37. For about thee there is no manner, nor place, nor anything else ofall things that are.38. But all things are in thee; all things from thee, thou givest allthings, and takest nothing; for thou hast all things and there isnothing that thou hast not.39. When shall I praise thee, O Father; for it is neither possible tocomprehend thy hour, nor thy time?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"40. For what shall I praise thee? For what thou hast made, or for whatthou hast not made! For those things thou hast manifested, or forthose things thou hast hidden?41. Wherefore shall I praise thee as being of myself, or havinganything of mine own, or rather being another's?42. For thou art what I am, thou art what I do, thou art what I say. 43. Thou Art All Things, and there is Nothing Else Thou art not.44. Thou Art Thou, All that is Made, and all that is not Made.45. The Mind that Understandeth.46. The Father that Maketh and Frameth.47. The Good that Worketh.48. The Good that doth All Things.49. Of the Matter, the most subtle and slender part is Air, of the Airthe Soul, of the Soul the Mind, of the Mind God."}]
