[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Eighth BookThat the Greatest Evil In Man, Is, the Not Knowing God1. Whither are you carried, O Men, drunken with drinking up thestrong Wine of Ignorance? Which seeing you cannot bear: Why doyou not vomit it up again?2. Stand, and be sober, and look up again with the eyes of your heart;and if you cannot all do so, yet do as many as you can.3. For the malice of Ignorance surroundeth all the Earth, andcorrupteth the Soul, shut up in the Body not suffering it to arrive atthe Havens of Salvation.4. Suffer not yourselves to he carried with the great stream, but stemthe tide, you that can lay hold of the Haven of Safety, and make yourfull course towards it.5. Seek one that may lead you by the hand, and conduct you to thedoor of Truth and Knowledge, where the clear Light is that is purefrom Darkness, where there is not one drunken, but all are sober andin their heart look up to him, whose pleasure it is to be seen.6. For he cannot be heard with ears, nor seen with eyes, nor expressedin words; but only in mind and heart.7. But first thou must tear to pieces and break through the garmentthou wearest; the web of Ignorance, the foundation of all Mischief;the bond of Corruption; the dark Coverture; the living Death; thesensible Carcass, the Sepulchre, carried about with us; the domesticalThief which in what he loves us, hates us, envies us.8. Such is the hurtful Apparel, wherewith thou art clothed, whichdraws and pulls thee downward by its own self; lest looking up, andseeing the beauty of Truth, and the Good that is reposed therein, thoushouldst hate the wickedness of this garment, and understand thetraps and ambushes, which it hath laid for thee."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"9. Therefore doth it labour to make good those things that seem andare by the Senses, judged and determined; and the things that aretruly, it hides, and envelopeth in such matter, filling what it presentsunto thee, with hateful pleasure, that thou canst neither hear whatthou shouldst hear, nor see what thou shouldst see."}]
