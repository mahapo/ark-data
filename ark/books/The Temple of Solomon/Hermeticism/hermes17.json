[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Seventeenth BookTo Asclepius, to be Truly Wise1. Because my Son Tat, in thy absence, would needs learn the Natureof the things that are: He would not suffer me to give over (as comingvery young to the knowledge of every individual) till I was forced todiscourse to him many things at large, that his contemplation mightfrom point to point, be more easy and successful.2. But to thee I have thought good to write in few words, choosing outthe principal heads of the things then spoken, and to interpret themmore mystically, because thou hast, both more years, and moreknowledge of Nature.3. All things that appear, were made, and are made.4. Those things that are made, are not made by themselves, but byanother.5. And there are many things made, but especially all things thatappear, and which are different, and not like.6. If the things that be made and done, be made and done by another,there must be one that must make, and do them; and he unmade, andmore ancient than the things that are made.7. For I affirm the things that are made, to be made by another; and itis impossible, that of the things that are made any should be moreancient than all, but only that which is not made.8. He is stronger, and One, and only knowing all things indeed, as nothaving any thing more ancient than himself.9. For he bears rule, both over multitude, and greatness, and thediversity of the things that are made, and the continuity of theFacture and of the Operation."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"10. Moreover, the things that are made, are visible, but he is invisible;and for this cause, he maketh them, that he may be visible; andtherefore he makes them always.11. Thus it is fit to understand and understanding to admire andadmiring to think thy self happy, that knowest thy natural Father.12. For what is sweeter than a Natural Father?13. Who therefore is this, or how shall we know him?14. Or is it just to ascribe unto him alone, the Title and Appellation ofGod, or of the Maker, or of the Father, or of all Three? That of Godbecause of his Power; the Maker because of his Working andOperation; and the Father, because of his Goodness.15. For Power is different from the things that are made, but Act orOperation, in that all things are made.16. Wherefore, letting go all much and vain talking, we mustunderstand these two things, That Which is Made, and Him Which isthe Maker; for there is nothing in the middle, between these Two, noris there any third.17. Therefore understanding All things, remember these Two; andthink that these are All things, putting nothing into doubt; neither ofthe things above, nor of the things below; neither of thingschangeable, nor things that are in darkness or secret.18. For All things, are but two Things, That which Maketh, and thatwhich is Made, and the One of them cannot depart, or be dividedfrom the Other.19. For neither is it possible that the maker should be without thething made, for either of them is the self-same thing; therefore cannotthe One of them be separated from the other, no more than a thingcan be separated from itself.20. For if he that makes be nothing else, but that which makes alone,Simple, Uncompounded, it is of necessity, that he makes the same"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"thing to himself, to whom it is the Generation of him that maketh tobe also All that is made.21. For that which is generated or made, must necessarily begenerated or made by another, but without the Maker that which ismade, neither is made, nor is; for the one of them without the other,hath lost his proper Nature by the privation of the other.22. So if these Two be confessed, That which maketh, and that whichis made, then they are One in Union, this going before, and thatfollowing.23. And that which goeth before, is, God the Maker, and that whichfollows is, that which is made, be it what it will.24. And let no man be afraid because of the variety of things that aremade or done, lest he should cast an aspersion of baseness, or infamyupon God, for it is the only Glory of him to do, or make All things.25. And this making, or facture is as it were the Body of God, and tohim that maketh or doth, there is nothing evil, or filthy to be imputed,or There is Nothing thought Evil or Filthy.26. For these are Passions that follow Generation as Rust dothCopper, or as Excrements do the Body.27. But neither did the Copper-smith make the Rust, nor the Makerthe Filth, nor God the Evilness.28. But the vicissitude of Generation doth make them, as it were toblossom out; and for this cause did make Change to be, as one shouldsay, The Purgation of Generation.29. Moreover, is it lawful for the same Painter to make both Heaven,and the Gods, and the Earth, and the Sea, and Men, and brute Beasts,and inanimate Things, and Trees; and is it impossible for God tomake these things? O the great madness, and ignorance of men inthings that concern God!"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"30. For men that think so, suffer that which is most ridiculous of all;for professing to bless and praise God yet in not ascribing to him themaking or doing of All things, they know him not.31. And besides their not knowing him, they are extremely impiousagainst him, attributing unto him Passions, as Pride, or Oversight, orWeakness, or Ignorance, or Envy.32. For if he do not make or do all things, he is either proud or notable, or ignorant, or envious, which is impious to affirm.33. For God hath only one Passion, namely Good and he that is goodis neither proud, nor impotent, nor the rest, but God is Good itself.34. For Good is all power, to do or make all things, and every thingthat is made, is made by God, that is by the Good and that can makeor do all things.35. See then how he maketh all things, and how the things are done,that are done, and if thou wilt learn, thou mayest see an Imagethereof, very beautiful, and like.36. Look upon the Husbandman, how he casteth Seeds into the Earth,here Wheat, there Barley, and elsewhere some other Seeds.37. Look upon the same Man, planting a Vine, or an Apple-Tree, or aFig-Tree, or some other Tree.38. So doth God in Heaven sow Immortality, in the Earth Change inthe whole Life, and Motion.39. And these things are not many, but few, and easily numbered forthey are all but four, God and Generation, in which are all things."}]
