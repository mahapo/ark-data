[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Seventh BookHis Secret Sermon of Regeneration, and the Profession of Silence, toHis Son TatI. Tat: In the general Speeches, O Father, discoursing of the Divinity,thou speakest enigmatically, and didst not clearly reveal thyself,saying, That no man can be saved before Regeneration.2. And when I did humbly entreat thee, at the going up the Mountainafter thou hadst discoursed unto me, having a great desire, to learnthis Argument of Regeneration; because among all the rest, I amignorant only of this thou toldst me thou wouldst impart it unto me,when I would estrange myself from the World: whereupon I mademyself ready, and have vindicated the understanding that is in me,from the deceit of the World.3. Now then fulfill my defects, and as thou saidst instruct me ofRegeneration, either by word of mouth or secretly; for I know not, OTrismegistus, of what Substance, or what Womb or what Seed a Manis thus born.4. Hermes: O Son, this Wisdom is to be understood in silence, and theSeed is the true Good.5. Tat: Who soweth it, O Father. For I am utterly ignorant anddoubtful.6. Hermes: The Will of God, O Son.7. And what manner of Man is he that is thus born? For in this point,I am clean deprived of the Essence that understandeth in me.8. Hermes: The Son of God will be another, God made the universe,that in everything consisteth of all powers.9. Tat: Thou tellest me a Riddle, Father, and dost not speak as aFather to his Son."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"10. Hermes: Son, things of this kind are not taught, but are by God,when he pleaseth, brought to remembrance.11. Tat: Thou speakest of things strained, or far fetched, andimpossible, Father; and therefore I will directly contradict them.12. Hermes: Wilt thou prove a stranger, Son, to thy Father's kind.13. Tat: Do not envy me, Father, or pardon me, I am thy Natural Son;discourse unto me the manner of Regeneration.14. Hermes: What shall I say, O my Son? I have nothing to say morethan this, that I see in myself an unfeigned sight or spectacle, made bythe mercy of God, and I am gone out of myself into an immortal body,and am riot now what I was before, but was begotten in Mind.15. This thing is not taught, nor is it to be seen in this formedElement; for which the first compound form was neglected by me;and that I am now separated from it; for I have both the touch andthe measure of it, yet am I now estranged from them.16. Thou seest, O Son, with thine eyes; but though thou look never sosteadfastly upon me, with the Body, and bodily sight, thou canst notsee, nor understand what I am now.17. Tat: Thou hast driven me, O Father, into no small fury anddistraction of mind, for I do not now see my self.18. Hermes: I would, O Son, that thou also wert gone out of thyself,like them that dream in their sleep.19. Tat: Then tell me this, who is the Author and Maker ofRegeneration?20. Hermes: The child of God, one Man by the Will of God.21. Tat: Now, O Father, thou hast put me to silence for ever and all myformer thoughts have quite left and forsaken me, for I see thegreatness, and shape of all things here below, and nothing butfalsehood in them all."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"22. And since this mortal Form is daily changed, and turned by thistime into increase, and diminution, as being falsehood; whattherefore is true, O Trismegistus?23. Trismegistus: That, O Son, which is not troubled, nor bounded;not coloured, not figured, not changed; that which is naked, bright,comprehensible only of itself, unalterable, unbodily.24. Tat: Now I am mad, indeed, Father; for when I thought me tohave been made a wise man by thee, with these thoughts thou hastquite dulled all my senses.25. Hermes: Yet is it so, as I say, O Son, He that Looketh Only uponthat which is carried upward as Fire, that which is carried downwardas Earth, that which is moist as Water, and that which bloweth or issubject to blast as Air; how can he sensibly understand that which isneither hard, nor moist, nor tangible, nor perspicuous, seeing it isonly understood in power and operation; but I beseech and pray tothe Mind which alone can understand the Generation, which is inGod.26. Tat: Then am I, O Father, utterly unable to do it.27. Hermes: God forbid, Son, rather draw or pull him unto thee (orStudy to Know Him) and he will come, be but Willing, and it shall bedone; quiet (or make idle) the Senses of the Body, purging thyselffrom unreasonable brutish torments of matter.28. Tat: Have I any revengers or tormentors in myself, Father?29. Hermes: Yes, and those, not a few, but many and fearful ones.30. Tat: I do not know them, Father.31. Hermes: One Torment, Son, is Ignorance, a second, Sorrow, athird, Intemperance, a fourth Concupiscence, a fifth, Injustice, asixth, Covetousness, a seventh, Deceit, an eighth, Envy, a ninth,Fraud or Guile, a tenth, Wrath, an eleventh, Rashness, a twelfth,Maliciousness."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"32. They are in number twelve, and under these many more; somewhich through the prison of the body, do force the inwardly placedMan to suffer sensibly33. And they do not suddenly, or easily depart from him, that hathobtained mercy of God; and herein consists, both the manner and thereason of Regeneration.34. For the rest, O Son, hold thy peace, and praise God in silence, andby that means, the mercy of God will not cease, or be wanting unto us.35. Therefore rejoice, my Son, from henceforward, being purged bythe powers of God, to the Knowledge of the Truth.36. For the revelation of God is come to us, and when that came allIgnorance was cast out.37. The knowledge of Joy is come unto us, and when that comes,Sorrow shall fly away to them that are capable of it.38. I call unto Joy, the power of Temperance, a power whose Virtue ismost sweet; Let us take her unto ourselves, O Son, most willingly, forhow at her coming hath she put away Intemperance.39. Now I call the fourth, Continence, the power which is overConcupiscence. This, O Son, is the stable and firm foundation ofJustice.40. For see, how without labour, she hath chased away injustice andwe are justified, O Son, when Injustice is away.41. The sixth Virtue which comes into us, I call Communion, which isagainst Covetousness.42. And when that (Covetousness) is gone, I call Truth; and when shecometh, Error and Deceit vanisheth."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"43. See, O Son, how the Good is fulfilled by the access of Truth; for bythis means, Envy is gone from us; for Truth is accompanied with theGood, together also with Life and Light.44. And there came no more any torment of Darkness, but beingovercome, they are all fled away suddenly, and tumultuarily.45. Thou hast understood, O Son, the manner of Regeneration; forupon the coming of these Ten, the Intellectual Generation isperfected, and then it driveth away the twelve; and we have seen it inthe Generation itself.46. Whosoever therefore hath of Mercy obtained this Generationwhich is according to God, he leaving all bodily sense, knowethhimself to consist of divine things, and rejoiceth, being made by Godstable and immutable.47. Tat: O Father, I conceive and understand, not by the sight of mineeyes, but by the Intellectual Operation, which is by the Powers. I amin Heaven, in the Earth, in the Water, in the Air, I am in livingCreatures, in the Plants, in the Womb, everywhere.48. Yet tell me further, this one thing, How are the torments ofDarkness, being in number Twelve, driven away and expelled by theTen powers. What is the manner of it, Trismegistus?49. Hermes: This Tabernacle, O Son, consists of the Zodiacal Circle;and this consisting of twelve numbers, the Idea of one; but all formedNature admit of divers Conjugations to the deceiving of Man.50. And though they be different in themselves, yet are they united inpractice (as for example, Rashness is inseparable from Anger) andthey are also indeterminate: Therefore with good Reason, do theymake their departure, being driven away by the Ten powers; that is tosay, By the dead.51. For the number of Ten, O Son, is the Begetter of Souls. And thereLife and Light are united, where the number of Unity is born of theSpirit."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"52. Therefore according to Reason, Unity bath the number of Ten,and the number of Ten hath Unity.53. Tat: O Father, I now see the Universe, and myself in the Mind.54. Hermes: This is Regeneration, O Son, that we should not anylonger fix our magination upon this Body, subject to the threedimensions, according to this Speech which we have now commented.That we may not at all calumniate the Universe.55. Tat: Tell me, O Father, This Body that consists of Powers shall itever admit of any Dissolution?56. Hermes: Good words, Son, and speak not things impossible; forso thou shalt sin, and the eye of thy mind grow wicked.57. The sensible Body of Nature is far from the Essential Generation;for that is subject to Dissolution, but this not; and that is mortal, butthis immortal. Dost thou not know that thou art born a God and theSon of the One, as I am.58. Tat: How fain would I, O Father, hear that praise given by aHymn, which thou saidst, thou heardst from the Powers when I wasin the Octonary.59. Hermes: As Pimander said by way of Oracle to the Octonary, Thoudost well, O Son, to desire the Solution of the Tabernacle, for thou artpurified.60. Pimander, the Mind of absolute Power and Authority, hathdelivered no more unto me, than those that are written; knowing thatof myself, I can understand all things, and hear, and see what I will.And he commanded me to do those things that are good; andtherefore all the Powers that are in me sing.61. Tat: I would hear thee, O Father, and understand these things.62. Hermes: Be quiet, O Son, and now hearken to that harmoniousblessing and thanksgiving: the hymn of Regeneration, which I did notdetermine to have spoken of so plainly, but to thyself in the end of all."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"63. Wherefore this is not taught, but hid in silence.64. So then, O Son, do thou standing in the open Air, worship lookingto the North Wind, about the going down of the Sun, and to theSouth, when the Sun ariseth; And now keep silence, Son.The Secret SongThe Holy Speech65. Let all the Nature of the world entertain the hearing of this Hymn.66. Be opened, O Earth, and let all the Treasure of the Rain beopened.67. You Trees tremble not, for I will sing and praise the Lord of theCreation, and the All and the One.68. Be opened you Heavens, ye Winds stand still, and let theImmortal Circle of God receive these words.69. For I will sing, and praise him that created all things, that fixedthe Earth, and hung up the Heavens, and commanded the sweetWater to come out of the Ocean; into all the World inhabited, and notinhabited, to the use and nourishment of all things, or men.70. That commanded the fire to shine for very action, both to Godsand Men.71. Let us altogether give him blessing, which rideth upon theHeavens, the Creator of all Nature.72. This is he that is the Eye of the Mind, and Will accept the praise ofmy Powers.73. O all ye Powers that are in me, praise the One and the All.74. Sing together with my Will, all you Powers that are in me."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"75. O Holy Knowledge, being enlightened by thee, I magnify theintelligible Light, and rejoice in the Joy of the Mind.76. All my Powers sing praise with me, and thou my Continence, singpraise my Righteousness by me; praise that which is righteous.77. O Communion which is in me, praise the All.78. By me the Truth sings praise to the Truth, the Good praiseth theGood.79. O Life, O Light from us, unto you comes this praise andthanksgiving.80. I give thanks unto thee, O Father, the operation or act of myPowers.81. I give thanks unto thee, O God, the power of my operations.82. By me thy Word sings praise unto thee, receive by me thisreasonable (or verbal) sacrifice in words.83. The powers that are in me cry these things, they praise the All,they fulfil thy Will; thy Will and Counsel is from thee unto thee.84. O All, receive a reasonable Sacrifice from all things.85. O Life, save all that is in us: O Light enlighten, O God the Spirit;for the Mind guideth or feedeth the Word; O Spirit bearing Workman.86. Thou art God, thy Man crieth these things unto thee through bythe Fire, by the Air, by the Earth, by the Water, by the Spirit, by thyCreatures.87. From eternity I have found (means to) bless and praise thee, and Ihave what I seek, for I rest in thy Will.88. Tat: O Father, I see thou hast sung this Song of praise andblessing with thy whole Will; and therefore have I put and placed it inmy World."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"89. Hermes: Say in thy intelligible World, O Son.90. Tat: I do mean in my Intelligible World, for by thy Hymn andSong of Praise my mind is enlightened: And gladly would I send frommy Understanding a Thanksgiving unto God.91. Hermes: Not rashly, O Son.92. Tat: In my mind, O Father.93. Hermes: Those things that I see and contemplate, I infuse intothee; and therefore say, thou son Tat, the Author of thy succeedingGenerations, I send unto God these reasonable Sacrifices.94. O God, Thou art the Father, Thou art the Lord, Thou art the Mind,accept these reasonable Sacrifices which Thou requirest of Me.95. For all things are done as the Mind willeth.96. Thou, O Son, send this acceptable Sacrifice to God, the Father ofall things; but propound it also, O Son, by Word.97. Tat: Tank thee, Father, thou hast advised and instructed me thusto give praise and thanks.98. Hermes:I am glad, O Son, to see the Truth bring forth the Fruitsof Good things, and such immortal branches.99. And learn this of me: Above all other virtues entertain Silence,and impart unto no man, O Son, the tradition of Regeneration, lest webe reputed Calumniators; For we both have now sufficientlymeditated, I in speaking, thou in hearing. And now thou dostintellectually know thyself and our Father."}]
