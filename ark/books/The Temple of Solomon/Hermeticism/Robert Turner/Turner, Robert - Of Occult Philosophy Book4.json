Therefore inthis book, which we have composed and made as it were a Complement andKey of our other books of Occult Philosophy, and of all Magical Operations,we will give unto thee the documents of holy and undefiled verity, and Inex-pugnable and Unresistable Magical Discipline, and most pleasant and delec-table experiments of the sacred Deities. So that as by the reading of our otherbooks of Occult Philosophy, thou maist earnestly covet the knowledge ofthese things; even so with reading this book, thou shalt truely triumph.Wherefore let silence hide these things within the secret closets of they reli-gious breast, and conceal them with constant Taciturnity.This therefore is to be known, That the names of the intelligent presidentsof every one of the Planets are constituted after this maner: that is to say, Bycollecting together the letters out of the figure of the world, from the rising ofthe body of the Planet, according to the succession of the Signes through theseveral degrees; and out of the several degrees, from the aspects of the Planethimself, the calculation being made from the degree of the ascendant. In thelike maner are constituted the names of the Princes of the evil spirits; they are"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The fourth book2taken under all the Planets of the presidents in a retrograde order, the projec-tion being made contrary to the succession of the Signes, from the beginningof the seventh House. Now the name of the supreme & highest intelligence,which many do suppose to be the soul of the world, is collected out of thefour Cardinal points of the figure of the world, after the maner already deliv-ered: & by the opposite and contrary way, is known the name of the greatDaemon, or evil spirit, upon the four cadent Angles. In the like maner shaltthou understand the names of the great presidential spirits ruling in the Air,from the four Angles of the succedent Houses; so that as to obtain the namesof the good spirits, the calculation is to be made according to the successionof the signes, beginning from the degree of the ascendant; and to attain to thenames of the evil spirits, by working the contrary way.You must also observe, that the names of the evil spirits are extracted,aswel from the names of the good spirits, as of the evil: so notwithstanding,that if we enter the table with the name of a good spirit of the second order,the name of the evil spirit shall be extracted from the order of the Princes andGovernours; but if we enter the table with the name of an evil spirit a Gover-nour, after what maner soever they are extracted, whether by this table, orfrom a celestial figure, the names which to proceed from hence, shall be thenames of evil spirits, the Ministers of the inferiour order.It is further to be noted, That as often as we enter this table with the goodspirits of the second order, the names extracted are of the second order: and ifunder them we extract the name of an evil spirit, he is of the superiour orderof the Governours. The same order is, if we enter with the name of an evilspirit of the superiour order. If therefore we enter this table with the names ofthe spirits of the third order, or with the names of the ministring spirits,aswel of the good spirits, as of the evil, the names extracted shall be thenames of the ministring spirits of the inferiour order.But many Magicians, men of no small Authority, will have the tables ofthis kinde to be extended with Latine letters: so that by the same tables also,out of the name of any office or effect, might be found out the name of anyspirit, aswel good as evil, by the same maner which is above delivered, by tak-ing the name of the office or of the effect, in the columne of letters, in theirown line, under their own star. And of this practice Trismegistus is a greatAuthor, who delivered this kinde of calculation in Egyptian letters: notunproperly also may the be referred to other letters of other tongues, for thereasons assigned to the signes; for truly he only is extant of all men, who havetreated concerning the attaining to the names of spirits."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy3Therefore the force, secrecy and power, in what maner the sacred names ofspirits are truly and rightly found out, consisteth in the disposing of the vow-els, which do make the name of a spirit, and wherewith is constituted the truename and right word. Now this art is thus perfected and brought to pass:first, we are to take heed of the placing the vowels of the letters, which arefound by the calculation of the celestial figure, to finde the names of the spir-its of the second order, Presidents and Governours. And this in the goodspirits, is thus brought to effect, by considering the starts which do constituteand make the letters, and by placing them according to their order: first, letthe degree of the eleventh House be subtracted from the degree of that starwhich is first in order; and that which remaineth thereof, let it be projectedfrom the degree of the ascendant, and where that number endeth, there ispart of the vowel of the first letter: begin therefore to calculate the vowels ofthese letters, according to their number and order; and the vowel which fall-eth in the place of the star, which is first in order, the same vowel is attributedto the first letter. Then afterwards thou shalt finde the part of the second let-ter, by subtracting the degree of a star which is the second in order from thefirst star; and that which remaineth, cast from the ascendant. And this is thepart from which thou shalt begin the calculation of the vowels; and thatvowel which falleth upon the second star, the same is the vowel of the secondletter. And so consequently maist thou search out the vowels of the followingletters alwaies, by substracting the degree of the following star; from thedegree of the star next preceding and going before. And so also all calcula-tions and numerations in the names of the good spirits, ought to be madeaccording to the succession of the signes. And in calculating the names of theevil spirits, where in the names of the good spirits is taken the degree of theeleventh House, in these ought to be taken the degree of the twelfth House.And all numerations and calculations may be made with the succession of thesignes, by taking the beginning from the degree of the tenth House.But in all extractions by tables, the vowels are placed after another maner.In the first place therefore is taken the certain number of letters making thename itself, and is thus numbred from the beginning of the columne of thefirst letter, or whereupon the name is extracted; and the letter on which thisnumber falleth, is referred to the first letter of the name, extracted by takingthe distance of the one from the other, according to the order of the Alpha-bet. But the number of that distance is projected from the beginning of hiscolumne; and where it endeth, there is part of the first vowel: from thencetherefore thou shalt calculate the vowels themselves, in their own number and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The fourth book4order, in the same columne; and the vowel which shall fall upon the first let-ter of a name, the same shall be attributed to that name. Now thou shalt findethe following vowels, by taking the distance from the precedent vowel to thefollowing: and so consequently according to the succession of the Alphabet.And the number of that distance is to be numbered from the beginning of hisowne columne; and where he shall cease, there is the part of the vowel soughtafter. From thence therefore must you calculate the vowels, as we have above-said; and those vowels which shall fall upon their own letters, are to be attrib-uted to them; if therefore any vowel shall happen to fall upon a vowel, theformer must give place to the latter: and this you are to understand only ofthe good spirits. In the evil also you may proceed in the same way; exceptonly, that you make the numberations after a contrary and backward order,contrary to the succession of the Alphabet, and contrary to the order of thecolumnes (that is to say) in ascending. The name of good Angels, and of every man, which we have taught howto finde out, in our third book of Occult Philosophy, according to that maner,is of no little Authority, nor of a mean foundation. But now we will give untothee some other ways, illustrated with no vain reasons. One whereof is, bytaking in the figure of the nativity, the five places of Hylech: which beingnoted, the characters of the letters are projected in their order and numberfrom the beginning of Aries; and those letters which fall upon the degrees ofsaid places, according to their order and dignity disposed and aspected, domake the name of an Angel. There is also another way, wherein they do takeAlmutel, which is the ruling and governing stars over the aforesaid fiveplaces; and the projection is to be made from the degree of the ascendant;which is done by gathering together the letters falling upon Almutel: whichbeing placed in order, according to their dignity, do make the name of anAngel. There is furthermore another way used, and very much had in obser-vation among the Egyptians, by making their calculation from the degree ofthe ascendant, and by gathering together the letters according to the Almutelof the eleventh House; which House they call a good Daemon: which beingplaced according to their dignities, the names of the Angels are constituted.Now the names of the evil Angels are known after the like maner, except onlythat the projections must be performed contrary to the course and order ofthe succession of the signes, so that whereas in seeking the names of goodspirits, we are to calculate from the beginning of Aries; contrariwise, in attain-ing the names of the evil, we ought to account from the beginning of Libra.And whereas in the good spirits we number from the degree of the ascendant;"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy5contrarily, in the evil, we must calculate from the degree of the seventhHouse. But according to the Egyptians, the name of an Angel is collectedaccording to the Almutel of the twelfth House, which they call an evil spirit.Now all those rites, which are elsewhere already by us delivered in our thirdbook of Occult Philosophy, may be made by the characters of any language.In all which (as we have abovesaid) there is a mystical and divine number,order and figure; from whence it cometh to pass, that the same spirit may becalled by divers names. But others are discovered from the name of the spirithimself, of the good or evil, by tables formed to this purpose.Now these celestial characters do consist of lines and heads: the heads aresix, according to the six magnitudes of the stars, whereunto the planets alsoare reduced. The first magnitude holdeth a Star, with the Sun, or a Cross.The second with Jupiter in a circular point. The third holdeth with Saturn, asemicircle, a triangle, either crooked, round, or acute. The fourth with Mars,a little stroke penetrating the line, either square, straight, or oblique. Thefifth with Venus and Mercury, a little stroke or point with a tail, ascending ordescending. The sixth with the Moon, a point made black. All you may see inthe ensuing table. The heads then being posited according to the site of theStars in the figure of Heaven, then the lines are to be drawn out, according tothe congruency or agreement of their natures. And this you are to understandof the fixed Stars. But in the erecting of the Planets, the lines are drawn out,the heads being posited according to their course and nature amongst them-selves.When therefore a character is to be found of any celestial Image ascendingin any degree or face of a signe, which do consist of Stars of the same magni-tude and nature; then the number of these Stars being posited according totheir place and order, the lines are drawn after the similitude of the Imagesignified, as copiously as the same can be done. But the Characters which are extracted according to the name of a spirit,are composed by the table following, by giving to every letter that namewhich agreeth unto him, out of the table; which although it may appear easieto those that apprehend it, yet there is herein no small difficulty; To wit,when the letter of a name falleth upon the line of letters or figures, that wemay know which figure or which letter is to be taken. And this may be thusknown: for if a letter falleth upon the line of letters, consider of what numberthis letter may be in the order of the name; as the second, or the third; thenhow many letters that name containeth; as five or seven; and multiply thesenumbers one after another by themselves, and triple the product: then cast"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The fourth book6the whole (being added together) from the beginning of the letters, accordingto the succession of the Alphabet: and the letter upon which that numbershall happen to fall, ought to be placed for the character of that spirit. But ifany letter of a name fall on the line of figures, it is thus to be wrought. Takethe number how many this letter is in the order of the name, and let it bemultiplied by that number of which this letter is in the order of the Alphabet;and being added together, divide it by nine, and the remainder sheweth thefigure or number to be placed in the character: and this may be put either in aGeometrical or Arithmetical figure of number; which notwithstanding oughtnot to exceed the number of nine, or nine Angles.But the Characters which are understood by the revelation of Spirits, taketheir vertue from thence; because they are, as it were, certain hidden seals,making the harmony of some divinity: either they are signes of a Covenantentred into, and of promised and plighted faith, or of obedience. And thoseCharacters cannot by any other means be searched out.Moreover, besides these Characters, there are certain familiar Figures orImages of evil Spirits, under which forms they are wont to appear, and yieldobedience to them that invoke them. All these Characters or Images may beseen by the table following, according to the course of the letters constitutingthe names of Spirits themselves: so that if in any letter there is found morethen the name of one Spirit, his Image holdeth the pre-eminence, the othersimparting their own order; so that they which are the first orders, to them isStars.Heads.Lines Joyned to the Heads."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy7The Characters of good Spirits.A simple point.Round.StarryStraight standing lineLying.Oblique.Line Crooked like a bow.Like waves.ToothedIntersection right.Inherent.Adhering separate.Oblique intersection simple.Mixt.Manifold.Perpendicular right dexter.Sinister.Neuter.A whole figure.Broken.Half.A letter inhering.Adhering.Separate."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The fourth book8The Characters of evil Spirits.A right line.Crooked.Reflexed.A simple figure.Penetrate.Broken.A right letter.Retrograde.Inversed.Flame.Winde.Water.A mass.Rain.ClayA flying thing.A creeping thing.A serpent.An eye.A hand.A foot.A crown.A crest.Horns."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy9attributed the head, the upper part of the body, according to their own figure:those which are lowest, do possess the thighs and feet; so also the middle let-ters do attribute like to themselves the middle parts of the body, or give theparts that fit. But if there happen any contrariety, that letter which is thestronger in the number shall bear rule: and if they are equal, they all impartequal things. Furthermore, if any name shall obtain any notable Character orInstrument out of the Table, he shall likewise have the same character in theImage.We may also attain to the knowledge of the dignities of the evil Spirits, bythe same Tables of Characters and images: for upon what spirit soever therefalleth any excellent signe or instrument out of the Table of Characters, hepossesseth that dignity. As if there shall be Crown, it sheweth a Kingly dig-nity; if a Crest or Plume, a Dukedom; if a Horn, a County; if without thesethere be a Scepter, Sword, or forked Instrument, it sheweth Rule andAuthority. Likewise out of the Table of Images you shall finde them whichbear the chief Kingly dignity: from the Crown judge dignity; and from theInstruments, Rule and Authority. Lastly, they which bear an humane shapeand figure, have greater dignity then those which appear under the Formsand Images of Beasts; they also who ride, do excel them which appear onfoot. And thus according to all their commixtures, you may judge the dignityand excellency of Spirits, one before another. Moreover, you must under-stand, that the Spirits of the inferior order, of what dignity soever they be, arealwaies subject to the Spirits of the superior order: so also, that it is notincongruent for their Kings and Dukes to be Subject and Minister to thepresidents of the superior order.The shapes familiar to the Spirits of Saturn.\u0001They appear for the most part with a tall, lean and slender body, with anangry countenance, having four faces; one in the hinder part of the head, oneon the former part of the head, and on each side nosed or beaked: there like-wise appeareth a face on each knee, of a black shining color: their motion isthe moving of the winde, with a kinde of earthquake: their signe is whichearth, whiter than any Snow."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The fourth book10The particular forms are,A King having a beard, riding on a Dragon.An Old man with a beard.An Old woman leaning on a staffe.A Hog.A Dragon.An Owl.A Black Garment.A Hooke or Sickle.A Juniper-tree.The familiar forms to the Spirits of Jupiter.\u0002The Spirits of Jupiter do appear with a body sanguine and cholerick, of amiddle stature, with a horrible fearful motion; but with a milde countenance,a gentle speech, and of the color of Iron.

And these pentacles do consist either of Characters of the good spir-its or the superior order, or of sacred pictures of holy letters or revelations,with apt and fit versicles, which are composed either of Geometrical figuresand holy names of God, according to the course and maner of many of them;or they are compounded of all of them, or very many of them mixt. And theCharacters which are useful for us to constitute and make the pentacles, theyare the Characters of the good Spirits, especially and chiefly of the good Spir-its of the first and second order, and sometimes also of the third order. Andthis kinde of Characters are especially to be named holy; and then thoseCharacters which we have above called holy. What Character soever there-fore of this kinde is to be instituted, we must draw about him a double circle,wherein we must write the name of his Angel: and if we will adde somedivine name congruent with his Spirit and Office, it will be of the greaterforce and efficacy. And if we will draw about him any angular figure, accord-ing to the maner of his numbers, that also shall be lawful to be done. But the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The fourth book14holy pictures which do make the pentacles, are they which everywhere aredelivered unto us in the Prophets and Sacred Writings, as well of the old as ofthe new Testament. Even as the figure of the Serpent hanging on the cross,and such-like; wereof very many may be found out of the visions of theProphets, as of Esaias, Daniel, Esdras and others, and also out of the revela-tion of the Apocalypse. And we have spoken of them in our third book ofOccult Philosophy, where we have made mention of holy things. Thereforewhen any picture is posited of any of these holy Images, let the circle bedrawn round about it on each side thereof, wherein let there be written somedivine name, that is apt and conformed to the effect of that figure, or elsethere may be written about it some versicle taken out of part of the body ofholy Scripture, which may desire to ascertain or deprecate the desired effect.As, if a pentacle were to be made to gain victory or revenge against ones ene-mies, aswel visible as invisible, The figure may be taken out of the secondbook of the Macchabees: that is to say, a hand holding a golden Sword drawn,about which let there be written about it a versicle there contained; To wit,Take thy holy Sword, the gift of God, wherewith thou shalt slay the adversaries ofmy people Israel. Or also there may be written about it a versicle of the fifthPsalm: In this is the strength of thy arm: before thy face there is death; or some-such like versicle. But if you write any divine name about the figure, then letsome name be taken that signifies Fear, a Sword, Wrath, the Revenge ofGod, or some such-like name congruent and agreeing with the effect desired.And if there shall be written any Angular figure, let him be taken accordingto the reason and rule of the numbers, as we have taught in our second bookof Occult Philosophy, where we have treated of the numbers, and of the likeoperations. And of this sort there are two pentacles of sublime vertue andgreat power, very useful and necessary to be used in the consecration of exper-iments and Spirits: one whereof is that in the first chapter of Apocalypse; Towit, a figure of the Majesty of God sitting upon a Throne, having in hismouth a two-edged Sword, as there it is written, about which let there bewritten, I am Alpha & Omega, the beginning and the end, which is, and whichwas, and which is to come, the Almighty. I am the first and the last, who am living,and was dead, and behold I live for ever and ever; and I have the keys of death andhell. Then there shall be written about it these three versicles.Manda Deus virtuti tua, &c.Give commandment, O God, to thy strength.Confirm, Oh God, thy work in us.The brazen serpent set up in the wil-derness.Accipe gla-dium sanc-tum, munus a Deo, in quo con-cides adversar-ios populi mei Israel.Ego sum pri-mus & novissi-mus, vivus & sui mortuus; & ecce sum viv-ens in sicula siculorum; & habeo claves mortis & inferni."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy15Let them be as dust before the face of the winde. And let the Angel of the Lordscatter them. Let all their wayes be darkness and uncertain. And let the Angel of theLord persecute them.Moreover, let there be written about it the ten general names, which are,El, Elohim, Elohe, Zebaoth, Elion, Escerchie, Adonay, Jah, Tetragrammaton,Saday.There is another pentacle, the figure whereof is like unto a Lambe slain,having seven eyes, and seven horns, and under his feet a book sealed with sevenseals, as it is in the 5.chap. of the Apocalypse. Whereabout let there be writtenthis versicle: Behold the Lion hath overcome of the Tribe of Judah, the root ofDavid. I will open the book, and unloose the seven seals thereof. And one otherversicle: I saw Satan like lightning fall down from the heaven. Behold, I havegiven you power to tread upon Serpents and Scorpions, and over all the power ofyour enemies, and nothing shall be able to hurt you. And let there be also writtenabout it the ten general names, as aforesaid.But those Pentacles which are thus made of figures and names, let themkeep this order: for when any figure is posited, conformable to any number, toproduce any certain effect or vertue, there must be written thereupon, in allthe several Angles, some Divine name, obtaining the force and efficacie ofthe thing desired: yet so nevertheless, that the name which is of this sort doconsist of just so many letters, as the Figure may constitute a number; or of somany letters of a name, as joyned together amongst themselves, may makethe number of a Figure; or by any number which may be divided without anysuperfluity or diminution. Now such a name being found, whether it be onelyone name or more, or divers names, it is to be written in all the several Anglesof the Figure: but in the middle of the Figure let the revolution of the namebe whole and totally placed, or at least principally.Oftentimes also we constitute Pentacles, by making the revolution of somekinde of name, in a square Table, and by drawing about it a single or doubleCircle, and by writing therein some holy Versicle competent and befittingthis name, or from which that name is extracted. And this is the way of mak-ing the Pentacles, according to their several distinct forms and fashions,which we may as we please either multiply or commix together by courseamong themselves, to work the greater efficacie, and extension and enlarge-ment of force and vertue.As, if a deprecation should be made for the overthrow and destruction ofones enemies, then we are to minde and call to remembrance how God"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The fourth book16destroyed the whole face of the earth in the deluge of waters; and the destruc-tion of Sodom and Gomorrha, by raining down fire and brimstone; likewise,how God overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red-Sea: and to call tominde if any other malediction or curse be found in holy Writ. And thus inthings of the like sort. So likewise in deprecating and praying against perilsand dangers of waters, we ought to call to remembrance the saving of Noahin the deluge of waters, the passing of the children of Israel thorow the Red-Sea; and also we are to minde how Christ walked upon the waters, and savedthe ship in danger to be cast away with the tempest; and how he commandedthe windes and the waves, and they obeyed him; and also, that he drew Peterout of the water, being in danger of drowning: and the like. And lastly, withthese we invoke and call upon some certain holy names of God, God; to wit,such as are significative to accomplish our desire, and accomodated to thedesired effect: as, if it be to overthrow enemies, we are to invoke and callupon the names of wrath, revenge, fear, justice, and fortitude of God: and ifwe would avoid and escape any evil or danger, we then call upon the names ofmercy, defence, salvation, fortitude, goodness, and such-like names of God.When also we pray unto God that he would grant unto us our desires, we arelikewise to intermix therewith the name of some good spirit, whether oneonely, or more, whose office it is to execute our desires: and sometimes alsowe require some evil spirit to restrain or compel, whose name likewise weintermingle; and that rightly especially, if it be to execute any evil work; asrevenge, punishment, or destruction.Furthermore, if there be any Versicle in the Psalms, or in any other part ofholy Scripture, that shall seem congruent and agreeable to our desire, thesame is to be mingled with our prayers. Now after Prayer hath been madeunto God, it is expedient afterwards to make an Oration to that executionerwhom in our precedent prayer unto God we have desired should administerunto us, whether one or more, or whether he be an Angel, or Star, or Soul, orany of the noble Angels. But this kinde of Oration ought to be composedaccording to the Rules which we have delivered in the second book of OccultPhilosophy, where we have treated of the manner of the composition ofInchantments.You may know further, that these kinde of bonds have a threefold differ-ence: for the first bond is, when we conjure by Natural things: the second iscompounded of Religious mysteries, by Sacraments, Miracles, and things ofthis sort: and the third is constituted by Divine names, and holy Sigils. Andby these kinde of bonds, we may binde not onely spirits, but also all other"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy17creatures whatsoever; as animals, tempests, burnings,* floods of waters, andthe force and power of Arms. Oftentimes also we use these bonds aforesaid,not onely by Conjuration, but sometimes also using the means of Depreca-tion and Benediction. Moreover, it conduceth much to this purpose, to joynsome sentence of holy Scripture, if any shall be found convenient hereunto:as, in the Conjuration of Serpents, by commemorating the curse of the Ser-pent in the earthly Paradise, and the setting up of the Serpent in the wilder-ness; and further adding that Versicle, Thou shalt walk upon the Asp and theBasilisk, &c. Superstition also is of much prevalency herein, by the translationof some Sacramental Rites, to binde that which we intend to hinder; as, theRites of Excommunication, of Sepulchres, Funerals, Buryings, and the like.And now we come to treat of the Consecrations which men ought to makeupon all instruments and things necessary to be used in this Art: and the ver-tue of this Consecration most chiefly consists in two things; to wit, in thepower of the person consecrating, and by the vertue of the prayer by whichthe Consecration is made. For in the person consecrating, there is requiredholiness of Life, and power of sanctifying: both which are acquired by Digni-fication and Initiation. And that the person himself should with a firm andundoubted faith believe the vertue, power, and efficacie hereof. And then inthe Prayer it self by which this Consecration is made, there is required thelike holiness; which either solely consisteth in the prayer it self, as, if it be bydivine inspiration ordained to this purpose, such as we have in many places ofthe holy Bible; or that is be hereunto instituted through the power of theHoly Spirit, in the ordination of the Church. Otherwise there is in the Prayera Sanctimony, which is not onely by it self, but by the commemoration ofholy things; as, the commemoration of holy Scriptures, Histories, Works,Miracles, Effects, Graces, Promises, Sacraments and Sacramental things, andthe like. Which things, by a certain similitude, do seem properly or improp-erly to appertain to the thing consecrated.There is used also the invocation of force Divine names, with the consig-nation of holy Seals, and things of the like sort, which do conduce to sanctifi-cation and expiation; such as are the Sprinkling with Holy-Water, Unctionswith holy Oyl, and odoriferous Suffumigations appertaining to holy Wor-ship. And therefore in every Consecration there is chiefly used the Benedic-tion and Consecration of Water, oyl, Fire, and Fumigations, used everywherewith holy Waxlights or Lamps burning: for without Lights no Sacrament isrightly performed. This therefore is to be known and firmly observed, That if* Incendia; Envie and Malice.Super aspi-dem & basiliscum ambulabis, &c."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The fourth book18any Consecration be to be made of things profane, in which there is any pol-lution or defilement, then an exorcising and expiation of those things oughtto precede the Consecration. Which things being to made pure are more aptto receive the influences of the Divine vertues. We are also to observe, that inthe end of every Consecration, after that the prayer is rightly performed, theperson consecrating, ought to bless the thing consecrated. by breathing outsome words, with divine vertue and power of the present Consecration, withthe commemoration of his vertue and authority, that it may be the moreduely performed, and with an earnest and intentive minde. And therefore wewill here lay down some examples hereof, whereby the way to the whole per-fection hereof may the more easily be made to appear unto you.So then, in the Consecration of water, we ought to Commemorate howthat God hath placed the firmament in the midst of the waters, and in whatmaner that God placed the fountain of waters in the earthly Paradise, fromwhence sprang four holy rivers, which watered the whole earth. Likewise weare to call to remembrance in what manner God made the water to be theinstrument of executing his justice in the destruction of the Gyants in thegeneral deluge over all the earth, and in the overthrow of the host of Pharaohin the Red-sea; also, how God led his own people thorow the midst of theSea on dry ground, and through the midst of the river of Jordan; and likewisehow marvelously he drew forth water out of the stony rock in the wilderness;and how at the prayer of Samson, he caused a fountain of running water toflow out of the cheek-tooth of the jaw-bone of an ass: and likewise, how Godhath made waters the instrument of his mercy, and of salvation, for the expi-ation of original sin: also, how Christ was baptized in Jordan, and haththereby sanctified and cleansed the waters.Moreover, certain divine names are to be invocated, which are conform-able hereunto; as, that God is a living fountain, living water, the fountain ofmercy; and names of the like kinde.And likewise, in the consecration of fire, we are to commemorate how thatGod hath created the fire to be an instrument to execute his justice, for pun-ishment, vengeance, and for the expiation of sins: also, when God shall cometo judge the world, he will command a conflagration of fire to go before him.And we are to call to remembrance in what manner God appeared to Mosesin the burning bush; and also, how he went before the children of Israel in apillar of fire; and that nothing can be duely offered, sacrificed, or sanctified,without fire; and how that God instituted fire to be kept continually burningin the Tabernacle of the Covenant; and how miraculously he re-kindled the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy19same, being extinct, and preserved it elsewhere from going out, being hiddenunder the waters: and things of this sort. Likewise, the Names of God are tobe called upon which are consonant hereunto; as, it is read in the Law and theProphets, that God is a consuming fire: and if there be any of the Divinenames which signifies fire, or such-like names; as, the glory of God, the lightof God, the splendor and brightness of God.And likewise in the Consecration of Oyl and Perfumes, we are to call toremembrance such holy things as are pertinent to this purpose, which we readin Exodus of the holy anoynting oyl, and divine names significant hereunto,such as is the name Christ, which signifies anoynted: and what mysteriesthere are hereof; as that in the Revelation, of the two Olive-trees distillingholy oyl into the lamps that burn before the face of God: and the like.And the blessing of the lights, wax, and lamps, is taken from the fire, andthe altar which containeth the substance of the flame: and what other suchsimilitudes as are in mysteries; as that of the seven candlesticks and lampsburning before the face of God.These therefore are the Consecrations which first of all are necessary to beused in every kinde of devotion, and ought to precede it, and without whichnothing in holy Rites can be, duely performed.In the next place now we shall shew unto you the Consecration of Places,instruments and such-like things.Therefore when you would consecrate any Place or Circle, you ought totake the prayer of Solomon used in the dedication of the Temple: and more-over, you must bless the place with the sprinkling of Holy-water, and withFumigations; by commemorating in the benediction holy mysteries; such asthese are: The sanctification of the throne of God, of mount Sinai, of theTabernacle of the Covenant, of the Holy of holies, of the temple of Jerusa-lem. Also, the sanctification of mount Golgotha, by the crucifying of Christ;the sanctification of the Temple of Christ; of mount Tabor, by the transfigu-ration and ascension of Christ: and the like. And by invocating divine nameswhich are significant hereunto; such as the Place of God, the Throne of God,the Chayr of God, the Tabernacle of God, the Altar of God, the Habitationof God and such-like divine names of this sort which are to be written aboutthe Circle or place to be consecrated.And in the consecrations of instruments, and of all other things whatso-ever that are serviceable to this Art, you shall proceed after the same manner,by sprinkling the same with Holy water, perfuming the same with holySanctum sanctorum."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The fourth book20Fumigations, anoynting it with holy Oyl, sealing it with some holy Sigil, andblessing it with prayer; and by commemorating holy things out of the sacredScriptures, Religion, and Divine names which shall be found agreeable to thething that is to be consecrated: as for examples sake, in consecrating a sword,we are to call to remembrance that in the Gospel, He that hath two coats, &c.and that place in the second of the Macchabees, That a sword was divinelyand miraculously sent to Judas Macchabeus. And if there be any thing of thelike in the Prophets; as that place, Take unto you two-edged swords, &c.In like maner you shall consecrate experiments and books and whatsoeverof the like nature, as is contained in writings, pictures, and the like by sprin-kling, perfuming, anointing, sealing, and blessing with holy commemora-tions, and calling to remembrance the sanctifications of mysteries; As, thesanctifying of the Tables of the ten Commandments, which were delivered toMoses by God in Mount Sinai; The sanctification of the Testaments of God,the Old and New; The sanctification of the Law, and of the Prophets, andScriptures, which are promulgated by the holy Ghost. Moreover, there is to be commemorated such divine names as are fit andconvenient hereunto; as there are: The Testament of God, The book of God,The book of life, The knowledge of God, The wisdom of God; and the like.And with such kinde of Rites is the personal Consecration performed.There is furthermore, besides these, another Rite of consecration, of won-derful power, and much efficacy; And this is out of the kindes of supersti-tions: That is to say, when the Rite of Consecration or collection of anySacrament in the Church is transferred to that thing which we would conse-crate.It is to be known also, that Vowes, Oblations, and Sacrifice, have thepower of consecration, aswel real as personal; and they are as it were certaincovenants and conventions between those names with which they are made,and us who make them, strongly cleaving to our desire and wished effect: As,when we dedicate, offer, and sacrifice, with certain names or things; as,Fumigations, Unctions, Rings, Images, Looking-glasses; and things lessmaterial, as Deities, Sigils, Pentacles, Inchantments, Orations, Pictures, andScriptures: of which we have largely spoken in our third book of Occult Phi-losophy.There is extant amongst those Magicians (who do most use the ministeryof evil spirits) a certain Rite of invocating spirits by a Book to be consecratedbefore to that purpose, which is properly called, A book of Spirits; whereof wenow speak a few words. For this book is to be consecrated, a book of evil spir-Qui habet duas tun-icas, &c.Accipte vobis glad-ios bis acu-tos.Liber Spir-ituum."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy21its, ceremoniously to be composed, in their name and order: whereunto theybinde with a certain holy Oath, the ready and present obedience of the spirittherein written.Now this book is to be made of most pure and clean paper, that hath neverbeen used before; which many do call Virgin-paper. And this book must beinscribed after this maner: that is to say, Let there be placed on the left sidethe image of the spirit, and on the right side his character, with the Oathabove it, containing the name of the spirit, and his dignity and place, with hisoffice and power. Yet very many do compose this book otherwise, omittingthe characters or image: but it is more efficacious not to neglect any thingwhich conduceth to it.Moreover, there is to be observed the circumstances of places, times,hours, according to the Stars which these spirits are under, and are seen toagree unto, their site, rite, and order being applied.Which book being so written, and well bound, is to be adorned, gar-nished, and kept secure, with Registers and Seals, lest is should happen afterthe Consecration to open in some place not intented, and indanger the oper-ator. Furthermore this book ought to be kept as reverently as may be: forirreverence of minde causeth is to lose its vertue, with pollution and profana-tion.Now this sacred book being thus composed according to the maner alreadydelivered, we are then to proceed to the Consecration thereof after a twofoldway: one whereof is, That all and singular the spirits who are Written in thebook, be called to the Circle, according to the Rites and Order which we havebefore taught; and the book that is to be consecrated, let it be placed withoutthe Circle in a triangle. And in the first place, let there be read in the presenceof the spirits all the Oathes which are written in that book; and then the bookto be consecrated being placed without the Circle in a triangle there drawn,let all the spirits be compelled to impose their hands where their images andcharacters are drawn, and to confirm and consecrate the same with a specialand common oath. Which being done, let the book be taken and shut, andpreserved as we have before spoken, and let the spirits be licensed to depart,according to due rite and order.There is another maner of consecrating a book of spirits which is moreeasie, and of much efficacie to produce every effect, except that in openingthis book the spirits do not always come visible. And this way is thus: Letthere be made a book of spirits as We have before set forth; but in the endthereof let there be written invocations and Bonds, and strong Conjurations,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The fourth book22wherewith every spirit may be bound. Then this book must be boundbetween two Tables or Lamens, and in the inside thereof let there be drawnthe holy Pentacles of the Divine Majestie, which we have before set forth anddescribed out of the Apocalypse: then let the first of them be placed in thebeginning of the book, and the second at the end of the same. This bookbeing perfected after this maner, let it be brought in a clear and fair time, to aCircle prepared in a cross way, according to the Art which we have beforedelivered; and there in the first place the book being opened, let it be conse-crated to the rites and ways which we have before declared concerning Con-secration. Which being done, let all the spirits be called which are written inthe book in their own order and place, by conjuring them thrice by the bondsdescribed in the book, that they come unto that place within the space ofthree days, to assure their obedience, and confirm the same, to the book so tobe consecrated. Then let the book be wrapped up in clean linen, and buriedin the middle of the Circle, and there fast stopped up: and then the Circlebeing destroyed, after the spirits are licensed, depart before the rising of thesun: and on the third day, about the middle of the night, return, and newmake the Circle, and with bended knees make prayer and giving thanks untoGod, and let a precious perfume be made, and open the hole, and take outthe book; and so let it be kept, not opening the same.Then you shall licensethe spirits in their order, and destroying the Circle, depart before the sun rise.And this is the last rite and maner of consecrating profitable to whatsoeverwritings and experiments, which do direct to spirits, placing the samebetween two holy Lamens or Pentacles, as before is shewn.But the Operator, when he would work by the book thus consecrated, lethim do is in a fair and clear season, when the spirits are least troubled; and lethim place himself towards the region of the spirits. Then let him open thebook under a due Register; let him invoke the spirits by their Oath theredescribed and confirmed, and by the name of their character and image, tothat purpose which you desire: and, if there be need, conjure them by thebonds placed in the end of the book. And having attained your desired effect,then you shall license the spirits to depart.And now we shall come to speak concerning the invocation of spirits, aswell of the good spirits as of the bad.The good spirits may be invocated of us, divers ways and in sundry man-ners do offer themselves unto us. For they do openly speak to those thatwatch, and do offer themselves to our sight, or do inform us in dreams by"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy23oracle of those things which are desired. Whosoever therefore would call anygood spirit, to speak or appear in sight, is behoveth them especially to observetwo things: one whereof is about the disposition of the invocant; the otherabout those things which are outwardly to be adhibited to the invocation, forthe conformity of the spirits to be called. It behoveth therefore that the invo-cant himself be religiously disposed for many days to such a mystery. In thefirst place therefore, he ought to be confessed and contrite, both inwardly andoutwardly, and rightly expiated, by daily washing himself with holy water.Moreover, the invocant ought to conserve himself all these days, chaste,abstinent, and to separate himself as much as may be done, from all perturba-tion of minde, and from all maner of forraign and secular business. Also, heshall observe fastings all these days, as much as shall seem convenient to himto be done. Also, let him daily between sun-rising and sun-setting, beingclothed with a holy linen garment, seven times call upon God, and make adeprecation to the Angels to be called according to the rule which we havebefore taught. Now the number of days of fasting and preparation, is com-monly the time of a whole Lunation. There is also another number observedamongst the Caballists, which is fourty days.Now concerning those things which do appertain to this Rite of Invoca-tion, the first is, That a place be chosen; clean, pure, close, quiet, free from allmaner of noise, and not subject to any strangers sight. This place must first beexorcised and consecrated: and let there be a table or altar placed therein, cov-ered with clean white linen, and set towards the east: and on each sidethereof, let there be set two consecrated wax-lights burning, the flamewhereof ought not to go out all these days. In the middle of the altar, let therebe placed Lamens, or the holy paper which we have before described, coveredwith pure fine linen; which is not to be opened until the end of these days ofthe Consecration. You shall also have in readiness a precious perfume, andpure anointing oyl; and let them be both kept consecrated.There must also a Censer be set on the head of the altar, wherein you shallkindle the holy fire, and make a perfume every day that YOU shall pray. Youshall also have a long garment of white linen, close before and behinde, whichmay cover the whole body and the feet, and girt about you with a girdle. Youshall also have a veil of pure clean linen, and in the fore-part thereof let therebe fixed golden or gilded Lamens, with the inscription of the name Te t ra-grammaton; all which things are to be sanctified and consecrated, in order.But you must not enter into the holy place, unless it be first washed, and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The fourth book24arayed with a holy garment; and then you shall enter into it with your feetnaked. And when you enter therein, you shall sprinkle it with holy water:then you shall make a perfume upon the altar, and afterwards with bendedknees pray before the altar as we have directed. But in the end of these days, on the last day, you shall fast more strictly:and fasting on the day following, at the rising of the sun, you may enter intothe holy place, using the ceremonies before spoken of, first by sprinkling yourself, then with making a perfume, you shall signe your self with holy oyl inthe forehead, and anoint your eyes; using prayer in all these Consecrations.Then you shall open the holy Lamen, and pray before the altar upon yourknees, as abovesaid: and then an invocation being made to the Angels, theywill appear unto you, which you desire; which you shall entertain with abenign and chaste communication, and license them to depart.Now the Lamen which is to be used to invoke any good spirit, you shallmake after this maner; either in metal conformable, or in new wax, mixt withspecies and colours conformable: or it may be made in clean paper, with con-venient colours: and the outward form or figure thereof may be square, circu-lar, or triangular, or of the like sort, according to the rule of the numbers: inwhich there must be written the divine names, as well the general names asthe special. And in the centre of the Lamen, let there be drawn a character ofsix corners; in the middle whereof, let there be written the name and charac-ter of the Star, or of the Spirit his governour, to whom the good spirit that isto be called is subject. And about this character let there be placed so manycharacters of five corners, as the spirits we would call together at once. And ifwe shall call onely one spirit, nevertheless there shall be made four Pen-tagones, wherein the name of the spirit or spirits with their characters, is tobe written. Now this table ought to be composed when the Moon is increas-ing, on those days and hours which then agree to the Spirit. And if we take afortunate star herewith, It will be the better. Which Table being made in thismanner, it is to be consecrated, according to the rules above delivered.And this is the way of making the general Table, serving for the invocationof all good spirits whatsoever. Nevertheless we may make special Tables con-gruent to every spirit, by the rule which we have above spoken of concerningholy Pentacles.And now we will declare unto you another Rite more easie to perform thisthing: that is to say, Let the man that is to receive any Oracle from the goodspirits be chaste, pure, and confess'd. Then a place being prepared pure andclean, and covered everywhere with white linen, on the Lords day in the newHexagonus.Pentagonus."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy25of the moon let him enter into that place, clothed with clean white garments;and let him exorcize the place, and bless it, and make a Circle therein with asanctified cole; and let there be written in the uttermost part of the Circle thenames of the Angels, and in the inner part thereof let there be written themighty names of God: and let him place within the Circle, at the four anglesof the world, the Censers for the perfumes. Then let him enter the place fast-ing, and washed, and let him begin to pray towards the east this whole Psalm:Beati immaculati in via, &c. Blessed art the undefiled in the Way, &c. by perfum-ing; and in the end deprecating the Angels, by the said divine names, thatthey will daign to discover and reveal that which he desireth: and that let himdo six days, continuing washed and fasting. And on the seventh day, which isthe Sabbath, let him, being washed and fasting, enter the Circle, and perfumeit, and anoint himself with holy anointing oyl, by anointing his forehead, andupon both his eyes, and in the palms of his hands, and upon his feet. Thenupon his knees let him say the Psalm aforesaid, with Divine and Angelicalnames. Which being said, let him arise, and let him begin to walk about in acircuit within the said Circle from the east to the west, until he is weariedwith a dizziness of his brain: let him fall down in the Circle, and there he mayrest; and forthwith he shall be wrapt up in an ecstasie, and a spirit will appearunto him, which will inform him of all things. We must observe also, that inthe Circle there ought to be four holy candles burning at the four parts of theworld which ought not to want light for the space of a whole week. And themaner of fasting must be such, that he abstain from all things having a life ofSense, and from those things which do proceed from them: and let him onelydrink pure running water: neither let him take any food till the going down ofthe sun. And let the perfume and the holy anointing oyl be made, as is setforth in Exodus and the other holy books of the Bible. It is also to beobserved, that always as often as he enters into the Circle, he have upon hisforehead a golden Lamen, upon which there must be written the name Te t ra-grammaton, as we have before spoken.But natural things, and their commixtures, do also belong unto us, and areconducing to receive Oracles from any spirit by a dream: which are eitherPerfumes, unctions, and Meats or Drinks: which you may understand in ourfirst book of Occult Philosophy.But he that is willing always and readily to receive the Oracles of a Dream,let him make unto himself a Ring of the Sun or of Saturn for this purpose.There is also an Image to be made, of excellent efficacie and power to workPsalm 119."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The fourth book26this which being put under his head when he goeth to sleep, doth effectuallygive true dreams of what things soever the minde hath before determined orconsulted on. The Tables of Numbers do likewise confer to receive an oracle,being duly formed under their own Constellations. And these things thoumayst know in the third book of Occult Philosophy. Holy Tables and papers do also serve to this effect, being specially com-posed and consecrated: such as is the Almadel of Solomon, and the Table ofthe Revolution of the name Tetragrammaton. And those things which are ofthis kinde, and written unto these things, out of divers figures, numbers; holypictures, with the inscriptions of the holy names of God and of Angels; thecomposition whereof is taken out of divers places of the holy Scriptures,Psalms, and Versicles, and other certain promises of the divine Revelationand Prophecies.To the same effect do conduce holy prayers and imprecations, as well untoGod, as to the holy Angels and Heroes: the imprecations of which prayers areto be composed as we have before shewn, according to some religious simili-tude of Miracles, Graces, and the like, making mention of those things whichwe intend to do: as, out of the Old Testament, of the dream of Jacob, Joseph,Pharaoh, Daniel, and Nebuchadnezzar: if out of the New Testament, of thedream of Joseph the husband of the blessed virgin Mary; of the dream of thethree Wise-men; of John the Evangelist of sleeping upon the brest of ourLord: and whatsoever of the like kinde can be found in Religion, Miracles,and Revelations; as, the revelation of the Cross to Helen, the revelations ofConstantine and Charles the Great, the revelations of Bridget, Cyril, Method-ius, Mechtild, Joachim, Merhir, and suchlike. According to which, let the dep-recations be composed, if when he goeth to sleep it be with a firm intentionand the rest well disposing themselves, let them pray devoutly, and withoutdoubt they will afford a powerful effect.Now he that knoweth how to compose those things which we have nowspoken of, he shall receive the most true Oracles of dreams. And this he shalldo; observe those things which in the second book of occult Philosophy aredirected concerning this thing. He that is desirous therefore to receive anOracle, let him abstain from supper and from drink, and be otherwise welldisposed, his brain being free from turbulent vapours; let him also have hisbed-chamber fair and clean, exorcised and consecrated if he will; then let himperfume the same with some convenient fumigation; and let him anoint histemples with some unguent efficacious hereunto, and put a ring upon his fin-ger, of the things above spoken of: let him take either some image, or holy"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy27tables or holy paper, and place the same under his head: then having made adevout prayer, let him go unto his bed, and meditating upon that thing whichhe desireth to know, let him so sleep; for so shall he receive a most certain andundoubted oracle by a dream, when the Moon goeth through that signewhich was in the ninth House of his nativity, and also when she goeththrough the signe of the ninth House of the Revolution of his nativity; andwhen she is in the ninth signe from the signe of perfection. And this is theway and means whereby we may obtain all Sciences and Arts whatsoever,suddenly and perfectly, with a true Illumination of our understanding;although all inferiour familiar Spirits whatsoever do conduce to this effect;and sometimes also evil Spirits sensibly informing us Intrinsecally or Extrin-secally.But if we would call any evil Spirit to the Circle, it first behoveth us toconsider, and to know his nature, to which of the Planets it agreeth, andwhat. Offices are distributed to him from that Planet; which being known, letthere be sought out a place fit and proper for his invocation, according to thenature of the Planet, and the quality of the Offices of the Said Spirit, as nearas the same maybe done: as, if their power be over the Sea, Rivers or Flouds,then let the place be chosen in the Shore; and so of the rest. Then let there bechosen a convenient time, both for the quality of the Air, serene, clear, quiet,and fitting for the Spirits to assume bodies; as also of the quality and natureof the Planet and of the Spirit, as to wit, on his day, or the time whereas heruleth: he may be fortunate or infortunate, sometimes of the day, and some-times of the night, as the Stars and Spirits do require. These things beingconsidered, let there be a Circle framed in the place elected, aswel for thedefence of the Invocant, as for the confirmation of the Spirit. And in the Circle it self there are to be written the divine general names,and those things which do yield defence unto us; and with them, those divinenames which do rule this Planet, and the offices of the Spirit himself; thereshall also be written therein, the names of the good Spirits which bear rule,and are able to binde and constrain that Spirit which we intend to call. And ifwe will any more fortifie and strengthen our Circle, we may adde Charactersand Pentacles agreeing to the work; then also if we will, we may either withinor without the Circle, frame an angular figure, with the inscription of suchconvenient numbers, as are congruent among themselves to our work; whichare also to be known, according to maner of numbers and figures: of which inthe second book of occult Philosophy it is sufficiently spoken.

Then when all these things are provided, and the Mas-ter and his fellows being in the Circle, in the first place let him consecrate theCircle, and all those things which he useth; which being performed with aconvenient gesture and countenance, let him begin to pray with a loud voiceafter this manner. First let him make an oration unto God, and then let himintreat the good Spirits: and if he wilt read any Prayers, Psalms, or Gospel forhis defence, they ought to take the first place. After these Prayers and Ora-tions are said, then let him begin to invocate the Spirit which he desireth,with a gentle and loving Inchantment, to all the coasts of the World, with thecommemoration of his own Authority and power. And then let him rest a lit-tle, looking about him; to see if any Spirit do appear; which if he delay, thenlet him repeat his invocation, as abovesaid, until he hath done it three times;and if the Spirit be pertinacious, obstinate, and will not appear, then let himbegin to conjure with divine power; so also that the conjurations and all hiscommemorations do agree with the Nature and Offices of the Spirit himself,and reiterate the same three times, from stronger to stronger, using Objurga-tions, Contumeries, Cursings, & Punishments, and suspension from hisOffice and power and the like.And after all the courses are finished, then cease a little; and if any Spiritshall appear, let the Invocant turn himself towards the Spirit, and courteouslyreceive him, and earnestly intreating him, let him first require his name, andif he be called by any other name: and then proceeding further, let him askhim whatsoever he will: and if in any thing the Spirit shall shew himselfobstinate or lying, let him be bound by convenient conjurations: and if youdoubt of any lye, make without the Circle with the consecrated Sword, thefigure of a triangle or *Pentagone, and compel the Spirit to enter into it and ifthou receivest any promise which thou wouldst have to be confirmed with anOath, let him stretch the sword out of the Circle, and swear the Spirit, bylaying his hand upon the Sword.

And when heis departed, go not out of the Circle, but make a stay, making prayer, and giv-ing of thanks unto God and the good Angels, and also praying for yourdefence and conservation: and then all those things being orderly performed,you may depart.But if your hope be frustrated, and no Spirits will appear, yet for this donot despair; but leaving the Circle, return again at other times, doing asbefore. And if you shall judge that you have erred in anything, then that youshall amend by adding or diminishing; for the constancy of Reiteration dothoften increase your authority and power and striketh terror into the Spirits,and humbleth them to obey.And therefore some use to make a Gate in the Circle whereby they may goin and out, which they open and shut as they please, and fortifie it with holyNames and Pentacles.This also we are to take notice of, That when no Spirits will appear, butthe Master being wearied hath determined to cease and give over; let him northerefore depart without licensing the Spirits: for they that do neglect this,are very greatly in danger, except they are fortified with some sublimedefence.Often times also the Spirits do come, although they appear not visible, (forto cause terror to him that calls them) either in the things which he useth orin the operation it self. But this kinde of licensing is not given simply, but bya kinde of dispensation with suspension, until in the following terms theyshall render themselves obedient. Also without a Circle these Spirits may becalled to appear, according to the way which is above delivered about the con-secration of a book.But when we do intend to execute any effect by evil Spirits, where anApparition is not needful; then that is to be done, by making and formingthat thing which is to be unto us as an instrument, or subject of the experi-ment it self; -as, whether it be an image, or a Ring, or a Writing, or anyCharacter, Candle, or Sacrifice, or any thing of the like sort: then the name ofthe Spirit is to be written therein, with his Character according to the exi-gency of the experiment, either by writing is with some blood, or otherwiseusing a perfume agreeable to the Spirit. Oftentimes also making Prayers andOrations to God and the good Angels before we invocate the evil Spirit, con-juring him by the divine power."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The fourth book30There is another kinde of Spirits, which we have spoken of in our thirdbook of Occult Philosophy, not so hurtful, and neerest unto men; so also, thatthey are effected with humane passions and do joy in the conversation ofmen, and freely do inhabit with them: and others do dwell in the Woods andDeserts: & others delight in the company of divers domestique Animals andwilde Beasts; and othersome do inhabit about Fountains and Meadows.Whosoever therefore would call up these kinde of Spirits, in the place wherethey abide, it ought to be done with odoriferous perfumes, and with sweetsounds and instruments of Musick, specially composed for the business, withusing of Songs, Inchantments and pleasant Verses, with praises and promises.But those which are obstinate to yield to these things, are to be compelledwith Threatenings, Comminations, Cursings, Delusions, Contumelies, andespecially by threatning them to expel them from those places where they areconversant.Further, if need be, thou maist betake thee to use Exorcismes; but thechiefest thing that ought to be observed, is, constancy of minde, and bold-ness, free, and alienated from fear.Lastly, when you would invocate these kinde of Spirits, you ought to pre-pare a Table in the place of invocation, covered with clean linen; whereuponyou shall set new bread, and running water or milk in new earthen vessels,and new knives. And you shall make a fire, whereupon a perfume shall bemade. But let the Invocant go unto the head of the Table, and round about itlet there be seats placed for the Spirits, as you please; and the Spirits beingcalled, you shall invite them to drink and eat. Bur if perchance you shall fearany evil Spirit, then draw a Circle about it, and let that part of the Table atwhich the Invocant sits, be within the Circle, and the rest of the Table With-out the Circle.In our third book of Occult Philosophy, we have taught how and by whatmeans the Soul is joyned to the Body; and, what hapeneth to the Soul afterdeath.Thou maist know further, That those Souls do still love their relinquishedBodies after death, as it were a certain affinity alluring them; such as are theSouls of noxious men, which have violently relinquished their Bodies, andSouls wanting a due burial, which do still wander in a liquid and turbulentSpirit about their dead carkasses; for these Souls by the known means bywhich heretofore they were conjoyned to their Bodies, by the like vapors,liquors, and favours, are easily drawn unto them."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"of Occult Philosophy31From hence it is, that the Souls of the dead are not to be called up withoutblood, or by the application of some part of their relict Body.In the raising up of these shadows, we are to perfume with new Blood,with the Bones of the dead, and with Flesh, Egges, Milk, Honey and Oile,and such-like things, which do attribute to the Souls a means apt to receivetheir Bodies.It, is also to be understood, That those who are desirous to raise up anySouls of the dead, they ought to do it in those places, wherein these kinde ofSouls are most known to be conversant, or for some alliance alluring thosesouls into their forsaken Body; or for some kinde of affection in times past,impressed in there in their life, drawing the said Soul to certain places,things, or persons; or for the forcible nature of some place fitted and preparedfor to purge or punish these Souls. Which places for the most part are to beknown by the experience of visions, mighty incursions, and apparitions, andsuch-like prodigies seen.Therefore the places most fitting for these things, are Churchyards. Andbetter then them, are those places wherein there is the execution of criminaljudgements. And better then these, are those places, in which of late yeersthere have been some publike slaughters of men. Furthermore, that place isbetter then there, where some dead carkass, that came by a violent death, isnot yet expiated, nor ritely buried, and was lately buried; for the expiation ofthose places, is also a holy Rite duly to be adhibited to the burial of the bod-ies, and oftentimes prohibiteth the souls to come unto their bodies, andexpelleth them far off unto the places of judgement. And from hence it is, That the Souls of the dead are not easily to be raisedup, except is be the Souls of them whom we know to be evil, or to have per-ished by a violent death, and whose bodies do want a right and due burial.Now although we have spoken concerning such places of this kinde, is willnot be safe or commodious to go unto them; but it behoveth us to take towhat place soever is to be chosen, some principal part of the body that isrelict, and therewith to make a perfume in due maner, and to perform othercompetent Rites.it is also to be known, That because the Souls are certain spiritual lights,therefore artificial lights, especially if they be framed out of certain competentthings, compounded according to a true rule, with congruent inscriptions ofNames and Seals, do very much avail to the raising up of departed Souls.Moreover, these things which now are spoken of, are not alwaies sufficientto raise up Souls, because of an extranatural portion of understanding and"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The fourth book32reason, which is above, and known onely to the Heaven and Destinies, andtheir power.We ought therefore to allure the said Souls, by supernatural and coelestialpowers duely administred, even by those things which do move the very har-mony of the Soul, aswel imaginative, as rational and intellectual; as areVoices, Songs, Sound, Inchantments: and Religious things; as Prayers, Con-jurations, Exorcismes, and other holy Rites, which may very commodiouslybe administred hereunto.The end of the fourth book of Agrippa."}]
