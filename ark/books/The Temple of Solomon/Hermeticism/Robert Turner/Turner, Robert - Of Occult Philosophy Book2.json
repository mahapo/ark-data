Then the wickedness of some Pulpit-sycophants, and of some School-Sophisters incessantly raging against me for adeclamation I put forth concerning the Vanity of things, and the excellency of the word of God, and contending against mecontinually with bitter hatred, envy, malice, and calumnies, hindered me from putting of it forth; whereof some very proudly,with a full mouth, and loud voice aspersed me with impiety in the Temple amongst a promiscuous people. Others withcorner-whisperings from house to house, street by street, did fill the ears of the ignorant with my infamy: others in publicke,and private assemblies did instigate Prelates, Princes, and Caesar himself against me. Hence I began to be at a stand,whether I should put forth the rest of the book or no, whilest I did doubt that I should by this means expose my self to greatercalumnies, and as it were cast my self out of the smoke into the fire, a certain rude fear seised [seized] upon me, least byputting them forth I should seem more offensive then officius to you, and expose your highness to the envy of maliciousCarpers, and tongues of detracters. Whilest these things troubled me with a various desparation, the quickness of yourunderstanding, exact discretion, uprightness of Judgement, Religion without superstition, and other most known vertues inyou, your authority, and integrity beyond exception, which can easily check, and bridle the tongues of slanderers, removedmy doubting, and inforced me to set upon that again more boldly, which I had almost left off by reaon of despaire. Therefore(most Illustrious Prince) take in good part this second book of Occult Philosophy, in which we shew the mysteries of theCelestiall Magick, all things being opened, and manifested, which experienced antiquity makes relation of, and which cameto my knowledge, that the secrets of Celestiall Magick (hitherto neglected, and not fully apprehended by men of latter times)may with your protection be by me, after the shewing of natural vertues, proposed to them that are studious, and curious ofthese secrets: by which let him that shall be profited and receive benefit, give you the thanks, who have been the occasion ofthis Edition, and setting of it at liberty to be seen abroad.Farewell.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Of the necessity of Mathematicall learning, and of the many wonderfullworks which are done by Mathematicall Arts only.The Doctrines of Mathematicks are so necessary to, and have such an affinity with Magick, that they that do profess itwithout them, are quite out of the way, and labour in vain, and shall in no wise obtain their desired effect. For whatsoeverthings are, and are done in these inferior naturall vertues, are all done, and governed by number, weight, measure, harmony,motion, and light. And all things which we see in these inferiours, have root, and foundation in them: yet neverthelesswithout naturall vertues, of Mathematicall Doctrines only works like to naturals can be produced, as Plato saith, a thing notpaataking of truth or divinity, but certain Images kin to them, as bodies going, or speaking, which yet want the Animallfaculty, such as were those which amongst the Ancients were called Dedalus his Images, and αυτοματα, of which Aristotlemakes mention, viz. the threefooted Images of Vulcan, and Dedalus, moving themselves, which Homer saith came out oftheir own accord to exercise, and which we read, moved themselves at the feast of Hiarba the Philosophicall Exerciser: Asalso that golden Statues performed the offices of Cup bearers, and Carvers to the guests. Also we read of the Statues ofMercury, which did speak, and the wooden Dove of Arthita, which did fly, and the miracles of Boethius, which Cassiodorusmade mention of, viz. Diomedes in Brass, sounding a Trumpet, and a brazen Snake hissing, and pictures of birds singing mostsweetly. Of this kind are those miracles of Images which proceed from Geometry, and Opticks, of which we made somemention in the first book, where we spoke of the Element of Aire, So there are made glasses, some Concave, others of theform of a Columne, making the representations of things in the Aire seem like shadows at a distance: of which sortApoilonius, and Vitellius in their Books De Perspectiva, and Speculis, taught the making, and the use. And we read thatMagnus Pompeius brought a certain glass amongst the spoils from the East, to Rome, in which were seen Armies of Armedmen. And there are made certain transparent glasses, which being dipped in some certain juices of Hearbs [herbs], andirradiated with an artificiall light, fill the whole Aire round about with visions. And I know how to make reciprocall glasses,in which the Sun shining, all things which were illustrated by the raies [rays] thereof are apparently seen many miles off.Hence a Magician, expert in naturall Philosophy, and Mathematicks, and knowing the middle sciences consisting of boththese, Arithmatick, Musick, Geometry, Opticks, Astronomie [astronomy], and such sciences that are of weights, measures,propertions, articles, and joynts, knowing also Mechanicall Arts resulting from these, may without any wonder, if he excellother men in Art, and wit, do many wonderfull things, which the most prudent, and wise men may much admire. Are therenot some reliques extant of the Ancients works, viz. Hercules, and Alexanders pillars, the gate of Caspia made of brass, andshut with Iron beams, that it could by no Wit or Art, be broken? And the Pyramis of Julius Caesar erected at Rome neer thehill Vaticanus, and Mountains built by Art in the middle of the Sea, and Towers, and heaps of Stones, such as I saw inEngland put together by an incredible Art. And we read in faithfull Historians, that in former times Rocks have been cut off,and Vallies [valleys] made, and Mountains made into a Plain, Rocks have been digged through, Promontories have beenopened in the Sea, the bowels of the Earth made hollow, Rivers divided, Seas joyned to Seas, the Seas restrained, the bottomeof the Sea been searched, Pools exhausted, Fens dryed up, new Islands made, and again restored to the continent, all which,Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Therefore they seeing any wonderfull sight, doimpute it to the divell, as his work, or think it is a miracle, which indeed is a work of naturall, or Mathematicall Philosophy.As if anyone should be ignorant of the vertue of the Loadstone, and should see heavy Iron drawn upwards, or hanged in theAire (as we read the Iron Image of Mercury did long since at Treveris hang up in the middle of the Temple by Loadstones,this verse attesting the same.The Iron white rod-bearer flies i'th' Aire.The like to which we read was done concerning the image of the Sun at Rome, in the Temple of Serapis) would not such anignorant man, I say, presently say it is the work of the divell? But if he shall know the vertue of the Loadstone to the Iron, andshall make triall of it, he presently ceaseth to wonder, and doth no more scruple it to be the work of nature. But here it isconvenient that you know, that as by naturall vertues we collect naturall vertues, so by abstracted, mathematicall, andcelestiall, we receive celestiall vertues, as motion, life, sense, speech, southsaying [soothsaying], and divination, even inmatter less disposed, as that which is not made by nature, but only by art. And so images that speak, and foretell things tocome, are said to be made, as William of Paris relates of a brazen head made under the rising of Saturn, which they say spakewith a mans voice. But he that will choose a disposed matter, and most fit to receive, and a most powerfull agent, shallundoubtedly produce more powerfull effects. For it is a generall opinion of the Pythagoreans, that as Mathematicall things aremore formall then Naturall, so also they are more efficacious: as they have less dependence in their being, so also in theiroperation. But amongst all Mathematicall things, numbers, as they have more of form in them, so also are more efficacious,to which not only Heathen Philosophers, but also Hebrew, and Christian Divines do attribute vertue, and efficacy, as well toeffect what is good, as what is bad.Chapter ii. Of Numbers, and of their power, and vertue.Severinus Boethius saith, that all things which were first made by the nature of things in its first Age, seem to be formed bythe proportion of numbers, for this was the principall pattern in the mind of the Creator. Hence is borrowed the number of theElements, hence the courses of times, hence the motion of the Stars, and the revolution of the heaven, and the state of allthings subsist by the uniting together of numbers. Numbers therefore are endowed with great and sublime vertues. For it is nowonder, seeing there are so many, and so great occult vertues in naturall things, although of manifest openations, that thereshould be in numbers much greater, and more occult, and also more wonderfull, and efficacious, for as much as they are moreformall, more perfect, and naturally in the celestialls, not mixt with separated substances; and lastly, having the greatest, andmost simple commixtion with the Idea's in the mind of God, from which they receive their proper, and most efficaciousvertues: wherefore also they are of more force, and conduce most to the obtaining of spirituall, and divine gifts, as in naturallthings, elementary qualities are powerfull in the transmuting of any elementary thing. Again, all things that are, and are made,subsist by, and receive their vertue from numbers. For time consists of number, and all motion, and action, and all thingswhich are subject to time, and motion.Harmony also, and voices have their power by, and consist of numbers, and their proportions, and the proportions arisingfrom numbers, do by lines, and points make Characters, and figures: And these are proper to Magicall operations, the middlewhich is betwixt both being appropriated by declining to the extreams, as in the use of letters. And lastly, all species ofnaturall things, and of those things which are above nature, are joyned together by certain numbers: which Pythagoras seeing,saith, that number is that by which all things consist, and distributes each vertue to each number. And Proclus saith, Numberhath alwaies a being: Yet there is one in voyce, another in the proportion of them, another in the soul, and reason, and anotherin divine things. But Themistius, and Boethius, and Averrois the Babilonian [Babylonian], together with Plato, do so extollnumbers, that they think no man can be a true Philosopher without them. Now they speak of a rationall, and formall number,not of a materiall, sensible, or vocall, the number of Merchants buying, and selling, of which the Pythagoreans, andPlatonists, and our Austin [Augustine] make no reckoning, but apply it to the proportion resulting from it, which number theycall naturall, rationall, and formall, from which great mysteries flow, as well in naturall, as divine, and heavenly things. By itis there a way made for the searching out, and understanding of all things knowable. By it the next access to naturallprophesying is had: and the Abbot Joachim proceeded no other way in his Prophecies, but by formall numbers.Chapter iii. How great vertues Numbers have, as well in Naturall things, as inSupernaturall.That there lyes [lies] wonderfull efficacy, and vertue in numbers, as well to good as to bad, not only most eminentPhilosophers do unanimously teach, but also Catholike [Catholic] Doctors, and especially Hierom, Austin [Augustine],Origen, Ambrose, Gregory of Nazianzen, Athanasius, Basilius, Hilarius, Rubanus, Bede, and many more confirm.

Rabanus also, a famous Doctor, composed an excellent book of the vertues of numbers: But now howgreat vertues numbers have in nature, is manifest in the hearb [herb] which is called Cinquefoil, i.e. five leaved Grass; for thisresists poysons [poisons] by vertue of the number of five; also drives away divells [devils], conduceth to expiation; and oneleafe of it taken twice in a day in wine, cures the Feaver [fever] of one day: three the tertian Feaver: foure the quartane. Inlike manner four grains of the seed of Turnisole being drunk, cures the quartane, but three the tertian. In like manner Vervin issaid to cure Feavers, being drunk in wine, if in tertians it be cut from the third joynt [joint], in quartans from the fourth. ASerpent, if he be once struck with a Spear, dieth, if twice, recovers strength. These and many such as these are read, andtestified in divers Authors. We must know now whence these are done, which certainly have a cause, which is a variousproportion of various numbers amongst themselves. There is also a wonderfull experiment of the number of seven, that everyseventh male, born without a female coming betwixt, hath power to cure the Kings evill by his touch alone, or word. Alsoevery seventh daughter that is born, is said wonderfully to help forward the birth of children: neither is the naturall numberhere considered, but the formall consideration that is in the number. And let that which we spake before, be alwaies kept inmind, viz. that these powers are not in vocall, or numbers of merchants buying, and selling, but in rationall, formall, andnaturall; These are distinct mysteries of God, and nature. But he that knows how to joyn [join] together the vocall numbers,and naturall with divine, and order them into the same harmony, shall be able to work and know wonderfull things bynumbers; the Pythagorians profess that they can prognosticate many things by the numbers of names, in which truly, unlessthere did ly [lie] a great mysterie [mystery], John had not said in the Revelation, He which hath understanding, let himcompute the number of the name of the beast, which is the number of a man, and this is the most famous manner ofcomputing amongst the Hebrews, and Cabalists, as we shall shew afterwards. But this you must know, that simple numberssignifie Divine things: numbers of ten; Celestiall numbers of an hundred; terrestriall numbers of a thousand; those things thatshall be in a future age. Besides, seeing the parts of the mind are according to an Arithmeticall Mediocrity, by reason of theidentity, or equality of excess, coupled together. But the body, whose parts differ in their greatness, is according to aGeometricall mediocrity, compounded: But an animall consists of both, viz. soul and body, according to that mediocrity,which is sutable [suitable] to harmony: Hence it is that numbers do work very much upon the soul, figures upon the body,and harmony upon the whole animall.Chapter iv. Of unity, and the Scale thereof.Now let us treat particularly of numbers themselves: and because number is nothing els [else] but a repetition of Unity, let usfirst consider Unity it self. For Unity doth most simply go through every number, and is the common measure, fountain, andoriginall of all numbers, contains every number joyned [joined] together in it self intirely, the beginner of every multitude,alwayes the same, and unchangable: whence also being multiplyed into it self, produceth nothing but it self: it is indivisible,void of all parts: But if it seem at any time to be divided, it is not cut, but indeed Multiplied into Unities: yet none of theseUnities is greater or lesser then the whole Unity, as a part is less than the whole: It is not therefore Multiplyed into parts, butinto it self: Therefore some called it concord, some piety, and some friendship, which is so knit, that it cannot be cut intoparts. But Martianus, according to the opinion of Aristotle saith, it is named Cupid, because it is made one alone, and willalwaies bewail it self, and beyond it self it hath nothing, but being void of all haughtiness, or coupling, turns its proper heatsinto it self. It is therefore the one beginning, and end of all things, neither hath it any beginning, or end it self: Nothing isbefore one, nothing is after one, and beyond it is nothing, and all things which are, desire that one, because all thingsproceeded from one, and that all things may be the same, it is necessary that they partake of that one: And as all thingsproceeded of one into many things, so all things endeavour to return to that one, from which they proceeded; it is necessarythat they should put off multitude. One therefore is referred to the high God, who seeing he is one, and innumerable, yetcreates innumerable things of himself, and contains them within himself. There is therefore one God, one world of the oneGod, one Sun of the one world, also one Phoenix in the World, one King [queen] amongst Bees, one Leader amongst Flocksof Catel [cattle], one Ruler amongst heards [herds] of Beasts, & Cranes follow one, and many other Animalls honour Unity;Amongst the Members of the body there is one Principal by which all the rest are guided, whether it be the head, or (as somewill) the heart. There is one Element overcoming, and penetrating all things, viz. Fire. There is one thing created of God, thesubject of all wondring [wondering], which is on Earth, or in Heaven, it is actually Animal, Vegetable, and Minerall, everywhere found, known by few, called by none by its proper name, but covered with figures, and Riddles, without which neitherAlchymie [alchemy], nor Naturall Magick, can attain to their compleat end, or perfection. From one man, Adam, all menproceed, from that one all become mortall, from that one Jesus Christ they are regenerated: and as saith Paul, one Lord, oneFaith, one Baptism, one God, and Father of all, one mediator betwixt God and man, one most high Creator, who is over all,by all, and in us all. For there is one Father, God, from whence all, and we in him: one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom all, andwe by him: one God Holy Ghost, into whom all, and we into him.The Scale of UnityHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Of the Number of Two, and the Scale thereof.The first Number is of two, because it is the first Multitude, it can be measured by no number besides unity alone, thecommon measure of all Numbers: It is not compounded of Numbers, but of one unity only; neither is it called a numberuncompounded, but more properly not compounded: The Number of three is called the first Number uncompounded: But theNumber of two is the first branch of unity, and the first procreation: Hence it is called generation, and Juno, and animaginable Corporation, the proof of the first motion, the first form of parity: the number of the first equality, extremity, anddistance betwixt, and therefore of peculiar equity, and the proper act thereof, because it consists of two equally poysed: and itis called the Number of Science, and Memory, and of light, and the number of man, who is called another, and the lesserWorld: it is also called the number of charity, and mutuall love, of marriage, and society, as it is said by the Lord, Two shallbe one flesh. And Solomon saith: It is better that two be together then one, for they have a benefit by their mutuall society: Ifone shall fall, he shall be supported by the other. Wo [woe] to him that is alone, because when he falls he hath not another tohelp him: and if two sleep together, they shall warm one the other; how shall one be hot alone? And if any prevaile againsthim, two resist him. And it is called the number of Wedlock and Sex; for there are two sexes, Masculine, and Feminine: andtwo Dovess bring forth two Eggs, out of the first of which is hatched the Male, out of the second the Female. It is also calledthe midle [middle], that is capable, that is good, and bad, partaking, and the beginning of division, of Multitude, anddistinction, and signifies matter. This is also sometimes the number of discord, and confusion, of misfortune, anduncleanness, whence Saint Hierom against Jovianus saith, that therefore it was not spoken in the second day of the creationof the world, and God said, That it was good, because the number of two is evill. Hence also it was, that God commandedthat all unclean Animals should go into the Ark by couples: because as I said, the number of two, is a number of uncleanness,and it is most unhappy in their Soothsayings, especially if those things, from whence the Soothsaying is taken, be Saturnall,or Martiall, for these two are accounted by the Astrologers unfortunate. It is also reported, that the number of two doth causeapparitions of Ghosts, and fearfull Goblins, and bring mischiefs of evill spirits to them that travell by night. Pythagoras (asEusebius reports) said, that Unity was God, and a good intellect; and that Duality was a Divell [devil], and an evill intellect,in which is a materiall multitude: wherefore the Pythagoreans say, that two is not a number, but a certain confusion ofunities. And Plutarke [Plutarch] writes, that the Pythagorians [Pythagoreans] called unity Apollo, and two, strife, andboldness; and three, Justice, which is the highest perfection, and is not without many mysteries. Hence there were two Tablesof the Law in Sina, two Cherubins looking to the Propitiatory in Moses, two Olives dropping oyle [oil], in Zachariah, twonatures in Christ, Divine, and Humane; Hence Moses saw two appearances of God, viz. his face, and back-parts, also twoTestaments, two commands of Love, two first dignities, two first people, two kinds of Spirits, good and bad, two intellectuallcreatures, an Angell, and soul, two great lights, two Solstitia [solstices], two equinoctials [equinoxes], two poles, twoElements, producing a living soul, viz.

Of the Number of three, and the Scale thereof.The number of three is an incompounded number, a holy number, a number of perfection, a most powerfull number. Forthere are three persons in God, there are three Theologicall vertues in Religion. Hence it is that this number conduceth to theCeremonies of God, and Religion, that by the solemnity of which, prayers, and sacrifices are thrice repeated. Whence Virgilsings,Odd numbers to the God delightfull are.And the Pythagorians use it in their sanctifications, and purifications, whence in Virgil,The same did cleanse, and wash with Water pureThrice his companions -----And it is most fit in bindings, or ligations, hence that of Virgil,----- I walk aroundFirst with these threads, which three, and severall are,'Bout th' Altar thrice I shall thy image bear.And a little after;Knots, Amaryllis, tye, of colours three,Then say, these bonds I knit, for Venus be.And we read of Medea.She spake three words, which caus'd sweet sleep at will,The troubled Sea, the raging Waves stand still.And in Pliny it was the cusome in every medicine to spit with three deprecations, and hence to be cured. The number of theeis perfected with three Augmentations, long, broad, and deep, beyond which there is no progression of dimension, whence thefirst number is called square. Hence it is said that to a body that hath three measures, and to a square number, nothing can beadded. Wherefore Aristotle in the beginning of his speeches concerning Heaven, cals it as it were a Law, according to whichall things are disposed. For Corporeall, and spirituall things consist of three things, viz. beginning, middle, and end. By three(as Tresmegistus [Trismegistus] saith) the world is perfected: Hemarmene {so the L}, necessity, and order (i.e.) concurrenceof causes, which many call fate, and the execution of them to the fruit, or increase, and a due distribution of the increase. Thewhole measure of time is concluded in three, viz. Past, present, to come; All magnitude is contained in three; line, superficies,and body, every body consists of three Intervals, length, bredth [breadth], thickness. Harmony contains three consents intime, Diapason, Hemiolion, Diatessaron. There are three kinds of souls, Vegetative, sensitive, and intellectuall. And as saiththe Prophet, God orders the world by number, weight, and measure, and the number of three is deputed to the Ideall formsthereof, as the number two is to the procreating matter, and unity to God the maker of it. Magicians do constitute threePrinces of the world, Oromasis, Mitris, Araminis [i.e. Ohrmazd (Av. Ahura Mazda), Mithra, and Ahriman (Av. AnghraMainyu). In Zoroastrian theology, these are the names for God, the highest angel, and the Devil respectively.] (i.e.) God, theMind, and the Spirit. By the three square or solid, the three numbers of nine of things produced are distributed, viz. of thesupercelestiall into nine orders of Intelligencies: of Celestiall into nine Orbs: of inferiours into nine kinds of generable, andcorruptible things. Lastly in this ternall Orb, viz. twenty seven, all Musical proportions are included, as Plato, and Proclus, doat large discourse. And the number of three hath in a harmony of five, the grace of the first voyce. Also in Intelligencies thereare three Hierarchies of Angelicall spirits. There are three powers of Intellectuall creatures, memory, mind, and will. Thereare three orders of the blessed, viz. of Martyrs, Confessors, and Innocents. There are three quaternions of Celestiall Signs, viz.Of fixt [fixed], moveable, and common, as also of houses, viz. centers, succeeding, and falling. There are also three faces, andheads in every Sign, and three Lords of each triplicity. There are three fortunes amongst the Planets. Three graces amongstthe Goddesses. Three Ladies of destiny amongst the infernall crew. Three Judges. Three furies. Three-headed Cerberus. Weread also of a thrice double Hecate. Three moneths [L: ora = mouths] of the virgin Diana.

Of the Number of Four, and the Scale thereof.The Pythagorians call the Number of four Tetractis, and prefer it before all the vertues of Numbers, because it is thefoundation, and root of all other numbers; whence also all foundations, as well in artificiall things, as naturall, and divine, arefour square, as we shall shew afterwards: and it signifies solidity, which also is demonstrated by a four square figure. For thenumber four is the first four square plain, which consists of two proportions, whereof the first is of one to two, the latter oftwo to four, and it proceeds by a double procession and proportion, viz. of one to one, and of two to two, beginning at a unity,and ending at a quaternity: which proportions differ in this, that according to Arithmatick [arithematic], they are unequall toone the other: but according to Geometry are equall. Therefore a four square is ascribed to God the Father, and also containsthe mysterie [mystery] of the whole Trinity: for by its single proportion, viz. by the first of one to one, the unity of thepaternall substance is signified, from which proceeds one Son, equall to him; by the next procession, also simple, viz. of twoto two, is signified by the second procession the Holy Ghost from both, that the Son be equall to the Father by the firstprocession; and the Holy Ghost be equall to both by the second procession. Hence that superexcellent, and great name of thedivine Trinity of God is written with four letters, viz. Yod, He, and Vau; He, where it is the aspiration He, signifies theproceeding of the spirit from both: for He being duplicated, terminates both syllables, and the whole name, but is pronouncedJova, as some will, whence that Jovis of the heathen, which the Ancients did picture with four ears, whence the number fouris the fountain, and head of the whole divinity. And the Pythagorians [Pythagoreans] call it the perpetuall fountain of nature:for there are four degrees in the Scale of nature, viz. to be, to live, to be sensible, to understand. There are four motions innature, viz. ascendent, descendent, going forward, circular. There are four Corners in the heaven, viz. rising, falling, the midle[middle] of the heaven, and the bottome of it. There are four Elements under Heaven, viz. Fire, Aire, Water, and Earth;according to these there are four triplicities in Heaven: There are four first qualities under the Heaven, viz. Cold, Heat,Driness [dryness], and Moystness [moistness], from these are the four Humours, Blood, Flegm [phlegm], Choller [choler],Melancholy. Also the year is divided into four parts, which are Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter; also the wind isdivided into Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern. There are also four rivers of Paradise, and so many infernall. Also thenumber four makes up all knowledge: first it fills up every simple progress of numbers with four termes, viz. with one, two,three, and four, constituting the number ten. It fills up every difference of numbers, the first even, and conteining the first oddin it. It hath in Musick Diatessaron, the grace of the fourth voice. Also it conteins the instrument of four strings, and aPythagorean Diagram, whereby are found out first of all musicall tunes, and all harmony of Musick.

It doth also contein the whole of Mathematicks in four terms,viz. point, line, superficies, and profundity. It comprehends all natute in four terms, viz. substance, quality, quantity, andmotion. Also all naturall Phylosophy [philosophy], in which are the seminary vertues of nature, the naturall springing, thegrowing form, and the compositum. Also Metaphysick is comprehended in four bounds, viz. being, essence, vertue, andaction. Morall Phylosophy is comprehended with four vertues, viz. prudence, justice, fortitude, temperence. It hath also thepower of justice: hence a fourfold law: of providence from God; fatall, from the soul of the world: of nature from Heaven: ofprudence, from man. There are also four judiciary powers in all things being, viz. the intellect, discipline, opinion, and sense.It hath also great power in all mysteries. Hence the Pythagoreans did ratifie [ratify] the number four with an oath, as if it werethe cheifest [chiefest] ground whereon their faith was grounded, and their belief might be confirmed. Hence it was called thePythagorians oath, which is expressed in these verses.I with pure minde by th' number four do swearThat's holy, and the fountain of natureEternall, parent of the mind -----Also there are four rivers of Paradise; four Gospels received from four Evangalists throughout the whole Church. TheHebrews received the cheifest [chiefest] name of God written with four letters. Also the Egyptians, Arabians, Persians,Magicians, Mahumitans, Grecians, Tuscans, Latines, write the name of God with only four letters, viz. thus, Theut, Alla, Sire,Orsi, Abdi, θεοζ [theos], Esar, Deus. Hence the Lacedemonians were wont to paint Jupiter with four wings. Hence also inOrpheus his divinity, it is said that Neptunes Chariots are drawn with four horses. There are also four kinds of divine furies,proceeding from severall deities, viz. from the Muses, Dionysius, Apollo, and Venus. Also the Prophet Ezekiel saw four beastsby the river Chobar, and four Cherubims in four wheels. Also in Daniel, four great beasts did ascend from the Sea, and fourwinds did fight. And in the Revelations four beasts were full of eyes, before, and behind: standing round about the Throne ofGod, and four Angels, to whom was given power to hurt the Earth, and the Sea, did stand upon the four corners of the Earth,holding the four winds, that they should not blow upon the Earth, nor upon the Sea, nor upon any Tree.The Scale of the Number four, answering the four Elements.The name of Godwith four letters.äåäéIn the Originallworld, whence theLaw ofprovidence.Four Triplicities orintelligibleHierarchies.Seraphim.Cherubin.Thrones.Dominations.Powers.Vertues.Principalities.Archangels.Angels.Innicents.Martyrs.Confessors.In the Intellectualworld, whence thefatall Law.Four Angels rulingover the corners ofthe world.ìàëéîMichael.ìàôøRaphael.ìàéøáâGabriel.ìàéøåàUriel.Four rulers of theElements.ôøùSeraph.áåøëCherub.ùéùøúTharsis.ìàéøàAriel.Four consecratedAnimals.The Lion.The Eagle.Man.A Calf.Four Triplicities ofthe tribes of Israel.Dan.Asser.Nephtalim.Jehuda.Isachar.Zabulum [Zabulon].Manasse.Benjamin.Ephraim.Reubin [Ruben].Simeon [Simehon].Gad.Four Triplicities ofApostles.Mathias.Peter.Jacob the elder.Simon.Bartholemew.Mathew.John.Phillip.James the younger.Thaddeus.Andrew.Thomas.Four Evangelists.Mark.John.Mathew.Luke.Four Triplicities ofSigns.Aries.Leo.Sagittarius.Gemini.Libra.Aquarius.Cancer.Scorpius.Pisces.Taurus.Virgo.Capricornus.In the Celestiallworld, where is thelaw of nature.The Stars, andPlanets, related tothe Elements.Mars, and theSun.Jupiter, and Venus.Saturn, and Mercury.The fixt Stars, andthe Moon.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Of the Number Five, and the Scale thereof.The number five is of no small force, for it consists of the first even, and the first odd, as of a Female, and Male; For an oddnumber is the Male, and the even the Female. Whence Arithmeticians call that the Father, and this the Mother. Therefore thenumber five is of no small perfection, or vertue, which proceeds from the mixtion of these numbers: It is also the just midle[middle] of the universal number, viz. ten. For if you divide the number ten, there will be nine and one, or eight and two, orseven and three, or six and four, and every collection makes the number ten, and the exact midle [middle] alwaies is thenumber five, and its equidistant; and therefore it is called by the Pythagoreans the number of Wedlock, as also of justice,because it divides the number ten in an even Scale.

The Swallow brings forth but five young, which she feeds with equity, beginning with the eldest, andso the rest, according to their age. Also this number hath great power in expiations: For in holy things it drives away Divels[devils]. In naturall things, it expels poysons [poisons].

It is also called the number of man, because the sixt day man was created: and it is also the number ofour redemption, for the sixt day Christ suffered for our redemption: whence there is a great affinity betwixt the number sixand the Cross, labour, and servitude: hence it is commanded in the Law, that in six days the work is to be done, six daysManna is to be gathered, six years the ground was to be sown, and that the Hebrew servant should serve his Master six years;six days the glory of the Lord appeared upon Mount Sina [Sinai], covering it with a cloud: the Cherubins had six wings, 6circles in the Firmament, Artick, Antartick, two Tropicks, Equinoctiall, & Eclipticall, six wandring [wandering] Planets,Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, running through the latitude of the Zodiack, on both sides the Eclyptick[ecliptic].

Of the Number Seaven, and the Scale thereof.The number seaven [seven] is of various, and manifold power, for it consists of one, and six, or of two, and five, or of threeand four, and it hath a Unity, as it were the coupling together of two threes: whence if we consider the severall parts thereof,and the joyning together of them, without doubt we shall confess that it is as well by the joyning together of the parts thereof,as by its fullness apart, most full of all Majesty. And the Pythagorians call it the Vehiculum of mans life, which it doth notreceive from its parts so, as it perfects by its proper right of its whole, for it contains body, and soul, for the body consists offour Elements, and is endowed with four qualities: Also the number three respects the soul, by reason of its threefold power,viz. rationall, irascible, and concupiscible. The number seaven therefore, because it consists of three, and four, joyns the soulto the body, and the vertue of this number relates to the generation of men, and it causeth man to be received, formed,brought forth, nourished, live, and indeed altogether to subsist. For when the genitall seed is received in the womb of thewoman, if it remain there seaven hours after the effusion of it, it is certain that it will abide there for good: Then the firstseaven daye it is coagulated, and is fit to receive the shape of a man: then it produceth mature infants, which are called infantsof the seaventh moneth [month], i.e. because they are born the seaventh moneth. After the birth, the seaventh hour tryeswhether it will live or no: for that which shall bear the breath of the aire after that hour is conceived will live. After seavendayes it casts off the reliques of the Navell.After twice seaven dayes its sight begins to move after the light: in the third seaventh it turns its eyes, and whole face freely.After seaven moneths it breeds teeth: After the second seaventh moneth it sits without fear of falling: After the third seaventhmoneth it begins to speak: After the fourth seaventh moneth it stands strongly, and walks: after the fifth seaventh moneth itHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

But when they come to the tenth seaventh year, where the number seaven is taken for acompleat number, then they come to the common tearm of life, the Prophet saying, Our age is seaventy years. The utmosthight [height] of mans body is seaven feet. There are also seaven degrees in the body, which compleat the dimension of itsaltitude from the bottome to the top, viz. marrow, bone, nerve, vein, artery, flesh, skin. There are seaven, which by the Greeksare called black members, the Tongue, the Heart, the Lunges, the Liver, the Spleen, and two Kidnies [kidneys]. There are alsoseaven principal parts of the body, the head, the breast, the hands, the feet, and the privy members. It is manifest concerningbreath, and meat, that without drawing of the breath the life doth not endure above seaven hours: and they that are starvedwith famine, live not above seaven dayes. The Veins also, and arteries (as Physicians say) are moved by the seaventhnumber. Also judgements in diseases are made with greater manifestation upon the seaventh dayes, which Physitians[physicians] call criticall, i.e. judiciall. Also of seaven portions God Creates the soul, as divine Plato witnesseth in Timeus[Timaeus]. The soul also receives the body by seaven degrees. All difference of voices proceeds to the seaventh degree, afterwhich there is the same revolution. Again, there are seaven modulations of the voyces, Ditonus, Semiditonus, Diutessaron,Diapente with a tone [lat: semitone], Diapente with a half time [lat: semitone], and diapason. There is also in Celestials amost potent power of the number seven. For seeing there are four corners of the Heaven Diametrically looking one towardsthe other, which indeed is accounted a most full, and powerfull aspect, and consists of the number seven. For it is made fromthe seventh Sign, and makes a Cross, the most powerfull figure of all, of which we shall speak in its due place. But this youmust not be ignorant of, that the number seven hath a great Communion with the Cross. By the same radiation, and numberthe solstice is distant from Winter, and the Winter equinoctium from the Summer, all which are done by seven Signs. Thereare also seven Circles in the Heaven, according to the longitudes of the Axel-tree. There are seven Stars about the Articke[Arctic] Pole, greater, and lesser, called Charls-Wain, also seven Stars called the Pleiades, and seven Planets, according tothose seven dayes, constituting a week. The Moon is the seventh of the Planets & next to us observing this number more thenthe rest, this number dispensing the mofion, and light thereof. For in twenty eight dayes it runs round the Compass of thewhole Zodiack, which number of dayes, the number seven, with its seven tearms, viz. from one to seven, doth make, and fillup, as much as the several numbers, by adding to the Antecedents, and makes four times seven dayes, in which the Moonruns through, and about all the longitude, and latitude of the Zodiack by measuring, and measuring again: with the like sevenof dayes it dispenseth its light, by changing it; For the first seven dayes unto the middle as it were of the divided world, itincreaseth; the second seven dayes it fils [fills] its whole Orb with light; the third by decreasing is again contracted into adivided Orb; but after the fourth seven dayes, it is renewed with the last diminuafion of its light, and by the same seven ofdayes it disposeth the increase, and decrease of the Sea, for in the first seven of the increase of the Moon, it is by littlelessened; in the second by degrees increased: but the third is like the first, and the fourth doth the sure as the second. It is alsoapplyed to Saturn, which ascending from the lower, is the seventh Planet, which betokens rest, to which the seventh day isascribed, which signifies the seven thousandth, wherein (as John witnesseth) the Dragon, which is the Divell [Devil], andSatan, being bound, men shall be quiet, and lead a peaceable life. Moreover the Phythagorians [Pythagoreans] call seven thenumber of Virginity, because the first is that which is neither generated, or generates, neither can it be divided into two equallparts, so as to be generated of another number repeated, or being doubled to bring forth any other number of it self, which iscontained within the bounds of the number ten, which is manifestly the first bound of numbers, and therefore they dedicatethe number seven to Pallas. It hath also in Religion most potent signs of its esteem, and it is called the number of an oath.Hence amongst the Hebrews to swear is called Septenare (i.e.) to protest by seven. So Abraham, when he made a covenantwith Abimelech, appointed seven Ewe Lambs for a testimony. It is also called the number of blessedness, or of rest, whencethat,O thrice, and four times blessed!viz. in soul, and body. The seventh day the Creator rested from his work, wherefore this day was by Moses called the Sabbath(i.e.) the day of rest; hence it was that Christ rested the seventh day in the grave. Also this number hath a great communionwith the Cross, as is above shewed, as also with Christ. For in Christ is all our blessedness, rest, and felicity; besides, it ismost convenient in purifications. whence Apuleius saith, and I put myself forthwith into the bath of the Sea, to be purified,and put my head seven times under the Waves. And the Leprous person that was to be cleansed, was sprinkled seven timeswith the blood of a Sparrow; and Elisha the Prophet, as it is written in the Second Book of the Kings, saith unto the Leprousperson; Go, and wash thy self seven times in Jordan, and thy flesh shall be made whole, and thou shalt be cleansed, and itfollows a little after, And he washed himself seven times in Jordan, according to the Prophets saying, and he was cleansed.Also it is a number of repentance, and remission: Hence was ordeined the seaventh years repentance for every sin, accordingto the opinion of the wise man, saying, And upon every sinner seaven fold: Also the seaventh year there were grantedremissions, and after full seaven years there was giving a full remission, as is read in Leviticus. And Christ with seavenpetitions finished his speech of our satisfaction: hence also it is called the number of liberty, because the seaventh year theHebrew servant did challenge liberty for himself. It is also most sutable to divine praises. Whence the Prophet saith, SeavenHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy. Book II.

It is moreover called the number of revenge, as saith theScripture, and Cain shall be revenged seaven fold. And the Psalmist saith, Render unto our Neighbours seaven fold into theirbosome, their reproach. Hence there are seaven wickednesses, as saith Solomon, and seaven wickeder spirits taken, are readof in the Gospel. It signifies also the time of the present circle, because it is finished in the space of seaven days. Also it isconsecrated to the Holy Ghost, which the Prophet Isaiah describes to be seaven fold, according to his gifts, viz. the spirit ofwisdom, and understanding, the spirit of counsell, and strength, the spirit of knowledge, and holiness, and the spirit of thefear of the Lord, which we read in Zachariah to be the seaven eyes of God. There are also seaven Angells, spirits standing inthe presence of God, as is read in Tobias, and in the Revelation; seaven Kamps did burn before the Throne of God, andseaven golden Candlesticks, and in the midle thereof was one like to the son of man, and he had in his right hand seavenStars. Also there were seaven spirits before the Throne of God, and seaven Angells stood before the Throne, and there weregiven to them seaven Trumpets. And he saw a Lamb having seaven horns, and seaven eyes, and he saw the book sealed withseaven Seales, and when the seaventh seal was opened, there was made silence in heaven. Now by all what hath been said, itis apparent that the number seaven, amongst the other numbers, may deservedly be said to be most full of all efficacy.Moreover, the number seaven hath great conformity with the number twelve; For as three, and four make seaven, so thricefour make twelve, which are the numbers of the celestiall Planets, and signs, resulting from the same root, and by the numberfour of the nature of inferiour things. There is in sacred writ a very great observance of this number, before all others, andmany, and very great are the mysteries thereof; many we have decreed to reckon up here, repeating them out of holy writ, bywhich it will easily appear, that the number seaven doth signifie a certain fulness of sacred mysteries. For we read in Genesis,that the seaventh was the day of the rest of the Lord; & Enoch, a pious, holy man, was the seaventh from Adam, and that therewas another seaventh man from Adam, a wicked man, by name Lamech, that had two wives; and that the sin of Cain shouldbe abolished the seaventh generation: As it is written, Cain shall be punished seaven fold: and he that shall slay Cain, shall berevenged seaven fold, to which the Master of the History collects, that there were seaven sins of Cain. Also of all clean beastsseaven, and seaven were brought into the Ark, as also of Fowles: And after seaven days the Lord rained upon the Earth, andupon the seaventh day the fountains of the deep were broken up, and the waters covered the Earth. Also Abraham gave toAbimelech seaven Ewe Lambs: and Jacob served seaven years for Leah, and seaven more for Rachael: and seaven dayes thepeople of Israel bewailed the death of Jacob. Moreover, we read in the same place, of seaven Kine, and seaven Ears of Corn,seaven years of plenty, and seaven years of scarcity. And in Exodus, the Sabboth of Sabboths, the holy rest to the Lord, iscommanded to be on the seaventh day. Also on the seaventh day Moses ceased to pray. On the seaventh day there shall be asolemnity of the Lord, the seaventh year the servant shall go out free: seaven dayes let the Calf, and the Lamb be with itsdamm; the seaventh year let the ground that hath been sown six years, be at rest: the seaventh day shall be a holy Sabboth,and a rest: the seaventh day, because it is the Sabboth, shall be called holy. In Leviticus the seaventh day also shall be moreobserved, and be more holy: and the first day of the seaventh moneth shall be a Sabboth of memoriall. Seaven dayes shall thesacrifices be offered to the Lord, seaven dayes shall the holy dayes of the Lord be celebrated, seaven dayes in a yeareverlastingly in the generations. In the seaventh moneth you shall celebrate feasts, and shall dwell in Tabernacles seavendayes: seaven times he shall sprinkle himself before the Lord, that hath dipped his finger in blood: he that is cleansed fromthe Leprosy, shall dip seaven times in the blood of a sparrow: seaven days shall she be washed with running water, that ismenstruous: seaven times he shall dip his finger in the blood of a bullock: seaven times I will smite you for your sins: InDeuteronomy seaven people possessed the Land of promise. There is also read of a seaventh year of remission, and seavenCandles set up on the South side of the Candlesticks. And in Numbers it is read, that the sons of Israel offered up seaven EweLambs without spot, and that seaven dayes they did eat unleavened bread, and that sin was expiated with seaven Lambs, & aGoat, and that the seaventh day was celebrated, and holy, and the first day of the seaventh moneth was observed, and keptholy, and the seaventh moneth of the feast of Tabernacles, & sseven Calves were offered on the seaventh day, and Baalamerected seaven Altars; seaven dayes Mary the sister of Aaron went forth leprous out of the Camp, seaven dayes he thattouched a dead carkass [carcass] was unclean. And in Joshua seaven priests carried the Ark of the Covenant before the Host,and seaven dayes they went round the Cities, and seaven trumpets were carried by the seaven Priests, and on the seaventh daythe seaven Priests sounded the Trumpets. And in the book of Judges, Abessa raigned [reigned] in Israel seaven years,Sampson kept his nuptialls seaven dayes, and the seaventh day he put forth a Riddle to his wife, he was bound with seavengreen [i.e. fresh] withs [nerviceis = sinews i.e. bowstrings, cf. Judges 16:8], seaven locks of his head were shaved off, seavenyears were the children of Israel oppressed by the King of Maden [Madian] And in the books of the Kings, Elias prayedseaven times, and at the seaventh time, behold a little cloud! seaven dayes the children of Israel pitched over against theSyrians, and in the seaventh day the battell [battle] was joyned: seaven years famine was threatened to David for the peoplesmurmuring; and seaven times the child sneesed [sneezed], that was raised [resuscitated] by Elisha, [cf. II Kings 4:35] andseaven men were crucified together in the dayes of the first harvest. Naaman was made clean with seaven washings byElisha, the seaventh moneth Golias was slain. And in Hester we read, that the King of Persia had three Eunuchs: and inTobias seaven men were coupled [copulati] with Sara the daughter of Raguel: And in Daniel Nebucadnezzars Furnace washeated seaven times hotter then it was used to be, and seaven Lions were in the den, and the seaventh day cameNebucadnezzar. In the book of Job there is made mention of seaven sons of Job, and seaven dayes and nights Jobs friendssate with him on the Earth; and in the same place, In seaven troubles no evill shall touch thee. In Ezra we read of Artaxerxeshis seaven counsellers: and in the same place the trumpet sounded: the seaventh moneth of the feast of tabernacles were inEzraes time, whilest the children of Israel were in the Cities: and on the first day of the seaventh moneth Esdras read the LawHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

And in the Psalmes David praised the Lord seaven times in a day: silver is tryed seaven times; and he rendersto our neighbours seaven fold into their bosomes. And Solomon saith, that wisdom hath hewen her self seaven Pillars; seavenmen that can render a reason, seaven abominations which the Lord abhors, seaven abominations in the heart of an enemy,seaven overseers, seaven eyes beholding. Isaiah numbers up seaven gifts of the Holy Ghost, and seaven women shall takehold on a man. And in Jeremiah, she that hath born seaven, languisheth, she hath given up the ghost. In Ezekiel, the Prophetcontinued sad for seaven dayes. In Zechariah seaven lamps, and seaven pipes to those seaven lamps, and seaven eyes runningto and fro throughout the whole Earth, and seaven eyes upon one stone, and the fast of the seaventh day is turned into joy.And in Micah, seaven shepherds are raised against the Assyrians. Also in the Gospel we read of seaven blessednesses, andseaven vertues, to which seaven vices are opposed; seaven petitions of the Lords prayer, seaven words of Christ upon thecross, seaven words of the blessed Virgin Mary, seaven loaves distributed by the Lord, seaven baskets of fragments, seavenbrothers having one wife, seaven disciples of the Lord that were fishers, seaven water pots in Cana of Galile [Galilee],seaven woes which the Lord threatens to the Hypocrites, seaven divels [devils] cast out of the unclean woman, and seavenwickeder divells [devils] taken in after that which was cast out. Also seaven years Christ was fled into Egypt; and theseaventh hour the Fevour [fever] left the Governors son. And in the Canonicall Epistles, James describes seaven degrees ofwisdom, and Peter seaven degrees of Vertues. And in the Acts are reckoned seaven Deacons, and seaven disciples chosen bythe Apostles. Also in the Revelations there are many mysteries of this number: for there we read of seaven Candlesticks,seaven Stars, seaven Crowns, seaven Churches, seaven Spirits before the Throne, seaven Rivers of Egypt, seaven Seales,seaven Markes, seaven Horns, seaven Eyes, seaven Spirits of God, seaven Angels with seaven Trumpets, seaven horns of theDragon, seaven heads of the Dragon, who had seaven Diadems: also seaven plagues, and seaven Vials, which were given toone of the seaven Angells, seaven heads of the scarlet Beast, seaven Mountains, and seaven Kings sitting upon them, andseaven thunders uttered their voyces. Moreover this number hath much power, as in natural, so in sacred, Ceremoniall, andalso in other things: therefore the seaven days are related hither, also the seaven Planets, the seaven, Stars called Pleiades, theseaven Ages of the World, the seaven changes of man, the seaven liberall Arts, and so many mechanick, and so manyforbidden, seaven Colours, seaven Metalls, seaven holes in the head of a man, seaven pair of nerves, seaven Mountains in theCity of Rome, seaven Romane Kings, seaven Civill Wars, seaven wise men in the time of Jeremiah the Prophet, and seavenwise men of Greece. Also Rome did burn seaven days by Nero. By seaven Kings were slain ten thousand Martyrs. Therewere seaven sleepers, seaven principall Churches of Rome, and so many Monasteries did Gregory build: So many sons SaintFelicity brought forth: there were seaven Electors of the Empire appointed, and seaven solemn Acts in crowning theEmperour; the Laws in the Testament require seaven witnesses, there are seaven civill punishments, and seaven canonicall,and seaven canonicall hours, the priest makes seaven obeysances in the Mass; seaven Sacraments, and seaven orders of theClergy, and a boy of seaven years may be ordained by the lesser, and may obtein a benefice sine Cura.

Of the number Eight, and the Scale thereof.The Pythagoreans call eight the number of justice, and fulness: first, because it is first of all divided into numbers equallyeven, viz. into four, and that division is by the same reason made into twice two, viz. by twice two twice; and by reason of thisequality of division, it took to it self the name of justice, but the other received the name, viz. of fulness, by reason of thecontexture of the corporeall solidity, since the first makes a solid body. Hence that custome of Orpheus, swearing by eightdieties [deities], if at any time he would beseech divine justice, whose names are these. Fire, Water, Earth, the Heaven,Moon, Sun, Phanes, the Night. There are also only eight visible Spheres of the heavens: also by it the property of corporeallnature is signified, which Orpheus comprehends in eight of his Sea songs. This is also called the covenant of circumcision,which was commanded to be done by the Jewes the eight day.There were also in the old Law eight ornaments of the Priest, viz. a breast-plate, a coat, a girdle, a myter [miter], a robe, anEphod, a girdle of the Ephod, a golden plate; hither\\ belongs the number to eternity, and the end of the world, because itfollows the number seven, which is the mysterie [mystery] of time: hence also the number of blessedness; for Christ teachethso many degrees of blessednesses, as you may see in Matthew: It is also called the number of safety, and conservation, forthere were so many souls of the sons of Jesse, from which David was the eighth.

Of the Number Nine, and the Scale thereof.The number nine is dedicated to the Muses, by the help of the order of the Celestiall Spheres, and divine spirits: Hence there are nine movable Spheres, and according to those there are nine Muses, viz. Calliope, Urania, Polymnia, Terpsichore, Clio,Melpomene, Erato, Euterpe, Thalia, which nine Muses indeed are appropriated to the nine Spheres, so that the first resembles the supreme Sphere, which they call Primum mobile, and so descending by degrees, according to the written order, unto thelast, which resembles the Sphere of the Moon, so, viz. Calliope is appropriated to the Primum mobile; Urania to the Starry Heaven, Polymnia to Saturn, Terpsichore, to Jupiter, Cleo to Mars, Melpomene to the Sun, Erato to Venus, Euterpe to Mercury,Thalia to the Moon.There are also nine orders of blessed Angels, viz. Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, Powers, Vertues, Principallities, Archangels, Angels, which Ezekiel figures out of nine Stones, which are the Saphir, Emrald [sapphire, emerald],Carbuncle, Berill [beryl], Onyx, Chrysolite, Jasper, Topaze, Sardis: This number hath also a great, and Occult mysterie of the Cross: For the ninth hour our Lord Jesus Christ breathed out his Spirit. And in nine dayes the Ancients buryed [buried] theirdead, and in so many yeers [years] they say Minea received Laws from Jupiter in a Cave; whence this number was most especially taken notice of by Homer, when Laws were to be given, or answers were to be given, or the sword was like to rage.The Astrologers also take notice of the number nine in the Ages of men, no otherwise then they do of seven, which they call Climactericall years, which are eminent for some remarkable change. Yet sometimes it signifies imperfectness, andincompleatness, because it doth not attain to the perfection of the number ten, but is less by one, without which it is deficient, as Austin [Augustine] interprets it out of the ten Leapers [leper]: Neither is the longitude of nine Cubits of Og King of Basan,who is a type of the divel [Devil], without a mysterie [mystery].The Scale of the Number nine.The names of God withnine letters.Jehovah Sabaoth. úåàáö äåäé Jehovah Zidkenu. åð÷ãö äåäé Elohim Gibor. øáéâ íéäìàIn the originall world.Nine Quires of Angels.Nine Angels ruling theHeavens.Seraphim.Metattron [Metatron].Cherubin.Ophaniel.Thrones.Zaphkiel.Dominations.Zadkiel.Powers.Camael.Vertue.Raphael.Principalities.Haniel.Archangels.Michael.Angels.Gabriel.In the intelligibleworld.Nine moveable spheres.The primum mobile.The Starry Heaven.The sphere of Saturn.The sphere of Jupiter.The sphere ofMars.The sphere of theSun.The sphere of Venus.The sphere ofMercury.The sphere of theMoon.In the Celestial world.Nine stonesrepresenting the nineQuires of Angels.Saphir [saphire]Emrald [emerald].Carbuncle.Beril [beryl]Onyx.Chrysolite.Jasper.Topaze.Sardis.In the Elementaryworld.Nine senses inward,and outward together.Memory.Cogitative.Imaginative.Common sense.Hearing.Seeing.Smelling.Tasting.Touching.In the lesser world.Nine orders of divels[devils].False spirits.Spirits of lying.Vessels of iniquity.Avengers of wickedness.Juglers.Aiery powers.Furies, sowing mischief.Sisters or tryers.Tempters orinsnarers.In the infernal world.Chapter xiii. Of the Number Ten, and the Scale thereof.The number ten is called every number, or an universall number, compleat, signifying the full course of life: for beyond that we cannot number, but by replication; and it either implies all numbers within it self, or explains them by it self, and its own,by multiplying them: wherefore it is accounted to be of a manifold Religion, and power, and is applyed to the purging of souls. Hence the Ancients called Ceremonies Denary, because they that were to be expiated, and to offer sacrifices, were toabstain from some certain things for ten dayes. Whence amongst the Egyptians it was the custome for him that would sacrifice to Io, to fast ten dayes before, which Apuleius testifies of himself, saying, It was commanded that I should for the space often dayes refrain all meat, and be fasting. There are ten sanguine parts of man, the Menstrues, the Sperm, the Plasmatick spirit, the Mass, the Humours, the Organicall body, the vegetative part the sensitive part, reason, and the mind. There are also tensimple integrall parts constituting man, the bone, cartilage, nerve, fibre, ligament, artery, vein, membrane, flesh, skin. There are also ten parts of which a man consists intrinsecally; The spirit, the brain, the lungs, the heart, the liver, the gall, the spleen,the kidnies [kidneys], the testicles, the Matrix. There were ten Curtains in the Temple, ten strings in the Psaltery; ten musicall instruments with which Psalms were sang, the names whereof were, Neza, on which their Odes were sang, Nablum, thesame as Organs, Mizmor, on which the Psalms, Sir, on which the Canticles; Tehila, on which Orations, Beracha, on which Benedictions, Halel, on which Praises: Hodaia, on which Thanks, Asre, on which the Felicity of any one, Hallelujah, on whichthe praises of God only, and Contemplations. There were also ten singers of Psalms, viz. Adam, Abraham, Melchisedech, Moses, Asaph, David, Solomon, and three sons of Chora, there are also ten commandments; And the tenth day after the ascensionof Christ the Holy Ghost came down. This lastly is the number, in which Jacob wrestling with the Angel all night overcame, and at the rising of the Sun was blessed, and called by the name of Israel. In this number Joshua overcame thirty one Kings,and David overcame Goliath, and the Philistines, and Daniel escaped the danger of the Lions. This number also is as circular as unity, because being heaped together, returns into a unity, from whence it had its beginning, and it is the end, andperfection of all numbers, and the beginning of tens. As the number ten flows back into a unity, from whence it proceeded, so every thing that is flowing is returned back to that from which it had the beginning of its Flux. So water returns to the Sea,from whence it had its beginning, the body returns to the Earth, from whence it was taken; time returns into Eternity, from whence it flowed, the spirit shall return to God that gave it; and lastly, every creature returns to nothing, from whence it wasHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

God therefore that firstunity, or one thing, before he communicated himself to inferiours, diffused himself into the first of numbers, viz. The number three, then into the number ten, as into ten Ideas, and measures of making all numbers, and all things, which the Hebrewscall ten Attributes, and account ten divine names; For which cause there cannot be a further number. Hence all tens have some divine thing in them, and in the Law are required of God as his own, together with the first fruits, as the originall of things,and beginning of numbers, and every tenth is as the end given to him, who is the beginning, and end of all things.The Scale of the Number ten.The Scale of the Number ten.In theoriginallåäéåçéäåäéThe name Jehova of ten letterscollected.àä åàå àä ãåéThe Name Jehovah of ten letters Extended.úåàáö íéäìàThe name Elohim Sabaoth.The name of God with ten letters. äéäàEheie.øúëKether.äåäé éIodJehovah.äîëçHochmah.íéäìà äåäéJehovaElohim.äðéáBinah.ìàEl.ãñäHesed.øáéâ íéäìàElohimgibor.äøåáâGeburah.äåìàEloha.úøàôúTiphereth.úåàáö äåäéJehovahSabaothäöðNezah.úåàáö íéäìàElohimSabaoth.ãåäHod.éãùSadai.ãåñéIesod.éðãàAdonaimelech.úåëìîMalchuth.Ten names of God.Ten Sephiroth.In theintelligibleworld.Seraphim.Haiothha-kados.Metattron.Cherubim.Ophanim.Jophiel.Thrones.Aralim.Zaphkiel.Dominations.Hasmallim.Zadkiel.Powers.Seraphim.Camael.Vertues.Malachim.Raphel[Raphael].Principalities.Elohim.Haniel.Archangels.Ben Elohim.Michael.Angels.Cherubim.Gabriel.Blessedsouls.Issim.The soulofMessiah.Ten orders of the blessed according to Dionysius.Ten orders of the blessed according to the traditions of men.Ten Angels ruling.In theCelestiallworld.Reschithha-gallalim.ThePrimumMobile.Masloth.Thesphere oftheZodiake[zodiac].Sabbathi.The Sphereof Saturn.Zedeck.The sphereof Jupiter.Madim.The Sphereof Mars.Schemes.Thesphere ofthe Sun.Noga.The sphere ofVenus.Cochab.The sphere ofMercury.Levanah.Thesphere ofthe Moon.Holom.Jesodoth.Thesphere oftheElements.Ten spheres of the world.In theElementaryworld.A Dove.A Lizard.A Dragon.An Eagle.A Horse.Lion.Man.Genitals [sic.Serpent]Bull.Lamb.Ten Animals consecrated to the Gods.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Of the Number eleven, and the number twelve; with a double Scale of the Number twelve Cabalisticall, and Orphicall.The number eleven as it exceeds the number ten, which is the number of the commandements [commandments], so it fals short of the number twelve, which is of grace and perfection, therefore it is called the number of sins, and the penitent. Hence inthe tabernacle there were commanded to be made eleven Coats of hair which is the habit of those that are penitent, and lament for their sins, whence this number hath no Communion with Divine or Celestiall things, nor any attraction, or scale tendingto things above: neither hath it any reward; but yet sometimes it receives a gratuitous favor from God, as he which was called the eleventh hour to the vineyard of the Lord, received the sanne reward as those who had born the burden, and heat of theday. Now the number twelve is divine, and that whereby the Celestials are measured; it is also the number of the Signs in the Zodiack over which there are twelve angeis as chief, supported by the irrigation of the great name of God. In twelve yeers[years] also Jupiter perfects his course, and the Moon daily runs through twelve degrees. There are also twelve chief joynts [joints] in the body of man, viz. in hands, elbones [elbows], shoulders, thighs, knees, and vertebrae of the feet. There is also agreat power of the number twelve in divine mysteries. God chose twelve families of Israel, and set over them twelve Princes; so many stones were placed in the midst of Jordan, and God commanded that so many should be set on the breast of thePriest; twelve Lyons [lions] did bear the brazen Sea that was made by Solomon: there were so many fountains in Helim, and so many spies sent to the land of promise, and so many Apostles of Christ set over the twelve tribes, and twelve thousandpeople were set apart and chosen; the queen of Heaven crowned with twelve Stars, and in the Gospel twelve baskets of the fragments were taken up, and twelve Angels are set over the twelve gates of the City, and twelve stones of the heavenlyJerusalem. In inferior things many breeding things proceed after this number; so the Hare and Coney being most fruitfull, bring forth twelve times in the yeer [year], and the Cammel [camel] is so many moneths in breeding, and the Pea-cock [peacock]brings forth twelve Eggs.The Scale of the Number twelve.The namesof God withtwelveletters àåäHoly(ê)åøáBlessedùã÷äHe [Ipse] ùã÷ä çåøå ïá áàFather, Son, Holy Ghost.

Of the Numbers which are above twelve, and of their powers and vertues.The other numbers also which are above twelve, are endowed with many, and various effects, the vertues whereof you must understand by their originall, and parts, as they are made of a various gathering together of simple numbers, or maner ofmultiplication. Sometimes as their significations arise from the lessening, or exceeding going before, especially more perfect, so they contain of themselves the signs of certain divine mysteries. So you see the third number above ten, shews themysteries of Christs appearing to the Gentiles, for the thirteenth day after his birth a Star was a guide to the wise men. The fourteenth day doth typifie Christ, who the fourteenth day of the first moneth [month] was sacrificed for us; upon which day thechildren of Israel were commanded by the Lord to celebrate the Passeover [Passover]. This number Mathew [Matthew] doth so carefully observe, that he passed over some generations, that he might every where observe this number in the generationsof Christ. The fifteenth number is a token of spirituall ascensions, therefore the song of degrees is applyed to that in fifteen Psalms. Also fifteen yeers [years] were added to the life of King Hezekiah: and the fifteenth day of the seventh moneth [month]was observed, and kept holy. The number sixteen, the Pythagorians call the number of felicity. It also comprehends all the Prophets of the Old Testament, and the Apostles, and Evangelists of the new. The number eighteen, and twenty, Divinesinterpret to be unhappy, for in the former, Israel served Eglon King of Moab; and in the other Jacob served, and Joseph was sold. And lastly, amongst creatures that have many feet, there is none that hath above twenty feet. The twenty two signifiesthe fullness of wisdom, and so many are the Characters of the Hebrew letters, and so many Books doth the old Testament contain. To the number twenty eight, the favour of the Moon is designed, for the motion thereof is distant from the course ofother Stars, & as it were alone is compleated the twenty eighth day, when it returns to the same point of the Zodiake [zodiac] from whence it came. Hence twenty eight Mansions of the Moon, having singular vertue, and influence, are numbered in theheavens. The number thirty is memorable for many mysteries, Our Lord Jesus Christ was baptized the thirtieth yeer [year] of his Age, and began to do miracles, and to teach the Kingdom of God. Also John Baptist was thirty yeers old when be beganto preach in the wilderness, and to prepare the wayes of the Lord. Also Ezekiel at the same age began to prophecy; and Joseph was brought out of Prison on the thirtieth yeer of his Age, and received the government of Egypt from Pharaoh. Thenumber thirty two, the Hebrew Doctors ascribe to wisdom, and so many paths of wisdom are described by Abraham. But the Pythagorians call this the number of Justice, because it is alwaies divisible into two parts, even unto a unity. The numberfourty [forty], the Ancients did honour with great observation, concerning which they did celebrate the feast Tessarosten: It is said that it doth conduce to the account of birth, for in so many daies the seed is fitted, and transformed in the womb, untill itbe by its due, and harmoniacall proportions brought unto a perfect organicall body, being disposed to receive a rationall soul. And so many dayes they say women be, after they have brought forth, before all things are setled [settled] within them, andthey purifled, and so many dayes infants refrain from smiling, are infirme, and live with a great deal of hazard. This also is in Religion a number of expiation, and penitency, and signifying great mysteries. For in the time of the deluge the Lord rainedfourty daye, and nights upon the earth: The children of Israel lived fourty yeers in the wilderness; fourty dayes the destruction of Nineveh was put off. The same number was accounted as holy in the fasts of the Saints: For Moses, Elias, and Christfasted fourty dayes. Christ was carried fourty weeks in the womb of a Virgin, Christ tarryed fourty dayes after his birth at Bethelem [Bethlehem] before he was presented in the Temple: He preached fourty months publickly: He lay fourty [forty] hoursdead in the Sepulchre, the fourtieth day after his resurrection he ascended into heaven, all which Divines say, were not done without some occult property, and mysterie of this number. The number fifty signifies remission of sins, of servitudes, andalso liberty. According in the Law, on the fiftieth year they did remit debts, and every one did return to his own possessions. Hence by the yeer of Jubilee, and by the Psalm of repentance it shews a sign of indulgency, and repentance. The law also, andthe holy Ghost are declared in the same: For the fiftieth day after Israels going forth out of Egypt, the Law was given to Moses in mount Sinai: The fiftieth day after the resurrection, the holy Ghost came down upon the Apostles in mount Sion;Whence also it is called the number of grace, and attributed to the Holy Ghost. The number sixty, was holy to the Egyptians, for it is proper to the Crocodile, that as she in sixty dayes brings forth sixty eggs, and so many dayes sits on them, so she issaid also to live so many yeers, and to have so many teeth: and so many dayes every yeer to rest solitary without any meat. The number seventy hath also its mysteries, for so many yeers the fire of the sacrifice in the Babylonian Captivity lay under thewater, and was alive: so many yeers Jeremiah foretold the destruction of the Temple, and so many yeers the Babylonian Captivity endured, and in so many yeers the desolation of Jerusalem was finished. Also there were seventy Palms in the placewhere the children of Israel pitched their Tents. The Fathers went down to Egypt with seventy souls. Also seventy Kings with their fingers, and toes cut off did gather meat under the table of Adonibezeck seventy sons came forth of the loins of Joas,Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Seventy sons of King Ahab were beheaded in Samaria; seventy yeers, according to the Psalmist, are the Age of man. Lamech shall be avenged seventy seven fold; Thou shalt forgive thy brother if he offend against thee, seventyseven times. Also the number <seventy seven times. Also the number> seventy two was famous for so many languages, for so many Elders of the Synagogue, for so many interpreters of the old Testament, for so many Disciples of Christ: It hath also agreat Communion with the number twelve; hence in the heavens, every sign being divided into six parts, there result seventy two fives, over which so many angels bear rule; and so many are the names of God; and every five is set over one Idiom withsuch efficacy, that the Astrologers, and Physiognomists can know from thence from what Idiom everyone ariseth. Answerable to these are so many manifest joynts in mans body, whereof in every finger and toe there are three, which together with thetwelve Principal reckoned before in the number twelve make up seventy two. The number a hundred in which the sheep that was found, was placed, which also passeth from the left hand to the right, is found holy: and because it consists of tens itshews a complete perfection. But the Complement of all numbers is a thousand which is the four square measure of number ten, signifying a complete, and absolute perfection. There are also two numbers especially celebrated by Plato in his Repub.[Republic] and not disallowed by Aristotle in his Politicks, by which great mutations in Cities are foretold: These are the square of ten [*twelve], and the four square measure thereof, viz. the fourty four above a hundred, and seven hundred twentyeight above a thousand, which number is fatall: to which when any City, or Common Wealth hath attained, it shall afterward with a compleat four square measure decline: but in squares it undergoeth a change, but for the better, if it be governed withprudent discipline, and then it shall not with fate, but imprudency fall. And let thus much suffice for numbers in particular.Chapter xvi. Of the notes of numbers, placed in certain gesturings.I have often read in the books of Magicians, and their works, and experiments certain, wonderful, & as they seemed to me ridiculous gesturings, and I did think they were certain occult agreements of the divels, by reason of which I did reject them: butafter I did more seriously examine the matter, then I did presently understand that they were not the compacts of divels [devils]; but that there lay in them the reason of numbers, by which the ancients did by the various bending forward, and backward,their hands, and fingers represent numbers, by whose gesturings the Magiciand did silently signifie words unknown by sound, various with numbers, yet of great vertue, by their fingers joyned together, and sometimes changed, and did with sacredsilence worship the Gods that rule over the world. The rites whereof Martianus also makes mention of in his Arithmetick, saying, The fingers of the Virgin were moved all manner of wayes, who after she went in, did by expressing seven hundred andseventeen numbers with her bended fingers call upon Jupiter. But, that these things may be the better understood, I shall bring something out of the sayings of Beda who saith, When thou sayest one, bend in the litle [little] finger on thy left hand, andset it in the middle of the Palme; when thou sayest two, place the next finger to the litle finger in the same place; when three, the middle finger after the same manner; when four, thou shalt lift up thy little finger; when five, the next to it after the samemanner; when six, the middle, that finger alone which is called the ring finger, being fixt on the middle of the Palme: when thou sayest seve, thou shaly put only thy little finger above the root of thy Palm, tthe rest in the mean time being lifted up; andby it when thou sayest eight, thy ring finger; when thou sayest nine, thou shalt set thy middle finger contrary to them; when thou sayest ten, thou shall set the naile of thy fore-finger, or the middle joynt [joint] of thy thumb. When thou sayest twenty,thou shalt put the top of thy middle finger close betwixt the joynts of thy thumb, and forefinger. When thou sayest thirty, thou shalt joyn the naile of thy thumb, and fore-finger lightly together. When thou sayest fourty [forty], thou shalt bring theinside of thy thumb to the outside of thy fore-finger, both being lifted up. When thou sayest fiftym thou shalt bend thy thumb with the outward joynt like to the Greek Gamma to the Palme. When thou sayest sixty, compass about thy thumb beingbended as before, with thy fore-finger bowed over it. When thou sayest seventy, thou shalt supply thy fore-finger being bowed about as before, with thy thumb stretched at length, the naile thereof being lifted up before the middle joynt of thyfore-finger. When thou sayest eighty, thou shalt supply thy fore-finger bowed about as before, with thy thumb stretched forth at length, the naile thereof being set upon the middle joynt of the fore-finger. When thou sayest ninty, thou shall set the naileof thy fore-finger bent into the root of thy thumb stretched out. Thus much for the left hand. Now thou shalt make 100. on thy right hand, as thou sisdt ten of thy left; and 200. on thy right, as thou didst twenty on thy left; 2000. on thy right, as thoudidst two on thy left, and so to 9000. Moreover when thou sayest 10000. thou shalt put thy left hand upward on thy brest, thy fingers only being lifted towards Heaven. When thou sayest 20000. thou shalt put the same spread forth upon thy breast.When thou sayest 30000. thou shalt put thy thumb on the same hand downwards, on the cartilage of the middle of thy brest. When thou sayest 40000. thou shalt lay the same upright, and stretched forth on thy navell. When thou sayest 50000. thou shaltlay thy thumb of the same hand downard [downward] on thy navell. When thou sayest 60000. thou shalt hold thy left thigh with the same, being downards [downwards]. When thou sayest 70000. the same shalt put upon thy thumb upright. When thousayest 80000. thou shalt put the same downward on thy thigh. When thou sayest 90000. thou shalt hold thy loyns [loins] with the same, thy thumb being turned downwards. But when thou sayest 100000. or 200000. and so unto to 900000. thou shalt inthe same order as we have spoken, fill them up on the right part of thy body. But when thou sayest 1000000. thou shall joyn thy hands together, and clasp thy fingers one within the other. Let these suffice which have been observed out of Beda; Thoushalt finde more of these in Brother Luke of Saint Sepulchers, in his great Arithmetick.Chap. xvii. Of the various notes of numbers observed amongst the Romans.The notes of numbers are made diverse wayes in divers nations, The Romans did figure them by these following notes, which Valerius Probus ascribes concerning the ancient letters, and which are still in use, viz.One.I.Five.V.Ten.X.Fifty.L.A hundred.C.Two hundred.CC.Five hundred.D.A thousand.Five thousand.Ten thousand.Fifty thousand.A hundred thousand.Two hundred thousand.Five hundred thousand.A thousand thousand.There are also other notes of numbers now a dayes used amongst Arithmeticians, and Calculators, which according to the order of numbers are made after this manner. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. to which is added a note of privation signed with the mark 0which although it signifie no number, yet makes others to signifie, either tens, or hundreds, or thousands, as is well known to Arithmeticians. Also there are some that mark the number ten with a line downward, and another made cross it; and five bythat line which toucheth the other, but doth not go cross it, and a unity by that which is put by it self, as you may see in this example, signifies ten, signifies ten and five, signifies sixteen, ten and seven; and the round o being put by itself signifies a hundred; but being joyned to others, signifies so many hundreds as the numbers are to which it is put, as thus, oo or thus IIo signifies two hundred, thus ooo or thus IIIo three hundred five hundred, ten hundred or a thousand.And these notes are commonly seen added in Magicall Characters.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Of the notes or figures of the Græcians.The Græcians [Greeks] use the Alphabeticall letters for their notes ofnumbers, and that three wayes; first by every Element according to the series of the Alphabet signifying the number of its place. For in the order of which any number doth possessethe place of the Alphabet, it represents the number thereof, as here you may see.1.α2.β3.γ4.δ5.ε6.ζ7.η8.θ9.ι10.κ11.λ12.μ13.ν14.ξ15.ο16.π17.ρ18.σ19.τ20.υ21.φ22.χ23.ψ24.ωAnd this is the first order of numbeers amongst the Greeks. Secondly, the Greeks divide the whole Alphabet into three Classes, whereof the first beginning from Alpha, is of unites. The second beginning from Iota is of tens. The third begining fromRho is of hundreds; and this order by the latter of the Greeks is instituted after the imitation of the Hebrews. Now because threir Alphabet wants by that rule, three letters, it is necessary to add to them three figures and to interlace them with the letters,by which, viz. they explain the sixt, the ninetieth, and the nine hundreth, as is manifest in the following Classes.1.Α2.Β3.Γ4.∆5.Ε6.ζ7.Ζ8.Η9.Θ10.Ι20.Κ30.Λ40.Μ50.Ν60.Ξ70.Ο80.Π90.100.Ρ200.Σ300.Τ400.Υ500.Φ600.Χ700.Ψ800.Ω900.Now if to any of these letters there be subscribed the stroke of an acute tone, then it signifies so many thousands, as in these examples.1000./ A10000./ I100000./ PAfter the third manner, the Greeks use only six letters in signifying their numbers, viz. I, for an Unite, Π for the number five, because it is the head of the word πεντε (i.e.) five. ∆ for the number ten, from δεκα. H for a hundred from εκατον. X for athousand from the word χιλια, M for ten thousand from μυρια. From which six letters joyned in number after their manner unto four, or to other numbers, they make other numbers, besides Π which is not multiplyed, nor joyned to it self, but alwayesaignifies the fives of others, as appears in the following examples.1I2II3III4IIII5Π6ΠΙ7ΠΙΙ8ΠΙΙΙ9ΠΙΙΙΙ10∆11∆Ι12∆ΙΙ13∆ΙΙΙ14∆ΙΙΙΙ15∆Π16∆ΠΙ20∆∆21∆∆Ι5060∆100Η200ΗΗ5001000Χ500010000Μ50000Chap. xix. Of the notes of the Hebrews, and Caldeans [Chaldaeans], and certain other notes of Magicians.The Hebrew letters also have marks of numbers, but far more excellently then in any other languages, since the greatest mysteries lie in Hebrew letters, as is handled concerning these in that part of Cbaly which they call Notariacon. Now the principallHebrew letters are in number twenty two, whereof five have divers other figures in the end of a word, which therefore they call the five ending letters, which being added to them aforesaid make twenty seven, which being then divided into threedegrees, signifie the unites, which are in the first degree; tens which are in the second, and hundreds which are in the third degree. Now every one of them if they be marked with a great Character signifies so many thousands, as here3000.â2000.á1000.àNow the Classes of the Hebrew numbers are these,9.è8.ç7.æ6.å5.ä4.ã3.â2.á1.à90.ö80.ô70.ò60.ñ50.ð40.î30.ì20.ë10.é900.õ800.ó700.ï600.í500.ê400.ú300.ù200.ø100.÷Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Also the Egyptians, Æthiopians [Ethiopians], Caldeans [Chaldaeans], and Arabians, have their marks of numbers, which also often times happen amongst Magicall Characters. He therefore that would know them, must seek them, ofthem that are skilful of these letters. For the Caldeans [Chaldaeans] mark the numbers with the letters of their Alphabet after the manner of the Hebrews. We have set down their Alphabet in the end of the first book. Moreover I found in two mostancient books of Astrologers, and Magicians, certain most elegant marks of numbers, which I thought good to set down in this place; Now they were in both Volums [volumes] such.Now by these mark turned to the left hand are made tens, after this manner.And by those markes which are turned downwards on the right hand, are made hundreds; on the left thousands, viz. thus.And by the composition, and mixture of these markes other mixt and compounded numbers also are most elegantly made, as you may perceive by these few.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

What numbers are attributed to letters; and of divining by the same.The Pythagorians [Pythagorians] say (Aristotle, and Ptolemy are of the same opinion) that the very Elements of letters have some certain divine numbers, by which collected from proper names of things, we may draw conjectures concerning occultthings to come. Whence they call this kind of divination Arithmancy, because, viz. it is done by numbers, as Terentianus hath made mention of it in these verses.Names are, they say, made of but letters fewUnfortunate, of many, do foreshewSuccess; so Hector did Patroclus slay,So Hector to Achilles was a prey.Also Pliny saith, That there was added to what Pythagoras invented, an uneven number of vowels of imposed names, which did betoken lameness, or want of eyes, and such like misfortunes, if they be assigned to the right side parts; but an evennumber to them of the left. And Alexandrinus the Philosopher taught, How that by the number of letters we may find out the ruling Stars of any one that is born, and whether the husband or wife shall dye [die] first, and know the prosperous, orunhappy events of the rest of our works. His traditions which were not disallowed by Ptolemy the Astrologer we shall here add, and put under. But those numbers, which are deputed to each letter, we have above shewed in the Greek, and Hebrewletters, the Alphabet being divided into three Classes, whereof the first is of unites, the second of tens, the third of hundreds. And seeing in the Roman Alphabet there are wanting four to make up the number of twenty seven Characters, their places aresupplyed with I, and V sinple consonants, as in the names of John, and Valentine, and hi, and hu aspirate consonants as in Hierom, and Huilhelme, although the Germans for hu the asperate use a double vv; the true Italians, and French in their vulgarspeech put G joymed with U instead thereof, writing thus, Vuilhelmus, and Guilhelmus.1.A.2.B.3.C.4.D.5.E.6.F.7.G.8.H.9.I.10.K.20.L.30.M.40.N.50.O.60.P.70.Q.80.R.90.S.100.T.200.V.300.X.400.Y.500.Z.600.I.700.V.800.HI.900.HV.But if thou desirest to know the ruling Star of any one that is born, compute his name, and of both his parents, through each letter according to the number above written, and divide the sum of the whole being gathered together by nine, substracting itas often as thou canst; and if there remaine a unity, or four, both signifie the Sun; if two or seven, both signifie the Moon; but three, Jupiter; five, Mercury; six, Venus; eight, Saturne; nine, Mars; and the reasons thereof are shewed else where. In likemanner if thou desirest to know the horoscope of any one that is born, compute his name, and of his Mother, and Father, and divide the whole collected together by twelve, if there remain a unity, it signifies the Lyon; if Junos dewce, Aquarius; if theVestall three, Capricorn; if four, Sagittarius; if five, Cancer; if Venus six, Taurus; if Palladian seven, Aries; if Vulcans eight, Libra; if Mars his nine, Scorpio; if ten, Virgo; if eleven, Pisces; if Phoebus twelve, they represent Geminos; and the reasonsof them are given elswhere. And let no mam wonder that by the numbers of names many things may be Prognosticated, seeing (thr Pythagorian Philosophers, and Hebrew Cabalists testifying the same) in those numbers lye [lie] certain occult mysteriesunderstood by few: for the most High created all things by number, measure, and weight, from whence the truth of letters, and names had its originall, which were not instituted casually, but by a certain rule (although unknown to us.) Hence John inthe Revelation saith, Let him which hath understanding compute the number of the name of the beast, which is the number of a man. Yet these are not to be understood of those names, which a disagreeing difference of Nations, and divers rites ofNations according to the causes of places, or education have put upon men; but those which were inspired into every one at his birth, by the very Heaven with the conjunction of Stars, and those which the Hebrew Mecubals, and wise men of Egyptlong since taught to draw from the generation of every one.Chap. xxi. What numbers are consecrated to the Gods, and which are ascribed, and to what Elements.Moreover the Pythagorians have dedicated to the Element, and dieties [deities] of Heaven sacred numbers; for to the Aire they have assigned the number eight, and to fire five, to the earth six, to the water twelve. Besides, unity is ascribed to the Sun,which is the only King of the Stars, in which God put his Tabernacle; and that this also is of Jupiter, doth the Causative power of his ideal and intellectuall species testifie, who is the head, and the father of the Gods, as unity is the beginning, andparent of numbers: The number two is ascribed to the Moon, which is the second great light, and figures out the soul of the world, and is called Juno, because betwixt that and unity there is the first conjunction, and neer fellowship; it is also ascribed toSaturn, and Mars, two unfortunate Planets with the Astrologers; so the number three is ascribed to Jupiter, the Sun, and Venus, viz. three fortunate planets, and is deputed to Vesta, Hecata, and Diana; hence they say,Threefold is Hecate, three mouths DianaThe Virgin hath -----The number three therefore is dedicated to this Virgin whom they say to be powerfull in Heaven, and in Hell. The number four is of the Sun, which by that number constitutes the corners of the heavens, and distinguisheth seasons: it is also ascribed toCyllenius, because he alone is called the four square God. The number five consisting of the first even, and the first odd, as of female, and male, both sexes, is assigned to Mercury; it is also attributed to the Celestiall world, which beyond the fourElements is it self under another form, the fist. The number six, which consists of two threes, as a Commixtion of both sexes, is by the Pythagorians ascribed to generation, and marriage, and belongs to Venus, and Juno. The number seven is of rest,and belongs to Saturn; the same also doth dispence the motion, and light of the Moon, and therefore is called by the name of Tritonia the Virgin, because it begets nothing. It is assigned to Minerva, because it proceeds of nothing; also to Pallas theVirago, because it consists of nuumbers, as of males, and females. This also Plutarck ascribes to Apollo. The number eight, by reason it containes the mysterie of justice, is ascribed to Jupiter; it is also dedicated to Vulcan, for of the first motion, andthe number two, which is Juno drawn twice into it self, it consists; It is also attributed to Cybele the mother of the Gods, to whom every four square is attributed. Plutarck assigns it to Bacchus, or Dionysius, who is said to be born the eighth moneth[month]: others, because Infants of the wight moneth do not live, have attributed it to Saturn, and the three Ladies of destiny. The number nine belongs to the Moon, the utmost receptacle of all Celestiall influences, and vertues, as also it is dedicated tothe nine Muses, as also to Mars, from whom is the end of all things. The number ten is Circular, and belongs to the Sun, after the same manner as unity; also it is attributed to Janus, because it is the end of the first order, and from whence begins thesecond unity; it is also ascribed to the world. In like manner the number twelve, because the Sun going round twelve signes, distributes the yeer [year] into twelve moneths, is attributed to the world, the Heaven, and the Sun. The number eleven,because it is semicircular, is attributed to the Moon, and also deputed to Neptune.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy. Book II.

Of the tables of the Planets, their vertues, forms, and what Divine names, Intelligencies, and Spirits are set over them.It is affirmed by Magicians, that there are certain tables of numbers distributed to the seven planets, which they call the sacred tables of the planets, endowed with many, and very great vertues of the Heavens, in as much as they represent that divineorder of Celestiall numbers, impressed upon Celestials by the Idea's of the divine mind, by means of the soul of the world, and the sweet harmony of those Celestiall rayes, signifying according to the proportion of effigies, supercelestiall Intelligencies,which can no other way be expressed, then by the marks of numbers, and Characters. For materiall numbers, and figures can do nothing in the mysteries of hid things, but representatively by formall numbers, and figures, as they are governed, andinformed by intelligencies, and divine numerations, which unite the extreams of the matter, and spirit to the will of the elevated soul, receiving through great affection, by the Celestiall power of the operator, a power from God, applyed through thesoul of the universe, and observations of Celestiall constellations, to a matter fit for a form, the mediums being disposed by the skill, and industry of Magicians; But let us hasten to explain the tables severally. The first of them is assigned to Saturn,and consists of a square of three, containing the particular numbers of nine, and in every line three every way, and through each Diameter making fifteen. Now the whole sum of numbers is fourty five/ Over this are of Divine names set such names asfill up the numbers with an Intelligency to what is good, with a spirit to what is bad, and out of the same numbers is drawn the seal, or Character of Saturn, and of the spirits thereof, such as we shall beneath ascribe to its table. They say that this tablebeing with a fortunate Saturn engraved on a plate of lead, doth help to bring forth, or birth, and to make a man safe, and powerfull, and to cause success of petitions with princes, and powers: but if it be done with an unfortunate Saturn, that it hindersbuildings, plantings, and the like, and casts a man from honours, and dignities, and causes discords, and quarrellings, and disperses an Army. The second is called the table of Jupiter, which consists of a Quaternian drawn into it self [i.e. 4 times 4],containing sixteen particular numbers, and in every line, and Diameter four, making thirty four. Now the Sum of all is 136. And there are over it divine names with an Intelligence to good, with a spirit to bad, and out of it is drawn the Character ofJupiter, and the spirits thereof. They say that if it be impressed upon a Silver plate with Jupiter being powerfull, and ruling, it conduceth to gain, and riches, favor, and love, peace, and concord, and to appease enemies, to confirm honors, dignities, andcounsels, and dissolve enchantments if it be engraven on a corall. The third table belongs to Mars, which is made of a square of four containing twenty five numbers, and of these in every side and Diameter five, which make sixty five, and the sum ofall is 325. And there are over it Divine names with an Intelligence to good, with a spirit to bad, and out of it is drawn the Character of Mars, and of his spirits. These with Mars being fortunate, being engraven on an Iron plate, or sword, makes a manpotent in war, and judgments, and petitions, and terrible to his enemies, and victorious against them; and if engraven upon the Stone Correola, it stops blood, and the mestrues [menses]; but if it be engraven with Mars being unfortunate, on a plate ofred Brass, it hinders buildings, casts down the powerfull from dignities, honors, and riches, and causeth discord, strife, and hatred of men, and beasts, chaseth away Bees, Pigeons, and Fish, and hinders Mils, and renders them unfortunate that go forthto hunting, or fighting, and causeth barreness in men and women, and other Animals, and strikes a terror in all enemies, and compels them to submit. The fourth table is of the Sun, and is made of a square of six, and contains thirty six numbers,whereof six in every side, and Diameter, produce 111, and the sum of all is 666. There are over it divine names with an Intelligency to what is good, with spirit to what is evil, and out of it is drawn Characters of the Sun, and the spirits thereof. Thisbeing engraven on a Golden plate with the Sun being fortunate, renders him that wears it to be renowned, amiable, acceptable, potent in allhis works, and equals a man to Kings, and Princes, elevating him to high fortunes, inabling to do whatsoever hepleaseth: but with an unfortunate Sun, it makes a tyrant, and a man to be proud, ambitious, unsatisfiable, and to have an ill ending. The fifth table is of Venus, consisting of a square of seven drawn into it self, viz. of fourty nine numbers, whereof sevenon each side and Diameter make 175. and the sum of all is 1225. And there are over it divine names with an Intelligency to good, and spirit to evil; And there is drawn out of it the Character of Venus, and the spirits thereof. This being engraven on aSilver plate, Venus being fortunate, procureth concord, endeth strife, procureth the love of women, conduceth to conception, is good against barreness, causeth ability for generation, dissolves enchantments, and causeth peace between man, andwoman, and maketh all kind of Animals and Cattle fruitful; and being put into a Dove-house, causeth an increase of Pigeons. It conduceth to the cure of all melancholy distempers, and causeth joyfulness; and being carryed about travellers make themfortunate. But if it be formed upon Brass with an unfortunate Venus, it causeth contrary things to all that hath bin above said. The sixt table is of Mercury resulting from the square of eight drawn into it self, containing sixty four numbers, whereof eighton every side and by both Diameters make 260. and the sum of all 2080. and over it are set divine names with an Intelligency to what is good, with a spirit to what is evil, and from it is drawn a Character of Mercury, and the spirits thereof; and if it bewith Mercury being fortunate engraven upon Silver, or Tin, or yellow Brass, or be writ upon Virgin Parchment, it renders the bearer thereof gratefull, and fortunate to do what he pleaseth: it bringeth gain, and prevents poverty, conduceth to memory,understanding, and divination, and to the understanding of occult things by dreams: and if it be an unfortunate Mercury, doth all things contrary to these. The seventh table is of the Moon, of a square of nine multiplied into it self, having eighty onenumbers, in every side and Diameter nine, producing 369. and the sum of all 3321. And there are over it divine names with an Intelligency to what is good, and a spirit to what is bad. And of it are drawn the Characters of the Moon, and of the spiritsthereof. This fortunate Moon being engraven on Silver, renders the bearer thereof grateful, aimiable [amiable], pleasant, cheerfull, honored, removing all malice, and ill will. It causeth security in a ourney, increase of riches, and health of body, drivesaway enemies and other evil things from what place thou pleaseth; and if it be an unfortunate Moon engraven in a plate of Lead, where ever it shall be buried, it makes that place unfortunate, and the inhabitants thereabouts, as also Ships, Rivers,Fountains, Mills, and it makes every man unfortunate, against which it shall be directly done, making him fly from his Country, and that place of his abode where it shall be buried, and it hinders Physitians [physicians], and Orators, and all menwhatsoever in their office, against whom it shall be made. Now how the seals, and Characters of the Stars, and spirits are drawn from these tables, the wise searcher, and he which shall understand the verifying of these tables, shall easily find out.Divine names answering to the numbers of Saturn.3.

Of Geometrical Figures and Bodies, by what vertue theyare powerful in Magick, and which are agreeable to each Element, andthe Heaven.Geometricall Figures also arising from numbers, are conceived to be of no less power. Of these first of all, aCircle doth answer to Unity, and the number ten; for Unity is the Center, and circumference of all things;and the number ten being heaped together retuens into a Unity from whence it had its beginning, being theend, and complements of all numbers. A circle is called an infinite line in which there is no Terminus a quo,nor Terminus ad quem, whose beginning and end is in every point, whence also a circular motion is calledinfinite, not according to time, but according to place; hence a circular being the largest and perfectest of allis judged to be the most fit for bindings and conjurations; Whence they who adjure evil spirits, are wont toenviron themselves about with a circle. A Pentangle also, as with the vertue of the number five hath a verygreat command over evil spirits, so by its lineature, by which it hath within five obtuse angles, and withoutfive acutes, five double triangles by which it is surrounded. The interior pentangle containes in it greatmysteries, which also is so to be enquired after, and understood; of the other figures, viz. triangle,quadrangle, sexangle, septangle, octangle, and the rest, of which many, as they are made of many and diversinsections [intersections], obtain divres significations and vertues according to the divers manner of draeing,and proportions of lines, and numbers. The Egyptians, and Arabians confirmed that the figure of the Crosshath very great power, and that is the most firm receptacle of all Celestial powers, and intelligencies,because it is the rightest figure of all, containing foure right angles, and it is the first description of thesuperficies, having longitude and latitude: And they said it is inspired with the fortitude of the Celestials,because their fortitude results by the straitness of angles and rayes: And stars are then most potent whenthey possess four corners in the figure of the heaven, and make a cross, by the projection of their rayesmutually. It hath moreover (as we shewed before) a very great correspondency with the numbers 5. 7. 9.most potent numbers. It was also reckoned by the Egyptian Priests, from the beginning of Religion amongstsacred letters, signifying amongst them allegorically the life of future salvation. It was also impressed on thePicture of Serapis, and was had in great veneration amongst the Greeks. But what here belongs to Religionwe shall discuss elsewhere. This is to be observed, whatsoever wonderfull thing figures work when we writetham in Papers, Plates, or Images, they do not do it but by the vertue acquired from sublimer figures, by acertain affection which a natural apitude [aptitude] or resemblance procures, in as much as they are exactlyconfigured to them; as from an opposite wall the Eccho is caused, and in a hollow glass the collection of thesolarie rayes, which afterward reflecting upon an opposite body, either wood, or any combustible thing dothforthwith burne it: or as an Harpe causeth a resounding in an other Harpe, which is no otherwise but becausea sutable and a like figure is set before it, or as two strings on a Harpe being touched with an equall distanceHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

And as these are spoken of figures, so also they are to be understood of Geometricalbodies, which are a Sphear [sphere], a Tetracedron, Hexacedron, Octocedron, Icocedron, Dodecacedron[tetrahedron, hexahedron, octohedron, icohedron, dodecahedron], and such like. Neither must we pass overwhat figures Phythagoras [Pythagoras] and his followers, Timeus, Locrus, and Plato assigned to theElements and Heavens: for first of all they assigned to the earth a four square, and a square of eight solidangles, and of twenty four plains [planes], and six bases in form of a Dice to the fire, a Pryamis [pyramid] ofa four triangular basis, and of so many solid angles, and of twelve plaines; to the aire Octocedron[octohedron], of eight triangular bases, and six solid angles, and ternty four plains: and lastly, to Water theyhave assigned Icocedron [icohedron] twenty basesm twelve solid angles: To the Heaven they have assignedDodecacedron [dodecahedron] of twelve five cornered bases, and twenty solid angles, and sixty plaines.Now he which knows the powers, relations, and proprieties of these figures, and bodies, shall be able towork many wonderful things in Natural and Mathematical Magick, especially in Glasses. And I knew howto make by them wonderful things, in which any one mught see whatsoever he pleased at a long distance.Chap. xxiv. Of Musicall Harmony, of the force and power thereof.Musical Harmony also is not destitute of the gifts of the Stars; for it is a most powerful imaginer of allthings, which whilst it follows opportunely the Celestial bodies, doth wonderfully allure the Celestialinfluence, and doth change the affections, intentions, gestures, motions, actions and dispositions of all thehearers, and doth quietly allure them to its own properties, as to gladness, lamentation, to boldness, or rest,and the like; also it allures Beasts, Serpents, Birds, Dolphins to the hearing of its pleasant tunes. So Birdsare allured with Pipes, and Harts are caught by the same. Fish in the lake of Alexandria are delighted with anoise. Musick hath caused friendship betwixt Men and Dolphins. The sound of the Harp doth lead up anddown the Hyperborean Swans. Melodious voyces [voices] tame the Indian Elephants: and the very Elementsdelight in Musick. The Hulesian fountain otherwise calm, and quiet, if the Trumpet sound riseth uprejoycing [rejoicing], and swells over its banks. There are in Lydia those which they call the Nymphs Ilands[Islands], which at the sound of a Trumpet forthwith come into the middle of the sea, and turning round leada dance, and then are returned to the shores; M. Varro testifies that he saw them. And there are morewonderful things then these. For in the shore of Attica the sea sounds like a Harpe. A certain stone ofMegaris makes a sound like a Harpe every time the string of a Harpe is struck; so great is the power ofMusick, that it appeaseth the minde, raiseth the spirit, stirreth up souldiers [soldiers] to fight, and refresheththe weary, calls back them that are desperate, refresheth travellers. And the Arabians say, that Camelscarrying burdens are refreshed by the singing of their leaders. In like manner, they that carry great burdens,sing, and are thereby strengthened and refreshed: for asinging causeth delight and strength, pacifieth theangry, cheareth [cheers] up those that are sad and heavy, pacifieth enemies, moderates the rage of mad men,chaseth away vain imaginations: Hence it is that Democritus and Theophrastus affirm that some diseases ofthe body, and minde may thus be cured, or caused. So we read that Therpander, and Arion of Lesbos curedthe Les*ians [inhabitants of Lesbos], and Ionians by Musick; and Ismenia of Thebes cured divers of verygreat diseases by Musick; Moreover, Orpheus, Amphion, David, Phythagoras [Pythagoras], Empedocles,Asclepiades, Timotheus, were wont to do many wonderful things by sounds: Sometimes they did stir up dullspirits by familiar sounds; sometimess they did restrain wanton, furious, angry spirits by more grave tones.So David with a Harp moderated Saul in a rage. So Phythagoras [Pythagoras] recalled a luxurious yong[young] man from immoderate lust. So Timotheus stirred up King Alexander to a rage, amd again repressedhim. Saxo the Grammarian, in his History of the Danes, tells of a certain Musician, who boasted that hecould by his Musick make every one that heard it to be mad; and when he was constrained by the KingsHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

We read also, that they in Apulia that were touched with a kinde of dangerous Spider,were astonished untill they heard a certain sound, at the hearing of which every one riseth up and danceth.And it is believed (Gellius being witness) that they that are pained with the Sciatica, are eased at the soundof a Pipe. Also Theophrastus reports, that the sound of a Flute cures the biting of Spiders. And Democritushimself confesseth that the Consort of Pipers, hath been a cure for very many diseases.Chap. xxv. Of Sound, and Harmony, and whence their wonderfulnessin operation.Moreover we shall not dent, that there is in Sounds a vertue to receive the heavenly gifts; if with Pythagorasand Plato we thought the heavens to consist by an Harmonial composition, and to rule and cause all thingsby Harmonial tones and motions: Singing can do more then the sound of an Instrument, in as much as itarising by an Harmonial consent, from the conceit of the minde, and imperious affection of the phantasie[phantasy] and heart, easily penetrateth by motion, with the refracted and well tempered Air, the aeriousspirit of the hearer, which is the bond of soul and body; and transferring the affection and minde of theSinger with it, It moveth the affection of the hearer by his affection, and the hearers phantasie by hisphantasie, and minde by his minde, and striketh the minde, and striketh the heart, and pierceth even to theinwards of the soul, and by little and little, infuseth even dispositions: moreover it moveth and stoppeth themembers and the humors of the body. From hence in moving the affections harmony conferreth so much,that not onely natural, but also artificial and vocal Harmony doth yield a certain power both to the souls andbodies: but it is necessary that all Consorts proceed from fit foundations, both in stringed instruments, inpipes, and vocall singings, if you would have them agree well together: for no man can make the roaring ofLions, the lowing of Oxen, the neighing of Horses, the braying of Asses, the grunting of Hogs to beharmonious: neither can the strings made of Sheeps and Wolves gut, be brought to any agreement, becausetheir foundations are dissonant; but the many and divers voyces [voices] of men agree together, becausethey have one foundation in the species or kinde: so many birds agree, because they have one nigh genus orkinde, and a resemblance from above; also artificiall instruments agree with natural voyces, because thesimilitude that is betwixt them, is either true and manifest, or hath a certain analogy. But every harmony iseither of sounds or voyces. Sound is a breath, voyce is a sound and animate breath; Speech is a breathpronounced with sound, and a voyce signifying something: the spirit of which proceedeth out of the mouthwith sound and voyce; Chaludius [Chalcidius] saith that a voyce is sent forth out of the inward cavity of thebreast and heart, by the assistance of the spirit. By which, together with the tongue, forming, and striking thenarrow passages of the mouth, and by the other vocall organs, are delivered forth articulate sounds; theelements of speech, by which Interpreter the secret motions of the minde are laid open: but Lactantius saith,that the nature of the voyce is very obscure, and cannot be comprehended how it is made, or what it is. Toconclude, All Musick consisteth in voice, in sound, and hearing: sound without Air cannot be Audible,which though it be necessary for hearing, yet, as Aire, it is not of it self audible, nor to be perceived by anysense, unless by accident; for the Sight seeth it not, unless it be coloured, nor the Ears unless sounding, northe Smell unless odoriferous, nor the Taste unless it be sapid [savory], nor the Touch unless it be cold orhot, and so forth: Therefore though sound cannot be made without Air, yet is not sound of the nature of Air,not air of the nature of sound, but air is the body of the life of our sensitive spirit, and is not of the nature ofany sensible object, but of a more simple and higher vertue, but it is meet that the sensitive soul shouldvivifie the air joyned to it; and in the vivificated air, which is joyned to the spirit, perceive the species ofobjects put forth into act, and this is done in the living air, but in a subtile and Diaphanous the visiblespecies, in an ordinary air the audible, in a more gross air the species of other senses are perceived.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Jupiter hath the grace of the octave, and also the quinte,viz. the Diapason with the Diapente: Sol obtains the melody of the octave voice, viz. Diapason; in likemanner by fifteen Tones, a Disdiapason; Venus keepeth the grace of the quinte or Diapente. Mercury hathdiatessaron; viz. the grace of the quarte: Moreover the ancients being content with four strings, as with thenumber of Elements, accounted Mercury the Author of them, as Nicomachus reports, and by their Basestrings would resemble the earth, by their Parhypas or middle the water; by their note Diezeugmenon, orHyperboleon the fire; by the Paranete or Synemmenon, or treble, the Air; but afterwards Terpander theLesb*an [inhabitant of Lesbos] finding out the seventh string, equalled them to the number of the Planets.Moreover, they that followed the number of the Elements, did affirm, that four humors, and did thin theDorian musick to be consonant to the water and phlegm, the Phrygian to choler and fire, the Lydian toblood and air; the mixt Lydian [mixolydian] to melancholy and earth: Others respecting the number andvertue of the Heavens, have attributed the Dorian to the Sun, the Phrygian to Mars, the Lydian to Jupiter,the mixt Lydian [mixolydian] to Saturn, the Hypophrygian to Mercury, the Hypolydian to Venus, theHypodorian to the Moon, the Hypo mixed Lydian [Hypomixolydian] to the mixed Stars: Moreover theyrefer these modes of Musick to the Muses, and the strings to the Heavens, but not in that order as we havedeclared concerning the nine Muses, amongst our numbers and celestial souls; for they say Thalia hath noHarmony, therefore ascribe her to Silence, and the Earth; but Clio with the Moon move after theHypodorian manner; the string Proslambanomenos or Air.

Forthe space which is betwixt the Earth and the Moon, viz. an hundred and twenty six thousand Italian Miles,maketh the Intervall of a Tone; But from the Moon to Mercury being half that space, maketh half a Tone;And so much from Mercury to Venus maketh another half Tone; But from thence to the Sun, as it were athreefold Tone and a half; and makes Diapente; But from the Moon to the Sun, maketh a twofoldDiatessaron with a half; Again from the Sun to Mars is the same space as from the Earth to the Moon,making a Tone; from thence to Jupiter half of the same making half a Tone; So much likewise from Jupiterto Saturn, constituting an half Tone, from whence to the starry firmament is also the space of an half Tone.Therefore there is from the Sun to the fixed Stars a Diatessaron distance of two tones and an half, but fromthe Earth a perfect Diapason of six perfect tones; moreover also from the proportion of the motions of theplanets amongst themselves, and with the eight Sphere, resulteth the sweetest Harmony of all; for theproportion of the motions of Saturn to Jupiters motion, is two fold and an half; of Jupiter to Mars, a six foldproportion; of Mars to the Sun, Venus and Mercury, which in a manner finish their course in the same time,is a double proportion; but Saturns proportion to the starry Sphere is a thousand and two hundred, if it betrue which Ptolomy saith, viz. that, that Heaven is moved contrary to the primum mobile in an hundredyeers, one degree. Therefore the proper motion of the Moon being more swift, maketh a more acute soundthen the starry firmament, which is the slowest of all, and therefore causeth the most base sound; But by theviolent motion of the primum mobile, is the most swift, and acute sound of all; but the violent motion of theMoon is most slow and heavy, which proportion and reciprocation of motions yeelds a most pleasantHarmony; from hence there are not any songs, sounds, or musicall instruments more powerfull in movingmans affections, or introducing magicall impressions, then those which are composed of numbers,measures, and proportions, after the example of the Heavens. Also the Harmony of the Elements is drawnforth from their BAses, and Angles, of which we have spoken before; for between Fire and Aire, there is adouble proportion in the Bases, and one and an half in solid Angles; again in Planes, a double; there arisethhence an Harmony of a double Diapason, and a Diapente. Betwixt the Aire and Water, the proportion intheir Bases is double, and one and an half; hence Dipason, and Diapente; but in their Angles double; Henceagain Diapason; but between Water and Earth the proportion in the Bases, is threefold and a third part more;from hence ariseth Diapason, Diapente, Diatessaron; but in the Angles one and an half, again constitutingDiapente. To conclude, betwixt Earth and Fire, in the Bases the proportion is one and an half, makingDiapente; but in the Angles, double, causing Diapason; but between Fire, and Water, Aire and Earth, there isscarce any consonancy, because they have a perfect contrariety in their qualities, but they are united by theimtermediate Element.Chap. xxvii. Of the proportion, measure, and Harmony of mans body.Seeing man is the most beautifull and perfectest work of God, and his Image, and also the lesser world;therefore he by a more perfect composition, and sweet Harmony, and more sublime dignity doth contain andmaintain in himself all numbers, measures, weights, motions, Elements, and all other things which are of hiscomposition; and in him as it were in the supreme workmanship, all things obtain a certain high condition,beyond the ordinary consonancy which they have in other compounds. From hence all the Ancients in timepast did number by their fingers, and shewed all numbers by them; and they seem to prove that from thevery joynts of mans body all numbers measures, proportions, and Harmonies were invented; Henceaccording to this measure of the body, they framed, and contrived their temples, pallaces [palaces], houses,Theaters; also their ships, engins [engines], and every kind of Artifice, and every part and member of theiredifices, and buildings, as columnes, chapiters of pillars, bases, buttresses, feet of pillars, and all of thiskind. Moreover God himself taught Noah to build the Arke according to the measure of mans body, and hemade the whole fabrick of the world proportionable to mans body; from whence it is called the great world[macrocosm], mans body the less [microcosm]; Therefore some who have written of the Microcosme or ofman, measure the body by six feet, a foot by ten degrees, every degree by five minutes; from hence areHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

In like manner the measures of all the membersare proportionate, and consonant both to the parts of the world, and measures of the Archetype, and soagreeing, that there is no member in man which hath not correspondence with some sign, Star, intelligence,divine name, sometimes in God himself the Archetype. But the whole measure of the body may be turned,and proceeding from roundness, is knowen to tend to it again.[figure 2-64]Also the four square measure is the most proportionated body; for, if a man be placed upright with his feettogether, and his arms stretched forth, he will make a quadrature equilateral, whose center s in the botom[bottom] of his belly.[figure 2-65]But if on the same center a circle be made by the crown of the head, the arms being let fall so far till the endof the fingers tough the circumference of that circle, and the feet spread abroad in the same circumference,as much as the fingers ends are distant from the top of the head; Then they divide that circle, which wasdrawn from the center of the lower belly, into five equale parts, and do constiturte a perfect Pentagon; andthe Heels of the feet, having reference to the navile [navel], make a triangle of equal sides.[figure 2-66]But if the Heels being unmoved, the feet be stretched forth on both sides to the right and left, and the handslifted up to the line of the head, them the ends of the fingers and Toes do make a square of equall sides,whose center is on the navile [navel], in the girdling of the body.[figure 2-67]But if the hands be thus elevat4ed, and the feet and Thighes extended in this manner, by the which a man ismade shorter by the fourteenth part of his upright stature, then the distance of his feet heving reference tothe lower bellu, they will make an equilaterall Triangle; and the center being placed in his navile [navel], acircle being brought about, will touch the ends of the fingers and toes.[figure 2-68]Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

The compass of a man under the armpits contains the middle ofhis length, whose middle is the bottom of his breast: and from thence upward to the middle of his breastbetwixt both dugges, and from the middle of his breast unto the crown of his head, on every side the fourthpart; also from the bottom of his breast to the bottom of the knees, and from thence to the bottom of theankles the fourth part of man. The same is the latitude of his shoulder-blades, from one extream [extreme] tothe other: The same is the length from the elbow to the end of the longest finger, and therfore this is called acubit. Hence four cubits make the length of man, and one cubit the bredth which is in the shoulder-blades,but that which is in the compass, one foot; now six hand-bredths make a cubit, four a foot, and four fingersbredths make a hand-bredth, and the whole length of man is twenty four hand bredths, of six foot, of nintysix fingers bredths. From the bottom of his breast to the top of his breast, is the sixth part of his length, fromthe top of his breast to the top of his forehead, and lowermost root of his hairs, the seventh part of his length;of a strong, and well set body, a foot is the sixth part of the length, but of a tall the seventh. Neither can (asVarro, and Gellius testifie) the tallness of mans body exceed seven feet. Lastly, the Diameter of his compassis the same measure as is from the hand, being shut unto the inward bending of the elbow, and as that whichis from the breast to both dugs, upward to the upward lip, or downward to the navel; and as that which isfrom the ends of the bones of the uppermost part of the breast compassing the gullet; and as that which isfrom the sole of the foot to the end of the calf of the legg, and from thence to the middle whirle bone of theknee. All these measures are co-equall, and make the seventh part of the whole height. The head of a manfrom the bottom of the chin to the crown of his head is the eighth part of his length, as also from the elbowto the end of the shoulder-blade; So great is the Diameter of the compass of a tall man. The compass of thehead drawn by the top of the forehead, and the bottom of the hinder part of the head, make the fift part of hiswhole length; So much also doth the bredth of the breast. Nine face-bredths make a square well set man, andten a tall man. The length of man therefore being divided into nine parts, the face from the top of theforehead to the bottome of the chin is one; then from the bottom of the throat, or the top of the breast untothe top of the stomack [stomach] is another; from thence to the navell is a third; from thence to the bottomof the thigh, a fourth; from thence the hipp, to the top of the calf of the leg, makes two; from thence to thejoynt of the foot the leggs make two more; all which are eight parts. Moreover the space from the top pf theforehead to the crown of the head & that which is from the chin to the top of the breast, and that which isfrom the joynt of the foot to the sole of the foot, I say these three spaces joyned together make the ninth part.In bredth the breast hath two parts, and both Arms seven. But that body which ten face bredths make, is themost exactly proportioned. Therefore the first part of this is from the crown of the head to the bottome of thenose; from thence to the top of the breast, the second; and then to the top of the stomack [stomach] the third;and from thence to the navel, the fourth; from thence to the privy members [genitals], the fifth; where is themiddle of the length of man, from whence to the soles of his feet are five other parts, which being joyned tothe former, make ten whole, by which every body is measured by a most proportioned measure. For the faceof a man from the bottom of his chin, to the top of his foreheadm and bottom of the hair is the tenth part.The hand of a man from the shutting, to the end of the longest finger is also one part; also betwixt themiddle of both dugs is one part and from both to the top of the gullet is an equilaterall triangle.

The compass of the head cross-wise from the distance of the eye-brows by the top of the forehead untothe bottom of the hinder part of the head, where the hair ends, hath also two parts; from the shoulders on theoutside unto the coupling together of the joynts of the hand, and on the inside from the arm-pits unto thebeginning of the palm of the hand, and of the fingers, are three parts. The compass of the head by the middleof the forehead hath three parts; the compass of the girdling place hath four parts in a well set man, but in athin body three parts and a half, or as much as is from the top of the breast to the bottom of the belly.

The distance betwixt the middle of the eye brows to the outward corners ofthe eyes is as much as betwixt those corners and the ears. The hight of the forehead, the length of the nose,and the widness of the mouth are equall. Also the bredth of the hand, and foot are the same.

The eye-brows joyned together areas much as the circle of the eyes, and the half circle of the ears equals the widness of the mouth: Whence thecircles of the eyes, ears, and mouth opened are equall. The bredth of the nose is as much as the length of theeye; Hence the eyes have two parts of that space which is betwixt both extremities of the eyes; a third partthe nose that is betwixt takes up. From the crown of the head to the knees the navel is the middle; from thetop of the breast to the end of the nose the knurle of the throat makes the middle; from the crown of the headto the bottom of the chin, the eyes are the middle; from the space betwixt the eyes to the bottom of the chin,the end of the nose is the middle: from the end of the nose to the bottom of the chin, the end of the lower lipis the middle; a third part of the same distance is the upper lip. Moreover all these measures are throughmanifold proportions, and harmoniacall contents consonant one to the other; for the thumb is to the wrest ina circular Measure in a double proportion and half; For it contains it twice and a half as five is to two; Butthe proportion of the same to the brawn of the Arm neer the shoulder is triple; The greatnesse of the leg is tothat of the Arm, a proportion half so much again as of three to two; And the same proportion is of the neckto the leg, as of that to the Arm. The proportion of the thigh is triple to the Arm; The proportion of thewhole Body to the Trunk, is eigth and a half; From the Trunk or Brest to the legs, and from thence to thesoles of the Feet, a Third and a half; From the neck to the navell, and to the end of the trunk a Double. Thelatitude of them to the latitude of the thigh, is half so much again; of the head to the neck triple, of the headto the knee triple, the same to the leg. The length of the forehead betwixt the temples is fourfold to theheight thereof; These are those measures which are everywhere found; by which the members of mans bodyaccording to the length, bredth, height, and circumference thereof agree amongst themselves, and also withthe Celestials themselves: all which measures are divided by manifold proportions either upon them thatdivide, or are mixed, from whence there results a manifold Harmony. For a double proportion makes thricea Diapason; four times double, twice a Diapason, and Diapente. After the same manner are Elements,qualities, complexions, and humors proportioned.

And this saith Pliny was the heresie of the Egyptians. The motionsalso of the members of mens bodies answer to the Celestial motions, and every man hath in himself themotion of his heart, which answers to the motion of the Sun, and being diffused through the Arteries into thewhole body, signifies to us by a most sure rule, years, moneths, dayes, hours, and minutes. Moreover, thereis a certain Nerve found by the Anatomists about the nod of the neck, which being touched doth so move allthe members of the body, that every one of them move according to its proper motion; by which like touchAristotle thinks the members of the world are moved by God. And there are two veines in the neck, whichbeing held hard presently the mans strength failes, and his senses are taken away untill they be loosened.Therefore the eternal Maker of the world when he was to put the soul into the body, as into its habitation,first made a fit lodging worthy to receive it, and endows the most excellent soul with a most beautiful body,which then the soul knowing its own divinity, frames and adorns for its own habitation. Hence the people ofÆthiopia [Ethiopia], which were governed by the wisdom of Gymnosophists, as Aristotle witnesseth, didmake them Kings, not of those which were most strong, and wealthy, but those onely which were mostproper and beautiful; for they conceived that the gallantry of the minde did depend upon the excellencie ofthe body. Which many Philosophers, as well ancient as modern, considering, such as searched into thesecrets of causes hid in the very Majesty of Nature, were bold to assert, that there was no fault of, and nodisproportion of the body, which the vice and intemperance of the minde did not follow, because it is certainthat they do increase, thrive, and operate by the help one of the other.Chap. xxviii. Of the Composition and Harmony of the humane soul.As the Consonancy of the body consists of a due measure and proportion of the members: so theconsonancy of the minde of a due temperament, and proportion of its vertues and operations which areconcupiscible, irascible, and reason, which are so proportioned together. For Reason to Concupiscence haththe proportion Diapason; but to Anger Diatessaron: and Irascible to Concupiscible hath the proportionDiapente. When therefore the best proportionated soul is joyned to the best proportionated body, it ismanifest that such a man also hath received a most happy lot in the distribution of gifts, for as much as thesoul agrees with the body in the disposition of Naturals, which agreement indeed is most hid, yet after somemaner shadowed to us by the wise. But to hasten to the Harmony of the soul, we must inquire into it bythose Mediums by which it passeth to us, (i.e.) by Celestial Bodies, and Sphears [spheres]; Knowingtherefore what are the powers of the soul to which the Planets answer, we shal by those things which havebeen spoken of before, the more easily know their agreements amongst themselves. For the Moone governsthe powers of increasing and decreasing; the Phantasie and Wits depends on Mercury; the Concupisciblevertue on Venus; the Vitall on the Sun; the Irascible on Mars; the Natural on Jupiter: the Receptive onSaturn: but the Will as the Primum Mobile, and the guide of all these Powers at pleasure, being joyned withthe superior intellect, is always tending to good; which intellect indeed doth alwayes shew a pathway to theWill, as a Candle to the eye; but it moves not it self, but is the Mistriss [mistress] of her own operation,whence it is called Free Will; and although it alwayes tends to good, as an object sutable to it self: yetsometimes being blinded with error, the animal power forcing it, it chooseth evil, believing it to be good.Therefore Will is defined to be a faculty of the intellect, & Will wherby good is chosen by the help ofGrace; and Evil, that not assisting, Grace therefore, which Divines call Charity, or infused Love is in theWill, as a first mover; which being absent, the whole consent falls into Dissonancy. Moreover, the soulanswers to the Earth by Sense, to the Water by Imagination, to the Air by Reason, to the Heaven by theIntellect, and the soul goes out into an HArmony of them, according as these are tempered in a mortall body.The wise Ancients therefore knowing that the Harmonious dispositions of bodies and souls are divers,according to the diversity of the complexions of men, did not in vain use Musical sounds and singingsm asto confirm the health of the body, and restore it being lost so to bring the minde to wholsome [wholesome]manners, untill they make a man sutable to the Celestial Harmony, and make him wholly Celestial.Moreover, there is nothing more efficacious to drive away evil spirits then Musicall Harmony (for theyHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Of the Observation of Celestials, necessary in everyMagical Work.Every natural vertue doth work things far more wonderful when it is not onely compounded of a naturalproportion, but also is informed by a choice observation of the Celestials opportune to this (viz. when theCelestial power is most strong to that effect which we desire, and also helpt by many Celestials) bysubjecting inferiors to the Celestials, as proper females to be made fruitful by their males. Also in everywork there are to be observed, the situation, motion, and aspect of the Stars, and Planets, in Signs andDegrees, and how all these stand in reference to the length and latitude of the Climate; for by this are varyedthe qualities of the angles, which the rays of Celestial bodies upon the figure of the thing describe, accordingto which Celestial vertues are infused. So when thou art working any thing which belongs to any Planet,thou must place it in its dignities, fortunate, and powerful, and ruling in the day, hour, and in the Figure ofthe Heaven. Neither shalt thou expect the signification of the work to be powerful, but also thoo mustobserve the Moon opportunely directed to this; for thou shalt do nothing without the assistance of the Moon:And if thou hast more patterns of thy work, observe them all being most powerful, and looking upon one theother with a friendly aspect: and if thou canst not have such aspects, it will be convenient at least that thoutake them angular. But thou shalt take the Moon, either when she looks upon both, or is joyned to one, andlooks upon the other; or when she passeth from the conjunction, or aspect of one to the conjunction oraspect of the other: for that I conceive must in no wise be omitted; also thou shalt in every work observeMercury; for he is a messenger betwixt the higher gods, and infernal gods; when he goeth to the good heincreaseth their goodness; when to the bad, hath influence upon their wickedness. We call it an unfortunateSign, or Planet, when it is by the aspect of Saturn or Mars, especially opposite, or quadrant; for these areaspects of enmity; but a conjunction, or a trine, or sextile aspect are of friendship; betwixt these there is agreater conjunction: but yet if thou dost already behold it through a trine, and the Planet be received, it isaccounted as already conjoyned. Now all Planets are afraid of the conjunction of the Sun, rejoycing in thetrine, and sextile aspect thereof.Chap. xxx. When Planets are of most powerful influence.Now we shall have the Planets powerfull when they are ruling in a House, or in Exaltation or Triplicity, orterm, or face without combustion of what is direct in the figure of the heavens, viz. when they are in Angles,especially of the rising, or Tenth, or in houses presently succeeding, or in their delights. But we must takeheed that they be not in the bounds or under the dominion of Saturn or Mars, least they be in dark Degrees,in pits or vacuityes. Thou shalt observe that the Angles of the Ascendent, and Tenth and Seventh befortunate, as also the Lord of the Ascendent and place of the Sun and Moon, and the place of part of thefortune, and the Lord thereof, the Lord of ihe foregoing Conjunction & prevention: But that they of themalignant Planet fall unfortunate, unless haply they be significators of thy work, or can be any wayadvantagious to thee; or if in thy revolution or birth, they had the predominancy; for then they are not at allto be depressed. Now we shall have the Moone powerfurful if she be in her house, or exaltation, or triplicity,or face, and in degree convenient for the desired work, and if it hath a mansion of these twenty and eightsutable to it self and the work; Let her not be in the way burnt up, nor flow in course; let her not be in theEcclipse [eclipse], or burnt by the Sun, unless she be be in unity with the Sun; let her nor descend in theSouthern latitude, when she goeth out of the burning, neither let her be opposite to the Sun, nor deprived oflight, let her not be hindred by Mars, or Saturn.

Of the Observation of the fixt Stars, and of their Natures.There is the like consideration to be had in all things concerning the fixt stars. Know this that all the fixtstars are of the signification and nature of the seven Planets; but some are of the nature of one Planet, andsome of two. Hence as often as any Planet is joyned with any of the fixt stars of its own nature, thesignification of that star is5 made more powerful, and the nature of the Planet augmented: but if it be a starof two natures, the nature of that which shall be the stronger with it shall overcome in signification; as forexample, if it be of the nature of Mars, and Venus; if Mars shall be the stronger with it, the nature of Marsshall overcome; but if Venus, the nature of Venus shall overcome. Now the natures of fixt stars arediscovered by their colours, as they agree with certain Planets, and are ascribed to them. Now the colours ofthe Planets are these: of Saturn, blew [blue], and leaden, and shining with this: of Jupiter citrine neer to apaleness, and clear with this; of Mars, red, and fiery; of the Sun, yellow, and when it riseth red, afterwardglittering: of Venus, white and shining; white with the morning, and reddish in the evening: of Mercury,glittering; of the Moon, fair. Know also that of the fixed stars by how much the greater, and the brighter andapparent they are, so much the greater and stronger is the signification; such are these stars which are calledby the Astrologers of the first, and second Magnitude. I will tell thee some of these which are more potent tothis faculty, as are viz. the Navel of Andromeda in two and twentieth degree of Aries, of the nature of Venus,& Mercury; some call it Jovial, & Saturnine. The head of Algol in the eighteenth degree of Taurus, of thenature of Saturn and Jupiter. The Pleiades are also in the two and twentieth degree, a Lunary star by Natureand by complexion Martial. Also in the third degree of Gemini is Aldeboram [Aldeboran], of the nature ofMars, and complexion of Venus: but Hermes placeth this in the twenty fifth degree of Aries. The Goat staris in the thirteenth degree of the said Gemini, of the nature of Jupiter, and Saturn; the greater Dog star is inthe seventh degree of Cancer, and Venereal: the lesser Dog-star is in the seventeenth degree of the same,and is of the nature of Mercury, and complexion of Mars. The Kings star, which is called the Heart of theLion, is in the one and twentieth degree of Leo, and of the nature of Jupiter and Mars; the tail of the greaterBear is in the nineteenth degree of Virgo, and is Venereal, and Lunary. The Star which is called the rightwing of the Crow is in the seventh degree of Libra, and in the thirteenth degree of the same is the left wingof the same, and both of the nature of Saturn and Mars. The Star called Spica is in the sixteenth degree ofthe same, and is Venereal and Mercurial. In the seventeenth degree of the same is Alcameth, of the nature ofMars, and Jupiter; but of this when the Suns aspect is full towards it; of that when on the contrary.

For Celestial bodies, in as much as they are affected fortunately, or unfortunately, so muchdo they affect us, our works, and those things which we use, fortunately, or unhappily. And although manyeffects proceed from the fixt Stars, yet they are attributed to the Planets, as because being more neer to us,and more distinct and known, so because they execute whatsoever the superior Stars communicate to them.Chap. xxxii. Of the Sun, and Moon, and their Magicall considerations.The Sun, and Moon have obtained the administration or ruling of the Heavens, and all bodies under theheavens. The Sun is the Lord of all Elementary vertues, and the Moon by vertue of the Sun is the mistress ofgeneration, increase, or decrease. Hence Albumasar saith, that by the Sun and Moon life is infused into allthings, which therefore Orpheus cals the enlivening eyes of the heaven.

Hence theancient Naturalists called the Sun the very heart of heaven; and the Caldeans [Chaldaeans] put it as themiddle of the Planets. The Egyptians also placed it in the middle of the world, viz. betwixt the two fives ofthe world, i.e. above the Sun they place five Planets, and under the Sun, the Moon and four Elements. For itis amongst the other Stars the image and statue of the great Prince of both worlds, viz. Terrestiall, andCelestiall; the true light, and the most exact image of God himself; whose Essence resembles the Father,Light the Son, Heat the Holy Ghost. So that the Platonists have nothing to hold forth the Divine Essencemore manifestly by, then this. So great is the consonancy of it to God, that Plato cals it the conspicuous Sonof God, and Iamblicus [Iamblichus] cals it the divine image of divine intelligence. And our Dionysius cals itthe perspicuous statue of God. It fits as King in the middle of other Planets, excelling all in light, greatness,fairness, enlightning [enlightening] all, distributing vertue to them to dispose inferior bodies, and regulatingand disposing of their motions, so that from thence their motions are called daily, or nightly, Southern, orNorthern, Orientall, or Occidentiall, direct, or retrograde; and as it doth by its light drive away all thedarkness of the night, so also all powers of darkness, which we read of in Job; Assoon as morning appears,they think of the shadow of death: And the Psalmist speaking of the Lyons [lion's] whelps seeking leave ofGod to devour, saith, The Sun is risen, and they are gathered together, and shall be placed in their dens;which being put to flight, it followes, Man shall go forth to his labor. The Sun therefore as it possesseth themiddle Region of the world, and as the heart is in Animals to the whole body, So the Sun is over the heaven,and the world, ruling over the whole Universe, and those things which are in it, the very author of seasons,from whence day and year, cold and heat, and all other qualities of seasons; and as saith Ptolomy, when itcomes unto the place of any Star, it stirs up the power thereof which it hath in the Aire. So as with Mars,heat; with Saturn, cold; and it disposeth even the very spirit and mind of man, from hence it is said byHomer, and approved by Aristotle, that there are in the mind such like motions, as the Sun the Prince andmoderator of the Planets every day bringeth to us; but the Moon, the nighest to the Earth, the receptacle ofall the heavenly Influences, by the swiftness of her course is joyned to the Sun, and the other Planets andStars, every month, and being made as it were the wife of all the Stars, is the most fruitful of the Stars, andreceiving the beams and influences of all the other planets and Stars as a conception, bringing them forth tothe inferior world as being next to it self; for all the Stars have influence on it being the last receiver, whichafterwards communicateth the influences ot all the superiors to these inferiors, and pours them forth on theEarth; and it more manifestly disposeth these inferiors then the others, and its motion is more sensible by thefamiliarity and propinquity which it hath with us; and as a medium betwixt both, superiors and inferiors,communicateth them to them all; Therefore her motion is to be observed before the others, as the parent ofall conceptions, which it diversely issueth forth in these Inferiors, according to the diverse complexion,motion, situation, and different aspects to the planets and others Stars; and though it receiveth powers fromall the Stars, yet especially from the Sun; as oft as it is in conjunction with the same, it is replenished withvivifying vertue, and according to the aspect thereof it borroweth its complexion; for in the first quarter, asthe Peripatetickes deliver, it is hot and moist; in the second hot and dry; in the third, cold and dry; in thefourth cold and moist; and although it is the lowest of the stars, yet it bringeth forth all the conceptions ofthe superiors; for from it in the heavenly bodies beginneth that series of things which Plato calleth theGolden Chain, by the which every thing and cause being linked one to an other, do depend on the superior,even untill it may be brought to the supreme cause of all, from which all things depend; from hence is it,that without the Moon intermediating, we cannot at any time attract the power of the superiors.

Of the twenty eight Mansions of the Moon, and theirvertues.And seeing the Moon measureth the whole Zodiack in the space of twenty eight dayes; hence is it, thatthe wise-men of the Indians and ancientest Astrologians have granted twenty eight Mansions to the Moon,which being fixed in the eight sphere, do enjoy (as Alpharus saith) diverse names and proprieties from thediverse Signs and Stars which are contained in them, through which while the Moon wandreth, it obtainethother and other powers and vertues; but every one of these Mansions, according to the opinion of Abraham,containth [sic] twelve degrees, and one and fifty minutes, and almost twenty six seconds, whose names andalso their beginnings in the Zodiack of the eight sphere, are these. The first is called Alnath, that is thehorns of Aries; his beginning is from the head of Aries of the eighth sphere; it causeth discords, andjournies; the second is called Allothaim or Albochan, that is the belly of Aries, and his beginning is fromthe twelfth degree of the same sign, fifty one minutes, twenty two seconds compleat; it conduceth to thefinding of treasures, and to the retaining of captives; The third is called Achaomazon or Athoray, that is,showring or Pleiades; his beginning is from the twenty five degrees of Aries compleat fourty two minutes,and fifty one seconds; it is profitable to Saylors [sailors], Huntsmen, and Alchymists; The fourth Mansion iscalled Aldebaram or Aldelamen that is the eye or head of Taurus; his beginning is from the eight degree ofTaurus, thirty four minutes, and seventeen seconds of the same Taurus being excluded; it causeth thedestruction and hindrances of buildings, fountains, wels, of gold-mines, the flight of creeping things, andbegetteth discord.

And so is one quarter of the heaven compleatedin these seven Mansions; and in the like order and number of degrees, minutes and seconds, the remainingMansions in evert quarter have their severall beginnings; namely so, that in the first signe of this quarterthree Mansions take their beginnings, in the other two signs two Mansions in each; Therefore the sevenfollowing Mansions begin from Cancer, whose names are Alnaza or Anatrachya that is misty or cloudy,viz. the eighth Mansion; it causeth love, friendship, and society of fellow travellers, it driveth away miceands afflicteth Captives, confirming their imprisonment. After this is the ninth called Archaam or Arcaph,that is the eye of the Lyon; it hindreth Harvests and travellers, and putteth discord between men. The tenth iscalled Algelioche or Albgebh, that is the neck or forehead of Leo; it strengtheneth buildings, yeeldeth love,benevolence and help against enemies; the eleventh is called Azobra or Ardaf, that is, the hair of the Lyons[lion's] head; it is good for voyages, and gain by merchandize, and for redemption of Captives; the twelfth iscalled Alzarpha or Azarpha, that is the tayle of Leo; it giveth prosperity to Harvests, and Plantations, buthindreth Seamen, but it is good for the bettering of servants, Captives and companions.

Of the true motion of the heavenly bodies to be observedin the eight sphere, and of the ground of Planetary hours.Whosoever will work according to the Celestiall opportunity, ought to observe both or one of them, namelythe motion of the Stars, or their times; I say their motions, when they are in their dignities or dejections,either essential or accidentall; but I call their times, dayes and hours distributed to their Dominions.Concerning all these, it is abundantly taught in the books of Astrologers; but in this place two thingsespecially are to be considered and observed by us. One that we observe the motions and ascensions andwindings of Stars, even as they are in truth in the eight sphere, through the neglect of which it happeneththat many err in fabricating the Celestiall Images, and are defrauded of their desired effect; the other thingwe ought to observe, is about the times of choosing the planetary hours; for almost all Astrologers divide allthat space of time from the Sun rising to setting into twelve equall parts, and call them the twelve hours ofthe day; then the time which followeth from the setting to the rising, in like manner being divided intotwelve equall parts, they call the twelve hours of the night, and then distribute each of those hours to everyone of the Planets according to the order of their successions, giving alwayes the first hour of the day to theLord of that day, then to every one by order, even to the end of twenty four hours; and in this distributionthe Magicians agree with them; but in the partition of the hours some do different, saying, that the space ofthe rising and setting is not to be divided into equall parts, and that those hours are not therefore calledunequal because the diurnal are unequal to the nocturnall, but because both the diurnal and nocturnal areHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

How some artificiall things as Images, Seals, and suchlike, may obtain some vertue from the Celestial bodies.So great is the extent, power and efficacy of the Celestiall bodies, that not only naturall things, but alsoartificiall when they are rightly esposed to those above, do presently suffer by that most potent agent, andobtain a wondefull life, which oftentimes gives them an admirable Celestiall vertue; which thing SaintThomas Aquinas that holy Doctor, thus confirmeth in his book de fæto, when he saith, that even garments,buildings and other artificiall works whatsoever, do receive a certain qualification from the Stars; so theMagicians affirm, that not only by the mixture and application of naturall things, but also in Images, Seals,Rings, Glasses, and some other Instruments, being opportunely framed under a certain constellation, someCelestiall Illustration may be taken, and some wonderfull thing may be received; for the beams of theCelestiall bodies betng animated, living, sensuall, and bringing along with them admirable gifts, and a mostviolent power, do, even in a moment, and at the first touch, imprint wonderfull powers in the Images,though their matter be less capable. Yet they bestow more powerfull vertues on the Images, if they beframed not of any, but of a certain matter, namely whose naturall, and also specificall vertue is agreeablewith the work, and the figure of the image is like to the Celestial; for such an Image, both in regard of thematter naturally congruous to the operation and Celestiall influence, and also for its figure being like to theHeavenly one, is best prepared to receive the operations and powers of the Celestiall bodies and figures, andinstantly receiveth the Heavenly gift into it self; then it constantly worketh on another thing, and otherthings do yeeld obedience to it. Hence saith Ptolemy in centiloquio, that inferior things do obey theCelestiall, and not only them, but also even their Images; Even as earthly Scorpions obey not only theCelestiall Scorpion, but also his Image, if it shall be opportunely figured under his ascent and Dominion.Chap. xxxvi. Of the Images of the Zodiack, what vertues they beingingraven, receive from the stars.But the Celestial Images, according to whose likeness Images of this kinde are framed, are very many in theheavens: Some visible and conspicuous, others onely imaginable, conceived and set down by Egyptians,Indians and Chaldeans [Chaldaeans]; and their parts are so ordered, that even the figures of some of themare distinguished from others: for this reason they place in the Zodiack circle twelve general images,according to the number of the signs: of these they constituting Aries, Leo, and Sagittary for the fiery andoriental triplicity, do report that its profitable against Feavors [fevers], Palsie [palsy], Drosie, Gout, and allcold and phlegmatick infirmities, and that it makes him who carrieth it to be acceptable, eloquent, ingeniousand honorable, because they are the Houses of Mars, Sol, and Jupiter. They made also the image of a Lionagainst melancholy phantasies, the Dropsie, Plague, Feavors [fevers], and to expel diseases, at the hour ofthe Sun, the first degree of the sign of Leo ascending, which is the face and Decanate of Jupiter; but againstthe Stone, and diseases of the Reins, and against the hurts of beasts, they made the same image when Sol inthe heart of the Lion obtained the midst of heaven: and again, because Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius doconstitute the Aerial and Occidental Triplicity, and are the houses of Mercury, Venus, and Saturn, they aresaid to put to flight diseases, to conduce to friendship and concord, to prevail against melancholy, and tocause health; & they report that Aquarius especially freeth from the Quartane [quartan].

Venusobtaining some Angle may be powerfull and occidentall; let Mars be combust by the Sun, but let it not havean aspect on Saturn and Mercury; for they said, that the splendor of the powers of these Stars was diffusedupon this Image, and it did speak with men, and declare those things which are profitable for them.Chap. xxxix.

Of Images, the figure whereof is not after the likeness of anyCelestiall figure, but after the likness of that which the mind of theworker desires.There remains as yet an other manner of images not according to the similitude of Celestiall figures, butaccording to the similitude of that which the mind of the worker desires, of whose they are the effigies, andrepresentation: So to procure love we make images embracing one the other: to discord, striking one theother; to bring misery, or destruction as dammage [damage] to a man, or house, or City or any thing else, wemake images distorted, broken in members, and parts after the likeness and figure of that thing which wewould destroy or damnifie; And Magicians advise us that in casting or engraving images we would writeupon it the name of the effect; and this on the back when evill, as destruction; on the belly when good, aslove. Moreover in the forehead of the image let be written the name of the species or Individuum which theimage represents, or for whom or against whom it is made. Also on the breast let the name of the signe orface ascending, and Lord thereof be written; also the names and Characters of its Angles. Moreover inmaking the image they advise that prayer for the effect for which it is made, be used. All which AlbertusMagnus in his Speculo affirms.

For they say as the workers of the images do affect the image it self, so doth itbring the like passions upon those to whom it was ascribed, as the mind of the operator hath dictated it. Aswe read that Nectanabus the Magician made images of ships with wax after that manner, and art that whenhe drowned those images in water, that the ships of his enemies were in like maner drowned in the Sea, andhazarded. Now that part of Astrology which is writ concerning elections, teacheth us that the constellationsalso are to be observed for the making of images, and such like.Chap. l. Of certain Celestial observations and the practise of someImages.I will now shew thee the observation of Celestiall bodyes, which are required for the practise of some ofthese kind of images; So to make any one fortunate, we make an image in which these are fortunate, viz. thesignificator of the life thereof, the givers of life, the signs, and Planets. Moreover let the ascendent, themiddle of the heaven, and the Lords thereof be fortunate: also the place of the Sun, and place of the Moon;part of fortune, and Lord of conjunction or prevention made before their nativity, by depressing theMalignant Planets. But if we will make an image to procure misery, we must do contrarywise, and thosewhich we place here fortunate, must there be infortunate, by raising malignant Stars. In like manner must wedo to make any place, Region, City, or house fortunate. Also for destroying or prejudicing any of theforesaid; Let there be made an image under the ascension of that man whom thou wouldst destroy, andprejudice, and thou shall make unfortunate, the Lord of the house of his life, the Lord of the ascending, andthe Moon, the lord of the house of the Moon, and the lord of the house of the lord ascending, and the tenthhouse, and the lord thereof. Now for the fitting of any place, place fortunes in the ascendent thereof; and inthe first, and tenth, and second, and eighth house, thou shall make the lord of the ascendent, and the lord ofthe house of the Moon fortunate. But to chase away certain Animals from certain places, that they may notbe generated, or abide there, let there be an image made under the ascension of that Animal, which thouwouldst chase away, and after the likeness thereof; as if thou wouldest chase away Scorpions from any place,let an image of the Scorpion be made, the sign of Scorpio ascending with the Moon, and thou shalt makeunfortunate the ascendent, and lord thereof, and the Lord of the house of Mars; and thou shall makeunfortunate the lord of the ascendent in the eighth house, and let them be joyned with an aspect malignant,opposite, or quadrant: and let there be writ upon the image the name of the ascendent, of the Lord thereof,and of the Moon, and of the lord of the day, and of the Lord of the hour. And let there be a pit made in themiddle of the place, from which thou wouldst drive them; and let there be carryed into it, some of the earthtaken out of the four corners of the same place, and let the image be buryed there with the head downward,with saying, this is the burying of the Scorpions, that they may not come into this place, and so of the rest. Sofor gain let there be made an image under the ascendent of the nativity of the man, or under the ascension ofthat place to which thou wouldest appoint the gain; and thou shall make the lord of the second house, whichis in the house of substance to be joyned with the Lord of the ascendent in the trine or sextil, and let there bea reception amongst them; thou shall make fortunate the eleventh and the Lord thereof, and the eighth; and ifthou canst, put part of the fortune in the ascendent, or second; and let the image be buryed in that place, orcarryed from that place, to which thou wouldest appoint the gain. Also for concord, and love, let there be animage made in the day of Jupiter under the ascendent of the nativity of him whom thou wouldst have bebeloved, make fortunate the ascendent, and the tenth, and hide the evil from the ascendent; and thou musthave the Lord of the tenth, and planets of the eleveneth fortune, joyned to the Lord of the ascendent, from thetrine or sextil with reception; then make an other image for him whom thou wouldest stir up to love; considerif he be a friend, or companion of him whom thou wouldst have be beloved; and if so, let there be an imagemade under the ascension of the eleventh house from the ascendent of the first image; but if the party be awife, or a husband, let it be made under the ascension of the seventh; if a brother, or a sister, or a cousin, letit be made under the ascension of the third, and so of the like; and put the significator of the ascendent of thesecond image, joyned to the significator of the ascendent of the first image; and let there be betwixt them areception, and let the rest be fortunate, as in the first image; afterwards joyn both images together into aHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

That no Divination without Astrology is perfect.We have spoken in the foregoing Chapters of the divers kindes of Divinations: But this is to be noted that allthese require the use and rules of Astrology, as a key most necessary for the knowledge of all secrets; andthat all kinds of Divinations whatsoever have their root and foundation in Astrologie so, as that without itthey are of little or no use; yet Astrological Divination, in as much as the Celestials are causes and signs ofall those things which are, and are done in these inferiors, doth give most certain demonstrations by thesituation, and motion onely of Celestial bodies, of those things which are occult or future; of which we shallin this place speak no further, since of this Science huge Volums have been wrote by the Ancients, and areeverywhere extant. Therefore whether the Physiognomists look upon the body, or countenance of forehead,or hand, or the Soothsayer, searcheth by dreams or Auspicia, that the judgment may be right, the figure ofheaven is also to be enquired into. From the judgements whereof, together with conjectures of similitudesand signs, are produced true opinions of the significators. Also if any prodigie shall appear, the Figure of theheaven is to be erected; also such things are to be enquired after, which have gone before in the revolutionsof years from great conjunctions, and Eclipses: then also the Nativities, beginnings, intronizations,foundations, and revolutions, perfections, directions of Princes, Nations, Kingdoms, Cities, when these shallappear, and upon what place of the Celestial figure these fell; that by all these at length we may come to arational and probable signification of these things. After the same manner, but with less labour, we mustproceed in the Expofition of dreams. Moreover, they that being distempered foretell future things, do it notbut as they are instigated by the stars, or inferior instruments of these, whence their Predictions must atlength be imputed to the Celestials, as we read in Lucan the old Prophet Tuscus,The Light'nings motion, and the veines which areFibrous, and warm, and motion of a fairPlume wandring i'th aire, being taught -----After the City was viewed, the Sacrifice slain, the inspection into the intrals did at length by the dispositionsof the Celestial stars pronounce judgement. Also Geornancy it self the most accurate of Divinations, whichdivines by points of the earth, or any other superfices, or by a fall, or any other power inscribed, doth firstreduce them to Celestial figures, viz. to those sixteen which we above named, making judgement after anAstrological manner, by the properties and observations thereof: and hither are referred all naturalDivinations by lots whatsoever, the power whereof can be from no where else then from the heaven, andfrom the minde of them that work them. For whatsoever is moved, caused or produced in these inferiors,Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy. Book II.

Hence Dice, Tetracedron[tetrahedron], Exacedron, Octocedron, Doderacedron [dodecahedron], Icocedron being made by certainNumbers, Signs, and Stars at opportune times, under the influencies of the Celestials, and being inscribed,obtain a wonderful vertue of Divining, and foretelling by their castings, such as those Dice Preneste had, inwhich we read the Destinies of the Romans were contained.Chap. liv. Of Lottery, when, and whence the vertue of Divining isincident to it.Whatsoever Divinations and Predictions of humane events are made by Lottery, must of necessity, besidesthe lot, have some sublime occult cause; which indeed shall not be a cause by accident, such as Aristotledescribes Fortune to be. For in the series of Causes, seeing according to the Platonists, a cause by accidentcan never be the prime and sufficient cause, we must look higher, and finde out a cause which may know andintend the effect. Now this we must not place in corporeal Nature, but in immaterial, and incorporealsubstances which indeed administer the Lot, and dispence [dispense] the signification of the truth, as in menssouls, or separated spirits, or in Celestial Intelligcnces, or in God himself. Now that there is in mans soul asufficient power and vertue to direct such kinde Of lots, it is hence manifest, because there is in our soul adivine vertue, and similitude, and apprehension, and power of all things; And as we said in the first Book,All things have a natural obedience to it, and of necessity have a motion and efficacy to that which the souldesires with a strong desire; and all the vertues and operations of natural and artifical things, obey it when itis carried forth into the excess of desire, and then all Lots of what kinde soever are assisting to the appetite ofsuch a minde, and acquire to themselves wonderful vertues of passages, as from that, so from the Celestialopportunity in that hour in which the excess of such a like appetite doth most of all exeeed in it. And this isthat ground and foundation of all Astrological questions, wherefore the minde being elevated into the excessof any desire, taketh of it self an hour and opportunity most convenient and efficacious, on which the Figureof the heaven being made, the Astrologer may then judge in it, and plainly know concerning that which anyone desires, and is inquisitive to know. But now because Lots are not directed alwayes by mans minde, butalso, as we said before, by the help of other Spirits; nor is the minde of a Prophet alwayes disposed to thatexcess of passion as we spoke of: hence amongst the Ancients, it was a Custome to premise before thecasting of the Lot, some sacred performances, in which they called upon divine Intelligencies and spirits forto direct the Lot aright. Whatsoever kinde of presage therefore these kinde of Lots portend, must of necessitynot be by chance or fortune, but from a spiritual cause, by vertue whereof the Phantasie, or hand of him thatcast the Lot is moved, whether that power proceed from the soul of the Operator through the great excess ofhis affection, or from a Celestial influence, and oppotunity, or from a certain Diety or spirit assisting, ormoving from on high, whether these Lots are placed in casting of Cockalls, or throwing of Dice, or in themeeting of Verses, such as were formerly the Lot of Homer and Virgil, of which we read in Ælius of Sparta,Hadrianus long since made enquiry, and which we read befell Trajanus the Emperour.What's he far off grac'd with the Olive boughPresenting offerings? how white chin we know,A Roman King, whose laws first setled Rome,And from small Curets a poor soyl [soil] shall comeTo great command -----Be which Verses he did not in vain become to have hopes of enjoying the Empire. Also amongst Hebrews,and even amongst us Christians (some Divines not dispproving of it) Lots are taken out of Verses of Psalms.There are also more, & other kindes of Lots, as are humane Lots, which had no Divination in them amongstthe Ancients, and are observed by as in choosing of Magistrates, to prevent envy, of which also Ciceroagainst Verres makes mention: but they are not of our purpose: But those which are divine, and sacred Lots,respecting Oracles, and Religion, of which we shall discourse in the following Book: Onely thus far I wouldadvise you, that how much presaging, divining or Southsaying [soothsaying] soever Lots are found to have,Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Of the soul of the World, and of the Celestials, according tothe traditions of the Poets, and Philosophers.It is necessity that the heaven and Celestial bodies, seeing they have a power, influence, and manifestoperation upon these inferiors, should be animated: seeing an operition cannot proceed from a meer body.All famous Poets, and Philosophers affirm therefore that the world and all Celestiall bodies must have a soul,and that also intelligent: Hence Marcus Mavillius in his Astronomy to Augustus, sings,The great Corporeall world, which doth appearIn divers forms, of Aire, Earth, Sea, and Fire,A divine soul doth rule, a DietyDoth wisely govern -----Also Lucan,The Earth that's weigh'd i'th aire, 's sustainedBy great Jove -----And BoetiusThou dost joyn to the worl a soul, that movesAll things of threefold nature, and diffuseIt through the members of the same, and thisInto two Orbs of motion rounded isBeing divided, and for to returnInto it self makes haste -----And Virgil most full of all Philosophy, sings thus,And first the Heaven, Earth, and liquid plain,The Moons bright Globe, and Stars TitanianA spirit fed within, spread through the wholeAnd with the huge heap mix'd infused a soul;Hence man, and beastsm and birds derive their strain,And monsters floating in the marbled main;These seeds have fiery vigor, and a birthOf heavenly race, but clog'd with heavy earth.For what do these verses seem to mean, then that the world should not only have a spirit soul, but also topartake of the divine mind: and that the originall, vertue, and vigour of all inferiour things do depend on thesoul of the world? This do all Platonists, Pythagorians, Orpheus, Trismegistus, Aristotle, Theophrastus,Avicen, Algazeles, and all Peripateticks confess, and confirm.Chap. lvi. The same is confirmed by reason.The world, the heavens, the Stars, and the Elements have a soul, with which they cause a soul in theseinferior and mixed bodies. They have also as we said in the former book, a spirit, which by the mediating ofthe soul is united to the body: For as the world is a certain whole body, the parts whereof are the bodies of allliving creatures, and by how much the whole is more perfect and noble then the parts, by so much moreperfect, and noble is the body of the world then the bodies of each living thing. It would be absurd, that allimperfect bodies and parts of the world, and every base Animal, as Flies, and Worms should be worthy of alife, and have a life and soul, and the whole entire world a most perfect, whole, and most noble body, shouldHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Neither could Elements generate and nourishsuch kind of living creatures, if they themselves were without life or soul. But some haply may say, that suchkind of living creatures are not generated by the soul of the earth, or water, but by the influencies ofCelestiall souls; These the Platonists answer, that an Accident cannot beget a substance, unless haply as aninstrument it be subjected to the next substance, because an instrument removed from an artificer is notmoved to the effect of the art; so also those Celestiall influencies, seeing they are certain accidents beingremoved far from vital substances, or from the life it self, cannot generate a vital substance in these inferiors.And Mercurius in his book which he cals De Communi, saith, All that is in the world is moved either byincrease, or decrease. Now what moves, must needs have life; and seeing that all things move, even the earth,especially with a generative and alterative motion, they must themselves live. And if any doubt that theheavens live, saith Theophrastus, he is not to be accounted a Philosopher; and he which denyes the heaven tobe animated, so that the mover thereof is not the form thereof, destroyes the foundation of all Philosophy;The World therefore lives, hath a soul, and sense; for it gives life to plants, which are not produced of seed;and it gives sense to Animals, which are not generated by coition.Chap. lvii. That the soul of the world, and the Celestiall souls arerationall, and partake of Divine understanding.That the above named souls have reason, is apparent hence; For whereas the universall works of the foresaidsouls do with a certain perpetuall order conspire amongst themselves, it is necessary that they be governednot by chance but by reason; by which reason they do direct, & bring all their operations to a certainty. For itis necessary that the earth should have the reason of terrene things, and water of watery things; and so in therest; by which reason each in their time, place, and order are generated, and being hurt are repaired.Therefore Philosophers do not think the soul of the earth to be at it were the soul of some contemptible body,but to be rationall and also intelligent, yea and to be a diety. Besides it would be absurd, seeing we havereasons of our works, that Celestiall souls, and the soul of the universe should not have reasons of theirs. Butif (as saith Plato) the world be made by very goodness it self, as well as it could be made, it is certainlyendowed with not only life, sense, and reason, but also understanding. For the perfection of a body is its soul,and that body is more perfect which hath a more perfect soul; It is necessary therefore, seeing Celestiallbodies are more perfect, that they have also most perfect minds. They partake therefore of an intellect and aminde; which the Platonists also prove by the perseverance of their order, and tenor, because motion is of itsnature free, it may easily swarve, and wander now one way, now another, unless it were ruled by an intellectand a mind, and that also by a perfect mind foreseeing from the beginning the best way, and chief end.Which perfect mind indeed, becaue it is most powerfull in the soul, as is the soul, and as are the souls ofCelestiall bodies, and of Elements, without all doubt doth most orderly, and perfectly govern the workallotted to it. For bodies do not resist a most powerfull soul, and a perfect mind doth not change its counsel.The soul of the world therefore is a certain only thing, filling all things, bestowing all things, binding, andknitting together all things, that it might make one frame of the world, and that it might be as it were oneinstrument making of many strings, but one sound, sounding from three kinds of creatures, intellectall,Celestiall, and incorruptible, with one only breath and life.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Of the names of the Celestials, and their rule over thisinferiour world, viz. Man.The names of Celestiall souls are very many, and diverse according to their manifold power and vertue uponthese inferior things, from whence they have received divers names, which the ancients in their hymnes andprayer made use of. Concerning which you must observe, that every one of these souls according toOrpheus's Divinity, is said to have a double vertue; the one placed in knowing, the other in vivifying, andgoverning its body. Upon this account in the Celestiall spheres, Orpheus cals the former vertue Bacchus, theother a Muse. Hence he is not inebriated by any Bacchus, who hath not first been coupled to his Muse.Therefore nine Bacchus's are designed about the nine Muses. Hence in the ninth sphere Orpheus putsBacchus Cribonius, and the Muse Calliope; in the starry heaven Picionius, and Urania; in the sphere ofSaturn, Amphietus, and Polyphymnia; in the sphere of Jupiter, Sabasius, and Terpsichore; in the sphere ofMars, Bassarius, and Clio; in the sphere of the Sun, Trietericus, and Melpemene, in the sphere of Venus,Lysius, and Erato; in the sphere of Mercury, Silenus, and Euterpe; in the sphere of the Moon, Bacchus,Lyeus, and the Muse Thalia. Also in the spheres of the Elements, he names the souls after this manner. In thefire he puts the planet, and the morning; in the air lightening [lightning] Jupiter, and Juno; in water theOcean, and Thetys; in the earth Pluto, and Proserpina; but the soul of the world or universe Magicians callthe Jupiter of the world, and the mind of the world Apollo, and the nature of the world, Minerva. Besides inthe fire they put Vulcan, in the water Neptune, and they did name them by divers names. Also in the Stars ofthe Zodiack the Pythagorians did put twelve particular Gods or souls placed in the hearts of those Stars, andthence governing the whole Star, viz. in the heart of Aries is placed a particular Pallas, in the heart of Taurusa particular Venus, of Gemini a particular Phebus, of Cancer Mercury, of Leo Jupiter, of Virgi Ceres, ofLibra Vulcan, of Scorpio Mars, of Sagittarius Diana, of Capricorn Vesta, of Aquarius a particular Juno, inthe heart of Pisces a particular Neptune: This did Manilius sing forth in these verses.Pallas doth rule the Ram, Venus the Bull,Phebus the Twins, and Mercury doth ruleThe Cancer, and the Lyon [The Lion, i.e. Leo] guides doth Jove,Ceres doth Virgo, Vulcan Libra move.For Scorpion Mars; for Sagittarius faireDiana cares; for Capricorn doth careVesta; Aquarius Juno doth protect;And Neptune Pisces -----And most ancient Orpheus writing to Muscus, reckons up more Dieties of the heavens then these, signifyingtheir names, respects, and duties, calling them all in proper songs. Let no one therefore think that they are thenames of evill deceiving spirits; but of naturall, and divine vertues, distributed to the world by the true God,for the service, and profit of man, who knew how to use them: and antiquity it self hath ascribed to each ofthese Dieties the severall members of man; as the ear to memory, which Virgil also dedicates to Phebus,saying, Cynthius puls my ear, and admonisheth me. So the right hand being a token of fortitude, & by whichan oath is made, Numa Pompilius, as saith Livy, hath dedicated to faith: The fingers are under the tuition ofMinerva, and the knees given to Mercifullness; Hence they that beg pardon bend them. Some dedicate theNavell to Venus as the place of luxury; some who refer all the members to it as the center, say it is dedicatedto Jupiter Hence in the Temple of Jupiter Hammon the effigies of a navel is celebrated. Many other thingsthe ancients did observe, ascribing every little member and joynt to their Dieties, which if they be rightlyunderstood, and the true Dieties ruling over them known, would not at all swerve from their duty, seeing alsosacred writ testifies that all our members are governed by the superior vertues, of which we shall speak morelargely in the following book; and not members only, but every exercise of men is distributed to its Dietie[diety], as huntings to Diana, wars to Pallas, husbandry to Ceres, of which thus speaks Apollo in his Oraclesin Porphyrie [Porphyry].Pallas loves wars, woods to Diana fairAscribed are, to Juno humid Aire,Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

Therefore the Athenians called him Alexicacon, and Homer Vlion, i.e. the driver away ofevil things. He is also called Phæbus from his beauty and brightness, and Vulcan from his fiery violence,because the force thereof consists of many fires. He is also called the Sun, because he contains the light of allthe Stars: hence he is called by the Assyrians êàãà Adad, which signifies only, and by the Hebrews ùîùSchemesch, which signifies proper.

That humane imprecations do naturally impress their powersupon externall things; And how mans mind through each degree ofdependencies ascends into the intelligible world, and becomes like tothe more sublime spirits, and Intelligencies.The Celestiall souls send forth their vertues to the Celestial bodies, which then transmit them to this sensibleworld. For the vertues of the terrene orb proceed from no other cause then Celestiall. Hence the Magicianthat will worke by them, useth a cunning invocation of the superiors, with mysterious words, and a certainkind of ingenious speech, drawing the one to the other, yet by a naturall force through a certain mutuallagreement betwixt them, whereby things follow of their own accord, or sometimes are drawn unwillingly.Hence saith Aristotle in the sixth book of his Mysticall Philosophy, that when any one by binding orbewitching doth call upon the Sun or other stars, praying them to be helpfull to the work desired, the Sun andother Stars do not heare his words, but are moved after a certain manner by a certain conjunction, andmutuall series, whereby the parts of the world are mutually subordinate the one to the other, and have amutuall consent, by reason of their great union: As in mans body one member is moved by perceiving themotion of another, and in a harp one string is moved at the motion of another. So when any one moves anypart of the world; other parts are moved by the perceiving the motion of that. The knowledge therefore of thedependency of things following one the other, is the foundation of all wonderfull operation, which isnecessarily required to the exercising the power of attracting superior vertues. Now the words of men arecertain naturall things, and because the parts of the world mutually draw one the other, therefore a Magicianinvocating by words, works by powers fitted to nature, by leading some by the love of one to the other, ordrawing others by reason of the following of one after the other, or by repelling by reason of the enmity ofone to the other, from the contrariety, and difference of things, and multitude of vertues; which although theyare contrary, and different, yet perfect one part; sometimes also he compels things by way of authority, bythe Celestiall vertue, because he is not a stranger to the heaven. A man therefore, if he receives theimpression of any ligation, or fascination, doth not receive it according to the rationall soul, but sensuall, andif he suffers in any part, suffers according to the Animall part. For they cannot draw a knowing andintelligent man by reason, but by receiving that impression and force by sense, in as much as the Animalspirit of man is by the influence of the Celestials, and cooperation of the things of the world, affected beyondHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.

As the son moves the father to labor, although unwilling, for to keep andmaintain him, although he be wearied; and the desire to rule is moved to anger and other labors, for to get thedominion. And the indigency of nature, and fear of poverty, moves a man to desire riches. And theornaments, and beauty of women is an incitement to concupiscence. And the harmony of a wise Musitian[musician] moves his hearers with various passions, whereof some do voluntary follow the consonancy ofart, others conform themselves by gesture, although unwillingly, because their sense is captivated, theirreason not being intent to these things. But these kinds of fascinations & ligations the vulgar doth neitheradmire, nor detest, by reason of their usualness: but they admire other naturall things, becaue they areignorant of them, and are not accustomed to them. Hence they fall into errors, thinking those things to beabove nature, or contrary to nature, which indeed are by nature, and according to nature. We must knowtherefore that every superior moves its next inferior, in its degree, and order, not only in bodies, but also inspirits. So the universall soul moves the particular soul; and the rational acts upon the sensual, and that uponthe vegetable; and every part of the world acts upon another, and every part is apt to be moved by another;and every part of this inferior world suffers from the heavens according to their nature, and aptitude, as onepart of the Animall body suffers from another. And the superior intellectuall world moves all things below itself, and after a manner contains all the same beings from the first to the last, which are in the inferior world.Celestiall bodyes therefore move the body of the elementary world, compounded, generable, sensible, fromthe circumference to the center, by superior, perpetual, and spirituall essences, depending on the primaryintellect, which is the acting intellect; but upon the vertue put in by the word of God, which word the wiseChaldeans of Babylon call the cause of causes, because from it are produced all beings, the acting intellectwhich is the second from it depends; and that by reason of the union of this word with the first author, fromwhom all things being are truely produced; The word therefore is the Image of God, the acting intellect theimage of the word, the soul is the image of this intellect; and our word is the image of the soul, by which itacts upon naturall things naturally, because nature is the work thereof. And every one of those perfects hissubsequent, as a father his son, and none of the latter exists without the former. For they are dependingamongst themselves, by a kind of ordinate dependency, so that when the latter is corrupted, it is returned intothat which was next before it, untill it come to the heavens, then unto the universall soul, and lastly unto theacting intellect, by which all other creatures exist, and which it self exists in the principall author, which isthe creating word of God, to which at length all things are returned. Our soul therefore, if it will work anywonderfull thing in these inferiors, must have respect to their beginning, that it may be strengthened, andillustrated by that, and receive power of acting through each degree from the very first author. Therefore wemust be more diligent in contemplating the souls of the Stars then their bodies, and the supercelestiall, andintellectuall world, then the Celestial corporeall, because that is more noble, although this be excellent, andthe way to that; and without which medium the influence of the superiour cannot be attained to. As forexample, the Sun is the King of Stars, most full of light, but receives it from the intelligible world above allother Stars, because the soul thereof is more capable of intelligible splendor. Wherefore he that desires toattract the influence of the Sun, must contemplate upon the Sun, not only by the speculation of the exteriorlight, but also of the interior. And this no man can do unless he return to the soul of the Sun, and become liketo it, and comprehend the intelligible light thereof with an intellectuall sight, as the sensible light with acorporeal eye. For this man shalbe filled with the light thereof; and the light thereof which is an under typeimpressed by the supernal Orb it receives into it self, with the illustration whereof his intellect beingendowed, & truely like to it, & being assisted by it shall at length attain to that supreme brightness, and to allforms that partake thereof. And when he hath received the light of the supreme degree, then his soul shallcome to perfection, and be made like to the spirits of the Sun, and shhall attain to the vertues, andillustrations of the supernaturall vertue, and shall enjoy the power of them, if he hath obtained faith in thefirst author. In the first place therefore we must implore assistance from the first author, and praying not onlywith mouth but a Religious gesture and supplicant soul, also abundantly, uncessantly, and sincerely, that hewould enlighten our mind, and remove darkness growing upon our souls by reason of our bodies.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Occult Philosophy.
