[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Eleventh BookOf the Common Mind to Tat1. The Mind, O Tat, is of the very Essence of God, if yet there be anyEssence of God.2. What kind of Essence that is, he alone knows himself exactly.3. The Mind therefore is not cut off, or divided from the essentiality ofGod, but united as the light of the sun.4. And this mind in men, is God, and therefore are some men Divine,and their Humanity is near Divinity.5. For the good Demon called the Gods immortal men, and menmortal Gods.6. But in the brute Beasts, or unreasonable living wights, the Mind istheir Nature.7. For where there is a Soul, there is the Mind, as where there is Life,there is also a Soul.8. In living Creatures therefore, that are without Reason, the Soul isLife, void of the perations of the Mind.9. For the Mind is the Benefactor of the Souls of men, and worketh tothe proper Good.10. And in unreasonable things it co-operateth with the Nature ofeveryone of them, but in men it worketh against their Natures.11. For the Soul being in the Body, is straightway made Evil bySorrow, and Grief and Pleasure or Delight.12. For Grief and Pleasure flow like Juices from the compound Body,whereinto, when the Soul entereth, or descendeth, she is moistenedand tincted with them."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"13. As many Souls therefore, as the Mind governeth or overruleth, tothem it shows its own Light, resisting their prepossessions orpresumptions.14. As a good Physician grieveth the Body, prepossessed of a disease,by burning or lancing it for health's sake.15. After the same manner also, the Mind grieveth the Soul, bydrawing it out of Pleasure, from whence every disease of the Soulproceedeth.16. But the great Disease of the Soul is Atheism because that opinionfolloweth to all Evil and no Good.17. Therefore the Mind resisting it procureth Good to the Soul, as aPhysician health to the Body.18. But as many Souls of Men, as do not admit or entertain the Mindfor their Governor, do suffer the same thing that the Soul ofunreasonable living things.19. For the Soul being a Co-operator with them, permits or leavesthem to their concupiscences, whereunto they are carried by thetorrent of their Appetite, and so tend to brutishness.20. And as Brute Beasts, they are angry without reason, and theydesire without reason, and never cease, nor are satisfied with evil.21. For unreasonable Angers and Desires, are the most exceedingEvils.22. And therefore hath God set the Mind over these, as a Revengerand Reprover of them.23. Tat: Here, O Father, that discourse of Fate or Destiny which thoumadest to me, is in danger to be overthrown; For if it be fatal for anyman to commit Adultery or Sacrilege or do any evil, he is punishedalso, though he of necessity do the work of Fate or Destiny."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"24. Hermes: All things, O Son, are the work of Fate, and without it,can no bodily thing, either Good or Evil, be done.25. For it is decreed by Fate, that he that cloth any evil, should alsosuffer for it.26. And therefore he cloth it, that he may suffer that which hesuffereth, because he did it.27. But for the present let alone that speech, concerning Evil andFate, for at other times we have spoken of it.28. Now our discourse is about the Mind, and what it can do, and howit differs, and is in men such a one, but in brute Beasts changed.29. And again, in Brute Beasts it is not beneficial, but in men byquenching both their Anger and Concupiscences.30. And of men thou must understand some to be rational orgoverned by reason, and some irrational.31. But all men are subject to Fate, and to Generation, and Changes,for these are the beginning and end of Fate or Destiny.32. And all men suffer those things that are decreed by Fate.33. But rational men, over whom as we said, the Mind bears rule, donot suffer like unto other men, but being free from viciousness, andbeing not evil, they do suffer evil.34. Tat: How sayest thou this again, Father? An Adulterer, is he notevil? a Murderer, is he not evil? And so all others.35. Hermes: But the rational man, O Son, will not suffer for Adultery,but as the Adulterer, nor for Murder, but as the Murderer.36. And it is impossible to escape the Quality of Change, as ofGeneration, but the Viciousness, he that hath the Mind, may escape."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"37. And therefore, O Son, I have always heard the good Demon say,and if he had delivered it in writing, he had much profited allmankind: For he alone, O Son. As the first born, God, seeing allthings, truly spake Divine words. I have heard him say sometimes,That all Things are one thing, Especially Intelligible Bodies, or that allEspecially Intelligible Bodies are one.38. We live in Power, in Act and in Eternity.39. Therefore a good Mind, is that which the Soul of him is.40. And if this be so, then no intelligible thing differs from intelligiblethings.41. As therefore it is possible, that the Mind, the Prince of all things;so likewise, that the Soul that is of God, can do whatsoever it will.42. But understand thou well, for this Discourse I have made to thequestion which thou askest of me before, I mean concerning Fate andthe Mind.43. First, if, O Son, thou shalt diligently withdraw thy self from allContentious speeches, thou shalt find that in Truth, the Mind, theSoul of God bears rule over all things, both over Fate and Law and allother things.44. And nothing is impossible to him, no not of the things that are ofFate.45. Therefore, though the Soul of man be above it, let it not neglectthe things that happen to be under Fate.46. And these thus far, were the excellent sayings of the good Demon.47. Tat. Most divinely spoken, O Father, and truly and profitably, yetclear this one thing unto me48. Thou sayest, that in brute Beasts the Mind worketh or acteth afterthe manner of Nature, co-operating also with their (impetus)inclinations."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"49. Now the impetuous inclinations of brute Beasts, as I conceive, arePassions. If therefore the Mind do co-operate with these impetuousInclinations, and that they are the Passions in brute Beasts, certainlythe Mind is also a Passion, conforming itself to Passions.50. Hermes: Well done, Son, thou askest nobly, and yet it is just that Ishould answer thee.51. All incorporeal things, O Son, that are in the Body, are possible,nay, they are properly Passions.52. Everything that moveth is incorporeal; everything that is moved isa Body, and it is moved into the Bodies by the Mind. Now motion isPassion, and there they both suffer; as well that which moveth, as thatwhich is moved, as well that which ruleth, as that which is ruled.53. But being freed from the Body, it is freed likewise from Passion.54. But especially, O Son, there is nothing impassible, but all thingsare passible.55. But Passion differs from that which is passible, for that (Passion)acteth but this suffers.56. Bodies also of themselves do act, for either they are unmovable, orelse are moved, and which soever it be, it is a Passion.57. But incorporeal things do always act, or work, and therefore theyare passible.58. Let not therefore the appellations or names trouble thee, forAction and Passion are the same thing, but that it is not grievous touse the more honourable name.59. Tat: O Father. Thou has delivered this Discourse most plainly.60. Hermes: Consider this also, O Son, That God hath freely bestowedupon man, above all other living things, these two, to wit, Mind andSpeech, or Reason, equal to immortality."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"61. These if any man use, or employ upon what he ought, he shalldiffer nothing from the Immortals.62. Yea, rather going out of the Body, he shall be guided and led bythem, both into the Choir and Society of the Gods, and blessed Ones.63. Tat: Do not other living Creatures use Speech, O Father?64. Hermes: No, Son, but only Voice; now Speech and Voice do differexceeding much; for Speech is common to all men, but Voice isproper unto every kind of living thing.65. Tat: Yea, but the Speech of men is different. O Father, every manaccording to his Nation.66. Hermes: It is true, O Son, they do differ: Yet as man is one so isSpeech one also; and it is interpreted and found the same, both inEgypt, Persia, and Greece.67. But thou seemest unto me, Son, to be ignorant of the Virtue orPower, and Greatness of Speech.68. For the blessed God, the good Demon said or commanded theSoul to be in the Body, the Mind, in the Soul, the Word, or Speech, orReason in the Mind, and the Mind in God, and that God is the Fatherof them all.69. Therefore the Word is the Image of the Mind, and the Mind ofGod, and the Body of the Idea, and the Idea of the Soul.70. Therefore of the Matter, the subtlest or smallest part is Air, of theAir the Soul, of the Soul the Mind, of the Mind God.71. And God is about all things, and through all things, but the Mindabout the Soul, the Soul about the Air, and the Air about the Matter.72. But Necessity, and Providence, and Nature, are the Organs orInstruments of the World, and of the Order of Matter."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"73. For of those things that are intelligible, every one is but theEssence of them in Identity.74. But of the Bodies of the whole, or universe, every one is manythings.75: For the Bodies that are put together, and that have, and maketheir changes into other, having this Identity, do always save andpreserve the uncorruption of the Identity.76. But in every one of the compound Bodies, there is a number.77. For without number it is impossible there should be consistenceor constitution, or composition, or dissolution.78. But Unities do both beget and increase Numbers, and again beingdissolved, come into themselves.79. And the Matter is One.80. But this whole World, the great God, and the Image of theGreater, and united unto him, and conserving the Order and Will ofthe Father, is the fullness of Life.81. And there is nothing therein, through all the Eternity of theRevolutions, neither of the whole, nor of the parts which cloth notlive.82. For there is nothing dead, that either hath been, or is, or shall bein the World.83. For the Father would have it as long as it lasts, to be a living thing;and therefore it must needs be God also.84, How therefore, O Son, can there be in God, in the Image of theUniverse, in the fullness of Life, any dead things?85. For dying is corruption, and corruption is destruction."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"86. How then can any part of the incorruptible be corrupted, or ofGod be destroyed?87. Tat: Therefore, O Father, do not the living things in the World die,though they be parts thereof.88. Hermes: Be wary in thy Speech, O Son, and not deceived in thenames of things.89. For they do not die, O Son, but as compound Bodies they aredissolved.90. But dissolution is not death; and they are dissolved, not that theymay be destroyed, but that they may be made new.91. Tat: What then is the operation of Life? Is it not Motion?92. Hermes: And what is there in the World unmovable? Nothing atall, O Son.93. Tat: Why, cloth not the Earth seem unmovable to thee, O Father?94. Hermes: No, but subject to many motions, though after a mannerit alone be stable.95. What a ridiculous thing it were, that the Nurse of all things shouldbe unmovable, which beareth and bringeth forth all things.96. For it is impossible, that anything that bringeth forth, shouldbring forth without Motion.97. And a ridiculous question it is, Whether the fourth part of thewhole, be idle: For the word immovable, or without Motion, signifiesnothing else, but idleness.98. Know generally, O Son, That whatsoever is in the World is movedeither according to Augmentation or Diminution.99. But that which is moved, liveth also, yet it is not necessary, that aliving thing should be or continue the same."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"100. For while the whole World is together, it is unchangeable, O Son,but all the parts thereof are changeable.101. Yet nothing is corrupted or destroyed, and quite abolished butthe names trouble men.102. For Generation is not Life, but Sense; neither is Change Death,but Forgetfulness, or rather Occultation, and lying hid. Or better thus.For Generation is not a Creation of Life, but a Production of Things toSense, and making them Manifest. Neither is Change Death, but anOccultation or Hiding of that which was.103. These things being so, all things are Immortal, Matter, Life,Spirit, Soul, Mind, whereof every living thing consisteth.104. Every living thing therefore is Immortal, because of the Mind,but especially Man, who both receiveth God, and converseth withhim.105. For with this living wight alone is God familiar; in the night bydreams, in the day by Symbols or; Signs.106. And by all things cloth he foretell him of things to come, byBirds, by Fowls, by the Spirit, or Wind, and by an Oak.107. Wherefore also Man professeth to know things that: have been,things that are present, and things to come.108. Consider this also, O Son, That every living Creature goeth uponone part of the World, Swimming things in Water, Land wights uponthe Earth, Flying Fowls in the Air.109. But Man useth all these, the Earth, the Water, the Air, and theFire, nay, he seeth and toucheth Heaven by his Sense.110. But God is both about all things, and through all things, for he isboth Act and Power.111. And it is no hard thing, O Son, to understand God."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"112. And if thou wilt also see him, look upon the Necessity of thingsthat appear, and the Providence of things that have been, and aredone.113. See the Matter being most full of Life, and so great a God movedwith all Good, and Fair, both Gods, and Demons, and Men.114. Tat: But these, O Father, are wholly Acts or Operations.115. Hermes: If they be therefore wholly Acts or Operations, O Son, bywhom are they acted or operated, but by God?116. Or art thou ignorant, that as the parts of the World, are Heaven,and Earth, and Water, and Air; after the same manner the Membersof God, are Life, and Immortality, and Eternity, and Spirit, andNecessity, and Providence, and Nature, and Soul, and Mind, and theContinuance or Perseverance of all these which is called Good.117. And there is not any thing of all that hath been, and al1 that is,where God is not.118. Tat: What in the Matter, O Father?119. Hermes: The Matter, Son, what is it without God, that thoushouldst ascribe a proper place to it?120. Or what cost thou think it to be? Peradventure some heap that isnot actuated or operated.121. But if it be actuated, by whom is it actuated? For we have said,that Acts or Operations, are the parts of God.122. By whom are all living things quickened? And the Immortal, bywhom are they immortalized? The things that are changeable, bywhom are they changed?123. Whether thou speak of Matter, or Body, or Essence, know that allthese are acts of God."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"124. And that the Act of Matter is materiality, and of the Bodiescorporality, and of Essence essentiality; and this is God the whole.125. And in the whole, there is nothing that is not God.126. Wherefore about God, there is neither Greatness, Place, Quality,Figure, or Time; for he is All, and the All, through all, and about all.127. This Word, O Son, worship and adore. And the only service ofGod, is not to be evil."}]
