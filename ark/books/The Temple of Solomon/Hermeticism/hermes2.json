[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Second Book\"Poemander\"1. My Thoughts being once seriously busied about the things that are,and my Understanding lifted up, all my bodily Senses beingexceedingly holden back, as it is with them that are very heavy ofsleep, by reason either of fullness of meat, or of bodily labour. Methought I saw one of an exceeding great stature, and an infinitegreatness call me by my name, and say unto me, \"What wouldest thouHear and See? Or what wouldest thou Understand, to Learn, andKnow!\"2. Then said I, \"Who art Thou?\"\"I am,\" quoth he, \"Poemander, the mind of the Great Lord, the mostMighty and absolute Emperor: I know what thou wouldest have, and Iam always present with thee.\"3. Then said I, \"I would Learn the Things that art, and Understandthe Nature of them and know God.\"\"How?\" said he. I answered, \"That I would gladly hear.'' Then he, \"Have me again in thy mind, and whatsoever thou wouldstlearn, I will teach thee.\"4. When he had thus said, he was changed in his Idea or Form andstraightway in the twinkling of an eye, all things were opened untome: and I saw an infinite Sight, all things were become light, bothsweet and exceedingly pleasant; and I was wonderfully delighted inthe beholding it.5. But after a little while, there was a darkness made in part, comingdown obliquely, fearful and hideous, which seemed unto me to bechanged into a Certain Moist Nature, unspeakably troubled, whichyielded a smoke as from fire; and from whence proceeded a voice"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"unutterable, and very mournful, but inarticulate, insomuch that itseemed to have come from the Light.6. Then from that Light, a certain Holy Word joined itself untoNature, and out flew the pure and unmixed Fire from the moistNature upward on high; it is exceeding Light, and Sharp, andOperative withal. And the Air which was also light, followed the Spiritand mounted up to Fire (from the Earth and the Water) insomuchthat it seemed to hang and depend upon it.7. And the Earth and the Water stayed by themselves so mingledtogether, that the Earth could not be seen for the Water, but theywere moved, because of the Spiritual Word that was carried uponthem.8. Then said Poemander unto me, \"Dost thou understand this Vision,and what it meaneth?\" \"I shall know,\" said I.Then said he, \"I am that Light, the Mind, thy God, who am before thatMoist Nature that appeareth out of Darkness, and that Bright andLightful Word from the Mind is the Son of God.\"9. \"How is that?\" quoth I. \"Thus,\" replied he, \"Understand it, That which in thee Seeth andHeareth, the Word of the Lord, and the Mind, the Father, God,Differeth not One from the Other, and the Unison of these is Life.\"Trismegistus: \"I thank thee.\" Pimander: \"But first conceive well the Light in thy mind and know it.\"10. When he had thus said, for a long time me looked steadfastly oneupon the other, insomuch that I trembled at his Idea or Form.11. But when he nodded to me, I beheld in my mind the Light that isin innumerable, and the truly indefinite Ornament or World; and that"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the Fire is comprehended or contained in or by a most great Power,and constrained to keep its station.12. These things I understood, seeing the word of Pimander; andwhen I was mightily amazed, he said again unto me, \"Hast thou seenin thy mind that Archetypal Form, which was before the Interminatedand Infinite Beginning?\" Thus Pimander to me. \"But whence,\" quothI, \"or whereof are the Elements of Nature made?\"Pimander: \"Of the Will and Counsel of God; which taking the Word,and beholding the beautiful World (in the Archetype thereof) imitatedit, and so made this World, by the principles and vital Seeds or Soul-like productions of itself.\"13. For the Mind being God, Male and Female, Life and Light,brought forth by his Word; another Mind, the Workman: Whichbeing God of the Fire, and the Spirit, fashioned and formed sevenother Governors, which in their Circles contain the Sensible World,whose Government or Disposition is called Fate or Destiny.14. Straightway leaped out, or exalted itself front the downward bornElements of God, the Word of God into the clean and pureWorkmanship of Nature, and was united to the Workman, Mind, forit was Consubstantial; and so the downward born Elements of Naturewere left without Reason, that they might be the only Matter.15. But the Workman, Mind, together with the Word, containing theCircles and Whirling them about, turned round as a Wheel his ownWorkmanships, and suffered them to be turned from an indefiniteBeginning to an undeterminable End; for they always begin wherethey end.16. And the Circulation or running round of these, as the Mindwilleth, out of the lower or downward-born Elements brought forthunreasonable or brutish creatures, for they had no reason, the Airflying things, and the Water such as swim.17. And the Earth and the Water was separated, either from the other,as the Mind would: and the Earth brought forth from herself such"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Living Creatures as she had, four-footed and creeping Beasts, wildand tame.18. But the Father of all things, the Mind being Life and Light,brought forth Man, like unto himself, whom he loved as his properBirth, for he was all beauteous, having the Image of his Father.19. For indeed God was exceedingly enamoured of his own Form orShape, and delivered unto it all his own Workmanships. But he seeingand understanding the Creation of the Workman in the whole, wouldneeds also himself Fall to Work, and so was separated from theFather, being in the sphere of Generation or operation.20. Having all Power, he considered the Operations orWorkmanships of the Seven; but they loved him, and every one madehim partaker of his own Order.21. And he learning diligently and understanding their Essence, andpartaking their nature, resolved to pierce and break through theCircumference of the Circles, and to understand the Power of himthat sits upon the Fire.22. And having already all power of mortal things, of the Living, andof the unreasonable Creatures of the World, stooped down andpeeped through the Harmony, and breaking through the strength ofthe Circles, so shewed and made manifest the downward-bornNature, the fair and beautiful Shape or Form of God.23. Which when he saw, having in itself the unsatiable Beauty and allthe Operation of the Seven Governors, and the Form or Shape of God,he Smiled for love, as if he had seen the Shape or Likeness in theWater, or the shadow upon the Earth of the fairest Human form.24. And seeing in the Water a shape, a shape like unto himself inhimself he loved it, and would cohabit with it; and immediately uponthe resolution, ensued the Operation, and brought forth theunreasonable Image or Shape."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"25. Nature presently laying hold of what it so much loved, did whollywrap herself about it, and they were mingled, for they loved oneanother.26. And for this cause, Man above all things that live upon Earth, isdouble; Mortal because of his Body, and Immortal because of thesubstantial Man: For being immortal, and having power of all things,he yet suffers mortal things, and such as are subject to Fate orDestiny.27. And therefore being; above all Harmony, he is made and become aservant to Harmony. And being Hermaphrodite, or Male and Female,and watchful, he is governed by and subjected to a Father, that is bothMale and Female and watchful.28. After these things, I said: \"Thou art my Mind and I am in lovewith Reason.\"29. Then said Pimander, \"This is the Mystery that to this day ishidden, and kept secret; for Nature being mingled with Man broughtforth a Wonder most wonderful; for he having the Nature of theHarmony of the Seven, from him whom I told thee, the Fire and theSpirit, Nature continued not, but forth with brought forth seven Menall Males and Females and sublime, or on high, according to theNatures of the Seven Governors.\"30. \"And after these things, O Pimander,\" quoth I, \"I am now comeinto a great desire, and longing to hear, do not digress, or run out.\"31. But he said, \"Keep silence, for I have not yet finished the firstspeech.\"32. Trismegistus: \"Behold, I am silent.\"33. Pimander: \"The Generation therefore of these Seven was after thismanner, the Air being Feminine and the Water desirous ofCopulation, took from the Fire its ripeness, and from the aetherSpirit; and so Nature produced bodies after the Species and Shape ofmen.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"34. And Man was made of Life and Light into Soul and Mind, of Lifethe Soul, of Light the Mind.35. And so all the Members of the Sensible World, continued unto theperiod of the end, bearing rule, and generating.36. Hear now the rest of that speech, thou so much desirest to hear.37. When that Period was fulfilled, the bond of all things was loosedand untied by the Will of God; for all living Creatures beingHermaphroditical, or Male and Female, were loosed and untiedtogether with Man; and so the Males were apart by themselves andthe Females likewise.38. And straightway God said to the Holy Word,. Increase inIncreasing, and Multiply in Multitude all you my Creatures andWorkmanships. And let Him that is endued with Mind, know Himselfto be Immortal; and that the cause of Death is the Love of the Body,and let Him Learn all Things that are.39. When he had thus said, Providence by Fate and Harmony, madethe mixtures, and established the Generations, and all things weremultiplied according to their kind, and he that knew himself, came atlength to the Superstantial of every way substantial good.40. But he that through the Error of Love, loved the Body, abidethwandering in darkness, sensible, suffering the things of death.41. Trismegistus: \"But why do they that are ignorant sin so much, thatthey should therefore be deprived of immortality.\"42. Pimander: \"Thou seemest not to have understood what thou hastheard.\"43. Trismegistus: \"Peradventure I seem so to thee, but I bothunderstand and remember them.\"44. Pimander: \"I am glad for thy sake, if thou understoodest them.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"45. Trismegistus: \"Tell me, why are they worthy of death, that are indeath?\"46. Pimander: \"Because there goeth a sad and dismal darkness beforeits Body; of which darkness is the moist Nature, of which moistNature, the Body consisteth in the sensible World, from whence deathis derived. Hast thou understood this aright!\"47. Trismegistus: \"But why or how doth he that understands himself,go or pass into God!\"48. Pimander: \"That which the Word of God said, say I: Because theFather of all things consists of Life and Light, whereof Man is made.\"49. Trismegistus: \"Thou sayest very well.\"50. Pimander: \"God and the Father is Light and Life, of which Man ismade. If therefore thou learn and believe thyself to be of the Life andLight, thou shalt again pass into Life.\"51. Trismegistus: \"But yet tell me more, O my Mind, how I shall gointo Life.\"52. Pimander: \"God saith, Let the Man endued with a Mind, mark,consider, and know himself well.\"53. Trismegistus: \"Have not all Men a mind?\"54. Pimander: \"Take heed what thou sayest, for I the Mind come untomen that are holy and good, pure and merciful, and that live piouslyand religiously; and my presence is a help unto them. And forthwiththey know all things, and lovingly they supplicate and propitiate theFather; and blessing him, they give him thanks, and sing hymns untohim, being ordered and directed by filial Affection, and natural Love:And before they give up their Bodies to the death of them, they hatetheir Senses, knowing their Works and Operations.55. \"Rather I that am the Mind itself, will not suffer the Operations orWorks, which happen or belong to the body, to be finished andbrought to perfection in them; but being the Porter and Door-keeper,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I will shut up the entrances of Evil, and cut off the thoughtful desiresof filthy works.56. \"But to the foolish, and evil, and wicked, and envious andcovetous, and murderous, and profane, I am far off giving place to theavenging Demon, which applying unto him the sharpness of fire,tormenteth such a man sensibly, and armeth him the more to allwickedness, that he may obtain the greater punishment.57. \"And such a one never ceaseth, having unfulfillable desires andunsatiable concupiscences, and always fighting in darkness for theDemon afflicts and tormenteth him continually, and increaseth thefire upon him more and more.\"58. Trismegistus: \"Thou hast, O Mind, most excellently taught me allthings, as I desired; but tell me moreover, after the return is made,what then?\"59. Pimander: \"First of all, in the resolution of the material Body, theBody itself is given up to alteration, and the form which it had,becometh invisible; and the idle manners are permitted, and left tothe Demon, and the Senses of the Body return into their Fountains,being parts, and again made up into Operations.60. \"And Anger and Concupiscence go into the brutish orunreasonable Nature; and the rest striveth upward by Harmony.61. \"And to the first Zone it giveth the power it had of increasing anddiminishing.62. \"To the second, the machination or plotting of evils, and oneeffectual deceit or craft.63. \"To the third, the idle deceit of Concupiscence.64. \"To the fourth, the desire of Rule, and unsatiable Ambition.65. \"To the fifth, profane Boldness, and headlong rashness ofConfidence."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"66. \"To the sixth, Evil and ineffectual occasions of Riches.67. \"And to the seventh Zone, subtle Falsehood always lying in wait.68. \"And then being made naked of all the Operations of Harmony itcometh to the eighth Nature, having its proper power, and singethpraises to the Father with the things that are, and all they that arepresent rejoice, and congratulate the coming of it; and being madelike to them with whom it converseth, it heareth also the Powers thatare above the eighth Nature, singing praise to God in a certain voicethat is peculiar to them.69. \"And then in order they return unto the Father, and themselvesdeliver themselves to the powers, and becoming powers they are inGod.70. \"This is the Good, and to them that know to be deified.71. \"Furthermore, why sayest thou, What resteth, but thatunderstanding all men, thou become a guide, and way-leader to themthat are worthy; that the kind of Humanity or Mankind, may be savedby God!\"72. When Pimander had thus said unto me, he was mingled amongthe Powers.73. But I giving thanks, and blessing the Father of all things, rose up,being enabled by him, and taught the Nature, of the Nature of thewhole and having seen the greatest sight or spectacle.74. And I began to Preach unto men, the beauty and fairness of Pietyand Knowledge.75. O ye People, Men, born and made of the Earth, which have givenYourselves over to Drunkenness, and Sleep, and to the Ignorance ofGod, be Sober, and Cease your Surfeit, whereto you are allured, andinvited by Brutish and Unreasonable Sleep.76. And they that heard me, come willingly, and with one accord, andthen I said further."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"77. Why, O Men of the Off-spring of the Earth, why have youdelivered Yourselves over unto Death, having Power to Partake ofImmortality; Repent and Change your Minds, you that have togetherWalked in Error, and have been Darkened in Ignorance.78. Depart from that dark Light, be Partakers of Immortality, andLeave or Forsake Corruption.79. And some of Them That Heard Me, mocking and scorning, wentaway and delivered themselves up to the way of death.80. But others, casting themselves down before my feet, besought methat they might be taught; but I causing them to rise up, became aguide of mankind, teaching them the reasons how, and by whatmeans they may be saved. And I sowed in them the words of Wisdom,and nourished them with Ambrosian Water of Immortality.81. And when it was Evening, and the Brightness of the same beganwholly to go down, I commanded them to give thanks to God; andwhen they had finished their thanksgiving, everyone returned to hisown lodging.82. But I wrote in myself the bounty and beneficence of Pimander;and being filled with what I most desired, I was exceeding glad.83. For the sleep of the Body was the sober watchfulness of the mind;and the shutting of my eyes the true Sight, and my silence great withchild and full of good; and the pronouncing of my words, theblossoms and fruits of good things.84. And thus came to pass or happened unto me, which I receivedfrom my mind, that is, Pimander, the Lord of the Word; whereby Ibecame inspired by God with the Truth.85. For which cause, with my Soul, and whole strength, I give praiseand blessing unto God the Father. 86. Holy is God the Father of All Things."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"87.
