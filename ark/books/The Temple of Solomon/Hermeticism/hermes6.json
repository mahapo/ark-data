[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Sixth Book\"That in God alone is Good\"1. Good, O Asciepius, is in nothing but in God alone; or rather Godhimself is the Good always.2. And if it be so, then must he be an Essence or Substance void of allmotion and generation; but nothing is void or empty of him.3. And this Essence hath about or in himself a Stable, and firmOperation, wanting nothing, most full, and giving abundantly.4. One thing is the Beginning of all things, for it giveth all things; andwhen I name the Good, I mean that which is altogether and alwaysGood.5. This is present to none, but God alone; for he wanteth nothing, thathe should desire to have it, nor can anything be taken from him; theloss whereof may grieve him for sorrow is a part of evilness.6. Nothing is stronger than he, that he should be opposed by it; nornothing equal to him, that he should be in love with it; nothingunheard of to be angry, with nothing wiser to be envious at.7. And none of these being in his Essence, what remains, but only theGood?8. For as in this, being such an Essence, there is none of the evils; soin none of the other things shall the Good be found.9. For in all other things, are all those other things. As well in thesmall as the great; and as well in the particulars as in this livingCreature the greater and mightiest of all.10. For all things that are made or generated are full of Passion,Generation itself being a Passion; and where Passion is there is notthe Good; where the Good is, there is no Passion; where it is day, it isnot night, and where it is night, it is not day."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"11. Wherefore it is impossible, that in Generation should be the Good,but only in that which is not generated or made.12. Yet as the Participation of all things is in the Matter bound, so alsoof that which is Good. After this manner is the World good, as itmaketh all things, and in the part of making or doing it is Good, but inall other things not good.13. For it is passible, and movable, and the Maker of passible things.14. In Man also the Good is ordered (or Taketh Denomination) incomparison of that which is evil; for that which is not very evil, is heregood; and that which is here called Good, is the least particle, orproportion of evil.15. It is impossible therefore, that the Good should be here pure fromEvil; for here the Good groweth Evil, and growing Evil, it doth not stillabide Good; and not abiding Good it becomes Evil.16. Therefore in God alone is the Good, or rather God is the Good.17. Therefore, O Asclepius, there is nothing in men (or among Men)but the name of Comprehendeth, is not as being on every sideencompassed and coated with evilness, and labours, and griefs, anddesires, and wrath, and deceits, and foolish opinions.18. And in that which is the worst of all, Asclepius, every one of theforenamed things, is here believed to be the greatest good, especiallythat supreme mischief the pleasures of the Belly, and the ring-leaderof all evils; Error is here the absence of the Good.19. And I give thanks unto God, that concerning the knowledge ofGood, put this assurance in my mind, that it is impossible it should bein the World.20. For the World is the fullness of evilness; but God is the fullness ofGood, or Good of God."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"21. For the eminencies of all appearing Beauty, are in the Essencemore pure, more sincere, and peradventure they are also the Essenceof it.22. For we must be bold to say, Asclepius, that the Essence of God, ifhe have an Essence, is that which is fair or beautiful; but no good iscomprehended in this World.23. For all things that are subject to the eye, are Idols, and as it wereshadows; but those things that are not subject to the eye, are ever,especially the Essence of the Fair and the Good.24. And as the eye cannot see God, so neither the Fair, and the Good.25. For these are the parts of God that partake the Nature of thewhole, proper, and familiar unto him alone, inseparable, most lovely,whereof either God is enamoured, or they are enamoured of God.26. If thou canst understand God, thou shalt understand the Fair, andthe Good which is most shining, and enlightening, and mostenlightened by God.27. For that Beauty is above comparison, and that Good is inimitable,as God himself.28. As therefore thou understandest God, so understand the Fair andthe Good, for these are incommunicable to any other living Creaturesbecause they are inseparable from God.29. If thou seek concerning God, thou seekest or askest also of theFair, for there is one way that leads to the same thing, that is Pietywith Knowledge.30. Wherefore, they that are ignorant, and go not in the way of Piety,dare call Man Fair and Good, never seeing so much as in a dream,what Good is; but being enfolded and wrapped upon all evil, andbelieving that the evil is the Good, they by that means, both use itunsatiably, and are afraid to be deprived of it; and therefore theystrive by all possible means, that they may not only have it, but alsoincrease it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"31. Such, O Asclepius, are the Good and Fair things of men, which wecan neither love nor hate, for this is the hardest thing of all, that wehave need of them, and cannot live without them."}]
