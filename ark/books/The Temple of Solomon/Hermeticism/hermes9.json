[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Ninth BookA Universal Sermon to Asclepius.1. Hermes: All that is moved, O Asclepius, is it not moved in something, and by some thing?2. Asclepius: Yes, indeed.3. Hermes: Must not that, in which a thing is moved, of necessity begreater than the thing that is moved?4. Of necessity.5. And that which moveth, is it not stronger than that which ismoved?6. Asclepius: It is stronger.7. Hermes: That in which a thing is moved, must it not needs have aNature, contrary to that of the thing that is moved?8. Asclepius: It must needs.9. Hermes: Is not this great World a Body, than which there is nogreater?10. Asclepius. Yes, confessedly.11. Hermes: And is it not solid, as filled with many great bodies, andindeed, with all the Bodies that are?12. Asclepius: It is so.13. Hermes: And is not the World a Body, and a Body that is moved.14. Asclepius: It is."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"15. Hermes: Then what kind of a place must it be, wherein it ismoved, and of what Nature? Must it not be much bigger, that it mayreceive the continuity of Motion? And lest that which is moved shouldfor want of room, he stayed, and hindered in the Motion?16. Asclepius: It must needs be an immense thing, Trismegistus, butof what Nature.17. Hermes: Of a contrary Nature, O Asclepius; but is not the Natureof things unbodily, contrary to a Body.18. Asclepius: Confessedly.19. Hermes: Therefore the place is unbodily; but that which isunbodily, is either some Divine thing or God himself And by something Divine, I do not mean that which was made or begotten.20. If therefore it be Divine, it is an Essence or Substance but if it beGod, it is above Essence; but he is otherwise intelligible.21. For the first, God is intelligible, not to himself, but to us, for thatwhich is intelligible, is subject to that which understandeth by Sense.22. Therefore God is not intelligible to himself, for not being anyother thing from that which is understood, he cannot be understoodby himself.23. But he is another thing from us, and therefore he is understood byus.24. If therefore Place be intelligible, it is not Place but God, but if Godbe intelligible, he is intelligible not as Mace, but as a capableOperation.25. Now everything that is moved, is moved, not in or by that which ismoved, but in that which standeth or resteth, and that which movethstandeth or resteth, for it is impossible it should be moved with it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"26. Asclepius: How then, O Trismegistus, are those things that arehere moved with the things that are moved? For thou sayest that theSpheres that wander are moved by the Sphere that wanders not.27. Hermes: That, O Asclepius, is not a moving together, but acountermotion, for they are not moved after a like manner, butcontrary one to the other; and contrariety hath a standing resistanceof motion for resistance is a staying of motion.28. Therefore the wandering Spheres being moved contrarily to thatSphere which wandereth not, shall have one from another contrarietystanding of itself.29. For this Bear which thou seest neither rise nor go down, butturning always about the same; dost thou think it moveth or standethstill?30. Asclepius: I think it moves, Trismegistus.31. What motion, O Asclepius?32. Asclepius: A motion that is always carried about the same.33. But the Circulation which is about the same, and the motion aboutthe same, are both hidden by Station; for that which is about the sameforbids that which is above the same, if it stand to that which is aboutthe same.34. And so the contrary motion stands fast always, being alwaysestablished by the contrariety.35. But I will give thee concerning this matter, an earthly examplethat may be seen with eyes.36. Look upon any of these living Creatures upon Earth, as Man forexample, and see him swimming; for as the Water is carried one way,the reluctation or resistance of his feet and hands is made a station tothe man, that he should not be carried with the Water, nor sinkunderneath it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"37. Asclepius: Thou hast laid down a very clear example,Trismegistus.38. Hermes: Therefore every motion is in station, and is moved ofstation.39. The motion then of the World, and of every material living thing,happeneth not to be done by those things that are without the World,but by those things within it, a Soul, or Spirit, or some other unbodilything, to those things which are without it.40. For an inanimated Body, doth not now, much less a Body if it bewholly inanimate.41. Asclepius: What meaneth thou by this, O Trismegistus, Wood andStones, and all other inanimate things, are they not moving Bodies?42. Hermes: By no means, O Asclepius, for that within the Bodywhich moves the inanimate thing, is not the Body, that moves both aswell the Body of that which beareth, as the Body of that which is born;for one dead or inanimate thing, cannot move another; that whichmoveth, must needs be alive if it move.43. Thou seest therefore how the Soul is surcharged, when it carriethtwo Bodies.44. And now it is manifest, that the things that are moved are movedin something, and by something.45 Asclepius: The things that are, O Trismegistus, must needs bemoved in that which is void or empty, Vacuum.46. Be advised, O Asclepius, for of all the things that are, there isnothing empty, only that which is not, is empty and a stranger toexistence or being.47. But that which is, could not be if it were not full of existence, forthat which is in being or existence can never be made empty."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"48. Asclepius: Are there not therefore some things that are empty, OTrismegistus, as an empty Barrel, an empty Hogshead, an emptyWell, an empty Wine-Press, and many such like?49. Hermes: O the grossness of thy Error, O Asclepius, those thingsthat are most full and replenished, dost thou account them void andempty.50. Asclepius: What may be thy meaning, Trismegistus?51. Hermes: Is not the Air a Body?52. Asclepius: It is a Body53. Hermes: Why then this Body doth it not pass through all thingsthat are and passing through them, fill them? And that Body doth itnot consist of the mixture of the four? Therefore all those thou callestempty are full of Air.54. Therefore those things that thou callest empty, thou oughtest tocall them hollow, not empty, for they exist and are full of Air andSpirit.55. Asclepius: This reason is beyond all contradiction, O Trismegistus,but what shall we call the Place in which the whole Universe ismoved?56. Hermes: Call it incorporeal, O Asclepius.57. Asclepius: What is that incorporeal or unbodily?58. Hermes: The Mind and Reason, the whole, wholly comprehendingitself, free from all Body, undeceivable, invisible, impassible from aBody itself, standing fast in itself, capable of all things, and thatfavour of the things that are.59. Whereof the Good, the Truth, the Archetypal Light, the Archetypeof the Soul, are as it were Beams.60. Asclepius: Why then, what is God?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"61. Hermes: That which is none of these things, yet is, and is thecause of Being to all; and every one of the things that are; for he leftnothing destitute of Being.62. And all things are made of things that are, and not of things thatare not; for the things that are not, have not the nature to be able tobe made; and again, the things that are, have not the nature never tobe, or not to be at all.63. Asclepius: What dost thou then say at length, that God is?64. Hermes: God is not a Mind, but the Cause that the Mind is; not aSpirit, but the Cause that the Spirit is; not Light, but the Cause thatLight is.65. Therefore we must worship God by these two Appellations whichare proper to him alone, and to no other.66. For neither of all the other, which are called Gods, nor of Men,nor Demons, or Angels, can anyone be, though never so little, good,save only God alone.67. And this He is, and nothing else; but all other things are separablefrom the nature of Good.68. For the Body and the Soul have no place that is capable of or cancontain the Good.69. For the greatness of Good, is as great as the Existence of allthings, that are both bodily and unbodily, both sensible andintelligible.70. This is the Good, even God.71. See therefore that thou do not at any time, call ought else Good,for so thou shalt be impious, or any else God, but only the Good, forso thou shalt again be impious."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"72. In Word it is often said by all men the Good, but all men do notunderstand what it is; but through Ignorance they call both the Gods,and some men Good, that can never either be or be made so.73. Therefore all the other Gods are honoured with the title andappellation of God, but God is the Good, not according to Heaven, butNature.74. For there is one Nature of God, even the Good, and one kind ofthem both, from whence are all kinds.75. For he that is Good, is the giver of all things, and takes nothingand therefore God gives all things and receives nothing.76. The other title and appellation, is the Father, because of hismaking all things; for it is the part of a Father to make.77. Therefore it bath been the greatest and most Religious care in thislife, to them that are wise, and well-minded, to beget children.78. As likewise it is the greatest misfortune and impiety for any to beseparated from men, without children; and this man is punished afterdeath by the Demons, and the punishment is this, To have the Soul ofthis childless man, adjudged and condemned to a Body, that neitherbath the nature of a man, nor of a woman, which is an accursed thingunder the Sun.79. Therefore, O Asclepius, never congratulate any man that ischildless; but on the contrary, pity his misfortune, knowing whatpunishment abides, and is prepared for him.80. Let so many, and such manner of things, O Asclepius, be said as acertain precognition of all things in Nature."}]
