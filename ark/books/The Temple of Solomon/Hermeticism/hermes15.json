[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Fifteenth BookOf Truth to His Son Tat1. Hermes: Of Truth, O Tat, it is not possible that man being animperfect wight, compounded of imperfect Members, and having hisTabernacle consisting of different and many Bodies, should speakwith any confidence.2. But as far as it is possible, and just, I say, That Truth is only in theEternal Bodies, whose very Bodies be also true.3. The Fire is fire itself only, and nothing else; the Earth is earth itselfand nothing else; the air is air itself and nothing else; the water, wateritself and nothing else.4. But our Bodies consist of all these; for they have of the Fire, theyhave of the Earth, they have of the Water, and Air, and yet there isneither Fire, nor Earth, nor Water, nor Air, nor anything true.5. And if at the Beginning our Constitution had not Truth, how couldmen either see the Truth, or speak it, or understand it only, exceptGod would?6. All things therefore upon Earth, O Tat, are not Truth, butimitations of the Truth, and yet not all things neither, for they are butfew that are so.7. But the other things are Falsehood, and Deceit, O Tat, andOpinions like the Images of the fantasy or appearance.8. And when the fantasy hath an influence from above, then it is animitation of Truth, but without that operation from above, it is left alie.9. And as an Image shews the Body described, and yet is not the Bodyof that which is seen, as it seems to be, and it is seen to have eyes, butit sees nothing, and ears, but hears nothing at all; and all other things"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"hath the picture, but they are false, deceiving the eyes of the beholder,whilst they think they see the Truth, and yet they are indeed but lies.10. As many therefore as see not Falsehood, see the Truth.11. If therefore we do so understand, and see every one of these thingsas it is, then we see and understand true things.12. But if we see or understand any thing besides or otherwise thanthat which is, we shall neither understand, nor know the Truth.13. Tat: Is Truth therefore upon Earth, O Father?14. Hermes: Thou cost not miss the mark, O Son. Truth indeed isnowhere at all upon Earth, O Tat, for it cannot be generated or made.15. But concerning the Truth, it may be that some men, to whom Godwill give the good seeing Power, may understand it.16. So that unto the Mind and reason, there is nothing true indeedupon Earth.17. But unto the True Mind and Reason, all things are fantasies orappearances, and opinions.18. Tat: Must we not therefore call it Truth, to understand and speakthe things that are?19. Hermes: But there is nothing true upon Earth.20. Tat: How then is this true, That we do not know anything true?How can that be done here?21. Hermes: O Son, Truth is the most perfect Virtue, and the highestGood itself, not troubled by Matter, not encompassed by a Body,naked, clear, unchangeable, venerable, unalterable Good.22. But the things that are here, O Son, are visible, incapable of Good,corruptible, passible, dissolvable, changeable, continually altered, andmade of another."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"23. The things therefore that are not true to themselves, how can theybe true?24. For every thing that is altered, is a lie, not abiding in what it is;but being changed it shews us always, other and other appearances.25. Tat: Is not man true, O Father?26. Hermes: As far forth as he is a Man, he is not true, Son; for thatwhich is true, hath of itself alone its constitution and remains, andabides according to itself, such as it is.27. But man consists of many things and doth not abide of himself butis turned and changed, age after age, Idea after Idea, or form afterform, and this while he is yet in the Tabernacle.28. And many have not known their own children after a little while,and many children likewise have not known their own Parents.29. Is it then possible, O Tat, that he who is so changed, is not to beknown, should be true? No, on the contrary, he is Falsehood, being inmany Appearances of changes.30. But do thou understand the true to be that which abides the same,and is Eternal, but man is not ever, therefore not True, but man is acertain Appearance, and Appearance is the highest Lie or Falsehood.31. Tat: But these Eternal Bodies, Father, are they not true thoughthey be changed?32. Hermes: Everything that is begotten or made, and changed is nottrue, but being made by our Progenitor, they might have had trueMatter.33. But these also have in themselves, something that is false inregard of their change.34. For nothing that remains not in itself, is True."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"35. Tat. What shall one say then, Father, that only the Sun whichbesides the Nature of other things, is not changed, but abides in itself,is Truth?36. Hermes: It is Truth, and therefore is he only entrusted with theWorkmanship of the World, ruling and making all things whom I doboth honour, and adore his Truth; and after the One, and First, Iacknowledge him the Workman.37. Tat: What therefore doth thou affirm to be the first Truth, OFather?38. Hermes: The One and Only, O Tat, that is not of Matter, that isnot in a body, that is without Colour, without Figure or Shape,Immutable, Unalterable, which always is; but Falsehood, O Son, iscorrupted.39. And corruption hath laid hold upon all things on Earth, and theProvidence of the True encompasseth, and will encompass them.40. For without corruption, there can no Generation consist.41. For Corruption followeth every Generation, that it may again begenerated.42. For those things that are generated, must of necessity begenerated of those things that are corrupted, and the things generatedmust needs be corrupted, that the Generation of things being, maynot stand still or cease.43. Acknowledge therefore the first Workman by the Generation ofthings.44. Consequently the things that are generated of Corruption arefalse, as being sometimes one thing, sometimes another: For it isimpossible they should be made the same things again, and thatwhich is not the same, how is it true?45. Therefore, O Son, we must call these things fantasies orappearances."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"46. And if we will give a man his right name, we must call him theappearance of Manhood; and a Child, the fantasy or appearance of aChild; an old man, the appearance of an old man; a young man, theappearance of a young man; and a man of ripe age, the appearance ofa man of ripe age.47. For neither is a man, a man; nor a child, a child; nor a young man,a young man; nor an old man, an old man.48. But the things that pre-exist and that are, being changed are false.49. These things understand thus, O Son, as these false Operations,having their dependence from above, even of the truth itself.50. Which being so, I do affirm that Falsehood is the Work of Truth."}]
