[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Tenth BookThe Mind to Hermes1. Forbear thy speech, O Hermes Trismegistus, and call to mind thosethings that are said: but I will not delay to speak what comes into mymind, since many men have spoken many things, and those verydifferent, concerning the Universe and Good; but I have not learnedthe Truth.2. Therefore, the Lord make it plain to me in this point; for I willbelieve thee only, for the manifestation of these things.3. Then said the Mind how the case stands.4. God and all.5. God, Eternity, the World, Time, Generation,6. God made Eternity, Eternity the World; the World Time, and TimeGeneration.7. Of God, as it were the Substance, is the Good, the Fair, Blessedness,Wisdom.8. Of Eternity, Identity, or Selfness.9. Of the World, Order.10. Of Time, Change.11. Of Generation, Life, and Death.12. But the Operation of God, is Mind and Soul.13. Of Eternity, Permanence, or Long-lasting, and Immortality14. Of the World, Restitution, and Decay or Destruction."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"15. Of Time, Augmentation and Diminution. 16. And of Generation, Qualities. 17. Therefore Eternity is in God. 18. The World in Eternity. 19. Time in the World. 20. And Generation in Time. 21. And Eternity standeth about God. 22. The World is moved in Eternity. 23. Time is determined in the World. 24. Generation is done in Time. 25. Therefore the Spring and Fountain of all things is God.26. The Substance Eternity.27. The Matter is the World.28. The Power of God is Eternity.29. And the Work of Eternity is the World not yet made, and yet evermade by Eternity.30. Therefore shall nothing be at any time destroyed, for Eternity isincorruptible.31. Neither can anything perish, or be destroyed in the World, theWorld being contained and embraced by eternity.32. But what is the Wisdom of God? Even the Good, and the Fair andBlessedness, and every Virtue, and Eternity."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"33. Eternity therefore put into the Matter Immortality andEverlastingness; for the Generation of that depends upon Eternity,even as Eternity doth of God.34. For Generation and Time, in Heaven, and in Earth, are of adouble Nature; in Heaven they are unchangeable and incorruptible,but on Earth they are changeable and corruptible.35. And the Soul of Eternity is God; and the Soul of the WorldEternity; and of the Earth, Heaven.36. God is in the Mind, the Mind in the Soul1 the Soul in the Matter,all things by Eternity.37. All this Universal Body, in which are all Bodies, is full of Soul, theSoul full of Mind, the Mind full of God.38. For within he fills them, and without he contains them,quickening the Universe.39. Without he quickens this perfect living thing the World, andwithin all living Creatures.40. And above in Heaven he abides in Identity or Selfness, but belowupon Earth he changeth Generation.41. Eternity comprehendeth the World, either by Necessity, orProvidence, or Nature.42. And if any man shall think any other thing, it is God thatactuateth, or operateth this All.43. But the operation or Act of God, is power insuperable, to whichnone may compare anything, either Human or Divine.44. Therefore, O Hermes, think none of these things below, or thethings above, in any wise like unto God, for if thou dost thou errestfrom the Truth."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"45. For nothing can be like the unlike, and only and One; nor mayestthou think that he bath given of his Power to any other thing.46. For who after him can make anything, either of Life, orImmortality; of Change or of Quality, and himself what other thingshould he make.47. For God is not idle, for then all things would be idle; for all thingsare full of God.48. But there is not anywhere in the world such a thing as Idleness;for Idleness is a name that implieth a thing void or empty, both of aDoer and a thing done.49. But all things must necessarily be made or done both always andaccording to the nature of every place.50. For he that maketh or doth is in all things, yet not fastened orcomprehended in anything, nor making or doing one thing, but allthings.51. For being an active or operating Power and sufficient of himselffor the things that are made, and the things that are made are underhim.52. Look upon, through me, the World is subject to thy sight, andunderstand exactly the Beauty thereof. 53. A Body immarcessible, than the which, there is nothing moreancient, yet always vigorous and young.54. See also the seven Worlds set over us, adorned with an everlastingOrder, and filling Eternity, with a different course.55. For all things are full of Light, but the Fire is nowhere.56. For the friendship and commixture of contraries and unlikebecame Light shining from the Act or Operation of God, the Father ofall Good, the Prince of all Order, and the Ruler of the seven Worlds."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"57. Look also upon the Moon, the forerunner of them all, theInstrument of Nature, and which changeth the Matter here below.58. Behold the Earth, the middle of the whole, the firm and stableFoundation of the Fair World, the Feeder and Nurse of Earthlythings.59. Consider moreover, how great the multitude is of immortal livingthings, and of mortal ones also; and see the Moon going about in themidst of both, to wit, of things immortal and mortal.60. But all things are full of Soul, and all things are properly movedby it; some things about the Heaven, and some things about theEarth, and neither of those on the right hand to the left; nor those onthe left hand to the right; nor those things that are above, down.ward; nor those things that are below, upwards.61. And that all these things are made, O beloved Hermes, thouneedst not learn of me.62. For they are Bodies, and have a Soul, and are moved.63. And that all these should come together into one, it is impossiblewithout some thing, to gather them together.64. Therefore there must be some such ones, and he altogether One.65. For seeing that the motions are divers, and many, and the Bodiesnot alike, and yet one ordered swiftness among them all; It isimpossible there should be two or more Makers.66. For one order is not kept by many.67. But in the weaker, there would be jealousy of the stronger andthence also Contentions.68. And if there were one Maker of mutable and mortal living wights,he would desire so to make immortal ones, as he that were the Makerof immortal ones, would do to make mortal."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"69. Moreover also, if there were two, the Matter being one, whoshould be chief, or have the disposing of the facture?70. Or if both of them, which of them the greater part?71. But think thus that every living Body bath its consistence ofMatter and Soul; and of that which is immortal, and that which ismortal, and unreasonable.72. For all living Bodies have a Soul; and those things that are notliving are only matter by itself.73. And the Soul likewise of itself drawing near her Maker, is theCause of Life and Being and Being the cause of Life, is after a manner,the cause of immortal things.74. How then are mortal wights, other from immortal?75. Or how cannot he make living wights that causeth immortalthings and immortality?76. That there is some Body that doth these things it is apparent, andthat he is also one, it is most manifest.77. For there is one Soul, one Life and one Matter.78. Who is this? Who can it be? Other than the One God.79. For whom else can it benefit, to make living things, save only Godalone?80. There is therefore one God.81. For it is a ridiculous thing to confess the World to be one Sun, oneMoon, one Divinity; and yet to have I know not how many gods.82. He therefore being One, doth all things in many things.83. And what great thing is it for God to make Life and Soul, andImmortality, and Change, when thy self dost so many things?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"84. For thou both seest, speakest and hearest, smellest, tastest andtouchest, walkest, understandest, and breathest.85. And it is not one that seeth, and another that heareth, andanother that speaketh, and another that toucheth, and another thatsmelleth, and another that walketh, and another that understandeth,and another that breatheth, but One that doth all these things.86. Yet neither can these things possibly be without God.87. For as thou, if thou shouldst cease from doing these things, werenot a living wight; so if God should cease from those, he were not(which is not lawful to say) any longer God.88. For if it be already demonstrated, that nothing can be idle orempty, how much more may be affirmed of God?89. For if there be any thing which he doth not do, then is he (if itwere lawful to say so) Imperfect.90. Whereas feeling he is not idle, but perfect, certainly he doth allthings.91. Now give thy self unto me, O Hermes, for a little while thou shaltthe more easily understand, that it is the necessary work of God thatall things should be made or done that are done or were once done, orshall be done.92. And this, O best Beloved, is life.93. And this is the Fair.94. And this is the Good.95. And this is God.96. And if thou wilt understand this by work also, mark what happensto thy self, when thou wilt generate."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"97. And yet this is not like unto him; for he is not sensible of pleasure,for neither bath he any other Fellow-workman.98. But being himself the only Workman he is always in the Work,himself being that which he doth or maketh.99. For all things, if they were separated from him, must needs falland die, as there being no life in them.100. And again, if all things be living wights, both which are inHeaven, and upon Earth; and that there be one Life in all thingswhich are made by God, and that is God, then certainly all things aremade, or done by God.101. Life is the union of the Mind and the Soul.102. But death is not the destruction of those things that weregathered together, but a dissolving of the Union.103. The Image therefore of God is Eternity, of Eternity the World, ofthe World the Sun, of the Sun, Man.104. But the people say, that changing is Death, because the Body isdissolved, and the Life goeth into that which appeareth not.105. By this discourse, my dearest Hermes, I affirm as thou hearest,That the World is changed, because every day part thereof becomesinvisible; but that it is never dissolved.106. And these are the Passions of the World, Revolutions andOccultations, and Revolution is a turning, but Occultation isRenovation.107. And the World being all formed, bath not the forms lying withoutit, but itself changeth in itself.108. Seeing then the World is all formed, what must he be that madeit? For without form he cannot be."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"109. And if he be all formed, he will be kept like the World, but if hehave but one form, he shall be in this regard less than the World.110. What do we then say that he is? We will not raise any doubts byour speech; for nothing that is doubtful concerning God,is yet known.111. He hath therefore one Idea which is proper to him, which becauseit is unbodily is not subject to the sight, and yet shews all forms by theBodies.112. And do not wonder, if there be an incorruptible Idea.113. For they are like the Margents of that Speech which is in writing;for they seem to be high and swelling, hut they are by nature smoothand even.114. But understand well this that I say, more boldly, for it is moretrue; As a man cannot live without life, so neither can God live, notdoing good.115. For this is, as it were, the Life and Motion of God, to move allthings, and quicken them.116. But some of the things I have said, must have a particularexplication; Understand then what I say.117. All things are in God, not as lying in a place; for Place is both aBody, and unmoveable, and those things that are there placed, haveno motion.118. For they lie otherwise in that which is unbodily, than in thefantasy or to appearance.119. Consider him that contains all things, and understand, thatnothing is more capacious, than that which is incorporeal, nothingmore swift, nothing more powerful, but it is most capacious, mostswift and most strong."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"120. And judge of this by thyself, command thy Soul to go into India,and sooner than thou canst bid it, it will be there.121. Bid it likewise pass over the Ocean, and suddenly it will be there;Not as passing from place to place, but suddenly it will be there.122. Command it to fly into Heaven, and it will need no Wings,neither shall anything hinder it; not the fire of the Sun, not theAether, not the turning of the Spheres, not the bodies of any of theother Stars, but cutting through all, it will fly up to the last, andfurthest Body.123. And if thou wilt even break the whole, and see those things thatare without the World (if there be any thing without) thou mayest.124. Behold how great power, how great swiftness thou hast! Canstthou do all these things, and cannot God?125. After this manner therefore contemplate God to have all thewhole World to himself, as it were all thoughts, or intellections.126. If therefore thou wilt not equal thy self to God, thou canst notunderstand God.127. For the like is intelligible by the like.128. Increase thy self into an immeasurable greatness, leaping beyondevery Body; and transcending all Time, become Eternity and thoushalt understand God: If thou believe in thyself that nothing isimpossible, but accountest thy self immortal, and that thou canstunderstand all things, every Art, every Science and the manner andcustom of every living thing.129. Become higher than all height, lower than all depths,comprehend in thy self, the qualities of all the Creatures, of the Fire,the Water, the Dry and Moist; and conceive likewise, that thou canstat once be everywhere in the Sea, in the Earth.130.

But if thou shut up thy Soul in the Body and abuse it, and say, Iunderstand nothing, I can do nothing, I am afraid of the Sea, I cannotclimb up into Heaven, I know not who I am, I cannot tell what I shallbe; what hast thou to do with God; for thou canst understand none ofthose Fair and Good things; be a lover of the Body, and Evil.132. For it is the greatest evil, not to know God.133. But to be able to know and to will, and to hope, is the straightway, and Divine way, proper to the Good; and it will everywhere meetthee, and everywhere be seen of thee, plain and easy, when thou dostnot expect or look for it; it will meet thee, waking, sleeping, sailing,travelling, by night, by day, when thou speakest, and when thoukeepest silence.134. For there is nothing which is not the Image of God.135. And yet thou sayest, God is invisible, but be advised, for who ismore manifest than He.136. For therefore hath he made all things, that thou by all thingsmayest see him.137. This is the Good of God, this is his Virtue, to appear, and to beseen in all things.138. There is nothing invisible, no, not of those things that areincorporeal.139. The Mind is seen in Understanding, and God is seen in doing ormaking.140. Let these things thus far forth, be made manifest unto thee, OTrismegistus.141. Understand in like manner, all other things by thy self, and thoushalt not be deceived."}]
