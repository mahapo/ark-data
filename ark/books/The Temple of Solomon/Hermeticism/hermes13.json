[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Thirteenth BookOf Sense and Understanding1. Yesterday, Asclepius, I delivered a perfect Discourse; but now Ithink it necessary, in suite of that, to dispute also of Sense.2. For Sense and Understanding seem to differ, because the one ismaterial, the other essential.3. But unto me, they appear to be both one, or united, and not dividedin men, I mean.4. For in other living Creatures, Sense is united unto Nature but inmen to Understanding.5. But the Mind differs from Understanding, as much as God fromDivinity.6. For Divinity is from or under God, and Understanding from theMind, being the sister of the Word or Speech, and they theInstruments one of another.7. For neither is the Word pronounced without Understanding,neither is Understanding manifested without the Word.8. Therefore Sense and Understanding do both flow together into aman, as if they were infolded one within another.9. For neither is it possible without Sense to Understand, nor can wehave Sense without Understanding.10. And yet it is possible (for the Time being) that the Understandingmay understand without Sense, as they that fantasy Visions in theirDreams.11. But it seems unto me, that both the operations are in the Visions ofDreams, and that the Sense is stirred up out of sleep, unto awaking."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"12. For man is divided into a Body and a Soul; when both parts of theSense accord one with another, then is the understanding childed, orbrought forth by the Mind pronounced.13. For the Mind brings forth all Intellections or Understandings.Good ones w hen it receiveth good Seed from God; and the contrarywhen it receives them from Devils.14. For there is no part of the World void of the Devil, which enteringin privately, sowed the seed of his own proper operation; and theMind did make pregnant, or did bring forth that which was sown,Adulteries, Murders, Striking of Parents, Sacrileges, Impieties,Stranglings, throwing down headlong, and all other things which arethe works of evil Demons.15. And the Seeds of God are few but Great, and Fair, and GoodVirtue, and Temperance, and Piety.16. And the Piety is the Knowledge of God, whom whosoever knowethbeing full of all good things, hath Divine Understanding and not likethe Many.17. And therefore they that have that Knowledge neither please themultitude, nor the multitude them, but they seem to be mad, and tomove laughter, hated and despised, and many times also murdered.18. For we have already said, That wickedness must dwell here, beingin her own region.19. For her region is the Earth, and not the World, as some willsometimes say, Blaspheming.20. But the Godly or God-worshipping Man laying hold onKnowledge, will despise or tread under all these things; for thoughthey be evil to other men, yet to him all things are good.21. And upon mature consideration, he refers all things to Knowledge,and that which is most to be wondered at, he alone makes evil thingsgood."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"22. But I return again to my Discourse of Sense.23. It is therefore a thing proper to Man, to communicate and conjoinSense and Understanding.24. But every man, as I said before, cloth not enjoy Understanding;for one man is material, another essential.25. And he that is material with wickedness as I said, received fromthe Devils the Seed of Understanding; but they that are with the Goodessentially, are saved with God.26. For God is the Workman of all things; and when he worketh heuseth Nature.27. He maketh all things good like himself28. But these things that are made good, are in the use of Operation,unlawful.29. For the Motion of the World stirring up Generations, makesQualities, infecting some with evilness, and purifying some with good.30. And the World, Asclepius, hath a peculiar Sense andUnderstanding, not like to Man's, nor so various or manifold, but abetter and more simple.31. For this Sense and Understanding of the World is One, in that itmakes all things, and unmakes them again into itself; for it is theOrgan or Instrument of the Will of God.32. And it is so organized or framed, and made for an Instrument byGod; that receiving all Seeds into itself from God, and keeping themin itself, it maketh all things effectually and dissolving them,reneweth all things.33. And therefore like a good Husband-man of Life, when things aredissolved or loosened, he affords by the casting of Seed, renovation toall things that grow."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"34. There is nothing that it (the World) cloth not beget or bring forthalive; and by its Motion, it makes all things alive.35. And it is at once, both the Place and the Workman of Life.36. But the Bodies are from the Matter, in a different manner; forsome are of the Earth, some of Water, some of Air, some of Fire, andall are compounded, but some are more compounded, and some aremore simple.37. They that are compounded, are the heavier, and they that are less,are the higher.38. And the swiftness of the Motion of the World, makes the varietiesof the Qualities of Generation, for the spiration or influence, beingmost frequent, extendeth unto the Bodies qualities with one fullness,which is of Life.39. Therefore, God is the Father of the World, but the World is theFather of things in the World.40. And the World is the Son of God, but things in the World are theSons of the World.41. And therefore it is well called the World, that is an Ornament,because it adorneth and beautifieth all things with the variety ofGeneration, and indeficiency of Life, which the unweariedness ofOperation, and the swiftness of Necessity with the mingling ofElements, and the order of things done.42. Therefore it is necessarily and properly called the World.43. For of all living things, both the Sense and the Understanding,cometh into them from without, inspired by that which compasseththem about, and continueth them.44. And the World receiving it once from God as soon as it was made,hath it still, What Ever it Once Had."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"45. But God is not as it seems to some who Blaspheme throughsuperstition, without Sense, and without Mind, or Understanding.46. For all things that are, O Asclepius, are in God, and made by him,and depend of him, some working by Bodies, some moving by a Soul-like Essence, some quickening by a Spirit, and some receiving thethings that are weary, and all very fitly.47. Or rather, I say, that he hath them not, but I declare the Truth, Heis All Things, not receiving them from without, but exhibiting themoutwardly.48. And this is the Sense and Understanding of God, to move allthings always.49. And there never shall be any time, when any of those things thatare, shall fail or be wanting.50. When I say the things that are, I mean God, for the things thatare, God hash; and neither is there anything without him, nor hewithout anything.51. These things, O Asclepius, will appear to be true, if thouunderstand them, but if thou understand them not, incredible.52. For to understand, is to believe, but not to believe, is not tounderstand; For my speech or words reach not unto the Truth, butthe Mind is great, and being led or conducted for a while by Speech, isable to attain to the Truth.53. And understanding all things round about, and finding themconsonant, and agreeable to those things that were delivered andinterpreted by Speech, believeth; and in that good belief, resteth.54. To them, therefore, that understand the things that have been saidof God, they are credible, but to them that understand them not,incredible.55. And let these and thus many things be spoken concerningUnderstanding and Sense."}]
