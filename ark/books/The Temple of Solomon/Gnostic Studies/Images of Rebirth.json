And are the two tractatesreferring to the same concept, or are they simply using similar terms?And what is the nature of the interpretive processes that come into playwhen we try to make sense of these statements?.

Rather, the references to rebirth in these texts mustbe understood, at least in part, as references to ritual processes, and theymust be seen in connection with related imagery utilised in these twoNag Hammadi tractates. For these texts not only speak about rebirth,butalsorefer toa broadrangeofrelated conceptsrelating toprocreationandkinshiprelations,likemarriage,fornicationandprostitution,fathers,sons, spouses, and siblings. All of these concepts play important roles indiscourses that centre around questions of salvation and ritual practice,often in combination with other familiar concepts derived from embod-ied experience such as eating and seeing.But how does such imagery function within the specific literary con-texts of the two selected texts? Why and to what effect do these textsfocus as they do on procreative and often sexually connotative imagery?Howisbodilybasedimageryusedtoexplicateimportantelementsofthereligious life, and how are we to know when and to what extent suchreferences are to be understood metaphorically? In short, how are weto understand the vividly changing and allusive use of such concepts inthese ancient texts?. Allusions and IntertextualityIn addition to the use and function of cognitive models derived from orrelated to embodied experience, however, there is also another impor-tant aspect of these texts that must be taken equally into consideration.MoststudiesontheNagHammaditractatesmentionparallels,influencesand borrowings from Scripture, but few have actually analysed the pat-terns and functions of such intertextual connections from a literary per-spective. This is especially the case with regard to the use of allusions.2AsLowellEdmundsstatesit,“whilephilologistspostulatelacunae,markcruces that defy conjecture, and diagnose anomalies that defy exegesis,with profound calm they pass over undiscerned and undiscernible allu-sions.”3The study of allusions is not without its methodological prob-lems, however, for, as Earl Miner has perceptively put it, “the test for2Foranotableexceptiontothistendency,seeLouisPainchaud,“TheUseofScripturein Gnostic Literature,”JECS (): –.3LowellEdmunds,IntertextualityandtheReadingofRomanPoetry(Baltimore:JohnsHopkinsUniversityPress,),.Seechapterforatheoreticaldiscussionofallusionsand intertextuality."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"introductionallusion is that it is a phenomenon that some reader or readers may failtoobserve.”4Inthepassage fromExeg.Soulquotedabove,forexample,itis perfectly possible to read andmake meaningful sense of the sentenceswithoutrecognisinganyscripturalallusions,whiletheinterpretivecom-binationoftexts that arisesfromseeing, forinstance,anallusion toTitus:and/orTim:maysignificantlyaltertheinterpretiveprocessandhencetheproductionofmeaningpromptedbyareadingofthispassage.5Iamthereforeconvincedthatnewinsightsmaybegainedfromourtextsby paying closer attention to the patterns of intertextuality on display inthem, including the use of allusions.6In both the selected texts, references to Scripture are pervasive, rang-ing from explicit quotations to the faintest of allusions. The importanceoftakingsuchreferencesfullyintoaccountinouranalysisofthemeaningpotential of the texts becomes especially clear in light of the practice ofmemorisation of Scripture in the cultural milieus where we may plausi-blysituatethesetractates’intendedaudiences.7AsJosteinBørtnesrightlystresses with regard to the use of memorised Scripture in the authorialpracticesoflateantiquity,“theemphasisonmemorizationdoesnotmeanthat the texts stored in the memory were also to be reproducedverbatimin rhetorical or literary practice. On the contrary, in rhetoric the wholepointwasthatmemorizedtextscouldbeplayedaroundwith,takenapart,and recombined into new patterns and new discourses.”8Exactly thiskind of playful recombination and repatterning of texts in rhetoric is an4Earl Miner, “Allusion,” inThe New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics(ed.Alex Preminger and T.V.F. Brogan; Princeton: Princeton University Press, ), .5See the analysis of this passage in chapter  of the present study.6As Claes Schaar puts it on a general basis, “The colossal mass of commentariesand annotations dealing with classical, medieval and Renaissance texts covers matterwhich, transformed to infracontextual patterns, might enrich the appreciation of thesurfacecontextsbybeingincorporatedinalarge-scalesemioticsystem:‘absentstructures’perhaps on the printed page, but very much present in attentive readers’ minds.

Suchan enterprise would also need to take fully into account the other fivetractates of the codex and how all seven of them interact in a readingof the codex as a whole. This kind of approach is outside the scopeof the present study, however, due to the expansive nature of such anundertaking. What I have tried to do is more modest, but still not farremoved from Emmel’s suggestion, as I do aim to focus on the readingexperience of the Coptic texts ofGos. Phil.andExeg. Soulas we findthem in Nag Hammadi Codex II. I have tried to read the two selectedtractates as much as possible on their own terms, both independentlyof each other and independently of the rest of the texts in Codex II andthe other Nag Hammadi codices. But although I do not focus strictly onthe manuscript as such, neither do I try to get back to any hypotheticaloriginals orVorlagen.What are the implications of such an approach? My focus on the textsaswehavetheminthepreservedmanuscriptmeansthat,althoughithasbeen argued that our Coptic versions presuppose Greek originals, I willstick to an analysis ofExeg. SoulandGos.

This then often results in additional or different informationbeing introduced into the text, and trying to comprehend or determinethe function-meaning of the Coptic by the Greek as a simple point of ref-erence is fundamentally wrong.36As Chris Reintges rightly notes, “where a Greek source is missing, thedistinction between original and translated literature becomes a mootpoint,” and, as he points out, “the originality of some work can generallynot be determined on the basis of linguistic criteria alone.”37Ihavethusdeemed it to be the most sound approach to simply stick to the texts asthey have actually been preserved, in the language in which they havebeen preserved, and not to try to analyse them on the basis of the Greekoriginals we think may lie behind the Coptic textsAnother reason for this approach is that there are good chances thatthe texts might have been substantially altered at one or more stages intheir transmission.

Souland especiallyGos.Phil.dealwiththeinterpretationofliturgymakessuchchangesespe-ciallylikely,sinceasPaulBradshawhaspersuasivelyargued,“documentsdealing with liturgical matters are particularly prone to editorial correc-tions so as to give authoritative status to current worship practices.”38or less confidently suspect to lie behind it?

Although these NagHammadi texts often do not seem to refer to the exact versions of theCoptic New Testament texts as we find them in preserved Coptic NewTestament manuscripts,49neither is it possible to discern any specificunderlying Greek text.

In his important bookRethinking“Gnosticism”: An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category,MichaelWilliams mounted the first extended case against the use of the categoryin the study of the Nag Hammadi texts. He here delineated two mainapproaches to the definition of “Gnosticism” among modern scholars.61The first approach, according to Williams, has been to ground the cat-egory in the self-definition, or at least self-designation, of certain fig-ures and groups in antiquity,62while the second approach has been todefine “Gnosticism” typologically.63Williams challenged the validity ofthe results of both of these approaches. Following partly in the foot-steps of Morton Smith,64Williams showed self-definition to be an inad-equate criteriononthegroundsthat thereisinfactscantevidencein thesources for its actual use among the groups or texts it has customarilybeen used to label.

For example, the expression “hewas atacrossroads inlife” isregardedasanexpression oftheunderlyingconceptual metaphor life is a journey. From this perspective a singleconceptualmetaphormaythereforeunderlie,andmotivate,manydiffer-ent metaphorical linguistic expressions.

Life may beajourney,butitmayalso,forinstance,beaday,asintheexpression“intheeveningoflife.”Similarly,deathmayalsobeconceivedofintermsofdeparture rather than sleep,26and god may be, for example, a shep-herd, a king, or a fortress.

In Kövecses and Radden’s definition,“Metonymy is a cognitive process in which one conceptual entity, thevehicle, provides mental access to another conceptual entity, the tar-get, within the same domain, or ICM.”30Onething,a,referredtoasthe vehicle entity, is thus seen to stand for another, b, referred to as thetarget entity.31Anexampleofthisisthecommonauthorforworkmetonymyasintheexpression“hewasreadingShakespeare.”Metonymyisdistinguishedfrommetaphormainlybythefactthataandbareassoci-ated withinasingledomainordomainmatrix,andbythefactthataand28ForZoltánKövecses’conceptsofthescopeofthesourceandrangeofthetargetin metaphorical relations, see Zoltán Kövecses, “The Scope of Metaphor,” inMetaphorand Metonymy at the Crossroads: A Cognitive Perspective(ed.

However, there are instanceswhere it fails to account for the complexity of the material. According tothewaymetaphoricalrelationsareconceptualisedwithintheframeworkof Conceptual Metaphor Theory, structure is projected from a sourcedomain to a single target domain.

Blending Theory also covers all kinds of conceptualblending, not just metaphorical relations. In sum, Blending Theory is atheory of considerably greater complexity and scope than ConceptualMetaphor Theory.The process of blending operates according to certain “structural anddynamic principles.”46Take for instance the interpretation of the eu-charistic elements as the body and blood of Christ. In this ConceptualIntegration Network (see fig. ) the eucharistic elements constitute oneof the input spaces, while the other is constituted by the body andbloodofChrist.Aconceptualblenddependsoncross-spacemappingsofcounterpart relations between the input spaces, and selective projectionof elements and structure from these into the blended space. In thisexample, there are counterpart mappings between the bread and wineinInputspacewith,respectively,thebodyandbloodofChristinInputspace.Thecommonfeatures emergingfromthecounterpartmappingsbetween these elements in the two input spaces make up the genericspace, in this case, for example, the abstract generic feature of “solid” iscommontothebreadandthebody,while“liquid”aswellas“redcolour”are common to the blood and the wine. Finally, selected elements andstructure of both input spaces are projected into the blended space,47where the eucharistic elements are identified as the body and blood ofChrist. In this particular Conceptual Integration Network it is also ofnote that the eucharistic bread and wine serve as material anchors forthe blend.48represents a structuring frame. Veale and O’Donoghue add a fifth “constructor space” tothis basic four-space model of conceptual blending in order to make it even more use-ful for computational purposes (Veale and O’Donoghue, “Computation and Blending,”esp. –).46See Fauconnier and Turner, “Conceptual Integration Networks,” .47In the figure (fig. ) I have included only the elements that are actually projected.48For the concept of material anchors, see Edwin Hutchins, “Material Anchors forConceptual Blends,”Journal of Pragmatics: (): –. For a BlendingTheoryanalysisofrituals,includingtheEucharist,seeSweetser,“BlendedSpacesandPerformativity.”"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesIn addition to dealing with such projections between mental spaces,Blending Theory also accounts for so-called emergent structure, that is,structure and elements emerging in the blend that have no counterpartsintheinputspaces.AccordingtoFauconnierandTurner,theprincipleofemergent structure works in the following way.49First, in what they call“composition,” the blend is created by the elements selectively projectedfrom the input spaces putting elements from each of the input spacesin new relations to each other. This process of composition often, butnot always, entails fusion in the blend of some of the elements projectedinto it. Then, through the process of “completion,” patterns in the blendthat have come into being through the process of “composition” evokeinformationinlong-termmemorythatisusedtofillintheblendaroundthe already composed elements. And finally, in the third stage, the stageof “elaboration,” the event in the blended space is simulated mentally(this is often referred to as the “running of the blend”). In this processthe blend may be elaborated upon in ways that are in principle limit-less.In the Eucharist example, it is only in the blend that the bread andwinebecomeidentifiedwiththebodyandbloodofChrist,andthereforeit is only in the blend that the consumption of the bread and the wine isunderstoodastheconsumptionofthebodyandbloodofChrist.Indeed,consuming the body and blood of Christ is only possible in the blendedspace, since only here is it possible to regard his body and blood as foodand drink, which are the exclusive properties of the first input space andprojectedtotheblendfromthere.Also,onlyintheblenddoestheeatinganddrinkingofthebreadandwinecometoimplysuchentailmentsastheunificationwithChrist.WemaythussaythattheritualoftheEucharistisdependent on the blend depicted here, and that the eucharistic elementsare its material anchors.The blend resulting from a Conceptual Integration Network oftencontains events and imagery that may be impossible in the real world,but which may still be of great cognitive value. For example, the con-cept of the Grim Reaper, a hooded skeleton with a scythe represent-ing death, is patently absurd and implausible in the real world, but thatdoes not detract from the usefulness of the blend as a cognitive model.5049For a concise account of this process, see Fauconnier and Turner, “ConceptualIntegration Networks.”50ForaBlendingTheoryanalysisoftheconceptoftheGrimReaper,see,e.g.,Faucon-nier and Turner,The Way We Think, –."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"chapter twoIn this blend, specific aspects of death are “brought to life” in a man-ner that is both vivid and easy to remember, which thus illustrates thecommon phenomenon that “productive inference ... can arise fromimplausible blendsconstructedinmentalspaces,” as SeanaCoulson putsit.51It should be noted that once a Conceptual Integration Network hasbeen established we do not do our mental work exclusively within theblended space, but we use the network as a whole. In the words ofFauconnier and Turner, “we know the connection of the blend to theinput spaces, and the way that structure or inferences developed inthe blend translates back to the input spaces. We work over all fourspaces simultaneously, but the blend gives us structure, integration, andefficiency not available in the other spaces.”52It is also important to notethat structure and elements from the blend may in turn be projectedbackwards to the input spaces, which may create yet new inferences andmodify the input spaces in the process.53Depending on the discursiveand situational context, the same Conceptual Integration Network maythusgiverisetoquitedifferentandcomplexresultsintheblendedspace.Moreover, the process of running the blend may also call up new inputspaces,recruitnewstructure,elements,andframes,andcontributetothecreation of new blends. Indeed, the blended space itself may become aninput space in another Conceptual Integration Network.54The functions of the fourth space in the network, the generic space,also need to be mentioned. What is common to the input spaces, oftenabstract structure, constitutes the generic space, which maps onto thecounterparts.55The primary function of the generic space is thus oneof cohesion, contributing towards keeping the network together, but, inaddition, this space may also facilitate the recruitment of further inputspacestotheblend.InthewordsofSeanaCoulson,“theabilitytoreframesomething at a higher level of abstraction (as in a representation evokedin the generic space of a frame network) may serve as a retrieval cue51Seana Coulson, “Semantic Leaps: The Role of Frame-Shifting and ConceptualBlending in Meaning Construction” (Ph.D. diss., University of California, San Diego,), .52Fauconnier and Turner, “Blending,” .53Forbackwardprojection,seeFauconnier andTurner,“ConceptualIntegration Net-works,” , .54See, e.g., Evans and Green,Cognitive Linguistics, .55See,e.g.,FauconnierandTurner,“ConceptualIntegrationNetworks,”–,."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesfor frames which would have been otherwise unavailable.”56It should benoted,however,thatinmorecomplexConceptualIntegrationNetworks,with more than two input spaces, the latter need not all share the samegeneric space,57but having a shared generic space makes the network asa whole more cohesive....Vital RelationsLooking more closely at the cross-space mappings of counterpart rela-tions between input spaces, the so-called “outer-space” links, and the“inner-space” links between elements within a single mental space, Fau-connier and Turner enumerate fifteen different types of links, termed“vital relations”between elements mapped inthis way.These linksrangefromsuchpropertiesasAnalogy,Representation,andSimilarity,toTimeand Space.58It is a major feature of blending that outer-space vital rela-tions tend to be scaled down, strengthened, and compressed to inner-space relations in the blend.59For example, in the Eucharist-blend, de-scribed above, there are outer-space vital relations of similarity and rep-resentation between, respectively, wine and blood, and bread and body,that are compressed to identity in the blend.What governs the compression of vital relations is first of all the over-arching goal, postulated by Fauconnier and Turner, to “achieve humanscale” in the blend. Among the most notable subgoals of this process isto “strengthen vital relations,” “compress what is diffuse,” and to “obtainglobal insight.”60Whatthismeansinlesstechnicaltermsisthatthe56Coulson, “Semantic Leaps,” . Coulson is here discussing a so-called framenetwork, but the principle holds true for any kind of network. As we shall see below,the notion of the generic space plays an important part in conceptualising the functionsof a canon in interpretation from the perspective of Blending Theory.57See Fauconnier and Turner,The Way We Think, .58For a description and list of the fifteen different vital relations, see Fauconnier andTurner,The Way We Think, –. The fifteen vital relations are as follows: Change,Identity,Time,Space,Cause-Effect,Part-Whole,Representation,Role,Analogy,Disanal-ogy, Property, Similarity, Category, Intentionality, and Uniqueness. Joseph Grady arguesconvincingly for the addition of Correlation to this list (see Joseph Grady, “PrimaryMetaphors as Inputs to Conceptual Blends,”Journal of Pragmatics: []: –).59“Blends systematically scale down relations, compress relations into others, andeven create new relations” (Fauconnier and Turner,The Way We Think, ).60See, e.g., Fauconnier and Turner,The Way We Think,–. RecentlyCarlBacheand Anders Hougaard have argued convincingly in favour of balancing Fauconnier andTurner’s focus on conceptual integration and compression by also introducing the idea"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"chapter twopurpose of blending is to compress and simplify complex mental struc-tures to a scale at which they become more easily manageable to thehuman mind, making it possible to think in terms of familiar objects,actions, and situations.61Examples of this are when the entire history ofevolution is thought of in terms of the time-scale of a single day, mak-ing it possible to state that while the dinosaurs appeared on the scene atpm, humans only showed up at the stroke of midnight,62or when wereduce the sun and the planets to the size of melons, oranges, and otherfruits in order to enable us to grasp more easily their relative sizes andthe vast distances between them in the solar system. Similarly, the con-cept of god is reduced to human scale when conceptualised in terms ofthe familiar concepts of father or king.63...A Taxonomy of BlendsWe have seen that Conceptual Metaphor Theory accounts only for uni-directional projection between two domains. Blending Theory, whichis a much more versatile and dynamic model of meaning production,accounts for the kind of unidirectional metaphorical projection thatis handled by Conceptual Metaphor Theory by treating it as one kindof Conceptual Integration Network among many, the type Fauconnierand Turner would call a one-sided shared topology network. This net-work has two input spaces, corresponding to the source and the tar-get domains, and the usual generic and blended spaces, but the blendedspaceinthiskindofnetworkrecruitsitsframestructureexclusivelyfromone of the input spaces—from that which corresponds to the sourcedomain.64of conceptual disintegration. They have emphasised that the goal of achieving “humanscale” is often reached through splitting, disintegration and expansion rather than bycompression and integration (see Carl Bache, “Constraining Conceptual IntegrationTheory: Levels of Blending and Disintegration,”Journal of Pragmatics: []:–;AndersHougaard,“ConceptualDisintegrationandBlendinginInteractionalSequences:ADiscussionofNewPhenomena,Processesvs.Products,andMethodology,”Journal of Pragmatics: []: –).61See Fauconnier and Turner,The Way We Think, ; Evans and Green,CognitiveLinguistics, –.62For this example, see Evans and Green,Cognitive Linguistics, –.63For an analysis of these and other metaphors for God using Blending Theory, seeDesCamp and Sweetser, “Metaphors for God”.64See Fauconnier and Turner, “Conceptual Integration Networks,” –. For anin-depth treatment of metaphorical blends, see Grady, “Primary Metaphors as Inputs”."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesBlending operations may be simple or complex,65but the type ofnetwork that Turner has especially emphasised is the so-called “double-scope” network.66Such networks have “inputs with different (and oftenclashing) organizing frames and an organizing frame for the blend thatincludespartsofeachofthoseorganizingframesandhasemergentstructure of its own.”67The central feature of such blends is the factthat the differences in the projected organising frames, both of whichcontribute to the blend, “offer the possibility of rich clashes,” as Turnerputsit.68“Farfromblockingtheconstructionofthenetwork,suchclashesoffer challenges to the imagination and the resulting blends can turnout to be highly creative.”69Blends of the kind I will be analysing in thefollowing chapters fall more often than not into the category of double-scope, or even multiple-scope....Blending Theory vs. Conceptual Metaphor TheoryWehaveseenherethatConceptualMetaphorTheoryandBlendingThe-ory are quite different. However, the two theoretical approaches may beregardedascomplementary,ratherthancontradictory.70While Concep-tual Metaphor Theory deals mostly with stable knowledge structures inlong-term memory,and is useful whendealing with relatively stable andsimpleconceptualstructures,itison-linemeaningproductionthatisthefocus of Blending Theory, which is also considerably more helpful whenitcomestotheanalysisofmorecomplexandcreativeconceptualblends,not to mention the analysis of emergent structure. As we have seen,one of the central motivations for Blending Theory is that it accountsfor so-called “emergent structure” resulting from cross-space mappings,i.e., structurethat does notderive from either inputspace, butneverthe-less emerges in the conceptual blend. However, it should be noted that65For the complete typology of blends, see Fauconnier and Turner,The Way WeThink.66See esp.

The basic mechanisms of the theory apply regardless of whethernew structure emerges from the blending or not.71Another strength of Blending Theory is that it accounts for the kindsof phenomena that the Invariance Hypothesis excludes by default, mostnotably cross-space projection of elements and structure in more thanone direction.72Blending Theory’s ability to handle the interanimationof mental spaces, and ultimately of the cognitive models or texts theyderivefrom,isapreconditionfortheusefulnessofthetheoryinhandlingthe majority of the conceptual blends that are analysed in the followingchapters,andalsoforitsapplicabilitytotheanalysisofallusionsandotherintertextual relations....Blending, Cognitive Architecture, and MemoryIn terms of cognitive architecture, Fauconnier and Turner claim that“mentalspacesoperateinworkingmemory,”andthat“elementsinmen-tal spaces correspond to activated neuronal assemblies and linking be-tween elements corresponds to some kind of neurobiological binding,such as co-activation.”73This means that Blending Theory finds itselfsomewhere between a connectionist and a representationalist cognitivearchitecturewhiletheconnectiontoeitherofthemiskeptrathervague.74Since it stays on a level of abstraction that, as Patrick Colm Hogan haspointed out, is neutral with regard to cognitive architecture,75Blending71See Coulson,Semantic Leaps, .72SeePeterStockwell’sdevastatingcritiqueoftheInvarianceHypothesisinStockwell,“The Inflexibility of Invariance”.

As Hogan puts it, “primeditems are, in effect, brought out of long-term memory, though they arenotaccesseddirectlyinconsciousness.”77Such items thus come to be “ina different mental state from either the conscious/rehearsal material orthematerialstoredinlong-termmemory.”78Wemaythinkofthestatusofprimed memories as having been “placed temporarily in a sort of bufferbetweenlong-termmemoryandconsciousness.”79Formypurposeshere,themostimportantfeatureofthenotionofprimingistheinsightthattheactivationofonememoryprimesrelatedmemories,whichconsequently“makes it more likely that some of those semiactivated memories willalso be recalled.”80In this sense, priming helps us to understand the wayinwhichmentalspacesarecalleduptoprocessesofblendinginworkingmemory.

Here the conceptualmetaphor society is a family is especially productive, leading to theconceptualisation of society in terms of the concept of family. Often,however, cognitive models are defined by a set of metaphors, each high-lightingdifferentaspectsoftheICM.85Thecognitivemodelforsocietyisfor instance also structured by the metaphors society is a person andsociety is a machine.86At the same time, family and machine arethemselves ICMs. Still, even though a concept is defined by a cluster ofcognitivemodels,itispsychologically easiertograspasasingleconcept,rather than as the sum of its constituents.87The elements and structure that make up an ICM become closelylinkedinexperience,andthusinpeople’smemory,andthisfacilitatesthepriming and activation of related elements of the ICM once one element81ForthetheoryofIdealizedCognitiveModels,seeLakoff,Women,Fire,andDanger-ous Things.82Raymond W.

However, the level of priming and activation followsfrom the prototype effects pertaining to ICMs. In most cases, not all oftheconstituentsofanICMareofequalimportance.ICMsareusuallyradial or graded in one or more ways, and this causes prototype effects.88When, for example, an ICM is brought to mind in a general sense, oneis likely to think of it differently than when it is activated in a specificcontext. One might say that the features that are central to the ICM aremore easily activated in a general activation of the cognitive model thanthelesscentralones,whilethelattermaybemoreeasilybroughttomindin specific contexts.89In terms of Blending Theory, ICMs may be encountered as providersof input spaces to Conceptual Integration Networks. In this sense theyareequivalenttodomains,buttheelementofstructureistoagreaterdegree inherent in the concept of an ICM than in that of a domain, thusmaking the former term more useful for our purposes than the latter. Attimes,anICMmayalsoberegardedasthecognitivemodelthatprovidesthe category structure for the whole blending network as well as for theindividual spaces in the network. Blending Theory may in turn be usedto model the internal workings of an ICM, the combination of ICMs orexpansion of ICMs.90Following Raymond Gibbs, I would like to stress the inherently dy-namic nature of ICMs and their functions in metaphorical meaningconstruction. As Gibbs has argued,understanding literary texts, similar to any act of meaning construal, isnot a matter of accessing highly structured knowledge, in the form ofabstract prototypes, from long-term memory. Instead, text understandingis a dynamic activity that relies on concrete, often embodied information,which people creatively compose in the moment of reading.91This means that when the reader encounters in a text, for example,the metaphorical source ICM of machine in the conceptual metaphorthe mind is a machine, he or she draws on concrete knowledge of88See, e.g., Stockwell, “The Inflexibility of Invariance,” .89On prototypes and prototype effects, see, e.g., Lakoff,Women, Fire, and DangerousThings;EleanorH.Rosch,“NaturalCategories,”Cognitive Psychology (): –; Eleanor Rosch, et al., “Basic Objects in Natural Categories,”Cognitive Psychology():–;BarbaraLewandowska-Tomaszczyk,“Polysemy,Prototypes,andRadialCategories,” inThe Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics(ed.

Traditionally, intertextuality and metaphor have beenviewed as separate phenomena and treated within different theoreticalframeworks and largely within different scholarly fields and traditions.However,thereareimportantpointsofcontactbetweenthemwhichsug-gest the possibility that they might fruitfully be treated within a unifiedtheoretical framework. Such an overarching framework, I want to sug-gest, may be found in an adaptation of Blending Theory. Peter Stockwellhas recently pointed out thattaking “the cognitive turn” seriously ... means a thorough re-evaluationof all of the categories with which we understand literary reading andanalysis. In doing this, however, we do not have to throw away all of theinsightsfromliterarycriticismandlinguisticanalysisthathavebeendrawnout in the past. Many of those patterns of understanding form very useful92Gibbs, “Prototypes,” –.93Gibbs, “Prototypes,” .94Gibbs, “Prototypes,” .95Gibbs, “Prototypes,” ."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesstarting points for cognitive poetic investigation. Some of them requireonly a little reorientation to offer a new way of looking at literary reading.Occasionally, this might seem to be no more than recasting old ideas withnew labels. I would argue (along cognitive linguistic lines) that new labelsforce us to conceptualise things differently.96I fully share Stockwell’s sentiment and would argue that one field ofliterary theoretical investigation that needs only a little reorientation inordertobeadaptedforacognitivepoeticmethodologyisthatofthestudyof intertextuality.97Similarities between the phenomena of metaphor and allusion haveindeed been noted by several scholars of classics and literature. GianBiagio Conte, for instance, has treated allusion as a rhetorical trope onthe same level as metaphor. According to Conte, “allusion works in justthe same way, and in the same semantic area, as a rhetorical figure.”98Although Conte here presupposes the traditional view of metaphor asa rhetorical figure, his observation of the similarities between metaphorand allusion is useful when seen within the cognitive poetic framework,outlined above. From this perspective, Conte’s description of the simi-larities between allusions and tropes is highly suggestive. “In both allu-sion and the trope,” writes Conte, “the poetic dimension is created bythe simultaneous presence of two different realities whose competitionwith one another produces a single more complex reality. Such literaryallusion produces the simultaneous coexistence of both a denotative and96Stockwell,Cognitive Poetics,.97Forarecentoverviewofthetheoreticalconceptofintertextuality,seeGrahamAllen,Intertextuality(TheNewCriticalIdiom;London:Routledge,).Foracomprehensivebibliography of studies on or within the framework of intertextuality up until the lateeighties, see Udo J.

Indeed, Ziva Ben-Porat’s highlyevocativetheoryofthepoeticsofallusion,outlinedinherimportantarticle “The Poetics of Literary Allusion,”100may now serve as a usefullinkbetweentraditionalliteraryapproachestoallusionandcurrentviewswithin cognitive poetics. Ben-Porat’s definition of allusion provides anapt illustration:Theliteraryallusionisadeviceforthesimultaneousactivationoftwotexts.The activation is achieved through the manipulation of a special signal: asign (simple or complex) in a given text characterized by an additionallarger “referent.” This referent is always an independent text. The simulta-neous activation of the two texts thus connected results in the formationof intertextual patterns whose nature cannot be predetermined.101In a similar vein, Ellen van Wolde stated in  that intertextual rela-tions are “a part of the reader’s general semiotic actualization process,”a process focussed on the reader, “because the reader achieves intertex-tualsemiosisthroughlogicalandanalogicalreasoningininteractionwiththe text.”102She claimed further that these intertextual relationships “donot concern the similarity between text and referent but the ability ofthe reader to conceive of the worlds of the text as possible or to recon-struct them, or, in other words, to give them contents by relating themto his own living- and reading-experiences.”103According to van Wolde,the reader thus “turns the possible worlds of the text into realities.”104The notion that the intertextual connections between sign-systemsamount to the creation of entirely new systems of signification has alsobeen emphasised by the scholar who coined the term intertextuality in99Conte,Rhetoricof Imitation,.Note,however,thatwithincognitivelinguisticsthedifferences between denotation and connotation have been all but erased (see TomaszP.Krzeszowski,“Connotation andDenotation,”inReferenceinMultidisciplinaryPerspec-tive:PhilosophicalObject,CognitiveSubject,IntersubjectiveProcess[ed.RichardA.Geiger;Hildesheim: Georg Olms, ], –).100Ziva Ben-Porat, “The Poetics of Literary Allusion,”PTL: A Journal for DescriptivePoetics and Theory of Literature (): –.101Ben-Porat, “Poetics of Literary Allusion,” .102Ellen van Wolde, “Trendy Intertextuality?” inIntertextuality in Biblical Writings:Essays in Honour of Bas van Iersel(ed.

As Joseph Pucci points out, a theory like thatof Ben-Porat amounts to “a strong claim for an empowered reader.”110In such approaches, the process of intertextuality is located in readers’105For Kristeva’s original formulation of intertextuality, see Julia Kristeva, “Le mot, ledialogueetleroman,”inΣημειωτικ\t:Recherchespourunesémanalyse(Paris:Seuil,),–, ortheEnglishtranslation, “Word, Dialogue,and Novel,”inDesireinLanguage:A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art(ed.

Despite Kristeva’s change of term, however, theterm intertextuality “remains, nearly a quarter of a century later, an important part ofthe fabric of contemporary terminology, used indiscriminately by students of allusion ofeverystripeandcriticalinclination,” asJosephPucciputsit(Pucci,Full-Knowing Reader,).107Kristeva,Revolution in Poetic Language, –.108Kristeva,RevolutioninPoeticLanguage,.Thenumberofdifferenttermsthathavebeenemployedtodescribesimilarnotionsoftransferbetweenandcombinationoftextualand extra-textual sign systems is quite bewildering.

We have seen how Ziva Ben-Porat in themid-seventies conceived of the intertextual patterns created by meansof literary allusions, and also how van Wolde’s concept of the actualisa-tion of intertextual relationships comes very close to Blending Theory’snotionofthe blendingofmental spaces.113VanWolde’s view ofintertex-tuality in the late eighties thus seems especially close to contemporaryviews within cognitive poetics.114The same may also be said of Conte’s111George Aichele,The Control of Biblical Meaning: Canon as Semiotic Mechanism(Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press, ), .112Pucci,Full-Knowing Reader, . Pucci even refers to an “allusive space,” which hedescribesasa“mentalplacewheretheallusionismadetomean,”aconceptthatturnsoutto berather similar to Blending Theory’s notion of theblended space. AsPucci describesit, the “allusive space” “exists apart from the referential and significative control of thelanguage that gives rise to it. So, too, are the meanings that arise in it unique, becausethey result from an interpretive free-play on the part of the reader, as the dissonances oftwodiscreteworksaremediatedinthegiveandtakeofamental,interpretivedialogue.Asit turns out, that dialogue may extend to places and topics that have nothing at all to dowith the two works that constitute the allusion, whose language nonetheless occasionstheir articulation, if only momentarily. This dialogue ensures that the reader assumescompleteinterpretivepowerovertheallusivemoment—andattheexpenseoftheauthor,whose power evanesces” (ibid., ).113For the relationship between possible worlds theory and mental space theory, seeSemino, “Possible Worlds”.114It is worthy of note that she has recently edited a book on the use of cognitiveperspectives in scriptural exegesis, Ellen van Wolde, ed.,Job : Cognition in Context(Biblical Interpretation ; Leiden: Brill, )."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesemphasis on the centrality of the evocation of thoughts for the functionof both allusions and metaphors.115Ziva Ben-Porat conceived of the interplay that is established betweentexts through the use of allusions in terms of the dialogical relationshipbetween two independent spaces. Using terminology borrowed fromConceptual Metaphor Theory we may refer to each of the texts in thisrelationshipasthesourceandthetargettextsrespectively,eachrepresent-ingitsowndomain.However,since,asBen-Poratnotedinherarticle,theintertextualrelationshipworksbothways,116causingareinterpretationofboth the alluding (target) text and the evoked (source) text, ConceptualMetaphor Theory is structurally too simple to be suited to conceptualisethis kind of relationship. Blending Theory, on the other hand, is ideallysuited to model what Ben-Porat described in terms of intertextual pat-terning, and the unpredictable production of meaning that arises fromit.117Conte’sassertionthatinbothmetaphorandallusion,“thepoetryliesinthesimultaneouspresenceoftwodifferentrealitiesthattrytoindicateasinglereality,”118is clearly in line with the focus and interests of Blend-ing Theory.We have seen that Blending Theory may prove to be a powerful toolintheinterpretationofconceptualblends,whethertheybemetaphorical,counterfactual,orotherwise.ItisthusallthemoresurprisingthatBlend-ing Theory has so far hardly been applied to the analysis of allusions orother kinds of intertextual relations. Peter Stockwell and Eve Sweetserhave indeed suggested the possibility of doing so, but few have so faranswered the call.119WhereBlendingTheoryusuallyoperateswithmentalspacesthatariseon the basis of domains or ICMs, which may thus aptly be termedconceptualblending,Isuggestthatwemayalsoregardmemoriesoftexts115See Conte,Rhetoric of Imitation, .116Ben-Porat, “Poetics of Literary Allusion,”  n. .117In addition, it also fits well with the fact that, in her theory as well, although sheuses different terms, the blended space may recruit structure from the intertextual inputspaces that lie outside of the actual allusive device or signal used to activate them.118Conte,Rhetoric of Imitation, .119See Stockwell,Cognitive Poetics, –; Eve Sweetser, “Whose Rhyme is WhoseReason?

Blend-ing Theory promises to provide us with such a framework.123Not onlymay theories of allusion and intertextuality, and cognitive theories ofmetaphor be incorporated rather smoothly within the framework ofBlending Theory, but the latter may also contribute substantially to theformer theories with its added flexibility and theoretical sophistication.Inmyview,BlendingTheoryclearlyhasmuchtoofferintermsofgreatertheoretical specificity and clarity in cases of complex metaphors andcomposite intertextual allusions, features that are so common in the lit-erary works from the Nag Hammadi Codices.122For an application of notions of foregrounding, or “figure” and “ground,” in cogni-tive poetic analysis, see Peter Stockwell, “Surreal Figures,” inCognitive Poetics in Practice(ed.

So, while it may be necessary to aban-don any hopes of reaching definitive answers, we have at least an ana-lytical tool that enables us to outline interpretive possibilities. It is themapping of such potential interpretations in the two selected tractatesfrom the Nag Hammadi Codices that is the focus of the following chap-ters.With regard to the integration network diagrams that are usedthroughout this study it is important to keep in mind what they are andwhat they are not. The diagrams should be seen as analytical tools andas a supplement to the verbal exposition of the texts. They are definitelynottoberegardedasself-sufficient,orasprovidingacompletepictureofany process of blending. Rather, they must be regarded as being akin tosnapshots of mental processes of blending that focus on certain aspectsand disregard others. Such a diagram can never capture such a processin its entirety and is not to be understood on its own apart from the ver-bal exposition. The necessity of using such diagrams as analytical tools,and of showing explicitly the Conceptual Integration Networks in theanalyses ofExeg.SoulandGos.Phil.,stemsfromthefactthatweasmod-ern scholars do not have the same frames of reference, the same con-ceptsorintertextspresentinourheads(inmemory)whenreadingtheseNagHammaditextsasthosewhoreadtheminantiquitydid.Itthereforeproveshelpfulinouranalysisandexpositionofthetextstomakeexplicitthepossibleblendsthatmayhavebeenautomaticallytriggeredwhenthetexts were read by various ancient readers.. Interpretive Contexts and Communities“It is a commonplace of literary criticism,” Margaret Freeman pointsout, “that one of the defining characteristics of literature is its ability"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesto generate multiple meanings and interpretations.”124Although literarycritics, and, I might add, interpreters of the Nag Hammadi texts, “areadept at producing such readings, readings which are often insightfulandilluminating,”Freemanrightlynotesthatthey“tendtoassumeratherthan explore the principles and the processes by which such multiplicityoccurs.”125Blending Theory, however, not only shows us that a multi-plicity ofpossible meaningsisaninevitable outcomeofinterpretivepro-cesses, but it also shows us how and why this is the case. The fact that itgoesunnoticedmostofthetimeis“afunctionoftheavailabilityofcertainframes through defaults, contexts, or culture,” as Fauconnier and Turnerput it.126Now, what are the constraints and influences that guide suchinterpretive processes?..Authorial Intention and the Role of the ReaderIn the words of Margaret Freeman, “literary texts are the products ofcognizing minds and their interpretations the products of other cog-nizing minds in the context of the physical and sociocultural worlds inwhich they have been created and read.”127It should not be necessaryto point out that there are differences between these various minds andtheir respective contexts. Surprisingly, however, Fauconnier and Turnerdo not address the question of where the process of blending is actuallyconsidered to occur. Is it in the author, the reader, or in the text itself? InFauconnier and Turner’s work this is kept rather vague, but most oftenthey seem to assume that the blendssimply exist inthe texts orartworksthattheyanalyse.However,asliterarytheoristshaverepeatedly stressed,questionsregardingtherelationshipbetweenauthor,text,andreaderareneither easy nor trivial.For one thing, there is the old thorny question of authorial intention.Are the Conceptual Integration Networks we identify to be regarded asthe intended products of empirical authors, or do we regard them asarisingfromthe“textsthemselves,”orasproductsofthereader(s),andifso, which reader(s)?124Freeman, “Poetry,” .125Freeman, “Poetry,” .126Fauconnier and Turner, “Polysemy and Conceptual Blending,” .127Freeman, “Poetry,” ."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"chapter twoRecognising this shortcoming in the theories of Fauconnier & Turnerand others, Tim Rohrer addresses the question in a recent article.128RohrersuggeststhatweoughttooperatewithdifferentConceptualInte-grationNetworksfortheauthorandthereader.Arguingconvincinglyforthe needamongblendingtheoriststo “make explicit the contentsof pre-cisely whose head or heads they are claiming to model,” Rohrer presentsa model of “space-swapping” between the authorial and the interpretivenetworks. Basically, what he suggests is that what counts as a blendedspacefromtheauthor’sperspectiveshouldberegardedasaninputspacefrom the perspective of the reader. It follows from this approach that,although we may speculate as much as we want, as interpreters we willneverbeabletoascertaintheextentandnatureoftheauthorialblendingprocess, but will only ever have access to the interpretive side of things.The only authorial intention we can speak of, the only intentionality thatis reachable to any reader, will be the one created in a reader’s mind inorder to make sense of the text as it is read, which may or may not corre-spond to the intentions of the empirical author.The notion of authorial intentionality still has an important role toplay,however.Notonlymaywespeculateastothepossiblenatureofthe authorial blending network, but the hypothetical authorial intentionthat is constructed in the mind of the reader should also be regarded asa powerful cognitive model that is used in the interpretation of the text.Raymond Gibbs points out the centrality of this, stating thatthe meaning of a text is generated by hypothesizing intentions authorsmighthavehad,giventhecontextofcreation,ratherthanrelyingonortry-ing to seek out the author’s subjective intentions. Readers’ interpretationsof texts depend on their inferences about a hypothetical author foundedin the linguistic conventions and artistic practices at the time the authorwrote the work, as well as in publicly available knowledge of how the textwas created. A work might display a multiplicity of meanings given thelarge set of intentions readers can hypothesize about an author and theconditions under which a work was written. This multiplicity of meaningsisperfectly appropriatetopropose,eveniftheactualauthorintendedonlya single interpretation for a text.129128Tim Rohrer, “Mimesis, Artistic Inspiration and the Blends We Live By,”Journal ofPragmatics: (): –.129RaymondW.Gibbs,Jr.,Intentions in the Experience of Meaning(Cambridge: Cam-bridge University Press, ), .

This readerly constructedintentionality is,of course,subject to change in the course of the process of reading and re-readingthe text, for no interpretation will ever be stable, as contexts may changeand new input spaces may always be introduced, causing our mentalblended spaces to shift in ways that will always to some extent be lessthan predictable...The Function and Effects of ContextHow do we recognise a metaphor when we see one? Conceptual Meta-phor Theory and Blending Theory are powerful theories of metaphorinterpretation, but they do not explain how metaphorical expressions,or other kinds of figurative language, may actually be identified as such.Indeed, several scholars have challenged the notion that we should, oreven can, distinguish between metaphorical and literal statements orutterancesatall.The“commonsensedichotomybetween‘literal’and‘fig-urative’ is a psychological illusion,”130states Mark Turner. Patrick ColmHogan has recently argued in favour of the dismissal of the dichotomy,stating thatcognitive principles indicate that this is a misguided question. In a cogni-tive framework, there is nothing about a sentence, divorced from humanminds, that would make it literal or metaphorical, or meaningful in anyway. Meaning is just a function of cognitive processing, whether thatof a speaker, a listener, a writer, or a reader. Put differently, there is nosuch thing as a metaphorical—or, for that matter, literal—statement perse. Rather, there are only literal and metaphorical intents and literal andmetaphoricalinterpretationsor,moretechnically,literalandmetaphoricalgenerativeprocessesandliteralandmetaphoricalinterpretiveprocesses.131Hogan distinguishes between what he calls a demarcation criterion anda decision criterion when it comes to metaphor identification. The for-mer of these two is a criterion for distinguishing between literal andmetaphorical statements, and the latter is a criterion for determining130MarkTurner,“Figure,”inFigurativeLanguageandThought(ed.AlbertN.Katz,etal.;Counterpoints: Cognition, Memory, and Language; New York: Oxford University Press,), .131Hogan,Cognitive Science, ."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"chapter twowhentointerpretanexpressionmetaphoricallyorliterally.Heconcludesthat what distinguishes literal from metaphorical interpretation is “not amatter of the terms themselves, nor of any specific part of their lexicalstructure or properties, nor of the relations between these structures orproperties. Rather, it is a matter of our presumption regarding the trans-fer of source properties to the target.”132From this demarcation crite-rion Hogan deduces that a “decision criterion” does not exist. He notesthat many theorists have mistaken their demarcation criteria for deci-sion criteria, and points out that his own proposed demarcation crite-rion“cannotserveasadecisioncriterion,becauseitconcernsinterpretiveassumptions, not objective properties of or objective relations betweenthesourceandthetarget.”133So,ifwegrantthatthedecisiononwhethertounderstandastatementmetaphorically or literally depends on the reader, we need to take a lookatwhatguidesthereader’sinterpretation.AccordingtoHogan,“youcan’ttell ametaphor bylooking at it.”134Instead,“wechooseametaphoricalorliteral interpretation on the basis of a wide range of empirical factors—knowledge of the speaker, of the situation, of common usage, et cetera—inconnectionwithgeneralconcernsforlogicalconsistencyandexplana-torysimplicity.”135Thisistrueevenwithregardtostatementsthatseemtobeobviouslymetaphorical,sinceeventhese“maybeintendedliterallyinarelevantcontext.”136Context is thus of primary importance. Accordingto Seana Coulson,context-freeexpressionmeaningisanillusionbasedontheuseofdefaults.Instead,understandinglanguageutterancesinvolvesintegratinglinguistic,contextual, and background knowledge to yield cognitive models withwhich to incorporate the content of expressions and their implications forthe interpretation of the larger speech activity.137So, context is of central importance in anydecision on whether languageshould be regarded as metaphorical or not. Often, however, it is not acase of an either/or situation. Put in terms of Blending Theory, “the132Hogan,Cognitive Science, .133Hogan,Cognitive Science, .134Hogan,Cognitive Science, .135Hogan,Cognitive Science, .136Hogan,Cognitive Science, .137Coulson,“SemanticLeaps,”.Morerecently,thisconcernwiththeimportanceofcontext hasresultedinCoulson andOakleyincorporating aseparate“groundingbox”intheir conceptual integration diagrams (see Seana Coulson and Todd Oakley, “Blendingand Coded Meaning: Literal and Figurative Meaning in Cognitive Semantics,”Journal ofPragmatics: []: –)."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesunpacking possibilities offered by the blended space will depend onwhat is already active in the context of communication.”138A linguisticexpression, according to Fauconnier,does not have a meaning in itself; rather, it has ameaning potential,and it is only within a complete discourse and in context that meaningwill actually be produced. The unfolding of discourse brings into playcomplexcognitiveconstructions. Theyincludethesettingupofinternallystructured domains linked to each other by connectors; this is effected onthebasisoflinguistic,contextual,andsituationalclues.Grammaticalclues,although crucial to the building process, are in themselves insufficient todetermine it.139One of the main obstacles facing us in the interpretation of historicaldocuments like those of the Nag Hammadi Codices, however, lies in thefact that we have no certain knowledge of their historical context(s). Forus, the Nag Hammadi tractates must be regarded as utterances that havebeen removed from their original contexts. However, no interpretationis ever context-free. Coulson, as we saw, calls it an illusion, and as EveSweetser points out, “we can only actually interpret complex linguisticformsbyconstructingsomepossibleuseorusesofthoseformstoconveymeaning.”140This observation holds true not only with regard to small-scale lexical units, but with regard to any kind of interpretation. Whencontext is lacking, we, as readers, automatically provide it, consciouslyand subconsciously, in the process of interpretation, for “in reading,we assimilate what we read to the schemata of what we already know.Themoreweknowthemoreweunderstand,andweprojectwhatweknow to constructa world suggested by the text,”141in Keith Oatley’s aptformulation....The Identification and Interpretation of AllusionsAsalreadymentioned,anallusionis“aphenomenonthatsomereaderorreaders may fail to observe.”142In terms of cognitive theory this meansthat, in the same way as a metaphor may also be interpreted strictlyliterally,byinterpretingthesourceinputwithoutblendingitwithatarget,a potential intertextual trigger in a text may or may not be activated and138Fauconnier and Turner,The Way We Think, .139Fauconnier,Mappings, –.140Sweetser, “Compositionality and Blending,” .141Oatley, “Writingandreading,” .142Miner, “Allusion,” ."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"chapter twocall up the intertextual input space of an evoked text to an integrationnetwork where it is blended with the alluding text in a reading andunderstanding of the latter.143Another issue that concerns the interpretation of both metaphors andallusions is the question of “how far the meaning of a text goes,” toquote Leo Noordman.144“How minimalistic or maximalistic does oneconceive the linguistic meaning to be; how much inferences are partof the meaning of a text ...?”145How do we evaluate the existenceand relevance of allusions, and the extent to which we should utilisethe intertext in our interpretation of the alluding text?

Although there was no agreement on the exact delineationof the corpus of texts to be regarded as authoritative, more often thannot controversy revolved around different meanings produced by differ-ent readers reading the same texts. Manlio Simonetti argues that “thestudy of Holy Scripture was the real foundation of Christian culture inthe Church of the earliest centuries.”147However, Scripture is, as Simon-143SeeBen-Porat,“PoeticsofLiteraryAllusion,”–.SeealsoCarmelaPerri,“OnAlluding,”Poetics (): , .144Leo Noordman, “Some Reflections on the Relation Between Cognitive LinguisticsandExegesis,”inJob:CognitioninContext(ed.EllenvanWolde;BiblicalInterpretation; Leiden: Brill, ), .145Noordman, “Some Reflections,” .146Oatley, “Writingandreading,” .147Manlio Simonetti,Biblical Interpretation in the Early Church: An Historical Intro-duction to Patristic Exegesis(trans.JohnA.Hughes;ed.AndersBergquistandMarkusBockmuehl; Edinburgh: T&T Clark, ), ."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesettipointsout,“acomplexofwritingsdiverseinsubjectmatter,form,anddate,andsometimesinaccessibleforvariousreasons,sothattheeffectiveknowledge and use of them by Christians was not obvious, but requireda notably complex effort of interpretation.”148In these interpretive processes the function of the concept of canonwas crucial. I here understand canon, with George Aichele, as “a col-lection or list of authoritative writings, as accepted by some group ofreaders.”149A canon,Aichele argues, “arises from the need to control theunderstanding of written texts,” Scripture being an especially pertinentexample.150Once established, a canon tends to obscure the individualcanonical texts’ aspects of incoherenceand open-endedness, thus mutu-allystrengtheningtheirapparentcompleteness.151AccordingtoLeeMar-tin McDonald, an important feature of writings that were regarded asauthoritative Scriptureinearly Christianitywasthatthey were“believedto beinternally self-consistentand not self-contradictory,”152apointthatis illustrated well by Justin Martyr, stating in his debate with Trypho theJew that if someone showed him a Scripture that seemed to contradictanother,since I am entirelyconvinced that noscripture contradicts another, I shalladmit rather that I do not understand what is recorded, and shall striveto persuade those who imagine that the scriptures are contradictory to berather of the same opinion as myself.(Justin,Dial. ,ANF:)This passage says a great deal about the presuppositions guiding Justin’sinterpretation of Scripture. In Justin’s mind, Scripture, by its very nature,148Simonetti,Biblical Interpretation,.149George Aichele,Sign, Text, Scripture: Semiotics and the Bible(Interventions ;Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, ), .

What consequences does such a view ofScripture have for the exegesis of Scriptural texts?If it is held that no canonical text contradicts another, then it followsthat each constituent text in the canon can legitimately be drawn uponin the reading of any of the others, to fill in gaps and to resolve apparentcontradictions.Thecanonisationofagroupoftextsthusnotonlydefinesa corpus of authoritative texts, but in so doing also delineates a group oflegitimateintertextsthataresanctionedtomutuallyreinforceeachotherand through which any of its constituent texts are supposed to be under-stood.153Since the canonised texts are believed to contain basically thesame message, readers are consequently encouraged to play the canon-ical texts against each other, and in this way canon limits interpretivecreativityandstimulatesitatthesametime.154However, consideringthegreatdiversityofscope,style,andcontent,evenamongthetextsthatwereaccepted as authoritative by a majority of early Christian communities,each individual text could not carryequal weight.

All that is required is an at least implicit understanding within agiven interpretive community of a group of texts being individually andcollectively authoritative.It should thus be evident that we may describe the functions of theconcept of a canon in processes of interpretation in terms of how itinfluencesthemechanicsofintertextualblending.Agoodexampleofthisis constituted by how very different narratives of the nativity of Christin Matthew and Luke have been commonly interpreted in Christiantradition. As Raymond Brown has remarked, “commentators of timespasthaveharmonizedthesedifferentdetailsintoaconsecutivenarrative,sothattheordinaryChristianisoftennotevenawareofadifficultywhenLucan shepherds and Matthean magi fraternize in the Christmas cribscene.”157Since both accounts are part of the biblical canon, and thusshare the generic property of canonicity, they are regarded by defaultas equally true, and there is consequently a certain pressure upon thereadertoharmoniseorintegratethetwoaccountswitheachother.Ratherthaninterpretingthedifferencesbetweenthemascontradictions,thetwostoriesareunderstoodtogether,beingblendedinreaders’minds,andtheresultingblendeventuallybecomesentrenchedinthecollectivememoryof the community.158The description of the basic mechanics of this intertextual blend isvalid with regard to the analysis of any interpretation within a canonicalframework, where elements of two or more texts are brought togetherand blended in the act of interpretation.

One might say that the canonical texts will be predisposed forpriming and subsequent activation in any reading of a canonical text,sinceanytwocanonicaltextswillsharethisgenericcategorystructure.159The fact that the elements and structure that make up the canonbecome closely linked in experience, and thus in people’s memory, facil-itates the priming and activation of related elements of the canon onceone has been activated. References to the nativity story in Matthew, forexample, thus give easy mental access to the one in Luke. The Christiancanon of Scripture is without doubt a graded and in many ways radialconcept (albeit with complex internal links and structures). As we haveseen, not all of its constituent texts are of equal importance, and sometexts are more closely linked than others. The level of priming and acti-vation displays certain prototype effects.

Asmentioned above, no interpretation will ever be stable, however, as newinput spaces may always be introduced and the cross-space projectionsaltered,with oftenless thanpredictable results. Theprocess isinherentlydynamic and, in a broad sense, context dependent.159As mentioned above, canonicity is an important component of the generic spacein such an integration network, and this feature of the generic space facilitates therecruitment offurthertextshavingthesamegenericstructure,i.e.,othercanonical texts,as input spaces in the network."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"theoretical and methodological issuesAichele argues that a “community’s desire for a canon is desire for atext that conveys truly an essential, authoritative message and that con-trols the interpretation of that message.”160This, however, is a desire thatwill never be satisfied. No matter how firm the canonical delineation ofauthoritative texts becomes, interpretation will never be guided solelyby the texts on the inside of the canon, or solely by the canon as meta-text, for it is clear that the canonical texts can be interpreted in a widevariety of ways by people who share the same, or broadly the same,canon. Thus, in order to control the interpretation of Scripture, addi-tionalmeasuresareneeded,anditisevidentthatChristiancommunitiesfelt the need from a very early stage, long before the eventual closureof the canon, to establish certain extra-canonical checks and balancesin order to safeguard acceptable interpretation. Doctrinal statements ofvarying complexity were accordingly codified in increasingly importantcreedsandrulesoffaith.161In terms of Blending Theory, such doctri-nal checks and balances may be conceived of as additional interpretiveframes that exclude certain readings and facilitate others, but, impor-tantly, they may also be regarded as authoritative input spaces in theirownright,thatincreasinglyprojectedmajorelementsoftheirowntotheinterpretive blends arising from the reading of Scriptural texts. Thus wealso see how rules of faith or creeds cannot any more than the canon, oritsindividualconstituenttexts,interpretthemselves,thatis,controltheirown interpretation, since interpretation will always be a dynamic prac-ticeperformedbyhumanbeingsinparticularcontexts.Andaccordinglywe mayobservethat the creedsthemselves increasinglybecamesubjectsof commentary and interpretation.162Viewed as new authoritative inputspaces,then,itbecomesclearthattheestablishmentofsuchauthoritativedoctrinal formulations can only limit interpretation to a certain extent.Interpreters will be able to interpret Scripture in an infinite variety ofways, even while being in accordance with authoritative credal formula-tions.160Aichele,The Control of Biblical Meaning,.161ForthehistoryofearlyChristiancreeds,seeJ.N.D.Kelly,EarlyChristianCreeds(rded.; London: Longman, ).162See, e.g., J.N.D.

As Stanley Fish haspointed out, “while there are always mechanisms for ruling out read-ings, their source is not the text but the presently recognized interpre-tive strategies for producing the text.”163Fish’s focus on the function ofinterpretive communities as the locus of a text’s meaning thus providesuswithanimportantcorrectivetoafocusontheindividualautonomousreader, and a promising point of departure for further inquiries intothe social constraints upon interpretation, the function of institutionalpower structures, and the impact of struggles between various interpre-tive communities over the acceptable range of scriptural interpretationin early Christianity. As Fish has argued, “the fact of agreement, ratherthan being a proof of the stability of objects, is a testimony to the powerof an interpretive community to constitute the objects upon which itsmembers ... canthenagree.”164From this it follows, argues Fish, that“disagreements are not settled by the facts, but are the means by whichthefactsaresettled.Ofcourse,nosuchsettlingisfinal,andinthe(almostcertain) event that the dispute is opened again, the category of the facts‘as they really are’ will be reconstituted in still another shape.”165Early Christian interpreters of Scripture were no exceptions to thisrule.Theunderstandingoftextswereshapedbytheneedsandconstraintsof the individual interpreter’s social context. So, although there weremechanisms for ruling out readings, such as canons, creeds, and rulesof faith, discussed above, these mechanisms were not grounded in thetexts themselves, butin “the presently recognizedinterpretive strategies”for producing them.166As Bart Ehrman formulates it, following Fish,to be sure, few readers realize that they aregeneratingmeanings from atext, that is, that they are employing culturally conditioned interpretivestrategies to make sense of the words on a page.

Although the human body may be said to be basically universalin its constitution across cultures, this, of course, does not mean thatthewaythebodyanditsprocessesareinterpreted,orthewayitisused,are universal.171While “it is our embodied interaction with the world167Bart D.

Kasser is right to point out this important sense of the Greek term\u0002\u0003\u0004γησιςand its appropriateness in this context, but I think the sense of\u0002\u0003\u0004γησιςasexegesis, i.e., as an expository interpretation, is an equally apt one in the title of thistractate and I have therefore opted to translate it accordingly, while acknowledgingthat the denotation of “story” may also be in play here since the exposition is partlywrittenintheformofanarrative.Theuseofthetermⲉⲝⲏⲅⲏⲥⲓⲥin Coptic to denote anexpository text is, e.g., attested by Shenoute who refers to his discursive anti-hereticalwork known asIAmAmazedby the termⲉⲝⲏⲅⲏⲥⲓⲥ(Shenoute,IAmAmazed, DS ;Stephen Emmel, “Theophilus’s Festal Letter of  as Quoted by Shenoute,” inDivitiaeAegypti: Koptologische und verwandte Studien zu Ehren von Martin Krause[ed.

The title used in Laytonand Robinson’s edition ofExeg.Soul,“TheExpositoryTreatiseontheSoul,”isthusanaptone(seeBentleyLayton,ed.,WilliamC.Robinson,Jr.,trans.,“TheExpositoryTreatiseonthe Soul,” inOn the Origin of the World, Expository Treatise on the Soul, Book of Thomasthe Contender[ed.

Now, upon hearing the soul’s repenting cries for help andpleas for forgiveness, the Father takes pity on her and provides her withsalvation in the form of a husband.Exeg. Soulinforms us early on thatthe soul’s original existence was “male-female,” and we later learn thatthe union between the soul and her saviour-husband re-establishes thisoriginal pair and leads to the soul’s ascent back into heaven.

It is especially the text’s intricate and often implicitpromptingofconceptualandintertextualblendsthatcreatesinterpretiveproblems. The tractate contains interpretive twists and turns that mayindeed baffle the modern reader, often making it difficult to discern theprinciples at work in its scriptural exegesis. It should be noted at theoutset, however, thatExeg. Soulis not merely concerned with exegetingthe explicitly quoted scriptural passages, but also ones that are onlyalludedto,andnotonlywrittensources,butritualpracticeaswell.Inthepresent chapter I will delve into the poetics ofExeg.

Joseph Jensen, “DoesPorneia Mean Fornication? A Critique of Bruce Malina,”NovT: []: –).I have translated the term throughout as prostitution, but it should be noted that sincethe underlying term isπ\u0012ρνε\u0014αit also carries the aforementioned connotations and notsimplywhatwewouldstrictlyregard asprostitution. It shouldalso benoted that thewayπ\u0012ρνε\u0014αis used inExeg.

Soul, we will see that the scope of the source and therange of the target in metaphorical relations are exploited rhetoricallyin diverse and interesting ways. In what follows we will take a closerlook at some of the most important metaphorical blends that functionthroughout this tractate and how they interrelate with each other andwith the tractate’s many scriptural quotations and allusions. In otherwords, we will be looking at the way in which the tractate prompts forthe construction of metaphorical and intertextual blends and how theyinteract.. Textual and Redactional IssuesDespite its unique features, scholars have shown only moderate interestinExeg. Soul. Apart from Maddalena Scopello’s study, the critical edi-tions by Jean-Marie Sevrin and Cornelia Kulawik are the only book-length treatments of it.9The main focus so far has been a philologi-cal one, and there have appeared several critical editions of the Cop-tic text with accompanying translations and commentary. In additionto Sevrin’s French and Kulawik’s German critical editions there is alsothe important English edition by Bentley Layton, with introduction andtranslation by William C. Robinson, Jr., as well as the early German edi-tion by Martin Krause.10In addition, several important articles dealing8Gibbs, “Prototypes,” .9Sevrin,L’Exégèse de l’âme;CorneliaKulawik,Die Erzählung über die Seele (Nag-Hammadi-Codex II,): Neu herausgegeben, übersetzt und erklärt(TUGAL ; Berlin:Walter de Gruyter, ); Maddalena Scopello,L’Exégèsedel’âme:NagHammadiCodexII,: Introduction, traduction et commentaire(NHS ; Leiden: Brill, ).10Layton and Robinson, “Expository Treatise”; Martin Krause and Pahor Labib, eds.,Gnostische und hermetische Schriften aus Codex II und Codex VI(Abhandlungen desDeutschenArchäologischenInstitutsKairo,KoptischeReihe;Glückstadt:J.J.Augustin,), –.

But how do they function in the text’s overall rhetoric? Theexegetical method ofExeg. Soulwas described in  as “proof-textmethod” by Wilson, who did not hold it in high regard:From the point of view of the modern scholar, the document revealsthe weaknesses of the proof-text method, and of allegory. The quotationsare simply lifted out of context, without regard for their original settingor their original meaning. For us of course this involves an exegeticalmisdemeanour, but our principles and methods are different.12As will be shown in what follows, however, this is hardly an adequatedescription of the way in which Scripture is used in this tractate.13ThescripturalreferencesinExeg.Soulrangefromdirectquotationsandpara-phrases to allusions.

Soulunique among the Nag Hammadi textsis its extensive use of direct scriptural quotations.14The tractate quotesdirectly from Jeremiah, Hosea, Ezekiel, Psalms, and First Corinthians,and even identifies these texts with introductory phrases. The quotationofCor:–,forinstance,isintroducedbythephrase,“thereforePaul,writing to the Corinthians, said:” (ⲇⲓⲁ ⲧⲟⲩⲧⲟ ⲡⲁⲩⲗⲟⲥ ⲉϥⲥϩⲁ ̈ⲓ̄ⲛⲅⲕⲟⲣⲓⲑⲓⲟⲥⲡⲉϫⲁϥϫⲉ).15In addition, passages from Ephesians, Genesis, Isaiah, andJohn are also quoted directly, but anonymously.

The highlightingof this particular metaphorical entailment serves a dual purpose. It isused as a description of the soul’s femaleness and thus supplements theetymological argument, but more importantly it also sets the stage forthefurtherrhetoricalexploitationofthisveryaspectofthemetaphoricalblend at a later stage in the narrative.43The ICM woman is a cluster model, which means that it consistsof a cluster of cognitive models.44Throughout the tractate the basicmetaphorical blend the soul is a woman draws on different aspects ofthis source ICM to create a number of lower-level metaphorical blendslike the soul is a prostitute, the soul is a bride, the soul is awife, the soul is a sister, the soul is a mother and the soul is adaughter, as the woman ICM is drawn upon to supply different men-tal framing inputs, at different points in the narrative, corresponding tothese different stereotypical female roles.

The ICMs of virgin and daughterboth supply important metaphorical entailments for the interpretationof the soul’s original state. An important entailment of the latter is thatas a daughter, it is proper for the soul to be obedient to her father. Thethe soul is a daughter metaphor thus serves to introduce the themeofhierarchyandpowerrelationsrelativetothesoul,aswellasExeg.Soul’spersistent rhetoric of obedience and submission.It is a major point inExeg. Soulthat as long as the soul obeys herfather, she exists in a pure state of virginity. This equation of obediencewith purity is significant. As soon as the daughter-soul is disobedientand leaves her place, however, she falls into prostitution and loses hervirginity.Thereisnomiddleground.Thesoul’soriginalstateofbeing,asan obedient daughter and virgin, thus serves as an important contrast tothe soul’s subsequent tribulations in the material body. The descriptionof this originalstate becomesallthe more significantbythe factthat thisstate is also that to which the soul should ideally return, since whicheverway we interpret the original state of the soul, it will have profoundimplications for how we view the nature of the soul’s plight in her fallenstate and the nature of her salvation....The Soul as Male-FemaleInitsoriginalstatethesoulisnotonlyadaughterandavirgin,butisalsodescribed as “a male-female”:4646ThemostcommontranslationoftheCoptictermϩⲟⲩⲧⲥϩⲓⲙⲉis“androgyne.”InordertoshowmoreclearlytherhetoricalfunctionoftheterminExeg.Soul,however,Ihavehere"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"chapter threeⲁⲩⲱⲟⲩϩⲟⲩⲧⲥϩⲓⲙⲉⲧⲉϩ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲥⲉⲓⲛⲉ... and she was male-female in her likeness.47(Exeg.

This means thatin order to understand the conceptual blend, we need to consider theimplications of the intertextual blending that is operative here involvingtheaccountofthecreationofmaninGen:–andthatofthecreationof woman in Gen :–.There was a widespread interpretive tradition in antiquity, based onthe peculiar juxtaposition of these two passages in Genesis, which heldthat the “man” (\u001bν\u0019ρωπ\u0012ς) which is described in Gen :– as beingcreated according to the image (κατ’ε\u001eκ\u001fνα) of God, was an andro-gynous, male-female, being.48Not only is the wording in Gen :– ambiguous with regard to grammatical number, but in Gen :–Eve is described as being created from Adam, thus indicating to severalexegetes that Eve had to have been originally containedwithin the origi-nal“man”(\u001bν\u0019ρωπ\u0012ς)referredtoin:–.Fromthisperspective,thefirstcreationwasthatofamale-femaleentity,anAdamthatalsoincludedEve. This interpretation is supported by the Alexandrian text of the Sep-tuagint which at Gen :, after having referred to Adam as the man cre-ated “according to the image” (κατ’ε\u001eκ\u001fνα)at:,statesthatGodmadethemmaleandfemaleandthathecalledtheirname,ratherthanhisname,Adam (κα\r \u0002πων\u001fμασεν τ !ν\u0012μα α\"τ#ν Αδαμ).chosen to translate it, as literally as possible, as “male-female.” Although “androgyne” istheliteralrenderingof“male-female”inGreek,itcarriesconnotationsinitsEnglishusagethatmaybedifferentfromthosethatarehighlightedintherhetoricofExeg.Soul.Anotherpossible translation, “hermaphrodite,” carries the same sort of problems as “androgyne.”47Robinson’s translation ofⲉⲓⲛⲉas “form,” in “she was virgin and in form androgy-nous,” (Layton and Robinson, “Expository Treatise,” ) is too restrictive and obscuresthe intertextual connection to Genesis, where the wordⲉⲓⲛⲉ, translating the Greek%μ\u0012\u0014-ωσις,iscrucial.48See, e.g., James L.

Soul.–, at a point where Genesis  has alreadybeen quoted and alluded to several times, and thus very likely to beprimed in the reader’s mind, it is readily evoked.50As we can see, thereare counterpart relations between the descriptions of the original stateof the soul and the original\u001bν\u0019ρωπ\u0012ςof Genesis , with vital identityrelations between Adam in the Genesis input and the male part of thesoul’s male-female pair in theExeg.

See below for discussion.50On subsequent readings of the tractate this is of course even more the case.51Cf. Elaine H.

Onthese grounds, the rendering “lost” seems more correct, retaining theculpability of the soul while keeping her husband and Saviour suitablyspotless.52ThisisalsomoreinlinewithExeg. Soul’s commentary onits quotations of theOdysseytowards the end of the tractate, where itrefers to the soul leaving (ⲕⲱ̄ⲛⲥⲁ)hertruehusband.53The separationof the soul from her partner also recalls the splitting of the original\u001bν\u0019ρωπ\u0012ς, which in Genesis happens with the creation of woman inGen:–.Exeg.Soulevokesboththataccountandthefallfromgraceand banishment from paradise in Gen , which produces an interestinginterpretive blend, where the separation of the soul from her partner isequatedwiththeaccountofthecreationofwomaninGen:–,whilethe fall of the soul from heaven is equated with the fall from grace inGen . There is here a common generic space for the three inputs as wellas one for inputs  and , and for  and  respectively. Note also that52This is also the solution chosen by Kulawik, who translates “bevor die Frau denMann verlor” (Kulawik,Die Erzählung, ). The translation “led astray,” which is theone chosen by Robinson (see Layton and Robinson, “Expository Treatise,” ), maybe supported by seeing here an allusion to Eve making Adam eat the forbidden fruit(cf. Rose Horman Arthur,The Wisdom Goddess: Feminine Motifs in Eight Nag HammadiDocuments[Lanham: University Press of America, ], ), but such an allusion doesnot fit well within the overall rhetoric ofExeg.

Soulquoted above, but, as we shall see, the latter interpretationseems the most probable in light of the overall rhetoric of the text.It is clear that the motif of the ideal male-female pair is rhetoricallyhighly important inExeg. Souland represents the ideal paradisal stateand salvation’s ultimate goal, as well as the means of bringing it about.It is consequently also the ideal with which the undesirable conductand fallen states of the soul are contrasted. A literal rendering of thetermϩⲟⲩⲧⲥϩⲓⲙⲉmakes clear the important contrast between the soul’soriginal existence in a male-female pair, and her subsequent existenceas a lone female (ⲥϩⲓⲙⲉ) without her male partner, her true husband,in her fallen state.

Soul.–)Both aspects are important for the further development of the narra-tive and for the soteriological points that are made. First, her many falsehusbands at this stage of the narrative stand in direct opposition to theone who is later referred to as “her perfect husband” (ⲡⲉⲥϩⲁ ̈ⲓ̄ⲛⲧⲉⲗⲉⲓⲟⲥ)59and “the true bridegroom” (ⲡⲣ̄ⲙϣⲉⲗⲉⲉⲧ̄ⲙⲙⲉ).60Secondly, the victimisa-tion of the soul at the hands of “robbers” (ⲗⲏⲥⲧⲏⲥ)and“wantonmen”(ϩⲩⲃⲣⲓⲥⲧⲏⲥ) shows her vulnerability apart from the safety provided byher father and her brother/husband. The description of the “robbers”and “wanton men” as pretending to be trustworthy true husbands is sig-nificant, and it is worth noting that the soul serves them as if they wereher masters. The terms “husband” (ϩⲁⲉⲓ)and“master”(ϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ) are hereintimately linked and thus strengthen the aspect of power and submis-sion inherent in the marriage ICM, which, as we shall see, is madeeven more explicit whenExeg. Soullater alludes to Gen :/Cor :;:/Eph : stating that “the master of the woman is her husband”(ⲡϫⲟⲉⲓⲥⲅⲁⲣ̄ⲛⲧⲉⲥϩⲓⲙⲉⲡⲉⲡⲉⲥϩⲁ ̈ⲓ).61Whiletheadulterersare“masters”—albeit not rightfully so—the soul, for her part, is correspondingly a “ser-vant” or “slave” (ϩⲙ̄ϩ̄̄ⲁ̄ⲗ).

Robinson’s description of the earthly state of the soul as being“characterized by sexual identity (female or male)”62underestimates thesignificance of this fact, making the actual gender of the soul irrelevant.However, the soul’s specifically female identity is in fact essential to theoverall rhetoric ofExeg.Soul,sincethisistheonlygenderingthatfitsthenarrative, and since the metaphorical entailments of describing the soulasmalewouldbequitedifferent,andcertainlynotcompatiblewithExeg.Soul’s narrative and general rhetorical structure.63So,whataretheentailmentsofdescribingthesoulintermsofthecon-ceptual metaphor the soul is a woman, and how does this metaphorfunction within the overall rhetoric ofExeg.

Interpreted withinthe contextual framework of the real world knowledge of the ICM ofwashing, more specifically the knowledge that in the washing of gar-ments, the garments are often turned inside out, the implication is thatthe baptism of the soul involves the washing of the, now mentally fused,womb/garment in water, an action which thenipso factoinvolves theturning of the womb/garment inside-out.108We thus see how the basicmetaphorbaptismiswashing,whenitalsoinvolvesthetwometaphorsthesoulisagarmentandthesoulisawoman,canproduce,byelaborationintheprocessofblending,suchcreativeimageryastheturn-ing inside-out of the womb of the soul in baptism.109This is facilitatedby the exploitation of certain potential entailments of one of the basicmetaphors underlyingExeg.

Fauconnier and Turner,The Way We Think, –.108Cf. Wisse, “On Exegeting,” .109Robinson admits that hedoes “not understand this figure of speech, of itself and inthe present context.” According to Robinson, “the chief difficulty is that at this point inExSoul one expects the sexual individuality to be nullified by restoration of the originalandrogynous union” (Robinson, “Exegesis on the Soul,” ).

While it ison the outside, the womb of the soul ispolluted, receives bad seed, and bears children that are weak and stupid.Only after she is cleansed and her womb is turned toward the inside canthe soul receive good seed and produce good children.

Thus, the outside-insidedichotomy also plays an important part in the imagery of turning thatis of such great significance in the tractate’s rhetoric of conversion andredemption.Exeg. Soul’s account of baptism follows its description of the soul’slife of sin and precedes her marriage with the Saviour. There is a log-ical transition in the text from the soul’s life of sin, via her baptismalpurification, to her wedding, as baptism effects the necessary transi-tion from the defilements of the soul in her former life to her new lifewith the Saviour.

The former aredescribed as uncaring and even violent, while the latter is described asa wise and loving husband. Correspondingly, while the soul is driven bypassionsandlustwiththeadulterers,sheisdrivenbyloveandrepentancetogether with the Saviour.

The imagery of turn-ing is indeed pervasive throughoutExeg. Soul.151As we have seen, thewomb of the soul is turned, the soul turns her face, first from her orig-inal husband and then from successive fornicators, while the latter turnaway fromher afterhaving had their way with her. In contrastto the souland the adulterers, and in contrast to “the fleshly marriage,” the soul andher true husband, Christ, do not turn away from each other once theyhave been (re)united.152Rather than tiring of each other like those whoare united in “the fleshly marriage,” the soul and Christ truly become “asinglelife.”Incontrast,Robinson’sinterpretationreversesthemeaningofthe passage and hence does not fit the argumentExeg. Soulseems to bemaking here. Why would the soul and Christ turn their faces from eachother?Granted,inthiscommunionthesoulrenouncesdesire,butitdoesnot seem appropriate for her to renounce the metaphorical intercoursewith her true husband or desire for him. What the soul renounces is herdesire to seek new lovers, since she is now fully satisfied with her com-munion with Christ, her true husband. Instead it is the common humancouple who will eventually have enough of the desire for fleshly com-munion with each other, and who will therefore turn away from eachother.The contrast between the soul’s original and fallen states is thus notonebetweenanoriginalstateofasexualityandafallenstatecharacterisedby sexuality, but rather a contrast between the idealγ;μ\u0012ςandπ\u0012ρνε\u0014α,i.e., between a state of legitimate marital relationship versus illicit andfleeting relationships with a multitude of partners, relationships thatare characterised by the text as prostitution, fornication, and adultery.Exeg.

The fact that this process is also subsequently describedas an ascent to heaven,175again tightens the intertextual links to the Ps LXX and Matt : intertexts.In summary, we find that the way in which rebirth and ascent arementioned inExeg. Soul.– serves to call up intertextual inputspaces from Titus, First Timothy, Matthew, and the Psalms, leading to arich polysemic integration network of intertextual mental spaces, someof which have already been primed by previous references, and some,most notably those from Titus and First Timothy, that are called up forthe first time—and in parallel (see fig. ).But let us now return to the passage under scrutiny to consider thestatementthatthesoulwillnotbesavedthough̄ⲛϣⲁϫⲉ̄ⲛⲁⲥⲕⲏⲥⲓⲥ(“prac-tised words”),̄ⲛⲧⲉⲭⲛⲏ(“skills”), orⲥⲃⲱ̄ⲛⲥϩⲁ ̈ⲓ(“written teaching”).

Frederik Wisse speculates that they“perhaps mean that salvation does not come through ascetic practices,(cultic) acts or (the belief in) written doctrines,”176but, as Wisse rightlynotes, “the sentence does not seem to say this.”177So what does it say?In contrast to these three terms,Exeg. Soulspecifies that salvation is tobe regarded as a grace (\u0010;ρις)andagift(δωρε;).178The gist of the pas-sage thus seems to be the message that the soul cannot save herself, butneeds help,179a point that is also brought home through the descriptionofthesoulbeingunabletogivebirthonherown,withouttheseedthatisprovidedbyChrist.Thisdoesnotnecessarilymean,however,that̄ⲛϣⲁϫⲉ̄ⲛⲁⲥⲕⲏⲥⲓⲥ,̄ⲛⲧⲉⲭⲛⲏ,orⲥⲃⲱ̄ⲛⲥϩⲁ ̈ⲓworkcountertosalvation,norindeedthattheyareunimportant.180Itmaysimplymeanthatonemustacknowledgethat salvation is unattainable without the help of God, the Father.

Soul., the soul is metaphorically a woman, and, as we haveseen, this metaphor is expanded using related metaphors like the soulis a prostitute, the soul is a bride, and the soul is a wife. Weencounter intertextual triggers at various points throughout the narra-tive that enable the activation of different external texts as input spacesfor various blends that are employed in the narrative of the soul’s fallandredemption.Differentintertexts,whichhighlightdifferentaspectsofthe various metaphorical representations of the soul, are thus activated.Some of these intertexts, like for instance Hosea and First Corinthi-ans, are activated by way of explicit citations, while others are activatedimplicitly through allusions. When they are primed and activated asinput spaces, or sources for input spaces, these intertexts contribute toestablishing, as well as highlighting, different aspects of what may beregarded as the main conceptual metaphor inExeg. Soul,namelythesoulisawoman.Hosea,Jeremiah,andEzekiel,forinstance,fleshoutthe the soul is a prostitute metaphor,185while inputs from, e.g.,Ephesians, Matthew, and the Song of Songs, help set up metaphoricalblends around the conceptual metaphor the soul is a bride. Interest-ingly,whileExeg.SouluseslengthyquotationsfromJeremiah,Hosea,andEzekielinitsdescriptionsofthesoul’sformerlifeofprostitution,fornica-tion,andadultery,thefocusshiftsnoticeablytoNewTestamentallusionswith regard to the soul’s salvation through marriage.We have seen that the conceptual metaphor the soul is a womanis employed throughout the narrative, and that this is a single-scopenetworkthatisconducivetometaphoricalinterpretation.Butatthesametime as the soul is metaphorically a woman, we may also to some extentunderstanditasapartforwholemetonymywiththesoulreferringtothe whole person. Moreover, the womb of the soul also has an important183Eph :.184Eph :.185SeeExeg.

First of all, the womb may in somerespects, especially in connection with the turning of the womb fromthe outside to the inside, be seen to stand metonymically for the wholemetaphorical woman, and thus, inter alia, for the entire soul, in whichcase the turning of the womb can also be understood metonymically torefer to the conversion of the whole person (for these metaphorical andmetonymical relations, see fig. ).Now, inExeg. Soulthe soul is metaphorically a woman. But does thismean that the tractate is only concerned with the souls of women?186This does not seem to be the case. The overall rhetoric of the tractateseemsrathertoimplythatthesoulismetaphoricallyfemaleregardlessofthe gender of the body it inhabits.187In this conceptual the soul forthe person metonymy, however, the person is not just anybody, butwould represent, again metonymically, by a member of category forcategory metonymy, the prototypical Christian convert, and we maythusspeakofthemetonymythesoulforthechristian.Thesoulmaythereforeberegardedatvariouspointsinthetractateasbothametaphorand a metonymy for the Christian (see fig. ).186By interpreting the imagery of the soul as a woman literally rather than metaphor-ically, Scopello has usedExeg. Soulas evidence for “the historical and social reality ofwomen in the gnostic communities” (Scopello, “Jewish and Greek Heroines,” –).Scopello even thinks the author ofExeg. Soulwas probably a woman, since in Scopello’sview “the sexual accounts of a text such as theExegesis on the Soulare more probablyascribed to a woman than to a man” (ibid., ). Birger Pearson shares the view that “afemaleauthorcouldeasilybeposited”(Pearson,“MikrainGnosticLiterature,”n.).Julia Iwersen argues thatExeg. Soulis likely the product of a female proselyte (see JuliaIwersen,“MetanoiaundBrautgemach:DerfrühgnostischeSeelenmythosalsKonversion-smythos,” inReligionswissenschaft in Konsequenz: Beiträge im Anschluß an Impulse vonKurt Rudolph[ed. Rainer Flasche, et al.; Marburger Religionsgeschichtliche Beiträge ;Münster: Lit, ], esp. ). For the view thatExeg. Souldoes not address the ques-tion of real women, see Perkins,Gnosticism and the New Testament, . See also thecomments of Douglas M. Parrott, “Response to ‘Jewish and Greek Heroines in the NagHammadi Library’ by Madeleine Scopello,” inImages of the Feminine in Gnosticism(ed.KarenL.King;SAC;Philadelphia:FortressPress,),–;Arthur,WisdomGoddess,; Kulawik,Die Erzählung,.187This has been pointed out by, among others, Perkins,Gnosticism and the NewTestament, ; Deirdre J.

The individual Christian soul hasto become as a virgin bride in relation to Christ in order to submit tohimasaproper Christianinametaphorical marriage whichalsoconsti-tutes a return to the primordial state of male-female union in paradisebefore the fall. In summary, the ideal marriage of the soul with Christdescribed inExeg. Soulhas the precondition that the female part of theunion acts like an ideal female, whichinter aliainvolves an abandon-ment of any resemblance of maleness on her part, a maleness which isdescribedvividlyintermsofthesoulactivelyseekingdifferentloversandhavingherwombontheoutsidelikemalegenitalia.Sheneedstobecomea proper, pure, female virgin, with her womb on the inside like it shouldbe, and subsequently submit herself to Christ the Saviour, her true hus-band and master. In this union, the male and female parts are obviouslynot equal. The soul of the individual Christian, constituting the femalepart of the unity, is clearly supposed to be subordinated to Christ, themale part,188and we may speak of a relation of hierarchical complemen-tarity.Rose Horman Arthur has claimed thatExeg. Soul“treats most of thefeminine elements pejoratively.”189Butisthisreallythecase?Onemightfor instance observe that in this text it is wrong for the soul to have bothmale and female characteristics at the same time, as is the case in herfallen state, and becoming completely male is not an option. What isproper for the soul is to be fully female. The crucial point, however, isthat in her femaleness she needs a man in order to bring about a returnto the original male-female state, and not just any man, but Christ hertrue bridegroom and perfect husband.The effectiveness of this symbolism stems from the tractate’s openingpremise that the soul is female, combined with a cultural understandingof the role of the wife in relation to her husband in marriage that is alsostrengthened by scriptural intertexts, as we have seen above. Therefore,188Cf.Michael AllenWilliams,“Variety in GnosticPerspectives on Gender,”inImagesoftheFeminineinGnosticism(ed.KarenL.King;SAC;Philadelphia:FortressPress,),.189Arthur,Wisdom Goddess, ."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"the feminisation of the soulwhenthesoulisturnedintoaproper woman,itisquite“natural”forhertoreceiveherproperhusbandandsubmitherselftohisrule.190ThisdoesnotmeanthatExeg.Souldisparagesfeminineelementsorcharacteristics.On the contrary, femininity is what the readers are to strive for, albeita femininity of the soul in relation to Christ. For it is the relationalaspects between the Christian and Christ that are highlighted by themetaphorical femininity and marriage, as common and basic ICMs areused to conceptualise the abstract qualities and demands of life as aChristian.By framing its discourse on Christian life with an allegorical narrativeof the fall and redemption of the soul portrayed as a woman,Exeg.

Who may have produced and used it, when, and for whatpurpose(s)? What way of life is advocated, and what can be made of itssacramental references?190Cf. Williams, “Variety,” .191As Wisse has pointed out, “similar ‘myths’ about the fall and return to heaven ofthe soul were current in theancient world” (Wisse, “On Exegeting,” ). For the Platonicnotion of the fall of the soul, see, e.g., John Dillon, “The Descent of the Soul in MiddlePlatonic and Gnostic Theory,” inThe School of Valentinus(ed.

Soulmeaning isproduced in the interrelations between mental input spaces, that maybe regarded as both conceptual and intertextual. A rhetoric that lets thereaders or audience reach the most important insights on their own, inlight of shared cognitive models and texts which are already establishedas authoritative, serves at least two important purposes.

The receptionof “the divinity” (ⲡⲑⲉⲓⲟⲛ) from the Father should probably be seen inconnectionwith the reception of “the seed” (ⲡⲉⲥⲡⲉⲣⲙⲁ) referred to a fewlines previously.206However, it is impossible to know from this whetherthis passage should be understood as a direct reference to the effects ofbaptism, anointing, or other ritual actions, or whether it simply refersin a more general sense to the salvation brought about by the renewalof the soul with the Father’s help. All we can say is that there is anunverifiable possibility that the references to resurrection, ransom, andascent may be inspired by an understanding of baptism in those terms,even thoughExeg.Soulseems to understand baptism primarily in termsof the conceptual domains of renewal and procreation.205I therefore disagree with Wisse who thinks that the account of the soul’s baptismis just an allegory which has nothing to do with actual baptism (Wisse, “On Exegeting,”), and Segelberg who similarly thinks that the purification and baptism of the soul is“a purely mental-spiritual process” (Segelberg, “Prayer Among the Gnostics,” ).

Whether this statement is to be under-stood as an advocacy of silent prayer to the exclusion of external prayer,or simply as a statement of the absolute necessity that the prayer is sin-cere, is impossible to say.

The basis for Martin Krause’s proposal for a late date in his article “Die Sakramente in der ‘Exegese über die Seele’,”236for in-stance, was the then commonly held scholarly assumption that “theGnostics”thoughtthemselvestobesavedbynatureor“gnosis”alone,andtherefore had no need for sacraments. The fact that there are numerousreferences to ritual inExeg. Soultherefore did not really square withKrause’s ideal picture of “Gnosticism,” so to account for this anomaly hedrewtheconclusionthatthepresenceofsuchreferenceshadtobeduetoinfluence from the mystery religions or from Christianity. “Gnosticism”was of course regarded as something altogether different from bothof these categories, and especially from the latter.237In order to allowtime for such external influence, Krause consequently assumed that thetractate had to be among the later “Gnostic” texts.238And, based on theassumption of “Gnostic” borrowing from Christianity, he accordinglycharacterised the author ofExeg. Soulas a “Christian Gnostic.”239To besure, Krause indeed emphasised the Christian character ofExeg. Soul,andevenregardedthetext’sChristianfeaturesasmoreprominentthanits“Gnostic” ones,240but he nevertheless concluded that the text dependedcrucially upon “gnostischen Lehrsätzen.”241Similar lines of reasoning have, however, also led to quite differentconclusions. Indeed, it may be observed that it is largely the individualscholar’s view of “Gnosticism” that has determined whether the text hasbeen seen as an example of “Gnosticism” influenced by Christianity,242236Krause, “Die Sakramente.”237Certainly, in much of what has been written aboutExeg. Soul, and indeed on thesubjectoftheNagHammadilibraryingeneral,Christianity,Judaism,andPaganismhavebeen regarded as separate and well-defined entities. As for “Gnosticism,” while havingbeen assumed to be fundamentally different from either, it has also been regarded asbeing fundamentally characterised by pervasive and syncretistic borrowing from any orall of them (cf., e.g., Scopello, “Exegesis on the Soul,” –).238Krause, “Die Sakramente,” . Krause is not alone in arguing for a late date on suchgrounds. On a similar note, Birger Pearson sees the text’s “eclecticism” as indicating thatthe text is “clearly a ‘late’ product of Christian Gnosticism” (Pearson, “Mikra in GnosticLiterature,” ).239Krause, “Die Sakramente,” .240Krause, “Die Sakramente,” .241Krause, “Die Sakramente,” .242See, e.g., Krause, “DieSakramente”; Martin Krause, “The Christianization of Gnos-ticTexts,”inThe New Testament and Gnosis: Essays in Honour of Robert McL.

On suchgrounds,Sevrin, forexample, placesExeg.Soulin Alexandria and dates it between  (due to the use of the gospel ofJohn) and  (when Valentinus left Alexandria for Rome).245Sevrinalso uses the lack of polemics inExeg. Soulto argue for an early date,and suggests that it was written prior to the Christian heresiologicalreactions.246Scopello also connectsExeg.

Also in Shenoute’s White Monasterythe practice of memorizing and internalizing Scripture was importantenough to be included among the monastic rules. In this regard Bent-ley Layton speaks of “the totalizing character” of Shenoute’s monasticsystem, which, as he puts it, “even extends into the mind and voiceof the monk when he is alone in the cell,” for even when he is alone,the monk is commanded by the rules to do constant handiwork andto meditate “with his brain and his vocal cords.”288Layton speaks of“the constant recitation or mumbling of prayers and passages of Scrip-ture,” and asserts that “there is no silence in this monastery, but ratheraconstantbuzzingsoundlikeaflightofbees,aseveryonecontinuallymumblesprayersandpassagesofScriptureinalowvoice.”289Laytonargues that when the mind is constantly permeated by monasticism inthis way, free thought is replaced by constant meditation on Scriptureand prayer.290Suchcontrolledmemorizationpracticeswouldideallyservetocreateahighly uniform body of Scriptural memory among the monks, and thusof a similar basis for associative thinking.

Phil. to questions concerning themeans, possibility, and, indeed, necessity of a passage or projection froman ontologically lower level of reality to a higher.In the present chapter, I will analyse how much ofGos. Phil.’s rhetoricisstructuredaroundcertainkeyconceptualblends,andIwilldrawsometentativeconclusionswithregardtoitsoveralltheologyandpossibleSitzim Lebenon the basis of this analysis. The main focus will be on how thetext functions on the basis of an interplay between intertwined concep-tual blends, scriptural intertexts, and highly complex intratextual refer-ences.Thecomplexity ofGos.Phil. can hardly be overstated. Confrontedwithitsintricatesystemofsingle-,double-,andmultiple-scopeblending,andaconstantandobliquelystructuredinteractionofcomplexmetaphorsystems, many scholars have given up trying to make sense ofGos. Phil.as a meaningful whole. Instead they have opted to treat it as a compositedocument made up of diverse and more or less unconnectedparts. Oth-ers have tended to base their explanations of the doctrinal contents, ofthe tractate as a whole or its constituent parts, on perceived heresiologi-calparallels,ratherthanonlinksandcueswithinthetextitself.Althoughtrying to understand the text on its own merits, as a complete literarystatement, has even been described as a hazardous enterprise,4IaimtoshowinthischapterthatitispossibletounderstandGos.Phil.onitsownterms, that is, on the basis of an analysis of the conceptual as well as theintra- and intertextual blends it activates, the most relevant intertextualcontext,asinthecaseofExeg.Soul, being that of authoritative Scripture.4SeeA.H.C.vanEijk,“TheGospelofPhilipandClementofAlexandria:GnosticandEcclesiastical Theology on the Resurrection and the Eucharist,”VC (): , andcf. also Layton,The Gnostic Scriptures, ; Martha Lee Turner,The Gospel According toPhilip: The Sources and Coherence of an Early Christian Collection(NHS;Leiden:Brill,), , ."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philip.TextualandRedactionalIssuesGos.

Phil.hasbeenhow to accountforitshighly complex literarystructure.As WesleyIsen-berg has put it,Gos. Phil.’s structure “is neither strictly topical nor pre-dictable.”9As it stands, the tractate interweaves discourses on a seem-inglywiderangeoftopicsconcerningbodily,social,andsacramentalpro-cesses, all done in a rhetorically highly ornamental fashion that reliesuponfrequentuseofmetaphors,similes,paradoxes,wordplays,cita-tions, and allusions. Moreover, in doing this the text has a tendencyto jump back and forth between its key themes in a seemingly unpre-dictable fashion while alternating its use of literary devices.10The factthatGos. Phil., unlikeExeg. Soul,doesnotutiliseanarrativestructuretotieitsvariousdiscoursestogethercertainlydoesnotmakethingseas-ier. At the SBL meeting in  Robert M. Grant famously stated thatbothGos. Thom.andGos. Phil. seemed “to be arranged chaotically, ifone can speak of chaotic arrangement.”11The result of all this is a textTheological Views in the Coptic Gnostic Gospel of Philip” (Ph.D. diss., Princeton Theo-logicalSeminary,);Isenberg,“CopticGospel”;WilliamJosephStroud,“TheProblemofDatingtheChenoboskionGospelofPhilip”(Ph.D.diss.,IliffSchoolofTheology,);Jean-Marie Sevrin, “Pratique et doctrine des sacrements dans l’Évangile selon Philippe”(Ph.D. diss., Université Catholique de Louvain, ); Edward T.

Phil.’s coherence, or lack of it. We may speak here of two typesof coherence, however, textual and doctrinal, and various combinationsof the two. While on one end of the scale some scholars have arguedthatGos. Phil. is both textually and doctrinally incoherent, others haveargued in favour of the coherence of both, with the majority of scholarspositioning themselves somewhere in between these two extremes.14There has been no shortage of proposed explanations for the literarystructure of the text,15ranging from seeing it as a collection of excerptsfrom a variety of different sources, to seeing it as the work of a singleauthor, an author who is supposed to have composed the text as we haveitforreasonsthatmayhavebeenmoreorlessintentionalorwellthought12M.L. Turner,Gospel According to Philip, .13Schenke, “Zur Exegesis,” .14Martha Lee Turner has summarised the situation by pointing out that, “mostinterpretations of theGospel according to Philiphave been based on the tacit assumptionthat a single viewpoint, theology, or set of ritual practices can be recovered from thedocumentbyconsideringallthepassagesitpresentsonagiventhemeortopicofinterest.”Shedividesthosewhohaveusedthisapproachintotwogroups,()thosewhodefendGos.Phil.’s coherence as an original work or as an anthology “shaped by a strong redactor,”and () those who have simply focussed on specific issues in the text without explicitconsideration of its coherence. As for the opposing view she notes that “several of thosewho have focused on the nature of the document, rather than on the meaning of itscontents, have insisted on its composite nature, but this assessment has had little or noimpact on the actual procedures used by those who sought to interpret the document’scontents” (M.L. Turner,Gospel According to Philip, ). Turner herself, who belongs tothe latter group, admits that her argument for the composite nature of thetext is circular(see ibid., ).15For a comprehensive overview of the various explanations of the literary structureofGos.

Phil. as “a lightly edited note-book,”25which can be characterised as “a sourcebook for speculation,”26and “a tinker’s collection of odds and ends, an assortment of texts thatmight come in handy in gnosticbricolage.”27A majority of scholars have indeed found some degree of doctrinalcoherence in spite of the tractate’s seemingly incoherent textual nature.While agreeing with Schenke concerning the textual state of the doc-ument, even asserting that “the textual incoherence ofGos.

Phil.? Grant suggested early on that it seemed like the lackof arrangement inGos. Phil. could be intentional,33and this suggestionwas later taken up by Isenberg, who in his doctoral dissertation arguedthat muchofGos. Phil. consists of parts that have been intentionally dis-joined and distributed to various positions in the text by a compiler-editor.34The individual scholar’s stance with regard to these questions has nat-urally also to a significant degree influenced the interpretation ofGos.Phil.’scontents.BentleyLayton,forexample,claimsthat“itwouldbemis-leading to reconstruct a single theological system” from the entireGos.Phil. since in his opinion the text is an anthology representing “probablymore than one Valentinian theological perspective.”35Therefore, Laytonargues, “individual groups of excerpts” are better “studied in isolation,with comparison of other works or fragments of Valentinianism or ofclassic gnosticism.”36Layton thinks it is probably only “through an inad-vertence” that “the excerpts are not divided from one another” in themanuscript.37For the scholar seeking to understand the doctrinal contents andfunction of the text there are, however, serious problems connectedwith treating the text as a collection of excerpts.38Michael Williams hasH.

Phil.’s web of signification...The Christian as a ChristThe identification of the individual Christian with Christ is a centraltheme inGos. Phil. and seems to be a premise underlying much of itsrhetoric. The most direct statement of this identification occurs at theend of an important passage referring to Christian initiation, where thefully initiated person is described with the words, “this one is no longera[Christian],butaChrist”(ⲡⲁⲉⲓ ⲅⲁⲣ ⲟⲩⲕⲉⲧⲓ ⲟⲩ[ⲭⲣⲏ] ̇ⲥ ̇ⲧ[ⲓ]ⲁⲛⲟⲥ ⲡⲉ ⲁⲗⲗⲁⲟⲩⲭ̄ⲣ̄ⲥⲡⲉ).64Inthepresentsectionweshallseehowtheconceptualblendthechristian is a christ serves a similar function inGos.

In this case, whatintertextual and conceptual knowledge, which mental images, will bebrought to the reader’s mind by the reference to Christ will of neces-sity vary, as will the features that are projected to the blend to mutuallyreframetheconceptsoftheChristianandChristinareadingofGos.Phil.The construction of such interpretive blends is not only dependenton the reader’s prior knowledge of Christ, but is of course also shapedby the tractate’s rhetoric. Of prime importance in this regard is themanner in which a number of conceptual, intertextual, and intratextualblends is cued and combined throughout the text. Here it must again beemphasised thatGos. Phil.givesitsreadersratherfreereinswithregardto the construction, combination, and running of these blends, as manyoftheblendsinGos.Phil.,andtheinferencestheycreate,areleftunstatedfor the reader to make on his or her own.68It is basically this opennesswhich has made it so difficult for modern scholars to get a firm grip onGos. Phil. It is an openness that makes for a potentially very wide anddiverse range of interpretations, especially among readers who are farremoved from, and lack knowledge of, the tractate’s original context(s),as modern treatments ofGos. Phil. amply attest to....Christology and AnthropologyWith regard to the statement that the initiated Christian has become aChrist, the central issue is one of Christology. In cognitive terms thisentailsaquestionofthecontentsoftheChristICMasitispresupposedbyGos. Phil. It further raises the issue of how the ICM is utilised in atriggering of interpretive blends. Which elements of the Christ ICMare called upon and projected to the interpretive blend to enlighten thereader’s understanding of the anthropology of the individual Christian?And in what ways are the ChristICM itself affected by the blend? Sincethe specific nature of the projection is not specified in the passage inquestion, and we lack any firm knowledge of the extra-textual contextofGos. Phil., such as its date and provenance,69we have to infer which68Cf. Painchaud, “La composition”, and the discussion below.69Although one might get the impression from recent scholarship thatGos.

Phil., and on the basis of intra- and intertextual cues foundthere.Asweshallsee,Gos.Phil.isatractatethatexpressesitsunderlyingChristologyinavarietyofways,andtouncoverthisChristologyweneedto interpret a wide range of blends.The conceptual blend of Christ and the Christian initiate is not meta-phorical in the strict sense. Since both input spaces project structure tothe blended space, they are both framing inputs, and the inferences cre-ated in the blend are projected backwards to both inputs, not just to oneof them. The concept of the Christian is illuminated by the concept ofChrist,butatthesametimetheoppositeisalsotrue.70Not only may thereader’s experience of ritual initiation, and of bodily experience in gen-eral,informhisorherunderstandingofChrist,butGos.Phil.’sreferencesto Christ’s baptism, for example, may also help the reader to conceptu-alise his or her own experience of baptism and chrismation.71Moreover,the reader’s own experience of baptism and chrismation also creates aframe of reference with regard to the understanding of the baptism ofChrist in the river Jordan. In what follows we shall see howGos. Phil.’sdescriptionsanddiscussionsof Christ’s names, titles, constitution, birth,death,baptism,andotherworksordeedsmayinformourunderstandingof the tractate’s underlying sacramental soteriology.Before we do that, however, we need to consider the basic anthro-pology underlying the tractate, that is, its basic views concerning theconstitution of the human being.Gos. Phil. seems to presuppose a rel-atively simple constitutionofbody andsoul,andnodivisionofthelatterinto separate parts seems to be implied. There is not much direct infor-mation concerning the human soul inGos. Phil., but we do learn that“it is a valuable thing, and it has come to be in a contemptible body”(ⲟⲩϩⲱⲃⲉϥⲧⲁⲉⲓⲏⲩⲡⲉⲁⲥϣⲱⲡⲉϩ̄ⲛⲛⲟⲩⲥⲱⲙⲁⲉϥϣⲏⲥ).72Moreover, the trac-have any firm knowledge concerning either its geographical or sectarian provenance, orits date. See the discussion in section , below.70Thisisthusadouble-scopeblendratherthanasingle-scopeone.AsDesCampandSweetser put it, “Double scope blends,likesinglescopeblends,involveinputs...withdifferent organizing frames. The more one feels that a single input’s inferential structuredominates in the final blend, the more a given cognitive construction will feel like ametaphor, or single scope blend” (DesCamp and Sweetser, “Metaphors for God,” ,emphasis in original).71In this study the term “chrismation” is used to denote any application of chrism(cf.E.C.Whitaker,Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy[d ed.; revised by MaxwellE. Johnson; Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press, ], ).72Gos.

Phil.74It is thus a rather simple anthropology that seems to bepresupposed byGos. Phil. and its discourse is distinctly non-technical.There are no detailed discussions on either the human soul or its rela-tionship with the body, nor of a human spirit and its relationship to thesoul. As we shall see, however, the text rather confusingly uses the terms“body” (σ#μα), “flesh” (σ;ρ\u0003), “soul” (ψυ\u0010\u0004), and “spirit” (πνε\u0016μα)inseveral different senses for different purposes in different contexts. Wewill return to the several ways in which these terms are used as we pro-ceed.The Christology ofGos. Phil. draws to a considerable extent on theGospel of John, and we will see that certain passages, such as the pro-logue, the discourse on the bread of life, and the Nicodemus dialogue,are fundamental. Secondarily, it seems to draw on Hebrews, Revelation,the Johannine epistles, and several of the Pauline epistles. The synopticmaterial primarily from Matthew, but also from Luke, cited and alludedto byGos. Phil. seems to be interpreted primarily from the perspectivegiven by the abovementioned material.73Gos.

Phil., then, Jesus’ appear-ance to his disciples was as a reflection of themselves, and thus only bybecoming truly like him could they see Jesus as he really was.95This alsorecalls John :, which, likeGos. Phil., makes the causal connectionbetween becominglike Christandseeing him as heis: “when heappearswe shall become like him, for we shall see him as he is” (ⲉϥϣⲁⲛⲟⲩⲱⲛ̄ϩⲉⲃⲟⲗⲧ̄ⲛⲛⲁϣⲱⲡⲉⲉⲛⲉⲓⲛⲉ̄ⲙⲙⲟϥϫⲉⲧ̄ⲛⲛⲁⲛⲁⲩⲉⲣⲟϥⲕⲁⲧⲁⲑⲉⲉⲧ̄ϥϣⲟⲟⲡ̄ⲛϩⲏⲧ̄ⲥ).96Another passage that may be recalled in this context is Phil :, whereJesus is described as “this one who shall change the body of our humil-ity into the likeness of the body of his glory” (ⲡⲁ ̈ⲓⲉⲧⲛⲁϣ ̈ⲓⲃⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲥⲱⲙⲁ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲛⲑ̄ⲃⲃ ̈ⲓⲟ ⲉⲡⲉⲓⲛⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲥⲱⲙⲁ̄ⲙⲡⲉϥⲉⲟⲟⲩ).97According toGos.

According to Origen, as inGos. Phil., Christ changes his appearancein accordance with the spiritual state of those who see him (see Origen,Comm. Matt.,.–).93See the discussion below.94Majella Franzmann claims that the Logos is here “a kind of heavenly garmentof glory which must hide itself in certain circumstances, so that Jesus can be seen”(Franzmann,Jesus,).However,Gos.Phil.onlystatesthattheLogoswashiddentothosewhowerenotlikeJesusinpower,itdoesnotsaythatithadtobehiddeninorderforJesusto be seen.

First, however, we need to investigatefurther the identity and function of the Logos itself.InGos. Phil., the Logos does not operate in isolation, but is intimatelyconnected with the Holy Spirit and with mystagogy. The tractate’s mostexplicit statement of this relationship appears in the passage, alreadyreferred to above, which identifies Jesus’ flesh with the Logos:ⲡⲉⲧⲁⲟⲩⲱⲙⲁⲛ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲥⲁⲣⲝⲁⲩⲱ̄ⲛϥⲥⲱ̄ⲙⲡⲁⲥⲛⲟϥⲙ̄ⲛⲧⲁϥⲱⲛϩϩⲣⲁ ̈ⲓ̄ⲛϩⲏⲧ̄ϥⲁϣⲧⲉⲧⲉϥⲥⲁⲣⲝⲡⲉⲡⲗⲟⲅⲟⲥⲁⲩⲱⲡⲉϥⲥⲛⲟϥⲡⲉⲡ̄ⲡ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲁⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ“He who will not eat my flesh and drink my blood has not life in him.”100What is it?

Since Adamhas the spirit as one of his two virgin mothers, and since the spirit isdescribed as being given to him, it stands to reason that Adam was infact given “his mother” when he was given the spirit.108The spirit isthus paradoxically at the same time both Adam’s mother and his soul’spartner.109Moreover, with the spirit being specifically the mother ofAdam’ssoul, as this passage states it, his other mother, “the virgin earth”(ⲡⲕⲁϩ̄ⲙⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ), may by extension be regarded simply as the motherof his body.110108Thomassen, however, asserts that “the phrase ̇ⲡ[ⲉ]ⲛⲧⲁⲩⲧⲁⲁϥ...ⲧⲉϥⲙⲁⲁⲩcannotbe correct” and suggests that some words might be missing, venturing as a possibleemendation, ̇ⲡ[ⲉ]ⲛⲧⲁⲩⲧⲁⲁϥⲛⲁϥ〈ⲉⲃⲟⲗϩⲓⲧ̄ⲛⲧⲥⲟⲫⲓⲁⲉⲧⲉⲧⲁⲉⲓ〉ⲧⲉⲧⲉϥⲙⲁⲁⲩ(Thomassen,TheSpiritual Seed, ). As Schenke points out, however, the manuscript reading is “in sichgrammatisch und auch semantisch ohne Tadel” (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium,). Nevertheless, Schenke, who, like Thomassen, interprets the text on the basis of“Valentinianism,” also has problems making sense of the text as it stands, and opts tochangeit.Schenkearguesthatonedoesnotexpectthetexttogoonfromitsidentificationofthespiritasthesoul’spartnertoastatementconcerningwhatthespiritis,butratheroneconcerning itsoriginorwhogaveit,concludingthat,“wennmandiesenSatzimKontextverstehen will, kommt man wohl nicht um die Diagnose einer Textverderbnis herum,”and suggests to change the text to ̇ⲡ[ⲉ]ⲛⲧⲁ〈ϥ〉ⲧⲁⲁϥ,andtranslates“Der,〈der〉ihnihmgegebenhat, war seine Mutter” (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium,).

Phil.seemstorevelinparadoxes.SeebelowforadiscussionofhowGos.Phil.’sviewsontheVirginMaryand Mary Magdalene parallels this motif of the spirit as both mother and partner.110Both of these terms, “the spirit” (ⲡⲡ̄ⲛ̄ⲁ)and“theearth”(ⲡⲕⲁϩ) are grammaticallymasculine in Coptic. In Greek, “the earth” (Jγ\u0011) is feminine, while “the spirit” (τ\u001fπνε\u0016μα) is neuter. In Hebrew and Syriac, however, both terms are feminine (see, e.g.,Segelberg, “Antiochene Background,” –; Pétrement,ASeparateGod, ). Refer-ence to Adam having been brought forth by the virgin earth is also found in, e.g., Ire-naeus,Haer.

Thedescription of God taking Adam’s rib to create his female counterpart ishereinterpretedashissoulbeingtakenawayfromhim,aninterpretationthat finds support in the fact that Eve, as the female part of the original\u001bν\u0019ρωπ\u0012ς,wasofteninterpretedasoriginallybeinginsidehim,113aswehavealsoseeninourdiscussionofExeg.Soul.LikeinExeg.Soul,theparttakenoutoftheoriginal\u001bν\u0019ρωπ\u0012ςisalsoinGos.Phil.interpretedashissoul.

His “soul” (ⲯⲩⲭⲏ)istakenand,ifmyreconstruction is correct, “life” (ⲱⲛϩ)isgiveninreturn.Here we should also take into consideration the fact that the Greekwordψυ\u0010\u0004(ⲯⲩⲭⲏ) not only denotes “soul,” but also “life.” There is thusa potential play on words in this passage, where the tractate makes apoint both of the connection between Eve, as the woman given Adamin return, and “life,” and between the “soul” and “life.”117Thus in apolysemically based blend, Adam’s original life (his soul/life) is takenfrom him and a new “life” is given in return. This should probablynot be taken too literally, but the juxtaposition between the taking ofAdam’soriginallifeanditsreplacementbyanewone,wouldratherseemto highlight his loss of eternal life and its replacement by its earthlycounterpart, i.e., mortality. Nevertheless, the passage may function onseveral levels simultaneously, as we will see below when we turn toconsiderthemeaningof“life”and“death”inGos.Phil.morebroadly,andthetractate’smanyparallelismsbetweenthegardenofEdennarrativeandthe life and deeds of Christ. It is, however, the latter, the life and deeds ofChrist, which we will turn to first.....The Conception and Birth of ChristA logical place to continue our analysis of the Christology ofGos.Phil.iswith its views on Christ’s incarnation. Here the tractate is rather difficulttointerpret.ThefirstproblemconcernstheroleoftheVirginMary.That“Christ was born from a virgin” (ⲁⲩϫⲡⲉⲡⲉ̄ⲭ̄ⲥⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ)118isaffirmed in a comparison with Adam, who, as we have seen, is allegedto have come into being from two virgins.119Gos.

When did a female ever conceive by afemale? “Mary is the virgin whom no power defiled.”121(Gos. Phil. .–)The suggestion that the Virgin Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit isridiculed byGos. Phil. on the grounds that the Holy Spirit is female.122Since females do not conceive by females, arguesGos. Phil., the VirginMary cannot have conceived by the Holy Spirit.123Mary is still to bereferred to as a virgin, but this is in relation to the “powers” (ⲇⲩⲛⲁⲙⲓⲥ),and not in relation to Joseph,124whose actual fatherhoodGos. Phil.indeed seems to stress:120ⲱ:\u0002ν γαστρ\r =\u0010ειν(cf. Matt :).121For this phrase, see alsoHyp. Arch. .–. It may be worth noting that the Copticword that is here translated as “defiled,”ϫⲱϩ̄ⲙ, is closely related to the wordϫⲱϩ,whichmeans “smear,” or “anoint.” Considering the importance of the anointing in relation tosacramental begetting inGos. Phil., the description of Mary’s undefiled state in relationto the “powers” might thus conceivably be read as a pun on the anointing, in whichcase it may signify that Mary did not conceive by the Holy Spirit because she was notdefiled/smeared/anointed by any “power,” including the Holy Spirit. See below for adiscussion of the continuation of the passage in relation toGos. Phil.’s views regardingHebrews/Jews and apostles.122The concept of the Holy Spirit as female is shared by, e.g., theGospel of the Hebrews(See Philipp Vielhauer and Georg Strecker, “Jewish-Christian Gospels,” inGospels andRelated Writings[ed. Wilhelm Schneemelcher and R. McL. Wilson; vol.  ofNew Testa-ment Apocrypha; rev. ed.; Cambridge: James Clarke, ], ; the relevant passage iscited in Origen,Comm. Jo., .;Hom.

Phil., is to the Gospelof Matthew,126where Jesus repeatedly refers to “my father who is inheaven,”127a phrase that is unique to Matthew among the four canonicalgospels. That Christ has two fathers thus seems to imply the fatherhoodof Joseph, a fatherhood which is also affirmed elsewhere inGos. Phil.where Jesus is referred to directly as Joseph’s seed.128Abiblicalintertextthat may be recalled here is Rom :, where Paul describes Christ as one“whocameintobeingfromtheseedofDavidaccordingtotheflesh”(ⲡⲁ ̈ⲓⲉⲛⲧⲁϥϣⲱⲡⲉⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲥⲡⲉⲣⲙⲁ̄ⲛⲇⲁⲩⲉⲓⲇⲕⲁⲧⲁⲥⲁⲣⲝ).129We have seen that Jesus is the “seed” of Joseph and that he is born bytheVirginMary,whoisavirginonlyinrelationtothe“powers.”Itisthushard to resist the conclusion that inGos.

Thus Jesusestablished everything within himself through these, and it is appropriateforeachoneofthedisciplestowalkintohisrest. (Gos.Phil..–.)The major problem of this notoriously difficult passage concerns theidentitiesof“thevirginwhocamedown”(ⲧⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ̄ⲛⲧⲁϩⲉⲓⲁⲡⲓⲧ̄ⲛ),“thefather of all things” (ⲡⲉⲓⲱⲧ̄ⲙⲡⲧⲏⲣϥ), and “the great bridal chamber”(ⲡⲛⲟϭ̄ⲙⲡⲁⲥⲧⲟⲥ). Despite the regrettable damage to the beginning of thepassage, we may here still discern a direct reference to the river Jordanand to Jesus revealing or opening (ϭⲱⲗⲡ[ⲉⲃⲟⲗ]) something. I suggestthatthepassageisbestunderstoodprimarilyinthelightofthecanonicalaccounts of the Jordan event, cued already by the direct reference to theriver. We shall see, however, that there are also other crucial intertextsthat need to be invoked in order to make sense of the passage.InthecanonicalgospelsthebaptismofJesusintheJordanisdescribedin Matt :–, Mark :–, and Luke :–, while John only refersto it indirectly (John :–). From the references to begetting, and thephrase “on that day” (̄ⲙⲫⲟⲟⲩⲉⲧ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲩ) in the passage quoted above, theLukanvariantreadingwiththewording“thisdayIhavebegottenthee”133seems to be the most relevant of these accounts for the interpretationof our passage. Moreover, while all the synoptic accounts and even theGospel of John include the descent of the Spirit upon Jesus in the formof a dove,134only Luke specifies that the Spirit comes down “in bodily133\u0002γQ σ\u0004μερ\u0012ν γεγ\u001aννηκ; σε(Luke :). David Tripp (Tripp, “Sacramental System,”–) rightly notes thatGos. Phil. probably knew this version of the gospel tradition.This wording also appears, however, to have been the one used in theDiatessaron(seeKilian McDonnell,The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan: The Trinitarian and Cosmic Orderof Salvation[Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press, ], ), so we cannot rule out thepossibilityof theDiatessaron,ratherthanLukeitself,beingthechief authorial inputtext,and also a more relevant intertext for the prospective reader. The formula is also foundin Heb :, :, and Ps :.134Matt :; Mark :; Luke :; John :."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"chapter fourform” (σωματικ#ς/ϩ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲥⲙⲟⲧ̄ⲛⲥⲱⲙⲁ), which may be echoed inGos.Phil.’s reference to “his body” (ⲡⲉϥⲥⲱⲙⲁ).TakingtheprimarysettingtobethebaptismofJesusintheJordan,mysuggestionisthatthe“virginwhocamedown”istobeidentifiedwiththeHoly Spirit descending upon Jesus. There are several reasons for this.

In his recent monograph, however,Thomassenseemsrathertowantitbothways,andnowholds“thevirginwhocamedown”primarily to be Sophia (see Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, ), but also “the Saviour ...cast in the role of the female partner and bride in the marital union” (see ibid., )."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipthenthe“fatherofallthings”shouldinsomewayrefertoJesus.Theuseofthetitle“thefatherofallthings”(ⲡⲉⲓⲱⲧ̄ⲙⲡⲧⲏⲣϥ)presentshimasthecre-ator of all things, which makes good sense in light of the prologue of theGospelofJohn,whereitistheLogoswhoisspecificallydescribedinsuchterms: “It was through him that everything came into being” (̄ⲛⲧⲁⲡⲧⲏⲣϥϣⲱⲡⲉⲉⲃⲟⲗϩⲓⲧⲟⲟⲧ̄ϥ), states John :.137As we shall see, it is also highlysignificant that John goes on to state in : that, “that which came intobeing within him was life, and life was the light of men” (ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϥϣⲱⲡⲉϩⲣⲁ ̈ⲓ̄ⲛϩⲏⲧ̄ϥ ⲡⲉ ⲡⲱⲛϩ ⲁⲩⲱ ⲡⲱⲛϩ ⲡⲉ ⲡⲟⲩⲟ ̈ⲓⲛ̄ⲛ̄ⲣⲣⲱⲙⲉ).138Moreover, thereference in this passage to “He who [was begotten] before all things”(ⲡⲉⲛ[ⲧⲁϥϫⲡⲟϥϩ]ⲁⲧⲉϩⲏ̄ⲙⲡⲧⲏⲣϥ)alsorecallsthestatementthattheLogoswas with God in the beginning (John :), and other statements to thateffectelsewhereinJohn.Soitseemstofitthecontextbesttoidentify“theFather of all things” with the Logos,139and “the virgin who came down”with the Holy Spirit.

Phil.informsus,is properly described as “a mystery” (ⲟⲩⲙⲩⲥⲧⲏⲣⲓⲟⲛ), where “the Fatherof all things joined (ϩⲱⲧ̄ⲣ) with the virgin who came down, and a fireilluminatedhim(ⲁⲩⲕⲱⲧ̄ⲣⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲛⲉⲣⲟϥ).”WhatGos.Phil.describesinthispassage, then, seems to be the joining of the Logos and the Holy Spiritat the baptism of Jesus, which also, in the light of the important passagediscussedearlier,implies thejoiningofJesus’ fleshwith his blood, whichmay also explain the puzzling statement that “it was because of this thathis body came into being” (ⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓⲡⲉϥⲥⲱⲙⲁ̄ⲛⲧⲁϥϣⲱⲡⲉ).140Significantly,Gos.

The imageryof begetting and joining is thus connected logically to the imagery ofthe bridal chamber by way of being closely linked concepts within thesame domain or ICM of marriage and procreation. The connections tothe anointing and the illuminating fire do not belong naturally to thatsame ICM, but the association of fire and light to begetting on the onehand, and to anointing with chrism on the other, is explicitly stated inGos.

Water, in the context of a discussion of Jesus’ baptism in theJordan, must of course refer to the baptismal waters. The description ofthe fire illuminating Jesus at his baptism, when the Logos joined withthe Holy Spirit and “his body came into being,”144seems to refer to thechrismation,145and light seems here as elsewhere inGos.

Phil. describesin terms of a “bridal chamber.” It will be shown below that this is anICM that may be used to frame several different inputs, so at this pointwe will limit the analysis to the identity of “the great bridal chamber”(ⲡⲛⲟϭ̄ⲙⲡⲁⲥⲧⲟⲥ) mentioned in the Jordan passage. The setting being asit is, and the joining being one between the Logos and the Holy Spirit,there seem to be two possibilities available to us. One is simply that theterm refers to the ritual act(s) of baptism and/or chrismation at the Jor-dan, which opened up these ritual acts for the (re)enactment by Chris-tians.Anothercompellingpossibilityisthatthetermmaybeunderstoodas a reference to the body of Christ, for the body of Christ may itselfbe regarded as the “bridal chamber” within which the Logos and HolySpirit, the flesh and blood of Jesus, are joined.157Finally, the concept ofthe bridal chamber may here simply be understood as a reference to theprocessofjoiningandbegettingratherthanasareferencetowhereittookplace.Importantly, however, these possibilities are by no means mutuallyexclusive.Inaninterpretationofthepassageinquestionthemorespecificreferential and christological aspects and the more general processual153Gos.

We will return to thequestionoftheimplicationsofthisunderstandingofthebaptismofJesusfor the understanding of the function of the Christian rituals below, butfirst we must take a look at how this understanding of the generationof Christ parallels the tractate’s understanding of the constitution andactions of the first man, Adam.Wehave seenthat throughhis(first) begetting andbirth,fromJosephand Mary, either as simply the body of the earthly Jesus, or as theLogos incarnated, and his second begetting and birth at the baptism inthe Jordan, with its joining together of the Holy Spirit and the Logos,Jesus “established everything within himself.” In fact, these conclusionsregarding the birth and baptism of Jesus reveal an interesting conceptualblend between the figures of Adam and Christ, and one that is alsopointed out quite explicitly byGos. Phil. in a passage already referred toseveral times inthe discussionabove, wherethe tractate explains exactlywhy it is that Jesus must be born from a virgin:ⲁⲁⲇⲁⲙ ϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ϩ̄ⲛⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ ⲥ̄ⲛⲧⲉ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ϩ̄ⲙⲡ̄ⲡ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲁⲁⲩⲱⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲙⲡⲕⲁϩ̄ⲙⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ ⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓ ⲁⲩϫⲡⲉⲡⲉ̄ⲭ̄ⲥⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ ϫⲉⲕⲁⲁⲥ ⲡⲉⲥⲗⲟⲟⲧⲉ̄ⲛⲧⲁϩϣⲱⲡⲉϩ̄ⲛⲧⲉϩⲟⲩⲉⲓⲧⲉⲉϥⲛ ̇ⲁ[ⲥ] ̇ⲉϩⲱϥⲉⲣⲁⲧϥAdam came into being from two virgins, from the spirit and from thevirgin earth.158Therefore Christ was born from a virgin, so that he mightrectify the fall that happened in the beginning. (Gos. Phil. .–)Several scholars have assumed that since Adam is described as havingcome into being from two virgins, and since Christ came specificallyto rectify Adam’s primordial mistakes, thenGos. Phil.hereimpliesthatChrist had to be born of one virgin mother, rather than two as was thecase with Adam.159From what is stated in various places throughout thetext, however, it may be gathered that Christ in fact also seems to havecome into being from two virgin mothers,160namely the Virgin Maryand “the virgin who came down,” i.e., the Holy Spirit,161and that he158Cf. Gen :.159See, e.g., Janssens, “L’Évangile selon Philippe,” ; Buckley, “Conceptual Models,”.160Cf.

The latter is indeed in both casesdescribed as being the mother of its recipient, and as the partner of, inAdam’s case, the soul, and, in the case of Christ, the Logos. A highlyinteresting entailment of this blend is that the Logos, Christ’s flesh, isconceptually on the level of Adam’s soul, an entailment which we shallsee carries potentially great significance for the sacramental soteriologyof the tractate as a whole.The enigmatic reference to Christ coming out of the bridal chamberrecallsPs:LXX.164Itmay,however,alsobeinterpretedasametaphorhighlighting the parallels between this second begetting and birth in theJordan and the first, natural one, since Christ is described as coming out“like the one who came into being from the bridegroom and the bride.”It may thus be read as a metaphorical description of what happenedat Jesus’ baptism in the river Jordan, which at one and the same timereferstosubsequentritualreenactmentbyChristianpriestsandinitiates,and recalls his begetting and birth from the Virgin Mary. Jesus’ birthaccording to the flesh thereby becomes simultaneously a metaphor anda prefiguration for both his own baptism and that of the Christians.From what we have found concerningGos. Phil.’s statements on thebirth and baptism of Jesus, it seems reasonably clear that Jesus was notborn completely as the Saviour until his baptism in the Jordan. It alsoseems clear that the Holy Spirit did not enter into Jesus until this event,whereitunitedwithhisLogos,andthebody(ⲥⲱⲙⲁ)ofChristwas“begotten.” Thus,Gos. Phil.’s statement concerning the baptismal rebirth162Cf. Franzmann,Jesus, , ; Pagels, “Ritual,” . According to Thomassen, how-ever, Jesus’ two virgin mothers are Sophia and Mary, and his two fathers are “the tran-scendent father” and “the Demiurge (‘Joseph’)” (Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, –).Catherine Trautmann argues that the Saviour’s two fathers correspond to Adam’s twomothers (see Catherine Trautmann, “La parenté dans l’Évangile selon Philippe,” inCol-loqueInternationalsurlestextesdeNagHammadi[Québec,–août][ed.BernardBarc; BCNH Études ; Québec: Les Presses de l’Université Laval, ], ).163The contrast between the first Adam as the one brought forth by “the virgin earth”and the new Adam (Christ) brought forth by the Virgin Mary is also found in, e.g.,Irenaeus,Haer. III.. (likeGos. Phil., Irenaeus uses it as an argument for the fact thatChrist was born from a virgin), as wellas in Ephrem,HNat.,(seeMurray,Symbols ofChurch and Kingdom,  n. ), and in Jacob of Serugh (see Brock, “Baptismal Themes,”).164Cf. also Joel :."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipof the Christian initiates, namely that “when we were begotten we werejoined” (̄ⲛⲧⲁⲣⲟⲩϫⲡⲟⲛⲁⲩϩⲟⲧⲣ̄ⲛ),165maybesaidtobeequallytrueforthebaptism of Jesus, where he was begotten when his Logos united with theHoly Spirit.As for the Logos, here there are two main possibilities. Either it wasborn through the Virgin Mary or it descended at the Jordan along withthe Holy Spirit. However, the fact that there is a clear reference to thedescent of the spirit at the Jordan, but no references that may reasonablybetakentorefertoanydescentoftheLogos,makesitseemmostprobablethat the Logos was born through Mary. Now, where does this leaveJoseph? And does this mean that the Jesus who was born of Mary wasincorporeal?WehaveseenthattheLogosisdescribedasboth“thefatherof all things” and as existing “before everything,” both of which make itunlikely that it is to be equated with the seed of Joseph. We thus seem tobe left, as the most viable solution, with the conclusion that the earthlybodyofJesuswasbegottenbyJosephandbornofMary,whileatthesametime containing the Logos within it. Jesus’ true body then seems only tocomeintobeingwhentheLogosisunitedwiththeHolySpiritatbaptism,within the body of the earthly Jesus.166Majella Franzmann has argued that even though Jesus is describedas having flesh and blood, “this does not mean that he is human,” andshesuggests thateven thoughJesus mightbeahuman beingpriortotheJordanevent,“histransformationthereleavesnodoubtthatthereafterheisaspiritualbeing.ThegospeltellsusthathisfleshistheLogos(.)andhis blood is the Holy Spirit (.–).”167We should remember, however,that “his flesh” in this context should most probably be understood asJesus’trueflesh, which, as we have seen fromGos. Phil.’s interpretationof the transfiguration, was normally hidden from view.168That his trueflesh (ⲥⲁⲣⲝ) is the Logos, and his blood (ⲥⲛⲟϥ) is the Holy Spirit doesnot necessarily imply that Jesus did not have a material body (ⲥⲱⲙⲁ)inadditiontothebodythatcameintobeingathisbaptism.Oneimplicationwe may draw fromGos.

In other words,only one who has been begotten himself can create others who may alsoobtain the power to beget. In contrast to proper begetting, creating doesnot imply any kinship relations, descent, succession, or inheritance. Itis here of utmost significance that begetting involves fathers and sons,rather than creators and creations. In order to be able to continue alineage, and to receive one’s “maker’s” abilities, it is necessary to bebegotten, rather than made.Gos.

Schenke originallydivided this passage into his sayings number  and  (Schenke, “Das Evangeliumnach Philippus [],” –; Schenke, “Das Evangelium nach Philippus [],” ;Schenke, “The Gospel of Philip,” ), but later divided it even futher into , a, andb (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ; Schenke, “Das Evangelium nach Philippus[NHC II,],” ).

Fathers and SonsAswehaveseen,thefather-sonimageryinGos.Phil.iscloselyconnectedto Christ, and we will now take a closer look at some aspects of whatChrist and the individual Christian have in common, and how they arerelated. In a passage that, significantly, deals directly with the rituals ofbaptism and chrismation we learn that,ⲡⲭⲣⲉⲓⲥⲙⲁ ϥⲟ̄ⲛϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ ⲉⲡⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ⲅⲁⲣ ϩ̄ⲙⲡⲭⲣⲓⲥⲙⲁ ⲁⲩⲙⲟⲩⲧⲉ ⲉⲣⲟⲛϫⲉⲭⲣⲓⲥⲧⲓⲁⲛⲟⲥ ⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁ ⲁⲛ ⲁⲩⲱ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲩⲙⲟⲩⲧⲉ ⲉⲡⲉ̄ⲭ̄ⲥⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲭⲣⲓⲥⲙⲁⲁⲡⲉⲓⲱⲧⲅⲁⲣⲧⲱϩⲥ̄ⲙⲡϣⲏⲣⲉⲁⲡϣⲏⲣⲉⲇⲉⲧⲱϩⲥ̄ⲛⲁⲡⲟⲥⲧⲟⲗⲟⲥⲁⲛⲁⲡⲟⲥⲧⲟⲗⲟⲥⲇⲉⲧⲁϩⲥ̄ⲛThe chrism is superior to baptism, for from the chrism we were calledChristian,notbecauseofbaptism,anditwasbecauseofthechrismthatChrist was named (such). For the Father anointed the Son, and the Sonanointed the apostles, and the apostles anointed us.(Gos. Phil. .–)identification of the moulded creature with Adam is also made by Layton,The GnosticScriptures, ; Wilson,The Gospel of Philip, ; Buckley and Good, “SacramentalLanguage,”.GrantinterpretstheserpentasIaldabaoth(RobertM.Grant,“TheMysteryof Marriage in the Gospel of Philip,”VC []: ; cf. also Borchert, “LiteraryArrangement,” –). Trautmann holds that it is Adam who is the father of Cain andargues that the union between Adam and Eve is described as adultery because Adam inher opinion is equated with the serpent (see Trautmann, “La parenté,” ). Pagels hasarguedthatEve’sadulterywiththeserpentshouldhereberegardedastheunionbetweenψυ\u0010\u0004,representedbyEve,andMλη, represented by the serpent (Pagels, “Adam and Eve,Christ and the Church,” ; Elaine H.

First, the nameChristandthenameChristianareherebothderivedetymologicallyfromthe chrism. This connection serves several purposes. Not only does itconnect the abovementioned names to the ritual act of chrismation, italso strengthens the identification between Christ and the individualChristian, and it makes the point that chrismation is of greater impor-tance than baptism.197The special importance of the chrism is high-lightedinseveralplacesthroughoutthetractate,andweshalllaterreturnto a more detailed analysis of what this and other passages have to sayconcerning the function of the anointing in relation to baptism andEucharist.Equally significant in this passage as the concern with the relativeimportance of the chrism, however, is the emphasis upon the unbrokensuccessionfromGodthefather,viaChristandtheapostles,totheautho-rial“us,”andtheroleofthechrisminthisprocess.198It is also highlysignificant that God and Christ are here referred to as Father and Son,thereby creating the inference that the relationship between the otherpairs in the sequence are analogous to a father-son relationship. This isespecially the case in light of certain other passages inGos. Phil.whichwewillreturntobelow.Wewillalsoseehowthisimportantfeaturefunc-tionsrhetoricallyelsewhereinGos.Phil.,butfirstletustakealookattheanalogies that are implied here (see fig. ).We are prompted by the very juxtaposition of these relationships toconsider each pair in terms of the others and to consider what theymight all have in common. Each of the input spaces consists of a rela-tionship between an anointer and an anointed, and there are extensivemappings of counterpart-relations between them. There are vital outer-spacerole-relationsbetweenFather,God,Christ,andApostles,andsimi-larlybetweenSon,Christ,Apostles,and“Us.”199Moreover,thereisavitalanalogy-relation between the anointer-anointed relationships in each ofthe four inputs.

The importanceofbaptisminitsownrightseemstobeconfirmedelsewhereinthetractate(seeGos.Phil..–; .–; .–). Nor does it seem to be directed against what is usuallyregarded as “normal,” “mainstream,” or “orthodox” Christian practice. It seems merelytobe an argument for the higher importance of chrismation relative to baptism. See belowfor a discussion of the polemical aspects ofGos. Phil.198Cf. M.L. Turner,Gospel According to Philip, .199Foradiscussiontheconceptof“vitalrelations”betweeninputspaces,seechapter."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipspace.Moreover,twopairsoftheseinputspacesalsohavetheirownlocalgenericspaces.TheFather-SonandGod-Christinputsarelinkedbyvitalouter-spacerole-relationsandsharetheFather-Soninput’sgenericprop-erties, in this context most notably that of a begetter-begotten relation-ship.Theotherpairofinputs,theanalogicallylinkedChrist-ApostlesandApostles-“Us” inputs, are both initiator-initiate relationships, and thisrelationshipisthusdulyprojectedtotheirsharedlocalgenericspace(seefig. ).The two pairs of inputs may thus be blended individually, but what isof special interest here is the greater blend caused by the four together,including their two local generic spaces. Significantly, these genericspaces,theinitiator-initiatedandthebegetter-begottenspaces,arethem-selves linked by analogy,200and themselves become input spaces in theirown local integration network. This is a highly important double-scopeblend, and from their position as higher-level inputs within the overallintegration network, these generic-inputs project important structure tothemainblend.Themostnotableentailmentofthislocalintegrationnet-work is the inference that initiation can be regarded as a begetting andvice versa. We may isolate and analyse this conceptual integration net-work as shown in fig. .We may also regard as properties of this common generic space therelationships between a predecessor and a successor, and that of a giverand a receiver, as well as a hierarchical power relationship. In the overallblended space which receives elements and structure from all six inputspaces—the four original ones plus the two local generic spaces—God’sbegetting of Christ may consequently be regarded as an initiation, theapostles’ initiation of “us” by means of an anointing may be regarded as abegetting,andtherelationshipbetweentheinitiatorandtheinitiatedmaybe seen as a father-son relationship, to mention just a few of the manypossible entailments of this mega-blend.

For example, the fact that Christ appears in this network as bothfather and son primes the passages in John were Jesus refers to himselfandtheFatherasbeingoneandwithinoneanother.202Wemay thereforeindeed consider the conceptual integration network shown in the previ-ous figure as merely a small part of a potentially much larger network ofmental spaces, but we will focus on this model for the time being.As we have seen, this is an integration network that creates counter-part relations between a set of linked input spaces containing initiator-initiated and begetter-begotten relations and blends them. On the levelof begetter/initiator we have Father, God, Christ, and Apostles, whileon the begotten/initiator side we have Son, Christ, Apostles, and Us.Of major significance here is the fact that Christ appears both as begot-ten and as a begetter in this network, that is, as a counterpart of bothFather/begetter/initiator and Son/begotten/initiated. A major infer-ence of this blend, which lies close to the surface of the passage quotedabove,istheinstrumentalityofthechrismationintheblendedprocessesofbegetting andinitiation.ThroughoutGos.Phil.,baptism andchrisma-tion is closely connected to begetting and birth, as for instance when wearetoldthat“thesonofthebridalchamber”(ⲡϣⲏⲣⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲛⲩⲙⲫⲱⲛ)—anepithet that seems to point simultaneously to Christ and the Christianinitiate—comes into being through “water and fire and light” (ⲟⲩⲙⲟⲟⲩⲙ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲕⲱϩⲧⲙ̄ⲛⲛⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲛ), the latter two being subsequently identified withthe chrism.203Now, with all this in mind we may go back to the overarching thechristian is a christ blend we started out with. Since Christ appearsasbothfatherandson,theChristICMtherebycomestocontaintherolesand aspects of both son and father. Both of these elements, fatherhoodand sonship, become part of the christ ICM and may be projected tothe blend, creating the inference that the Christian as Christ may be201For the concept of compression to human scale, see, e.g., Fauconnier and Turner,“Compression andGlobalInsight”;Fauconnier andTurner,TheWayWeThink,–,and the discussion in chapter  of the present study.202See John :, ; :, –, ; :, .203Gos. Phil. .–. See below for the further connections that are made elsewhere inthe tractate between the chrism and the resurrection, baptism, the cross, and the Tree ofLife (Gos. Phil. .–). Cf. Williams, “Realized Eschatology,” –, ."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipboth father and son. We may consequently infer from this blend thatthe Christian initiate also has these two potential roles in and of hisstate of being a Christ, and that through the anointing with chrism theChristian may be both an initiate and an initiator, father and son, andbegetter and begotten. It is clear that we can make inferences in severaldirections in this conceptual integration network. The initiator may beregardedasafather,as(a)Christ,andasanapostle.SimilarlyChristmaybe regarded as an initiator and as a father, but he is also a son and aninitiate, and the initiate is a Christ. Significantly, the authorial “Us” mayrefer simultaneously not only to the Christians, including the impliedauthor ofGos. Phil., as initiates, but also to the implied author and hiscolleagues as initiators, and hence fathers. We will return below to thepossible implications of this conceptual integration network with regardto the possible community organisation that may be presupposed by thetractate and the wider implications with regard to the tractate’sSitz imLeben. However, it may be noted already at this point thatGos.Phil.hereseems to presuppose a system of apostolic succession204presented as asuccessionoffather-sonrelationshipsthatareultimatelyanalogicaltotherelationship between God the Father, and Christ the Son.205..... Baptism and ChrismationRitually, begetting and birth are inGos. Phil. closely connected to chris-mation and baptism.

Phil.’s concept of the“name of the father” (ⲡⲣⲁⲛ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲓⲱⲧ), for the tractate states that for theson to become father he needs to put on the father’s name:ⲟⲩⲣⲁⲛ ⲟⲩⲱⲧ ⲙⲁⲩⲧⲉⲩⲟⲩⲁϥ ϩ̄ⲙⲡⲕⲟⲥⲙⲟⲥ ⲡⲣⲁⲛ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲡⲉⲓⲱⲧ ⲧⲁⲁϥ̄ⲙⲡϣⲏⲣⲉϥϫⲟⲥⲉ ⲉⲟⲩⲟⲛ ⲛⲓⲙ ⲉⲧⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓ ⲡⲉ ⲡⲣⲁⲛ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲓⲱⲧ ⲛⲉⲣⲉⲡϣⲏⲣⲉ ⲅⲁⲣ ⲛⲁϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲁⲛⲉⲓⲱⲧⲥⲁⲃⲏⲗϫⲉⲁϥϯϩⲓⲱⲱϥ̄ⲙⲡⲣⲁⲛ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲓⲱⲧⲡⲉⲉⲓⲣⲁⲛⲛⲉⲧⲉⲩ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲩϥⲥⲉ̄ⲣⲛⲟⲉⲓⲙⲉⲛ̄ⲙⲙⲟϥⲥⲉϣⲁϫⲉⲇⲉⲉⲣⲟϥⲁⲛⲛⲉⲧⲉⲙ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲩϥⲇⲉⲥⲉ̄ⲣⲛⲟⲉⲓ̄ⲙⲙⲟϥⲁⲛ204Cf.

Since we have seen that both the reception of thenameandthereceptionoftheHolySpiritisconnectedwithchrismation,is seems evident that in order to receive the name “as a gift” in baptismone needs to receive it together with the Holy Spirit by means of achrismation.217Thischrismationthusseemstotakeplaceasapartofthebaptismalritualitself.Revelation : speaks of the name worn by Christ as being knownonly by Christ himself, but as Charles Gieschen points out, this ishyperbolic “insider” language, since Revelation states the saintsare sealedwiththenameofChristandbearitontheirforeheads.AsinJohnwhere215For patristic attestations of the connection between the chrismation and the name“Christ,” see, e.g., Kelly,Early Christian Creeds, –.216Cf. Cor :.217The connection between the name of Christ and the bestowal of the Holy Spirit isalsomade inJohn:.CharlesGieschennotes thattheimageryof thereception of thename in the New Testament “is grounded in the writing, speaking, and imparting of theDivine Name during the baptismal rite” (Gieschen, “The Divine Name,” ).

Phil., which states that onlythosewhowear the name know it. This also seems to connect the wearing of thename closely to the name Christ inGos. Phil.Itisanamethatiswornbyall Christians, and by Christians only.219The close connection between baptism and chrismation is, moreover,emphasised in a couple of passages with clear allusions to John :–which stress the importance of being reborn through both water andspirit, which in the context ofGos. Phil. is to be understood as baptismand chrismation:ϣϣⲉⲁ̄ⲣⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲍⲉϩ̄ⲙⲡⲥⲛⲁⲩϩ̄ⲙⲡⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲛⲙ̄ⲛⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩⲡⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲛⲇⲉⲡⲉⲡⲭⲣⲓⲥⲙⲁitis necessaryto baptisein both: in thelight andthewater, andthelight isthe chrism.(Gos.

Theconnections between the two can be illustrated as shown in fig. .Both Christ and the Christians are baptised in water and receive theHoly Spirit by means of an anointing. This anointing is connected toa joining and a begetting. In the case of Christ, he received the HolySpirit which united with his Logos, and his “body” came into being. Thebaptism and chrismation of the Christians thus parallel those of Christhimself by involving the reception of the Holy Spirit, as well as a joining218Gieschen, “The Divine Name,” – n. .219Charles Gieschen sees inGos.

By extension, then,what takes place in the baptismal chrismation is the reception of theHoly Spirit, which joins with the individual initiate’s soul, thus causinga begetting and a rebirth.222The metaphor of a “bridal chamber” isevidently quite apt with regard to the ritual interpretation outlined here...... The KissWe have seen howGos. Phil. plays with the polysemic possibilities ofthe wordϫⲡⲟto denote begetting, birth and acquisition, and how theunproductive child could not make sons, but only acquire brothers. Theuse of the termϫⲡⲟin the latter statement may, however, also functionas an intratextual connection to another passage inGos. Phil., wherebegetting is associated with kissing. These intratextually linked passagesmayalsofunctionsimultaneouslyascompositeallusionstoScriptureandritual, by way of an interesting twist on the imagery connected with thetermϫⲡⲟ:̄ⲛⲧⲉⲗⲉⲓⲟⲥ ⲅⲁⲣ ϩⲓⲧ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲡⲉⲓ ⲉⲩ̂ⲱ ⲁⲩⲱ ⲉⲩϫⲡⲟ ⲇⲓⲁ ⲧⲟⲩⲧⲟ ⲁⲛⲟⲛ ϩⲱⲱⲛ ⲧ̄ⲛϯⲡⲓⲉⲣ̄ⲛ̄ⲛ̄ⲛⲛⲉⲣⲏⲩⲉⲛϫⲓ̄ⲙⲡ̂ⲱⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛⲧⲭⲁⲣⲓⲥⲉⲧϩ̄ⲛ̄ⲛ̄ⲛⲛⲉⲣⲏⲩforitisbymeansofakissthattheperfectconceiveandbeget.Thereforewe too kiss one another, conceiving from the grace that is in one another.(Gos.

Phil. here explicitly connectsconceptionandbirthwithakissandwithgrace(\u0010;ρις).AritualkisswascommoninChristianityfromaveryearlystage,223and is also referred222For the connection between chrismation and rebirth, cf. Eric Segelberg, “TheCoptic-Gnostic Gospel According to Philip and Its Sacramental System,”Numen:(): .223According to the editors of the new English edition of theApostolic Tradition,“the ritual kiss appears to be a distinctively Christian practice that emerged in the NewTestament Period” (Paul F. Bradshaw, et al.,The Apostolic Tradition: A Commentary[ed.Harold W. Attridge; Hermeneia; Minneapolis: Fortress Press, ], ), and according"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"chapter fourto in several New Testament texts.224In all these cases, as also inGos.Phil., the kiss is closely connected to the reception of grace (\u0010;ρις). Themostnotable scripturalintertexttothis passage inGos. Phil., however, isCor :–, where Paul advises his “brothers” (:δελ<\u0012\u0014) that theyshould “greet one another with a holy kiss.” He follows this with thestatement that, “The grace (\u0010;ρις) of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love(:γ;πη)ofGodandthecommunion(κ\u0012ινων\u0014α)oftheHolySpiritbewithyouall.”Moreover,Gos.Phil.alsoreferstotherepeatedbegettingofsonsorchildrenelsewhere,referringto“thesons/childrenoftheperfectman” (̄ⲛϣⲏⲣⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲧⲉⲗⲉⲓⲟⲥ̄ⲣⲣⲱⲙⲉ) as “these who do not die, but are alwaysbegotten” (ⲛⲁⲉⲓⲉⲙⲁⲩⲙⲟⲩⲁⲗⲗⲁⲥⲉϫⲡⲟ̄ⲙⲙⲟⲟⲩⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓϣⲛⲓⲙ).225..... RestThe concept of “rest” (:ν;παυσις/ⲙⲧⲟⲛ)isusedinatleastthreediffer-ent senses inGos.

In addition, it is used in a sense thatis related to the present theme of marriage, unification, and procreation,with sacramental connotations.227Most importantly, we find the termused in the latter sense in yet another passage that deals with the dif-ferences between creating and begetting:̄ⲛⲑⲉ ⲉⲥϣⲟⲟⲡ̄ⲙⲙⲟⲥ̄ⲛϭⲓⲧⲁⲗⲏⲑⲉⲓⲁ̄ⲛ̄ⲛϩⲃⲏⲩⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ϣⲁⲩϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛⲧⲉϥⲇⲩⲛⲁⲙⲓⲥⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓⲥⲉⲙⲟⲩⲧⲉⲉⲣⲟⲟⲩϫⲉ̄ⲛⲇⲩⲛⲁⲙⲓⲥⲛⲉϥϩⲃⲏⲩⲉⲛⲉⲛⲉϥϣⲏⲣⲉ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲩϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ϩ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲁⲛⲁⲡⲁⲩⲥⲓⲥ ⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓ ⲧⲉϥⲇⲩⲛⲁⲙⲓⲥ̄ⲣⲡⲟⲗⲓⲧⲉⲩⲉⲥⲑⲉ ϩⲣⲁ ̈ⲓto Robert Taft, “the kiss of peace is one of the most primitive rites of the Christianliturgy.Originallyitseemstohavebeenacommongreeting,probablyexchangedateveryChristian synaxis” (Robert F.

While creation involves power, andthatpowerismanifestedinthecreated,thebegettingofchildrenrequires“a rest” (ⲟⲩⲁⲛⲁⲡⲁⲩⲥⲓⲥ),and“rest”islikewisemanifestedinthosewhohavebeenbegotten.Wehaveseenelsewherethat“hewhobegetsalsocreates,”and we learn here that “the man pertaining to the image” creates from228Fortheformersolution,see,e.g.,Schenke,“DasEvangeliumnachPhilippus[],”; Schenke, “Das Evangelium nach Philippus [],” ; Catanzaro, “The Gospel Ac-cording to Philip,” ; Wilson,The Gospel of Philip, ; Till,Das Evangelium nach Philip-pos, ; Isenberg, “Coptic Gospel,” ; Layton,The Gnostic Scriptures, ; Layton andIsenberg, “Gospel According to Philip,” ; Layton,Coptic Gnostic Chrestomathy, .For the latter solution, see, e.g., Giversen,Filipsevangeliet, ; Schenke, “The Gospel ofPhilip,” ; Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ; Schenke, “Das Evangelium nachPhilippus (NHC II,),” :.229If one chooses to readⲛⲉϥϩⲃⲏⲩⲉ ⲛⲉ ⲛⲉϥϣⲏⲣⲉas a unit and translates “his worksare his children,” this contrast between works and power on the one hand, and childrenand rest on the other, is broken. As Schenke comments regarding the solution alsochosen in the present study, of treatingⲛⲉϥϩⲃⲏⲩⲉⲛⲉas a nominal sentence in itself, “Derkleine kommentierende Nominalsatz erscheint dabei zwar als ein bisschen redundant.Aber besser Redundanz als Widersinn!” (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ).

Phil.’s understanding and use of the conceptof theresurrection, it is essential to understand the multi-layered and shiftingwaysinwhichtheconceptsoflifeanddeathareemployedinthetractate.Gos. Phil. makes a point of the general relationship between life anddeath. There can be no life without death, or vice versa, forⲡⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲛ ⲙ̄ⲛⲡⲕⲁⲕⲉ ⲡⲱⲛϩ ⲙ̄ⲛⲡⲙⲟⲩ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲛⲁⲙ ⲙ̄ⲛ̄ⲛϩⲃⲟⲩⲣ̄ⲛⲥⲛⲏⲩ ⲛⲉ̄ⲛⲛⲟⲩⲉⲣⲏⲩⲙ̄ⲛϭⲟⲙ̄ⲛⲥⲉⲡⲱⲣϫⲁⲛⲟⲩⲉⲣⲏⲩlight and darkness, life and death, right and left, they are brothers of oneanother.

What wehave here is a conceptual integration network created from three pairsof opposites. It goes for each of these conceptual pairs that their con-stituents are impossible to separate form each other, since none of theseconcepts can exist meaningfully apart from the contrast supplied by theexistenceofthe other.Theyareallrelative, notabsoluteconcepts.241Gos.Phil. subverts the polar opposition of these conceptual pairs, however,bymetaphorically likeningtherelationswithsiblingship.Bylikeningthelife-deathandlight-darknesspairswiththatbetweenbrothers,theequal-ity between the opposites is highlighted and the connections betweenthemarestrenghtened.Indoingso,however,thetractatealsocontributestodestabilisetheusualhierarchical,good-badvaluationsoftherelation-ships.

We saw in thediscussion above that the taking of Adam’s soul, based on Gen :–,is understood byGos. Phil. as the taking of his life. In accordance withthis understanding of the event,Gos.

It is clear that the text cannot mean whatonewouldperhapsexpect,namelythatitshouldrefertoAdamreceivingEve again.

Isenberg translates the Coptictextquitefreelyas,“Ifheentersagainandattainshisformerself,deathwill be no more,” understanding “he” as Adam, and the “it” as Adam’s“former self.”248I think, however, the actor is here better understood notas Adam himself, but as Christ, the second Adam. If so, it follows thatwecannotunderstandwhathereceivesas“hisformerself,”butratheras something else. In the lines just prior to the one quoted here, we hearthat death (ⲡⲙⲟⲩ) came into being, and thus it seems probable that whatChrist as the secondAdam receives for himself in order to abolish deathis in fact death itself.249So, to paraphrase the passage I would suggestthe following: “Again, when Christ enters and receives death for himself,nodeathwilltakeplace.”Now,howdoesChrist“receivedeathforhim-self,”andwhatisitthatheentersasthesecondAdaminordertodoso? We shall return to these questions in more detail below, but first wemust consider some closely related aspects of the origins and remediesof death.In bothExeg. SoulandGos. Phil. the fall is linked to the primordialseparation of Gen :–. It is therefore not surprising that also inGos. Phil., as inExeg. Soul, salvation is related to the rectification of thisprimordial error, and that it is the return to the original paradisal statethat will ultimately lead to salvation. So, Christ comes to remove death,but that is not all. He also comes to unite and to give life:247Cf. Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ; Schenke, “Das Evangelium nach Phi-lippus [],” ; Louis Painchaud, “Le Christ vainqueur de la mort dans l’EvangileselonPhilippe:Uneexégèsevalentinienne deMatt.:,”NovT:(): .Grant’stranslation, “Again, when they reunite and he receives her to himself, death will be nomore” (Grant, “Mysteryof Marriage,” ), presupposesa different reconstruction of theCoptic text.248Layton and Isenberg, “Gospel According to Philip,” .249This is also the view of Painchaud, “Le Christ,” ."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipⲇⲓⲁ ⲧⲟⲩⲧⲟ ⲁⲡⲉⲭ̄ⲣ̄ⲥ ⲉⲓ ϫⲉⲕⲁⲁⲥ ⲡⲡⲱⲣϫ̄ⲛⲧⲁϩϣⲱⲡⲉ ϫⲓⲛϣⲟⲣⲡ ⲉϥⲛⲁⲥⲉϩⲱϥⲉⲣⲁⲧϥ ⲡⲁⲗⲓⲛ̄ⲛϥϩⲟⲧⲣⲟⲩ̄ⲙⲡⲥⲛⲁⲩ ⲁⲩⲱ ⲛⲉⲛⲧⲁϩⲙⲟⲩ ϩ̄ⲙⲡⲡⲱⲣϫ ⲉϥⲛⲁϯ ⲛⲁⲩ̄ⲛⲛⲟⲩⲱⲛϩ̄ⲛϥϩⲟⲧⲣⲟⲩTherefore Christ came so that the separation that happened in the begin-ningmightberectified.Againhewilljointhembothtogether,andtothosewho have died in the separation he will give life, and he will join them.(Gos.

Phil. in this passage combines the rectification of the two adverseeffects of the primordial separation, namely the separation which wasinterpreted as a taking of life, and the giving of new life which was reallydeath.We thus see that there are three main interlinked aspects to Christ’ssalvific actions that are directly related to what we have discussed above.Heremoves death, hegives life,and hereunitestheseparated.Gos.Phil.’sviews on how Christ accomplishes this, and what this implies for thetractate’s sacramental soteriology, will be discussed in detail below. Atthis pointitshouldsufficetosay that inGos.Phil.,asinExeg.Soul,deathis linked to separation and life to unification.250Still,Gos. Phil. does not content itself with the abovementioned ac-counts of the origin of death. In addition to the separation narrated inGenesis ,thetractatealsoutilisestheGenesis storyoftheeating fromtheTreeofKnowledge.Gos. Phil. here sets the stage by emphasisingthe existence of two trees in paradise,251theTreeofKnowledgeandthe Tree of Life, and by stressing the important differences betweenthem.Gos.Phil. has this to say concerningthe Tree of Knowledge (ⲡϣⲏⲛ̄ⲛⲧⲅⲛⲱⲥⲓⲥ):ⲡⲉⲧ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲩⲁϥⲙⲟⲩⲧⲁⲇⲁⲙⲡⲉⲉⲓⲙⲁⲇⲉⲡϣⲏⲛ̄ⲛⲧⲅⲛⲱⲥⲓⲥⲁϥⲧ̄ⲛϩⲉⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉⲡⲛⲟⲙⲟⲥⲛⲉⲡϣⲏⲛ ⲡⲉ ⲟⲩ̄ⲛϭⲟⲙ̄ⲙⲙⲟϥ̄ⲛϥϯ ⲧⲅⲛⲱⲥⲓⲥ̄ⲙⲡⲡⲉⲧⲛⲁⲛⲟⲩϥ ⲙ̄ⲛⲡⲉⲑⲟⲟⲩ ⲟⲩⲧⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲉϥⲗⲁϭⲉⲉⲣⲟϥϩ̄ⲙⲡⲡⲉⲑⲟⲟⲩⲟⲩⲧⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲉϥⲕⲁⲁϥϩ̄ⲙⲡⲡⲉⲧⲛⲁⲛⲟⲩϥⲁⲗⲗⲁⲁϥⲧⲁⲙⲓⲟ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲙⲟⲩ̄ⲛⲛⲉⲛⲧⲁϩⲟⲩⲱⲙ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲛϩⲏⲧϥ ϩ̄ⲙⲡⲧⲣⲉϥϫⲟⲟⲥ ⲅⲁⲣ ϫⲉⲟⲩⲱⲙ ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲙ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲱⲙⲡⲁⲉⲓⲁϥϣⲱⲡⲉ̄ⲛⲁⲣⲭⲏ̄ⲙⲡⲙⲟⲩ250Cf.

It could give knowledge of good and evil. It neitherremoved him from evil, nor did it place him in the good, but it createddeath for those who ate from it. For when he said, “eat this, do not eatthat,”252it became the beginning of death.(Gos. Phil. .–)At first sightGos.Phil.hereseemstocontradictitselfwhenitassertsthatthe Tree of Knowledge brought death to Adam in paradise, but life here.That the Tree of Knowledge killed Adam fits in well with the tractate’sinterpretationofwhattranspiredintheGardenofEden,sincetheeatingfrom the tree caused Adam’s expulsion from paradise and his receptionof mortality, as we saw above. Before the tractate goes on to explainthat “the law” (ⲡⲛⲟⲙⲟⲥ) was the tree, and that this law brought death,however,Gos. Phil. pauses to refer to the lifegiving effects of the Tree ofKnowledge “here.” It thus seems like we are here in a sense dealing withtwotreesofknowledge.253Thefirst,whichislateridentifiedwiththelaw,is the traditional Tree of Knowledge from the Genesis account. This partof the passage is unproblematic. For the identification of the other tree,however, we may want to take into account howGos. Phil.hereplaysonseveral Pauline passages, first andforemost centred onGal :and Phil:– (see fig. ).The Gal : input, where Paul states that Christ has bought “us” freefrom the curse of the law through his crucifixion, is connected to theGos.Phil.inputbyitsdiscourseonthelaw,causingcounterpartmappingsbetween the two mental spaces. There are in addition counterpart map-pings between Gal :’s reference to the cross as the tree, and the Treeof Knowledge in theGos. Phil. input. At the same time, the Phil :–input,referringtotheknowledgeofChristasacounterpartandcontraryto the law, is connected to theGos. Phil.inputprimarilythroughitsref-erencestoknowledgeandthelaw.IntheblendtheTreeofKnowledgeis connected both to the law as a bringer of death, and to the cross as abringer of life.

In the blend, however, it becomes evident thatthere are two different but related trees of knowledge. By understatingthis implication in the text,Gos. Phil. manages to keep the two treesof knowledge at the same time both separate and intimately connected,which nicely suits its overall rhetorical strategy.255Together these conceptual and intertextual blends lead to the emerg-ing entailments that not only is the old Tree of Knowledge the law andthe newonethecross,butalso the implication that tofollow the law, i.e.,Judaism, as exemplified by its dietary restrictions, equals Adam’s eatingof the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge in the garden of Eden, and canonly lead to death. Eating from the new Tree of Knowledge, on the otherhand,bringslife.SincethenewTreeofKnowledgeisthecross,andwhathung on it as its “fruit” was Christ, it is Christ’s death on the cross, andthe eating of Christ that brings life. Moreover, since the eating is in thispassage connected both to knowledge and to eating, we also have here apossiblesimultaneousreferencetogainingknowledgeofChristandpar-ticipating in the Eucharist. Another implication is that the new Tree ofKnowledge,thecross,alsoreplacestheoldTreeofKnowledge,makingthelaw,andhenceJudaism,obsoleteandbringslifeinplaceofdeath(seefig. ). In this way the new tree replaces the old, the new knowledgereplaces the old, the new death-which-brings-life replaces the old death,and consequently Christianity replaces Judaism.Theconceptualandintertextual blendsshownhereonly represent thetip of the iceberg, however, since the recollection of Gal : in this con-text also primes the rest of Paul’s discussion of the law in Galatians, andPhil :– likewise primes the broader discussion in Phil  concern-ingdeath andresurrection,forpossible subsequentrecall.Moreover,theintegrationnetworkshowninfig.mayfurthertriggerpassageslikeCol:–, Eph :, and several passages in Romans (e.g., :; :; :–).256Infact,eachoneoftheimplications wehave seenarisingfromthe255Schenke wonders why the text does not simply state something like “DortbefindetsichjenerBaum der Erkenntnis,derAdam getötet hat.Hieraber befindet sichdieserBaumderErkenntnis,derdenMenschenlebendiggemachthat”(Schenke,DasPhilippus-Evangelium, ). However, while such a statement would certainly have been clearer, itwould not have acchieved the same rhetorical effects as the actual manuscript reading.Buckley,forherpart,holdsthat“wecanpostulateonetree,actingincontrastingways....Depending on the status of the eater, the one tree may deal death or life” (Buckley,“Conceptual Models,” –).256Cf.Janssens,“L’ÉvangileselonPhilippe,”;Evans,etal.,NagHammadiTexts,."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"chapter fourblending processes discussed here have the potential to activate furthermentalinputspaces,thepossiblecumulativeeffectsofwhicharedifficultto assess.....The CrucifixionWe have now seen a glimpse of the importance attached to the cross andthe crucifixion in the rhetoric ofGos. Phil. In the present section we willlook closer at the tractate’s interpretation of this event. We have seen thatGos. Phil. identifies the cross with the new Tree of Knowledge, but thisis not the only tree that is blended conceptually with the cross in thistext. Other connections are also drawn between the events in Eden andthe crucifixion, with vital implications for the underlying sacramentalsoteriology. In a creative blendGos. Phil. connects the crucifixion withboth the paradise account in Genesis and Jesus’ earthly father Joseph:ⲫⲓⲗⲓⲡⲡⲟⲥ ⲡⲁⲡⲟⲥⲧⲟⲗⲟⲥ ⲡⲉϫⲁϥ ϫⲉ ̈ⲓⲱⲥⲏⲫ ⲡϩⲁⲙϣⲉ ⲁϥⲧⲱϭⲉ̄ⲛⲛⲟⲩⲡⲁⲣⲁⲇⲉⲓⲥⲟⲥϫⲉⲛⲉϥ̄ⲣⲭⲣⲉⲓⲁ̄ⲛϩ̄ⲛϣⲉⲉϩⲟⲩⲛⲉⲧⲉϥⲧⲉⲭⲛⲏ̄ⲛⲧⲟϥⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϩⲧⲁⲙⲓⲟ̄ⲙⲡⲥⲧⲁⲩⲣⲟⲥⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛ̄ⲛϣⲏⲛ̄ⲛⲧⲁϥⲧⲟϭⲟⲩ ⲁⲩⲱ ⲡⲉϥϭⲣⲟϭ ⲛⲉϥⲟϣⲉ ⲁⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϥⲧⲟϭϥ ⲛⲉⲡⲉϥϭⲣⲟϭ ⲡⲉⲓ̄ⲏ̄ⲥⲡⲧⲱϭⲉⲇⲉⲡⲉⲡⲉⲥⳁⲟⲥⲁⲗⲗⲁⲡϣⲏⲛ̄ⲙⲡⲱⲛϩϩ̄ⲛⲧⲙⲏⲧⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲡⲁⲣⲁⲇⲉⲓⲥⲟⲥⲁⲩⲱⲧⲃⲉ̄ⲛϫⲟⲉⲓⲧ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲡⲉⲭⲣⲉⲓⲥⲙⲁϣⲱⲡⲉⲉⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲛϩⲏⲧ̄ⲥⲉⲃⲟⲗϩⲓⲧⲟⲟⲧϥⲁⲧⲁⲛⲁⲥⲧⲁⲥⲓⲥPhilip the apostle said, “Joseph the carpenter planted a garden because heneededwoodforhistrade.Itwashewhomadethecrossfromthetreesthathe planted, and his seed hung upon that which he planted. His seed wasJesus,257andtheplantwasthecross.”ButtheTreeofLifeisinthemiddleofthe garden,258and it is from the olive tree that the chrism came, and fromit (i.e., the chrism) the resurrection.(Gos. Phil. .–)In this interesting passage,Gos. Phil. sets up a blend between the garden(ⲡⲡⲁⲣⲁⲇⲉⲓⲥⲟⲥ) planted by Joseph and the garden of Eden.259At the sametime Joseph’s vocation as a carpenter is utilised to connect him to themaking of the cross and thereby also to link the cross to the Tree ofLife. Moreover, by describing Joseph’s “seed” as hanging “on that whichhe planted,”260the text also makes a pun on the multiple meanings of257Cf. Gal : where Christ is described as “the seed” (σπ\u001aρμα)ofAbraham.258Cf. Gen :; :; Rev :.259Cf. Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, .260From the point of view of a “Valentinian” reading ofGos. Phil., Thomassen holdsJoseph to represent the “Valentinian” Demiurge, the garden to represent the cosmos,the cross to represent matter, and Jesus hanging on the tree to represent his birth in amaterial body (see Thomassen, “How Valentinian,” –; Thomassen,The SpiritualSeed,).TheconnectionbetweencrucifixionandincarnationisalsomadebyCatherine"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philip“seed” (ϭⲣⲟϭ), denoting both the “seed” of plants, human “sperm,” and“offspring”261(see fig. ).This is a crucial blend in the overall rhetoric ofGos. Phil.Mostsignif-icantly, by blending the two gardens and identifying the cross with theTree of Life, Jesus is implicitly identified as the fruit of this tree. In Gen-esis, eating from the Tree of Life is said to bestow eternal life.262Jesus, asthefruitoftheTreeofLife,bringslifebydying,thusreversingthemean-ing of life and death, and at the same time reversing the effects of theopposing(old)TreeofKnowledge.TocountertheeffectsoftheprimevaleatingfromtheTreeofKnowledgeinparadise,whatisneededisthefruitof the Tree of Life, i.e., Christ, and his “death” on the cross (the Tree ofLife)wasnotreallydeath,foritbroughtlife(seefig.).263Gos. Phil. makes clear the sacramental entailments of this passage,firstly by connecting the cross with the Tree of Life and its fruit withChrist, thus indicating the Eucharist, and secondly by associating thechrism with this tree. There is thus a simultaneous connection fromthe Tree of Life/cross to both the chrismation and the Eucharist. Asfor the latter, it is clear from the blend that partaking of Christ in theEucharist brings life, and that this eucharistic effect is intimately con-nectedwithChrist’slife-givingdeathonthecross.Moreover,byconnect-ing the chrism to the Tree of Life/cross and to the resurrection, the life-giving qualities of the chrism are also directly connected to Christ andthe cross (see fig. ).264Interestingly, it becomes clear from this analysis that inGos. Phil.thetwo trees from the Genesis account are blended in, and with, the cru-cifixion, and, by metonymical extension, with Christianity, as the crossbecomes simultaneously the Tree of Life and a new Tree of Knowledge(see fig. ). Crucifixion, then, is the crucial event where death is con-nectedwithlifeandthedifferencesbetweenthetwoaresubverted.TheseeffectsshouldbeseeninconnectionwiththestatementsdiscussedaboveconcerningGos.

The passage makes good sense asit is, however, and there is in my view not sufficient justification for making such anemendation.Cf.Painchaud,“LeChrist,”–,esp.,whoarguesstronglyinfavourof reading the text as it is.273Cf. Painchaud, “Le Christ,” ; Tuckett, “Synoptic Traditions,” . Unfortunatelythe following lines in the manuscript are heavily damaged, so we must acknowledge theuncertainty caused by the loss of the possible continuation of the argument. Schenke hasproposed reconstructions for most of these lines (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium,), but due to the highly speculative nature of such a reconstruction, I have chosen todisregard this heavily damaged part of the text (cf. Giversen,Filipsevangeliet,n.).274This separation of the divinity from the humanity is also argued by Ambrose,who states that “it was the man who cried out as he was about to die by separationfrom the divinity” (Exposition of the Gospel of Luke.; translation quoted fromJaroslavPelikan,TheEmergenceoftheCatholicTradition(–)[vol.ofTheChristianTradition:AHistoryoftheDevelopmentofDoctrine;Chicago:UniversityofChicagoPress,], ), and Theodore of Mopsuestia is reported to have held similar views (seePelikan,Emergence of the Catholic Tradition, ).

It is, aswe have seen several examples of already, a pervasive rhetorical practiceofGos. Phil. to set up several parallels to important events in the life ofChrist, and we shall see that this particular blend, of the rending of theveil and the division of Christ, has important ramifications with regardto both the Christology and the soteriology of the tractate.

If we choose to read this passage as an allegoryof the eschaton, which is suggested by the imagery of the flood and thedestruction of the temple, we get a blend where “this house” (ⲡⲉⲉⲓⲏⲉⲓ),i.e., the temple, may be mapped onto the material world. It is thus thedestructionofthisworldthatisprefiguredinthiswaybyChrist’sdeathonthe cross. As the metaphorical veil is torn and the secrets of the materialworld are laid bare, the world will be destroyed. The rather oblique term“the entire divinity” (ⲧ̄ⲙ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲧⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉⲧⲏ̄ⲣ̄ⲥ) should in this context probablybeunderstood,asSchenkehassuggested,asdenoting“alltherighteous,”readinḡⲙ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲧⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉas the equivalent ofε\"σ\u001aGειαand not as\u0019ει\u001fτης.283“The priestly tribe” (ⲧⲫⲩⲗⲏ̄ⲛⲧ̄ⲙ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲧⲟⲩⲏⲏⲃ), on the other hand, maybe understood as a reference to the Christians.284When the materialworld is destroyed, the Christians, as “the priestly tribe,” may thus enterheaven within the veil together with Christ “the high priest.” While allthe Christians will be saved and enter heaven, all the righteous non-Christianswillattaintoakindofsecondarysalvation.Theymaynotenterinside the veil with the high priest, by they will be able to seek refugeunder the arms of the cross, like chickens taking cover under the wingsof a hen, as is clear from the allusions to Matt :–/Luke :–.They will not be able to “mix” (ⲧⲱϩ)with“theunmixedlight”(ⲡⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲛ̄ⲛⲁⲧⲧⲱϩ). This privilege is reserved for those who have become perfectlight,namelytheChristians.For,aswelearnelsewhereinthetractate,inorder to mix with the light one must become light.285Shifting its metaphors in accordance with the temple imagery and283See Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, –. In the context of the crucifixionwe might have expectedⲧ̄ⲙ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲧⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉto refer to the divinity of Christ separated from hismaterial body. The use of the term in this sense is attested by Shenoute (see Shenoute,IAmAmazed, ), but it does not make sense inGos. Phil. that the divinity of Christwould not be able to enter “the holies of the holies” or that it would be unable to “mixwith the unmixed light.” It has been argued thatⲧ̄ⲙ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲧⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉⲧⲏ̄ⲣ̄ⲥshould here be takenas a reference to the Valentinian demiurge (see, e.g., Schenke, “Das Evangelium nachPhilippus [],” ; Schenke, “Das Evangelium nach Philippus [],” ; Schenke,“TheGospelofPhilip,”).AsSchenkerightlynotesinhiscriticaledition,however,“DieeinfacheDeutungaufdieGestaltdesvalentinianischenDemiurgengehtjedenfalls(schonwegen desAugensⲧⲏ̄ⲣ̄ⲥ)nichtauf”(Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium,  n. ).Thomassen sees a referrence to “a special kind of salvation” for “the psychic powers,”although he admits that “Gos.

Phil.’s playful inversion of the concepts of life and death. By givingdeath a positive valuation, making it dependent on resurrection, andmaking it equal salvation, the tractate gives another statement of theimportant point it emphasises elsewhere, namely the deceptive natureof names and concepts in the world, and the close relation between suchdichotomic conceptual pairs as life and death. The text then goes on toconfound our expectations, however, by suddenly using the concept ofdeath with its usual commonsense meaning, emphatically stating thatone who does not receive the resurrection while being alive will surelydie.294Theconceptofdeath isherecertainlynotusedinapositive sense.291Thescribehasleftthisgapempty,probablyduetodamagetothesourcemanuscript(cf.

Onthe one hand it connects the crucifixion directly to the resurrection, andon the other it specifies the chrismation as a ritual bestowing it.

First,weshouldprobablyseethepolemicagainstthosewhobelievethatChristdiedfirstandthenroseinconnectionwithalaterpassagedirectedagainstan erroneous interpretation of baptism:̄ⲛⲑⲉ̄ⲛⲧⲁ̄ⲓ̄ⲥϫⲱⲕⲉⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲙⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩ̄ⲙⲡⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁⲧⲁⲉⲓⲧⲉⲑⲉⲁϥⲡⲱϩⲧⲉⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲙⲡⲙⲟⲩⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓⲧ̄ⲛⲃⲏⲕⲙⲉⲛⲉⲡⲓⲧ̄ⲛⲉⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩⲧ̄ⲛⲃⲏⲕⲇⲉⲁⲛⲉⲡⲓⲧ̄ⲛⲉⲡⲙⲟⲩϣⲓⲛⲁϫⲉⲛⲟⲩⲡⲁϩⲧ̄ⲛ296ⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲙⲡⲡ̄ⲛ̄ⲁ̄ⲙⲡⲕⲟⲥⲙⲟⲥAs Jesus perfected the water of baptism,thus he poured out death.Therefore we go down into the water,but we do not go down into death,so that we may not be poured out in the spirit of the world.(Gos. Phil. .–)It has been argued that this passage is directed against those who, fol-lowing Romans , regard baptism in terms of death and resurrection.297However, while this passage is certainly directed against the view thatbaptismal immersion is a descent into death, there is nothing in the pas-sagethatspeaksagainstaninterpretationofbaptismintermsofresurrec-tion.298On the contrary,Gos. Phil.’s emphasis on the necessity of acquir-ing the resurrection prior to death indicates that resurrection is some-thing that must be experienced and/or gained ritually. The statementthat in baptism “we do not go down into death” is in accordance withthe claim that one is not supposed to die first, before acquiring the res-urrection.ButdoesGos. Phil.interpretbaptism interms ofexperiencingor acquiring resurrection?296There might be a wordplay here that carries the transition from the passage onpouring to that on blowing.297See,e.g.,MajellaFranzmann,“ACompleteHistoryofEarlyChristianity:Takingthe‘Heretics’ Seriously,”JRH: (): .298Cf. Pagels, “Ritual,” ."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"chapter fourAs we have seen, baptism is certainly interpreted in life-giving terms.It is interesting to note also howGos. Phil.inthepassagejustquotedweaves together differentaspects ofJesus’ baptism byway ofapun.Jesusis described as having “perfected,”ϫⲱⲕⲉⲃⲟⲗ,thebaptismalwaters,299aphrase which may mean perfected or completed, but which also carriesconnotationsoffilling.300Especiallyinthiscontext,involvingtheelementofwater,thismeaningofthewordϫⲱⲕisrelevantandeasilyprimedandbrought to mind. This meaning is moreover prone to be activated whenseeninconnectionwiththefollowingverbthetextusestodescribeJesus,namely that he “poured out,”ⲡⲱϩⲧⲉⲃⲟⲗ,death.Thereisalsoatthesametime a pun on the Coptic wordsⲙⲟⲟⲩandⲙⲟⲩ, meaning “water” and“death”respectively.301Thus,bypredicatingofJesussimultaneouslyϫⲱⲕⲉⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲙⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩandⲡⲱϩⲧⲉⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲙⲡⲙⲟⲩat his baptism, a neat and effectiveparallel is created between Jesus filling the baptismal water with life andemptying it of death.302Yet againGos. Phil. closely links life and death299For the idea of the importance of ritually perfecting the baptismal waters, seeTheophilus,Letter to Horsiesius, –; Lundhaug, “Baptism.”300SeeCrum–.Theconnotations of“filling”havebeenmadeexplicitinSchen-ke’s later translations: “As Jesus filled the water of baptism (with Spirit), so he emptiedoutdeath”(Schenke,“TheGospelofPhilip,”);“WieJesusdasWasserderTaufeerfüllthat, so hat er es vom Tod entleert” (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ; Schenke,“Das Evangelium nach Philippus [NHC II,],” ). This stands in contrast to his earliertranslation, “Wie Jesus das Wasser der Taufe vollendet hat, so goß er den Tod aus”(Schenke, “Das Evangelium nach Philippus [],” ; Schenke, “Das Evangelium nachPhilippus [],” ).301The wordplay and rhetoric of this passage work exceedingly well in Coptic with itsjuxtaposition ofϫⲱⲕⲉⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲙⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩandⲡⲱϩⲧⲉⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲙⲡⲙⲟⲩ. Schenke has argued that theⲙⲟⲟⲩvs.ⲙⲟⲩwordplay may indicate a Coptic original for this passage (Schenke, “DasEvangelium nach Philippus [],” ). Against this it has been argued that the similar-ity between the two words in Coptic is simply a coincidence, and that the association ofbaptism with death goes back to the New Testament and esp. Romans  (see JohannesB. Bauer, “Zum Philippus-Evangelium Spr.  und ,”TLZ: []: ; Wilson,The Gospel of Philip, ; cf. also Giversen,Filipsevangeliet, ). But these objections donot take into consideration the fact that even though the argument of the passage mayultimately be derived from the Greek of the New Testament, it certainly works even bet-ter rhetorically in Coptic. Nor do these objections take into account the Coptic word-play onϫⲱⲕ ⲉⲃⲟⲗandⲡⲱϩⲧ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ. Schenke subsequently changed his mind, however,and no longer argued in favour of a Coptic original for this passage, suggesting eitherτελει\u0012\u0016ν/κεν\u0012\u0016νorπληρ\u0012\u0016ν/\u0002κ\u0010ε&νastheGreekVorlageforϫⲱⲕⲉⲃⲟⲗ/ⲡⲱϩⲧⲉⲃⲟⲗ(seeSchenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium,).Thissuggestionshowsquiteclearlytherhetor-ical superiority of the Coptic reading in relation to the proposed Greek original. Never-theless, Johannes Bauer is of course right to note that “auch Übersetzer bilden mitunterWortspiele”(Bauer,“ZumPhilippus-Evangelium,”;cf.alsoGiversen,Filipsevangeliet,).302Cf. Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipin a manner that is rhetorically highly effective. The wordplay creates aseemingly intuitive link between the two and makes the mystagogicalclaims that are made concerning baptism seem logical and intuitivelypersuasive.In this context we recallGos. Phil. .–, discussed above, whereChrist is described as entering and receiving death for himself and thusabolishing the death which came into being from the separation of Evefrom Adam, thus recalling not only Christ’s crucifixion, as we havealready suggested, but also his emptying the baptismal waters of death.In this wayGos. Phil. cleverly sets up a simultaneous reference to eventsnarrated in Scripture as well as to sacramental (re)enactment. On theone hand, Christ entered the world, acquired death by crucifixion, andbecamethefruitoftheTreeofLife,butontheotherhandhealsoentered the baptismal waters of the Jordan and emptied the waters ofdeath, simultaneously filling them with life.303Gos. Phil.therebyalsomakes baptism parallel the Eucharist as a life-giving sacrament, theformer being linked primarily to Christ’s baptism and the second to hiscrucifixion.Now, let us return to the issue of the resurrection. As we have seen,the text seems to presuppose the necessity of attaining the resurrec-tion prior to death, that is, the necessity of attaining it ritually. We haveseen above that the reception of resurrection is closely related to chris-mation, and chrismation to baptism. We may therefore draw the con-clusionthatonemayreceivetheresurrectioninabaptismalchrisma-tion. In terms of ritual enactment it would seem most probable thatbaptismal immersion immediately preceded chrismation, in such a waythat chrismation and the act of arising from the baptismal waters areinterpreted together in terms of resurrection. Thus one is resurrectedritually in the baptismal chrismation in order not to die at the end oflife.The necessity of arising before death is also emphasised elsewhere inthe tractate, with clear sacramental overtones:ⲛⲉⲧ ̇ϫⲱ ̇̄ⲙⲙⲟⲥϫⲉⲥⲉⲛⲁⲙⲟⲩ̄ⲛϣⲟⲣⲡⲁⲩⲱⲥⲉ ̇ⲛ ̇ⲁ ̇ⲧⲱⲟⲩⲛ[[̄ⲛ]]ⲥⲉ̄ⲣⲡⲗⲁⲛⲁⲥⲑⲉⲉⲩⲧ̄ⲙϫⲓ̄ⲛϣⲟⲣⲡ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲛⲁⲥⲧⲁⲥⲓⲥ ⲉⲩⲟⲛϩ ⲉⲩϣⲁⲙⲟⲩ ⲥⲉⲛⲁϫⲓⲗⲁⲁⲩ ⲁⲛ ⲧⲁⲉⲓ ⲧⲉ ⲑⲉ ⲟⲛⲉⲩϫⲱ̄ⲙⲙⲟⲥⲉⲡⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁⲉⲩϫⲱ̄ⲙⲙⲟⲥϫⲉⲟⲩⲛⲟϭⲡⲉⲡⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁϫⲉⲉⲩϣⲁϫⲓⲧϥⲥⲉⲛⲁⲱⲛϩ303Significantly, the baptismal water is also referred to asⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩ ⲉⲧⲟⲛϩ,“thelivingwater,” atGos.

Phil. .–)In the same way as those who say that Christ died before he arose arewrong, those who hold that they shall die first and then be resurrectedarelikewisewrong.Interestingly,Gos. Phil. connects this error to thatof believing baptism to be a sufficient criterion for salvation, or perhapsthe error is simply the belief that it is the baptismal water in itself thatconstitutes resurrection? In any case, it seemsGos. Phil. is arguing forthe fundamental importance of the anointing with chrism in additionto baptism in water, against those implied opponents who do not shareGos. Phil.’s interpretation of the chrismation as resurrection. But doesGos. Phil.’s emphasis on the chrismation necessarily imply that baptismis unimportant? This does not seem to be the case. On the contrary,baptism seems to be regarded as an important ritual of cleansing whichis necessary in conjunction with chrismation.304Gos. Phil.’s argument is held together by the blend the christian isa christ, which emphasises the parallelism between the Christ eventand the life of the individual Christian. Importantly, the blend is, as wehave seen, a double-scope one, with inferences projected backwards toboth inputs. In this case, when it comes to the chrismation and resur-rection, since Christ prefigured what is to happen sacramentally to eachindividual Christian,305and each individual Christian passes through achrismation that is interpreted as bringing about a resurrection, it mayalsoberegardedasimportantthatChristfollowedthesamesequenceinhis prefiguration as the Christians do ritually in the sacraments.Scriptural support for this view of Christ’s resurrection before death,maybefoundinthesamepassageinRomansthatweidentifiedearlierasapossibleintertextwithregardtoGos.Phil.’stheologyofthedualbirthofChrist,namelyRom:–.WesawthatinRom:PaulreferstoChristasbeing“designatedSonofGodinpoweraccordingtotheSpiritofholiness304I do not think, then, that there are any grounds for claiming, with Wilson, that thispassage implies “a certain disparagement of Baptism” (Wilson,The Gospel of Philip, ,) or that it should be understood as “a piece of polemic against the beliefs of the‘orthodox’ Church” (Wilson,The Gospel of Philip, ). For the view that this passagedoes not involve a denigration of baptism, see also Isenberg, “Coptic Gospel,”  n. .305ThisisoneofthepossibleinterpretationsofGos. Phil. .–.

Phil. also argues for the importance of receiving the Holy Spiritin order to be resurrected, using a simile describing the making of glassand pottery:̄ⲛⲥⲕⲉⲩⲟⲥ̄ⲛⲛⲁⲃⲁϭⲏⲉⲓⲛ ⲙ̄ⲛ̄ⲛⲥⲕⲉⲩⲟⲥ̄ⲃⲃⲗϫⲉ ϣⲁⲩϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ϩⲓⲧ̄ⲙⲡⲕⲱϩⲧ ⲁⲗⲗⲁ̄ⲛⲥⲕⲉⲩⲟⲥ̄ⲛⲛⲁⲃⲁϭⲏⲉⲓⲛⲉⲩϣⲁⲟⲩⲱϭⲡⲡⲁⲗⲓⲛϣⲁⲩⲧⲁⲙⲓⲟⲟⲩ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲩϣⲱⲡⲉⲅⲁⲣⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛⲟⲩ̄ⲡ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲁ̄ⲛⲥⲕⲉⲩⲟⲥ ⲇⲉ̄ⲃⲃ̄ⲗϫⲉ ⲉⲩϣⲁⲟⲩⲱϭⲡ ϣⲁⲩⲧⲁⲕⲟ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲩϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲅⲁⲣ ⲭⲱⲣⲓⲥⲛⲓϥⲉGlass vessels and pottery vessels come into being by means of fire, but ifglassvesselsarebrokentheyareremade,fortheycameintobeingbymeansof a breath (̄ⲡ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲁ),whereasifpotteryvesselsarebrokentheyaredestroyed,for they came into being without breath (ⲛⲓϥⲉ). (Gos. Phil. .–)As W.C. van Unnik has rightly pointed out, the difference between thepottery vessels and the glass vessels only becomes clear once the vesselsare broken. Therefore, van Unnik argues, the breaking of the vesselsprobably signifies death, and the difference highlighted in the simileis between those who have been created by means of breath, who willsurvivedeath,andthosewhohavenotbeenmadewithbreath,whowill not survive death.306This then seems to be an argument regardingthe requirements for resurrection.307If we regard ritual initiation as thetargetinputofthesimile,itseemsclearthattheglassvessels,peoplewhohave come into being by means of “breath” (̄ⲡ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲁ/ⲛⲓϥⲉ), i.e., those whohave received the Holy Spirit, are the Christians, while the others, thepottery vessels who did not receive the spirit, are the non-Christians.The Christians, then, who have been made Christians by their receptionof the Holy Spirit by means of the chrism, will be resurrected, while theothers,asforinstancetheJews, willnot.Thesimilaritiesintheprocessesdescribedinthesimile,wheretheonlydifferencebetweenthemakingofthevesselsofpotteryandthoseofglassistheadditionofthespiritinthelatter, recallsGos.

Phil.singlesoutthe“gentile”(ϩⲉⲑⲛⲓⲕⲟⲥ)asone who has never lived, and thus cannot die the proper death of theChristian:ⲟⲩϩⲉⲑⲛⲓⲕⲟⲥ̄ⲣⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲙⲁϥⲙⲟⲩ̄ⲙⲡⲉϥⲱⲛϩ ⲅⲁⲣ ⲉⲛⲉϩ ϩⲓⲛⲁ ⲉϥⲛⲁⲙⲟⲩ ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϩⲡⲓⲥ-ⲧⲉⲩⲉⲉⲧⲙⲉⲁϥⲱⲛϩⲁⲩⲱⲡⲁ ̈ⲓϥϭ̄ⲛⲇⲩⲛⲉⲩⲉⲉⲙⲟⲩϥⲟⲛϩⲅⲁⲣϫⲓ̄ⲙⲡϩⲟⲟⲩ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲡ̄ⲭ̄ⲥⲉⲓA gentile man does not die, for he has never lived so that he may die.

Phil. .–)“Death” in this sense is reserved for those who have been made alivethrough Christ, i.e., the Christians. If one has not received life ritually,then, one has not lived and therefore cannot die.In summary,Gos. Phil. shows the necessity of becoming Christian,and of passing through the required initiation rites including the vitalchrismation, in order to be able to arise after death rather than simplyremain dead. AsGos. Phil. presents the issue, neither the Jews nor thegentiles satisfy these criteria......

No Logos can riseindependently of the flesh—itisthe flesh.

This comparison, however,promptsthequestionofthenatureandidentityoftheheavenlygarments.The significance of the comparison becomes clear when we, in light ofsomeofthepassagesdiscussedabove,identifythegarmentsinthisworldmetaphoricallywiththematerialbodyandthegarmentsinthekingdomofheavenwiththebodyofChrist,inthepost-initiatoryandpostmortemwearing of the “perfect man.” It thus seems thatGos.

We thus seem to have yet another indication thatthechrismationpresupposedbyGos.Phil.wasclosely connectedtobap-tism, rather than a completely separate ritual.We saw above thatGos. Phil. elsewhere connects apostolic successionthrough ritual initiation specifically to the effects of the chrismation.Significantly, we also seem to have indications of the dyeing-metaphorbeing connected to succession when we connect the passage concerningGodasadyer,discussedhere,withthefactthatwereadelsewhereinGos.Phil.thatⲁⲡϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ ⲃⲱⲕ ⲉϩⲟⲩ[ⲛ]ⲉⲡⲙⲁ̄ⲛϫⲱϭⲉ̄ⲛⲗⲉⲩⲉⲓ ⲁϥϥⲓϣⲃⲉⲥⲛⲟⲟⲩⲥ̄ⲛⲭⲣⲱⲙⲁⲁϥⲛⲟϫⲟⲩ ⲁⲧⲣⲟϩⲧⲉ ⲁϥ̄ⲛⲧⲟⲩ ⲉϩⲣⲁ ̈ⲓ ⲉⲩⲟⲃϣ ⲧⲏⲣⲟⲩ ⲁⲩⲱ ⲡⲉϫⲁϥ ϫⲉⲧⲁⲉⲓ ⲧⲉⲑⲉ̄ⲛⲧⲁϥⲉⲓ̄ⲙⲙⲟ ̇ⲥ̄ⲛϭⲓⲡϣⲏⲣ[[ⲉ̄ⲙⲡϣⲏⲣ]]ⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲣ ̇ⲱⲙ[ⲉⲉ] ̇ϥ[ⲟ]̄ⲛϫ ̇ϭⲓⲧthe Lord went into Levi’s place of dyeing and took seventy-two394coloursand threw them into the vat and brought them out all white, and said,“Thus the Son [[of the Son]] of Man has come [as] a dyer.”395(Gos.

We have already encountered this concept in connection withGos. Phil.’s description of the transfiguration of Christ. We saw therethat in order to make the disciples able to see him in his full gloryon the mountain, Christ made the disciples great. This was due to thefact that people could only see Christaccording to their own abilities,and thus his glory, the Logos, was hidden from view until the discipleswere themselves elevated to that level. This theme recurs in variousguises at several points throughout the tractate. In the discussion of thetransfiguration the disciples are changed in order to see, but sometimesthe causal relationship is also reversed:ⲙ̄ⲛ[[ⲟⲩ]]ϭⲟⲙ̄ⲛⲧⲉⲗⲁⲁⲩ ⲛⲁⲩ ⲁⲗⲁⲁⲩ ϩ̄ⲛⲛⲉⲧⲥⲙⲟⲛⲧ ⲉⲓⲙⲏⲧⲓ̄ⲛⲧⲉⲡⲉⲧ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲩ ϣⲱⲡⲉ̄ⲛⲑⲉ̄ⲛⲛⲉⲧ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲩ̄ⲛⲑⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲁⲛ ⲉϥϩ̄ⲙⲡⲕⲟⲥⲙⲟⲥ ϥⲛⲁⲩ ⲉⲡⲣⲏ ⲉϥⲟ̄ⲣⲣⲏ ⲁⲛ ⲁⲩⲱϥⲛⲁⲩ ⲉⲧⲡⲉ ⲙ̄ⲛⲡⲕⲁϩ ⲙ̄ⲛ̄ⲛⲕⲉϩⲃⲏⲩⲉ ⲧⲏⲣⲟⲩ ⲉⲛⲧⲟϥ ⲁⲛ ⲡⲉ ⲛⲉⲧ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲩ ⲧⲁⲉⲓ ⲧⲉⲑⲉ ϩⲣⲁ ̈ⲓϩ̄ⲛⲧⲙⲉ ⲁⲗⲗⲁ ⲁⲕⲛⲁⲩ ⲉⲗⲁⲁⲩ̄ⲛⲧⲉⲡⲙⲁ ⲉⲧ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲩ ⲁⲕϣⲱⲡⲉ̄ⲛⲛⲉⲧ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲩⲁⲕⲛⲁⲩ ⲁⲡ̄ⲡ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲁ ⲁⲕϣⲱⲡⲉ̄ⲙⲡ̄ⲛ̄ⲁⲁ ̇ⲕⲛ ̇ⲁ[ⲩⲁ]ⲡ̄ⲭ̄ⲥ ⲁⲕϣⲱⲡⲉ̄ⲛⲭ̄ⲥⲁⲕⲛⲁⲩⲁ ̇ⲡ[ⲉⲓⲱⲧⲕ]ⲛⲁϣⲱⲡⲉ̄ⲛⲉⲓⲱⲧⲇⲓⲁⲧⲟⲩⲧⲟ[̄ⲛⲛⲉⲉⲓⲙⲁ]ⲙⲉⲛⲕⲛⲁⲩⲁϩⲱⲃⲛⲓⲙⲁⲩⲱ ̇ⲕ[ⲛⲁⲩⲉⲣⲟ]ⲕⲁⲛ ⲟⲩⲁⲁⲕ ⲕⲛⲁⲩ ⲇⲉ ⲉⲣⲟⲕ̄ⲙ ̇ⲡ[ⲙⲁ ⲉⲧ̄ⲙ]ⲙⲁⲩ ⲡⲉⲧⲕⲛⲁⲩ ⲅⲁⲣ ⲉⲣⲟϥ ⲉⲕⲛⲁϣ[ⲱⲡⲉ̄ⲙⲙ]ⲟ ̇ϥIt is impossible for anyone to see any of the ordained (things) unless hebecomes like them.

Whatmay, moreover, be significant in light of the tractate’s polemics againstJudaism, is the fact that this would also be an aspect of the initiatorybaptismal ritual that distinguished it from the Jewish practice of pros-elyte baptism.406AsforJewishproselytebaptism,itwasprecededbycircumcision.Gos.Phil. does not spend much time discussing or redefining circumcision,but it does mention it once, and it does indeed redefine it:̄ⲛⲧⲉⲣⲉⲁⲃⲣⲁϩⲁⲙ[....]ⲉⲧⲣⲉϥⲛⲁⲩ ⲁⲡⲉⲧϥⲛⲁⲛⲁⲩ ⲉⲣⲟϥ[ⲁϥⲥ] ̇̄ⲃⲃⲉ̄ⲛⲧⲥⲁⲣⲝ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲕⲣⲟⲃⲩⲥⲧⲓⲁⲉϥⲧⲁ[ⲙⲟ] ̇̄ⲙⲙⲟⲛϫⲉϣϣⲉⲉⲧⲁⲕⲟ̄ⲛⲧⲥⲁⲣⲝ405As Gaffron has put it, “An einer Diskreditierung der Taufe hat das EvPh kein Inter-esse, wenn auch sein spekulatives Denken in stärkerem Maße der Salbung gilt.

Phil.’s use of the mirroring theory of seeing and becoming, namelythat one must become Christ in order to see Christ. Here in this passageone must become a bridal chamber in order to see the bridegroom andthe bride. This, then, implies the identification of “the bridal chamber”inthispassagewithChrist,butitalso,seeminglyparadoxically,identifiesthe bridegroom and the bride with Christ’s true nature. This, however,makes good sense in the overall system ofGos. Phil.ThediscipleshadtobechangedinordertoseeChristinhisgloryinthetransfiguration.Thatis, by becoming Christ they saw his true flesh, the Logos. In this passagethen, by becoming Christ as bridal chamber one may see Christ as thebridegroom and the bride. This recalls the revelation of “the great bridalchamber” (ⲡⲛⲟϭ̄ⲙⲡⲁⲥⲧⲟⲥ) and the creation of the body of Christ at hisbaptism in the Jordan,418which consisted of the unification of the Logosand the Holy Spirit. Seeing the bridegroom and the bride by becominga“bridalchamber”(ⲛⲩⲙⲫⲱⲛ) would thus involve seeing Christ as theunificationoftheLogos(hisflesh)andtheHolySpirit(hisblood).419Wemay therefore identify the bridegroomand the bridewith the Logos andtheHolySpiritrespectively(seefig.).Andwherewouldonebeabletosee the Logos and the Holy Spirit together if not in the Eucharist?

AsMcCosker puts it, “Christians hold that there is a paradigmatic ‘mixture’in the person of Christ: the mingling of human and divine natures inthe person of Christ is not only paradigmatic in an exemplary (imita-tive)sense,butalso,moreessentially,theWord’sincarnationfundamen-tally alters the recipe for such mixtures.”421Christ is thus “the recipe andingredients rolled into one,” as McCosker strikingly puts it.422420PhilipMcCosker,reviewofNormanRussell,TheDoctrineofDeificationintheGreekPatristic Tradition,ReviewsinReligionandTheology: (): .421McCosker, review of Russell, .422McCosker, review of Russell, ."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"chapter fourWehaveseenatseveralpointsintheprecedinganalysisthatquestionsconcerningthisrecipeanditsingredientsareoffundamentalimportancetoGos.

In this conceptual blend the animals representthenot-so-perfectmen,andtheperfectChristian,beingatthetopofthe metaphorical chain of being, is presented as human. If one becomes“man” (ⲣⲱⲙⲉ),then,onemaybelovedby“theman”(ⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ),Christ,and“have communion” (̄ⲣⲕⲟⲓⲛⲱⲛⲉⲓ)withtheLogosandthelight.426It is thisnecessity of becoming man, metaphorically speaking, that seems to bethe main thrust of the passage.427It is interesting to note the many different words that are here usedto denote the conceptual domain of joining, communion, and mixing.The verbsⲧⲱϩ(“mix”),̄ⲣⲕⲟⲓⲛⲱⲛⲉⲓ(“have communion”),ϩⲱⲧ̄ⲣ(“join”),̄ⲙⲧⲟⲛ(“rest”), and evenⲙⲉⲣⲓⲧ(“love”) are here employed in a parallelmanner.428Schenke holds that “love” is here the main term that allthe other terms refer to, being themselves simply “Umschreibungenbzw. Entfaltungen vonⲙⲉ.”429But do we really have any good reason toprivilege the term “love” over the other terms used here for joining andmixing?Thefirstpartofthepassage,wherethewordⲧⲱϩis used, sets425Cf. Borchert, “Literary Arrangement,” .426As Schenke rightly notes, in this passageⲣⲱⲙⲉdoes not refer to the same thingthroughoutthepassage:“InderBildhälfteistesdasirdischeWesen,dassoheißt,schlecht-hin, während in der Anwendung der Begriff ‘Mensch’ übertragen gebraucht sein dürfte;vermutlich irgendwie im Sinne von ‘wahrerMensch’, vielleicht sogar im Sinne von‘Menschensohn’.” This leads Schenke to suggest the following as a possible paraphrase:“WennduzumMenschensohnwieJesuswirst,wirdderMenschensohnJesusdichlieben”(Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ).427Cf. Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, .428Isenberg’s translation significantly obscures the way these terms are used, by trans-latingⲧⲱϩvariously as “have intercourse,” “associate,” and “mingle”;̄ⲣⲕⲟⲓⲛⲱⲛⲉⲓas “con-sortwith”and“share”;andbytranslatingⲗⲟⲅⲟⲥwith“thought”(seeLaytonandIsenberg,“GospelAccordingtoPhilip,”,;WesleyW.Isenberg,“TheGospelofPhilip[II,],”inThe Nag Hammadi Library in English[rd revised ed.; ed.

Schenke concludes that the point of thepassage may be summarised with the following paraphrase: “Du sollst den Menschen-sohn lieben! Dann wirst du als Menschensohn einer von oben.

The shift to thiswordatthesametimeasthetermLogosismentionedpromptsforaChristian, and in this text sacramental, context for the interpretation ofthe blend.Now, where does one mingle, or have communion with Logos orSpirit? Buckley takes the description of the fact that when one becomeslogos or spirit the Logos or Spirit will reciprocate by mingling or join-ing with the person in question as an allusion to ritual activity.430Thereference to those above “resting upon you” (̄ⲙⲧⲟⲛ̄ⲙⲙⲟⲟⲩⲉϩⲣⲁ ̈ⲓⲉϫⲱⲕ)recalls the reference to the Holy Spirit resting upon Jesus at his baptismin the Jordan,431and by extension the baptismal anointing with chrismadministered to the Christian initiates.On the grounds ofGos. Phil.’s identification of the flesh of Christ, andhencetheeucharisticbread,withhisLogos,andhisblood,andhencetheeucharistic wine, with the Holy Spirit, the eucharistic ritual also comesreadily to mind here asGos. Phil.envisagesit,animportantaspectbeingthat logos mixes with Logos, and spirit mixes with Holy Spirit. In orderto be able to have communion in this way, however, the communicantneeds to have become what he or she is to have communion with. Forthe focus seems here, in the excerpt quoted above, as in the seeing andbecoming passages, to be on the necessity of becoming what you wantto commune with.432If one stays as an animal one may only have com-munion with animals. Communions happening contrary to the princi-plesoutlinedabove,however,arecharacterisedbyGos.Phil.as“adultery”(̄ⲙ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲧⲛⲟⲉⲓⲕ):ⲕⲟⲓⲛⲱⲛⲓⲁⲇⲉⲛⲓⲙ̄ⲛⲧⲁϩϣⲱⲡⲉⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛⲛⲉϯⲛⲉⲁⲛ̄ⲛⲛⲟⲩⲉⲣⲏⲩⲟⲩ̄ⲙ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲧⲛⲟⲉⲓⲕⲧⲉAnd every communion that has taken place between those who do notresemble each other constitutes adultery.(Gos.

The description of the communion of those who areunlike one another as adultery must specifically be seen in the light ofPaul’s interpretation of Lev : in his second letter to the Corinthians.Lev : prohibits the mating of unlike animals, and Paul, in Cor:–:, applies this prohibition to human relationships, arguing thatChristians should not marry non-Christians.433Gos. Phil.takesthisonestep further, and applies Paul’s analogy metaphorically, this time not tothe relationship between humans, but rather to the relationship betweenChristiansandChrist.Atthesametime,thepositioningoftheabovequoted statement at the end of the passage concerning Eve’s conceptionof Cain from her relations with the serpent, also connects the sinfulnessof the mating of different species to the story of the fall and the paradisenarrative in general.434....Eating and BecomingCloselyrelatedtothemotifsofseeingandbecomingandlikemixingwithlike, outlined above,Gos.

This mirrors the abovediscussed passage concerning the different species only mating withtheir own, and also reflects the various passages that deal with seeingand becoming. It is also highly significant that eating is here closelyconnected to procreation. Adam eats from the tree, is changed, andproducesoffspringthatarelessthandesirable.Thefullsignificanceofthisimagery only becomes clear, however, when Adam’s food is contrastedwith that of Christ:ϩⲁⲧⲉϩⲏ ⲉⲙⲡⲁⲧⲉⲡⲉ̄ⲭ̄ⲥⲉⲓⲛⲉⲙ̄ⲛⲟⲉⲓⲕ ϩ̄ⲙⲡⲕⲟⲥⲙⲟⲥ̄ⲛⲑⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲡⲁⲣⲁⲇⲓⲥⲟⲥ ⲡⲙⲁⲛⲉⲣⲉⲁⲇⲁⲙ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲩ ⲛⲉⲩ̄ⲛⲧⲁϥ ϩⲁϩ̄ⲛϣⲏⲛ̄ⲛ̄ⲛⲧⲣⲟⲫⲏ̄ⲛ̄ⲛⲑⲏⲣⲓⲟⲛ ⲛⲉⲙ̄ⲛⲧⲁϥ ⲥⲟⲩⲟ̄ⲛⲧⲧⲣⲟⲫⲏ̄ⲙⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲛⲉⲣⲉⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲥⲟⲉⲓϣ̄ⲛⲑⲉ̄ⲛ̄ⲛⲑⲏⲣⲓⲟⲛ ⲁⲗⲗⲁ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲣⲉⲡⲉⲭ̄ⲥⲉⲓⲡⲧⲉⲗⲓⲟⲥ̄ⲣⲣⲱⲙⲉⲁϥⲉⲓⲛⲉ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲕⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛⲧⲡⲉϣⲓⲛⲁⲉⲣⲉⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉⲛⲁ̄ⲣⲧⲣⲉⲫⲉⲥⲑⲁⲓϩ̄ⲛⲧⲧⲣⲟⲫⲏ̄ⲙⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉBefore Christ came there was no bread in the world, like in Paradise, theplacewereAdamwas,thereweremanytreesforthefoodoftheanimals.Ithad no wheat for the food of man.

The passageclearly alludes to the discourse in John :– concerning Jesus as thebreadoflifefromheaven andcannotbeproperlyunderstoodapartfromthis intertext.

It was from that place that Jesus came, and he brought food fromthere, and those who wanted he gave them [to eat, so that] they might notdie.(Gos. Phil. .–)In this passage as well,Gos. Phil. contrasts worldly food with heavenly,andthecontrastiscleverlypresentedbymeansofacomparisonbypartialblending of two metaphors, namely that of the world as a corpse-eaterand truth as a life-eater. One must eat the heavenly food brought byJesus in order to gain eternal life. The argument employs a conceptualblend between the domains of eating and death and also makes useof the logic of identity between the eater and the eaten (see fig. ). Theworld eating corpses may be understood as a metaphorical descriptionof the burial and/or decomposition of corpses, and as a contrast tothis,Gos. Phil. presents truth as an eater of life, a metaphor that is onlyunderstandablewhenitiscontrastivelyblendedwiththatoftheworldas437IfollowSchenke’sreconstructionofthislacuna(seeSchenke,DasPhilippus-Evange-lium, , –; Schenke, “The Berliner Arbeitskreis,” –).

From this blending of metaphors important implicationsarise. Those who die in the world are eaten by the world, while thosewho gain life will be eaten by truth, which means that instead of beingdissolved into the material earth they will be dissolved into truth.438AndaswefindelsewhereinGos. Phil., truth is to be equated with theinner, true reality hidden within the worldly types and images. Includedamong these worldly types and images are of course also the Christiansacraments, without which it is impossible to gain truth. For how doesone attain life and thus become eaten by truth? One does this by meansof the food of life brought by Jesus, for if one draws nourishment fromtruth one will not die.439By implication, if one metaphorically eats fromthe worldly things one will also be eaten by the world, which means thatone will die completely, in that one will simply be dissolved into thematerial elements.440The use of the metaphor of eating in this way, soclosely connected to the food brought by Jesus, strongly alludes to theEucharist.441...Marriage and Related ImageryGos. Phil. gives the following explanation for the primordial separationof Adam and Eve:ⲛⲉⲛⲧⲁϩⲱⲧ̄ⲣⲇⲉϩ̄ⲙⲡⲡⲁⲥⲧⲟⲥ ⲟⲩⲕⲉⲧⲓ ⲥⲉⲛⲁⲡⲱⲣϫ ⲇⲓⲁ ⲧⲟⲩⲧⲟ ⲁⲉⲩϩⲁ ⲡⲱⲣϫⲁⲁⲇⲁⲙϫⲉ̄ⲛⲧⲁⲥϩⲱⲧ̄ⲣⲉⲣⲟϥⲁⲛϩ̄ⲙⲡⲡⲁ ̇ⲥ[ⲧⲟ]ⲥAndthosewhohavejoinedinthebridalchamberwillnolongerbeseparated. Therefore Eve separated from Adam, because it was not in thebridal chamber that she joined with him.(Gos. Phil. .–)Adam and Eve separated because they did not join with each other in a“bridalchamber.”Inabasicsense,thismeansthattheywerenotproperlymarried, which again may imply that their joining lacked the proper438Cf.Gos. Phil. .–.439For an alternative, but ultimately unconvincing interpretation of the metaphor oftruth as a “life-eater,” see Patricia Cox Miller, “‘Adam Ate from the Animal Tree’: ABestial Poetry of Soul,” inThe Poetry of Thought in Late Antiquity: Essays in Imaginationand Religion(Aldershot: Ashgate, ), –. Ignoring the context of the statement inGos. Phil.,Millersuggeststhat“PerhapstheGospelofPhilipdescribes truth asalife-eaterbecause truth seems destructive and subversive” (ibid., ).440If we follow this logic one step further we might also argue, as Buckley has done,that the reason why the world eats what is dead is because it is itself dead (see Buckley,“Conceptual Models,” ).441This is the case regardless of whether the Eucharist alluded to is itself to be under-stood metaphorically or literally."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipceremony and/or that it was not performed in the proper place. Whatis certain is that, according toGos. Phil., Adam and Eve were joined,but not in the way they should have been. But what does this entail inGos. Phil.’s rhetoric? Generally speaking, the ICM of marriage may beutilised as an input in different conceptual blends in order to highlightcertainaspectsofdifferenttargetinputs.Amongthecentralconstituentsof the marriage ICM we find notions of the joining/unification oftwo people of opposite sex, the ceremonies associated with a wedding,and various ideas and aspects related to sexual procreation. We saw inthe previous chapter howExeg. Soulemploys the marriage ICM as apowerfulconceptualframinginputthatmayshedlightonseveralaspectsof conversion, initiation, and Christian life. We will now look closer atthe varied use of this conceptual domain inGos. Phil.AsinExeg. Soul,blends involving marriage imagery are pervasive inGos.

And in this regard one may be said to be knownby one’s offspring, i.e., one’s thoughts and actions, like a tree is known byits fruit. One should bear spiritual offspring rather than fleshly.445Thisshould also be seen in connection with the exhortation not to love norfearone’smaterialbody.446Wemighttakeallthistomean,then,thateventhough one is a Christian and thus “lives with” and “has communionwith” Christ, one must still make an effort to love Christ and not thematerial world.

If her husband loves her, then they resemble her husband” (Layton and Isen-berg, “Gospel According to Philip,” ; Isenberg, “The Gospel of Philip [II,],” ; thisis repeated by, e.g., Buckley, “Conceptual Models,” ), which, in addition to beingincompatible with the Coptic text, completely obscures the point of the whole passage.Isenberg did not make this mistake in his dissertation, however, where he instead trans-lated, “As for him whom the woman loves, it is he that those whom she will begetresem-ble.Ifitisherhusband,itisherhusbandthattheyresemble”(Isenberg,“CopticGospel,”). On this point, see also the comments in Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, n. .443Grant, however, takes this to mean that “the Gnostic must not love the ‘uncleanspirits’ which wish to unite with him in adulterous unions” (see Grant, “Mystery ofMarriage,” –).444Cf.Exeg.

Phil.is doing here is to highlight some potential inferences that may arisein a conceptual blend from the framing input of this-worldly humanmarriage, and/or intercourse, that one is not supposed to project backonto the unstated target input pertaining to the other world. What weare witnessing here, then, are some direct instructions with regard tothe interpretation of the blend between the this-worldly concept andthe other-worldly one, highlighting some metaphorical entailments thatdo not apply to the heavenly realities and concepts thatGos.

Phil. seems to be doing is to use themetaphorical input of human marriage, intercourse, and procreation inorder to conceptualise central religious mysteries, mysteries that call formetaphorical modes of discourse in order to be understandable to thehuman mind.Gos.

With regard to the latter question, there are twopossibilities. Either the marriage of the world is defiled in an absolutesense, in which case it is most probably to be regarded as something tobe avoided. The other possibility, however, is that it is simply defiled ina relative sense in relation to “the undefiled marriage.” So, does the factthatthetractatehereusestheterm“themarriageofdefilement”(ⲡⲅⲁⲙⲟⲥ̄ⲙⲡϫⲱϩⲙ)implyadisparagementofmarriageingeneral,455orisitsimplyto be understood as a contrasting term to “the undefiled marriage”highlightingtheelevatedstatusofthelatter?456Thesequestionsobviouslyhave far-reaching implications for the tractate’s implied views regardingthesocialorderandlifestyleofitsadherents,butarenotoriouslydifficultto answer.The identity of “the undefiled marriage” is open to various interpre-tations, asGos.

Thereare here several possibilities, and the fact that no explicit identificationis made also keeps opens the possibility that one may take it to refersimultaneously to more than one referent, i.e., that one may blend thisframing input with several different target inputs. The possibilities maybe divided into three main groups. The first is that it may refer to amarriage that is literally not of this world, but rather on a higher, heav-enly, plane.457The second possibility is that it may refer to an earthlyimageortypeofsuchaheavenlymarriage,asforexampleinamar-riage of continence, which would mimic the “marriage of defilement,”but without the defiling element of sexual intercourse.458The third pos-454See, e.g., Williams,Rethinking “Gnosticism”, .455Thisistheviewof,e.g.,Williams,Rethinking “Gnosticism”, .456See, e.g., Antti Marjanen,The Woman Jesus Loved: Mary Magdalene in the NagHammadi Library and Related Documents(NHS ; Leiden: Brill, ),  n. .457Among the suggestions have been a spiritual marriage between the initiate and hisor her heavenly double (see, e.g., Williams,Rethinking “Gnosticism”, ).458That is to say, either a marriage without sexual intercourse (see, e.g., Williams,"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipsibility, which I think makes most sense in an overall understanding ofthe rhetoric ofGos Phil., is that it refers first and foremost to a sacra-mental act or acts that are understood in terms of the ICM of mar-riage, but without involving actual human marriage in a basic sense.Finally, these interpretive possibilities may also be combined in variousways.459In order to gain a better understanding of “the undefiled marriage,”however, we need to take a closer look at how marriage imagery isemployed in various contexts throughoutGos.

Without having put on this previously discussedgarmentonemay notapproachthe king,whichmustbeunderstood asareference to God.474The interpretation of this sentence is thus relativelyunproblematic.But how is this statement connected to the one preceding it? BasedonthefactthattheCopticwordfor“door,”ⲣⲟ,issimilartothatfor“king,”̄ⲣⲣⲟ, Layton, Schenke and others have proposed to emend theformertothelatter,makingthesentenceread“king”insteadof“door.”475Rather than taking the Coptic termⲣⲟ(“door”) as a scribal mistakefor̄ⲣⲣⲟ(“king”), however, we may instead read the passage as playingon the wordsⲣⲟand̄ⲣⲣⲟ.476We thus get a transition between the twosentences that is based on a pun, and also a pun that makes good senseon several counts. Firstly, on a literal level it is of course difficult to enterinto the chambers of a king without finding the door. But how is thepart concerning the lamb related to the ability to see the door?477In474Godaskingisofcourseconnectedtothegeneralconceptofthekingdomofheaven.475Layton regardsⲡⲣⲟas an error and emends it toⲡ〈̄ⲣ〉ⲣⲟ,andIsenbergtranslatesit accordingly as “king,” rather than “door” (Layton and Isenberg, “Gospel Accordingto Philip,” –; Isenberg, “Coptic Gospel,” ). Schenke likewise thinksⲡⲣⲟis an“Irreguläre Schreibung” forⲡ̄ⲣⲣⲟand translates “den König” (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium,–;seealsoSchenke,“DasEvangeliumnachPhilippus[],”;Schen-ke,“DasEvangeliumnachPhilippus[],”;Wilson,TheGospelofPhilip,;Till,DasEvangelium nach Philippos,–.TilldoesnotemendtheCoptictext,buttranlatesbothⲣⲟand̄ⲣⲣⲟas “König”). Most scholars have retained this emendation, see, e.g., StephenGero, “The Lamb and the King: ‘Saying’  of the Gospel of Philip Reconsidered,”OrChr (): ; Tripp, “Sacramental System,” ; DeConick, “Entering God’s Presence,”.Aswillbearguedhere,however,themanuscriptreadingmakesgoodsenseasis,andthereisthusnoreasontoemendit(cf.Giversen,Filipsevangeliet, –,  n. ).476Stephen Gero notes that ifⲣⲟis not emended, the two parts of the passage “maynot have had a connection in the GreekVorlage” (Gero, “The Lamb and the King,” n. ). Another possibility is that there was no GreekVorlagefor this passage. John Barnshas suggested that the similarity between the wordsⲣⲟand̄ⲣⲣⲟis purely coincidental(see John Barns, review of Robert McL.

Phil.’s logic ofbecoming and seeing, which is also, as we have seen, to some extentitself based on the Gospel of John. “I am the door” (ⲁⲛⲟⲕ ⲡⲉ ⲡⲣⲟ/\u0002γ2ε\u001eμι J \u00197ρα), Jesus states in John :, and adds that those who enterby him will be saved.478As for the lamb, John the Baptist identifies Jesusas “the lamb of God” (ⲡⲉϩⲓⲉⲓⲃ̄ⲙⲡⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ/% :μν ς τ\u0012\u0016 \u0019ε\u0012\u0016)inJohn:and , and Jesus as the lamb (:ρν\u0014\u0012νin Greek, butϩⲓⲉⲓⲃin Coptic)479is of course also the most important christological title in Revelation.480We may thus identify both the lamb and the door with Jesus.481As wehave seen, it is an important principle inGos. Phil.thattobeabletoseesomething of the true realities one needs to become like them. Thus, tobe able to see Jesus as he really is, one needs to become like him. Thisimplies, in this passage, that one must become like Jesus in order to see“the door.” Jesus as lamb, on the other hand, obviously has sacrificial,and hence eucharistic, connotations,482and,aswehaveseen,tobecomeChrist-like by putting on the perfect man483and gaining clothing484areamong the effects of the eucharistic ritual. Thus the logic seems to bethatbyingestingJesusintheEucharist,andtherebynotdespisinghimasthe lamb, one may become like him, according to the principle that onebecomes what one eats. How consuming Jesus in the Eucharist (as thelamb) and seeing him (as the door) are related to the statement that onemay not approach the king naked then becomes clear in relation to thereferences to putting on the garment by means of the Eucharist.485a reference to that gospel seems closer at hand (a possible allusion to John :– is alsosuggested by Kasser [see ibid.]).478Cf. also John : in NA27. For extensive exegesis of Jesus’ reference to himself as“the door,” see, e.g., Origen,Comm. in Jo., .–, where Origen connects Jesus as doorwith entry to the Father/King.479See Wilmet,Concordance, :.480See Rev :, , , ; :, ; :, , , ; :; :; :, , ; :; :;:, ; :, , , , ; :, .

For the possible connection of ourpassage with Matt , see the discussion below.482See,e.g.,Tripp,“SacramentalSystem,”;Pagels,“PursuingtheSpiritualEve,”.483See above.484See above.485Tripp,however,hasaslightlydifferentinterpretation, statingthat,“ThereferencetoMatthew xxii. (no Lukan parallel) and the wedding feast guests improperly dressedis made more probable by, and itself supports, the natural reading of ‘the Lamb’ asa reference to the Eucharist, eaten by the neophytes in their baptismal robes” (Tripp,"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"chapter fourSo, to sum up, one becomes like Christ by participating in the Eucha-rist and may thus see him, so that one may enter by him into the king-dom of heaven.

Mé-"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipTaken at face value, Jesus here refers not only to the disciples, but alsoto himself as an “image” (ϩⲓⲕⲱⲛ).491If this is the case, then what theyareimagesofcannotsimplybeJesushimself,butrathertheangels.Itthus follows from this that Jesus himself is an image of an angel. Now, inwhat way may Christ be regarded as the image of an angel? ElsewhereinGos. Phil. the disciples are images of Christ. Could it be that thedisciples should here be regarded as the images of both Christ and theangels?Iproposethatwemayunderstandthispassageonthebasisofthepas-sage just discussed, which directly follows this prayer, together with thetransfigurationscenethatdirectlyprecedesit.Thismeansthatweshouldregard it as an epiclesis prayer that is linked to the eucharistic appro-priation of the perfect man and of the garment, and which takes placeon the day of the transfiguration. To understand how these aspects areconnected, however, we need to read this part ofGos. Phil.intertextu-ally with the transfiguration accounts in Matthew and Luke. The Lukanaccount of the transfiguration, which is the only one that connects thenard and Sevrin see a reference to the unification of the Saviour and Sophia on the onehand and that of the angels and the spiritual seed on the other (see Ménard,L’Évangileselon Philippe, ; Sevrin, “Les noces spirituelles,” ). Wilson sees the unification ofthe Light, whom he identifies as “the Saviour Jesus,” with “the Mother or Spirit,” and“the Gnostics” with the angels (see Wilson,The Gospel of Philip, ). Schenke sees “dietypisch valentinianische Lehrevon dervorzeitlicheHochzeitsvereinigung zwischen demSoter (samt seinemEngelgefolge) und der Achamoth als dem Typos der erlösendeninnerzeitlichen Vereinigung zwischen diesenEngelnund den ihnen entsprechenden ausjener Vereinigung hervorgegangenen Geistseelen der Menschen, die ihreendzeitlicheErfüllung bei der Rückkehr alles Geistigen in das Pleroma, das ihnen zum himmlischenBrautgemach wird, findet” (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, , Schenke’s empha-sis). See below for an alternative interpretation.491Gaffron finds this to be rather strange, stating that “Merkwürdig ist, daß er bei derfolgenden Bitte um die Vereinigung der Jünger mit ihren Engeln sich selbst mit ein-schließt,” and offers the suggestion that it may be due to “die zuvor berichtete Poly-morphieJesu,”andthat“dieBitteistalsoim uneigentlichen Sinne zu verstehen; siehat ihren Sinn vom Assimilationsgedanken her” (Gaffron,Studien, ). Sevrin like-wise finds it strange that the prayer is put into the mouth of Jesus, but suggests that“Cette difficulté se résout au mieux si l’on considère cette ‘eucharistie’ comme une for-mule liturgique mise a posteriori, et quelque peu maladroitement, dans la bouche duChrist. Dans ce cas son lien au contexte demeure fragile, et témoigne, au mieux, del’interprétation qu’en donne le rédacteur” (Sevrin, “Les noces spirituelles,” ). Segel-berg thinks that it is “without careful consideration” that this “liturgical prayer has beenput into the mouth of Jesus,” and suggests that what is is quoted here may be only a partof a longer prayer, and that the reason why the phrasing has not been changed is that thephrase itself “was well known and unchangeable” (Segelberg, “Prayer Among the Gnos-tics,” )."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"chapter fourtransfiguration with Jesus praying, in fact states that his appearancechanged “as he prayed” (ϩ̄ⲙⲡⲧⲣⲉϥϣⲗⲏⲗ/\u0002ν τA# πρ\u0012σε7\u0010εσ\u0019αι α\"τ ν).492It is also, as mentioned above, the only one that mentions Jesus’ “glory.”Moreover, while all the Synoptics report that Moses and Elijah appearedat the transfiguration, only Luke states that they appeared “in glory”(ϩ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲟⲟⲩ/\u0002ν δ\u001f\u0003Bη).493However, in all the Synoptics the transfigurationnarrative is preceded by a reference to the coming of the Son of Manin glory, and they all mention the angels in this context.

Phil. .–, although elsewhere inGos. Phil. the light is more often a propertyof the Holy Spirit. An alternative may be to understand “the perfect, thelight” in accordance with the Gospel of John as a more general referencetoChrist.495Inthatcasewemaysimplyunderstandthisjoiningtorefertothat of Christ receiving the Holy Spirit at his baptism in the Jordan. Thesecond joining, which is what Jesus prays for, is more problematic. Aswe have seen, “us” should here logically include Jesus, which means thatJesusreferstohimselfandthedisciplesasimagesofangelsandpraysforthe angels to join with them. That Jesus may be referred to as an imageof an angel can be supported by reference to what is stated just a fewlines previously inGos.

Phil.passage?As mentioned above, the angels are referred to directly prior to thetransfiguration account in the Synoptics. Also of note is the close con-nection between the transfiguration accounts and the post-resurrectionaccounts in the New Testament. For in the New Testament the mani-festation of Jesus’ glory in the transfiguration has clear parallels in theappearance of the resurrected Christ.498A particularly significant paral-lel is found between the Synoptics’, and especially Luke’s, account of theappearance of Moses and Elijah at the transfiguration, and the accountof the ascension of Jesus in Acts . The latter relates that when Jesusascended to heaven, two men stood by the disciples “in white garments”(ϩ̄ⲛϩⲉⲛϩ̄ⲃⲥⲱ ⲉⲩⲟⲩⲟⲃ̄ϣ/\u0002ν \u0002σ\u0019\u0004σεσι λευκα&ς).499In the transfigurationscene Jesus is described as having white and shining garments, and bothhe, Moses, and Elijah are described by Luke as appearing in “glory.” The495See John :; :.496Gos.

Matt :–; Mark :; John :."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"chapter fourappearance of Moses and Elijah at the transfiguration is thus mirroredbytheappearanceofthetwomeninwhitegarmentsattheascensionofJesus in Acts :. Thus the “two men” in Acts who parallel Moses andElijah in Luke may be interpreted as angels, and it is consequently easyto make the connection in the opposite direction as well, once the twopassageshavebeenmentallyconnected.Jesus,forhispart,maythusalsobe understood to appear here in a way as an image of the angels, in thathe has white and shining garments and appears in “glory.”Considering the fact that the following part of the passage alludesheavily to the Matthean parable of the Wedding Feast, and consideringthe widespread use of Matthew elsewhere inGos. Phil., we should notdiscount the possibility of also drawing on Matthew with regard to thetransfiguration account and the prayer of Jesus. Matthew’s descriptionof Jesus’ garments being white “as the light” (̄ⲛⲑⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲛ/Uς τ <#ς)and of Jesus’ face shining like the sun,500may in fact provide a rationalefor the reference to the joining of the light to the Holy Spirit. Since wehave already seen that Christ’s true body inGos. Phil.isconstitutedbythe joining of the Logos and the Holy Spirit, his true flesh and blood,within an earthly body, and that the Spirit is sometimes connected withthe garment, the joining of the light with the Holy Spirit could simplybe understood as a reference to the synoptic account of Jesus and hisgarment being made bright and shining at his transfiguration.Thesequenceofeventsrelatingtothetransfigurationandtheeucharis-tic prayer of Jesus may thus beconstruedas follows: First the Holy Spiritjoins with the light causing Christ to become angelic (i.e., an image ofthe angels). Then the disciples are made great so as to become equal tohim, thus becoming themselves images of angels in the process. This isachieved by the partaking of the Logos and the Holy Spirit by means oftheeucharisticfleshandblood ofJesus,i.e.,thebreadandthemixedcupin the Eucharist.501Jesus then prays to his father, referring back to the500Matt :.501This, along with several other eucharistic passages inGos. Phil., recalls the sacra-mentaltheologyofAthanasius.AccordingtoNormanRussel,forAthanasius“[t]hedivineWord is a heavenly food which nourishes our souls.” Athanasius asserts that “[w]e nolongereatthefleshofalambbutChrist’sownflesh.”AsinGos.Phil.,Athanasiusalsocon-nectssalvationtothepartakingoftheLogos:“wemaynolonger,asmereearth,returntoearth,butas beingjoined to theLogosfrom heaven,maybecarried to heavenbyhim. .. .nolonger as beingmen,butasproperto theLogos,[we]mayhaveashareineternal life”(Athanasius,C.Ar..).

In that case, the joining with the angels might refer tojoining the angels in the heavenly liturgy. What the prayer refers backtomaythusbetheprocessbywhichonebecomesangelicandChristlikethroughtheritualsofbaptismandchrismation.ThejoiningoftheperfectwiththeHolySpiritwouldinthatcasereferbothtothebaptismofChristin the Jordan and the Christian initiates’ reception of the Holy Spiritin their baptismal chrismation. The interpretation of this ritual processas becoming like the angels may stem from a practice, which we havepossible allusions to elsewhere inGos. Phil., of donning white garmentsafter emersion from the baptismal water. The angels that are referred toin the prayer may refer simply to angels, but if this is a prayer used in aninitiatory setting it could also simply be a reference to the congregationof already initiated Christians whom the newly initiated are now readyto join in the celebration of the Eucharist. In either case, the referencein the prayer to a joining with the angels could simply refer to a joiningtogether in worship of the heavenly Father.Gos.

The enjoyment of this life ispresented in eschatological terms, when we shall have ascended into heaven. There weshall sit on thrones. There too we shall contemplate the Father, for that which partici-pates in the Logos joins the angels in the everlasting contemplation of God” (see Russell,Doctrine of Deification, –).502Jesus’eucharistic prayermaythusbe saidto have, inasense, abipartite anamnesis-epiclesis structure.503Cf.

This still does not exhaust the allusive potential of thepassage, however.505Another intertext that deserves consideration isthe vision of the throne room described in Rev :–. This passagecontains such a significant number of themes and terms that echo thosewhichwehavediscussedinGos.Phil.,especiallyinrelationtothelatter’sinterpretation of the Eucharist, that it would seem to be readily broughtto the mind of a reader familiar with this canonical text in a reading ofGos. Phil. Rev :– describes a multitude clad in white robes standingbefore the throne of God and the Lamb. We are further told that thereare angels standing around the throne giving thanks to God. Thosewho are standing there in white garments are identified as those whowashed their robes and “made them white in the blood of the Lamb,”which, we are told, is why they are allowed to stand before the throne ofGod serving him. These people will no longer hunger or thirst, nor bebothered by the sun, since they get food and drink from the Lamb, and,as we have seen, they also have white garments. They thus have “foodand drink and clothing,” just like those who participate in the Eucharistaccording toGos. Phil.506These people described in Rev :– may besaid to have been made angel-like, wearing white garments and havingjoined the angels in giving thanks to God like they do.

Phil. .–.)As we can see, this passage also echoes the discourse in Luke :–and Jesus’ answer to the disciples inGos. Phil. .–. Especially worthyofnotehereishow givingandreceivinglove isconnectedwith receivingthe Lord so as not to stay a Hebrew. In order to receive the Lord, oneneedstohavefaithanddedicateone’slovetohim.Receivingone’srewardfor loving Christ is here directly linked to receiving the Lord. If we linkthis discourse on love with the passages discussed above, we see that itis easy to draw the conclusion that the reception of the Lord referred tohere has to do with the anointing with chrism, since we have seen lovelinkedtotheointment,andthereceptionofandbecomingChristcloselyconnected to the chrismation.551The additional points made here, then,are on the one hand the necessity of faith and love in order to receiveChrist, and on the other hand that the undesirable alternative situationentails the continued existence as a Hebrew. This means in basic termsthatwithoutfaithandloveofChristonecannotbecomeaChristian,andin that case one stays on the pre-Christian level of the Hebrews.552Gos. Phil. seems not only to link the reception of Christ and spirituallove strictly to ritual initiation, however, but also to doctrine.550Cf.Gos. Phil. :–.551Cf. Isenberg, “Coptic Gospel,” .552As Isenberg rightly notes, “Here ‘the Hebrew’ need not mean the Hebrew by racialdescent,” but is rather used “typologically for all who have not yet experienced the‘receiving of the Lord’ and the blessings of the New Age” (Isenberg, “Coptic Gospel,”). His assertion, however, that this should therefore not “be construed as anti-Jewishfeeling”onthepartofGos.Phil.(ibid.,n.)isnotconvincing,sincethewayGos.Phil.here uses theICM of Hebrew metaphorically is also at the same time an integral part ofthe tractate’s overall anti-Jewish polemic.

Phil. .–)Significantly,Gos. Phil. stresses not only the importance of the receptionof truth, i.e. the correct doctrine of Christ, but also the importance ofgiving this truth to others. This point becomes especially clear when weconsider the Pauline intertexts that are likely to be activated in a readingof this passage. In particular, a passage from Ephesians and one fromPhilippians have the potentiality to be triggered, partly through theircommon use of the phraseϩ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲁⲅⲁⲡⲏ(“with love”). Philippians statesthat some speak “the word of God” (ⲡϣⲁϫⲉ̄ⲙⲡⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ) “from envy andquarrel,whileotherspreachChristwillingly”(ⲉⲧⲃⲉⲟⲩⲫⲑⲟⲛⲟⲥⲙ̄ⲛⲟⲩϯⲧⲱⲛ·ϩⲉⲛⲕⲟⲟⲩⲉ ⲇⲉ ⲉϩⲛⲁⲩ ⲥⲉⲧⲁϣⲉⲟ ̈ⲓϣ̄ⲙⲡⲉ̄ⲭ̄ⲥ·), the latter doing it “out of love”(ⲉⲃⲟⲗϩ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲁⲅⲁⲡⲏ).554This intertextmay thus helpusidentify the referentforⲡⲁⲉⲓ(“this one”) inGos. Phil.’s phraseⲧⲥⲉⲃⲟ ⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓ ⲟⲩⲁⲁϥ(“teachthis one alone”) as Christ.555As for Ephesians, Eph :– is especiallyrelevant, as it connects the loving teaching of truth with deification,stating that “speaking truth with love we shall grow into him completely,that is, the head, Christ” (ⲉⲛϫⲉⲙⲉ...ϩ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲁⲅⲁⲡⲏ̄ⲛⲧ̄ⲛⲁⲩⲝⲁⲛⲉⲉϩⲟⲩⲛⲉⲣⲟϥ̄ⲙⲡⲧⲏⲣ̄ϥⲉⲧⲉⲡⲁⲓⲡⲉⲧⲁⲡⲉⲡⲉ̄ⲭ̄ⲥ).556WesawthatifonedoesnotreceiveChristonewillmetaphoricallystaya Hebrew. This is not all, however, for one will also stay a slave and acaptive. We saw above that in the eschatological reception of the chrism,the slaves would be set free and the prisoners redeemed. The distinctionbetween slaves and free also surfaces in another passage inGos. Phil.,where it is directly connected to the requirements for experiencing the“bridal chamber” (ⲡⲁⲥⲧⲟⲥ):ⲙⲁⲣⲉⲡⲁⲥⲧⲟⲥϣ ̇ⲱ ̇ⲡⲉ ̇̄ⲛ̄ⲛⲑ ̇ⲏⲣⲓⲟⲛⲟ ̇ⲩⲧⲉⲙⲁϥϣⲱⲡⲉ̄ⲛ̄ⲛϩⲙ ̇̄ϩ ̇̄̄ⲁ ̇̄ⲗⲟⲩⲧⲉ̄ⲛⲥϩⲓⲙⲉⲉϥϫⲟϩⲙⲁⲗⲗⲁϣⲁϥϣⲱⲡ ̇ⲉ̄ⲛϩ̄ⲛⲣⲱⲙⲉ̄ⲛⲉⲗⲉⲩⲑⲉⲣⲟⲥⲙ̄ⲛϩ̄ⲛⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥAbridalchamberdoesnottakeplacefortheanimals,nordoesittakeplacefor the slaves, nor for defiled women, but it takes place for free men andvirgins.(Gos.

We could say that according tothe ICM of marriage, a bridal chamber is, quite naturally, somethingreserved for human beings, and it is also here reserved for free men andvirgins.Thisrather commonsensestatement is,of course,to beregardedas a constructionof a mental framing input space, while the significanceofthestatementonlybecomesclearwhenitismentallyblendedwithoneor more target, or focus, inputs and thus interpreted metaphorically.In an interpretation of the passage as a metaphor, the use of the terms“freemen”(ϩ̄ⲛⲣⲱⲙⲉ̄ⲛⲉⲗⲉⲩⲑⲉⲣⲟⲥ)and“virgins”(ϩ̄ⲛⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ)todesignatethose who may experience the bridal chamber is significant. In John:– those who are referred to as free are those who are not slavesto sin.557Accordingly, in early Christian usage the term\u0002λε7\u0019ερ\u0012ςisoften used to refer specifically to Christians as being those who arefree from sin, and in many cases the term is directly associated withfreedom from sin as something achieved through faith and baptism.558The animals must again, as elsewhere inGos. Phil., be understood asmetaphorical representations of human beings, more specifically non-Christian human beings, as we have seen above. As for the virgins, itis open to interpretation whether this designation is to be understoodliterally or metaphorically in the blend. We will return to this questionbelow.Taking the human beings in this passage to refer only to the Chris-tians, and the free men and virgins to refer to Christians who are freefrom sin, and who most probably have been baptised, the “bridal cham-ber”(ⲡⲁⲥⲧⲟⲥ)isonlyforthesepeople.Butwhatshouldweunderstandthebridalchambertoreferto?Theimportantreferencestojoiningsanduni-fications we have identified inGos.

In this case, having identified the people who areallowed into the “bridal chamber” as Christians who are free from sin,the joiningin this case seems most likely to be that of the Christian withChrist. Whether this joining is here to be regarded simply as a men-tal/spiritualjoiningwithChrist,perhapsthroughprayer,oraritualone,like for instance baptism, chrismation, or Eucharist, or rather an escha-tological one, is open to interpretation.

Phil.hastodowiththerelationshipbetweenthehiddenandtherevealed,secrecyand openness, and the tractate uses several different source inputs formetaphorical blends relating to these conceptual pairs. These framinginputsaremostlytakenfromthreemainICMs,namelythatofthehumanbody, the Jerusalem temple, and marriage. In each case important scrip-tural input spaces are recalled that partly explain and partly heightenthe significance of the blends. We will start by considering an extendedpassage559whereGos. Phil. sets up anatomical and botanical conceptualframing inputs which are blended with scriptural intertexts in an argu-ment that engages several issues at once. The passage will be tackled infour parts. The first one goes as follows:[ⲡⲉϩⲟ]ⲩ ̇ⲟ ̇̄ⲛⲧ ̇ⲉ[ⲡ]ⲕ ̇ⲟⲥⲙⲟⲥ ⲉⲛϩⲟⲥⲟⲛ ⲛⲟⲩ[ⲥⲁ ⲛϩⲟⲩ] ̇ⲛϩⲏ[ⲡⲥⲉ] ̇ⲁϩⲉⲣⲁⲧⲟⲩ ⲁⲩⲱⲥⲉⲟⲛϩ[ⲉⲩϣⲁⲛ] ̇ⲟⲩⲱⲛ[ϩⲉⲃ] ̇ⲟⲗ ⲁⲩⲙⲟⲩ ⲕⲁⲧⲁ ⲡⲡⲁ[ⲣⲁⲇⲓⲅⲙ]ⲁ̄ⲙⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉⲉⲧⲟⲩⲟⲛⲉϩⲉⲃⲟⲗ[ⲉⲛϩⲟⲥⲟ]ⲛ̄ⲙⲙⲁϩⲧ̄ⲙⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ϩⲏⲡ ϥⲟⲛϩ̄ⲛϭⲓⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲉⲩϣⲁϭⲱⲗⲡ̄ⲛϭⲓⲛⲉ-ϥⲙⲁϩⲧⲥⲉ̄ⲣⲡⲃⲟⲗ̄ⲛϩⲏⲧϥϥⲛⲁⲙⲟⲩ̄ⲛϭⲓⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ[Most (creatures/things)] of [the] world stand and are alive as long astheir [insides are hidden.

Just as the man dieswhen his entrails are revealed, so too the tree dies if its root is exposed.From these two examplesGos. Phil. concludes that this is the case withevery “offspring” (ϫⲡⲟ) in the world. The tractate then shifts, ratherunexpectedly, from these examples to make a metaphorical connectionbetween the tree and evil. Like the tree, evil thrives when its root ishidden,butdieswhenitsrootisrevealed.Withthehindsightprovidedbythisexplicitmetaphor,theexampleofthemanwhodieswhenhisbowelsare exposed becomes a decidedly stronger allusion to the death of Judas.Like the evil Judas died when his entrails came out, evil in general dieswhenitsrootisbroughtoutintotheopen.Gos.

Phil. .–)Gos. Phil. stresses that the inner goings on of the marriage should notbe revealed. On the one hand it is pointed out that what takes placein the bedroom between the bridegroom and the bride should not takeplace outside it, and on the other it is made clear that only a select feware allowed inside the bridal chamber. This is especially understandableon the basis of the logic outlined above concerning the fact that hiddenthings thrive, while if the hidden things are brought out into the opentheydie.Thus,ifthemarriagebecomesanopenbusinessitbecomesadultery and consequently “dies.”We are given a clue to the identity of the metaphorical target of thismarriage in the description of the small benefits that are to befall thoseon the outside of the bridal chamber. They may feed on the crumbs thatfall from the table, and they may enjoy the bride’s “ointment” (ⲥⲟϭ̄ⲛ).This clearly links up with the motif discussed above concerning theoil, ointment, and fragrance. The fragrance and the crumbs that benefitthose who stand outside would seem to indicate a kind of general moralobligation on the part of the initiated Christians to provide some kindofbenefittothosewhoarenotinitiated,whetheritbeofaspiritualor of a more concrete kind.

Phil. .–, Truth is here clothed inwhatseemstobesacramentaltypesandimages.575Thismeansontheonehand that truth is conveyed through such types and images, and on theother that there is a higher reality behind them. The argument seems togo as follows: () Truth is accessible to us in the material world only bymeans of types and images. (a) There is a true rebirth and there is animageofitthatisavailabletousinthisworld.Inordertobetrulyrebornit is necessary to use the image of the rebirth that is available to us inthisworld.Thisisarebirthwhich,fromwhatwehaveseenofGos. Phil.’ssacramental theology, is probably to be identified as a combination ofbaptism and chrismation. (b)Gos. Phil. then asks a rhetorical questionconcerning the identity of the true resurrection and its image. Insteadof answering this question directly, the point that the worldly imagesare necessary in order to gain access to the heavenly realities is simplyrestated. (c) Then follows yet another question that is not answered571Laytonemendstoⲁ〈ⲛⲉⲛⲧⲁ〉ⲩϫⲡⲟⲟⲩ,“〈thosewho〉haveproducedthem”(seeLaytonand Isenberg, “Gospel According to Philip,” –).572Cf.

Entry into the truebridal chamber, then, requires entry into its this-worldly type. The threeexamples thusstressthesamepoint,acquisitionofthetruthrequirestheexperience of its types and images in this world.() The linguistically difficult final section then seems to argue thatone needs to receive not only the names of the Father, the Son, and theHoly Spirit, but also in a sense the realities to which these names refer.This takes place in the chrismation, which seems to be accompanied bya Trinitarian formula and probably also the sign of the cross. By meansof such a chrismation, then, one becomes “a Christ” (ⲟⲩⲭ̄ⲣ̄ⲥ)onlyifonehas truly received the realities that go with the names.576The point that truth is present in the world in a hidden sense is alsoexpressed elsewhere in the text by means of a botanical metaphor:ⲧⲁⲗⲏⲑⲉⲓⲁⲥⲉⲥⲓⲧⲉ̄ⲙⲙⲟⲥ̄ⲙⲙⲁⲛⲓⲙⲧⲉⲧϣⲟⲟⲡϫⲓⲛ̄ⲛϣⲟⲣⲡⲁⲩⲱⲟⲩⲛϩⲁϩⲛⲁⲩⲉⲣⲟⲥⲉⲩⲥⲓⲧⲉ̄ⲙⲙⲟⲥϩ̄ⲛⲕⲟⲩⲉⲓⲇⲉⲉⲧⲟⲩⲛⲁⲩⲉⲣⲟⲥⲉⲩⲱⲥϩ̄ⲙⲙⲟⲥTruth, which has been in existence since the beginning, is sown every-where, and there are many who see it being sown, but there are few whosee it being reaped.(Gos. Phil. .–)Here the sowing is mapped onto the “types and images,” while the realtruth hidden in them is mapped onto the reaping. Thus, by means ofthis blend several important aspects of the process of gaining insightinto the truth are cleverly laid out simultaneously. Among the signifi-cant entailments of this blend is the insight that the process of gainingknowledge of the truth is one of maturation; that truth is hidden in theworldinamanneranalogoustothewayaplantoratreeishiddenwithina seed; and that the act of apprehending the truth is analogous to har-vesting, i.e., to the reaping of a reward, to put it with another metaphor-ical blend. Moreover, since truth has been sown everywhere since thebeginning it has always existed in the world, even though it has beenhidden.Now, who are those few who see the reaping of the truth?Gos. Phil.states rather tautologically that to be able to see, one must not be blind:576SeeGos.

The first two were shown by Jesus in his baptism in theJordan, whilethelatter isreportedmostdirectlyinthe institutionnarra-tives. “Bridal chamber” may, as we have seen, point to an interpretationof aspects of especially the chrism and the Eucharist, but it might alsobe read in this context as an allusion to the wedding at Cana,600whereJesus did things with a deeper meaning, and even, as John relates, man-ifested his “glory” for the first time.601As for “redemption” (ⲥⲱⲧⲉ), this594It is enough to acknowledge the adverbial sense of the prepositional phrase “in amystery” (as in the KJV translation of Cor :) and no need to change the translation(contrary to Thomassen, “Not ‘In a Mystery’”).595SeeLampeb.Forasimilarunderstandingofthemeaningofϩ̄ⲛⲛⲟⲩⲙⲩⲥⲧⲏⲣⲓⲟⲛinGos.

The TempleAnimportantmotifGos.Phil.utilisesinseveralcontextsistheJerusalemtemple. This is also yet another motif that is used to provide framinginputs in different metaphorical blends. We have already seen how thetractate employs temple imagery in an eschatological context and inconnection with the effects of the crucifixion. We will now take a closerlook at a passage where temple imagery is employed to make quitedifferent points. In an intriguing passage that is unfortunately cut shortdue to the state of the manuscript,Gos. Phil. describes the layout of theJerusalem temple and its significance:ⲛⲉⲩ̄ⲛϣⲟⲙⲧ̄ⲛⲏⲉⲓ̄ⲙⲙⲁ̄ⲛϯⲡⲣⲟⲥⲫⲟⲣⲁ ϩ̄ⲛⲑⲓⲉⲣⲟⲥⲟⲗⲩⲙⲁ ⲡⲟⲩⲁ ⲉϥⲟⲩⲉⲛ ⲉⲡⲁⲙⲛⲧⲉⲉⲩⲙⲟⲩⲧⲉ ⲉⲣⲟϥ ϫⲉⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ ⲡⲕⲉⲟⲩⲁ ⲉϥⲟⲩⲏⲛ ⲉⲡⲥⲁⲣⲏⲥ ⲉⲩⲙⲟⲩⲧⲉ ⲉⲣⲟϥϫⲉⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ ⲡⲙⲁϩϣⲟⲙⲧ ⲉϥⲟⲩⲏⲛ ⲁⲡⲁⲉⲓⲃⲧⲉ ⲉⲩⲙⲟⲩⲧⲉ ⲉⲣⲟϥϫⲉⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ̄ⲛⲛⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃⲡⲙⲁⲉϣ ̇ⲁ ̇ⲣⲉⲡⲁⲣⲭⲓⲉⲣⲉⲩ[ⲥ]ⲃⲱⲕⲉϩⲟⲩⲛⲉⲙⲁⲩⲟⲩⲁ[ⲁ] ̇ϥⲡⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁⲡⲉⲡⲏⲉⲓⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ[ⲡ] ̇ⲥ ̇ⲱ[ⲧ]ⲉⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃⲡⲉⲧ[ⲟⲩⲁ]ⲁ ̇ⲃ602Cf.

Phil. here makes use of what he calls “the mistaken idea that therewere three halls in the temple at Jerusalem.”608The way in whichGos.Phil. utilises temple imagery seems to draw heavily upon the epistleto the Hebrews. Indeed,Gos. Phil. may even have drawn its tripartitedivision of the Temple directly from Heb , since, after a description ofthetwotabernaclesinHeb:–,Heb:introduces“thegreatperfecttabernacle” (ⲧⲛⲟϭ̄ⲛⲥⲕⲏⲛⲏ ⲉⲧϫⲏⲕ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ),whichis“notofthiscreation”(̄ⲛⲧⲁⲡⲉⲉⲓⲥⲱⲛ̄ⲧⲁⲛ), thus indicating not two, but three tabernacles.609SimilarlyitisstatedatHeb:thatChristdidnotenter“theholies”(ⲛⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ), which are only “patterns of the true” (ⲥⲙⲟⲧⲛ̄ⲙⲙⲉ), but intoheaven,indicatingthelatterasthethird,higher,tabernacle.Significantly,his entry into “the holy” by means of his own blood is associated with605This lacuna may also be restoredⲡ[ⲭⲣⲉⲓ] ̇ⲥⲙⲁ(“the [chrism]”).606IfollowSchenke’sreconstructionofthislacuna(seeSchenke,DasPhilippus-Evange-lium, ).

For an attempt, see Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, .608Segelberg,“SacramentalSystem,”.Schenkeproposesthattheimagerymayhaveresulted from “eine ‘Kontamination’ der (drei oder)zweiTeile des Tempelhauses...mitdendreiHöfen des ganzen Tempelbezirks”(Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ,Schenke’semphases).RewolinskipointsoutthattheJerusalemtemplehadthree“courts”and tranlatesⲏⲉⲓin this sense (see Rewolinski, “Sacramental Language,” ).609TheterminologyusedinHebisnotthesameasinthispassageinGos.

Phil., see fig. .613Now, how are we to understandGos. Phil.’s use of this temple sim-ile? As usual inGos. Phil., the target input of this metaphorical blend isleft unstated. It has been assumed by most scholars that the three housesof the temple here represent successive sacramental stages.614This viewis suggested by the fact that the first house is identified with baptism.To read the other two houses as representing sacraments, however, thenrequires the direct identification in this passage of the terms “redemp-tion” (ⲥⲱⲧⲉ)and“bridalchamber”(ⲛⲩⲙⲫⲱⲛ) with sacraments,615butsuch an identification is problematic. It has usually been supported byreference to the famous list of five terms inGos. Phil. .–, whichincludestheterms“bridalchamber”(ⲛⲩⲙⲫⲱⲛ)and“redemption”(ⲥⲱⲧⲉ)in addition to “baptism” (ⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁ), “chrism” (ⲭⲣⲓⲥⲙⲁ), and “Eucharist”(ⲉⲩⲭⲁⲣⲓⲥⲧⲓⲁ),butaswehaveseen,itdoesnotseemlikelythatthislistin fact refers to five sacraments. Moreover, as Segelberg has noted withregard to the temple metaphor, “The question may be asked as to whyonly three sacraments are thought of in this context. Why not build fiveroomsinthetempleatJerusalemwhentheargumentatanyrateinvolvesthe alteration of its actual structure?”616Why not indeed? The fact that610Heb :.611Heb :.612Heb :.613For a similar illustration, see Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, .

Baptism is identified as “the holy house” (ⲡⲏⲉⲓ ⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ), but theother two “houses” do not need to be interpreted as rituals. Instead Iwould argue that they are better understood as references to succes-sively important aspects of baptism, an interpretation that works fromtheimageryofthethreehousesbeingwithineachotherandbeingofsuc-cessively greater importance and mystery. Rather than representing suc-cessiverites,thehousesmayrepresentsuccessivelevelsofsignificance,orsuccessive realities, one within the other, in three levels. At the primarylevelthereistheritualactofbaptism,representedastheholyhouse.Sinceoneisredeemedthroughbaptism,redemptioncouldbesaidtoconstitutethedeepersignificanceofbaptism,andhenceberepresentedas“theholyoftheholy”(ⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ̄ⲙⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ),whichishiddenwithin“theholy.”Asfor “the bridal chamber” (ⲡⲛⲩⲙⲫⲱⲛ), we have already seen that the join-ingoftheLogosandtheHolySpirit,ChristandChristian,soulandspirit,are aspects of, at least, the rituals of chrismation and Eucharist, and maybe described metaphorically in terms of marriage-related imagery likethe “bridalchamber.”If “baptism” ishere to be understood as baptism inwater and chrism,617the “bridal chamber” fits nicely into the scheme asthehighesthiddenrealityofthatritualprocess.Thewholedescriptionofthelayoutofthetemplemaythusberegardedasametaphoricaldescrip-tion of the effects of the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan, and by extensionthat of each individual Christian initiate, comprising the closely associ-ated ritual acts of baptism and chrismation.But what are we to make of the latter part of the passage, whichdescribes baptism as containing the resurrection “[in the] redemption”([ϩ̄ⲙⲡ]ⲥⲱⲧⲉ), and the latter again as being “in the bridal chamber”(ϩ̄ⲙⲡⲛⲩⲙⲫⲱⲛ)?Aswehaveseen,Gos.Phil.holdsresurrectiontobeoneofthe important effects bestowed by means of the initiatory rituals. It maythus be argued that resurrection is an aspect of the redemptive functionofbaptism.Baptismmaythereforebesaidtocontaintheresurrection“[inchrism, and Eucharist, or, alternatively, thatⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁis to be understood as referring tobaptismandchrism,andⲥⲱⲧⲉtoEucharistandredemption(seeSchenke,DasPhilippus-Evangelium, ).617Cf.

In that case redemption may clearly be understood as an effectresiding in the body of Christ, both in terms of his soteriological work,and in terms of the soteriological potentiality residing in the eucharisticelements.618Another interesting aspect of this description of the temple is thefocus on the facing of the doors in the three “houses.” It is said thatthe first one faces west, the second south, and the third east, but whatmay be the significance of these directions? April DeConick suggeststhat the directions “may reflect the geography of heavenly journeys inJewish apocalyptic literature where the hero often visited the farthestcorners of the world and heaven,”619but there are other possibilities thatseem more intuitively relevant in the present context. The outermosthouse,thatofbaptism,faceswest.Now,theterm“west,”ⲁⲙⲛⲧⲉ,inCopticalso denotes the underworld or death, denotations that resonate withbaptismal interpretations having in some way to do with death. Sincethe interpretation of the descent into the baptismal waters as a descentinto death is rejected inGos. Phil.infavourofseeingtheritualaslife-giving,620we may perhaps instead regard the western door as signifyingthe entry into the holy housefromthe realm of death, that is, one passesfrom death and into life as one enters into the baptismal rite.621The innermost house, however, “the holy of the holies” (ⲡⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ̄ⲛⲛⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ)or“thebridalchamber”(ⲡⲛⲩⲙⲫⲱⲛ), is open towards theeast. This direction has several relevant connotations. For one thing,618TheidentificationofthebodyofJesuswiththetempleisofcoursealsofoundinJohn:,whichisclosetootherpassagesalludedtoinGos.Phil.(Forthebodyasatemple,seealso Cor:–; :; Eph:–). AsLars Koen notes, “That theincarnate Christiscalled ‘temple’ is a standing term in the eastern fathers from Origen and onward” (LarsKoen,TheSavingPassion:IncarnationalandSoteriologicalThoughtinCyrilofAlexandria’sCommentary on the Gospel According to St. John[Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis: StudiaDoctrinae Christianae Upsaliensia ; Uppsala: Almqvist & Wiksell, ], ).619DeConick, “Entering God’s Presence,” –.620See discussion above.621In this sense one might also metonymically conceive of the baptistry as this “holyhouse” (ⲡⲏⲉⲓⲉⲧⲟⲩⲁⲁⲃ)."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philip“east” (ⲁⲉⲓⲃⲧⲉ) is the direction of paradise and may thus point in thedirection ofGos.

Segelberg, “Sacramental System”; Tripp, “Sacramental System”; Gaffron,Studien; Sevrin, “Pratique et doctrine”; Rewolinski, “Sacramental Language”; Pagels,“Ritual.”632Schenke, for instance, has come to the conclusion that the phrase refers to fivesacraments,whichheseesasconstituentpartsofaritualofinitiation,that“sindbegründetin der Taufe Jesu, in der Verleihung des Geistesanunddurchihn, in der Einsetzung derEucharistie, in seiner Kreuzigung und in seiner Auferstehung” (Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ).

ThatGos. Phil.presupposes the ritual actions of baptism, chrismation, and Eucharistis, however, quite clear. It is now time to summarise what we may sayconcerningthepracticeandinterpretationoftherituals underlyingGos.Phil., on the basis of the present analysis.....Baptism and ChrismationGos. Phil. spends much time on questions relating to the interpretationof baptism and chrismation. The interpretation given byGos. Phil.oftheseritualactsisaswehaveseenprofoundlytiedupwithitsviewsonthe baptism of Jesus in the Jordan. It is this paradigmatic event, coupledwith the blend the christian is a christ, which guides the tractate’sinterpretation of the baptism of the individual Christian initiate, notonly the process Christ himself went through, but also his baptismalpreparations, like forinstance hisact of emptying the water ofdeath andmaking baptism life-giving.As for the exact ritual procedure, however, it is taken for granted andnot described.Inorder to glean someinsights into the actual ritual prac-tice underlyingGos. Phil.’s discourse on the sacraments, we are there-fore in most cases left having to decide to what degree the metaphoricaldescriptionsoftheritesaretobeunderstoodmetonymically.Withregardthe four possibilities were: i) as a six-phase programme: mystery + baptism + chrism+ Eucharist + redemption + bride-chamber; ii) as a five-phase programme, the wholebeing a “mystery”: baptism + chrism + Eucharist + redemption + bride-chamber; iii) asa three-phase programme, or mystery, consisting of baptism + chrism + Eucharist, thewhole process being characterized as an act of redemption, and as constituting the sceneof spiritual marriage; or iv) as a three-phase programme, or mystery, consisting of bap-tism + chrism + Eucharist, baptism and chrism together being alternatively describedas “redemption” and the Eucharist as “bride-chamber” (see Tripp, “Sacramental System,”). As we shall see, however, these four alternatives do not exhaust the possible inter-pretations of the sentence. Rewolinski has argued that asGos. Phil.presentsbaptism,chrismation, and Eucharist, “the context which immediately suggests itself is that of ini-tiation. The entire ritual is designated under the term of the bridal chamber” (Rewolin-ski, “Sacramental Language,” ). Thomassen sees initiation as the focus and has linkedbaptism and chrism closely together as one sacrament, while seeing the “bridal cham-ber” and the “redemption” as aspects or summaries of that ritual (see Thomassen, “Not‘In a Mystery’”). Thomassen has suggested elsewhere that the reason why “redemption”and“bridal chamber”havebeen “addedtothelistof ritual acts in :–” maybe“thefact that the set of physically performed ritual acts is there not distinguished from thenumber of components in the redemptive process symbolically contained in these acts”(Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, )."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philiptobaptism,abouttheonlydirectdescriptionofpracticeisthereferencetogoing down to the water (ⲃⲱⲕⲉⲡⲉⲥⲏⲧⲉⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩ)andcomingup(ⲉⲓⲉϩⲣⲁ ̈ⲓ)again,635and the tractate’s reference to a person who “going down intothe water he strips himself naked” (ⲉϥⲃⲏⲕⲉⲡⲓⲧ̄ⲛⲉⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩϣⲁϥⲕⲁⲕϥⲁϩⲏⲩ)in order to put on “the living man” (ⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉⲉⲧⲟⲛϩ).636The rest are moreor less metonymically based metaphorical descriptions that have mostlyto do with ritual effects, rather than ritual acts.Gos. Phil.’s use of the metaphor of dyeing, for instance, may indicatethatthetractatepresupposesabaptismalriteinvolvingfullimmersion,637but there is no way we can actually be sure of this. Similarly, althoughmetaphors involving garments are pervasive inGos. Phil., there is noway we can know whether the underlying rites actually involved ritualdressing in baptismal robes after emersion from the baptismal water.638It does seem likely, however, from the description referred to aboveconcerning stripping oneself naked when going down to the water inorder to put on the living man, that these metaphors are to some degreemetonymically motivated and that the rituals actually involved somekind of ritual dressing in baptismal robes.639Baptism is associated with putting on the body of “the living man,”with rebirth, and with resurrection. While the putting on of the livingman is most easily mapped onto either the immersion in water or thepostbaptismal donning of robes, it would seem that the moment ofrebirth and resurrection is most easily mapped onto the emersion fromthe water.We have seen thatGos. Phil. interprets baptism in profoundly life-giving terms using metaphors of begetting, rebirth, and resurrection,while rejecting an interpretation of the immersion in the baptismalwaters as a descent into death. The fact that the text stresses the rejec-tion of the latter interpretation probably indicates that this was a currentand well-known interpretation at the time. The tractate’s use of canoni-calScripturethroughout,includingRomans,asclearlyauthoritativetextsindicates thatGos. Phil. is not engaged in any direct polemic against635Gos. Phil. .. Cf.

The relationship between baptismand chrismation inGos. Phil. is an interesting one. Does the tractatepresuppose a prebaptismal or postbaptismal chrismation? Scholars havecome to different conclusions. Tripp, for example, thinks that the chris-mation took place after the ascent from the water and “Perhaps after alongintervalforinstruction.”641Aswehaveseenfromtheanalysisabove,chrismation is inGos. Phil. treated as being intimately connected withbaptisminwater,anditmayseemmostlikelythatittookplacewhilethe person being initiated was still standing in the water, or that it wasclosely connected to the emersion from the water. There is no indica-tion inGos. Phil. that baptism in water and chrismation were separatedin time, and several indications that they took place more or less simul-taneously. Perhaps the clearest indication of this is the mirror-and-lightmetaphor andthestatement ofthe necessityof“baptising” inbothwaterand chrism.642The dyeing metaphor is another indication, if we mapGod’scolours/remediesontothechrism,andtheexampleswehaveseenof the effects of the chrismation being referred to as taking place priorto the ascent from the baptismal waters, like for instance the receptionof the name, is yet another. WhileGos. Phil.makesitabundantlyclearthat the chrism is of higher importance than the water, what is said byGos. Phil. concerning the relationship between baptism and chrismationalso stresses the necessity of both baptism in water and anointing withchrism and the close connection between the two. Moreover, the closeconnectionwehaveseenbetweenthechrismandtheresurrectionmakesan association between the chrismation and emersion from the water alogical possibility.We also have indications that this chrismation was accompanied by aTrinitarianformulaandthesignofthecross,643andthecloseconnection640For the view thatGos.

Phil.’s metaphorical references to the chrismation, it wouldalso seem probable that the ointment used for this rite contained somekind of scented olive oil.644As for the interpretation of the chrismation,Gos. Phil. connects Jesus’ baptismal chrismation with the joining ofthe Logos and the Holy Spirit, which is also referred to in terms of a“bridalchamber.”Insummary,theeffectsthatGos.Phil.seemtoassociatewith the chrismation are the reception of the name, the putting on oflight, a begetting, becoming a Christ/perfect man, the reception of theresurrection in this life which makes postmortem resurrection possible,the reception of the Holy Spirit, and a unification of Logos and HolySpirit, or perhaps Logos-like soul and Holy Spirit/angel.....EucharistTheEucharistpresupposedbyGos.Phil.seemstoinvolvetheuseofbread(ⲟⲉⲓⲕ)andamixedcup(ⲡⲟⲧⲏⲣⲓⲟⲛ)ofwine(ⲏⲣⲡ)andwater(ⲙⲟⲟⲩ).645Thebread is as we have seen identified as the flesh of Jesus, which is furtheridentified as the Logos, while the content of the cup is identified with644See,e.g.,Schenke,DasPhilippus-Evangelium,(whoalsoholdsthattheointmentconsisted of oil and wine), and Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, . Isenberg, Schenke,and Thomassen have argued on the basis of the fire-symbolism associated with thechrism inGos. Phil. that the chrism might have been heated (see Isenberg, “CopticGospel,” ; Isenberg, “Introduction,” ; Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ;Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, ). There is little reason to suppose that this wasthe case, however, since the connection between fire and chrism does not presupposeheated chrism. There is for example a metonymic relationship between the chrism andfire and light since olive oil was not only used for the chrism, but also as fuel forlamps (cf. Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium,  n. ). Lamps burn oil and therebycreate light, and we have seen that the motif of lighting lamps is used inGos. Phil.in relation to the chrism. The connection between fire and chrism may also simplyderive from the connection between the chrism and the Holy Spirit (cf. Schenke,DasPhilippus-Evangelium, ), since the connection between the fire and the Holy Spirit isa common one (see, e.g., Brock,Holy Spirit, –). Thomassen suggests on the basis ofthe description of the eschatological chrismation with light inGos. Phil. .– thatthe chrism “was probably poured over the initiate ..., rather than just applied by hand”(Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, ). It should be noted, however, that the phraseϩⲁⲧⲉⲉⲃⲟⲗⲉϫ̄ⲛ-isinthispassageappliedtotheflowingoutoflightandisnotdirectlyusedasa description of chrismation.645Cf.Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed,.

The blood points outto us the Word, for as rich blood the Word has been infused into life; and the unionof both is the Lord, the food of babes—the Lord who is Spirit and Word” (Clement,Paed. I...; translation from Maxwell E.

Thus, Clement parallelsGos. Phil.inhisidentification of the Holy Spirit and the Logos with the flesh and blood of Christ. Hecomes, however, to the complete opposite conclusion as to which is which. While, as wehaveseen,Gos.Phil.identifiesthefleshwiththeLogosandthebloodwiththeHolySpirit,Clement in this figurative interpretation has it vice versa.647Gos. Phil. .. Cf.

There has been considerable disagreement among these scholarswith regard to the nature of the sacrament, however, both with regardto its ritual enactment and its interpretation.At the literal end of the spectrum it has been argued that the “bridalchamber” ritual involved a human couple having actual sexual inter-course.655This suggestion has most recently been reiterated by AprilDeConick,656who in her interpretation couples a theory of “Valentini-anism”withanexceedinglyliteralinterpretationofthe“bridalchamber”inGos. Phil. DeConick claims that the “spiritual marriage” advocated byGos.

According to DeConick, procreation of “spiritual children” in thisway contributed towards salvation for the “Valentinians” by incarnatingspiritual seed needing to be perfected in the material world.657Also at the literal end of the scale, Michael Williams has come toa conclusion that is in a sense both related and contrary to that ofDeConick. He is in agreement with DeConick and others who hold the“bridalchamber”toreferliterallytoamarriageoftwohumanbeings,andhas argued that “the mystery of marriage” referred to inGos. Phil.“wasactedoutconcretelybycoupleswhowerelivingtogether.”658Contraryto655See, e.g., Buckley, “Cult-Mystery”; Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley, “‘The Holy Spirit’ is aDoubleName,”inFemale Fault and Fulfilment in Gnosticism(SR;ChapelHill:Universityof North Carolina Press, ), –; Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley, “‘The Holy Spirit isaDoubleName’:HolySpirit,Mary,andSophiaintheGospel of Philip,” inImages of theFeminine in Gnosticism(ed.KarenL.King;SAC;Philadelphia:FortressPress,),;Buckley, “Conceptual Models,” .

Inthis way, the pre-existentpneumaticseed would be drawn down from the heavens aboveto sojourn on earth. Here it would mature and finally be harvested at death.

Elaine Pagels for example, even though she insists uponcalling it “a secret Gnostic sacrament,” admits that it may have served afunctionsimilartothat ofa“mainstream” ChristianEucharist.662Othershave gone further in this direction and actually identified the “bridalchamber” directly with Christian ritual practice,663like the Eucharist,664or baptism and/or anointing.665Some have preferred to see “the bridalchamber” as specifically the “inward and hidden aspect” of the ritual,ratherthananyspecificritualinitself.Onthisviewthe“bridalchamber”is not a replacement for baptism, chrism, or Eucharist, nor is it a ritualin addition to these, but instead a term covering the real significance orhidden meaning of any or all of them.Due to the highly allusive nature of the mystagogical discourses inGos.

Another explanation that emerges from the analysisofGos.Phil.presentedinthepresentstudyisthatthereisinfactno“exactmeaning” of the concept of“bridal chamber”to be foundinthis tractate.666See Rewolinski, “Sacramental Language,” . There have indeed been many at-temptstoanalyseGos.Phil.’s“bridalchamber”referencesalongsuchlines.AsDavidTripphasnoted,“Irenaeus’accountoffollowers(apparently)ofMarcus,andso,itseems,oftheValentinian school who had special rites ofredemptioandsponsale cubiculum...couldencouragetheviewthatthesetermswhenfoundin‘Philip’shouldrefertodistinctritesoftheinitiatoryscheme”(Tripp,“SacramentalSystem,”).Trippconcluded,however,that“Irenaeus’s supposed scheme is not found here” (ibid., ).

Moreover, the statement thatif one reaps in the winter/world one will not be able to reap in thesummer/other world seems first and foremost to be an admonition notto try to reap any rewards, or pray for anything, in the material world.667Thomassenhassuggestedaconnectionherewiththeuseofthemetaphorofsowingand reaping in Fragments – by Heracleon (as reported by Origen,Comm.

Phil.seemsinfactnotonlytobeverykeento contrast Christian initiation with Jewish proselyte initiation, but evento presuppose a hierarchical community organisation.Gos. Phil.high-lights important differencesbetween Judaism andChristianity having todo with differences in ritual enactment and efficacy. Some of these dif-ferences are, as we have seen, described metaphorically in terms of pro-creation and creation. The tractate points out that the result of a Hebrewcreating a Hebrew is a proselyte, and that this proselyte cannot himselfcreateproselytes.TheJewsarealsopresentedashavingonlyamotherandno father. The metaphors employed highlight both similarities and dif-ferences between Judaism andChristianity, with regard toritual process,efficacy,andsubsequentmembershipstatusoftheinitiated.Thedescrip-tion of the Hebrews’ creation of proselytes can be understood as a refer-ence to Jewish proselyte initiation. One of the main target domains forthe procreation- and kinship-metaphors discussed above thus seems toberitualinitiation.Thatis,Gos.Phil.contrastsritualinitiationintoChris-tianity with ritual initiation of proselytes into Judaism. Ritual initiationwasrequiredofnon-JewsseekingtobecomeJews,butapartfromcircum-cision in the case of males, no initiatory rituals were required of thosewho were born of Jewish parents. Moreover, asGos.

The target input for the father-metaphor in this contrasting func-tion in relation to Judaism may be understood as the one who adminis-ters the ritual process of rebirth, i.e., the ritual officiant. While the offi-ciant administering the Christian rites of initiation is metaphorically afatherwhobegetssons,theJewishofficiantadministeringtheJewishritesofproselyteinitiationismetaphoricallyanartisanwhocreatesproselytes.Contrary to Segelberg, neither Jewish proselyte initiation nor Chris-tian initiation seems to have been self-administered. The differencesdelineated byGos. Phil. seem rather to imply that both Jewish proselytebaptism and Christian initiation involved the agency of a ritual officiantof some sort.Gos. Phil. infers from the inferior status of the proselyte inrelation to full-blown Jews that the Jewish officiants do not, metaphor-ically speaking, have proper “procreative” powers, but only the powersof an artisan.Gos.Phil.canconsequentlydescribeChristianinitiationintermsofabiologicalprocessofbegettingandbirth,withtheofficiantasa father, and Jewish proselyte initiation as mere creation (see fig. ).675673For a discussion of the inferior status of proselytes in relation to those who wereJews by birth, see, e.g., Cohen,Beginnings of Jewishness, –.674As Thomas M. Finn states it, “To the outsider, the convert became a Jew.

See also Cohen,Beginnings of Jewishness, –.675The description of proselyte initiation in late antique Judaism as a kind of creationis indeed also attested by some rabbinic sources, most notablyGenesis Rabbah.

In this case, the passage may be understood christologically, toimply that since he makes the bread and the cup holy, then it followsthat he also sanctified his assumed material body.695In accordance withPhilippus-Evangelium,.Theuseofexactlythetermϫⲓanditsdualmeaningof“receive”and “take” seems to be rhetorically important both here and elsewhere inGos.

This network creates inferences that are not only projectedback onto the input of the Christian, but also the other way around, sothattheChristian’sownexperiencestructureshisknowledgeandunder-standing of Christ. Thus, in this two-way relation, the Christian’s under-standing of the rituals is structured by his or her knowledge of Christ,including the scriptural descriptions of Christ’s baptism, while at thesame time the Christian’s experience of his or her own participation intherituals,i.e.,hisorherownbaptism,likewisestructuresandenrichesthis person’s knowledge about Christ’s baptism, both supplementing andstructuring the person’s understanding of the scriptural descriptions ofthis event.Through the use of intricate conceptual and intertextual blends,Gos.Phil. describes the process of Christ’s (double) birth, life, death, andresurrection, and the connections between his experiences and actionsand those of the individual initiated Christian. The emphasis inGos.Phil. is, however, clearly not on Christ becoming human (there is nodiscernible doctrine ofkenosishere), but rather on the deification, or“christification,”sotospeak,oftheChristian.Byshowingtheparallelismsbetween the actions, experiences, and constitution of Christ, and theritual actions performed and experienced by the Christians,Gos. Phil.maps out the way to salvation by means of the appropriation of divinelife obtained by becoming like Christ according to the example set byhim, as laid down in Scripture and ritual. Often passages inGos.

Phil.’s rhetoric, but the crucifixion and transfigurationseem to be of at least equal significance, aspects that have in fact largelybeen overlooked in previous scholarship.

Phil.containsmate-rial from several different “Gnostic” groups,725andthatit“cannotbetraced back to, or identified with, a particular Valentinian school,”726some scholars have tried to locate the text more precisely. Roelof vanden Broek, following Jean-Daniel Kaestli,727has characterisedGos. Phil.as belonging to the Eastern branch of “Valentinianism” on the groundsof its Christology. Whereas the “Western” branch of “Valentinianism” issupposed to have held that Christ’s body was of a psychic substance, the“EasternValentinians”aresupposedtohavetaughtthatChristhadaspir-itual body, which is what van den Broek finds inGos.

I have not assumed from the outset thatGos.Phil. is “Gnostic” or “Valentinian” and have therefore not read “Gnostic”or “Valentinian” myth or theology into it. Instead I have attempted towork my way out from the poetics of the text itself, as it has come downto us in its Coptic Nag Hammadi Codex II incarnation, to an evalua-tion of its doctrinal contents.731Another major implication of labellingGos.

Phil. .– which is also attested in Fragments – by Heracleon as reportedby Origen; and possible echoes of the fragments of Valentinus as quoted by Clementof Alexandria and Hippolytus (see Thomassen, “How Valentinian,” –). None oftheseargumentsarepersuasive,however.A“soteriologyofmutualparticipation”isforinstance something we find in prominent orthodox Christian sources of the fourth andfifth centuries (see, e.g., Athanasius and Cyril of Alexandria), and the same can of coursebe said with regard toGos.Phil.’s“relativelyoptimisticcosmology.”Moreover, thesowingand reaping metaphor is used differently inGos. Phil. than in the Heracleon fragmentsand as for the other features brought forward by Thomassen we find closer parallelselsewhere.731As Rewolinski has rightly emphasised in a critique of what he sees as Sevrin’smethod of first constructing a theory of “Valentinianism” and then reading it intoGos.Phil., “We must first attempt to glean what can be gleaned from the GPh itself and onlythenturntowardsthecomparativeapproachwhichwasSevrin’sfirststepinhisexegeticalprocedure” (Rewolinski, “Sacramental Language,” ).732GeraldLeoBorchert,“InsightsIntotheGnosticThreattoChristianityasGainedThrough the Gospel of Philip,” inNew Dimensions in New Testament Study(ed.

Phil.that “it appears outwardly ‘Church Christian,’ but within the frameworkofthetextasawholeitismanifestlygnostic.”736Isenberg providesus with another example, stating that, “since ‘Christian’ in the gnosticglossarynormallydesignatesthepsychicratherthanthepneumatic,Gos.Phil. is offering the psychic the chance to rise to the pneumatic level—by sacramental means.”737SeeingGos.

Isenberg dismisses the fact thatGos. Phil.doesnotmention“psychics”or“pneumatics,”orindeedanytripartitedivisionof humanity, with the understatement that “the tripartite division ofhumanity—fleshly, psychic, pneumatic—is not emphasised.”738Based on the premise thatGos. Phil.is“Valentinian,”andonwhathe perceives as its many parallels with “Catholic” Christian practice aswe know it from patristic sources, David Tripp asserts that the tractate“belongs to a Valentinian tradition still in close, if not amicable, contactwith‘Catholic’Christians.”739Tripp also suggests thatGos.Phil.“belongsto a time when some Christians did not anoint,” but holds that “somewhom later Catholics could recognize as orthodox” must have done so,“for if the usage had been always a Valentinian or otherwise sectarianpeculiarityitcouldhardlyhavewonacceptanceinCatholicchurches.”740But what ifGos.

Here Chrysostom refers toCor:inordertoexplainthesignificanceofthisparticularliturgicalpractice.

Thus our souls boundunto each other. And therefore when we return after an absence we kisseach other, our souls hastening unto mutual intercourse.(Hom. Cor., .;NPNF1)Chrysostom then continues by setting up a metaphorical blend betweenthe body of the Christian and a temple, and in the process connects theritual kiss to the Eucharist. According to Chrysostom,we are the temple of Christ; we kiss then the porch and entrance of thetemple when we kiss each other. See ye not how many kiss even theporch of this temple, some stooping down, others grasping it with theirhand, and putting their hand to their mouth. And through these gatesanddoorsChristbothhadenteredintous,anddothenter,whensoeverwecommunicate. Ye who partake of the mysteries understand what I say.743(Hom. Cor., .;NPNF1)ThereisnothinginGos.Phil.’sallusionstotheritualkissthatwouldseemto be fundamentally at odds with the kind of practice or interpretationof it Chrysostom gives here.744Grant claimed that the “Valentinians” he saw behindGos. Phil.“weremaking use of Christian materials but were exaggerating some elementsandneglectingothers.Theywerelayingunusualemphasisontheunique-ly Christian doctrine of the union of Christ with his Church and were‘literalizing’ the metaphors used by the Christians.”745From the present742See, e.g., L.

Phil. conform to preconceptions of it being an aberrationin early Christianity, however. There has also been a strong tendencytowards allegorising its metaphors and similes in conformity with theo-riesof“Gnostic,”andespecially“Valentinian,”teaching.Thus,aswehaveseen, rather than, e.g., treating Joseph as Joseph, he has been interpretedasrepresentingthe“Valentinian”Demiurge,referencestotheHolySpirithave been taken to refer to Sophia, and the serpent in paradise has beenequated withIaldabaoth.

Phil.inSyria,747with the main argument being its explicit discussions of certainSyriac terms. As Kendrick Grobel put it in his review of Wilson’s editionof the text,Why the interest in Syriac?

Of course a Syriac original and a Greek versionmayhavebeenusedtogether...748Although few scholars have actually argued that the text was most likelycomposed in Syriac,749many have held the presence of discussions ofSyriac words in the text to indicate a probable origin in Syria.750Themajority of those who have placedGos. Phil. in Syria on such groundshave held it to have been written in Greek in a Greek-Syriac bilingualmilieu, Antioch or Edessa being the favoured locations.751However,Gos.Phil. in fact not only discusses the meaning of words in“Syriac”(̄ⲙ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲧⲥⲩⲣⲟⲥ),butalsomentionsexplicitlythelanguages“Hebrew”747See, e.g., Segelberg, “Antiochene Background”; Eric Segelberg, “The AntiocheneOriginofthe‘GospelofPhilip’,”BSAC(–):–;Ménard,“Beziehungen”;Isenberg, “Coptic Gospel,” –; Isenberg, “Introduction,” , ; Schenke,DasPhilippus-Evangelium,;Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, ; Schmid,Die Eucharistie,.748Grobel, review of Wilson, .

Phil. feels the need to discuss the meaning ofcertain words in these languages would rather indicate that at least thesepartsofthetractatewerenotactuallycomposedinanyofthem.Themostprobable setting for such a discussion would rather seem to be a Coptic-speaking one.754In a Coptic text directed to a Coptic audience it is quiteappropriatetodiscussthemeaningofcertainwordsoftheologicalimpor-tance in Syriac, Hebrew, and Greek.Moreover, as Grobel and others have rightly noted, the presence ofGreek words does not indicate a Greek original,755nor, necessarily, doesthe identification of possible wordplays or catchword connections in thehypothetical Greek original. Such features do not necessarily indicateanything more than that the tractate makes use of ideas or sources thatmay have originated in Greek- or Syriac-speaking milieus.756There doesnot seem to be any hard evidence, then, thatGos. Phil. cannot have beencomposed in Coptic in the first place. A Coptic-speaking milieu wouldalso seem to be indicated by the Coptic wordplays we have discussedat several points in the analyses above, which would seem to indicatethat even ifGos. Phil. was indeed in the main translated from a Greekoriginal or originals, which it might well have been, substantial changesweremadeinitstranslationintoCopticand/orinitssubsequentCopticphase(s) of transmission.

As we have seen,the chrismation presupposed byGos. Phil.doesnotseemtobeapre-baptismal one, and there is no evidence for a postbaptismal anointingin Syria in the pre-Nicene period.767So, perhapsGos. Phil. is not of Syr-ian provenance,768nor Egyptian, after all? It is important to remember,however, that we are here speaking about the pre-Nicene period.

Phil.may“reflectanearlier Syrian practice than those third century texts that attest the order anointing-baptism” (Thomassen,The Spiritual Seed, ), but does not consider the possibility thatit may reflect Syrian practice of the fourth or fifth century.771See M.E. Johnson, “Baptism as ‘New Birth’.”772M.E. Johnson, “Baptism as ‘New Birth’,” –. Moreover, as Paul Bradshaw haspointed out, “we cannot really speak of two principal liturgical traditions in the earlyChurch—Eastern and Western—but should rather acknowledge that there was instead avariety of local practices” (Bradshaw, “Baptismal Practice,” ).773See Bradshaw,Search for the Origins, .774See Isenberg, “Coptic Gospel,” ; cf.

Acknowledgingthe fact that the codices and their place of discovery constitute the onlycertain historical context we have with regard to the texts contained inthem, and the fact that the language of these codices is Coptic, fourth–fifth-century Egypt would seem to present itself as a rather obvious con-text within which to study them. It is therefore all the more surprisingthatcomparisonsofNagHammaditextswithissuesthatwerecurrentinfourth-century Egyptian Christianity and Coptic sources have been fewand far between in Nag Hammadi scholarship.Scholarly interpretations ofGos. Phil. illustrate the point. They havefocussed not so much on trying to understand the text that has actuallybeen preserved in Nag Hammadi Codex II, but rather on a text wein fact do not have, namely its hypothetical Greek original supposedlywritten – years earlier. Since scholars have had this focus, thechronological spotlight has been pointed primarily at the second andthird century, rather than at the fourth or early fifth. That is not to saythat fourth-century contexts have not been invoked to shed light onthe codices and those who manufactured and used them. This has infactbeenanissueofdebatesincetheverybeginningofNagHammadiresearch.778Whathashardlybeendoneatall,however,istointerpretthe textsfrom such a perspective, and to use comparative material fromthe Egyptian milieu contemporary with the manuscripts to shed lighton their contents.

About the only thing we may saywith certainty is that the picture is very diverse indeed. The fourthand fifth centuries were rife with doctrinal debate, and it was a timeof major ecumenical councils delineating the boundaries of acceptedScripture, doctrine and practice. Moreover, in contrast to the situationwith regard to the preceding centuries, there is an abundance of sourcesavailable to us from this period, making a thorough comparative studyoftheNag Hammadi textswithinthecontextoffourthandfifth-centuryEgypt anything but a trivial undertaking. There are, to put it bluntly,quite a few Egyptian fourth-century contexts to choose from.780As wesaw in chapter , however, it is possible to single out one particularcontextwhichseemsespeciallyrelevantwithregardtotheNagHammadicodices, namely monasticism. Since the manuscripts were discoveredin the vicinity of the sites of several Pachomian monasteries, in anarea where also so-called “Melitian” and other monastic groups andindividuals were active, and also not far from the location of Shenoute’smonastic community, the potential relevance of a monastic context forthe Nag Hammadi texts should be apparent.781Moreover, when we, asoutlined above, disregard the category of “Gnosticism,” “burdened as itis with misleading stereotype and confusion,”782and reconsider thesewritings as constituent parts of early Christianity, a fourth- or fifth-century contextualisation ofGos.Phil.nolongerneedstobeapproachedfromthepointofviewofasimpledichotomybetweentheNagHammaditexts as simply representatives of heresy on the one hand, and sourcesthat have customarily been classified as belonging on the right side ofthe orthodoxy/heresy divide on the other.

In his entry on the text in theAnchor BibleDictionaryhe states that it was “very likely a translation of an original Greek document”(Isenberg, “Philip, Gospel of,” ). Schenke simply states that “Die uns in einer Kopieerhaltene koptische Fassung des EvPhil dürfte—wie es für die koptische Literatur dieRegel ist—eine Übersetzung aus dem Griechischen darstellen. Und das Griechische istdann wohl auch als die Ursprache, in der das EvPhil abgefaßt worden ist, anzusehen”(Schenke,Das Philippus-Evangelium, ).

Why the translationprocess would have had to take so long is somewhat mysterious to thepresent author,butitisanimplicit argumentthat hasoftenbeen used byscholarstomovetheterminusantequemforthesupposedGreekoriginalback into the third century.Let us take a closer look at the arguments that have been broughtforward in favour of a Greek original. First there is the argument fromthe Greek words used in the tractate. Walter Till pointed to the fact thatGos.Phil.inmanyinstancesusesGreekwordsevenincaseswhereequallygoodCopticoneswerereadilyavailable, likeforinstanceitsuseinmanyinstances ofⲇⲓⲁ ⲧⲟⲩⲧⲟinstead ofⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓ,andⲁⲗⲏⲑⲉⲓⲁinstead ofⲙⲉ.FromthisTilldrewtheconclusionthattheoriginaldocumentmusthavebeen composed in Greek.785This is, however, an argument that flies inthe face of the evidence we have of indigenous Sahidic Coptic writingsof the period roughly contemporary with the Nag Hammadi Codices. Aquick glance at the writings of Shenoute, for instance, which constitutethelargestcorpusofindigenousSahidictexts,showsquiteclearlythathedidnothesitatetouseGreekexpressionsevenwhenequallygoodCopticones could have been used.786The second argument, also used by Till, has to do with the fact thattheNewTestamentquotationsinGos.Phil.inseveral casesdiverge fromthe wording of the “standard” Sahidic New Testament, especially withregard to the use of Greek or Coptic words. Till mentions in partic-ular the quotation of Matt : whereGos. Phil.usestheGreekwordⲁⲝⲉⲓⲛⲏ787ratherthantheCopticⲕⲉⲗⲉⲃⲓⲛwhichisusedintheSahidicNewTestament.788There are several problems with this argument, however.Firstly, we do not have any manuscript attestation for Coptic New Testa-ment translations prior to the fourth century, and it is only from the latefourth and into the fifth century that there is any substantial manuscriptattestation for most of the New Testament texts, and even from thisperiod the evidence represents a variety of dialects and independent785See Till,DasEvangeliumnachPhilippos,.SeealsoIsenberg,“CopticGospel,”–; Stroud, “Problem of Dating,” . It should be noted, however, thatGos. Phil.doesnot exclusively employ these Greek terms, but that it also uses the native Coptic termsⲉⲧⲃⲉⲡⲁⲉⲓandⲙⲉ.786See also the refutation of this argument in Giversen,Filipsevangeliet, ; Grobel,review of Wilson, .787SeeGos.

Our knowledge of the early translations of theNew Testament into Coptic is far too incomplete to allow us to arguethat differences from the known Sahidic translations of Matthew inGos.Phil.’s quotations of the New Testament imply a Greek original. Anotherpossibility could be a Coptic-Greek bilingual author writing in Copticwho used the Greek New Testament, rather than any specific Coptictranslation of it, and rendered his quotations and paraphrases in Copticas he saw fit, or the word may have been changed fromⲕⲉⲗⲉⲃⲓⲛtoⲁⲝⲉⲓⲛⲏat some point in the transmission of the Coptic text.792In any case, theuse of a Greek word rather than its Coptic equivalent can hardly be usedto prove a Greek original forGos. Phil.Till also argued for a Greek original on the basis of the idea seeninGos. Phil. .– that Adam came into being from two virgins,namelyfrom“thespirit”(ⲡ̄ⲡ̄̄ⲛ̄ⲁ)and“thevirginearth”(ⲡⲕⲁϩ̄ⲙⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ).The text must have been composed in Greek, Till claims, since “earth”789SeeWisse,“TheCopticVersions,” .On theCopticNewTestament manuscripts,see also Metzger,The Early Versions, –.790Wisse, “The Coptic Versions,” . Tito Orlandi notes that, “a translation mayhave been conceived and executed by a single translator or a small group of translators,sometimes even for individual use. On the other hand, it may have been produced onthe basis of one or more preexistent texts, in the same or in different dialects. It mayalso have been revised through the useof a Greek text, which may or may not havebeenthesametypeasthatusedintheprevioustranslations.Translationsmayalsohavebeenrevised simply to improve the Coptic form, or to make it more correct in comparisonwith a Greek text that seemed better” (Tito Orlandi, “Coptic Literature,” inThe Roots ofEgyptian Christianity[ed. Birger A. Pearson and James E. Goehring; SAC; Philadelphia:Fortress Press, ], ). Moreover, there are problems with regard to “the date of thetranslations, the question of dialectical priority, and the relation between ‘official’ and‘private’ translations” (ibid., ).791Frederik Wisse, “After theSynopsis: Prospects and Problems in Establishing a Crit-ical Text of the Apocryphon of John and in Defining Its Historical Location,” inThe NagHammadi Library After Fifty Years: Proceedings of the  Society of Biblical LiteratureCommemoration[ed.

We need to look to theSemiticlanguagesHebreworSyriac/Aramaicinordertofind“spirit”asafemininenoun.794ItseemstomethatwhiletheideathatAdamcameintobeing from these two virgins would most probably have had its originsin a Semitic-speaking milieu, there is no reason why it could not havebeenemployed justaswell byanauthor writinginCoptic asonewritingin Greek, and without its author actually being directly in touch with aSemitic language. We need to distinguish between the origins of ideasand motifs used in the tractate and the composition of the tractate itself,which uses a wide range of ideas, motifs, allusions and metaphors for itsown purposes.Finally it has been argued that the text is stylistically different fromindigenous Coptic writings,795but here again the comparative materialfor this period is sparse, and of debatable value as proof that the CopticGos.Phil.isatranslation.Now,IamnotarguingthatGos.Phil.musthavebeen originally composed in Coptic, only that this possibility cannot beexcluded,796anddeservestobetakenfullyintoconsideration.Whatdoesseem likely on the basis of the present analysis ofGos.

ThatGos. Phil.stresses the need for instruction in order to learn the proper meaning ofChristianity’skeysymbolsisnotinanywayatoddswithwhatwefindin other Christian sources in the period whenGos. Phil.mayhavebeenproduced, and especially if we compare it with sources from the fourthor fifth centuries.One of the key passages that have been used to argue thatGos. Phil.is a “Gnostic” text that has a polemical edge against Christianity is theone which proclaims that the correctly initiated Christian, i.e., the onewho has received the name by means of the chrismation, has become aChrist.846Commenting on this passage, Borchert asks “who could wishfor more? But what true Christian would not be troubled by such awish?”847Similarly, Pagels claims that “those who expected to ‘becomeChrist’themselveswerenotlikelytorecognizetheinstitutionalstructuresofthechurch—itsbishop,priest,creed,canon,orritual—asbearingulti-mate authority.”848But are these scholars right in understanding thesepassages inGos. Phil. as having a polemical edge against “conventionalChristians”andinstitutionalstructures?AsIhave shownabove, the pas-sage in question is better understood as an argument for the importanceof receiving the Holy Spirit in connection with baptism, and especiallythe effects of the chrismation, but without any specific polemical edge844See, e.g., Borchert, “Gnostic Threat”; Franzmann, “A Complete History,” –.845Rudolph, “Response,” .846SeeGos.

Moreover, what we know of rit-ual interpretation from the first Christian centuries does not supportthe identification of these views exclusively with “heretical” or “fringe”groups, since these are viewpoints that are attested in the writings ofdecidedly “orthodox” Church Fathers, overlooked by Borchert, Pagelsand others. The notion that the initiated Christians in a sense becameChrists is indeed widely attested in patristic sources.849As Gaffron has noted, “es besteht kein Zweifel, daß Ph und seineGemeinde sich als Christen verstanden haben, und zwar völlig harm-los und ohne das Pathos anderer Gnostiker gegenüber den ‘Psychikern’der Großkirche.”850Moreover, Gaffron observed that “die gelegentlichenPolemiken gegen Lehrmeinungen anderer christlicher oder gnostischerGruppen lassen sich jedenfalls nicht auf die Formel bringen: hie Ortho-doxie—hie Häresie.”851Granted,Gos. Phil.doesengageinapolemicagainst those who falsely call themselves Christian, those who havemerelyborrowedthename,butinthisitisnodifferentfromotherpatris-tic sources, and hence it does not necessarily imply any polemic specifi-callydirectedagainstthe“orthodox/catholic/mainstream”Church.852Itseems more likely thatGos. Phil. is simply engaged in a polemic againstcertain other interpretations of key Christian theologoumena, rituals,and symbols, but the identity of the Christian groups or individuals thatare the targets of its polemics are difficult to decide. I will neverthelesspoint out some possibilities below, without in any way claiming this tobe a comprehensive overview.849For the identification of the initiated Christian as “Christ,” see, e.g., Tertullian,On Baptism (see Finn,Italy, North Africa, and Egypt); Cyril of Jerusalem,BaptismalCatechesis (see Finn,West and East Syria, –); Kilian McDonnell and GeorgeT.

Wilson, “Gnosis, Gnosticism and the New Testament,” inLe Originidello Gnosticismo: Colloquio di Messina – Aprile : Testi e Discussioni[ed.

In a letter tar-geting his former friend Rufinus in , Jerome states thatTherearesomewhobelieve,theysay,intheresurrection ofthebody.Thisconfession, if only it be sincere, is free from objection. But as there arebodies celestial and bodies terrestrial ... they use the word ‘body’ insteadoftheword‘flesh’inorderthatanorthodoxpersonhearingthemsay‘body’may take them to mean ‘flesh,’ while a heretic will understand that theymean ‘spirit.’871(Jerome,Ep. .)Rufinus, for his part, replies that what rises in the resurrection “will bethis very flesh in which we now live. We do not hold, as is slanderouslyreported by some men, that another flesh will rise instead of this; butthisveryflesh.”872Inrelation to these views, then, itisinteresting to notethatGos. Phil. actually affirms the resurrection “in this flesh” while infact holding that what rises is really another flesh—exactly the kind ofredefinition, then, that Rufinus is accused of and tries to defend himselfagainst.J.N.D. Kelly suggests that the reason why many creeds refer to theresurrection of the flesh rather than to the resurrection of the dead, theform preferred by the New Testament, was in order to “counter anti-realist interpretations of the doctrine of the resurrection.”873Although870See, e.g., Clark,The Origenist Controversy.DechownotesthatamongEgyptianmonastics “the doctrine of resurrection still seems to have been in flux before Shenoute’stime,despiteEpiphanius’polemicandtheoppositionfromsimplerCopticmonkstospec-ulative eschatologies” (Dechow,Dogma and Mysticism, –).

While the animals that were sacrificed were alive whenthey were sacrificed and ended up dead, Christ was in a sense dead, i.e.,not yet alive, when he was crucified, since it was his “death” on the crossthatactuallyledtolife.Furthermore,theindividualChristianisnotfullyaliveuntilhehasexperienced“thepowerofthecross”throughthechris-mation and the Eucharist—both of which are life-giving sacraments thatare linked to the crucifixion and the resurrection.This reinterpretation of sacrifice, which basically rejects animal sac-rifice in favour of Christ’s once-and-for-all sacrifice and its eucharisticre-enactment, can be said to have a polemical edge towards contempo-rary pagan practice while at the same time presenting itself as super-seding the old and now obsolete Jewish sacrificial practices. It shouldbe noted, however, that the chronological opposition of before and afterChrist is elsewhere inGos. Phil. explicitly connected to the Hebrew-Christian dichotomy, a fact that would easily bestow an anti-Jewishflavour to its discourse concerning the old and the new mode of sacri-fice as well.So,Gos. Phil. is acutely aware of the fact that Christianity sprang outof Judaism and makes a point of presenting the latter as an earlier stageof history that has now been superseded by the former.

Phil.’s anti-JewishpolemicsareatleastnotexclusivelydirectedagainsttheJewsthemselves.By readingGos. Phil. in the context of the Arian crisis of the fourth cen-tury, we see that Arianism is easily called to mind by way of the per-vasive focus inGos. Phil. on begetting versus creating, which is sub-sequently connected to Judaism by the tractate’s explicit contrasting ofChristianity (i.e., its own brand of Christianity) with Judaism on thisvery issue. This does not mean, however, thatGos. Phil. refers only toother Christians and not to Jews or Judaism, as some scholars have sug-gested.911What it means is that the text’s explicit references to Jews andJudaism may easily have been read as simultaneously associating con-temporary inner-Christian opponents with the practices and beliefs ofthe Jews, with all the negative implications entailed by such an identifi-cation.Association of Arians and other Christian heretics with Jews was infactacommonrhetoricalstrategyinpatristicliterature.Athanasius,forexample, often attacked the Arians by way of anti-Jewish polemics.912DavidBrakkeshowshowAthanasiushadnoproblemslumpingtogether“Jews, Arians, Melitians, and all other ‘heretics’” in the same box andthus often polemicises against these groups at the same time.913A goodexample of this is when Athanasius in his thFestal Letterconnects theJews who mock Christ, asking him to come down from the Cross if hereally is the Son of God, with the Arians and the Melitians, stating that“the Arians and their parasites the Melitians envied these evils, for theyprocured for themselves the ignorance of the Jews.”914Brakke tries to contextualize Athanasius’ polemics even more specif-ically, suggesting that with the Jewish quarter being not far from thechurchwhereAriuswasministering,“Athanasius’polemicalassociationsof the Arians with the Jews may have had additional force within thetopography of urban Alexandria.”915Certainly, in such a historical con-text, we may safely assume that the possibility of associating the Arians911See e.g. Siker, “Gnostic Views.”912For instance, Athanasius argues that in making Christ a creature and denying hisdivinity, the Arians also deny the resurrection, leaving Christ dead. Thus, Athanasiusargues, the Arians manage to do what the Jews had hoped to accomplish, thus makingthe two groups equivalent (see David Brakke, “Jewish Flesh and Christian Spirit inAthanasius of Alexandria,”JECS: []: ).913Brakke, “Jewish Flesh,” .914See Brakke, “Jewish Flesh,” .915Brakke, “Jewish Flesh,” ."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"chapter fourwith the Jews would spring easily to mind. However, the presence ofactual Jews in the vicinity is of course not a necessary precondition forthe rhetoricaleffectiveness of the Judaism/Arianism connection,fortheassociationofone’sopponentswithJewswascommonpracticeinChris-tianity from a very early stage. Miriam Taylor calls it “associative anti-Judaism,” which she defines as “the adaptation of anti-Judaic symbolsby the writers of the early church in attempts to discredit views withinthe church which they oppose.”916She states further that “in associat-ing an opponent with Jewish faults or characteristics, the authors of thechurch symbolically associated a position with the typical traits knownfrom salvation history as characteristic of that which was archetypicallyobsolete and typically wrong.”917This is a practice that is evident in thewritings of Athanasius, and other patristic authors, and it is also whatwe find inGos. Phil., whose anti-Jewish polemics would certainly reflectbadly on the ritual practices of those who did not share its own chris-tological and mystagogical views. Indeed, the way in whichGos. Phil.presents a dichotomy between proper Christian initiation where theretakes place a begetting of new Christians (presented as Christs, even),and Jewish proselyte initiation, which is presented in terms of creating,rather than begetting, could very well be read as disparaging the effi-cacy of Arian ritual practice—in effect stating that their ritual initiation,like Jewish proselyte initiation, only amounts to creation, and is thus notproper Christian initiation. Indeed, such a polemical inference wouldsuggest that any apostolic succession claimed by Arians and their sup-porters would be null and void. It would thus amount to a rather strongcriticism of their ritual practice argued as a consequence of their Chris-tology..

Phil. Its Christology is reflected in its anthropology and vice versa.So,tosumup,whatmaywesayabouttheChristology,anthropology,andsacramental soteriology ofGos. Phil.?..Christology and AnthropologyFirst of all, we saw that Christ, or at least the Logos and the HolySpirit, is pre-existent. Secondly,Gos. Phil. affirms the virgin birth ofJesusfromMary,butthisisprobablynottobeunderstoodasabirthof the complete Saviour, which seems to require a second, baptismal,birth in the river Jordan. The Logos, however, is seemingly born fromMary in a material body, a material body that derives from the Virginand Joseph. At his subsequent baptism in the Jordan, the Logos is thenunited in a baptismal anointing with the Holy Spirit who is describedas “the virgin who came down” (ⲧⲡⲁⲣⲑⲉⲛⲟⲥ̄ⲛⲧⲁϩⲉⲓ ⲁⲡⲓⲧ̄ⲛ), at whichpoint his true body comes into being. Christ thus seems to consist ofthe Logos, referred to as his flesh, and the Holy Spirit, referred to ashis blood, within a material body. By all accounts the Logos-flesh ofJesus seems to take on the role of his true flesh and “glory” which isrevealed at his transfiguration on the mountain. This Logos-flesh alsoseemsinawaytobeequivalenttohissoul,oratleasttobepresentedas a counterpart of Adam’s soul. This constitution lasts from the Jordanbaptism until the crucifixion, where Christ’s divinity is separated fromhis humanity, i.e., when the Logos-Holy Spirit pair is separated from thematerial body. This separation on the cross may also be interpreted as aresurrection,butisalsocruciallyinterpretedasalife-givingdeath,whichis intimately connected to an interpretation of the Eucharist as both thefood of immortality, the acquisition of the perfect man, a unificationand mingling with the divine, and a perfect life-giving sacrifice thatsupersedes previous sacrificial cult.918In its basic outline, the Christology ofGos. Phil. thus corresponds tostatements put in Jesus’ mouth in a text witnessed by a small parch-ment fragment from Upper Egypt and recently published by Charles918ThisisinstarkcontrasttoWilson,whoclaimsthattheChristofGos.Phil.“comesnottosavetheworldbygivinghislifebuttorestorethingstotheirproperplacesandbecomethefatherofaredeemedprogeny.Deliverancecomesthroughknowledge,notthroughthesacrifice of Calvary” (Wilson,The Gospel of Philip, –).

Phil. disregards the historicity of the Marys. Insteadit seems more likely that the tractate is once again pointing out someof the deeper meanings inherent in the details of Jesus’ earthly life. Inthis case the deeper meaning seems to be that just as Jesus has Mary asmother,companion,andsister,soalsohehastheHolySpiritasmother,companion, and sister.The anthropology and soteriology ofGos.

Phil.’s sacramentalsoteriology. AsGos. Phil. describes the rituals of baptism, chrismation,and Eucharist, their primary effect is the transformation of the indi-vidual into a Christ and unity with him. Transformation into Christ isthe goal, and the rituals of baptism, chrismation, and Eucharist are themeans.Gos. Phil. summarises important aspects of both the goal and themeansinitsdescriptionofChrist’stransfigurationbeforehisdisciplesonthe mountain. In what amounts to a prefiguration of the resurrection,he there shows himself in his glory to the disciples by making themgreat so that they will be able to see him as he truly is. There is animportant logic of reciprocity at work here, where one becomes whatone sees and sees what one has become, which is also mirrored inGos.Phil.’s eucharistic theology where one becomes what one eats and eatswhat one has become. Another expression of this is the description ofthe fact that one joins, unites, and has communion with what one hasbecome,andlikewisebecomeswhatonejoins,unites,orhascommunionwith. Another aspect of the logic of reciprocity inGos. Phil.isthatofparadoxical inversion, most notably the bringing of life through deathto counter the original establishment of death through life, and thereunification of the original separation that is itself achieved by meansof a separation.928Gabriele Winkler has noted that “even at the epiclesis of a number of Syriananaphoras,theHolySpiritmanifestshimselfpar excellenceat Jesus’ baptism, and at thesame time the text of the epiclesis is silent about the role of the Holy Spirit at Jesus’incarnation!” (Winkler, “A Remarkable Shift,” –). This corresponds to what wefind inGos. Phil.wheretheHolySpiritdoesnotplayanyroleinrelationtoJesus’birthfrom the Virgin Mary, but only comes into the picture at his baptism."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"deification and christology in thegospel of philipThis logic of reciprocity is balanced by the equally important logic ofprocreation and kinship, and succession through descent. The transfor-mationofnewconvertsintoChrists/Christiansisperpetuatedthroughasystem ofapostolic succession through ritual procreation andthe simul-taneous establishment of a kinship with Christ, God, and other rituallyinitiated Christians.

The Perspective of the Present StudyAt an early stage of Nag Hammadi research Robert M.

In studies of the Nag Hammadi texts, includingGos. Phil.andExeg. Soul, the texts themselves and their own internal logic haveoften come to play second fiddle to the wealth of comparative material,mostly heresiological, that has been adduced to shed light upon them.In this study I have therefore chosen instead to focus on the internallogicofGos.Phil.andExeg.Soul,andhavethustriedtoanalysehowthey1Willie van Peer, “Hidden Meanings,” inContextualized Stylistics: In Honor of PeterVerdonk(ed.

Moreover,as is the case with the soul who inExeg. Soulbears bad children withthe adulterers and good children with Christ, inGos. Phil.aswellone’soffspring resemble their father.

Christology and AnthropologyThe connection between Christology and anthropology is, as we haveseen,amajorconcerninGos.Phil.ButhowdoesGos.Phil.’s anthropologyand Christology compare with those underlyingExeg.

There is a material body and a soul, butno mention of any spirit ornousas a part of the human constitutionpriortoinitiationintoChristianity.A“life-givingspirit”isgivenbyChristas a seed, however, being his crucial gift to the soul facilitating hersalvation, and the tractate subsequently refers to praying to the Fatherwith the “spirit which is within” (ⲡⲛⲉⲩⲙⲁ ⲉⲧϩⲓⲡⲥⲁ ⲛϩⲟⲩⲛ).4The soul inExeg.Soulispre-existent,however,existingfromthebeginninginamale-female symbiotic relationship with her husband, identified with Adamin Genesis.

Transformational SoteriologyInbothtextssalvationentailsamarriagewithChrist.WhileinExeg.Soulthe requirement for this marriage involves repentance and conversionthrough baptism, which makes the soul into Christ’s complementaryfemalehalf,Gos.Phil.,onthecontrary,requiresonetobecomelikeChristoneself in order to unite with him. In this sense the soteriologies ofthe two texts are quite different. In both texts conversion and initiationentail a transformation, but while the crucial transformation inExeg.Soulentails a transformation of the soul from male into female, inGos.Phil. it is a process of deification making the initiated Christian into aChrist. While inExeg. Soulthe stress is on the submission, difference,andhierarchicalcomplementarityofthesouloftheChristianandChrist,inGos. Phil. there is on the contrary a stress upon theidentificationofthe initiated Christian with Christ. There is thus an important aspect ofdeification inGos. Phil. that does not seem to be present inExeg. Soul.Here we may also note the crucial difference between the two texts inthat the soul inExeg. Soulis transformed from being improperly male-like into a proper female bride, while inGos. Phil.thesoulbecomingLogos-like implies its maleness, since it is to be united with the femalespirit.

Rituals and MystagogyBaptism plays a major role in bothGos. Phil.andExeg. Soul,butindifferent ways. As we saw in the analysis ofExeg. Soulin chapter , thereferences to rituals in this text may well be understood metaphorically,but, however this may be, baptism is connected with purification andconversion. By way of its cleansing and converting function, baptism isinExeg. Soulpresented as a necessary preparation for the communionwith Christ, which may or may not be understood as a reference to theEucharist.InGos. Phil.’s interpretation, however, as we saw in chapter , baptismis primarily given a life-giving, rather than a cathartic, function, and isconnected with the donning of the “living man” (ⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲉⲧⲟⲛϩ). Bap-tism inGos. Phil. is not the important ritual it appears to be inExeg.Soul, however, for the former lays great emphasis on the superiority ofchrismation over baptism. WhileGos.

The focus inputs in blendsinvolving these terms may in some cases be ritual practice, and in othercases the body of the Christian, the body of Christ, or ritual space. Itis only inGos.

No single referent, then, neither asfocus nor framing input, may be identified behind the abovementionedGreekandCoptictermsusedinExeg.SoulandGos.Phil.thatareusuallytranslated as “bridal chamber.” It should also be stressed that as theseblends function inGos.

Reflections on MethodologyCommenting on the usefulness of applying theories developed withincognitive linguistics to biblical exegesis, Leo Noordman has recentlypointedoutthatcognitivelinguisticsmakesussensitivetopervasivetex-tual phenomena related to mental models and processes, and providesus with theories to both describe and analyse them.10He emphasises,10See Noordman, “Some Reflections,” ."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"chapter fivehowever, that his advocacy of cognitive linguistics “should not be inter-preted as implying that cognitive linguistics has developed ready madetools that can simply be applied in other disciplines, for instance, in exe-gesis.”11Acknowledging the truthfulness of Noordman’s comments, thisstudy hasbeenanattempt toadapt andcombinesomeexistingtools intosomething that would prove to be useful in a study of both conceptualand intertextual blending in texts likeExeg. SoulandGos. Phil.Ihopeto have shown that to attain to the questions of conceptual and intertex-tualblendinginthestudyoftheseNagHammaditractatesisnotofmereperipheral importance, but indispensable if we want to provide analysesthatdojusticetothemany-layeredcomplexitiesoftheseintriguingtexts,and I hope to have shown the usefulness of the outlined Cognitive Poet-ics methodology in performing this task. In other words, I hope to havedemonstrated the usefulness of this theoretical framework in making usaware of the complexities of the texts while at the same time helping usunderstand how they make sense.In addition, cognitive poetics is helpful when it comes to the histor-ical contextualisation of the analysed texts. As we have seen, we canemploy inputs from previously historically contextualized knowledgeexperimentally in our Cognitive Poetic analyses of an ancient text, likethe ones from Nag Hammadi, in order to analytically map out its mean-ing potential within that particular historical context. Cognitive Poeticsmay here help us delineate rhetorical structures within a text, that maymoreclearlyshowusitspossiblepolemicaledgesandthushelpustenta-tively place the text within an historico-cultural context. For instance, aswe have seen, the cognitive poetic analysis ofGos. Phil. showing the per-vasiveemphasisonbegettinginoppositiontocreating,seemstoindicatethat we could fruitfully read this kind of polemic in light of the Ariancrisis of the fourth century. Secondly, a Cognitive Poetic analysis may beused as a basis for a comparison with other sources with a more securehistorical context. In such analyses we may conciously choose to refrainfrom reading certain cognitive models and historically contextualizedinformationintothetextfromthebeginning,inordertolevelthegroundbetween the sources that are to be compared.How can Cognitive Poetics help us analyze the possible functions oftexts within an historical context? Inhypothesising possible functionsofa text within specific historico-cultural contexts, a methodology based11Noordman, “Some Reflections,” ."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"conclusionon Cognitive Poetics may in several ways help make us aware of dif-ferent interpretive possibilities. A Cognitive Poetic study of how Scrip-ture is interpretively recontextualized by way of intertextual allusions orquotations in a reading of a given text, may again serve as a prelude tothe study of how this text may again have functioned within differenthypothetical historical contexts. The hypothetical historical contexts wechoose to apply in such experimental analyses should of course not bearbitrarily chosen, but rather be selected on the basis of clues within thetexts, or from external information, like for instance the date and prove-nance of the material remains in which the texts have been preserved.Such clues trigger contextual inputs from our existing historical knowl-edge toghether with the cognitive models that seem most relevant to thetext at hand.Thegroundworkisthuslaidforacomprehensivecomparativeanalysisthathasbeenoutsidethescopeofthepresentstudy.Asfortheevaluationof the results of such analyses, the only criterion I think is theoreticallywarranted is to what degree the resulting interpretations make senseto us and our peers. For when it comes to what it is that in the finalanalysismakesaninterpretationsensible,IthinkStanleyFishhasarguedconvincinglythatthishasmuchlesstodowiththetextswearetryingto interpret themselves, than with the socially constrained evaluation ofsuch interpretations made by one interpretive community or another.12For what yields the most coherent and persuasive overall interpretationof a text will always be relative to the existing conventions within therespective interpretive communities.. The Place ofExeg. SoulandGos.Phil. in the History of ChristianityNearly fifty years ago Robert M. Grant argued that “the new gospelsfrom Nag-Hammadi deserve a welcome because they will help showwhat Christianity is not, and what our canonical gospels are not,” andaddedthat“Theymayconceivablyhelpustoseewhatourgospelsare,but the differences will remain more important than the similarities.”13Ihope,however,tohavedemonstratedinthepresentstudythatthesetextsshouldnotbeseenasevidenceofwhatChristianitywasnot,butratherof12See Fish,Is There a Text.13Grant, “Two Gnostic Gospels,” ."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"chapter fivewhatitwas.Gos.Phil.andExeg.SoulshouldbeseenaspartsofthefabricofearlyChristianity,andhenceassourcesforwhatearlyChristianitywaslike,ratherthanascontraststoChristianityinitsformativeperiod.Ialsohope to have shown that in order to properly understandGos. Phil.andExeg. Soul, they need not and should not be approached from the per-spective of a predetermined category of “Gnosticism.” By eschewing thiscategory, these early Christian texts suddenly appear less as aberrationsofearlyChristianitythanaspartsofit,14and we may more easily focusonthesimilaritiesbetweenthesetextsandother earlyChristiansources,rather than on the differences.It seems that a reading of these texts thoroughlywithinthe many-faceted fabric of early Christian discourse promises to yield insightsinto the fascinating corpus of writings constituted by the Nag HammadiCodices, and on their place in the history of Christianity, that havehitherto eluded us. For, as Karen King has rightly pointed out, “if weonly reproduce the discursive and interpretive position of the ‘orthodox’winners, we will never understand adequately what was at stake in theearly Christian controversies that shaped whathas cometo be oneof themost influential religious traditions the world has yet known.”15Moreover, in such an analysis we should not simply assume thattheseNagHammaditextsarestraightforwardtranslationsintoCopticofsignificantly older Greek originals, but rather be open to the possibilitythat many of these texts should be regarded as “living literature”16thatmayalsohaveundergonesignificantrewritingintheirCopticphase(s)oftransmission,withoutthisfactprecludingtheirstatusascoherentliterarystatements. We should consequently be wary of assuming that what wefind in these texts can be used as sources for the state of Christianity at astage long before the production of our preserved Coptic manuscripts.The great manuscript discoveries of the th century, not least thediscovery of the Nag Hammadi Codices, forcefully brought home thefact that our puzzle of early Christianity had lacked a great numberof pieces, and still does. As Rowan Greer observed already at the Yaleconference on “Gnosticism” in , the new pieces soon called intoquestion“thelinesalongwhichthepuzzlewaspreviouslybeingsolved.”1714For, as Wisse has correctly pointed out, “few pagan or Christian religious writingsof the first three centuries of our era are immune to being interpreted as showing theinfluenceofGnosticismorasincludingapolemicagainstit”(Wisse,“OnExegeting,”).15King,Secret Revelation of John,x.16See Bradshaw, “Liturgy and ‘Living Literature’” and the discussion in chapter .17RowanA.Greer,“TheDogandtheMushrooms:Irenaeus’sViewoftheValentinians"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"conclusionGreer rightly noted that it is “tempting to suppose that when new piecesof a puzzle are discovered they can simply be added to the ones alreadyarranged.”18Despite Greer’s perceptive comments to the effect that thenew pieces do not actually fit into the old puzzle, the Nag Hammaditractateshavestillbeenusedmainlyaspiecesinapuzzlethatwasalreadybeing laid according to the heresiological writings of Irenaeus, Clement,Hippolytus, Tertullian, and Epiphanius.KeithHopkinshasstrikinglyillustrated“howhazardousconventionalinductive procedures are, when scholars so carefully reconstruct churchhistoryonlyfromsurvivingsources,”bypointingoutthatiffiftyChris-tian communities wrote on average two letters per year in the period toce,thiswouldadduptotenthousandletters,“ofwhichbarelyfiftysurvive.”19From this he drew the obvious conclusion that the sourcesfrom this period are appallingly unrepresentative.20If we extrapolatefromthiscalculationtothewholeperiodupuntilthetimeoftheproduc-tionoftheNagHammadiCodices,takingalsothemassivegrowthinthenumber of Christian communities into consideration, it becomes quiteapparent that we still lack a large proportion of the pieces to this puzzle,and that it is far from clear where the diverse Nag Hammadi texts fit inamong the thousands of lost documents of early Christianity. It is there-fore of utmost importance for the interpretation of the virtually context-less Nag Hammadi texts what categories, contexts, metanarratives, andintertexts we choose to invoke in an effort to make sense of them.It seems clear from the present study, however, that the puzzle piecesconstitutedbyExeg.SoulandGos.Phil.donotreadilyfitinwithpreviousattempts to assemble the puzzle on the basis of theories of “Gnosticism.”Thecritiqueofthisparticularscholarlycategory,thathasbeenforcefullyfronted by Michael Williams21and Karen King,22seems at least on thebasis of the present study to have been vindicated.

Phil.asreflectingquitedifferent theological discussions and polemical contexts than those thatare reflected in the works of the earliest heresiologists.What remains to be done, then, apart from a comparison with otherrelated Nag Hammadi texts, which should ideally be based on detailedinternalanalysesoftheseothertexts,isanextendedcomparativeanalysisofGos.Phil.andExeg.SoulwithotherChristiansources.Suchacompara-tive analysis should start with the approximate period of the productionof the Nag Hammadi Codices and work backwards from there, ratherthan the other way around. By analysingGos. Phil.andExeg. Soulalsoin light of sources from the approximate period of the creation and useof the codices themselves, we may gain a better foundation from whichtoanswerquestionsconcerningthepossibleidentitiesofthelateantiqueusers of these texts, and also that of the manufacturers and users of thecodex that contains them, regardless of what conclusions we may cometowithrespecttotheauthorshipanddateofthehypotheticaloriginals.23Early Egyptian monastic sources, from the fourth and fifth centuries,remainapromisingavenueofcomparativeanalysisthathasnotyetbeenfully exploited. While, as we have seen, neitherExeg. SoulnorGos. Phil.seem to require an ascetic or monastic reading, both texts do seem tolend themselves rather easily to such readings, which would make themcompatible with a monastic way of life, and a monastic milieu wouldappear tobeaprobableSitzimLebenforbothtextsintheirpresentform.Indeed, if we also take fully into consideration the possibility of more“orthodox” readings of texts likeGos. Phil.andExeg. Soulthan we havebeenaccustomedto,andcomparethemsystematicallywithsourcesfromthe fourth and fifth century, we may perhaps find that James Goehringmight have been rather close to the mark when he stated that, for themonks of Egypt, “it was not impossible for one to support Athanasiusand to read the Nag Hammadi texts.”24In any case, to study these texts“as part of a gnostic, rather than monastic, trajectory,” seems, as MichelDesjardins has put it, “peculiar at best.”2523See Emmel, “Religious Tradition,” .24JamesE.Goehring,“NewFrontiers inPachomian Studies,”inTheRoots ofEgyptianChristianity(ed.
