[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Introduction: Thomas Mann and Gnosticism in theCultural Matrix of His TimeKirsten J. GrimstadThe last decades of the twentieth century witnessed a far-reaching revival of interest inthe ancient and radical philosophy of religion known as Gnosticism. In 1945 a cache of originalGnostic texts buried in the desert at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt around 400 C.E. came to lightby accident when a camel-driver struck upon a large clay jar while digging for fertilizer. The jarcontained papyrus codices that are now recognized as the most comprehensive collection ofGnostic writing ever retrieved, comprising fifty-two tractates bound in twelve books. Thevigorous new wave of discussion triggered by the discovery has advanced insight into the role ofthis diverse school of thought -- once marginalized as heresy -- in shaping primitive Christianityas it unfolded in a teeming matrix of Eastern and Western traditions.To date, this revival has reached far beyond the domains of academic study and intoliterature and popular culture. Gnostic motifs and sensibility began cropping up in the fiction ofcontemporary authors Walker Percy, Flannery O’Conner, William Gaddis, and ThomasPynchon, as well as in science fiction novels by Philip K. Dick, to name just a few well knownexamples noted in critical studies.1 In addition, the emergence of contemporary Gnostic societiesand churches -- now gaining adherents through homepages on the World Wide Web -- bearsfurther witness to the continuing echoes and remarkable resilience of this ancient school in thetwenty-first century.2The post-war renewal of interest in Gnosticism rests on the foundation of an earlierrevival that began in the late nineteenth century and built to a pitch during the decadesencompassing the First World War and its aftermath. The first original Gnostic texts began tosurface and engage debate at this critical time when the canons of the Western tradition, its faithin reason and progress, were coming under severe attack and increasingly regarded as sterile andexhausted. Christianity too was widely denounced as a bankrupt institution that had supplantedthe vigorous true faith of the primitive church with pablum for the masses. In this context of a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 2waning tradition, figures on the cultural vanguard began looking for alternative roots in therejected chapters of history, in those marginalized domains the Western tradition had attemptedto suppress and erase. The rediscovery of original Gnostic texts fed this hunger. Pioneeringintellectual leaders such as C. G. Jung, Hans Jonas, and Gershom Scholem rehabilitated the once-despised heretics and promoted them to honored precursors of analytical psychology,existentialism, and revolutionary messianism. Ripples from the recovery of a Gnostic imaginationand sensibility also extended into the writing of Melville, Yeats, Pound, Artaud, Kafka, Hesse,Nabokov, Lawrence Durrell, and others, and into popular esoteric schools as well.3 The firstwave of the modern revival of Gnosticism emerged from this dynamic matrix.The provocative reappearance of an ancient and supposedly long-dead religiousphilosophy on the cultural terrain of the secularized modern age invites an accounting, which thisstudy attempts to provide. The first four chapters explore the revival of a Gnostic sensibilityacross the broad landscape of European literature and thought during the decades leading up toand including the explosive beginning of the twentieth century. The later chapters tackle thissubject in microcosm by probing buried layers of Thomas Mann’s novel Doktor Faustus, inwhich the world-rejecting aesthetic ideology of the composer Adrian Leverkühn unfolds intandem with the political ideology of the Nazi regime. Approaching Doktor Faustus through therevival of Gnosticism exposes the fault lines in the bedrock of the aesthetic movement thatemerged in the context of renewed scholarly and popular interest in ancient Gnostic religionduring the generations preceding the historical crises of our era. This approach also exposes asurprising and previously unrecognized dimension of Mann’s novel, namely, a covert Gnosticredemption drama that lies encrypted within the main story of the protagonist’s downfall anddamnation. Recognizing this hidden story solves some of the novel’s central puzzles, as laterchapters of this study will detail through close reading of Mann’s text.Throughout this study I use the term \"Gnostic\" to refer to a religious sensibility datingfrom the Greco-Roman era and noted for its extremism. Gnosticism features a radicallypessimistic view of life and the world combined with a radically optimistic belief that the human"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 3spirit is itself divine, though lost in an alien and hostile world ruled by an evil deity. The ancientGnostics believed that the created world came about through a divine catastrophe. Yet salvationfrom the emptiness of the human condition could be achieved through the numinous experiencethey called gnosis, that is, a moment flooded with remembrance of the divine spirit within and itstrue home in the heavenly fullness known as the pleroma that lies beyond the world. Coupledwith the utmost pessimism of Gnostic writing we find radiant hymns of ecstasy. Gnosticsespoused a radical dream of ultimate liberation; they made no compromises with the status quo.This dualistic and world-rejecting but also transcendent and subversive world view tookroot among the early Christian heretical sects that blossomed during the second through fifthcenturies and among eastern Mandaean and Manichaean variants that continued much longer. TheMandaeans may have originated in Judea as early as the first century as a Jewish baptismal sectthat eventually fled from persecution to southern Iraq, where it survives to this day in acommunity of about 15,000 (Rudolph 363-64). Manichaeism originated in third-centuryMesopotamia, among the followers of Mani, in whose teachings the dualism of the Gnosticworldview found its fullest expression and broadest geographic reach. The Manichaeans migratedto Asia, where they prospered at sites along the Silk Road far into Chinese Turkestan until thethirteenth century. Yet, as some have argued, Gnosticism remains far more than an historicalphenomenon and a chapter in the history of religions. It is also a feature of consciousness and aresponse to the world that turns up repeatedly in religious imagination and in philosophy andculture as the kaleidoscope of history turns.As of this writing, a body of critical studies investigating Gnostic themes in literature hasaccumulated to include more than 130 titles dating back to 1972, with four to seven new studiesadded each year. For the most part, these studies investigate Gnostic thematics and sensibility inthe works of individual writers, substantiated by evidence of their contact with this or thatGnostic source. Many of these studies cluster around the period of the first wave revival ofGnosticism. Is there an overarching perspective that might link these individual examples to somesort of shared disposition or structure of thought? Part two of this study proposes that"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 4European Aestheticism, also widely known in its day as the religion of art, may be seen as a formof modern Gnosticism in which the ancient Gnostic rejection of the world and longing to escapeinto otherworldly redemption returned in modern secular guise.The so-called religion of art in effect rekindled a culturally subversive sectarian structureof thought that left its watermark on diverse literary texts of the period. Beginning withBaudelaire and continuing through the fin de siècle, we find increasing examples of an extremistrevolt against modernity itself as a ruined work that parallels on the historical plane the Gnosticrevolt against the cosmos. Moreover, the ancient Gnostic salvation through gnosis reappears inthe l'art pour l'art ideal of an autonomous aesthetic utopia of absolute art as a medium forabsolute reality and an escape from the social world and the perceived horrors of modernity. Thismovement culminated in modernist abstraction. In his doctoral thesis Abstraktion und Einfühlung(Abstraction and Empathy, 1908), art critic Wilhelm Worringer described abstraction as a life-negating, inorganic, crystalline form of beauty purified of all existential contingency and renderedas pure form.4 Worringer noted that abstraction follows from a feeling of being lost andoverwhelmed in a hostile universe in which all things are relative (17-21). These counterbalancingpessimistic and optimistic extremes comprise what I suggest is the Gnostic schema in EuropeanAestheticism. This way of cognition governs the imagination and sensibility of many of themovement’s leading figures, from which may be discerned a striking structural homology betweenthe ancient religious heresy and the modern secular religion of art.Mann’s literary persona ripened in this milieu. It left a deep imprint on his early work inthe struggle between art and life, mind and nature that unfolds as the thematic centerpiece of hisnovella Tonio Kröger (1903) and as the thread linking the early stories with the novelBuddenbrooks (1901) and Der Tod in Venedig (Death in Venice, 1913). Mann's continuingpreoccupation with the contest between these binary opposites, which forms the baseline ofEuropean literature of the fin de siècle, places his early work in the continuum of Aestheticismreaching back to Baudelaire. In Leverkühn, Mann critically revisits this first stage of hisdevelopment as an artist but in a way that bares his profound ambivalence. To be sure, he"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 5condemns implicitly his own early world-rejecting aestheticism along with the coldness ofmodern art that follows from its complete detachment from the social world and indifference tothe ideological forces propelling Germany into what Mann suggested was a devil’s pact withHitler. And yet, in the voice of the idolizing narrator, the author’s suffering affinity for theartist’s elevation and remoteness from life sounds distinctly throughout.The point of departure for considering a Gnostic subtext in Doktor Faustus is that thefirst figure associated with the name Faust was none other than the legendary Simon Magus. Thechurch fathers reviled this colorful contemporary of the apostles Peter and Paul as the firstGnostic and the father of all heresy. The secondary literature on the Faust myth dutifully creditsSimon Magus as Faust’s first forerunner. And studies by Richardson, Petsch, Kahler, Quispel,Hanratty, Brown, and Nuttall have also touched upon the implications of Faust’s Gnosticancestry for the larger meaning of this legend that resonates so powerfully with the crisis ofWestern individualism. Most critical studies, however, have focused instead on the moreimmediate and well known source: the shadowy sixteenth-century necromancer who calledhimself \"Faustus junior\" and \"magus secundus\" and whose exploits inspired the popular legendrecorded in the Faust chapbook published by Spies in 1587.We know that Thomas Mann was well aware of the deep ancestry of the Faust figure. Inhis lecture \"On Goethe’s Faust,\" delivered at Princeton in 1938, Mann identified Simon Magusas the original prototype for the historical Faust. According to Mann, this latter-day figuredeliberately shaped the episodes of his life to recapitulate the mythical pattern established by hisrole model Simon Magus. This accounts, in Mann’s view, for the otherwise puzzling fact thatthe third-rate charlatan of the sixteenth century managed to leverage himself to mythic stature.5Yet, despite Mann’s direct reference to this source for his novel that was in gestation at the timeof this lecture, the broad implications of Faust’s Gnostic ancestry for the meaning of Mann’snovel have remained unexamined.We know that Mann was also at least minimally aware of the revival of Gnosticism thatwas heating up on the frontiers of comparative religion as newly discovered ancient texts began"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 6to circulate, because he incorporated one of them in the prelude to the Joseph tetralogy. Thenarrator introduces the myth, sometimes called Roman der Seele (Romance of the Soul), at thefinal station in the mythical descent into the well of the past with which the tetralogy begins. Heframes the myth as a tradition of human thought deriving from earliest time and based onhumanity’s truest self-understanding. This tradition subsequently penetrated the prophecies anddoctrines of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Manichaeism, Gnosticism, and Hellenism (GW 4: 39).The story tells of the primordial human soul, a being of pure light called the Urmensch orPrimal Man, who emanated from the divine source of all being before the beginning of the world.He was God’s first emissary in the war against the evil that had invaded the new creation. Butthe Primal Man forgets his mission by instead becoming enamored with his own image reflectedin lower nature. He goes down to it and falls into bondage and forgetfulness of his own heavenlyhome. Through this mingling of the primordial soul with formless materiality, our creaturelyworld of forms, suffering, and death first comes into being in order to gratify the soul’s yearningfor union with matter. But God sends a second messenger, the Primal Man’s heavenly twin, toawaken the slumbering soul to its plight by kindling a homesick longing for its ancient freedomand lost home in divinity. Only when the soul wings its way homeward will divinity again berestored to its original wholeness, the created world of forms will end, and matter will regain itsoriginal formless condition.6Its strategic placement in the structure of the prelude implies that this Gnostic account ofcreation contains the ultimate answer to the search for our origin and end, and therefore itssignificance can hardly be overstated. At a later point in this chapter, we will explore how theRoman der Seele functions as a touchstone for the entire work, in which Thomas Mann engagesand humorously refutes the anti-cosmic message of Gnosticism. But first, we must set the stagewith a brief excursion into early Gnosticism and its rediscovery in the nineteenth century in orderto establish the context in which Mann and others of his era imported Gnostic myth into theirmodern literary texts."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 7Early GnosticismIn the study of the history of religions, Gnosticism has traditionally been regarded as awholly ancient, long-dead movement of the Greco-Roman world. The nucleus of this movementconsisted of a recognizable group of largely second-century C.E. sects that became the hereticalfoil against which Christian dogma came to define itself. These diverse sects tended to formaround charismatic leaders such as Simon Magus, Valentinus, Basilides, Marcion, and Mani oraround specific teachings. A sect called the Sethians, for example, believed that Seth, the thirdson of Adam and Eve, was the Gnostic redeemer and the first ancestor of a race of spiritualbeings. The actual beliefs differed widely, however, because the Gnostics strongly rejected dogmain favor of individual speculation and revelation experienced through gnosis. There is no Gnosticconfession, only an assortment of hymns, gospels, prayers, dialogues, cosmogonies, andapocalypses from which to derive the general picture.In addition to the Christian Gnostic sects, the Mandaeans count as an important Easternvariant. Their often hauntingly beautiful literature depicts the mythological struggle between theworlds of light and darkness and the ascent of the soul through the seven hostile planetaryspheres on its heavenly journey to its home in divinity. Central to Mandaean cultic ritual isimmersion in living water through which the believer is purified and enters into communion withthe world of light (Rudolph 360). But unlike the Christian Gnostic sects, which regarded theearthly Jesus as the Gnostic revealer, the Mandaeans rejected Jesus as a false prophet and agentof the ruler of darkness. Their name derives from the Aramaic word manda, which is equivalentto the Greek word gnosis. Both mean “knowledge.”Attempts to pinpoint the main lines of belief shared among the diverse sects have led tocontradiction and confusion. Participants attending the 1966 Colloquium of Messina on \"TheOrigins of Gnosticism\" attempted to sort out the terminological muddle by defining gnosis as\"knowledge of the divine mysteries reserved for an élite.\" Gnosticism, by contrast, wassummarized in the idea of “a divine spark in man, deriving from the divine realm, fallen into this"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 8world of fate, birth and death, and needing to be awakened by the divine counterpart of the self inorder to be finally reintegrated.”7Hans Jonas, a pioneer of the modern study of Gnosticism, emphasizes repeatedly theradically dualistic mood of the Gnostic revolt against the cosmos as the foremost featureunderlying the Gnostic attitude as a whole. To this must be added that some authorities regardthe main currents of Gnosticism as far less extreme. Elaine Pagels, for example, who broughtGnosticism to a broad audience with her book The Gnostic Gospels (1979), treats the Gnosticsas an unfairly demonized group of harmless sects. Their insistence on the priority of directreligious experience over blind religious faith, she argues, could have enriched the Christiantradition if the early church had not suppressed their communities and teachings. In stamping outGnosticism, Christianity lost the radiance and vitality that accompanies the individual’sexperience of God. In Rethinking Gnosticism: An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category(1996), Michael Williams contends that \"Gnosticism\" as constructed by historians of religion isso rife with contradiction and that it cannot do justice to the real diversity of the traditions itpretends to encompass. “Biblical demiurgical traditions,” Williams suggests, would provide amore precise category for organizing many of the texts usually described as Gnostic (265-66).Without contesting the merit of Williams's case, I am following Jonas's analysis for themost part because his groundbreaking book on Gnosticism, Gnosis und spätantiker Geist(Gnosticism and the Spirit of Late Antiquity) dates from the late 1920s when he studied underBultmann and Heidegger. The first volume of this work appeared in 1934; the second followedtwenty years later, delayed by the hardships of exile and flight from Nazi persecution. Jonasproceeded out of a feeling of affinity linking his own age with the world of the ancient Gnostics,which makes it an especially rich source for grasping the reception of Gnosticism during theperiod of my study. While recent studies have filled in much more of the picture of ancientGnosticism, Jonas’s work remains unique and indispensable.The subversive notion that the transcendent God did not create the world as told inGenesis weaves through the various Gnostic cosmogonic myths as a common baseline. The"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 9transcendent and true God of the Gnostics is an absolutely remote, alien, and unknown divinitywho has no connection to the created world at all. To account for the creation, the Gnostic talesunfold a mysterious crisis in the Godhead that resulted in the primordial soul’s descent andentrapment in pre-existing matter, as told in the prelude to Mann’s Joseph tetralogy. Or,according to another tradition, the crisis in divinity ends in the procreation of a monster god, theDemiurge, who then proceeds to fashion a monster realm of materiality as a grotesque imitationof the perfect realm of light. The Demiurge completes his evil handiwork by creating a dense andperishable body to trap the light of the spirit and bind it to the iron laws of fate. NamedIaldabaoth in some Gnostic texts, this creator god appears as a petty, tyrannical lawgiver andnone other than the Hebrew God of the Old Testament. The lower world fashioned by theGnostic Demiurge bears no likeness to the higher world, as we see in Neoplatonic thought;Ialdabaoth's workmanship issues instead in a completely bungled and evil realm. Accounting forthe problem of evil lies at the heart of these speculations, which Gnostics engaged much moredeeply than other systems of thought.According to many ancient Gnostic sources, the believer faces this predicament withfeelings of uncompromising hostility toward the body and the material universe, variouslydescribed as a \"closed prison,\" an \"abode of death,\" a \"sea of darkness,\" and so forth. This feelingof cosmic anguish saturates the body of Mandaean and Manichaean literature, as captured in thistypical fragment from a Manichaean lamentation about the fate of the soul:And who led you from your wonderful divine land into banishment, and whofettered you?And who jailed you in this dark prison, this incarceration, this place with norefuge, which constitutes this body of flesh?Oh god of Light, dear soul!Who trapped you in this satanic creation, that oozes sweet poison, and why (didhe do so)?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 10And who gave you over as a slave to the Devil who nourishes himself in this bodyin which a great snake (greed) resides?And who has made you a servant of his dark, shameless, unquenchable, vile fire?Oh god of Light, dear soul!Who has sundered you from eternal life? (Klimkeit 149-50)The entrapment of the divine spark of light within the dark material realm accounts for thehuman condition of alienation, according to Hans Jonas, and the accompanying feeling of dreadand homesickness in the world in which we exist as strangers in exile. It also fuels a spirit ofrevolt against the kingdoms of the world that cannot be redeemed by politics or the progress ofhistory.As seen in the prelude to Mann's Joseph novels, the transcendent God cannot remainindifferent to the plight of the lost sparks of light because as long as they remain trapped belowthe Godhead is not whole. Through gnosis, those spiritual members of humanity infused withthe sparks of light enter into an extraordinary drama of redemption that precipitates divineredemption as well. The moment of gnosis floods the knower with remembrance of the divineorigin and destiny of the inner spark, as framed in the widely repeated formula attributed to theGnostic Valentinus:What makes us free is the knowledge of who we were, what we have become;where we were, wherein we have been thrown; whereto we speed, wherefrom weare redeemed; what is birth and what rebirth.8This saving knowledge is reserved for an elite group of \"knowers,\" called pneumatikoi. They aredeemed superior to the unenlightened and purely materialistic masses who have bodies but notthe light of the spirit. In Greek and Coptic Hellenistic sources, the sparks of light are also calledpneuma, from the Greek word for spirit, while the Mandaean texts use the term “soul” to refer tothe transcendent and unworldly self within (Rudolph 88-91).The Gnostic awakens to this saving knowledge through a \"call\" from the beyond, fromthe Gnostic Savior and heavenly twin, whose revelatory message penetrates the slumber,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 11intoxication, or forgetfulness induced by the noise of the world. Through gnosis, the knowerexperiences a reunion with the knower's own true self, the spark that came from divinity beforethe creation of the world. In the Book of Thomas the Contender, the Savior exhorts JudasThomas, \"my twin and true companion,\" to:Examine yourself and learn who you are, in what way you exist, and how you willcome to be. . . . For he who has not known himself has known nothing, but hewho has known himself has at the same time already achieved knowledge aboutthe depth of the all. (Robinson 201)The understanding of gnosis as the discovery of the true self, the ancient spark within, providedthe point of departure for the adaptations of Gnosticism by C. G. Jung and Harold Bloom, as wewill see in the next chapter of this study.In his paper \"Delimitation of the Gnostic Phenomenon,\" presented at the Colloquium ofMessina, Hans Jonas spoke to the mood, attitude, and style of ancient Gnosticism that arerelevant to later literary appropriation. One of the defining strategies deployed in Gnostic texts,Jonas notes, entailed subverting biblical tradition. Using a method of reverse or inverse exegesis,Gnostics downgraded the Old Testament God by identifying him with the evil Demiurge whilealso upgrading biblical pariah figures such as Cain or the serpent in the Garden of Eden as thebearers of the heritage of gnosis (102). As we will explore further in chapter four, this strategyreappears in Byron's Cain: A Mystery (1821)9 as well as in Hermann Hesse's Demian (1919) andin other texts.Jonas also describes the Gnostic mythology as secondary, artificial, and derivative,consisting of \"pirated elements of earlier myth\" adapted with much ingenuity into the grandGnostic design (100-01). In other words, much of Gnostic literature achieves its meaning notthrough original revelation but instead by inventively reworking existing mythic and biblicaltraditions to invert their teachings and to express a radically reordered worldview. Jonas links theartificial and second-hand quality of Gnostic literature to the historically “late” period in which itarose (101), namely during the merging of ancient Eastern and Western cultures into the vast"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 12domain of the Hellenistic world. This period produced a new religious syncretism, involving thecreative fusion of free-floating elements from existing religious traditions of the ancient East andWest, which Jonas regards as central to the phenomenology of Gnosticism. In the next chapter ofthis study we will look at the correlation between what Harold Bloom describes as Gnostic andmodern “belatedness,” that is, the predicament of following in the wake of breakthroughmoments of historical and creative renewal. Thomas Mann, like his character Leverkühn,occupied the transition space between the waning tradition of the nineteenth century and thevital new beginning. And like his character, he forged originality out of the remnants of the dyingtradition by pirating borrowed material into his own radically reordered designs. This methodcounts as one of the stylistic hallmarks of literary modernism.Jonas also emphasizes the distinction between the catastrophic character of the Gnosticsystem and the closely related Neoplatonic system, in which the lower world is inferior to butnonetheless in harmony with the upper world. Jonas points to the extremism that distinguishesthe pessimistic and world-rejecting character of Gnostic dualism from the more optimistic andworld-affirming Neoplatonism and Hermeticism. While these schools coexisted in the ancientworld and shared many crucial features such as a common belief in the saving power of gnosis,yet their beliefs concerning the human condition in the world and the nature of God remainedfundamentally different.10It is important to note, to be sure, the subversive extremism that distinguishesGnosticism from all other schools of thought. Viewed from a longer perspective, however,Gnosticism appears as part of a continuum of dualistic thought that includes pessimistic andoptimistic variants. In his essay on the progress of religious ideas, \"Religious Evolution,\" RobertBellah describes the emergence of the historic, transcendental religions in the ancient world duringthe first millennium B.C.E. as:the phenomenon of religious rejection of the world characterized by an extremelynegative evaluation of man and society and the exaltation of another realm ofreality as alone true and infinitely valuable. (22)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 13Bellah includes Platonic philosophy in this category (where the body appears as “the prison ofthe soul\"), along with monotheism in Israel, Buddhism in India, and Taoism in China. Seen fromthis horizon, Gnosticism amounts to a radical member of a dualistic family of religious thoughtthat emerged at a certain point in history and has since receded in favor of a renewed spirit ofworld acceptance. While Bellah's overall picture of the eclipse of dualist religious thought mayaccurately capture the broad historical sweep, the argument developed in the chapters that followtakes a phenomenological view that a world-rejecting yet numinous sensibility we can callGnostic has reappeared in conjunction with the crisis and malaise associated with modernity.The Recovery of Ancient TextsTo prepare the ground for the chapters that follow, we first survey the emerging profileof Gnosticism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the ancient Gnostics beganto reappear on the intellectual landscape of Europe thanks to a growing body of texts. As we willsee, the rediscovery of original Gnostic documents during this period touched off a lively roundof scholarly debate that rippled into popular culture. Through the esoteric school of Theosophyand its offshoots, Anthroposophy and the Quest Society, seeds scattered widely into literatureand art, as well as into the ideological agenda of the rising völkisch movement that became theprecursor to fascism in Germany.11Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, early Gnosticism was known almost exclusivelythrough quotations from lost Gnostic texts contained in the anti-heretical writings of the churchfathers Hippolytus, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and others. While these attacks were meant to demolishGnostic heresy through polemic and ridicule, they unwittingly managed to preserve a crudeoutline of its thought through the ages until some original Gnostic texts began to surface.Gottfried Arnold’s Unparteiische Kirchen- und Ketzerhistorie (Impartial History of Churchesand Heresies, 1699) offered the first critical appraisal of the church fathers’ polemics against theGnostics. Arnold was an impassioned advocate of the Pietist movement that arose primarily inGerman domains in the seventeenth century as a revolt against the empty intellectualized faith of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 14the institutional church. Arnold enlisted the ancient Gnostics as persecuted disciples of theauthentic religious experience of primitive Christianity and forerunners of the Pietism of his day.Subsequent Enlightenment skepticism added to the resistance to institutional religion andpromoted the critical rereading of the church fathers. A number of important monographsfollowed the direction established by Arnold of casting the early heretics in a newly favorablelight. Among these must be counted works by August Neander (1818), J. Matter (1828), andFerdinand Christian Baur (1835).12In 1842, a manuscript hunter in the service of the French Government tracked down anearly third-century patristic text in a convent on Mount Athos. Initially attributed to Origen andother authors, majority scholarly opinion finally agreed that the text contained the long-lostsections of the Philosophumena by Hippolytus, also called The Refutation of all Heresies.Publication followed in 1851 by the University of Oxford. Hippolytus’s text turned out to be averitable encyclopedia of thirty-three Gnostic sects (starting with the Naassenes at the forefront)systematically catalogued in order to demonstrate that they derived not from pious Christianitybut rather from pagan philosophy, mystery cults, astrology, magic, and the like. In other words,Hippolytus’s refutation of Gnostic heresy rested on showing that it was a not so much aChristian as a pagan phenomenon (Rudolph 13-14). In his book Fragments of a Faith Forgotten(1900), G.R.S. Mead, a scholar of the history of religions and a foremost popularizer ofGnosticism, declared the Philosophumena to have revolutionized the study of Gnosticism (608-09). The Philosophumena set the stage for the voluminous collections of the writings of thechurch fathers -- much of it consisting of their anti-Gnostic treatises -- published over the nextdecades. By 1888, collected editions of these writings had appeared in Latin, French, English, andGerman.13The year 1851 also marked the first publication of one of the few then-known originalGnostic texts, the Coptic Pistis Sophia, with Latin translation by M. G. Schwartze. A Germantranslation by C. Schmidt appeared in 1892, followed by the French edition translated by E.Amélineau in 1895 and the English edition translated by G.R.S. Mead in 1896. The Two Books of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 15Jeu appeared in Amélineau's French translation in 1891, followed by Schmidt's German edition in1892 (Rudolph 27-28). Other Gnostic texts such as the Hymn of the Pearl, the Apocryphal Actsof the Apostles, and the Odes of Solomon also entered the cultural stream during the years aroundthe turn of the century. Newly discovered Mandaean and Manichaean texts further spurred themounting interest when they began to appear in scholarly editions beginning in 1904.14The appearance of these original Gnostic and heresiological sources triggered a wave ofsecondary and popular treatments aimed at reexamining the origins of Christianity in light of thenew Gnostic finds. Among the most notable secondary sources must be counted Adolf vonHarnack's Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte (Textbook of the History of Dogma), which wentthrough several editions beginning in 1886. His Marcion: Das Evangelium vom fremden Gott(Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God, 1921) sparked heated debate among Germanintellectuals during the early Weimar era. Harnack's treatment completed the rehabilitation of theGnostics begun by Gottfried Arnold by establishing the once-discredited heretics asphilosophers of religion whose beliefs contributed significantly to the development of Christiandogma. When Hans Jonas’s Gnosis und spätantiker Geist appeared in 1934, it marked a newthreshold of insight into ancient Gnostic myth and speculation. Based on his study ofrediscovered texts, Jonas amalgamated the worldviews of Christian Gnostic schools with those ofEastern Mandaean and Manichaean mythology in a unified body of thought. Together theycaptured the experience of cosmic estrangement of late antiquity. Jonas designated thesepluralistic traditions as a religion in its own right, the Gnostic religion.An entirely different vein of scholarship and criticism investigated the phenomenon ofJewish Gnosticism. Heinrich Graetz's early monograph Gnosticismus und Judenthum(Gnosticism and Judaism, 1846) first noted the analogies between Jewish mystical speculationabout the celestial chariot (the Merkabah) envisioned by the prophet Ezekiel and Gnosticspeculation about the pleroma. Graetz attributed these parallels to the destructive influence of aforeign Gnostic sensibility that had infiltrated Judaism to produce what he regarded as the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 16dangerous phenomenon of Jewish Gnosticism. In a series of studies starting in 1928, GershomScholem drew on Graetz's work and the Gnostic Pistis Sophia to develop his counter-argument,namely, that Jewish Gnosticism was no heretical foreign hybrid but rather a revitalizingdevelopment within rabbinic Judaism. In 1924, a new edition appeared of the writing ofNachman Krochmal, an early nineteenth-century scholar who first pointed to the parallelsbetween the Kabbalah and Gnosticism in their closely related teachings of the hidden God andthe hypostatization of God's attributes. Following Krochmal, Scholem founded his understandingof the Kabbalah on the premise that its central myth is Gnostic, as detailed in studies publishedover the course of decades, starting in 1928. While Scholem borrowed from Graetz andKrochmal, he radically reversed their negative assessment of the Gnostic patterns in Jewishmysticism.15 In the chapter that follows, we will consider the contributions of Jonas andScholem to the evolving image of Gnosticism in greater detail.Gnosticism in the Comparative Study of ReligionThe search for the origins of Gnosticism captured attention during this period especiallyamong scholars in the comparative study of religion. The religionsgeschichtliche Schule (Historyof Religion School) at Göttingen became a center for comparative philological research aimed atuncovering what adherents believed was the common mythological heritage of the religions thatarose in the ancient Near East. History of religion scholars scrutinized early texts for evidencebearing on this provocative theory. If Gnosticism could be found in traditions other thanChristianity, it was thought, this evidence would support the view of the Bible as a literaryproduct of regional folk traditions and not divine revelation.Richard Reitzenstein’s study of the first tractate of the Corpus Hermeticum, thePoimandres (1904), argued for regarding this text as a Gnostic document of pre-ChristianEgyptian provenance. The text unfolds the drama of the Primal Man, also called the Anthropos,the luminous child of God's light and love. He descends into the cosmic realm where he becomesthe slave of his love of lower nature, resulting in the creation of planetary human souls and the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 17cycle of desire, birth, and death. Deliverance follows when the human souls, awakened by therevelation of the divine messenger Poimandres, lay aside the garment of the body and return tothe light realm of God by recognizing their divine origin and destiny. Reitzenstein claimed thatthe figure of the Primal Man found in the Hermetic tract had served as the prototype for theChristian Redeemer. Although Reitzenstein’s contentions have not stood up well to subsequentcritical scrutiny,16 at the time of its publication his Poimandres ignited intense interest amongscholars keen on finding further Gnostic redeemer myth prototypes in pre-Christian Egyptian,Babylonian, and Persian folk mythology.At about the same time, a fabulous trove of Manichaean literature and art was reachingthe Museum of Ethnology in Berlin from the steppes of Central Asia. A team of Prussianarchaeologists, who began excavations at the Turfan oasis in Chinese Turkestan in 1902, hadfound a mother lode of ancient manuscripts and other artifacts. The great ferment sparked at thetime by the Turfan discoveries may be compared to the excitement over the Dead Sea Scrolls andthe Nag Hammadi codices discovered decades later (Klimkeit xvii). The Turfan texts left no doubtthat a variety of Gnosticism had taken root and flourished magnificently in far away Central Asiawhere it had blended with the mystical religions of the East. These finds seemed to support therevised view of Gnosticism as not just a development within Christianity, as the church fathersand most preceding scholars had assumed, but rather a key link connecting Christianity to otherand earlier forms of religiosity. Wilhelm Bousset's Hauptprobleme der Gnosis (Main Problems ofGnosticism, 1907) deployed this theory in arguing that the roots of Gnosticism reached into apre-Christian mixture of Babylonian and Iranian mythology. In a lengthy chapter on the PrimalMan, Bousset worked out parallels among supposedly analogous redeemer figures in Jewish,Persian, Mandaean, Manichaean, and diverse Christian-Gnostic traditions.The comparative religion approach -- which Thomas Mann drew on for the cosmogonicand anthropogonic framework of the Joseph novels -- threw the uniqueness of the Christianredemption story into question. The central mystery of Christianity now began to look like a lateadaptation of earlier folk traditions, such as the Babylonian goddess Ishtar's descent into the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 18underworld to bring back the fertility god Tammuz or the annual descent and return of fertilitygods throughout the ancient world. The title of one of G.R.S. Mead’s writings in this vein reads:“Did Jesus live 100 B.C.?” As the inevitable outcome of the comparative approach, relativistichistoricism displaced the authority of divine revelation. Frazer's studies in religious anthropologydating from this same period pointed to the same conclusion. In From Ritual to Romance, JessieL. Weston, a prominent Frazerian, wrote that Christianity was \"no new thing but a fulfilment ofthe promise enshrined in the Mysteries from the beginning of the world . . . \" (149). Weston'sbook appeared in 1920.In Das iranische Erlösungsmysterium (The Iranian Redemption Mystery, 1921),Reitzenstein continued his investigation of the Gnostic Primal Man, arguing on the basis of thenew Mandaean and Manichaean texts that the redeemer myth originated in the dualistic religionof Iran. According to Reitzenstein, the Primal Man is both the savior and the saved, the redeemedredeemer, because the primordial being who falls into material bondage and the heavenly twinwho awakens him through gnosis and brings him home are one in the same. In Gnosticmythology, as in the prelude to Mann's Joseph novels, this identity of savior and saved greatlyexalts the metaphysical status of the human spirit, which precedes the Demiurge and the createdworld in the birth order of existence. Hans Jonas describes this teaching as \"one of the mostimportant traits of Gnostic theology in the general history of religion.\"17According to Reitzenstein, Christianity adopted the redemption story from Iran viaGnosticism. This theory amounts to a dramatic reversal of the image of Gnosticism, from anenemy within the faith to a decisive influence that shaped the central mystery of the faith.Rudolf Bultmann basically adopted Reitzenstein’s theory of a pre-Christian redeemed redeemermyth in his widely influential New Testament studies of the 1920s and 1930s. In his ground-breaking article on the significance of the Turfan sources for understanding the Gospel of John,published in 1925, Bultmann maintained that the Fourth Gospel had its origins in the pre-Christian redeemer tradition, as seen, for example, in the light and darkness dualism of theprologue where Christ appears as a cosmic figure sent in the disguise of a man. “The most"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 19thorough-going attempt to restate the redemptive work of Jesus in Gnostic terms is to be foundin the Fourth Gospel,” Bultmann wrote in Primitive Christianity.18 These studies pointingprovocatively to the imprint of Gnostic figurative language and thought on the Gospel of Johnprovided the intellectual matrix in which Hans Jonas, then a doctoral candidate studying withBultmann, began his immersion into the world of the ancient Gnostics.In The Decline of the West (1918-1922), Spengler added his voice to the growing chorus.The myth of the \"savior in need of salvation\" (the salvator salvandus), Spengler maintained,constitutes the core of what he called \"the Jesus cult.\" The cult appeared also in Jewish, Iranian,and Islamic variants as a new and vigorous religiosity at a decisive stage in the evolution ofWestern culture (2: 212-30). Spengler credits Reitzenstein's Das iranische Erlösungsmysteriumand the Turfan discoveries with shifting the focus definitively to the East, where the real spiritualorigins of primitive Christianity were to be found, in his view, rather than in what he consideredthe dried-up rationalism of the Hellenistic West (213). Jessie L. Weston summed up thisemerging consensus of the day: Imperial Rome had transformed Christianity from a vital Easternmystery cult into a sterile Western world religion by suppressing its Gnostic mystery elementsand kinship with pre-Christian redeemer traditions (151).These salvos must be regarded as an important part of the context in which ThomasMann turned to the legend of the Primal Man for the prelude to the Joseph novels in late 1926.Most of the sources Mann consulted for the biblical background of the novels assume a commonmythological heritage linking Judaism and Christianity with pagan traditions. One of thesesources, Die außerbiblische Erlösererwartung (The Non-Canonical Expectation of Redemption,1927) by Alfred Jeremias, specifically refers to the Babylonian fertility god Tammuz as aredeemed redeemer figure.19 This body of scholarship must have appealed enormously toMann’s notion of individual life as lived myth, as sacred repetition of mythical patterns set bypredecessors long ago. The Joseph novels work out this notion in the frequent allusionssuggesting Joseph’s mythic identity with Tammuz, the Henoch-Metatron figure in Jewish"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 20mysticism, and the future Christian Redeemer, as well as with the Primal Man in the Gnosticmyth told in the prelude to the tetralogy.20 Reitzenstein's theory of an Iranian origin of Gnosticism today stands eclipsed. IoanCouliano has noted that the enthusiasm for deriving Gnosticism and primitive Christianity from\"Aryan\" Iran converged neatly with the anti-Semitic agenda of the völkisch movement as itadvanced during the Weimar era. He accuses the History of Religion School in particular ofcollaborating knowingly or unknowingly with those who were bent on excising the Judaicbackground of Christianity and establishing an \"Aryan Jesus.\"21Adolf von Harnack's still-standard monograph on Marcion, mentioned above, containswhat amounts to a similar message. Harnack highlighted Marcion’s starkly drawn antithesisbetween the lawgiving deity of the Old Testament, seen stereotypically as despotic and cruel,and the good and true God of the New Testament who came to redeem the world from thetyranny of the Hebrew god. In the revolutionary mood of the early Weimar period, Harnack’sMarcion stirred controversy with his argument for separating the \"new wine\" of the newChristian teaching from the \"old wineskin\" of the Old Testament as the necessary fulfillment ofLuther's unfinished revolution. The foremost task facing Protestantism, Harnack maintained, is toliberate the Christian message of ultimate hope and the everlasting love of the good God from itsties to the lawgiving deity of the Old Testament. The Old Testament deserves recognition as acrucial historical document but not as a sacred canon, Harnack concluded, noting with apparentnaiveté that das Volk was falling away from Christianity in protest against the church'scontinuing allegiance to its Jewish heritage (222-23). This example from the writing of one of themost distinguished theologians of his time illustrates how readily the method of reverse exegesisdeployed by Marcion and other Gnostics to vilify the Hebrew God as a bungling Demiurgeplayed into the ideological agenda of the extreme right."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 21Popularization of Gnostic TeachingsG.R.S. Mead, an early adherent of the school of Theosophy, emerged as one of thosechiefly responsible for acquainting wider audiences with Gnosticism as a living wisdom to beexperienced and embraced, not just an academic study meant for scholars. Mead’s steady streamof publications brought Gnostic teachings to the attention of readers hungry for answers to thespiritual malaise of the modern world. Mead authored an early study of Simon Magus (1892), aprimer of Gnosticism titled Fragments of a Faith Forgotten (1900), the three-volume Thrice-Greatest Hermes (1906), an edition of the Pistis Sophia (1896, second edition 1921), and otherbooks and articles too numerous to mention. He also edited the series “Echoes from the Gnosis”that appeared 1906-1908 and the quarterly journal The Quest from 1910 onward. As the privatesecretary to H. P. Blavatsky, the legendary founder of the Theosophical Society, Mead took aneditorial hand to her grand synthesis of the esoteric traditions, The Secret Doctrine (1888),bringing his specialized knowledge of the history of religions to bear on the task.22 Mead'sknowledge of Hippolytus and other original sources that emerged during the previous decades isevident in the ubiquitous presence of Gnostic ideas embedded deeply in the teachings ofTheosophy.Although Theosophy and Gnosticism differ in important ways, the central drama of thefall of divinity into materiality, its entrapment in an alien realm, and redemption through gnosislies at the heart of the “secret doctrine” of Theosophy. Adherents regard this teaching as thehidden truth linking all of the world religions. Thus Theosophy’s fundamental philosophicalunderstanding of human origin and mission in the cosmos is very similar if not identical to theGnostic view. In the final pages of his landmark study of the intellectual history of Westernesoteric currents of this period, The Theosophical Enlightenment, Joscelyn Godwin came to theconclusion that The Secret Doctrine was “perhaps the most substantial statement of a modernNeo-gnosticism” (377). C. G. Jung made a similar assessment: “Theosophy, together with itscontinental sister, Anthroposophy, these are pure Gnosticism in Hindu dress” (CW 10: 83)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 22In concluding this sketch of Theosophy’s role in reviving and popularizing a Gnosticsensibility, it cannot go unmentioned that Blavatsky historicized the cosmic drama by adding aracial theory of human evolution to the overall mix. With this new twist borrowed from diversemythic traditions, the story now unfolds that the divine spark descended through a sequence offour root races (from Lemuria to Atlantis, and so forth). It became increasingly enmeshed in thedense and dark material world before reaching the absolute nadir in the rationalistic, materialisticmodern Western world. The present-day world had become \"a necropolis,\" she wrote, \"whereinlie buried the highest and most holy aspirations of our Spirit-Soul. That soul becomes with everynew generation more paralyzed and atrophied\" (Doctrine 1: xxii). Present humanity, shemaintained, constitutes the fifth root race (the so-called Aryan race), which was cosmicallydestined to lead the way back home, by reversing the devolutionary cycle and beginning the cycleof respiritualization that would eventually complete the cosmic round. Theosophical teachingsaim at helping this process along so that the divine spark might ascend back to its source throughhuman spiritual evolution.This teaching linked the racial destiny of present humanity to cosmic salvation from the\"fallenness\" of the modern world. It is important to note, however, that in Blavatsky’srevisionary myth, the Aryan race referred to the human race as a whole, not to any specific racialor ethnic group and certainly not to the would-be Germanic descendants of Wotan who laterappropriated the Aryan label. By historicizing the Gnostic account of the Fall, Theosophyspoke to the widespread cultural pessimism and despair that permeated the mood of the time. Itoffered not only a mythical account of the human predicament in the disenchanted modern worldbut also an uncompromising confidence in humankind’s spiritual mission and destiny, whichsurely accounts for Theosophy’s enormous appeal.Although Mead’s profile has largely faded today, his role in popularizing Gnosticismaround the turn of the century proved decisive. Theosophy promoted Gnosticism in the popularmind and in the imagination of many artists and writers who drew inspiration from theTheosophical well during the fin de siècle and decades thereafter. In her study of the Russian"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 23Theosophical Movement, Maria Carlson describes its profound impact on the Russianintelligentsia of the Silver Age, among them, Kandinsky, Andrei Belyi, Vyacheslav Ivanov,Scriabin, Berdiaev, and Solovyev. During the period leading up to world war and revolution theseleading figures and many others were swept away by what Carlson calls the \"contemporaryGnostic gospel\" (3). The Irish literary revival of the same period, too, traces much of its vitalityto the participation of W. B. Yeats, George Russell, John Eglinton, Charles Weekes, and CharlesJohnson in the Theosophical Society's Dublin Lodge. Ernest Boyd, the historian of the revival,credited the Dublin Lodge as a literary, artistic, and intellectual center that radiated its influencewidely (214-15).In 1907, Mead formed a splinter group, the Quest Society, which offered lectures oncomparative religion, esoteric wisdom, Buddhism, and diverse subjects on the cultural vanguardat Kensington Hall in London. Yeats, Arthur Symons, Ezra Pound, Dorothy Shakespear,Wyndham Lewis, Rebecca West, T. E. Hulme, A. E. Waite, Evelyn Underhill, Gershom Scholem,Martin Buber, Jessie L. Weston, among others, attended the Quest lectures, which continuedthrough the 1920s, and contributed to Mead's journal, The Quest. Bultmann’s latest Mandaeanstudies appeared in The Quest in 1925-1926; the same volume contained a piece by GershomScholem on the Zohar. Weston relied heavily on Mead's Thrice-Greatest Hermes in her Frazerianstudy From Ritual to Romance, in which she developed an argument linking the Grail legend tothe Gnostic Naassene sect brought to light in the rediscovered Philosophumena by Hippolytus.In the Naassene teachings, Weston maintained, we see the mystery of spiritual regenerationcoupled with ancient fertility cult figures aimed at the regeneration of nature. Weston sees thespiritual mystery and fertility rites as the esoteric and exoteric sides of a unified tradition thatleft its signature on the Grail literature as seen, for example, in the sexual symbolism of the lanceand the cup. In formulating her original, if controversial, interpretation of the Grail tradition,Weston synthesized the theory, methods, and research of comparative anthropology withHistory of Religion studies in comparative religion.23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 24Weston’s reading of the Grail legend sent further ripples into Eliot's The Waste Land,according to his headnote stating that the title, the plan and much of the incidental symbolism ofthe poem were suggested by Weston's book.24 Threads such as these connecting Mead to someof the foremost poets and writers of his era have led some critics to represent Mead as a keyfigure in the transmission of occult/Gnostic currents into literary modernism. In her study of W.B. Yeats, Virginia Moore claims that Yeats consolidated his knowledge of the Western esoterictradition through his reading of Mead’s Thrice-Greatest Hermes (105-12). Mead’s theosophicalreading of Gnosticism is also the key to understanding obscure figures and passages in Pound’sCantos, according to other sources.25 Finally, Mead's influence may have reached as far asZurich, according to controversial claims by Richard Noll, who credits Mead as the main sourceof Jung's information on Gnosticism, from which Jung constructed his theories of the collectiveunconscious and the archetypes.26The popularized Gnosticism of Theosophy struck especially fertile ground in Austrianand German centers of culture. In Vienna, a neo-Gnostic sensibility rooted in the local Wagnercult fused with the Vienna lodge of the Theosophical Society (founded in 1887) to champion thecause of anti-materialism and mystical religious revival. This insurgent spirit radiated widelythrough the Viennese cultural vanguard via the far-reaching influence of major figures such asHugo Wolf and Hermann Bahr. Young Rudolf Steiner also attended these circles; in 1902 Steinerassumed leadership of the Theosophical Society in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria-Hungary.Under Steiner’s leadership, the German Theosophical Society turned out popular editions ofGnostic texts and books about Gnosticism for the lay public through Leipzig’s Eugen DiederichsPublishing Company (Stark 74). These volumes appeared between 1903 and 1910. WhileSteiner’s interest lay in promoting knowledge of the esoteric side of Christianity contained in theGnostic texts, the publications also served the publisher’s ideological agenda, namely, to subvertorthodox Christianity by making available texts that the church considered heretical (Noll 88). In1913 Steiner split off from Theosophy to found a rival movement called Anthroposophy which,like its parent school, remains active to this day.27"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 25When Theosophy entered Prague with the founding of the Blue Star Lodge in 1891 by amember of the Austrian parliament, it fueled an already raging occult revival. One of the lodge’smost colorful founding members was the author Gustav Meyrink, who experimented withesoteric beliefs and practices that fed the plots of his popular supernatural fiction such as DerGolem (The Golem, 1913). Taken all together, Meyrink’s fiction conveys a view of the materialworld as a fallen realm of the damned from which the individual finds redemption by awakeningto knowledge of the spirit’s divine origin. The immense popularity of Meyrink’s novels duringand just after the First World War attests to the appeal of his neo-Gnostic fictional fantasiesamong contemporary readers. Paul Wegener’s two film versions of Der Golem, which came outin 1914 and 1920, transmitted Meyrink’s vision into the heart of German expressionist cinema.After the turn of the century, the rising movement of German nationalism and racisthatred began to discover ammunition for its cause in the Gnostic teaching of the catastrophicintermingling of divinity and materiality. During the decade 1908-1918, popular Viennesevölkisch writers Guido List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels turned out a hailstorm of pamphletscontaining ugly racist polemics based on a crude synthesis of Gnostic myth, the teaching ofAryan racial destiny, and Germanic mythology. In their tracts, the fateful intermingling lamentedin Gnostic mythology was repackaged as sexual intercourse between the Aryan \"god-men\" andracial \"inferiors.\" Lanz cited the Pistis Sophia as evidence underpinning his racist version of theFall (Goodrick-Clarke, Roots 91-95). According to List and Lanz, redemption from this fallenstate required a Manichaean struggle, involving strict racial eugenics and even extermination, alongwith the apocalyptic destruction of the hated modern world in order to return to the ancientParadise, meaning a Pan-German empire purged of racial “inferiors” (95-97). These viciousconcoctions illustrate the extremes to which a teaching of salvation through separation can lead.Other forms of hybrid popular Gnosticism took root in France during these decades,which even witnessed the establishment of a Gnostic church, L'Église Gnostique, in Paris in1888. Symbolist poets active in this resurgent sect reenacted the rituals of the medieval Cathars.Looking broadly at the popularized Gnosticism of L’Église Gnostique, Theosophy, the Quest"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 26Society, and other cultural phenomena described above, one cannot fail to see the immensespiritual void and longing for nothing short of redemption that animated their following. Thesedeep and explosive longings saturate the cultural-renewal discourse of the period stretching fromthe fin de siècle through the war decades.This now completes the outline of the rediscovery of ancient Gnosticism from thetranslation of original texts through its transmission into popular culture and ideologicalcoloration after the turn of the century and into the Weimar era. Taken all together -- the Turfandiscoveries, the comparative religion research reassessing the origins of Christianity, Bultmann’sNew Testament studies, the debates sparked by Harnack’s Marcion, plus the many publicationsaimed at popular audiences -- we can recognize what amounts to a Gnostic revival. Over thecourse of a few decades, Gnosticism emerged from its historical niche as a counter-cultural forcewithin early Christianity to a popular myth accounting for the malaise of the modern world andpromising a means of redemption. And, as the war against institutional Christianity heated up,völkisch movement ideologists enlisted Gnosticism as a potent weapon.The Weimar era proved especially ripe for the revolutionary message of Gnosticismbecause its subversive spirit of revolt and longing for redemption played so readily into thepassions of the day. In his essay \"The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man,\" which appeared in1928, Jung wrote, \"the spiritual currents of our time have, in fact, a deep affinity withGnosticism\" (CW 10:83). The surging crescendo of interest accounts not only for the appearanceof the Gnostic myth in the Joseph tetralogy in late 1926, but also for the Gnostic motifs inHermann Hesse's Demian (1919) and Steppenwolf (1927) and elsewhere in the literature of thisperiod.The broad band of scholarly and popular interest also establishes the context in whichGnosticism was adopted as the earliest precursor for three far-reaching contemporary schools ofthought during the Weimar years: analytical psychology, existentialism, and revolutionarymessianism. As we will see in chapter two, Jung probed ancient Gnosticism for a prefiguration ofhis model of individuation as the path to psychic wholeness. Jung’s most intense period of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 27preoccupation with Gnostic precursors occurred during the years 1918-1926. In hisgroundbreaking study of ancient Gnosticism developed only a few years later, Hans Jonasexposed striking analogues between the cosmic nihilism of the Gnostics and modern nihilismfound in existentialism.Almost simultaneously, Gershom Scholem was developing his argument that the centralmyth incorporated into the Kabbalah by Isaac Luria in the sixteenth century was a form ofGnosticism. Moreover, he maintained, this revival of ancient Gnostic beliefs became the guidingtheology of the messianic revolt against the existing world that gripped Jewish communitiesthroughout the Diaspora from 1665 for more than a century. Unlike all previous scholars,Scholem regarded these extremist currents as not only destructive and dangerous but also as adynamic force that injected needed vitality into the course of Jewish history. While Scholem'sstudies concentrated on the heresy of Sabbatai Zevi, the links into his own time were explicit.Scholem pointed to Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor Adorno as contemporaryideologists of revolutionary messianism.28 In chapter four we will explore how the Gnostic mythScholem identified in the Kabbalah reiterates in Walter Benjamin's theory of allegory andredemptive criticism and in Adorno's negative dialectics. Chapter seven probes the echoes of thischain of thought that sound through the ending of Doktor Faustus.Thomas Mann and Gnostic SourcesAs mentioned earlier in this chapter, the Joseph tetralogy begins with the preludeironically titled Höllenfahrt (Descent into Hell). As Herbert Lehnert, Manfred Dierks, and WillyR. Berger have shown through diligent archival research, Mann drew the material for thisanthropological overture into the origins and fate of humankind from authorities grounded in apan-Babylonian view of the mythic unity of the ancient world. Dierks identified Mann's mainsources as Edgar Dacqué (1924), Dimitri Mereschkowski (1924), and Alfred Jeremias (1916).29The journey downward passes through various provisional origins, from the moonwanderer Abraham of Ur back to the story of the flood, to the lost continents of Atlantis and"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 28Lemuria, and finally to the question: Where was Paradise? Mann’s source Jeremias answers thisquestion with an account of Egyptian, Iranian, Hebrew, and Christian myths of a golden age,which in his view derived from Babylonian astral beliefs. The well-informed narrator of the\"Descent into Hell\" considers but rejects this account as a muddling of what should be consideredseparate traditions – the story of an actual paradise and the legend of a golden age of humanity(GW 4: 38). Paradise, he maintains, preceded the creation of the world. Furthermore, thebeginning of creation was far from any idyllic Garden of Eden. “Es war die Hölle. Vielmehr eswar der erste, verfluchte Zustand nach dem Fall” (38). [It was hell. Rather, it was the first cursedstate after the Fall.] Moreover, the narrator adds, “die Geschichte des Menschen ist älter als diematerielle Welt, die seines Willens Werk ist, älter als das Leben, das auf seinem Willen steht\"(39). [The history of man is older than the material world, which his will produced, older thanlife, which rests upon his will.] These key passages highlight the fallen condition of the worldfrom its very beginning and the precedence of the pre-existent human soul in the birth order ofcreation. Together they establish a cosmogonic and anthropogonic framework for the tetralogyrooted in Gnostic speculation.For the story of the real paradise that existed before the creation of the world, Mann nowturns to one of those Gnostic Manichaean texts uncovered at Turfan and retold in \"Dieislamische Lehre vom vollkommenen Menschen\" (The Islamic Teaching of the Perfect Man), anarticle by Hans Heinrich Schaeder. Schaeder was an Iranologist and adherent of the History ofReligion School who collaborated with Reitzenstein on Studien zum antiken Synretismus (Studiesin Ancient Syncretism, 1926). As Lehnert reports, Mann received an offprint of the article fromSchaeder with an inscription dated September 1, 1926, that is, a few months before Mann beganwriting the prelude to the Joseph tetralogy (\"Vorstudien\" 465). In section 8 of the prelude, Mannparaphrases from Schaeder's article, even incorporating key phrases directly into his narrative,especially those pertaining to the \"perfect man\" and his descent into the realm of materiality.30The story that unfolds in section 8 tells of the first prototype of humanity, whoemanated from the divine source of all being before the beginning of the world. This primordial"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 29human soul rose as a youthful being of pure light, called the Primal Man or perfect man, as wellas Anthropos and Adam Kadmon in Jewish and kabbalist traditions. The narrator reports that thePrimal Man fell in love with his own image reflected in formless matter:Dann aber habe er niederschauend sein Spiegelbild in der Materie erblickt, habe esliebgewonnen, sich zu ihm hinabgelassen und sei so in die Bande der niederenNatur geraten. Eben hierdurch erkläre sich die Doppelnatur des Menschen, welchedie Merkmale göttlicher Herkunft und wesentlicher Freiheit mit schwererVerfesselung in die niedere Welt unentwirrbar vereinige. (40)[Looking down he saw his image reflected in matter, became infatuated with it,went down to it and thus fell in bondage to lower nature. This explains the doubleaspect of human nature, namely, its indivisible unity of divine origin and freeessence with severe enslavement to the lower world.]The created world of solid forms, and also death, comes into being through this union of theprimordial soul of the Primal Man with matter.God then sends a second messenger, the spirit, who is in some mysterious way thePrimal Man's own higher self, his heavenly twin, to rectify the soul’s mistake. The secondmessenger's unequivocal mission is to awaken the forgetful soul:der selbstvergessenen in Form und Tod verstrickten Seele das Gedächtnis ihrerhöheren Herkunft zu wecken; sie zu überzeugen, daß es ein Fehler war, sich mitder Materie einzulassen und so die Welt hervorzurufen; endlich ihr das Heimwehbis zu dem Grade zu verstärken, daß sie sich eines Tages völlig aus Weh undWollust löst und nach Hause schwebt -- womit ohne weiteres das Ende der Welterreicht, der Materie ihre alte Freiheit zurückgegeben und der Tod aus der Weltgeschafft wäre.

And with this the world would end at once, matter would be restored to itsancient freedom, and death would be dispatched from the world forever.]Up to this point, the amazing tale follows the characteristic Gnostic account of the fall ofdivinity and its redemption that was to occur when the primordial soul frees itself from itsentanglement with alluring matter. And yet, the narrator suggests -- and here he begins to revisethe tradition -- this could not have been God's true intention. No matter how unfathomable Godmay be, the narrator insists, the Most High could not really have intended to destroy the createdworld.The narrator now begins filling in the gaps in the narrative tradition with humorousspeculation designed to expose God's hidden intention. It was always God's wish, the narratorhints, to bring about the union of divinity and materiality that would consecrate humankind witha double blessing, from heaven above and from the depths beneath (49). But God felt forced todisguise this plan as a cosmic error in order to avoid inflaming the jealousy of his pious entourageof angels and archangels, who felt slighted by God's interest in the inferior created world and thatlowly specimen, humankind, so readily given to sin.31 By the end of the tale, Mann has craftilyreversed the Gnostic way to salvation with his revisionary sleight of hand. In place of theGnostic flight from the world, we now find instead a world-affirming vision pointing to areconciliation of divinity and matter that repudiates the Gnostic anti-cosmic vision. The doubleblessing redeems the double aspect of human nature as a stage in divinity's rite of passage and inthe evolution of the divine plan.The \"perfect man\" of the tetralogy is -- ironically, of course -- none other than the not-quite-so-perfect, though exceedingly well favored Joseph, whose self-infatuation precipitates hisdownfall.32 He dreams of a living journey into heaven, borne on high on eagles’ wings. There theAlmighty God, enthroned in a palace of sapphire light, exalts him as lord over all the hosts ofangels and archangels, arrays him in a garment of light, and pronounces him the little Yahu, the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 31little God, and also Metatron. The dream ends just as his living flesh turns to flame and limbs tofiery pinions.Joseph's narcissistic dream image of himself as a being of pure light, singled out above allothers for special grace and favor, functions as a humorous foil throughout the narrative againstwhich the events in his life play out in the refractory realm of mundane reality. As a youth,Joseph indeed obtains the special garment, the famous coat of many colors that flashes with thelight of the sun reflecting off its metallic thread. He wins this prize not by the arbitrary grace ofGod but rather by conniving and manipulating his father Jacob's fondness for him as the first sonand likeness to his beloved Rachel. This sign of special favor brings not his elevation above allothers but rather his descent into the pit, where he is left to die by his jealous brothers, followedby a second descent into the \"underworld\" of Egypt, where he is enslaved, tempted by lust, andfinally imprisoned. Joseph subsequently rises from his fall to become lord over Egypt and isactually gilded, exalted above all others, and proclaimed to be the \"deputy God\" and \"deputyHorus\" by order of his indulgent benefactor Pharaoh Amenhotep IV. Joseph fulfills his grandiosedream of apotheosis, not by escaping the wretched world to dwell beside the throne of splendorand glory in a heavenly palace of sapphire light, but rather by remaining in the earthly realm tonourish the people through the long years of famine. Instead of detaching himself from thecatastrophe of creation and winging his way back to his heavenly home, the \"perfect man\" placeshis many gifts at the service of the fallen world to improve its lot through the progress ofhistory. Yet, as Mann wrote to his friend Ernst Bertram during the first months of work on theJoseph (December 28, 1926), the thematic center of the tetralogy is the double blessing that goesboth ways, from heaven above and from the depths below (B 1: 262-63). Joseph’s ready wit,charm, dream interpretation and administrative skills make him the perfect agent for bringing theblessings from above down to earth. But the blessing from the depths below, Jacob’s blessing,goes to Judah, the son most torn by guilt, that God might finally be redeemed by consciousnessof the suffering human condition."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 32The portrayal of Joseph as a participant in the world, a humorously drawn redeemer ofthe mundane realm, reverses the conclusion of the Gnostic eschatological drama contained in theRoman der Seele and works out in rich and amusing detail the narrator’s revision of the Gnosticmyth. Willy R. Berger has rightly noted how the Gnostic myth sets up the theme of the doubleblessing that lies at the heart of the tetralogy as its secret motto (244-48). Joseph M. Kenney hasmoreover shown how the legend of the Primal Man refracts through a thick pattern ofinterconnected motifs as \"a kind of master myth to be glimpsed behind the other myths in Joseph. . .\" (55). As these scholars have recognized, the Roman der Seele must accordingly be seen asmuch more than just one mythical motif among many others woven into the fabric of the novel.It establishes the template for the entire narrative, in which Mann engages and gently “corrects”the world-rejecting Gnostic message at a time when the revival of interest in Gnosticism was atits peak.The tetralogy fulfills what might be called the \"redemption\" of Thomas Mann from theromantic anti-modern, anti-democratic commitment that animated his wartime treatiseBetrachtungen eines Unpolitischen (Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man, 1918). These reflectionsrounded up anxieties widely shared at the time that the German cultural ideal, nurtured on itsfreedom from the mundane concerns of the practical world, stood threatened by the disintegratingforces of the utilitarian, rational, technically efficient West. As is well known, Mann repudiatedthese deeply ingrained sympathies in 1922 following incidents of domestic terrorism, such as theassassination of Walter Rathenau on June 24, by those espousing a perverted version of the pan-romanticism found in Mann’s \"apolitical\" reflections.33 In his many speeches and essays fromthat point forward, Mann committed himself to a new ideal, a “third realm” of future humanityin which the old opposition between mind and body, art and life, and between German cultureand the new democratic state would achieve reconciliation through dialectical synthesis. In hisspeech \"Von deutscher Republik\" (On the German Republic, October 1922), Mann shocked hislong-time allies among the conservative intelligentsia by calling on his audience to support theWeimar Republic, referring to acts of terror that had pushed even him into the Enlightenment"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 33camp. His essay “Goethe und Tolstoi,” revised after the murder of Rathenau, projects a utopianvision that unites what he had previously perceived as irreconcilable opposites in a higher idealof shared humanity. In the conclusion of the essay, Mann designates Germans as the people ofthe middle, destined to unite the spiritual depths of the East with the progressive forces of theWest, nationalism with citizenship in the world.To these new political commitments belonged a new commitment to a type of narrativeMann hoped readers would see as “friendly to life,”34 which he fictionalized for the first time inDer Zauberberg (The Magic Mountain, 1924). The Joseph tetralogy carried forward these newcommitments by correcting and absorbing the anti-cosmic Gnostic redemption story into a pro-cosmic tale of reconciliation between the upper and lower worlds through the progress ofhistory. This reversal of the message of the Gnostic myth, unfolded in the story of Josephbecoming an agent of historical progress, carries the signature of Mann’s dramatic andcontroversial about-face.As he confided to Karl Kerényi, Mann regarded the Joseph tetralogy and the Faust novelas mythological colleagues.35 Indeed, they may be regarded as counterparts or companion pieces,representing the opposite sides of Mann’s legendary Janus face.The Joseph tetralogy establishes Thomas Mann's conscious commitment to a mostly optimisticparadigm and to narrative that is friendly to life. In Doktor Faustus Mann’s pessimism finds itsfullest expression in the story of the modern composer Adrian Leverkühn (1885-1940) whosecreative life coincides with the period of transition from the inherited romantic tradition, seen asoutworn and reduced to clichés, to the radically new avant-garde form of constructivist music.By deliberately contracting syphilis, he bargains away his sanity and the warmth of human lovefor the rapture of creative inspiration needed to make the breakthrough. Twenty-four years ofheightened creativity, aided by the effects of venereal spirochetes on the brain, result in works ofgenius during the years 1906-1930, ending in his final collapse and ten years of mentalderangement that mirror the demise of Nietzsche, Leverkühn’s most recognizable biographicalprototype. Narrating the story is Leverkühn’s idolizing friend from childhood, Serenus Zeitblom,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 34who appears as an antiquated relic of the fading age of bourgeois humanism in transition to a newage that rejects wholesale the values of the Western tradition to be replaced by a return to theprimitive. Zeitblom spends the war years 1943-1945 dutifully recording the story ofLeverkühn’s high-flying genius and descent into madness as it entwines with Germany’s infernalpact with Hitler and final descent into hell.In conjunction with his preparatory reading for the Joseph novels, Mann noted that thedeepest past is never gone but is present in every moment.36 He turned to this deeperarchaeological level of his own identity formation immediately upon completing the Josephtetralogy in January 1943, when the darkness of the Nazi horrors overwhelmed the fragileoptimism in which the Joseph novels had been conceived. Reaching back to a conception whoseroots reached deep into the bedrock of his life (GW 11: 157), the author turned from the cheerfulstory of the redemption of the artist and the world, as told in Joseph, to a tragic story of theirmutual damnation. In Doktor Faustus, the novel Mann described as his Parsifal (157) and \"einradikales Bekenntnis\" [a radical confession] (247), he traced the ultimate trajectory of the path hehad repudiated through the fictional fate of the loved but cursed figure of Leverkühn.The route into the inner core of this study passes through two preliminary strata. In thechapter that follows, we look, first, at the affinities between Gnosticism and Western modernitythat began to appear during the period encompassed by this study. Part two narrows in on theGnostic features of European Aestheticism. Part three uses this perspective to explore a Gnosticsubtext in Doktor Faustus. Although the passage through the next chapter is lengthy, Mann andhis work will slip only temporarily from view. He reappears throughout and at the chapter's endwhere the contours of the argument linking Gnosticism with Aestheticism, modernism, andThomas Mann begin to take shape. 1See, among others, Richard Smith, \"Afterword: The Modern Relevance ofGnosticism\" (1988); Cleanth Brooks, \"Walker Percy and Modern Gnosticism\"(1977); Patrick J.

Mann's intensive interest in Jeremias's bookis documented in 43 pages of notes preserved in the Mann Archive, asdescribed by Lehnert in \"Vorstudien,\" 467-71.30In his article \"Apotheosis and Incarnation Myths in Mann's Joseph undseine Brüder,\" Joseph M. Kenney speculates that Mann drew on other sourcessuch as Bousset and Reitzenstein, in addition to Schaeder, for the Gnosticmaterial (40-41).31According to Lehnert, Mann's source for the recurring motif of thejealous angels was a collection Hebrew legends compiled and edited by MichaJosef bin Gorion, Die Sagen der Juden (1919). Bin Gorion was the pen name forMicha Joseph Berdychevsky, a neo-romantic Nietzschean figure who was veryinfluential in the Jewish revival initiated by Martin Buber. Die Sagen derJuden was a key source for the legends Mann incorporated into the Josephnovels. Bin Gorion was also an important influence on Gershom Scholem at atime when his interest in Jewish mysticism was taking shape.32It is worth noting as an aside that Mann marked one of the footnotes inwhich Schaeder drew a connection between the exaltation of the youthful beingof light in the ancient Orient and homoerotic worship of the divine youth inthe contemporary circle surrounding the poet Stefan George. Schaederasserted, \"all dieser Aberwitz hat nicht, wie seine Hierophanten behaupten,in der griechischen Klassizität, gar bei Platon, sein Gegenbild, sondern inder Dekadenz der orientalischen Gnosis” [This nonsense has its counterpartnot in classical Greek culture and in Plato, as its hierophants maintain, butin the decadence of Oriental Gnosticism] (253). Lehnert interprets Mann'snotation as a sign of his secret bemusement at this exposure of the conceitsand carryings-on of the George circle, of which one of his very closestfriends, Ernst Bertram, was a steadfast member.Still, the links connecting ancient Gnosticism with decadence and malehomoeroticism must have resonated in other ways as well, given that theauthor's depiction of young Joseph was drawn from his son Golo's handsomeschool chum and lover Polo. As Golo Mann reports in Reflections andReminiscences, Thomas Mann asked for photos of Polo, to be takensurreptitiously, to use for his portrait of young Joseph (116). During theearly period of the composition of the first novel, Mann was himself activelycultivating his infatuation with a young man from Düsseldorf, Klaus Heuser,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Chapter OneGrimstad 38   whom he met during the family's summer vacation on the Baltic in 1927 (Prater169-72). As we will see in chapter six, in the decadent aestheticism of thefin de siècle, male homoeroticism became a strategy for subverting the lawsof procreative nature -- i.e., its relentless fecundity and life's inevitableconsequence of death and decay.33T. J. Reed charts the critical junctures of the \"redemption\" of ThomasMann in the chapter \"Republic: Politics 1919-1933\" in Thomas Mann: The Usesof Tradition.34In a speech delivered on his 50th birthday in 1925, Mann expressed thehope that posterity would say of his work that it was friendly to life,although it knows death. \"Wenn ich einen Wunsch für den Nachruhm meinesWerkes habe, so ist es der, man möge davon sagen, daß es lebensfreundlichist, obwohl es vom Tode weiß\" (GW 11: 368, original emphasis).35See Mann's letter to Kerényi of November 26, 1947 in Mann, Gespräch inBriefen 156.36This comment is contained in the notes from his reading of DmitriMereschkowski's Die Geheimnisse des Ostens (The Mysteries of the East, 1924),as noted by Lehnert in his \"Vorstudien\" (502)."}]
