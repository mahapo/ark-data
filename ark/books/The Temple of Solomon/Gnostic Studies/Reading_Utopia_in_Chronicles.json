Introductionseparation o f C hroniclcs from Ezra N chcm iah as distinct units w ith dif- ferent aim s and arising in different historical contexts has been accepted by the vast m ajority o f scholars.

O f course, these suggestions h ave been m ad e w ith recourse to the content an d em phases o f Chronicles: priests, Levites, scribes, Z adokites, high priests, and Lcvitical singers to nam e a few.

D a te o f C hroniclesIn m an y w ay s, the lack o f consensus regarding authorship is tied to and paralleled by the various dates suggested for C hronicles, especially w hen m ulti-layered redactional histories o f the text are postulated.

Besides the suggestions o f Freedman and Cross, scholars have also posited a pro-priestly redaction which cuts across Chronicles but is particularly evident in 1 Chr 15-16 and the supposed large insertion o f 1 Chr 23-27; sec the concise articulation o f this view by Piet B.

Rodney K. Duke notes that determ ining the genre o f Chronicles has been perceived by scholars as “the first step towards understanding the [Chronicler's] purposes. The step o f genre analysis, however, is fraught with problems” (“A Rhetorical Approach to Appreciating the Books o f Chronicles,\" in Graham and M cKenzie, ed., T h e C h r o n ic le r a s A u th o r, 100-35 [1 11 ]). The variety o f generic descriptions is reflected by both the difficulty o f the task and the anticipated result o f correct genre identification. For a detailed list o f proposed genres and the scholars w ho advocate them, see my dissertation, “Reading Utopia in Chronicles” (Ph.D. diss., University o f Notre Dame, 2005), 10-13.16. A point echoed most recently by Steven L. M cK enzie, 1 - 2 C h ro n ic le s (AOTC; Nashville: Abingdon, 2004), 33.17. See the insightful com m ents by Tzvetan Todorov, \"The Origin o f Genres.\" in G e n re s in D is c o u r s e (trans. C. Porter; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,1990), 13-26. Noting the difficulty in separating genres, Todorov states: “W here do genres com e from? Quite sim ply from other genres. A new genre is always the transformation o f an earlier one, or o f several: by inversion, by displacem ent, by combination\" (p. 15). A lso. Todorov notes that genres may be present in one culture w hile absent in another, and that this is entirely consistent with the ideological m ilieu(s) o f the society and o f the writer (pp. 18-19). Todorov's view is em ployed in addressing the issue o f genre in antiquity by Daniel L. Seiden, “Genre o f Genre.” in T h e S e a r c h f o r th e A n c ie n t N o v e l (ed. J.

Several nam es a re repeated between the genealogies and the narratives (par- ticularly the Davidic kings, high priests, priests, and L evites), the genealogy o f Saul leads directly into the narrative o f his death in I Chr 10. and the genealogies contain numerous references and allusions to the narratives o f the Pentateuch and the Former Prophets on which they draw for information.

Often passed over without much thought is the fact that M ore's island o f Utopia existed contem poraneously with m edieval England and that the lands of F.uhemerus and lam bulus were also contemporary societies with ancient Greece. Temporal distance is more typically invoked in U rzeit and E n d z e it myths, such as the Garden o f Eden and the N ew Jerusalem or in Plato’s myth o f the then 9.000 year-old Atlantis civilization (in 077. I08e-115d and T im . 23d-25d). In utopian lit- erature and in its related genre o f science fiction, temporal displacem ent can be past or future depending on the individual work; and w hile spatial displacem ent towards the Other is very com m on, it can also be articulated as the Other com ing near.46. Suvin notes that utopias com e in a variety o f m odels and proposals, but a ll of them are o r g a n iz e d; there are no disorganized utopias (M e ta m o r p h o se s, 50).47.

M arxism has traditionally rejected utopia and favored ideology. H ow ever, the typical M arxist definitions o f utopia and ideology are inadequate to account for the true nature o f utopia: it is an ideology, an d o n e w hich can be revolutionary in that it provides a strong social critique.

IntroductionO n e o f his central principles is that the appearance o f a elosed system in utopian literature is really a n illusion.61 T he utopian system resists closure an d rem ains o pen to inconsistencies and change. B o er thus intentionally looks for inconsistencies, im possibilities, and perceived “surprises\" throughout the text focusing on tw o m ain issues: “w o rld reduction״ with its accom p an y in g “ large num bers” in spatial description, and the “inclu- sive/exclusive״ society w ith its b o undary definitions.62 He concludes that these co m m o n utopian concepts m anifest them selves in C hronicles as part o f the C h ro n ic le r's overall argum ents about the nature o f “ Israel” and its relationship to the land. So, for exam ple, by leaving a geographi- cal open in g in R e h o b o a m 's defenses in 2 C h r 10-13 (im m ediately follow ing the division o f the kingdom ), the C hronicler provides a m eans for the N ortherners to jo in Judah at the tem ple.63 B o er next suggests that such openness indicates that “Israel\" is incom plete w ithout the N orth; that is, the C hronicler a w aite d the day 01' full reconciliation betw een N orth and South under the auspices o f the o n e tem ple cult located at Jerusalem .B o e r's use o f geography as an indicator o f utopianism is dependent on M a rin 's spatial analysis o f M o re 's U topia. M arin contends that “ U topia” is not “ no-place” in the sense o f being non-existent, but rather “ the ‘o th e r‘ o f an y placc” w hich docs exist.64 U topia is dialogue w ith spatial representation in a literary arena, w hich is in constant p rocess and61. Jameson notes the importance o f contradictions and the im possibility o f spatial and narrative closure com m on to most utopias despite the appearance o f a detailed system atic order in the utopian society (“Progress Versus Utopia,\" 155).62. Drawing from Jameson (“W orld-Reduction”), Boer notes that \"World reduction is a feature o f Utopian writing\" (\"Utopian Politics,\" 375); in addition, the utopia must not be a com pletely closed society (a com m on m isconception of utopias), sincc outsiders m ust enter, learn, and return to the larger world in order to bring its wonders to light.

If the depletions instead were the aspirations which the Chronicler desired to see implemented, then change would be at the very center o f his purpose; such a shift in thinking is ncccs- sary in approaching Chronicles from the perspective o f utopian literary theory.73.

This individual relates an account o f his time am ong the inhabitants o f the island o f Utopia who live in m any respects a superior life than those in Europe (and in England and France in particular). Before this description (which is really the subject o f Book II), however. Raphael addresses other societies such as the Polylerites among the Persians and debates the various objections o f M ore and G iles to his political philosophy and his criticism ofE nglish society. In this dialogue, Raphael pointedly remarks, “What if I told them the kind o f things which Plato creates in his republic or which the Utopi- ans actually put in practice in theirs?” This is a key point in the work for two reasons: first, it establishes the r e a lity o f the Utopian socicty in contrast to the hypo- thetical nature o f Plato's R e p u b lic , and second, as such a reality it challenges directly the reality o f M ore's present-day England, which can no longer sim ply defer such criticism as com ing only from an abstract and hypothetical society; that is, the alternative reality o f the Utopian society is not “nowhere,\" but exists in the present som ewhere just as the H ellenistic utopias aside from the R e p u b lic often did. Still in Book I, Raphael notes the benefits in the practice o f com m onality o f goods versus the dangers o f private property, which w ill be a recurring them e in Book II. Raphael then em phatically invites his listeners to hear his eyew itness account o f the five years he spent in the incredible Utopia (he left only to make known its wonders) in terms reminiscent o f the ancient historian’s claim s to authority and trustworthiness.76In the final paragraphs o f Book I, Raphael begins to relate the history 01'the island before the trio dccidcs to cat, and then return to hear the remainder o f the talc continued in Book II.

Raphael reports that the island was form erly named Ahraxa and w as connected to the mainland before the eponym ous U topus conquered the land at least som e 1,760 years in the past and ordered the digging o f the great trcnch to separate it as an island. The island now has fifty-four city-states identical in language, culture, and law s, and are laid out in a similar fashion and distance from each other as the topography w ill allow . Besides this “less than perfect\" positioning, there is also a capital city at the center o f the island. The utopian (but not perfcct) geography again is brought up in discussing the cities them selves and the river Anydrus (\"no-water”) which runs asym m etrically across the island.This discussion o f utopian geography is follow ed by an extended explanation of: the political system , work duties, leisure, education, the pursuit o f the arts and science, the repudiation o f gold and wealth and fine attire, social relations which function as if the inhabitants were all a single fam ily, avoidance o f pride and greed, a certain degree o f asceticism and patience in their actions, the allowance o f visitation to the world outside the island, the lack o f m orally corrupt institutions such as brothels and alehouses, the inhabitants' inconsistent attitude toward war, their love o f philosophy, their affirmation o f Greek literature and language, their more humane institution o f slavery, marriage practices, their allow ance o f suicide, the rarity o f divorce (allow ed only for adultery or \"intolerable offensivcncss o f disposition\"), the need for relatively few law s given their education and their equal distaste for lawyers, their avoidance o f treaties, their relations with neighboring peoples, and their diverse religious beliefs.When Raphael has finished his account, the character M ore offers his ow n rcflcc- tions on what he has just heard, noting that: (1) m uch o f it is absurd especially in light o f com m on practice in England; (2) he w ould like to discuss these matters further if possible; and (3) he cannot agree with all o f the description, but “readily admits that there arc very many features in the Utopian com m onwealth which it is easier for m e to w ish for in our countries than to have any hope o f seeing realized.\" With this final com m ent, U to p ia concludes.One o f the main interpretative questions brought to this text has been how to judge M ore’s ow n position and advocacy o f these ideas. Is ”Raphael\" M ore or is the char- acter \"More\" More? D o his concluding paragraphs indicate that this account con- tains many ideas with som e o f greater and som e o f lesser value? H owever these difficult questions are answered, More clearly constructed a society in tension with his present, especially the England o f 1516; he also doubts that any o f the \"improve- ments\" which he has offered in this alternate society would becom e actual practice in his historical reality. Nevertheless, U to p ia exists as an alternative reality that offers a critique o f the present social and political organizations and practices, and More has had his say. His desire to continue the dialogue w ith Raphael about these matters stands, in m any respects, as an invitation to further discussion to whoever77.

More's utopian Utopia is a call to question the status quo, to re-evaluate commonly held beliefs, and to probe the possibility of what England would look like if even some aspects of the society of Utopia were implemented in place of current practices and beliefs.

The second, which focuses on an ideal Jerusalem, has an urban character. The third is the model o f an ideal community, such as w e find in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in the writings o f Philo.

M any exam ples could be offered, but undoubtedly the m ost obvious one is the “priestly courses ״m entioned several tim es in Chronicles and as “twenty-four\" in number in 1 Chr 24:1-19. This “rotation system\" and that there were “twenty-four” o f them arc rcflcctcd by Josephus (C. A p . 2.102-109; A n t. 7.363-367); apparently in Luke 1:5, 8 -9 , 23; and explicitly in the M ishnah (S u k k a h 5:6-8; T a 'a n . 4:1-2; cf. B i t 3:12; T a 'a n . 2:6-7; Y ebam . 11:7; B.

Sim ilar evidence has been adduced from the “priestly rosters\" and calendrical docum ents from Qumran (4Q 320 330). which list the names and sequence o f what appear to be priestly courses in tem ple service. This is often taken as evidence that Chronicles w as recording Second Tem ple practice, which continued from his day down to the destruction o f the temple in 70 C.E.; for exam ple, this is the explicit position o f Gary N.

T h e issue o f a tex t's unity can be assessed in a variety o f w ays: single authorship; multiple authorship from a school o f sim ilarly m inded individuals; single authorship w ith additions m ade to correct o r adjust the text by another individual o r group n o t so sim ilarly m inded; an original text (by either a single o r m ultiple authors) to w hich a n u m b e r o f additions h ave been inserted by an y num ber o f related o r unrelated hands, to nam e only a few o f the options. T he m o re inconsistent or repetitious a single com position tends to be (i.e. possessing contradictory and duplicate m aterial), the m o re redactional layers m ay be posited to explain this situation. This p h enom enon can be found throughout I IB studies, especially in Penta- tcuchal criticism , in the treatm ent o f various prophetic books, an d in studies o f the com position kn o w n as the D euteronom istic H istory (with a n ever-expanding num ber o f postulated redactional sch em es offered to explain its grow th an d the present form o f the text). O f course, Chroni- cles also has not escaped from the scholarly penchant for locating the supposed U rtext and stratifying its layers o f grow th, e ven to the point o f jo in in g the D euteronom istic H istory in its im pending “ death by redac- tion.”21W hile nearly all scholars will allow for the possibility o f at least m inor additions to the basic text o f C hronicles, there has been a long history׳ o f postulating m a jo r additions o r sw e ep in g redactional strata through- o u t the text.

In this g ro w in g trend, a variety o f related term s h ave b een used to express the relationship betw een these tw o generic divisions: prologue, introduction, preface, Vorhalle.

A s they exist as a part o f Chroni- cles. the genealogies do introduce the narrative and m ust be read in con- ncction w ith it. Second, W right has argued that in a structural sense the genealogiesa r e the book. Formally, what is usually called the \"narrative\" o f the book o f Chronicles (1 Chron. 10-2 Chron. 36) is actually the slow er paced repetition o f what has already been narrated in I Chron. 1.1-9.34 itself. W hile details emerge in its retelling, 1 Chron. 1.1 9.34 narrates the funda- mental structure o f the book. Thus, to distinguish between the genealogies and the \"narrative\" is not helpful.26W rig h t’s narratological reading presents the genealogies not only as being intim ately connected w ith the narrative, but as being the book in m icrocosm . T his obviously n o t only enhances the im portance o f the genealogies, but forces a reassessm ent o f the function o f the genealogies as a lengthy introduction dissim ilar in form but not overall content to the narrative w hich follows.T h e clarification o f this reassessm ent m ay proceed w ith attention to som e considerations from Hellenistic historiography. Part o f the difficulty in determ ining the purpose o f the biblical histories (w hether discussing the so-called “ Prim ary H istory,” DtrH, Chronicles, o r E zra-N ehem iah) is that “ no biblical historical book contains a statem ent o f purpose, like that found in H erodotus o r T hucydides.”27 This difference is particularly im portant for those scholars w h o have argued that the best source o f com parison for C hronicles is the H ellenistic historiographic tradition. If C hroniclcs follow s o r fits this tradition, w h y d o es it lack th e m o st basic d istin ctive c h a ra c teristic o f th a t tradition— a statem ent o f purpose typically expressed in a preface?25. Sim on J. D eV ries, / a n d 2 C h r o n ic le s (FOTL 11 ; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans,1989), 14. Thus, for exam ple, w hile the genealogies do contribute much to the concern over the identity o f Israel, even this concept awaits further developm ent in the narrative.26.

The claim s for authority typically made by these authors, nearly alw ays in a preface and always with the explicit intent to supersede previously written histories, stand in marked contrast to all exam ples o f historiography in the I IB (but see 2 M acc 2:19-32).

A G enealogical UtopiaN early all extant historical w orks following in the Hellenistic tradition contain a preface w hich outlines the scope and them e o f the w ork: the tim e period to be surveyed, the m a jo r them es to be addressed, the m ain protagonist(s) involved, the c h ie f conflict to be resolved, an d so forth.28 Y et, H ellenistic historiography docs provide a different approach to the issue o f a preface w hich has g one largely unnoticed and m a y help to elucidate the type o f fu n c tio n a l p re fa c e w hich is found in Chronicles.

As such a didactic work, it both criticizes an d lauds earlier works. A m o n g the m a n y interesting co m m en ts w hich L ucian m akes about the proper w ay to w rite history, the ones o f con cern for possibly understanding the genealogical m aterial in C hronicles are his m usings about the function an d form o f a preface (τ ό ττροο'ιμιον).For L ucian, the preface should be: not “frig id \" (υπερψ υχρο^) or in p oor style (H ist, c o n s c r 16); in the sam e language, dialect, or style as the m ain bo d y (16); n o t overly long o r at least not in disproportion to the length o f the m ain bo d y (23, 55); should m ake only tw o p oints— not three like the rhetors (53); and should transition sm oothly to the narrative w hich follow s (55). All o f these co m m en ts by Lucian refer to the content and form o f w hat can be term ed “ introductory separable prefaces\" that stand apart from the m ain bo d y o f the narrative. Lucian, how ever, dis- cusses another type o f preface— the virtual preface (ώ ς δυνάμει τινσ προοίμια; 23, 5 2 ).,° In these tw o instances, Lucian notes that som etim es28. See Chapter 1 n. 76 for many aneient examples of this.29. While Lucian's work is obviously not contemporary with Chronicles, it contains views of historiographic methodology which go back to the Hellenistic period (he cites 1 lerodotus and Thucydides in Hist, conscr. 54 and Xenophon in 23); Lucian expresses these opinions pcdagogically rather than in practice (as do, e.g., Herodotus. Xenophon, and Thucydides).30. In his discussion of the standard Hellenistic forms, Gregory Sterling citcs these two passages from Lucian as evidence that I lellenistic historiography required a prcfacc and that this form thus distinguishes Hellenistic works from the histori- ography of the HB (Historiography and Self-Definition: Josephos, Luke Acts and Apologetic Historiography [NovTSup 64; Leiden: Brill, 1992], 369, 369 n. 268).

The G en ea lo g ica l Id en tity o f \"Isra el \" in C hronicles: G enealog}’ as U topiaT aken together, the insights o f the previous section clearly dem onstrate that one o f the m ajor purposes o f the genealogical m aterial in Chronicles is to provide the identity o f the entity kn o w n as “ Israel.\" In this section, the construction o f this identity by the C hronicler w ill be explored. H ow ever, tw o additional prelim inary issues w hich directly im p act the interpretation o f this genealogical data (besides the relationship o f the genealogies to the narrative discussed above) m ust be considered before pursuing this notion o f identity an d its form ulation as a utopian construct in Chronicles.First, the issue o f the historical reliability o f the genealogical material, an d the related issue o f the historicity o f C hronicles as a w hole, have been the subject o f m uch debate in determ ining h o w the inform ation ina b s o lu te ly r e q u ir e d to include one, at least according to the possible exception noted explicitly by Lucian.31.

T his has been especially the case for the narrative sections that C hronicles shares w ith Sam uel-K ings. It is here, so the logic holds, that the C h ro n icler’s T endenz can be identified.

H owever, m any scholars w ill disagree with this portrayal o f the quest for sources as difficult at best and hopelessly irresolvable at worst; cf., for exam ple, the “prime importance” placed on this enterprise by Kai Peltonen, “Function, Explana- tion and Literary Phenomena: Aspects o f Source Criticism as Theory and Method in the History o f Chronicles Research,\" in Graham and M cK cnzic. ed., T h e C h ro n - ic ie r a s A u th o r, 18-69 (66); and its “essential\" role in understanding Chronicles by Nadav Na'am an, “Sources and Redaction in the Chronicler's G enealogies o f Asher and Ephraim,” J S O T 49 ( 1991 ): 99 111(100).Two types o f data should be mentioned here. First, w hile m ost scholars have accepted, at least to som e degree, that the Chronicler’s V o rla g e w as closer to that found in the Samuel manuscripts from Qumran than to the M T o f Sam uel, so that every change is not automatically to be ascribed to the Chronicler's T e n d e n z, it is the unfortunate case that only one fragment o f Chronicles w as found at Qumran (4Q 118). thus preventing a thorough textual critical re-evaluation o f Chronicles; see Julio Trebolle Barrera, “Édition préliminaire de 4QChroniques,” RevQ 15 (1992): 523 39; and Knoppers, / C h ro n ic le s I 9. 52 55. Second, it is difficult to hypothe- size about the Chronicler's use o f sources when the only substantial source available for comparison is Sam uel-K ings; did the Chronicler use the sam e m ethodology for all o f his sources or were different sources treated in different ways? That the latter is m ost likely the case can be deduced from the methods em ployed for the hymnic"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"432. A G enealogical UtopiaE xcursus: Prophecy, S p eech es, a n d A u th o rity in C hroniclesThe use and im plied citation o f sources by the Chronicler, and his references to other available ancient records, constitute significant methods by which the m essage o f the book is com m unicated to its audience. Scholars have also seen that the treatment o f prophecy and the numerous spccchcs reported throughout the narrative perform this same function.37 This excursus w ill address briefly the utopian nature o f proph- ecy and speeches in Chronicles. In addition, these two devices are am ong the multi- pie \"authority-conferring strategies\" em ployed by the Chronicler.38 The ability o f the Chronicler to convincc his audience that the utopia presented in the text is indeed a b e tte r a lte r n a tiv e r e a lity rests heavily on the authoritative status o f Chronicles itself. Thus, som e com m ent on the issue o f authority in Chronicles is also required.The unique roles o f prophccy and prophets in Chronicles indicate a transition in the understanding o f these phenomena during the Second Tem ple period. Schniede- wind lists several observations about the prophets in Chroniclcs: (I ) when K ings is unclear about why certain events happened, prophets m ay be invoked to provide the answer in Chroniclcs; (2) they m ost typically function as interpreters o f past and present events, rather than predictors o f the future; and (3) perhaps m ost importantly, prophets have becom e historians, the writers o f the historical sources m entioned in Chronicles.3'׳ If prophets have now becom e writers, this suggests a perceivedcom positions included in I Chr 16:7-36 and the apparent source-texts o f several Psalm s in opposition to those used in conversation with Sam ucl-K ings. Thus, given the probability that the Chronicler used different sources, or even the sam e source, in a variety o f ways, any general statem ents about the Chronicler’s m ethodology in using sources are open to serious debate and ultimately inconclusive.37.

Thus, scribal activity may be considered prophetic in nature. By association, this link established between scribalism , prophets, and historical writing functions as a m eans o f asserting the authority o f the Chronicler's own com position an account o f the past m ost likely written by a scribe w ho would claim the sam e prophetic inspiration for his ow n work as he assigned to the \"prophétie“ scribcs o f the past. This association between prophecy and scribalism has been extended in scholarship recently to a direct relationship between apocalypticism and scribalism in antiquity.However, Chronicles is not an apocalyptic text; nevertheless, it does exhibit scribal features, especially those associated with the w isdom tradition.40 W hile Chronicles certainly exhibits characteristics o f a text produced by scribes, not many scholars would argue that it is a prophetic text, at least on the basis o f form. How- ever, the lack or scarcity o f prophetic oracles does not determine the “prophetic\" nature o f any given text. Chroniclcs itself claim s that historical writings as w ell as oracular material were com posed by prophets in the past.41A s part o f the Chronicler's utopian construct, prophecy functions to connect the past with the present by the interpretation o f events, whether in the form o f historical narrative or oracular material 01־ in a genealogy. Prophecy and prophets function in a v eiy specific w ay in Chronicles: they are one o f the m eans for promoting innovation in the tradition w hile at the sam e time affirming continuity with it. These dual, and seem ingly contradictory׳, functions convey the essence o f the Chronicler's vision for a utopian future without expressing it in the form o f prcdiclivc prophecy. Instead, the past and present are recorded and interpreted by prophets for the benefit o f the com m unity centered around Jerusalem whether in the prcexilic period as in the narrative or in the postexilic period during the tim e o f the Chronicler.The prophecies and speeches related by prophets share sim ilar concerns with the speeches by non-prophetic figures, especially by kings. These “royal speeches” mirror the content o f the prophétie words. Thus, these speeches demonstrate how two sources o f authority— the prophet and the monarch— are em ployed as m outhpieces for the Chronicler's m essage. And yet the Chronicler's concern for authoritative entities is not restricted to prophetic and royal speeches.40.

The division between history and prophecy on the basis o f form is to be rejected. Compare the labels the \"Former Prophets\" assigned to the historical narrative o f the Joshua, Judges, Sam uel, and Kings and the \"Latter Prophets\" used to refer collectively to the books o f Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Book o f the Twelve.

The Chronicler is obsessed with grounding his com position in recognizcd authorities that can support his interpréta- tion o f the past, present, and future.In his own authoritative com position, the Chronicler has rctrojectcd his utopian vision into the past in order to actualize it in his present and into the future. This utopian vision does not replicate the past or continue the s ta tu s q u o o f the present. In these appeals to authority, the Chronicler critiques the present and offers his under- standing o f a b e tte r a lte r n a tiv e r e a lity anchored in the words and in h e r e n t authority o f these personages and concepts. It is significant that the Chronicler does not offer an apology for their authoritative status. Recognition o f their prestige or esteem by his audience does not seem to have been a concern for the Chronicler, w ho does not defend his selection o f supporting authorities. In fact, the Chronicler has not created new sources o f authority,45 but draws on those already prominent in the tradition.42. N ote that the concern o f these authoritative citations clearly involves action, practice, or ritual observance. These sources o f authority arc not typically employed to provide a basis for a particular belief or article o f faith independent o f its practical manifestation in the reality o f the com m unity.

This is true despite the “création\" or presentation o f specific prophets known only in Chronicles. That is, the Chronicler may “invent\" particular individuals, but their authority is based on their identity and function as prophets just as with those personages known from other sources who are also prophets."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Reading Utopia in Chronicles46W hile the Chronicler may not have invented the terminology for these authorities, he may have created their content. In other words, the Chronicler chose categories from his ow n day that were already invested with authority and supplied the content to allow for these sources to support his own presentation o f Israel's past. In the créa- tion o f the contcnt o f these sources, the Chroniclcr anticipates a trend in later Jewish literature to appeal to sources o f authority for supporting particular practices.‘6 With these various strategies for conferring authority, the Chronicler attempts to solidify the status o f his own com position.It is true that the Chronicler wrote a new text instead o f editing an existing docum ent, but this does not help to clarify the authoritative status o f the source material in the perspective o f the Chronicler. The relationship o f Chroniclcs to both the Torah and to Sam uel-K ings (in whatever textual form s the Chronicler may have encountered them) cannot be reduced to the sim ple dichotom y o f a new work designed either to \"supplant״ or \"supplement” other texts, using the terminology often em ployed in scholarship. Chroniclcs cannot dism iss Sam ucl-K ings but neither does it require Sam uel-K ings to be read synoptically to elucidate meaning.47 The Chronicler constructs a different history, a b e tte r a lte r n a tiv e r e a lity, that som etim es affirms and often contradicts both the Pentateuch and Sam uel Kings as w ell as the society o f his own tim e. The sam e tension betw een continuity and innovation that is characteristic o f prophecy, speeches, and authority in Chronicles is manifested in the Chronicler's vision o f the future, which is presented as a utopian history׳. The prob- ability o f acceptance o f this utopian vision by the Chronicler's audience is bolstered by the repeated and variegated claim s to authority m ade throughout the work, including source citations, references to other ancient records, prophecies, and royal speeches, am ong others. Thus, as with many o f the Chronicler's prominent ideologi- cal m otifs, these issues are not the primary concern o f his com position. Rather, just as w ith other important concepts, these conccm s also contribute to the effectiveness o f the utopian ideology that dom inates the Chronicler's history.2.2.1.

The “T w elve T rib e s\" o f U topian Israel: Id en tifyin g \" Is r a e l'’ From these previous exam ples and discussion it is evident that the iden- tity o f “Israel\" requires further exploration. A s regards the lengthy genea- logical m aterial, a m o re detailed and com prehensive analysis m ust be attem pted; how ever, a system atic treatm ent o f every co m m en t an d each verse in these nine chapters o f C hronicles is not the procedure under- taken in this projcct. Rather, so m e prelim inary discussion o f the issue o f identity, especially as it has been applied to C hronicles, will be followed by a treatm ent o f this concept from the perspective o f utopian literary theory w ith exam ples from the genealogical m aterial in 1 C h r 1-9.T h e concept o f “ identity\" refers to the attem pts by a group at self- definition, typically through the construction o f “boundary-m arkers” (i.e. practices and beliefs that differentiate them selves from others). These boundary-m arkers m ay take the form o f confessional statem ents o f internal co m m o n ality regarding b e lie f system s, adherence to a religious code o r a particular w orldview , o r they m a y be expressed in the practical an d external m eans o f clothing, food, dress, culture, etc. If these bound- ary-m arkers not only separate individuals or g ro u p s o n the basis o f practice an d /o r beliefs but also on the basis o f ethnic continuities, then cultural differences becom e tied to genealogical relationship in the attem pt at group self-definition. It is at this final point, ethnic identity, that m u ch o f the research into identity, and specifically in determ ining the identity associated w ith the term “ Israel ' in the S econd Tem ple period, h as been undertaken. It is clear from even a cursory reading o f the genealogies o f 1 C h r 1 9 that they arc en g ag ed in this type o f défini- tion o f identity: one expressed in term s o f ethnicity and biological relationship.H ow ever, the prim ary function 01' 1 C h r 2 - 9 (ch. 1 is co n cern ed w ith identity o f a different sort; see below in Section 2.2.4) is not to explain how this entity o f “Israel\" is distinct from others in term s o f boundary- m arkers. T h e se chapters neither list those w h o arc cxcludcd n o r d o they describe the practices and beliefs that separate \"Israel\" from the Other. Rather, they are concerned prim arily w ith the internal organization o f this “ Israel\" by expressing interrelationships betw een those w ho are, o r sh o u ld be, considered to be a part o f this “ Israel.”It has b een assum ed, as noted previously, that the inclusion o f ele- m cnts into these lists o f non-Israelites (those w h o should be labeled as “ O ther\" and possibly excluded) w as undertaken to provide a m eans o f legitim izing the standing o f these g ro u p s at the tim e o f the C hronicler; thus, because o f the significant role in w hich so m e individuals o r groups w ere functioning a lrea d y in th e h isto rica l rea lity o f the S econd T em ple com m unity despite their ethnic identity, these groups w ere “baptized\" or"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Reading Utopia in Chronicles54“transplanted\" into the genealogical system in order to provide them with the appropriate genealogical credentials to maintain the sta tu s qua and to continue in their roles w hich required a specific ethnic identity on the part o f those functioning in them .62 T hus, the issue o f identity has often b een reduced by scholars to one o f legitim acy.H ow ever, utopian literary theory reads this evidence in a dram atically different w ay w ith different conclusions about the functions and pur- poses o f the genealogies o f the “ sons o f Israel.\" U topian literary theory begins w ith the notions o f “defam iliarization\" and critique o f the present reality. R ather than beginning w ith the assum ption that historical reality is reflected in the text, the foundational principle in utopian literary theory is that the critique o f present reality through the depiction o f an alternate reality is the m ain objective o f the representation o f the society being portrayed in the text. T hus, the text does not provide an argum ent for the legitim acy o f current social relationships, b u t contends in direct contrast that the present society is deficient and should instead be reform ed in light o f this b e tte r a ltern a tive reality.T h u s, d raw in g on a previously m entioned exam ple, the inclusion o f K enites into the line o f Judah (1 C h r 2 :5 0 b -5 5 ) is not a result o f the K enites having risen to places o f prom inence in the S econd T em ple c o m m u n ity an d the subsequent need to affirm unequivocally their status as authentic Israelites.63 Rather, utopian literary theory w ould suggest that the historical im portance o f K enites at the tim e o f the C hronicler is irrelevant to their inclusion in the genealogical lists o f the “ sons o f Israel.\" T h eir significance lies instead in their association as “ friends” or allies o f “ Israel,\" o r at least as positive exam ples in Isra e l’s past to be em ulated regardless o f ethnic descent, as they are depicted in various o th er texts, w hich w ere m ost likely available an d certainly at least their traditions kn o w n to the C hronicler.64 T h e K enites becom e a cip h er for those in the land, regardless o f true descent, w ho are part o f “Israel\" in term s o f action o r exam ple.

In Ruth, the great king o f Israel acquires a M oabite heri- tage.66 R uth, w ith its concluding genealogy, thus reads as a co m m en t on the position o f foreigners in society; that is, it apparently ends by posing the question: “ E ven the greatest king o f Israel w as o f foreign descent, so w hat is the problem w ith foreigners and w ith interm arriage w ith them ?”In Israel's past, so C hronicles contends, foreigners have either aided or been exam ples for “ Israel” and they will continue to be so in the present an d in the future.67 C hronicles seem s to suggest in the genealogies that if such foreigners will not be accepted by those claim ing to be “ Israel.”65.

Instead, this view contends that the argum ent is being w aged on the level o f ideology, and rather than affirm ing the sta tu s q u o, this description is a criticism o f it. “ Israel” is not a “closed\" entity; it is a fluid term capable o f constant redefinition.

T hat is, it has been repeatedly asserted that the genealogies serve to legitim ize the situation o f the C hronicler’s time, to provide a m e a n s by w hich to allow so m e individuals to serve as priests o r L evites to the exclusion o f others, for exam ple. H ow ever, this can hardly be the case since only tw o lists, the D avidic line and that o f the leading priest, actually extend to the postexilic period (and e ven the line o f the leading priest does not extend beyond the return in Chron- iclcs; only the list in N eh 12:10 11 docs so).

W ith this qualification to the com m only accepted view o f the structure o f the genealogies, an exam ination o f the content o f 1 C h r 1 -9 indicating an im portant role for these tw o tribes is required.T o begin, Judah is explicitly said to have becom e “great am o n g his brothers” and a \"ruler (נ ג י ד ) cam e from him \" (1 C h r 5 :1-2). T his state- m ent, o f course, does not actually occur in the Judahite genealogies o f chs. 2 - 4 . W hen J u d a h 's genealogy is the first to b e listed follow ing the n am in g o f Israel's tw elve sons in 2:1 2, no reaso n for beginning with Judah rather than R euben (01־ Jo sep h o r Levi, for that m atter) is provided.

T he statem ent regarding J u d a h ’s prom inence is actually a sid e-co m m en t in the larger discussion o f w hy R euben is not listed first, as o n e m ight expect. The m a jo r concern is to explain that R euben w a s not listed first due to his infidelity, as draw n from G en 35:22; 49:3 4, and that the sons o f Joseph are the authentic recipient o f the birthright in his place— a n association n o t stated in G e n 4 8 :1 -2 2 , but m ad e explicit in Chronicles.T his concern to elevate the (N orthern) Joseph tribes has attracted m uch scholarly attention, especially g iv en the larger debate o v e r a supposed “anti-S am aritan” or “anti-N orthem ” polem ic in C hronicles. W'hile this is understandable, tw o points should be brought to the fore.

Further, there is n othing apart from these statem ents in 1 C h r 5 :1 -2 to indicate an y special im portance fo r the Joseph tribes in the rem ainder o f 1 C hr1 9. Second, J u d a h 's attainm ent o f greatness is n o t a result o f hostility tow ard o r m anipulation o f his brothers.

A G enealogical Utopiato fam e.84 T his am biguity over the precise reason for listing Judah first is all the m ore striking given the discussion regarding R euben and Joseph. Is this refusal to attribute the birthright (and its accom p an y in g pow er) to Judah a lim itation on Judah w hich the C hronicler seeks to m aintain? That is, the ascription o f the birthright to Joseph (w hich is first attested in C hronicles) poses a serious problem for those advocating the priority o f Judah over Israel for all tim e because o f the D avidic m o n arch y 's previous authority. T h e C hronicler acknow ledges o th e r form s o f pow er b y recourse to the birthright w h ich h e em p h a tica lly a sso cia tes with Jo sep h . T his could be seen in term s o f a utopian critique o f claim s from Judahites for p o w e r o r increased p ow er during the C h ro n icler's ow n time. T hus, according to the C hronicler, the descendants o f Judah do not have a d e fa c to claim to positions o f authority based on genealogical descent from either D avid o r the ep onym ous ancestor him self. The C hronicler, at least based on 1 C h r 5 :1 -2 , w ould allow a m eans for the descendants o f Joseph to contest such a view.T h e focus o f the Judahite genealogies is, o f course, the D avidic line in ch. 3.85 H ow ever, even this sim ple statem ent requires qualification: w hile the m a n y sons o f D avid are listed and alluded to vaguely in the seg- m ented genealogy o f vv. 1-9, it is only the descendants o f S olom on w ho arc recorded in a linear fashion in vv. 10 24. Follow ing the pattern o f the practice ad d u ced in the o th e r lineages, it should thus be concluded that the prim ary line is the S o lo m o n ic line rather than the larger D avidic line. W hile m an y scholars have pointed to this passage as evidence for at least “D av id ism \" in C hronicles (if not cschatological o r m cssianic cxpccta- tion), perhaps a better understanding o f the stru c tu re a n d c o n ten t would be to label this cen tra lity o f S o lo m o n a s part o f the larger p h enom enon o f “ S olom onism \" in Chronicles. That being the case, the focus o f the Judah- itc lineage is the S olom onic line. W hichever association is accepted, it is clear from the tw o previous exam ples that the m o n arch y plays a vital role in the im portance o f the tribe o f Judah.A nother indication o f the significance o f Judah is the “P ray er o f Jabcz\" recorded in 1 C hr 4 :9 10. T his prayer to G o d co u ch ed in a b rief84. There is no explicit causality in the verse: that is, Judah’s prom inence is not explicitly stated to be a result o f this ruler nor is Judah's prom inence the reason that the ruler com es from his line.

W illiam son's argument for a chiastic structure has been widely accepted (\"Sources and Redaction in the Chronicler's G enealogy o f Judah,'\" J B L 98 [1979]: 3 5 1 -5 9 [358-59])."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Reading Utopia in Chronicles64narrative w hich is en tirely u n co n n e cte d to the genealogy o f Judah in w hich it is found deserves special co m m en t on tw o points. First, it is the first exam ple o f a p ray er o r speech in C hronicles, a form w hich is used repeatedly throughout the narrative o f 1 C h r 10-2 C h r 36 to express so m e o f the prim ary theological and philosophical concerns o f the C hronicler, especially the ‘־doctrine o f retribution” and the call to “seek G o d .” A s the first occurrence o f this form, it is o f particular significance. Second, the p ray er a n d narrative speak directly to the relationship o f Israel and its land. Jabcz prays for additional land and is granted it by G od. In a recent article, R. C hristopher H eard argues persuasively that this text functions a s an exam ple to the C h ro n icler’s contem poraries about the p ro p er acquisition o f land in peace w ithout violent o r m ilitary m eans.86 A s part o f this conclusion. H eard notes that Jab c z's reception o f land in peace stan d s 111 m arked contrast to the violence em ployed by the Sim eonites and R eubenites in their successful conquest 01' land in the follow ing tw o genealogies ( 1 C h r 4 :2 4 -5 :1 0 ) an d that a sim ilar point is m ade in the narrative con cern in g Jeh o sh a p h at's non-battle in 2 C h r 30. Such a portrayal o f this individual a s exem plar in contrast even to David, the m a n o f w ar w ith blood on his hands ( 1 C h r 2 2 :7 -9 ), reflects a utopian critique o f m ilitary an d violent conquest.87 Jabez is successful w ithout military effort. Perhaps, as H eard suggests, this is the m essage to the C h ro n icle r's audience. I f this is accepted, the inclusion o f this exem plary individual into the lineage o f Judah, even i f and especially as he is rather poorly integrated into it,ss serves to highlight further the tribe o f Judah.Finally, as noted previously, Ju d a h 's significance am o n g the tribes is indicated by the num ero u s individuals or groups w ho are assim ilated to o r associated w ith it via the genealogies.9 אT here is no com parison w ith86. R. Christopher Heard, “Echoes o f G enesis in I Chronicles 4:9-10: An Inter- textual and Contextual Reading o f Jabez's Prayer,” n.p. [cited 29 Decem ber 2003] J H e b S c r 4 (2002 2003). Online: http://www.jhsonline.org. He also notes that this is the first association o f prayer and land acquisition in Chronicles, tw o important them es which are brought together for the first time here.87. The Chronicler does depict victory in battle as being from God, and righteous kings as victorious in fighting their battles. H owever, the portrayals o f Jabez and Jehoshaphat undercut a clear equation between being righteous and being victorious in battle.88. The failure to provide Jabez with even a m inimal Judahite lineage is all the more striking given the Chronicler's repeated integration o f foreign elem ents into the line o f Judah by a variety o f methods.89. Knoppers (־“ Great Am ong His Brothers,'\" n.p.) notes the following: Calebites, Jerahmeelites, Q enizzites, Canaanites, Q enites, Ishm aelites, Arameans, Egyptians, M oabites, M idianites, Horites, Seirites. and Edom ites ."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"652. A G enealogical Utopiathe o th er tribes o f Israel Judah is by far the tribe m ost involved in these types o f relationships, and w ithout a single hint that this is not acceptable o r to be avoided in the future. T hus, K noppers contends that C hronicles presents “ a Judah that is very m uch connected w ith its neighbors. T he d escendants o f the patriarch, w h o ‘b ecam e great am o n g his brothers, ' do not a p p ear as a n unadulterated, hom ogeneous, and internally fixed entity.”90 W hile not explicitly co m m en d in g the Judahites for this prac- tice, there can be little doubt that the C hronicler portrays these extensive genealogies (i.e. m an y descendants) as one o f the blessings on Judah. T his portrayal w ould fit the theology o f retribution throughout C hroni- d e s (cf. 1 C h r 3:27, w hich explicitly contrasts the Judahites and the Sim eonites in this regard). U topian literary theory suggests that those foreign elem ents sh o u ld h e considered authentically Israelite; they arc included am o n g the genealogies but have no other know n genealogical connection to Israel in extant sources. R ather than providing legitim acy for the current situation, these incorporations suggest an alternative real- ity in w hich these elem ents s h o u ld he w elcom ed w ithin the entity know n as “Israel.” Such a portrayal reflects one position in the larger debate regarding p ro p er interactions w ith foreigners in the Second T em ple period; i f so, this type o f overt inclusion o f foreigners could be seen as a utopian critique o f those h olding a m o re restricted view o f w ho con- stitutes “ Israel.”T u rn in g now to the tribe o f Levi, the case for its “privileged position” rests on a structural argum ent o f its “ central\" placem ent a m o n g the tribes, its overall length, the inclusion o f the so-called “high-priestly\" genealogy o f 5 :27-41 (6 :1 -1 5 Eng.), and the im portance o f the tribe in the narrative w hich follows. T hat is, there are even fe w e r explicit state- m ents about the im portance o f Levi in the genealogies than could be ad d u ced o r inferred for the tribe o f Judah. T he larger concern for the tem ple and its cult in C hronicles brings the significance o f the individu- als m entioned in the Levitical genealogy into clearer focus.It should b e noted, how ever, that the inform ation about Levi consists o f far m o re than a genealogy; the genealogy proper consists o f the nam es in 5 :2 7 -6 :1 5 (6 :1 -3 0 E ng.), the partial repetition in 1 C h r 6 :3 5 -3 8 (vv. 5 0 -5 3 Eng.), and the genealogies provided for the three c h ie f Levitical singers Ilem an, Asaph, an d Ethan in vv. 3 -1 7 (vv. 18-32 Eng.). T he rem aining section (vv. 39 66 [vv. 54 81 Eng.]) is a description o f the tow ns and pasturelands assigned to the tribe, the so-called Levitical cities, intim ately connected w ith the sim ilar distribution list in Josh 2 1 :4 -4 0 , though in a com plicated an d debated m anner.90.

A re these cities w h ic h the L evites are expected to have in the future? S hould they attem pt to replicate the geographic “ reality\" presented by this list? I f the an sw er to these questions is “yes,\" then should not the sam e response be given to the geographical notations included for the other tribes in the genealogies?

I f those tribes w ho returned from exile w ere the only recipients o f the geographical m arkers, then such an explanation w ould m ore likely suggest that C hronicles advocates a return to so m e ideal borders (from the G olden A ge o f D avid and S olom on, for exam ple). H ow ever, this is not the case.First, only five tribes are listed as returning (in 1 C h r 9 :3 -3 4 ): Judah, B enjam in, E phraim , M an asseh , and Levi. O f course, M an asseh has no specific geographical associations other than dw elling in the region “ from B ashan to B aal-hcrm on, Scnir, and M ount H erm o n \" ( 1 C h r 5:23). In addition, in 1 C h r 4:41 S im eo n ’s inform ation com es from the tim e o f H ezekiah (not D avid 01 ־S olom on); the tribes o f G ad and R euben are still in an A ssyrian exile along w ith M anasseh in 1 C h r 5 :2 5 -2 6 , and their genealogical inform ation dates to the tim e o f Jotham (v. 17). T hus, no o n e tim e is depicted by the geographical data in the genealogies, and the assum ption that such a list functions as a call to replicate its contents does n o t fit the evidence contained in C hronicles itself. Finally, as all tw elve tribes d o not provide land for the Levites Dan is m issing the use o f the term “ ideal” o r an association w ith the inclusive “ all Israel\" ideology is difficult to m aintain.

S o m e scholars h ave suggested that the inclusion o f the descendants o f S eir an d the E dom ite kings m ay reflect the continuing significance o f these g ro u p s (or the people n o w living in their territory) for the C hronicler’s o w n tim e. W hile such a direct relationship is possi- ble, the stereotypical use o f these particular nations in C hronicles would seem to indicate that they function as ciphers fo r w h o ev er is o p p o sed to Israel rather than an y particular group actually residing to the southeast o f Y ehud at the tim e o f the C hronicler. It is the significance o f these two groups in Israel's past (note their additional appearances in 1 C h r 4:42; 1 8 :1 1 -1 3 :2 C h r 8:17; 20:2, 1 0 .2 2 -2 3 ; 2 1 :8 -1 0 ; 2 5 :11-20; 28:17; alm ost all in so m e type o f conflict o r m ilitary context) that sufficiently explains their inclusion here.From this open in g chapter detailing the larger hu m an fam ily, the C hronicler proceeds to discuss the lineage o f Israel exclusively in chs.2 9. A s noted previously, w ith in ch. 1 the order o f presentation follows a clear pattern: the subsidiary lines are listed first follow ed by the line o f greater significance. T hus, Japheth and H am precede Shem , Ishmael precedes Isaac, and Esau precedes Israel. T h e genealogical tree is pro- gressively narrow ed until the m a in object o f attention com es into focus: the sons o f Israel (1 C h r 2 :1 -2 ). This literary device an d the em phasis on the ligure o f Jacob as the first Israelite in C hronicles (as opposed to A b rah am o r Isaac) h ave b een noted b y scholars repeatedly. W hat has not b een m uch d iscu ssed by scholars is the failure o f the C hronicler to co m m e n t explicitly upon the reason for this apparent selection o f Israel as a chosen entity, especially given his inclusion o f narrative com m ents concerning individuals w ithin the opening genealogy an d in the gcncalo- gics o f the tribes w hich follow.98 Is the sp e c ia l sta tu s o f Israel assum ed.97. Another explanation for their similarity could be their derivation from the sam e or nearly the same time period, and thus a reflection o f the sam e historical situation. If P. however, predates Chronicles by a century or two (dating P closer to the exile and Chroniclcs eloser to the Hellenistic period), then their historical contexts would be very different. Further, the origin o f the Table o f Nations in Gen10 is not clear; it could derive from P. w hile many hold that it is from J or an inde- pendent source which predates P. W hatever the true chronological sequence o f these texts, the failure o f the Chronicler to alter significantly his source material in this case (as he does regularly with other source information) is worthy o f further con- sidération.98. This silence about Israel's “election\" is all the more remarkable given the repeated references to and reasons for the choscnness o f David and Solom on and the city o f Jerusalem in Chronicles (1 Chr 28:4-6, 10; 2 Chr 6:5-6, 34, 38; 7:12-18; 12:13; 33:7)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"712.

It is in this light that the C hronicler’s concern over the identity o f “ Israel” touches upon the issues o f “ inclusion/universalism ” an d “exclusion/particularism ” as so labeled by a long history o f scholarship on this com plex an d controversial motif.D iscussions o f this issue in C hronicles often begin by addressing the presentation o f sim ilar concerns in E zra-N eh em iah .

The use o f the root \"unfaithful·‘ (מ על ) is the strongest evidence for this being the Chronicler's own com position, as it is a repeated theme throughout Chronicles and appears often at points in the Chronicler's S o n d e r g u t as the commentary to the events recorded (see, e.g., 1 Chr 2:7; 5:25; 9:1; 10:13; 2 Chr 12:2; 26:16, 18; 28:19, 22; 29:6, 19; 30:7; 33:19, 36:14).

This administrative system established by David is apparently maintained by Solom on in Chroniclcs. Contrast the account o f Solom on's famous reorganization of the land into tw elve districts in 1 Kgs 4:7-19.13. Ralph W. Klein contends that this action by David is to “serve as a model for the post-exilic com m unity o f the Chronicler's day״ (\"The Last W ords o f David,״ C u r T M31 [2004]: 15-2 3 [20, 22, 23]); cf.

At this point in the narrative, the C hronicler transposes the final paragraph from 1 Kgs 10:26-29, w hich im m ediately precedes the recounting o f S o lo m o n 's unfaithfulness and ultim ate decline in 1 K gs 11.

W hile many have seen this as problematic for the depiction o f Solom on as the ideal ruler o f peace, it serves a vital function in the utopian geography o f the Chronicler: Solom on’s empire w as not exactly the same dim ensions as David’s— Solom on's was larger. This sm all detail thus serves to enhance the statement regarding the utopian extent o f Solom on's kingdom in 2 Chr 10:26 (see further below).18. The contrast between Kings and Chronicles concerning the beginning o f Solom on's reign could not be clearer. In addition to the intrigues o f I Kgs 1:5-2:46, Solom on marries Pharaoh’s daughter in a political alliance (3:1 ), and only then goes to Gibeon to sacrifice, apparently by him self (3:3-15). In Chronicles, the first action o f Solom on is to assem ble the leadership to go with him to sacrifice at the tabernacle at Gibeon (the specific notice about the tabernacle being unique to Chronicles). After both Solom on and the assem bly inquired ( i l ) at the bronze altar (both details not in 1 Kings), God appeared to Solom on at night (without specifying “in a dream,\" in contrast to 1 Kgs 3:5).The assim ilation o f the tabernacle tradition and the explicit notice about seek- ing God serve utopian functions in this narrative to bolster Solom on's status. The direct com m unication between G od and Solom on is unparalleled by any other monarch. Solom on is the only monarch not to require the agency o f a prophet to hear G od's word— even his father David requires a prophet ( I Chr 17:1-15); see the further com m ents on this final point by John W.

K ings fails to note the origin o f this altar ( 1 K gs 8:64). C hronicles, how ever, provides an explanatory note an d clarifies its recen t construction (2 C h r 4:1 ; 7:7). T h e concern for cultic detail is also reflected in the unparalleled descrip- tion o f the liturgical singers and m usic w hich im m ediately precedes the filling o f the tem ple w ith the glory o f YHWH (2 C h r 5:11-13).In contrast to this concern for detail, the am biguity in C hroniclcs con- cerning the length o f tim e required for the building o f the tem ple stands in m arked contrast to the explicit statem ents in 1 K ings.31 A lthough both texts agree that S olom on took tw enty years to build both the tem ple and his palace (1 K gs 9 : 10//2 C h r 8:1 ), the respective am ounts o f seven and thirteen years ap p ear only in 1 K gs 6 :3 7 -7 :1 .

H ow - ever, it is also possible that the am biguity in C hronicles is m eant to im ply that the dedication took place closer to the end o f the tw enty-year construction period rather than after only the first seven.

M anassch's reign alone m oves from unfaithfulness, to repentance, and finally to reform. Kings who begin in faithfulness and then sin without repentance include: Asa. Joash, Am aziah, Uzziah, and Josiah. Kings w ho are com pletely faithful: Solom on. Abijah. and Jotham. Kings com pletely unfaithful: Jehoram, Ahaziah, (Athaliah), Ahaz, Anion, Jehoiakim, Jehoi- achin, and Zcdckiah. O nly Jehoahaz receives no such explicit evaluation o f his reign.45.

The Chronicler's anthropology is much more sophisticated: actions alone— even cultic reforms— do not account for one's fidelity, but intentions are also important, and humans can be inconsistent in their orientation towards good and evil; cf. the sim ilar remarks about the Chronicler's anthropology as related to A sa by Japhet. / ά I I C h r o n ic le s, 741.

Even the monarch's name is different: Abijam in 1 Kgs 15:1 -8 . It is certainly possible that the Chronicler preserves an alternative historical account o f Abijah, as is advocated by several scholars; see David G.

Rather, the “g o o d \" conditions o f the present are used by A bijah to create a better future on the basis o f his confidence in YHWH an d the efficacy o f the Jerusalem cult. This thoroughly positive assessm ent o f A bijah by the C hronicler— only S olom on and Jo th am receive the sam e evaluation — can do nothing b u t present his three-year reign as an exem plar o f a utopian ruler to be em ulated.3.1.3.

Finally, his elaborate burial concludes the C h ro n ic le r's account (v. 14).Thus, in these differences, A sa is presented as a righteous king w ho experiences a loss o f fidelity in his final years, ending his reign w ithout repentance o r reform . T h e faithfulness o f A sa resulting in his over- w h elm in g victory o v e r the ridiculously large C ushite arm y is directly contrasted w ith his unfaithfulness in seeking the m ilitary assistance o f foreigners.

T he sim ilarities and contrasts betw een the tw o rulers are thus further heightened.Jehoshaphat is the first m o n arch in C hronicles to deal explicitly w ith Baalism an d to b e described in contrast to the N orthern K ingdom (vv. 3 4). T hese details, unique to C hronicles, stand in ju x tap o sitio n to the actions o f Jehoshaphat that directly result in his c o n d em n ed m ilitary expedition w ith A hab o f Israel recorded in 2 C h r 18:1-2.

H ow ever, both K ings and C hronicles note that G od d id not destroy Jehoram because o f the covenant m ad e w ith D avid (2 Kgs 8:19//2 C h r 21:7).

W ith his cultic unfaithfulness in erecting high places, Jehoram receives special c ondem nation in the form o f a letter sent from E lijah the prophet (vv. 11-15). M uch attention has been given to tw o aspects o f this account: (1) the difficulty o f this action being taken by E lijah during J eh o ra m ’s lifetim e on the basis o f the chronology in Kings; and (2) this singular use o f a prophetic w riting as a m ethod o f proclam ation in Chronicles. In E lijah's letter, Y HWI1 contrasts Jeh o ram 's w ays w ith those o f A sa an d Jehoshaphat and charges Jehoram w ith cultic im propriety and the m urder o f his brothers. T hus, e ven though both A sa an d Jehoshaphat en d their reigns w ith periods o f unfaithfulness, the reign o f Jehoram is thoroughly unfaithful; the positive aspects o f their reigns stand out in com parison. YHWH further predicts a plague on his household an d a terrible disease that will befall him personally. In fulfilling the first part, Yhwh incites against Jeh o ram the Philistines and A rabs.

Up to this point, the C hronicler notes the unfaithfulness o f the kings an d criticizes it, b u t docs n o t express his disgust as pointedly as w ith Jehoram . He serves a dystopian function: this is the w o rse alter- n a tiv e reality. If this is the m odel, destruction is assured. F o r the Chroni- cler, the dystopian elem ents include: ( 1 ) the m isuse o f prim ogeniture; (2) invalid cultic w o rsh ip , particularly on the high places; (3) m arriage alliances that result in unfaithfulness; (4) exclusively negative judgm ent by the p rophet w ithout hope o r a call to repentance;61 an d (5) the threat to the dynasty cau sed by all o f this.62 W hile the view taken here is that the C hroniclcr docs not advocate the restoration o f the dynasty, this addi- tional dystopian feature m ay possibly be the C hronicler's attem pt to show the futility o f attem pting to re-establish it in the m idst o f threats from the o th er dystopian practices. If indeed the C hronicler w ere com posing this narrative to expose som e o f the negative repercussions o f his present society, such elaboration on these particular points w ould also serve to en h an ce the overall schem es o f the C hronicler’s utopian ideology in form ulating the better a ltern a tive re a lity for his present and future.In reporting the one-year reign o f A haziah, son o f Jehoram , Chronicles closely parallels the account o f this m onarch from 2 Kgs 8 :2 6 -2 9 in 2 C h r 2 2 :1 -6 , w hich em phasizes his association w ith the house o f A hab an d their corrupt practices. In contrast. C hronicles sum m arizes rather succinctly the narrative recorded in 2 Kgs 9 :1 -2 8 in 2 C h r 2 2 :7 -9 . O ne significant difference in the C hronicler's abbreviated account is the loca- tion o f A haziah w hen he is caught and m urdered by Jehu son o f Nim shi. In 2 K gs 9, A haziah is in Jezreel (v. 17), shot w hile fleeing, and dies at M cgiddo (v. 27). C hronicles locates A haziah entirely in Sam aria (2 C hr 2 2 :7 -9 a ), the capital o f the N orth, and o f particular significance during the C hronicler’s o w n tim e. In addition, he receives a burial because o f his descent from Jehoshaphat acco rd in g to v. 9b, although the location is61. This is unique in Chronicles. All other prophétie judgments in Chroniclcs provide some other form o f hope or a call to repentance. The Chronicler may be expressing his view that, while rare, such a completely negative prophecy is possible, and should be avoided by his audience; cf. his negative assessment of the end of the kingdom in 2 Chr 36:15-16, which clearly serves as a commentary for the readers.62. Japhet notes that while Athaliah attempts the eradication of the dynasty in 2 Chr 22:10 (//2 Kgs 11:1), Chroniclcs alone assigns “dynastic endangerment\" to Jehoram on two different occasions (/ <& II Chronicles, 807); cf.

Further, w hile K ings details the restoration o f Joash to the throne, the rest o f his reign and those o f his tw o successors are only briefly recounted in com parison to the coverage o f the N orthern K ingdom during this sam e period (2 Kgs 11:4-15:31 ). W h ile including the infor- m ation found in Kings, C hroniclcs contains significantly longer accounts for each o f these three m onarchs. T his additional inform ation serves to clarify their reigns, providing details to p assing rem ark s in Kings, and to em phasize the utopian presentation o f the m o n arch y in C hronicles.66Joash, hidden as a n infant in the tem p le for six years, receives his kingship from Jeh o ia d a the priest in a c o u p d 'e ta t. In his coronation cerem o n y , Joash is crow ned, given the treaty (“ה ע ד לי ( proclaim ed as king, and anointed by the priest an d his sons (2 C h r 23:1 l).67 Jehoiada d e a r ly sees his actions as consistent w ith the prom ises m ade to D avid by Y h w h (v. 3). A fter the m u rd e r o f A thaliah, Jehoiada m ade a covenant betw een him self, the people, and the king. T he people destroy the foreign cult o f Baal. W h ile these points are found in Kings, the notice that Jehoiada restored the Lcvitical service w ith its liturgical m usic according to D a v id 's order (' ־ י ד ו ' ־ ע ל) and the w ritten T orah o f M oses is unique to C hronicles (v. 18).H ow ever, it seem s that C hronicles does n o t suggest that these actions taken by the leading p riest are paradigm atic for his ow n time. Rather, the exceptional conditions o f the coup and Jo a s h 's age. seven years (2 C hr 24:1 ), provide the explanation for Jeh o iad a’s increased political and cul- tic authority.

T hus, the C hronicler does not use66. These three monarchs are further connected by an em phasis on the condi- tion o f the heart, and cspccially the danger o f pride; see 2 Chr 24:4; 25:19; 26:16, and cf. the remark about pride as “a basic cause o f sin\" in Chronicles by M cKenzie, 1 -2 C h ro n ic le s, 57.67.

W hile the (high) priesthood has assum ed political authority in the past (as stated in 2 K gs 11 and repeated in C hronicles), such a condition w as only tem po- rary and did not continue beyond this highly exceptional case. Indeed, it rather establishes “royal responsibility for the restoration o f the T e m p le .\"70 In the political utopia o f the C hronicler, this point is highly significant.

Yet, this utopia u n d er Jotham is short-lived, as his son A h az institutes w h a t is the clearest picture o f a dystopia in Chronicles.W'hereas M anasseh is the epitom e o f evil in K ings, A h az serves the sim ilar (though not exact) role in C hronicles. Like his predecessors Jehoram . A haziah, an d A thaliah, the reign o f A haz is thoroughly nega- tive, and is m ostly concerned w ith cultic m isconduct. H ow ever, A h a z ’s actions exceed everything that has co m e before. C hronicles depicts A haz as the first king to practice ch ild sacrifice (2 C h r 2 8 :1 -4 ). B ecause o f his cultic practices— im plicit in K ings but explicit in C hronicles— A haz is attacked by A ram and Israel. W hile 2 K gs 16:5 clearly states that Ahaz could not be conquered, C hronicles presents Judah being devastated at the hands o f these nations (2 C h r 2 8 :5 -8 ). W hatev er the historical real- ity b eh in d these texts, the prophetic oracle o f O ded provides the key to understanding the C h ro n icler's version o f events (vv. 9 -1 5 ). This prophet addresses the arm y o f the N orthern K ingdom , telling them to send the Judahite captives back. H is w ords are reinforced by certain Ephraim ites. A fter a rem arkable exhibition o f co m p assio n an d hum ani- tarianism , the captives are returned to the city o f Jericho (v. 15). W hile Japhet rightly em phasizes the significance o f claim s to “the brotherhood o f Judah and Israel\" an d the te x t’s function a s a “m odel o f m oral integ- rity,\"76 there is m o re to consider.T h e people o f the N orth are obedient to the prophet and take appropri- ate, even unrequired, action in response. Ahaz, how ever, will continue his cultic m isconduct an d bring further disaster upon Judah (vv. 19, 23, 25). H is appeal for assistance against the Edom ites and Philistines results in his subjugation to A ssyria instead o f deliverance for Judah despite plundering the royal and tem ple treasuries (vv. 16-21).

H ezekiah, M anasseh, Am on, a n d J o sia h (2 C hronicles 2 9 -3 5 ) T h e C hronicler’s con cern for the cult is clearly evident in the am ount o f space dedicated to this institution in the reigns o f these four kings. In addition, the utopian ideology o f the C hronicler is perhaps best under- stood in the context o f these four rulers. It is in their reigns that m a n y o f the theological them es culm inate, that the distinction b etw een ideal and utopian is readily apparent, that hope for the future is held out repeatedly to those still in exile, and that the p ro p er relationship betw een the com- m unity and the foreign em pire is articulated. T hese issues will again be restated at the bo o k ’s conclusion (2 C h r 3 6 :1 5 -2 3 ), but their appearance in these chapters further em phasizes their im portance in the C hronicler’s utopian ideology an d overall argum ent throughout the book.H ezekiah converts the dystopia under A haz into a utopia by instituting num erous reform s.78 At the very beginning o f his reign (in his first m onth as ruler) according to 2 C h r 29:3. H ezekiah opens the tem ple again and begins the p rocess o f sanctification for the tem ple an d the restoration o f its cult (vv. 4 36). Several key points arc m ad e in this section: the death and captivity o f the Israelites is a direct result o f th eir cultic m isconduct (v. 9); a covenant will be m ad e b etw een the people and Yhw h (v. 10); the various types o f offerings are perform ed at the k in g 's co m m and (vv. 20 24); the Lcvitical m usic and priestly trum peters arc re-established according to the prophetic D avidic organization (vv. 2 5 -3 0 ); and the tem ple cult is restored (v. 35). H e ze k ia h ’s heart for G od (v. 10) is77. Compare the language about serving other nations in 2 Chr 12:8: and the discussion in Section 3.2.78. M ost o f the actions taken by 1 lezekiah in chs. 3 0 -3 1 lack parallels in Kings. The Sennachcrib invasion and Babylonian envoys arc the key events o f H czckiah's reign in Kings w hile the version presented in Chronicles gives priority to the earlier unparalleled cultic reforms.

W hile the priests are criticized (v. 34; 2 C h r 30:3), H ezekiah an d the assem bly (ק ה ל ) together decide to celebrate the P assover w ith an invitation extended to the N orth to jo in th em (2 C h r 30:2 4).In this w ritten invitation, those Israelites not exiled by A ssyria, but w h o rem ained in the land, are encouraged to return to Y h w h , w ho is “gracious and m erciful” an d w ho will b rin g the A ssyrian captives back to the land in response to their actions (vv. 6 -9 ). T his b rie f passage is h ig h ly significant fo r the utopian ideology o f C hronicles. First, it recog- nizcs that not all N ortherners w ere exiled {contra 2 K gs 17:6, 18 24). Second, this rem nant in the N orth is still regarded a s authentically a part o f Israel. Third, the possibility o f a return 01' the A ssyrian exiles is held out as a certainty i f they repent an d return to Y h w h . 0 1 'course, the final point is also applicable to those exiled b y Babylon w h o continue to reside outside the land o f Israel. I f the c o m m u n ity in Y e h u d repents, will G o d restore these tribes also? T he im plication o f v. 9 is an em phatic “ Y es!”T h e responses by the N ortherners and the Judahites also serve utopian functions. First, in response to H e ze k ia h 's letter, only a few N ortherners co m e to Jerusalem in repentance w hile m ost reject his invitation with laughter an d m ockery (vv. 10-11). T his response ca n n o t be labeled “ ideal,\" but “ utopian\" docs seem appropriate. If the C h ro n icler's purpose w as to describe an “ ideal” past on w hich to base present and future action, then the num ber o f individuals responding w ith repentance m ay be expected to be larger than the m e ag e r few w ho do so. Second, the people o f Judah are supportive o f these atypical events because G od had given them “o n e heart\" to be obedient to their leadership and the com- m and o f G o d (א ה ד ל ב; v. 12). T hese tw o responses have direct implica- tions for the C hronicler’s o w n day. T h e N ortherners are still invited (or should be) and they are to be received openly and w ithout dissent in w h a tev er num ber they should choose to d o so.In addition, the depiction o f H ezekiah as a S econd D avid-Solom on ruling over a unified Israel including resident aliens (ג ר י ם ) is explicitly em phasized at the c o nclusion o f the P assover célébration (2 C h r 30:25 27). H ezekiah, the first king o f Judah to reign after the deportation o f the N orth to A ssyria, has the opportunity to re-unite all o f the people o f Israel in the w orship o f Yh w h. T his unique role o f H ezekiah is form ulated in a variety o f ways. First, although he exercises religious authority over so m e parts o f E p h raim and M anasseh (2 C h r 31:1), H ezekiah does not attem pt m ilitary expansion into the form er N orthern K ingdom . It is not the concern o f the C hronicler to depict righteous kings as restoring, or"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Ill3. A P olitical Utopiaattem pting to restore, the geographic boundaries o f the D av id ic-S o lo - m onic em pire. Instead, the restoration o f the cult is the prim ary concern for H ezekiah, including the destruction by the people o f all cultic sites o th er than the Jerusalem tem ple (31:1). Further, in the reign o f Hezekiah, the security o f Israel is entirely dependent on G od an d his faithfulness to deliver the people (2 C hr 32:8). H ezekiah prepares an d builds defenses for the people, but he does n o t attack his en em y an d he docs not depend on m ilitary strategy to gain victory. In his defensive posture, he is delivered from the im pending threat only after he and the prophet Isaiah had prayed to G od (2 C h r 32:20). A s a result, he receives \"rest on every side” and an influx o f gifts in line w ith the Solom onic precedent (2 C hr 3 2 :2 2 -2 3 ).79Second, he m odels his reform ation o f the cult on the D avidic Solo- m onic organization. H o w ev er, even in this, he does n o t sim ply replicate the earlier regulations. Rather, H ezekiah orders store-cham bers to be built to hold the collected tithes for the clergy (2 C h r 31:2-11).*° Then, along w ith A zariah, the c h ie f officer o f the house o f G od, he appoints Levites to oversee their collection, storage, and distribution (vv. 12-15). W hile this p assage has som e parallels to D a v id ’s appointm ent 01' the priests w ith the assistance o f both Z adok and A him elech (1 C h r 24:3), the differences b etw een the accounts arc striking. It is clear that Azariah is a leading cultic official, but m a y not be the “ leading priest,” so that the parallel to the tw o priests at the tim e o f D avid is inexact. A lso, the appointm ents are for priestly divisions at the tim e o f D avid and for Levites overseeing the storage locations at the tim e o f Hezekiah.T hird, the C hronicler’s evaluation o f his reign is expressed as the zenith o f m onarchic faithfulness in the post-Solom onic era. In the initial su m m ary o f his reign, H ezekiah is “good, right, and faithful\" before Yhw h, his reform s w ere also in accordance w ith the T orah an d the com m andm ent, and he sought G o d w ith all o f his heart, all o f w hich thus led to his prosperity (2 C hr 31:20-21 ).

A P olitical UtopiaM any scholars have suggested that M anasseh is a model o f repentance for the exilic/postexilic c om m unity an d that his lengthy reign o f fifty- five years in 2 K gs 21:1 is the textual reason for the necessity o f his repentance in C hronicles. H ow ever, w hile both o f these contentions are possible, the C hronicler’s utopian ideology better explains the unique presentation o f M anasseh in C hronicles. R egardless o f the historicity o f this narrative, M anasseh dem onstrates the efficacy o f rcpentancc in his restoration to the land an d to his kingdom ('.2 : בי ל כי רC h r 33:12-13). T he C h ro n icle r's present w as no different: i f the D avidic m onarchy w ished to be restored again to its place, its leader(s) m ust repent an d aw ait G o d 's hand in restoring the throne. It is w orth noting that M anasseh does not revolt against the foreign p ow er o f A ssyria to regain his k ingdom ; the im petus for his restoration to the throne com cs solely from G o d in response to M an a sse h 's ch an g e o f heart. W hile this point could be used to argue that the C hronicler advocated the restoration o f the Davidic m onarchy, it instead places the responsibility on the leadership to repent an d on G o d to do the restoring— i f that is G o d ’s intention. T hus, the C hronicler certainly does not use the exam ple o f M anasseh to illustrate the violent o v erth ro w o f the foreign p ow er in an attem pt to restore the D avidic m onarchy— even if there has been the necessary prerequisite o f repentance. A lso, the restoration com m unity may have seen m uch o f their present situation in the description o f M anasseh, especially in the lim itation o f reform s to the im m ediate sphere o f influence in the defen- sive strategy throughout the cities o f Judah and to the cult only within Jerusalem . T hus, M anasseh m ay have served as a utopian depiction o f appropriate steps to b eg in the process o f reform , i f the depictions o f D avid, Solom on, and H ezekiah seem ed unattainable for the present. How ever, the C hronicler clearly conveys to his audience that M anasseh’s utopia is not the final destination, even i f it is technically a b e tte r alter- n a tiv e re a lity than the C h ro n ic ler's present.W hile A m o n 's reign is m erely an extension o f M an asseh 's evil prac- tices in K ings (2 K gs 2 1 :1 9 -2 6 ), his reign serves a different iunction in C hronicles (2 C h r 3 3 :2 1 -2 5 ). In C hronicles, M anasseh ends his reign w ith a period o f partial reform and A m o n returns to M an a sse h 's earlier dystopian practices, thereby setting the stage for the following reform s o f Josiah. T hus, the vague description o f the dystopia under A m on stands o u t in the context o f three reform ing kings in C hroniclcs— Hezekiah, M anasseh, and Josiah. T he C hronicler m akes the explicit point that A m on does not hum ble h im s e lf before G o d (2 C h r 33:23) w hile noting the other three have indeed done so (2 C h r 32:26; 33:12; 3 4 :2 6 -2 7 ).

W hile these other rulers serve as utopian m odels for the C hronicler’s audience, A m o n 's rejection o f their hum ility in repentance is the point o f his b rief dystopian reign in C hronicles.W ith Josiah, the C hronicler presents the final attem pt at utopia under the D avidic m onarchy in his w ork. Josiah is not the exem plary hero in C hronicles that he is in Kings, b u t his reign is utopian nonetheless. The reign o f Josiah exhibits several utopian features: chronology and geogra- phy, cultic organization and reform ation, obedience and disobedience to the prophetic w ord, hum ility and repentance, the accountability o f each generation/individual for their actions, an d relationship to foreign powers. T h e chronology o f C hroniclcs for Jo sia h 's reign provides a different understanding o f Jo sia h 's reform s and a different geography to be associated w ith them. W hereas 2 K gs 22:3 im plies that Josiah began his reform s in the eighteenth y e a r w ith repair to the tem ple, 2 C h r 34:3 states that Josiah began to seek G od in his eighth y e a r and started reform s in his tw elfth year. T hese reform s took place throughout Jerusa- lem, Judah, M anasseh, Ephraim , S im eon, an d N aphtali and purged the land o f its idolatrous religious objects (vv. 3 -7 ). S econd K ings 23:15-20 places Jo sia h 's reform s in the N orth a fte r his discovery o f the B ook o f the T orah and the covenant renew al, but the C h ro n icler's version locates these reform s in the North p r io r to the discovery o f the Book o f the Torah an d the covenant renew׳al. T h e different order o f events in C hronicles allow s for the N ortherners to contribute financially to the tem p le repair project, affirm ing th eir solidarity w ith the inhabitants o f Judah an d Jeru- salem (2 C'hr 3 4 :8 -9 ).sî T h e geography o f Jo siah ’s reform s in Chronicles includes parts o f the N orthern K ingdom and is rem iniscent o f the appeal to the N orth and the actions taken b y the people at the tim e o f Hezekiah (2 C h r 30:1, 10-11; 31:1). H ow ever, the geography is not identical: different tribes are m entioned in each instance.83. It is also significant that in the remainder o f Josiah's reign the distinction between Judah and Israel seem s virtually to disappear as the people again seem to be brought together under Josiah's leadership as a unity. Although Hezekiah is the first to rule over a reunited Israel, the reforms o f M anasseh seem to apply only to Judah. Thus, the people arc reunited under Josiah for a second tim e. This type o f pattern is suggestive again for the Chronicler’s present: the people o f Israel have been sepa- rated and reunited m o r e th a n o n c e in the past, and their current separation should not be viewed as a permanent condition without hope o f change in a utopian future."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"1153.

T hus, the spread o f religious reform is advocated, although it m ust be d one w ithout political, m ilitary expansion.84Jo sia h 's cultic reform s m ay also be com pared to the C h ro n icler's account o f H e ze k ia h 's reform s. W hile they are sim ilar in scope, they are different in detail and in their im plem entation. Just as H ezekiah, Josiah reinstitutes the Lcvitical an d priestly divisions, cclcbratcs Passover, renew s a covenant w ith people, and destroys the idolatrous religious objects.U nlike H ezekiah, Josiah h as the opportunity to respond to prophetic w arnings (2 C h r 34:22 33; 35:21 22). A lso, H ezekiah is threatened by a foreign invasion and m ust d e fe n d Jerusalem , but Jo siah atta cks Pharaoh N eco, w h o has no interest in attacking Jerusalem (2 C h r 35:20-22). W hile the vast m ajority o f scholars have seen the explanation for Jo sia h 's death in C hroniclcs as a “last ditch effort ״o f theodicy to salvage his theory o f retribution, its function in C hronicles is expressly utopian an d is consistent w ith other ideological points advocated by the Chroni- cler. First, this is consistent w ith the repeated assertion in C hronicles that a defensive m ilitary strategy is acceptable w hile offensive excursions should be avoided and m a y have disastrous, o r at least am biguous, outcom es.Second, until the very end o f his reign Josiah had been faithful to YHWH a pproaching the illustrious level o f o b e d ien ce an d utopian description o f the likes o f D avid, S olom on, H ezekiah, and Jotham .

T hus, the circum stances o f Josiah's dem ise present a dystopian view o f this otherw ise entirely utopian ruler in C hronicles. W hile Jo sia h 's cultic reform s an d obedience to T orah are lauded by the C hronicler (2 C h r 34:31; 35:4 6, 12 13,18). his failure to respond to contem porary prophetic w arning— even from an extrem ely atypical source— brings about his o w n death and the beginning o f the d o w n w ard spiral that ends in the cessation o f the m onarchy, the destruc- tion o f the tem ple and Jerusalem , and the exile to Babylon.85. Compare Jeremiah’s prophecies as being “from the mouth o f YHWH” (ΗΓ* 2 ;מ פי Chr 36:12).86. It has been suggested that this claim about the establishm ent o f the temple under Josiah indicates the com pletion o f the m onarchy's usefulness, since its pri- mary function to eare for the temple has been accomplished (Riley. K in g a n d C u lt u s, 138-40. 149, 155-56. 179-80). Therefore, the monarch is no longer necessary for the restoration or operation o f temple worship. However, this reading fails to account for the sim ilar com m ents in H ezekiah's reign and the continuation o f the temple cult until its pollution at the lime o f Zedekiah prior to its destruction. Thus, the argument for a “culm ination” under Josiah would have better support if the cult im m ediately ceased or remained in this correct form until it w as destroyed.

A P olitical UtopiaThe monarchs can be classified into three groups: (1) those buried with their ancestors in the “city o f David” without qualification (Solom on, Rehoboam, Abijah, Jehoshaphat, Am aziah, Jotham, and Josiah);92) )״ those receiving som e type o f additional statement about where they were buried (Asa, Jehoram, Ahaziah, Joash.

The appearance o f both good and bad kings in the second group (especially including Hezekiah here instead o f with Solom on and Josiah in the first group), the am biguity surrounding M anasseh’s unique burial, and the m issing notices for David and Am on all work against a sim ple pattern o f “good king = good burial\" in Chronicles. Thus, the Chronicler does not use this information to reinforce the evaluative judgm ent on a specific monarch. In fact, if anything, the Chronicler's burial notices com plicate the assessm ent o f a monarch's reign.1\"״ The Chronicler d o e s n o t have a sim plistic understanding o f the monarchy conveyed through a dichotom y o f righteousness and unrighteousness. Instead, the individual monarchs rcficct the nature o f reality from the Chronicler's perspective: life and people are highly com plex, and they cannot be reduced to sim plistic cate- gorization.In his spatial theory, Lefebvre notes that one o f the exam ples o f \"priestly” control o f the spatial matrix o f a society is the establishm ent o f proper location and differ- entiation via burial practice.101 Even in death, the leadership o f a community may be distinguished from the rest o f society. And even within the burials o f the leadership, a value judgm ent on these individuals m ay be indicated by the elaborateness or physical location o f one's grave in comparison with another.102 Thus, the ruling class or individuals may reinforce its position o f power by appealing to burial practices of the com m unity as evidence o f their authority, honor, and mandate to rule.Although the use o f burial notices for hegem onic purposes in Chronicles has been asserted, the evidence taken holistically indicates otherwise. Indeed, the burial notices in Chronicles are utopian spaces w hich critique claim s to power that are based on the location o f an individual or fam ilial ancestry.99. Although the Chronicler has additional material regarding the laments made for Josiah and their continued use in the tradition, the details o f the burial notice itself are identical to those for the other kings listed in this group.100.

W hile ancestry is obviously important in Chronicles— the extensive genealogies in 1 Chr I 9 arc proof enough o f this103 the hierarchy of authority in the Second Tem ple period is not reflected by burial practices from the First Tem ple period, at least according to its presentation in Chroniclcs.In addition, Jehoiada's inclusion in the tom bs o f the kings is especially provoca- tivc as part o f the Chronicler’s construction o f utopian space. This information about Jehoiada is unique to Chronicles and is also the o n ly reference to a n y priest being buried am ong royalty. One c o u ld conclude from this that Chroniclcs creates the possibility o f priestly or high-priestly claim s o f power based 011 burial practices. If (high) priests can be buried among Davidic royalty, then docs this not indicate a transfer o f power from the Davidic line to the “Zadokite\" high-priestly office? As part o f the refutation o f such a position, it should be noted that in Chronicles Jehoiada is not explicitly a Zadokite, he is not a h ig h priest, and he is the o n ly priest to have such an honor.104 Again, no pattern is established in Chroniclcs indicating that all priests, all high priests, or all Zadokites receive such a distinguished burial. Jehoiada's burial notice is d e a r l y an anom aly and further contributes to the creation o f a “non-pattern\" in Chronicles. Thus, Jehoiada's “royal burial\" should not be inter- preted as an indication o f Zadokite supremacy in the Second Temple period.Indeed, such details may also serve as a critique o f those claim ing (whether indi- viduals contemporary with the Chronicler or modern scholars) that such burial prac- tices indicate righteousness before God, and therefore the location o f true authority in the com m unity. Chroniclcs may even turn such priestly claim s 011 their head by creating Jehoiada's burial in the narrative and then “neutralizing” it with the incon- sistcnt burial notices o f the Davidic kings. Such burial places existed, or at least were claim ed to exist, in the reality o f the Second Tem ple period.ι׳ς The Chronicler redefines their (non)-significancc.To use the term inology o f spatial theory, the Firstspace (actual physical space and its immediate social associations) o f these sites had a definite function in Thirdspace103. I low ever, even the Chronicler’s genealogies are utopian in nature by pro- viding a critique o f the s ta tu s q u o rather than sim ply reinforcing those in positions of power.104. See m y article, “High Priest in Chronicles,\" for further discussion on these points.105.

A P olitical Utopia(practices lived out in real space); this analysis suggests that these burial spaces have been infused with a new understanding by the Chronicler from Secondspace (im posed ideology on space)— they are utopian spaces, no longer spaces o f power and control, but spaces emptied o f w hatever associations may have been attached to them. In Chronicles, burial space in the Second Tem ple period is now a space o f contention, and not political or religious oppression. These burial notices thus rein- force the utopian ideology o f Chronicles by constructing a b e lte r a lte r n a tiv e re a lity in w hich burial spacc and practice do n o t indicate social status in the community.3.2.

Λ S yn th etic R ea d in g o f the M on- a rc h v in C hroniclesSince the concept o f an alternative reality is a k ey co m ponent o f utopian literature, it is a possibility that the C hronicler advocates a restoration o f the D avidic d ynasty in contrast to its absence in his present. Such a position finds support from those scholars w h o adopt an eschatological, m essianic, o r royalist understanding o f C hronicles. H ow ever, there is another possible utopian reading o f the D avidic d ynasty in Chronicles. T h e utopian future in C hroniclcs is a cultic society that docs not req u ire an y specific political system or a D avidide in particular to bring it into existence. T he key w o rd in the previous sentence is “require.” T h e b rief assessm ent in this section contends that a better understanding o f the C h ro n ic le r's utopian ideology for the future is to allow׳ that the Davidic d ynasty m a y be part o f the future o f Israel, but that its restoration is not n ec essa ry for achieving uto p ia as it is constructed in C hronicles.A s explained in C h ap ter 1, o n e o f the co m m o n m isconceptions about utopian literature is that it portrays an unchanging society based on a blueprint o f exact details w hich are necessary for its existence. However, this understanding o f uto p ia has been rejected. Rather, utopias sketch out a b ette r a ltern a tive rea lity that m ay adapt as historical circum stances change.

It is w ith in such a fram ew ork that the D avidic m o n arch y in C hronicles can be assessed m ore coherently.First, it is clear that the c h ie f p urpose o f the dynasty is responsibility for the cult. T h e C h ro n icle r's version o f the “ dynastic prom ise” em pha- sizes that Solom on is chosen as D av id 's successor for the explicit purpose o f building the tem ple (1 C h r 17:10b-15; cf. 1 C h r 2 2 :9 -1 0 ; 2 8 :2 -7 ;2 C h r 7 :1 7 -1 8 ). T hus, all o f his descendants w ho properly adm inister an d support the tem ple are portrayed in utopian term s even to the point o f subtly critiquing righteous kings w h o fail to institute additional reform s after periods o f sin and repentance. In addition, at the conclusion o f the w ork, the fo cu s is clearly on the tem ple and cult w hile the m onarchy sim ply disappears from the scene (2 C h r 3 6 :1 4 -2 3 ). Finally, in this pas- sage, the people arc to return to restore the tem ple under the auspices o f the Persian kings. T he m onarchy, o r even a D avidic descendant, is absent (cf. 2 K gs 2 5 :2 7 -2 9 ).Second, the foreign rulers and the P ersian kings in particular are pre- scntcd as fulfilling the duties o f the D avidic d ynasty in attending to the cult. N eco speaks the w o rd s o f G od (2 C h r 3 5 :2 1 -2 2 ), an d C yrus acts to fulfill th em (3 6 :2 2 -2 3 ). Specifically, C yrus is used by G od to restore his people to the land an d to rebuild the tem ple. T he repeated concerns for the restoration o f the tribes in exile and for the m aintenance o f the tem ple in C hronicles have been noted previously. T here is no such explicit con cern for the restoration o f the dynasty in Chronicles.T his is n o t to say that the C hronicler disallow s the p o s sib ility o f a future restoration o f the m onarchy. T he “covenant o f salt” m ade w ith D avid (2 C h r 13:5) suggests a possible future for the dynasty, as does the recording o f the Solom onic genealogy well into the postexilic period ( 1 C h r 3 :1 0 -2 4 ). H ow ever, these texts hold o u t the p o ssib ility o f resto- ration and not its necessity. T h e C hronicler is som ew hat vague about this issue: he does not explicitly advocate the restoration o f the dynasty and neither does he explicitly d o o m the d ynasty to oblivion. H e is clear that militar־ revolt against the foreign p ow er o r the forcible appointm ent o f a D avidic king in the present is n o t the proper course o f action. Just as C hronicles holds o u t the possibility that the rem aining tribes will be restored i f G o d so a cts in history·, the C hronicler preserves the op tio n for a restoration o f the d y n a sty by G o d 's agency. 106Y et, the C hronicler does106.

G o d rules the people. T he C hronicler directly associates the throne o f the king with the throne o f G o d ( 1 C h r 28:5; 29:23; 2 C h r 9:8; 13:8).

T w o passages are significant in this respect:111. The issue o f whether the late Persian period or early Hellenistic era is more probable w ill not be addressed here: cf.

This assum es a Persian date for Chronicles, but is still valid for a Hellenistic date. The process begun under the Persians could continue under these new leaders. The point o f departure for a new future in Chronicles is the exile and the promised restoration, not the subsequent shift in world powers.

A Cultic UtopiaW hile C hroniclcs affirm s the claim s o f the A aronidcs to the priest- hood, it should be noted that C hronicles lacks genealogies for the priests descended from E leazar an d Itham ar. T his is in contrast to the extensive Levitieal genealogies and the genealogies o f the leading priests. The m em bers o f the priesthood are divided into tw enty-four divisions based on their ancestral houses, but lineages that connect these houses to A a ro n 's sons are n o t included. T his suggests that C hronicles w as not m eant to establish, w ithout subsequent adjustm ents, the param eters for the personnel w ho operate as priests w ithin the tem ple cult. For exam ple, in the settlem ent list o f 1 C h r 9 :3 -3 4 ,־' priests are m entioned am o n g those w h o returned to the land, but only five individuals are specifically nam ed. In contrast, their u n n a m e d “kindred, heads o f their ancestral houses*‘ w h o serve as priests, num ber 1,760 (v. 13).Just as w ith the genealogies o f 1 C h r 1 -9 discussed in C h ap ter 2, the open-ended nature o f these priestly divisions does n o t provide clear criteria by w hich to adjudicate claim s o f descent from the priestly lines.9 T hus, w hile the inform ation about the identity o f the priests in Chroni- cles has been traditionally understood as an affirm ation o f the sta tu s q u o, the C h ro n ic le r's identification o f the priests is better understood as part o f his utopian construct.

She suggests a dev elo p m en t from the list in N eh em iah to the stabilized form recorded in C hronicles.10 T hus, for Japhet, the C hronicler represents the end o f this process rather than being o n e o f the contributors to the on g o in g process o f reorganization in the operation o f the tem ple cult. A s sh e notes, this structural process cannot be reconstructed because o f a “lack o f evidence and docum entation.” 11 T hus, the scholarly a ssu m p tio n is that C hronicles reflects a point o f con- sensus attained p rio r to o r at the tim e o f its com position since, according8. This list is related in som e way to the similar list in Neh 11:3-24. The latter list also includes a large but different number o f unnamed priests without providing genealogies for them. This is another exam ple o f the Chronicler taking his cue from his sources in developing his own utopian text.9. In Fzra 2:59-63//N eh 7:61-65, individuals w ho could not prove their genealogical dcsccnt from priestly lines were excluded from the priesthood. There is no hint o f a concern for maintaining or preserving detailed p r ie s tly genealogies in Chronicles; cf. the remarks in 2 Chr 31:18.10. Japhet, / & 11 C h r o n ic le s, 423-29.11.

T h e m anner o f th eir service as priests is com - m unicated in an equally clear w ay , although the precise procedures involved in the perform ance o f th eir ritual duties arc often vague.In C hronicles, service in the tem ple is the prim ary con cern o f the duties assigned to the priests. T h e first reference to a priest in Chronicles is the b rief chronological note about the service o f A zariah in the tem ple o f Solom on ( 1 C h r 5:36 [6:10 Eng.]).13 In the second instance, Aaron and12. Ithamar is clearly affirmed as a priest and a son o f Aaron in the Pentateuch (Exod 6:23; 2 8 :1 ; Lev 10:12 20; Num 3:2 4:26:60). In these instances he is always m entioned w ith his brother Eleazar. H owever, he is m entioned alone in Exod 38:21; Num 4:28. 33; 7:8. Here, Ithamar serves as the overseer o f the Levites. In Ezra 8:2, among those who return with Ezra from Babylon is a descendent o f an Ithamar— apparently this same one— w ho is m entioned in parallel with Phinehas and David. Thus, in source material that w as likely available to the Chronicler. Ithamar has descendants who returned to the land and he him self w as associated with the proper roles o f the Levites in the cult. Perhaps this situation explains the Chronicler’s al'fin- ity for including Ithamar and his descendants equally am ong the priests ( 1 Chr 5:29 [6:3 Eng.j; 24:1-19), as a legendary champion o f the Levites' involvement in the cult.13.

T h u s, the service o f the priests in the tem ple is associated in the opening genealogical m aterial w ith tw o o f the authoritative figures o f Israel's past, S olom on and M oses, and is w orth special notice in establishing continuity lor the present w ith the past.T hese three texts establish the sphere o f the priests' responsibilities, b u t w ithout providing specific details about their duties. T he first ritual action that is explicitly cited as a priestly duty, apart from serving at the altars in a vague sense, is the preparation o f the m ixed spices for use in the tem ple (I C hr 9:30). This clarification appears in the context o f Levitieal duties for the operation the tem ple cult. Japhct correctly notes that the duties assigned to the L evites here are ascribed to M oses in the Pentateuch w ithout explicitly designating w ho will be responsible for the p rep a ra tio n o f these various item s in the future after M o ses' death, although E lcazar the son o f A aron is ultim ately responsible for their care (N u m 4 :1 6 ).14 B ut, w hy should only the m ixing o f spices be singled out from all o f the other responsibilities? T h e m ix in g o f spices m ay refer to either o n e (or both) o f the only tw o item s to use spices: the anointing oil an d the incense for use o n ly in the cultic rituals (E xod 30:22 3 3 ,3 4 38). O f all the item s m ad e for the T abernacle in the Pentateuch, these are also the only tw o to be explicitly forbidden outside o f the cult.

T his m eager inform ation includes: priests dash the blood o f the Pcsach (2 C h r 30:15 16; 35:11); priests skin the burnt offerings (2 9 :3 4 -3 5 );16 and priests alone h ave access to the innerm ost parts o f the tem ple, and are therefore responsible for its cleansing (2 C h r 5:7; 29:16).In contrast to this depiction o f duties that are exclusive to the priests, on several occasions it is either unclear w h o are the ones perform ing these sacrificial duties o r the D avidic king is explicitly the one m aking the sacrifices (1 C h r 16:1-6; 2 1 :2 6 -3 0 ; 2 C h r 1:6; 7 :4 -5 , 7; 15:9-15; 24:14). Also, it is difficult to accept the conclusion that C hronicles chain- p io n s the right o f the priests to perform the sacrifices exclusively given the num ber o f am biguous o r contradictory references to other individuals functioning as priests.H ow ever, the priests arc not restricted to sacrificial responsibilities in C hronicles. First, the priests arc associated w ith the playing o f trum pets during rituals and cultic celebrations (1 C h r 1 3 :2 ,8 ; 15:24,28; 1 6 :6 ,3 9 - 4 2 ;17 2 C h r 5 :1 1 -1 4 ; 7:6; 13:12, 14; 15:14; 20:28; 2 3 :1 2 -1 3 ;1* 29:26-28). T h e association o f priests w ith trum pets at such tim es is found in the Torah, the bo o k o f Joshua, and in E z ra -N e h em ia h (E xod 19:13, 16, 19; 2 0 :1 8 ;'“ Lev 2 3 :2 3 -2 5 ; 25:9; N um 10:1 - 1 0 ; 29:1 - 6 ; 31:6; Josh 6 :1 -2 1 ; Ezra 3:10; N e h 4:12, 14 [vv. 18, 20 Eng.];20 12:35, 4 1).21 T hus, this16. In contrast, note that the skinning o f the Pcsach is performed by the Levites (2 Chr 3 5 :11), and that the Levites may substitute for the priests in skinning the burnt offerings when there are not enough priests available to perform this duty (2 Chr 29:34-35).17. In 1 Chr 16:39-42. David leaves Zadok and the priests at the tabernacle at Gibeon with attending Levites to perform the cultic offerings. In v. 42, the tw o named Levitical leaders are said to have the trumpets and cym bals for m usic. W hile this could suggest that the Levitical leaders played the trumpets, the presence o f priests at the sam e location may imply that it is the priests who actually play them, which would be consistent with the other references to trumpets in Chronicles.1 S. The revolt against Athaliah is the only instance in Chroniclcs where som eone other than the priests is explicitly blowing trumpets. In this passage, the people o f the land perform this duty. The parallel text o f 2 Kgs 11:13-14 contains this same reading. That this exceptional event occurs during the time o f Jehoiada only adds to the numerous unique practices associated with his tenure as leading priest.19. The references to a trumpet sounding at M ount Sinai do not specify w ho is blowing them. This am biguity may account for the proleptic presence o f priests who are m entioned tw icc in this context before the com m ands to establish the priesthood occur in the subsequent chapters o f Exodus.20. H owever, the identity o f the trumpeter at N chcm iah's side is not made explicit.21. N ote also the use o f trumpets by non-priests, Ehud and Gideon, in Judg 3:26 27; 6:34; 7:8, 16 23.

Two priests a cco m p a n y the five officials an d nine L evites teaching T orah a t the c o m m an d o f Jehoshaphat (2 C h r 17:7-9). Priests praise YHWH and bless the people at cultic celebrations (1 C h r 23:13; 2 C h r 30:21, 27). H ow- ever, w hile this duty is m ore com m only associated w ith the L evites and the D avidic kings, the people them selves and foreign m onarchs also perform this activity (1 C h r 16:2, 4, 7, 9, 36; 23:5; 25:3; 29:10, 13, 20;2 C h r 2:11 [v. 12 Eng.]; 5:13; 6:4; 7:6; 8:14; 9:8; 20:19, 21, 22, 26; 29:30; 3 0 :2 1 ,2 7 ; 31:2, 8).2ב Finally, the spirit o f G od fills Z echariah the so n o f the priest Jehoiada in order to bring a w arn in g to the D avidic king Joash (2 C h r 24:20-22).T h e duties o f the priests in C hronicles are not the focus o f the C h ro n ic le r's cultic system . A s w ith the genealogies o f these priests, the C hronicler provides little inform ation about their functions an d duties. W hat inform ation is contained in C hronicles is largely consistent with the presentation o f the A aronide priesthood in the Torah, and w ith the stipulations o f P in particular. T h e priests are responsible for offering the sacrifices an d for blow ing the trum pets. T hey also appear as teachers and liturgists, though infrequently so. T h e depiction o f the priesthood in C hronicles is thus utopian n o t because it ex p an d s the duties o f the priests. O n the contrary, the cultic utopia o f C hronicles is based on the lim ita tio n o f the priesthood to those areas that are assigned o r m ost directly associated w ith it in the cultic legislation o f the Torah. The priests h ave an im p o rta n t b u t re stric ted sphere o f influence in Chroni- cles. Priests do not oversee L evites and they do not perform duties reserved for the Levites. In contrast, in special circum stances the Levites m ay tem porarily function as i f they w ere priests.

The scope o f individuals performing this \"duty” mitigates against these terms having technical m eanings or only being associated with specific ritual actions. The notion o f “blessing” or \"praising\" cannot be regarded as a strictly ritual formula or procedure in Chronicles, despite its repeated description as a duty o f the Levites."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Reading Utopia in Chronicles1404.1.3.

T h e depictions contain both sim i- larities an d differences to o th er portrayals. For exam ple. Chronicles continues, although to a m u c h lesser extent, the em phasis in P on making atonem ent for the guilt ( ) מ ע לo f the people via sacrifice perform ed by the cultic personnel.21 ־H ow ever, in contrast to P, no distinction is m ad e in C hronicles b etw een intentional an d unintentional sins. C hronicles pre- sents all sin that incurs guilt ( ) פ ע לa s the result o f conscious and inten- tional actions an d flagrant disobedience. In this regard. C hronicles docs not refer to offerings that are designed to atone for unintentional sins.T h e C hronicler does m ention several regular ritual observances known from P: the daily burnt offerings in the m o rn in g an d even in g ,24 the offer- ings o f incense on the altar o f incense, sacrifices for the n e w m oons, and provisions for the w eek ly Sabbaths (1 C h r 6:34 [v. 49 Eng.]; 9:29; 16:37-40; 23:31; 28:18; 2 C h r 1:6; 2:3 [v. 4 Eng.]; 4:6; 8 :1 2 -1 3 ; 9 :3 -4 : 13:11; 24:14; 26:16, 19; 29:7, 18; 3 1 :2 -3 ).

H ow ever, this is not the case. T he C hroniclcr docs explicitly m ention several o f these cultic célébrations from P: daily burnt offerings, new m oons, and the S abbath, the Festival o f P assover (2 C h r 3 0 :1 - 2 7 ; 3 5 :1 - 1 9 ) , the Festival o f U nleavened Bread (2 C h r 8 :1 3 ), the Festival o f W eek s (2 C h r 8 :1 3 ), and the Festival o f Sukkoth (2 C h r 8 :1 3 ). T h e significance o f 2 C h r 8:13 should not be overlooked in this regard.

A lthough the P text o f E x o d 2 3 :1 4 17 intends the sam e three festivals an d utilizes this sam e chronological phrase, the nam es given by P in this instance are not the sam e as in 2 C h r 8:13.

H ow ever, the D text o f Dcut 16:16 contains both the distinctive phrasing for three annual celebrations and the sam e nam es for these festivals as appear in 2 C h r 8:13. T hus, in describing the only required annual festivals, C hronicles is m o re con- sistcnt w ith the language o f D than o f P. B ut this is not all. S olom on is the only king to celebrate all three o f these festivals in C hronicles (2 C hr 5:3; 8:13).26 W hile H ezekiah an d Josiah both celebrate the festival o f U nleavened B read (2 C h r 30:13, 2 1 ; 35:17), only S olom on observes the Festivals o f W e e k s an d Sukkoth. T hus, despite the lofty accolades bestow ed on the P assovers perform ed by H ezekiah and Josiah (2 C hr 30 :2 6 ; 3 5 :1 8 ), neither ruler explicitly celebrates the o th er festivals and thus fail to com pare yet once again to the utopian Solom on. Therefore, it sh o u ld not be assu m ed too quickly that the term “ appointed festivals” in C hronicles has the sam e scope as it does in P.T hird, C hronicles presents the cultic o bservances in details that are consistent w ith the depictions neither in P n o r w ith o th er portrayals by25.

However, the contexts o f the other rituals mentioned in these latter texts suggest that these passages arc consistent, if not to be equated, with the range o f cultic events outlined by P. The texts assigned to D do not use this particular term.26. The parallel text o f 1 Kgs 9:25 states that Solom on sacrificed three tim es a year but docs not include any further clarification o f when these events took placc.

T hus, Jeh o sh ap h at's reform imitates D a v id 's original m odel, but not as a reinstitution w ithout adaptation to a new historical circum stance.T hird, not only does the tem ple cult becom e repeatedly corrupt, but it ceases to function under A h az and m ust be reinstituted com pletely by H ezekiah (2 C h r 28:24; 2 9 :3 -1 1 ). T his interruption o f service parallels the extended period during the exile w h en the “ land kept its Sabbath״ and no cultic rituals w ere perform ed (2 C h r 3 6 :1 9 -2 1 ). In his reinstitu- tion o f the cult, H ezekiah im itates but does n o t replicate the proper conditions under the previous kings.

In a sim ilar vein, although Josiah attem pts to o bserve the P assover according to the w ritten instructions o f D avid and S olom on and the M osaic T orah, inconsistencies nonetheless exist.

The Id en tity o f th e L evitesIn C hronicles, all those w h o w ould claim to belong to the group known as “ L evites” seem to be genealogically descended from the eponym ous ancestor Levi via o n e o f his three sons: G e rsh o m ,37 K ohath, an d M erari (1 C h r 5:27 [6:1 Eng.]; 6:1 [6:16 Eng.]; 23:6).3* T h e descendants o f G ersh o m and M erari are briefly included (1 C h r 6 : 2 , 4 - 6 [vv. 17, 19-21 Eng.]), but the focus in the initial genealogies o f 1 C h r 5 :2 7 -6 :1 5 (6 :1 - 30 E ng.) is on the line o f K ohath.׳״T h e K ohathites include all o f the A aronide priests an d the leading priests descended from E leazar in particular. T he Z adokites also receive their A aronide and Levitieal pedigree in this passage. Further, the pro- phctic figure o f Sam uel is attached to the K ohathitc genealogy o f 1 C hr 6 :7 -1 5 (vv. 2 2 - 3 0 E ng.) in contrast to his apparent E phraim ite ancestry in 1 S am 1:1 .4°־ It is through this Sam uel that o n e o f the leading Levitieal37.

This is in agreement w ith the claim s o f P (see Exod 6:16 19; Num 26:57 58).39. Compare the high value placed 011 the Kohathites as distinct from the other tw o Levitieal groups in Num 4:18-20.40.

A Cultic UtopiaT h e repeated references to the divisions o f the priests, Levites. singers and m usicians, and gatekeepers throughout C hronicles w ould suggest that this system w as o f significant con cern for the C hronicler. Certain priests, L evites, singers an d m usicians, an d gatekeepers are assigned specific tasks prior to the “official\" appointm ent o f the divisions under D a v id ’s authority in 1 C h r 2 3 -2 6 . T hese allocations are based on various authorities: M oses (1 C h r 6:34 [v. 49 Eng.]; 15:15; 21:29), Sam uel (1 C hr 9:22), and o f co u rse D avid (1 C h r 6 : 1 6 [ v . 3 l Eng.]; 9:22; 15:1- 24; 16:4 7, 37 42). In addition, although h e docs not create them , the leading priest P hinehas is associated w ith the perform ance o f specific Levitical duties ( 1 C h r 9:20). In the details o f the “official\" appointments, only in the priestly divisions are arrangem ents m ade on the authority o f an y o n e else besides D avid alone: the priestly divisions them selves arc organized by D avid in consultation w ith the tw o leading priests Z adok an d A biathar (1 C h r 24:3), an d the procedure for entering the house o f G o d is based on the authority o f A aron (1 C h r 24:19). T hese alone am o n g all o f the innovations in these chapters arc not attributed directly to the decision o f David. T hus, all o f the decisions involving the various groups associated w ith the L evites are not presented as being under the authority o f the priests o r o f the leading p riest in particular.T h e ultim ate authority for these divisions, how ever, is related by D avid in his instructions to Solom on. D avid m entions the divisions o f the priests an d L evites tw ice in his rem arks ( 1 C h r 2 8 :1 3 ,2 1 ) and claim s that his entire plan for the tem ple that S olom on is to construct— appar- cntly including these very im portant divisions has b een w ritten down “ at the direction o f YHWH” w ho had m ade all o f this clear to David ( 1 C h r 2 8 :1 1 -1 9 ).

T he term for “plan” (ת ב נ י ת ) used in vv. 1 1 and 19 also appears in the description o f G o d 's revelation o f the plans for the tabernacle to M oses (E xod 25:9).

In addition, after three periods o f neglect o f the tem ple, the divisions are re-established as part o f the cultic reform s. First, Jehoiada reinstates the divisions according to D a v id 's program (2 C h r 23:18 19).

Second, after initial reform s, H ezekiah appoints the priestly an d Levitieal divisions, and they w ere enrolled in official records (2 C hr 31:2, 17 19). Third, at the celebration o f Passover, Josiah em ploys the priestly and Levitieal divisions in accordance w ith the w ritten stipula- tions m ad e centuries earlier by D avid and S olom on (2 C h r 35:2, 4 -5 ,10). In all o f these various descriptions. C hronicles presents a basic plan established by D avid that is the source for m ultiple reincarnations but that could not be replicated precisely d u e to the different historical circum stances in w hich subsequent generations found them selves. H ow ever, all o f these structures claim continuity w ith the D avidic model despite blatant innovations o r adjustm ents. T h u s, the organization o f the tem ple cult in C hronicles is not consistent w ith a s ta tic p ic tu re at one point or m ultiple points in time.4* ־R enew al and change are inherent to the survival an d efficacy o f the cult, even in the rotational duty system for its personnel.

The D u fies o f th e L evitesT h e L evites are associated w ith a variety o f responsibilities, duties, and privileges in the IIB. D euteronom y presents the Levites as priests, as the guardians an d teachers o f Torah, and as so m e o f the ju d g e s in difficult m atters (D cut 17:8 13).46 In P, the L evites serve as assistants to the priests in the role o f caretakers for the cultic objects in the Tabernacle (e.g. N u m 1:50-53; 8:19, 26; 18:1-7, 2 1 -2 3 , 31) an d as its gatekeepers o r g u ard s (e.g. N u m 1:53). H ow ever, in Leviticus, P does not specify w hat distinct role the L evites h ave that differentiates th em from the A aronides in the detailed descriptions o f the offerings in that book.47 In addition, they are to receive a portion 01' the tithes as their com pensation after distributing the appropriate am ount to the priests (e.g. N um 18:21 32). A lso, P assigns to the L evites several citics that arc scattered throughout the other tribes, including the six cities o f refuge (L ev 2 5 :3 2 - 34; N um 3 5 :l- 3 4 ) .48 Finally, the L evites are associated repeatedly w ith the ark o f covenant, and especially fo r its transportation, in a variety o f texts.49T hese duties associated w ith the L evites in texts other than Chronicles are alm ost entirely cultic in nature.50 T h e particular functions o f teacher an d ju d g e m a y im ply that at least so m e L evites engaged in scribal activity, but the term inology o f “w riting\" associated w ith scribalism isdepictions in Chronicles.

This Dcuteronom (ist)ic view is reflected in Mai 2:4-9. which further states that these teaching priests who are connected with Levi serve as m essengers o f Yhwh for the people.47. 1 lowever, Num 18:3-7 clearly prohibits the Levites from service at the altar and the area \"behind the curtain\" that is the sole responsibility o f the Aaronide priests.48. Deuteronom y, in contrast, docs not acknow ledge distinct “Lcvitical cities” nor does it assign the cities o f refuge to the Levites (18:1-8; 19:1-13: cf. F.xod 21:12-13).

T he L evites w ere appointed for the service o f the tabernacle but the A aronides are the ones m aking the offerings according to the c o m m a n d s o f M oses (1 C h r 6 :3 3 -3 4 [vv. 4 8 - 4 9 Eng.]).

H o w ev er, ju s t a s clearly. C hronicles advances the position that Levites m a y serve tem porarily as priests under extrem e circum stances.First, because o f the failure o f the priests to sanctify them selves for th eir duties, the L evites act as priests until enough A aronide priests are available at the tim e 01' H ezekiah (2 C h r 29:34). Second, in a legal innovation under H ezekiah, the L evites slau g h ter the Pesach in place o f those w ho w ere u nclean (2 C h r 30:17 20). Third, u n d er Josiah, the Levites are allow ed to prepare the P assover offerings for th eir fellow L evites and priests w ho are otherw ise occupied w ith their o w n cultic obligations (2 C h r 3 5 :1 1 -1 5 ). In these instances, it is w orth em phasizing that L evites m ay act as priests or m ay substitute for the unclean, b u t no o n e ever substitutes for the L evites— th eir unique duties are not per- form ed by others in any circum stance.

A Cultic Utopiathese L evites dem onstrate their essential role in the effectiveness o f the cult for the com m unity. A ccording to the presentation 111 C hronicles, if the L evites had b een unable to act outside o f their “n o rm al” obligations, then these events that brought about cultic renew al and restoration in the c o m m u n ity w ould not h ave been possible. H ow ever, instead o f view ing these anom alies as indications that the C hronicler preserved an underly- ing source 01־ tradition for w h ic h he had to apologize, o r that the C hron- icier w as reflecting the current role o f the L evites in S econd T em ple practice, these three exam ples arc best understood a s m odels for the b e tte r a ltern a tive re a lity that could be attained by the com m unity i f they w ould allow for the possibility o f the L evites acting beyond their co m m o n ly accepted duties w h en the situation should dictate.T h e responsibility o f the L evites to care for and carry the ark o f the covenant receives a unique clarification in C hronicles. T h e C hronicler continues the tradition w h ic h associates the Levites w ith the ark ( 1 C hr 6:16 [v. 31 Eng.]; 1 5 :1 1 -1 5 ,2 6 -2 7 ; 16:4-6, 3 7 -3 8 ; 2 C h r 5 :2 -4 ; 35:3), b u t alone addresses the practical issue o f w hat the L evites do o ncc the ark has been placed in S o lo m o n 's tem ple and no longer requires sem i- regular transportation.52 T h e parallel texts o f 2 S a m 6:1-11 and 1 C hr 13 :1-14 state that at the tim e o f D avid the ark w as transported on a cart d raw n by oxen, b u t neither passage indicates that this m ethod w as im proper n o r provides any reason that U zzah should have died for his seem ingly p io u s action. Yet, the C hronicler connects both o f these in the claim that the im proper m ethod w as indeed the reason ( 1 C h r 15:12-13). T hus, the L evites now perform ed their duty an d carricd the ark b y its poles into the city o f D avid (vv. 14-15, 2 5 -2 9 ). H ow ever, o nce the ark has been brought to Jerusalem the Levites no longer n eed to serve in this w ay ( 1 C h r 23:26). Instead, they are to assist the A aronide priests with the offerings and to carc for the m aintenance o f the cultic apparatus (1 C h r 16:37-38; 2 3 :2 8 -3 2 ). T h e L evites carry the ark one final tim e into the new ly built Solom onic tem ple bringing it as far a s they are able. T he priests, w h o alone could enter the “m ost holy place,*' finish the task in accordance w ith their unique access to this part o f the sanctuary (2 C hr 5:2-10).

In a tim e w ithout the ark— a reasonable assum ption as no m ention o f its use in the tem ple cult during the S econd T em ple period is attested in an y contem porary literature54— the rem inder that the L evites have been assigned a vast array o f responsibilities in place o f their traditional role a s “carriers and keepers’' o f the ark serves a utopian function in the depiction o f the cult. In the final reform m ovem ent described in the narrative, the C hronicler em pha- sizes that the ex panded roles o f the L evites in the cult arc essential to its operation. W hile this portrayal has been understood as a reflection o f Second T em ple practice, the irregular actions o f the L evites in preparing the P assover on b e h a lf o f the priests, singers, an d gatekeepers are not presented as the typ ic a l procedures to be followed at the festival. Instead, the narrative affirm s the potential ad a p ta b ility o f the cultic system that dep en d s on the L evites serving in their innovative roles rather than attem pting to restrict these individuals to o ld er m odels that no longer serve a useful function in the present cultic program (i.e. the M osaic m odel w hich em phasizes that the p rim a ry function 01' the L evites is to “ set up an d take d o w n ” the m obile sanctuary). In this regard, the C h ro n icle r's m odel stands both in continuity and tension w ith that o f P— building o n it but critiquing it at the sam e time.T his relationship w ith the stipulations o f P is evident also in the pres- entation o f the role o f the L evites as caretakers o f the cultic apparatus. E ach 01'the three clans o f the L evites is assigned specific responsibilities in the proper erection, packing, and transportation o f the tabernacle and its various cultic objects according to N u m 3 :2 1 -3 7 (cf.

M ost o f these responsibilities are not found in or derived from the tw o passages in N um bers. Except for carrying the m obile ark, the roles o f the Levites in the necessary duties o f transporting the tabernacle are not found in Chronicles.In a m ajor difference from N um bers, the description o f the Levitical duties b y the C hronicler does not distinguish betw een the unique responsibilities o f the three clans. T h e Kohathites are singled out at som e points (e.g. 1 C h r 9:32), but the G ershonites an d M erarites do not have separate duties. Instead, the caretakers o f the cult in C hronicles are nearly uniform ly addressed as “ L evites ״w ithout further differentiation into clans. In another point o f contrast. Phinchas the son o f E leazar is stated to have been in charge o f the L evites perform ing these duties (1 C h r 9:20)— a point never m ade explicit in the Torah.In addition, w hile in the M osaic T orah it is the priests w ho seem to h ave b een w hat could be term ed “gatekeepers,” the service o f gatekeep- ers is explicitly assigned to certain Levites and associated w ith the authority o f D avid (and o f Sam uel) in 1 C h r 9:22 and 2 6 :1-19. In Chron- icles, the K orahites o f the K ohathite clan and a few o f the M erarites are assigned to the w eekly divisions o f the gatekeepers that parallel the other divisions o f the cultic personnel (1 C h r 9 :1 7 -2 7 ; 2 6 :1 -1 9 ). T hese gatekeepers serve as guardians o f the cultic area and h ave the specific duties o f night w atch and o f “open in g ” (ם פ ״ ה ) it for use each m orning (1 C h r 9:19, 2 6 -2 7 ). A lthough gatekeepers arc m en tio n ed in Ezra and N ehem iah, they do n o t appear explicitly as L evites and their duties are not described. C hronicles, how ever, provides them w ith a Levitical heritage an d m entions them in the perform ance o f the duties w ith som e frequency (1 C h r 9 :1 7 -3 2 ; 15:18, 2 3 -2 4 ; 16:38; 23:4; 2 6 :1 -1 9 ; 2 C hr 8:14; 2 3 :4 -1 1 , 19; 3 4 :1 2 -1 3 ; 35:15)."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Reading Utopia in Chronicles158O ne o f the duties o f the gatekeepers that has received particular attcn- tion in scholarship is th eir service as a military׳ (or param ilitary) force.

T h e exceptional nature o f this description w ithin C hroniclcs further em phasizes the utopian construct being presented in various m eans throughout the book.

It is w orth repeating, how ever, that the L evites in this text are not so m e param ilitary group, but the “ch o ir ״w h o do not need to engage in arm ed conflict to b e victorious.T h e association o f the L evites as singers o r m usicians in the tem ple cult is not unique to C hronicles.

This identification may o r m ay not be correct, but the C h ro n icler's intense concern over the Levitical singers and m usicians in his w ork certainly cannot be doubted.T h e first appearance o f the L evites in C hronicles is their association as singers in the tabernacle by D a v id 's authority and in S o lo m o n ’s temple (1 C h r 6 :1 6 -1 7 [vv. 3 1 -3 2 Eng.]). T his introductory statem ent is follow ed by genealogies for the three ep onym ous leaders o f the singers: H em an the K ohathite, A saph the G ershom ite, and Ethan the M erarite (vv. 18-32 [vv. 3 3 -4 7 Eng.]). T hese three individuals along w ith the rest o f their k indred singers next ap p ear in 1 C h r 15:16-28 at the successful transfer o f the ark to Jerusalem . In this passage, the L evites sing, they play m usical instrum ents including the three m ost co m m o n ly associated w ith these m usicians— harps, lyres, an d cym bals— and they w ear fine linen. H orns an d trum pets are also mentioned.For this event, the leaders o f the L evites appoint singers fro m their kindred, including one Levite w ho served as the director since he “under- stood'' the m usic (]'HD; v. 22). T h e priests h ave 110 control over these singers as it is D avid w h o appoints the divisions o f the Levitical singers an d m usicians (1 C h r 16:4 7, 42; 23:5; 25:1 31). T he direct account- ability o f the three e p onym ous Levitical singers (in this case, Asaph, H em an, an d Jeduthun) to the king— thereby by-passing the priests 01 ־leading priest— is em phasized in the repetition o f this point in 1 C hr 2 5 :2 ,6 . T he Levitical singers arc uniquely presented as being trained for th eir occupation w ith som e o f th em being “ teachers\" and so m e “stu- dents\" (v. 8). N one o f the other Levitical o r priestly groups are associated w ith this type o f instructional system — including those w h o teach the Torah. A fter the establishm ent o f th eir divisions by D avid, the singers appear in C hronicles at significant cultic events: the tem ple dedication by S olom on (2 C h r 5 :1 2 -1 3 ; 7:6; 8:14), the victory over the en em y through praise u n d er Jehoshaphat (2 C h r 2 0 :1 9 -2 8 ), the rededication o f the tem ple under H ezekiah (2 C h r 29:25 30), the celebration o f Passover u nder H ezekiah (2 C h r 30:21), and the celebration o f P assover under Josiah (2 C h r 35:15).T h e inclusion o f the Levitical singers during these cultic events is not unexpected in C hronicles. T he m ost intriguing association w ith these singers that is m ad e in C hronicles— at least fo r num ero u s scholars— is the claim that their singing and playing o f m usical instrum ents in the cult w as prophetic in nature (1 C h r 25:1, 2, 3).

First, the association o f L evites w ith prophets in this verse is m ad e only on a synoptic reading o f the passage in K ings. It is questionable w h eth er the C hronicler intends his audience to h ave the text o f K ings available to consult in order to notice this “change” o r its im plied significance. Second, this w ould be the only instance in C hronicles in w hich the L evites as a w hole an d not the singers 01־ their leaders alone are associated w ith prophecy.64 T hus, it is an overstatem ent to assert that the C hronicler correlates the Levitieal singers, o r w o rse the L evites as a w hole, o f his o w n tim e w ith the prophets o f the past.6561. The MT o f 2 Chr 35:15 has the singular ,)־וזה(\"“sccr but the plural (C*Tה ) is attested in other ancient versions (LXX, Vulgate, Syriac, and the Targum).

T he Levitical care o f th em is affirm ed explicitly only in 1 C h r 29:8. W hile not m entioning treasuries, the L evites a s well a s the priests are associated w ith the m o n ey and gifts brought into the tem p le as donations for its repair (2 C h r 2 4 :5 -1 4 ; 3 1 :4 -1 4 ; 3 4 :8 -1 4 ). In the construction an d operation o f storehouses by H ezekiah for the portions to be distributed to the L evites and priests, tw o L evites arc placed in charge (2 C h r 31:12). H ow ever, cultic treasuries are not the only type o f treasuries m entioned in C hronicles. Royal treasuries are clearly distinguished from the cultic ones in 1 C h r 27:25; 2 C h r 12:9; 16:2; 25:24; 28:21 (im plied); 32:27 28; 36:18. O f these texts, only the reference to royal treasuries established by D avid in 1 C h r 27:25 lacks a parallel 01־ sim ilar statem ent in K ings.72 N one o f the references to royal treasuries in C hronicles m akes an y m ention o f Levitical responsibility for their care.73 T hus, the L evites arc explicitly responsible for the cultic treasuries, w h ile the identity o f the individuals w ho are in charge o f the royal treasuries is n ev er m ad e explicit. In the S econd T em ple period there m ay have been no “royal” treasuries in Y ehud.74 T w o texts in N eh em iah assert the existence o f cultic treasuries o r storehouses in Jerusalem at tw o separate points in tim e during this period (N eh 7:70; 13:13). In the latter, N ehem iah appoints one priest, o n e scribe, and one Levite w ith tw o assistants over these facilities used for the distribution o f portions to the tem ple personnel.Also, in C hronicles, the priests o r leading priest is connected w ith the m oney brought into the treasuries (see the roles o f Jehoiada, A zariah, and Ililkiah in the three passages cited above), b u t the overseeing o f the treasuries an d storehouses them selves is assigned to the L evites indc- pendently o f the priesthood in Chronicles. Is this a reflection o f Second T em p le practice, o r a n innovation in the adm inistration o f the cultic finances advocated by the C hronicler? A ny cultic duty that is n o t sacrifi- cial in nature a priestly responsibility, i f it w ere w ould easily be72. The parallel texts arc, respectively: I Kgs 14:26: 15:18: 2 Kgs 14:14; 16:8 (explicit, not implied); 20:13 (different context, but existence made clear); 24:13.73. The list o f David’s stewards docs not suggest any o f these individuals were Levites.74. This is an important point. The Levites are not depicted as being in charge of the \"secular'' treasuries in the past. I f the Chronicler wished to expand their influ־ cncc, this would be one means o f doing so. Their past duties in non-cultic arenas that no longer exist could easily be extrapolated to other non-cultic duties that do exist in the present, which they could oversee by implication."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Reading Utopia in Chronicles166associated w ith the types o f duties that the Levites p erfo rm in the routine m aintenance o f the cult and provision for its personnel in a variety o f texts in C hronicles. T hus, w ithout additional evidence to support the claim s o f the L evites a lo n e to have this duty, this Levitieal responsibility for overseeing the cultic treasuries as expressed in C hroniclcs should be interpreted as a utopian elem ent sim ilar to those previously discussed.Second, the responsibility for these treasuries m a y suggest that the Levites had so m e w riting ability or, at the very least, that they w ere able to count and apportion significant quantities o f various item s to the appropriate recipients. T hus, it is not surprising to find Levites associated w ith scribal activities o r stated to be scribes in C hronicles. H ow ever, the n u m b er o f instances in w hich such a connection is m ad e is relatively sm all. In fact, only tw o individual L evites are said to have w ritten any- thing o r to have been a scribe. T he first is a certain S hcm aiah, a Levite an d a scribe, w ho records the list o f priestly divisions (1 C h r 29:6), but the identity o f the o n e or ones w h o recorded the o th e r lists o f the various Levitieal divisions is not m entioned. T he second individual is Sam uel, the prophet/seer w ho records the events o f D av id 's reign, although his Levitieal pedigree is kn o w n only from a previous passage (1 C h r 29:29 and 6:13, 18-23 [vv. 28, 3 3 -3 8 Eng.], respectively). In addition, a group o f Levites served as scribes at the tim e o f Jo siah w ithout specifying w hat types o f things they recorded o r w rote (2 C h r 34:13). T hus, so m e Levites serv ed as scribes, but the precise nature o f their responsibilities o r the subject m atter w hich they dealt w ith is unclear in Chronicles.O th e r p o ssib le associations betw een scribal activities and L evites have b een suggested: their service as ju d g e s (1 C h r 2 6 :2 9 -3 2 ; 2 C hr 19:8-11 ); their service a s teachers o f the T orah (2 C h r 17:7 9; 35:3; cf. the “teaching priest ״o f 2 C h r 15:3); the im plem entation o f the “teacher\" and “ pupil\" instructional model o f the Levitieal singers and m usicians ( 1 C hr 25:8);75 and the enrollm ents o f the L evites and priests in genealogies (2 C h r 3 1 :1 2 -1 9 ). H ow ever, n one o f these texts explicitly claim s that the Levites w ere scribes n o r m entions them writing anything. In fact, none o f the references in C hronicles to genealogies states w h o w ere the ones reco rd in g such inform ation as the w ritten genealogical records.76 This silence is also true for the few references to enrollm ents in genealogies in75. It is unnecessary to postulate scribalism in the structured instruction o f music and singing. One only needs to think o f the significant number o f m usicians who \"play by ear” or sing in choirs without ever learning how lo read one note o f m usic.76. Each reference to genealogical records in Chroniclcs is silent about who wrote them down ( 1 Chr 5:1,17; 7:5, 7, 9, 40; 9:1, 22; 23:11, 24; 2 Chr 31:15-19). O nly for the recording o f the priestly divisions is som eone named, who is a Levite and a scribe, as noted above (1 Chr 24:6)."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"1674.

T hus, in N u m b e rs, the task is neither assigned to nor restricted to the Levites, but involves the leading priest an d civil leaders.C hronicles acknow ledges that a single Levite m ay be a scribe o r that a group o f Levitical scribes m a y exist, but it d o es n o t m ak e an effort to associate all scribal activities w ith the Levites. Instead, C hronicles includes references to scribes w ho do n o t h ave Levitical heritages: the scribes associated w ith the tribe o f Judah ( 1 C h r 2:55), and the uncle o f D avid w h o served as a co u n selo r an d a scribe ( 1 C h r 27:32). In the pres- cntation o f C hronicles, the scant am ount o f inform ation about the scribal activities o f the L evites an d the obvious affirm ation that not all scribes are L evites requires the conclusion that the C hronicler w as not attem pt- ing to use scribalism to separate the L evites from the priests and to consolidate p o litic a l p o w e r for these now independent Levites.77A s w ith the previous Levitical duties, th eir status as scribes should be view ed as part o f the C h ro n icler’s utopian motif. N ot all scribes are Levites, but Levites m a y be scribes. Perhaps the C hronicler is m aking the case that Levites should be scribes too. T hat is, these few exam ples depict L evites as scribes w ithin the cultic sy stem and even as the com - posers o f court records (i.e. Sam uel). H ow ever, there is n o effort to present large groups o f scribes w h o diligently record, copy, o r com pose docum ents o f any particular types o f subject m atter. Rather, the Chroni- clcr affirm s that L evites m ay be and even s h o u ld he am o n g those w o rk in g as scribes.

T he entire depiction o f L evites as scribes in C hronicles could reflect a better a ltern a tive re a lity constructed by the C hronicler in w hich L evites d o serve as scribes regardless o f their present em p lo y m e n t in such capacity.

A lso, the record- ing o f the priestly divisions by the Levite-scribe occurs in the presence o f the two leading priests and other priests— among the large number o f people stated to be there (1 Chr 24:6). This hardly seem s to suggest the independence o f this Levite- scribe from the priests.

L evites are appointed as ju d g e s by D avid in 1 C h r 2 6 :2 9 -3 2 and by Jehoshaphat in 2 C h r 19:8-11. In D a v id 's system , Izharite L evites are appointed as ju d g e s for “ outside w o rk ” (1 C h r 26:29).78 D avid also appoints tw o groups o f H ebronites a s ju d g e s over different geographic regions o f his kingdom . T hose related to H ashabiah are placed in charge o f the C isjordan an d those related to Jerijah are over the Transjordan. Both groups are responsible for tw o distinct categories o f issues: the w o rk o f YHWH and the service o f the king (v. 30), also expressed a s the m atters o f G o d an d the m atters o f the king (v. 32). T h e identification o f these H ebronites as L evites is not explicit in this text in C hronicles, but other textual cvidcncc from C hronicles and the T orah w ould suggest that they should be considered so.79 T h e nam e Jerijah is also h ig h ly sug- gestive, but not conclusive, that these individuals w ere Levites.80 I f these tw o g ro u p s o f H ebronites are Levites, as seem s m ost likely, then this text places Levites o f the K ohathite clan in positions as ju d g e s over the entire D avidic kingdom in both cultic and civil affairs.81In Jeh o sh a p h at’s system , ju d g e s are appointed throughout the cities o f Judah (2 C h r 19:5). T h e identity o f these ju d g e s is not specified,78. This odd phrase also appears in Neh 11:6. In both eases, the m eaning is unclear. Work not directly related to the temple or outside its precincts has been sug* gested; see the NJPS translation.79. Hebron is most fam ously associated with the tribe o f Judah in one o f two contexts: (1 ) the city conquered by Caleb, and thus its location within Judah (Josh 14:13-14: 15:13; 20:7; 21 :1 1 ; Judg 1:10,20; 1 Chr 2:42-43; 6:40 [v. 55 Eng.]); and (2) its function as D avid’s first capital city (2 Sam 2 :1 -4 , 11; 3:2-5; 5:1-5, 13; I Kgs 2:11; I Chr 3:4; 11:1-3; 29:29).Hebron is also one o f the sons o f Kohath the Levitc who had descendants serving in the cult (Exod 6:18; Num 3:19,27; 26:58; I Chr 6:1,3 [vv. 2, 18 Eng.]; 23:12, 19; 24:23[?]; 26:23). The descendents o f a prominent Levite named Hebron, who may or may not be this same individual, are listed am ong those Levites and priests who assisted in the transfer o f the ark to Jerusalem (I Chr 15:4-10). The city o f Hebron as a Levitical city is explicitly associated with the Kohathites in I Chr 6:39-41 (vv. 54-56 Eng.).80. The name Jerijah (י רי ה) is found only in 1 Chr 26:31. H owever, a Jerijahu (* הו“ *) is m entioned in I Chr 23:19; 24:23. In all three passages— the only appear- ances o f this name— the individual is associated with the Hebronites. These Hebron- itcs arc clearly Levites in the final tw o references. Japhet asserts without qualification that both groups o f Hebronites should be understood as Levites (/ & I I C h r o n ic le s, 454).81.

A Cultic Utopiahowever.*2 T he relationship b etw een this group o f ju d g e s and the group o f ju d g e s w h o are ap p o in ted over disputed cases and are located in Jerusalem is m u c h debated. T h e identity o f the second “h ig h er court\" sh o u ld n o t be associated w ith the ju d icial adm inistration in the rest o f the land as there is no evidence to suggest that ju d g e s form ed a hom ogene- o u s group at any point in Israel's history. W hile the identity o f the first group m ust rem ain unknow n, the second group consists o f an unspecified num ber o f Levites, priests, and leaders o f the fam ilies o f Israel (2 C hr 19:8). T hus, both cultic and civil authorities are involved. Further details about this a rrangem ent include the division o f subject m atter fo r such cases into the m atters o f YHWH and the m atters o f the king, each w ith an individual supervisor. O v er the cultic affairs is the leading p riest and o v e r the royal (possibly civil) affairs is the g o v ern o r o f Judah. T he Levites serve both groups as so m e form o f assistants (2 C h r 19:11). Several points are w orth em phasizing: ( I ) the distinction betw een these tw o spheres seem s only to apply at the level o f the central court in Jerusalem and n o t to the low er courts; (2) the param eters o f w hat type o f issues fall into each category is not distinguished; (3) the L evites are not in charge o f either the 10w׳e r courts o r the central court for disputed cases; and (4) the ancestry o f the g overnor is not clearly connected to any specific tribe o r fam ily in Israel.T h e position o f the L evites in each o f these versions o f the Israelite judicial system is significant. 111 D av id 's system , the L evites arc com - plctcly in charge; in Jeh o sh a p h at's system , they arc under the authority o f the leading priest an d g overnor an d com prise only part o f a cultic and civil court. T he inconsistency is best explained as part o f the utopian por- trayal o f the Levites. E ither structure w ould be better than the present— w hatever it m ay have been! T h e C hronicler offers tw o possible m eans o f running a functional ju d icial system , either o f w hich could be im pie- m ented, although the o n e u n d er Jehoshaphat could possibly have been m o re directly applicable to the C hronicler's ow n time.

It has been suggested that all three o f these elem ents co m e together for the first time d u rin g the reign o f D avid.83 If this is correct, it m a y suggest that the organization o f the personnel into divisions allow ed for so m e to function as teachers o f the Torah. H ow ever, nothing in the chapters describing those divisions indicates that the personnel en g ag ed in such actions. T he only possible exception m ight be the establishm ent o f the Levitical ju d g e s ( 1 C h r 2 6 :2 9 -3 2 ), b u t there is 110 hint that these Levites (w h o arc n o t priests) provided the people w ith instruction in Torah. T h u s, the precise naUire o f this claim in Chronicles m ust rem ain nebulous, although its association o f the teaching o f the Torah w ith the priests is explicit.T h e first clear reference to instruction in T orah being undertaken appears during the reign o f Jehoshaphat p rio r to his ju d icial reform s (2 C h r 17:7-9). 111 this b rief passage, Jehoshaphat sends five officials, nine Levites, and tw o priests throughout the cities o f Judah w ith the book o f the T orah o f Yhw h to teach the people. Im plicitly as a result, Jeho- shaphat prospers and lives in peace (2 C h r 17:10-13). T his com bination o f cultic personnel and civil leaders parallels the co m position o f the central court in Jeh o sh ap h at's ju d icial reform (2 C h r 19:8). Finally, the Levites alone arc stated to be teachers for all Israel in 2 C h r 35:3. The subject o f their instruction is not stated; it m ay be lim ited to the T orah or m a y be m ore extensive so a s to include ju d icial rulings such as those o f the central court as w ell.84T hese texts affirm that the L evites serve as teachers.

A s noted previously, “ seeking G o d ” is one o f the prim ary expres- sions o f spirituality in C hronicles.

T h e first m ention o f any positive religious act,87 cultic or otherw ise, in C hronicles is the prayer for divine assistance and protection offered by Jabez (1 C h r 4 :9 -1 0 ). Second, the G adites pray w hile battling their en em ies (I C h r 5 :1 9 -2 2 ). T hird, D avid inquires o f G od before success- fully engaging the Philistines in battle (1 C h r 14:9-12). Fourth, in D avid's p ray er to G od following the declaration by N athan that G o d will build a house for David, he calls on the deity to act in accordance w ith his prom- isc (1 C h r 17:16-27). Fifth, as the angel is preparing to strike the inhabi- tants o f Jerusalem , David pleads w ith G od to en d the plague against the people (1 C h r 2 1 :1 6 -1 7 ).

First, the psalm o f praise associated w ith the A saphite singers concludes with an appeal for G o d 's intervention (1 C h r 16:35). Second, at the consecration o f the gifts donated for the tem ple at the end o f his life, D avid prays to G o d to assist the people in th eir spiritual direction an d to enable S olom on to be obedient an d successful ( 1 C h r 2 9 :1 8 -1 9 ). Third, the tabcrnacle in G ibcon at the beginning o f his reign, Solom on requests w isdom from G od to rule (2 C h r 1:3-10). Fourth, at the dedication o f the tem ple, Solom on offers a lengthy p ray er that em pha- sizes the prom ises m ad e to D avid, the forgiveness o f the p e o p le's sins, the eventual return o f the people from captivity, an d the tem ple as a locus for prayer for both Israelites an d foreigners (2 C h r 6 :1 2 -4 2 ). Fifth, during a period o f fasting in the tem ple, Jehoshaphat prays to G o d for deliverance from the coalition o f forces com ing to attack Judah (2 C hr 2 0 :5 -1 2 ). Sixth, during the celebration o f Passover, H ezekiah prays that G o d will pardon those w h o w ere seeking G od an d yet ate the Pesach im properly (2 C h r 30:18-20).T h e se data d em onstrate that according to C hronicles prayer is appro- priatc in both cultic and non-cultic contexts. T his is consistent w ith the depiction o f prayer in the H B, b u t this understanding o f prayer in Chroni- cles is significant in that the C hronicler does not restrict p ray er to the cultic sphere. Also, w hile the king is repeatedly presented as the indi- vidual offering the prayer, others do so as well: Jabez, the G adites, the A saphite singers, the prophet Isaiah, and the Israelites and foreigners have the opportunity to d o so. In addition, C hroniclcs docs not explicitly present the priests, the leading priest, o r other Levites as offering prayers to G od either as individuals o r in public liturgies.

H ow - ever, this elevation o f the L evites has b een view ed m ost typically as a reflection o f th eir status during the C h ro n ic le r's o w n tim e. 111 this view, the C hronicler w rites to provide this group w ith a legitimate claim for the duties that they are cu rren tly perform ing in the cult and in the larger com m unity. Som e scholars have noted that it is difficult to determ ine w hich descriptions o f the Levites arc reflections o f the present an d which ones are part o f the C h ro n icler's v ision for the future. H ow ever, this insight alm ost a lw ay s o ccu rs in p assing rem arks— often 111 footnotes— that serve as a type o f disclaim er b efo re the scholars pro ceed to connect these portrayals w ith so m e situation or developm ent in the cult or larger society during the Second T em ple period. U topian literary theory inter- prêts these data as part o f the C h ro n ic le r's vision for a different future an d em phasizes the p ro b a b ility that these innovations serve as critiques o f the present and o f the sta tu s q u o.Second, the Levites, m o re than any o th e r group in C hronicles, are the focus o f the C h ro n icler’s utopianism . O ther groups, such as the priests an d the kings, are depicted in utopian terms, b u t they serve only to support the prim ary conccrn that C hronicles m anifests for the utopian portrayal o f the Levites. T hese tem ple personnel are not restricted to the roles o f “ second class” assistants to the m o re significant priests. Their responsibilities are not lim ited to the less glam orous, m undane, or d em eaning tasks that arc necessary for the practical operation o f the tem ple cult. H ow ever, the Levites are neither m ade com pletely independ- ent o f the priesthood in their cultic and “secular” duties, n o r are they presented as replacing the priests, n o r are they even presented as the highest authority in cultic affairs. T h e Levites arc presented as engaging in a variety o f activities in the cult that are not found 01־ only hinted at in88. The parallel text of 1 Kgs 8:26-53 also makes this same point repeatedly."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Reading Utopia in Chronicles174other texts. 111 these instances, C hroniclcs asserts the in d isp en sa b ility o f the Levites for the successful operation o f the cult. A nd yet, not all o f these innovations in their duties are assigned strictly to the Levites alone. M any o f these tasks and vo catio n s are shared by other m em b ers o f the com m unity, both priests and Israelites not serving as cultic personnel. T hus, C hronicles does not attem pt to claim e xc lu siv e rights for the L evites in all o f these cases. Rather, C hronicles argues that the L evites sh o u ld b e a part, even a significant part, o f the operation o f the cult and aspects o f the larger adm inistration o f the c o m m u n ity that arc being perform ed by others in the present.Thus, the L evites are the focus o f the C h ro n ic ler's utopian vision for the com m unity. T he m o n arch y is an institution o f the past that h as served its purpose. T h e priests arc ncccssary for the operation o f the cult but h ave lim ited areas o f service, and they have a history o f failure in their duties and piety. T h e Levites, in contrast, are dependable, versatile, and will continue to exist as a vibrant group in the c o m m u n ity ’s future. Their incorporation into new areas o f responsibility w ithin the cult enhances the ability o f the com m unity to \"seek G o d ” and to be taught \"th e good w ay\" in w hich to live (2 C h r 6:27). T he conditions o f the present w ill be im proved as the L evites are allow ed to serve in a w ide variety and n u m b er o f functions, according to the C h ro n ic le r's argum ent.T hird, C hronicles does not construct a detailed blueprint for the pre- cise nature 01' these roles and their im pact o n the operation 01' the cult. M uch o f the inform ation still rem ains vague o r even contradictory. Som etim es tw o o r three different descriptions o f possible scenarios arc presented. Instead o f assum ing that this is the result o f m ultiple redac- tional layers o r evidence o f historical developm ent w ith in the text, a utopian reading em p h asizes the a d a p ta b ility o f the system o v e r tim e to n e w circum stances.89 T he C hronicler is providing options, n o t a rigid system to be im plem ented o nce and for all. T hese various structures indicate that organizational structures m a y a n d do ch an g e o v e r time. Innovation and continuity are not m utually exclusive.Fourth, the cultic utopia o f C hronicles is n o t a perfect system that operates sm oothly an d rem ains the sam e indefinitely. T he cultic utopia o f C hronicles is a better a ltern a tive rea lity that operates in continuity w ith the cultic regulations found in the tradition w hile adapting th em to n e w situations. T h e procedures o f the cultic celebrations m a y also vary in th eir o rd e r 01־ details w ithout jeo p ard izin g their efficacy. T he cultic utopia incorporates additional individuals as personnel and assigns them89. Compare ihe assertion by Ackroyd that \"the Chronicler is hesitant about the precise nature o f the future״ (C h r o n ic le r in H is A g e , 309)."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"1754.

In all 01' these cases, it is the L evites w ho ensure through their actions and interpretations that the innovations are still perform ed so as to m aintain continuity w ith the traditions.

Here we find as good an engagement with utopian critical theory as can be found. The detailed new proposal for reading Chronicles as an experimental Utopia effectively breaks those books open for a whole new range of innovative work.”— R o la n d B o e r, A s s o c ia te P ro fe sso r in C o m p a ra tiv e L ite ra tu re a n d C u lt u r a l S tu d ie s a t M o n a s h U n iv e rsity , A u s tr a liaIn order to address the coherence o f Chronicles as a whole, Steven Schweitzer employs the literary approach of utopian literary theory to examine three major concerns of Chronicles: genealogy, politics, and the temple cult. Considering Chroniclcs as utopian in character, Schweitzer posits that its cultic practices and systems may reflect desired changes, not historical realities. The Chronicler, then, may have been constructing a desired system, which would possibly be implemented in the future. Utopian literary theory suggests that this ideal depiction o f society is in tension with historical reality. From this viewpoint, Chronicles provides an excellent source for looking once more at the problems and ideological struggles of the late Persian or early Hellenistic period, rather than at a text produced by those elite who are advocating a continuation of the status quo.It is therefore suggested that the utopianism of Chronicles has a great deal in common with Ezekiel’s restored temple, the New Heavens and New Earth, the New Jerusalem, and the future anticipated by the Qumran community. However, while these other texts present their utopian ideology as future idealized visions, Chronicles presents its utopian future as an idealized portrayal set in Israel’s historical past and points to an alternative reality constructed as “how it should be.” This volume provides a provocative alternative to the role Chronicles plays in the history and future of ancient Israel.S te v e n S c h w e itz e r is Assistant Professor of Old Testament at Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary in Elkhart, Indiana.At & t d a r k"}]
