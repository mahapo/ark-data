It happened that this damsel heard tell of all the gra-ciousness and nobility of king Alexander, and at once she wanted to love him for the great fameof his gentle breeding. But this damsel was so far off from this great lord, on whom of her ownwill she had set her love, that she could neither see him nor possess him; and because of this sheEnglish Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

And when she saw that this far-offlove, which within her was so near to her, was without her so far away, she thought to herselfthat she could comfort her sorrowful heart by making some imagined likeness of her loved one,for love of whom her heart was many a time sorely wounded. So she had a picture painted torepresent the likeness of the king whom she loved, as near as she could to the appearance underwhich she loved him, by the affection of the love with which she was overcome; and by means ofthis picture and of her other rites of love she could imagine that the king himself was present.The Soul.Truly, says the Soul who had this book made, I speak to you of matters similarto this. I heard tell of a most mighty king, who through his graciousness and his most graciousnobility and generosity was a noble Alexander; but he was so far away from me and I from himthat I could find no comfort for myself; and to remind me of him he gave me this book, which insome rites represents the love of him. But even though I have this picture, still I am in a distantland, and far from the palace where the most noble loved ones of this lord dwell, they who are allpure and made perfect and free by the gifts of this king with whom they dwell.The Writer.Therefore we shall tell you how our Lord is in no way freed by Love, but Love isfreed by him for our sakes, so that the little ones through you can hear of this; for Love can do allthings, and not do wrong to anyone.And so Love says for you:There are seven states of noble being, from which the creaturereceives being, if she disposes herself to every state, before she attains to perfect being; and weshall tell you how before this book ends.Chapter 2. Of what is Love’s undertaking, and why Love hadthis book madeLove.Children of Holy Church, says Love, it is for you that I have made this book, so that youmay hear of and so hold in greater worth the prfection of life and the state of peace, to which thecreature can attain by the power of perfect charity, which gift is made to it by the whole Trinity;and you will hear this gift described in this book by the replies of Understanding of Love toReason’s questions.Chapter 3. Here Love speaks of the precepts of Holy ChurchLove.And so we will begin here, says Love, with the precepts of Holy Church, so that everyonemay be able to find his nourishment in this book with the help of God, who commands us to lovehim with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole strength, to love ourselves as we ought,and to love our neighbors as ourselves.First, that we should love God with our whole heart - that is to say that our thoughts shouldalways be truly directed towards him: and with our whole soul, that is that we should say nothingbut what is true, even though we die for it: and with our whole strength, that is that we shouldperform all our works solely for him; and that we should love ourselves as we ought, that isthat doing so we should not look to our advantage but to the perfect will of God: and that weshould love our neighbors as ourselves, that is that we should not do or think or say towards ourneighbors anything that we should not wish them to do to us. These precepts are necessary to allmen for their salvation: by no lesser manner of life can anyone have grace.Notice here the story of the young man who said to Jesus Christ that he had kept these preceptsfrom his childhood, and how Jesus Christ said to him: there is one thing that you must do if youwish to be perfect. That is, go and sell everything that you have and give it to the poor, and thenfollow me, and you will have treasure in heaven. That is the counsel of the highest perfection ofthe virtues, and whoever kept it would abide in true charity.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

Of the noble virtue of Charity and how she obeysno-one but LoveLove.Charity is obedient to no created thing, but only to Love. Charity has nothing of her own,and even if she had anything, she does not say that it is hers at all. Charity abandons her owntask and goes off and does that of others. Charity asks no return of any creature, whatever goodor happiness she may give. Charity knows no shame or fear or anxiety: she is so upright and truethat she cannot bend, whatever happens to her. Charity takes no notice or account of anythingunder the sun, for the whole world is no more than superfluity and excess. Charity gives toeveryone everything that she possesses, and does not withhold even herself, and in addition, sheoften promises what she does not possess, in her great generosity hoping that the more one gives,the more one will have left. Charity is such a shrewd business woman that she makes a profiteverywhere; when others lose, she escapes from the bonds in which others become caught, andso her store of those things that are pleasing to Love multiplies greatly. And notice that if anyonewas to have perfect charity, he would have his affections mortified in the life of the spirit by thework of Charity.Chapter 5. Of that life which is called the peace of charity in alife brought to nothingLove.Now there is another life, which we call the peace of charity in a life brought to nothing. Ofthis we wish to speak, says Love, asking:iwhether there can be found a souliiwho saves itself without works,iiiwho lives alone in love,ivwho does nothing for God,vwho does not refrain from doing anything for God,vito whom one can teach nothing,viifrom whom one can take nothing away,viiito whom one can give nothing,ixand who has no will at all?Love.Alas, says Love, and who will give to this Soul what she lacks, for that was never givenand never will be given?Love.This Soul, says Love, has six wings, just as the Seraphim. She no longer wishes foranything which comes by an intermediary, for that is the proper state of being of the Seraphim;there is no intermediary between their love and God’s love. Love is constantly made new inthem without any intermediaries, and so too in this soul, for she does not seek for knowledgeof God among the teachers of this world, but by truly despising this world and herself. Ah,God, how great is the difference between the gift that a lover makes to his loved one through anintermediary, and the gift made directly to his loved one by a lover!Love.This book which says that this Soul has six wings, just as the Seraphim, has indeedspoken truly of her. With two wings she hides her face from Jesus Christ our Lord. That is to saythat the more that she knows nothing of it, compared with one single spark of his goodness, forEnglish Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M. Van Woerkom (Version 1.0 - LATEX 2ε)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8God is not comprehended except by himself alone.With the next two wings she covers her feet. That is so say that the more she knows of whatJesus Christ suffered for us, the more perfectly she knows that she knows nothing of it, comparedwith what he did suffer for us, for he is not known except by himself alone.With the other two wings the Soul flies, and in the air she both hovers and takes her rest. Thatis to say that the wings with which she flies are all that she knows and loves and praises of God’sgoodness; and she hovers for she is always in God’s sight; and she is at rest, for she dwells alwaysin the divine will.Ah, what and how would such a Soul fear? Indeed there is nothing which she could or shouldfear or be frightened of, since even if she is in the world, and it was possible that the world, theflesh and the devil, the four elements, the birds of the air and the wild beasts might despise andtorment her or tear her to shreds, still she can lose nothing if God remains with her. For he is all,everywhere, all powerful, all wisdom, all goodness. He is our father, our brother, and our truelover. He is without ending, three Presons, and one only God; and this is he, says this Soul, whois the lover of our souls.Chapter 6. How the Soul, in love with God, living in the peaceof charity, takes leave of the virtuesLove.This Soul, loving thus, says Love herself, can say to the Virtues that for long, and for manya day, she has been in their bondage.The Soul.I confess to you, Lady Love, says this soul, that there was a time when I was sobound, but now that time has changed: your graciousness has set me free of their bondage. Andtherefore I can well say to them and sing:Virtues, I take my leave of you for evermore,And so my heart will have more joy and be more free;Your service is a lifelong yoke as well I see.Once I set all my heart on you with never no or nay;You know that I was pledged to you, to me it seemd for aye.There was a time I was your serf but now I break away.All of my heart was set on you, the truth is clear to me.There was a time when all my life seemed nought but misery,Suffering so many cruel pains, so many torments, welaway,That it is marvel I escaped alive for in such servitude I lay.But so it is, I have no cares, your ransom now I pay,And the great Lord above I thank that I might see this day.Now I have left your bondage, I have paid you my last fee:I never knew till free of you that there could be such liberty.Your bondage I have left, and now I am at peace, and peaceful I shall be.Chapter 7. Of how this Soul is noble, and how she takes heedof nothingLove.This Soul, says Love, takes no heed of shame or honor, of poverty or of riches, of comfortor of hardship, of love or of hate, of Hell or of Paradise.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

How Reason is astounded that this Soul has abandoned the Virtues, andhow Love praises them9Reason.For God’s sake, Love, says Reason, what is the meaning of what you say?Love.What does it mean? says Love. The one to whom God has given understanding of itknows that, and no-one else, for no book contains it, nor can man’s intelligence comprehend it,nor can any creature’s laboring be rewarded by understanding or comprehending it. Rather this isa gift given by the Most High, into whom this creature is ravished through fulness of knowledge,and in her understanding she remains nothing. And such a Soul, having become nothing, at oncehas everything and has nothing, wishes for everything and wishes for nothing, knows everythingand knows nothing.Reason.And how is it possible, Lady Love, says Reason, that this Sould can wish for whatthis book says, when it has already said before that she has no will at all?Love.Reason, says Love, it is not at all her will which wishes this, but rather it is the will ofGod which wishes it in her; for this Soul does not dwell in Love, for Love would make her wishfor this through any longing; rather it is Love who dwells in her, who has taken her will from her,and so Love works her own will in the Soul, and Love performs her works in her without herhelp, ass a result of which no anxiety can remain in her.This Soul, says Love, is no longer able to speak of God, for she has been brought to nothingin all her external longings and inward feelings and all affections of the spirit, so that whateverthis Soul does she does because it is some accustomed and commendable practice, or becauseHoly Church commands it, but not through any longing of her own, for the will which promptedlonging in her is dead.Chapter 8. How Reason is astounded that this Soul has aban-doned the Virtues, and how Love praises themReason.Ah Love, says Reason, who understands only the obvious and fails to grasp what issubtle, what strange thing is this? This Soul experiences no grace, she feels no longing of thespirit, since she has taken leave of the Virtues, which give to every pious soul a form of good life,and without these Virtues no-one can be saved or attain to perfect living, and with them no-onecan be deceived; and none the less this Soul takes leave of them. Is she not out of her mind, thisSoul who talks like that?Love.No, not at all, says Love, for souls such as she possess the Virtues better than any othercreature, but they do not make use of them, for they are not in their service as they once were;and too, they have now served them long enough, so that henceforth they may become free.Reason.And when, Love, says Reason, did they serve them?Love.When they remained bound in love and obedience to you, Lady Reason, and also to theother Virtues; and they have stayed in that service so long that now they have become free.Reason.And when did such souls become free? says Reason.Love.Once Love dwellls in them, and the Virtues serve them with no demur and with noeffort from such souls.Love.Ah, truly, Reason, says Love, such souls who have become so free have known forlong the bondage which Lordship is wont to exact. If anyone were to ask them what is thegreatest torment which any creature can suffer, they would say that it is to dwell in Love, andyet be subject to the Virtues. For one must yield everything they ask to the virtues, at whatevercost to Nature. And so it is that the Virtues ask honor and possession, heart and body and life.That is that such souls should give up everything, and still the Virtues say to this Soul, whichhas given all this to them and has held back nothing with which to comfort Nature, that onlywith great suffering is the just man saved. And therefore this wretched Soul, still subject tothe Virtues, says that she would be willing to be hounded by Dread and suffer torment in Helluntil the day of judgement, if after that she was to be saved. And it is true, says Love, thatthe Soul over whom the virtues have power lives in such subjection. But the souls of whomEnglish Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

How such Souls have no will at allLove.If anyone were to ask such souls, untroubled and at peace, if they would want to be inPurgatory, they would answer No: if they would want here in this life to be assured of theirsalvation, they would answer No: if they would want to be in Paradise, they would anser No.Why would they wish for such things? They have no will at all; and if they wished for anything,they would separate themselves from Love; for he who has their will knows what is good forthem, without their knowing or being assured of it. Such Souls live by knowing and lovingand praising; that is the settled practice of such Souls, without any impulse of their own, forKnowledge and Love and Praise dwell within them. Such Souls cannot assess whether they aregood or bad, and they have no knowledge of themselves, and would be unable to judge whetherthey are converted or perverted.Love.Or, to speak more briefly, let us take one Sould to represent them all, says Love. ThisSoul neither longs for nor despises poverty or tribulation, Mass or sermon, fasting or prayer;and gives to Nature all that it requires, with no qualm of conscience; but this Nature is so wellordered through having been transformed in the union with Love, to whom this Soul’s will isjoined, that it never asks anything which is forbidden. Such a Soul is not concerned about whatit lacks, except at the needful time; and none but the innocent can be without this concern.Reason.For God’s sake. what does this mean?Love.I tell you in reply, Reason, says Love, as I have told you before, and yet again I tellyou that every teacher of natural wisdom, every teacher of book-learning, everyone who persistsin loving his obedience to the Virtues does not and will not understand this as it should beunderstood. Be sure of this, Reason, says Love, for only those understand it who should seekafter perfect Love. But if by chance one found such Souls, they would tell the truth if they wantedto; yet I do not think that anyone could understand them, except only him who seeks after PerfectLove and Charity.Sometimes, says Love, this gift is given in the twinkling of an eye; and let him who is givenit hold fast to it, for it is the most perfect gift which God gives to a creature. This Soul is learningin the school of Divine Knowledge, and is seated in the valley of Humility, and upon the plain ofTruth, and is at rest upon the mountain of Love.Chapter 10. How Love names this Soul by 12 names for actives,at the request of ReasonReason.Ah Love, says Reason, name this Soul by her rightful name, and let actives haveknowledge of her.Love.She can be called, says Love, by twelve names, which are:The Very Wonderful:The Unknown:The Most Innocent of the Daughters of Jerusalem:She upon whom all Holy Church is founded:The Enlightened by Knowledge:English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

How at the request of Reason Love gives knowl-edge of this Soul to contemplatives by making nine points clearwhich have already been mentionedReason.Now Love, says Reason, I ask you, for the sake of contemplatives, who always longto grow in divine knowledge, and who live and dwell in longing for Love, that you in yourgraciousness explain the nine points of which you have spoken previously, which nine points arepossessed by the Soul who seeks for Perfect Love, in whom Charity dwells and rests through alife brought to nothing into which Perfect Love has delivered her.Reason.The first point, says Reason to Love, of which you spoke is that one cannot find sucha Soul.Love.It is true, says Love. It means that this Soul knows in herself only one thing, and thatis the root of all evils and the abundance of all sins, which cannot be numbered, be weighed, bemeasured. And sin is nothing, and this Soul is so completely overwhelmed and terrified by herhorrible faults, which are less than nothing; and so, interpreted in this way, this Soul, in as muchas she is, is less than nothing, and so we can conclude that one cannot find this Soul, for such aSoul is so brought to nothing by humility that no creature which ever sinned deserves so greattorment, such great unending confusion as does she in her own true judgement, if it were so thatGod wanted to take vengeance for only one thousandth part of one of her faults. Such humility,and only such, is true and perfect humility in a soul brought to nothing and in no-one else.Love.The second point is that this Soul is saved by faith without works.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, what does this mean?Love.It means, says Love, that such a Soul brought to nothing has such great inwardknowledge through the virtue of Faith, and is so occupied in maintaining in herself what Faithgives to her of the might of the Father, of the wisdom of the Son, and of the goodness of the HolySpirit, that no created thing can remain in her recollection, but passes quickly away, because theunderstanding of this Soul brought to Nothing is beset and occupied with other matters. ThisSoul is no longer capable of works, and undoubtedly she is well excused and discharged, forbelieving without works that God is good and incomprehensible. Such a one is saved by faithwithout works, for faith suspasses every work, as Love itself testifies.Love.The third point is that she is alone in Love.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

Such a Soulbegs or asks nothing from any creature. She is the solitary phoenix, for this Soul is alone in Love,and satisfies herself with herself.Love.The fourth point is that this Soul does nothing for God.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, what does this mean?Love.It means, says Love, that her works are of no concern to God, and that thos Soul is onlyconcerned with that with which God is concerned. She cares nothing for herself: let God care forher, who loves her more than the Soul loves herself. This Soul has such great faith in God thatshe has no fear of being poor, so long as he whom she loves be rich. For Faith teaches her thatwhat she hopes God to be she will find him to be, and through faith she hopes that he is rich inall things, and so she cannot be poor.Love.The fifth point is that this Soul does not refrain from doing anything for God which shecan do.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, what does this mean?Love.It means, says Love, that she can do nothing but the will of God, nor can she willanything else; and because of this she does not refrain from doing anything for God, for sheallows nothing to enter her mind which is against God, and so she does not refrain from doinganything for God.Love.The sixth point is that one can teach her nothing.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, what does this mean?Love.This means that this Soul is so very constant that, though she had the knowledge ofevery creature which ever was and which is and which will be, all that would see nothing to herin comparison with that which she loves, which never was known and never will be known. Sheloves more that which is in God, which was never given, than she loves what she has and whatshe would have, if it were that she might have all the knowledge that all creature will have whichare and which will be.The Soul.And still this is nothing, says that Soul, in comparison with what is in God, but ofthat no-one can say anything.Love.The seventh point is that one can take nothing away from her.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, what does this mean?Love.What does this mean? says Love. What could one take away from her? If anyone wasto take away from this Soul honors, riches and friends, heart and body and life, still he wouldtake nothing away from her, if God remains with her; and by this it is plainly seen that no-onecan take anything away from her, however powerful he may be.Love.The eighth point is that one can give nothing to her.Reason.Love, for God’s sake, Reason says, what does this mean, that one can give nothing toher?Love.What does this mean? says Love. What could one give her? If anyone gave to hereverything that was ever given and ever will be given, still that would be nothing in comparisonwith what she loves and will love, if it were not God himself.And the Soul says:It is Lady Love who loves in me, and will so loveLove.With all respect, says Love, I am not such a one. We shall says, says Love, for thosewho hear, that God loves better the more of this Sould that is in him than the less of her which isherself.But this Soul says:There is no ’less’, there is nothing but ’all’: this I can well say, and I saythe truth.Love.I say further, says Love, that if this Soul had all the knowledge and the love and thepraise which ever were given and will be given of the divine Trinity, this would be nothingin comparison with what she loves and will love; nor will she ever attain to this love throughknowledge.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

The true meaning of what this book says in many places, that the Soulbrought to Nothing has no will at all.13The Soul speaks to Love.Ah, truly, no, sweet Love, says the Soul. I shall not attain the leastpoint of it, without help of what surpasses it. For there is no God, other than he of whom onecan know nothing perfectly; and he alone is my God of whom one cannot say a word, nor canall those in Paradise attain to one single point, for all the knowledge that they have of him. Andin this more, says this Soul, is enclosed the supreme mortification of my spirit’s love, and that isthe whole glory of my soul’s love, and will be forever, and of all who were ever intent upon sucha course. This is a little thing to hear, says this Soul, in comparison of the great matter of whichno-one speaks. But I wish to speak of it, and I do not know what to say. But none the less, LadyLove, she says, my love is of such a mind that I had rather hear what is not true of you than thatpeople should say nothing about you. And that without doubt is what I do. I say of you what isnot true, for everything which I say of you is nothing but untruth about your goodness. But youmust pardon what I say which is not true of you. For, Lord, the Soul says, anyone who alwaysspeaks of you and yet never says anything of your goodness says indeed what is not true aboutyou; and what I say is true about me. I never cease to speak of you, either asking questions, ormeditating, or listening if someone would tell me something of your goodness; but the more Ihear tell of you the more I am bewildered. It would be a great wrong if I were to be persuadedthat they could tell me anything of you, for they are mistaken, believing that they can speak so,for I know for certain that no-one can say anything of you, and, please God, I shall never bedeceived, and I never wish to hear lies about your divine goodness, but only to finish what Ihave undertaken in this book, of which Love is the instructress, and she has told me that I shallbring to an end in it all my undertakings. For so long as I ask for anything of my own initiativefrom Love for her own sake, I shall be by myself in the life of the spirit, in the shadow of the sun,where the subtle imaginings about how we are drawn by divine love, and about how the divinebegetting can be seen. And what is this I say? says this Soul. Truly it is still nothing even if I hadall that has been told, in comparison with what I love in him, which he will not give to anyone,but only to himself, since it is fitting to reserve that for himself, according to his divine justice.And so I say, and what I say is true, that no-one can give me anything, whatever that thing mightbe. This lament that you hear me making, Lady Reason, says this Soul, is all that I can do, and itis the best that I can do, when properly understood. Ah, how sweet this understanding is! ForGod’s sake, understand this fully, for Paradise is nothing else but to understand this very thing.Love.The ninth point, Lady Reason, says Love, is that this Soul has no will at all.Reason.Ah, for the love of the God of love, says Reason, what are you saying? Are yousaying that this Soul has no will at all?Love.Ah, truly, no. For everything which she wills by her consent is that which God willsthat she should will, and this she wills so that the will of God may be accomplished, not at all herown will; and she cannot will this of herself, but it is the will of God which wills it in her; and soit is clear that this Soul has no will at all that she has to will.Chapter 12. The true meaning of what this book says in manyplaces, that the Soul brought to Nothing has no will at all.Love.Now hear and understand well, you who listen to this book, the true meaning of what itsays in so many places, that the Soul brought to Nothing has no will at all, and cannot want tohave any at all, and in this the divine will is perfectly accomplished, and the Soul does not haveits fill of divine Love, nor does divine Love have its fill of the Soul, until the Soul is in God andGod is in the Soul, and when the Soul is in such a state of divine rest, from God and throughGod, then she has all her fill.Reason’s Understanding.Granted, says Reason’s Understanding, but it seems that the ninthpoint says exactly the opposite, for it says that the Soul brought to Nothing wants for nothing toEnglish Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

You take the straw and leave the grain, because your understanding istoo base, and so you cannot exercise the exalted understanding that he must apply who trulywants to understand the state of being of which we speak. But Understanding of Divine Love,who dwells and is in the Soul brought to Nothing and set free, she understands this at once, forshe is this very thing.Exalted Understanding of Love.Now, Reason’s Understanding, says Exalted Understandingof Love, now see how crude is your misunderstanding. If this Soul brought to Nothing wishes tohave God’s will – and the more one wishes for it the more one would want to wish for it – shecannot, have it, because she is only a puny creature; for God preserves to himself the greatnessof his divine justice. But God wills that she should wish for this, and that she should have sucha will, and such a will is the divine will, an this will gives their being to free creatures; and itis this divine will, which God makes them wish for, which draws into them the veins of divineknowledge and the heart of divine love and the union of divine praise. But if this Soul itself willsanything, that impedes this.Love.Then, says Love, how can the Soul have any will, since Illumined Knowledge knowsthat there is one state which among all the states of being is the most noble, which no creaturecan have unless she can have it through wishing for nothing? Now Reason has heard, says Love,the answer to her questions, except to that where she said that the Soul set Free has in her a lackof what would fill her. It is from wishing for the divine will, for the more that anyone wishes forthis, the less he has his fill of such a will. But this self same wishing is God’s only will and theglory of the Soul.Chapter 13.

Reason, says and explain for the benefit of those onwhose behalf you ask so humbly, and also for those who hear this book, which we shall callTheMirror of the Simple Souls who dwell in wishing and in longing?Reason.To this I reply, Lady Love, says Reason, that this book says astonishing things aboutEnglish Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

It says in the seventh chapter that this Soul takes no heed of shame or of honor, ofpoverty or of riches, of ease or of hardship, of love or of hate, of Hell or of Paradise. Andin addition it says that this Soul has everything and has nothing, she knows everything andknows nothing, she wishes for everything and wishes for nothing, as it says above in the ninthchapter: and so she longs for nothing, says Reason, not contempt or poverty, not martyrdomor tribulations, not Masses or sermons, not fastings or prayers, and so she yields to Nature allthat Nature asks with no qualms of conscience. And, indeed, Love, says Reason, no-one whounderstands as I do could understand this unless they learn it from you by your instruction; formy understanding and my intelligence and all my advice, as well as I can advise, all tell me thatone should long for contempt, poverty, and every kind of tribulation, and Masses and sermonsand fastings and prayers, and that one should fear all kinds of love, whatever they may be,because of the dangers which may be in them, and that one should long above all for Paradiseand fear Hell, and that one should refuse every kind of honor and temporal goods, and everyease, denying Nature what it asks, except only that without which it could not exist, followingthe example of the sufferings and Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. That is the best, says Reason,which I can say and advise to all those who live in my obedience. And therefore I say to allthat no-one who understands as I do will understand this book unless he understands it by thestrength of Faith and the power of Love, who are my mistresses, for I obey them in all things.And then too, says Reason, I want to say this: that whoever has these two strings to his bow, thatis the light of Faith and the power of Love, he has permission to do whatever pleases him, andthe witness of this is Love herself who says to the Soul: Beloved, love, and do what you will.Love.Reason, says Love, you are very wise, and very certain of what is your concern; andyou wish for an answer to the words which have been said before. And since you have asked meto tell you what they mean, I shall reply to all your questions. It is well asked, says Love, andI shall satisfy all your prayers and questions. I assure you, Reason, says Love, that these Soulswho are guided by Perfect Love value shame as highly as honor, and honor as dearly as shame,poverty as highly as riches, and riches as dearly as poverty, suffering at the hands of God andhis creatures as highly as consolation from God and his creatures, being loved as highly as beinghated, being hated as dearly as being loved, being in Hell as highly as being in Paradise, andbeing in Paradise as dearly as being in Hell, lowly estate as highly as great, and great estate asdearly as lowly, whether it be for soul or for body. And Truth knows this well, and knows toothat they neither wish or do not wish to have any such prosperity or adversity, for such Soulshave no will at all except what God wills in them, and the divine will does not trouble theseexalted creatures with such burdens, as we have explained.Love.Already, says Love, I have said that such Souls value every affliction of their heart– both for body and for soul – as highly as if it were prosperity, and prosperity as highly asadversity. And this is true, says Love, if such things came to them as highly as adversity. Andthis is true, says Love, if such things came to them without their will being the cause; and alsosuch Souls do not know what is better for them, nor how God wants to provide their salvationnor the salvation of their neighbors, nor for what reason God wants to show justice or mercy,nor for what reason God wants to give to the Soul the exalted gifts of the goodness of his divinenobility. And therefore the Soul set Free has no will at all to will or not to will, except only to willthe will of God, and to submit in peace to the divine command.Reason.Lady Love, I ask yet one more question: why does this book say that this Soul haseverything and yet has nothing?Love.That is true, says Love, for through divine grace this Soul has God, and he who hasGod has everything, and it says too that she has nothing, because everything which this Soulhas within her from God through the gift of divine grace seems nothing to her, and it is nothing,too, in comparison with what she loves, which is in God and which he will not give to anyoneexcept only to himself And it is in this sense that this Soul has everything and yet has nothing,she knows everything and yet she knows nothing.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

How this Soul has knowledge of God throughfaith.Love.She knows, says Love, through the power of faith that God is allpowerful and all wisdomand perfect goodness, and that God the Father performed the work of the Incarnation, and theSon also and the Holy Spirit also, so that God the Father joined human nature to the personof God the Son, and the person of God the Son joined it to his own person, and God theHoly Spirit joined it to the person of God the Son. So that the Father has in him one singlenature, which is a divine nature, and that the person of the Son has in him three natures, thatis, the same divine nature as the Father has, and the nature of his own soul, and the natureof his body, and he is one person in the Trinity; and the Holy Spirit has in him this samedivine nature as the Father and the Son have. To believe this, to say this, to ponder this is truecontemplation: one power, one knowledge and one will, one single God in three persons, threepersons in one single God. This God is ever where in his divine nature; but his humanity is glo-rified in Paradise, joined to the person of the Son, and otherwise only in the sacrament of the altar.Chapter 15. This speaks of the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.Love.Christians receive this divinity and this humanity when they take the blessed sacrament ofthe altar. How long this humanity dwells in them, Faith teaches and scholars know.Light of Faith.And so we shall tell you, says Light of Faith, to what we can liken thissacrament, the better to understand it. Take this sacrament, put it into a mortar with othersubstances, and pound it until you can no longer see or perceive the person which you placedthere.Faith.I tell you truly, says Faith, that it is no longer there. So you can now ask: Has ittherefore gone away?Truth.Not at all, says Truth. It was there, but now it is not. Understand this properly, and notin any human sense. Now you can ask if the person has gone away, just as it once came. I tellyou, says Truth, that the humanity of Jesus Christ does not come and go.Temptation.Then what can this be? says Temptation.Truth.He was there, says Truth, when one could see and perceive him, and now he is notthere, for one cannot see or perceive him; and it is so that divine omnipotence has ordainedit. Nor is this very same humanity, which is in the sacrament of the altar, seen in any othersemblance: the angels and the saints and the Virgin Mary do not see him otherwise than weourselves see him, and if they see him in the semblance in which we see him, it is throughspiritual understanding, for to see the humanity of Jesus Christ glorified in the sacrament of thealtar does not belong to the glory of those who are in glory. And so they do not see him glorifiedexcept through understanding.The Soul of Faith.And we see him through the power of faith, giving the lie to what oursenses tell us, which only see bread there, and which do not perceive or taste or smell anythingelse. But our faith contradicts them all, for faith believes firmly, without doubting, that here is nowhiteness or smell or taste, but the precious body of Jesus Christ, who is true God and true man.And so we see him there through faith, but those who are in glory do not see him as we do.

Here Love replies to Reason about what she hassaid, that the Soul knows everything and knows nothing.Love.Reason, says Love, as to what I have said, that the Soul set Free knows everything and yetknows nothing, I tell you that she knows through the power of faith what is needful for her toknow for her salvation; and so she knows nothing of what God has in her of himself for her, whowill make such gifts to no-one but to her. And so it is in this sense that this Soul knows everythingand yet knows nothing. She wishes for everything, says Love, and yet she wishes for nothing;for this Soul, says Love, wills so perfectly the will of God that in her will she knows nothing, shecan do nothing, she wills nothing but God’s will, so securely has Love imprisoned her. And yetshe wishes for nothing, for what she wishes and what God wishes in her is so small a thing, incomparison with what she would want to wish, that she cannot have that which God wants herto wish. For her will is nothing in comparison with what would fill her, which because of this,never will be given to her, and it is by the will of God that she wishes it so, as has been said before.And so it is in this sense that this Soul wishes for everything and yet wishes for nothing.Love.This daughter of Sionl does not long for Masses or sermons, or fastings or prayers.Reason.And why Lady Love? says Reason. These are the food of holy souls.Love.That is true, says Love, for those who beg; but this Soul begs for nothing, for she hasno need to long for anything which is outside her. Now listen, Reason, says Love. Why shouldthis Soul long for those things which I have just named, since God is everywhere, just as muchwithout them as with them? This Soul has no thought, no word, no work, except for employingthe grace of the divine Trinity. This Soul feels no disquiet for any sins which she once committed,nor for the suffering which God underwent for her, nor for the sins and the troubles in which herneighbors live.Reason.Oh God, what does this mean, Love? says Reason. Teach me to understand this, sinceyou have reassured me about my other questions.Love.It means, says Love, that this Soul is not her own, and so she can feel no disquiet; forher thought is at rest in a place of peace, that is in the Trinity, and therefore she cannot move fromthere, nor feel disquiet, so long as her beloved is untroubled. But that anyone falls into sin, orthat sin was ever committed, Love relies to Reason, this is displeasing to her will just as it is toGod: for it is his own displeasure which gives such displeasure to this Soul. But none the less,says Love, in spite of such displeasure there is no disquiet in the Trinity, nor is there in such aSoul who is at rest within the Trinity. But if this Soul, who is in such exalted rest, could help herneighbors, she would help them in their need with all her might. But the thoughts of such Soulsare so divine that they do not dwell upon past or created things, so as to apprehend disquiet inthemselves, for God is good beyond all comprehending.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

Here Love replies to Reason concerning what shehas said, that these Souls give to Nature what it asks.Love.This Soul gives to Nature whatever she asks of her; and it is true, says Love, that thisSoul does not have so much care or love for temporal things that she could profit by refusingwhat Nature asks; rather she would be troubled by robbing Nature of what is her own. But suchcreatures are so excellent that one dares not openly talk of this, especially of their customs, whichgive them a state of being where they understand as should be understood; but there are fewwho taste such understanding.Love.I have said before, says Love, that one dares never openly speak of them. Truly not, forother creatures understand in so crude a way that they would misunderstand, and to their harm.Souls who are such as this book speaks of, telling a little of their customs, by right of their stateof being, which is pure and divine, have themselves such a condition that if they had nothingand were sure that they were to live until the Day of Judgment, still they could not be troubledat heart for a single moment about anything they lacked, not for all the gold in the world, exceptonly for the times when Nature has need of what it does not have, so that they can give Naturewhat is its own. And if Souls such as these – few men know where they are, but it is fitting tothe just goodness of Love, that there should be such Souls, to uphold the faith of Holy Church– if they had anything and knew that others had greater need of it than they, such Souls wouldnever hold it back, not even if they were certain that bread and wheat and other food were neverto grow on earth again. And this is true, says Love, let no-one doubt it. Such is the nature of thisSoul, and it is so through perfect justice, and such justice is divine justice, which has imparted itsallotted portion to this Soul.Divine Justice.This is right and proper, says Divine Justice. It is fitting that all justice shouldbe accomplished in her. If she withheld from her neighbors what they need, she would withholdwhat is not her own, according to the perfection of the peace of charity, on whichshe lives in allthings, for it is that which is her proper food. Furthermore, why should such Souls have scruplesabout taking what they need when necessity asks it of them? That would entail for such Souls aloss of innocence, the peace in which this Soul has rest from all things. Who should have scruplesabout taking what he needs of the four elements, of the brightness of heaven, of the heat of fire,of the moisture of water and of the earth which supports us? We take the service of these fourelements in every way that Nature needs, and Reason does not condemn it; these bounteouselements are made by God, as are other things, and so such souls use all things made and createdof which Nature has need in as much peace of heart as when they use the ground on which theywalk.Love.Their foundation is firm says Love, their building is high, and in it they have rest fromall things.Chapter 18. How such creatures do not know how to say any-thing about God.The Soul.Such creatures can no longer say anything about God, for they can no more say whoGod is than where he is. For whoever speaks of God, when and to whom and where he pleases,must never doubt but must know beyond doubt, says this Soul, that he never once tasted thereal kernel of divine Love, which in all men, truly, once tasted, robs the Soul forever of her senseswithout her knowing it. For this is the true and pure kernel of divine Love, in which there is nocreated matter, and it is given to the crea- ture by the Creator; and it is the custom of such Soulsto comprehend much and to forget it quickly, so subtle in his dealings is he who loves them.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

Who are they, and where are they, and what do they do?Reveal them to us by Love, who knows everything, and so they will be set at rest who, hearingthis book, are dismayed. For all Holy Church, if she were to hear it read, would be dismayed byit, say these three divine virtues.Faith.That is true, says Faith herself.Love.Truly, this is Holy Church the Less, says Love, who is ruled by Reason, and not HolyChurch the Great, says Divine Love, who is ruled by us.Love.Now tell me, says Love to the three divine virtues, why do you ask us who these Soulsare, and where they are, and what they do? Truly, if you do not know this, says Love, nothingwhich God has created would be able to find them. All three of you know where they are, foryou are with them at every moment of time, for it is you three who ennoble them. And what theydo you also know. But who they are – to speak of their worth and dig- nity – neither you nor theyknow that, and so Holy Church cannot know it.Reason.Then who in God’s name knows it? says Reason.Love.That God alone knows, says Love, who has created and redeemed them, and, it maybe, re-created them again and again, for whose love alone IL they live in exile, brought to nothingand forgotten. How, says Love, can Holy Church be astonished if the Virtues serve these exaltedand celestial Souls? Why should they not? Are not all the Virtues praised and written about andcommended because of these Souls, not the Souls because of the Virtues? Thus such Virtues aremade so as to serve such Souls, and such Souls are made so as to obey God, and to receive theunique gifts of the pure graciousness of his divine nobility, which gifts God gives to no creaturewho dwells in longing and willing. But let no-one who wants to have these gifts keep companywith longing or will, for so he will never have them.Love.And why should Holy Church, says Love, know these queens, these king’s daughters,king’s sisters, king’s brides? Holy Church could not know them truly unless Holy Church werewithin their souls. And no created thing enters into their souls but God alone, who created thesouls. So that no-one knows such Souls except God, who is within them.Chapter 20.Love replies to Reason about what she has said, thatno-one knows such Souls except God.Reason.Ah, Love, says Reason, do not be displeased that I must ask yet another question; and ifyou do not answer me I shall be confused.Love.Well, says Love to Reason, say what your question is.Reason.I shall tell you, says Reason. This book says that no-one knows these Souls exceptGod, who is within such Souls. And yet earlier it has said that no-one can find them or knowthem except him or her who seeks Perfect Love; but if anyone were to find such Souls, theywould tell the truth, and this is what this book has said already; from which it seems that thosewho are such, whether they once were so or are now so, know those that are the same.Love.It is true, says Love, for those that are such, whether they were so or are so, wouldknow their fellows by their customs, but even more through the power of the gift which is givento them, which is unique. Reason. Unique, says Reason – indeed it is unique, for I feel singularlyamazed when I hear of it.Love.Reason, says Love, one and the same word has two meanings, for if those who are suchhave knowledge of the customs of such Souls, and if this is the most perfect state of being whichEnglish Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

Love replies to Reason’s objection, because thisbook says that such Souls take leave of the Virtues.Reason.Now, Love, says Reason, I have still another question to put to you; for this book saysthat this Soul takes leave of the Virtues in all matters, and you say that the Virtues are alwayswith such Souls, more perfectly than with anyone else. These are two contradictory statements,it seems to me, says Reason; I cannot understand them.Love.I shall set your mind at rest, says Love. It is true that this Soul has taken leave ofthe Virtues, in that she does not use them, and does not long for what they require, but theVirtues have not taken leave of such Souls, for they are always with them, but they are in perfectobedience to such Souls. It is in this sense that this Soul takes leave of them, and that yet theyare always with them. For if a man serves a master, he belongs to him whom he serves, but hismaster does not belong to him; and it can sometimes happen that this servant earns and learnsso much from his master that he becomes richer and wiser than his master, so that this servantleaves his master to find someone better; and when he who was his master sees for certain thathis former serving-man is worth more and knows more than he does himself, he goes to dwellwith him, to obey him in all things. You can and must understand that it is just so with the Virtuesand such Souls; because at the beginning this Soul did everything which Reason indicated to her,whatever it cost her in heart and body, when Reason was her mistress, and Reason always saidto her that she should do everything which the Virtues wished without demur, though it cost herher life. So Reason and the other Virtues were the mistresses of this Soul, and this Soul was trulyobedient in all that they wished to command, because she wanted to live the life of the spirit. Butnow it has come about that this Soul has earned and learned so much from the Virtues that she isabove them, for she has within her every- thing which the Virtues are able to teach, and infinitelymore, for this Soul has within her the mistress of the Virtues who is called Divine Love, who haswholly changed the Soul into herself and united her to herself, so that this Soul no more belongsto herself or to the Virtues.Reason.To whom, then, does she belong? says Reason.Love.To my will, says Love, who have changed her into me.Reason.And who are you, Love? says Reason. Are you not also one of the Virtues, and oneof us, even though you be above us?Love.I am God, says Love, for Love is God, and God is Love, and this Soul is God throughits condition of Love, and I am God through my divine nature, and this Soul is God by Love’sjust law. So that this my precious beloved is taught and guided by me, without herself for shehas been changed into me. And this is the outcome, says Love, of being nourished by me.Chapter 22. How this Soul is compared with the eagle, and howshe takes leave of Nature.Love.So this Soul is compared with the eagle, because she flies high, and extremely high, highereven than any other bird, for Perfect Love has given her wings.

She is common toall by the generosity of pure charity, and yet she takes nothing from anyone because of noblegraciousness, of pure goodness, with which God has filled her. At all times she is composedwithout gloom, joyful without wantonness, for God has sanctified his name in her, and the divineTrinity has in her its dwelling place. You little ones, who in wishing and in longing snare the preyon which you feed, yearn to be like these, for anyone who can long for the less and not the moreis not worthy that God should give him the least of his good things, because of the faint-heartedtimidity into which he allows himself to slip, and so he finds that he is always hungry.Chapter 23. How this Soul has two crutches, and how she isdrunk with what she never drinks.Love.This Soul set Free, says Love, supports herself upon two crutches, one on the right andthe other on the left. With these two crutches the Soul stands firm against her enemies, like acastle built upon a rock rising out of the sea which cannot be undermined. One of these crutches,which keeps the Soul firm against her enemies and which guards the gifts of her wealth, is thetrue knowledge that she has of her own poverty. The left-hand crutch upon which she supportsherself at all times is strength. And the right-hand crutch is the exalted knowledge which theSoul receives from the pure Deity. On these two crutches is the Soul supported, and so she needpay no heed to her enemies to the right or to the left. Yet still she is so filled with confusion, saysLove, at the knowledge of her poverty that she seems all confusion to the world and to herself.Indeed, she is so drunka with knowledge of the love and the grace of the pure Deity that sheis always drunk with knowledge and filled with praise of Divine Love. And she is not drunksimply with what she has drunk, but extremely drunk and more than drunk with what she neveronce drank and never will drink.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, Love, says Reason, what does this mean, that this Soul is drunkwith what she never once drank and never will drink? It seems, says Reason, from what I canunderstand of these words, that the Soul becomes more deeply drunk upon what her loved onedrinks and has drunk and will drink of the divine drink of his own goodness, than upon whatshe herself has drunk and will drink of the divine drink in this same cask.Love.That is quite right, says Love; it is this more that makes her drunk, not because she hasdrunk of this more, as has been said, though indeed she has, because her loved one has drunk ofit, for through the transformation of love there is no difference between him and her, whatevertheir differences of nature be. Love of its own right causes this transformation into itself Lovewho has made her drunk with the more of its drink, nor will it ever be otherwise. Sometimesit does happen that there are several spigots in one cask, but the wine that is clearest, newest,best, sweetest and most intoxicating is the wine drawn from the topmost spigot. This is the drinkabove all drinks, of which no-one drinks except the Trinity. And by this drink the Soul broughtto Nothing, the Soul set Free, the Soul Forgotten is made drunk, without ever rinking of it, butextremely drunk, but more than drunk, and by that which she never drank and neverwill drink.Now listen to a plainer explanation, and understand it. In this cask of the divine drink there arecertainly several spigots. This is known to the humanity which is joined to the person of the Sonof God, who, after the Trinity, drinks from the finest spigot; next, the Virgin Mary drinks from it,and this most noble lady is drunk with the drink from the highest spigot. And after her theredrink the burning Seraphim, upon whose wings these Free Souls fly.Holy Church.Ah, God, says Holy Church, how purely we should love, how zealously weEnglish Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

When such Souls are in the true freedom of PureLove.Reason.Ah, Love, says Reason, when are such Souls in the true freedom of Pure Love?Love.When they have no longing, no feeling, and at no time any affection of the spirit; forsuch customs would enslave them, being too far away from the peace of freedom in which fewmen permit themselves to dwell. And also they do nothing, says Love, which is opposed to thepgace of their inner being, and so in peace they bear the orders of Love. Those who are suchas this are thus inwardly filled, for without begging outside themselves they have within themthe divine sun, and so they can preserve their purity of heart; and except them no others, saysLove, have any knowledge of the more. If these Souls had not such knowledge of it, they couldbeg for what is less, and so they could not have their fill. Such Souls are solitary in all thingsand common in all things, for they do not deprive their being of its freedom for anything whichmay happen to them. For just as the sun takes its brightness from God, and shines upon allthings without ever receiving from them any impurity, so such Souls have their being from Godand in God, without receiving into themselves any impurity, whatever they see or hear outsidethemselves.Chapter 25. Reason asks Love if such Souls feel any joys withinthem.Reason.Now tell me, Love, says Reason, do such Souls feel any joys, within or withoutthemselves?Love.No, says Love, to answer what you ask, for their nature is mortiiied and the spirit isdead in them. For all will has left them; and so such a soul lives and remains and is, only onaccount of such mortihcation in the divine will. Now listen, Reason, says Love, to understandbetter what you are asking about. A man who is on fire feels no cold, a man who is drowningknows no thirst. Now this Soul, says Love, is so burned in Love’s fiery furnace that she hasbecome very fire, so that she feels no fire, for in herself she is fire, through the power of Lovewhich has changed her into the fire of Love. This fire burns of and through itself, everywhere,incessantly, without consuming any matter or being able to wish to consume it, except onlyfrom itself; for whoever feels some perception of God through matter which he sees or hearsoutside himself, or through some labor which he there performs of himself is not all fire; rather,there is some matter, together, with the fire. For men’s labors, and their wanting matter outsidethemselves to make God’s love grow in them, is only a blinding of the knowledge of God’sgoodness. But he who burns with this fire without seeking such matter, without having it orwanting to have it, sees all things so clearly that he values them as they must be valued. Forsuch a Soul has no matter in her which revents her from seeing clearly, so that she is alone in ltthrough the power of true humility; and she is common to all through the generosity of perfectcharity, and alone in God, since Perfect Love has taken possession of her.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

How this Soul loves nothing except for the love ofGod.Love.Such a Soul no longer loves anything in God or will love it, however noble it may be,except only for God and because he wishes it, and she loves God in all things, and things forlove of him; and through such a love this Soul is alone in the pure love of the love of God. Sucha Soul has such a clear knowledge that she sees herself as nothing in God and God as nothingin herself Now listen, you sirs who love, to what follows, with Love’s meditation and not withyour creature’s ears; for such meditation, which the Soul gets from Love without wishing forany of Love’s gifts which are called consolations and which comfort the Soul through a feelingof sweetness in prayer, teaches this to the Soul, and no other custom does it teach her than purelove. For if anyone were to wish for God’s comforts through feelings of consolation, they wouldimpede Perfect Love from taking hold.Chapter 27. How Meditation of Pure Love has only one inten-tion.Love.Meditation of Pure Love has only one intention, that she might always love faithfullywithout wishing for any reward, and the Soul cannot do this unless she is deprived of herself, forFaithful Love would not deign to have any consolation which came by the Soul’s seeking. Trulynot. Meditation of Love knows well that it is for the bestl that she must not exert herself exceptin what is her task, and that is to will perfectly the will of God, and she leaves God to work andto order his will as he pleases; for whoever wills that God might fulfill his wish to experience hiscomforts does not place his trust solely in God’s goodness, but trusts rather in those gifts whichhe has to give out of his riches.The Soul.And without doubt, says this Soul, whoever was to love well would have nothought of receiving or asking, but would rather always wish to give, not withholding anything,so as to love faithfully; for if anyone were to have two intentions in the one, single work, the onewould lose its urgency for the sake of the other. And therefore Faithful Love has only one singleintention, and that is that she may always love faithfully, for she has no doubtg that her belovedin his love will do that which is best, so long as she does what she must do; and so she wishes fornothing but that the will of God be done in her beloved.Love.She is right, says Love, for that is everything, as she too has no power to wish foranything, for her will is not her own nor in herself, but it is rather in him who loves her, and thisis not his work, but it is rather the work of the whole Trinity, who work in this Soul according totheir will.Chapter 28. How this Soul swims in the sea of joy.Love.Such a Soul, says Love, swims in the sea of joy, that is in the sea of delights flowing andstreaming from the Divinity, and she feels no joy, for she herself is joy, and so she swims andflows in joy without feeling any joy, for she dwells in joy and joy dwells in her; for through thepower of joy she is herself joy, which has changed her into itself. Now they have one commonwill, like fire and flame, the will of the lover and that of the beloved, for love has changed thisSoul into itself.The Soul.Ah, sweetest, pure, divine Love, says this Soul, how sweet is this changingby which I am changed into the thing that I love better than I love myself!

It means that she should do nothing which isopposed to the perfect peace of her spirit. This is how the truly innocent do, says Love, and thestate of being of which we speak is true innocence. Reason, says Love, I will give you an example.See an infant which is purely innocent: does it do anything, does it refrain from doing anything,for the sake of the great or the small, if it does not please?Reason.Indeed, Love, no, that I can see well; and so now I know the answer to my question.Chapter 30. How Reason asks Love to satisfy this Soul by say-ing all that she could say or tell of God.Reason.Ah, Lady Love, says Reason, I beg and entreat you that you satisfy this Soul by tellingher at least all that one can say of him who is all in all things.Love.She knows that, says Love, for that is where she always finds him, that is, in all things;for one can only find a thing where it is, and because, everywhere, he is all, this Soul findshim everywhere. And therefore all things are opportune to her, for she does not find anythinganywhere without finding God there. Now, Reason, says Love, why do you want me to satisfythis Soul by saying all that one can say about God?Reason.So that she may rest peacefully, says Reason, in her state of innocence, withouthaving cause to move or bestir herself so as to hear you spoken of.Love.I shall gladly tell you, says Love. I assure you, says Love to Reason, and upon myselfI swear that everything which this Soul has heard about God, and everything which one cansay of him, is nothing – to speak properly – compared with that which is knowable, lovable andlaudable in him, which yet has never been said nor ever will be said – rather than anything.Love speaks to the Soul.But Love says still more to the Soul, to increase her joy and hersorrow, and to bring her satisfaction in all her undertakings: Lady Soul, says Love, I tell you oncefor all, to forestall your asking further of me, for you would waste your time, that all creatures,no-one excepted, who dwell and will dwell in the vision of the sweet face of your spouse, haveunderstood less and will understand less of him, compared with how it befits him to be knownand loved and praised, and with what he knows of himself less than one can truly say that onecan know or love or praise anything in him.The Soul.O, alas, Love, says this Soul, then what shall I do?

Are you not a creature?Do you want your beloved to give you what is not fitting for him to give to you or for you totake? Calm yourself, sweet Soul, if you will trust me; for he does not give to any creature otherthan what you have, and such gifts as are fitting for you.The Soul.Ah, Lady Love, says this Soul, you did not speak thus to me when I first knewyou. For you said to me that when lover and loved one are together, there is no mastery; but itseems to me that indeed there is, since one of them has everything, and the other has nothing incomparison with his everything; but if I could change this I would change it, for if I could do asmuch as you can do, I would love you as much as you deserve to be loved.Love.Ah, sweetest Soul, you cannot say more. Be at peace: your will is enough for yourbeloved. He makes this known to you through me, that you should trust in him, and that Ishould tell you that he will not love anything without you, nor yet you without him.This isindeed a great privilege. And if you believe me, sweet Soul, be content with this.The Soul.Ah, Lady Love, in God’s name, say no more of this, says this Soul, for indeed Icannot be silent about it to save the whole world, if it were to be saved thereby; for I love nothinggreater than that which suffices me, for if that which I love did not suffice me, I would slip or fallaway from that little love which I have. But even so, Lady Love, says the Soul, one thing sufficesme, which I shall tell you, and that is that he whom I love better than myself – nor do I love anyother thing except only for his sake – has in himself that which you have told me, which no-oneknows except himself. And so, since I love him better than myself, and he is the sum of all goodthings, and my Lord and my God and my all, he is all my comfort, says the Soul. And thus if Iam disconsolate for what I lack, none the less I am consoled again because he lacks nothing. Forin him is the abundance of all good things, without any lack; and that is the sum of my peace andmy thoughts’ true repose, for I do not love except for his sake. So, since I do not love except forhis sake, I lack nothing, whatever I may have said before. Truly not, when rightly understood;but I wanted to speak of him, for no-one told me anything of him when I would gladly havelistened to such speech, and Lady Love has said the truth to me about him, which is that I shouldcease to be agitated about him. For the best that anyone could say to me about him is nothing,compared with what he is in himself. And so I needed to hear no more said of him, except tobe told that my beloved cannot be comprehended.And it is true; for one could not comprehendthe least thing with which he might be compared. And so my love would never reach an end ofloving, for it always will have new love from him who is all love, immense though he be. This isall, says this Soul, that anyone can say to me of him, nor would anything have given me peaceabout him, except what Love has said of him.

And what he has, which Ido not have and shall not have, is more my own than what I do and shall have in my possessionfrom him himself.Reason.Prove this, says Reason.The Soul.It is easy to prove, says the Soul. See, here is the proof. I love the abundantriches which dwell in him a hundred thousand times more than I love the gifts which I have andshall have in my possession from him. And because I love better what is in him, beyond myunderstanding, than I love that which is in him and within my understanding, for this reasonwhat he knows which I do not know is more my own than that which I know of him and whichis mine; for where the more of my love is, there is the more of my treasure.

And moreover I would not be ableto do this, for he has so taken hold of me with himself that I can wish for nothing without him.Sweet Love, says the Soul, for the love of God, bear with me, for I am all filled with confusionbecause of him, so much that I do not know what to ask. What am I to ask of him? Truly I knowthat no more than one could count the waves of the sea when the wind blows strong can anyonedescribe or express what his spirit comprehends, however little it may comprehend of God; andthis is no wonder, for the body is too gross to speak of what the spirit has grasped.

But, Lord, still more it is my understanding,my intention and my hope, and this is true, that even if no-one but I alone had sinned, still youwould have redeemed my soul, turned away from your love, by dying all naked on the Crossfor rne, using the power ordained for destroying sin. So, Lord, all that you have suffered inyour sweet humanity you have suffered for me, just as if no-one had sinned except me alone;and therefore, Lord, this is a debt which I alone owe to you. And, Lord, I owe you yet more,that is to say that over and above what I have, I owe you as much as you are worth more thanI, for whom you gave yourself And always you know, Lord, that I can do nothing, and stillyou have put me so deeply in your debt; but I pray you, sweet and gracious beloved, forgiveme this debt, you who have the power to do everything. And without doubt, Lord, you willdo this, says the Soul, provided that from now on I will that in all things your perfect will be done.Chapter 35.

Reason, says the Soul, if I am loved to all eternityby the three persons of the Trinity, I have also been loved by them from all eternity. For just asin his goodness God will love me to all eternity, just so I have been known to his wisdom as shewho would be created by the work of his divine power. So therefore, since from the time thatGod, who is without beginning, has existed, I have been present in the divine knowledge, andshall be there without end; from that time, says the Soul, did he in his goodness love the workwhich he would perform in me by his divine power.Love.It is true, says Love, for from that time onward he would not have been willing torefrain from loving you, any more than he is now.The Soul.Now then, says the Soul, you have heard the witness of Love; so from now on besilent, and do not meddle with me.Reason.Be it so, Lady Soul, says Reason, since Love guides you and you do not guide Love;that is, since Love dwells in you, performing her will in you without you, I would no longer dareto meddle or interfere with you.

How the Soul is free and released from her subjec-tion to Reason.The Soul.Now indeed it is you who are in debt to me, says the Soul to Reason,l and rightly so,for my spouse’s noble courtesy would not deign to leave me any longer in your bondage nor inanyone else’s; for the spouse must needs also free his bride whom he has chosen by his will.Love.That is true, sweetest Soul, I grant and confess it.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, Lady Soul, says Reason, think and say and do all you wish, sinceLove wishes it and grants it.The Soul.Ah, Reason, says this Soul, how lacking in subtlety you are!

Yet it is fitting that he must wish,for I do not wish, except alone for what he wishes in me, and what he wishes for me to wish. Inhis graciousness he has placed me in this situation, where he wishes what I wish, and wishesnothing which I do not wish. And therefore, Reason, I have peace, says the Soul, since we havethis agreement between him and me. Ah, sweetest master; of this work, how can I have suchpeace, I who see how much of my work perishes? Yet truly, Lord, I can have it, for it is the wishof your graciousness and your nobility that since you have peace I too should have it.

But, Lord, in Paradise all those who will be there shall knowthem, not to my confusion but to my very great glory; for when they see that I have offended youby my sins, your mercy, Lord, and your generosity, full of graciousness, will be known.Love.Which graciousness, says Love, gives peace of conscience to this Soul, whatever shedoes or refrains from doing in willing our will, for to will perfectly our will is perfect charity.And whoever had always perfect charity in his will would never have remorse or qualms ofconscience. For remorse or qualms of conscience in the Soul is nothing else than lack of charity;for the Soul is not created for anything else than to have within her, endlessly, the state of purecharity.The Soul.Ah, Lord, says this Soul, what have I said about you?Love.Reflect upon it, says Love, and then you will be able to know what were your words.The Soul.Ah, Lady Love, says this Soul, you have given me the knowledge, so listen to it.This work is nothing, since it is fitting that it be nothing; and so it is fitting, says this Soul, thatI be certain that what I have said is less than nothing.

Indeed, it is yet your will to persist,more willingly than anyone can tell, while I remain in my desert, that is, in this wretched body,for endless ages; and still, for all the mercy that is in you, I cannot recover the time past which Ihave lost, for, sweet Love, your justice must be observed. So, none the less, it cannot be that thislost time will ever be restored to me, that I shall not for this be distant from loving and knowingand praising you.

Then, Reason, says Love, whatdo you call order?Reason.Order I call, says Reason, the constant life of the works of the Virtues, by my counseland that of Discretion, after the example of the works of our Lord Iesus Christ.Love.Reason, says Love, what the humanity of Iesus Christ suffered, his divinity did not feel;and I tell you that it is like this with this Soul as it was with him, for she takes no heed of whatyou say of the Virtues, says Love, or of yourself. She can do better, for Love, who has changedher into itself dwells in her. So that this Soul is herself Love, and Love has no distinction in it;though in all things such distinctions should be preserved, but only not in Love. I will give youan example. If a lord wants to receive in his land the tribute which is rightfully owed to him,the lord does not owe tribute to his serfs, although the serfs owe it to their lord. Iust so, I say toyou, Reason, says Love, that everything owes me tribute if they are the works of the Vir- tuescounselled by Reason and tending to Discretion, except only the one who is overwhelmed byLove and changed into Love; and this one owes me nothing but love, and therefore is dischargedof debt, because Love pays it.Chapter 40.

And the secret treasure of thissingle goodness has so brought her to nothing within herself that she is dead to all feeling fromwithin and without, so that such a Soul no longer performs any works, not for God or for herselfand in following this custom she has so lost all her senses that she is incapable of seeking God orfinding him, or of directing her actions.Love.This Soul, says Love, is not with herself, and therefore she must be excused by all men;and he in whom she is performs his work through her, and for this reason she is freed of anyobligation in this matter, witness God himself says Love, who performs this work to the profit ofthis Soul, who in herself has no work.Dread.Ah, Love, says Dread, where then is this Soul, since she is never with herself?Love.She is where she loves, says Love, without knowing it in her senses. And therefore thisSoul lives without reproach from her conscience, because she does nothing from within herself;for whoever does anything of his own initiative, he is not, says Love, without himself, but ratherhe has Nature with him and Reason.

I shall tell you, says the Holy Spirit, what she wishes for.This Soul knows nothing but one thing, and that is that she knows nothing, and she wishes fornothing but one thing, and that is to wish for nothing. And this knowing nothing and wishingfor nothing give her everything, says the Holy Spirit, and they enable her to find the secretand hidden treasure which is eternally enclosed in the Trinity. In no way, says the Holy Spirit,through any divine nature, for that cannot be, but thiough the power of Love, for so that must be.Love.Now, Holy Church, says Love, you have heard why this Soul has all things.The Holy Spirit.Indeed, says the Holy Spirit, she has truly everything which I have fromthe Father and the Son. And since she has everything which I have, says the Holy Spirit, and theFather and the Son have nothing which I have not in me, so this Soul has in her, says the HolySpirit, the treasure of the Trinity, hidden and enclosed within her.Holy Church.Therefore, since it is so, says Holy Church to the Holy Spirit, it must be that theTrinity dwells and lives in her.The Holy Spirit.That is so, says the Holy Spirit; since she is dead to the world, and the worldis dead in her, the Trinity will always dwell in her.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

For this Soul, says the Holy Spirit, has given us everything which she possesses.And whatever we have, she herself has given us, in a manner of speaking; for it is said, and it istrue, that good intention is counted as the deed.

But when I wish for nothing, and have lost everything beyond my will, then Ihave need of nothing; being free is my support; and I want nothing from no-one.Love.O most precious being, says Love, who have lost all your former customs, and havinglost them, now have the custom of doing nothing, now are you truly most precious; for in truththis custom and this loss have been accomplished in the nothingness of your beloved, and youdwell in this iothingness, says Love, in all things in his will; it is his chamber, and it pleases himto remain there.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

How Love praises this Soul, and how she dwells inthe abundance and affluence of divine Love.Love.O most highly born, says Love to this precious pearl∗, you have indeed entered into thatone free dwelling place where no-one enters if he is not of your kind and of no base birth.This Soul, says Love, has entered into the abundance and affluence of divine Love, not at all,says Love, through attaining to divine knowledge, for it can never be that any understanding,however illumined, can attain to any of the affluence of divine Love; but the love of such aSoul is so joined to the affluence of the more of this utterly divine Love (not by attaining theUnderstanding of Love, but by attaining to its Love which is utterly divine) that she is adornedwith the ornaments of this complete peace, in which she lives, and remains, and is, and was,and will be without any being. For, says Love, just as the ironis clothed in the fire, and has lostits own appearance, because the fire, which has changed it into itself, is the stronger, so thisSoul is clothed in this more, is fed by and is changed into this more, because of its love of thismore, without paying heed to the less, but dwells and is changed into this more of a peace thatis ultimate and everlasting, where no-one can find her. This Soul loves in the sweet land ofcomplete peace, and so there is nothing which can help or hurt those who love there, no createdbeing, no given thing, not anything which God promises.Reason.And what is there, then? says Reason.Love.That which never was nor will be given, that which has stripped her naked and hasbrought her to nothing, without her caring for anything that is, without her wishing to be helpedor spared by its power or its wis- dom or its goodness.The Soul speaks of her beloved and says: He is, says this Soul, and does not lack this; and I amnot, and so I know no lack. And he has given me peace, and I do not live except by peace, whichis born in my soul of his gifts, without any thought; and so I can do nothing if this be not givento me. This is my all and my better. Such a state of being makes one love and one will and onework to be in two natures. This is the power possessed by the bringing to nothing in union withdivine justice. This Soul lets the dead bury the dead, and the forlorn exercise the virtues, and sherests from the less in the more, but she makes use of all things. This more shows her that sheis nothing, naked, without covering, and her nakedness shows her the Almighty, through thegoodness of divine justice. What she sees makes her deep, wide, sublime and towering, for theymake her always naked, and all and nothing, so long as they have her in their keeping.Chapter 53. How Reason asks for an explanation of what hasjust been said.Reason.O sweetest one, says Reason, plunged deep in the unfathomable depths of completehumility, most noble rockl set in the wide plain of truth, solitary and towering above all, exceptthose who are of your dominion, pray you to tell us the meaning of these hidden words, uponwhich Perfect Love touches.The Soul.Reason, says this Soul, if anyone were to tell you, and you were to listen to him, youwould never understand him. It is so that your questions have shamed and spoiled this book, forthere are several who would have understood it if expressed briefly; and your questions, becauseof the answers you have required, made it long, for the sake of you and those whom you havenourished, who go at a snail’s pace.

How Love answers to Reason’s questions.Love.Reason, says Love, those who live as this book says, that is, those who have attained tothe state of being of such a life, understand this in a few words, with no need of explaining theglosses. But I shall give some explanation for your questions: so listen now.There are two kinds of people who live a life of perfection through works of virtue in spiritualaffection.The first are those who in all things mortify the body, performing the works of charity, and theyhave such pleasure in their works that they do not perceive that there can be any better state ofbeing than that of works of virtue and a martyr’s death, longing to persevere in it through thehelp of many prayers, always increasing their good intentions, always preserving this way of life,always holding fast as they do to it and convinced as they are that this is the best of all the statesof being that can be. Such people, says Love, are blessed, but they become lost in their works,because of the satisfaction which they have in their state of being.Such people, says Love, are called kings, but that is in a land where men see only with one eye,for truly those who have two eyes consider them as slaves.The Soul.Slaves they are indeed, says this Soul, but they do not know it. They are like thescreech-owl, who believes that there are no birds in the wood prettier than her owlets.It is just so, says this Soul, with those who always live in longing. For they think and believe thatthere can be no better state of being than that of longing, in which they dwell and wish to remain,and so they become lost on the way because of their satisfaction with what longing and wishinggive to them.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

Truly, if anyone said this to us, say theVirtues, we should hold him for a heretic and a bad Christian. For we cannot understand thatanyone can become lost who follows to the full our teaching through the ardor of longing whichimparts a true experience of Iesus Christ; and yet, Lady Love, we believe perfectly and with noelement of doubt in all that you say.Love.Truly says Love, but it is in the understanding that lies the mastery, for there is thegrain of divine sustenance.The Virtues.We believe it, Love, say the Virtues, but understanding it is no part of our office.We have fulfilled it well if we believe what you say whatever the understanding we have, for weare made by you to serve such Souls.The Soul.Ah, indeed, says this Soul to the Virtues, it is well said, and one must indeedbelieve you. And so I say to all who will hear this book: Whoever serves a poor lord for long canexpect a poor reward and little a ent. Now it is so, that the Virtues have realized and perceivedclearly, as those who have been willing to hear have heard, that they have no understanding ofthe state of being of Perfect Love. And so I say, this Soul says:How ill the Virtues teach their subjects what they do not have and never will have! But if anyonewants to understand and learn how those men become lost who remain in the service of theVirtues, let him ask it of Love; and, indeed, of that Love who is the mistress of Knowledge, not ofthat Love who is Knowledge’s daughter, for she knows nothing of this; but, best of all, let himask of that Love who is the mother of Knowledge and of Divine Light, for she knows the all ofit, as being the more of that all, in which more this Soul remains and dwells, nor can she dwellelsewhere than in that all.Chapter 57. Of those who are in the state of the forlorn, andhow they are slaves and tradesmen.Love.Now you have heard who they are who have become lost, and how and why and for whatreason. Now we shall also tell you who they are who are forlorn, who are slaves and tradesmen;but yet they act more wisely than those who have become lost.The Soul.Ah, for Love’s sake, Lady Love, says this Soul, you who render everything sosimple, tell us why they remain in the Virtues, just as they do who have become lost and servethem, and feel and long through the ardor of the keenness of the spirit’s work. Those who havebecome lost do this just as do the forlorn. Is there, therefore, some better reason for which youpraise them more highly than those who have become lost?Love.Is there? says Love. Indeed there is, and it enables them to attain to that state of beingfrom which those who have become lost can no longer have any help.The Soul.Ah, love of the Divine Love, says this Soul set Free, I pray you to tell us why theseforlorn ones are wise compared with those who have become lost, since they all follow the samecustoms, except only in this one sense for which you value them more than you do the others.Love.Because, says Love, they hold that there is a state of being better than their own, andyet they know well that they have no knowledge of this if better state in which they believe. Butthis belief gives them little knowledge of their own state of being and little satisfaction in it, forthey consider themselves wretched and forlorn.

And those whoare forlorn and who consider themselves wretched know this too; for if they are forlorn they canattain to the state of the free, of which we speak, through the directions of this Divine Light, fromwhom this poor little forlorn Soul asks the way and where her way is to be found.Reason.Reason.

Little she still is.The Holy Spirit.And the Holy Spirit says: She is little still, and in truth little will she stay solong as she persists in making any requests of Knowledge or of Love or pays heed to anythingwhich may be in loving or knowing or praising; for no wise man asks without cause, nor is heconcerned about that which cannot be. And therefore it can indeed be said that he is little or poorwho asks often, indeed in truth, who asks for anything.

How the Souls brought to Nothing are in the fifthstate with their beloved.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, what have Souls so brought to Nothing to give?Love.To give? says Love. Truly, Love says, whatever God possesses. The Soul who is suchis neither lost nor forlorn but rather is in rapture with her lover in the fifth state of being. Thereshe does not falter; indeed, often she is rapt up into the sixth state, but this does not last with herfor long. For it is an opening swift as a lightning flash and a rapid closing in which one cannotremain for long, nor could she ever have a teacher able to speak of this.The rapture of this opening as it is made, and widens by the peace of its work, makes the Soul,for as long as that peace lasts which is given to her in this opening, when once again it closes up,so free and so noble and unburdened by all things that, whoever preserved herself in freedom inthis fifth state after this had befallen her and did not fall back into the fourth would find herselfin great peace, for in the fourth state there is willing, and in the fifth state there is none. Andbecause in the fifth state, of which this book speaks, there is no will, and the Soul remains thereafter the work performed by the Far-Near of Rapture, whom we term lightning from its mannerof openings and rapid closing, no-one could believe, says Love, the peace upon peace of all peacewhich such a Soul receives, if he himself was not so.Understand these words in a spiritual sense, for Love’s sake, hearers of this book! This Far-Near,whom we call lightning from its manner of opening and rapid closing, takes the Soul from thefifth state and places her in the sixth, for so long as its work lasts and remains, and so her state ischanged; but the life of this sixth state does not last long in her, for she is set back, down into thefifth. And this is no wonder, says Love, for the work of the lightning, so long as it lasts, is nothingelse than the manifestation of the Soul’s glory. This does not last long in any creature, but only forthe time of its passage. And this is why such a gift is so noble, says Love, for it performs its workbefore the Soul has any sight or perception of the work. But the peace, says Love, of the work thatI work, and which remains in the Soul when I work is so delectable that Truth calls it a gloriousfood; and no-one can be fed upon it who remains in longing.

Afterwards, says Love, she lived by the life of the spirit, which life of the spirit wasborn out of the death of nature; and now she lives by a divine life, which divine life was born outof the death of the spirit.Love.This Soul, says Love, who lives by a divine life, is always without herself.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, when is such a Soul without herself?Love.When she does not belong to herself.Reason.And when does she not belong toherself?Love.When, of herself she is nowhere, neither in God nor in herself, nor in herneighbors, but she is in the bringing to nothing which is the work of this lightning, drawingher close by its working, which is so preciously noble that only she can speak of that opening,in a single motion of glory, which the noble lightningg gives. Only then is any Soul capable ofspeaking of this precious closing, for she has lost all memory through the bringing to nothing ofher knowledge, which such a bringing to nothing accomplishes in itself.The Soul.Ah, God, says this Soul, how great a lord would he be who could understand thebenefit of a single motion of such bringing to nothing!Love.It is true, says Love, that would he be.The Soul.If you have heard exalted matter in these words, says this Soul to the hearers ofthis book, do not be displeased if afterwards I speak of little things, for I must do this, if I wish toaccomplish what I set out to achieve, not, she says, for the sake of those who have attained this,but for those who have not attained it, but who will continue to beg for as long as they are asthey are.Chapter 60. How one must die three deaths before one attainsto a life that is free and brought to nothing.Love.Reason, says Love, you have asked me how many deaths one must die, before one attainsto such a life. And I answer you that before the Soul can be born into this life, it must die threeentire deaths. The first is the death to sin, as you have heard, which death the Soul must whollydie, so that there remains in her no shade or taste or smell of anything which God forbids in theLaw. Those who so die are men who live by the life of grace, and this suffices them, that theykeep themselves from doing what God forbids, and that they can do what God commands. Ah,you, most noble beings, brought to nothing and exalted in your great wonder and astonishmentwhen you are joined in union with Divine Love, do not be displeased that touch upon somematters for the sake of the little, for soon I shall speak of your own state of being. For none theless when it happens that black and white are set together, the two colours can be better seenbecause of their conjunction, rather than each by itself.Now you who are chosen and called to this state of being, understand and hasten, for it is avery long way and a great journey from the first state of grace to the final state of glory whichthe Noble Far-Near gives. I have said, says Love, that you must understand and hasten, for tounderstand this (those of sanguine complexion are naturally helped to it) is hard and subtle andvery noble; and those of choleric complexion have nature’s help, without being spurred on bythe keen will of the spirit’s ardent longing. And when these two natures meet, that is, nature andthe ardor of the spirit’s longing, it is of great benefit, for such men unite and join themselves sopowerfully to what they undertake that they all reach their goal, through the power of the spiritand of nature; and when these two natures agree, and with them the third nature, which by rightmust be forever joined to these other two – that is the abyss of glory, which by right draws it byEnglish Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

For zeal of love and the labor of charity, by which I was encumbered,have made me make this writing, so that you might be like this without delay, at least inwill, if that is still in you; and if you are already freed from all things, and are without will andliving a life beyond your understanding, so that you may at least provide the glosses for this book!Chapter 61. Here Love speaks of the seven states of the Soul.Love.I have said, says Love, that there are seven states, each more advanced to the understand-ing than the last, beyond comparison; for just as a drop of water is to the vastness of the sea, sois the first state of grace compared with the second, and so with the others, beyond comparison.And even so there is no one of all the first four states so great that the Soul does not live in it ingreat bondage; and the sixth is glorious, for the opening of the sweet movement of glory, whichthe noble Far-Near gives, is nothing else than a manifestation which God wishes the Soul to haveof her own lor which she will have forever. And therefore in his oodness he ives her in the sixthstate this manifestation of the seventh. This manifestation is born of the seventh state, whichgives the sixth state. This manifestation is given so swiftly that the very one to whom it is givenhas no perception of the gift which is given to her.The Soul.Is this any wonder? says the Soul herself. If, before such a gift were given, Iperceived it, I should myself be that which is given by that divine goodness, if my body hadrelinquished my soul, when he will give it to me forever.The Spouse of this Soul.This is not for her to do, says the Spouse of this Soul himselh I havesent you my pledges by my Far-Near. But let noone ask me who is this Far-Near, nor what arehis works which he performs and works when he manifests the glory of the Soul, for one cansay nothing of this except that Far-Near is the very Trinity, and makes this manifestation, whichwe call ’movement’ to the Soul; not so that the Soul should move, or the Trinity, but the Trinitymakes this showing of its glory to this Soul. No-one is able to speak of this, except only the Deityhimself for the Soul, to whom this Far-Near gives himself has such great knowledge from Godboth of him and of all things that she sees in God himself by divine knowledge; and the light ofthis knowledge takes from her the knowledge of God and of herself and of all things.The Soul.It is true, says this Soul, and there is nothing else. And therefore, if God wishes meto have such great knowledge, let him keep and prevent me from knowing him; for otherwise,says this Soul, I should have no knowledge of him. And if he wishes me to know myself, let himalso take away from me my knowledge of myself for otherwise I cannot have it at all.Love.It is true, says Love, Lady Soul, what you say.

Such people, of whom we have spoken, who are dead to mortal sinand born into a life of grace, have no reproach or remorse of conscience, so long as they satisfyGod solely in that which he commands.

And a rapturous brilliance and light join her and drive her fromever closer at hand, And therefore this Soul says:The Soul:O you people, puny, crude and not as you should be, she says.Reason.To whom are you speaking? says Reason.The Soul.To all those, she says, who live by your counsel, who are so stupid and asinine thatbecause of their crudity I must be circumspect, not speaking in my language, lest they shouldreceive death in that state of being in which I am at peace, without ever stirring I say, the Soulsays, that because of these men’s crudity I have to be silent and to be circumspect in my wordswhich I learned to speak in secret places, in the secret court of that sweet land,in which landGraciousness is law,Love rules and leads,and Goodness feeds.Its sweetness is my guiding light,its beauty is all my delight;its Goodness has my table dight;what else can I do, what mightagainst my peace take arms and fight?English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

The Soul says here that the practice of the Virtuesis nothing but care and labor.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, sweetest and unblemished flower, what do you thinkof our practice?The Soul.It seems to me, says this Soul, a labor full of troubles. Yet none the less man earnshis food and his sustenance through his labor in such trouble; and Iesus Christ ennobled it by thetoil of his own body, seeing the animal nature of those who would be saved by such labor, andfor whom therefore some certainty was necessary. And so Iesus Christ, who did not wish themto be lost, of himself gave them this assurance through his death, and through his gospel, andthrough his Scriptures, to which those who labor turn for guidance.Reason.And where do you turn for guidance, our sweetest lady, says Reason, you who takeno part in this wearisome labor, unless it is by faith from which you have these gifts?The Soul.No, truly, says this Soul, I am free of all this; my better is elsewhere, so far awayfrom this that no comparison could be made. Its end is in God, who is timeless; but I am intime so that I might attain from him what is mine; and what is mine is that I be established inmy nothingness. Now, Reason, says this Soul, you ask us to where we turn for guidance; and Ianswer you, says this Soul, that it is to him who alone is so mighty that he can never die, whoseteaching is not written down either in books of examples or in the teachings of men, for his is agift which cannot be given by formulation. He knows from all eternity that I indeed believed thiswithout I any need for proof Is there, says the Soul, anything baser than to ask for proofs in love?Truly not, it seems to me, since Love is its own proof and that is enough for me. If I ask for more,then I do not believe this.Reason.Ah,. Lady Soul, says Reason, you have two laws, your own and and ours; ours forbelief and yours for love; and therefore you say to us what you please, and so you have calledthose whom we nurture fools and asses.The Soul.The men whom I call asses, says this Soul, seek God in creatures, throughworshipping in churches, in paradises they create, in the words of men and in their writings.Ah, truly, says this Soul, in such men Benjamin is not born, for Rachel still lives in them; andRachel must die at Benjamin’s birth, and till Rachel is dead Benjamin cannot be born. It seems tobeginners that men such as these, who seek God in this way up hill and down dale, think thatGod is subject to his sacraments and to his works. Alas, they suffer such trials that it is pitiful,and they will go on suffering them, says the Soul, so long as they maintain this way of life andsuch practices. But those men spend their time well and profitably who do not worship God onlyin temples and in churches, but worship him everywhere through union with the divine will.Reason.Ah, most nobly born, says Reason, for God’s sake tell us, where do you seek him andwhere do you find him?The Soul.I find him everywhere, says this Soul, and that is where he is. He is one Deity, onesole God in three persons, and this God is all, everywhere; and that, she says, is where I find him.Chapter 70. How such a Soul is by the grace of God that whichshe is.Reason.Now, our sweet lady, says Reason, tell us what you are who speak to us.The Soul.I am, says this Soul, by the grace of God that which I am. So I am that alone andnothing else which God is in me; and God is also that same which he is in me; for nothing isnothing. But what is, is. And so I am not, if I am, except that which God is; and there is no-oneexcept God, and therefore I find no-one except God, wherever I enter, for, to say truly, there isno-one but him.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

How this Soul no longer performs any works forGod or for herself or for her neighbors.Love.This Soul, says Love, no longer performs any works for God, or for herself, or for herneighbors either, as has been said, unless God, who can perform them, does this if it is his will;and if he does not will it, she is no more concerned for the one than for the other; she is always inthe same state. So there is in this Soul the beam of divine knowledge drawing her out of herselfwithout herself, into an astounding divine peace, supported upon a crest of the outflowing loveof that Jealous Lover on high, who gives to her supreme freedom in all places.The Soul.Jealous? says this Soul. Jealous he is indeed! That is seen by his works, which havedespoiled me of my all, and have set me in divine pleasure without any action of my own. Andthis union of complete peace joins and secures me through the supreme excellence of the creationprepared by the divine being, that being from whom I have my being who is being.Love.When this Soul, says Love, is so drawn by him without herself, by God, for herself,thatis the divine operation; nor was ever once any work of charity performed by human body whichapproached or could approach to this work.The Soul.Understand in their true sense, says this Soul, the brief words of Love, for they arehard to understand for anyone who has not the meaning of the gloss.Love.It is true, says Love, for the work of the creature, that is to say the work performed byman, cannot be compared with the divine work, performed by God in the creature, out of hisgoodness for the creature.Chapter 72. This tells of the distance of the land of those be-come lost and the forlorn from the land of freedom, and whythe Soul has will.The Soul.Understand in their true sense, says this Soul, the brief words of Love, for they aredifficult to understand concerning the distance from the land of the forlorn to the land of freedomand of utter peace, in which land those who have being dwell!Love.It is the truth, says Love, and I shall speak briefly to them.The Soul.Truly it is, says this Soul, despite Will, in whom the forlorn and the sorrowfuldwell, who yet lead a life of perfection, such as it is.Love.When the divine Trinity created the angels by the graciousness of its divine goodness,those who were evil agreed, through their perverse choice, with the evil will of Lucifer, whowanted to have by his own nature that which he could not have except by divine grace. And assoon as they wished for this by their errant will, they lost their state of righteousness. Now theyare in Hell, deprived of being, never to regain the mercy of seeing God. It was their will whichmade them lose this exalted vision, which they would have had if they had surrendered theirwill, which they clung to. Now consider the end they have come to!Truth.Alas, alas! says Truth, why, o Souls, do you love such will, since it is through will thatsuch a loss is incurred?Love.I shall tell you, says Love, why the Soul has will; it is because she still lives in the spirit,English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

Lady Love, says Reason, tell me why from the beginning of the book youhave used the name ’Soul’ for this chosen soul, so beloved by you, since you say that the forlornhave will because they still live in the life of the spirit, and you have so many times called her byso inferior a name as ’Soul’ which is a lesser name than the name ’Spirit’?Love.You should know, says Love, that this is well asked; for, to understand this well, allthose who live in the life of grace through the fulfilment of the commandments, and who permitthemselves to be content with this, truly have the name of ’Soul’ not the name of ’Spirit’ but thename of ’Soul’ through the life of grace. For all the hierarchies of Heaven do not have one andthe same name, if one wishes to use their greater names; they are all ’angels’ but the first of theangels was not called ’Seraphim’ but ’angel’ only, whereas the Seraphim are called both the oneand the other.Understand without its being said, says Love, what this means. For it is just so, I tell you, thatthose who keep the commandments, and are content with this, are called ’Soul’ and not ’Spirit’and their true name is ’Soul’ and not ’Spirit’ for such men are far from the life of the spirit.Reason.And when is the Soul all spirit? says Reason.Love.When the body is all dead, and the will finds joy in shame, in poverty and intribulations; then it is all spirit, and not otherwise. Then such spiritual creatures have purity inconscience, peace in affection and understanding in reason.Chapter 73. How the spirit must die before it loses its will.Reason.Ah, for God’s sake, says Reason, Lady Love, I pray you to tell me why the spirit mustdie before it loses its will?Love.Because, says Love, the spirit is all full of spiritual will, and noone can live with divinelife while he has any will, nor can he be content if he has not lost his will. The spirit is notperfectly dead until it has lost its feelings of love and until the will, which gave it life, is dead;and in this loss I the will is perfectly filled with content in the divine pleasure. And it is from thisdeath that there arises that exalted life which is always either free or glorious.Truth.Ah, for God’s sake, Lady Divine Love, I pray you to show me, says Truth, a Soul whichis perfect in this state of being.Love.Gladly, says Love, and if she is not as I shall tell you, I bid you reprove her, and tellher that she is ill fitted and prepared to speak to me in my secret chamber, there where no-oneenters unless he is well fitted, as you will hear me say. No-one is my beloved, says Divine Love,except her who does not fear to lose or to gain, except only to please me, for otherwise she wouldbe concerned with herself and not with me, whom she would not be with; and no spouse ofmine could be concerned with herself And if she had committed as many sins as ever did all theworld, and if she had done as many good deeds as all those who are in Paradise, and if all hergood deeds and all her evil deeds were manifest to the people, such a Soul, says Love, would feelfor herself neither shame nor honor because of this, nor any wish to hide or to conceal her evildeeds; and if she did otherwise, says Love, she would be concerned for herself and with herself,and not for me, with whom she would never be. What shame, says Love, do those who are inmy paradise have, even though men see their sins and my gifts of glory which they receive fromme? Certainly they have no wish to conceal their sins nor even shame if men perceive them, norif they show my glory.Truth.Ah, truly not, says Truth, they leave that to the master, to hide or to show, according tohis will.

Why Love calls this Soul by so lowly a name as’Soul’.Love.Now, Reason, you ask us why I have called this Soul by so lowly a name as ’Soul’ Reason,says Love, because of your crudeness I have called her so often by her surname; and because byher surname we understand what is meant, we have made use of it, and we shall continue todo so; but her true name is a most noble one. Her name is ’Pure’ ’Celestial’ and ’Bride of Peace’For she is seated in the depths of the valley, whence she sees the peak of the mountain, and fromthere she sees the summit of the peak. No interloper can break in there, and there the wise oneplaces his treasure of safety: that is divine Love’s gift of union, and this union gives her the peace,and his lordship gives food only to those in the life of glory, and this is the food of my electedbride, says Love, who is ’Mary of Peace’ and she is ’Mary of Peace’ because she is fed by PerfectLove.

How the Enlightened Soul gives understanding ofwhat is said before by example of the transhguration of IesusChrist.Understanding of Divine Light.Ah, for Love’s Sake, says Understanding of Divine Light, tellme now, you who have reason to conceal yourself, what you understand in this.The Soul.I shall tell you, says the Soul of Light, what I understand of this.Those Who Have Reason to Conceal Themselves.We understand, they say, that Iesus Christwas transiigured on the Mount of Tabor, where there were only three of his disciples. He toldthem not to speak of this or say anything until he had risen again.The Free Soul.This is well said, says this Free Soul, to those who are the slaves of Nature,who because of this hide themselves; you have given me the club with which I shall subdue you.The Soul.Now I ask you, says this Soul, why did God do this? She Who Conceals Herself.He did it for us, says She Who Conceals Herself. And since he teaches us this, why should wenot do it?The Soul.Ah, you sheep, says this Soul, how like that of animals is your understanding!You leave the corn and take the straw. And I tell you that when Iesus Christ was transfiguredbefore three of his disciples, he did it so that you might know that few men would see thebrightness of his transfiguration, and that he does not show it except to his especial friends, andso there were but three of them. And this still happens in this world, when God sets himselfin the heart of the creature in the ardor of light. So now you know why there were three; andI shall tell you why this happened on the mountain. It was to show and signify that no-onecan see things which are divine so long as he is concerned or involved in temporal things, thatis in everything which is less than God. Now I shall tell you why God said to them that theyshould not speak of this until he had risen again. It is to show that you cannot speak a wordabout the divine mysteries until you cannot be afflicted by vainglory; until then, no-one mustsay anything. But in this Iwarrant you, says this Soul, that whoever has something to hide or tocon- ceal has something to show, but whoever has nothing to make known has nothing to conceal.English Translation Copyrightc©2008 Hugo M.

Here it is shown, by the example of the Magdaleneand of the saints, that the Soul has no shame for its sins.The Soul.Ah, for God’s sake, consider the repentant sinner. She had no shame, because IesusChrist said to her that she had chosen the better and the safer part, and, what is more, that itwould never be taken from her. And, also, she had no shame at all because her sins were knownto all the people, as the Gospel itself witnesses, which says so that all hear it that God droveseven devils out of her. She had no shame for anyone, for she was overwhelmed and taken andseized; and therefore there was no-one that concerned her except him alone.What shame did St. Peter have at God’s restoring to life the dead upon whom his shadow fellafter he had denied him three times? Indeed, he had no shame at all; rather, it was a great honorto him.What shame or glory had St. Iohn the Evangelist, at God’s making by means of him his trueApocalypse, after he had fled from where Iesus Christ was taken prisoner?The Soul.I believe, says this Soul, that he and the others had no shame or honor becauseof this, nor any wish to hide or conceal themselves; and also that they had no concern for whatGod did by means of them, and for them, and for the people, even though it was a divine work.These examples are sufficient, to those who have understanding, for them to understand the restof what this means; for this book is not written for different men.Chapter 77. Here the Soul asks if God has placed any end andlimit to the gifts of his goodness.The Soul.I have said, this Soul says, that they had neither shame nor honor because of what Goddid with them, nor any wish to hide themselves on anyone’s account, as you can see by what hasbeen said.Truth.Ah, truly, says Truth, they would not have known any reason why, for they wereunburdened of themselves and were, all of them, in God.The Soul.Ah, for God’s sake, says this Soul, since God gave them this grace, is he not stillthe same generous giver as once he was? Did he then put any end or limit to the gifts of hisgoodness? .Graciousness.Indeed not, says Graciousness: his divine goodness could not suffer it. He isconcerned with nothing else but to give, as generously as ever he did, the great gifts which he hasto give, and also that gift which never was given, which never was spoken by mouth or thoughtin heart, if man was willing and able to dispose himself for this. For love’s sake, Love entreatsyou, understand that Love has so much to give, and she puts no limits to the giving, so that in aninstant she makes, of two things, one.The Soul.But it is my pleasure to say one thing, says this Soul, not for the sake of those whoare in this state of being, for this is no concern of theirs, but for those who are not and who yetwill be, for this indeed concerns them: and that is that they should be on their guard, so that ifLove asks back from them anything of what she has loaned them, they should not refuse it foranything which may happen, whenever this may be, whatever Virtue Love may send to themto bear her message. For the Virtues bear, instead of messages, the will of Love in sealed lettersfrom their lord, as do the angels of the third hierarchy.And also let all those to whom Love sends her messengers know that if they then refuse what theVirtues ask by their inward being, which must have mastery over its body, they will never maketheir peace with the ruler who sends the message, but they will be smitten and troubled in theirknowledge and burdened down with themselves, because of their lack of trust.

And all thisbecause you have not obeyed the teachings of perfection, with which I urged you to set you freefrom your burdens in the flower of your youth. And yet you have never been willing to change,and you never have been willing to do anything about this. Rather, you have always refusedwhat I asked, which I made known to you by such noble messengers, as you have heard before.And such men, says Love, remain encumbered by themselves until death.Ah, truly, says Love, if they had been willing, they would have been set free from that throughwhich they are and will be in such great bondage and with so little profit; from which, had theybeen willing, they would have been set free at so small a cost. Truly, so small, says Love, as to setthemselves where I wished them to be, as I showed them through the Virtues, whose functionthis is.I say Love says, that they would have all been free in soul and in body, if they had followed mycounsel relayed by the Virtues, who told them my will and what they needed to do, says Love,before I could enter into them with my freedom.
