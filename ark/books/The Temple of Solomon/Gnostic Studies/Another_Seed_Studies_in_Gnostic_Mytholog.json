The delay in its publication has been dueto reasons quite beyond my control; it has not been possible to revise itfurther.The present work bears much upon those trends of Gnosticism, clearlydistinct from Valentinianism, which are often referred toas \"Sethian\"Gnosticism.Ihave tried, however, to avoid this term, which remainsproblematic. Much attention has been devoted to Manichaean traditions,which have tended to be somewhat neglected in recent Gnostic scholar-ship. The problems related to the origins and development of Gnosticismnotoriously belong to the most difficult questions of the history of reli-gions in the Roman Empire.I have sought here, at least, to avoid thetwin pitfalls of scorn and infatuation, which have too often plagued Gnos-tic studies. For the student of religion, the analysis of Gnosticpatterns ofthought is by no means of an antiquarian character, and its \"relevance\"need not be artificially emphasized.Itis with great pleasure thatI acknowledge the help, guidance, andencouragement provided throughout the various stages of this work.

In the case of Gnostic worksextantin several recensions, I refer to the recension translated in The NagHam-madi Library, unless otherwise stated.

Some Gnostic works that have no title in the codices havebeen assigned a name by their modern editors (the Untitled Treatisewhichappears in CG II, 5 and XIII, 2 is now usually called On the Origin of theWorld).In the anonymous work of the Bruce Codex,which has neitherincipit nor colophon, the figure of Setheu(Th 6 vc) is prominent.

Gnosticism was also an essentially mythologicalphenomenon, indeed, the last significant outburst of mythical thought inAntiquity.' It is to this fact that Gnosis owes its major significance for thehistorian of religions,2 for its acute syncretism and its negative attitude tothe material world were typical of the entire late Hellenistic world, notonly of the Gnostic movement. Here is one of the very few creations ofnew mythological patterns whose origins and early development do notvanish into the limbo of prehistory. Both Greek philosophers and Hebrewprophets attempted, in different ways, to demythologize thought.Theemergence and flowering of Gnosticism, from the 1st to the 3rd centuriesC.E., at the confluence of the Greek and the Hebrew cultural and religiousworlds, can be seen as a bold attempt to reverse this trend. This peculiarcharacterof Gnosticmythology-bothpost-philosophicalandpost-biblical-implies an essential, if subtle, difference between classical andGnostic myths, which should be emphasized at theoutset.Gnosticismfailed in its attempt to developan authentic new mythological thought andremained, in the words of Karl Kere'nyi, \"nur halbwegs Mythologie.\"3Paul Ricoeur, who also noted the ambiguity of Gnosis,conceives it as anAgfhebung of myth,so to speak, which destroys it as myth ipso facto.4A rejoinder to these views has been providedby Michel Tardieu'sdetailed structural analysis ofsome Gnostic myths.Tardieu points outthat \"the mythical thoughtat work in Gnosticism has rationalized and sys-tematized myth.\"5 In other words,one might say that the peculiarity ofGnostic mythology lies in its self-consciousnessof being both a mythology1See, for instance, W. Bousset,Kvrios Christos (Eng. trans.; Nashville-New York: Abing-don, 1970), 267; G. MacRae, \"NagHammadi and the New Testament,\" in B. Aland, ed.,Gnosis: Fesiscbrif/iir Hans Jonas (Ciottingen:Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1978), 146.211. J. W.

Thence stems the ambiguityof Gnostic thought, the artificiality of its mythology, whose figuresareoften hardly more than hypostasized abstract entities.6 A similar ambiguityis detected in Indian myths by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, who notes that\"the pseudo-historical framework is merely a manner of speaking,a meta-phor for theoretical ideas about the relation of good to evil, gods tomen,the individual to society.\"7 As a result of the peculiar self-consciousnessof the Gnostic author, one cannot simply apply to the study of Gnosticmythology the methods used to analyze primitive myths.Rather, oneshould try to delineate the background against which Gnostic mythologyemerged and grew: biblical exegesis as well as Greek philosophy.Latemyths, such as the Gnostic ones, can and therefore must be studiedgenetically as well as structurally; that is, the origin of the various ele-ments and their relationships to one another must receive complementaryattention. This will be no mere Quellenforschung, as long as the ultimategoal remains to unveil the rules and logic proper to the mythology in themaking, and to this hybrid system of ihougfht.The ambiguity of Gnostic thought is therefore directly reflected in themethod of the inquiry: at once diachronic and synchronic. \"There areno`good' or `bad' versions of a myth,\" says Claude Levi-Strauss,8 whoinsists that the search for the \"authentic\" version of myths has long beenan impediment to the development of a real science of mythology. Levi-Strauss, therefore, proposes \"to define each myth by the set (ensemble) ofall its versions.\"9 This concept of the versions of a myth is central to thepresent study. We shall see howsome Gnostic myths can be understoodand reconstructed only through the careful interplay of all their versions.This does not mean, however, that one should not distinguish betweenearlier and later versions of these myths; indeed, we shall seek to discerntheir evolution and progressive transformation.The hybrid nature of Gnostic thought is also reflected in its language.Therefore, Gnostic writings should not be approachedas if they were phi-losophical theology, despite theappearance of reason in Gnostic, and inparticular in Manichaean, etiological mythology, which claimed to be atotally rational science basedon \"reason pure and simple,\" and even ableto account for all physical phenomena.10 The implicit theology found in6C.

When Gnostic textsmake use of the conceptual languageinherited from the various schools ofphilosophy-as they often do-the words acquire new, incantatory over-tones.Terms drawn from abstract philosophical discourse result in a pom-pous and emotional \"densite dulangage, plutot que de la pensee.\" FatherFestugiere's saying holds true not only for the Hermetic tractates, but forall Gnostic texts.Gnostic language is soteriological, not dialectic, and is thus a languageof imagery and/or paradox.\" It has been said that it should be studied as\"mystical poetry.\"12 Incantations and images indeed indicate a poeticform, while the puzzling juxtaposition of paradoxes in some of the textspoints to \"mysticism.\" Even if it uses poetic forms of expression, how-ever, Gnostic language is as essentiallydifferent from poetry as it is fromphilosophy. As Levi-Strauss observes, myths, as opposed to poems, canalways be translated without any inherent change: their traduttore is notraditore.13The notion that Gnosticism is a kind of mysticism, moreover, can leadto serious misunderstanding.While the mystic strives to internalizeexperience within his own consciousness, the Gnostic achieved the oppo-site: an externalization of consciousness through myth. For the Gnostic,myth was the only possible way to relate to a world too dreadful to beconfronted with the limited intellectual powers of the individual.In thehistorical development of religious thought, mythology and mysticismbelong to two different stages, although, to be sure, one may lead to theother.It is the mythological structure of the world which the mystic seeksto internalize.This intuition forms the basis of the second volume ofHans Jonas's magnum opus, Gnosis and spdtantiker Geist.14 The very natureof mysticism compels the scholar to focus upon the inner world and thepersonal experience of the individual mystic. Central to the unio mystica isan integrative concept of the personality, of the subject, which does notand could not exist in Gnostic anthropology. Even when salvation waspresented as the soul's return to the divine realm, the Gnostic visiondenied the relevance of a concept such as \"personal experience.\" TheOn the use of paradox in Gnostic writings, see G.

In studying them, the present workwill seek to overcome thehiatus, all too frequent in Gnostic scholarship, betweenphenomenologicaldescriptions and the research into Gnostic origins.Gnostic studies are still marred by the problem of thedefinition and scopeof their subject.Scholars have known for a long time that their use of\"Gnosticism\" as a generic term for the various dualist heresies of the firstChristian centuries covers a spectrum much broader than thespecific doc-trines of the gnostikoi of heresiological literature.15 Indeed, themain prob-lem in the scholarly use of the patristic accounts is their highlydevelopedtaxonomy of heretical sects.It is often very doubtful whether many ofthe labels given to the heretics by the Church Fathers evercorrespondedto a concrete and precisely definedreality.16The discovery, shortly after the end of the Second World War,of thir-teen Coptic codices near Nag Ham adi,in Upper Egypt, brought to lightabout 40 new Gnostic texts. This disery has radically transformed thestudy of a phenomenon known until then almost exclusivelythrough thepolemical writings of its bitter opponents. The new texts havedrasticallyreduced the previously monopolistic importance of patristic accountsandhave permitted a more balanced appreciation of their value; yet,it has notdestroyed their significance altogether.The accounts of the ChurchFathers still remain extremely precious, despite the role played byhearsayand slander and despite the categorization of the variousheresies, whosefunction was ideological, to show that whereas the truthitself was unique,heresy was by nature as polymorphic as ahydra.17 One of the maindebates in Gnostic scholarship in the last generation has beenabout thenature and significance of the phenomenoncurrently called \"SethianGnosticism.\" The Nag Hammadi codices were even originallydescribedby Jean Doresse as a Sethian library.18 This almost unqualified assessmentwas based upon both the recurrence of the name\"Seth\" in some of thetractates and the many similarities, first studied byHenri-Charles Puech,15R.

In contemporary usage, in fact, \"Sethianism\" hasreplaced \"Ophitism\" as a provisional generic term for some of the central,and perhaps also earliest, trends of Gnostic mythology.21Since the19th century,scholars have attempted to organize theknowledge about early Gnostic sects. While no real consensus has beenreached, the themes that appear under various headings in the patristicreports have been regrouped into \"clusters\" within broader groups.These groups were thought to have split off only in those later stages ofGnosticism described by the Church Fathers.22 Thus, for instance, R. A.Lipsius, in his impressive attempt to reconstruct the historical evolution ofGnosticism, considered what he called \"Ophitism\" (using the term in abroader sense than the patristic heresiologists) to have been the first stageof the Gnostic movement.23 For him, the theology of the early Ophiteswas still very much in dialectical interaction with Judaism, and the Sethi-ans described by Hippolytus were a later offspring of the movement.24 Inone way or another, scholars of earlier generations agreed to use \"Ophi-tism\" as the main designation for the central mythological teachings ofthe early Gnostics.25 In most cases, the Sethians were seen as one of themain subdivisions of this postulated Ophitism, along with the Barbeloites(Irenaeus, Adv.Haer. 1,29), the gnostikoi (Epiphanius, Pan. 26), theArchontics (Epiphanius, Pan. 40), the Cainites (Irenaeus, Adv.Haer. I,31), the Noachites (Hippolytus, Elenchos VIII. 20), or the Naassenes,Peratae, and Justin's Baruch described in book V of Hippolytus's Elenchosunder the general heading \"the Ophite heresies.\"19\"Les nouveaux ecrits gnostiques decouverts en Haute-Egypte (premier inventaire etessai d'identification),\" Coptic Studies in Honor of W.

Fab. Compend. I,14), the anonymous \"others\" (alit) whosetheology Irenaeus described in Adv.Haer. I. 30, were identified with theSethians.Carl Schmidt identified the Gnostics known by Plotinus (Enn.II. 9, cf. Porphyry, Vita Plotini, 16) with the group to which the author ofthe Anonymous Work of the Bruce Codex (= the Setheus) belonged;according to him, they were Archontics and Sethians.27A close analysis of the various patristic reports on the Sethians hasbeen published recently, and there is no need to repeat here the results ofmodern research.28 It should be stressed, however, that at the root of alllater patristic accounts there appear to lie Hippolytus's two accounts, inElenchos VI and in his lost Syntagnia. The contents of the latter workarepreserved in outline in Pseudo-Tertullian's Adv. Onin. Haer. and form thebasis of the reports of Epiphanius and Filaster.Hippolytus's Syntagma,moreover, is closely related to Irenaeus, Adv. Haer.I, 29-31.The contemporary usage of the term \"Sethianism,\" therefore, is basedupon the assumption that some of the various trends described by theChurch Fathers, as well as many of the Nag Hammadi texts, share enoughin common to make their study under a single rubric fruitful.It is aroundthis assumption that the International Conference on Gnosticism, held atYale University in March, 1978, was organized.29 The core of the Confer-ence was two seminars, devoted to Valentinianism and Sethianism, inwhich some of the leading scholars in the field participated. The parallel-ism between these two Gnostic trends is justified by the growing recogni-tion of the primary importance-and probably the chronological priority-of those trends which are not Valentinian, but which might have providedthe principal mythological foundation of Valentinianism.30 There is, how-ever, some danger that this parallelism might blur the profound dissimilar-ity between the two terms. About Valentinianism, we have some reliableand firm data: the founder of the movement is identified, and the teach-ings of some of his epigones are known in detail.Sethianism, on the26Filaster hadcatalogued the Sethians as a Jewish sect (although they mentioned the com-ing of Jesus), Divers.

Schenke, moreover, identifiesas typically Sethian teachingsabout the heavenly trinity of the Father, the Mother and the Son,as wellas about the four Illuminators (Owo npcc).Schenke's reconstruction of the Sethiansystem has been strongly criti-cized.Frederik Wisse, in particular, has developeda series of impressivearguments against the obsessive search for the Sethians, which he consid-ers to be logically as faulty as the search for the unicorn in zoology.35Wisse warns of takingtoo seriously the heresiologists' categories, notingthat \"names suchas Valentinians or Sethians were necessary not only foreasy reference, but also to distinguish between truth and falsehood.\"Unlike the heresiologist,the scholar should not mistake the Gnostic31About the sociologicalcontext of Gnosticism we still know very little, despite therecommendations of the Messinasymposium in 1966.

Moreover, he adds, if the themes isolated bySchenke \"all go back to one system, it needs to be explained what causedthe present diversity among the tractates.\"36 In other words, Schenke'smethod is vitiated by the unconvincing proposition that the various writ-ings all represent more or less complete and developed forms of one sin-gle myth; and his systematic reconstruction appears to be very much anartificial construct.The Sethians of Schenke seem nomore real thanthose of Hippolytus.Although Wisse's arguments carry conviction, his own solution appearsto be less satisfying than his critique. To be sure, many of the recurringthemes noted by Schenke do adhere to a precise pattern of systematicthinking and argumentation. But this does not necessarily mean that theyare only \"free-floating\" theologoumena and mythologoumena, and thatno significance should be attached to the correlation between them, orthatthe original purpose of these texts was \"private meditation\"37(apparently, such a conception would deny altogether the existence of anyrationality or integration of the various themes). Here gain, the problemstems, it seems to me, from the lack of recognithe specificity ofmythical language. Wisse's overly skeptical reaction and his unwillingnessto overcome the discreteness of the various themes implicitly deny thepossibility of finding any governing pattern in Gnostic mythology and con-demn us, like A. D. Nock, to see in Gnosticism no more than \"an aggre-gate of a series of individualistic responses to the religious situation.\"38One of the main problems raised by the list of \"Sethian\" texts is thegreat difference between two different stages in Gnostic thought: whilesome of the texts are quite thoroughly mythological, others show per-vasive Neoplatonic influences.There is indeed a strong possibility thattexts such as Zostrianos, Marsanes, or Allogenes were read by the Gnosticsopposed to by Plotinus and do not belong to the earlier strata of Gnosticthought.Surprisingly enough, little attention was devoted at the YaleSeminar on Sethianism to the evolution of Gnostic thought.Nor doesSchenke's approach offer a convincing explanation of the discrepancybetween the two kinds of texts, for he speaks only of the \"encounterbetween Sethianism and Philosophy.\"If we are to retrieve the dynamics of the development and evolution ofGnostic thought, a middle way must be found between Schenke's andWisse's approaches, both overly static. The belief that such a middle wayexists underlies the present work. While no attempt to draw the lines of aprecisely defined but hypostatic \"Sethian system\" will be made here-indeed, I shall try to avoid referring to \"Sethianism\" at all-explanationswill be offered of the recurrence of various mythologoumena in many ofthe Gnostic texts.For the most part, the analysis will deal with non-Valentinian texts; yet, it should be notedat the outset that some of the361hid.,574.371h1d.,575-576.38\"Gnosticism,\"HTR 57 (1964), 273.

Some of the links, to be sure, are strictly literary,and exegetical traditions about the first chapters of Genesis do not, bythemselves, imply direct Jewish influence-since these traditions couldwell have been mediated by Christianity. Similarly, one should pay atten-tion to van Unnik's caveat that a Semitic milieu does not necessarily meanJudaism.Moreover, it goes without saying that Jewish influences bythemselves in no way provide a complete explanation for the emergenceof such a syncretistic phenomenon as Gnosticism. Nevertheless, the casefor the Jewish origins of Gnosis appears to be very strong.Actually, thehypothesis of Jewish roots was advanced as early as the 19th century; thepioneering studies of Heinrich Gratz46 and of Moritz Friedlander47 are theclassic expositions, to which should be added the little known work ofAlexander H6nig.48 Honig argued that the earliest Gnostics were EgyptianJews who had turned to heresy through a constant meditation upon theproblem of evil.According to him, these Jews founded the communitieswhich then became knownas the Ophites.Despite some remarkable39Supra, n. 30.40Exc.

This thesis was, in fact, already propounded by the Church Fathers,who were unanimous in seeing in Simon-the \"magician\" of Gitta whocalled himself \"the Great Power of God\" (Acts 8:10), the heresiarch parexcellence-the first false teacher who corrupted the message of Jesus.Hippolytus, indeed, attributed to Simon the Apophasis Megale, the peculiarGnostic work which he quotes at length.53 The appearance of the name\"Dositheos\" in the incipit of CG VII, 5 (\"The revelation of Dositheosabout the three steles of Seth\") has encouraged some scholars to launchanew the thesis about the Samaritan origins of Gnosticism, or, more pre-cisely, of \"Sethian\" Gnosticism. Dositheos was, to be sure, the founderof one of the major Samaritan sects in Antiquity.54 The fact that the name\"Dositheos\" was fairly common in Antiquity,55 however, should cautionagainst a hasty identification of the \"Dositheos\" in Steles Seth with theSamaritan teacher.Walter Beltz, in particular, has specifically argued for Dosithean originsof \"Sethianism.\"56 Beltz sets out to show that it was the early Dositheans(whom he calls the Samaritan \"Hauptsekte\") who first developed tradi-tions about the special status of Seth.According to him, the Samaritansconsidered themselves to besons of Seth already in pre-Christian timesand were so regarded by the Jews.Beltz establishes this claim by linking51 Gnosticism and Early Christianity (New York: Columbia, 1959),esp. 27-38.

ThisTaheb is called \"the crown of the sons of Seth,\" as opposed to \"the chil-dren of darkness,\" i.e., the sons of Cain.59 Although Beltz notes that Sethdoes not play an important role in other Samaritan works such as theMemar Marqah, he contends that this indicates a reaction by Samaritanorthodoxy against the views of the Dositheans, for whom Seth was \"thehero of a cultic legend.\"60 He claims that to the Sethian four-part divisionof history (which he rightly identifies as such) may be related the comingof the Taheb in the third world-period, and that the great catastrophes ofbiblical history, the flood and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,were exegeted by the Samaritans-who considered themselves the trueIsrael-as punishments visited upon unbelievers, fist: and foremost theJews.Beltz concludes that the Dositheans carriedn inGnosticism thetraditions they had developed about the special role of Seth.As ahypothesis, he adds that Gnosticism could have emerged, among theDositheans, from a clear distinction between the creative and the legalfunctions of God.6lBeltz's argument, however, is marred by several flaws: (1) He dismissesall the non-Samaritan sources in which Seth plays a significant role andmakes the unwarranted assumption that Seth in such a role implies almostnecessarily a passage to Sethian Gnosticism. We will see in the followingchapters that Seth was important already in very early(indeed pre-Dosithean) Jewish traditions.(2) He does not identify the passage in theDamascus Document upon which he builds his argument as a quotationfrom Num 24:17 and therefore fails to refer to the Essene Sitz im Leben.(3) He implausibly speaks of pre-Christian Dositheans.(4) He advocatesa very early date for the Asatir (250 C.E., in Egypt!).In this he followsMoses Gaster, the first editor of the work.6257\"Samaritanertum and Gnosis,\" 91.Probleme: Studien zumVerhahnisvon Samaritanertum,Judentuni andUrchrisiennmi (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1967), 51.59These texts (Maulid al-Nashi, Malef Molad Moshe) are cited by A.

These negative conclusions corro-borate Edwin Yamauchi's summary of earlier research: \"There is no indi-cation that Dositheus himself was a Gnostic.\"66 They do not, of course,precludefindinganyconnectionsbetweenGnosticandSamaritantraditions-but this remains a task for the future.This inquiry will first provide an analysis of some Gnostic solutions to thecrucial question unde ma/um? in the myths of the Urzeit.

In Gnosticism, thesame values and elements are not simply singled out,but inverted.

On this issue,the Gnostic texts fully confirm the testimony of the Church Fathers.According to Eusebius, for instance, the problem of evil was \"so muchtraversed by the heretics,\"' while Tertullian recorded that heretics, justlike the philosophers, constantly asked the same questions: uncle malum etquare? and unde homo et quomodo?2 The same point was also made byEpiphanius, among others.3 To be sure, preoccupation with the problemof evil did not originate with Gnosticism. The Greek philosophers hadlong devoted considerable attention to the nature and source, of evil.Inthe Academy, in particular, the close links between evil and matter wereemphasized. In that sense, indeed, one can agree with A. D. Nock's dic-tum that Gnosticism is a \"Platonism run wild.\" The Gnostic investiga-tion of the problem of evil clearly reflects a Platonic heritage.Yet, asimportant as this heritage may be, it apparently did not give rise to Gnos-tic mythology, but rather influenced its literary expression or providedphilosophical and conceptual background.4It is notoriously difficult to determine the origins of a phenomenon assyncretistic as Gnosticism; nonetheless, one must attempt to single outand analyze the individual elements which lie at the root of Gnosticmythology. Thus Hans Jonas tried to identify two kinds of Gnostic dual-ism.For the first, which he calls \"Iranian\" and which is representedchiefly by the Mandaean and Manichaean writings, the opposition of therealms of evil and good is eternal; the cosmicprocess was set into motionby the fortuitousencounter of these two realms.In the other type ofGnosticism, which he calls \"Syro-Egyptian\" andto which most of the NagHammadi texts and thesystems described by the Church Fathers belong,i ifist.

Puech has written a fine phenomenological treatmentof the theme, En quetede la gnose (Paris: Gallimard, 1978), 1, 201ff. andp. 197 for furtherreferences.4The scope andthe precise nature of the Platonic influence on Gnostic thought is boundto becomeclearer after the publication of all Nag Hammadi codices.See, for instance, C.Elsas,Neup/atonische andgnostische Weltablehnung in der Schu/e Plotins (Berlin: De Gruyter,1975)and B. Pearson, \"The TractateMarsanes (NHC X) and the Platonic Tradition,\" in B.Aland,ed., Gnosis, 373-384."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"18FROM ORIGIN OF EVIL TO ORIGIN OFRIGHTEOUSNESSthe forces of eviland darkness as well as cosmogony both stemfrom a fallwhich happened in the divinerealm, a \"tragic split\" in the Deity.5 This isnot the place tooffer a detailed criticism of Jonas's taxonomy.Let usonly remark that rather thanspeaking of two types of Gnosticism, it mightbe possible to discern somepatterns of evolution or even transformation.Such patterns would adequatelyaccount for the different emphases placedon the emergenceof evil or its established existence.Moreover, the basicpolarity in Gnostic texts is notbetween two hypostasized good and evilprinciples (as the \"Iranist\"school contended), but between the world andthe spiritual realm of thehigher God.6More than Platonic tradition,Jewish apocalyptic and pseudepigraphicliterature seems to provide arather precisely defined literary milieu againstwhich the emergence of theGnostic mythological confrontation of evilmay be betterunderstood. Some rather striking similaritiesbetween Jew-ish apocalyptic thought andGnostic thought have already been noted.Inparticular, C. A. Keller, pointing toseveral close literary parallels, hasdrawn conclusions about thesimilar sectarian milieus in which these twobodies of literature find theirSitz inn Leben.7 According to Keller, the deepseated frustrations in thesemilieus engendered radical \"responses to theworld\" and this explains the emphasis put uponthe problem of evil.The following pages, however,will not attempt jto investigate the socio-logical background of Gnosticmythology.RatherF, my analysis will focuson some of theliterary expressions of the mytfts_-ofevil.It is a well-known fact that intertestamentalliterature already represents a ratherfar-reaching process of remythologization.It is even possible that this trendlies behind the ambivalent rabbinicattitude towards many apocryphalandpseudepigraphic writings.Apocalyptic literature based its reflections onthe origin of evil upon two biblicalmyths of the Urzeit: the sin of Adamand Eve, and the descentof the \"Sons of God\" from their heavenlyabode and their copulation withthe daughters of men (Gen 6:1-4).It isthe latter myth which especiallyattracted the apocalyptic writers, andthrough which they confronted theproblem of evil. Whether the mythwas originally Persian, asBousset argues, or a Middle Eastern(Ugaritic?)version of the Greek myth of theTitans, its elusive ultimate originisSH. Jonas, Gnosis and spatantiker Geist, I (Gottingen:Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht,1939),256-257, and esp. 328-331.6For a succint discussion of this problem see K.

These various versions of the myth providethebackground for the Gnostic reinterpretation and permit an appreciationofits specificity.Moreover, a preliminary examination of apocryphal, rab-binic and patristic treatments of the myth of the Fallen Angelswillhighlight the various ways in which this myth was linked to thatofAdam's sin and fall; this link occurs in the Gnostic traditions as well.Already in its brief and cryptic biblical version, the myth is essentiallyetiological:it purports to account for the moral depravity of mankind.From the union of the Sons of God and the daughters of men were bornthe \"giants,\" the \"mighty men\" (gibborinr), who brought evil upon thewhole earth.Indeed the biblical text proceeds to describe the corruptionof human ways and God's decision to send the flood. The same myth iselaborated upon in various ways in apocryphal literature. Nowhere is theslightest doubt cast upon the identity of the Sons of God, the nepi/im:they are angels of the Lord.9Apocryphal LiteratureIn the Ethiopic Book of Enoch, chapters 6 -10 are devoted to the story ofthe sin committed by the Sons of God (or angels) and their subsequentpunishment. These chapters are part of the so-called Book of Watchers[i.e. angels], which includes chapters 1-36 of I Enoch, and seems to havebeen written in Palestine towards the middle of the 3rd century B.C.E.10 In8See W.

On theone hand it is clearly stated that they came down upon earth to copulatewith the daughters of men:And the angels, the children of heaven, saw and lusted after them[i.e., the daughters of men] and said to one another: \"Come, letuschoose wives among the children of men and beget us children....\"(I Enoch 6:1-2)Yet this already seems to be a variant of an earlier form of the myth,which interpreted the sexual intercourse as secondary to the original civil-izing mission of the angels.It seems, indeed, that in the original myth,the heavenly figures bringing knowledge and culture to humanswere seenas \"heros civilisateurs\" rather than as negative figures.But we do notknow how this early version evolved into a \"negative\" myth identifyingthe origin of civilization with that of evil.14 Chapte 8 consists entirely ofalist of the crafts and sciences the angels taught te race of men:And 'Asa'el taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields,Books Related to then, (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Hebrew University, 1974 [Hebrew]).11 / Enoch 6:6.Unless otherwise stated, apocryphal literature is quoted according to thetranslations provided in R.

The story of the angels coming to the earth, however, was itself traditional(Genesis 6).121n Charles's translation from the Ethiopic, thenames of the angels' leaders are given asSemjaza and Azazel. Yet the Qumran fragments reveal that their originalnames were Sem-ihazah and 'Asa'el. The identification of 'Asa'el with the biblical Azazel isnot original.How 'Asa'el first became associated with Semihazah remains unclear: \"And Serihazah,who was their leader...\" (l Enoch 6:3); \"And Semihazah, to whom Thou hast givenauthority to bear rule over his associates\" (I Enoch 9:7).131 Enoch 8:1:\"And `Asa'el taught men to make swords ...\" 9:6: \"Thou seest what`Asa'el hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousnesson earth...\"; 10:8: \"And thewhole earth has been corrupted through the works thatwere taught by <Asa'el: to himascribe all sin.\"14This\"negative\" version is very widespread and appears in completely unrelated cul-tures.

We shall see in the courseof this work how the \"star\"metaphor will be used subsequently in a seemingly very different context.The Book of Watchers was already known to the author of Jubilees18(written around 130 B.C.E.). There, we find an interesting development ofthe theme of the angels' descent. The original goal of their errand isdescribed in terms indicating a version of the myth typologically earlierthan that preserved in the Book of Watchers.19For in [Jared's] days the angels of the Lord descended on the earth,those who are named the watchers, that they should instruct the chil-dren of men, and that they should do judgment and uprightness onthe earth.(Jub. 4:15)The story of the angels, of their copulation with the daughters of men, ofthe evil doings of their progeny, and of their punishment is told inchapters 4-7. Some of the details differ from the Ethiopic version ofEnoch, but the story remains basically the same.20 In addition to thenepilinf and gibborint as sons of benei 'elohim in Genesis 6, there is a thirdclass of quasi-celestial beings: \"The Giants, the Napil and the Eljo\" (Jub.7:22), or rather the nepilinr and the eliud, as preserved in Syncellus' Greekversion of I Enoch.21\"For the judgment of the Fallen Angels,see / Enoch 55:3-56:4, 90:20-27.

Satan was banished-andfell from heaven,with his host of angels-because he did not want toworship Adam; andhe himself then made Adam sin.27 Note that here the twobiblical mythsabout the origin of evil are linked, one becoming the consequenceof theother.In the Apocalypse of Abraham, the sin of the angels ismentioned onlyindirectly.The text presents a structural inversion of the positionsofAbraham, whose place is in heaven, and Azazel, who nowbelongs toearth, since \"he has made it the dwelling-place of hisimpurity,\" probablyan allusion to the descent of theangels (chap. 13).In chapter 23, the24/ Enoch 106:1.In his commentary to lQapGen, Fitzmrites (p. 81): \"In the textwhich has been preserved we are not told why Lamech was(so disturbed, but the reason ...was probably something like the extraordinary things which the infant doesin Enoch 106.\"This is not a completely satisfactory explanation, however. In / Enoch (e.g., chap.65) Noahis saved from the flood because he is the only one on earth who did not learn\"all thesecrets of the angels\" (v 6), i.e., sorcery, witchcraft, and similar arts.For the traditionadopted by the author of lQapGen, Noah was unlike other men in his generationin that hewas the son of his mother's husband-and not of one of the angels.F.

El.13).Here too, therefore,there seems to be a connection between Satan and the leader of the sinfulangels.28In a different way, the Syriac Apocalypse qfBaruch also insists upon thelink between the sin of the angels and the first generation: \"For he [man]became a danger to his own soul: even to the angels he became adanger.\"It is the women who seduced the angels (and not vice versa, asin the original tradition attested by the Book oJ' Watchers). Succumbing totemptation, the angels lost the freedom with which they had been created(2 Apoc.

Bar.56.5).29 It is not conceived of as an accident happening early in the historyof mankind, rather it is projected back to the anthropogonic process.Finally, the punishment of the sinful angels is mentioned twice-although not elaborated upon-in the New Testament. One of the refer-ences is Jude 6:And the angels that did not keep their own position but left theirproper dwelling have been kept by him in eternal chains in the nethergloom until the judgment of the great day.A similar idea is expressed in 2 Pet 2:4 (the whole document is dependentupon Jude).30Rabbinic TextsDespite the development of angelology in apocalyptic literature-or rather,as a reaction to this trend-one can detect in rabbinic texts, side by sidewith many an affirmation of the importance of angels, a systematic fightagainst angelology.31 The downgrading of the angels' role is particularlyapparent in the exegesis of Gen 6:1 -4.As will be seen in another28See G.

Alexander wrote:For example, when the history of the Jews speaks of the angels whoconsorted with the daughters of men in order to have sexual inter-course, this way of telling the story hints at the nurturing faculties ofthe soul which comes down hither from above.43Despite the importance of this allegorizing tendency, the myth of theFallen Angels and their sin of lust did not completely disappear from earlyChristian literature. As late as the 4th century, clear echoes of the mythwere heard. For Justin and for Athenagoras, for instance, the progeny ofthe angels and the women were demons.44 Irenaeus, for his part, inter-preted the angels' fall from heaven as a consequence of their disobedi-ence.From his wording, it appears that overtones from the story ofSatan's fall had permeated the theme of the angels' descent.45 This amal-gamation of myths is explicit in the Acta Archelai, the archetype of mostChristian refutations of Manichaeism, which was written by Hegemoniusin the 4th century:Hence also some of the angels, refusing to obey God's command,resisted His will; and one of them fell like a flash of lightning uponthe earth [he is then identified as the devil], while others, \"harrassedbythe dragon\"(a draconeadflicti)united(admixti)withthedaughters of men.46Tertullian, for his part, condemned in strong language the sin of theangels, to which he referred on several occasions.47 Clement of Alexandriareferred to another detail stemming from apocalyptic literature (1 Enoch7:1), when he said that the angels taught the women secrets.48 Like Alex-ander of Lycopolis, both Lactantius and Eusebius expressly referred toGreek mythology.

The close relationship of Pseudo-Clementine literature to Jew-ish Christianity (its substratum is the Ebionite Ketygmata Petrou) and itsgnosticizing tendencies are significant in this respect.51 Purporting to argueagainst Simon Magus's dualism, the Homilies actually developed a veiledattack against Paul's theology.Indeed, for the Homilies, the myth of theFallen Angels answered the problem of the origin of evil, whereas Paulreferred to Adam's sin (Rom 5:12).52 In the Homilies, Peter presented theangels' descent as a punishment visited upon men for having deserted theLaw of God (Hour. VIII.11).The angels, taking human (and animal)forms, first went down to earth with the intention of preaching to menand asking them to repent and obey God. But they soon fell prey \"to thepower of the flesh and of lust\"; they united with the women, and, thussoiled, lost their proper and pure fiery nature, so that they were unable toreturn to heaven (Hone. VIII.12-13).It is significant that at the origin ofthis fall stands not a revolt in heaven, but rather lust, as the real source ofevil.In its attempt to harmonize the traditions reflected in I Enoch 6ff.(andin Jub.), the text added that the angels first attracted the women bychanging themselves (through their divine power), into various thingssuch as pearls, precious stones, and gold (Hom. VIII.12). But after theirsin, having lost this power, they were unable to give these gifts to theirlovers, and so they themselves discovered precious stones, gold, and othermetals in the earth and taught men techniques of magic, astronomy,etc.-all things which the human mind would never have discovered. In aword, all ornaments or pleasures of women are inventions of the demonsfettered in the flesh (Hom. VIII.14,2-3; 127 Rehm). The offspring oftheir illegitimate mixis were bastards (voGot) later calledon accountof their height.They did not revolt against God, as related in theblasphemous tales of the Greeks, but did have an irreitible impulse totaste blood; thus, they were the first anthropophagites (Hone. VIII.15-16).50 prep. Evang. 5.4 (ed.and trans. E. H. Gifford; Oxford, 1903), 1, 186d, p. 244. Cf. DeIsis et Osiride 25, 360c (ed. J. G. Griffith; Cardiff: Univ. of Wales, 1970), 154.

As a resultof their behavior the earth becamepoisoned by so much bloodshed, men began to dieearly, and venomousbeasts appeared. God decided to put anend to this deteriorating state ofaffairs, which threatened to corrupt all humanity to apoint where no onewould remain to be saved, and thus sent theflood in order to cleanse theworld (Hont. VIII.17). The giants died in theflood, but their race did notdisappear, for their souls led a separate existence, Godhaving orderedthem, through an angel, not to trouble menin any way.They wereindeed demons, though not altogether evil ones, and theirrole remained,under God's command, to punish both unbelievers andsinners (Hont.VIII. 18 -19; 126 -129 Rehm).The treatment of the myth in the Homilies is particularlysignificant inour context, since it mayindicate a transitional stage through which themyth reached the Gnostic circles.In the Jewish heterodox milieu, whichis the Sitz int Leben of the Kerygntata Petrou, theangels' fall appears tohave been of primary importance in explaining theorigin of evil.Thistheme was thus developed in a particular way, whichaccounted not onlyfor the angels' sin, but also for their initially goodintentions (as inJubilees), as well as for the existence of demons, identified with theoffspring of the angels. The same identification may be foundin many ofthe Gnostic texts.It is also interesting to note that the author of theHomilies was aware of the Greek myth of the Titans, the sonsof Uranusand Gaia, and their revolt against the gods, but rejected anylink betweenit and the biblical myth-although he identifiedNoah with Deucalion, asdid the Apocalypse of Adant. For the Pseudo-ClementineHontiltes, there-fore, evil stemmed from sexual ntixis, from forbidden unions between twodifferent categories of beings. The problem was set forth in verysimilarterms in Gnostic contexts.Gnostic ReinterpretationIn a way, the origin of evil in Gnostic mythology should beunderstood interms of ntixis; the creation of the worldby the agents of evil is but oneaspect of this permanent attempt at mixing uncleanelements of darkness,or matter, with pure elementsof light, or spirit. While there was a possi-bility of salvation if the pure elements remained untainted(that is to say,remained free from any contact with the unclean ones ormanaged tobecome disengaged from them), the forces of darkness perpetually strove,in history as well as in cosmogony or anthropogony, to minglewith theelements (the \"children\") of light.For Gnostic thought, the most obvi-ous way for the evil rulers to achieve this mixis wasthrough sexual rela-tions with human beings. Thus Nicolaus was presented as speakingaboutthe \"fetid and unclean\" permixio, which originated in the lustof darknessfor light.5353Pseudo-Tertullian, Ac/r. Onur. Haer.1(215 Kroymann).

Puech analyzes various occurrences of thesame theme of the angels' fornication with women.54 He shows its impor-tance in different Gnostic contexts, where the sending of the flood by theheavenly Mother was always presented as a direct consequence of thesepermixiones of angels and humans.55 The myth is known not only in textsand traditions usually considered to be \"Sethian,\" but also in Valentiniancontext.56In a more recent study of the theme of the angels' fornication withwomen in Gnosticism, Yvonne Janssens states that the myth as it appearsin Genesis 6 cannot be found \"a 1'6tat put\" in Gnostic texts.57 Yet thethrust of her article is precisely to focus attention on the recurrence ofthis theme in various Gnostic contexts. Although she quotes some Jewishsources for the theme (I and 2 Enoch) and cites various Gnostic texts andparallels (the theme of the bridal chamber in Gos. PhiL, the attitude ofElohim in Justin's Baruch, etc.), she stops short of integrating the variouspieces of evidence into a global understanding of this myth in Gnosticthought.In Gnostic literature, however, the theme of the Fallen Angels is muchmore than what Janssens calls \"un centre d'attraction litteraire.\" Indeed, Ishall demonstrate that it played a major function in the development ofGnostic mythology, and that it is at the very core of the mythologicalexpression of Gnostic consciousness. During the discussion generated byJanssens's paper at the Messina Conference, Hans Jonas hinted at theimportance of what I propose to call provisionally a \"cluster of themes.\"He suggested that one should attempt to builda typology of related, albeitdifferent, themes such as the fornication of the angels, the seduction ofthe archons, abortions, and the demiurge's rape of Eve.58 The followingchapters may be regarded as a contribution towards a typology suchas thatproposed by Jonas.

In monotheistic theol-ogy, it is essential to accountfor the existence of evil in a world createdby God, who is good. Dualist Gnosticism, on the other hand, takes evilfor granted. The main emphasis, therefore, is placed on the explanationof the possibility of salvation-for some-in a creation seen as utterly evil.This peculiar focus of the problem-not so much of evil as of good-forGnostic mythology, has not been accorded due attention.The two biblical myths that could account for the presence of evil weresometimes integrated in apocalyptic literature, and Satan was linked to theFallen Angels of Genesis 6 in some of the versions. This combinatoryprocess was given new and systematic dimensionsin Gnostic mythology.The two original myths were integrated into a much broader mythicalframe, intended to make manifest the basic pattern of both history andcosmogony: the evil deeds of the lustful demiurge and his associates, thearchons. For Gnostic mythology, indeed, evil stemmed from a series ofsexual sins.In its new frame, the myth focused upon the escape of purewomen from the lust of the angels (i.e. thearchons). These women, hav-ing remained unsoiled, were thus able to transmit the pure seed.Evidence for the importance of the myth in Gnosticism will be cited aswe proceed to analyze the various related themes. One passage, however,which shows quite clearly how the myth of the Fallen Angels was con-nected with the very beginnings of mankind, is worth quoting at theoutset.InVal.Exp. 38:22-37, the Devil, \"one of the divine beings\"(38:13-14) is said to have begottensons who [angered one another. And] Cain [killed] Abel his brother,for [the demiurge] breathed into [them] his spirit. And there [tookplace] the struggle with the apostasy of the angels and mankind, thoseof the right with those of the left, and those of heaven with those onearth, the spirits with the carnal, and the Devil against God. There-fore the angels lusted after the daughters of men and came down toflesh so that God would cause a flood.The lustful angels are also mentioned in other Gnostic texts.In Apoc.Adam 83:14-17, for instance, they are explicitly said to have been \"cor-rupted by their desire. \"5959See also Tri.Tiac. 135:1-5 and Testier.Truth 40:30-41:4.

Eg. 111 61:1 -3: \"andthe flood came as an example for the consummation of the aeon.\" The sin of the FallenAngels is probably alluded to in Gos.

Yet the etiological function of the theme of mixis inGnostic mythology was so different that in its new setting, the mythunderwent not only far reaching developments, but also a radical transfor-mation, some of whose steps we shall attempt to follow.The Daughters of MenFollowing the Bible, some Jewish texts (e.g.,I Enoch, Jubilees) integratedthis episode into human history, a fact of obvious theological significance,for it meant that the origin of evil was not concomitant with God's crea-tion.Gnosticism, on the other hand, had a vested interest in showingthat the pattern of mixis had already begun in the very first generation ofmankind. In some Gnostic texts, therefore, the responsibility for Eve andAdam's sin of concupiscence was attributed to the demiurge himself.InApoc. Adam, for instance, itis he who was responsible for the \"sweetdesire\" in Adam's heart. At least two explanations of concupiscence areimplicit in this text.First, sexual impulse is seen as stemming directlyfrom the male/female duality, i.e., from the separation of the androgynalprotoplast which \"the Ruler of the aeons\" had made in his wrath(64:20-23). Second, Eve became sexually attractive to Adam only afterher seduction, by the demiurge, who here plays the role of the serpent inJewish theology.]To this text, in which the (reversed) biblical themes can be easilyrecognized, may be contrasted Gos. Phil. 70:20-22: \"Thus Eve separatedfrom Adam since she was never united with him in the bridal chamber.\"2In this eclectic work of Valentinian affinities, the reason for Eve's fall isthe adultery that she committed in her mind, i.e., her illegitimate desirefor the serpent, which led to Cain's birth.According to the popular wis-dom accepted by Gos.

Reub. 5:7, where thewomen who \"united themselves with the angels\" were, in fact, sleepingwith their husbands, but committing adultery in thought.An interesting treatment of the same theme occurs in the Apoctyphon ofJohn. In this text, one cannot properly speak of a fall of the angels, sincethey descended on purpose, sent by the evil demiurge in order to enslavehumanity through concupiscence.In this text the sin of the angels is notregarded as the cause, but as the consequence of the flood.4 This lattermotif, however, was strongly gnosticized: Noah-a positive figure here asin certain other Gnostic contexts5 -and his kin from the unshakeable race(TreNsa aTKIM)6 did not enter the ark, but \"went into a place and hidthemselves in a luminous cloud,7 in order to escape the wrath of thedemiurge. Angry at not being able to seize Noah, the demiurge decided(\"with his powers\") to send angels to the daughters of men \"that theymight take some of them for themselves and raise offspring for theirenjoyment.\" They thus created a \"despicable\" or \"opposing\" spirit, as3For Gos.Phil. \"Indeed every act of sexual intercourse which has occurred betweenthose unlike one another is adultery\" (62:10-12; 65:1-26).

This can be easily recognized as derived directlyfrom the description of the angels' fall in 1 Enoch 8:1, for although it wassignificant in the early version of the myth (where the origins of evil andof moral depravation were linked to the origins of civilization), this ele-ment appeared as a mere literary vestige in the Gnostic story, without anyspecific function.It can therefore be safely assumed that the author-orthe redactor-of Ap. John knew and used the Jewish traditions embodiedin various pseudepigraphic works and integrated them into his own ver-sion of the myth, albeit not always wisely.This analysis, however, fallsshort of proving that the author was in close contact with Judaism. In the2nd century, when Ap. John was probably written, these texts already cir-culated far beyond the Jewish communities, indeed they were current pri-marily in Christian circles if our evidence is to be trusted.

John, namely, thecase of Eve, may provide a further clue towards a solution of the problemof the traditions worked over by the Gnostics in their myth-making. Thetext reports that when Yaldabaoth, the first archon saw \"the virgin whostood by Adam,\" with the luminous Epinoia of ife shining in her, hedecided to seduce her.While Pronoia \"snatchede out of Eve\" (cf.Hyp.

In other words, hegave them these namesin order to conceal their archontic nature.

On thecontrary, this union seems to have beena pure one, for it produced Seth,the father of the \"unshakeable race,\"to which the pneunra wassent bythe Mother and whichwas thus in perpetual opposition to the bearers ofthe an/inrinionpneunra. What remains puzzling is the fact that it is theevilYaldabaoth who planted sexual desirein Adam,12 desire throughwhichthe pure seedwas transmitted.In order to have Seth belongto the spiri-tual race, the intervention of the Motherwas required.So, in a senseSeth was not simply Adam'sson, but also linked to the heavenly world.Itseems that the Gnostic author, confronted with theproblem that thefathers of both thepure and the evil race were born from Eve, offeredaradical solution by asserting that Eve's firsttwo sons were actually thepro-duct of a rape.Nevertheless, this authorcould not free himselfcom-pletely from the more traditionalattitude, according to whicheven thesexual relations between Adamand Eve stemmed froman unclean desire.A more logicalor consistent stand based on thesame premises waspresented in Gos.

The Mother thus intended to fight the angelswho had created Cain and Abel, \"since this pure seed (hoc semen mun-dum) rises and is born\" from Seth. \"For (enim) they speak about iniqui-tous permixtiones of angels and men, which prompted the Power to sendthe flood, in order that \"that seed of permixture\" be swept away and onlythe pure seed be kept intact (integrum) (218 Kroymann).

Since they realized with awe that Adam and Eve had been grantedlife (i.e., spirit) by the power on high, they intended to use this lust intheir mischievous plan,30 to maintain their domination over mankind.Indeed Eve was Zoe (life), Sophia's daughter, whom her mother sent asan instructor to Adam in order to awaken him and to give him a soul,which would turnhisoffspringintovesselsof light(Orig.World115:31-36).To oppose Eve's awakening of Adam (116:1-5),' theauthorities again tried to make him sleep.31But here, too, Eve succeeded in foiling the plot:Then (the Lite-) Eve, since she existed as a power (8vvaμus), laughedat their intention (yvtμr)). She darkened their eyes and left her like-ness there stealthily beside Adam. She entered the tree of knowledgeand remained there.(Orig.

Thus in the Extracts oj' Heracleon,the material ones (chdikoi) \"have the devil for father\" and are the chil-dren neither of Abraham nor of God (the passage is an exegesis of John8:44).41 More precisely, the chdikoi were sons of the Devil by nature,while the psychikoi were his sons only by intent.42 In the words of Theodo-tos, there were the sons of Cain and Abel respectively, while the pneunia-tikoi, the Gnostics by nature, were the sons of Seth.43 Similarly, in Gos.38Adv.

Phil.M._ary_ was,, in a.sense, the anti-Eve,\"the virgin whom no power defiled\" (55:27-31). She united not withthe serpent, but with the Father of everything, so that Christ \"was bornfrom a virgintorectify thefall which occurred inthe beginning\"(71:3-21).In Vai. Exp. 38:22-27, both Cain and Abel were said to be sons of theDevil. The same theme also appeared in later dualist systems such asManichaeism and Bogomilism. According to the Interrogatio lohannis (awork of Bogomil inspiration later imported from Bulgaria by the CatharBishopNazarios),forinstance,theDevil, was theinitiatorpeccati.Through various means and in the guise of the serpent, he united withEve and impregnated her with both Cain and his twin sister Kalomena (orKalmena). He then poured lust \"on the head of the angel who was inAdam.\" Adam then impregnated Eve with Abel, who was killed by Cainas soon as he was born.44The same themes that we have followed in Gnostic literature also occurin some rabbinic texts mentioning Eve's sexual relations with Satan or theserpent. The evidence suggests that this theme originated in Judaism.45Actually, the theological questions raised both by the serpent's seductionof Eve and by the birth of the murderer Cain are far from confined toGnosticism. Even before the Gnostics, Jews could have combined thesetwo questions into one by arguing that the serpent (or Satan) was directlyresponsible for Cain's birth (but not Abel's!), for he himself had had sex-ual relations with Eve.This Jewish conception already occurred in theGospel of John 8:44: \"You are of your father the devil, and the lusts ofyour father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning.\"46 Likethe seduction of the women by the angels, this theme was probably bor-rowed from Jewish traditions.Inrabbinic Judaism, such traditions44Puechhas collected the relevant sources in his book, written in collaboration with A.Vaillant, Le matt(' conne les Bogonules de Cosmas le(Travaux publie's par l'Institutd'Etudes Slaves 21; Paris: Droz, 1945).

Rab. 20.11; 195 Theodor)These passages should be read in the context of similar Jewish tradi-tions.Already in targumic literature, the sexual relations between Eveand Sammael were mentioned, e.g., in Pseudo-Jonathan:And Adam knew that Eve ('11n !1,,puiv,) his wife had conceived fromSammael, the angel of the Lord, and she became pregnant and boreCain (tulp rn l1i H), and he was like those on high, not like thosebelow; and she said: \"1 have acquired the angel of the Lord as aman. \"49The Targum here interprets the two particles t1K (Aramaic t1') in Gen 4:1.The difficulty-how can Eve acquire a man from (t1K) the Lord immedi-ately after Adam is said to have known (is v,') her?-is removed if the47See Layton's commentary on Hyp.

Moreover, the myth of Eve's sexual relationswith the serpent does not seem to have been widely known in early Chris-tian literature, a fact which strengthens the hypothesis of Jewish influenceon the Gnostic mythologoumena. Although the rabbinic texts were prob-ably redacted at a later date than the Greek or Aramaic Vor/age of theGnostic texts, a previous oral tradition may be assumed. The evidence ofthe Targum-and of the Gospel of John-reflects the early date of the ori-ginal Jewish exegetical traditions.Moreover, itis easier to understandGnostics attributing previously known legends about the serpent to thedemiurge, than to imagine rabbis integrating scandalous Gnostic sayingsabout God the Creator into their own thought simply by transferring themto Satan or the serpent.It is thus reasonable to see in the Gnostic textsthe radicalization of Jewish conceptions.Birth of Cain and o/' SethWhile Ap. John (24:32-34) hypostasized Cain and Abel into Elohim andJahwe, the archons who are \"over principalities (apXrf) so that they ruleover the tomb,\"53 it described the conception and birth of Seth in a verydifferent fashion:And when Adam recognized the likeness of his own foreknowledge(7rpoyvcucres), he begot the likeness of the son of man. He called himSeth according to the way of the race in the aeons.Likewise theMother also sent down her spirit which isin her likeness and areflection (6vrinrv7roc) of those who are in the pleroma, for she willprepare a dwelling-place for the aeons which will come down.(Ap.John 24:34-25:7)54Commenting on this passage, G. MacRae55 states that it \"explicitly associ'-ates the human Seth with the heavenly Seth mentioned in an earlier phaseof the myth (9:11-17; BG, 35:20-36:7). The 'son of man' is of coursethe celestial son of the heavenly Adam, but it may also be an interpreta-tion of Gen 5:3.\" MacRae then connects this text with Apoc. Adam65:5-9, where Adam declares to Seth, \"For this reason I myself havecalled you by the name of that man who is the seed of the great genera-tion or from whom (it comes).\"531.e., the bodies of later generations.

Indeed, most ofthe rich midrashic developments on the relationships between these twofigures are rather predictable.56 While Abel was opposedto his brotherCain (Gen 4:2: \"And again, she bore his brother Abel\"), hewas alsoassociated with Seth in a way that stressed the difference between 'thetwobrothers. At Seth's birth, Eve said, \"God has appointed forme anotherchild instead of Abel, for Cain slew him\" (Gen 4:25b).This fact-together with the assumption that Abel died without offspring andwasthus almostirrelevanttolaterHeilsgeschichle-may account fortheambivalence of the Gnostic sources towards him; sometimes Cain alonewas described as being born from Sammael, while in other texts hisbrother was granted the same satanic fatherhood.In order to understand the basis for the Gnostic exegesis of theanta-gonism between Cain (or Cain and Abel) and Seth, I wishto offer the fol-lowing hypothesis. We have already noted the Jewish exegesis of Gen4:1 b: \"and she [Eve] conceived and bore Cain, saying: `I acquireda manfrom the Lord.\"'57 Yet this verse must have been read by Jews incon-nection with the two verses recounting Seth's birth:And Adam knew his wife again, and she borea son and called hisname Seth, for she said: \"God has appointed for me another seed58instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.\" (Gen 4:25)When Adam had lived a hundred and thirtyyears, he became thefather of a son in his own likeness, after his image59 and namedhimSeth.

This was the solutionadoptedbytheArchonticsdecribedbyEpiphanius.61Theutterlyantinomian \"Cainites\" also adopted this view, but with a twist; theTetragrammaton in Gen 4:1 was not understood by them as referring tothe lesser deity (the demiurge, Sammael), but rather-as in Jewish orChristian exegesis-to the supreme Lord God, thus giving Cain divineancestry.62 Typologically, at least, this radical reinterpretation of the bibli-cal text was a further development and may reflect a later stage of Gnosticthought.(2) Another exegesis might have appealed to Gnostics who either didnot know or did not accept the Jewish midrash according to which Sam-mael (or the snake) was Cain's father.They would have taken forgranted that Cain was Adam's son and thus interpreted \"another seed\" inGen 4:25 as meaning that Seth's father was the heavenly, not the earthly,Adam.63 The celestial paternity of Seth would imply that he was the bearerimage,\" and that later generations were Centaurs and apes.

See for instance, puzzling texts in Gen. Rab. 22:7: \"Judah b.Rabbi said: Their [Cain's and Abel's] quarrel was about 'the first Eve.' Said R. Aibu: Thefirst Eve had returned to dust\" (213 Theodor).

This is what the Sethians taught, according to Epi-phanius.After begetting Cain and his family, Eve repented, united withthe heavenly Father, and begat Seth, the pure seed from which all human-ity came.64(3) The attribution of Seth's paternity to the divine principleextant inAdam would not preclude seeing the chief archon as the father of Cain(and Abel). On the contrary, such a combination of the two themeswould further emphasize the difference between Seth and Cain.This isthe solution adopted in Hyp. Arch.

Gen 5:3waslinked with Gen 1:26; so that Seth was considered to be \"in the likenessand after the image\" not of Adam, but directly of God.A particularly difficult passage is found in Orig. World 114:14-15. Inthe declamatory hymn, Eve's heavenly counterpart (\"the first Virgin\"),sings, \"I have borne a lordly man.\" Thisson of the primordial Eve isalso referred to in the text as a \"lord\" whom the authorities called \"thebeast\" (9-qpi,ov) (Orig. World 113:34-114:1). A. Bohlig has pointedoutthat this reflects a play on words in Aramaic (beast= hywah).69 The iden-tity of this son, however, remains unclear.

World 102:10-11.In earlier scholarship, the most commonly suggested etymology for thisstrange figure (\"of whom nothing is known,\" according to Harvey73)derives her name from the Hebrew na`arah (\"maiden\").74 Recent studies,however, have come to recognize in her a kind of female counterpart ofSeth and a major salvific figure in Gnostic mythology.For Judaism as well as for Gnosticism, the offspring of the first fewgenerations raised a theological problem, since the sons of Adam and Evehad to marry their sisters, who were not mentioned in the Bible. Varioustraditions, stemming from pseudepigraphic literature, were developedabout these sister-wives, who were said to have been born as the twin sis-ters of Cain, Abel, and Seth. As Seth's sister, Norea has been comparedto Sophia (Prunikos), Jesus's sister in christianized Gnostic trends.75The Gnostic texts generally present Norea as the pure Eve's untaintedor virgin daughter, who underwent an experience similar to that of hermother at the hands of the evil archons and their leader. This is how Hyp.Arch. 92:18-93:1 describes the event:The Rulers went to meet her intending to lead her astray.Theirsupreme chief said to her: \"Your mother Eve came to us.\"ButNorea turned to them and said to them: \"It is you who are the Rulersof the Darkness; you are accursed.And you did not know mymother; instead it was your female counterpart thal you knew. For Iam not your descendent; rather it is from theorld above that I amcome.\" The arrogant Ruler turned, with allmight, [and]hiscountenance came to be like (a) black [...]; he said to her presump-tuously, \"You must render service to us,76 [as did] also your motherEve, for [...I.But Norea turned, with the might of [...]; and in a\"Pan. 39.5.2 (11, 75 Holl): yvvairchTLVa 11paLav kEyowni' ELvat 7011 LTI6.

Thom. log. 13 [35:5] should be readin the light of the latter passage).8077See Layton's commentary, 66, n.126; 67, n.130.The origins of these four Light-Givers-whose role was to oppose the evil powers by teaching Gnosis to the elect and bysaving pure women from the rapist archons-should probably be soughtinthe fourarchangels Raphael, Michael, Uriel, and Gabriel, who were sent by God (I Enoch 9-10), totight the Fallen Angels and their leaders; Apoc.

In the same vein, an interesting nnlrash (possibly of Jewish origin)is found in Augustine.In the fact that the Bible mentions names of women in the Cainite(but not in the Sethite) genealogy, he read an indication about the lustful nature of themembers of the \"earthly city.\"Augustine noted that the Bible concluded the list of theCainite generations \"with a woman, whose sex was responsible for initiating the sin throughwhich we all undergo death. Moreover, a further consequence of this sin was the advent ofcarnal pleasure to oppose the spirit.In fact, the name of Lamech's own daughter Naamahmeans pleasure (Nam et ipsa filia Lamech Noemma voluptas interpretatur)\" (City of GodXV.20: 534-535 in LCL vol. 4, trans.

(i.e., before the rise of Gnosticism, according to scholarly con-sensus), Jewish traditions identified Seth's sister as the maiden Naamah.On the other hand, the Death qf' Adani relates that Seth's sister was calledEsterah, but this is also the name of the maiden who, according to themidrash, escapes Shemhazai.It is thus no mere coincidence that the Jew-ish story of Esterah (Naamah) is so similar to the Gnostic tale of Norea(Naamah); the seduction attempt was foiled in the same way: the heroineis one and the same.The subsequent evolution of Esterah-Naamah-Norea is worth following.Islamic legends expanding upon Harut and Marut (Qur'an 2:102) are laterversions of the same myth.In the Islamic texts, the pure maiden isnamed Anahid, Bidukht, or Zukhra, and an Iranian etymology for Harutand Marut is probable.91 Moreover, Father Jean de Menasce has shownthat the original legend reflects early Indian and Iranian legends about thegoddess Anahita, i.e., Istahr or Venus.92 De Menasce states that \"In innerAsia, the Indo-Iranian legend came to merge with another cycle of storiesabout the fall of the angels .... \"93 De Menasce does not specify the dateof this merger, but the context implies that it happened at leasta few cen-turies before the Christian Era.If so, the Jewish legends which developedthe theme of the pure woman who had escaped the lust of the FallenAngels94 must have begun to circulate quite early.In apocryphal literature, Noah is believed to have remained untouchedby the corruption brought upon mankind by the sinful angels. Thereasonfor Noah's purity was his mother Batenosh,95 for ina generation in whichwomen copulated with the angels, she alone stayed pure, and Noah reallywas Lamech's son (despite his father's original doubts).96 Now Noah was91See G.

This could explainboth the fact that Naamah was considered to be Noah's wife in Jewishtraditions and the ambivalent attitude of these traditions toward her.97 Wetherefore find the following identifications of Naamah in Jewish traditions:Noah's Cainite wife; Noah's pure wife; or Seth's pure sister/wife. More-over, the legend about the pure woman who had escaped the lust of theangels was also attached to her name.The shift of the figure of Norea and of the myth from Noah's genera-tion to Seth's seems puzzling at first, but it may be explained in the con-text of Jewish theological thought. Noah and Seth are, in a sense, parallelheroes of the Urzeit.Like Seth, who is at the origin of the pure genera-tion of mankind, Noah the Righteous renewed human history (and thetransmission of the pure seed) after the flood.It is therefore not surpris-ing to find, already in the Enochic corpus, that the older Noah saga wassometimes transformed into a Seth saga.98 This shifting of the myth is alsoevident in the verse of the Death of Adanf quoted above. Stone writes,\"The etymology con(/biter for Seth is not found elsewhere, but it arisesfrom Gen 4:25 and should be compared with Jub 4:7.\"99 But if \"com-forter\" is not the usual etymology for Seth,100 it is the biblical one forNoah (Gen 5:29) and was taken over in apocryphal as well as in rabbinicliterature.101 In moving from Noah's family to Seth's, Esterah took withher the attributes of her former husband; thus the etymology of Noah'sname was simply transferred to Seth's.In this respect, then, the Armenian Death of Adam (or, rather,itsGreek or Syriac Vorlage) was indebted to early Jewish traditions. Nor isthere any reason to think that the Armenian text is a \"Sethian-Gnostic\"work (as did Preuschen, its first translator).102 Legends about Seth andAdam do not in themselves constitute a criterion of \"Sethianism,\" asStone rightly observes.103 A better criterion of Gnosticism is the salvificrole of Seth's wife/sister and her help in the preservation of the pureseed. And in the Death of Adanf, there is no hint whatsoever that Esterahplayed such a role (or any other).Some of the early Gnostics seem to have adopted the Jewish traditionsabout the deeds of Naamah, Noah's wife.In the process, the meaning ofthese deeds was inverted, and Naamah/Norea became a heroine strugglingwithherevilhusband.Epiphanius reportedthataccordingtotheNicolaitans, Noah would not let Norea enter the ark, since he was the97Pearson, \"Norea,\" 148 and n. 29.98See chap.

This deed,considered pure in both contexts, indicates that the Gnostic reinterpreta-tion of Naamah was not entirely successful since, as in the Jewish legend,she burned the ark in anger. Why would Norea want to embarkupon theevil Noah's ark? Why should she become angry when refused permissionto board?Such a desire, and such behavior hardlybefit a Gnosticheroine. As in the case of the angels' seduction of the women in Ap.John(supra, pp.36-38), the ambiguous function of Norea's behaviorin theoverall structure of the Gnostic version indicates that thestory wasadapted from Jewish traditions.The origins of the pure \"other seed\" (Gen 4:25), its transmissionthroughout human history, and its protection from the repeated attacksofthe archons were all problems of crucial importance for the Gnostics,105and mythological solutions for them were sought.The Gnostics thusunderstandably integrated all the various traditions theywere aware of intoanew myth, whose heroine became specificallySeth'ssister/wife,identified with the maiden-become-star.

John.110 where Barbelo wasnot only the \"virginal Spirit,\" but also \"the perfect aeon of glory,\" the\"First Thought,\" and \"the thrice male one.\" Although in this systemBarbelo was completely apotheosized as one of the eternal aeons andhence a principle of light in Gnostic cosmology, the origins of the figure(and its name) remain unclear.1111061n Hippolytus, Elenchos VI, 19 (145 Wendland).

Inone version of this myth, Batenosh, Noah's mother, played a distinct role:it was through her escape from the angelic seductors that the pure seedwas preserved.'15The Seduction of the ArchonsThe myth of the seduction of the archons represents the ultimate transfor-mation and inversion in Gnostic consciousness of the original myth of the,sin of the angels with the women. In Hyp. Arch. 89:17-30, the \"authori-ties\" of the demiurge had planned to approach the spiritual Eve and toseduce her, although it was only her shadowy reflection (the material Eve)whom they succeeded in raping. A similar attempt by the archons andtheirchief(the demiurge)torape Norea alsofailed(Hyp.Arch.92:18-93:13). In Ap. John 28:5-32,a parallel description of the rape of afeminine figure by the demiurge and his \"authorities\" is given. Here theseduction attempt is successful. The archons \"madea plan\" and \"com-mitted adultery\" with Sophia \"with whom the Godsare united and thedemons and all the generations until this day.\"116ee pattern in thesecases is similar to the description of the sin of thean/gels'in I Enoch W.In the Gnostic texts, as in I Enoch, the male heavenlypowers initiated theadultery.

The light/blood correspondsexactly to the semen of the (male) archons, which is also saidto be at theorigin of the lower Adam.Then each one of them [the archons whowere with the First Father]cast his semen (o-rrepga) in the midst of the navel of the earth. Sincethat day, the seven archons have formed theman: his body is liketheir body, his likeness is like the man who appearedto them. (Orig.World 114:2 7 - 32 )Now in Orig. World it was Sophia and Pronoia whowere held responsi-ble for the lustful process. Both behaved like \"female archons\"and par-took,withthearchons,inthe anthropogonic process where theyrepresented the \"female\" side of human genealogy.Pronoia did notsucceed in seducing \"the angel,\" justas the archons, in Hyp. Arch.87:11 -34, did not succeed in staining the heavenlyEve and Norea.As Incorruptibility looked down into the region ofthe Waters, herImage ONE: [ = C I NCD appeared in the Waters,and the authoritiesof the darkness became enamored of her. Butthey could not lay holdof that Image, which had appearedto them in the Waters, because oftheir weakness...for they were from below, while itwas fromAbove.The archons then concertedamong themselves and decided to create aman after the image \"of God that had appeape\"o them)in theWaters.\"121 The lustful attitudeof Pronoia thus seems to follow, mutatisnwtandis, the pattern of the mythof the union of the women and theangels in the version attestedin the Jewish sources (T. Reub.), in whichthe women seduced the angels.Although the original mythhad been transformed considerably, theinversion processwas not complete. Indeed, it seems that in the mythasit appears in Orig.

World. Unlike Pronoia, however, Barbelo started theprocess intentionally, not by her lust, and she succeeded in her attempt toseduce the archons.We shall see in chapter VIII how in Manichaean mythology the\"power\" of the female figure, also called her \"light,\" was captive in thesemen of the archons. As in Manichaeism, therefore, the act of seductionhere played a positive and specific role in the economy of salvation.In Gnostic vocabulary, Prunikos (\"the lewd one\") was one of thenames of Sophia. Although the paradoxical use of this name has alreadybeen studied,124 it has not yet been completely elucidated; the precedinganalysis might furnish another clue about the meaning of the name Pruni-kos. In order to perform her salvific role, the pure woman had to use theonly weapon available to her against the archons; through cunning, shehad to draw them into the trap through which they could be subdued: thecompulsion of their lust.Three different patterns of the sexual myth can thus be identified, andthey may well reflect various stages in its evolution. In the first stage, thefemale figure was the object of archontic lust.In the second (Orig.World), she herself behaved like an archon, led on by her lust, and in thefinal stage, the female heroine deliberately seduced the lustful archons.Giants and AbortionsAs shown above, Orig. World retained a specific version of the myth ofseduction, one which stood mid-way between the Jewish and the Mani-chaean versions of this myth.

Arch. 87:11-34).Similarly, asa consequence ofher lust, Pronoia becamepregnant by herself and immediately thereafteraborted the fetus.

As Pheme Perkins has shown, striking parallels to such\"biological metaphors,\" which play a major role in Gnostic cosmogonies,and especially to Erc$akkeiv (NOY.xe eBOX) as a term for abortion, arefound in the vocabulary of 2nd-century medical writers.134Sophia was indeed the first female heavenly figure to give birth to anaborted fetus. The event is explained in the following way in Ap. John9:25-10:7:And the Sophia of the Epinoia, being an aeon, conceived a thoughtfrom herself with the reflection of the invisible Spirit and Pronoia.She wanted to bring forth a likeness out of' herself without the con-sent of the Spirit-he had not approved-and without her consort andwithout his consideration....

MacRae points out that inAp.John 30:11 -31:25, the description of Pronoia's triple descent to the world in order to awakenman from his deep sleep is strikingly similar to the myth of Wisdom's descent, althoughSophia is not explicitly identified with Pronoia (\"The Jewish Background of the GnosticSophia Myth,\" NorT 12 [1970], 91).

A seedand a plant sprout, grow, and produce fruit only if they are watered; thusit is with the soul, which must be \"fostered with a fresh sweet stream ofwisdom\" in order to \"shoot up and improve.\"6 Later on, Philo attemptedto prove that from Seth to Noah, there was a progressive growth inknowledge and virtue.?In Quaest. Gen.1,78, Philo gave a different etymology for Seth,explaining the meaning of the name as: \"one who drinks water.\"8 Thisderivation of Seth from the Hebrew rootro mm?, \"to drink,\" sheds somelight on the first etymology, where Philo seems to have in mind a factitiveform of the same verb. Such a factitive form of unrm, however, does notappear to be attested in rabbinic sources.9lAs mentioned, the figure of Seth in various bodies of literatures has been studied onseveral occasions, especially by Klijn, Seth; see also M.

Onepassage statesthat Adam \"called him Seth because he was planted (5rrz), because thekingdom of the house of David was planted (M5r-11) from him.\"10 Else-where, this etymology was explicitly based on a word playupon .117 r1w(Gen 4:25).11 The name Seth, therefore, would derive fromthe root 5rm,\"to plant,\" and not from rirw, \"to drink.\"Like the firstone, thisetymology referred to the \"other seed\" of Gen 4:25. Since Philo'smeta-phor in Post. Cain. was a vegetal one, involving seeds and plants,onewonders whether he confused the flm etymology with the 5rwone andintegrated them in his explanation of the name's meaning.The derivation from P1 was also known in Gnostic milieusIn hisdescription of Manichaeism in the Fihrist, the 10th-century bibliographerIbn al-Nadim, following his Manichaeansource, reported that Adamcalled his son Shathil only after a lotus tree hadgrown from the earth (asa divine answer to Adam's prayer) to provide milk for the child.Then there appeared to Adam a tree called the lotus, fromwhichcame forth milk with which he nourished the boy. He called him byits [the tree's] name, and later he called him Shathil.12Since the Manichaean source clearly linked the child'sname to the grow-ing of the tree,13 it probably reflected thesame Hebrew etymology (fromthe root 5rart) already known to the Rabbis andperhaps to Philo.Shitil, the hypostatic figure of Seth, who playeda major role in Man-daean mythology,14 echoed thesame traditions.Shitil, son of Adam,wascalled \"the Perfect Plant,\" \"planted inthe generations and intheworlds,\"in the Johannesbuch,15 while the Right Ginza III,114:19ff.reported that Shitil nrgariih inasbh, \"approachedhis planter.\"16 Because1°Oxford ms. ofa nudrash on Genesis, quoted by M.

The complex traditions that developed about Adam do not directlybear upon the topic of this investigation, and it is sufficient hereto recallthat various Gnostic traditions showed a distinct tendencyto identifyAdam-or rather his heavenly counterpart, the First Adam,the &vOpcuTrocpar excellence-with the supreme God. As H. M. Schenke has shown,God came to be called \"Man'1120through the Gnostic exegesis of Gen1:26: \"to our image, according to our likeness.\"In a similar fashion,aheavenly counterpart for Seth was developed in Gnostic mythologyon thebasis of Gen 5:3, where Adam's son was born \"accordingto his likeness,to his image.\" Seth was the savior of mankind, since hewas the one who\"recovered\" the glory that had been Adam and Eve'sbefore their fall,which was caused by the demiurge. \"And the glory inour hearts left us,me and your mother Eve, along with the first knowledge that breathedwithin us,\" said Adam to Seth (Apoc. Adam 64:24-27).Thus Adamcalled his son \"by the name of thatman who is the seed of the great gen-eration\" (69:6-8); i.e., he gave him thename of the heavenly Seth, theplanter of the righteous seed.Seth then recovered from \"thegreataeons\" the glory that had left his parents.His mission was topreservethis glory against the repeated attempts of the demiurgeto steal it and,ultimately, to reinstate mankind in this gloryat the end of time, when thedemiurge and his followers would be subduedand destroyed.At thattime, Seth would reappear asa glorious savior.In some christianized Gnostic trends, thisparousia of Seth becameidentified with the advent of Jesus, whowas considered to be the earthlymanifestation of the heavenly Seth.This identification, which alsoappears in a magic text,21 is particularly evident in Gos.

Augustine, however,integrated this tradition into his own theological framework.

In A//ogenes 51:33-37, this\"PerfectChild\" was related to the \"triple male.\"At least two Gnostic texts clearly identified the child(or \"a littlechild\") with Jesus.37 However, since there isno evidence of an undisput-ably pre-Christian text in which the Gnostic o-wrjpwas characterized as achild,itis very difficult to know whether the widespread child imagehelped promote the identification of Seth with Jesus,or whether, con-versely,it was this identification which furthered the representation ofSeth as the perfect child.This child also appears as the revealer in Paraph.

Wenow know how inaccurate this descriptionis.The close relationshipbetween Gnosis and Jewish apocalypticism leaves no doubt as to theimportance of Heilsgeschichte for Gnostic consciousness. From this pointof view, the Apocalypse of Adam may be the most interesting of all thenewly discovered texts.Apoc. Adam presents us with a remarkabledescription of the mythical Child in a beautiful and puzzling hymnic sec-tion (77:27-82:29), which I propose to call \"The Hymn of the Child.\"Some studies of Apoc. Adam have considered this hymn to be a discretelyrical unit, describing a hitherto unknown myth that had somehow beeninterpolated into the prose sections of the text, which present a Gnosticvision of Heilsgeschichte.2 While a source analysis of Apoc.

Adanr:\"The shall live forever because they havenot been corrupted by theirdesire, along with the angels\" (83:14-17).Sakla, who was lower than his creatures Adamand Eve (64:16-17) iscalled \"god\" (TTNOYTe= 6 Ococ), like \"the eternal God.\" While thislack of technical differentiation in the Gnosticterminology of Apoc.

(69:11-18)10This passage refers to the offspring of Seth, a figure named \"by the nameof that man who is the seed of the great generation\" (65:7-8), and whoremained a stranger to the powers of the demiurge unlike his parents(65:18-19). Seth was thus described as the forefather of the Gnostics.These Gnostics would be saved from the flood by \"great angels\" who\"would come on high clouds\" in order to bring them \"into the placewhere the spirit of life dwells\" (69:23-24), i.e.,to their proper land,where the Great Seth \"will build for them a holy place\" (72:4-6).It isnoteworthy that since Noah was evil, the ark could in no way be a vesselof salvation for the Gnostics.To the Gnostics are opposed Noah, his sons, and their wives (see Gen6:18), who would be protected from the flood by Sakla (70:6-25). Adifficulty in the interpretation of the whole passage arises from the factthat Adam mentioned that Sakla would \"give power to his sons and theirwives by means of the ark\" (70:10-11).According to a literal under-standing, the first possessive article refers to the demiurge.Since Cainwas Sakla'sson,itwould followthattheauthor of Apoc. Adamtransformed Noah (A Sethite in the Bible) into a Cainite. This interpreta-tion, however, generates other problems in the understanding of the text,problems which are noted below. One could just as legitimately speculatethat the Nag Hammadi papyrus suffers here from a haplography, and thatthe original text paraphrased the Bible (Gen 7:7) and read: \"and he willgive power to Noah, his wife, his sons and their wives.\"11 As the price oftheir salvation, the demiurge made them swear not to mingle with theGnostics, who opposed him (\"and no seed will come from you of themen who will not stand in my presence in another glory\" [71:4-81). Inexchange, the demiurge undertook to establish them as rulers of the earth\"in a kingly fashion.\" Noah and his sons accepted the alliance with thedemiurge, and the earth was divided between Japheth, Ham, and Shem10Contra MacRae (\"Seth in Gnostic Texts and Traditions,\" 22), a description of the floodas an \"unsuccessful attempt of opposing powers to eliminate the race of Seth\" is not typicalof all the Nag Hammadi versions of the story; see Ap.

Lewis, A Study q/'the Interpretation q/'Noah and the Floodin,Jewisl: and Christian Literature (Leiden: Brill, 1968), who shows the identification Noah =Deucalion (which is found in Apoc. Adam) to stem from Hellenistic Jewish sources. Thesame identification is in Ps.-Clem. Hon:. 11.16.4 (41 Rehm).\"Thesame suggestion is made by MacRae in his edition (in D. M. Parrott, ed., NagHammadi CodicesV, 2- 5 and VI [NHS 1l; Leiden: Brill,1979]); see his note on 70:10.Bohlig's reconstruction of the corrupt line 10 also includes a haplography, \"Und er wirdschonen Noah and seine Sohne,\" but his reading [yNa]-[co MN Neq(9HPe, \"[he will]spare and his sons,\" is difficult.

"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"84THE GNOSTIC RACE(72:15-17). This remarkably sophisticated attitude of the demiurge is notto be found in the earliest strata of Gnosticism. As noted above, in theearliest stages of Gnostic thought,it was the Gnostics who sought toprevent mixture with the evil seed, while the latter tried to corrupt theformer by intermingling with them.In chapter II, we saw how the figure of Seth as a Righteous One wasrelated, in some Gnostic contexts, to that of Noah. We have also shownhow some of Seth's attributes in the apocryphal legends had in the earliestJewish traditions belonged to Noah (e.g., the \"etymology\" cony/brier forhis name and the identity of his wife Naamah).In Gnosticism theselegends were usually associated solely with Seth because of the central rolewhich Adam's son played in Gnostic mythology. Nevertheless, in variousGnostic contexts Noah remained a typical Sethite.In Epiphanius's tes-timony about the Archontics, for instance, Noah came from the offspringof Seth and was persecuted by the demiurge and his archons until Pronoiahelped him escape their evil schemes by means of the ark.12 In Irenaeus,Ac/v. Haer. 1.30.10 (1, 237 Harvey), Noah was saved by Prunikos, while inAp. John 29:1 - 11, Noah, informed by \"the greatness of the light of Pro-noia,\" hid in \"a place,\" i.e., in a \"luminous cloud,\" with \"many peoplefrom the immovable race.\" According to Great Pow. 38:21 -39:13, he andhis sons were moved \"from the aeon\" into \"the permanent places.\" Thetext recalls that before escaping the flood, Noah had preached piety for120 years, but no one listened to him.13 Hyp. Arch. 92:8-14 presents adifferent attitude to Noah's escape. On the one hand, he was saved by thearchon of the forces (i.e., Sabaoth, Yaldabaoth's repentant son).But onthe other hand, he did not really belong to the pure seed and refused tolet Orea into the ark.14 The ambivalent attitude of Hyp. Arch. towardsNoah seems to be intermediate between the earlier view of Noah as a\"faithful Sethite\" and his complete rejection in the trends represented byApoc. Ac/am.Itis only in later Gnostic trends, as a result of a greaterestrangement of the Gnostics from the biblical text and its traditional(Jewish and Christian) interpretations, that Noah was transformed intoone of the most devoted servants of the evil demiurge.This reasoning is, of course, typological, since texts with a positive viewof Noah could also be relatively late (e.g., Epiphanius's sources and GreatPow.). The same assumption can be applied,on logical grounds, to otherfigures: \"Cainite\" theology, for instance, in which Cainwas the firstrighteous one stemming fromthe Upper World(see Gen 4:1b),represents a typologically later stage in the evolution of the Gnostic myth.By making Noah the arch-servant of the demiurge, Apoc. Adam thus prob-ably reacted against a previous Gnostic stand.12Epiphanius, Pan. 39.3.1(Il, 74 Holl).In the next lines (sections 2 and 3), Epiphaniusreported how the angels, bringing evil into the ark, foiled the Mother's plan.t3Thistradition, obviously based upon Gen 6:3, is indeed common not only in ancientChristian literature, including the \"Gospel of Seth\" (see Preuschen, \"Adamschriften,\" 39),but also in rabbinic literature; see the texts mentioned by Ginzberg, Legends, V, 174, n. 19.14See Layton's remarks in his commentary, p. 62, n. 99. "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"GNOSTIC SALVATION HISTORY85After the flood, Noah, in his obedience to the demiurge, encouragedhis sons to remain fearful slaves of Sakla all their lives.Indeed, the dras-tic inversion of the biblical text was carried even further. While Shem'sname does not appear again in the text, there is a probable reference tohim: \"For the seed of Noah through his son has done all [Sakla's] will\"(74:17-18). In this literally \"antisemitic\" text, it is Shem, the Israelites'forefather, who was Noah's real heir and therefore altogether evil.On the other hand, \"the seed of Ham and Japheth will form twelvekingdoms\" (73:25-27). The text is here extremely difficult, andsomeambiguity remains. Like the offspring of Shem, the offspring of Ham andJapheth were also evil;itis probably to them that 74:3-7 refers: \"theywill go to Sakla their God...accusing the great men who are in theirglory.\" Yet they were not as completely doomed as the Shemites, sincethe Gnostics stemmed from them. The \"great men\" should be identifiedwith the 400,000 men from the seed of Ham and Japheth who \"will enteranother land and sojourn with those men who came forth from the greateternal knowledge\" (73:13-20).Striking parallels to these 400,000 menoccur in Manichaean literature, not only in Honi., as BOhlig noted,15 butalso in fragments of Mani's Book of Giants, where the 400,000 RighteousOnes were killed by fire, naphtha, and brimstone.16 The 400,000 men ofApoc. Adani should also be identified with those men whom the illumina-tor \"will bring into their proper land\" (probably a heavenly one, since itdid not belong to the \"dead earth\"), and who \"will be called by thatname\" (i.e., probably Seth's).It is said that \"they have been receivedinto another aeon from which they had come forth,\" and that \"they haveoverturned all the glory of [Sakla's] power and the dominion of [his]hand.\"Ham and Japheth, liketheir father Noah, belonged to theoffspring of Seth.Yet, they accepted their father's pact with Sakla andwere therefore sinful Sethites. On the other hand, the 400,000, who dis-sociated themselves from the seed of Ham and Japheth, were the sons ofPin Hont. 68:18, the 400,000 righteous ones are related to Enoch. See Bohlig's edition ofApoc. Adapt, ad loc. MacRae calls this parallel \"obscure\" (\"The Coptic Gnostic Apocalypseof Adam,\" Heythrop Journal6 119651, 29 and n. 1), while he himself mentions the fact that400,000 is the number of the tribe of Judah in Josephus's version of the Davidic census(Ant. 7.13.1).16Fragment i from the Kawan, in Henning, \"The Book of the Giants,\" BSOAS (1943),58, trans. 62.See also the Sogdian fragment G, ibid., 68-69 (the article is reprinted inHenning's Selected Papers, 11, 115-137).

The sugges-tion made earlier of an omission in 70:10 can now be justified on othergrounds. Had Noah and his sons belonged to the seed of Sakla (i.e., hadthey been \"Cainites\"), the 400,000 would have to be understood as con-verts to Gnosticism. Such a possibility is excluded by the rigidly racialtheology of Apoc. AdaptThree times the text insists upon the fact that in their proper land, theGnostics would remain pure: \"No foul deed will dwell in their heart(s)\"(72:12-13), they will be protected \"from every evil thing and everyunclean desire\" (73:23-24), they are \"the great men ...who have notbeen defiled, or will be defiled by any desire (E7n6uμia)\" (75:1-4).Ineach case, it is from lust that the Gnostics would be protected.Indeed,lust is directly related to the demiurge, his works, and his powers.It isnot clear, however, whether this defilement referred to a specific act,although it is possible that the text reflected the exegesis of Gen 6:1-4(dealt with in chap. VIaccording to which the \"Sons of God\" were,Sethites seduced by the charms of Cainite women.One question remains: Who were \"those men who came forth from thegreat eternal knowledge\" (73:18-20) whom the Gnostics joined, and whoprotect the Gnostics by \"the shadow of their power\" (73:21)? Accordingto the similarity already detected between 72:1-14 and 73:13-24, theyshould be identified with the \"angels of the great light\" (72:10-11).1therefore propose to identify them with the seed of the heavenly Seth.Just as Seth, son of Adam, had a heavenly counterpart, so did hisoffspring.17 Indeed, our text distinguishes the Great Seth from Adam'sson and calls him \"that man who is the seed of the greatrace\" (65:5-9).Yet some of the exegetical difficulties encountered by the modern readerof Apoc. Adapt probably stem from the theological problems of the authorhimself; as a result, not all ambiguities can be solved by a logical analysisof the text. The overall inversion of the biblical account could not avoidraising some crucial problems. Concerning Noah's genealogy, if he wasevil, how could he be a Sethite? Cainite theology, of course, solved thisproblem very neatly by transforming all Sethites into servants of the evildemiurge.Indeed Noah's problematic status may have played a role inthe emergence of \"Cainite\" conceptions. For developed \"Sethian\" theol-ogy, however, Noah could only be considered a sinful Sethite, since heobeyed the demiurge's orders and mingled withltheCainites, betraying thelaws of purity required by his lineage. Once the logical necessity of thetheologoumenon of sinful Sethites was established, the Gnostics mighthave found it already in existence (although not applied to Noah!), insome trends of Jewish exegesis.In any case, Apoc. Adam describes the opposition between the pure andthe evil seed as radical:itis over a kingdom of death that Sakla ruled.Under his sway, men learn about \"dead things\" (65:14-16).Actually,'7Ct. in the mythological system of Ap.

The Gnostics, on the other hand, \"work in theimperishable seed\" (76:7), and \"their fruit does not wither\" (85:1).Life,therefore, belongs to them-and only to them.It is eternal, like theirknowledge (65:10; 69:14-15). The Gnostics are, in a word, strangers tothe demiurge and to his powers; they belong to the holy angels in theaeons (65:18 -19; 69:17 -18; 76:5 -6). This alienation from the world anditsrules,amajor theme inGnostic symbolic language,has beenthoroughly analyzed by Jonas and Puech.'8 The Gnostics kept themselvesapart.In contradistinction to the kingdoms of the evil seed, all ruled bySakla, the Gnostics saw themselves as a \"kingless race,\" ruled by noone.'9 The theology of Apoc.

The illuminatorwas indeed theGreat Seth, as a parallel passage reveals:He [the Great Seth] passed through the three parousias whichI men-tioned before: the flood, and the conflagration, and the judgementofthe archons and the powers and the authorities. (Gos. Eg. III, 63:4-8)The third coming was thus the finalone; it brought the Gnostics everlast-ing salvation by destroying the kingdom of Sakla.Far from being a pattern peculiar to Apoc.

This isthe key to solving some of its mystery and to understanding the dramaofthe Endzeit.Actually the hymn is the response of the defeated powers toAdam's description of Heilsgeschichte. Indeed, it is put into their mouths,a fact which explains itsmythological, i.e., ahistorical, language.Thepowers of Fate can speak no other language, sincehistory is understoodmeaningfully only by those who know that it has a goal beyond the per-secutions which they suffer and that it ends in salvation. Only the Gnos-tics, who believed in the final parousia of the Great Seth, the illuminatorof Gnosis, could speak a historical language. At the end of time, how-ever, the powers would be so confused ordisturbed (77:5)27 that theywould be unable to understand how the Gnostics managed to suddenlycome to light and subdue them, or howthey were able to escape from\"this kingdom\" (77:25) and reach safety in their land of light.In the hymn the powers try, one after the other, to answer their ownquestion: \"Where did it come from?\" (77:22-23).28 This question wasinterpreted by the narrator: \"Where did the words of deception, which allthe powers have failed to discover, come from?\"(77:24-27).Thepowers, \"corrupted by their desire(E7rnOvμia) along with the angels\"(63:15-17; a reference to the Fallen Angels), belong to Sakla, the lustfuldemiurge. They are therefore blind to truth, and the hymnreflects theirdefeat; they are unable to perceive that their own kingdom wascoming toan end through the final adventof the savior. Their choir was composedof thirteen spokesmen, who must be seen as representing the twelveking-doms of the seed of Ham and Japheth plus \"the kingdom of another peo-ple\" into which the sons of Ham and Japheth had entered, as mentionedin the historical account (73:25-29).In this mythological account, thir-teen different versions of the final comingof the illuminator are given.All are incorrect, of course, since the powers are \"in error\"(77:21-22).In Adam's account, on the other hand, the illuminator appeared threetimes in history: once to save the Gnostics from the flood, once to rescuethem from the conflagration, and finally to separate the righteous onesfrom the doomed at the end of time.In the hymn, each spokesman presents his own conceptionof thesavior's advent, how each kingdom perceives the birth of a child andhisupbringing until he received \"glory and power,\" and how the childthuscame \"to the water\" (or \"upon thewater\"). The sentence, repeated ineach account, remains ambiguous.It may well refer to baptism, but couldalso be an image for \"coming into the world\" (both senses areattested27For this confusion of thepowers (or the archons) see e.g.,Pistis Sophia 1.27(38Schmidt-MacDermot).28acc9wne eB0A.

Ek. with the Great Seth. The reasonfor this ambiguity is inherentin the setting of the hymn. The only wayin which the kingdoms of dark-ness (or the angelswho ruled over these kingdoms) could describethecoming of the savior-child was in their ownlanguage of lustful begettingsand carnal births.They therefore were unable to see the real savior,whose origin owed nothing to such ways:\"[Out of] a foreign air, [from a]great aeon, [the great] illuminator cameforth\" (82:25-28; see 65:6-9).It was not only because of their innate blindnessthat the kingdoms' rulerscould not recognize the savior-child when heappeared. He hid himselfdeliberately;35 secrecy was part of the nature of his \"rescuetrips\" toearth. He had to remain hidden when appearing amongthe powers test hehimself become their prey and his seed fall into theirclutches.Similar descriptions of the hidden savior are foundin other Gnostictexts.In Pistis Sophia, it was Jesus's mission to save the repentantSophiaand bring her back to her proper place, thethirteenth aeon from whichshe had fallen.In order to accomplish this task, the powersfrom on highgave him a garment(Ev8vp.a) to prevent him from being recognized bythe archons of the sphere and of theaeons.36 (He is also said to haveappeared like Gabriel in order not to beidentified.)All the powers thusremained ignorant of Jesus, since the glory of hislight was hidden in him.Only atthe end of time would he wear his \"twogarments\" (thedifference between them is not quite clear, butpresumably one is his\"garment of light,\"37 while the other isconnected with his twin) andreveal himself in all his brightness, i.e., in thebrightness of \"the firstmystery.\"38 At last, when the time came, Jesus wore the garmentof lightand ascended through the aeons, while all thearchons, finally discoveringhim, were \"greatly troubled\" upon seeing his\"great light,\" his \"shiningglory.\"39 Here, therefore, Jesus, as opposed to the heroof the Hymn ofthe Pearl, never forgets his duty and does not appear as asalvator sal-vandus.The theme of the savior hiding in the world disguisedin garments whichpreserve his anonymity also appearsin other Gnostic texts. At the endofAp. John, Pronoia appeared three times in \"therealm of darkness\" withthe intention of shaking \"the foundationsof Chaos.\"She changed(BZNW 37; Berlin: Topelmann, 1969), 75-79.35For Appelles, similarly, Jesus \"lived his earthly life concealed from thecosmic powers\"(Hippolytus, Elenchos 6.38).361.7 (10 Schmidt-MacDermot). The theme of the garments put upon the saviorfigurealso appears in Justin's Baruch, where Elohim clothes Herakles,who accomplishes twelvelabors (Hippolytus, Elenclros 5.26-28; 131 Wendland).370n \"garments of light\" in Gnostic symbolism, see Puech,En qucie de la gnose, 11,118-122.38Pisiis Soplricr 1.10 (16-20 Schmidt-MacDermot).39 /hid., 1.1 1 (20-22 Schmidt-MacDermot).

Prof. the savior-revealer is portrayedas the Light, the Voice,and the Word, who was hidden \"in ineffable silence\" (46:5,11-13). Thetext describes his third appearance in these terms (47:16-19):\"And Iwore everyone's garments and I hid myself within them, and theydid notknow the one who empowers me.\"40 Or,even more explicitly (49:7-22),The [archons] thought [that I]was their Christ....In that place Iclothed myself [as] the son of the archigenitor, andI was like himuntil the end of his regime, which is the ignoranceof chaos. Andamong the angels I revealed myself in their likeness, andamong thepowers as if I were one of them, but among thesons of men, as if Iwere a son of man, even though I am Father ofeveryone.Ihidmyself' within them all until I revealed myselfamong my members,which are mine.In the same way, the Gnostic, imitatinghis savior, would \"strip off thegarments of ignorance and put on a shining light,\" i.e., Jesus (49:30-32;50:12-13). In Gos. Eg. Jesus is presentedas the luminous garment of thesavior, the Great Seth, \"the incorruptible, Logos-begottenone, evenJesus the living one,even he whom the Great Seth has put on.\"41In Al/agenes, a work much influenced by Neoplatonismbut which bearsno trace of christianization, the \"guardian,\"a heavenly figure sent toenlighten potential Gnostics, is saidto be hidden.42 Here, too, the Gnos-tic, like his savior, would be stripped ofthe garment of anonymity, andwould be taken up to the holy place, whichremained secret to the world(58:26-33).Other texts give various epithetsto the savior's attire of light, anddescribe how he wouldwear his \"unequalled\" or \"ineffable\" garment(Paraph. Shenl 39:1 -2). In Setheus,the perfect Gnosticsare presented asthe ones who, by imitating \"theonly begotten one hidden in Setheus\"are\"the hidden ones,\" i.e., \"thosewho truly are.\"43 The dialectic of thesavior's hiding and revelationiswell emphasized in the Manichaean40SeeMech.1:11.The vestment of the savior isprobably referred to in the nameC'he/kea, which is mentioned (undervarious forms) in Paraph.

Adam 77:18-27 did not see the illuminatoruntil he appeared for the third time and overruled them, and why eventhen they were unable to understand how he arose and how their kingdomcame to an end.(Similarly, in Pistis Sophia 1.57 the tyrants of the twelveaeons fought against Jesus in his garmentof light, desperately seeking toprolong their rule.)Troubled and blinded by the Phoster's appearance ingarments of light, the powers could not ask the right question and they\"used the name in error.\"They did not know the real name of thesavior, which was hidden from them; it was pronounced only during holybaptism among the Gnostics, the seed of Seth.45Because the child came to save the world from his heavenly abode, hisbirth is described in mythological language by the various kingdoms inways which accounted for the link between heavenand earth. Some ofthese ways are already familiar. The rape of a virgin by Solomon and hisarmies, unable to catch the virgin \"they originally sought\"46 (fourth king-dom), is reminiscent of Sammael's rape of the earthly Eve (instead of thedesired heavenly one) in Hyp. Arch. 89:17-28.47 The drop fallen fromheaven (seventh kingdom) and the god who loved a cloud of desire(tenthkingdom) call to mind the drop of semen of the archons at the origin ofthe anthropogonical process in the Manichaean myth told by Theodore barKhonai. This drop should also be connected with the light fallen into thesea in Orig. World 109, a text which alsooffers an interesting parallel tothe description of the sixth kingdom, in which the birth of the child waslinked to \"the desire of the flowers.\" Yet in Orig. World 111:8-28 thescene is somewhat different. Thefirst Psyche (Soul) generated the firstrose, and then the virgin daughtersof Pronoia generated other \"beautiful,fragrant flowers\" in a parthenogenesis inspired by their love of Eros. Asto the Muse who desired herself in order to become androgynous(ninthkingdom), her behavior recalls the sin of Sophia, who tried to generate anoffspring without her mate.44Keph. XLII, 107:16-18. The three vestments are made of wind, fire, and water respec-Lively.The Living Spirit took them off infront of the righteous ones (Keph. XXX,83:27-28). Mani was the last avatar of the Living Spirit; see CMC 86:1 -9.45Apoc.Adam 77:18-27; 83:4-6. See Me/ch. 16:12-16: \"1 shall pronounce my name asIreceive baptism [now] (and) for ever among the living and holy [names], and in the[waters], Amen.\" The link between baptism (and esoteric practices in general) and therevealing of the Name also occurs in other contexts, e.g.,Exceipia ex Theodoro 76.3-4, or80.3: \"He who was sealed by the invocation of the Father, the Son and the HolySpirit willnot be attacked by the other powers, through the three Nameshe is cleansed from the triadof corruption.\"460n this expression, cf. Apoc. Peter 71:5-9.47Compare the Ebionite virulent hatred of David and Solomon (Epiphanius, Pun.30.18.4;186 Klijn-Reinink). "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"94THE GNOSTIC RACEIn his edition of the text, Bohlig points to several parallels to the formof birth in each of the thirteen kingdoms. He remarks that in kingdoms1-4, the child's parents were human beings; in kingdoms 5-8, theywerematerial physical entities (physikalisch-materielle Grossen); but in kingdoms9-11, they appear as lustful Gods.48 Bohlig returned ingreater detail tothe possible origin of the various sayings of the hymn in his study\"JUdisches and iranisches in der Adamapokalypse des Codex Vvon NagHammadi,\"49 where he cites parallels from Jerome and Plutarchinvolvingrocks impregnated by clouds or by gods who deposited theirsemen uponthem and also refers to traditions concerning the birth and raising ofMithra, the typical end-of-time king.50 Yet,as Bohlig himself recognizes,the motif of supernatural birth for half-gods and heroeswas commonstock in Antiquity. Our task, however, is to try to understand theprecisesignificance of such themes in Gnostic contexts.In the descriptions of the twelfth and the thirteenth kingdoms,and ofthe kingless race-which, as MacRae rightly insists, isnot a fourteenthkingdom - Bohlig sees the presence of what he calls \"higherscientifico-philosophical entities\" Where naturwissenschaf lisch-philosophischeGros-sen).The main fallacy in his reasoning is his attemptto integrate thethirteenth kingdom-and the kingless race-into thesame category as thefirst twelve kingdoms.51The relationship between the twelve kingdomsand the thirteenth in thefirst part of the text and in the Hymnof the Child constitutes a crucialproblem for the understanding of Apoc. Adam.The question may be for-mulated more precisely: What does the thirteenthkingdom represent?48 Kopvsch-gnosrische Apokalypsen, 92- 93.491n Mysrerion and Wahrheit, 155-156.111bid156, referring to G. Widengren, Die Religionen Irans(Stuttgart: Kohlhammer,1965), 199ff. Thesame identification of a Mithraic motif (about the rock of the eighth king-dom) was made by E. Yamauchi, \"The Apocalypseof Adam, Mithraism and pre-ChristianGnosticism,\" in Eludes Mithra'iques (Acta Iranica,1ser., 4; Leiden - Liege -Teheran: Brill,Bibliotheque Pahlavi, 1978), 537-563.511t is on these grounds thatMacRae (\"Coptic Gnostic Apocalypse of Adam,\" 31,n. 1)rejectsBohlig'sparallelof thefourteenaeons mentionedinManichaeanliterature(\"Judisches and iranisches,\" 152,n. 3; ef.Schaeder, Gnomon 9 [19331, 353, n. 2).How-ever, these fourteen aeons appear in thecontext of traditions concerning Seth in Keph. X,entitled \"On the significance of the 14aeons, about which Sethel has spoken in his prsyer.\"The same number alsooccurs elsewhere; Keph. viii speaks about the fourteen trips of Jesusto the world. See also the Naassene quotationfrom Gos. T/ton.

Note further the four-teen demons under the leadership ofAriuth, \"the Ethiopian\"( = black) female demon(who might be connectedto the Islamic Haruth), inPistis Sophia IV.140 (362 Schmidt-MacDermot).In other passages of Pistis Sophia (onthe fourteen redemptions of PistisSophia), one can follow theevolution in Gnostic thought from 12 + 1to 13 +i.

Manichaeantraditions,moreover, developed a similarinterplay between twelve and thirteen,which probably shows affinities with earlier Gnosticspeculation.52In Antiquity, speculation about the number twelve generally referred tozodiacal conceptions. In Late Antiquity, in particular, the desire to escapeastral destiny was a common goal of religious life and appeared in other-wise widely different theologies. The soul could attain union with Godand salvation only by reaching the upper regions, above the zone of theplanets, i.e., by escaping from their power.53 For the Gnostics, too, salva-tion coincided with the escape from fate.54 So it is not surprising thatthetwelve kingdoms, or aeons, are identified in some Gnostic texts with thetwelve months. For the signs of the Zodiac represented fate Wμapj.t n)or the sway of the archons. The godof astral destiny was \"the god of thetwelve aeons,\" which stood for unredeemed history, ruled by the move-ments of the cosmos and the blind power of fate.\"The twelve monthscame to be as a type of thetwelve powers,\" according to Eugnostos84:2-4. Eugnostos is a work untouched by Christian influence (Soph. Jes.Chr. is its christianized version55), and it seems that only in christianizedGnostic texts were the twelve signs of the Zodiac associated withthetwelve \"kingdoms\" of Israel.These twelve aeons are also called, literally, children of the archons;Gos. Eg. testifies that they were conceived by Satan and his consort,thefemaledemonNabruel(whoisSakla'sconsortinManichaeanmythology).56 They were thus considered to be enemies of the Gnostics;the Gnostics had to fight them in order to break free from their bonds.Thus in Justin's Baruch, the twelve contests of Herakles areidentifiedwith his struggles against the twelve angels of Edem.57 In PistisSophia,similarly, numerous warnings are issued against the archons of thetwelveaeons, which correspond to the twelve repentancesof Pistis Sophia (1.57,110 Schmidt-MacDermot).In the same work, so typical of ripe(ordecadent)Christian Gnosticism,58 twelve saviors were symmetrically52L.

The saviors will sit in glory with Jesus in the thirteenthaeon, \"the place of heritage.\"59 In another passage of Pistis Sophia, thetwelve saviors of the treasures would become kings with Jesus inthe placeof the heritage of light.60In the mythology of the christianized Gnostictext of Pistis Sophia, we thusfind thirteen kingdoms; twelve representative ofthe tribes of Israel andanother, Jesus's real and perfect kingdom of light. Thisthirteenth aeon isalso called the place (T09roc) of righteousness (8&Kacoo-iivq)61and is men-tioned elsewhere as the thirteenth seal, wherethere is \"certainty ofrest.\"62 In Christian Gnosticcontext, therefore, the kingdom of Jesuswasconsidered to be the thirteenth kingdom, coming afterthe twelve \"king-doms\" of Israel.In Pistis Sophia, the chronological element isalmostcompletely non-existent.Elsewhere, however (in what probably reflectsan earlier expression of the same theme), the twelve revealersare said tobe successive reincarnations of the figure ofthe Righteous One, who\"visits during twelve periods, that hemay visit them during [another] oneperiod\" (Paraph. Sheer 48:2-5). Thesesuccessive \"visits\" are reminis-cent of the theory of the \"true prophet\" running throughhistory, typicalof the Jewish Christian theology exemplifiedin the Pseudo-Clementinewritings.Jewish-Christian influence might also be reflectedin Treat.

Like him, he appeared in suc-cessive reincarnations during history until his final appearance as JesusChrist (Paraph. Sheen 48:2-3).Itis significant that the revelation wasmade to Shem, who was viewed as a positive figure at a stage of Gnosticdevelopment when allbiblicalvalues had not yet been completelyinverted.His seed represented the Gnostics, like the 400,000 who camefrom the seed of Ham and Japheth in Apoc. Adam.For Christian Gnostics, as for all Christians, the coming of Jesus meantthe beginning of his kingdom.66 The thirteenth kingdom was strongly con-trasted to the first twelve, since it heralded the reign of justice and impliedrelease from destiny, imposed by the tyrant of this world upon his ser-vants.This total rupture was considered by the Gnostics not only interms of a historical revelation, but also of acosmic one. In various texts,Jesus is explicitly said to have changed the course of the physicalworld:But the Son of Man came forth from Imperishability, being alien todefilement. He came to the world by the Jordan river and immedi-ately the Jordan turned back.67This reinterpretation of Josh 3:7 - 17 (Joshua being the typosof Jesus),where Joshua stopped the river Jordan from flowing in order tolet theIsraelites enter the Promised Land, also appeared inHippolytus's reporton theNaasenes.68 The theme of the cosmic revolution launched byJesus's coming is best exemplified in Pistis Sophia, where Jesus explicitlysaid that he affected the Heimarmene and the Sphere, aswell as thoseupon which they both rule, byhaving them change the course of theirrevolution (from left to right) every six months, so that they would notbe free to make use of their influences (a?roTEXapara): \"I turned theirpaths for the salvation of all souls.\"69 The kingdom usheredin by JesusPresent and Future,\" in R.

The latter interpretation is found insome Christian (aswell as non-Christian) Gnostic works.It is not necessary to appeal toliterary influences in order to explain thepresence of the thirteenth aeonin a Christian context, for once itwas identified with the establishedchurch, the Christian Gnostic, too,was compelled to seek a higher abodefor his own salvation.Among the non-Christian texts, for which thethirteenth kingdom stillbelonged to the unredeemed world, Apoc.

He received glory andpower and thus he came to thewater.Although the appellation \"Logos\" forChrist is the adaptation ofan origi-nally non-Christian term,71 theuse of the word ryoc here suggests thatthis might bea reference to Christianity and to Jesus (who is also calledthe \"/ogos-begotten body,\"which Seth prepared for himself;see Gos.

However, if we add to it the various instances (including non-Gnostic Christian works) where Christ came as the thirteenth prophet orin the thirteenth generation, the presumption becomes much greater thatthe thirteenth kingdom of the Hymn of the Child indeedreferred toChrist's coming.Hesitancy on the part of some scholars to see a refer-ence to Jesus in this stems partlyfrom the commonly accepted early dat-ing of Apoc. Adam.74 Such an early dating, however, remains to beproved.On the other hand, my contention that its thoroughly inverted readingofbiblical history (specifically, the description of the Sethite Noah aswicked)probably does not reflect one of the oldest strata of Gnosticism arguesagainst the earliness of Apoc. Adam, at least on typological grounds; italsostrengthens the possiblity of reading a reference to Jesus in thewordXbyoc, since a later author could have been aware of Johannine Christol-ogy.In fact, the words of the thirteenth kingdom, as well as those of73C1'.

In the prose account of Apoc. Adam, it is said that at thetimeof the illuminator's third advent, the powers would \"punish theflesh of the man uponwhom the holy spirit has come\" (77:16-18). The figure remains mysterious. MacRaehassuggested that it might refer to a founder of the sect, arguing for \"a clear dependence ontheServant-Messiah tradition\" of Deutero-Isaiah. MacRae rejects the possibility of an allusionto Jesus; according to him the figure would be closer to theEssene Master of Justice than toa savior figure (\"The Coptic Gnostic Apocalypseof Adam,\" 27-35). Schenke (in Layton,Rediscovery, 11, 608) is not convinced by this suggestion.74Fora disclaimer of any substantial references toChristianity in Apoc. Adam, see P. Per-kins, \"Apocalypse of Adam: The Genre and Function of a GnosticApocalypse,\" CBQ 39(1977), 383-395, esp. 383; MacRae, \"The Apocalypse of Adam Reconsidered,\" SBL1972Proceedings (ed. L. C. McGaughy; Missoula: Scholars, 1972), 573-575. On the other hand,MacRae points out that \"there may be a trace of an extremely superficial allusion to Jesusof'Nazareth in the magic name(s) `Jesseus Nazareus Jessedekeus' which occur at the very endof the work,\" adding that \"the occurrence of such a name here proves very little exceptthatif itis a garbled form of the name of Jesus, the work can hardly antedate thespread ofChristianity (ibid., 573-574). For Schottroff, too, the work shows no Christianinfluence,although the thirteen kingdoms represent the author's opponents; see her \"AnimaeNatural-iter Salvandae,\" 78 and 96.A late dating for Apoc. Adam has been argued by 11. M.Schenke and W. Beltz, the former in his review of Bohlig and Labib's edition,OLZ 61(1966), 31 -32, the latter in his (unpublished) Habilitationsschrifl, Die Adam-Apokalypse ausCodex V von Nag Hammadi: Jiidische Bausteinein gnostischen Svsletnen (Berlin,1970),204-205, 215. For both scholars, the relatively simple mythology of Apoc. Adam impliesthemore complex developments extant in texts such as Gos.E,g., which represent the full-fledged Gnostic mythology. MacRae, who argues for an early dating of the work,rejectstheir arguments and adds, \"There is no reason to suppose that this transition[to Gnosticexegesis] was effected instantly in a highly developed way\" (\"The Apocalypse ofAdamReconsidered,\" 576). Yet this is precisely my argument against a very early datingof Apoc.Adaan, in which the inversion of biblical data is indeed \"highlydeveloped,\" more so than insome other Gnostic texts.Apoc. Adam need not be a work of 4th-century Gnosticism, asBeltz claims; nor is it representative of the earliest strata of Gnosticism.

Adam, the \"kingdom\" announced byJesus also remained under the sway of Sakla.As opposed to the thirteen kingdoms, Apoc.

Adam, then,' the Gnostics, unlike the rest of mankind, werenot enslaved by Sakla or his servants, the Noahites (65:20-21;71:1-4).The term yEVEa is not simply metaphorical, but refers directly to the bio-logical origin of the Gnostics-an origin which was not linked to Eve'srape by the demiurge. Again it is \"out of a foreignair\" that the GreatSeth (or his avatar, the illuminator) was said to have come (82:25-26).In other words, he might be called the 61llrxoyev-4c par excellence.82 Theseed of Seth is described as \"those who will receive his name upon thewater\" (83:5-6).This terminology clearly reflects a baptist theology.Indeed, in the last part of Apoc. Adam, the Gnostics are described as abaptist group in a way which clarifies their opposition to the thirteen falsedescriptions of baptism in the Hymn of the Child.The last section of the text (83:4-85:18) has been interpreted as an\"anti-baptismal polemic.\"This polemic has been studied by FrancoiseMorard,83 who accepts Charles Hedrick's theory about the two sources ofApoc. Adam. According to Hedrick, both sources were Jewish, one lessthoroughly apocalyptic than the other, and they were integrated, ratherloosely, by the editor of Apoc. Adam.84 Based on this, Morard reaches theconclusion that the polemic was directed against a Gnostic baptist group towhich the author had belonged before he rejected baptism.85 Moreover,Morard argues for a direct link between this anti-baptismal polemic andMani's rejection of baptism.86 Her argument, however, is much weakenedby the fact that she ignores the last lines of Apoc. Adam, which praise \"theliving water\" and \"the holy baptism of those who know the eternalknowledge.\" This baptism is specifically defined by the author as the hid-den knowledge given by Adam to Seth (85:22-26).With this\"living water\"are associated Yesseus, Mazareus, andYessedekeus, the three \"imperishable illuminators who come from theholyseed\"(85:28-31).87Inparalleltothesethreemysterious81Clement, Stront. 3.4.30 (II, 209-210 Stahlin).82Fora phenomenological study of this theme, see Puech, En quf to de la gnose,I,207-213.83\"L'Apocalypse d'Adam du Codex V de Nag Hammadi etsapolemiqueanti-baptismale,\" RSR 51(1977), 214-233.See also her \"The'matique de I'Apoc.

Having defiled the water of life, you have drawnit within the will of the powers to whom you have been given to servethem.\"Micheu, Michar, and Mnesinous appear in other Gnostic texts, both withand without Christian influences.88 In Gos.

III, 64:14-15, they arecalled \"they who preside over the spring of truth\" and are linked to\"Yesseus Mazareus Yessedekeus,\" here regarded as a single figure alsocalled \"the great attendant.\" Similarly Trim. Prot. describes how the bap-tizers ($a7rTm0'T7'J4;) Micheus, Michar, and Mnesinous immerse the savior,during one of his comings, \"in the spring of the[water]of life\"(48:18-21).For Zost., Michar and Mi(cheu?) are \"these powers uponthe living waters\" (6:9-10).In all these contexts, they are unambigu-ously positive figures.

This is how Morard seems to understand both the passage, which iscentral to her argument, and the text in general.It is probable, however, that all previous understandings of the passagehave been based upon a mistranslation.Together with MacRae andBohlig, I wish to suggest that \"Micheu and Michar and Mnesinous, whoare over the holy baptism and the living water\" should be understood as agloss by the redactor, ntroduced by the preposition xe, \"namely,\"89 andindicating the provenance of the voice.90 Ifso, the passage would read:Then a voice came to them (xe [from] Micheu and Michar andMnesinous, who (are) over the holy baptism and the living water),the list of the three names refers to a single entity (111, 66:10-11; IV, 78:12-14).88See the note to Apoc.

Adam,but she errs in calling it anti-baptismal. The author did not speak againstbaptism, but on the contrary was himself a \"real\" baptist arguing againstfalse baptist theologies and evil baptist groups. The Gnostics, representedby the three \"baptizers,\" attacked those who defiled the water of life byhaving \"drawn it within the will of the powers,\" whom they served(84:18-23). The vituperativeness of the tone here is similar to that at theend of the hymn (\"in order that the desire of those powers might besatisfied\" [82:18-191).It thus stands to reason that the author wasagainst the Christian \"perversion\" of baptism.Therefore, although noprecise dating can be offered, Apoc. Adam was apparently written no ear-lier than the middle of the 2nd century C.E.Consequently, the relation-ship between Apoc. Adam and Christian Gnostic texts such as Gos. Eg. canbe tentatively reevaluated.Gos. Eg., which shows, at least typologically,clear signs of a later development, should not be viewed as a later evolu-tion(either literary or theological) of the trend represented by Apoc.Adam.92 Instead, this work should be seen as emerging from theologicaldevelopments inside christianizing Gnostic trends, while Apoc. Adaptrepresents a reaction to these very trends.Cataclysms, Steles and Advents of'the Sa viorBohlig has made a case for a specifically Iranian origin for some of themythological elements in Apoc. Adani.93 At the heart of such an argumentis the implicit assumption that the long political supremacy of Iran in theNear East must have influenced indigenous theologies.A pervasiveIranian influence is evident, for example, in Jewish apocalypticism.94 YetApoc. Ac/ant, like all Gnostic literary works, was written several centuriesafter the end of Iranian rule, so direct Iranian influence on this literature isonly a remote possibility. Therefore, it is preferable to speak about possi-ble convergences between Gnostic (or Jewish) and Iranian thought, ratherthan about influences of one on the other.95More precisely, Bohlig's argument for the Iranian influence on Apoc.Ac/ant depends upon the work's alleged tripartite view of history.Bohligrecalls that IranianHei/sgeschichte, from Parthian times, mentioned a91Crum, Coptic Dictiuncny, 468a.92As first suggested by Doressein his commentary on Gos.

Adam, which could best be understoodas Iranian. This isnot the case.First, any Heilsgeschichte is bound to speak ofa decisivefight at the Endzeit, so the third advent of the illuminator doesnot consti-tute evidence of direct Iranian influence. Moreover, the mythic elementsof the Hymn of the Child that Bohlig sees as borrowed from the Mithrasaga were, in fact, common stock in Late Antiquity.98I shall try to show here that there is no need to appealto Iranian con-ceptions in order to understand the periodization of history in Apoc.Adamand in other Gnostic texts; rather, it probably stemmed directlyfrom theJewish background of Gnosticism.Properly speaking there is no tripartite division of historyin Apoc.Adam. Instead, the text describes three major events in worldhistory. Tothese correspond the three advents of the illuminator of knowledge,whocame to save his seed and who, each time, ushered ina new period.It issomewhat misleading to state that the illuminatorcame during the thirdperiod, since he came to sealit and to inaugurate the fourth, lastingperiod; the reign of his race, liberated at last from thethreats of the demi-urge.

Such speculation wasbuilt around the four lights(C007r)pcc), the powers of understanding,grace, perception, and prudence. These four lights, placed on the fouraeons, were named Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithe, and Eleleth; they weresaid to have stood by the divine Autogenes (Ap. John 7:30-8:28).100 Itshould be stressed that the quadripartite division bears no similarity to the\"four empires\" speculation, which was widespread in the Hellenistic NearEast since the early 2nd century B.C.E.It was as a tool of political ideol-ogy, viz., anti-Hellenistic propaganda, that the pseudo-historical concept ofthe four world empires functioned.101 Macedonia was said to have suc-ceeded Assyria, Media, and Persia as the fourth evil kingdom. This fourthkingdom, therefore, would be followed by a fifth, lasting kingdom (seeDan 2:44).102In \"Sethian and Zoroastrian Ages of the World,\" Carsten Colpeattempts to integrate Bohlig's Iranian hypothesis about the \"tripartition oftime\" with Schenke's analysis of the \"Sethian system\" as evolvingaround the four great aeons.103 Colpe analyzes the evidence of cosmologi-cal, historical, and eschatological partitions of time in both Gnostic andZoroastrian texts and observes that the Gnostic (\"Sethian\") and theIranian texts show strikingly parallel patterns of both three- and four-partdivisions. More precisely, a similar formal \"fusion\" of the two differentpatterns can be found in both contexts. However, since \"the substantivedifference between the two doctrines of time or ages is great enough toexclude direct influence in either direction,\" Colpe concludes that the\"There is here no need to explain, as Tardieu does (Trois Mythes, 81, n. 236), the fourthposition given to the kingless race by the properties of the tetractys in Pythagorean literature.As we shall see, this can be understood from the internal logic of Gnostic Heilsxeschichte.The three kairoi of archontic rule are again referred to in Hyp.

Adam explicitly describes the dangers fromwhich the illuminatorrescued the Gnostics in his first two advents:the flood in the days ofNoah, and the fire, sulphur, and asphaltthat the powers of the demiurgethrew upon them in their land (obviously Sodomand Gomorrah,see Gos.Eg. III, 60:9-18). However, thetext does not describe the cataclysmsentby the demiurge the third time before theparousia of the illuminator ofknowledge. Only alter mentioning thisthird coming does thetext revealthe purpose of his salvatory advent: \"Andhe will redeem their souls fromthe day of death. For the whole creationthat came from the deadearthwill be under the authority of death\" (Apoc.Adam 76:15-20). The \"dayof death\" is a clear referenceto the end of time. Through thethird com-ing of the illuminator, it is connectedwith the flood and the destructionofSodom and Gomorrah. Suchan association of the three events isnot ori-ginal here, but is already found inapocryphal and New Testamentallitera-ture on the ethical depravity of mankindat each of these times.105The parallelism between theGenesis flood and the punishmentofSodom and Gomorrah couldnot have come directly from the biblicaltrad-ition, since the Bible inno way presents the latter eventas being ofworld-wide dimensions.But we know fromother Jewish sources ofatradition about two catastrophesthat were to befall the world,one involv-ing water and the other fire.Philo retains the clearestevidence for thesetraditions.In De Vita Mosis, he notedthat some sinners, in rejectingvir-tue,not only became enemies ofmankind but also broke cosmicharmony.1°6 God thereforepunished themon a cosmic scale both times.Indeed Philo mentionedthe two catastrophes together-\"Forthe mostforceful elements ofthe universe, fire andwater, fell upon them,so that,as the times revolved,some perished by deluge, otherswere consumed byconflagration\" 107 andidentified them with thebiblical flood and the des-truction of Sodom andGomorrah.These two catastropheswere also foretold in Adam and Eve.

This implies thatthe stele of brick was destroyed in the flood, and that the fire, whichwould have destroyed the stele of stone, never came. Josephus, there-fore, appears to be inconsistent: after having mentioned the prediction oftwo destructions of mankind, his words imply that only one occurred.This contradiction arises from the biblical text itself: after the flood, Godpromised not to curse the earth and smite the living any more (Gen 8:21).The tradition of the two upheavals had to be reconciled with another tradi-tion, which emphasized that only one cataclysm had occurred. Of course,Josephus was unable to successfully harmonize these opposing traditions.Indeed, in the numerous later Jewish midrashim and Christian chronicleswhich variously relate the same myth of the early destruction of mankind,only one catastrophe was involved, either the flood or a fire.II IAnother mythic motif, related to the two tablets of Adant and Eve andthe two steles of Josephus, appears twice in early Jewish texts.In Jub. 8:3itissaid that Cainan (son of Arpachshad inthe.

The contents of thefirst tabletare unknown, but the secondfragment is a copy of Enoch's second tablet.It announces the coming of Raphael, who will destroy mankind andanimals in response to both the Watchers' prostitution and the evil worksof their children.Here, too, the transmission of antediluvian knowledgeor wisdom to later generations-the purposeof the pervasive mytholo-goumenon of the writing on tablets or on rocks-seems to be connectedwith either the Watchers or Enoch.115 As in later Jewish and Christiantraditions, only one catastrophe, the flood, is mentioned.Since the negative attitude to astronomy recorded in Jub. is not main-tained in later traditions, the authorship of the steles is not attributed else-where to the Watchers.

Once the destruction ofSodom and Gomorrah was seen as parallel to the flood, a \"need\" for sym-metry could account for the association of each of the two writings presentin an earlier Jewish form of the myth with each of the two cataclysms.As noted, however, the tradition about a second upheaval after theflood ran counter to God's promise in the Bible. In even later Jewish andChristian traditions, therefore, the second event became identified notwith the punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah, but with the \"day ofdeath\" associated with the advent of the savior at the end of time. ThusSyncellus could write:In Adam's 270th year Seth, snatched up by angels (&pnrayeic virbayye),cov), was taught about the transgression which the watcherswere going to commit and the coming cataclysm by water and theadvent of the Savior. 119edited by A.

That these traditions reached Gnostic circles isclear from their appearance in the Gnosticsources; it is my contentionthat they reached Gnostic circles directly from Jewishsources, without themediation of Christian literature and traditions. Apassage of Pistis Sophia,hitherto unnoticed in this context, providesa striking analogy to the tradi-tion about Enoch's two writings against the Watchers (in the fragmentsfrom 4Q). Here Enoch is said to have written thetwo books of Yeu inparadise at Jesus's command; they were then depositedupon the rock ofArarat in order to be protected from the flood and the archonsuntil Jesuswould reveal their mysteries to the righteous.121 In thesame vein, theCologne Mani Codex mentions an Apocalypse of Sethel, in which Sethel(son of Adam) received from great angels the revelation ofthe secretknowledge contained in books (EV 'rat's ypa4aic, 52:1-2).The samework cites an Apocalypse of Enoch in whichan angel ordered the hero toinscribe the secrets told to him oncopper tablets (ETri inTVXac XaXtcag)and to hide them in the desert (54:11-15).Gos. Eg. is presented as writ-ten by the Great Seth and placed upon a mountain (111, 68:1-13), whileaccording to Apoc. Adapt, the holy wordswere not committed to a book,but were engraved \"on ahigh mountain, upon a rock of truth\"(85:3-11).As Gnostic circles developed an antinomian reading of Genesis,theycame to see both the flood and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah(the two cataclysms predicted by Seth)as sent by the demiurge in order toannihilate them, the righteous seed of Seth. On each of theseoccasions,Seth (or the Illuminator) was made tocome and save his offspring, a com-ing similar to the advent of the saviorat the end of time (\"the day ofdeath\" of Apoc. Adapt 76:16-17). The Gnosticsthus spoke about threeadvents of the illuminator.Enosh (Seth's son) means \"man\" in Hebrew, thesavior, being called \"son of Man,\" wasalso son of Enosh (\"the real man,\" who had been \"the firstto hope to call on the name ofthe Lord God,\" Gen 4:26).Jesus was thus the perfect offspring of Seth.See Pseudo-Malalas 9: \"Enoch was (of the line of) the righteousSeth, from whom Christ is descended,whose genealogy the holy and pious Luketraces back to Seth and Adam and God.\" SeeLuke 3:38.120Seealso CMC 50:8-52:7.

(Gos. Eg.III,63:4 -8)Various echoes of the same threefold pattern may be detected in somerather diverse Gnostic contexts.In the highly idiosyncratic system of theSimonian Apophasis Megale, the Hestos (he who stands) represents God'screative activity in cosmic evolution. He is said to appear three times, inthree successive phases or \"aeons\" (past, present, and future).122In its new mythological framework, Mandaean theology carried thelogic of the third catastrophe a step further by giving a specific name tothis event.Three catastrophes befell the Adamites in three periods orgenerations: first the sword, then the fire, and finally the water.TheUthras (heavenly entities), Hibil, Sitil, and Anos, presented as prototypesof the righteous Mandaeans, were said to have been saved from thesecatastrophes. 123The same conception of three advents of a heavenly figure also occursin an interesting Ismalili text. According to the Kalani-i-Pir,124 the Divin-ity (Maulana, \"Our Lord\") manifested itself in each generation in themost perfect human form. During the first three generations of mankind,Maulana appeared under three different names which are, in fact, varia-tions upon Melchizedek's name or title (nielekh gale»t, King of Salem,Gen 14:18). The people of the first prophet, Adam, were the Sabaeans.They identified Melchizedek with Seth and said that at the resurrection hewould appear as a judge and as a revealer of the teachings kept secret dur-ing history.Melchizedek appeared again during the generations of Noahand Abraham, i.e., at the time of the flood and of Sodom's punishment.125122t{ippolytus,Elenchos 6:17.1-2 (142-143 Wendland); see J.

Hereagain, the \"need\" for mythological symmetry probably accounts for themention, in one of the Gnostic sources, of \"the three steles\" on whichthe secret knowledge of the Gnostics was preserved.This is how weshould understand the title of CG VII1 5, \"The Three Steles of Seth,\"which Dositheos supposedly discovered, read, understood, remembered,and finally transmitted to the elect ones (118:10-19).126 Dositheos hereplays a role parallel to that attributed to Cainan in Jub. The suggestionthat he had to decipher them before they could be understood by others isa topos of the \"discovered steles\" literature in the Hellenistic world.127According to CG VIII, 1, the three tablets were written by Zostrianos, thebearer of the revelation, who \"saw the perfect Child\" (Zost. 2:9).

In contrast to their tribulations in this world of error and fate,the elect would be able to rest36 in this permanent \"place of pasture\" ofSeth.37From its heritage of Jewish eschatology and the Jewish historical con-cept of salvation, Gnostic mythology retained, although dimly, someambiguity as to the temporal existence of this new Holy Land; it did notbelong only to the timeless Pleroma. Since it was a place of salvation,38the Gnostics in some sense belonged there already, hic et nunc.Theilluminator could take them there in the event of a direct threat from thedemiurge and his powers (see Apoc.

TheHymn of the Child, with its thirteen repetitions of \"and thus he cameover the water,\" is a typical example of this ambiguity, which was centralto Gnostic mythology.44 According to Justin's Baruch, there were twokinds of waters.45 To the material waters below (Treat. Seth 50:16)correspond the spiritual waters above (Melch. 8:1; Zost. 18:6-9), whichwere the \"living waters\" (Setheus 61:15-22), those of the true baptism.46Water, indeed, was profoundly ambivalent: while Protennoia said, \"I amhidden in the [radiant] water,\" the father of the flesh was also identifiedwith the water (Great Pow. 38:20). More precisely, water was associatedwith evil sexuality (Paraph. Shear 4:30). We have seen in chapter II howthe acts of lust at the origin of anthropogony were described as the fall ofa drop of light on the water (Orig. World 113:23).Gnostic water imagery also made use of biblical themes: \"The water ofthe Jordan is the desire for sexual intercourse\" (Testinr. Truth 31:1-3).Here, again, the savior would radically reverse the trend, the stream ofmatter, and transform the water of lust into the water of life.Testinr.Truth 30:20-23 describes how \"the Son of Man came to the world by theJordan river, and immediately the Jordan turned back.\" Hippolytus, in hisreport about the Naassenes, related the same tradition about the Jordanflowing backwards (Tote E1ri Ta auto pcuo-avToq 'Iop&iavov). This reversalof the Jordan was considered by the Naassenes to be one of \"the threegreat mysteries.\"47 In their imagery, \"the Jordan flowing back\" (i.e.,\"up,\" avw) should be seen as the counterpart of the tides of the ocean,that gave birth to gods, according to ancient Greek mythology: oTav fieavw ...

In the 4th century, Aphrahat, the first Syriac Father,adopted the \"Sethite\" interpretation ofour passage.25 Ephrem, too, dwelton it, strongly rejecting the idea that the Sons of God were angels,an ideawhich, he said, was favored by the Manichaeans.

When the floodcame, the sinful Sethites unsuccessfully tried to climb up the holy moun-tain again to beg Noah to let them into the ark-but in vain. In the wordsof David (Ps 82:6-7), those who had once been called Sons of God per-ished on account of their sin.31Both Alexander and Klijn reject the possibility of a Jewish origin forthis exegetical trend because only later rabbinic texts made mention of it.But any argument based upon the lateness of rabbinic sources should bemade very cautiously, since very early traditions were often transmittedamong the Jews orally, over a long period of time, before they were com-mitted to writing. Yet the crux of the matter lies elsewhere: Is it indeedtruethatthereisno record before the time of Africanus of anidentification of the Sons of God with the sinful Sethites among the Jews?Alexander seeks to show that at an early date the identity of the Sonsof God and of their sons (the Nephilim) was already felt to be problematicin Judaism. The Targumim, for instance, translate benei elohim as \"thesons of the nobles\" (bt42131 '3s) in Onqelos andPseudo-Jonathan) or as\"the sons of the judges\" (Kr\"l vs, in Neofiti).32 For Alexander, the firstdatable rejection of the identification of the Sons of God with the FallenAngels appeared in the mouth of R. Simeon b. Yohai, who flourished inPalestine in the mid-2nd century c.E.: \"R. Simeon b. Yohai called them[the benei elohim] the sons of the nobles; R. Simeon b. Yohai cursed allwho called them sons of God.\"333196 Bezold; trans. 23. The same story is found in the Chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysius (10Chabot; trans. 7).For later Syriac works (mainly commentaries on the scriptures) thataccept the same exegesis, as well as for parallel passages in the Byzantine historiographers(who ultimately draw upon Africanus), see Dexinger's and Klijn's monographs cited supra.Another important source is the Palaea Historica, which describes how the sons of Seth, see-ing that the daughters of Cain were beautiful, married them and learned through them toabandon God (196 Vasiliev; cf.108, n. 116 supra). The Greek authors were able to findanother scriptural justification for the \"new\" exegesis.If the Sethites were called \"Sons ofGod,\" it followed that Seth, their father, was called God. (This idea does not appear in theCave of Treasures, contra Klijn, Seth, 40, n. 44.)And indeed, they could read LXX Gen4:26b in this light: ovroc 1Xrno-ev c?JLKaXeio'Bac To' iivoμa rcvpiov rov Ocou. Taking the mid-dle form for a passive and making Seth, rather than Enosh, its subject, they could under-stand that Seth \"hoped to be called by the name of the Lord.\" See, for instance, Theo-doret, Quaest. in Gen. 47 (PG 80, 147 C). Confusing names, Cassian (4th century) said thatthe quest for God began with Enoch, one of the \"Sons of God\" (Co, /J rences VII, 21-22 onGen 6:2, cited by L. Cirillo, \"Les vrais Pharisiens,\" RHR 191 (1977], 124). Once Seth wasconsidered to have been called God, justifications were sought. Anastasius Sinaita referredto the fact that he was in the image of Adam, i.e., ultimately in the image of God (cited byGrunbaum, Be/wage, 247), while Cedrenus referred to the brilliance of his face (16 Bekker).In any case,it should be noted that applying the name \"God\" to Seth must follow theidentification of his offspring with the Sons of God and not vice versa (contra Klijn, Seth,40).32See references in \"The Targumim and Early Exegesis of 'Sons of God,\"' 60.In otherverses in the Bible, elohim was understood as meaning \"judges.\" Onthe ambiguity of thisword, see Jerome's commentary on Gen 6:2, Quaest. Hebr. in Gen, CChr 72, 9.33Gen. Rab. 26:5,2 (247- Theodor).This passage is important because of Simeon b.Yohai's links with angelological tradition. See Alexander, \"The Targumim and EarlyExe-gesis of `Sons of God,\"' 61 and n. 6. "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"130THE GNOSTIC RACEAlexander also cites contemporaneous evidence from Justin Martyr'sDialogue (79.1), where Trypho (the Rabbi) criticizes Justin for thinkingthat angels could have defiled the women (cf.I Apology 5.2) in theseterms:34The words of God are indeed holy, but your interpretationsare con-trived, as is evident from those which you have given-naymore,they are blasphemous, for you affirm that angels have sinned andrebelled against God.What Alexander has shown is that from the 2nd centuryon, the \"angel\"interpretation was more and more strongly rejected by PalestinianRabbis,who were \"engaged in a polemic against angelology.\"35 That interpretationclearly referred to the angelology developed inI Enoch 6ff.Indeed,Tg.Ps.-J. still renders \"the Nephilim\"as \"Shemhazai and Azael, thosewho fell from heaven\" (although the \"sons of God\" had alreadybecomefor him \"sons of the nobles\"!). Alexander thinks that thenew exegesis\"originated with the rabbis shortly after the Second JewishWar,\" as areaction against those Tannaim who taught and transmitted\"esoteric,Gnostic doctrine,\" of which the \"glorification\" of angelswas only apart.36But a passage from Philo shows that this trend existedas early as the1st century. We have alreadyseen that Philo was the bearer of Hebrewtraditions which he did not always completely assimilate,or to which hegave a new meaning. Concerning the birth of the giants and their fathers'identity he said rather confusedly:But sometimes he calls the angels \"sons of God\" becausethey aremade incorporeal through no mortalman but are spirits without body.But rather does the exhorter, Moses, giveto good and excellent menthe name of \"sons of God,\" while wicked and evilmen (he calls)\"bodies.\"37Philo's hesitation is strikingly similarto that of Africanus.It shows thatalready in 1st century Judaism thereexisted, side by side, at least twoconflicting interpretations of the Sonsof God. While some understoodthis term as referring to angels, othersrejected such an interpretation andtook 'Sons of God' to bean epithet for certain righteous men, as opposed341bid., 62.35/bid.,68.361bid71, 69.

On the basis of Quaest.in Gen. 2.79 (170 LCL), which refers to oirE'pAaETEpov, Klijn (Seth, 26-27) argues that Philowas \"the first Jewish author to take as hispoint of departure the idea that Sethwas 'another seed.' \" These words are explained asreferring to another \"race,\" namely, therace which began with Seth and led up to Abrahamand Moses.

While all the Jewish texts analyzed by Alexanderrejectedthe angelological interpretation of the biblical verses, none of them expli-citly identified the Sons of God with Sethites.However, another source does seem to imply such an identification.InAnt. 1. 69-71, Josephus described the pure life of the offspring of Seth intheir country, asserting that one of the two steles which they had erectedwas still visible in the land of Seiris (i.e., in the samecountry). He added:For seven generations these people [the progeny of Seth] continued tobelieve in God as Lord of the universe and in everything to take vir-tue for their guide; then, in course of time, they abandoned the cus-toms of their fathers for a life of depravity. They no longer renderedto God His due honors, nor took account of justice towards men, butdisplayed by their actions a zeal for vice twofold greater than they hadformerly shown for virtue, and thereby drew upon themselves theenmity of God. For (y&p) many angels of God now consorted withwomen and begot sons who were overbearing and disdainful of everyvirtue....38Then Noah, having in vain urged the Sethites to amend their ways, leftthe country (i.e., the land of Seiris) with his family.In Josephus's textthe yap explicitly links the paraphrasis of Gen 6:1 -4 with the precedingsentences.It appears quite clearly, therefore, that the \"life of depravity\"of the Sethites was explained by the union with the women.It followsthat the only way to make sense of Josephus's statement is to assume thathe identified the \"angels of God\"39 with the evil Sethites of the seventhgeneration, and that by \"women\" he implied Cainite women, even thoughhe used the term ayyEXoc, which stems from the other exegeticaltradition.40 Moreover, it was because of the sinful ways of the Sethites,not the angels that Noah, the pure Sethite, left his country. So when theGnostics described Noah as wicked in contrast to the \"Sethians,\" theysimply inverted the tradition preserved by Josephus.Since the identification of the Sons of God with the sons of Seth wasknown already in the 1st century C.E., it must be Jewish, not Christian inorigin; moreover, it probably did not stem from a reaction to Gnosticism,but resulted from internal Jewish theological developments.We may attempt to trace these developments back, bearing in mind thatany reconstruction must remain hypothetical.In a symbolic description ofhuman history, which is usually referred to as \"the second dream-vision\"of Enoch (I Enoch 85-90), the angels who fell from heaven are depicted38Am. 1. 72-74; quoted according to Thackeray's translation (IV, 33-35 LCL).39iiyyEkOL rov BEOU is a rendering of beneielohim intermediate between the morethoroughly exegetical ofand the more literal of viol rov Beov.40Another reading would-be that the Sethite women united with the angels.This isdoubtful, however, since Josephus seems to put the guilt on the \"angels,\" not onthewomen.

But others (say) that the greatSeth took his plant out of Gomorrah and planted itin the secondplace to which he gave the name Sodom.44In his reconstruction of Sethian theology,45 Schenke dwells upon thefact that in Gos. Eg. there appears to be a difference between the originalseed of Seth (in Sodom and Gomorrah) and the contemporary Sethians.The former, according to III, 56:4-22, were placed by the Great Seth \"inthe fourth aeon, in the third Phoster Daveithe.\" For Schenke, this seedof Seth was \"eine Art Ur-Sethianer,ein gnostisch gedachtes Hel-dengeschlecht der Vorzeit.\"46 The chasm detected by Schenke betweenthe first sons of Seth and the contemporaneous Gnostics in some of theGnostic texts and traditions seems to be significant.The followinghypothesis, which integrates the evidence discussed so far, would account43Schenke (\"Die judische Melchisedek-Gestalt als Thema der Gnosis,\" 134)suggests thatan identification of Salem and Sodom took place in \"Sethian revolutionary exegesis.\"44Gos.E,c.III,60:9-18; see 56:9-13.Similarly,inParaph..Sheen 28:34-29:33, theSodomites are \"the members\" of Shem.

This would explain how the Gnos-tics could say:Then the great Seth came and brought his seed. And it was sown inthe aeons which had been brought forth, their number being theamount of Sodom. Some say that Sodom is the place of pasture of'the great Seth, which is Gomorrah. But others (say) that the greatSeth took his plant out of Gomorrah and planted itin the secondplace to which he gave the name Sodom.44In his reconstruction of Sethian theology,45 Schenke dwells upon thefact that in Gos. Eg. there appears to be a difference between the originalseed of Seth (in Sodom and Gomorrah) and the contemporary Sethians.The former, according to III, 56:4-22, were placed by the Great Seth \"inthe fourth aeon, in the third Phoster Daveithe.\" For Schenke, this seedof Seth was \"eine Art Ur-Sethianer,ein gnostisch gedachtes Hel-dengeschlecht der Vorzeit.\"46 The chasm detected by Schenke betweenthe first sons of Seth and the contemporaneous Gnostics in some of theGnostic texts and traditions seems to be significant.The followinghypothesis, which integrates the evidence discussed so far, would account43Schenke (\"Die judische Melchisedek-Gestalt als Thema der Gnosis,\" 134)suggests thatan identification of Salem and Sodom took place in \"Sethian revolutionary exegesis.\"44Gos.Eg.111,60:9-18; see 56:9-13.Similarly,inParnph. She,n 28:34-29:33, theSodomites are \"the members\" of Shem. To them he revealed his universal doctrine, \"Theywill rest with a pure conscience in the place of their repose, which is the unbegotten spirit\";Sodom would be burned unjustly.Marcion, too, referred to the Sodomites in his inversionof the biblical text: \"Cain et cos qui similes runt ei, et Sodomitas, et Aegyptios, et simileseis, et omnes omnino gentes, quae in omni permixione malignitatis ambulaverunt, salvataselse a Domino ...\" (Irenaeus, Adv.

The closeness of what can be called the \"pessimistic,\"or dualistic, trend in the Hermetic Corpus to Gnosticism is quite obvious,and has often been emphasized. This question,moreover, has becomedirectly relevant to current research since the Nag Hammadidiscovery; atleast three of the texts found in whatwas originally described as a\"Sethian library\" are clearly Hermetic works (CG VI561 7,and 8).Jean Doresse was the first to pointout some of the literary exchangesbetween \"Sethian\" Gnosticism and Hermetism.5He noted, for instance,that the way in which elements from Genesiswere used in Hermeticmyths was very similar to their reinterpretationin Gnostic mythology.6Doresse's pioneer work, however,was done at a time when most NagHammadi texts-including the Hermeticworks-were still unpublished.Doresse could thus regard Steles Seth, althoughnominally \"Sethian,\" asHermetic in content and consider the workto be \"an example of the tran-sition\" between the two movements.?

Nor does the short Hermetictreatise To Horus, also translated by Festugiere,16 quite tell the story ofI Enoch 6-8.In this work, Isis revealed to herson that \"one of theangels who dwell in the first heaven, when he saw me from above, desiredto unite with me in a union of love.\"Isis rejected his demands, askinghim to reveal to her \"the preparation of gold and silver.\" Amnael,ahigher angel, was then sent to Isis; she again refused to give herself to theangel and asked him to reveal the sign which he boreon his head.17Amnael finally did so and revealed the mysteries to Isis, who transmittedthem to her son Horus.(The reader's curiosity as to whether Isis thenaccepted Amnael's advances or escaped remains unsatisfied.)No comparable story is told in I Enochor, for that matter, in any of theextant apocryphal works, where the name Amnael does not occur. Butwehave noted (chap. 11) that there is another Jewish text which tolda verysimilar myth.In the Midrash ql' Shemhazai and Azael, thepure womanEsterah escaped the lust of the angel Shemhazai byhaving him reveal toher the Tetragrammaton; when she pronounced it, she escapedto heavenand became a star.It thus seems that the story about Isis and Amnael isnot original; the fact that the angel's name is Hebraic alsosuggests a Jew-ish (or pseudo-Jewish, i.e., Gnostic)source for the myth.18 Shemhazai andAzael is valuable evidence for the existence ofthis myth in Jewish con-texts andIshall return toitin chapter VIII.However, sinceitispreserved only in the medieval Chronicles qf' Jerahmeeland dependenttexts, it is impossible to claim with certainty that itrepresents a later ver-sion of the early model used by the Hermeticauthor.

Later on, however,thetextrelates how these \"philosophers\" escaped materiality,withZosimus quoting traditions \"found only with the Hebrews and in thesecret books of Hermes.\"20 According to Zosimus (or rather, his sources),the spiritual men were similar to \"the man who is inside Adam [i.e.,] thespiritual man.\" Following a rather common notion, Zosimus attributedboth an exoteric and an esoteric name to this Spiritual Adam.21 His com-mon name was Phos (0c0'c), while his proper name(icupLov ovopa)remained secret-only Nicotheus knew it.22 When Phos was in paradise,the archons(?) convinced him to wear Adam's body, fabricated by themfrom the four elements, and thereby enslaved him; they then sent himanother \"fetter\" in the person of Eve. But, continued Zosimus, the Sonof Godfrom now on until the end of the world, in secret and openly, comesto those who are his[i.e., the \"philosophers\"] and communicateswith them, recommending to them, in secret and through their intel-lect, to separate themselves from their Adam, who blinds them and isjealous of the spiritual and luminous man.2319Scott, 105; trans. 266 Festugiere; 22-23 Jackson.201bid., 18 (109 Scott; trans. 271 Festugiere; 36-37 Jackson).In this pagan context,\"Hebrews\" does not necessarily mean \"Jews\"; see Festugiere, 271, n. 10: \"Les He'breux,c'est-i-dire d'une part les exegeses alle'goriques du re'cit de la Gene'se (Adam), d'autre partdes ecrits gnostiques pseudo-chre'tiens (Nicothe'os).\" For the respect devoted to \"Hebrewwisdom\" in Hermetism, see the beginning of Sophe, a book which may have been writtenby Zosimus: \"The true book of Sophe the Egyptian and of the Hebrews' God, Lord of theHosts, Sabaoth-since there are two sciences and two wisdoms, that of the Egyptians andthat of the Hebrews.\" Text and trans. in Festugiere, ibid., 261 and n. 2; cf. 261, n. 1.21E.g., Gos.

Tardieu has drawn attention to the probable existence of relation-ships between the Gnostic Seth and the Manichaean Sethel,3 and in partic-ular to the literary genre of prayer or incantation (U)AHA; E7raot8ai)represented by Steles Seth and mentioned in the title of Kephalaion X:\"On the significance of the fourteen [great] Aeons about which Sethel hasspoken in his prayer.\"4 This title, states Tardieu, could well bea trace of aSethian \"penetration\" into Egyptian Manichaeism.It could also be, headds, the sign of a \"volonte de recuperation\" by Manichaean missionariesamong the Gnostic circlesin the Nile valley.5 Both suggestionsareimprobable. The fact that the two texts to which Tardieu referswerefound in Egypt in a Coptic translation byno means implies that they wereoriginally written in Egypt.In fact, there is every reason to believe thatthe Kephalaia were written in Mani's inner circle of disciples.

Sethelwas, indeed, the Manichaean form of the biblical Seth. SeeSchmidt-Polotsky, \"Mani-Fund,\" 22,n. 1. The fact that in Coptic Sethel is spelled with a crather than with a u9 points to a Greek intermediary between the original Semitic 976l andthe Coptic cHeHA: H and i, in koine' Greek, have thesame quantity (ittacization).

But the presence of Seth in Manichaean texts isso centralthat his figure was probably part and parcel of Mani's own theological Bil-clung and not a later adoption for missionary purposes.The recently published Cologne Mani Codex, an official biography of theParaclete, tells us that in addition to the Apocalypses attributed to theGenesis figures Adam, Enoch, and Shem, Mani also knewan Apocalypsewritten by Sethel, Adam's son.8 These works, which he probably first readwhile still living among the Elchasaites, are mentioned in the context ofecstatic heavenly ascensions of the prophets. The passages cited describethe encounter of the prophets with angels, and the secret teachingstransmitted by the latter to the former. According to the portion quotedfrom this \"Apocalypse of Seth,\" Seth was taken out of the world by the\"Great Angels.\"Elsewhere, a shining figure appeared to Sethel andbrought him to another place on high. Seth is said to have described, inhis other books, just how \"the great mysteries of [divine] greatness\"wererevealed to him.9 None of these four Apocalypsescan be identified withany extant work, and it is difficult to fully appreciate their nature from thefragmentary remaining citations.In any case, these contain no unmistak-ably Gnostic elements and could well belong to lost Jewish apocryphalworks.10The importance of the figure of Seth in Manichaean teachings isunder-lined by the fact that the only Old Testament figures whoappear in all thereports of the Muslim heresiographers about the Manichaeansare Adam,Noah, and Seth.\" Augustine's testimony reveals that theManichaeansbelieved Seth to have been the first righteousone snatched up by angels6For instance, the Chinese treatise edited by E.

He also calledhimself the \"seal of the prophets\" or, in the Pauline fashion, theapos-tle of Jesus Christ (CMC46:1 -3). These conceptions were based on the belief (accepted bythe Elchasaites)in various reincarnations of Jesus.See p.75, n. 39, of Henrichs andKoenen's editionof CMC (ZPE 19 [19751) and CMC 70:20-23.

This conception of Seth as higher than Adam was buttressedby the correlate theological development according to which the Primor-dial Man preceded the earthly Adam.18 In some sense, Seth was also supe-rior to the apostles of all later generations.In the psalm quoted above,the cry (presumably a call for help) was not only addressed to Seth,Adam, or Eve, but also to other entities, which correspond, at various lev-els, to these three figures. The context reveals the extent to which Eve,the source of lust in humanity, was denigrated by Manichaean encratism.While \"the cry of a Virgin\" was also addressed to the Land of Light, theFather, or the spirit, and \"the cry of a Continent One\" to the New Aeon,emanations, the moon, or the soul,that of a \"Married One\" wasaddressed to the world, the Archon, the stars, or the body.In the Homilies, Seth is described as crowned,'9 and in another psalm,the community is asked \"to sing together to Sethel,\" who is \"our12Contra Fausiuni 19.3 (498 Zycha) \"olim promulgata per Enoch et Seth et ceteros eorumsimiles iustos, quibus eadem illustres tradiderunt angeli.\"13Keph. 12:10ff.; see Hon,. 68:lSff.; also 14:30.

These fragments provide importantparal-lelstoaspects of Manichaean anthropogony previously known onlythorugh the reports of Theodore bar Khonai and Ibn al-Nadim.In one ofthese fragments, Adam asked Saglon (Sakla)22 to order the unwillingEveto nurse the newborn child.23 In response, Saglon tried to take Adamawayfrom religion. Adam then drew seven white circleson the ground, aroundthe child, and prayed to the gods. There the fragment breaks off.Despiteits brevity, however, this passage helps reconstruct the Manichaeanstoryof Seth's birth.Other fragments, unfortunatelyvery corrupt, were recently edited byWerner Sundermann, who has noted that they belongedto a longa fabulaabout the protoplasts and their child.24 Adam and Eveare here calledGehmurd and Murdyanag, while the demiurge isthe demon Saklon, whoinspired lust in Murdyanag.25 She thuswas able to seduce Gehmurdthrough her nakedness, despite his attemptto remain chaste. When thechild was born, the demons tried tosuppress him, but his father savedhim by drawing seven magical circles aroundhim and reciting a prayer.Then Saklon unsuccessfully triedto poison the child. The fragments addthat after the child's birth, Gehmurd didnot know his wife for 80 years;20MPs. 144:1-7; 146:12-13.21 Keph. LVII, 145:23-31. Cf. Gen 6:3.This opposition of the Golden Age in the timesof Adam and Seth (and under their rule)to the moral decadence (accompanied by tyranny)in later generations is not unique. A similarpattern also appears in the Chronicle of Michaelthe Syrian (chap. 4, p. 2 Syriac; 5 trans.).221nsome Middle Iranian fragments, the name \"Sammael\"occurs; e.g.,in Andreas-Henning, Mir.

But the text refers to \"those archons and thatSindid\"32as if theyhad already been mentioned.In fact, only thearchon ('al-arkun) hadappeared previously (59 FlUgel), in a passage where his incestuous rela-tions with his daughter Eve were mentioned.Later on, al-$indid per-suaded Eve to join him against Adam and the newborn who is \"not fromus,but a stranger\"(gharib);theleader of the archons recognizedimmediately that Adam's son was not under his sway, but rather an aX-to his power.33 Finally,issaid to have become anopponent of \"Adam and later generations\" (61 Flugel). Cain, \"the ruddyman,\"34 was born from the union of Eve with al-Sindid, exactlyas in theGnostic texts he had been born from her union with the demiurge. Asnoted, the Gnostic ambivalence toward Eve disappeared in Manichaeancontexts. Also specifically Manichaean is the idea of the incestuous inter-course between Cain and his mother Eve, which does not appear in theearlier Gnostic sources.In Mandaean mythology, however,is said to have been born fromHibil's sexual relations with Hawwa. Hibil himself was not Adam's son,for he \"was not sown from the seed of man\" (GinzaR.X, 242; 243Lidzbarski).Hibil actually appears to have inherited some of the featureselsewhere associated with Seth. He was called, for instance, a \"youth.\"35Ibn al-Nadim further reports that Eve bore to Cain a son, Abel, andtwodaughters,Wise-of-Ages(hikrnata/-dahr)36andDaughter-of-31A1-Jahiz gives the form Saqlun (K. Kessler, Maui:Eorschungen ilber die ManichOischeReligion [Berlin:Reimer, 1889), 361, 368), while the demiurge appears under the nameLou-Yi in TraitéChapannes-Pelliot (525, n.1).32Dodge (11, 785, n. 200) states: \"The name [al Sindid] probably refers to the Angel whoraped Wise of Ages.\" This is not at all certain, at least if one recognizes in the story told byal-Nadim a version of the myth previously told inI-Iyp. Arc/i.Ifal-5indid is Sakla, he didnot succeed in raping Norea, Eve's pure daughter.In any case, it would be surprising if thetwo pure• maidens, Faryäd and Barfaryad (or Purfaryad) would be born from the rape ofWise-of-Ages by the lustful archon.Despite the fact that the details of the myth are farfrom clear in this version, it is not likely that the pure maidens were daughters of Sakla.330ne can safely suppose that the Aramaic (Syriac?)Vorlage(ofthe Persian) had herenukraya,i.e.,àkkoyctrijc.

On Cain as son of Eve and the demiurge, see chap. II35Segelberg, \"Old and New Testament Figures in Mandaean Version,\" 232. The Man-daean versions of the myths appear to be later developments.36According to theGunzO,ükVita,; a Zoroastrian polemical treatise of the 9th cen-tury, the myth of the seduction of the archons involved the \"daughters of Time.\" Theywere sent by the twelve glorious ones( =thetwelve glorious virgins evoked by the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"GNOSTIC MYTHS IN MANICHAEAN GARB151Corruption (ibnat al-hirs).37 Cain took Daughter-of-Corruption fora wife,while he gave Wise-of-Ages to Abel.

Norea, indeed, was characterized by thecry, \"Res-cue me!\" which she raised to the heavenly powers when the demiurgetried to seduce her:But Norea turned, with the might of [...] and in a loud voice [she]cried out [up to] the Holy One, the God of the Entirety, \"Rescue[$0n0EEV] me from the Archons of Unrighteousness andsave mefrom their clutches-forthwith! \"40As for Adam and Eve's child, a handsome male witha comely visage,he remained nameless at the beginning of his life. When al-Sindidcon-vinced Eve not to nurse him, Adam said that he would feed the childoncows' milk and fruit from trees.41 Then al-Sindid made allcows and fruittrees disappear, and Adam drew three magic circles around the child. Onthem he wrote the names of the king of paradise, the Primordial Man,and the Spirit of Life, and prayed to God to feed the child.This prayerwas answered, and near the child grew a lotus tree, out of which milkflowed.

Indeed, it is basedon therape of Eve (which is also found in Hebrew midrashim), but also keepstrace of the figure of Gnostic Norea.The Seduction of the ArchonsThe myth of \"the seduction of the archons\" isa good illustration ofMani's well-known propensity for borrowing from different cultural andreligious milieus. One version of the myth, indeed, is reported in Zoroas-trian texts. The Bundahishn (a text redacted only in the centuries follow-ing the Arab conquest, but which retains much earlier traditions) recallshow in the Urzeit Ahriman sent the god Narsai in the shape ofa nakedfifteen-year-old lad (an age symbolic of early manhood in Zoroastrianism)to TaKi the prostitute, and how the latter was filled with desire for him.44Based on yet another Mazdaean version of thesame myth reported byTheodore bar Khonai, Cumont, followed by Widengren,45 concludes thatit is this myth which lies directly at the origin of the Manichaean seduc-tion myth. This argument, however, fails to convince because it doesnottake into account the existence of the myth in Gnostic contexts thatwerein no way under direct Iranian influence. There isno denying the factthat the seduction myth, which appeared in various forms,may well havebeen the survival of some ancient nature myth,as F. C. Burkitt pointedout;46 but it is far from certain that Mani borrowed the myth directly froman Iranian source (although it does appear more clearly in Manichaeantraditions than in Gnostic versions). Bynow it is apparent'that Mani bor-rowed relativelylittle from Iranian mythology.47 The exactmeans oftransmission through which the seduction myth reached Mani remainsamatter for speculation (according to Ephrem, Mani received the myth43Flugel translates, \"folgten mit der $iddikut (der Gemeinde der Wahrhaftigen),\"givingto a/ sacliq ci the meaning of the Arabic root sdq (trust).

In Judaism the fall of the angels was seen as a singleevent, a turning-point in the course of history; in its Gnostic reinterpreta-tion the myth became a pattern inherent in history, under the sway oflustful archons.Nevertheless, the evil-doings of Sakla and his acolyteswere kept within the framework of the Genesis story in the Gnosticworks, which claimed to give the true exegesis of the biblical text. Mani-chaeism, a fuller, even baroque, development of Gnostic trends, broughtthe blossoming Gnostic mythology to its logical conclusion: the severingof its links with the Hebrew Bible. Manichaean mythology, this \"simula-tion of reason\" (in Paul Ricoeur's words), had not only etiological, butalso scientific pretensions.It did not simply attempt to account for humanhistory, or even for human nature-it aimed at no less than a comprehen-sive analysis of the cosmos, its phenomena, and its very creation.Every theologoumenon used by Mani was totally reinterpreted andintegrated into a new mythological framework. Manichaeism carried tothe extreme the process, begun with Gnosticism, of shifting myths backto earlier stages in the Vorzeit and to \"higher\" levels of reality. Thus, inManichaean contexts, some of the central elements of the seduction mythare found in cosmological accounts. The lustful archons of Gnosticismappear in Manichaean traditions as the sons and daughters of Darkness, orelse as demons crucified on the vault of the heavens (or from whose skinsthe heavens were made). According to Theodore bar Khonai's testimony,Thereupon the Living Spirit gave command to his three sons, the oneto kill and the other to flay the Archons, the Sons of Darkness, andthat they should deliver them to the Mother of Life. The Mother ofLife spread out the heaven with their skins and made ten heavens,and they threw the body of these to the Earth of Darkness, and theymade eight earths.49Henning has pointed out that these demons are a transformation of theWatchers of 1 Enoch.50 Actually, one of the Middle Persian texts edited byHenning (M 625 C) knows the original Aramaic name of the Watchers,cyr.51For Henning, however, the Manichaean myth came directly fromI Enoch.He does not mention the significance of these demons for48See his Fourth Dialogue with Hypatius, in C.

The very fact that the myth was transferredto the realm of cosmogony indicates a majorshift from the myth ofI Enoch.Like I Enoch, Manichaean mythology presented the Watchers'binding as a punishment for their sin; but it was only after they had swal-lowed the Primordial Man and his five sons that the Living Spirit capturedand crucified (or bound) them.52Keph. LXX tells us that when the Watchers (Eypr)yopot) came downfrom heaven, during the vigil of the great King of Honor(i.e.,,one of thecosmic periods which preceded the creation of the earth), they broughtwith them earthquakes and malice (171:16-19).Keph. LXX adds thatwith them \"rebellion and ruin came about on the earth\" (92:31), and thaton their account the four angels53 received their orders: they boundthe Egregoroi with eternal fetters in the prison of the dark (?); theirsons were destroyed upon the earth. (93:25-28; cf. 117:1-9)According to Henning, however, the heavenly origin of the Watchers \"didnot square with Mani's conviction that no evil could come from good,\"and he therefore \"transformed them into `demons,' namely those demonswho had been imprisoned in the skies, under the supervision of the RexHonoris\" when the world was created.54In chap. II we saw how the foiled attempt of the archons to rape thepure women was transformed, in some Gnostic traditions, into a voluntaryseduction of the archons by these women. In Manichaeism, the seductionof the archons became a complex myth, central to the cosmic \"economyof salvation.\" The texts give us various account of this myth. While themyth itself has been studied, the functional differences between its ver-sions have not hitherto been satisfactorily analyzed, not even by Cumont,who has offered a thorough study of the topic.For instance, when henotes that the same expression (\"he revealed his forms\") was used inconjunction with both the Living Spirit and the Messenger, he simplystates:\"Cette identite...semble indiquer que l'Esprit-Vivant a eurecours au meme artifice que le Messager.\"55 It is my opinion, however,52Liber Schol.

The first version, the cosmogonical, was described by Theodore barKhonai as follows:56The Living Spirit (ruha hayd) revealed his forms (gale Sara/eh) to thesons of Darkness; and from the Light which had beenswallowed bythem from these Five Luminous Gods he purified the light and madethe Sun, the Moon and more than a thousand stars.57While the text is rather elliptic,it should be understood that the lightfrom which the cosmos was created came out in the semen of the sons ofDarkness when they were sexually aroused by the body (\"the forms\") ofthe Living Spirit.(The word for \"spirit,\" ruha, is masculine but can referto a feminine entity.)This first version is thus part of the cosmogonicalprocess.11. The Messenger (izgada) is the main character of the second versionof the seduction of the archons.After evoking the twelve virgins \"withtheir vestments and with their crowns and with their attributes,\"58 theMessenger sailed in his vessel of light (the moon) across the heavens, andwhen he reached the middle of its vault,he revealed his forms, male and female, and was seen by all thearchons, the sons of Darkness, males and females.

This is, they say, the originof all flesh-beings moving on earth, in the water, in the air.65The way in which the fall of these abortions is connected to anthropogonywill be discussed later on.III.Yet another version of the seduction is described in the ActaArchelai,66 and, with some variants, by other Christian heresiographers.67Once again, the function of the sexual arousal of the archons was multi-ple. Here the myth attempts to account for natural phenomena.The adorned virgin Horaia68 appeared to the archons who had beenborne up and crucified on the firmament by the Living Spirit.To themale. archons she appeared as a beautiful woman, and to the femalearchons as a handsome and lustful young man. Ignited by the fire of love,all the archons ran after her, but the virgin disappeared from their sight,and they began to sweat \"like men.\" This sweat was rain.For his part,the \"reaping archon,\" frustrated by the disappearance of Horaia, began to\"cut the roots\" connecting men to heaven, so that \"pestilence\" wouldkill them.\"This isthe cause of death,\" concludes the text.Thisarchon's frustration was also at the origin of earthquakes, which involveAtlasthe Omophore.69 Hegemonius's sourcehere depends on the\"anthropological\" principle according to which human phenomena areexplained by referring to cosmic ones, since man is a microcosm.7063Pognon reads yin, but Scher has thecorrect nh(; see Jackson, Researches, 248, n. 114.64\"Giants,\" 53 (= Selected Papers, Il, 116).65Contra Faustum VI, 8 (296 Zycha); Cumont (Recherches, 41,n. 2) quotes parallel texts,to which one should add Mir.

Yet in the same Kephalaion, Maniadded,The archons have made Adam and Eve through the force (Ev-Epycta) of the sin\" (138:17-18).77 In 138:1-5, the myth is somewhatmore detailed; the \"archon, their [abortions'] ruler\" asked his compan-ions to give him their light so that he could make them an image (EL'Kwv)according to \"the image of the above\" (rreINC.race). A paral-lel passage has been preserved in Theodore bar Khonai's Liber Scholiorum:when the abortions fell upon the earth,they took thought together and recollected the form of the Messengerwhich they had seen, and they said: \"Where is that form which wesaw?\" And Ashaqlun, Son of the King of Darkness, said to the abor-tions: \"Give me your sons and your daughters and Iwill make foryou a form like that which you have seen.\"78He and his consort Namrael devoured the abortions' children and thenunited. Namrael conceived twice and gave birth to Adam and Eve.7975The abortions, \"sons of' matter\" (MPs. 108:24-26) built the edifice of' flesh; Keph.171:19-21; see the title of Keph.

Thepassagescited above add new parallels between the Gnostic and the Manichaeantexts.According to Theodore's report,the abortions \"took thoughttogether\" (ethasbu tim hadede ), justas the archons in Hyp. Arch. \"laidplans\" (a.NaPXWN Al NOYCYMBOAION)80 in orderto create man.And in their creation, the archons attempted \"to capture that image whichhad appeared to them in the Waters,\" i.e., the image of incorruptibility,which they could not seize (Hyp.

Theodor Noldeke has suggested to identify these EKTpJ,μaT&with the Nephilim of Gen 6:4 by reading nepallm instead of nepilfnt.81It ismost significant that the Midrash had already suggested deriving nepilimfrom nepalim (Gen. Rab. 26.7).This, as already noted,82 was obviouslythe origin of the Gnostic concept of the abortions. Mani, however,went astep further in his mythological development and practically identified theWatchers themselves with the abortions. The copulation ofthe Sons ofGod with the daughters of men became the archons'attempt to seducewomen (and was then inverted to the myth of the seduction of thearchons by the women); the products of this unseemly union inGenesis,rov TTIq uky)(TpXol'roc-LaKXav Se rovrol' 7rpo(Tayopcvotxrv-Ka T?p' Ev\"av (i)Qair(US V7TOTov Y(CKAiKa( rov NE13po,S.

Cumont, who admits that the Mani-chaeans borrowed the figure of Sakla from the Gnostics (p. 73),thinks thatorNemrod was substituted for the demon Nabroelor Namrael when Babylonian Manichaeismtried to adapt itself to the beliefs of the Roman world. But Cumontdoes not cite any evi-dence of a \"Babylonian\" demon Nabroel. On Namrael,see further Furlani's remarks inAnn(tli de/I'Aca(/e#nia Nazionale (lei Lintel VIII, 2 (1951), 519-531 (non vidi).It is probablethat the Gnostic Nabroel evolved from legends built around thebiblical figure of the evilking Nimrod (see Cumont's own remark, 74,n. 2).In the Bible (Gen 10:8-9), Nimrod iscalled gibbor, like the sons of the benei elolum and the daughtersof men in Gen 6:4b.InJewish and then in Muslim legends, Nimrod typified theevil tyrant: he is said to have triedto burn Abraham-and even to kill God-by throwingarrows to.the sky.In Arabic, jabbarhas the connotation of revolt against God;see ShEncvcl.

Referring to Noldeke's suggestion, Cumont notes the simi-larity between the Manichaean description of the archons made prisonersby Jesus (in the Fihrist's account) and the binding of the Fallen Angels byMichael in I Enoch. Nevertheless, he concludes:It seems impossible to admit that the extremely developed Mani-chaean fable could have originated in this short verse of Genesis, butone wonders whether this verse itself does not sum up anold Semiticlegend, which Mani would have known.84It is because he was searching for the roots of Manichaeism only in Meso-potamian soil and in early Iranian religion that Cumont could not findMani's sources for the myth of the abortions and remained convinced thatthe seduction myth had been borrowed by both Gnostics and Manichaeansfrom \"that eclectic Mesopotamian religion, in which indigenous elementshad long become combined with Iranian doctrines.\"85 Yet Isaac de Beau-sobre, the founder of Manichaean studies, with whose writings Cumontwas familiar, had suggested as early as the18th century that Manichaeanmythology was partly rooted in Enochic literature.86The very use of the term Eyprlyopoc in the Kephalaia (and of tyr in aMiddle Persian fragment) as a synonym fir archons not only provesBeausobre's intuition in a definitive way, it also shows that Mani's Watch-ers were no longer Jewish, butGnostic.87 Paradoxically, Manichaeism,which carried the Gnostic trend of Mythologisierung through to the sever-ing of its links with biblical exegesis, manifests here a clearer, more directinfluence from Jewish literature than do the Gnostic texts. This importantfact might shed light upon the different channels through which Jewishtraditions reached the Egyptian Gnostics and the Manichaeans.In bothcases, the original milieu would seem to bethe Syrian Jewish-Christianbaptist trends to which the Elchasaites belonged.

The expression \"sons of the giants\" in Keph. XLV, there-fore, probably reflects, directly or indirectly, a literal translation of theSemitic expression and should be understood as \"giants,\" i.e., referring tothe nepilini, sons of the Watchers.88The transition from the equation \"sons of the giants= sons of theWatchers\" to an identification of the Watchers with the giantswas logicaland easy. That such a step was actually taken by the Manichaeans isattested to by a passage of Alexander of Lycopolis's treatise against theManichaeans. Disputing their asceticism and continence, he said,What is told in poetry about the giants is mythological. Those whodiscourse about these in allegorical form put forth such things hidingthe solemnity of their tale behind the form of the myth. For example,,when the history of the Jews speaks of the angels who consorted withthe daughters of men...In good Platonic fashion, Alexander thought that such stories hinted \"atthe nurturing faculties of the soul,\" while the Manichaeans understoodthem literally.89 What isimportant hereisthat for Alexander-andpresumably for the Manichaeans-the angels of Genesis 6were consideredto be \"giants.\"88Bohlig offers a slightly different explanation: \"Im 45 Kapitel [of the Kephalaialist nachden gefallenen Engeln von den 'Sohnen der Giganten' die Rede, obwohl die Giganten selbstgemeint sind.Hier heft wohi im griechischen Art des vibe ;ov anBptitirov vor, wahrend imHenochbuch [ch. 151 Bowie bei Synkellos [21 Dindorfl steht [Keph. 154:17]\"; \"Probleme desmanichaischen Lehrvortrages,\" in Mysterion ttncl Warheh, 231.8937 Brinkmann;I quote the translation of van der Horst and Mansfeld, 95.For adifferent understanding of this text, see Henning, \"Giants,\" 53,n. 5.For Henning, the factthat Alexander did not mention the Book of Giants inone breath with the Histoty o/'the Jews\"shows conclusively that he had no knowledge of Mani's book.\" Thismay well be, but itremains that Alexander knew, and did not object to, the close relationship between thegiants and the Fallen Angels.6 "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"GNOSTIC MYTHS IN MANICHAEAN GARB163From the biblical verses, therefore, a fourfold exegetical equation wasobtained:(1) abortions (:^[7D])Nephilim =(2) sons of the Watchers (i.e., sons of'2:)(3) giants (0 5ADz)(4) sons of giants (pIJ7vs)Out of these,and through various combinations,the Manichaeansdeveloped the following identifications:(1) Watchers = giants(2) giants = abortions(3) Watchers = abortionsSince Sakla was identified with the leader of the FallenAngels, hebelonged to the abortions (Keph. 137:15). Because Sophia wasunknownin Manichaean literature, Sakla (who is never calledYaldabaoth) was notpresented as her aborted child. On typological grounds, theManichaeanidentification seems to have evolved from simpler (and therefore possiblyearlier)stages of Gnosticism, in which a Sophiaspeculation was notknown.The complex identity of the giants may help us understandthe inten-tion and meaning of Mani's Book of Giants, which ismentioned by bothChristian and Muslim heresiographers as one of the sixbooks written byMani (but not one of the four written byScythianus).90 According toKeph.

The discovery in Qumran Cave 4 of manyAramaic Enochic fragments has drastically added to our knowledge of thiscorpus. Although their study has only just begun, it already appears prob-able that Aramaic was the original language of the corpus. Furthermore,Milik claims to have identified some of these fragments as coming fromthe original Book q/' Giants, the one from which Mani was thought to haveborrowed extensively in his own work of the same title.95 Unfortunately,Milik has so far published only a few of the relevant fragments,so thatany discussion has to remain provisional. According to Milik, this Book ofGiants dealt mainly with the story of the offspring of the Sons of God,called the Watchers (pv) or the Holy Watchers (;'viand withtheir wicked deeds. In the original corpus, this book probably followed theBook of Watchers (1 Enoch 6-16). Milik assumes that thereason for thecensorship applied to the Book q/' Giants by the Christian editors of thecorpus may well have been its popularity among the Manichaeans. Thefragments published by Henning and those publishedso far by Milik donot show conclusively that Mani's sole and direct source was the JewishBook of Giants. What they do show is that Mani knew thestory told bythe Book o/' Giants. To reproduce and discuss the relevant fragments herein detail is beyond the scope of this work.

He confined himself toan adaptation which seems to me not very thoroughgoing: in places aword-for-word translation, in places resumes of the narrative sections,in places slight elaboration.'00What both Henning and Milik are in fact saying is that Mani wrote theBook of Giants-and had translations made of it-because he loved Mat-chen. This is not a very convincing argument when dealing with a theolo-gian of genius such as Mani.If he wrote the book, itis because heintended it to transmit an essentially religious message. And if he lovedthe writing that became the source of his own work, he must have foundreligious value init.But what were these \"underlying metaphysicaltruths\" which Mani discovered in the traditions about the giants? Oneinference follows from the identification of the Manichaean mytholo-goumena as typically Gnostic, for it stands to reason that Mani's interestin the giants and their deeds was similar to the Gnostics' interest in them.Hence in his Book of Giants, as in the Kephalaia and the sources quotedby Theodore barKhonai and Ibn al-Nadim, Maniset out to develop aGnostic understanding of the giants-the pervasive myth of the lustfularchons and their wicked deeds throughout history.In fact, the scant fragments of the Book of Giants themselves maypreserve traces of Gnostic mythologoumena.In fragmenti from theKawdn,101 the 400,000 righteous ones were killed by fire, naphta, andbrimstone. This motif does not appear in the Qumran fragments, but inApoc.

To be sure, these two motifs mightalso have been present in the Jewish work, but evidence for that is stilllacking. On the other hand, the traces of Gnostic mythologoumena foundin the Manichaean fragments are too scant for us to postulate a gnosti-cized version of the Book of Giants as Mani's source.Whatever the case with the Manichaean Book of Giants, the evidencecited above (and especially from the Kephalaia) leaves no doubt that ifMani knew the Jewish legends, it was a Gnostic or gnosticizing reading.,ofthem with which he became acquainted, most probably while living amongthe Elchasaites,105 and which he himself sought to develop.That is tosay, for Mani, the complex called \"giants\" was the embodiment of evilthrough history; these figures were the equivalent of the Gnostic archons.As in Gnosticism, only by fighting them and opposing their evil designscould the forces of righteousness reach salvation.Milik claims to have identified another (late) witness to the originalBook of Giants. For him the Midrash of Shenihazai and Azael isa retrover-sion into Hebrew of the Manichaean Book of Giants:A scholarly Babylonian rabbi could have found and understoodwithout difficulty the Syriac [sic] Book of Giants, as recently as theearly Middle Ages.106The author of the Jewish adaptation of the Manichaean Book ofGiants will readily be acknowledged as the rabbi Joseph who is men-tioned at the beginning of the midrash on gemhazai and `Aza'el.It is103MPs. 143:7-8;see Allberry's references there.104Henning,\"Giants,\" 68-69.

Furthermore, it seems tome that if the storyof Esterah's escape from the lustful Shemhazai indeed belonged to theJewish Book of Giants, then the myth of Norea's escape from the clutchesof the archons would merely be the reformulation ofa legend alreadypresent in Jewish literature.In its Gnostic reformulation, the legendacquired a new and precise soteriological significance, thus becomingafull-fledged myth.Such a suggestion, however plausible, must remainspeculative becauseitrests upon a nudrash directly attested only inmedieval versions.In the course of this work, therefore,I have deli-berately avoided basing my analysis on the evidence of Shenrhazai andAzae% although the midrashic material clearly bears upon the argumentdeveloped here.It would indeed strengthen the conclusions of Part I byindicating that the \"inversion process\" of the myth of the Fallen Angelswas already well advanced in Jewish traditions before the birth of Gnosti-cism.1071bicl., 339.1080n the extent to which Babylonian communities remained isolated from one another,see J.

The evidence analyzedhere shows how the dualistic vision of history corresponds to the dualisticanthropology of the Gnostic Weltanschauung.As we have seen, the view, still widely held, according to which Gnos-tic thought totally negated time appears to be unfounded, or at least, lim-ited to those trends-neither the earliest nor the main ones-for whichsalvation was attainable only in the immediacy of personal election.Indeed, the early Gnostic conception of time reveals the deep influence ofJewish eschatology. The importance of Heilsgeschichte did not seem togrow with the increasing christianization of the texts, and there are nogrounds for claiming, with Rudolph, that the Historisierung of the Gnosticsavior was due to Christian influences.' In the Gnostic system of belief,history was conceived of as a permanent conflict between the Gnostics andthe forces of evil. The latter, ruled by the demiurge and his acolytes, thearchons, all of whom keep the rest of mankind under their sway, unceas-ingly sought either to destroy the Gnostics, who were born from the pure\"other seed\" of Seth, or to pervert them through lustful unions. At theend of time, the forces of evil would be defeated.We can now understand better how some Gnostics thought themselvesto be the seed of Seth, the \"other seed,\" and how their core myth wasdirectly related to the problem of the origins of evil and righteousness.This core myth, consisting of the pure birth of Seth and of its corollary,Eve escaping from the lust of the demiurge and the archons, itselfevolved from the Jewish aggadic tradition about Eve's seduction by Satan,which resulted in the birth of Cain. We have seen how Satan's adulterousrelations with Eve were integrated by the Gnostics into the paradigm ofmixis: the union of the angels descended from heaven with the women.From these unions, the giants were born and evil came upon the earth,prompting God to send the flood.For the Gnostics, the leader of theseangels was no longer Shemhazai or Satan, as in the Jewish forms of themyth, but the demiurge himself, Yaldabaoth or Sakla (who also retains aJewish name of Satan, Sammael).Parallel. to their indictment of thesatanized demiurge, these Gnostics developed an \"anthropodicy\"; theirclaim to redemption rested upon their continued purity, while the rest ofmankind was tainted by lust.Gnosis, 163."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"170CONCLUSIONParadoxically, gnosis has been encountered here rather little.In theearly Gnostic trends, the major emphasis appears to have been placed onthe sexual mythology; only later did it move to the saving knowledge.This impression is corroborated by Hippolytus's testimony:Therefore, the priests and chiefs of the doctrine were the first whowere called Naassenes, being thus named in the Hebrew tongue: forthe serpent is called naas.A.f'ierwards, they called themselves Gnos-tics, alleging that they alone knew the depths.2This evolution, which led Gnostic thought away from mythology to meta-phorical theology, may be detected, for instance, in Valentinian language.3Yet in order to introduce freedom into Gnostic thought, the Valentiniansexpanded the predestinarian dualism of the early Gnostics into a tripartiteanthropology; the \"psychics,\" to whom Abel belonged, could choose elec-tion and join the Gnostics.Time and again, I have insisted upon the importance of the Jewish ele-ments, which were thoroughly reinterpreted or inverted in Gnosticism.These elements came not only from apocalyptic texts, but also from tradi-tions later recorded in rabbinic literature; they appeared not as merelydiscrete mythologoumena, but rather pervaded all of early Gnosis, beforeits double encounter with Christianity and Middle Platonism. These Jew-ish elements could hardly be later influences upon a movement furtherand further estranged from anything Jewish; they must point to Jewishroots of Gnosticism, roots which appear to have run very deep.qArguing againstH.Jonas,R.Grant claims-in agreement withHippolytus-that the roots of Gnosticism were not mythological, but philo-sophicaL4 The results of this inquiry point toa third option: that the emer-gence of Gnosticism was strongly related to exegetical problems of the firstchapters of Genesis. We have seen that Gnostic mythology was esta-blished upon a hermeneutical basis directly inherited from Judaism. Theradicalization of these Jewish exegetical traditions and their crystallizationseem to have been at the core of the key Gnostic myths. Moreover, wehave found no reason to assume any Christian mediation through whichthese traditions would have reached the Gnostics.Problems of majorimportance for the Gnostics were also dealt with in the philosophical tradi-tion (mainly in the Academy), but itseems that the Gnostics' discoveryof this tradition and the extensive influence it exercisedupon Gnosticthought were nonetheless secondary.It may be useful to note that thiscentrality of exegesis to the origins of Gnostic thoughtruns counter to2Elenchos 5.6.Cf.

"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE GNOSTIC SEXUAL MYTH171Harnack's argument that Marcion was not a Gnostic because he wasmainly interested in biblical exegesis.5What were the major exegetical elements in the earliest stages of Gnos-ticmythology? A reconstruction of the GnosticUisystent has beenattempted by H.-M. Schenke.6 In the original mythology, according tohim, the unknown God and his consort Sophia had their abode in theOgdoad. Sophia, however, became pregnant of herself; she aborted, andher imperfect child was the demiurge, who fell down to the Hebdomadand then created the planets and the world with the help of six angels.One great problem with this reconstruction, however, is that the mythdescribed by Schenke is much too complex to be considered primitive.George MacRae has plausibly suggested that the fall of Eve must haveplayed a crucial role in the accretion process through which the GnosticSophia myth was built.7 It remains impossible to reconstruct exactly thesuccessive steps through which the \"fall\" of Eve could have played such arole. Yet it follows from the present research that the connection betweenthe \"fall\" of Eve and the fall of Sophia is best understood when the fol-lowing mythologoumena, first developed in pre-Gnostic Jewish literature,are taken into account:The rape of Eve.The imperfect beings (nepi/inn-Giants -abortions) emerging fromsinful sexual unions.The heavenly counterparts of Eve and Adam.The double identification of the descent of the angels with a fail;and of this fall with the fall of Satan and his seduction of Eve.50f Marcion's \"Cainite\" attitude to the biblical text, Harnack could say: \"Das wahreChristentumisdaher objectivbiblische Theologie and nicht anderes\";Marcion: DasEvangeliunr vonr frenrden Gott: Eine_ur Geschichu' der Grundlegung der kadrolischenKirclre; Neuc .Studien zu Marrion (TU 45; Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1924), 142.6\"Das Problem der Beziehung zwischen Judentum and Gnosis,\" Ka/ros 7(1965),124-133.7\"The Gnostic Sophia Myth,\" 99.In Gnostic texts, Sophia was also linked with theheavenly Anthropos. The relationship between these two figures has been discussed both byBousset (Hcruptprobleme, 217) and by Quispel (\"Der gnostische Anthropos,\" 214, 223).Bousset favors the historical precedence of the Urnrensch, while Quispel thinks that only laterdid this myth take the place of Sophia's fall.This discussion now appears to be outdated.The new texts make it clear that the male and female aspects of God and of the ImmortalMan are concomitant in Gnostic thought.See, for instance, D. M. Parrot, \"Evidence ofReligious Syncretism in Gnostic Texts from Nag Hammadi,\" in Pearson, ed., Religious.Swrcretisin in Antiyui(v, 173-189, esp. 178-179. Sophia and Anthropos shouldbe seen as com-plementary parts of the complex Gnostic myth that seeks to explain the emergenceof bothevil and the pure seed; the difference between these two principles, asSchenke points out(Der Gort \"Mensch\", 67), is that while Sophia functions on a cosmological level, theAnthro-pos functions as an anthropogonical principle.Only in Manichaeisni would the Anthroposbecome integrated to the cosmological myth. "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"172CONCLUSIONEvery piece of evidence seems to confirm the conjecture that the cradleof some of the earliest Gnostic groups was among Palestinian or Syrianbaptist sects of Jewish background.8 The precise social milieu and condi-tions in which Gnosticism arose, however, remain beyond our grasp.Similarly, and despite the overall presence of Seth in Gnostic mythology,we remain unable to detect the actual existence of a specific group of\"Sethians,\" as the Church Fathers described them. But this question issecondary to the main problem raised by research into Gnostic origins:How did the passage from the Jewish God to the Gnostic demiurge, frommonotheism to dualism, come about? How could the idea of an ignorantcreator, weak and witless, arise on the fringes of Judaism? We speak of\"dialectics\" or of \"revolution,\"9 but such terms merely underscore thestrangeness of the phenomenon, they do not explain it.It would seem, however, that a hierarchical duality between God andHis demiurgic angel did develop inside Judaism, before the first Christiancentury, in order to answer the problem of biblical anthropomorphisms.10The Gnostics, who were obsessed by another problem, that of theexistence of evil and its source, picked up this duality between God andthe demiurge and radicalized it by demonizing the demiurge and identify-ing him with Satan.Here, too, the identification of evil with matter,important though it may be, is only secondary to the demonizationpro-cess, which transformed a hierarchical duality into a coigflic/ing dualism.The same puzzling passage from monotheism to dualism can also beobserved in early Manichaeism. The myths analyzed here in no way indi-cate that Manichaeism represented an \"Iranian\" form of Gnostic dualism,as opposed to those trends represented by the Nag Hammadi texts and thereports of the Church Fathers.'' Genetic analysis of some of the basicManichaean myths reveals the same Jewish sources that underlie otherGnostic myths, strengthening what has become indubitable since thediscovery of' the Cologne Mani Codex: that Mani grew up ina Jewish-Christian gnosticizing community. How texts such as the Book oj' Giantswere transmitted to Mani and his disciples is not known. A chain such asQumran (Essenes) -Jewish-Christian groups -> Syriac \"Gnostic\" Chris-tians -> Manichaeans remains speculative.12 Here again, the basic fact is8Bohlig, Kopnsche-gnosliscltc Apokulipsen, 95; MacRae, \"Apoc.

"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"THE GNOSTIC SEXUAL MYTH173that Enoch and related material were current in a number of circles andplayed a major role in the crystallization of Gnostic mythologies.In the course of his anti-Manichaean polemics (in Contra Faustuni),Augustine coined the expression salvator salvandus. The religionsgeschi-cht/iche Schule considered the myth of the savior who himself needed sal-vation to be the central Gnostic myth. While the figure of Norea may infact fit this conception, Norea is not the central Gnostic savior figure; shemay equally be viewed as representing the Gnostics themselves in theircombat against the archons. For their main savior figure, Seth, we havefound no evidence that he ever needed to be saved.13 The words of A/lo-genes 50:33-36 are appropriate here: \"that youmight escape in safety tothe One who is yours, who was first to save and who does not need to besaved.\"It could not be said more clearly that for the Gnostic author, sal-vator salvandus non est. The notion of a \"redeemedredeemer\" does notseem to be inherent to all Gnostic trends.The findings of the presentwork thus agree with those of C. Colpe, who found the model of theGnostic erloster Erloser, as propounded by Reitzenstein, to be wanting.14The Christian heresiologists often accused the Gnostics of lewdness andlicentiousness, sometimes with appalling details of the Gnostics' sexualbehavior. 15 Nothing in the Gnostic texts themselves supports these accu-sations. On the contrary, the texts consistently reiterate their total con-demnation of lustful acts. This discrepancy has led some scholars to insistupon the element of slander in the descriptions of the ChurchFathers. 16Yet the phenomenon may be explained without total reliance on defama-tion. The obsessive preoccupation of the Gnostics with sex, as reflectedin their mythology, could well have shocked the Fathers, who misinter-preted it as a clear sign of their unchaste behavior.But the student ofreligion should not be surprised by the combination of strongly asceticbehavior and sexually-centered mythology.17In 1826 Daniel Parker, a Baptist preacher in Georgia, published a pam-phlet in which he established his doctrine of the \"two-seeds-in-the-Spirit.\" According to it, two seeds were planted in Eve, one by God andthe other by Satan; the election of each individual is determined by theseed from which he or she came. Everyone is thus either a Son of God ora \"son of Satan.\" And there still exists in theUnited States a small13Contra H.-C.
