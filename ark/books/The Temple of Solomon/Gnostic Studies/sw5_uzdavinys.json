One is that it is arite conducted by men, which preserves our natural order in the uni-verse; the other is that it is empowered by divine symbols 2 and is raisedup on high through them and joined to the gods and proceeds harmoni-ously toward the fulfilment of their purposes. This latter aspect can rightlybe called “putting on the form of the gods” 3. When Iamblichus speaksabout “the form of the gods,” one ought to remember that the gods,both as the principles of manifested reality and administrators of theurgicreintegration, can be equated with arithmoi—a sort of aggregation ofPythagorean metaphysical numbers that stand as the graceful transcend-ent masters and models for the entire manifestation of the lower beings.As Proclus asserts, the gods are nothing but the primordial and self-suf-ficient principles of beings4, so that theology is a science of these princi-ples5, or rather the exegesis of intellectual substance6.The aim of our article is not to discuss the metaphysical principles1.The title given by Marsilio Ficino.

Frithjof Schuon, for instance, tries to introduce theterm “theurgy” in the universally understood religious sense as a vehicleof barakah and irradiation of the sacred. We are told that it is natural forman...to make use of sensory supports towards the progress of his spirit or the equilib-rium of his soul. These supports are either artistic, and so symbolistic and aes-thetic, or theurgic; in the latter case their function is to act as the vehicle of ben-efic, protective, and sanctifying forces; the two types can moreover be combined.7The author here tacitly follows the tradition of Iamblichus and seemsto accept the remark of Jean Trouillard who defines theurgy as “unsymbolisme opératoire destiné à éveiller la presence divine” and adds:“la théurgie n’est pas la magie.”8 Schuon makes the same distinctionwhen he explains: we say theurgy, and not magic, given that the forcesthat act in this case have their raison d’etre and their essential source inDivine Grace and not in human art.9Neoplatonic theurgy employed ritual in order to reveal the vestiges of adivine presence and subordinate man to the divine will—precisely the op-posite of sorcery (goe ̄teia), as most leading contemporary scholars observe.Therefore if, for Iamblichus, philosophy as a human art meant the demon-stration of truths through intellectual discourse, theurgy, however, neitherdemonstrated nor proved but rather lifted the soul directly into the divineand was initiated through the power of the gods themselves. As a conse-quence, one cannot avoid suspecting that theurgic kle ̄sis, invocation, is insome respect analogous to dhikr in Islamic mysticism.In the most general (or even metaphorical) sense, theurgy is proxi-mate to sacred art and both macrocosmic and microcosmic liturgy. Thus,despite the differences in meaning by various thinkers on such conceptsas ‘substance’ and ‘essence’, one should agree with Schuon’s assertionas follows:Every sacred symbol is an “enlightening form” that invites to a “liberating rite”;7.Frithjof Schuon The Function of Relics in Esoterism as Principle and as Way,trans.W.Stoddart, Perennial Books, 1990, p.2058.Jean Trouillard L’Un et l’âme selon Proclos, Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1972, pp.171-1899.Frithjof Schuon The Function of Relics, p. 205"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"109SACRED WEB 5the “form” reveals the Essence to us, whereas the “rite” leads back to the Sub-stance; to the Substance we are, the only one that is. All this concerns on the onehand sacred art, “liturgy”, and on the other hand the beauties of nature.10No wonder that J.Trouillard equates theurgy with Christiansacramentalism, emphasizing their common principles, including simi-lar notions of Divine grace, since, according to Iamblichus, “the tokens(sunthe ̄mata) themselves, by themselves, effect their own work”11. Thegeneral idea of theurgy requires perceiving the world as “a fabric oftheophanies”12 and imagining, in one sense or another, the multi-dimen-sional dialectical game between the One (to hen) and many, along witha providential kind of love (ero ̄s pronoe ̄tikos) by which the higher causescontain and care for their effects.Laurence J. Rosán goes so far as to equate the theurgic operation witha kind of “aesthetic technique” by which the mystical experience is initi-ated. By meditating on sacred symbols and uttering mysterious divinenames, the Neoplatonic sages (such as Proclus, for instance) used toconcentrate on the unity of some thing or idea, and after the sense ofunity was grasped, tried to transfer this intuition of oneness to one’sown self and its relationship with the One Reality. But Rosán too hastilyconcludes (as if following the Aristotelian procedure of extracting the‘higher’ from the ‘lower’) that:All that the term “theurgy” or “theosophy” should denote, strictly speaking, isthis aesthetic technique of obtaining a feeling of unity from sensory perceptionsof material or meditation on evocative ideas.13He further speculates that “whatever the actual content of Proclus’mystical experience as such, it must have been pervaded by the memoryof having made these aesthetic and religiously theurgic efforts,” includ-ing visual aesthetic contemplations of nature, similar to the Taoist orZen aesthetics, and also what might be called “mantric” meditations ondivine names and “mandalic” concentrations on symbols.14 But Rosan10.

The sacred (hiera), perfect (teleia),and godlike objects only provided a “complete and pure receptacle” forthe god15. When Dionysius the Areopagite, who in many respects faith-fully follows his Neoplatonic masters, describes the Christian sacramentsas theurgic mysteries16, he without hesitation introduces Christ as theprinciple (arche ̄) and essence (ousia) “of every theurgy”17.Despite various shades of the term theourgia, originally it appearedin the Middle Platonic milieu, and later on was adopted by certainNeoplatonists and used as a synonym for “hieratic art” (hieratike ̄ techne ̄)understood as a sacramental means for the ascent of the soul. The sac-ramental world-view, far from standing in opposition to the intellectualrigor of Neoplatonic dialectic or contemplation, should be regarded asthe matrix of their intellectual tradition. Though, according to Iamblichus,“intellectual understanding does not connect theurgists with divine be-ings” (oude gar he ̄ ennoia sunaptei tois theois theourgois: De myst.96.13),theurgy cannot be reduced either to “a manifesto of irrationalism”18 nora one-sided mysticism which denies corporeality altogether.The term theourgia most probably was coined by a certain Julianuswho lived under Marcus Aurelius, the son of the elder Julianus, a“Chaldean philosopher,” according to Suidas. The adjective “Chaldean”here means simply “a master of occult sciences.” The theological or Pla-tonic oracles (ta logia), the scattered fragments of which were collectedby Western scholars under the title of “Chaldean Oracles”and even de-scribed as “die Bibel der Neuplatoniker,” are theoparadota, i.e. receivedfrom the gods. They were edited in hexameter verses by the youngerJulianus, who himself, as the Byzantine writer Psellus asserts, has been15. (De myst.V.23.)16. (ta theourga musteria: Epist.9.1.)17.

According to the scornful and sarcastic remark of a renowned mod-ern scholar regarding these verses,their diction is so bizarre and bombastic, their thought so obscure and incoher-ent, as to suggest rather the trance utterances of modern “spirit guides” than thedeliberate efforts of a forger.19Though the origin of the strictly Neoplatonic theurgy cannot be con-nected exclusively with these philosophical oracles in which some genu-ine elements of both Iranian and Mesopotamian traditions can be de-tected under the surface of their Platonic terminology, it seems clearthat the nouns theourgia and theourgos were coined after the pattern oftheologia and theologos: as the theologians talked about the gods (theyare hoi theia legontes), so the theurgists not only traced the descent ofthe divine into matter but, through the unutterable symbols, which aregod-sent and comprehended only by the gods, ensured the soul’s puri-fication and return to the divine realm.The souls of the genuine theurgists are said to derive from the angelicworld. Since theurgy presupposes the active participation of the godsthemselves, it can be characterized as “divine action” understood, firstof all, as the action of the Divine on behalf of men. Theurgy as a sacra-mental praxis is aimed at the purification and salvation of the soul (tespsuche ̄s so ̄te ̄rion: De myst.I.12). The soul is conducted upward by thegods through the countless intermediaries: angels, daimons and specifi-cally Chaldean spiritual entities such as the Iynges, Connectors(sunocheis) and Teletarchs. These various entities for the most part func-tion as diverse aspects of the noetic cosmos or the world of Ideas. TheIynges, for instance, understood in the Middle-Platonic fashion as theThoughts or Ideas of the Father, are actually magical or sacramental names(voces mysticae) sent forth by God to communicate with the theurgists.The mystic rays of the divine Sun flow down toward earth and minglewith the rays of the rising soul of the theurgist.Though our present knowledge about secret theurgic rites and initiationsis at best incomplete and sometimes close to nothing, it seems that theurgyritually imitated the laws of cosmogony and was based, at least in somerespect, on the archaic notions of sumpatheia and philia. The universal19. E.R. Dodds, ibid., p.284"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"112SACRED WEB 5sympathy assumes a direct correspondence between a given deity and itssymbolic representations in the animal, mineral, and vegetable kingdom.Theurgy accepts the idea of the divine help (boe ̄theia) and conjunction orcontact (sustasis) with the gods who are initially without form (atupo ̄ta) butwho take on various shapes in order to become visible to human sight:descending into pure receptacles or manifesting themselves as luminousapparitions. The technical terms for these self-manifestations such as autoptonagalma and autopton phasmasin are mentioned in the extent fragments ofthe Chaldean Oracles (fr.101 and 142).Hierocles observes that initiation into theurgical mysteries worked onthe same principle as purification in mathematical analysis (In Carmenaureum 26.116.21 ff). Therefore Shaw argues that the “reference to theσυμπαθεια which exists throughout the cosmos does not explain theurgy,because the power of theurgy is rooted in the gods, who utterly tran-scended the sympathies of which they are the αρχαι.”20 However, thetranscendence of the gods or henads does not prevent the analogies tobe discovered everywhere in accordance with the famous dictum (re-peated often by Numenius and Proclus): panta en pasin: “all things arein all things.” By the means of metaphysical exegesis even the languageof agriculture may be blended with the language of mysteries. Proclusattests that his master Syrianus conceived the rites of the sacrifice of-fered up by the Homeric Achilles at the funeral pile of Patroclus(Illiad.XXIII.192f) as an imitation of the soul’s immortalization, performedby the theurgists21. According to this explanation, Achilles’ invocation tothe winds proceeds from his intention that the subtle vehicle (ochema)of Patroclus’ soul should be cleansed and restituted to its native order,being drawn upwards. Thus Syrianus regards Achilles as the prototypeof the theurgical officiant and Patroclus as that of the aspirant who is tobe initiated into the mysteries and his soul separated by certain “sacredmethods” (heirais methodois). Patroclus laid out upon the pyre resem-bles the initiate who has undergone a symbolic death and burial, whileAchilles represents the priest or master of the initiation.As Shaw meticulously pointed out:20.

The soul participates inperfecting the divine descent by assisting to transform the manifest chaosinto cosmos, and thus aids the gods in the creation and salvation of theworld. Therefore “the soul’s ascent and salvation is necessarily the sal-vation of the world.”23The Platonic paideia understood as a process of recollection by meansof contemplation (moving from the sensible objects to the intelligibleForms) is rendered into the set of sacramental rites and cosmic liturgythat embraces all degrees of the manifested reality and becomes a sortof hieratic education which culminates in a mystical vision and theurgicunion. The sense of divine beauty and unity is crucial in both cases. Thereal or imagined anagogical ascent is conducted by the singing of sacredhymns, the uttering of perfect (teleia) and true (ale ̄thine) prayers, andsupported by material, intermediary and noetic symbols (sunthe ̄mata).We are told in the Chaldean Oracles that:the Paternal Intellect has sown symbols throughout the cosmos (sumbola garpatrikos noos espeiren kata kosmon), [the Intellect] which thinks the intelligibles.And [these intelligibles] are called inexpressible beauties.24In the Middle Platonic and Chaldean context these symbols are equatedboth with the thoughts of the Paternal Intellect and the potencies of Erosholding together the parts of the universe. They presuppose the funda-mental triad of faith (pistis), truth (ale ̄theia) and love (ero ̄s). Faith givescontact with divine goodness, truth supports wisdom (sophia) and lovereveals divine beauty. Therefore Proclus asserts:Everything is saved by these means and joined to the original causes, some thingsthrough erotic madness. others through divine philosophy, others again throughtheurgic power (dia te ̄s theourgike ̄s dunameo ̄s), which is greater than all human22.

The gods themselvesare understood as henads or the first principles of being, life and intelli-gence. The term anago ̄ge ̄ itself goes back to Plato, who used variants ofthe verb anagein to describe both the ascent of certain heroes from Hadesto Olympus (Rep.VII.521c) as well as the leading up of the soul throughdialectical reasoning (Rep.VII.533d). For Plotinus anago ̄ge ̄ means a con-templative process which assures the increasing degrees of intellectualpurification.For ‘all the theurgists’ (hoi hieratikoi pantes), who are no less than‘true athletes of the Fire’ (De myst.92.13-14), the leading up of the soul isnot simply dialectical ascent supported by pure contemplation, but asacramental or ritual event: the ineffable mystagogy (he arrhe ̄temustagogia) which includes a sort of mystical arithmology and producesvarious degrees of illumination based on the concept of a luminous so-lar body (augoeides soma) able to receive the divine light. Since the sun‘measures all things’ and is ‘analogous to the One’ (Procl.InParm.1045.6-9), the sunthe ̄ma of sun as a symbol of the noetic fire constitutes one ofthe central mystery of Neoplatonic theurgy. As in Iranian Sufism of NajmRazi, the capacity to perceive the noetic light (to noe ̄ton pho ̄s) partlydepends on invocation (dhikr in Sufism) which consist in reciting “nameswithout meaning” (ta asema onomata), sounds that are both sunthe ̄mataand agalmata—“des statues que sont les noms divins,” according toSaffrey,26 thus imitating the Demiurge in creation.Nevertheless, despite the apparent distinction between operations ofhieratike ̄ techne ̄ and philosophical contemplation, the two cannot beseparated. Though theurgy deals with the unutterable symbols and theunspeakable acts (erga) which are beyond all understanding (huperpasan noe ̄sin: De myst.II.11.96-97), it does not reject or even reduce theweight of the rational thinking which constitutes a considerable aspect25.

In some respect theurgy is an outgrowth of theNeoplatonic dialectic and negative theology as well as of the metaphysi-cal exegesis of certain texts of Plato made in accord with the archaicmythology of mysteries (teletai). Trouillard, for instance, uses Plato’smyth of the procession of the gods in the Phaedrus in order to reveal thecosmological structure in which Neoplatonic theurgy works. He rejectsthe common contemporary hypothesis about the duality of ways inNeoplatonism, namely, “rational” and “irrational” (the latter is usuallycondemned as “une décadence” or as “bewitching hocus-pocus”practitioned by certain “solemn triflers”), and regards the later HellenicNeoplatonism as one integral spiritual path which leads from moralpurifications and dialectical demonstrations to contemplation and finallyto theurgy which enables the unio mystica.27 Even the sequence andarrangement of the selected texts, that ought to be studied with the guid-ance of a master, are anagogical and imitate the ascent through the sevengrades of virtue, namely, natural (phusikai), ethical (ethikai), civic(politikai), purificatory (kathartikai), theoretic (theoretikai), paradigmatic(paradeigmatikai) and hieratic (hieratikai) virtues. The last set of aretaicome into being in the godlike (theoeides) elements of the soul and areproper to the One. The supreme holiness is no less than the supremeunion with the ultimate divine Principle which is beyond-Being.Despite the well-known passage from Damascius’ commentary onPlato’s Phaedo which contrasts “those who honor philosophy more highlyas Porphyry and Plotinus” and others who “honor more highly the hier-atic art (hieratike ̄)”28 as do Iamblichus, Syrianus, and Proclus, the under-lying similarities in Plotinus’, Iamblichus’, and Proclus’ approach to mys-tical union suggest that their differences are more semantic (or differ-ences in degree, mode, and style) than substantive. All of them empha-size that (notwithstanding occasionally different premises, methods, andexercises) the union (henosis) of the soul with the divine was causedand produced entirely by the divine.In sharp contrast to modern scholars who prefer to regard the use ofsacramental theurgy as “an enlightened type of sorcery” (Cumont), as“the corruption of Platonic rationalism with Oriental superstition” (Dodds)27.

For Iamblichus and Proclus theurgy was no less than culmina-tion or rather ‘transcendental’ prolongation of philosophy and rationaldialectic. The soul cannot ascend to the One by its own discursive power,since all levels of manifestation must be integrated and reverted upontheir supreme source which, while presiding above intellect, neverthe-less is represented by certain transcendent henads at every level of be-ing. Though “every god is above Being, above Life, and above Intelli-gence,”29 “the procession of all things existent and all cosmic orders ofexistents extends as far as do the orders of gods”30.The tendency to marginalize theurgy reflects the tendency to interpretancient philosophy as a progressive one-way movement from muthosto logos that means the passage from naive “irrational superstitions” tothe light of “rationality.” It reflects, as Shaw pointed out,a post-Enlightenment prejudice that ritual behavior exhibits a more “primitive”and “lower” stage in man’s evolution than “pure” thought31In the context of such ‘anti-ritualistic’ prejudices, Saffrey speaks of “lemirage de la théurgie”32 and asserts that “Plotinus alone appears as aheroic exception (un exception héroique) to this general crazy infatua-tion.”33 We prefer the view of Peter Kingsley that the Neoplatonists sim-ply revitalized “a centuries-old tradition” of dry and one-sided rational-ism34 by returning (through henological analysis, which images and wordstransforms into icons and allows the unifying and deifying experienceto occur) to the heart of perennial wisdom as the origin of Hellenic orother therapeutic philosophy, understood as the living praxis and a setof spiritual exercises aimed at transformation of all aspects of man.

The late Hellenic philosophers far fromfalling for the anti-intellectualist craze, realized the limits and aporias ofany human discourse: at last, there is no ‘One’ to reach, because thisword itself is merely a supreme sunthe ̄ma of the Ineffable. They wereafraid that merely rational and mental ascent to the One in some respectmay turn to be a discursive fantasy. Therefore they took inspiration notmerely from propositional logic, but from the theological oracles of thePlatonizing circle of Juliani and ancient Egyptian and Assyrian wisdomas well as from the types of love that had sustained Orphics and earlyPythagoreans.The abuses and misunderstandings of theurgy have no bearing uponit as an operative and esoteric kernel of the late Hellenic philosophy andreligion the sacramental techne ̄ which was too easily but inevitably con-demned by the Christian exoteric theologians and too easily acceptedand discredited by some modern and pre-modern occult circles. It isevident that the Neoplatonic theurgy proper cannot be revived and usedin our times even if our knowledge concerning its ritual operations andunderlying mythological and metaphysical premises would be more pro-found. But one ought to remember that Neoplatonism (which itself isunderstood a sort of mystical monotheism by Kenney35) far from beingmerely a “pagan superstition” or a narrow-minded “rationalism” appealsto revelation and divine inspiration as the source of its wisdom. Both theliving tradition (paradosis) and initiation are indispensable for theNeoplatonic theurgy which cannot be regarded apart from ancient Hel-lenic cosmology and physiology and the higher forms of sophisticatedspiritual hermeneutics. Marinus attests36 that Proclus received the wholetheurgic science from Asclepigeneia, the daughter of Syrianus’ masterPlutarch of Athens. In addition to his strictly Aristotelian and Platonicphilosophical education, we are told that Proclus learned “all of Hel-lenic and non-Hellenic theology and also that truth which had been hid-den in the form of myths.37 He praised not only the Greek gods but,35.

The old men, car-rying voluminous purses and dressed in leathern garments, took the girl,and “no one found out into what mysteries they initiated her” and“whether they were heroes or daimons or belonged to some race evenmore divine.”39Several decades ago Henry Corbin sought to re-establish the termtheourgia and find its equivalents within the Islamic Platonism of Iran.While discussing such terms as hikmat ila ̄hı ̄ya (divine wisdom), hakimmota’allih and hakim ila ̄hi (divine sage), Corbin argued that they shouldbe rendered by their Neoplatonic equivalents, namely, theosophia andtheosophos recpectively. Now, if the word ta’alloh covers the same groundof connotations as does ‘theurgy’ in the late Hellenic Neoplatonism, theword mota’allih could be understood as “le sage théurge, ou lehiératique.”40 “Aussi bien le hiératique,” writes Corbin, “est-il unecatégorie qui encandre toute la vision sohrawardienne du monde, oùchaque espèce est la théurgie, l’oeuvre hiératique de son Ange.”41 Corbingoes to suggest that the Suhrawardian terms sanam and tilism might berendered as “icon” and “theurgy” respectively. Since the word talismanmay be an Arabic transformation of Greek telesma (initiation), it seemsthat the Neoplatonic term sunthe ̄ma stands more close to the meaningof tilism than “theurgy” which itself cannot be equated to some particu-lar objects or tokens (be they natural or artificial) of both microcosmic38.

Nevertheless, Corbin writes: “Car l’espècecorporelle est comme une ombre, une projection, une icone (sanam)de son Ange, une théurgie (tilism, grec telesma) opérée par lui dans lebarzakh qui par soi-même est mort et nuit absolue.”42In this respect we should bear in mind that long before theSuhrawardian school rose up in Syria and Iran, the Hellenic transmittersof theological oracles in the Second and Third centuries had alreadymythologized the world of Platonic Ideas and interpreted them as hier-archically ordered spiritual entities, angels included. Therefore whenCorbin argues that the Persian Platonists interpreted Platonic Ideas interms of Zoroastrian angelology,43 this practice partly reflects the age-old Chaldean tradition. The term ‘Chaldean’ had come to denote theblending of Iranian and Mesopotamian traditions which occurred chieflyas a result of Cyrus’ conquest of Babylon,44 but in the late Roman empireit simply meant an adept of occult sciences, astrology and magic,sometomes a charlatan, and a master of theurgical anago ̄ge ̄ (inductio),whatever one’s origin, whether it be Syrian, Greek, or Roman. The tracesof theurgic legacy could be traced in such esoteric works as Ghayat al-Hakim (Aim of the Sages) and Kitab al-Filaha al-nabatiya (NabateanAgriculture, which deals not with the agriculture, but with the hiddenproperties of natural things).
