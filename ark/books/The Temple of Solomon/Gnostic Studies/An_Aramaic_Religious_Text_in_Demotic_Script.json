BOWMAN UT of the past come many chal- 3 lenges to the world of modern ~Jscholarship. To the credit of mod- ern scholars it can be said that such chal- lenges often can be met. By laborious study it has been possible to recover much of the ancient languages of the past so that, for example, the Assyriologist can read Akkadian and the Egyptologist can read Egyptian with remarkable facility. The difficulties still encountered in read- ing ancient languages when written in normal fashion are yet great enough; but, when some ancient person deliberately deviates from the accepted manner of writing, he causes a confusion that puts modern scholarship to the test. Such has been the history of a still unpublished papyrus that has been a tantalizing enig- ma for some years.2 This papyrus is inscribed both recto and verso in demotic script that is largely alphabetic in character. There are at least twenty-one columns of about nineteen or twenty lines to the column. The right end of the verso is badly damaged through the first five to seven columns. Since there is no photograph of the first sheet of the verso, it is uncertain whether this portion is blank or inscribed. Nor are there photo- graphs of the most damaged portions of the verso. These matters will have to be ascertained when the papyrus reaches this country. Although written in demotic fashion, the text cannot be read as Egyptian. This is the unanimous opinion of the Egyptolo- gists at home and abroad who have ex- amined the papyrus and tried to decipher it. F. L1. Griffiths, expert in demotic Egyptian writing, has described it as be- ing in \"Persian demotic\" written \"in un- intelligible groups of demotic alphabetic characters with the determination !a\" and has said: \"Bits of it look like magic gibberish, but there seems too much of it without any Egyptian directions or other details, and we [i.e., Griffiths and Sir H. Thompson] think it may be in a foreign language.\" As to its possible nature he writes: \"It doesn't seem like any known language, but it might be in some African form of speech.\"3 One need not exclude Semitic languages from consideration, for there are several examples of them written in abnormal mediums. The phonetic rendering of Phoenician into Latin characters by Plautus in the Poenulus produced what appeared in Latin to be gibberish but is now treasured as the principal source of our knowledge of Carthaginian Phoeni- cian.4 Graffiti scratched in Latin char- 1 The substance of this article formed the presi- dential paper read before the Mid-West branch of the American Oriental Society at Evanston, Ill., on April 6, 1943. The title of that paper, \"An Aramaic Crypto- gram,\" has here been abandoned to avoid misunder- standing owing to the current narrow connotation of \"cryptogram.\" However, in the original sense of \"se- cret writing,\" as indicated below, the writer believes the term \"cryptogram\" is still applicable. 2 Formerly in the Amherst collection, this papyrus is now the property of the J. P. Morgan Library. It has not yet come to this country and remains in the British Museum. Our work up to this point has been done from photographs alone. :3 These ideas are expressed by Griffith in a card to a fellow-demotist, Wilhelm Spiegelberg of Heidelberg, dated February 8, 1921, now in the file of Professor William F. Edgerton of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. There, too, is another card from Professor G. Mbller of Berlin to Dr. Spiegelberg, in which the former confesses his inability to read the papyrus. Dr. Edgerton acquired this correspondence, along with the photographs upon which this work is based, after the death of Professor Spiegelberg. 4 J. J.

The nor- mal expectation in the Persian period, to which this perplexing papyrus has been assigned, would be that if the text were not in Egyptian it would be in Aramaic. In order to test the hypothesis that it was in Aramaic, it was necessary to tran- scribe the predominantly alphabetic text into the equivalent Hebrew-Aramaic characters. It was natural with such al- phabetic material that there should have been sporadic attempts at such transcrip- tion, but they produced no successful clue to the nature of the language in which it was written, for the predominance of the letter Daleph and the presence of some genuine demotic group writing made the transcribed text appear as \"gibberish\" or an \"African form of speech\" rather than something more easily recognizable. Since I knew no demotic, Dr. Hughes of the Oriental Institute, who had been working on the papyrus, selected for transcription for me a portion of text that was pre- dominantly alphabetic in character and relatively free from demotic writing for which alphabetic values could not readily be assigned. The transcription was punctuated fre- quently by a symbol for a particular Egyptian determinative. Even one who is ignorant of demotic is attracted by the flaglike vertical stroke that occurs at somewhat regular intervals throughout the photographs of the text. This is the demotic equivalent of the hieroglyphic de- terminative \"man-with-his-hand-to-his- mouth\" mentioned by Griffith as charac- terizing the papyrus. Most demotic words conclude with the writing of a determina- tive, some character that gives a clue to the meaning of the word, indicating cate- gory in nouns and class of action in verbs. Among the determinatives discovered with nouns in our papyrus are indicators for \"woman,\" \"divinity,\" and \"foreign land,\" which, for convenience, will be transcribed in this study by the numbers 4, 2, and 9, respectively. The \"man-with- his-hand-to-his-mouth\" determinative is used in Egyptian to indicate actions in- volving the mouth, such as \"to eat,\" \"to speak,\" and \"to be silent.\" Normally there is considerable variety in the use of determinatives in demotic, but our scribe, who uses many fewer determinatives than usual, has hit upon the \"man-with-his- hand-to-his-mouth\" as the determinative to be used in all cases in which no other determinative seemed pertinent to him. In the great majority of cases the de- terminative is not appropriate to the ac- tion or to the category of noun involved. It has become, in effect, merely a word- divider used when no other determina- tive was deemed necessary. We may con- jecture that the choice of this determina- tive as a general terminator for words is probably due to the association of the de- terminative with the verbal actions of either \"speaking\" or \"remaining silent.\" The determinatives are of great value in this papyrus both for giving some indi- cation of the length of words and, fre- 1806), Part I, pp. 14 f.

There is no spacing of words in the papyrus. With- in the determinatives the writing is pre- dominantly alphabetic, although a gener- ous amount of Egyptian nonalphabetic writing is also encountered. At first glance the transcribed text looks strange and decidedly unfamiliar, for the words between the determinatives are almost invariably too long to be Semitic and the letter Daleph is found with distressing frequency. One can under- stand the epithets \"gibberish\" and \"Afri- can form of speech\" to designate such a text. A portion of the material so tran- scribed appears as follows:'7 acteristics of Aramaic, the emphatic state of the noun. Observing these phenomena, I at once decided to ignore, temporarily at least, all aleph's other than final ones, in order to see what the result might be. The text so derived looked much more familiar, for a triconsonantal basis for the language was at once apparent, confirm- ing my suspicion that it was Semitic in character. The resultant material had every appearance of being an unvocalized text that would have to be read as Semitic: Nj2 b51 Boil InN=31 W'd,= 1 1 1 +:;* l~ * d~z mN* , *31 * ::;'nr?* 11 * 1 1* H ~:I: ?- CI\" *N'U9*\"n~*C *W The use of the gutturals heth and cain in the transcription suggests that the lan- guage is Semitic.

As the work progressed, familiar Se- mitic prefixes and suffixes appeared, all inclining toward those normally associ- ated with Aramaic. The terminations -in and -dn, marking the forms of plural nouns, eliminated from consideration the Canaanite dialects, including Hebrew. Sometimes a yodh appeared before the final aleph to suggest the emphatic plural form of the masculine noun in Aramaic. When the third-person masculine singular suffix attached to plural nouns was found to be -6hz, a peculiar development of the pronoun that is the exclusive property of Aramaic among the Semitic languages, the identification of the language of the papyrus as Aramaic was conclusive. This pronominal ending can be illustrated in a 7 In this transcription furnished by Dr. Charles F. 11 1 Nims the symbols t, 1, and M are mere variant forms of those letters. The \"1, usually to be transcribed as lamedh, may sometimes represent rash (which is usual- ly represented by 1), as parallels show.

Griffith (The Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leiden [London, 1909], p. 25) indicates has the value of MN in the Ahmimic dialect of Upper Egypt. W. Spiegel- berg concurs in his Demotische Grammatik (Heidelberg, 1925), p. 100. Since this sign in this papyrus inter- changes with the demotic group for the god Min, the reading mn here seems to be confirmed. The phonetic peculiarity involved may give some clue to the home of the scribe or the place in which the demotic text was written. The sign functions as the Aramaic preposition It, \"from,'\" in the papyrus. Asterisks are used to repre- sent the determinative \"man-with-hand-to-mouth,'\" which functions as a word-divider in the papyrus. Usage set here will be maintained throughout the paper.

Demotic determinatives and de- motic nonalphabetic groups for which alphabetic equivalents cannot be deter- mined as yet, interspersed among the al- phabetic materials, cause many problems. Equally troublesome, however, is the lim- ited character of the demotic alphabet.9 Just as most Semitic alphabets are too limited to indicate accurately the full richness of the Semitic phonetic system, so the demotic alphabet, despite its having many variant forms for some letters, is too limited to distinguish properly between all the various sounds represented by the Hebrew-Aramaic alphabet. The letters d, z, and 1 are apparently entirely lacking or, at least, cannot be fully differentiated in in hieratic, tended to coalesce and were probably both pronounced t when the papyrus was written. Further study, how- ever, may indicate that a particular char- acter is used to represent d. There was no sign for I in the early period of demotic, al- though the sound was apparently recog- nized. Where this sound is to be indicated in the papyrus the letter r is employed. Two forms of rash are used. True rash, de- rived probably from the hieroglyph \"lion\" (the ra sign), is usually found in the papyrus where we would expect 1, but some parallels, like that above, indicate that it may also serve as rish. The other, more complicated, manner of writing resh, derived from the group writing for \"mouth\" (Coptic ro), is probably always used for true rash. The acrophonic principle, here ob- served in the production of the consonant rash from the words r' and ro, has long been recognized as fundamental in the de- velopment of the Semitic alphabet. Some- what in desperation, I have assumed that this principle is operative in all those cases in the papyrus in which nonalpha- betic, multiconsonantal groups are to be reduced to simple alphabetic writing. Often the consonantal factor that must be ignored is an obvious intrusion into an otherwise easily recognized Semitic word. Dr. Nims informs me, for example, that 8 Brackets inclose material supplied where the papyrus is broken.

It is still too early to be dogmatic in proclaim- ing the validity of the principle under dis- cussion in the papyrus, and my colleagues are still conservatively suspicious of it; but so far the principle seems to work. Perhaps we shall find later that groups were chosen deliberately and that, as Hughes conjectures, \"he [the scribe] was trying to make some distinction with those groups. There must have been sounds he was put to it to represent with his mono-consonantal signs.\" If this be so, further work on the papyrus may demon- strate this fact, and it will prove of great value in our study of Semitic phonetics. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to use the entire syllable of a nonalphabetic demotic group in the formation of a Semitic word. There is some indication that under such circumstances a phonetic complement may be written to make this clear. This is apparently true in the name 5X\"451 mentioned below, wherein the group 51 is demotic in and is followed by the letter n evidently as a complement. Likewise, the preposition min, in the form of group 31, which is to be read as demotic mn but interchanges with the demotic writing of the name of the Egyptian god Min, is frequently followed by the phonet- ic complement n. But, as can be seen in the parallel presented above, such use of a complement with this word is not an in- variable practice. The manner of vocalizing the words in the papyrus is curious and instructive. Al- ready in the words 'tZ3 and M•1 above, the possibility of \"defective\" and \"plene\" writing has been indicated. There is some use in the papyrus of the con- sonants waw and yodh to indicate the long vowels i or 6 and i, as in other Semitic alphabetic writing. But the use of Daleph here is unusual for the early period of Aramaic. We find \"house\" written not only as n•2 (XX, 8; XXI, 8) but also as rhNW2 (XI, 5, 17), and the form n :lR (IX, 4) indicates how a prefixed form in the emphatic state is written. From the beginning it was apparent that the ma- jority of the Daleph's were not consonantal but vocalic. The scribe used the aleph to indicate vowels of the -a class just as the letter is used later in Jewish Aramaic1o and Mandaic.11 He did so without a knowledge of any system of written vocalization, for none had yet been established in the peri- od to which the papyrus has been as- signed. When I first discovered the sig- nificance of the vocalic aleph, I suggested that the papyrus was of relatively late date, Roman period or later; but the Egyptologists who have worked on it have all been adamant in supporting Griffith's suggested date, the Persian period. They indicate that the script, while not from the earliest part of the Persian period, is yet unlike the developed style of the Ptole- maic period. Subsequent morphological discoveries confirm this rather early date. In such a text as this it is difficult to de- termine whether the writer was an Aram- aean who had learned Egyptian, an Egyp- tian who had a smattering of Aramaic, or a bilingual person who was well acquaint- ed with both languages. It is significant that the material apparently had to be preserved, presumably as a ritual, in the Aramaic language. It now seems clear from parallels that the scribe was not com- posing in Aramaic but was recording his material phonetically, either as he had learned it by rote or, more probably, as it was dictated to him by an Aramaic-speak- ing person. A few phonetic difficulties un- covered in the parallel texts, unless they 10 G. Dalman, Grammatik des judisch-paldstinisch- en Aramdisch (2d ed.; Leipzig, 1905), sec. 12, pp. 70 ff.

It is significant that in the cuneiform-Aramaic vocalized text of the Seleucid age, according to Gordon, \"long medial -d is not usually differenti- ated from short -a.\"'13 When a vocalic Daleph and a consonantal aleph would be expected together in the papyrus, as when a word with initial aleph appears with a prefixed preposition ending in an -a-class vowel, a single Daleph may be written. Medial aleph sometimes is troublesome since, according to the system of vocaliza- tion, the Pecal participle of middle-weak roots, the third-person masculine singular of the Pecal perfect of middle- aleph roots, and the third-person masculine singular of the Pecal perfect of middle-weak roots would all be written in identical fashion, as 2•. Final Daleph, too, can be ambigu- ous. It not only may be the sign of the emphatic state of masculine nouns but may also represent the concluding vowel sound in the verba tertiae infirmae and ap- parently also, upon occasion, the third- person singular pronominal suffix, in both genders, where -h would normally be ex- pected. In comparing the vocalization of the papyrus with that of the corresponding \"classical\" Aramaic with respect to the relationship between the Daleph's and the shewa sounds, I was at first quite dis- turbed. Where the \"classical\" vocaliza- tion would demand t.e the papyrus T _ -- had bt.':OSA (IX, 5). Could Daleph be used to represent a shewa as well as a full vowel sound? But what I recognize as the Pecal perfect masculine form of the verb, written Zlp in \"classical\" Aramaic, is given as :Rip in the papyrus (VII, 18), with no indication of the initial shewa. The matter is again clarified by comparison with the practice in the cuneiform-Ara- maic text. There vocalic shewa is repre- sented by i,14 and \"short vowels in unac- cented open syllables are often, if not usually, retained.\"15 The vocalization of the papyrus is thus earlier than that of \"classical\" Aramaic. For a long time I sought for the relative particle so frequently met in written Aramaic, but I found no trace of it, neith- er as zi nor as d?. The construct relation- ship is generally used where the relative particle might be expected in written Aramaic. Herein, too, is startling agree- ment with the usage in the cuneiform- Aramaic tablet, for Gordon says: \"An- other unmistakable sign of age is the ex- pression of the genitive relationship ac- cording to the old Semitic pattern of con- struct genitive instead of the circumlocu- tion with d(i) that characterizes the lit- erary dialects.\"\"1 Only recently did I dis- cover the relative particle, expressed by a prefixed t, doubtless for d, in the passage MR=i N N=2%A (VIII, 19), doubt- less to be read as \"''mt N~2.. Here, again, is agreement with the cuneiform- Aramaic manner of writing.\" So, with 12 A few examples may be cited here: 486 ,' j (VIII, 16, 18) for the familiar4 the preposition J'C as C31 (VI, 10; for mim?) where the parallel has the expected 131 (min).

In alphabetic Aramaic both d and z are written. Perhaps there had been no shift in pronunciation and the sound was spoken as in Arabic, just as the Hebrews in speech seem to have preserved both Cain and ghain in pronunciation down to Hellenistic times, although the limitations of the alphabet in use compelled the two sounds to be written with the same consonant, Cain.

There are, however, some noteworthy elements not found in the \"classical\" Aramaic. There appears to be consider- able use of the demonstrative pronouns hAdn and hdnd(h), as in Syriac, although the words In (XIII, 14), Ct~ (XIX, 2). and bunbt (XVI, 6), presumably for y, M. , and M7., are also found. Some phenomena suggest the language of the Ugaritic texts. An Daleph standing alone between determinatives (IX, 6) and a similar independently written yodh fol- lowed by Daleph (VI, 10) suggest, respec- tively, the Di and the ya of those texts; while the puzzling form bb2K (XV, 10), which is written in a parallel simply Y; (XVI, 6), may be the mc of the same epics. The papyrus is not without the influ- ence of the demotic manner of writing. The ambiguous use of ,Y for both the preposition \"upon\" and the third-person masculine singular form of the verb bbY, \"enter,\" has always caused difficulty in reading Aramaic. The forms might be ex- pected to be identical in the papyrus, too, as b~Y, except for the fortunate fact that the verb is usually, if not always, accom- panied by the \"walking-legs\" sign, the demotic determinative for motion. Inter- esting, also, is the curious use of the de- motic determinative for divinity append- ed to a simple pronominal suffix attached to the preposition cal (27'N S) when the antecedent is a god (VIII, 7). Our present knowledge of the language of the papyrus is due in a large measure to the cautious scholarship and industry of Dr. Charles F. Nims, who made almost the entire demotic text available for my study. As the conviction grew that the language of the papyrus was Aramaic, it was decided to transcribe and mimeo- graph the entire papyrus for the compila- tion of a concordance that would facilitate its study. This laborious and difficult task was undertaken by Nims, in constant con- sultation with Dr. Hughes. It was Nims who developed our system of numbered letters to indicate the variant ways of representing the recognizable consonants and the numbers now in use to represent the nonalphabetic demotic groups, quite a few of which still remain unidentified. During the course of transcription and the construction of the concordance, Nims discovered that several sections were exactly parallel and some almost parallel, as in the Ugaritic texts. These parallels usually continue for several lines, sometimes within the same column and sometimes in different columns.\"1 A sam- ple of such parallel is presented above. Such material is of great value in reaching an understanding as to the technique of the scribe. Systematic translation of the text began with the recognized parallels in order to learn what degree of variation might be expected in this type of writing. pronunciation, they had the choice of representing the sound by either 1 or T in writing, as is done. Appar- ently local custom determined which of the letters would be written to represent the sound. Since both letters are found in the papyri, the evidence of this papyrus that the letter sounded like d to the Egyptian scribe can be but contributory. More significant is the evidence of the cuneiform-Aramaic text wherein it is also represented by d, for in alphabetic Aramaic from that area the sound is usually represented by T. It is interesting to observe that in the Egyptian papyri the greatest number of occurrences of rather than T for the sound d are found in the copies of the Behistun in- scription and in the Ahiqar story, both of which look eastward for their place of origin. Pertinent, too, are the well-known -idri names, culled from the cunei- form writings. The significance of these facts for the use of the Aramaic \" and T data in arriving at the date of biblical Aramaic is at once apparent. There can scarcely be any question now but that Achaemenid Aramaic, no matter what was written in the alpha- betic script, pronounced the sound d in a fashion that most closely approximated 01. 18 E.g., VI, 7-8 = VI, 10-11; VIII, 10-11 (which concludes with what appears to be a section divider) = VIII, 15-16 (terminated by the same kind of di- vider); IX, 14-17 = X, 13-16; etc. These column numbers may have to be revised after inspection of the original papyrus.

We dis- covered, also, that there are variant ways of writing some of the consonants and that these variant writings are readily inter- changeable. The exact function of the two rish's was discovered by Nims in his work with the parallels. They also have aided us in determining that there is ap- parently no finer distinction between laryngeals in the papyrus than there is otherwise in Aramaic, despite the fact that there are several variant forms for some of the letters. We learned, too, that Daleph is sometimes regarded as a silent letter and may be omitted under such cir- cumstances, as when 2b•:' (VIII, 9) is written instead of 2btRr? (XI, 18) for the name of the god Bethel. In filing the completed concordance, the material between the determinatives dividing the words normally formed the basis, except when it was obvious that more than one word was included. In these instances familiar prefixes and suf- fixes and, occasionally, the distribution of consonants into words of triconsonantal character aided in dividing the words for filing purposes, with cross-references in all doubtful cases. With such a concordance and its accompanying key cards, in which the text ran continuously, I had a mass of material with which I, who knew no de- motic, could work. Although considerable effort has been expended on the text, enough to identify its language and determine the general character of the papyrus, not all of this lengthy manuscript has yet been trans- lated. I present here but a few of the curi- ous and informative phenomena that have been found in the papyrus, for many others are coming to light continually as the work progresses. Since the linguistic de- tails, both demotic and Aramaic, will be published adequately in the future, this introduction must suffice for the present. We can now declare that it is a literary text and not a commercial document like so many of the Aramaic papyri. It is pre- dominantly religious, too, as indicated by one portion which suggests the judgment of the dead, a scene so familiar in the Egyptian religion. This section reads, in part: The Goddess is good. What is done she will know. The balances of Goddess for the wicked(?) woman are in the hands of Goddess (var. \"goddesses\").

The religion reflected is by no means Egyptian alone but a syncretistic type which suggests that the provenience of the religion, if not of the papyrus, was not Egypt but Syria. A wide variety of divine names is encountered. Prominent is the god Bacal Shamain, so familiar from the Aramaic inscriptions, written as p:: 21\"'= (XI, 18), in a variant form as 2?;= 2 ,:t (XVII, 3), and also in the Aramaic translation of the name as \"The Lord of the Heavens,\" 2%i.= *: (VII, 17).

The other consonants and association with Bacal suggest that the word is $apdn, \"North.\" Dr. Hughes has suggested that the combination h and s represent the pronunciation of the sound s. The vocali- zation is supported by the gapdnu of the Amarna Let- ters (J. A. Knudtzon, Die El-Amarna Tafeln [Leipzig, 1907 ff.], No. 147, 1. 10) and is what might be expected in Aramaic. 21 All verbs in this passage agree as to the final con- sonant of the root, but only the feminine forms give all the consonants clearly. However, the probable identi- fications for Nos. 47 and 41 mentioned above (n. 21) indicate that all verbal forms are parallel.

Perhaps it is like one of the books in hieroglyphs or strange cursive writing which Lucius Apuleius mentioned as being in existence in Cenchreae in Greece and in use in the mysteries there. He writes: After the morning sacrifice was over, he [the priest] brought out from the secret places of the inner sanctuary certain books prepared in strange characters; partly expressed by pic- tures of every kind of beast, representing words of speech in shorthand fashion, and partly like a string of knots with the apices of the char- acters twisted and thick, in a winding fashion, in the manner of a wheel; made secure in its reading from the curiosity of the uninitiated.30 If this conjecture proves to have merit and the text is a cult ritual, we might be able to explain why the work came to be written in its unusual fashion--in demotic characters but in the Aramaic language. If it were dictated by an Aramaean or, at least, by one speaking Aramaic, and written down by an Egyptian scribe who made use of demotic groups and deter- minatives in the same way that the Per- sian scribes used Aramaic words in the Pahlavi writing, there would have been great security in the text in ancient times. It would be \"gibberish\" to Egyptians who would attempt to read it in normal fash- ion, just as it has made nonsense to mod- [Footnote 30 on facing page] gether the verbs seem to be masc.

The suffixes and the vowel of the preformative syllable indicate that the verbs are active, although the absence of a vowel between the first two root let- ters in the masculine and in the first feminine forms might suggest passives. The root \"•1I, \"bless,\" is usually rendered in an intensive stem and is probably to be so understood here. The forms are probably masc. iabdr(r)akaka and fem. tabdr(r)akakd. If this be so, there is interesting variation from the classical vocalization. It is noteworthy that the vowel of the preformative syllable is not yet reduced and is a rather than u, just as in the Ugaritic inscriptions (of. Gordon, Ugaritic Grammar [Rome, 1940], p. 59, sec. 8.31). Note, too, that the stem vowel, between r and k, is not i, as in classical Aramaic, but a and is unreduced before the suffix. Furthermore, a more primitive form of the suffix is preserved against the shortened one found in biblical Aramaic. 22 Although the name is incomplete, its association with Bacal at once suggests that his consort is his \"daughter\" PDRY BT ?AR now known from the Ugaritic inscriptions (cf. C. Virolleaud, La Diesse CAnat [Paris, 1938], P1. I, 11. 23 if.; P1. III, 11. 3-5; P1. V, 11. 49-51). 23 A break in the papyrus causes some uncertainty here. By comparison with the other lines, which are parallel, the It seems certain, but there is difficulty in the spelling of the beginning of the name. This word should indicate the sanctuary at ,apdn, just as Sngal is that of Babylon and Aiiaku is Nanai's abode. It may be significant that \"ar appears both in the begin- ning of this word and in the epithet of PDR Y and that a parallel in the Ugaritic material links a place :Arr and ,apdn; e.g., \"and so she goes up into 'arr and into Sapdn\" (cf. Gordon, Ugaritic Grammar, p. 66, sec. 8.48, quoting text 62:I, 10 [ = Bauer A]). Akkadian iru, urru, \"light,\" if cognate to Hebrew 0\")1, would seem to indicate that the Ugaritic \"ar used in the epi- thet of PDR Y cannot be the word \"light,\" for there is apparently no rounding of a to 6 involved in Hebrew \"1~z. Hence the translation \"'daughter of Light\" for the epithet of PDR Y is incorrect. Can the r3: of the epithet introduce a gentilic expression (such as the bath $iii6in, \"Daughter of Zion,\" bath S6r, Daughter of Tyre,\" or possibly even the bHth hallahami, \"the Bethlehemite,\" in Hebrew) and the second element, \"ar(r?).(or a?)h may be a geographical name. It is also possible that the 50 ` (or a ?) may be a second word and that the two together would then designate the sanctuary. For the Ugaritic arr mentioned above, Gordon (ibid., Glossary, No. 107) suggests \"a moun- tain?\" and compares Latin Arra, which he conjec- tures \"may possibly be of the same derivation,\" 24 The -Nr\" before this verbal form causes 4iffi- culty. For the feminine verb one expects simply 1 1 X *6:6 32 or, more fully, N~6~4 '632 32 by comparison with the equivalent masculine verbs. At first I tried to read these as 3Ithpacal forms with an infixed -ta- completely preserved, but this is very un- likely. Such verbs are not so written in the cuneiform- Aramaic text from Uruk (Gordon, \"Incant.,\" p. 115, sec. 68), and the context, the use of suffixes, and the masculine parallels all bespeak a masculine form. The -6t must be a proclitic particle. It is likely that it is the feminine demonstrative pronoun written X; for \"t, tis one, and it is so translated here tentatively. It is significant that the element is found only with the feminine verbs, probably because in the masculine sentences the word order is regular, subject imme- diately after the verb; but in the balanced feminine parallels, where the subject is first, at some distance from its verb which concludes its line after much in- tervening material, the pronoun is helpful in referring to the subject in close association with the verb. 25 Bacal and Bel are here differentiated through spelling.

The peculi- arity of the script might be expected to hinder its being read by Aramaic-speaking folk accustomed to reading the Aramaic alphabet. Even a bilingual person who knew both script and language would have difficulty with the papyrus, for such writing is unusual, and the normal expec- tation is that a text is to be read in the language of its script. It would only be when the key to the manner of writing was known that the text could be translated. If all the values of the demotic characters were known and the text were read aloud, translation would be relatively easy for an Aramaic-speaking individual. We have found the key to the manner of writing and are using such co-operative effort in unlocking its mysteries as was once used to make them secure. We have found that the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago is an excellent place in which to undertake such an enterprise. The papyrus is of great significance. As an example of Aramaic literature of the pre-Christian period, probably from Syria, it is very important. As a religious text, concerned with ritual, it will shed light on the religious thought and practices in the syncretistic milieu of late Achaemenid or early Ptolemaic times. From the stand- tion -I and that the verb was feminine, it was clear that the group indicated the goddess. I am informed that such placement of determinative is acceptable in demotic. 26 I first tried to read this as the divine name Sngl found in the Teima inscriptions (CIS, Vol. II, No. 113, P1. IX, 1. 16), but the word must represent the sanctuary of the goddess at Babylon, which was called Esaggila. An Aramaic notation on a cuneiform tablet shows that the name could be written in Aramaic without the initial element E, \"House,\" for the name m Mar-Esaggil-lumur is written as \"t )OQi' during the reign of Nabonidus (L. Delaporte, Epigraphes Aramnens [Paris, 1912], p. 53, No. 41). Dr. Thorkild Jacobsen has called my attention to the fact that the name could be abbreviated to Saggil or Saggil in Ak- kadian (cf. B. Landsberger, \"Die babylonische Theo- dizee,\" ZA, XLIII [1936], 34, and J. J. Stamm, Die ak- kddische Namrengebung [MVAG, Vol. XLIV (Leipzig, 1939)], p. 85, n. 1). Another Aramaic docket (Dela- porte, op. cit., p. 80, No. 99) clearly presents a nasal- ized form of this word by writing it i In this instance Clermont-Ganneau believed that a slight scribal error had been made and that the reading should be -ord b', \"Of (E)saggila,\" which would present a reading close to that of our papyrus. 27 The name of Borsippa, the home of Nabft, is sometimes written bar-sapki in cuneiform sources (cf. E. Unger, \"Barsippa,\" Reallexikon der Assyriologie [Berlin, 1932], I, 405a). The determinative written in the middle of this name is certainly evidence of false etymology and of transmission by dictation, for it must have been the sound of the familiar and much used Aramaic word bar, \"son,\" in the first syllable that suggested the division. It indicates that the scribe knew something, at least, of Aramaic. 28 N:ni is doubtless the goddess Nanai, whose name is written in cuneiform as fNa-na-a. In an Aramaic magic text (J. Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur [Philadelphia, 1913], No. 36, 1. 3; cf. p. 240) the name is spelled •. Dr. George Cameron has drawn my attention to the fact that sacrifices were made to \"the great god Zeus,\" \"Nanai the great goddess of all the earth,\" and the \"mighty gods Bel and Nabil\" as late as Sassanid times (cf. G. Hoffmann, \"Ausziige aus syrischen Erzaihlungen von persischen Martyrern; M5r Mu'ain,\" Abhandlungen fiur die Kunde des Morgenlandes, Vol. VII, Part 3, p. 29; cf. pp. 130 ff.). 29 In the 1N*• *•2N I first sought an epithet for Nanai, but without success. Some part must be equivalent to the preposition min found in each of the preceding parallel lines. This, too, must be concealed in the first syllable, 7Ht, which is written with an -a vowel, perhaps under the influence of the preceding name Nanai. The words are doubtless a phonetic error and further evidence for dictation. What the scribe heard was apparently manaiiak(k)a, a sandhi form which the scribe, who was inexperienced in Akkadian terminology, resolved incorrectly as manai*iak(k)a for min aiiak(k)a, \"of Aiak(k)u.\" For the doubled i in the name see A. Poebel, Studies in Akkadian Gram- mar (\"Assyriological Studies,\" No. 9 [Chicago, 1939]), p. 128. Aiak(k)u means \"shrine\" or \"temple.\" Dr. Jacobsen informs me that aia(k)ku occurs as an Ak- kadian rendering of the Sumerian temple-name Ean- na(k) (cf. T. J. Meek, \"Some Bilingual Religious Texts,\" AJSL, XXXV [1919] 134 ff., and the pleo- nastic rendering of Eanna(k) as bit aiak in P. Haupt, Akkadische und sumerische Keilschrifttexte [Leipzig, 1881-82], No. 21, p. 127, 11. 29-30). Although Aiak(k)u or Eanna(k) is rightly the temple of Ishtar or Inan- na(k) in Uruk, it is also mentioned by Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal as the abode of Nanai, the spouse of Nabft (cf. A. Deimel, Pantheon Babylonicum [Rome, 1914], No. 2264, II, 7-8). It is interesting to note that Nanai is properly of Uruk and not of Borsippa, where Ezida was the name of the shrine. Nor is she normally the consort of Nabft; but Shalmaneser encountered her at Borsippa with Nabfi (D. D. Luckenbill, Ancient Records of Assyria [Chicago, 1927], I, 231, sec. 624), and, as indicated above, the pair is found together as late as Sassanid times. 30 Lucius Apuleius The Golden Ass xi. 22.

Through its unique attempt at vocalization and its phonetic writing we now have what is, aside from a few proper names preserved in cuneiform, the earliest known vocalized Aramaic text. It preserves for us the language of the Achaemenid age, about a millennium earlier than the vocalization represented by the \"classical\" Aramaic of the Bible. It was some time after I had recognized the system of vocalization in the papyrus and had noted the deviations from \"classi- cal\" Aramaic that I checked my work with the admirable summary of the lan- guage of the cuneiform Aramaic tablet of the Seleucid age at ancient Uruk, as pub- lished by Cyrus Gordon. I was delighted to discover that, in almost every respect wherein these texts deviated from the norm of \"classical\" Aramaic, they moved together and agreed. Missing, of course, were the definitely Babylonian phenom- ena of the cuneiform writing, but there were instead Egyptian peculiarities as evi- dence of local origin. These two texts, from opposite ends of the Fertile Cres- cent, certainly prove that we have pre- served phonetically the Aramaic language of the late Achaemenid period and that the cuneiform text is not a local dialect of Aramaic, as Gordon suggests.31 The extent of the text and the variety of its vocabulary hold forth considerable promise for increasing our knowledge of the Aramaic of the Achaemenid period. Much has been learned from the cunei- form-Aramaic tablet, but its forty-one lines of material are equal to only about two of the many columns of the papyrus. In the grammar, masculine and feminine genders and almost all persons are encoun- tered. The variety of verbal forms found is really remarkable. It is quite probable that rather full morphological tables for late Achaemenid Aramaic will be avail- able when this papyrus is fully under- stood. Much remains to be done. Most of the difficulties now encountered lie in the field of transcription from the demotic to the Aramaic alphabets rather than in the translation of established text. Such diffi- culties can be overcome only through pa- tient work and intensive co-operative study. The demands of Aramaic morphol- ogy, as directed by the context, sometimes furnish valuable clues, but some of the \"unknowns\" may resist yet for a long while. The war, too, by taking a heavy toll of my colleagues who have been work- ing on the demotic aspect of the papyrus, also serves to delay the decipherment. Even when the text is correctly tran- scribed, without any unknowns, there is sometimes still difficulty, for, as experi- ence with the cuneiform-Aramaic tablet has shown, phonetic rendering is often ambiguous. This is particularly true when the alphabet itself is limited and ambigu- ous, as in demotic. Such a combination of difficulties, it must be confessed, does make for at least a temporary uncertainty in some of the translation. Lacking con- text, one is conscious of the fact that the very selection of consonants from among the ambiguous possibilities serves to di- rect the thought and to develop the con- text. I am all too aware of this problem and its dangers for the translation. It is, however, pre-eminently a problem of lexicography. Proper identification of as yet unrecognized demotic groups will serve to check the tendency to lead the translation. I have already had to re- translate some passages, changing their meaning considerably, when difficulties of demotic transcription have been cleared up. Sometimes my suggestions, based on possible Aramaic forms, have been over- 31 \"The Aramaic Incantation ..... \" op. cit., p. 106.

That the translation of what has already been done will be improved is cer- tain. Hence there is hesitation at this time to project even tentative translations. I have been content here merely to intro- duce the papyrus and to outline the pro- cedure in determining that it is in the Aramaic language. The conclusions here presented rest not upon a perfectly trans- lated work but largely upon individual words many of which, however, can be read in intelligible sequence in passages of some length, as demonstrated in the ex- amples above. There is need of caution and conserva- tism in such work as this. Ever before me is the glaring bad example from the past. The first cuneiform Babylonian boundary stone to come to Europe, the Caillou de Michaux, arrived as ballast in a boat in A.D. 1800. Three years later it was trans- lated by the German professor A. A. H. Lichtenstein of Helmstadt, who read it from right to left as Aramaic, declared it to be a dirge addressed by a certain Archi- magus to wailing women at an annual mourning festival, and rendered it in a Latin poem by way of translation.32 I am confident that no such error has been made with this papyrus. My col- leagues among the Egyptologists will not permit such liberties. We have the key. We know the language. When we have completed our task, some years hence per- haps, we shall have recovered from this papyrus an ancient literary text of great- est value religiously, linguistically, and historically.
