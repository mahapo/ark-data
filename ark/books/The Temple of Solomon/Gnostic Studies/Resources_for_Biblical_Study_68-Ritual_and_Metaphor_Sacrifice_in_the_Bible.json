EberhartTh is volume features a selection of presentations delivered at the 2007, 2008, and 2009 Annual Meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature for the “Sacrifi ce, Cult, and Atonement” program unit, a forum for stud ying the practices, interpretations, and reception history of sacrifi ce and cult in ancient Judaism, Christianity, and their larger cultural contexts (ancient Near East and Greco-Roman antiquity). Th is volume lends a voice to scholars representing multiple academic disciplines, diff erent geographical areas, and diverse denominational backgrounds who ex-amine the topic of sacrifi ce in biblical literature. As chair of the “Sacrifi ce, Cult, and Atonement” program unit, I wish to express my deep gratitude to all of these fi ne scholars for sharing their research, insights, results, and questions pertaining to this topic fi rst through presentations and now in writing. Th ey explore issues of terminology and refl ect upon central festivals of the ancient Israelite and Judean religion. Th ey discuss the importance and ambiguity of multivalent rituals and investigate various aspects and problems related to the study of the origin, devel-opment, and reception history of ancient rituals in the matrix of their surrounding religions and cultures. Th ey also scrutinize how sacrifi ce as a key concept of temple worship was both transcended and transformed through the creative processes of spiritualization and metaphorization . With these characteristics, all contributions to the present volume deal directly or indirectly with various forms of worship of ancient Israel and Judah and the written traditions that refl ect upon it. Even tually centralized at the temple in Je-rusalem , this worship consisted mainly of sacrifi cial rituals that encoded the reli-gious, cultural, and so ciopolitical identity of ancient Israel and Judah during dif-ferent histori cal eras. Due to their suggestive potential and authoritative character, these rituals continued to be a dominant terminological and conceptual resource within Judaism and Christianity even aft er the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 c.e. Hence sacrifi cial metaphors have pervaded religious conceptions and secular rhetoric throughout the ages, ranging from foundations for ethics and jus-tice to discourses aiming at glorifying victims of military or natural disasters and to much-debated notions of vicarious atonement . With such a spectrum of phe-nomena, sacrifi ce has caused fascination and puzzlement alike in religious con-stituencies and among scholars, thus assuring continued attention to this topic. xiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xivIntroductionTh e transformation of sacrifi ce communicates not only its acknowl edgment, but also implicit criticism. Despite its authority, the institution of sacrifi ce was questioned already in biblical times, and since then crit ics have wondered about the apparent paradox that rituals which in volve killing and destruction, including the extreme of human sacrifi ce , could be situated at the heart of religion. How can metaphors derived from such a conceptual source inscribe themes like reconcili-ation and salvation into the consciousness of human society? Why did Judaism not readily abandon notions of sacrifi ce when the actual sacrifi cial cult in Jeru-salem could no longer be performed ? Why did nascent Christianity hold on to these concepts as well? Even in modern discourse, sacrifi ce remains not only a controversial but also a powerful topic. Its elucida tion, therefore, is more than an endeavor of historical interest directed at religious phenomena of a distant past; it informs today’s religious, cul tural, and political rhetoric . Th e contributions to the present volume deal with sacrifi cial rituals and meta-phors in the Bible. Th e fi rst set of contributions focuses on as pects and problems related to sacrifi ce in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testa ment. It starts with terminological refl ections and proceeds to studies of sacrifi ce in narrative and prophetic texts. James W. Watts surveys comparative theories of sacrifi ce to show that evalu-ations of particular ritual and nonritual acts as “sacrifi ce s” depend on analogies with stories of sacrifi ce . Such narrative analogies ground the idea of sacrifi ce , which is meaningless without them, and they ac count for the opposite valuations that it can convey. Watts argues, there fore, that sacrifi ce is not a descriptive but an evaluative term; its useful ness for comparative analyses of religious rituals remains questionable. Christian A. Eberhart explores interpretive aspects of sacrifi cial rituals that are manifest in comprehensive technical terms for sacrifi ce . Th eir individual profi le and common implications off er insight into percep tions of early communities which understood sacrifi ces as dynamic processes of approaching God and as to-kens of reverence and reconcilia tion . Eberhart concludes that these comprehensive technical terms ex press the importance of the burning rite as a ritual component that al lows the incorporation of both animal sacrifi ces and sacrifi ces from ve getal substances into modern scholarly theorizing. Jason Tatlock presents a study of human sacrifi ce in the Israelite cult. Approach-ing this topic from its broader context of animal sacrifi ce , he discovers that almost every Hebrew Bible text of child and adult immo lation corresponds to an analo-gous animal rite. Tatlock maintains that human sacrifi ce was an integral part of the Israelite cult during the preexilic era. Göran Eidevall develops new approaches to the study of the role of sacrifi cial terminology in Hebrew Bible prophetic literature. He outlines aspects of one such approach that relies on rhetorical analysis and meta phor theory to bring sacrifi -cial language into a discourse which primar ily deals with some other topic. He illustrates this approach through preliminary analyses of two passages, Isa 66:20 and Ezek 20:40–42, which draw on sacrifi cial metaphors to depict the return of diaspora communities ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvIntroductionTh e second set of essays deals with various aspects and problems related to sac-rifi ce and sacrifi cial metaphors as well as related cult terminology in early Chris-tian literature and its larger cultural context. Jeff rey S. Siker investigates how the earliest Christians grappled with the prob-lem that Jesus, who had suff ered and died at the hands of the Romans , could be proclaimed as a crucifi ed and risen messiah. Surveying a spectrum of christologi-cal concepts in the New Testament that articu late the meaning of that death, Siker explains that some of them eff ec tively blend the notion of atonement of Yom Kip-pur with motifs be long ing to the Passover tradition. Th rough a process of refer-encing vari ous Judean liturgical ceremonies and recalibrating their meaning, Jesus came to be simultaneously understood as a scapegoat and sacrifi cial lamb . Stephen Finlan examines the process of spiritualization of sacrifi ce in the epistles of Paul and in Hebrews by distinguishing six diff erent levels that have commonly been signifi ed with spiritualization . He considers such language as useful for new social formations since it negotiates continuity within change. Finlan notes that Hebrews, while allegorizing sacrifi ce at great length, contains more antisacrifi cial language than any other book in the New Testament. Tim Wardle observes a reticence in the early Christian community to appropri-ate the idea of the priesthood, although other cultic terms were readily adopted. He studies Judean temples that were constructed as alternatives to the Second Temple in Jerusalem and argues that they provide a clue for this phenomenon. During the Second Temple period, other temples and systems of sacrifi ce had developed, yet precedents for alternative priesthoods did not exist. Dominika Kurek-Chomycz investigates the meaning of a convoluted sacrifi cial metaphor used by Paul in 2 Cor 2:14–16. She surveys the histo ry of interpreta-tion of this passage, discusses the terminology and role of cultic scents in connec-tion with wisdom, and considers its relationship to incense and sacrifi ce. Kurek-Chomycz argues that Paul’s olfactory meta phor is best understood in connection to the cluster of motifs associated with the fi gure of personifi ed wisdom. George P. Heyman explores the function of the early Christian dis course of sac-rifi ce, drawing on the Greek and Roman religious and cul tural environment. Th is rhetoric enabled nascent Christian communities not only to explain the shameful death of Jesus on the cross but also to imagine a corporate identity that empow-ered them to resist Roman reli gio-political hegemony. Heyman concludes that the appearance of desert asceticism and of the cult of the martyrs consolidated cultic concepts as a powerful discourse of sacrifi ce. Th e nine contributions to the present volume off er no systematic ex position of sacrifi ce in biblical literature but address selected aspects of scholarly inquiry. May the approaches, perspectives, arguments, in sights, and results featured in the chapters that follow help to better un derstand the worship that epitomized the religion of ancient Israel and Judah and that became the source of ongoing learned refl ections in Rab binic Judaism and of central soteriological concepts in Christi-anity. May these chapters help to better understand rituals and metaphors of sacri-fi ce in the Bible."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Pa rt 1Sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1The Rhetoric of SacrificeJames W. WattsTh e language of sacrifi ce pervades our contemporary rhetoric of politics, religion, and popular culture. References to sacrifi ce and depictions of sacrifi ce can be found in music lyrics, movies, political speeches, and news stories about sports, economics, and biomedical research. It is, of course, ubiquitous in the rhetoric of war. Fascination with the idea of sacrifi ce is also refl ected in the large number of academic theories about its nature and origins. For the past century and a half, scholars of reli gion, sociology, psychology, and anthropology have advanced theo-ries to explain how sacrifi ce works religiously and why its practice and eff ects are so widespread.1 Yet every attempt to describe and explain “sacri fi ce ” always fails to encompass the whole range of ritual and nonri tual behaviors called sacrifi ces. Th e entanglement of theory and ideology in discussions of sacrifi ce has led some to conclude that the word sacrifi ce describes nothing at all but is rather an evaluative term. Th e classicist Marcel Detienne ar gued: Th e notion of sacrifi ce is indeed a category of the thought of yesterday, con ceived of as arbitrarily as totemism—decried earlier by Levi-Strauss—both be cause it gathers into one artifi cial type elements taken from here and there in the sym-bolic fabric of societies and because it reveals the surprising power of annexation that Christianity still subtly exercises on the thought of these historians and soci-ologists who were convinced they were inventing a new science.2 Wilfred Lambert, in describing the religions of ancient Mesopotamia , also avoided the term sacrifi ce because it “is so loaded and ambiguous a term that it is © James W.

In modern usage sacrifi ce is too de pendent on biblical institu-tions and concepts to be a suitable vehicle to express ancient Mesopotamian prac-tices.”3 A survey of theoretical discus sions of sacrifi ce led Ivan Strenski to conclude that “sacrifi ce is what might be better called a syndrome, rather than an objective ‘thing’ with its name written on it.”4 Such skepticism has found a foothold in bib-lical scholarship as well: in his commentary on Leviticus , Erhard Gers tenberger concluded, “Our attempts to delineate the three notions of off ering , community, and atonement as the comprehensive motives represent merely modern rational-izations, and function only in a limited fashion as aids to understanding that can-not completely illuminate the mystery of sacrifi ce .”5 Th ese negative judgments can be generalized to say that sacrifi ce is an evalua-tive term rather than a descriptive one.6 It expresses value judgments about behav-iors rather than describing a distinct form of beha vior. An unusual feature of the term sacrifi ce , however, is that it conveys not just one but rather several contra-dictory evaluations of ac tions. Th e following survey will show that evaluations of particular ri tual and nonritual acts as “sacrifi ces” depend on analogies with stories of sacrifi ce . Such narrative analogies ground the idea of sacrifi ce , which is mean-ingless without them, and they account for the opposite valuations that it can con-vey. Comparative analyses of sacrifi cial rituals have con fused the narrative analogy (“sacrifi ce”) with the rituals to which it is applied. I will defend these claims by categorizing the major theories about sacrifi ce in modern scholarship on the basis of their use of rituals and narratives . Th is catego-rization shows that the ritual /narrative distinction lies at the heart of the theoreti-cal confusion over sacrifi ce . I will then turn to the problem of ritual interpretation as it impinges on the debates over sacrifi ce before concluding with a brief analysis of the principal narrative traditions that have shaped the idea of sacrifi ce in both popular and aca demic culture.3.

Stott; OTL; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1996), 20.6. Th e English term sacrifi ce is itself problematic for cross-cultural comparisons because classical languages (Sanskrit, Hebrew , Greek ) and contemporary non-Western languages do not necessarily contain a term that covers the same range of meanings. Even Latin sac-rifi cium, a compound of sacer (“sacred”) and facem (“to make”), thus “to make sacred, to sanctify , to devote,” leaves us, as Carter noted, “with a rather general, somewhat vague defi -nition we could call ‘religious action,’ which is not really a defi nition at all” (Under standing Religious Sacrifi ce, 3). Th e classical languages do, of course, each contain rich tech nical vo-cabularies describing ritual off erings and their performance, much of which is obscure to modern interpreters."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"5Watts: The Rhetoric of SacrificeTheories of Sacrifice Modern theories of sacrifi ce fall rather obviously into two groups based on whether their explanations emphasize human or animal sacrifi ces . Of course, most theo-rists discuss both, but they inevitably explain one in terms of the other, which is more fundamental for their theories. Th eories based principally on animal off erings have been espoused throughout the last century and a half. W. Robertson Smith, for example, traced the origins of sacrifi ce to a community’s consumption of the totem animal in a festival meal. He considered other kinds of sacrifi ce, includ ing human sacrifi ce , to be corrupted forms of this original communion meal. So for him eating animals lay behind all traditions of sacrifi ce whether they involve animals or not.7 Many other theorists have also emphasized the primacy of animal off erings , though in very diff erent ways from Smith and each other. Th us Edward Tylor’s gift theory of sacrifi ce de-fi ned the off ering of humans as a version of cannibalism, that is, as an alternative food off ering to animal meat.8 Henri Hubert and Mar cel Mauss based their socio-logical theory on the most complete descrip tions of sacrifi cial rituals available to them, the animal off erings of the Vedic (Indian) and biblical (Jewish) traditions. Human off erings , even “the sacrifi ce of the god,” derive from older animal rites .9 Walter Burkert traced sacrifi ce back to the hunting of animals , Jonathan Z. Smith to the domestication of animals, and Marcel Detienne to the cooking of ani mals.10 And Nancy Jay, though focusing on sacrifi ce as a patriarchal rite bent on expel-ling symbols of “femaleness ,” followed Hubert and Mauss in seeing animals as the principal vehicles for such expiation .11 Over the same time period, other theorists have focused fi rst on hu man sacri-fi ce . James G. Frazer collected a wide variety of rituals into a theory of sacrifi cial kingship, in which the ritual sacrifi ce of kings under girds most forms of traditional ritual expression.12 Th ough few have followed Frazer’s theory, many have seen the killing of humans at the heart of sacrifi ce. Sigmund Freud postulated a primordial patricide at the root of human culture and religion: a band of brothers murdered their father because of his sexual monopoly of the women of the community.

Nobody took this tendency further than George Bataille, who described sacrifi ce as the most pro found, if ultimately futile, attempt by which humans try to reestablish intimacy with nature. Human sacrifi ces are, he thought, the most ex treme and revealing form of this attempt.14 But the view that human sacrifi ce is basic to society has circulated more widely in the form devel oped by René Girard, who changed Freud’s thesis into a general theory of violence . When rivalry threatens to destroy a community, Girard ar gued that sacrifi ce diverts the rival’s aggression onto a victim who can not retaliate, thus ending the cycle of vio-lence for the time being. Th ough animal sacrifi ce performs this function, Girard’s more obvious and eff ec tive examples of such violent scapegoating involve human victims and range from witch trials to pogroms to the crucifi xion of Jesus .15 Many recent writers have continued to give priority to human sacri fi ce . Bruce Lincoln interpreted human and animal sacrifi ces as symbolic justifi cations for the violence deemed necessary to maintaining archaic Indo-European society.16 Maurice Bloch argued that “rebounding vi olence ” underlies not just sacrifi ces but almost all religious and political rituals and leads to the symbolic or actual domi-nation of others through violence.17 J. C. Heesterman reconstructed the history of Vedic rituals that transformed life-and-death contests between warriors into ritu-alized expressions of interior self-sacrifi ce .18 And Barbara Ehrenreich, combin ing elements drawn from Burkert and Bloch, suggested that the primor dial experience of being hunted by large predators conditioned humans to accept the deaths of individuals for the sake of the larger community, a conditioning ritualized both in sacrifi ce and in war.19Th is distinction between theories based on animal off erings and those based on human executions not only points to fundamental dis agreements among inter-preters about sacrifi ce . It also highlights the failure of all modern interpretations 13. Sigmund Freud, Totem and Taboo: Resemblances between the Psychic Lives of Savages and Neurotics (trans. A. A.

In fact, one of the curious features of sacrifi cial traditions (at least to mod ern interpreters who oft en remark on it) is their tendency to view hu-mans and animals as, at some level, interchangeable. Th e modern insis tence that one must be historically or symbolically prior to the other does not correspond with this animal -human equivalence in much of the evi dence.Th e disagreement over the logical and/or chronological priority of animal and human sacrifi ces can be explained by making another distinc tion among theories of sacrifi ce , this one involving their sources of information. We have, on the one hand, descriptions of sacrifi cial rituals from ancient texts (such as Leviticus ) and from modern ethnographers; on the other hand, we have stories —myths , legends, and historiographic accounts—in which sacrifi ces play a prominent part. Th ough most theorists invoke both kinds of sources, their theories of sacrifi ce do not ac-count equally well for both: some theories work better for ritual descrip tions than for stories about sacrifi ces , while others are more apt for stories about sacrifi ces than for rituals. Furthermore, this distinction among modern theories of sacrifi ce is congruent with the previous one: theories of sacrifi ce that view animal off erings as primary work best on ritual texts , whereas those that give primacy to killing humans apply best to stories. For example, Girard ’s best evidence for his theory that the sacrifi ce of scape-goats diff uses violent tensions within a community comes from stories of execu-tions , lynchings, and pogroms, including Jesus’ crucifi x ion (which for Girard ex-poses scapegoating to criticism and resistance). Th ese stories are only distantly associated with ritual acts, if at all. Th e application of his theory to temple rituals is strained, and he explicitly disassociates it from the Bible’s description of the role of the original “scapegoat ” (Lev 16 ), which is aft er all not even killed.20 An underly-ing concern with communal violence also motivates the theories of Frazer, Freud, Lincoln, Bloch, Heesterman, and Ehrenreich, who must turn to myth , legend, and drama for stories of ritual human sacrifi ce . Conversely, Burkert’s idea that sacrifi cial rituals refl ect the primor dial hunt and the celebratory meal that follows it applies well to the ri tuals of many cultures, but cannot adequately explain the interchange of animal and human off erings in many of the stories, as he himself has admitted.21 Th e emphasis on rituals over stories is even more pro nounced in the theories of Hubert and Mauss, J. Z. Smith, and Detienne.Th ese congruent dichotomies among theories that set animals versus humans and rituals versus stories do not simply refl ect diff erent evalua tions of the same evidence. Th ey rather point out the fact that sacrifi cial rituals and stories about sacrifi ce really are about diff erent things: the rituals usually involve eating food , oft en animals, while the stories al most always revolve around the killing of hu-20. Girard disassociated his use of the term from that of Leviticus: see Girard, “Genera-tive Scapegoating ,” in Violent Origins (ed. R. G. Hamerton-Kelly; Stanford: Stanford Uni-versity Press, 1987), 73–78.21. On this, see Burkert, “Th e Problem of Ritual Killing,” in Violent Origins (ed. R. G. Hamer ton-Kelly; Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1987), 173."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"8Ritual and Metaphormans. Th ey are diff erent enough that using the same term, sacrifi ce , to describe both is untena ble. Rather, the correlation of stories with rituals under the category of sacrifi ce represents a second-order interpretation that is not intrinsic to the rituals . Such correlations serve to evaluate a ritual on the basis of a story, and do so for purposes of persuasion . Sacrifi ce then is best un derstood as a normative, rather than descriptive, term.Th eories of “sacrifi ce ” thus turn out to be about two diff erent things. Some deal principally with narrative traditions about killing people and are therefore con-cerned with normative evaluations of killing and mur der. Others deal principally with the ritual killing of animals and are therefore concerned with the social func-tions of ritual and religion. Th e two are related only by analogies derived from the normative traditions themselves.Ritual Practice and Ritual Interpretation Why has so much eff ort gone into trying to explain sacrifi ce ? Th eorists have been frustrated by the fact that traditional practitioners off er few explanations for sac-rifi ce . Th at is not for lack of discussions about it in traditional sources. But ritual texts like those in Leviticus , or sermons like those in Deuteronomy , or votive in-scriptions like those found throughout the ancient world are more likely to de-scribe and commend a ritual than to explain it. For example, some of the best-known descriptions of ancient sacri fi ces can be found in the Hebrew Bible. It contains many stories involv ing sacrifi ce , such as Noah’s sacrifi ce of animals aft er being saved from the fl ood (Gen 9 ) and Abraham ’s near-sacrifi ce of his son Isaac (Gen 22 ). But it also contains detailed instructions on how and when to off er animals at Israel’s sanctuary (Lev 1–7 , 16). Yet the stories and even the instructions do not explain why one should off er butchered animals to the deity, except in the most cryptic and ambiguous terms. Th e eff ect of burnt off erings is oft en described as an odor pleasing to God (Gen 8:21 ; Lev 1:9 , 13 , 17 , etc.), which seems to invoke ideas of feed ing the deity, while other texts strenu-ously deny that interpretation (Ps 50:8–14 ; Isa 1:11 ). Th e deity’s claim on fi rstborn humans and animals, the latter substituting for the former, seems to involve dem-onstrations of divine ownership (Exod 13:1 , 12–15 ). But no text systematically elabo rates on the symbolism of a rites’ off erings or other ritual elements. Th at has been left for interpreters , who since ancient times have quarried the possible sym-bolism of these rituals.Th is failure to explain sacrifi ce s is typical of many traditions. Th us animal of-ferings were central rites for ancient Roman society, yet this highly literate culture produced little speculation about their meaning.22 When explanations were off ered for traditional Greek rites they seem to be rationalizations of existing practice, 22. John A. North, “Sacrifi ce and Ritual: Rome ,” in Civilizations of the Ancient Medi-terranean: Greece and Rome (ed. M. Grant and R. Kitzinger; New York: Scribner’s, 1988), 981–86."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"9Watts: The Rhetoric of Sacrificeusually in the face of criticisms, or rationalizations for changing the tradition.23 In every case, the ritual ac tion seems to be demonstrably older than the interpreta-tions off ered for it by the religious traditions in which it is practiced. Th us Mus-lim sacri fi ce s for Eid adapt pre-Muslim Arab rites to symbolize the submission to God that is at the heart of Islam. Th e Christian Eucharist that memoria lizes the sacrifi ce of Christ adapts the Second Temple Jewish Passover sacrifi ce that memo-rialized the exodus from Egypt , which itself was an adaptation of older rites as-sociated with the traditional agricultural cycle of Syria -Palestine. In the process of adaptation, traditional interpreta tions of sacrifi ce tend to emphasize motivations for performing the rite, usually grounded in the imitation of a story—whether of Abraham /Ibrahim and Isaac /Ishmael , or the exodus, or the Last Supper and cruci fi xion —rather than explaining why the ritual takes the particular form that it does. Th e goal of such stories is to motivate worshipers to pre serve past traditions through present practices.On the other hand, some traditions distinguish themselves by their preoc-cupation precisely with the question of ritual meaning. Th e Brahma nas propose elaborate interpretations of Vedic rituals. Th e Tal mud subjects Israel’s off erings to minute investigation and debate. Chris tian theology has oft en been obsessed with understanding Christ’s atone ment and the Eucharist that commemorates it. Th ese traditions for inter preting the meaning of sacrifi ce derive from similar historical settings: they all refl ect on ritual slaughter as a practice of the past no longer en-acted, or which should no longer be enacted, or which should only be enacted in a very diff erent way. Sacrifi ce must then be interpreted be cause of the discontinuity between past and present practice. Th e Indian ritualists prescribed rules to control ancient rites and internalized sacri fi ce as self-sacrifi ce .24 Th e rabbinic tradition de-bated the meaning of off er ings in the aft ermath of the Temple’s destruction that prevented their enactment.25 Christians declared Christ’s death the fi nal sacrifi ce that precludes other sacrifi ces and struggled with how to understand its nonvio-lent ritual reenactment with bread and wine .26 Th e quest to under stand the mean-ing of sacrifi ce arose in each case out of the con sciousness of sacrifi ce as a thing of the past that needs to be replaced with ritual and/or interpretation. Th e same is also true of academic theo ries of sacrifi ce which, like their predecessors in Hindu , Jewish, and Chris tian cultures, oft en seem to be preoccupied with the reasons for sacrifi ce’s disappearance and the conditions for its replacement or even revival.2723. Detienne, “Culinary Practices,” 5.24. See Heesterman, Broken World of Sacrifi ce, 3–5, 53ff .25. See the discussion of Jonathan Z. Smith, “Trading Places,” in Ancient Magic and Ritual Power (ed. M.

In addition to the theorists already mentioned who display this tendency, one should mention Wolfgang Giegerich. He proposed that sacrifi ce should be regarded by Jungian depth psychology as a fundamental archetype. Giegerich argued that the practice of ritual sacrifi ce provided the only “mode in all of known history by which the soul was truly able to access or generate actuality,” an access that has been missing in the last two millennia"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"10Ritual and MetaphorSymbolic interpretations thus seem to multiply around unperformed ri tuals , at least those not performed by the interpreter. Of course, almost everyone both performs and interprets rituals , but oft en not the same ones. We usually do not interpret our own rituals, but only those of others because we need explanations only for activities foreign to us. Our own rituals are “obvious” and as a result re-ceive little if any interpreta tion. Th us Western university professors have spent far more time and eff ort interpreting sacrifi cial rituals and many others that they rarely, if ever, participate in, than they have explaining the graduation rituals of commencement and convocation which their colleges and universities perform at least annually. Sacrifi ce complicates the problem of interpretation , because people use the word sacrifi ce for both ritual and nonritual acts, and for beha viors both native and foreign to modern interpreters. Th at is because sacrifi ce gets applied through a particular kind of interpretation, one always based on stories. Stories of Sacrifice Th e religious motivations behind Hindu , Jewish, and Christian discus sions of sacrifi ce explain readily why they have developed so far beyond the explanations of ancient ritual practitioners. Th ey do not, however, explain their preoccupation with sacrifi ce in the fi rst place. Th at empha sis stems not from the ritual traditions they study, but rather from narra tive roots. Th e need to explain certain paradig-matic stories is what moti vates the concern with sacrifi ce. A fascination with ritual has confused the discussion of sacrifi ce, however, because the two topics are not intrinsically connected, despite what most religious traditions and aca demic theo-rists assume.28Th e meaning of the English word sacrifi ce derives entirely from narrative tra-ditions , and mostly from specifi c narratives reinterpreted continuously over the millennia. Most important to its defi nition have been a small group of stories: the Hebrew Bible’s story (called the Aqedah in Jewish tradition) of Abraham ’s near-sacrifi ce of his son, Isaac , and its variant in the Qur’an ; the Greek tragedies’ depic-tions of ritual and nonri tual sacrifi ce ; and the New Testament’s portrayal of Jesus’ execution by Roman soldiers as a divine sacrifi ce atoning for human sin . (“Killings: Psychology’s Platonism and the Missing Link to Reality,” Spring 54 [1993]: 5–18 [16]; see the critique by James Hillman, “Once More into the Fray: A Response to Wolf-gang Giegerich’s ‘Killings’, ” Spring 56 [1994]: 1–18; and Giegerich’s response, “Once More the Reality/Irreality Issue: A Reply to Hillman’s Reply,” online at http://www.rubedo.psc.br/reply.htm). Giegerich developed his thesis at greater length in Tötungen: Gewalt aus der Seele (Frankfurt: Lang, 1994). 28. Wesley Bergen, to mention only one example, charted the changing meaning of sac-rifi ce from Leviticus to its modern application to acts of war under the heading “the aft erlife of Leviticus 1–7 in the Church” (Reading Ritual: Leviticus in Postmodern Culture [JSOTSup 417; London: T&T Clark, 2005], chap. 6). I suggest instead that such modern uses of the word refl ect the persistent infl uence, not of Leviticus’ ritual instructions, but rather of sto-ries of ritual slaughter , most especially Gen 22 ."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"11Watts: The Rhetoric of SacrificeTh ese stories are all notable for their lack of ritual contents. Jesus’ cruci fi xion was obviously not a sacrifi ce to the soldiers who performed it nor to those who witnessed it, though both fi rst-century Romans and Jews were active participants in blood rituals on other occasions. Only religious refl ection on this political ex-ecution transformed the evaluation of it by labeling it a “sacrifi ce,” in fact the ulti-mate and fi nal sacrifi ce .29 I believe a similar claim can be made about the prominence of sacrifi cial themes in Greek tragedies. Th ey portray human sacrifi ce as extraordinary and perverse when practiced by Greeks (e.g., in Euripides’ Iphigenia in Aulis) and routine only when practiced by barbarians, where it attests to their depravity (as in Euripides’ Iphigenia in Tauris). Th ey cast the motif of sacrifi ce over the theme of murder with which the plays are principally concerned. In these plays, ritual off erings come to represent the reciprocity and equivalence that characterize violence spiraling out of control. But it is the plays that make this identifi cation; there is nothing to sug-gest that Greek temple rituals usually conveyed such ideas to their participants.Th e Aqedah (Gen 22 ; Qur’an 37 ) does depict a ritual , but as in the Greek trag-edies here human sacrifi ce is clearly portrayed as an aberrant act: that is what gives the story its tension. Th e story depicts the rite and its meaning as turning on the interchangeable nature of human and ani mal off erings , precisely the feature of these traditions that modern theo ries have such trouble coping with. But this crucial feature of this narra tive tradition introduces substitutionary ideas into the interpretation of sacrifi cial practice . Th e story’s emphasis on this point shows that such ideas were not necessarily part of the ritual practices themselves; they had to be introduced by an interpretive overlay of stories .30 Such an over lay is even more explicit in the Passover story and ritual instructions (Exod 12–13 ) that transform the old agricultural festival of unleavened bread into a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt and, specifi cally, the escape of Israel’s fi rstborn from death by the substitution ary slaugh ter of lambs. Th e story thus overlays an old ritual meal consisting of animal meat, among other things, with the themes of human sacrifi ce and salvation .Th ese stories have wielded enormous infl uence over Jewish, Chris tian , Muslim, and academic thought about ritual and sacrifi ce . Th e Aqe dah , and especially spec-ulation about Isaac’s voluntary role in it, played a key role in Christian reinterpre-tation of Jesus’ crucifi xion as (self-)sacri fi ce .31 Both stories’ elevation of the ideal 29. Ibid.30. For some of the same reasons, Carol Delaney challenged the notion that “sacrifi ce —whether human or animal , ritual practice or theoretical discourse—is the most appropriate context for the interpretation of the story” (Abraham on Trial: Th e Social Legacy of Biblical Myth [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998], 70; see 70–104).31. See Jon D. Levenson, Th e Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son: Th e Transforma-tion of Child Sacrifi ce in Judaism and Christianity (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993); Delaney, Abraham on Trial, 107–85; Ed Noort and Eibert Tigchelaar, eds., Th e Sacrifi ce of Isaac: Th e Aqedah (Genesis 22) and Its Interpretations (Leiden: Brill, 2002). Th e abiding interest in this story in Jewish and Christian scholarship, not to mention broader religious culture, is attested by the large number of recent books devoted to it. In addition to the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"12Ritual and Metaphorof self-sacrifi ce fueled traditions of martyrs in ancient Judaism and Christianity.32 Th e Qur’an’s version of the story explicitly grounds the practice of Muslim qurban, the ritual slaughter of camels, cattle, sheep, or goats, in symbolic imitation of ’Ibra-him’s submission to God. And controversies over the meaning of the Christian Eucharist , the ritual meal that commemorates Jesus’ sacrifi ce interpreted in light of both Passover and the Aqedah , foreshadow in form and sometimes substance contemporary academic debates over the meaning of sacrifi ce generally.33It is this narrative tradition , rather than ritual practices, that deter mines how and when the word sacrifi ce is applied. Th us ritual slaugh ter may or may not be a “sacrifi ce” depending on how a tradition applies the stories of sacrifi ce . For ex-ample, the regulations governing Jewish kashrut slaughter , limited to religiously licensed professionals and inspected by rabbis, are far more rigorous than the minimal instructions for Muslim qurban, which any man may perform simply by slitting the animals’ throat while invoking the name of ‘Allah. Yet the latter is a sacrifi ce according to Muslim teachings because it imitates the sacrifi ce of ’Ibra-him, while the former is not a sacrifi ce in Jewish tradition. Jewish sacrifi ces that imitate Abraham , Moses, and Aaron cannot be performed outside the long-since destroyed Jerusalem Temple . Imitation of stories of sacrifi ce also permits the ap-plication of the term to rituals in which there is no slaughter (e.g. the Catholic Mass, pilgrimages, ascetic discip lines for spiritual attainment), to slaughter that involves no religious ritual (e.g., the deaths of martyrs and soldiers, laboratory ani-mals killed in medical experiments), and to a vast array of behaviors that involve neither ritual nor slaughter (e.g., gift s to religious organizations, labor on others’ behalf, any kind of self-denial for the sake of a common good, etc.). What unites all of them is the claim, either by an interpreter or by the actors themselves, that the action imitates a story of heroic sacrifi ce. Sometimes the story is quite explicit, such as when Christian martyrs or ascetics claim to imitate Christ. At other times, the narrative connection is implicit in substitutionary themes derived from religious three above, see Louis A. Berman, Akedah : Th e Binding of Isaac (Boulder, CO: Rowman & Littlefi eld, 1997); Mishael Maswari Caspi, Take Now Th y Son: Th e Motif of the Aqedah (Bind-ing) in Literature (North Richland Hills, TX: Bibal Press, 2001); Jerome I.

For example, the theories of Tylor, Hubert and Mauss, Jay and Ehrenreich clearly emphas ize the propitiatory function of sacrifi ce in making conditions more favorable, like the “ransom” theory of the atonement . Th e theories of Freud, Burkert, Girard, Lincoln, Bloch, and Heesterman point to its expiatory role in ridding the individual and society of the eff ects of violence , similar to the “satisfaction” theory of the atonement . Girard’s notion that the New Testament Gospels’ account of Jesus’ death serves to expose and counter sac-rifi cial violence clearly reproduces, in an appealing sociological form, the “moral infl u ence” theory of the atonement ."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"13Watts: The Rhetoric of Sacrificetradition, such as the claim that “they died so that others may live” to validate the deaths of soldiers or laboratory animals .34 But the theme of substitutio nary sacri-fi ce is enough to ground the moral evaluation in ancient narra tive traditions.Sacrifi ce is not, however, an unequivocally positive term. It can con vey strong condemnation rather than praise. Such negative usage appears frequently in polit-ical rhetoric , such as the charge that someone is sacrifi cing people or principles for personal gain. Religious rituals may also be condemned as “sacrifi ces”: in Florida, local laws banning ritual animal sacrifi ce and their enforcement against Sante-ria priests generated a long legal struggle that illustrates a profound animosity to such rituals in modern American culture.35 To some degree, such aversion refl ects the fact that powerful stories about sacrifi ce in Western culture involve, fi rst, the limitation of legitimate sacrifi ce to scripturally ordained rites and, second, the end of all such sacrifi ces , either in the destruction of Ju daism’s ancient Temple or in Christian emphasis on the fi nality of Christ’s sacrifi ce . Th ese stories therefore ren-der all contemporary ritual slaughter unnecessary and even idolatrous. Sacrifi ce has long been a site of interreligious confl ict. Greco-Roman rulers persecuted Jews and Christians by forcing their participation in pagan rites. Th is history and the belief in the fi nality of Christ’s sacrifi ce prompted concerted eff orts by later Christian rulers to suppress ritual animal slaughter in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Such expe riences have given the idea of animal sacrifi ce conno-tations that evoke horrifi ed antipathy in Western culture.Th is horror also grows out of a deeper narrative root: stories of hu man sacrifi ce have terrifi ed and fascinated cultures from the ancient Greeks and Israelites to contemporary Europeans and Americans. Th e Bible, besides emphasizing the sub-stitutionary theme in the Aqedah , Pass over, and crucifi xion stories, polemicizes against the ritual slaughter of children (Lev 18:21 ; 20:3–5 ; Deut 18:10 ; Isa 66:3 ) while also preserving ambiguous stories of its practice by the patriarch Abraham (Gen 22 ), the Israelite judge Jephthah (Judg 11:29–40 ), and the Moabite king Mesha (2 Kgs 3:27 ). Th e same tension appears in Greek religious traditions (con trast the tragedians’ nuanced treatment of violence with the Athenians maintenance of the human pharmakos, to be exiled or executed in times of crisis) and Roman his-toriography (contrast for example Livy ’s admiring account of the Roman consul 34. Robert N. Bellah noted that Abraham Lincoln introduced non-sectarian Christian symbol ism into American political discourse when he commemorated dead soldiers in the Gettysburg Address with the words “those who here gave their lives, that the nation might live.” He then demonstrated the ways in which memorials to the “sacrifi ces” of war dead have evolved into central shrines and rituals of the American civil religion (“Civil Religion in America,” in Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in a Post-traditional World [New York: Har per & Row, 1970], 168–89; see also Carolyn Marvin and David Ingle, Blood Sacrifi ce and the Nation: Totem Rituals and the American Flag [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999], 69). 35.

Th ere is far less archeological and textual evidence for it than the narrative traditions would have us believe.37 Yet there is enough to show that the phenome non was not entirely imaginary. Th e strongest archeological evidence comes from the Punic tophets, graveyards of Carthage that contain votive inscriptions with burials of children , oft en a two- and four-year-old together in the same grave. Votive off erings of animals also appear in the same graveyard, showing that the substitution theme did work its way into ritual practice in the Phoenician /Punic tradition.38 Later textual evidence for the ritual slaughter of humans includes the orders of Pope Gregory III to the Archbishop of Mainz (in 731 c.e.) that Christians not be allowed to sell slaves to non-Christians for use as sacrifi ces.39 Of course, this case is mediated through Gregory’s Christian defi ni-tion of sacri fi ce , but pre sumably ritual slaughter is what the German buyers had in mind. Yet we do well not to assume too much: anti-Jewish and anti-Christian polemic in antiquity already featured the “blood libel”, the completely un founded charge that Jews and Christians mixed the blood of slaughtered prisoners or babies into the unleavened bread s eaten at Passover and in the Eucharist .40 Th us human sacrifi ce loomed much larger in ancient imagination , especially when it involved distant ances tors or contempo rary enemies, than it did in any ancient ritual prac-tice that we can clearly document. And when the rituals did involve human vic-tims , narrative’s priority over ritual is clearly expressed in the imitatio Dei theme (hence imitatio narratio) at work in ancient child sacrifi ce . Par ents sacrifi ced their children in imitation of myths of divine sacrifi ces of deities.41 Th e same motivation still plays a part in religiously motivated killings of both children and adults.42 36.

For example, the blood libel resurfaced as a perva sive expression of anti-Semitism in modern Europe from the fourteenth through the twentieth cen-turies. Th e accusation of human sacrifi ce be comes even more powerful when it can claim some justifi cation in fact. In the sixteenth century, the Aztec ’s ritual slaughter of prisoners horri fi ed the invading army of Cortez, though these men were quite accustomed to slaughtering people themselves. It was their recognition of the Aztec ritual as not just an execution , but a “sacrifi ce ,” that fi rst horrifi ed the Spaniards and then became their justifi cation for conquer ing and converting the peoples of Central and South America.43 Nor did the eigh teenth-century Enlight-enment put an end to such thinking. Sacrifi cial rhetoric , both positive and nega-tive, played a powerful role in nine teenth-century French politics and contributed to the war fever in most Euro pean countries before World War I.44Yet beyond such polemics, the theme of human sacrifi ce has re mained an abid-ing source of refl ection in literature, art, and political culture: for example, con-sider the human sacrifi ce that begins the spiral of violence in Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus, the frequent paintings of Jephthah’s sacrifi ce of his daughter by Re-naissance and Baroque artists, and the preoccupation with sacrifi ce in nineteenth-century academic research and American novels of the same period.45 Th e rhetoric of sacrifi ce alternates between praise and blame, admira tion and horror because its underlying narratives explore the ambiguous boundaries be-tween the legitimate and illegitimate killing of human beings . Th at is its natural subject. Its application to animal slaugh ter depends on making some equivalence with human stories, either positively through a substitution ary theme—usually animal in place of human, but also human/god in place of all animals and hu-mans—or negatively by implicating animal slaughter in stories of human martyr-dom , for example, the hero chose martyrdom rather than sacrifi c ing animals to idols. Th eories of sacrifi ce that try to treat it as descriptive of rituals will always founder on the normative and narrative nature of their subject.trial chro nicled in detail by Delaney, Abraham on Trial, 35–68), and of the Jew Richard Rosenthal, who, aft er murdering his wife in 1995 in Massachusetts, impaled her organs on stakes in an altar -like pattern (see Susan L. Mizruchi, “Th e Place of Ritual in Our Time,” American Literary History 12, no. 3 [2000]: 474–76). Perhaps the case of the evangelical Andrea Yates, who drowned her fi ve children in Texas in 2001 on the orders, she stated, of the devil, should also be counted as a “sacrifi ce .” Th e cases are united, however, only by the religious ele ment of claims of supernatural prompting. But this, like the broader cultural notions of sacrifi ce generally, is established in people’s minds by narrative examples.43.

Calling some act a “sacrifi ce” is to claim that the act is comparable to some paradigmatic action in a hero’s, or villain’s, story . It is the rhetoric of ser-mons and didactic texts that connects the term sacrifi ce to specifi c rituals. In these contexts, it is clearly an evalu ative label, not a descriptive one, which undermines its descriptive use in academic theories. It is, therefore, inappropriate to describe the off erings of Leviticus as “sacrifi ces ” unless one intends to make a normative claim by doing so.It might seem odd to argue that a word does not mean what every one thinks it means. Aft er all, does not usage determine meaning ? Yes it does, but words can carry connotations that native speakers do not think about explicitly, despite the fact that they may use those connotations regularly and expertly. My point is that, by missing or ignoring the nor mative connotations of sacrifi ce that derive from narrative analogies, scholars of religion have confused rituals of eating with con-troversies over killing humans. Only by separating the two can they be clearly analyzed for what they are, and only then can we begin to understand how they came to be related in normative applications of the word sacrifi ce to ritual prac-tices involving food ."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"2Sacrifice? Holy Smokes!Reflections on Cult Terminology for Understanding Sacrifice in the Hebrew BibleChristian A. EberhartCultic sacrifi ces are mentioned and described throughout the Hebrew Bible, they are central to the worship of ancient Israel and Judah, and they are a true treasury for metaphorical language. Yet their interpreta tion is the subject of much debate among modern scholars. In this essay I intend to make a contribution to this de-bate by studying “native” inter pretations of cultic sacrifi ces as they are manifest in comprehensive tech nical terms employed in the priestly texts of both the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint. I will thus focus on Hebrew words such as קרבן, מנחה, זבח, שהׁא, and ניחוח ריח, and on the Greek word θυσία. In these refl ections, I will describe specifi c meanings of these technical terms while being attentive to their common implications. I argue that the modern endea vor of interpreting sacrifi -cial rituals or of developing theories of sacrifi ce can benefi t from paying attention to aspects of such “native” interpreta tion of sacrifi cial rituals . In particular, these early interpretative layers broaden the modern perceptions of sacrifi ce through their focus on the burning rite. Ritual sacrifi ces then emerge, for example, as dy-namic processes of approaching the altar or as tokens of reverence to God. Th ese refl ections are corroborated by the usage of such cultic termi nol ogy in the Dead Sea Scrolls and rabbinic literature, as well as by its me taphorical usage in the He-brew Bible and the New Testament. 1. Introduction: Terminology and Ambivalence What is a sacrifi ce ? Th is term refers to universal phenomena in human cultures throughout history. When the term sacrifi ce references reli gious rituals, it is recog-nized by scholars in anthropology, history, and religion alike as a crucial factor that helps to decode basic principles of interaction and exchange within these cultures. 17In honor of Rudolf Leopold Eberhart, on the occasion of his eightieth birthday."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"18Ritual and MetaphorOf course, it helps in particular to comprehend the religious dimension of these cultures. At the heart of Second Temple Judaism, for example, a well-developed cult featured sacrifi cial rituals which conveyed ancient Judean core beliefs about God. Th rough its suggestive potential, this cult became a termi nological and con-ceptual resource for diverse Judean groups to frame practical mandates for com-moners. Th e fact that the sacrifi cial cult was drawn on for these purposes suggests that it was not only a well-known, but also a widely accepted and authoritative institution. Th us metaphors derived from the sacrifi cial cult gradually permeated the religious and secular rhetoric of Judaism and, later, also of Christianity. Yet while modern scholars generally acknowledge that ritual sacri fi ce is im-portant for the decoding of human culture and religion, they also face the situa-tion that this concept has eluded attempts of arriving at an interpretive agreement regarding its purpose and nature. Sacrifi ce was indeed defi ned in a variety of dif-ferent ways, for example as the setting for totemistic meals that were understood to sustain communal life in the ancient Semitic world,1 as a process of identifi ca-tion of the off erer with the sacrifi cial animal that leads to consecration or to an approach of the divine,2 or as a scenario that allows a society to domesticate or redirect the violence that naturally develops among humans and thus provides positive group-dynamic eff ects,3 to name but a few hypotheses. Th e multitude of diff erent theories on the symbolism and meaning of sacrifi ce appears to some as proliferation.4 In her recent essay “Mise à mort rituelle,” Catherine Bouanich con-cisely states that there are as many defi nitions of the term sacrifi ce as there are spe-cialists of ancient religions: “Autant d’auteurs spécialistes des religions anciennes, autant de défi nitions du mot ‘sacrifi ce.’ ”5 In a critical response, therefore, some 1.

Th e variety of theories of sacrifi ce, however, should not be considered as entirely incompatible. Divergences can in part be attributed to diff er-ent approaches and objectives of inquiry. Some theories, for example, approach sacrifi ce in the Hebrew Bible in relation to comparative data from surrounding cultures. Phenomena in one culture are then a priori not studied exclusively on their own terms, but are used to illuminate similar phe nomena in the other culture. Some theories, on the other hand, focus on diff erent aspects of ritual activities that are mentioned or described in the Hebrew"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"19Eberhart: Sacrifice? Holy Smokes!scholars have more recently affi rmed the multivalence of ritual sacrifi ces and re-jected the fundamental assumption that sacrifi ce must necessarily be understood symbolically . Based on anthropology, ritual studies, and other disciplines, these scholars pay specifi c attention to the immediate meaning of ritual activity and its socio-cultural implications.6 Th is brief survey of the scholarly interpretation of sacrifi ce clearly shows that it is not easy to answer the question of what is a sacrifi ce . Th e variety of interpreta-tions outlined above is in part due to the fact that terms that are commonly used may change their meaning over time. Eventually they refer to an entire spectrum of phenomena; their original meaning then becomes diffi cult to determine or to defi ne. Th e term in ferno is such an example. It is widely regarded as a classical term for hell and a modern term for a large uncontrolled fi re (see, e.g., the 1974 disaster movie Towering Inferno). Yet it is interesting to note that the term inferno is actually derived from the Latin adjective infernus mean ing “below” or “under.” In ancient three-story worldviews, this term came to be used as a standard desig-nation of hell, located “under” the earth. And only due to the idea that an eternal fi re of punishment burns there did the term inferno gradually assume its modern meaning. It is apparent, however, that such an understanding of the term consti-tutes a considerable change of meaning when compared to the original adjective infernus.Aft er these refl ections I would like to return to the term sacrifi ce , another term of Latin origins. What do we mean in everyday speech when we use this term? And why is there such a variety of diff erent interpretations among scholars re-garding its meaning? Apart from the possibility that it might also have undergone some change in meaning, another reason for this diversity of opinions is the fact that the Hebrew Bible does not feature any explicit theories of sacrifi ce .7 Occa-sional ratio nales such as the statement that animal blood , life, and atonement are Bible. For instance, some scholars venture into conjecturing previous developments of such rituals, others are prin cipally concerned with symbolic meanings, while again others prefer to study latent layers of meaning that are accessible below the surface of explicit interpreta-tions in the Hebrew Bible. Th erefore, the variety of theories of sacrifi ce can to some extent be understood as a corollary of multiple perspectives on the subject matter.6. Cf. I. Gruenwald, Rituals and Ritual Th eory in Ancient Israel (Brill Reference Library of Judaism 10; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2003); W. K. Gilders, Blood Ritual in the Hebrew Bible: Meaning and Power (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004); M. Modéus, Sacrifi ce and Symbol : Biblical Šĕlāmîm in a Ritual Perspective (ConBOT 52; Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell International, 2005). 7. Cf. A. Marx, “Th e Th eology of the Sacrifi ce according to Leviticus 1–7,” in Th e Book of Leviticus: Composition and Reception (ed. R. A. Kugler and R. Rendtorff ; VTSup 93; Leiden: Brill, 2003), 103–20 [103]; J. W. Watts, Ritual and Rhetoric in Leviticus: From Sacrifi ce to Scripture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 30, 180–81. According to Watts, the reluctance of explaining sacrifi ce is also characteristic of other cultures and religions: “. . . animal off erings were central rites for ancient Roman society, yet this highly literate culture produced little speculation about their meaning. When explanations were off ered for traditional Greek rites they seem to be rationalizations of existing practice, usually in the face of criticisms, or rationalizations for changing the tradition” (ibid., 181)."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"20Ritual and Metaphorconnected (Lev 17:11) remain an exception. Yet this does not mean that traces of interpretation do not exist at all or that the communities and original tradents of the texts did not have any opinion on sacrifi ce. Every process of human speech or writing is ultimately an act of interpretation through the selection of elements that are deemed worthy of being men tioned and through the choice of appropri-ate terminology. At this point, it should be noted that the term sacrifi ce designates multiple referents. First, it describes an actual ritual, customarily carried out at a sanctuary and/or on an altar , in the course of which special material is being “sacri-fi ced.” Second, the term sacrifi ce designates this very material, typically under-stood today as an animal victim that is being sacrifi ced. Due to this terminological ambivalence we could say that a sacrifi ce (namely the victim ) is off ered during sacrifi ce (namely during a sacrifi cial ritual ).8 However, attributing the term sacri-fi ce to a certain sequence of ritual activity and the material off ered there is in itself an act of interpretation . Within the Hebrew Bible, this is best illustrated through the Passover ritual. Th e earliest Passover regulations describe an archaic ritual that is conducted at the homes of the Israelites and not at any sanctuary; the Passover lamb is, furthermore, roasted and then eaten in its entirety by the family so that no piece of it is actually off ered to God on any altar ; fi nally, its blood is used for apotropaic purposes (Exod 12:1–13).9 It might be due to these features that the priestly texts do not include the Passover ritual in their catalog of cultic sacrifi ces featured in Lev 1–7. A later redactor nevertheless labels this ritual “Passover sac-rifi ce (זבח־פסח) for yhwh” (Exod 12:27; see also Num 9:7, 13). Th is observation hints at the fact that, already at the time of ancient Israel and Judah, there was some debate regarding the question of which ritual could be considered a sacrifi ce, and perhaps also regarding the corollary of how to defi ne a sacrifi ce . Th ese two meanings of the term sacrifi ce refer to sacrifi cial rituals . Apart from them, the term sacrifi ce is used for an even broader spec trum of phenomena. It is important to mention that, third, this term oc curs already in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament in a metaphori cal sense . Key expressions from the sacri-fi cial cult were especially transferred into other areas of worship. Th is is mani-fest in the following phrase about an appropriate pious attitude: “Th e sacrifi ces of God (אלהים זבחי) are a broken spirit” (Ps 51:17 [51:19 mt ]; see also Ps 119:108; Heb 13:16). Fourth, the term can also be applied metaphorically within the secu lar realm. Th us Paul expressed his gratitude for material support which he received on behalf of the congregation in Philippi with the words: “I have received everything 8. For the purposes of this essay, the distinction between sacrifi cial ritual and sacrifi cial material may suffi ce. A further distinction is that between ritual and text, that is, between the very action of performing a sacrifi cial ritual according to the parameters of a particular socio-religious tradition and, on the other hand, the production of oral and literary state-ments for the purpose of regulating or refl ecting on such rituals (cf. Watts, Ritual, 27–32). Since this essay deals with sacrifi cial rituals as they are mentioned or described in the He-brew Bible, it is not concerned with the past reality of their actual performance. 9. Th e chapter of Exod 12 is probably composed of three sources. Th e oldest layer com-monly attributed to Y/E consists of vv. 21–23 and 27b; the layer attributed to P consists of vv. 1–20 and 43–47; a layer of Deuteronomic redaction is contained in vv. 24–27a."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"21Eberhart: Sacrifice? Holy Smokes!and more; I have abundantly, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, a pleasing odor (ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας), an acceptable sacrifi ce (θυσίαν δεκτήν), pleasant to God” (Phil 4:18). Today a somewhat comparable usage occurs when the term sacrifi ce desig nates something that is given or deployed for a particular cause or for the sake of a greater good. Th us parents “make sacrifi ces” when they put aside fi nancial resources for the future college education of their child ren . Here the term has an impersonal referent as it refers to money while such action is supposed to benefi t persons. Fift h and fi nally, the term sacrifi ce is used today to directly designate a personal referent, namely somebody who (voluntarily) gives him- or herself for a particular cause or for the sake of a greater good. Th is usage has become increasingly common in modern patriotic discourse.10 In this case, sacrifi ce desig nates a personal referent, in particular people who agree to pursue dan gerous missions, while it is an abstract or larger entity such as a nation or “the free world” (however that may be defi ned) that is thought to benefi t from such action. Th ese three examples of metaphorical usage share a common aspect. Sacrifi cial language serves the purpose of assigning importance to ges tures or actions along widely accepted categories of a religious value system. Whether in religious contexts or not, this terminology is impli citly recognized as rhetorically authoritative. Hence the term sacrifi ce can be used for a number of diff erent phe nomena: it denotes sacrifi cial rituals as such and the materials (“victims” ) to be off ered; it can also designate acts of worship not directly associated with such sacrifi cial rituals , and in everyday speech it can designate things that are given, or persons who are deployed, for the sake of a greater good.11 With such a large spectrum of meanings, the term sacri fi ce is a polyvalent category. On the one hand it refers to actual sacrifi -cial rituals ; on the other hand, it is used as a metaphor . Th e usage of this term in antiquity usually occurs in religious contexts while the modern metaphorical usage does not; it has been secularized.12 For the sake of terminological precision, I shall therefore distinguish between cultic or ritual sacrifi ce and sacrifi cial meta-phors in this essay. It should be noted that the usage of the term sacrifi ce in ancient reli gious con-texts and in the Bible can have joyous and festive connotations; in contrast, the modern secularized usage has predominantly negative connotations as it associ-ates loss and misfortune. Th is corresponds to the observation that biblical texts 10. Cf. K. McClymond, Beyond Sacred Violence: A Comparative Study of Sacrifi ce (Balti-more: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), 160–63. McClymond notes how, in the events of September 11, 2001, and the pursuant responses, sacrifi cial language was employed by Al Qaeda terrorists and the U.S. political administration to validate the loss of lives. 11. Similar categories for the distinction of the term sacrifi ce are proposed in W. Stege-mann, “Zur Metaphorik des Opfers,” in Opfer: Th eologische und kulturelle Kontexte (ed. B. Janowski and M. Welker; STW 1454; Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 2000), 191–216 [191–95]. 12. Cf. Stegemann, “Metaphorik,” 195; C.

It is nevertheless a concern that many modern theories of cultic sacrifi ce in antiquity are infl uenced by modern secular ized concepts of sacrifi ce with rather negative connotations. In theologi cal, anthropological, and historical scholarship, therefore, ritual sacrifi ce is oft en as-sociated with violence or death.13 Such opinions are also ma nifest where sacrifi ce is depicted as being inseparably connected to blood rituals .14 Th is has led to com-mon assumptions that the temple as the very center of Israelite/Judean worship was an institution bent on the annihilation of life. Th e legitimacy of such scholarly views has recently been questioned by, for example, K. McClymond, who observes a ten dency to “exaggerate the importance of killing .”15 2. Sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible/SeptuagintTh e present contribution to the ongoing scholarly discussion on the na ture of cultic sacrifi ces attempts to orient itself along traces of “native” or original inter-pretations. It is interested in the question: How did the an cient Israelite/Judean communities that produced and passed on the texts of the Hebrew Bible as well as the diaspora groups that translated them into Greek understand sacrifi cial rituals ? As stated above, explicit theories of sacrifi ce are featured nowhere in the Hebrew Bible; yet the choice of mentioning certain ritual activity in various texts on sac-rifi cial rituals and the choice of terminology can be understood as rudimentary traces of such native interpretation. Hence I shall investigate aspects of meaning of key terms that are frequently used for cultic sacrifi ces in the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint. Th rough this combination of several elements of original interpreta tion in the texts on cultic sacrifi ces, I aim at avoiding problems that might occur if terminol-ogy is considered without further attention to its semantic context. In this regard, the classic caveat of James Barr still needs to be taken seriously that sometimes generalizations are made on fairly narrow evidence, particularly when broad argu-ments are based on the modern interpretation of individual words or their etymol-ogy. Barr therefore advises to support such arguments by consulting the context in each case.16 My approach to determining meaning, therefore, shall be guided by the consideration of the sense of individual words within their larger discourse 13. Cf. Hubert/Mauss, “Essai,” 67, 71–75; Burkert, Homo Necans, 5, 12–48. 14. Cf. G. W. Ashby, “Th e Bloody Bridegroom: Th e Interpretation of Exodus 4:24–26,” ExpT 106 (January 1995): 203–5 [204]. 15.

In its own historical context, some of Barr’s argument was specifi cally di-rected against what he called “the root fallacy” (ibid., 100–106) in lexicographical stud-ies and the exegesis of Hebrew Bible texts. A similar position is that of Moisés Silva who emphasizes that “lin guists . . . would assign a determinative function to context; that is, the context does not merely help us understand meaning—it virtually makes meaning” (Biblical"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"23Eberhart: Sacrifice? Holy Smokes!units. Th is approach thus rests on the assumption that the process of choosing or coining technical terms was part of a con scious procedure in the development of a larger cultic system.17 Th e most detailed information on ritual sacrifi ces in the Hebrew Bi ble is fea-tured in the priestly texts of Lev 1–7.18 Th ese texts distinguish among fi ve diff erent types of sacrifi ce , namely the burnt off ering , the cereal off ering , the sacrifi ce of well-being, the sin off ering , and the guilt off ering . Even though the rituals and individual instructions for all of these types of sacrifi ce are diff erent, the priestly texts employ one compre hensive term for all of them: קרבן (Lev 1:2, 3, 10, 14; 2:1, 4, 7, 12; 3:1; 4:23, 28, 32; 5:11; 7:38; etc.; see also 17:4; Num 15:4).19 Th is term is a nominal derivative from the root קרב—“to draw near, to bring near.” Its lit-eral meaning, therefore, is “that which is brought near.”20 Th e standard English translation of קרבן—“off ering ”21—is perhaps based on its lxx rendering δῶρον—“o ff ering , present .” Such a קרבן is always a ליהוה קרבן—an “off ering for yhwh.” It captures the dynamic movement of sacrifi cial material toward the sanctuary and ultimately toward God who, according to the priestly concepts, resides there. Th ese ritual dynam ics are also conveyed through multiple occurrences of the verb קרב hiphil—“to bring near” (Lev 1:2, 3, 5, 10; 2:2, 4; 3:1; 4:3, 14; 5:8; 7:9)—along-side the nominal derivative קרבן, accompanied by equivalents such as בוא hiphil (Lev 2:2, 8; 4:23, 28; 5:6, 11) and שׁנג hiphil (Lev 2:8), which both mean “to bring near.”22 Th ese observations show that nouns and verbs conveying the ap proach of the sanctuary permeate the regulations on sacrifi ce in Lev 1–7. Such an approach was Words and Th eir Meaning: An Introduction to Lexical Semantics [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1983], 139; italics original).17. In this regard, see the words of Ithamar Gruenwald: “. . . the cultic environment of the sanctuary leaves nothing to chance or to non-systematic performance. Indeed, it acti-vates a more sophisticated systematization of rituals, in which clearly specifi ed names and func tions play a major role . . .” (Rituals and Ritual Th eory in Ancient Israel [Brill Reference Library of Judaism 10; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2003], 208). 18. Alfred Marx considers the section of Lev 1–7 as an independent unit, which he calls “the Holy of Holies in the book of Leviticus” due to its “prominent position” (Th eology, 106). 19.

With re-gard to earlier observations on modern theorizing, it may be mentioned that such terminological choices of the priestly communities and the ancient tradents of the He brew Bible texts do not convey any negative connotations. Instead, fur ther Hebrew Bible texts indicate that specifi cally the burnt off ering , the cereal off ering , and the sacrifi ce of well-being are oft en associated with a cheerful, merry, and celebratory atmosphere (1 Sam 1:13–14; 2 Chr 29:20–36). Furthermore, these terminological choices do not point to the act of slaugh-ter at all. In animal sacrifi ce , slaughter occurs toward the begin ning of the ritual; the ritual, however, continues aft er this activity, lead ing toward the act of burning all or a portion of the sacrifi cial material on the so-called altar of burnt off ering (Lev 1:9, 13; 2:2, 11; 3:5, 11; 4:10, 31). Th e connection between the latter and the designation of sacrifi ces as ליהוה קרבן—“off ering for yhwh”—is manifest in the interpretive com ment that the priestly community usually attached to the burning rite, namely ליהוה ניחוח ריח—“a pleasing odor for yhwh” (Lev 1:9, 13, 17; 2:2; 3:5, 11, 16; 4:31). Th e ritual dynamics of the cultic sacrifi ce thus conclude when the sacrifi cial material is being transformed by the altar fi re and its odor is perceived by God. Finally, this terminology which conveys the dynamics of cultic sacri fi ces oc-curs also in the context of the ritual of the cereal off ering (Lev 2). As this type of sacrifi ce consists of vegetal substances which are accompa nied by oil, frankincense (v. 1), and salt (v. 13), it is clear that its ritual does not feature any act of slaughter . Th e movement indicated in Lev 2 by the noun קרבן and the verbs קרב hiphil, בוא hiphil, and שׁנג hiphil also concludes with the burning rite which is further accen-tuated because all of the frankincense is to be added. Beyond the Hebrew Bible, the term קרבן occurs frequently in later litera ture such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and rabbinic texts. In the latter, קרבן also designates referents that are not sacrifi cial rituals , for instance the wood off ering (m. Taan. 4:5) or the hair of the Nazir (m. Naz. 2:5–6) . Th e cereal off ering leads us to consider the word מנחה, a second term for cultic sacrifi ce in the Hebrew Bible. Th is term occurs in the priestly texts as the very designation of the cereal off ering (also called “grain off ering ” or “meal off ering”) that is to be prepared from raw or unprepared grains of cereal that are to be baked or toasted or fried.23 It occurs 213 times in the Hebrew Bible of which 150 refer to this specifi c type of sacrifi ce . In another thirty instances, however, מנחה has a broader meaning.24 It refers, for example, to both Cain’s sacrifi ce from “the fruits of 23. Cf.

In yet another context, the term מנחה refers exclusively to animal sacrifi ces that are off ered at the sanctuary of Shiloh (1 Sam 2:17; see also Num 16:15; etc.).25 Rainer Kessler notes that the term occurs very frequently in the book of Malachi, which therefore features a “theol ogy of the gift .”26 In each of these instances, the term has the broader meaning of “off ering .”For a closer investigation of its further connotations, it is instructive that the term מנחה occurs another thirty-three times in entirely secular contexts where it designates a gift or present of reverence or reconciliation , for instance in the scene of Jacob’s encounter with Esau (Gen 32:13 [ 14 mt], 18 [ 19 mt], 21 [ 22 mt]; 33:10). At their meeting, Jacob’s gift was accompa nied by various expressions of respect (Jacob bowed to the ground seven times, 33:3; also the women and children bowed down, vv. 6–7; Jacob addressed Esau repeatedly as אדני—“my lord,” vv. 8, 13, 14; Jacob expressed his hope to fi nd favor with Esau, v. 10; etc.). In addition, the term מנחה is parallel to ברכה—“gift /present of blessing” (v. 11). Th e term occurs with a similar meaning in the story of King Ben-Hadad of Aram who asked Hazael to bring presents to the prophet Elisha so that the latter would predict whether the king would recover from his illness or not (2 Kgs 8:7–9). Its meaning is somewhat diff erent, for instance, in the narrative of Israel’s defeat and subsequent oppres-sion through King Eglon of Moab. Here it designates the “tribute” that Ehud, who would later deliver Israel, initially had to pay to Eglon (Judg 3:15–18; for a similar usage of מנחה, see also 2 Sam 8:2/1 Chr 18:2; 1 Kgs 4:21 [1 Kgs 5:1 mt]). In all of these texts, מנחה signifi es a present or payment that corresponds to a power diff erential in the private or political realm. Th e act of giving a present or tribute constitutes a required and due gesture of submission.27 Th e connotations and functions of the term in secular contexts pro vide param-eters for its meaning in cultic contexts: מנחה indicates that a ritual sacrifi ce is a gift of reverence or reconciliation for God. It conveys both the submission of the off erer and his or her acknowledgment of the superior status of God.28 Th is is the ultimate reason why sacrifi ces must be of high quality—only a precious gift truly displays human re spect (Lev 21:17–25; Deut 17:1).

According to T. H. Gaster, another expression of submission is the gesture of removing one’s shoes before approaching the sanctuary; iconographic evidence even at tests to the ancient Near Eastern custom of ritual nudity (cf. Gaster, “Sacrifi ces and Off erings , OT,” IDB 4:147–59 [156–57]). Gaster also mentions that the association of מנחה to tribute has paral lels in several Akkadian texts (ibid., 148)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"26Ritual and MetaphorMalachi criti cizes the practice of off ering blind, lame, or sick animals for God; such sacrifi ces send the opposite message because they indicate that the off erer despises God (Mal 1:6–14). With these specifi c connotations and functions, the meaning of מנחה is in some measure comparable to that of the term קרבן, which is customarily translated as “off ering ” (see above). It focuses, however, more strongly on “the relationship between the indi vidual worshiper and God and between the Israelite community and the God of Israel.”29 A third group of terms for cultic sacrifi ce in the Hebrew Bible are the verbal and nominal derivates of the root זבח. A common opinion on the meaning of the זבח was articulated by Norman H. Snaith: “What then was the זבח? Gray . . . said the word ‘means simply what is slain,’ and no one will quarrel with that. If therefore we want an English word for זבח, . . . it ought to be ‘slain-off ering ’. . .”30 In addition, Snaith follows the classical argument of William Robertson Smith ac-cording to which sa crifi cial meals affi rmed the unity of primitive clans through the consump tion of consecrated meat. “Th e זבח is therefore a common meal in that all the people together eat of the Holy Food; they ‘eat the god’, and so fi nd vigour and new life for body and soul. It is therefore a shared meal, a communion meal, not because God eats some of it, but rather because they ‘eat God’. ”31 Is it possible to substantiate either aspect of this interpretation? Th e verb זבח can mean “to slaughter ” (Deut 12:15, 21; 1 Sam 28:24); in these cases it is equivalent to טבח—“to slaughter , massacre” (1 Sam 25:11; Jer 12:3)—and to שחטׁ—“to slaughter .”32 Th e regulations on cultic sacrifi ces in Lev 1–7, however, never feature the verb זבח to articulate animal slaughter ; instead, they always use שחטׁ. Yet the spectrum of meaning of the root זבח is not limited to just animal slaughter ; it also comprises at least the following two aspects: First, the type of sacrifi ce called זבח in the Hebrew Bible encompasses a festive meal during which the off erer, together with family and friends, had the privilege of eating sacrifi -cial meat (Gen 31:54; Exod 18:12; 24:5; Deut 27:7; 1 Sam 1:3–4; 2:13–16; 9:12–13; 1 Kgs 8:62–66; 19:21; Hos 8:13; 1 Chr 29:21–22). Such a meal is an integral part of this sacrifi ce and implied in the term זבח. However, in response to Snaith’s argu-ment that a meal following a זבח could be inter preted as a communion meal that consists of the consumption of some thing holy , and therefore of God, it must be emphasized that no Hebrew Bible text supports such an idea. To the contrary, the prohibition against eating suet because it belongs to God (Lev 3:17; 7:25) indicates a strict separation between that which is for God and that which is for humans. It is impossible, then, to claim that the God of Israel would be identifi ed with the sacrifi cial animal.33 Rather the fact that sacrifi cial rituals are performed “before 29. Levine, Leviticus, xxiii. 30. N. H. Snaith, “Sacrifi ces in the Old Testament,” VT 7 (1957): 308–17 [309] (with refer ence to G. B. Gray, Sacrifi ce in the Old Testament [1925], 6). Th e term “slain-off ering” is equiva lent to the customary German rendering of זבח as Schlachtopfer.31. Ibid., 313. 32. Cf. C.

Holy Smokes!yhwh” (Lev 1:5; see also 3:2; etc.) and that sacrifi ces are eaten “before yhwh, your God” (Deut 27:7) suggests both proximity to God while simultaneously maintain-ing a sense of separation. Second, it is of interest to note that the Akkadian equivalent zebû is used for fu-migation. Burning is also a component of the type of sacrifi ce called שלמיםׁ זבח in the Hebrew Bible; its ritual in Lev 3 features lengthy regulations on exactly which suet portions and organs of the sacrifi cial animal are to be burnt as a “pleasing odor for yhwh” (ליהוה ניחוח ריח) on the altar of burnt off ering (Lev 3:3–5; 9–11; etc.). Th e ritual of this type of sacrifi ce progresses toward, and attains its purpose in, the burning rite and the festive meal. Th ese two aspects belong to the “ap-portionment” of the sacrifi cial animal; in the end, God, the off erer, and even the priests receive their portion.34 It is therefore likely that the term זבח used by the ancient Israelite communities and early tradents of the texts for this type of sacri-fi ce comprised both the burning rite and the subsequent sacrifi cial meal .35 Hence a more appropriate translation of the verb זבח is “to sacrifi ce” ; the noun should respectively be rendered as “sacrifi ce.”A fi nal consideration concerns the Hebrew term for “altar ,” the noun מזבח. De-rived from זבח, this noun is oft en considered to convey that an altar is the locus of ritual animal slaughter . However, this does not match the ritual reality as it emerges from the priestly texts in the He brew Bible. Animals are not slaughtered on the altar of burnt off ering but north of it near the entrance of the courtyard (Lev 1:5, 11; see also later traditions like m. Zeb. 5:1). Ezekiel mentions eight tables in the vesti bule of the gate that are reserved for animal slaughter (Ezek 40:39–41).36 By contrast, this altar is the location where substances from all types of sacrifi ces —including the cereal off ering —are off ered to God through the burning rite.37 An altar , then, is more appropriately described as a place of sacrifi ce in general which is conveyed by the Hebrew noun מזבח.38 At this point a brief investigation of Greek terminology is instructive. Both the Greek verb θύω and the related noun θυσία can refer to the act of slaughter (Exod 12:21; Deut 12:15, 21; 1 Sam 25:11; 28:24). Yet both have a broader meaning as well. Th is is especially manifest when considering the translation practice in lxx. Th e noun θυσία occurs not only 138 times as translation of the term זבח, but also 134 times as the equivalent of the term מנחה in both its meaning for the “cereal off ering ” (e.g., Lev 2:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15; 9:4, 17, 18; Num 15:4) and as a general term for “sacrifi ce ” (e.g., Gen 4:3, 5). Consisting of vegetal sub-stances, the cereal off ering naturally features no act of slaughter . Instead the only ritual step to be carried out at the sanctuary is the burning rite on the central altar . Th is has important ramifi cations for the understanding of the term θυσία. Th ere 34. Apportionment of sacrifi cial substances means its division and distribution, usually for consumption ; cf. McClymond, Beyond Sacred Violence, 56–59, 131–51. 35. Cf. Eberhart, Studien, 89–90. 36. Cf. Milgrom, Leviticus, 154–55; C. Eberhart, Studien, 180. 37. Cf. K. Galling, “Altar,” IDB 1:96–100 [96]. 38. Even the English term altar is derived from Latin altare—“altar,” which is probably related to the verb adolere—“to burn.”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"28Ritual and Metaphorare, however, other instances where θύω or θυσία is equivalent to the verb or noun derived from the root זבח and implies the participation in a sacrifi cial meal (Exod 18:12; 24:5; Deut 27:7; 1 Sam 1:3–4; 2:13–16; 1 Kgs 8:62–66; 19:21; Hos 8:13; 1 Chr 29:21–22). How can this spectrum of meaning be explained? According to an article in Th eologisches Wörterbuch zum Neuen Testament, the verb θύω originally denotes a forceful motion of the air, water , and so on with the mean ing of “to well up, to boil up” from which the meaning of “to smoke” and “to cause to go up in smoke” as well as “to sacrifi ce ” developed.39 Th ese clarifi cations are an invitation to broaden the common perception of what the Greek terms θύω and θυσία mean; they clearly are not limited to acts of slaughter or killing . Only the broader meaning allows one to com prehend why Paul could use the term θυσία as a metaphor for gift s that Epaphroditus had delivered on behalf of the congregation in Philippi (Phil 4:18; see above). To sum up these terminological refl ections, comprehensive words for cultic sacrifi ces in the Hebrew Bible all have individual profi les. Th e word קרבן conveys an approach or a dynamic movement through sacred space that concludes in the burning rite on the altar and the smoke as cending to heaven; מנחה expresses a relationship between humans and God while pointing at a status diff erence that necessitates appropriate gift s of reverence. Th e noun זבח and its Greek equiva-lents θυσία reference the entire activity of ritual sacrifi ce that can comprise animal slaughter , burning, and meat consumption . Th is means that none of these compre-hensive terms in the Bible focuses exclusively on slaughter ; instead, all of them include the fi nal act of burning. It should be mentioned that yet another two comprehensive terms for sacri-fi ce are attested in the Hebrew Bible. Th e fi rst one is שהׁא—“fi re off ering .” In the priestly texts, it usually describes the process of trans forming the material off er-ing into a new, ethereal essence during the burning rite. Th e second term is ריח ניחוח—“pleasing odor.” It typically refers to the ascent of the sacrifi cial smoke from the earthly to the hea venly sphere.40 With these meanings, both terms are fre-quently featured as interpretive terms in, for example, the sacrifi cial rituals in Lev 1–7 and are still known in later Jewish texts such as m. Men. 13:11:אשה ובמנחה ניחוח ריח אשה העוף ובעולת ניחוח ריח אשה הבהמה בעולת נאמרדעתו את אדם שיכון ובלבד הממעיט ואחד המרבה שאחד שאחד ללמד ניחוח ריחלשמיםIt is said of the burnt off ering of the herd, a fi re off ering, a pleasing odor, and of the bird off ering , a fi re off ering , a pleasing odor, and of the cereal off ering , a fi re off ering , a pleasing odor to teach that all the same are the one who off ers much and the one who off ers little, provided that a per son will direct his intention to Heaven.39.

Holy Smokes!Th eir importance is manifest as well in rabbinic guidelines which specify that a sacrifi ce is to be sacri fi ced for the sake of six things, among them “for the sake of the [altar ] fi res (אשים לשם), for the sake of the odor (ריח לשם), for the sake of the pleasing smell (ניחוח לשם)” (m. Zeb. 4:6). Yet beyond these specifi c functions, both terms also occur repeatedly as com-prehensive references for the entire sacrifi cial cult. According to a calendar of ap-pointed festivals, the feast of unleavened bread is cele brated for seven days during which “fi re off erings for yhwh” (ליהוה שהׁא) are to be off ered daily (Lev 23:8; see also Exod 30:20; Lev 6:10, 11; 21:6, 21; 22:22, 27; Num 15:25; 28:3, 19; 1 Sam 2:28; etc.). And a pronounce ment of judgment because of Israel’s disobedience men-tions three areas that God will aff ect through divine punishment: “I will lay your cities waste, I will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will no longer smell your pleasing odors (ניחחכם בריח אריח ולא)” (Lev 26:31). In this passage, a corollary of the desolation of human dwelling places is the abandonment of local worship sites; the latter, in turn, leads to the termination of the sacrifi cial cult that is customarily performed there. Th e phrase ניחוח ריח is used with similar purposes in Num 15:17; Ezek 6:13; 16:19; 20:28; and so on. It is still known in later Judean literature, for in stance in 1QS 8:9; 4Q179 Frag. 1:6; and in m. Zeb. 14:10: מנחה אין אומר יהודה רבי ניחוח וריח שרת וכלי שרת ובגדי וכהון בבמה (“Rabbi Judah says, ‘Th ere is no cereal off ering on a high place nor the priestly service, nor the wear ing of garments of ministry, nor the use of utensils of ministry, nor the pleasing odor’ ”). Both שהׁא and ניחוח ריח also occur together as com prehensive references to the sacrifi cial cult (Lev 23:13, 18; Num 15:3, 14; 28:2; 29:6; etc.). In addition, a general term for “sacrifi ce” in biblical Ara maic is ניחחין (Dan 2:46; Ezra 6:8–10), which is derived from ניחוח ריח. Hence comprehensive terminology that references the sacrifi cial cult in the Hebrew Bible strongly relies on the burning rite, suggesting that it is an important element.41 Th e title of this contribution suggests that through fi re and smoke, materials off ered by humans, be they animals or vegetal substances, are transformed and transported to God. Th ese refl ections on the sacrifi cial terminology of ritual sacrifi ce also yield the result that, in the Hebrew Bible, comprehensive terminology for sacrifi cial rituals does not exclusively focus on the act of animal slaugh ter . Th is corresponds to the observation that statements attributing any specifi c value or eff ect to the act of animal slaughter in the context of sacrifi cial rituals are not attested.42 In some con-41.

Which Rituals Are Not Considered as Sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible?Due to the burning rite, the burnt off ering , cereal off ering, sacrifi ce of well-being, sin off ering , and guilt off ering are each in their own right called ליהוה קרבן—“of-fering for yhwh”—in Lev 1–7. By contrast, other rituals usually do not count as ליהוה קרבן in the Hebrew Bible. I shall now ex amine four of them.43 1. Th e Passover ritual was already discussed above. According to Exod 12, the Israelites were supposed to slaughter a lamb that had to be consumed in its entirety. Any remainder had to be de stroyed by fi re ; the Hebrew verb for this action is שרףׂ (v. 10). It is thus terminologi-cally distinguished from the burning rite on the altar of the sanctu-ary that is always designated through the verb קטר hiphil. Th en the apotropaic blood rite had to be performed that would protect the Is-raelites from the fatal strike directed at Egypt’s fi rstborn (vv. 7, 22). Th is ritual is not counted as קרבן in the sacrifi cial regulations of Lev 1–7. Th e reason might be that it is performed at the resi dence of lay people. At least the directives in Exod 12 lack any pro visions of “approaching” the sanctuary (this is diff erent in, for example, the Deuteronomic version in Deut 16:1–8). Furthermore, since no por-tion of the lamb is off ered for God, the Passover lacks any as pect of giving a token of reverence or reconciliation that would correspond to the status diff erence between humans and God, thus allowing the Passover ritual to be recognized as a מנחה. 2. Animal blood is used in the purifi cation ritual for what is called a “leprous person” (מצרע) and a “leprous house” (Lev 14). In both cases a ritual with two birds is performed : aft er one bird is slaugh-tered , the second one is dipped into the blood of the fi rst and be-comes the medium for sprinkling the blood seven times upon the person (v. 7) or house (v. 51). Th is blood application rite “cleanses” (v. 7) the person or “removes sin ” from the house and “atones” for it (v. 52). Th en the second, living bird is re leased to fl y into the fi eld. Th is is an elimination ritual in which the live bird carries the disease away. Th e ritual then concludes with the off ering of sacrifi ces at the sanctuary (vv. 10–20). It is evident that the elimination ritual as such features dynam-ics contrary to those of cultic sacrifi ces . While in the latter humans off er their best animals and choice products to God who dwells in the sanctuary at the center of human civilization, in elimination 43. Cf. Eberhart, Studien, 319–20."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"31Eberhart: Sacrifice? Holy Smokes!rituals human defi lement, perceived of in a quasi-ma terial quality, is transported away from civilization into un cultivated territory.44 Once more, therefore, no approach of the sanctuary occurs that would warrant that this ritual be labeled קרבן, and no portion is of-fered for God as a gesture of reverence due to which the ritual could be called a מנחה. 3. Th e best-known elimination ritual in the Hebrew Bible is that of the scapegoat (Lev 16:10, 20–22). On the Day of Atonement , Aa ron the high priest transfers all of the sins and impurities of Israel onto a live goat “for Azazel.” Th is goat then carries Israel’s guilt and sin away into the wilderness. Th e structural similarities with the previous bird ritual are evident; therefore, its logic is also diametrically opposed to that of cultic sacrifi ce . Hence the scapegoat ritual is not considered a קרבן or מנחה in the Hebrew Bi ble. 4. As a consequence of bloodshed, the land is generally consi dered to be defi led by the victim’s blood (Gen 4:11–12; Num 35:33; Ezek 7:23). If no culprit can be determined and the punish ment of the perpetra-tor is impossible, a unique ritual is intended to provide substitution for the death of the murderer (Deut 21:1–9). During this ritual, the elders of the community where the bloodshed has occurred bring a heifer and break its neck. Th is procedure is not a sacrifi ce but a killing ritual; it atones for the bloodguilt (v. 8) and purges “the guilt of innocent blood from your midst” ( v. 9). It is, therefore, not called קרבן or מנחה. Th is brief examination of several rituals in the Hebrew Bible shows that consis-tent “standards” for cultic sacrifi ces seemed to exist. Aspects of these “standards” are conveyed through, among other things, the com prehensive terminology for sacrifi ce and show that sacrifi ces belong primarily to the context of worship and the domain of sacredness. Th e latter aspect is appropriately communicated by the modern English term sacrifi ce that goes back to Latin . Th e literal meaning of the Latin term sacrifi cium is “to make holy” and “to dedicate.” Even this Latin term, there fore, features no explicit connotations to killing or slaughter . 4. Conclusions: Sacrifice? Holy Smokes! I hope that my contribution helps to use the word sacrifi ce in a more refl ective manner. Th is term has a spectrum of diff erent meanings; it is polyvalent.

Th is meaning is by no means original, yet it is a natural lin guistic development that language and es-pecially technical terms change their import over time. Th e modern secularized meaning should, how ever, not be applied to sacrifi cial rituals in the Hebrew Bible from which such metaphors were derived. To recover layers of how the original com munities and tradents of the texts understood cultic sacrifi ces , I investi gated comprehensive Hebrew Bible terminology for sacrifi ce. Th e study demonstrates that this terminology does not focus on aspects of killing but includes a variety of ritual activities. Th e burning rite especially emerges as an essential element of cultic sacrifi ce. Th is ritual component is the conclusion of a dynamic process of approaching God which mani fests that humans off er tokens of reverence, thus affi rming a relationship despite and through the acknowledgment of the status diff erence be tween them and God. Such a perspective allows the incorporation of more than just animal sacrifi ces or blood application rites into modern schol-arly theorizing; it opens the door for the inclusion of ritual sacrifi ces from vegetal substances."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"3The Place of Human Sacrifice in the Israelite CultJason TatlockOne might respond to the title of this chapter by asserting that human sacrifi ce never had a place in the Israelite cult, or at least that it held no legitimate position within the religious system.1 Human sacrifi ce by conse quence would be considered an aberration, even extraordinary, and perhaps resulting from foreign infl uences that corrupted normative religiosity.2 Surely, a deity such as Yahweh would have had nothing to do with such nefarious practices, as Berquist has argued in refer-ence to child immolation: “Th ere is no anger within God that demands a destruc-tive response or that seeks the death of any person, innocent or guilty.”3 Yet such a view is a gross simplifi cation and misrepresentation of ancient Jewish beliefs and rituals and fails to appreciate the com plexity of the sacrifi cial traditions inherent in the Hebrew Bible. Th e Bible is a composite text, representing diverse theologi-cal views written over the course of several historical eras. What was denounced in one period was endorsed in a previous context, and what was accepted by one worshiper of Yahweh was rejected by a contemporary practitioner. To suggest that every form of human immolation was always an illicit practice is an opinion de-rived from viewing passages in isolation, such as those denouncing Canaanite rites (Deut 12:31; 18:10), and assuming that they correspond to all forms of human 1. A more thorough analysis of human sacrifi ce in ancient Israel and the neighboring re-gions is found in Jason Tatlock, “How in Ancient Times Th ey Sacrifi ced People: Human Im-molation in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin with Special Emphasis on Ancient Israel and the Near East” (Ph.D. diss., University of Michigan, 2006).

Hence, it is the purpose of this chapter to situate many types of human sacrifi ce within a larger cultic context, demonstrat ing that in many instances the slaying of humans functioned ritualisti cally in parallel ways to animal slaughter . Micah 6:6–8 is, therefore, a fi tting point of departure, given its exploration of the necessity of animal and human sacrifi ce :With what shall I draw near to Yahweh, When I bow down before the God on high?Shall I approach him with burnt-sacrifi ces , With year-old calves?Shall Yahweh be pleased with more than a thousand rams, With ten thousand streams of oil?Shall I give my fi rstborn (as a sacrifi ce ) for my transgression, Th e fruit of my loins (as a sacrifi ce) for the iniquity of my life-force?Let it be declared to you, O man, what is appropriate, And what Yahweh seeks from you:Only to practice justice, To love loyalty, And to live in humility with your God.Rams in great number and oil without measure certainly give one the impres-sion that the author uses hyperbole to emphasize the need for justice, loyalty, and humility. Does this mean, however, that the refer ences to the various types of sacrifi ces , especially of children , are merely exaggerations, too, meant to convey the absurdity of attempting to pla cate Yahweh with any type of sacrifi ce? Osten-sibly, scholars such as Mays, Wolff , and Sweeney would answer in the affi rmative concerning child sacrifi ce as hyperbolic in the passage, given their perspective that human immolation was illegal within Yahwism.5 By contrast, others, namely Mosca and Andersen and Freedman, have argued that the pas sage builds to cli-max, with the proposed sacrifi ce of a fi rstborn child at the top of a list of immola-tions with ever increasing values.6 If this is true, then fi rstborn sacrifi ce would be one of several permissible sacri fi ces outlined in the passage, albeit a form of im-molation ultimately re jected along with the other sacrifi cial acts in favor of justice, 4.

Th is, of course, begs the fundamental question regarding the extent to which fi rstborn sacrifi ce , as well as other types of human immolation, was ever accepta ble in Yahwistic circles. Certainly numerous passages denounce specifi c kinds of human sacrifi ce , such as those performed unto Molek (Lev 20:1–5), but a careful reading of the tradi-tions will illustrate that a complete prohibition of all forms of human sacrifi ce for all times did not exist. Th e other important issue to consider is the nature of the biblical stance on the acceptability of utilizing a human victim for the sake of expiation . On the issue of the suitability of fi rstborn immolation within Yah wism, several passages indicate it was once endorsed (Gen 22; Judg 11); nevertheless, there is nothing in the passages to indicate in any defi nitive fa shion that fi rstborn sacrifi ce was ever utilized for the purpose of remov ing the guilt of sin . In truth, the biblical texts are generally ambiguous in terms of the function of fi rstborn immolation within the sacrifi cial sys tem. Th is is due in no small part to the fact that, in most instances, the divine demand that the Israelites immolate their fi rstborn sons is coun tered by the command to ransom them. Th is is seen in such passages as:Exodus 13:12–15Th en you shall cause to pass over to Yahweh every fi rstborn; every fi rstborn of the off spring of a beast which belongs to you, the males shall be Yah weh’s. Yet, every fi rstborn of a donkey you shall ransom by means of a sheep; although if you do not ransom [it], then you shall snap its neck; every human fi rstborn among your sons, you shall ransom . Hence, it shall be when your son asks you in the future, “Why?” you will tell him, “With a strong hand Yahweh caused us to go out from Egypt , from a house of servi tude. Because Pharaoh was hard set against sending us away, Yahweh took the life of every fi rstborn in the land of Egypt from human fi rstborn to ani mal fi rstborn; that is why I sacrifi ce to Yahweh all the fi rstborn males but all the fi rstborn of my sons, I ransom .” Exodus 34:18–20Th e Festival of Unleavened Bread you shall keep, seven days you shall con sume unleavened bread which I commanded you for the appointed time, the month of Aviv, because during the month of Aviv, you went forth from Egypt . Every fi rst-born is my [Yahweh’s] possession as well as every male7 of your herd, the fi rstborn of cattle and sheep. Every fi rstborn of a donkey you shall ransom by means of a sheep, although if you do not ransom [it], then you shall snap its neck; every fi rstborn of your sons you shall ransom , but they shall not be present before me with nothing (i.e., they must bring a substitute sacrifi ce ).Numbers 18:14–17Everything dedicated in Israel shall belong to you [to Aaron and his descen dants]. Every fi rstborn of all fl esh, which is brought near to Yahweh, among humankind or beast shall belong to you. Yet, you shall defi nitely ransom the fi rstborn of hu-mankind and the fi rstborn of unclean beasts you shall ransom as well. You shall pay its ransom from a newborn [on up] at your arranged price, fi ve shekels of sil-7.

Nevertheless, the fi rstborn of a head of cattle or the fi rstborn of a sheep or the fi rstborn of a goat you shall not ransom —they are set apart; their blood you shall scatter upon the altar and their fat you shall burn as incense with fi re as a pleasing aroma to Yahweh.By contrast, Exod 22:28–29 [Eng., vv. 29–30] mentions nothing about redeem ing the fi rstborn sons. It reads:Your produce and your wine you shall not delay; the fi rstborn of your sons you shall grant to me. Th us, you shall do for your cattle [and] sheep: for seven days the [young] will be with its mother, on the eighth day you shall grant it to me.While this passage parallels Mic 6:7 by utilizing the same verb, נתן,8 to describe the sacrifi cial action, Exod 22 does not specify the type of sacri fi ce for which the victims were intended. An additional text also lacking a ransom clause, Neh 10:36 [Hebrew, 10:37], is likewise ambiguous, for it merely indicates that the Judeans in the time of Nehemiah were commit ted to fulfi lling God’s command to bring to the temple their fi rstborn sons and animals—though there is no compelling evidence to suggest that the Judeans practiced fi rstborn sacrifi ce in the postexilic period, for it was already a matter of contention in the days of Ezekiel and Jeremiah in the late monarchical period (see below). As for the passages with ran som clauses, two key issues emerge that at the very least point to the roles played by the animal victims , but not necessarily that of the hu mans: (1) unredeemed fi rstborn cattle, sheep, and goats were to be set apart to Yahweh, their blood scattered on the altar ,9 and their fat burned “as a fi re-off ering for a soothing aroma to Yahweh” (Num 18:17), which is a sacrifi cial procedure elsewhere prescribed for peace-off erings (Lev 17:5–6); and (2) they were to be sacrifi ced to commemorate the Pass over —the ransom ed sons symbolically representing the delivered Israe lites; the sacrifi ced animals , the slain Egyptians and their livestock (Exod 13:12–15). Such diversity in function in-dicates that fi rstborn animals were not sacrifi ced for a single purpose. Th is is also the case with the slaying of fi rstborn children as burnt-sacrifi ces .Indeed, the quintessential fi rstborn immolation (or near-immolation) in the Hebrew Bible, Gen 22, does not assist in elucidating a single func tion for fi rstborn sacrifi ce, especially in regard to expiation , for not only does it promote in nar-rative form what the legislative texts are stating—that fi rstborn children should be ransomed —but the text represents the sacrifi ce of Isaac simply as an עלה, or burnt-sacrifi ce , with the fundamen tal purpose of testing Abraham’s obedience, as the fi rst verses of the passage indicate:Aft er these things, the following occurred: Elohim tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham ?” and he responded, “Here I am.” Th en he said, “Take your only son, whom you adore, namely, Isaac , you, yourself, travel to the land of Moriah, 8. Among its many uses, נתן can denote the slaying of a victim in a sacrifi cial context (Lev 22:22). 9. Following the distinction made by Gilders between scattering (זרק) and sprinkling (נזה) in Israelite tradition; William K. Gilders, Blood Ritual in the Hebrew Bible: Meaning and Power (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004), 26–27, 201 n. 56."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"37Tatlock: The Place of Human Sacrifice in the Israelite Cultand send him up there as a burnt-sacrifi ce upon one of the mountains which I will indicate to you.” Abraham woke up early in the morning, saddled his ass, brought two of his young men along with him as well as Isaac , his son; then he split the wood of the burnt-sacrifi ce , got up, and traveled to the place where Elo-him indicated to him. (Gen 22:1–3)It is only at the climax of the story that the narrator informs the audience that a ram would serve as the sacrifi cial victim in Isaac’s stead. Investigat ing the ways that rams could function in the Israelite cult does not, unfortunately, provide clarifi cation for Mic 6 and the issue of purifi cation from sin and the function of fi rstborn victims . It is clear that rams could be sacrifi ced by fi re for the sake of atonement /purgation (Lev 16:3, 5, 24; כפר),10 but the burnt-sacrifi ce of a ram need not be asso ciated exclusively with a purifi cation process. Numbers 28:11–15, for instance, indicates that a ram, together with other animals and off erings , was to be sacrifi ced as an עלה on a monthly basis, ostensibly to provide food for Yahweh. But a goat, not a ram, accompanied the burnt-sacrifi ces to obtain forgiveness for sin . Th e other key texts in which fi rstborn children are immolated as burnt sacri-fi ces do not provide any additional assistance on the matter of expiation . Jeph thah’s sacrifi ce of his daughter in Judg 11 is performed in response to a vow undertaken during a military crisis. Hence it is a votive sacrifi ce and one that receives divine sanction, as seen by Yahweh’s fulfi llment of his end of the bargain—that is, Jeph-thah promised that he would sacrifi ce the fi rst person to meet him upon returning home should he be granted victory against the Ammonites. Yahweh provided a suc-cessful military encounter; thus, Jephthah sacrifi ced his daughter. Such a votive of-fering is paralleled by the animal sacrifi ces mentioned in Ps 66, wherein the writer exclaims that burnt-sacrifi ces will be given to ful fi ll vows undertaken during a time of crisis (vv. 13–15). As for an addi tional reference to child sacrifi ce in Trans-jordan, Mesha’s immolation of his son on the walls of Kir-Hareseth in 2 Kgs 3 also occurs in the context of war, but it presents some serious complications regarding its relation ship to Israelite cultic practices in light of the fact that it is not explic-itly a Yahwistic practice; nevertheless, it is clear that the biblical writers viewed Mesha’s sacrifi ce to an unnamed deity as particularly effi cacious. It is arguable that the Deuteronomists interpreted the rite in conjunction with their own religious beliefs, recognizing the capacity of burnt-sacri fi ce to avert disaster. For example, one encounters in the closing verses of 2 Samuel a reference to the performance of animal burnt-sacrifi ce , to gether with peace off erings , in a successful attempt to ward off a plague aff ecting the Israelite nation in the days of David.Th ere is at least one additional point that must be made concerning Gen 22, that is, beyond its promotion of the concept of fi rstborn redemp tion. Th e account 10. Th e use of the compound phrase atonement /purgation (i.e., purifi cation ) is intended to take into account discussions about the nature of כפר by Jacob Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16 (AB 3; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1991), 1079–84, and John B. Geyer, “Blood and the Nations in Ritual and Myth ,” VT 57 (2007): 1–20, particularly Milgrom’s assessment, while bearing in mind the typical translation of the root and its derivatives (i.e., atonement ).

Abraham’s unqualifi ed accep tance of Yahweh’s demand to slay Isaac at the start of the narrative re fl ects the one-time acceptance of the practice, but the substitution of the ram at the end of the passage corresponds to the rite’s transition into obscurity. Indeed, there is every indication that fi rstborn sacrifi ce was both permissible and advisable in the preexilic era, as Ezek 20:25–26 states: “I [Yahweh] also gave them statutes that were not good and cus toms in which they could not live. I made them unclean by their gift s in causing every fi rstborn to pass over so that I could decimate them/make them infertile, so that they would know that I am Yahweh.” While this text clearly indicates that Yahweh had once endorsed fi rst-born immola tion and that the dedication of the fi rstborn (e.g., Exod 22) originally entailed slaying the child as a sacrifi ce , the author is attempting to per suade the reader to abandon its practice. In fact, the prophet elsewhere emphatically indi-cates that such a practice is entirely unacceptable (Ezek 23:37–39), saying:For they [Samaria and Jerusalem ] were adulterous and had blood on their hands; with their idols they committed adultery and also their sons, whom they bore unto me, they caused to pass over to them for food. Still this they did to me: they made my sanctuary unclean on that day and polluted my Sabbaths; that is, aft er they slaughtered their sons to their idols, they came to my sanctuary on that day in order to defi le it. Th us they did in the midst of my temple . Yahweh is not implicated here as endorsing the rite, but his followers are described as practitioners of child immolation ; that is, they both wor shiped Yahweh at his sanctuary and sacrifi ced their sons to other dei ties beforehand. As tempting as it might be to locate the practice of child sacrifi ce at the Jerusalem Temple , the verbal sequence suggests that the transgressors immolated their sons prior to worshiping at the central shrine. Th e defi lement of the temple resulted not from the practice of child sacrifi ce therein, but from the contamination of innocent blood which accompanied the worshipers when they entered the sanctuary. Psalm 106:37–38 poignantly describes the contaminating power of inno cent blood :Th ey sacrifi ced their sons and their daughters to the šēdîm. Th ey poured out in-nocent blood , the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrifi ced to the cultic images of Canaan. Hence, the land was defi led with blood .Th e spilling of innocent blood (נקי דם or נקיא דם) surfaces elsewhere in the biblical portrayal of child sacrifi ce , specifi cally its practice in Jerusa lem of the late Judean period. Second Kings 21:16, for instance, explains that Manasseh had fi lled Jeru-salem with innocent blood , which in 2 Kgs 24:3–4 is identifi ed as one of the most signifi cant factors leading to the Judean exile. It would perhaps not be too great a stretch to suggest that the blood of sacrifi ced children was included in this as-sessment, for we know that Manasseh was implicated in the practice (2 Kgs 21:6). Even so, the immolation of innocent children at the capital city is an important feature of Jeremiah’s prophetic denunciation of his contemporaries in a message delivered in the Hinnom Valley, the infamous location of the Topheth. Standing there, the prophet exclaims the following oracle (Jer 19:4–6):"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"39Tatlock: The Place of Human Sacrifice in the Israelite CultOn account of which, they abandoned me and transformed this place into some-thing strange; they burned sacrifi ces in it to other deities, whom neither they, their fathers, nor the kings of Judah knew, and fi lled up this place with innocent blood . Th ey constructed high places for Ba‘al to burn their sons with fi re as burnt sacrifi ces to Ba‘al, which I neither commanded, men tioned, nor did the idea arise in my mind. “Th us, the days are coming,” de clares Yahweh, “at which point this place will never again be called the To pheth or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but only the Valley of Slaughter .”Th e desolation of the city which the prophet goes on to explain, such as noting that the entire town would be defi led like the Topheth, was, ac cording to the afore-mentioned discussion in 2 Kgs 24 (cf. 2 Kgs 23:26–27), a foregone conclusion due to the behavior of Manasseh several years before the Babylonian conquest. Th is is so despite the actions of Manas seh’s grandson, King Josiah , who accomplished, among other things, the defi lement of the Topheth as part of his wide-scale reli-gious reforms (2 Kgs 23:10). Before delving deeper into the matter of innocent blood , two points are worthy of consideration. To begin with, it has been suggested that the Topheth may have in fact been at one time a Yahwistic sanctuary.11 Th is is based upon the supposition that a variant spelling of Topheth appears in Isa 30:33: For since yesterday Topheth (תפתה) has been prepared, Also it has been established for the king (למלך), Made deep [and] wide.Its pile [consisting of ] fl ames and wood has increased. Th e breath of Yahweh is like a torrent of brimstone, It burns it up.תפתה is perhaps an original spelling of the word before it was corrupted to make it sound like the Hebrew word for shame (שתׁב),12 or it may be a compound form meaning “his Topheth.”13 Yahweh’s association with the locale is clear because it is he who ignites the fl ames of the Topheth; thus, it is probable that the child sacri-fi ces denounced in the Bible due to their affi liation with Molek were at one point directed toward Yahweh instead or at least performed by Yahwists who also wor-shiped Molek .14 According to Smith the passage should be regarded “as the best evidence for the early practice of child sacrifi ce in Israel.”15 What is more, Josiah ’s attempts to repair the damage caused by his predecessors should, in my opinion, be viewed “as the best evidence for the early practice of [adult] sacrifi ce in Israel.” How so? Despite what might be the purpose ful attempts of Bible translators to 11. Mosca, Child Sacrifi ce, 212; Mark Smith, Th e Early History of God (2nd ed.; Grand Rapids: W. B.

In the Bible, זבח is most oft en in-dicative of sacrifi cial killings , rather than nonsacrifi cial butchering, and it is not always clear in the biblical texts that זבח is ever completely devoid of sacrifi cial connota tions, even when the killings appear to have more mundane purposes (cf. 1 Sam 28:24).17 Yet even if one were to accept that the verb can have nonsacrifi cial nuances, such is clearly not the case in this particular verse in light of the locations of the killings : Josiah puts the priests to death upon altars . Th us, the epitome of a righteous Yahwist in the Deute ronomistic vein is in no uncertain terms connected to human sacrifi ces at the high places he is attempting to stamp out.18 As strange as this pas sage might seem, it actually fi ts in quite nicely with the overall presenta-tion of human sacrifi ce within the Deuteronomistic corpus. Th at is, human im-molation is largely viewed as permissible within the tradition, provided that it corresponds to the sacrifi ce of the wicked. Th e shedding of innocent human blood is, however, not generally agreeable to the writers. In fact, Deut 19 details one of the safeguards put in place to protect an cient Israel from the guilt of spilling innocent blood : cities of refuge. When a death oc-curred by accident the slayer was to fl ee to one of the cities to avoid the further loss of innocent life in an act of blood ven geance. Yet verses 11–13 indicate that the one who kills with premedita tion was to be executed to “eradicate (בער) the innocent blood from Israel in order that it would be good” for them.19 Deuteronomy 21:1–9 explains that should the murderer be unknown, the elders of the town closest to the dead body could remove the contamination through a sacrifi cial rite involving the killing of a heifer, the washing of their hands over its body, and the pronounce-ment of their innocence in the matter. Th e desired eff ect was that the innocent blood would be eradicated. While the notion of atonement /purgation is utilized 16. Cf.

Th is is one of the most important references to human sacrifi ce as a legitimate prac-tice within Yahwism that appears in the Hebrew Bible. While the analysis is original, I am indebted to an earlier study that highlighted the signifi cance of this text: Michel Gras, Pierre Rouillard, and Javier Teixidor, “Th e Phoenicians and Death,” Berytus 39 (1991): 127–76.19. Deut eronomy 22:20–21 presents an interesting parallel regarding the need to purge the evil of sexual sin from the Israelite community by means of execution."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"41Tatlock: The Place of Human Sacrifice in the Israelite Culthere in conjunction with the slaying of the heifer, the idea similarly appears in a passage regarding the ex ecution of the murderer. Hence, Num 35:33 states: You shall not cause the land wherein you are to be polluted, because the blood , it causes the land to be polluted; for the land, atonement /purgation cannot be achieved on account of the blood which is poured out on it, with the exception of the blood of the one who poured it out.In her discussion of the contaminating eff ects of blood , Frymer-Kensky suggests: Th e pollution of the land cannot be rectifi ed by ritual purifi cation . In the case of murder, the law explicitly states that the blood of the slain cannot be expiated except by the blood of the shedder. Th e only ritual at all connected with the pol-lution of the land is the ritual of the decapitated heifer.20 It is my contention, however, that the slaying of the murderer is itself a ritual of expiation by which the land is purifi ed from the contamination of innocent blood . If one is prepared to accept that the heifer is a sacrifi cial victim , as von Rad has done, then the slaying of the murderer is not so far a jump in logic, given that both victims accomplish the same re sult.21 Th e ability of capital punishment to nullify the eff ects of spilled blood is found elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, namely, 2 Sam 21. Th erein, one encounters a story in which the land of Israel has been lan guishing under a famine for three years during David’s reign. Th e righ teous monarch inquires of Yahweh and discovers that the land is suff er ing from the blood of the Gibeonites whom Saul had inap-propriately slain. David then asks the Gibeonites how he might rectify, literally כפר, the situation. To which the Gibeonites responded that they required seven of Saul’s descendants to kill at Saul’s former capital, Gibeah. David conforms to their wishes and allows them to slay the men during the fi rst days of the barley harvest. It is clear that the timing of their deaths was not coincidental; yet, what is less clear is the method of their slaying. Th at they were “hanged before Yahweh” is a standard translation con forming to the perspective of the nasb, rsv, and kjv. In the Hebrew , one fi nds the verb יקע in the hiphil plus the phrase -ל or לפני Ya h w e h (vv. 6, 9). Following de Vaux, the verb apparently means to cause disarticu lation/detachment in the hiphil, inasmuch as the root appears in the qal in Gen 32:26 [Eng., 32:25] in reference to the dislocation of Jacob’s hip when wrestling with God at Penuel.22 Despite the uncertainty of the translation, the seven descendants were 20.

Despite the fact that von Rad considered the procedure and place of the killing as uncha racteristic of Israelite immolation, positing that the practice was originally a pre-Yahwistic “magical procedure for getting rid of sin ,” the appearance of the prayer in Deut 21:8 indi cates, for him, a transformation of the ritual from a magical practice to a sacrifi ce of expia tion . In short, the slaying of the heifer and accompanying invocation bring about Yahweh’s removal of the blood-guilt. See Gerhard von Rad, Deuteronomy. A Commentary (trans. D.

Th us, as with the slaying of a heifer or murderer, Saul’s descendants were sacrifi ced for the sake of eradicat-ing the contamination brought on by shedding innocent blood ; in this in stance, it is done to restore the land’s fertility.Th e concept of disarticulating someone before Yahweh is also found in Num 25, a text concerning the adulterous interactions between the Israelites and the Moabites in an incident involving Baal-Peor. Moses was instructed by Yahweh in verse 4 to “seize all the leaders of the people and execute them by disarticulation unto (-ל) Yahweh in front of the sun in order that the heat of the anger of Yahweh might turn back from Israel.” It is surprising that, as the narrative continues, it is the ac tions of the priest Phinehas in slaying Zimri and Cozbi, not the disarticula-tion of Israelite leaders, that placated the divine wrath and thereby stopped a plague which had caused twenty-four thousand deaths. It is impor tant to note that Num 25:13 literally states that, by killing these individu als, he had “atoned for the sons of Israel.” Th e imagery of a priest killing living beings for the sake of atonement /purgation and the checking of a plague is reminiscent of the use of incense by the high priest , Aaron , to stop a plague ravishing the Israelites in Num 16:41–50 [Heb., 17:6–15]. Th ere, the notion of atonement /purgation (כפר) appears as well. Of course, in this case, incense, rather than blood sacrifi ce , accomplishes the de-sired eff ect. By comparison, animal burnt- and peace off erings similarly halted a plague in the aforementioned passage related to King David (2 Sam 24), though the concept of כפר does not occur therein.Beyond the importance of atonement in these passages, the idea that the slay-ing of individuals by disarticulation takes place in the presence of Yahweh or, at least, unto him, necessitates further consideration, even if briefl y. Th e story that best illustrates the practice of slaying someone before Yahweh is the death of Agag at the hands of the prophet -judge-priest Samuel. According to 1 Sam 15, Saul was commanded to perform the חרם against the Amalekites. He was specifi cally com-manded “not to spare them but to kill everyone from man to woman , child to in-fant, cattle to sheep, camel to donkey” (v. 3). Saul failed to follow these guide lines, both allowing Agag to live and permitting the people to bring back from the bat-tlefi eld an assortment of animals, apparently for the purpose of sacrifi cing them to Yahweh at the cultic site of Gilgal. It is at this loca tion that Samuel seized Agag and slew him לפני Yahweh (v. 33). It is unfortunate that like יקע, the exact mean-ing of the verb שסףׁ is unknown, though it is frequently translated as “hewed” (so nasb, rsv, kjv). What is clear to me, however, is that this takes place in Yahweh’s presence as a sacrifi cial act which fulfi lls the חרם pronounced against the Amale-kites. Similarly, the objects devoted to destruction that Achan stole from Jeri cho were eventually presented לפני Yahweh in order to complete the חרם pronounced against that town (Josh 7:23). In both instances, there is a delayed fulfi llment of the dedicatory process. Judging from the situation faced by the Israelites due to Achan’s poor decision, that is, divine wrath and military defeat, one can assume that the Israelites would have rec ognized the potential consequences of failing to fulfi ll the demands of divine warfare as soon as possible.An additional passage on חרם, Deut 13, commands that the true follow ers of"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"43Tatlock: The Place of Human Sacrifice in the Israelite CultYahweh should do the following if they were to encounter an Israelite town that has chosen to seek aft er other deities (vv. 16–17 [Eng., vv. 15–16]): You shall thoroughly strike the residents of that city by the edge of the sword; dedicate it, all who are in it, and its livestock by the edge of the sword. All its plun-der you shall gather to the midst of its plaza and you shall burn with fi re the city and all its plunder, a complete-sacrifi ce to Yahweh, your god; it will be a perpetual ruin; it will not be built again. Th e pivotal phrase in this passage that describes the act of חרם as “a complete-sacrifi ce to Yahweh,” or ליהוה כליל, also occurs in 1 Sam 7:9. Th ere, כליל and עלה appear side by side to indicate the total destruction of the sacrifi cial victim , a lamb, by means of fi re .23 Niditch has inter preted Deut 13 as “the most literal reference to the ban as sacrifi ce” that occurs in the Hebrew scriptures;24 it is certainly one of the most impor tant passages on the matter. Niditch, moreover, diff erentiates between biblical portrayals of חרם as a type of sacrifi ce and those representing it as a form of divine justice, suggesting that the latter was a Deuterono mistic innovation.25 But there is no need to make such a distinction, in light of the fact that justice and sacrifi ce are not mutually exclusive cate gories. Sacrifi cial חרם could function as a form of capital punishment intent on establishing justice in the Israelite com-munity. Th e חרם of Deut 13 certainly embodies both elements. What is more, this chapter has demonstrated that sacrifi ce and execution can occur in a single slay-ing, such as when executing a murderer. Th ey do not necessarily follow separate trajectories in every occurrence, though they can function inde pendently. Nelson, by contrast, regarded the sacrifi cial imagery of Deut 13 (and Isa 34) as metaphorical , rejecting the perspective that חרם was a form of sacrifi ce in the Isra-elite cult. Th is interpretation was motivated in part by the view that חרם could not be considered a type of immolation because it was neither practiced at a shrine, nor upon an altar .26 First of all, this is a very limited view concerning the possible locations of sacrifi ce . Yes, sacrifi ce upon an altar was the primary method of animal immolation in the Israelite cult, but there are indications that sacrifi ces took place else where. David, for example, sacrifi ced two animals for every six steps taken by those carrying the ark of the covenant in its journey from Obed-Edom’s home to Jerusalem (2 Sam 6:13). Second, even if one wishes to limit sacrifi ce to a sanctuary, the immolation of Agag in fulfi ll ment of the חרם against the Amalekites took place in Yahweh’s presence at Gilgal, an early Israelite cultic locale. Moreover, one may plausibly argue that other forms of human sacrifi ce administered before Yahweh 23. BDB, 483, suggests that the two words occur as synonymous terms.24.

Th e signifi cance of the passage (Isa 52:13–53:12) justifi es its placement at the climax of this analysis, for here one most clearly encounters the concept of human immolation for the sake of expiation . Despite the problematic nature of the Hebrew text, several key verses may be rendered into English as follows (Isa 53:4–10):28Certainly our illnesses, he has lift ed up and our sorrows, he has borne; Nevertheless, we regarded him stricken [as with a dis ease], struck down by God, and made low.He was polluted due to our transgressions; crushed under the weight of our sins; Th e punishment for our well-being was on him and by his wounding, he was healed for us.All of us were as sheep that stray; each of us turning to his/her own way; But Yahweh caused the burden of all of our sin to be placed squarely upon him.He was pressed down and he was brought low under affl ic tion, but he did not open his mouth; As a sheep escorted to the slaughter and as a ewe in front of its shearers is quiet, he did not open his mouth. Out of coercion and judgment, he was taken; yet among his generation, who gave it any thought? For he was excluded from the land of the living; due to the iniquity of my people, a mark [of disease] was upon him.He established his grave among the guilty, though in his death he was among the wealthy; Despite the fact that he neither performed an act of vio lence , nor was deceit found in his mouth.27. Th e location of the sacrifi ce of Saul’s descendents is debatable, albeit intriguing. If one follows the lxx in contrast to the mt, then the sacrifi ce occurred at Gibeon instead of Gibeah. For its part, Gibeon functioned as a Yahwistic sanctuary during the early monar-chical period. Solomon, for instance, is found sacrifi cing there (1 Kgs 3:4). Slaying Saul’s progeny on a mountain affi liated with a Yahwistic sanctuary evokes the parallel imagery of sacrifi ces on Mount Zion.28. Th is translation follows the Masoretic Text closely, but given the damaged nature of the passage, the translation is not without some diffi culties.

In spite of such overwhelming pressure, the victim duti-fully bears the disease that is their sins. Such a process of transference in which the innocent victim bears (נשׂא) the iniquity of those providing the sacrifi ce (Isa 53:4, 12) is paralleled elsewhere in the Israelite cult by such practices as the scape goat ritual (Lev 16:22). In the absence of transference, the perpetrator is left to carry the weight alone, thereby facing divine judgment (Lev 19:8). In the current pas-sage under consideration, the vicarious victim does more than merely take upon himself the penalty of sin , for he facilitates the cleansing procedure by presenting himself as a guilt off ering (Isa 53:10), which in Hebrew is called שםׁא or what de Vaux categorized as a “sacrifi ce of reparation.”29 He succinctly surmised that “this sacrifi ce is only envisaged for individuals, and, consequently, the blood of the vic-tim is never carried into the Holy Place nor is the victim burnt outside the sanctu-ary. Moreover, the only victim mentioned is the ram. Finally this sacrifi ce has a fi ne added to it.”30 By equating the human victim to this type of guilt off ering , the author of this segment of Isaiah off ers that this instance of human sacrifi ce is done, as some have proposed, “in compensation for the sins of the people, interposing for them as their substitute.”31 Indeed, it is not the burden of his sins that he carries, but those of his people. Leviticus 5:17–19 illustrates one of the instances in which there was a need for an שםׁא sacrifi ce to be given:If a person when he sins by doing something from among all the com mandments of Yahweh which are not permitted to be done and does so out of ignorance, then he is guilty and he shall carry the punishment for his sin . He must bring in a blemish-free ram from the fl ock, in accordance with your appraisal, for a guilt-off ering to the priest , the priest will perform the atone ment over him on account of his sin done in ignorance, which he sinned but did not know, and he will be pardoned. Th at is the guilt-off ering for the one who is truly guilty against Ya h w e h .Here one encounters what de Vaux recognized, that is, that the emphasis of the sacrifi cial act was upon individual expiation . Isaiah 52–53, con versely, portrays the ritual as benefi cial to the entire Israelite nation.32 Given such a purpose, one would have expected the writer to have cho sen a more obvious parallel rite, namely, the 29.

Indeed, national cleansing by means of the blood mani pulation performed during sin off erings is alluded to already in Isa 52:15 by use of נזה (cf. Lev 16:14–15). Nevertheless, the author of Isaiah was purposeful in choosing to specify the type of sacrifi cial act envisioned by identifying it as a guilt off ering , which from a procedural standpoint had some correlation to the sin off ering (Lev 7:7; 14:13) but was distinct from it. Th e recurrent use of nominal or verbal deriva-tives of the root חלה in Isa 53:3, 4, and 10 may explain this choice, inasmuch as Isaiah’s victim not only carries the illnesses of the people of Israel, but becomes sickened by his contact with them. Hence, by taking upon him self the affl iction of his fellow Israelites, he suff ers along with them, which results in the need for both he and the people to be purifi ed. Th e guilt off ering played an important role in the purifi cation process of those affl icted by serious diseases of the skin once it was de-termined that the mark (נגע) of disease was no longer present (Lev 14).33 Isaiah 53 simi larly notes the presence of a physical mark on the victim like that present on a person affl icted with a skin disease (Isa 53:8; cf. 53:4). Indeed, de spite the damaged nature of verse 8, it indicates that the marred victim was excluded from the land of the living, thereby paralleling the way that so-called lepers were removed from the Israelite community. Th us, the sins of the Israelites contaminated the victim , mak-ing him analogous to a leper, which is why the guilt off ering was cited in the text. Th rough the act of sacrifi ce , the victim provides healing for himself and ultimately for the people. Th is would explain the otherwise odd appearance of the singular verb and plural prepositional phrase at the end of Isa 53:5 (“and by his wounding, he was healed for us”); otherwise, one might be com pelled to amend the verb to denote plurality (“and by his wounding, we were healed”), as other translations have done (nasb, rsv). A peculiarity of the use of this sacrifi cial victim is that he is marred and, there-fore, unworthy of sacrifi ce (compare Isa 52:14 to Lev 22:25). Yet it is arguable that the marring was part of the process of bearing the sin and not indicative of the victim’s state before the sacrifi cial procedure began and sin scarred him. Regard-less, the victim’s death clearly ad dressed the sins of his people. But this form of ritual, like Mic 6, is atypi cal for human immolation. One could argue that animals oft en function as vicarious victims in the Hebrew texts, for example, the ram in Gen 22,34 but humans typically do not. Given that rams were the main staple of the guilt off ering , Isa 53 takes the process of substitution embodied by Gen 22 one 33. Although explained as a foreign practice, 1 Sam 6 considers the guilt off ering an appropri ate means of nullifying the physical eff ects of the affl ictions faced by the Philis tines as a result of bringing the ark of the covenant into their territory. Such an understand ing, while not identical, is in no way antithetical to the manner in which the guilt off ering func-tions in Lev 14. Skin disease is described in several texts as a form of divine punishment (Num 12:9–15; Deut 24:8–9; 2 Chr 26:16–21).34. Consult, for instance, Gordon J.

Selman; Carlisle, England: Pater-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"47Tatlock: The Place of Human Sacrifice in the Israelite Cultstep further. Here the ram that was to stand in for human trans gressors is, itself, replaced by a vicarious victim , the so-called Suff ering Servant —a reversal of the process, if you will, or at least a deviation from it.Returning to the original point of departure, it is clear that Mic 6, when read alongside Isa 53, does not seem like such a signifi cant devia tion from the norm in terms of a human standing in to expiate for another, but child sacrifi ce is never clearly articulated in this way in other biblical texts, and human sacrifi ce , in general, is elsewhere con nected to the idea of atonement /purgation when it is the blood of the transgressors that is in demand. Innocent human blood , when ad dressed, has more of a contaminating than a cleansing eff ect, unlike the blood of unblemished animals, which is essential for the effi cacy of some immolations (Lev 4:32–35). Th is is admittedly a strange phenomenon in terms of the Israelite perspective on blood ; that is, innocent blood when spilled properly cleanses, whereas innocent blood poured out through acts of murder or unlawful sacrifi ce contaminates the land and dimi nishes its fertility. Th e matter is further complicated by the manner in which the contaminating eff ects of homicide were addressed, that is, by spill-ing the blood of the guilty murderer. In short, the manipulation of blood within the Israelite cult functioned according to a law of opposites: one form of blood counteracted the other. Given such a perception, it would make sense conceptu-ally for Micah to wonder about the legiti macy of off ering his child (an innocent victim ) for the sake of purifying his own depravity. Yet was such a statement an exaggeration, as some have supposed? Th e answer is complicated and consists of a “yes” and “no” response. His suggestion was an atypical reaction to sin according to the prevailing Yahwistic theology embodied by the Hebrew traditions, but some members of his audience may not have viewed the query as absurd. Indeed, it is conceivable and even likely that some of his con temporaries viewed child sacrifi ce as legitimate. Ezekiel , as discussed above, attempted to persuade his fellow Yah-wists to abandon fi rstborn immolation, and Micah may have engaged in a similar campaign. He certainly argues that the entire sacrifi cial system is inadequate as a means of pleasing the divine in contrast to more intangible spiritual practices such as humility, love, and justice. What is more, Micah did not use hyperbole by referencing an unknown type of sacrifi cial victim (child ren ), though he may have exaggerated concerning their function in a rite of expiation . Th e use of children as innocent sacrifi cial victims for the sake of expiation is not a biblical concept, but some Israelites may have felt diff erently—if so, such a view would certainly have corresponded in part to the prevailing standpoint that pure (animal) blood countered the eff ects of iniquity. Purging the Israelite community and territory of guilty men, women , and children in order to achieve divine blessing, however, was defi nitely in line with biblical theology.In examining the place of human sacrifi ce within the Israelite cult, the evidence compels me to conclude that it primarily functioned, especially for the Deuterono-mists, as a means of capital punishment through which the land and nation were noster Press; Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1995), 75–87.

Many diff erent rites achieved this end, such as the hanging of the de-scendents of Saul by the Gibeonites or the dispatching of the iniquitous priests by King Josiah ; yet, the most extensively promoted form was sacred warfare (חרם) by which entire populations were set apart for immolation, including their animals and possessions. Th e correspondence between human sacrifi ce and animal immo-lation is intriguing, inasmuch as nearly every kind of human sacrifi ce referenced in the Hebrew Bible has a parallel animal rite. Even in the case of homicide, an ani-mal could assist in providing purga tion should the identity of the ideal victim , that is, the murderer, be un known. While animals typically functioned as vicarious vic-tims , humans did not, which is why Isa 52–53 is a remarkable text.

In this debate, no consensus is yet in sight. Arguably, the time has come to move beyond this stalemate and develop new approaches to the study of the role of sacrifi ce in the pro phetic literature in the Hebrew Bible. New sets of questions need to be asked, and preferably from new angles. In addition, new methods need to be introduced. In this article, I will give a rough outline of one poten tially fruitful approach: the analysis of the rhetorical use of sacrifi cial lan-guage in the prophetic writings. Until now, a comprehensive study based on this approach has not appeared. In this article, I will give an outline of a research proj-ect which is only in its beginning. In addition, I will present a number of pre-liminary hypotheses connected to this project. Finally, two cases of metaphorical usage of sacrifi cial language will be discussed: a short note on Isa 66:20 is followed by a more exten sive analysis of Ezek 20:40–42. The Prophets and the Sacrificial Cult: Previous researchFrom the nineteenth century until now there has been an intense scholarly dis-cussion on the theme of sacrifi ce in the prophetic literature in the He brew Bible. Although this has generated a vast amount of monographs and articles, there may still be important areas that have not been suffi ciently explored. During more than one century, the debate has been dominated by historical questions, with a special emphasis on attempts to reconstruct the attitude of presumably preexilic prophets like Amos and Isaiah towards the sacrifi cial cult of their own time. As a consequence, the discussion has focused on a few passages which alleg-edly express a radical rejection of the sacrifi cial cult: for example, Amos 5:21–25; Hos 6:6; Isa 1:11–14; Jer 7:21–23. According to Wellhau sen—who anticipated Max Weber’s contrast between charismatic proph ets and traditional priests —the preexilic prophets simply condemned all contemporary sacrifi ces . However, the picture changed in the exilic pe riod. Ezekiel was, according to Wellhausen’s the-49"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"50Ritual and Metaphorory, the fi rst spokesman for an unequivocally positive attitude toward sacrifi ce . Wellhausen calls him a “priest in a prophet’s cloak.”1 More recent research has problema tized this simplifi ed view. Today, the cult-critical passages are usually seen as polemics addressing specifi c situations. Hence, they are not taken to imply a principal or general “no” to sacrifi ce as a part of worship.2 However, a scholarly consensus is not yet in sight. While some scholars regard the prophets as advocates of an internalized religiosity (Willi-Plein), as individuals critical against institu-tions (McKane), or even as being programmatic anti-ritualists (Hendel),3 others would downplay or challenge the Weberian oppositions prophet vs. priest and charisma vs. institution. Jonathan Klawans has suggested that priest s and prophets basically agreed on the principle that unethical behavior could invalidate sacrifi -cial gift s, making them unacceptable for yhwh. However, they tended to disagree quite strongly when it came to the practical applica tion of this principle.4 Yet other scholars have pointed out that it is uncer tain to what extent the texts in the pro-phetic books provide reliable information concerning the attitudes of an Isaiah in the eighth century b.c.e., or of a Jeremiah one century later. A text like Jer 7:21–23 would, for instance, seem to refl ect the opinion of postexilic polemists belong ing to (post-)deuteronomistic circles.5 Th e extensive discussion on the so-called cult-critical passages has almost ob-1.

Due to their apparently more positive stance towards the cult, some of the “minor” prophets —for example, Nahum , Habak-kuk , Haggai , and Malachi —have oft en been categorized as cult prophets or temple prophets .6 On the one hand, it would seem to make sense to speak about “cult prophets ” in ancient Israel and Judah, since the phenomenon of prophecy linked to temple cult is widely attested in the ancient Near East.7 On the other hand, the use of such a label as “cult prophets ” as a designation of a small group among the biblical prophets could imply that other prophets were some kind of “freelancers,” without any close connections to orga nized cult. Th is idea is probably anachro-nistic and infl uenced by cur rents within Western philosophy and Christian (espe-cially Protestant) theology. As regards research on cultically infl uenced language in the pro phetical litera-ture, previous studies have not focused on the rhetorical use of motifs and termi-nology drawn from the sacrifi cial cult.8 Th e book of Ezekiel would seem to pres-ent a special case, since it contains elabo rate visions and regulations concerning sacrifi cial cult in the restored temple (chs. 40–48). For this reason, monographs dealing with sacrifi ce in ancient Israel and Judah oft en include at least one chapter on Ezekiel .9 However, the rhetorical function of sacrifi cial language in other parts of this comprehensive and complex book still remains largely unexplored. Summing up, so far: It is time to move on. We need new ideas, new questions, new directions for research on the role of sacrifi ce in the pro phetical books. How-ever, perhaps needless to point out, the approach outlined here represents but one of many possibilities of studying these texts from new angles. 6.

By sacrifi cial lan guage I mean words and expressions that can be regarded as technical terms or central concepts within discourses on the sacrifi cial cult. My main interest lies in the use of such language in texts where sacrifi ce is not the main topic of the larger context. Hence, all metaphorical usage is of interest, since metaphor can be described as “that fi gure of speech whe reby we speak about one thing in terms which are seen to be suggestive of another.”11 How-ever, also cases of non-metaphorical use of sacrifi cial language will be included in this study, particularly cases where there are good reasons to assume that the prophet /author discussed sacrifi ce in order to make a point concerning something else than the proper per formance of a sacrifi cial ritual . Several exegetical methods will be combined in this work, but the main em-phasis lies on rhetorical analysis. Th is method, based on both classical and modern rhetorics, which focuses on the analysis of commu nicative, argumentative, and persuasive structures and strategies in oral speeches as well as in written texts, should not be confused with “rhe torical criticism” à la Muilenberg and his follow-ers within biblical stu dies—the latter essentially being a method for close reading, paying at tention to various stylistic devices in poetic texts.12Research QuestionsTh e following are my main questions to the textual material in the pro phetic literature: To what extent are words and expressions connected to the sacrifi cial cult used in passages dealing with other topics than sacrifi ce ? 10. Th is has been made possible by a generous grant from the Scientifi c Council of Swe-den (Vetenskapsrådet).11. Janet Soskice, Metaphor and Religious Language (Oxford: Clarendon, 1985), 15.

My main criti cism against Muilenburg’s “rhetorical criticism” is that this use of the term is potentially misleading, since his approach does not deal with such basic features of clas-sical and mod ern rhetoric as argumentation, persuasion, or the rhetorical situation. Th at “rhetorical criticism” à la Muilenburg, in a more developed form, can constitute the basis for brilliant exegetical studies has been demonstrated by Phyllis Trible in her book Rhetori-cal Criticism: Context, Method, and the Book of Jonah (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1994)."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"53Eidevall: The Role of Sacrificial Language in Prophetic RhetoricIn which specifi c contexts is sacrifi cial language used?How can the rhetorical purpose of bringing sacrifi cial language into a discourse which primarily deals with some other topic be defi ned in each case? To what extent can the rhetorical situation(s) be reconstructed? Which sacrifi cial terms and expressions are used for which pur-poses?

Preliminary HypothesesTh e following hypotheses are preliminary and provisional, formulated before any extensive textual analysis has yet been conducted. I am pre pared to revise them, or even to abandon some of them, if they prove inadequate. Nevertheless, I believe it is fruitful to formulate such hypo theses.In ancient Israel and Judah (at least until the exilic period), sacri fi ce was an integral part of worship. It is unlikely that prophets or oth-ers would conceive of a religion, or a human-divine rela tion, with-out sacrifi ce. On the contrary, one might expect that sa crifi cial rites constituted an important matrix for religious lan guage and thought. Hence, I expect that an analysis of all relevant texts within the pro-phetic literature will show that sacri fi ce is consistently viewed as being of vital importance within the interaction between human be-ings and the divine sphere.If the aforementioned hypothesis is correct, the rhetorical analy sis of how and why sacrifi cial language is used will possibly in dicate that some of the so-called cult-critical passages in the pro phetic writings actually refl ect or presuppose a basically positive view of sacrifi ce"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"54Ritual and Metaphoras an essential means for communication with the divine. Granted that the off ering of sacrifi ces was commonly regarded as a way of pleasing or appeasing the deity—and that this notion was shared by prophet and addressees—a declara tion that yhwh does not accept their sacrifi ces would make sense as a rhetorical climax within a pro-phetic diatribe against a certain group, at a certain time.It is unlikely that the results of the investigation will form a sin gle, unifi ed pattern. It is rather to be expected that diff erent tra ditions and diff erent subgenres within the prophetic literature use sacrifi cial language in strongly divergent ways. For instance, metaphors may be constructed out of diff erent sacrifi cial rites—or based on diff erent parts of a certain ritual. In addition, the rhetorical purpose may vary from one text to another. Texts from the exilic period will probably tend to relativize the value of actual sacrifi cial gift s, in a higher degree than preexilic and postexilic texts (to the extent that dating of the texts is possible). It is likely that the tendency to “spiritualize ” the sacrifi cial cult originated during the exile. However, the process of spiritualization is not nec-essarily based on a depreciation of sa crifi ce. On the contrary, such a process would seem to presup pose that there already existed a con-ceptual link between “exter nal,” material sacrifi ces on the one hand and “inner” spirituality on the other hand. A Preliminary SurveyA fi rst survey of the prophetic literature, mapping out the most relevant passages, resulted in an emerging pattern. I found that sacrifi cial lan guage is primarily used in discourses dealing with the following topics:A. Th e defeat of hostile nations (within oracles against other nations)B. Critique against political and religious leadersC. Th e future restoration of Jerusalem and the Temple D. Visions of a future when foreigners will worship yhwhRegarding A and B, I will only off er some very brief comments below. Th e discus-sion of category D will include a short note on Isa 66:20, while category C will be illustrated by a more detailed analysis of Ezek 20:40–42.A.

It is therefore hardly surprising that some prophetic passages use terms drawn from the domain of sacrifi ce when describing the defeat of hostile armies. Th is kind of metaphorical language, which will be analyzed in a planned forthcoming study, is found in each of the three major prophetic books in the Hebrew Bible (Isa 34:6–7; Jer 46:10–12; and Ezek 39:17–20).13B. Th e role of sacrifi cial rhetoric within critique against political and religious leadersSeveral of those passages that are sometimes taken as evidence that the preex-ilic prophets rejected all kinds of sacrifi cial cult (e.g., Isa 1:11–17; Jer 7:21–26; 14:11–12; Hos 8:11–13; Amos 5:21–24) have, in my opinion, one important thing in common: they occur within discourses where the main topic is something else than sacrifi ce. As a rule, they are parts of a polemical discourse directed against contemporary political and reli gious leaders. As I hope to be able to demonstrate in a forthcoming study, a number of these passages are critical against institutions and leaders, or even against a whole people, but not against sacrifi ce per se. C. Sacrifi cial rhetoric in visions of the restoration of Jerusalem Prophetic depictions of the return from exile and the restoration of Jerusa lem sometimes include visions of the rebuilt temple , a temple where the sacrifi ces of-fered by the priests will please yhwh. By far the most elaborate visions of this kind are found in the book of Ezekiel (in the chapters 40–48, but also elsewhere). Although the temple is not expli citly mentioned, Ezek 20:40–42 can be seen as one such passage. An analy sis of this passage, focusing on an expression in v. 41, will be off ered below. Th e analysis will demonstrate that sacrifi cial language could be used metaphorically in such visions, in order to highlight some aspect of the prefi gured restoration.D. Sacrifi cial rhetoric in visions of a future when foreigners will worship yhwh: With a short note on Isa 66:20A number of postexilic passages in the prophetic literature envisage the future pilgrimage of all the nations to Zion (e.g., Isa 2:2–3; Zech 14:16–19). Sometimes foreigners are even described as worshiping yhwh with sacrifi ces (Isa 19:21; Zeph 3:10; Mal 1:11; cf. also Jon 1:16). In Isa 66:18–21, several motifs have been combined in a peculiar way. Probably, the reader’s impression that the order of envisioned events is not entirely logical is to some extent due to the insertion of later addi tions.14 In its fi nal stage of edition, 13. On Isa 34:6–7 (as part of 34:1–17), see Göran Eidevall, Prophecy and Propaganda: Images of Enemies in the Book of Isaiah (ConBOT 56; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2009), 150–57.14. Possibly, v. 20 represents such an insertion. Th us Claus Westermann, Isaiah 40–66 (trans. David Stalker; OTL; London: SCM, 1969), 427–28, and Joseph Blenkinsopp, Isaiah 56–66: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (AB 19B; New York: Double-day, 2003), 315."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"56Ritual and Metaphorthe passage can be summarized as follows: Th ose among the nations who survived yhwh’s punishment (66:15–16) will be gathered (v. 18), but only in order to be sent out as missionaries to even more distant places (v. 19). Finally, the task of these surviving foreigners will be to bring all the dispersed Jews back to Jeru salem (v. 20). Th e ensuing brief discussion will focus on v. 20, which contains an unusual and intriguing sacrifi cial metaphor : Th ey shall bring all your kindred from all the nations as an off ering to the Lord, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dro medaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem , says the Lord, just as the Israe lites bring a grain off ering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord. (Isa 66:20 nrsv)In v. 20a, the returning Israelites are portrayed as a gift presented to yhwh, מנחה ליהוה. Th is expression does not necessarily carry cultic con notations. Th e idea could rather be that the foreigners are going to pay tribute to yhwh, as a token of their recognition that he is their true overlord.15 However, the reference of מנחה becomes overtly cultic and sacrifi cial in v. 20b. From a rhetorical point of view, the repeated use of the word מנחה is of crucial importance. First of all, it creates a link between two meta phors , bringing them into a process of interaction. As a result, one may speak of a case of multilayered imagery , a kind of double exposure, since the metaphorical tribute brought by the foreigners is now metaphori cally compared to a sacrifi ce off ered by Israelites. Th e non-Israelites are portrayed as loyal servants of yhwh, and, at the same time, the returning Israelites are pictured as extremely precious in the eyes of their God, since they are compared to a cultic מנחה.16 Which are the fur ther implications of this metaphor ? To begin with, it is important to note that מנחה denotes a cereal off ering , a vegetal sacrifi ce . Due to the charac ter of the cereal off ering , all notions of blood or death are absent from this sacrifi cial metaphor . Th ere is no victim in this image . Th ere is no threat at all, only joy and communion . Moreover, just like in the sacrifi cial metaphor in Ezek 20:41 (see below), one may note that a rever-sal of roles is taking place. Th e faithful worshipers are themselves depicted as the gift off ered to the deity. However, in this picturesque and almost idyllic descrip-tion of a caravan with chariots and animals, the shift of roles is taken one step further. Th ose who bring the valuable off ering to yhwh are foreigners, and the means of transport provided by them are likened to pure vessels fi lled with grain that are brought to the Temple . Th us, this singular vision includes a depiction of non-Israelites bringing a pure and acceptable (albeit metaphorical ) sacrifi ce to the God of Israel.17 If the primary addressees of this utterance were the inhabitants 15.

According to Alfred Marx, Les off randes végétales dans l’Ancien Testament: Du tribut d’hommage au repas eschatologique (VTSup 57; Leiden: Brill, 1994), 139–49 (quote on 139), the vegetal off ering is accorded the role of “sacrifi ce par excellence” within the sacrifi cial sys-tem of P. Since Isa 66:20 is postexilic, I fi nd it likely that it expresses a similarly high es teem of vegetal off erings .17. Th e vision in Isa 66:20 can be regarded as radical, in comparison with the attitude"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"57Eidevall: The Role of Sacrificial Language in Prophetic Rhetoricof Jerusalem , its main rhetorical function would seem to be to promote a univer-sal outlook in general (acknowledging the role of non-Israelites, especially those who acknowledge the supremacy of yhwh) and, more specifi cally, to generate a positive attitude toward returning Israelites (since these are welcomed by yhwh himself as if they were a precious gift or off ering ). Analysis of Ezekiel 20:40–42It is likely, as will be shown, that Ezek 20:41 contains a sacrifi cial meta phor , which in some respects can be termed unique. Th is utterance is part of a rhetorical sub-unit comprising vv. 40–42 in Ezek 20:40 For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord God, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land; there I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gift s, with all your sacred things. 41 As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will manifest my holi ness among you in the sight of the nations. 42 You shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country that I swore to give to your ancestors. (nrsv)In the subsequent analysis, Ezek 20:40–42 will be treated as part of a larger rhe-torical discourse, comprising the whole of chapter 20.18 On a closer examination, this chapter consists of two main sections. While vv. 1–31 can be regarded as a self-contained unit, beginning and ending with the topic of consulting or ques-tioning (דרשׁ) yhwh, the section com prising vv. 32–44 looks like an expansion of 1–31. Both sections contain features characteristic of a disputation speech, but whereas the fi rst sec tion is mainly retrospective, describing Israel’s past as a his-tory of sin and apostasy, the ensuing section (vv. 32–44) is oriented toward the future—a future holding the prospect of both judgment and restoration. Sacrifi ce is by no means the main topic of Ezek 20, but sacrifi cial rites are mentioned toward the end of each of the two main sections. In vv. 26–31, reference is made to various practices that are seen as illicit and ab horrent: off erings presented to other gods (v. 28) and child sacrifi ces (vv. 26, 31). Th e depiction in vv. 40–42 can be seen as a deliberate contrast, involving reversals of the situation depicted previously.19 Note, to ward foreigners displayed in many other texts in the Hebrew Bible. However, within its immediate context, v. 20 rather seems to reduce the radicalness of a vision entailing the possibility that foreigners become Levites and priests (v. 21). Th us Blenkinsopp, Isaiah 56–66, 315: “Th e interpolated v 20 off ers a solution more acceptable to the traditionally-minded by limiting the liturgical function of Gentiles to providing sacrifi cial material: their minh.â consists in repatriated Israelites, for whom they provide every conceivable form of trans portation, while Israelites alone off er the real cereal off ering (and the other off erings ), and do so in keeping with the laws of ritual purity.” 18. As regards the structure and composition of chapter 20, see further Walther Zim-merli, Ezekiel 1 (trans. Ronald E. Clements; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1979), 404–17. 19. Cf.

Both an exilic and a postexilic dating is conceiv-able.21 However, since the addressees seem to live in exile or diaspora, it is possible to construe the primary rhetorical purpose of the passage in the following way: Th ose who are dispersed among the nations are encouraged to return to Jerusa-lem .22 In order to achieve this goal, the oracle confi rms that they constitute the true Israel and an nounces that aft er divine punishment and rejection the time has come for repatriation and restoration. It is possible, but far from certain, that Ezek 20:41 contains a unique sa crifi cial metaphor , speaking of human beings in terms of the characteris tic smell arising from burnt off erings . What we can establish beyond reasonable doubt is that it is stated that yhwh will “accept” (or “like” or “be pleased by”) those who return from the diaspora. Th is is said twice in vv. 40–41. Indeed, this declaration of divine ac-ceptance and satisfaction could be seen as the main theme of this short passage.23 Th e verb used (in both v. 40 and 41) is רצה, a verb that appears to have been used as a technical term for priestly and/or divine acceptance within the sacrifi cial cult.24 However, in Ezek 20:40–41, the prophet /author does not deliver a declaration that yhwh accepts/rejects the sacrifi ce s brought by “the house of Israel.” Th e message is that the deity is willing to accept the returning worshipers themselves. In v. 40, ארצם שׁם, “there I will accept them,” can hardly refer to sacrifi ces mentioned later. And in v. 41, the phrase אתכם ארצה, “I will accept you,” is even more straightfor-ward. In v. 41 it is stated, quite unambiguously, that those who will be accepted are the addressees themselves, not merely or primarily the gift s they are bringing. But how to interpret the opening words of v. 41? What do they mean? Th e opening phrase אתכם ארצה ניחח בריח, “in a soothing smell I will accept you,” 656–57.20.

One might perhaps add: and to refrain from performing sacrifi cial rituals until they have reached the Temple in Jerusalem . Th is is how the aim of this passage was formulated in the commentary of Walther Eichrodt, Ezekiel: A Commentary (trans. C. Quinn; OTL; Philadel phia: Westminster, 1970), 282: “God is trying to win them over in a friendly fash-ion, he is showing them that what they must do is to postpone worship till it can be per-formed in the proper place, created by God, and how to do precisely that is the one sure way of putting an end to all the remoteness from God from which they are suff ering.”23.

As pointed out by Christian Eberhart, the expression ניחח ריח, “a soothing smell,” is employed as a technical term in the book of Leviti-cus , a term which “al ludes to the smoke of the sacrifi ce that ascends to heaven,” and which “also conveys the anthropomorphic idea that God actually smells this smoke.”25 It should be noted, though, that the formula ניחח ריח is rather rare in Ezekiel . It occurs only four times in this book, and in none of these cases does it serve as a strictly technical term, connected to the cult of yhwh. Th ree times (Ezek 6:13; 16:19; 20:28) it is used in descriptions of the people’s attempt to please other gods, or idols, with their off erings . Th us, 20:41 represents the only attestation in this prophetic book that associates ניחח ריח with yhwh. In Ezek 20:41, the interpretative diffi culty is twofold: to understand the func-tion of the preposition bĕ in the expression ניחח בריח, and to assess the function of this expression within the utterance. One possibil ity is that bĕ should be taken as an instance of ב pretii. In that case, the expression refers quite literally to the pleas-ant smell arising from the burnt off ering s brought by the returnees, and the divine approval is de scribed as an eff ect brought about by their sacrifi ces.26 One might then paraphrase: “When I notice a soothing smell [from your burnt off erings ], then I will accept you.” But is it reasonable to assume that the deity’s satisfaction here is seen as somehow causally connected to the off ering of sacrifi cial gift s ? Th at idea could fi nd support in Ezek 43:27, where the declaration of acceptance follows upon an enumeration of sacrifi ces , and perhaps also in the circumstance that 20:41 is preceded by v. 40, with its mention of sacrifi cial gift s (tĕrûmôt and maś’ôt).27However, such a causal link between sacrifi ces and divine approval is not made explicit in the passage Ezek 20:40–42. Moreover, there are no hints in that direc-tion in the immediate literary context. Instead of men tioning any actions from the people, or implying that they somehow deserve divine favor, the remainder of v. 41 focuses entirely on the ac tions of yhwh who will bring his people back home, in order to demon strate his power to all the nations where they had been scat-tered. Th e restoration is described as yhwh’s work. His worshipers are above all 25. Christian Eberhart, “A Neglected Feature of Sacrifi ce in the Hebrew Bible: Remarks on the Burning Rite on the Altar,” HTR 97, no. 4 (2004): 485–93, quote on 490. Eberhart adds the following insightful comment: “Th is is the way the biblical God is thought to re-ceive the sacrifi ce.” 26. Such an interpretation is advocated by several commentators. See, for example, Moshe Green berg, Ezekiel 1–20 (Anchor Bible 22; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983), 375, and John W. Wevers, Ezekiel (Th e Century Bible; London: Nelson, 1969), 160–61. Th e lat-ter comments on v. 41 as follows (on p. 160): “What the traditionalist is saying is that by means of sacrifi ce Yahweh accepts his people; the author speaks from a purely priestly point of view.”27. Both persons and off erings can be the object of the verb רצה, but in a majority of the cases God is the subject. Cf. Hossfeld, “רצה.” In 2 Sam 24:23, the expression ירצך refers to David. Th e underlying logic of that passage would seem to be that by means of sacrifi ces David could win divine acceptance and benevolence for himself."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"60Ritual and Metaphorexpected to respond to it in a proper way (v. 42). Furthermore, in v. 44 it is plainly stated that yhwh is restoring the house of Israel, despite their behavior.An alternative line of interpretation, which I fi nd more likely, takes the ex-pression ניחח בריח in v. 41 metaphorically . One may then translate “as a soothing smell” (cf. nrsv: “as a pleasing odor”).28 Such a transla tion does not require an emendation, reading kĕ instead of bĕ, since this could be taken as a case of ב es-sentiae.29 According to such an understand ing of the opening phrase of v. 41, the Israelites are likened to a sacrifi ce that pleases yhwh. How can the most important implications of this metaphorical depiction be spelled out? On the assumption that v. 41 contains a sacrifi cial metaphor , the fo cus of this utterance lies primarily on divine satisfaction, on the pleasure that the act of gath-ering the dispersed people and welcoming them home again gives to yhwh. Th eir presence on Mount Zion is what counts, their presence is enough to incite im-mense joy and satisfaction, metaphori cally comparable to the satisfaction pro-duced by that particularly sooth ing smell which emanates from burnt sacrifi ces . Th e rhetorical strategy of this passage could then be described as involving a shift of roles: those who bring the off erings have taken the place of the sacrifi cial gift , so to speak. Th ey are themselves being brought to yhwh, who reacts as if the fat of animals had been burnt on the altar . Th is metaphor could perhaps be taken as sup-port for theories regarding sacrifi ce as a substi tute for the person who brings it to the deity. In this case, moreover, the underlying thought would seem to be that the deity arranges a sacrifi ce in order to please and appease himself. At any rate, the idea that the worshipers rather than their gift s are the primary object of yhwh’s ac ceptance (or disliking) appears to be characteristic for the theological outlook of the book of Ezekiel . We fi nd it also in 43:27. Th ere is occasionally also another side, a darker side, of sacrifi cial metaphors : an inherent element of violence, the role of the victim whose destiny it is to be ritu-ally killed. In Ezek 20:41, these potentially disturb ing aspects appear to have been suppressed. However, it should be re membered that the soothing smell was al-ways the result of a process involving fi re . Inevitably, such associations are evoked. Hence, this re mains an open question, an unspoken subtext, in the interpretation of Ezek 20:41 (if it is interpreted metaphorically ): What was burnt? Who or what was sacrifi ced , in order to produce the aroma that could please yhwh? Th ose who never got the chance to return? On a rather specula tive note, one might spell out the subtext in the following way: Aft er all disasters, only these scattered groups of loyal worshipers remain. In a (metaphorical ) manner of speaking, they are return-ing from the fi re to Jerusalem . Th eir return is going to fi ll yhwh with joy. Hence, the mes sage conveyed to the (perhaps not enthusiastic) inhabitants of Jerusalem is clear: You are also supposed to rejoice on the day of their homecom ing.28. Several other modern translations concur with the choice made by nrsv, that is, to inter pret this as a metaphorical utterance. See, for example, the nab (“As a pleasing odor I will accept you”), niv (“I will accept you as a fragrant incense”), and njb (“I shall welcome you like a pleasing smell”).29. Cf. Zimmerli, Ezekiel, 417."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"61Eidevall: The Role of Sacrificial Language in Prophetic RhetoricSummary To begin with, it was demonstrated that previous research on sacrifi ce in the pro-phetical literature in the Hebrew Bible has been dominated by historical questions, with a special emphasis on attempts to reconstruct the attitude of the “classical” prophets of doom toward the contempo rary sacrifi cial cult. While this debate has led to a stalemate, other as pects of the role of sacrifi ce in the prophetical books have been neglected. One potentially fruitful approach was outlined. Drawing on rhetorical analysis and metaphor theory, it focuses on the rhetorical purpose of bringing sacrifi cial language into a discourse which primarily deals with some other topic. Finally, this approach was illustrated by preliminary analyses of two passages where homecoming from diaspora is depicted by means of sacrifi cial metaphors : Isa 66:20 and Ezek 20:40–42. Whereas the metaphor in Isa 66:20 casts non-Israelites in the role of wor shipers bringing pure off erings (= the returning Jews) to yhwh, the meta phor in Ezek 20:41 focuses on the returning Israelites, likening them to a soothing smell arising from burnt sacrifi ces . Although the em-phasis of the latter metaphor lies on the divine joy caused by the event, one may also discern a suppressed subtext speaking of human suff ering."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Pa rt 2Sacrifice in Early Christian Literature"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"5Yom Kippuring Passover :Recombinant Sacrifice in Early ChristianityJeff rey S. SikerTh e greatest theological diffi culty that the earliest followers of Jesus had to explain was how this seemingly messianic fi gure could suff er and die at the hands of the Romans , particularly—and ironically—in light of the conviction that God had raised this same crucifi ed Jesus from the dead. In order to explain this unexpected set of events, the earliest post-Easter followers of Jesus turned fi rst and foremost to a reinterpretation of their scriptures. However, they also began a creative pro-cess of retrospective theologizing through a kind of recombinant ritualizing—tak-ing the vari ous Jewish liturgical celebrations and recalibrating their meaning to ac commodate their growing faith convictions about Jesus as the risen Lord and Savior.1 My goal here is to explore how early Christians blended language from Yom Kippur and Passover that both blurred and rede fi ned the meaning of these central ritual observances, so that Jesus came to be understood as sacrifi cial lamb and scapegoat at the same time. In this way the early Christians engaged in a pro-cess of Yom Kippuring Passover . Adjusting to a Crucified and Risen MessiahA glance at the general movement from pre-Easter to post-Easter beliefs about Jesus will help to highlight the framework of how early Christians retrospectively theologized to make sense of their experiences. Th ere were basically three stages to this process: 1. During his life Jesus was viewed in messianic terms because of his powerful proclamation of the kingdom of God in word and deed.1. See P. Bradshaw, Th e Search for the Origins of Early Christian Worship: Sources and Methods for the Study of Early Liturgy (2nd ed.; New York: Oxford University Press, 1992, 2002).65"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"66Ritual and Metaphor2. But then something went terribly wrong—he died. He was a failed messiah. As the disciples on the road to Emmaus put it in Luke 24:21: “We had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.” But they no longer hoped for this since Jesus had been put to death. Another prophet killed.3. But then the followers of Jesus came to believe that they had expe-rienced something they could scarcely believe—Jesus had been raised from the dead. So Jesus was not a failed messiah aft er all, rather he was a crucifi ed and risen messiah, a messianic fi gure they had never anticipated. Nothing had prepared them for this. And so the reinterpretive process began in earnest. As the earliest Christians began the long process of theologizing about this cruci-fi ed and risen messiah, a process that continues to the present, they turned im-mediately to two fundamental sources for theological refl ection in order to make sense of this rather unexpected series of events—their Jewish scriptures and their liturgical life together, espe cially as it revolved around the sacrifi cial cult of the Je-rusalem Temple . Th eir belief in Jesus as the crucifi ed, risen, and glorifi ed messiah led them to a complete rereading of their scriptures, so that the sacred story of Is-rael now culminated in the coming of Jesus as dying and rising sa vior. Both generic assertions of scriptural fulfi llment (as in Luke 24:27, 44) and specifi c proof-texts of such fulfi llment became increasingly sig nifi cant. Early Christian use of Isa 53 for understanding Jesus ’ death in terms of the Suff ering Servant and Ps 110 for under-standing God’s rais ing Jesus from the dead come especially to mind.2 Beyond the scriptures, however, the living practices of the sacrifi cial cult were also completely reinscribed so that the true meaning of the sacred festivals was now understood anew in light of the story of Jesus . Th ese kinds of retrospec tive theologizing hap-pened quickly, varied across early Christian com munities, and were widespread in early Christian tradition.3 Biblical scholars have always been good at showing how biblical texts were re-appropriated by early Christians. We have not, however, always been so good at seeing how the ritual practices of sacrifi ce in the Jerusalem Temple were redefi ned in parallel ways. Indeed, I would ar gue that such reinterpretations of ritual oft en had as powerful an expla natory impact upon early Christians as did rereadings of scripture. Th is is particularly the case since Christians sought through their wor-2. For Isa 53, see, for example, John 12:38; Rom 10:16; Matt 8:17; 1 Pet 2:24–25; Acts 8:32. See also W. H.

How might Jesus be understood in relation to the Jerusalem Temple and the sacrifi cial cult? How did the blending and reinterpreta-tion of the two most important ritual festivals in early Judaism, Passover and Yom Kippur , contribute to the under standing of Jesus as the perfect sacrifi ce in the pro-cess of Christian theolo gizing about the signifi cance of the death of Jesus ? In order to demonstrate what I would refer to as “recombinant sacri fi ce ” (to borrow an image from work in the biological sciences on recombi nant DNA)4 I will look at texts from Paul and John that illustrate some aspects of how this pro-cess developed. Passover and Yom Kippur in PaulWe begin with two passages from Paul, 1 Cor 5:7 and 2 Cor 5:21. Th e passage from 1 Cor 5:7 invokes Passover , while the passage from 2 Cor 5:21 invokes imagery as-sociated with Yom Kippur . In 1 Cor 5:6–8 Paul chastises the Corinthians for allow-ing immorality into the community, since it will function as leaven that will grow and fester to bring moral corruption to the whole community. He admonishes them to “cleanse out the old leaven,” drawing directly on the Passover image of getting rid of all leavening agents in preparation for the feast . Th e metaphor of “old leaven” refers to the Corinthians’ former immoral ways of living (5:1). But now in Christ they are cleansed of the old immoral leaven and hence are unleavened, morally redeemed. But they need to act that way. Th e Corinthians should be as un-leavened bread appropriate for the Pass over celebration. For Christians, however, Passover has taken on new meaning in light of Christ’s death. Th us Paul declares, “For our pa schal lamb, Christ, has been sacrifi ced ” (γὰρ τὸ πάσχα ἡμῶν ἐτύθη Χριστός), “therefore, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (ὥστε ἑορτάζωμεν μὴ ἐν ζύμῃ παλαιᾷ μηδὲ ἐν ζύμῃ κακίας καὶ πονηρίας ἀλλ’ ἐν ἀζύμοις εἰλικρινείας καὶ ἀληθείας; 1 Cor 5:7–8). Th is is the only place in the Pauline cor-pus that we fi nd direct reference to the Passover . Paul expli citly states that Christ is the Passover sacrifi ce ; he is the true meaning of Passover . Th ere is not really any development beyond this simple refer ence to Christ as the Passover sacrifi ce, but it remains signifi cant that Paul can invoke Passover imagery to call attention to the purifying charac ter of Christ’s sacrifi cial death, which in turn serves to call the Corinthians themselves to moral purity.5Although Paul does not develop this metaphor at any length, there are several 4.

Synthetic “human” insulin used in the treatment of diabetes is one example of a product derived from recombinant DNA. See J. D. Watson et al., Recombinant DNA: A Short Course (New York: W. H. Freeman, 1992).5. As noted by Judith Kovacs, the expression from 1 Cor 5:7–8 (“Christ our Passover has been sacrifi ced; therefore let us keep the feast ”) has been used since early Christian times in the Eucharist (J. Kovacs, trans. and ed., 1 Corinthians Interpreted by Early Christian Commenta tors [ed. R. Wilken; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2005], 82–85)."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68Ritual and Metaphorobservations that we can infer from his reference to Christ as the Passover sacri-fi ce . First, the largely Gentile Corinthian Christians clearly are familiar with the Jewish observance of Passover . Perhaps they know of the festival and the ritual aspects associated with it in the Jeru salem Temple from what the Jewish scriptures spell out (e.g., Exod 12:21). More likely, they know about the observance of Pass-over in the Diaspora from the practice of the Jews in Corinth. While we do not know a great deal about the observance of Passover in the Jewish Diaspora, we do know that Passover was widely observed and that many Jews made pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the celebration of Passover .6 Second, per haps there is merit to C. K. Barrett’s suggestion that the Passover imagery occurred to Paul because at the time of writing 1 Corinthians he was preparing for, or celebrating, the season of Passover .7 In 1 Cor 16:8 Paul states that he “will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost.” Since the observance of Passover is several weeks earlier, Paul may well have been writing at a time in close proximity to the Passover festival. Th ird, the reference to Christ as the Passover sacrifi ce indicates a Christian appro priation of Passover imagery and its application to the death of Jesus , an application that Paul appar-ently does not need to explain. As Passover was a time to celebrate God’s deliver-ance of God’s people from bondage in Egypt , so by extension did Passover now refer to a diff erent kind of deliverance of God’s people in Christ from bondage to sin , hence the appropriation of the imagery of ridding themselves of the leaven-ing agent of sin , which could corrupt the larger community. Did Paul lead the Corinthian Christians in a continuation of the observance of Pass over , now with a new meaning supplied by the saving death of Jesus ? Did the Jewish Chris tians in Corinth (if we trust Acts 18:8, 17) continue to engage in the ritual observance of Passover ? While such a considera tion is speculative at best, Paul’s reference to Christ as the Passover sacri fi ce raises various possibilities and even more ques-tions. Was the Chris tian Eucharist inter preted already in Corinth as a new kind of Passover ? Were associations drawn between Passover and the taking away of sin ? Th is latter question is signifi cant, in that typically Passover was not a festival associated with forgiveness of sin .8 But Paul appears at least obli quely to import the no tion of doing away with sin , an idea inherent to the meaning of Yom Kip-pur , into a Passover rendering of Jesus as the sacrifi cial lamb . Th us in 1 Cor 5:6–8 we may be seeing a kind of recombinant ritualizing in the process of formation 6. Philo of Alexandria engages in signifi cant allegorization of Passover , but he appears to have celebrated the Passover even as he sought deeper meanings in its rituals. See, for ex-ample, Spec. Laws 2.145–147; Heir, 192; Migration, 25; Sacrifi ces, 112. See the discussion of Philo , and a comparison of Philo’s approach to Passover with that of Josephus, in F. Colauti, Passover in the Works of Josephus (Leiden: Brill, 2002), 169–74.

Whether Paul intended such associa tions, or whether any of the Corin thian Christians would have recog nized the echoes of Yom Kippur now resonating with Passover imagery, is, of course, impossible to know. Th at Paul can and did use not only Jewish scriptures, but also Jewish litur gical associations, in his explica tion of the signifi cance of Christ’s death, however, seems apparent, espe cially when we turn to the next passage, 2 Cor 5:21.In 2 Cor 5:21 we come upon language that suggests the Yom Kippur observance more directly, in which Jesus as one unblemished by sin , and hence suitable as a ritual sacrifi ce , takes on the marks of sin “for our sake” (ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν), and so both brings about reconciliation with God and manifests the righteousness of God in the believer. “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin , so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (τὸν μὴ γνόντα ἁμαρτίαν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἁμαρτίαν ἐποίησεν, ἵνα ἡμεῖς γενώμεθα δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ, 2 Cor 5:21). As various scholars have noted, this language brings to mind the metaphor of the Yom Kippur scapegoat from Lev 16 who bears away sins.9 At the very least, as V. P. Furnish notes, “the summary affi rmation in 5:21 represents a Pauline reworking of tradition, probably Jewish-Christian theological notions.”10 Th e unblemished scapegoat takes on the ble mishes of human sin . What I fi nd signifi cant in both this Yom Kippur scapegoat image and in the Passover image from 1 Cor 5 is the ease with which Paul works this ritual language into his discussion. Th is is all the more remarkable given that Paul uses these Jewish sacrifi cial images while addressing a Christian community that appears to be pri marily Gentile in makeup. It suggests that fairly early on in Paul’s dealings with the Corinthians he introduced the im-portant symbolic worlds of Passover and Yom Kippur and how they functioned, like scripture, to point to Jesus in new ways as the true paschal lamb, as well as the true scapegoat who has borne sins away. At the very least Paul uses the Jew-ish rituals associated with Passover and Yom Kippur as a canvas for highlighting the signifi cance of the crucifi ed and risen Jesus . Further, it would be diffi cult to imagine that Paul was not familiar with the original Passover context of the Lord’s Supper , and that this ritual context was part of what he had received, and which he also passed on to the Corinthians (1 Cor 11:23–26).One further Pauline passage warrants attention, as it is the most sig nifi cant text in Paul that draws directly on the Yom Kippur observance, with perhaps a hint of Passover imagery as well. Th e passage in ques tion, of course, is the wonder-fully thick Rom 3:21–26. Several aspects of this passage call for comment. First, we encounter the use of the term ἱλαστήριον in Rom 3:25 in reference to Christ, “whom God put forward as a sacrifi ce of atonement [ἱλαστήριον] by his blood , eff ective through faith.” Th is reference to ἱλαστήριον calls to mind the use of this term in the Yom Kippur ritual from the Septuagint version of Lev 16:13–15. In that context the term refers to the mercy seat that covered the ark of the covenant 9. See S. Finlan, Options on Atonement in Christian Th ought (Collegeville, MN: Liturgi-cal Press, 2007), 22–23. 10. V. P.

Th e cross thus becomes the “place of atonement ,” and Jesus functions as the “sacrifi ce of atonement ” (nrsv, niv) or “expiation ” for sin (nab). Just as the blood of the bull and the goat cleanse the mercy seat and the altar of all sin and pollution (Lev 16:15–20), in essence re newing the Temple for its sacrifi cial service in accordance with the levitical prescriptions, so for Paul the blood of Jesus wipes clean the sins of those who believe in the salvifi c signifi cance of his death and resurrec tion. Paul’s language here is anything but precise, but the imagery is nonetheless clear. He interprets the death of Jesus as a sacrifi cial death that atones for sin by means of blood , comparable to the Temple sacri fi ce s and rituals associated with Yom Kippur . Second, it is important to remind ourselves that the observance of Yom Kippur according to Leviticus involved a two-part ritual. Th e fi rst part dealt with the mak-ing atonement for, or cleansing, both the high priest and the sanctuary in which the high priest served. As Lev 16:15–16 stipulates, the high priest shall slaughter the goat of the sin off ering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the curtain, and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat . Th us he shall make atonement for the sanctuary, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel, and because of their transgressions, all their sins; and so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which remains with them in the midst of their un cleannesses.Th e second part of the observance, however, dealt not with cleansing the buildup of sin from the year’s worth of sacrifi ces in the sanctuary, but with removing the sins of the people so that they might have a clean slate, as it were, and with this renewed status strive for a life in keeping with God’s covenant faithfulness, a life unblemished by the taint of sin . In this part of the ceremony the high priest took the scape goat which had been set aside, laid both his hands on the head of the goat, and confessed over itall the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and sending it away into the wilderness by means of someone designated for the task. (Lev 16:21–22; πάσας τὰς ἀνομίας τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ πάσας τὰς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν καὶ πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν)12Th e terms iniqui ties, transgressions, and sins appear to represent the same reality of violating the covenant relationship with God and with neigh bor, simply restat-ing with slightly diff erent words the general under standing of sin , whether it be expressed through violation of the law, an unjust action, or transgressions against another person. Aft er the impo sition of sins upon the head of the goat by the 11. See J. Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16 (New York: Doubleday, 1991), 1028–34.12. See the analysis in ibid., 1041–46."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"71Siker: Yom Kippuring Passoverhigh priest , the goat then bore all these iniquities to a barren region, where it was set free. Al though it is understood that the scapegoat would die in the wilder-ness, the scapegoat is not technically a sacrifi cial off ering . (Nor, for that mat ter, is the Passover lamb.) In early Christian imagination, however, and I would argue in Rom 3:21–26, these two moments of the Yom Kippur observance have been merged. Christ is the place of sacrifi ce , the bloody sacrifi ce itself, and the one through whom God passes over former sins. In this case it is not the high priest who confesses the sins of the people on the scapegoat ; rather, it is those who have faith in the power of Jesus ’ obedient death that fi nd their sins passed over by a gra-cious God. God acts as the high priest placing the sins of the people upon Jesus as sca pegoat .Th ird, though there are no overt references to Passover in this pas sage, there are some interesting echoes. In particular the language of redemption (ἀπολύτρωσις, Rom 3:24) resonates with God’s deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt (Exod 15:13), as well as with the redemption of a fi rstborn son or animal from being sacrifi ced (Exod 13:13–15). As Stephen Finlan suggests: “Some of Paul’s audience may have thought of the lytron in Exodus when Paul spoke of apolytrosis.”13 When Paul applies the metaphor of Yom Kippur to Jesus , Jesus takes on the roles of both goats from the Yom Kippur ceremony. He is the unblemished sacrifi -cial victim whose blood not only cleanses the Temple sanctuary but does so once for all (to use the language from Heb 7:27; 9:12; 10:10), as well as the scapegoat that bears away the sins of the people. He becomes both the unblemished (sinless) sacrifi ce , as well as the ultimate expression of ritual defi lement, bearing sin and curse unto death (cf. Gal 3:13). His very death serves as the fi nal sending out of the scapegoat into the wilderness, and his resurrection demonstrates that his bearing sin away has in fact been effi cacious. It is diffi cult to know to what extent the earliest Jewish Christians (or perhaps better, Christian Jews) continued to observe Yom Kippur in anything like the tra-ditional manner in the aft ermath of Jesus’ death and their belief in the atoning signifi cance of his death and resurrection. We are also in the dark regarding the extent to which the earliest post-Easter believers in Jesus continued to observe Passover in a traditional manner, or to what degree and how quickly they trans-formed this observance into categories that completely subordinated all meaning of Passover to refer to the death and resurrection of Jesus .14 Th at Luke can report at the end of his Gospel that aft er the resurrection the disciples gathered conti-nually in the Temple and were praising God gives us at least some indi cation that some Christian Jews had no problem linking their veneration of the risen Jesus with worship of God in the Temple . Of course, the ref erence to Paul being given authority to arrest those who were followers of “the Way” (Acts 8–9) indicates 13. Finlan, Options on Atonement, 20.14. Certainly, by the mid–second century the now almost exclusively Gentile Chris-tian movement had completely reinterpreted the meaning of Passover in light of the death and resurrection of Jesus . Th is can clearly be seen in Melito of Sardis’ Peri Pascha (On the Pass over )."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"72Ritual and Metaphorthat from Luke’s perspective the Jew ish leaders had serious problems with such a connection. Regardless of the degree to which the earliest Christians continued to abide by these central Jewish observances, by evoking both Passover and Yom Kippur im-agery to describe the death of Jesus , Paul succeeds in blurring the distinctive ritual functions originally associated with each religious observance. Lamb and scape-goat merge. Forgiveness of sin —so closely linked to Yom Kippur —gets read onto Passover imagery , which in turn echoes the celebration of Eucharist that proclaims the Lord’s death until he comes (1 Cor 11:26).15 Passover and Yom Kippur in John If Paul’s language invokes a certain blending of Passover with Yom Kip pur , the Gospel of John a generation later does so in a much clearer way. Th e key passage is the witness of John the Baptist in John 1:29: “Th e next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, ‘Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!’ ” (ἴδε ὁ ἀμνὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ αἴρων τὴν ἁμαρτίαν τοῦ κόσμου.) Whereas the Synoptic Gospels struggle in their diff erent ways with the diffi cult overtones that Jesus was baptized by John for forgiveness of sin , the Gospel of John leaves no room for doubt on this score by emphasizing that John the Baptist bears witness to Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Rather than hav-ing John the Baptist baptizing anyone for forgiveness of sin , the fourth evan gelist instead limits the Baptist’s role to that of a witness who testifi es to Jesus as the one in whom sins are forgiven and taken away. Th e “Lamb of God ” language warrants signifi cant attention. Within the Gospel itself the reference to Jesus as “Lamb of God ” in John 1 al ready anticipates the death of Jesus during the feast of Passover some eighteen chapters away in John 19. As commentators have noted over the years, John seeks to relocate the true meaning and signifi cance of the Passover event in the person of Jesus . Th e paral-lels are clear: 1. Just as the Passover lambs were sacrifi ced in the Jerusalem Tem ple starting at noon on the Day of Preparation (John 19:14), so Je sus is put to death at the same time (rather than on the fi rst day of Passover as in the Synoptic Gospels). 2. Just as the law stipulates that not one bone of the Passover sacrifi cial lamb shall be broken (Exod 12:10), so John goes out of his way to show that the Roman soldiers did not break his legs, so that scripture might be fulfi lled (John 19:33, 36). 3. Just as the blood of the Passover lamb was spread on the door posts with hyssop branches (Exod 12:22), so during his crucifi x ion only in John is Jesus off ered a sponge full of vinegar on hys sop, which 15. See Paul Bradshaw, Eucharistic Origins (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004)."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"73Siker: Yom Kippuring Passoverhe drank (John 19:29–30; cf. Heb 9:18–20). As Ray mond Brown puts it, “When Jesus drinks the wine from the sponge put on hys-sop, symbolically he is playing the scriptural role of the paschal lamb predicted at the beginning of his career, and so has fi nished the com-mitment made when the Word be came fl esh.”16Of course, this move to redefi ne central Jewish traditions as having their ultimate signifi cance in Jesus is characteristic of John. Just as earlier in John 1 the evangelist had stated that the world was really created through Jesus as the Word ( 1:3), and just as Jesus became God’s tent of meeting—the Word become fl esh—dwelling among God’s people ( 1:14), and just as Jesus was the true meaning of the Jacob’s ladder dream, with John identifying Jesus as the Son of Man ladder connecting the heavenly and earthly realms ( 1:51), so now the person of Jesus takes on the deep-est meaning of Passover as Jesus becomes the paschal lamb, whose blood atones for sin . But it is on this last note, that Jesus as the paschal lamb atones for sin , where we run into a bit of a problem. Th e problem is that while John goes out of his way to identify Jesus as the Lamb of God , the true Pass over sacrifi ce , the meaning that John derives from this sacrifi ce does not clearly follow, at least it does not follow from the general interpretation of Passover as found in the Jewish tradition of the time. For John the signifi cance of Jesus’ identity as the Lamb of God is that he “takes away the sin of the world” ( 1:29), namely that his death is an expiatory and atoning sacrifi ce . But in early Judaism the ritual sacrifi ce of lambs at Passover was not an expiatory sacrifi ce. It commemorated the grand moment that led to the exodus of the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt , but the levitical legislation for the observance of Passover never identifi es it as a sacrifi ce that deals with human sinfulness (Exod 12; Lev 23). So why does John make this association, this new linkage, between sacrifi ce of the Passover lamb and atonement for sin ?Th ere are at least three components underlying John’s redefi nition of the Pass-over sacrifi ce in terms of atonement for sin . First, the Passover imagery of Jesus as the Lamb of God anticipates not only the death of Jesus in the context of Passover in John 19, but it also anticipates the Passover scene that immediately follows in John 2 ( 2:13) of the so-called cleansing of the Temple ( 2:13–25). In this scene Jesus drives out not only the people selling the sheep and oxen and pigeons, but he makes a whip of cords and drives out the sheep and the oxen themselves from the Temple ( 2:15; this does not happen in the Synoptics). And when asked what sign he had to show for doing this, he responds, “Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up” ( 2:19). Of course, John tells us, Jesus was referring to the temple of his body which would be raised from the dead. But for John the temple-body of Jesus will not only be raised from the dead; the death of Jesus will also function as the ultimate paschal sacrifi ce . In this way Jesus becomes the true locus of the Jerusa lem Temple . Indeed, his own body becomes the entire temple cult in min-iature, with himself as the sacrifi cial lamb and the cross as his glo rious sacrifi cial 16. Raymond Brown, Death of the Messiah (New York: Doubleday, 1994), 2:1077."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"74Ritual and Metaphoraltar .17 From John’s perspective, Jesus has driven the sacrifi cial animals out of the Temple . Th e only legitimate sacrifi ce left to happen will be the ultimate sacrifi ce of Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.Second, in early Judaism there was a tradition that dated the sacrifi cial story of the binding of Isaac (the akedah from Gen 22) to the time of Passover . Th e apoc-ryphal book of Jubilees (typically dated to ca. 150 b.c.e.) sets the time of Abraham’s off ering of Isaac to the time of the sacri fi ce of the Passover lambs, the fi ft eenth of Nisan (Jub. 17:15–18; 18:3).18 Th us there may well have been associations among fi rst-century Jewish Christians that Jesus died the same day as their patriarch Isaac , who had, aft er all, been off ered up in virtual sacrifi ce . Nothing is said regarding Isaac’s sinlessness, but Isaac is seen as one who is ob edient not only to his father Abraham , but to God. In another version of the story, this time from Qumran , we fi nd an older Isaac telling his father to bind him fast (4Q225 or 4QpsJuba ). Later rabbinic traditions can even speak as if Isaac had been sacrifi ced, or that part of his blood was shed, with aton ing eff ect.19 Further, Pseudo-Philo (a work roughly contem porary to the Gospel of John ) suggests that even the incomplete sacrifi ce of Isaac was an expiatory sacrifi ce (L.A.B. 32:3–4). Th e book of 4 Maccabees identi-fi es Isaac as a willing martyr ( 16:20)20 and sees the death of willing mar tyrs as atoning for the sins of the nation.21 Like the martyrs depicted in 4 Maccabees , the 17. See Mary Coloe, God Dwells with Us: Temple Symbolism in the Fourth Gospel (College-ville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2001).

One has to add the additional three days of travel (Jub. 18:3) for Abraham and Isaac to get to the actual fi ft eenth of the month, and so to Passover , even before Passover was inaugurated in Jewish tradition. Th is continues the motif of Abraham being faithful in all things (he even keeps the law in advance of its being given to Moses). See further J. C. Vanderkam, “Th e Aqedah , Jubilees, and Pseudo-Jubilees,” in Th e Quest for Context and Meaning: Studies in Biblical Intertextuality in Honor of James A. Sanders (ed. C. A. Evans and S.

And through the blood of"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"75Siker: Yom Kippuring PassoverGospel of John goes out of its way to specify that Jesus lays down his life of his own accord, as a willing sacrifi ce ( 10:17–18).22 Th e akedah simply becomes one more component piece that contributed to the sacrifi cial understanding of Jesus’ death, now blended, indeed congealed, with the blood of the Passover lamb and the Yom Kippur scapegoat . Th ird, though many commentators dispute any relation, I think one can rea-sonably argue for a connection between the traditions of Yom Kippur and the identifi cation of Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Th e essential connection is between the ritual off ering of an animal (whether a lamb or a goat) and the generic removal of sin from the people. Th ere are indeed important diff erences between the sacrifi ce of Jesus as the Lamb of God and the Yom Kippur ritual. First, in keeping with Passover , Jesus is characterized as a lamb (ἀμνός), whereas in Yom Kippur Lev 16 stipulates a goat (χίμαρον).23 Second, Jesus actu-ally dies as the Passover sacrifi ce , whereas in the Yom Kippur legisla tion there are two goats; one goat is sacrifi ced as a sin off ering (Lev 16:9), but the other goat, on whose head the high priest lays his hands and confesses all the sins of the people, is not sacrifi ced but rather is sent away into the wilderness (Lev 16:21). It is under-stood that this goat will die in the wilderness, but there is a diff erence between the act of sacrifi cing a goat and sending a goat to its certain death. A close con nection exists, however, between the two goats involved in the Yom Kippur observance. One is sacrifi ced, and its blood is used to cleanse the mercy seat , a kind of renewal of the sanctuary so that sacrifi ce can be made and sins forgiven; the other is not sacrifi ced, but it will carry the people’s collective sins into the wilderness. Both goats are involved in a process of removing sin from the people. Th ese diff erences notwithstanding, the connection between Jesus’ death as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, and the Yom Kippur scapegoat who bears away the sins of the people, would be understood in parallel terms by the Johannine Christians, so that just as the meaning of Passover now fi nds its ultimate expression in Jesus as the Lamb of God , so also the meaning of the Yom Kippur ritual fi nds its ultimate expression in Jesus as the one through whom the sin of the world is taken away. Th e temporal connection between Jesus’ death and Passover is inevitable since Jesus died in close proximity to this crucial festival. But John appears to import into the meaning of Jesus ’ death the atoning signifi cance typically associated with the observance of Yom Kippur . John thus blurs the dis-tinctions we might make in order to make a larger point about the unparalleled signifi cance of the death of Jesus as the Lamb of God .24those devout ones and their death as an expiation , divine Providence preserved Israel that previously had been affl icted.” On 4 Maccabees see J. W. van Henten, Th e Maccabean Mar-tyrs as Saviours of the Jewish People: A Study of 2 and 4 Maccabees (Leiden: Brill, 1997). 22. Cf. also John 18:11 and 10:17–18, and Brown, Death of the Messiah, 2:1442.23. It is important to note, however, that Lev 4:32 stipulates that a female lamb (πρόβατον) can be substituted for a goat as a sin off ering . Th ough this allowance does not occur in the context of the Yom Kippur observance, it is still signifi cant that there was relative fl uidity in whether one off ered a goat or a lamb.24. See C. K. Barrett, Th e Gospel according to St. John (2nd ed.; London: SPCK, 1978),"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"76Ritual and MetaphorTh e notion of taking away sins, especially on a large scale (whether it be the sins of the people, as with Yom Kippur , or the sins of the world—as with John 1:29), necessarily invokes the overtones of Yom Kippur and the entire complex of sacrifi ce , confession, and cleansing from sin that goes with it. Th us, I want to suggest that, as with Paul, the early Chris tian linking of the Passover lamb with the forgiveness of sins shows a kind of recombinant ritualizing on the part of the Christian community as it sought to make sense of Jesus ’ death out of its Jewish context. In short, early Christians took the other most signifi cant holy day in Jew-ish tradition, Yom Kippur , and imported its central emphasis on forgiveness of sins into the ritual imagination of Passover . Th us, early Christians engaged in the process of “Yom Kippuring ” Passover , a kind of recom binant theologizing of cen-tral Jewish rituals in the service of Christian eff orts to make sense of Jesus’ death in light of Jewish tradition. Just as the paschal lamb had saved the Hebrews from the angel of death in an cient Egypt , so now Jesus as the paschal lamb had saved God’s people from their sins. Why else would he have died? Why else would he have had to die, as the earliest Christians saw things? For surely he would not have died (and been raised from the dead) were it not necessary to God’s plan (so Luke 24:26: “Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suff er these things and then enter into his glory?”)Perhaps there is no better image for the blurring of these two func tions of Pass-over sacrifi ce and Yom Kippur scapegoat than the scene of the risen Jesus showing the wounds of his crucifi xion to doubting Th o mas. And what an amazing scene it is—even the unblemished risen Pass over lamb who takes away sins still bears the physical blemishes from his atoning death. In this way have the cultic metaphors of Passover and Yom Kippur not just been blurred, but joined into a new cultic ceremony altogether—one that refocuses both rituals and their meanings onto the person of Jesus and the signifi cance of his death.Lamb of God and Isaiah 53?Many scholars have argued that the best explanation for this linkage between the Lamb of God and taking away the sin of the world can be found in Christian ap-propriation of Isa 53, the famous Suff ering Servant song that was so widely used in early Christian tradition. A couple of parallels stand out. First, Isa 53:4 reads, “Surely he has borne our sins and carried our diseases,” which is parallel to John’s notion of the lamb tak ing away the sin of the world. Second, Isa 53:7 reads that this servant “was oppressed, and he was affl icted, yet he did not open his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter , and like a sheep that be fore its shear ers is silent, so he did not open his mouth” (nrsv). But the lxx puts it slightly diff erently: καὶ αὐτὸς διὰ τὸ κεκακῶσθαι οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη 176. It is also important to note in this connection that some commentators interpret the Lamb of God language as drawing on “the Suff ering Servant of God” motif found in Isa 53, especially 53:7, where the Suff ering Servant is identifi ed as an ἀμνός (lamb) that is led to the slaughter , and who was “stricken for the transgression of my people.” See, for example, R.

Th e Hebrew does not clear things up very much, though it provides the basis for the English translations:פיו׃ יפתח ולא נאלמה גזזיה לפני וכרחל יובל לטבח כשׂה יפתח־פיו ולא נענה והוא נגשׂTh e key term here is כשׂה, which means “as one from a fl ock”—typi cally either a sheep or a goat25—which is brought to be slaughtered , and the רחל (a ewe) is brought before the shearers.Th us the parallels between John 1:29 and Isa 53 are not as exact as some might argue. Th e lamb (ἀμνός) is brought before shearers, not to be slaughtered . And while the servant (not a lamb) has borne our sins (οὗτος τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν φέρει) in Isa 53:4, in John 1:29 the lamb has taken away (ὁ αἴρων τὴν ἁμαρτίαν τοῦ κόσμου) the sin of the world. Th ese are cer tainly signifi cant, though not exact, parallels. I would like to make a stronger case for the Yom Kippur ceremony from Lev 16 being an equally possible parallel to the John 1:29 statement as Isa 53. Th e general parallel between Lev 16 and John 1 has to do with the removal of sin . But there are also at least two problems with seeing Lev 16 as a clear parallel to John 1:29. First, John 1:29 is quite clear that a lamb (ἀμνός) takes away the sin of the world, whereas in Lev 16 it is equally clear that the high priest imposes the sins of the people on the head of a goat (τοῦ χιμάρου τοῦ ζῶντος—Lev 16:21). Second, the goat is not sacrifi ced but is sent away into the wil derness, bearing away the sins of the people. In relation to this latter point, however, two observations are appro-priate. It is important to note that even though the scapegoat in Leviticus is not off ered as a sacrifi ce, nonetheless it remains clear that it will die in the wilderness, and the sins that it bears will die with it. Likewise, in John 1:29 no explicit refer-ence is made to the lamb of God taking away sin by means of sacrifi cial off ering , though again this seems to be implied. Th us, in my view, the early Christians could and did see echoes and parallels to Jesus’ death not only in passages such as Isa 53, but also in Lev 16 and the Yom Kip pur rituals articulated there. Yom Kippuring Passover and Perfecting Jesus Th e blending of Passover lamb and Yom Kippur scapegoat in the death of Jesus helped both to account for his death and give it meaning. Why did he have to die? Why was it necessary for Jesus to die?26 Th is is the theological question with which the early Christians had to wrestle. Th e answer to this question is decep-tively simple: he had to die because in fact he did die. If he didn’t need to die, then it follows that God would not have allowed him to die. Th erefore his death must have been God’s will. Why else would God raise this crucifi ed messiah back to new 25. See BDB, 962.26. Th e Gospel of Luke asserts that it was necessary, but never states why (cf. Luke 24)."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"78Ritual and Metaphorlife? But both the fact of his death and the manner of his death demanded a deeper theological explanation. Th ere must be a divine rationale, if only the early Chris-tians could fi gure it out. Making sense of this death was the greatest theological challenge for the newly distraught and now rejoicing followers of Jesus . Paul put it well: the cross was a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Greeks (1 Cor 1:23). As we have seen, early Christians (or, again, Christian Jews, to em phasize the Jewish contexts of early Christian theologizing) made sense of Jesus’ death in light of their Jewish scriptures and Jewish rituals. Th ey came to the conviction that Jesus died as a sacrifi cial victim , a sacrifi ce of atonement , a Passover lamb with a Yom Kippur meaning.27 In the re mainder of this essay we will examine some of the implications of un derstanding Jesus in sacrifi cial terms, especially as it relates to the per fecting of Jesus .Like any appropriate sacrifi ce for the Temple , Jesus must meet the standards of a sacrifi ce. Jewish scriptures actually say relatively little about such standards. Leviticus 22:22–24 spells out some of them. Any animal brought to the altar for sacrifi ce must be ritually pure . Th is means that all animals must be free at least of the following defects:Anything blind, or injured, or maimed, or having a discharge, or an itch, or scabs—these you shall not off er to the Lord. . . . An ox or a lamb that has a limb too long or too short you may present for a freewill off ering ; but it will not be ac-cepted for a vow. Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not off er to the Lord; such you shall not do within your land.2827. On Yom Kippur in early Christianity, see especially Daniel Stökl Ben Ezra, Th e Im-pact of Yom Kippur on Early Christianity: Th e Day of Atonement from Second Temple Juda-ism to the Fift h Century (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003). 28. Although various terms are used for “unblemished” or “spotless” both in the He-brew text and in the lxx translation that would have been used by the early Christians, the most common term is a form of ἄμωμος. For example, Lev 4:32 states, “If the off ering you bring as a sin off ering is a sheep, you shall bring a female without blemish.” In Exod 12:5 we read that “your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.” Th e term translated in English as “without blemish” was rendered in Greek (lxx) as a πρόβατον τέλειον, literally a “perfect sheep,” but with the clear meaning of being unblemished. Exod 29:1 instructs, “Take one young bull and two rams without ble mish.” Th e Greek translation is λήμψῃ μοσχάριον ἐκ βοῶν ἓν καὶ κριοὺς δύο ἀμώμους, where ἀμώμους literally means “without mark” or “blameless” (again, with no moral overtone). Th e same term can be found in Lev 1:3, 10. Leviticus 22:20 states, “You shall not off er anything that has a blemish (μῶμον), for it will not be acceptable in your behalf.” Deuteronomy 15:21 states: “But if it has any defect—any serious defect (πᾶς μῶμος πονηρός), such as lameness or blind ness—you shall not sacrifi ce it to the Lord your God.” Similarly Deut 17:1, “You must not sacrifi ce to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has a defect (μῶμον), anything se riously wrong; for that is abhorrent to the Lord your God.” See also Ezek 43:23; Mal 1:8, 14. Malachi 1:14 uses the term διεφθαρμένον (“spoiled, ruined”) to designate a ble mished animal sacrifi ce. In Phil 3:6 Paul can call himself “blame-less” (ἄμεμπτος) as to righ teousness under the law. Th is term is especially prominent in Job (1:1, 8; 2:3; 4:17; 9:20; 11:4; 12:4; etc.)."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"79Siker: Yom Kippuring PassoverTh e priests and rabbis, of course, expanded upon this list as they sought to be faithful to God.29 But the basic requirements are there. When one went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival the average pil grim could count on plenty of ritually appropriate sacrifi cial animals to be ready for purchase, in this case lambs. Priests and Levites regulated the sacrifi cial process of the Tem-ple so that only ritually pure animals would be sacrifi ced . Th ey would check for obvious blemishes—sores, bad teeth, broken bones, spots, and the like. Th e gen-eral idea was that you were to present your best to God and not try to get away with sacri fi cing a less than ideal animal. As noted above, the Gospel of John goes out of its way to make it quite clear that Jesus was indeed an appropriate sacrifi cial victim :Th e Jews . . . asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucifi ed men broken and the bodies removed (since it was the Day of Preparation). Th en the soldiers came and broke the legs of the fi rst and of the other who had been cruci fi ed with him. But then they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. . . . Th ese things occurred so that the Scripture might be fulfi lled, “None of his bones shall be broken.”—a ref erence to Exod 12:46 regarding the Passover lamb (John 19:31–36). Paul makes much the same point by referring to Jesus as one who “knew no sin ” (2 Cor 5:21). Th us Jesus is a ritually pure sacrifi cial victim —without spot of ble mish. But an animal appropriate for sacrifi ce has, of course, only a ritual standing. Animals do not have moral standing. It does not matter whether the animal was a good animal or a bad animal (whatever that might mean) as long as it was ritually pure . And this is where the trans fer of sacrifi cial imagery to Jesus takes its crucial turn. Whereas an ani mal has no moral standing, every person by defi nition does have a moral standing. Th us, when the imagery of a sacrifi cial animal is mapped onto Jesus as an unblemished victim , it automatically takes on moral over tones. If Jesus as a human being functioned as a sacrifi ce , he must have been not only ritually pure , but morally pure as well. Here we see a tran sition from the physicality of ritual purity, where the notion of “without blemish” is meant quite literally, to a spiritualization of ritual purity that refers to the disposition of the human heart, and in this case (the only case) to spiritual purity, the spiritual perfection of Jesus as a human being. Th is spiritual perfection leads directly to a moral perfection. Jesus becomes unblemished in both spirit and in action. His words and deeds are blameless, sinless (they never miss the target), because his actions are but a refl ec-tion of his inner spirit, pure and blameless, in turn a refl ection of God. Th us his shameful and sinful death precisely becomes the ve hicle, in view of the resurrec-tion, for demonstrating his righteousness and his unblemished life. Th is kind of retrospection leads to the convic tion that since Jesus was spiritually and morally 29. See, for example, Leviticus Rabbah, as well as the Mishnah Tractate Yoma (on the observance of Yom Kippur ) and Tractate Zebahim (on animal off erings ). Th e rabbis contin-ued to debate the sacrifi cial regulations long aft er the destruction of the Second Temple ."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"80Ritual and Metaphorwithout spot or blemish, then he must have been a perfect human being, and so a perfect sacrifi ce . Hebrews 4 makes this claim directly—that Jesus is the great high priest who makes the atoning sacrifi ce of himself in the heavenly temple . His sac-rifi ce is acceptable because he is in every respect like all human be ings, yet without sin (Heb 4:14). Th e observance of the scapegoat ritual in which the goat bears away the sins of the people, and so bears the curse of sin on behalf of the people, is not only a powerful image , but—lest we forget—was the ac tual ritual practice of the Jerusa-lem Temple in the time of Jesus and the earliest Christian Jews. It was a time of solemn repentance and fasting. It also marked a time of renewal for the people, for the high priest , and for the Temple itself. By ritually purifying people, priest , and Temple , the observance of Yom Kippur allowed for the ongoing eff ectiveness of the temple cult and the prescribed sacrifi cial activity that helped Israel to negotiate its relationship with God. Early Christians did not lightly associate the retrospective signifi c ance of the death of Jesus with the meaning of Yom Kippur . Indeed, it appears that the experi-ences of the death and resurrection of Jesus were galvanizing in the extreme for his followers. Th ese experiences com pelled them to refl ect deeply upon the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus in light of the most signifi cant aspects of their Jew-ish faith and practice, their scriptures and rituals. And so the tragedy of another prophet put to death became, in light of the resurrection, a glorious tra gedy of sacrifi ce and redemption modeled aft er the ritualizing of sacri fi ce and redemp-tion they knew so well from the activities carried out in the Jerusalem Temple , and from the sacrifi cial legislation found in the scriptures. Th e animal sacrifi ces in the Temple were simply part of their world, indeed part of Jesus’ own world. Just as the people, the high priest , and the Temple were renewed by the rituals of Yom Kippur , so the followers of Jesus came to believe that they were renewed and trans-formed by the combination of Jesus ’ shameful death and unexpected resurrection from the dead. Just as the death of the scapegoat bore away the sins of the people, so now the followers of Jesus began to imagine the sinful death of Jesus as perhaps a death for sinners. Th e Passover lamb was a symbol of freedom from slavery in Egypt , and now the notion of Jesus as a sacrifi cial lamb began to take shape, blend-ing and blurring Passover ritual with both Yom Kippur meaning and texts such as Isa 53:7 (“like a lamb that is led to the slaughter ”), a crucifi ed victim whose death only made sense in light of resurrection. Th is crucifi ed Passover lamb must have died to free God’s people, but not from Rome , at least not yet. And so the follow-ers of Jesus began to weave new connections between the paschal lamb and the scapegoat , between freedom and sin . Just as the deaths of the Maccabean martyrs were connected in Jew ish tradi-tion to atonement for the people,30 and just as the near-sacrifi ce of Isaac was un-30. See especially 4 Macc 6:30, where before his martyrdom Eleazar prays to God, “Be merci ful to your people, and let my punishment suffi ce for them. Make my blood their purifi ca tion , and take my life in exchange for theirs.” A similar refl ection of vicarious suff er-ing can be seen in 2 Macc 7:37–38. See van Henten, Maccabean Martyrs."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"81Siker: Yom Kippuring Passoverderstood to have an atoning eff ect, so the followers of Jesus could draw the same connections. Only in the case of Jesus they came to believe that he had been raised from the dead, which infi nitely magnifi ed the signifi cance of his death since he had clearly been vindi cated by God, and vindicated in the most dramatic fashion imaginable. If God had vindicated Jesus by means of resurrection it must be an indica tion of how important his death had been. He had not only died in order to be raised (as in Luke );31 rather, his death held a new depth of meaning that his followers were only beginning to mine. Jesus’ death was a sa crifi cial death, at least in light of resurrection faith. Like sacrifi cial ani mals in the Temple he too must have been unblemished. But being with out physical spot or blemish made little sense when applied to a human being (Jesus was never accused of having a skin disease!). He must have been without spot or blemish in a more spiritual or moral sense, namely, sinless. Th e sinlessness of Jesus , then, is a direct result of early Christians re fl ecting upon the death of Jesus in the immediate context of Passover , and particularly the Passover sacrifi ce . By importing the signifi cance of sacrifi ce associated with Yom Kippur , the early Christians were able to create a new and powerful meaning for the death of Jesus —his death is an atoning death for sins, which is confi rmed by God’s raising him from the dead. And now as Christians began to retell the story of Jesus , they did so with this retrospective understanding—the risen Jesus had died for human sins as a perfect sacrifi ce . Th is moral and spiritual perfection was now retrojected back upon the entire ministry of Jesus , from the cross to his ministry of teaching and healing to his baptism and fi nally to his birth. If Jesus was perfect, surely he must have had divine origins, and an appropriately divine birth story needed to accompany the one who would be a perfect sacrifi ce. Th us the story of the virgin birth is likely an extension of early Christian refl ection on the death of Jesus as a perfect sacrifi ce. ConclusionIn this essay I hope to have shown how the retrojection of a sinless Jesus from res-urrection to death to ministry to birth derives, at least in part, from early Christian refl ection on the death of Jesus in light of the Jewish ritual observance of Passover and Yom Kippur . Th e process of such refl ec tion resulted in a blurring of these two central traditions as they were understood anew with Jesus now seen as both Passover lamb and as Yom Kippur scapegoat . Th e blurring of these two traditions resulted in a kind of recombinant ritualizing within early Christianity, in which the Passover lamb and the Yom Kippur scapegoat were fused in Chris tian refl ec-tion as a commentary on the faithful death of Jesus on behalf of human sin . One fi nal aspect of this process is important to mention in closing, and this has to do with the shift in early Christianity from a metaphorical to an ontological un-derstanding of Jesus as the perfect and unblemished sacrifi ce . One of the most im-31. While the Gospel of Luke emphasizes the necessity of Jesus’ death, Luke nowhere states why this death was necessary."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"82Ritual and Metaphorportant things about early Christian appro priations of Temple sacrifi cial language to understand the death of Jesus is that such language was primarily metaphorical . To call Jesus a sacrifi cial animal creates a metaphor between Jesus as a human being and the animals sacrifi ced in the Temple . Human sacrifi ce was, of course, abhor rent to all Jews. In the process of refl ecting on this metaphor , however, Chris-tian tradition increasingly ontologized it, ossifi ed it, literalized it so that the notion of Jesus as a sacrifi ce of atonement became the primary way of understanding Jesus’ death, and so Jesus himself. Already in Hebrews we fi nd a Platonizing of the sacrifi cial death of Jesus , so that the sacrifi ce Jesus makes is in the heavenly temple once and for all (Heb 9–10). And since Jesus is the divine Son, only he can enter into this hea venly temple . His priesthood is not like the Aaronic priesthood of the earthly temple ; rather, Jesus is a priest aft er the order of Melchizedek (Heb 4, 7). What we see in Hebrews is but another example of the literalizing of the origi-nal metaphor associating Jesus with sacrifi ce. Th e danger of such ontologizing is that while contextually understandable, it tends toward an understanding of Jesus (and Jesus as a refl ection of God) that ultimately cannot breathe very well with developing understandings of God and what God is doing.32 As Christian theol-ogy develops and changes, as we continue the process of theologizing anew in light of new experiences, metaphors must be seen for the fl exible images that they are. And so continues the process of conversation between the emerging Christian convictions of the fi rst century and the developing Christian convictions of the twenty-fi rst century about the identity of this crucifi ed yet risen Jesus . 32. Tom Rausch, S.J., has put it well: “While Christians generally say that Jesus off ered his life as a sacrifi ce for their sins, the literalizing of the metaphors of sacrifi ce raises trou-bling questions for many Christians today” (Who Is Jesus?

Th e objection is that the term is used too broadly. Scholars have indeed used the term to mean six diff erent things (by my count), which does call for clarifi ca-tion in usage. It is important to notice that the six phenomena designated spiritual-ization are related in interesting ways. Distinguishing the six phenomena and ob-serving the tensions among them illuminates some links among reli gious refl ec-tion, metaphorical thinking, and the evolution of religious rituals. I refer to these as six levels of spiritualization , despite the intense disputes between advocates of the diff erent levels, debates that continue in our own time. A study of spiritual-ization is commended not by the frequency of its usage (or the vehemence of its rejection), but by the depth of insight into the interpretation of religion that such a study might yield. I now review the six common usages of the term, although the main concern of this article will be with levels three, four, and fi ve in the epistles of Paul and in Hebrews .Th e fi rst kind of spiritualization is the substitution of one sacrifi cial off ering for another. Greek mythology has many stories of animals being substituted for humans, including the last-minute substitution of a deer for Iphigenia, and of a golden-fl eeced ram in place of some human vic tims in a Boeotian myth .1 Th e substitution may be of an animal victim for a human (see Gen 22:13), of one ani-mal victim for another, or of a redemption payment for the prospective victim . An example of the latter is Yahweh’s command to “redeem” the fi rstborn males (Exod 13:13), aft er fi rst having made a sacrifi cial claim upon them (Exod 13:2). In theory, the Israelites are to sacrifi ce all fi rstborn males, human or animal: they are to “dedicate” (nab) or “set apart to the Lord all that fi rst opens the womb” (13:12 nrsv); the verb, עבר in hiphil, is a sacrifi cial term (see 2 Kgs 16:3). Exodus shows 1. A lost ending to Euripides’ Iphigenia at Aulis, preserved in Aelian, Historia animalium 7.39; Moses Hadas and John McLean, Ten Plays by Euripides (New York: Bantam Books, 1960), 354. Th e substitution with a ram is told in Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.9.1.83"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"84Ritual and Metaphorthe theoretical similarity and the actual diff er ence in the possible fates of a fi rst-born donkey and a boy: “Every fi rstborn donkey you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. Every fi rstborn male among your children you shall redeem” (13:13). Th ere is a choice regarding donkeys, but not re garding sons, who must be redeemed. Th e second phenomenon that has been termed spiritualization could also be called moralizing or rationalizing. Th is is the practice of attributing new and mor-alizing meanings to cultic practices or priestly categories. It is pro-cultic, while importing new values into the cult or priesthood . Th e prophet Malachi gives a new meaning to purifi cation , linking it with morality. What qualifi es the descen-dants of Levi to be pure enough to “present off erings ” is their rejection of adul-tery, disho nesty, and oppression of workers and widows (Mal 3:3, 5). Ritual rules still matter, however; the priests should be ashamed of off ering “pol luted food” and “blind animals,” robbing God of tithes and off erings (Mal 1:7–8; 3:8–10). But ritual privilege demands moral behavior: marital disloyalty disqualifi es a priest from off ering ( 2:13–14). Cult is trans formed when cultic purifi cation is made de-pendent on justice. Spirituali zation level two enables religious innovation to wear the mantle of tradition. Philo of Alexandria allegorizes, assigning new meanings to rituals: washing the sacrifi cial victim’s belly and feet signifi es “that the appetites shall be purifi ed, which are full of stains, and intoxication.”2 Th e law prohibits con-sumption of those animals “which are most fl eshy and fat, and calculated to excite treacherous pleasure.”3 Every ritual is given some moralistic meaning. Spiritualization level three is interiorization, putting all the emphasis on spiri-tual motive, as in the psalmist’s assertion, “Th e sacrifi ce accepta ble to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart” (Ps 51:17), or in the Chinese text: “Sac-rifi ce is not a thing coming to a man from without; it issues from within him . . . only men of . . . virtue can give complete exhibition to the idea of sacrifi ce” (Li Ki 22.1).4 Clooney says this level of spiritualization “did relocate the meaning of sacrifi ce as interior to the performer. . . . Sacrifi ce is rethought and ethically puri-fi ed.”5 Spiritualiz ing interpretation on levels two and three enables change within conti nuity. Indian religion for many centuries involved a discourse on substi tution. A Vedic text describes the sacrifi cial quality passing out of a man to a horse, then to a cow, a ram, a goat, and fi nally into a grain off ering .6 Substitution (level one) was paralleled by reinterpretation (level two) and by interiorization of the concept of sacrifi ce (level three). Th e fourth level of spiritualization is the metaphorical appropriation of cultic 2. Spec. Leg. 1.206; Th e Works of Philo (trans. C. D. Yonge; Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1993), 553.3. Spec.

Th ese metaphors can be called “borrowings from sacrifi ce.”7 When levels three and four are combined, the literal ritual is no longer in view, only its image . Th is intellectual abstraction corresponds to a literal social change. Since rituals are boundary-setting activities, a retreat from a ritual weakens a particular boundary and allows outsiders (however de-fi ned) to become insiders. Th e emphasis on the inner life is paralleled by a certain social openness. Jesus expresses such openness and inward ness while utilizing a potentially sacrifi cial term: “blessed are the pure (καθαροί) in heart” (Matt 5:8). Spiritual qualities alone are highlighted in the Beatitudes; neither the qualities (hu-mility, mournful compassion, truth hunger) nor the hostile activities (persecuting, reviling) are nation ally specifi c or ethnically bounded. “Blessed are the ritually pure ” would require interpretation by a particular priestly group, but “blessed are the pure in heart” can be understood by anyone.Spiritualization level fi ve is the outright rejection of sacrifi ce : “God, if indeed he truly is God, has need of nothing.”8 Level three values have been intensifi ed to the point that sacrifi ce is scorned, and something else is advocated: “For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifi ce”; “to obey is better than sacrifi ce ” (Hos 6:6; 1 Sam 15:22). Th e ritual may even be mocked: the priests “feed on the sin of my people”; “Shall I give my fi rstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?” (Hos 4:8; Mic 6:7). Two of the prophets deny that God established the cult in the fi rst place: “Did you bring to me sacrifi ces and off erings the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?” “In the day that I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt , I did not speak to them or command them concerning burnt off ering s and sacrifi ces” (Amos 5:25; Jer 7:22). Th e current academic trend is to mute the prophetic critique of sacrifi ce . One suggests that the prophets “employ criticisms of the cult as a rhetorical device to criticize the people”9—of course! But, in so doing, Amos , Hosea , Micah , and Jeremiah do denigrate the cult: the des-picable feasts , the “altars for sinning,” the excessive off erings , the decep tive calling upon the temple (Amos 5:21; Hos 8:11; Mic 6:6; Jer 7:4).Th e sixth usage of spiritualization no longer refers to sacrifi ce but signifi es persons or communities becoming infused with spiritual prop erties and values. One author writes of Paul’s vision of the spiritualiza tion of reality: overcoming all confl ict between body and soul, bringing the Spirit into “the totality of reality.”10 Another speaks of the “spirituali zation of power,” when “power manifests itself 7.

An internalizing saying may signal a demotion of the literal cultic usage, but not always; it may lean toward the affi rmation of cult (level two): “Off er right sacrifi ces and put your trust in the Lord” (Ps 4:5).Scholars have used spiritualization in each of the six ways listed above. Oft en they are combining two or three of these meanings, de scribing some very diff erent and complex strategies for reforming, re thinking, or replacing the cult. Ezekiel wants to purify and intensify the cult; Micah wants to do away with it. Clearly there is a problem in using the same word to describe these very diff erent strate-gies. But all the phenomena described as spiritualization have something to do with the quest for highest values, and the hope for socialization of those val ues. Further, there seems to be a structure of relationships between these six phenom-ena, even though there is clearly a confl ict between level-two defenders of cult and level-fi ve rejecters. It is a profound distortion to assume that spiritualization is only Helle nistic, and not biblical. Nevertheless, the super-culture that is Hel lenism tended to be universalizing and to militate against literalism in cult: national cults were under pressure from universalizing cults. With this as a background, we can take a brief look at Paul, respond to a scholarly attack on spiritualization , and then move to our main study: the epistle to the Hebrews . Spiritualization in PaulΠαρακαλῶ οὖν ὑμᾶς, ἀδελφοί, διὰ τῶν οἰκτιρμῶν τοῦ θεοῦ παραστῆσαι τὰ σώ-ματα ὑμῶν θυσίαν ζῶσαν ἁγίαν εὐάρεστον τῷ θεῷ, τὴν λογικὴν λατρείαν ὑμῶν I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifi ce , holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiri-tual worship. (Rom 12:1 nrsv)Th e “living sacrifi ce (θυσίαν ζῶσαν)” and “spiritual worship (λογικὴν λατρείαν)” are sacrifi cial metaphors (level-four spiritualizing ). Other com mon sacrifi cial terms are “to present (παραστῆσαι)” and “acceptable (εὐάρεστον).” Th e translation “spiritual worship” has been contested: worship that is λογική may be “spiritual,” in contrast to material and literal (Moule), or it may be “rational,” in tune with the universal law that is within every person (the Stoic notion; Evans).12 In either 11.

Given Paul’s earlier remarks about “our sinful passions” and the need to “put to death the deeds of the body” ( 7:5; 8:13), the metaphor “living sacri fi ce” must also signify rigorous self-restraint, if not systematic asceticism. A vigorous personal practice is suggested by such drastic metaphors as destruction of “the body of sin ” and rescue from a “body of death” (Rom 6:6; 7:24). What Paul asks of his readers is not his own level of as-ceticism, but a certain self-eff acement, generosity, willingness to “love one another with mutual aff ection” (Rom 12:3, 8, 10), culminating in the Jesus -like advice to “overcome evil with good” ( 12:21). Bodily motivation, self-interest, and pride are to be sacrifi ced , that is, surrendered. (Th is meta phorical meaning of “sacrifi ce ”—giving up something desirable—has become normal English usage.)Th e notion of giving oneself as a “holy ” off ering ( 12:1) combines in teri orization and metaphor -making, and draws upon images available in Jewish and Gentile sources. In T. L e v i 3:4, 6, “in the upper most heaven,” the angels “present to the Lord a pleasing odor, a rational and bloodless oblation (λογικὴν καὶ ἀναίμακτον θυσίαν),”13 while the Corpus Hermeticum is contrasting prayer to literal sacrifi c-ing (which it utterly rejects) when it says God will “receive from all their rational sacrifi ce (λογικὴν θυσίαν).”14 Th e metaphor of a bloodless or rational sacrifi ce is meant to picture an aspect of religious experience: a heightened awareness of spiritual purpose and transfor-mation. But when we move to Paul’s soteriology, the emphasis is no longer on an inward experience but on what Christ accomplished in his death. Paul uses both cultic (sacrifi ce , scapegoat ) and noncultic (redemption, justifi cation, reconcilia-tion ) metaphors , but they all picture Christ’s death bringing about a changed rela-tionship between humans and God. Th e sacrifi cial image can be linked with ad vice for self-correction: “clean out the old yeast. . . . For our paschal lamb, Christ, is sacrifi ced (ἐτύθη)” (1 Cor 5:7). Th e cultic concept of purifi cation may be blended with the judicial image of acquittal: “now that we have been justifi ed by his blood , will we be saved through him from the wrath of God” (Rom 5:9). Sacrifi ce has oft en seemed to imply that God was propitiated or persuaded, but here Paul speaks against this implica tion: God initiated the saving act (Rom 5:5, 8). Elsewhere he makes clear that God was not reconciled , but was doing the reconciling, in Christ (2 Cor 5:19). Paul also uses scapegoat images . Th e scapegoat is not a sacrifi ce, but a sin-bearer or curse-bearer. Like a scapegoat , Christ “becom[es] a curse for us” (Gal 3:13). God “made him to be sin ” (2 Cor 5:21). Both sacrifi ce and scapegoat seem to be present in Rom 8:3, where the Son is sent περὶ ἁμαρτίας. nrsv translates this “to deal with sin ,” but tniv’s “to be a sin off ering ” is preferable, because περὶ ἁμαρτίας is the technical term for the sin off ering in the lxx.

Th e mercy seat (ἱλαστήριον in Greek ; כפרת [kappo ret] in Hebrew) is the lid of the ark of the covenant , the centerpiece of Jerusalem’s sacrifi cial cult. In Exodus , Yahweh tells Moses to “make a mercy seat of pure gold,” with two cherubim “overshadow-ing the mercy seat with their wings . . . and from above the mercy seat . . . I will deliver to you all my commands” (Exod 25:17, 20, 22). In the First Temple pe riod, the mercy seat and the ark were kept in the Most Holy Place, a for bidden room en-tered only by the high priest and only on the Day of Atonement , where he cleansed the impurity of the nation by sprinkling the blood of purifi cation sacrifi ces on and “before the mercy seat ” (Lev 16:14). Being the site of the supreme ritual of purifi -cation with blood , this made for a highly suggestive metaphor . Paul is suggesting that Christ is the new mercy seat, the “place” where sin is purifi ed, a mercy seat of faith (ἱλαστήριον διὰ [τῆς] πίστεως, 3:25). Th is image is distorted by nrsv’s choice of “sacrifi ce of atonement ” in Rom 3:25. A ἱλαστήριον is never a sacrifi cial victim in any Greek source.16 All the lxx occurrences of ἱλαστήριον in the Pentateuch refer to the mercy seat , but non-Jerusalem ἱλαστήρια occur in the Bethel temple in Amos 9:1 and in the imagi-nary temple in Ezek 43:14, 17, 20.17 Th is sug gests that a more general translation would be possible: “place of atone ment ,” or even “place of conciliation,” since the base verb, ἱλάσκομαι, refers to conciliation, appeasement , being made favorable.18 Although “sacrifi ce of atonement ” is not accurate, Paul is employing a sacrifi cial image . His confl ation of sacrifi cial and nonsacrifi cial metaphors in Rom 3 will be discussed in connection with Heb 9:4–5.Paul’s cultic metaphors picture the death of Christ functioning as a God-appointed method for purifi cation , renewal, and sin-removal . Th us, sacrifi cial ideas are taken from the temple practice, but given new mean ing (and social set-ting). Metaphorical language proves useful for new social formations, negotiat-ing (intellectual) continuity within (so cial) change. Metaphorizing both preserves and transforms a way of thinking about the approach to God. Scholars can debate whether the approach is still “cultic,” or whether it is purely an abstraction of the cult, and in some ways anti-cultic. Th ese interpretations will reveal one’s own spiri-tualizing and social instincts. 15. Barnabas 7:7–9; Tertullian , Adv. Marcion 3.7.7; m. Yoma 6:4; Lester L.

Paul is emphasizing the believer’s inner transformation in Rom 12:1, but in Rom 3:25; 5:9–10; 1 Cor 5:7 he is explaining the transaction by which Christ gained salvation for believers. Obviously these diff erent aspects of Paul’s theology need to be distinguished, but they can also be related: “For just as the suff erings of Christ are abundant for us, so also our consolation is abundant through Christ” (2 Cor 1:5). Believers who practice Christ-like compassion have “the same mind . . . that was in Christ Je sus ” (Phil 2:5). The Attack on Spiritualization It has become necessary to defend the use of the term spiritualization , especially since a recent and infl uential book by Jonathan Klawans rejects application of the term to Jesus , Paul, Philo , Josephus , or the Qum ran community.19 A crucial factor shaping his attack on the term is his insistence that spiritualization must mean “a critique of sacrifi ce , practi cally by defi nition.”20 He will not allow the term to have other meanings, even when he admires the work of a scholar who uses the term to mean something other than rejection of sacrifi ce .21 Klawans admits that He brews , Acts 7, and Revelation are “rejectionist . . . antitemple ,” but he will not apply the term spiritualization to them.22 Despite allowing the term to have some meaning, in practice he opposes every specifi c use of it, since he is unilaterally opposed to all interpretation from an “evo lutionist” viewpoint.23Klawans argues that the use of cultic metaphors signifi es affi rmation of the “te-nets” of cultic ideology:Paul affi rms many of the fundamental theological tenets upon which ancient Jew-ish sacrifi cial worship is based [such as] God’s presence in the sanctuary (1 Cor 3:16; 2 Cor 6:16). . . . Sacrifi ce is a mode of achieving close interaction between the worshiper and God (1 Cor . 9:13, 10:18). Paul also speaks of the pleasing aroma of sacrifi ce sent up to God. . . . Paul affi rms and even praises these notions.24Th is involves a confusion of the literal and the metaphorical . Sacrifi cial meta-phors do not necessarily entail affi rmation of the sacrifi cial cult, any more than the remark “as a peacemaker, Senator Mitchell works magic” affi rms a literal belief in magic. It is overly literal to claim that metapho rizing is the same as doctrinal affi rming. Metaphors are rhetorical usages, and one must attend to the in tended mean-19.

Any metaphor has a source domain and a target domain.25 “My love is a hurri cane” draws an image from the source domain of weather and ap plies it to the target domain of “my love.” It sug-gests that my feelings are uncontrollable. Eff ective metaphor utilizes a source do-main that will receive quick recognition and carry emotional force. Cultic images were highly recognizable and suggestive of solemn emotions. Paul’s use of cultic images indicates that he believes the audience will be receptive to the images , not that he believes (or disbelieves) in the literal effi cacy of the cult. Undoubtedly the image shapes the meaning, but the main point of any metaphor is in its target domain: the image is in the service to the message. To assume that Paul is affi rm-ing all the tenets of cultic ideology is to ignore the diff erence between literal and metaphorical usage.Klawans’s work is valuable, especially in giving a nuanced reading to ancient texts. He eff ectively critiques attempts to impose a single uni versal meaning on sacrifi ce in all cultures. But he oft en fails to under stand other scholars, refusing to accept that spiritualization has been used to signify several diff erent phenomena. Th e term is frequently used to signify the ascribing of new meaning to an old rit-ual, the focus on inward attitude, or the use of cultic metaphors . Klawans touches on all these phenomena when he says cultic metaphors “channel the sanctity of the temple into other realms of daily life, such as eating and praying.”26 Such ascription of new meaning to food and prayer ritual, such intensi fying of personal piety, are what many scholars mean by spiritualiza tion . I hope that my attempt to spell out the kinds of spiritualization will fulfi ll Klawans’s request for “clearer diff erentiation and schematiza tion” by scholars.27It is important to notice that “to expand the realm of holiness ”28 into other areas of life goes against one of the fundamental priestly principles, the maintenance of purity distinctions and boundaries. In priestly think ing, all things are decidedly not holy . When Paul says “you are God’s temple ” and “we are the temple ” (1 Cor 3:16; 2 Cor 6:16), he is transfer ring God’s presence from sanctuary to believers. Th is metaphor under mines the literal priestly ideology by redefi ning holiness . Paul trans forms, as much as he perpetuates, cultic patterns. His slogan could be “no ap-propriation without transformation!”Sacrifi cial metaphor does indeed show sacrifi ce to be “meaningful and sym-bolic ,”29 but also to be inadequate, or there would be no need for the changed con-dition, for the “but now”—the new disclosure of God and of the children of God (Rom 3:21; Gal 3:25–26). Some old ways are “no longer” (Gal 3:28). It is crucial to note the new meanings that are being given to the old symbols . Th e whole spiritu-alizing process is an attempt to articulate values that are deemed (by the author) to 25.

Of course, the diff erent nt authors are not identical in their usage or their thinking.Hebrews : The Sacrificial Metaphor and Anti-sacrificialismLeaving aside the many nt passages that express anti-temple senti ments, we fi nd only two or three nt books that have explicit anti-sacrifi cialism (Heb 9:8–10; 10:1–11; Matt 9:13; 12:7; possibly Acts 7:42–43, 48–50).30 Hebrews has the longest anti-sacrifi cial passage in the nt. Further, Hebrews has the strongest supersession-ist language in the nt, saying of the Mosaic covenant that “what is obsolete and growing old (παλαιούμενον καὶ γηράσκον) will soon disappear” (Heb 8:13). Th e former commandment “was weak and ineff ectual” (Heb 7:18). Th ere is now “a bet-ter covenant ” ( 7:22; 8:6), a “new covenant ” ( 9:15).Th e motives of spiritualizing in the nt diff er from work to work, but Hebrews’s31 strategy seems to change from sentence to sentence. Some times Hebrews demotes or even attacks the sacrifi cial cult ( 9:24–26; 10:2–9), yet the author will also defend its past necessity and speak of the death of Christ as a sacrifi ce more oft en than any other nt author ( 1:3; 7:27; 9:14, 26, 28; 10:10, 12; 13:10–12). Hebrews is consistent about show ing the supremacy, the fi nality, of Christ’s sacrifi ce , but struggles for a strategy for interpreting the ritual system. Is the old system inadequate and now superseded ( 7:11–12, 18; 8:6–9; 9:9–12; 10:1, 11)? Or was it or dained by God and appropriate for its time ( 5:4; 8:5; 9:23)? Was Levi’s priesthood always inferior to Melchizedek’s ( 7:7–11)? Or was the levitical priesthood valid, its activities fore-shadowing the activity of that high(er) priest according to the order of Melchize-dek ( 7:12, 20–21; 8:3)? Hebrews 9:9–15 is typical of this mixed message, stressing that the Day of Atonement rituals “deal only with food and drink” and purify only the “fl esh,” and yet arguing (upon that basis) “how much more will the blood of Christ” work redemption ( 9:10, 13–15)?32 Th e lesser eff ective ness of the Day of Atonement is used to argue for the better cleansing, the “eternal redemption” wrought by Christ (9:12). Th e old system was both prophetic and inadequate. Th e Day of Atonement ritual “is a sym bol of the present time,” but of itself it “cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper” (9:9). Th e temple , in its very inadequacy, foretells the cleansing that Jesus will accomplish. Th rough cultic repetitiveness, “the Holy Spirit indicates 30. Th e speech in Acts is directed against idolatry and rebelliousness, but an anti-sacrifi cial quote from Amos is part of the attack.31. I refer to the author of Hebrews as “Hebrews.”32. Hebrews 9:15 uses the redemption word, ἀπολύτρωσις, that Paul uses in Rom 3:24; 1 Cor 1:30, which normally refers to monetary redemption or the manumission of slaves, but which some scholars allege to have strong Exodus echoes, because of λυτρο-cognates at, for example, Deut 7:8; Isa 43:1 (David Hill, Greek Words and Hebrew Meanings: Studies in the Semantics of Soteriological Terms [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967], 55–59)."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"92Ritual and Metaphorthat the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the fi rst tent is still standing” (9:8). Th e fi rst tent was a temporary, but necessary, sign. Hebrews contains far more sacrifi cial images than the whole Pauline corpus. In one sentence it mentions the incense altar , the ark of the cove nant , “Aaron’s rod,” the tablets of the law, “the cherubim of glory,” and the “mercy seat (ἱλαστήριον)” ( 9:4–5). In the whole nt, the ἱλαστήριον is mentioned only here and at Rom 3:25. Let us note the diff erences: He brews correlates the ἱλαστήριον and numer-ous cultic details with Christ’s sacrifi ce . Paul mentions the ἱλαστήριον only in connection with two noncultic metaphors , saying that Christ is our justifi cation, our redemption, and was put forward as a ἱλαστήριον of faith (Rom 3:24–25). Paul joins his cultic metaphor with a judicial and a social metaphor , as though to say, “any one of these metaphors can picture the saving eff ect of his death; what matters is the saving result, not the particular metaphor that illu strates it.” Hebrews is committed solely to the cultic metaphor .33 Every sacrifi cial detail—blood , ashes, priest , curtain, ἱλαστήριον, cleansing—has its equivalent in Christ’s sacrifi ce. Paul uses the sacrifi cial metaphor in brief passages at climactic points in his two longest (extant) letters (1 Cor 5:7; 15:3; Rom 3:25; 5:9; 8:3). Hebrews spends whole chapters ( 5–10) spel ling out the sacrifi cial metaphor , struggling to explain exactly how Christ fulfi lls or replaces the sacrifi cial system. As regards the old and the new, Hebrews makes both connections and contrasts. Th e sacrifi cial cult could not really cleanse the conscience ( 9:9), and yet, the conscience-cleansing that Jesus brought is described in terms of ritual cleans-ing: “hearts sprinkled clean” and “bodies washed with pure water ” ( 10:22). The ap-proach to God is not just pictured as sacri fi ce ; it is understood in sacrifi cial terms. Th e saving death is con ceived as a combination of a consecration sacrifi ce that marks the begin ning of a priest’s tenure and a sacrifi ce for sins: “we have been sanctifi ed through the off ering of the body of Jesus Christ . . . a single sacrifi ce for sins” ( 10:10, 12). Hebrews reasons about spiritual reality on the basis of material real ity: “if the blood of goats and bulls” can sanctify the fl esh, then the blood of Christ can “pu-rify our conscience from dead works” ( 9:13–14). Sacrifi cial blood has a purifying eff ect.34 Th e cultic principle governs the au thor’s interpretation of what Christ did: “we have confi dence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus , by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his fl esh)” ( 10:19–20). Th is is most unlike Paul, who never turns a sacrifi cial metaphor into a point-by-point allegory. Paul uses one point of contact (blood ) to form the meta-phor , but he is equally happy in making other metaphors that emphasize other aspects of what Jesus accomplished—the freeing eff ect of Christ’s act suggests the 33. Even the confl ation of sacrifi cial and redemption imagery at Heb 9:12, 15 represents a common understanding of sacrifi ce; it is not a stand-alone redemption metaphor , as is the image in 1 Cor 6:20; 7:23. 34.

Paul knew that the redemption metaphor —picturing sal-vation through the lan guage of manumission—would have a particular appeal to the slaves and former slaves in his audience. Paul seems to be more practical and pastoral than Hebrews , less attached to his imagery . Th e source domains that Paul uses have less control over his message than does the single source domain that Hebrews uses. And yet, Hebrews has a long anti-sacrifi cial passage. Th e law on sa crifi ces was “only a shadow”; it could “never . . . make perfect those who approach” ( 10:1). Sac-rifi ces have to be performed over and over; if sacri fi ce really cleansed people, the sacrifi cial system would have come to an end ( 10:2). A tone of disdain is sounded: “it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins” ( 10:4). Christ himself is said to cite the anti-sacrifi cial Ps 40:6–8: “when Christ came into the world, he said, ‘Sacrifi ces and off erings you have not desired . . . in burnt off ering s and sin off erings , you have taken no pleasure’ ” ( 10:5–6). Th e psalmist’s prom ise “I have come to do your will, O God” is contrasted with “sacri fi ces and off erings ” ( 10:7–8), leading to the remark that Christ “abolishes the fi rst in order to estab-lish the second” ( 10:9). And yet, what imme diately follows speaks of Christ as an “o ff ering ,” a “sacrifi ce for sins,” whose blood provides entrance to the sanctuary ( 10:10, 12, 19).Th e anti-sacrifi cial passage in Hebrews ends up serving the purpose of affi rm-ing the replacement value of Christ’s sacrifi ce . Evidently it was the plurality of sac-rifi ces that God and Christ were rejecting in Ps 40, not sacrifi ce itself. Christ’s sac-rifi ce is “once for all” and conscience cleansing, replacing the repeated and merely fl esh cleansing sacrifi ces .Hebrews had begun with a sacrifi cial pattern—Christ “made purifi ca tion for sins” in 1:3—and he ends with it, “by the blood of the eternal covenant ,” in 13:20. Hebrews accepts that “not even the fi rst cove nant was inaugurated without blood ” ( 9:18), and that Christ “ap peared once for all at the end of the age to remove sin by the sacrifi ce of himself ” ( 9:26). Despite the rejectionist material in chapter 10, Hebrews’s soteriology is wholly based in the sacrifi cial pattern. In this way, there is more continuity than discontinuity between the old and new covenants , for Hebrews. Th e law may provide only a sha dow ( 10:1), but it is a shadow that looms over the whole new covenant . Th e image of sacrifi ce is not spir-itualized and dissipated, it is spiritua lized and resolidifi ed. Th ere is a new sacrifi ce , just not the repeated ones. Access to God is through a cultic action undertaken on our behalf ( 10:19–20), not by any moral change or repentance on our part. Yet the incarna tion of Christ has profound moral and participative signifi cance; he can “sympathize with our weaknesses” ( 4:15). Ethics of the Incarnation For Hebrews , the incarnation of the Son has an ethical foundation that spills over into believers’ lives. Christ’s qualifi cation for high priesthood is that he “in every respect has been tested as we are,” and so can “deal gently with the ignorant and"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"94Ritual and Metaphorwayward” ( 4:15; 5:2). What legitimizes Christ’s priesthood is that he participated compassionately in human life, being “subject to weakness,” having to supplicate God, and even “learn[ing] obedience through what he suff ered” ( 5:2, 7, 8). Th is is a pro found and revolutionary idea, that God (more precisely, the divine Son of God) had to become like other human beings! Th ere is little more than a hint of this any-where else in the nt (perhaps in Luke 24:26; John 1:11; 11:33–35; Gal 4:4).Th e incarnation has as one of its purposes, then, the sharing of human experi-ence, so that the Son might fully understand human suff ering: “Be cause he himself was tested by what he suff ered, he is able to help those who are being tested” ( Heb 2:18). It was not unprecedented, but it certainly was daring, to assert that God has pity on weak human beings. What was unheard of was that the divine had to be “tested,” subjugated, and made “perfect through suff erings” ( 4:15; 5:2; 2:10). Jesus had to expe rience these things. He was “crowned with glory” precisely “because [διά plus accusative] of the suff ering of death” ( 2:9).In Hebrews , the incarnational concept (God coming to share human expe-rience) is bound to the sacrifi cial concept. Th e incarnation has a participatory purpose and a substitutionary purpose, enabling the divine “high priest ” to both understand and to stand for human beings. Sharing human suff ering and weakness empowers him to understand and have sympathy for human beings, spiritually. Faithfully enduring the test ( 2:18; 3:2) and being “without blemish” ( 9:14; cf. 4:15) qualify him to stand for them, cultically. Hebrews does not distinguish the spiritual and the cultic, as I have done. The ethical and transformative results come directly from the cultic action: “the blood of Christ” purifies and redeems ( 9:14–15). Th e compassionate and cultic functions of the incarnation are welded into one: Christ becomes like mortals “so that he might be a mer ciful and faithful high priest ” able “to make a sacrifi ce of atonement for the sins of the people” ( 2:17).35Ethical transformation comes in a cultic vehicle, and disrespect for the gospel is a cultic infraction: “profan[ing] the blood of the covenant ,” which will lead to the Lord’s vengeance—“a fearful thing” ( 10:29, 31). Yet Hebrews makes brilliant observations about the ethical signifi cance of the incarnation . Although Paul’s metaphorical repertoire is more so phisticated and less repetitive than Hebrews’s, it is the latter who is able to express the concept of the Son’s incarnation being a deep participation in human life and its many tests.Ironic Sacrifice That Ends All Sacrifice?Hebrews uses cruder images of sacrifi ce than Paul, but does this mean that he is more literal-minded about sacrifi ce , or more ironic? Is he per haps undermining the whole idea of sacrifi ce and priesthood , as Timothy Radcliff e suggests? Radcliff e points out that the purity system makes sharp binary distinctions, but in Hebrews, “God’s holiness is disclosed in laying hold of its opposite,” even Christ’s “corpse 35.

Th e levitical priest entered the holy of holies alone, but in Hebrews “we all fl ock in”; instead of being de fi ned by separateness, “Christ’s priesthood [is] derived from his solidar ity with us.”37 Th ese are astute observations, but we need to notice the binary distinctions Hebrews does make. In chapter 7 alone, there is a distinction between having/not having genealogy, be-tween inferior and superior, legitimacy coming from “physical descent” versus its coming from “indestructible life” ( 7:16), weak law versus better hope, dying as op-posed to undying, daily sacrifi ces versus “once for all” ( 7:27), and priests “subject to weakness” contrasted with “a Son who has been made perfect forever” ( 7:28). Christ, the “undefi led” priest , is “separated from sinners” in 7:26, which off ers a strong challenge to Radcliff e’s thesis.Hebrews may be inverting cultic principles, but the inversion still has a cul-tic shape. A better thesis would be that Hebrews is trying to unify two diff erent threads of thought, one that rejects sacrifi cial cult, and one (the dominant thread) that reenshrines sacrifi cial theology in highly abstract and symbolic form. Cultic ways of thinking are retained. Th e sacrifi cial death of the great high priest opened a way into “the inner shrine” ( 6:19). Cultic principles are still operative, blood still had to be shed. As below, so above. Th e “heavenly things” may need “better sacri-fi ces ” ( 9:23), but a better sacrifi ce is still a sacrifi ce—at least conceptually. Th ere is a priest , a ritual death, an entrance into a sanctuary with blood, a purifi cation .Supersession and TransitionHebrews quotes an anti-sacrifi cial psalm in order to make a Platonizing distinc-tion between the real spiritual realm and the shadowy physical realm. Th e temple is “a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one” ( 8:5). Th e author demotes the physi-cal and promotes the spiritual, yet uses the former to argue about the latter: “under the law almost everything is purifi ed with blood . . . . Th us it was necessary for the sketches of the heavenly things to be purifi ed with these rites, but the heav-enly things themselves need better sacrifi ces than these” ( 9:22–23). Platonizing con ceptualization enables one to criticize, transform, and preserve the idea of sac-rifi ce . Spiritualization is all about reconceptualization and revaluation.Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza rightly points out that spiritualization always in-volves a focus on the inner life,38 but the remark that this is meant “to spell out the end of all sacrifi cial, priestly cults”39 needs to be qualifi ed so as not to overlook symbolic sacrifi ce . Hebrews’s spiritualization could easily lend itself to the estab-lishment of a priestly cult with spiritualized (metaphorical) sacrifi ce.36.

Th e “way into the sanctuary” could not be “disclosed as long as the fi rst tent is still standing” ( 9:8). Th e old covenant is “obsolete” ( 8:13). Th ere is “a change in the priesthood” (7:12); “the abrogation of an earlier com-mandment” (7:18); “a better hope” (7:19); “a better covenant” (7:22; 8:6); “a new covenant” (8:13; 9:15); “the greater and perfect tent” (9:11) in eight passages. “Sacri-fi ces and off erings ” can be contrasted with doing God’s will, and “he abolishes the fi rst in order to establish the second” ( 10:8–9). Th ere is a better mediator than Moses, a better priest than Aaron ( 3:3; 7:11). Th e old way is obsolete; it has been superseded.Cortez says Hebrews is reaching for a personalist viewpoint and “presents the Day of Atonement primarily as a ‘parable’ of the transition from the ‘present’ to the coming age.”40 I would add that Hebrews him self is in transition from a cul-tic way of thinking to an ethical and perso nalist view, but the transition is not particularly successful. Despite the attempt to reach anti-cultic thinking, a ritual-izing mentality persists. Th e earthly and cultic levels still dominate the heavenly and spiritual levels. Th ere is still a violent God brooding over the process with “a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fi re that will consume the adversa ries” (10:27). In fact, backsliders now will have a worse fate than in the time of Moses: “much worse punishment . . . will be deserved by those who have spurned the Son of God” (10:29).Th is is why it is so unconvincing to claim that Hebrews overthrows sa crifi cial thinking. It is more accurate to say that the author plants seeds of thought that do lead logically to concepts of God as nonsacrifi cial, nonviolent, and nonretributive, but that the author himself was unable to stay with those ideas, reverting instead to sacrifi cial and retaliatory notions. Recognizing God as thoroughly personal and loving will even tually lead to an end of thinking of salvation in cultic categories of clean sing and submission. Once sacrifi cial thinking has really been left be hind, the noncoercive nature of God will emerge as the only rational alternative. Hebrews goes a little distance down that road by speaking of being freed from repeated sacrifi ces , and enhancing the cultic concept by adding the notion of the compas-sionate and participatory mission of the Son. But access to a potentially retaliatory God still requires a blood sacri fi ce : it was “necessary (ἀναγκαῖον) for this priest also to have some thing to off er” ( 8:3). A Discourse of Progress within Continuity Hebrews is inconsistent regarding the degree of continuity or discontinu ity be-tween the earthly and heavenly levels. Paul, on the other hand, gladly uses the sacrifi cial concept to picture the Messiah’s death, but neither derides the cult, nor 40. Felix H. Cortez, “From the Holy to the Most Holy Place: Th e Period of Hebrews 9:6–10 and the Day of Atonement as a Metaphor of Transition,” JBL 125 (2006): 527–47 (547); “the old covenant . . . is too external” (546)."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"97Finlan: Spiritualization of Sacrifice in Paul and Hebrewsgives it a heavenly counterpart. Paul says less, and says it more eff ectively. But both are expressing a concept of partial continuity between old and new.Despite its sometimes sharp dualism, the spiritualization in Hebrews is really a strategy of moderation. Spiritualization is a discourse of progress within continuity. It demonstrates gradual conceptual change, but some approaches are less gradual than others. Paul, who makes fewer connections to the details of the old cult, has more freedom to make conceptual changes than Hebrews does. Having neither denigrated nor idealized the cult, Paul is not wedded to the cultic image as either foil or model. What consumes Paul’s attention is the reversal of the shame of the crucifi xion , the irony of the one who was shamed now be ing at God’s right hand. Th e one who was dead lives and is the source of life. Th is empowers his many ob-servations of reversal, of strength in weakness (2 Cor 12:10), of Christ bringing a blessing by becoming a curse (Gal 3:13).

Th ird, I will provide some closing observations on early Christian reticence toward applying the idea of the priesthood to the Chris-tian community. A Methodological PointPrior to the 1970s, New Testament scholars largely preferred the term spiritualiza-tion to describe the process by which the physical and earthly realities of temple , sacrifi ce , and priesthood were reinterpreted in noncultic contexts and applied to immaterial or spiritual realities. Th e ap propriateness of this term, however, has been challenged recently.1 Georg Klinzing was one of the fi rst to consciously move away from this word, choosing instead the term Umdeutung, or “reinterpreta-tion.”2 A few years later, Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza argued that the word spiri-tualization had come to embody such a wide range of meanings that “its use tends not to clarify but to confuse.”3 Moreover, she maintained that the term was oft en used in a derogatory and anti-cultic sense, since the move to “spiritualize ” cultic ideas served to highlight the importance of the inner or spiritual reality at the ex-pense of the material or earthly. In its place, she proposed the more neutral term transference to indicate that “Jewish and Hellenistic cultic concepts were shift ed to designate a reality which was not cultic.”4 More recently, Jonathan Klawans has proposed the term borrowing as a way to describe the shift from cultic to non-cultic contexts, as this term presupposes the continuing validity of the original reference point.5Th ese concerns are valid, and for this reason the term spiritualization will be 1.

In its place, I will use a variety of terms such as application, transfer-ence, reinterpretation, and the like.Temple , Sacrifice, Priesthood , and the Cultic CenterTh e Jewish cultic system can be summarized under three headings: tem ple , sacri-fi ce , and priesthood .6 Th e centrality of these three categories for Jewish religious life is stated explicitly by Josephus :We have but one temple for the one God (for like ever loveth like), common to all as God is common to all. Th e priests are continually engaged in His wor ship, under the leadership of him who for the time is head of the line. With his col-leagues he will sacrifi ce to God, safeguard the laws, adjudicate in cases of dispute, punish those convicted of crime. (Ag. Ap. 2.193–94)7It is diffi cult to overestimate the importance of the Jerusalem Temple to Jewish life in the fi rst century c.e.8 Its importance rested primarily on the understanding that this was the chosen dwelling place par excellence of the God of Israel. As a result, the Temple was seen as sacrosanct, and throngs of pilgrims converged triannually on the city and Temple from around the known world. As caretakers of the Temple and offi ciants of its cult, the priests were responsible for mediating the presence of God to the people and carrying the people’s intercession before God. Since the priestly offi ce could be acquired only through proper lineage, only a select few within the larger Jewish population could serve as priests before the God of Israel.9 At the heart of this sanctuary lay the sacrifi cial system. Th e daily off erings brought by the priests helped maintain the special relationship between the Jewish people and their God. Aug menting these daily off ering s were sacrifi ces brought by the people for the purposes of forgiveness and atonement .10 Th ough all of this would have been more palpable for those who lived in close proximity to the Temple , it is clear from Josephus and other sources that Diaspora Jews also felt a special affi nity toward and obligation to the maintenance of the temple cult. Th is devotion to the Jerusalem sanctuary is seen most clearly in the annual half-shekel temple tax sent to Jerusalem by Dias pora Jews.116. See E. P.

Th e earliest explicit applica-tion of cultic terminology to the Christian move ment is found in 1 Cor 3:16–17, where Paul asks of the Corinthians: “Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God’s temple , God will destroy that person. For God’s temple is holy , and you are that temple .” Th e impor-tance of this community-as-temple idea within the early Christian movement is clear from other Christian documents that develop this theme (e.g., Mark 14:58; Acts 15:16; 2 Cor 6:16–18; Eph 2:20–22; 1 Pet 2:4–8; Rev 3:12; Barn. 4:11; 6:15–16; Ign. Eph. 9:1; 15:3; Magn. 7:2; Tral l. 7:2; Phld. 7:2; Herm. Vis. 3.3). Th is borrowing of temple language held important implications for the early Christian church; it was a declaration of God’s abiding presence with and in them, an understanding which necessitated individual and communal holiness . Moreover, Paul and other early Christians could and did use this temple language to argue for the inclu-sion of Gentiles within the Christian community, for God was now understood to dwell among the Christian community comprised of both Jews and Gentiles. Dated to the early- to mid-50s c.e., 1 Corinthians provides the earliest explicit case for the rise of this conception in the early Christian imagination.12It is likely, however, that this idea originated much earlier. In Gal 2:9, Paul refers to the leaders of the Jerusalem church, James, Cephas, and John , as those “reputed to be pillars” (οἱ δοκοῦντες στῦλοι εἶναι). Th ough the referent for the word pillars has been disputed, the most likely idea is that these early apostles were understood to be pillars in the new com munal Christian temple .13 Intriguingly, Paul’s discom-fort with the term στῦλοι being applied to the apostles, seen in his use of the term δοκοῦντες, suggests that this terminology was a well-known designation in early Christianity. It also reveals that the idea of the Christian community as a temple belongs to pre-Pauline Christianity and is not merely a Pauline novelty. Paul’s ref-erence to the Jerusalem apostles as pillars, without any qualifi cation or explana-tion, assumes that his readers know what he is talking about, even in a location as far from Jerusalem as the church in Galatia. Since Galatians is usually dated between 49 and 52 c.e., we fi nd in this letter contemporaneous, or even slightly earlier, evidence for the idea of members of the Christian community as a temple .14 Moreover, the unambiguous application of pillar terminology to the apostles sug-12. See Gordon Fee, Th e First Epistle to the Corinthians (NICNT; Grand Rapids: Eerd-mans, 1987), 4–5; Joseph Fitzmyer, First Corinthians (AB 32; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008), 41–43.13. See Wardle, Jerusalem Temple , 207–10.14. Th is dating depends, of course, on the position one takes in the “north” versus “south” Galatian argument. For reasons enumerated by Richard N. Longenecker, Galatians (WBC 41; Dallas: Word, 1990), lxxiii–lxxxviii, and Paul Barnett, Th e Birth of Christianity: Th e First Twenty Years (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2005), 206–10, I follow the south Galatia hypothe sis, which would place the writing of the letter in the late 40s c.e. But my conclu-sions are not dramatically aff ected even if one holds to the north Galatia theory, as Gal 2"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"103Wardle: Who Is Sacrificing?gests that the beginnings of the identifi cation of the Christian community as a temple occurred much earlier than the writing of this letter. Th ough impossible to date precisely, it seems safe to conclude that this idea of the early apostles as pillars, and thus of the Christian community as a temple , must have arisen, at the latest, by the early- to mid-40s c.e.The Reapplication of the Idea of SacrificeTh e fi rst explicit application of sacrifi cial language to the Christian com munity occurs approximately one decade later. In a move similar to that already begun in the Old Testament (e.g., Pss 50:13–14, 23; 51:16–17; 141:2; Hos 6:6; Mic 6:6–8) and continued at Qumran (e.g., 1QS 9.3–5; 10.6; 4QFlor 1.6–7), many of the early Christians began to transfer sacrifi cial terminology into their own community and way of life, seeing prayer, obedience, and a life devoted to God as effi cacious in a way formerly reserved for animal sacrifi ces in the temple (e.g., Acts 10:4; Rom 12:1, 15:16; Phil 2:17; 4:18; 2 Tim 4:6; Heb 13:15–16; Rev 8:3–4). Once again, Paul is our earliest example of this move to reinterpret sacrifi cial lan guage, as the ideol-ogy and language of sacrifi ce and cult off ered to him important terminology with which to describe not only the crucifi xion of Jesus (e.g., 1 Cor 5:7 ; 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 3:25), but also the resultant commu nity of believers in Jesus . Th e earliest explicit equation of sacrifi cial lan guage with Paul and the broader Christian community is found in Phi lippians and Romans . In Phil 2:17, Paul states: “But even if I am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifi ce and the off ering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you,” and in Rom 12:1 Paul admonishes the Romans to “present your bodies as a living sacrifi ce , holy and accepta ble to God, which is your spiritual worship.” Since most scholars date these two letters to the mid- to late 50s c.e., it appears that at least by this time Paul had begun to transfer the idea of sacrifi ce to the commu nity, since he explicitly links his own actions and the activities of the Roman believers with the sacrifi cial cult. Appropriation of the Idea of the Priesthood Historically speaking, the categories of sacrifi ce and priest go hand in hand. Some-one had to off er the sacrifi ce, and that person is usually un derstood to be a priest . Paul moves in the direction of linking priest and sacrifi ce in Rom 15:16 when he speaks of his own ministry to the Gentiles in sacerdotal terms, declaring his inten-tion to be “a minister (λειτουργός) of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service (ἱερουργοῦνται) of the gospel of God, so that the off ering (προσφορά) of the Gentiles may be ac ceptable, sanctifi ed by the Holy Spirit.”15 Th ough Paul here clearly im plies that his work among the Gentiles has a priestly quality to it, it is would still be one of the earliest examples of Christian attribution of temple terminology to the commu nity.15. On this, see Paula Fredriksen, “Paul, Purity, and the Ekklesia of the Gentiles,” in Begin nings of Christianity (Jerusalem: Yad ben Zvi, 2005), 213–14."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"104Ritual and Metaphorsignifi cant that he does not explicitly use the term priest to describe himself and his ministry, only that he is performing an activity usually reserved for priests . Th e author of Hebrews writes similarly, using cultic and priestly terminology to describe the readers of this book (e.g., προσέρχεσθαι [“to approach”], εἰσέρχεσθαι [“to enter”], τελειοῦν [“to per fect”]). Scholer has argued that the application of this priestly terminol ogy to the book’s readers indicates that they should, in fact, be under stood to be priests .16 It is striking, however, that though the book does employ language usually reserved for the priesthood , it never explicitly applies the terms priest or priesthood to the community. Th e same reticence that we saw in Rom 15:16 applies to the book of Hebrews: no where in these books are the mem-bers of the Christian community ever explicitly designated as priests .Indeed, it is noteworthy that the fi rst explicit transfer of priestly termi nology to the community does not occur until 1 Peter , usually dated to the 80s c.e., where the author asserts in 2:5 and 2:9 that the Christian community is to be a “holy priesthood ” and a “royal priest hood .”17 In naming the early Christians as a “holy 16.

Since the dating of this epistle is an impor tant aspect of this essay, I will rehearse the salient arguments pointing toward its pseudo nymity and a date of composition in the post-70 c.e. period. In this discussion I am largely reliant on Paul Achtemeier, 1 Peter (Hermeneia; Minneapolis: Augsburg, 1996), 43–50; Eugene Boring, 1 Peter (ANTC; Nashville: Abingdon, 1999), 30–34; John H. Elliott, 1 Peter (AB 37B; New York: Doubleday, 2000), 118–38. Achtemeier (1 Peter, 48–50) sug-gests the early 80s c.e. as the most plausible date of composition, while Elliott (1 Peter, 136–38) more cautiously suggests somewhere in the range of 73 to 92 c.e. Th ough carrying the name of Peter, nothing beyond the opening reference connects this letter to the apostle himself. Th e polished Greek style and use of classical rhetoric and vocabulary, along with the numerous citations from the Septuagint rather than the Hebrew Bible, strongly sug-gest that the au thor of 1 Peter was someone other than the Hebrew - or Aramaic-speaking fi sherman from Galilee. In an attempt to ameliorate these diffi culties, some have argued that Silvanus functioned as Peter’s amanuensis. Th is argument is based on 1 Pet 5:12, which states that the author wrote “through” or “by means of ” Silvanus (διὰ Σιλουανοῦ). As Elliott notes, however, a “decisive body of evidence” points away from Silvanus as Peter’s scribe and toward Silvanus being the courier or bearer of this letter, since the conventional for-mula “I/We have written through X” almost always refers to the one carrying the letter, not the one who wrote it (Elliott, 1 Peter, 872). Other evidence as well suggests a post-70 c.e. dating for this document. First, the author’s use of Babylon as a reference for Rome in 5:12 points in this direction, for this attribution only occurs in Jewish literature which postdates the destruction of the Temple in 70 c.e. Second, the book refers to some type of persecution endured by the recipients of the letter in Asia Minor. While this suff ering is certainly not linked to any offi cial or empire-wide persecution, Christians in Asia Minor do appear to have experienced episodic persecutions under Domitian (81–96 c.e.) and Trajan (97–117 c.e.). In a suggestive piece of correspondence between Trajan and Pliny the Younger from around 111 c.e., Pliny writes that some people accused of being Christians had recanted—twenty-fi ve years earlier. Th is implies that some type of persecution broke out against the Christians in Asia Minor around 85 c.e., and that some had given up on the Christian faith during this time. Whether this is the suff ering alluded to in 1 Peter is unclear, but it adds"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"105Wardle: Who Is Sacrificing?priesthood ,” 1 Pet 2 goes beyond anything previously seen in the New Testament, for it transfers to the Christian community not only the Temple and sacrifi ces associated with Israel’s cult, but also arrogates the priesthood to itself.18 Th ough the immediate result of this move is that the metaphor becomes mixed, since the Christian community is described as both a spiritual house as well as a body of priests , the eff ect is clear, for it is now within this new temple that a holy priest-hood may now off er acceptable spiri tual sacrifi ces to God through Jesus Christ ( 2:5).19 Th is equation of the Christian community with the priesthood also oc curs twice in the mid-90s c.e. in the book of Revelation.20 In Rev 1:6 the application of priestly terminology to Christian believers is made even more directly than in 1 Peter , since the author states that Jesus has made the Christians “to be a king-dom, priests serving his God and Fa ther.”21 With two caveats, the claim in Rev 1:6 is reiterated in 5:10, as the blood of the lamb has made it possible for the saints to be “a kingdom and priests serving our God.” First, membership in this kingdom and priesthood is now explicitly open to Gentiles, for they have been culled “from every tribe and language and people and nation” ( 5:9).22 Second, it is said that “they will reign” on the earth. Th e eschatological ramifi ca tions of this are clear throughout the book, as much of the priestly ser vice performed by Christians takes place in a future context (see 7:15; 20:6; 22:3–4). Revelation, however, claims this status as both a present and future reality, as the followers of Jesus have already been made into priests (ἐποίησεν [“he made”; 1:6], ἐποίησας [“you have made”; 5:10]).23First Peter and Revelation , then, are the earliest instances in which mem bers further credence to the argument that 1 Peter was written in the post-70 era, and likely sometime in the 80s c.e.18.

It is also possible to render this phrase a “kingdom of priests,” as ἱερεῖς is in apposi-tion to βασιλείαν. In 5:10, however, this is not a possibility, as a καὶ separates βασιλείαν and ἱερεῖς. See Gregory Stevenson, Power and Place: Temple and Identity in the Book of Revela-tion (BZNW 107; Berlin: de Gruyter, 2001), 239.22. Cf. Martha Himmelfarb, A Kingdom of Priests: Ancestry and Merit in Ancient Juda-ism (Phila delphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006), 139–42. Himmelfarb notes the diff erence between the worldviews of John and the sectarians at Qumran . According to her, the sectarians began down the path of emphasizing merit over ancestry in the Community Rule, but John took the idea of merit to its logical conclusion when he included Gentiles as priests of God. 23. Stevenson, Power and Place, 240. An interesting textual variant also lends weight to the present reality of this new identity.

Since both are commonly dated to the end of the fi rst century c.e. (somewhere in the 80s and 90s c.e.), this means that the transfer of spe cifi c priestly terminology to the Christian community occurred approx imately three decades aft er the appropriation of sacri-fi cial language to the community and four decades aft er the application of temple terminol ogy to the early Christian movement. What I will now explore in more detail is the reasons for this striking reticence toward applying the idea of the priesthood to the Christian community. If the tem-ple , sacrifi ces , and priesthood were such essential elements of the Jewish cult, why does the application of priestly identity to the Christian community lag so far be-hind the transfer of the idea of temple and sacrifi ces? My argument, in brief, is that while there were precedents in Second Temple Judaism for alternative temples and sacri fi ces, no similar precedent existed for a similar appropriation of the “priest-hood .” In order to illustrate this point, I will focus on three Jewish temples , namely, the Samaritan Temple on Mount Gerizim, the Oniad Temple at Leontopolis , and the sectarian “temple of men” at Qumran , which were founded as alternatives to the Temple in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period. The Samaritan Temple on Mount GerizimIn Ant. 11.323–324 , Josephus informs his readers that the founding of the Samari-tan Temple on Mount Gerizim occurred in the middle of the fourth century b.c.e., when Sanballat petitioned Alexander the Great for permission to build a rival temple to that in Jerusalem . Josephus ’ account of the building of this temple , how-ever, contains several problems, not least of which is his assertion that the building of the Samaritan Temple occurred in nine months, an astonishingly short period of time for such a monumental building (Ant. 11.324–325, 342). Recent excava-tions by Yitzhak Magen have confi rmed that Josephus confused the chronology, since Magen has uncovered the remains of a Samaritan temple dating to the fi ft h century b.c.e., one hundred years prior to the arrival of Alexander the Great and Josephus ’ claim for the origins of this temple .24 Additionally, Magen unearthed hundreds of thousands of bone fragments in and around the sacred precincts on Mount Gerizim, confi rming that sacrifi ces were off ered in this temple .25 With the founding of the Samaritan Temple now dated to the fi ft h cen tury b.c.e., we have scant literary evidence to explain the moti va tions behind its construction. Our most important clue comes from Neh 13:28, where it is noted that Nehemiah drove away from Jeru salem the grandson of the high priest Eliashib, who had mar-ried the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, the governor of Samaria .26 Nehe miah’s Herrschaft s- und Priestermotiv in der Apokalypse (NTAbh 7; Münster, Germany: Aschen-dorff , 1972), 73–75. 24.

According to Ezra 10:18–24, those involved in exogam ous relationships included many prominent priests and Levites , includ ing the sons of Jeshua, the fi rst high priest of the Persian era. Even though Josephus was misinformed as to the date of the tem ple’s construc-tion, he agrees with the idea that members of the high priestly family in Jerusalem were involved with the Gerizim temple , although he denigrates their position and downplays their importance. In Ant. 11.302–347, Josephus reports that Manasseh , the brother of the high priest Jaddua, married Nikaso, the daughter of the Sa-maritan governor Sanballat . Expressing unease at this marriage between the high priestly family and a foreigner, the elders of Jerusalem presented Manas seh with a choice: either divorce his wife or lose his privileges and respon sibilities in the Temple and its service (11.308). Hearing this, Sanbal lat promised Manasseh the high priestly offi ce of the temple to be built on Mount Gerizim (11.310). Accord-ing to Josephus , Manasseh ac cepted Sanballat’s off er, and other priests and Levites similarly entan gled in marriages with Samaritan women followed Manasseh to Samaria (11.324). If members of the high priestly family from Jerusalem were now in stalled as the high priests on Mount Gerizim, a claim which is hinted at in Nehemiah and made explicit in Josephus , then there is little reason to believe that their liturgical or halakhic practices would have diverged widely from each other. Rather, similar circumstances likely prevailed in their respective performance of the sacrifi cial cult, as both would have derived their understandings from the Pentateuch and family tradition.27 Moreover, the presence of Samaritan high priests with an im-peccable Jewish pedigree provides a likely explanation for the destruction of the Samaritan Temple in the wake of the Hasmonean rise to power in Jeru salem . Th e Hasmoneans were relative newcomers on the scene, and their usurpation of the Zadokite and Oniad line in Jerusalem meant that the Samaritan high priests could now claim a more illustrious and ancient lineage than could the Hasmoneans . Hyrcanus’s destruction of the Sama ritan Temple may very well reveal the threat that the Samaritan high priesthood posed for the newly established Hasmonean high priesthood .In sum, in the case of the Samaritan Temple , what we see is a diff er ent temple and alternate sacrifi ces , but the same priesthood . Th e heredi tary instinct in Juda-ism for the priesthood remained unchanged, even with the emergence of a new temple and sacrifi cial system.27.

Josephus , our main source of in-formation regarding its origins, provides contradictory accounts of its founding. Whereas in the Jewish War Josephus asserts that it was Onias III who established this temple (J.W. 7.423 ), in Antiquities he unequivocally states that it was Onias IV (Ant. 12.237–39, 387 ). Th ough it is almost certain that Onias IV was the one who fl ed to Egypt and founded this temple , which Onias was involved in the founding of this temple is of little importance for our purposes here.28 What is important is that a member of the Oniad and high priestly family line retreated to Egypt and there established a temple alternative to that in Jerusalem . Much less is known of this temple than is known of the Samaritan sanctuary. A few excavations were carried out at Leontopolis in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Th e most extensive work was undertaken by Flinders Petrie, who claimed to have discovered the re mains of this ancient Jewish temple , as well as a fortress to protect the site, a Jewish cemetery, and bones from burnt sacri-fi ces .29 Flinders Petrie also claimed that Onias intentionally modeled his temple aft er the Solo monic sanctuary , for the dimensions of the Oniad temple were al-most exactly half that of the earlier temple , built on a 2:1 scale. Flinders Petrie’s fi ndings, however, have been contested by a number of scholars, with one even referring to his fi ndings as “le misérable édifi ce de M. Petrie.”30 Unfortunately, Flinders Petrie’s fi ndings can today be neither confi rmed nor denied, as the site has been damaged to such an extent that any hope of identifying the remains of this temple have long since vanished. What also remains unclear is the extent to which Egyptian Jews used, or were even aware of, Onias’ Temple at Leontopolis . Th e paucity of references to this temple in Egyptian Jewish literature sug gests that this temple had little impact on Egyptian Jews, nor was it likely ever considered a serious rival to the Jerusalem Temple . Regardless of its impact on the Egyptian Jewish population, this temple survived for nearly 250 years before the Roman succeeded in shuttering it following their suppression of the Jewish revolt in Judea in 66–70 c.e., at least ac cording to Josephus (J.W. 7.433–435). Even so, Josephus reveals that sometime in the middle of the second century c.e. the high priest and heir apparent to the Temple in Jeru salem left Judea and founded a temple at Leontopolis , one accompanied by a sacrifi cial system.31 And yet, analogous to the Samaritan Temple , no attempt was made to initiate a new 28.

Rather, this temple was similarly founded by a member of Jerusalem ’s high priestly family.The “Temple of Men” at Qumran Th e sectarians at Qumran were responsible for the construction of a third alterna-tive temple in the Second Temple period. In contrast to the Sama ritan and Oniad temples , this temple was neither a physical building nor was it accompanied by the institution of animal sacrifi ces . Rather, the sectarians at Qumran came to view their community as a metaphorical “temple of men,” a substitute sanctuary in which pleasing sacrifi ces could be off ered to God sans the blood of animals .A full account of the origins of the Qumran community cannot be given here. One thing that is clear, however, is that the community’s separation from Jerusa-lem was predicated, at least partially, on the com munity’s strong disapproval with the priests who controlled the Jerusa lem Temple . Th e full extent of these priestly transgressions is not clear, though specifi c reference is made to halakhic disputes, calendrical diff er ences, and their greedy and selfi sh dispositions.32 Th e illegitimacy of these priests in the eyes of the Qumranic sectarians meant that the sacri fi ces performed in this Temple were off ered in vain. Impure priests off ered ineffi cacious sacrifi ces . Th e construction of a communal, metaphorical temple appears to have been in direct response to the community’s belief that the Jerusalem Temple had been defi led by the current high priesthood . Th is separation from Jerusalem and the Temple appears to have been temporary; at the appropriate time these separatists would one day again join with other Jews in the worship of the God of Israel in Je-rusalem . In the meantime, the sectarians at Qumran replaced participation in the Jerusalem Temple and its cult with the belief that their community now comprised a “holy house for Aaron ” and a “temple of men,” and that the “off erings of the lips” and the “perfectness of behavior” were now acceptable as off erings to the God of Israel (1QS 9.4–6; 4Q174 1–3 i 6).33Th e intense preoccupation with priestly matters at Qumran suggests to many scholars that many of the members of the Qumran community were themselves priests .34 Indeed, there are hundreds of references to priests in the scrolls.35 Th e 32. Although diff ering in some details, several of the sectarian documents, such as CD (4.20–5.15; 6.14–7.1), 1QpHab (8.9–9.5; 12.8–10), and 4QMMT (B 75–82, C 4–9), share this polemi cal attitude toward the Temple and priesthood in Jerusalem .33.

Sub-stantial critiques of this idea, however, have emerged in the last decade, as several scholars have argued on redaction-critical grounds that the theory of priestly , and especially Zadokite , involvement in the founding of the community has been over-blown. Metso, for exam ple, has argued that all of the references to the Zadokites in 1QS and 1QSa are the work of a later editor, and that the earliest copies of the Rule of the Community and the Rule of the Congregation make no mention of the Zadokite family.36 Claims that priestly , and especially Zadokite , concerns were not integral to the founding of the Qumran community seem overstated. Even if it is granted that the Cave 4 fragments of the Rule of the Commu nity should be dated earlier than the copy found in Cave 1, which is by no means certain, it is still the case that priestly interests are evident in the formative years of the sect. For example, 4QMMT , a document stem ming from the early days of the sect, is concerned with halakhic matters, most of which relate to the purity of the Temple and priesthood . Th is in-tense interest in the Temple and priesthood intimates that a priestly worldview lies behind this document. Additionally, the prepon derance of references to priests and sacerdotal interests in the scrolls suggests priestly infl uence in both the forma-tion and continuation of the sect. Indeed, the abiding interest in priestly matters is seen especially in the clear demarcation between the “sons of Aaron ” and the re-mainder of the community in some scrolls (e.g., 1QS 5.6; 8.5–6; 9.6; 1QSa 1.15–16, 23; 2.13; CD 1.7; 10.5). Th is diff erentiation between priest and nonpriest suggests that the importance of priestly lineage remained paramount at Qumran . Th ough the covenanters at Qumran appear to have transferred the idea of the Temple and sacrifi ces to the group at large, this same transfe rence does not appear to have ex-tended to the priesthood . Indeed, the clear distinction between priest and laity in the community suggests a strong belief that these priests currently played, or in the future would perform , an important and necessary role in the community.Points of Contact between the Three Alternative Temples Th e Samaritan , Oniad , and Qumranic temples were not entirely alike.

For our purposes we need note only one: the con struction of each of these temples was accompanied by, and legitimated through, the presence of members of the Jerusalem priestly elite, who took part in establishing the new community. In the case of the institu tion of the Samaritan and Oniad temples , a member of the high priestly family was directly involved, while at Qumran members of the Zadokite line played an infl uential role. Each of these alternative temples appears to have gained an air of authenticity due to the presence of priests with proper pedigrees. In sum, we may say that though alternative temples and sacrifi ces were actual-ized realities in the Second Temple period, alternative priest hoods were not. Dur-ing this period the Aaronic line held sole possession of the offi ce and responsibility of the Jewish priesthood . A Second Tem ple Jew could join all manner of move-ments, parties, or sects save one: the priesthood . Proper lineage made one a priest , not religious dedica tion or social ambition. Indeed, for each of the communities discussed above, transference of the priesthood to nonpriests would have under-mined the potency of legitimate priests offi ciating within one’s commu nity, for by their very presence these priests gave a sense of authority to their respective temples and sacrifi cial systems. Two Potential ExceptionsTwo potential exceptions to the idea of priestly descent, however, need to be ad-dressed. First, by 200 c.e. and extending through the re mainder of the Second Temple period, several texts describe a heavenly, angelic priesthood . Th e author of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifi ce depicts the angels as “priests of the inner sanc-tum” (4Q400 1 i 8, 17, 19) who “propi tiate his good will for all who repent of sin ” (4Q400 1 i 16).37 Other texts from this period make clear that a primary responsi-bility of these angelic priests was intercession on behalf of the righteous. In Tobit , for example, Raphael explains to Tobias and Tobit that he is one of seven angels who enters the presence of the glory of the Lord, and that he was responsible for bringing the prayers of the saints into his presence (Tob 12:12–15). Similarly, sev-eral of the angels in Enoch’s vision of the hea venly throne room are depicted as receiving the petitions of the people and bringing them before the Lord (e.g., 1 En. 9:3; 99:3; 104:1).38 Th ough these angelic priests are not oft en depicted as off er-ing sacrifi ces , on occa sion the archan gels are said to have off ered “propitiatory sacrifi ces to the Lord in behalf of all the sins of ignorance of the righteous ones” (T. L e v i 3:5). Th is interest in nonlevitical angelic priestly intercessors coalesced, at least in some circles, around the fi gure of Melchizedek. Th ough he makes only a brief ap-37. Cf. Jub. 31:14; Philo , Spec. Laws 1.66. See also Maxwell J. Davidson, Angels at Qum-ran : A Comparative Study of 1 Enoch 1–36, 72–108 and Sectarian Writings from Qumran (Sheffi eld: Sheffi eld Academic Press, 1992), 238–43.38. See Harold W. Attridge, Th e Epistle to the Hebrews (Hermeneia; Philadelphia: For-tress Press, 1989), 99–101."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"112Ritual and Metaphorpearance in the biblical narrative (Gen 14:18–20; Ps 110:4), at Qumran Melchize-dek is variously portrayed as an eschatologi cal deliverer, judge, and priest in 11QMelch , the Songs of the Sab bath Sacri fi ce, and the Visions of Amran.39 Th ough his precise role is un clear, in the last days this fi gure was expected to play a signifi -cant role in meting out justice to the wicked and ushering in a period of peace and salvation (11Q13 ii 13–19). Th e book of Hebrews also picks up on traditions surrounding the fi g ure of Melchizedek . Expressing little interest in his role as an angel or eschatological warrior, Hebrews instead focuses on Melchizedek’s status as a “priest of God Most High” in Gen 14:18. In Heb 7, the au thor of He brews argues for Jesus’ high priest-hood on the grounds that he is of the line of Melchizedek. As such, his priesthood predates, and is thus supe rior to, the levitical priesthood embodied in the sons of Aaron . Th ough Heb 7:14 explicitly states that Jesus was from the line of Judah, and not from Levi , Jesus is understood to be deserving of a greater priest hood precisely because of this, for Jesus’ connection to Mel chizedek makes his priesthood supe-rior to that of Levi. Th ese angelic and Melchizedekian priesthoods thus serve as one possi ble ex-ception to the “rule” of levitical priesthood . Some angels are portrayed as priests in the heavenly temple , involved in the worship of God and intercession for the righteous. At Qumran , some of this interest in an angelic priesthood appears to have centered on Melchizedek , while, in a somewhat diff erent manner, Hebrews portrays Jesus as a high priest by virtue of his association with this fi gure. In each case, however, the alternative priesthood that develops does not apply to a whole com munity of human beings. Only angels, or a single extraordinary human being, comprise this alternative priesthood . A second possible objection may be found in Philo . When Philo dis cusses the duties of the ordinary priests as well as that of the high priest , he makes clear that one tribe out of the twelve, the tribe of Levi , was specifi cally chosen to administer the temple cult and sacrifi cial system ( Spec. Laws 1.79). He asserts that on Pass-over , however, all of the people of Israel are “raised for that particular day to the dignity of the priest hood ,” for on this one occasion “the whole nation performs the sacred rites and acts as priest with pure hands and complete immunity” ( Spec. Laws 2.145; cf. Moses 2.224–225; QE 1.10). Philo’s transference of the priest hood to all Israelites is the fi rst time in which the idea of the priest hood is loosed from the bonds of tribal affi liation and transferred to the nation at large. In the following lines, however, Philo makes it clear that this transference of the priesthood is to be understood allegorically, not literally. Passover , he states, refers to the purifi cation of the soul, and by elevating the entire nation to the priesthood on this particular day he can argue that the Jewish people are together striving along the path to the 39. Th e relevant texts are 4Q401 11 3; 4Q401 22 3; 4Q544 3 iv 2–3; and 11Q13 . For dis-cussion of these texts, see Eric F. Mason, “You Are a Priest Forever”: Second Temple Jewish Messianism and the Priestly Christology of the Epistle to the Hebrews (STDJ 74; Leiden: Brill, 2008), 164–90."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"113Wardle: Who Is Sacrificing?purifi cation of their collective soul.40 Th ough Philo argues that the title and duties of the priesthood be extended beyond that of Aaron’s des cendants, his application of this title to all Jews is not intended as a statement of literal fact. His allegorical and temporal declaration of a universal Jewish priesthood does not, then, contra-vene the importance of levitical descent for those involved in the sacrifi cial system. As a result his application of the priesthood to the nation does not carry the same weight as the transference of the idea of the priesthood to the Christian com-munity in 1 Peter and Revelation , since these latter texts argue for a permanent, nonlevitical priesthood . The Reticence to Transfer the Idea of the Priesthoodin Early Christi anityIn this essay we have observed that the transference of cultic ideas to the Chris-tian community proceeded at various speeds. While the early Christians relatively quickly ascribed to their community the ideas of the Temple and the sacrifi cial system, they were much slower to appropriate the idea of the priesthood . In light of the alternative Jewish temples which preceded the development of the early Christian conception of the community as a temple , I would like to off er an ex-planation for the early Christian reticence to transfer the idea of the priesthood to their commu nity. Simply put, they did not do so because there was little precedent for doing so. Th e strong Jewish infl uence on earliest Christianity is likely responsi-ble for this reticence, since it was well known that eligibility for the priesthood was based on heredity and not on any other qualifi cations or desires. Th ough various groups had constructed alternative temples to that in Jerusalem and had instituted new sacrifi cial systems, the presence of prominent, and possibly Zadokite, priests in the Samaritan , Oniad , and Qumran communities was an essential component in the founding and continued existence of each of these alternative Jewish tem-ples . Th ere fore, while precedents existed for transferring the idea of the Tem ple and sacrifi cial system outside of the confi nes of the Jerusalem Temple , no such precedent existed for the idea of the priesthood . Given enough time, the early Christians may very well have begun to appropri-ate specifi c priestly terminology into their community. In deed, in Rom 15:16 Paul is already moving in this direction, and it is likely that other early Christians, as they thought about what they were doing, similarly recognized a priestly aspect in their off ering of sacrifi ces consisting of prayer, obedience, and their very lives. Alternatively, if we take the evidence of Hebrews into account, at least some in the early Christian movement made the move to ascribe the high priesthood to Jesus , understanding Jesus to be receiving their sacrifi ces and off ering them on their behalf. A similar move, however, is not explicitly made for his followers. Philo provides the lone example of the transference of the idea of the priesthood to a 40. Spec. Laws 2.147–165.

Scholer, Proleptic Priests: Priest-hood in the Epistle to the Hebrews (JSNTSup 49; Sheffi eld: Sheffi eld Academic Press, 1991), 66–71."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"114Ritual and Metaphorlarge group of people, yet he makes clear that this application of priestly identity and prerogative is restricted to Pass over and is not to be understood literally. In a Jewish context, the early Christians are the fi rst to consciously and conspicuously transfer the idea of the priesthood to an entire group of non-Levites and to under-stand this transfer as permanent. ConclusionIn this essay we have seen that Christian appropriation of the idea of the priest-hood lagged behind the similar application of temple and sacrifi cial language. In light of the preceding discussion of alternative temples constructed during the Second Temple period, I suggest that this is be cause no one had done so before. All agreed that the priesthood was hereditary, and though there were precedents for constructing alterna tive temples and performing substitute sacrifi ces , the priest-hood remained bound to pedigree.Two important developments in early Christianity hastened the eventual trans-fer of the notion of priesthood . First, the movement of early Christianity out of Palestinian Judaism and into the Gentile world meant that many of the more tra-ditional Jewish understandings, includ ing the hereditary principle of the priest-hood , likely began to lose their hold on the early Christian worldview. Second, the explicit application of priestly terminology to the Christian community did not occur until the years following the destruction of the Temple and the consequent re moval of the chief priests from their place of infl uence. Only aft er the events of 70 c.e. do we see the assertion that all believers in Jesus were priests . Th at this did not occur until several decades aft er the Christians fi rst applied temple and sacrifi cial terminology to their com munity, and that it did not happen until aft er the destruction of the Jeru salem Temple , reveals the strong hold that the Jewish worldview of the Jerusalem church still maintained over the emerging Christian move ment."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"8Spreading the Sweet Scent of the Gospel as the Cult of the Wise: On the Backdrop of the Olfactory Metaphor in 2 Corinthians 2:14–16Dominika A. Kurek-Chomycz1. IntroductionIn the Pauline letters we come across several metaphors in which the apostle char-acterizes his own life (Rom 15:16; Phil 2:17) or the activity of other believers (Rom 12:1; Phil 4:18) in cultic terms. While it is debated what such metaphors imply for Paul’s understanding of cult, it is evident that the imagery in these verses needs to be interpreted against the sacrifi cial background. A similar context has also been suggested for the convoluted metaphor of scent in 2 Cor 2:14–16, yet in this case the im agery is more equivocal. In my contribution I argue that it is unwar ranted to reject cultic overtones in 2 Cor 2:14–16 and, furthermore, while not excluding other possible connotations, the backdrop against which Paul’s metaphor is best understood is that of the association of Wisdom, scent, and sacrifi ce . I suggest that many of the interpretations proposed heretofore, both for and against a cultic understanding of the imagery , were based on a problematic understanding of the biblical notion of sa crifi ce and the nature of incense off erings and, oft en related to this, failed to appreciate the signifi cance of cult in Ben Sira. Sirach 24:15 has oft en been mentioned in the discussions of Paul’s metaphor , so the inter preta tion I pro-pose is not entirely novel. Yet in my essay I focus on as pects which have so far not received suffi cient attention. I spell out the broader consequences of interpreting 2 Cor 2:14–16 in light of Sir 24:15, noting the signifi cance of olfaction and mean-ings associated with it in the wider context of Ben Sira on the one hand, and the intertextual ele ments that Sir 24:15 and other passages in this book evoke on the other.1 1.

Even though the passage opens with triumphal imagery , it then continues until v. 16b with a convoluted olfactory metaphor . In v. 14c the apostle depicts himself as the medium of spreading the aroma of God’s knowledge, yet in v. 15 the imagery shift s and Paul himself is now envi saged as a “sweet scent of Christ to God.” Th e aroma with which he is identifi ed not only has revelatory power, but what is more, it turns out to be the means of the divine judgment, whereby all those aff ected by the odor are divided into two mutually exclusive groups, those who are “being saved” and those who “are perishing.” Th e text of 2 Cor 2:14–16, except for some minor variations, is vir tually free of serious text-critical controversies, which is probably surpri sing given its popular-ity in patristic literature.

Th e profusion of scent terms in these three verses (ὀσμή in v. 14c, εὐωδία in v. 15, and again ὀσμή, twice, in v. 16ab) is all the more note worthy considering that in the entire New Testament, aside from the Pauline literature, explicit olfactory terminology appears only in the Gospel of John .5 Th e evocative style of 2 Cor 2:14–16, and the fact that it does not present us with a simple, concrete image , have captivated the imagina tion of the readers through-out the centuries, but by the same token it escaped attempts to pin it down. Th e elusive character of the imagery has led to a variety of interpretations, which are oft en indicative of a given author’s agenda and the prejudices of a particular period and cul tural environment. In Christian antiquity the notion of Christ’s aroma be-came a common topos in the discourse of olfactory piety.6 Authors who developed the concept of spiritual senses, Origen and Gregory of Nyssa in particular, adopted Paul’s metaphor as the key New Testament proof text for the spiritual sense of smell. While among ancient interpreters there was much interest in the imagery of scent, in some of the modern discussions a disproportionate amount of attention was paid to the im age of triumph, even though it appears only at the outset of the pericope.

We need to keep in mind that Paul’s tendency to mix metaphor s, as Ray-mond Collins observes, is one of the features of his “use of fi gurative language that deserves to be noted.”7 Not all the commentators are interested in determining the possible backdrop of the aroma metaphor in all of its detail. Some are content with understanding it as pertaining to some general characteristics of fragrance, such as its all-pervading, uncontrollable, yet at the same time elusive nature.8 On this interpretation, if there is any concrete image behind the reference to the aroma, it would be, in keeping with the me taphor of triumph, the odor accompanying the triumphal procession.9 Th ose who prefer to understand the imagery of triumph as a reference to ancient epiphany processions in honor of deities such as Isis, rather than to the specifi c image of the Roman triumph, understand the reference to scent accordingly, that is in connection with the aromatic substances spread around in the course of such processions.10 A number of authors, even though they may concede that in v. 14 the reference is to the smell of incense off ered during a triumphal proces sion, submit that in v. 15 a shift in the imagery occurs.11 Among those interpreters, the main dividing line pertains to (1) whether a general notion of scent as a sign of divine life and presence, widespread in an tiquity, accounts best for the imagery , or (2) whether the image is sacrifi cial.

When commenting on the interpretations of scholars who distinguished a set of diff erent images in 2 Cor 2:14–16, instead of “unpacking the metaphorical language in a simple and coherent fashion” (p. 78), Attridge argues that it is unlikely that “Paul is simply and shamelessly mixing his metaphors ” (p. 75). Yet that Paul mixes images from various cultural spheres or, rather, from the world surrounding him (which would include both Jews and Gentiles) on the one hand, and the Hebrew scriptures on the other, is apparent al-ready in the immediately following passage in 3:1–3. In 2 Cor 3:1–3 the tablets of stone are an allusion to the commandments given to Moses, while the “letter of recommendation,” introducing the metaphor , is more related to the Hellenistic context. 8.

Th e arguments for the sacrifi cial interpretation of the imagery in clude the fact that the aroma with which Paul identifi es himself in v. 15 is envisioned as directed “to God” (τῷ θεῷ) and that the two terms Paul employs for smell, ὀσμή and εὐωδία, occur mostly in the cultic terminus technicus ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας, literally the “smell of the sweet scent,” in the Septua gint and in later Jewish literature. Th is Greek expres-sion was used by the lxx translators to render the Hebrew term ניחוח ריח, which in the Hebrew Bible, as well as in other ancient Jewish literature, denotes the pleasing aroma of sacrifi ce , essential for ascertain ing whether the off ering was accepted by God.13 Interestingly, in the Hebrew Bible this term is never used in reference to separate incense off erings , but this changes in later Jewish literature.14 Th is expres-sion is employed by Paul in Phil 4:18, and by his imitator in Eph 5:2. Th e fact that in Philippians, as opposed to 2 Corinthians , the phrase occurs in the context of the full-fl edged lxx sacrifi cial terminology leaves no doubt as to its background. Later authors, especially those opposing the sacrifi cial understand ing of 2 Cor 2:14–16, oft en refer to Lohmeyer’s study on scent, without, however, noting the nuances of his interpretation. According to Loh meyer, there can be no doubt that the olfactory imagery in 2 Corinthians evokes the ancient Greek symbol of the divine fragrance, wherein God is revealed on earth.15 Th en, however, he goes on to comment on the ele ments he labels as “un-Greek” (ungriechisch). Ultimately, in the course of Lohmeyer’s discussion it becomes clear that the imagery is best inter-preted against the backdrop of the ideas attested in the Jewish writings, without denying that the concept of olfaction in the religious sphere in the Jewish literature 12.

Lohmeyer submits that the idea of the manifestation of the divine presence in the Jewish context is primarily expressed in the notion of anointment with the aro matic holy oil, so that Saint Paul’s fragrant identity is to be viewed in light of his relationship with Christ, the Anointed One. In spite of what later interpreters claimed, Lohmeyer did not exclude the sacrifi cial connota tion, either. Th is is generally overlooked by those who invoke Loh meyer’s study in their interpretation of the signifi cance of the aroma in 2 Cor 2:14–16. Typical in this respect is Rudolf Bultmann’s assertion: “Th e expression rather rests on the ancient idea that fragrance is a sign of the divine presence and the divine life.”16 Among the texts he then quotes, besides Plutarch’s text about Isis, he refers also to Jewish docu-ments (Sir 24:12–15; 39:13–14; 1 En. 24; 2 Bar . 67.6), yet fails to notice that—ex-cept perhaps for 1 Enoch—all the passages he quotes have a cul tic connotation.17 Bultmann was not the fi rst commentator to reject the cultic, or more specifi -cally, sacrifi cial, understanding of the imagery . In order to justify his rejection of the sacrifi cial overtones, both he, and earlier Hans Win disch, following Johannes Weiss, were ready to regard τῷ θεῷ as second ary, even though it is only absent from one Byzantine manuscript, Codex Mosquen sis. Alternatively, they proposed to understand it as “in God’s glory.”18Th e debate as to whether the sacrifi cial understanding of the passage is war-ranted or not continued throughout the twentieth century,19 yet in its second half the majority of exegetes attempting to elucidate the Pau line imagery displayed far more interest in the metaphor of triumph than in the aroma.20 More recently, how-ever, there has been yet another turn of the tide. It is surely not accidental that the fi rst important essay on 2 Cor 2:14–16 to appear in the twenty-fi rst century is an article by Harold Attridge, “Making Scents of Paul,” which largely focuses on fragrance, including a short, yet very helpful, consideration of the ancient physiol-ogy of scent.21 While Attridge rejects the sacrifi cial interpretation (see below), in the commentaries there is now more openness to recognize the polyvalence of the Pauline passage and hence the willingness to ac cept that the imagery may draw on various connotations of fragrance. 16.

Sacrificial Scents, Wisdom, and Cult of the WiseFor the opponents of the sacrifi cial understanding of Paul’s olfactory metaphor, the fact that the fi xed expression ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας is not used in 2 Cor 2:14–16 has been the main and oft en the only argument to support their assertion.22 It was recently repeated by Attridge,23 even though already in earlier publications it was pointed out that εὐωδία on its own can be used as a cultic technical term.24 In Ben Sira the complete phrase ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας occurs only in Sir 50:15. Εὐωδία alone is the ren-dering of ניחוח ריח in the passage praising Aaron , where it appears in the list of his cultic tasks (Sir 45:16), alongside fruit sacrifi ce (κάρπωσις) and incense (θυμίαμα). Earlier in the same book εὐωδία is named among the off erings advocated by Ben Sira in his advice to those who are sick (38:11).25 Also in Dan 2:46 and in Ezra 6:10 εὐωδίαι, the term rendering the Aramaic ניחוחין, functions by itself as a metonym for sacrifi ce .26 Th e same ten dency in Hebrew and in Aramaic is attested in the Dead Sea Scrolls, where ניחוח ריח and ניחוח alone are used synonymously.27 Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Apocryphal Psalm 154 is of particular inter-est.28 Th is Psalm not only has a strong sapiential fl avor, but it is remarkable for the fi gure of personifi ed Wisdom, absent from the canonical Psalms. Related to 22. Cf. Plummer, 2 Corinthians, 71; Furnish, 2 Corinthians, 177.23. Cf.

Renwick, Paul, the Temple , and the Presence of God (BJS 224; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991), 85. 25. Cf. 35:5, where the off ering made by the righteous is claimed to “enrich the altar ” and its “sweet scent” is said to be “before the Most High”: προσφορὰ δικαίου λιπαίνει θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἡ εὐωδία αὐτῆς ἔναντι ὑψίστου. 26. In Dan 2:46 King Nebuchadnezzar is reported to have ordered that מנחה and ניחחין (Aramaic shortened plural form; in lxx: εὐωδίαι) be off ered to Daniel. Modern English translations tend to render the latter term in this context as “incense,” but this, albeit possi-ble, is far from certain. In the Hebrew Bible a separate incense off ering is never designated as ניחוח ריח/ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας, so it is just as likely that in this context the expression denotes either a generic off ering , possibly as a synonym of מנחה, or, should the latter refer more specifi cally to a cereal off ering , ניחחין might imply animal sacrifi ce. Th e same Aramaic form (again εὐωδίαι in the lxx) occurs also in Ezra 6:10, where it clearly denotes sacrifi ce in general.27. Of note is in this respect the Community Rule. While in 1QS III, 11; IX, 5 we indeed fi nd only ניחוח alone, in 1QS VIII, 9, there is also ריח inserted between the lines, hence ריח ניחוח. Interestingly enough, however, in 4Q259 II, 17, attesting the same passage, ריח does not appear. 28. Th e Hebrew text of Apoc. Ps. 154, previously known only in the Syriac version, was discovered in col. XVIII of 11Q5 . For the text, translation, and commentary, see James A. Sanders, Th e Psalms Scroll of Qumrân Cave 11 (11QPsa) (DJD 4; Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965), 64–70. Th ere is no certainty concerning the date of its composition, but I deem quite plausible the suggestion of Dieter Lührmann, who, based on the correspondences between Apoc. Ps. 154 and Ben Sira , proposes a date close to the composition of the latter’s work,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"122Ritual and Metaphorthe role of Wisdom is the role of those proclaiming her, that is, all the “righteous” and “pious,” who in turn are also praised. Th eir praise is most fully expressed in vv. 10–11,29 where the one who “glorifi es the Most High” is said to be accepted “as one who brings a meal off ering / as one who off ers he-goats and bullocks / as one who fattens the altar with many burnt off ering s, / as a pleasing incense of-fering (ניחוח בקטורת) [or “as incense, pleasing aroma”] from the hand of the righ-teous (צדיקים מיד).”30 Interestingly, in line 9 of 11Q5 XVIII there is blank space between בקטורת and ניחוח, and it is virtually certain that a short word was erased in this place, ריח being the most obvious candidate.31 In Apoc. Ps. 154, we thus have yet another attestation that in later usage ריח ניחוח and ניחוח are practically synonymous with regard to the cultic realm. Fur-thermore, we note that the phrase ניחוח ריח or at least ניחוח is associated here with incense, as in some other Second Temple Jewish writings, but unlike in the Hebrew Bible. Th e relationship between the wise and sacrifi cial smells attested in this Psalm is rarely noticed, and I bring it up here because it confi rms that the link among Wisdom, the wise, and sacrifi cial scents is not limited to Ben Sira , even though this is where it is best attested and where the imagery is most intricate. It is to Ben Sira that we now turn. Almost all of the occurrences of εὐωδία in the lxx are in a sacrifi cial context. Th e setting of Sir 24:15 is likewise cultic, as implied by the refer ence to the “smoke of frankincense in the Tent” as well as Wisdom’s indica tion of her priestly function in the preceding verses. Yet the poetic character of Wisdom’s self-praise makes the passage more equivocal. In this verse Wisdom says about herself: 15a ὡς κιννάμωμον καὶ ἀσπάλαθος ἀρωμάτων δέδωκα ὀσμήν,32 15b καὶ ὡς σμύρνα ἐκλεκτὴ διέδωκα εὐωδίαν, or perhaps even earlier. Cf. Dieter Lührmann, “Ein Weisheitspsalm aus Qumran (11QPsª XVIII),” ZAW 80 (1968): 87–98, 97. 29. Th e verse division is particularly confusing. I follow the system introduced by Sand-ers in his DJD edition (see the previous note), for it is used in the majority of more re-cent stu dies. It does not, however, refl ect the line division in 11Q5 XVIII, where the poem is written continuously, and it diff ers from the versifi cation in the Syriac version used by scholars before the discovery of the Hebrew original.30. Th e translation is that of Sanders, Psalms Scroll, 65, except for the last line.31. Sanders, Psalms Scroll, in his transcription of the text (p. 64) does not note the vacat, but in a footnote (cf. p. 66) he mentions the erasure, suggesting that the erased word could be ריח. 32. Δέδωκα ὀσμήν at the end of v. 15a is absent from some witnesses, and Joseph Ziegler in his Göttingen lxx edition of Ben Sira regards it as secondary, relegating the phrase to the critical apparatus. Since in Ben Sira sometimes εὐωδία alone is employed to denote the pleasing fragrance of sacrifi ce (or the sacrifi ce itself ), it may not have been necessary for the author to mention ὀσμή as well in order to invoke sacrifi cial overtones. Yet the presence of both substantives in such a proximity, but not in the fi xed technical expression as elsewhere in the lxx, is obviously of interest to us, taking into account Paul’s use of these two scent terms in 2 Cor 2:14–16. Judging from Ziegler’s critical apparatus, δέδωκα ὀσμήν is absent in the witnesses associated with the Origenic recension: the Syrohexaplar, the eighth-century"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"123Kurek-Chomycz: Spreading the Sweet Scent of the Gospel15c ὡς χαλβάνη καὶ ὄνυξ καὶ στακτή, 15d καὶ ὡς λιβάνου ἀτμὶς ἐν σκηνῇ.33Numerous authors have noted in Sir 24:15 an allusion to the instructions on how to make the anointing oil and incense in Exod 30.34 Aromatic substances such as galbanum, onycha, stacte, and frankincense are all named in Exod 30:34 as ingre-dients out of which the Lord tells Moses to make incense. As for the fi rst part of the verse, while aspalathus is a ha pax legomenon in the lxx, cinnamon and myrrh are among the ingre dients of the anointing oil (cf. Exod 30:23–25). For everyone acquainted with the Temple ritual it was evident that “[b]oth the anointing oil and the incense were integral accessories for worship at the divine sanctu ary.”35 Whether the aromatics named in v. 15 are intended to evoke only the Temple incense, or both incense and the anointing oil, the emphasis is clearly on the fra-grance emitted by the spices.

Joseph Ziegler, Sapientia Iesu fi lii Sirach (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1965), 65. In omitting the reference to smell at the end of 24:15a, however, it disagrees with the other witnesses of this group (which read: ἔδωκα ὀσμήν), siding thus with the mss asso ciated with the Origenic recension. Overall, thus, external evidence is rather late and li mited. Ziegler’s decision to omit δέδωκα ὀσμήν, however, is infl uenced rather by internal critical considerations. In his reasoning he apparently follows Rudolf Smend, Die Weisheit des Jesus Sirach (Berlin: Reimer, 1906), 219. Taking into consideration the complexity of text-critical issues with regard to Ben Sira , it is rarely possible to be certain of one’s tex-tual decisions. Yet internal considerations suggested by Smend are scarcely compelling. Ad mittedly, the verse including δέδωκα ὀσμήν is rather long, but there are other equally long verses in the Greek text of Ben Sira’s poem. Th e inclusion of this phrase, even as it rein forces sacrifi cial overtones of Wisdom’s self-praise, adding yet another indication of the author’s interest in cultic smells, constitutes at the same time a link with Sir 39:14. Finally, rather than assuming that the shorter reading is more likely, it is equally possible that the similar ending of 24:15a and b, δέδωκα ὀσμήν and διέδωκα εὐωδίαν respectively, resulted in the former being dropped. Th is could even be intentional, perhaps because the phrase was deemed excessive. 33. “Like cinnamon and aspalathus of spices I gave forth scent, and like choice myrrh I spread fragrance, like galbanum, onycha, and stacte, and like the vapor of frankincense in the tent.” 34.

At the outset of this section I already mentioned the relevant verses in my comments on how εὐωδία alone is used to denote sacrifi ce . Th e connec tion between Wisdom and cult is further underscored when we note the striking similarities between Ben Sira’s picture of Wisdom in chapter 24 and his description of Simon the high priest in chapter 50. According to Robert Hayward, “In the picture of Simon off ering sacrifi ce, Ben Sira draws a par-allel with Wisdom’s residence and priestly service on Mount Zion. In short, Simon, as he off ers sacrifi ce, openly displays Wisdom.”36 Notably, the libation which Simon is reported to have poured in 50:15 is further characterized as “a pleasing odor to the Most High, the king of all” (ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας ὑψίστῳ παμβασιλεῖ). In the Hebrew Bible ניחוח ריח (and in lxx ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας) is occasionally applied to the aroma of libations , yet mostly in combination with other off erings , as in Num 15:7, 10; 28:8; 29:6. Ben Sira’s depiction is exceptional, however, in the way this off ering is singled out, so that for a moment the entire attention is focused exclu sively on the libation performed by Simon and, by implication, on its aroma. Both Wisdom and Simon diff use scents, which are pleasing to God, even though the sweet scent sent forth by Wisdom has a more uni versal scope and it does not come from wine . While no incense off ering carried out by Simon is described, incense, or rather frankin-cense, is not absent from chapter 50. In Sir 50:9 lxx Simon is compared to fi re and frankincense in the censer (ὡς πῦρ καὶ λίβανος ἐπὶ πυρείου).37 Th is implies a separate off ering consist ing of frankin-cense alone, unheard of in the prescriptive texts of the Pen tateuch. Yet even though separate frankincense off erings may not be stipulated in scripture, fi re pans are mentioned several times in Exodus among the Temple appurtenances, and then in several narratives recount ing incense off erings in fi re pans. Th e latter accounts also happen to be the passages indicating the extreme dangers of dealing with in-cense, as well as its character as the off ering most fi t for a cultic ordeal.38 Earlier on in the Praise of the Fathers we come across yet another ol factory simile, which presents us with an interesting example of an allu sion to the Exodus account of the production of compound incense. It is the fi rst of the three simi-les with which a brief passage devoted to Josiah is introduced. King Josiah is re-36. Hayward, “Sacrifi ce,” 29.37. Th is diff ers from the Hebrew text, where Simon is compared to “fi re of the frankin-cense on the cereal off ering ” (המנחה על לבונה שׁא).38. Among the possible texts that the Greek version of v. 9 may be alluding to is the off ering attempted by Nadab and Abihu in Lev 10. Incense is also off ered in a fi re pan on the Day of Atonement (cf. Lev 16). Another possibility is the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram and the subsequent stopping of the plague by Aaron in Num 16–17. All these accounts are meant as a warning against improper use of incense (and fi re ?), but they also demonstrate the extreme holiness of proper incense off erings and point to the high priest, Aaron, as the only one worthy of off ering incense in a fi re pan (τὸ πυρεῖον), acceptable to God."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"125Kurek-Chomycz: Spreading the Sweet Scent of the Gospelnowned for his liturgical reform (cf. 2 Kgs 22–23 = 2 Chr 34–35), hence his praise begins with a simile which is litur gical par excellence. In Sir 49:1 his memory is compared to a “compound ing of incense, prepared by the work of a perfumer”: Μνημόσυνον Ιωσιου εἰς σύνθεσιν θυμιάματος ἐσκευασμένον ἔργῳ μυρεψοῦ (Sir 49:1). Th is is reminis cent of Exod 30:7 lxx as well as other verses in Exodus where the lxx translation includes “compound incense.”39 In analogy to Wisdom, who may dwell in the Jerusalem Temple and be associ-ated with the Torah, yet escape the straightforward identifi ca tion with it, so the essence of a sage is not exhausted in dutiful worship and the deeds of loving kind-ness. All these are prerequisites to attain wisdom, but there is more to that. Th is excess is again most craft ily ex pressed with the metaphor of fragrance in Sir 39:14, which begins with the exhortation to “send out sweet fragrance like frankincense” (ὡς λίβανος εὐωδιάσατε ὀσμήν). Th is verse belongs to the fi rst stanza of the poem eulogizing God as creator. Th e “faithful,” in Greek υἱοὶ ὅσιοι, more narrowly un-derstood are those listening to Ben Sira’s instruction,40 but in a broader sense all those willing to follow Wisdom’s teaching. As the service carried out by Wisdom, while originating in the Jerusalem Tem ple , encompasses the entire world, both in its spatial and the temporal dimension, so the worship of the wise, or rather those on the way to wisdom, cannot be limited to one place and one time. Giving forth the sweet scent of frankincense is an obvious allusion to 24:15, even as it looks forward to the comparison of Simon with frankincense in 50:9. In short, the references to cultic scents recurring throughout the text of Ben Sira bring together all those who can be regarded as belonging to the wide cat-egory of the “wise.” Th e famous fi gures of the past, cultic offi cials, all the righteous, teachers, and students of wisdom, are united in a mighty fragrant symphony, or rather, “synosmy.” 5. Incense Offerings and the Backdrop of 2 Corinthians 2:14–16Neither in the biblical prescription on how to prepare holy incense (Exod 30:34–38), nor in the scriptural passages where “incense of aromatic spices” (קטורת 39. In Exod 30:7 the lxx translators rendered סמים(ה) קטורת, literally “incense of (aro-matic) spices,” the phrase used throughout the Book of Exodus to denote sanctuary incense, with θυμίαμα σύνθετον. Cf. τὸ θυμίαμα τῆς συνθέσεως in 31:11; 35:19, 39, and ἡ σύνθεσις τοῦ θυμιάματος in 35:28; 38:25. Th e text of MS B attests that indeed סמים קטורת was the basis for σύνθεσις θυμιάματος in the Greek version of Sir 49:1. Cf. Pancratius C. Beentjes, Th e Book of Ben Sira in Hebrew : A Text Edition of All Extant Hebrew Manuscripts and a Syn-opsis of All Parallel Hebrew Ben Sira Texts (VTSup 68; Leiden: Brill, 1997), 87. Th e allusion to the “compound of in cense” in the Exodus account of the construction of the Tabernacle is reinforced by the reference to the preparation “by the skill of the perfumer.” In Exod 30:35 the lxx has a somewhat pleonastic θυμίαμα, μυρεψικὸν ἔργον μυρεψοῦ, μεμιγμένον (cf. also ἡ σύνθεσις τοῦ θυμιάματος, καθαρὸν ἔργον μυρεψοῦ in lxx 38:25). In the Hebrew text of Sir 49:1 the descrip tion of incense in Exod 30:35 as “blended as by the perfumer, salted” is almost a verbatim quotation.40. Cf.

Yet its manifold meanings can be gleaned from the various accounts of the circumstances in which incense was used.43 It was a particularly holy type of off ering , which served to praise and honor God, operated as a means of atonement (most explicitly in Num 17:11–12; possibly 1 Chr 6:34), facilitated communication with the divine, hence its association with prayer, prominent especially in the later sources (see Ps 141:2 [lxx 140:2]; cf. Jdt 9:1; Wis 18:21). While in the He brew Bible it played an ambigu-ous role of revealing and concealing in the context of theophany (see esp. Lev 16), in later writings an even closer connection between incense and the divine revela-tion is attested.44 While extremely holy , incense off erings represented a precarious type of off ering .45 Th ey were closely linked with priestly identity and thus espe-cially fi t for cultic ordeals in cases when priestly status is disputed. Related to this was the role of incense in manifesting and executing the di vine will and the divine judgment.46 Even as incense could signify, or conceal, the divine presence, it also had apotropaic power, and, most perti nently for the Pauline metaphor , it could be both life-giving and death-dealing.47 41. Cf. n. 39.42. Aside from Exodus , the daily incense off ering as a standard practice is mentioned sev eral times in 2 Chronicles (2 Chr 2:3; 13:11; 29:7).43. None of the few monographs devoted to incense cult in ancient Judaism gives a full account of the variety of meanings associated with incense, as they tend to focus on his-torical and/or archaeological issues related to the development of the cult. Cf. Paul Heger, Th e Development of Incense Cult in Israel (BZAW 245; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1997); Wolf-gang Zwickel, Räucherkult und Räuchergeräte: Exegetische und archäologische Studien zum Räucher opfer im Alten Testament (OBO 97; Fribourg, Switzerland: Universitätsverlag; Göt-tingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1990); Kjeld Nielsen, Incense in Ancient Israel (VTSup 38; Leiden: Brill, 1986); Max Löhr, Das Räucheropfer im Alten Testament: Eine archäolo-gische Untersuchung (Halle, Germany: Niemeyer Verlag, 1927). 44. Ant. 13.282 shows that in the fi rst century incense celebration was considered, as Heger, Development, 187, puts it, “the catalyst for divine revelation, the stage of prophecy.” Th e function of incense as such a “catalyst” is also well illustrated in Luke 1:8–20. 45. Th is extreme holiness of incense is underscored in how it renders holy all the vessels with which it has contact, the acceptance or refutation of a given incense off ering notwith-standing; cf. Num 17:3. As for the hazards in dealing with incense, see esp. Lev 10:1–2; Num 16; 2 Chr 26:16–21.46. Th e account of the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram in Num 16–17 is a par-ticularly vivid illustration. 47. In Num 17 the incense off ered by Aaron literally divides those who are dying from those who are still alive. Th us, Roger David Aus, Imagery of Triumph and Rebellion in 2 Cor-inthians 2:14–17 and Elsewhere in the Epistle: An Example of the Combination of Greco-Roman and Judaic Traditions in the Apostle Paul (Studies in Judaism; Lanham, MD: Uni-versity of America Press, 2005), may be right in suggesting an allusion to Num 17:13 in 2 Cor 2:15–16. Aus provides an interesting overview of how the episode was interpreted in the later sources, including the Targums and the rabbinic writings. Th e story of how Aaron extinguished the plague in Num 17 was a recurring theme in later Jewish tradition, and a variety of interpretations existed, some of which Paul could have known. Yet I remain more"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"127Kurek-Chomycz: Spreading the Sweet Scent of the GospelIn Exod 30 incense off erings may not be explicitly characterized as sa crifi ce , but the fact that it is to be off ered on the altar implies an anal ogy with the burnt of-ferings . Moreover, incense off erings elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible confi rm that it was regarded as such.48 By the fi rst century, as attested in the writings of Philo and Josephus , as well as in some of the Pseudepigrapha, not only was it self-evident that incense constituted sacrifi ce , but, what is more, in certain contexts it could even be seen as sacrifi ce par excellence.49 Th is, as we shall see, has oft en been over-looked by scholars. Bultmann’s rejection of any sacrifi cial overtones in 2 Cor 2:14–16 and his si-multaneous acceptance of Sir 24:15 as expressing a similar concept as Paul’s meta-phor appears to have set the agenda for a number of subse quent studies, includ-ing the otherwise excellent commentary by Margaret Th rall. Th rall, as opposed to Bultmann, is willing to accept the sacrifi cial interpretation of the passage. She also mentions the fi gure of Wisdom in Sir 24:15 as yet another background which has been suggested by interpreters, without, however, noting, that Wisdom is depicted there in cultic terms.50 Two authors who have been most vocal in their assertions that Sir 24:15 constitutes the backdrop against which the Pauline text should be read are Scott Hafemann and Margareta Gruber. Th eir respective interpretations diff er from each other to a signifi cant extent. Even as they both agree on the asso-ciation of θριαμβεύω with death, they completely disagree in their understanding of the odoriferous Wisdom. Hafemann is right to point out that while Paul may have taken the olfactory imagery and terminology from Ben Sira , another text, the Wis dom of Solomon, provided some other characteristics with which Paul would associate Wisdom, such as the power and glory of God, as well as the Spirit. As regards Sir 24:15, he asserts that Paul derived the association of Wisdom with sacrifi ce from this verse. He argues that the im agery of scent constitutes a continuation of the image of triumph in that both envisage Paul as “being led to death.”51 In claiming this, however, Hafemann seems to have overlooked the fact that Wisdom off ers, or even becomes herself, incense. Th ere is thus no reference to dying, or even suff ering, un-less we bring in the concept of the trees suff ering when they are incised in order to obtain resin. Although sacrifi ce other than incense is mentioned elsewhere in Ben skeptical than Aus as to whether we should consider them as possible sources of Paul’s metaphor. 48. Besides the passages which depict literal incense off erings , note the parallel between incense and evening sacrifi ce in Ps 141:2. 49. Th is is attested already in the second-century b.c.e. Book of Jubilees (cf. n. 14). Among the later writings, the Life of Adam and Eve presents us with an impressive reposi-tory of the variety of associations evoked by incense. In spite of its uncertain dating and provenance, the document is noteworthy for bringing together various traditions concern-ing sacrifi cial smells. 50. Cf. Margaret E. Th rall, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians 1: Commentary on 2 Corinthians I–VII (Edinburgh: T&T Clark, 1994), 197–99.51. Hafemann, Suff ering, 52."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"128Ritual and MetaphorSira, there is no emphasis on killing . Th e only time when blood is named within this writing in a cultic context, this is in reference to the “blood of the grape” in the context of the aforemen tioned drink off ering in 50:15 (cf. 39:26). In his focus on death and suff er ing Hafemann presumes that what matters in sacrifi ce is the aspect of killing , and as a result he not only forgets that Wisdom off ers incense, but, what is more, that she does this in a jubilant mode. Gruber, by contrast, underestimates the sacrifi cial connotation of Sir 24:15. Nonetheless she needs to be commended for making a more sus tained eff ort to point to other parallels between Paul’s self-presentation in 2 Corinthians and the notion of personalized Wisdom in Ben Sira . Th is had not been done before, and Gruber’s list of the motifs common to Ben Sira and 2 Corinthians is very help-ful. Her list includes the elements of self-praise/boasting; appeal to the hearers, promising them salvation should they heed the appeal; the missionary aspect; as well as the link between Wisdom and prophecy/inspiration.52 Gruber also suggests that Sir 24:23–29 is, “as a witness of inner biblical eff ective history of the Ex odus tradition, an important bridge between Exodus and 2 Cor 3” (“als Zeugnis der inner biblischen Wirkungsgeschichte der Exodustradition eine wichtige Brücke zwischen Exodus und 2 Kor 3”).53 In addition, she observes that Paul and Ben Sira share an impressive amount of common vocabulary. Taking into account the use of the sanctuary incense in the Hebrew Bible, especially in the context of the Day of Atonement , Paul’s self-comparison, or even identifi cation, with incense, in a letter so con cerned with the issue of reconciliation , bears noting.54 In view of Gruber’s attempt to consider the broader context of Ben Sira, it is all the more surprising that she overlooks some characteristic features of Ben Sira, such as the general interest in (sacrifi cial) smells and the association of Wisdom with priesthood , which is not limited to chap ter 24. According to Gruber, Wis-dom’s self-comparison with the holy anointing oil and with incense in Sir 24:15 is “something diff erent than ֹיthe terminus technicus of the sacrifi cial cult, known from Genesis to Num bers , ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας חַֹניחִ(הַ) חַריֵ” (“etwas anderes als der aus Gen bis Num bekannte terminus technicus des Opferkultes ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας חַריֵ חַֹניחִ(הַ)”).55 While she reproaches other commentators for failing to no tice this, she herself overlooks the fact that at least from the second cen tury b.c.e. onward the technical term could easily be applied to incense, as evi denced already in Ju-bilees 56 and Apoc. Ps. 154. Gruber earlier notes that all the other occurrences of εὐωδία in Ben Sira refer to the aroma of sacrifi ce,57 so it is somewhat surprising that she so easily dismisses this connotation in 24:15. She further argues that the sanctuary incense, in analogy to the holy anointing oil, should not be regarded as 52. See M. Margareta Gruber, Herrlichkeit in Schwachheit: Eine Auslegung der Apologie des Zweiten Korintherbriefs 2 Kor 2,14–6,13 (FB 89; Würzburg, Germany: Echter, 1998), 134–35, for a more detailed discussion.53.

Gruber relies on Haran’s distinction between the altar and the censer incense, yet such a diff erentiation is diffi cult to uphold.60 Th e fact that incense, including the Tamid incense off ering , is associated both with prayer and with revelation, sometimes simultaneously, as in Luke 1:8–20, shows that one aspect did not exclude the other one. Taking all this into consideration, it is highly unlikely that Paul would not have regarded incense off erings as sacrifi ce.61 In rejecting the sacrifi cial connotation of Sir 24:15, furthermore, Gruber disregards the connec tion between Wisdom and Simon, as well as other priestly fi gures in the Praise of the Fathers, to which we drew attention in our discussion above. Th e fragrance sent out in their off erings is analogous to that ex uded by Wisdom in 24:15. According to Gruber, Wisdom in chapter 24 does not exercise a priestly function, but is herself the aroma of the holy oil and incense.62 Yet even though v. 15 could be interpreted to this eff ect, Wis-dom’s service (ἐλειτούργησα) in the Holy Tent , mentioned in v. 10, does envisage Wisdom as a priest . Indeed, if in v. 15 she identifi es herself with scent, this could serve as yet another parallel with Paul’s imagery , who in other cultic metaphors may cast himself in the role of the priest , only to “become” sacrifi ce in Phil 2:17 and 2 Cor 2:15 (“we are the sweet scent of Christ”). As regards Gruber’s insistence that Sir 24:15 alludes both to the anointing oil and the holy incense, the allusion is 58. Ibid., 133.59. Th is is implied already in some of the biblical texts, yet the most explicit association between incense and the divine presence is attested in Josephus ’s account of the consecra-tion of the Temple by Solomon (see Ant. 8.101–102 ). 60. According to Menahem Haran, Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel: An Inquiry into the Character of Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School (Oxford: Clarendon, 1978), 230, “In the cultic practices of ancient Israel . . . spices were used in three ways.” He distinguishes among (1) the addition of the spice, usually frankincense (לבונה), as a supplement to a sacrifi ce; (2) so-called censer or ordinary incense (קטורת); and (3) altar incense (הסמים קטורת). Cf. also Menahem Haran, “Th e Uses of Incense in the An-cient Israelite Ritual,” VT 10, no. 2 (1960): 113–29. Th e textual foundation for the distinc-tion between (2) and (3) is rather tenuous, and it has rightly been questioned by scholars; cf. Nielsen, Incense, 69–70. Yet it is undeniable that לבונה needs to be diff eren tiated from קטורת. Th e distinction is also evident in the Septuagint, where לבונה, which occurs twenty times in the Hebrew Bible, is customarily translated as λίβανος (in 1 Chr 9:29 λιβανωτός; cf. 3 Macc 5:2,10, where λιβανωτός and λίβανος respectively are clearly synonym ous).61. Th at incense was regarded as rightful sacrifi ce is also attested in nonbiblical Jewish sources, including such fi rst-century writings as the works of Flavius Josephus (cf. Ant. 4.34) or LAB.62. Cf. Gruber, Herrlichkeit, 135."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"130Ritual and Metaphorfi rst and foremost to the fragrant incense, as noted above, even though a refer ence to the oil cannot be excluded. Gruber, like all the commentators who reject sacrifi cial overtones in 2 Cor 2:14–16, tends to overlook the multidirectional nature of smell. Finally, with respect to the terms shared by Sir 24:15 and 2 Cor 2:14–16, Gruber criticizes Hafemann for accepting Rahlfs’s text (including δέδωκα ὀσμήν) without further questions, yet the evidence for the text accepted by Ziegler is not unproblematic either.63 In this respect Hafemann’s obser vation may be justifi ed that both in Ben Sira and in the Pauline metaphor we come across both terms constituting the expression ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας, albeit “split up.”64I would like to suggest that at the basis of the diametrically opposed interpreta-tions lies, paradoxically, a similar understanding of sacrifi ce . Hafemann makes it explicit that he regards sacrifi ce as primarily con cerned with killing . Gruber does not state this expressly, but it seems that her notion of sacrifi ce does not diff er sub-stantially from that of Hafe mann. Th e element of destruction apparently appeals to Hafemann, and not so much to Gruber, even though in her interpretation of θριαμβεύω she is likewise quite positive with regard to its association with death. While such an understanding of sacrifi ce is in line with the com mon contempo-rary belief about what constitutes sacrifi ce, with its em phasis on loss and destruc-tion it is quite remote from its signifi cance in the Hebrew Bible. Th e same problem may be inherent in the interpreta tions of 2 Cor 2:14–16 espoused by other authors, which similarly sug gest that their decision for or against the sacrifi cial interpreta-tion de pends on a similar concept of sacrifi ce . In contrast to what popular contemporary understanding of sacrifi ce implies, sacrifi ce in the Hebrew Bible is not primarily about annihilation. Christian Eber-hart introduces a helpful distinction between the biblical notion of sacrifi ce and the contemporary secular metaphorical understanding.65 In the latter the emphasis is on loss and destruction, as the conventional use of the term sacrifi ce in various contemporary languages shows. Th ere is typically no addressee of such a “sacrifi ce” envisaged, and, as a result, its association with giving is obscured, for a gift without an addressee, the one for whom the gift is intended, becomes meaningless. Most of the information about sacrifi ce in the Hebrew Bible is de rived from the Priestly code, but unfortunately neither there, nor any where else in the scriptures, do we come across a systematic exposition of how sacrifi ce was supposed to “work.” Th e same is true, for that matter, for the specifi c type of sacrifi ce , the incense off er-ing . Various explanations have accordingly been put forward to elucidate the issue, 63. Cf. ibid., 127. See n. 32 for the text-critical discussion of the issue. 64. Cf. Hafemann, Suff ering, 48. It may be more disputable whether his claim that “the two terms have nevertheless retained their sacrifi cial meaning” is accurate. Th is depends on whether the fi rst part of Sir 24:15 refers to the anointing oil or if the entire verse alludes to the constitution of the sanctuary incense. 65. Cf. Christian A. Eberhart, “Th e Term ‘Sacrifi ce’ and the Problem of Th eological Abstrac tion: A Study of the Reception History of Genesis 22:1–19,” in Th e Multivalence of Biblical Texts and Th eological Meanings (ed. Christine Helmer; SBLSymS 37; Atlanta: Soci-ety of Bibli cal Literature, 2006), 48–50."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"131Kurek-Chomycz: Spreading the Sweet Scent of the Gospelbut many of them miss the point because of their emphasis on killing .66 Killing , however, is surely not an essential element, as otherwise neither grain off ering s, nor libations , nor incense off ering s could be regarded as sacrifi ce. According to Eberhart, “for the priestly traditions a cultic sacri fi ce is a dynamic process of con-secrating profane material to God through the practice of the burning rite.”67 Th e burning rite is important to guarantee the transformation of that material, which allows it to be transported to God. I would like to suggest, however, that while its sig nifi cance must not be underrated, the burning rite plays an instrumental role, and is not an absolute prerequisite for sacrifi ce to be qualifi ed as such. Th e valid-ity of drink off erings suggests that there could be other ways whereby the form of the material substance could alter in order to ensure the transformation, and the subsequent consecration. One of the consequences of stressing the aspect of loss and destruc tion, as in contemporary secular understanding of sacrifi ce , is that the role of sacrifi ce in establishing communication goes unnoticed. We may in fact wonder what is “sacrifi cial” about a “sacrifi ce” which is not con cerned with becoming sacred but annihilated. In the biblical understand ing of sacrifi ce , by contrast, the crucial ele-ment on the human side is giving, and on the divine—acceptance of sacrifi ce. Th e sign par excellence of God’s acceptance was God’s willingness to smell the pleas-ing odor (ניחוח ריח/ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας). In this way sacrifi ce is understood more as a means of creating and nurturing the bond between humans and God, thus about a relationship. Hence, what matters in sacrifi ce is (1) the fact that it denotes a material sub-stance which is consecrated, and thus transformed, be it through the burning rite or a diff erent way of changing the form, as in the case of liquids, and (2) that its addressee is God, the sweet scent constituting the tangible means of establish-ing communication and ascertaining that the off ering has been accepted. On this basis there is no reason to deny that in the olfactory metaphor in 2 Corinthians Paul’s apostolic existence is envisaged as sacrifi ce. More specifi cally, the imagery refers to the in cense off ering , the type of sacrifi ce which would most aff ect those sur rounding the off erer. Just like incense, which is off ered to God through the burning rite and, when accepted by God, may at the same time be come the means of the divine revelation, so Paul’s apostolic service, which includes the inseparable aspects of proclamation not only in words, but also in and through his bodily exis-tence, simultaneously becomes the locus of revelation, when off ered to God. Th e imagery in 2 Cor 2:14–16, however, is not only reminiscent of in cense of-ferings in general. More specifi cally, it alludes to the odoriferous Wisdom which off ers, or even identifi es herself with, incense, as depicted in Sir 24:15, as well as to the association of the wise with sacrifi cial smells, attested not only in Ben Sira, but also in Apoc.

Th is focus on the revelatory dimen sion of Paul’s apostolic ministry and the importance of knowl-edge in this respect, accompanied by the motif of travel, and the stress on the univer sal aspect (cf. πάντοτε and ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ) echo the portrayal of personi-fi ed Wisdom in Ben Sira 24. We already mentioned the elements com mon to Ben Sira and 2 Corinthians as discussed by Gruber. We may also note the presence of wisdom motifs elsewhere in the Pauline letters. While they are acknowledged by numerous authors, there is no consen sus as to their interpretation. Similarly with regard to 2 Cor 2:14–16, the elusiveness of the imagery makes it diffi cult to ascer-tain whether the allusion to Wisdom is primarily intended to suggest the equation of Paul’s apostolic life, of the gospel, or of Jesus with the divine Wisdom.68 Sir 24:15 as well as the wider context of Ben Sira, however, can only be appreciated as the backdrop of Paul’s metaphor if one is aware of the rich intertextual structure with which the array of intertwined images in this and other passages in Ben Sira pres-ent us with. Th ey evoke a host of meanings connected with incense off erings in the Hebrew Bible and other Jewish writings, to which we referred in the foregoing. Th e metaphor of triumph in v. 14b, even though it does not necessar ily deter-mine the details of the interpretation of the olfactory imagery which follows it, is not completely distinct from it, either. I suggest that even as the paradoxical use of the verb θριαμβεύω in reference to having been conquered by God stresses the paradoxical nature of Paul’s apostle ship, its juxtaposition with the joy emanat-ing from the thanksgiving (v. 14a), as well as the vivid metaphor of scent in vv. 14c–16b, further illumi nate Paul’s understanding of his ministry. Th e dangers of the apostolic existence, possibly alluded to in the metaphor of the triumph, far from being trivialized in what follows, gain a diff erent dimension. Th e sacrifi cial overtones, contra Hafemann, rather than being in continuity with the gruesome mode introduced by θριαμβεύω, are introduced in order to show the transforma-tion one’s existence may undergo once it is envi saged as an off ering to God. It is in keeping with Paul’s understanding of weakness and suff ering, to which Paul does not attribute positive value for their own sake, but which can be appreciated only to the extent to which the divine power is displayed in their midst. An allusion to sa piential traditions underscores the epistemological aspect of Paul’s min istry, emphasizing at the same time that true wisdom and knowledge come from God and are revealed in the life and teaching of his emissa ries. 7. ConclusionIn the present essay I have argued that the olfactory metaphor in 2 Cor 2:14–16 is best interpreted against the backdrop of the association between odoriferous Wisdom and sacrifi cial aromas, incense in particu lar, attested fi rst and foremost in Ben Sira. Of relevance also is the por trayal of the wise in a similar context, who, as imitators of Wisdom in writings such as Ben Sira, but also Apoc. Ps. 154, are 68.

Th is, I have argued, is due to a specifi c and, to my mind, fl awed, understanding of the biblical no tion of sacrifi ce , a failure to appreciate the signifi cance of cult and cultic imagery in Ben Sira , as well as a lack of awareness of the nature of in cense off er-ings . As my overview of the olfactory motifs in Ben Sira shows, they all appear in a cultic context, whether literal or metaphori cal . While Sir 24:15 had oft en featured in the discussions of the Pauline text, its sacrifi cial context was oft en overlooked. Furthermore, the array of intertwined images in this writing presents us with a rich intertextual structure, which needs to be kept in mind when interpreting 2 Cor 2:14–16 in its light. While the metaphor of scent can be read as distinct from the metaphor of triumph, the juxtaposition of the diff erent images and allusions in 2 Cor 2:14–16 is signifi cant in that it illuminates in a unique way the paradoxical nature of Paul’s apostolic existence."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"9Sacrifice, Social Discourse, and PowerGeorge HeymanTh e cross-cultural phenomenon we call sacrifi ce has historically evi denced the inchoate need within human consciousness to separate the sacred from the pro-fane. As an act of paradoxical negation, disorder and chaos are controlled as waste is valorized and social identity constructed. Such a discourse of sacrifi ce includes both ritual praxis and/or rhetorical formulations. Early Christianity was able to borrow from the myriad of sacrifi cial forms present in the Greek and Roman world to articulate and explain the death of Jesus . Th is discourse served as a source of power that allowed Christians to withstand Roman religio-political hegemony and developed into a core element of their corporate identity. Th e texts of the New Testament and the subsequent rhetoric surrounding the rise of desert asceti-cism and the development of the cult of the martyrs al lowed the early followers of Christianity to become adept practitioners of the power of sacrifi ce.As a child , whenever I considered one of my parental commands intolera ble or completely beyond the pale of my child like strength, my mother would oft en tell me to simply off er it up. I was never quite sure exactly what she meant, but I interpreted the phrase as a request to see beyond the burden of the moment and view the task in question, not with an ordinary child like attitude, but with a vision toward a more inexplicable form of reality whereby the task could be conceived, not as something dreadful and odious, but something that possessed a myste rious value beyond my comprehension. I was challenged to see the ac tivity as valuable even though I perceived the contrary. I never quite understood how value could be constitutive of such a painful burden, but I learned not to complain or ask fur-ther questions. With the simple words, off er it up, mom had won and reduced me to silence. Two things were accomplished by the phrase. First, I was challenged to transform the common ordinariness of life’s burden into an other reality. And second, the use of such discourse exerted a form of power that reduced me to si-lence. Such was my fi rst invitation to begin thinking about the power of sacrifi cial off ering . Th is essay makes no claim to unravel the multifaceted topic of sacri fi ce , but rather will demonstrate that the idea of sacrifi ce , as both ritual and rhetoric, is a 135"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"136Ritual and Metaphorpowerfully discursive social tool. Th e idea of sacrifi ce is a paradoxical negation. It sanctifi es and demonizes. To achieve this al terity it uses what is most precious in human existence as a form of waste. In this process of off ering an ironic valoriza-tion becomes available to those involved. In short, the ritual expression of sacri-fi ce , or even the mere rhetorical expression of sacrifi cial intent, are potent forms of social discourse that generate identity as they transform the ordinariness of human existence. It is my particular focus to demonstrate that this sacrifi cial discourse so perme-ated the ancient Graeco-Roman world that it became the social clash between the power of ancient Rome and the power of the early Christian church. I will be using the word discourse in its broadest sense. It is more than a collection of sentences. It presupposes a structural affi nity that precedes both speech and writing.1 Discourse arises within the relationships that exist between peoples and their traditions. It is there fore logically prior to the rhetorical forms produced. Bruce Lincoln has argued that it constructs society.2 Early Christianity and imperial Rome , steeped in a discourse of sacrifi ce , that is, a communication system rep lete with texts, rituals, and rhetoric, displayed their own forms of social control through the use of sacri-fi cial discourse. First I would like to ex plore the idea of sacrifi ce from a theoretical point of view and then apply this framework to the ancient Graeco-Roman world. Finally, I will ex plore the discourse of sacrifi ce present in the Christian rhetoric of the New Testament and briefl y allude to the tradition of the desert ascetics and the cult of the martyrs .3While theorists have attempted to explain the origins of sacrifi cial practices, these attempts have been only partially successful, in no small measure because of the multiple descriptions of what specifi cally con stitutes a sacrifi ce . Used as both a noun and verb, the word came into the English language as early as 1250 c.e. when it fi rst referred to human actions given to God.4 Simply put, to sacrifi ce is, as the Latin (sacer + fa cere) suggests, rendering something sacred. To be sacred is to be other. Like holiness , sanctity is a societal code word for alterity—a valorized otherness elevated to the point of virtue, admiration, and even emula tion.5 Human consciousness has evidenced a need to take the ordinary and render it other in order to create a sense of defi nition among the dis order and chaos that pervades the mundane and the common. It is within this innate other-making that power is utilized and identity de fi ned. We call this new entity holy and carefully separate it (or them) from the ordinary. Order, structure, and boundaries are created that establish social lines delineating the in-group from those outside. 1. R. Barthes, Th e Fashion System (New York: Hill and Wang, 1983), 208.2.

Th e ritu-als, as well as the rhetorical forms of sacrifi ce , created both a sense of place and a sense of sanctity in the Roman world. Th e city of Rome itself was founded on the necessary sacrifi ce of Remus when he violated the sacred boundary (the pome-rium) set up by his twin brother Romulus.6 Mary Douglas remarked that “holiness requires that individuals shall conform to the class to which they belong. And holiness requires that diff erent classes of things shall not be confused.”7 Th e dis-course of sacrifi ce , whether it is ritually practiced or rhetorically formu lated, has become a potent social vehicle that not only alters and valo rizes, but also unifi es those who wield its power. Th e late philosopher Georges Bataille argued that as sexual creatures there is an inherent longing for a sense of primordial continuity that we had prior to birth. A single cell replicates, until at the moment of birth we begin our journey as “discon-tinuous beings.”8 Birth, Bataille argues, is the starting point for this discontinuity as a being emerges from being-in-general. Death is the intimacy, the return to a continuity for which we yearn, yet an intimacy that we fear because of never hav-ing fully expe rienced it in this world.9 Th e paradox for Bataille is that as we move from infancy through childhood we gradually conceive ourselves as separate be-ings marked by time and duration, yet at the same time unconsciously yearn for the intimacy of death that society tells us we should never fully achieve. In our modern world the plethora of mood-elevating medications reveals the need for an intimacy that is ever more diffi cult to attain in an ever changing digital environ-ment. In Christian religious language, God alone becomes the source of intimacy and unity for which the human longs. One only has to look at Augustine as he opens the Confessions, “You stir man [sic] to take pleasure in praising you, because you have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.”10 Death jerks us out of our tenacious obsession with the discontinuity of our being. We blanch at the thought of death, yet, for Bataille, we yearn for the intimacy of continuity which grounds us with being-in-general. As separate, discontinuous be-ings, we compete and we consume, all of which leads to the violence that abounds with nature itself.116. As Romulus marked out the lines for the new city wall, he prayed to Jupiter, Mars, and Vesta. Receiving a favorable augury, he marked out the sacred space of the new city and instructed Celer to kill anyone who would cross the furrow. Unaware of this ban, Romulus’s twin brother Remus inadvertently leapt across the boundary and was killed, according to Ovid, Fasti 4.833–848. Livy, History 1.7.2, recounts Remus’s action as a result of an dispute with Romulus about the interpretation of an omen.7. Douglas, Purity, 53.8.

Of particular relevance for"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"138Ritual and MetaphorMy point in the foregoing analysis is to suggest that the discourse of sacrifi ce is fraught with an inversion of value. Typically, death and pain are to be avoided, yet when they are labeled sacrifi cial, ironically they become valorized and even admired. At fi rst glance it is not benefi cial to waste a glass of unmixed wine , ran-domly kill one’s livestock, or send a member of one’s family into the front lines of battle, yet when the descrip tion of this waste is deemed a sacrifi ce then ironically this objective form of waste-making is rendered valuable. To sacrifi ce is to con-sciously exer cise the power of alterity. Whether it is an act of ritual sacrifi ce , or a sim ple rhetorical description, the interpretation of such an off ering can be either positive or negative. To give one’s life for others is, as the rhetoric goes, one of the noblest things an individual can do, yet even the mere suggestion of a human sacri-fi ce smacks at the sinister and the macabre. Sacrifi ce can make the odious pleasant, and the meaningless meaningful. Practitioners (and rhetoricians alike) can make death life-giving or de monic. At some point in human history, the slaughter of an animal changed from the simple acquisition of food into a transcendent life-giving action. When this occurred is beyond the scope of this essay (if can be ascertained at all).12 What the discourse of sacrifi ce does is to de fi ne the inherent continuity all humanity shares even as we compete within a matrix of social relations. Bataille again has suggested that a sacrifi ce is itself a paradoxical negation, a form of waste whose utility is inherently purposeful. For Bataille sacrifi ce actually constitutes the idea of the sacred in more than etymological notions. He writes, “From the very fi rst, it appears that sacred things are constituted by an operation of loss.”13 By defi nition waste is that which has no value, however, when the reality in ques-tion is called a sacrifi ce, then value is imposed upon that which would otherwise appear valueless. A glass of mixed wine is simply poured on the ground, a valued domestic animal is slaughtered and its blood and fl esh immolated, a human being knowingly places their body on the front line of battle for God and country. Whether it is a ritual animal killing , the pouring of a libation , or any other type of action, there is no one defi nitive thing that can be identifi ed as a sacrifi ce unless the off erer of said waste deems to name it such. Sacri fi ces , as well as their rhetori-cal descriptions, are in the mind of those who sacrifi ce . While this might appear tautological there is no social debate because of the ubiquitous nature of the prac-tice (and its descrip tion) cross-culturally. One’s sacrifi ce becomes another’s waste of time, property, or life itself. In the case of war, the death of the combatant must this study is Girard’s conclusion that while Jesus was a victim of what he terms the scapegoat mechanism, his death was not a sacrifi ce since it exposed, rather than covered up, the true meaning of all ritual killing . Girard selectively looks at some New Testament texts while neglecting others, most notably the letter to the Hebrews .12. Some of the earliest theoretical understandings of sacrifi ce were formulated by Wil-liam Robertson-Smith, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites (London: Black, 1907); and James Frazer, Th e Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion (New York: Macmillan, 1922).13. Georges Bataille, Visions of Excess, Selected Writings (1927–1939) (trans A. Stoekel: Minneapo lis: University of Minnesota Press, 1985), 119, quoted in K.

Th e most precious thing that can be wasted is, by most cultural standards, human life itself. Leviticus 17:11 indicates that the “life of the fl esh is in the blood ” without an explanation of how or why this is. To off er blood to a deity (or to the state while engaged in bat tle) appears as one of the noblest actions humanly pos-sible. It is no small step then to see a corollary as well—the most potent expia-tory (read: cleansing, purifying, avenging, or tension-reducing) action in society is equally the death of the other. Ironically this form of waste brings peace. When an individual lays down their life for a higher goal (or power), culture typically accounts such a death as noble. When a society ritually or randomly en-gages in a systematization of human off ering , then the completely opposite evalu-ation is typically made. Whether or not cultures actually engaged in the practice of human sacrifi ce becomes irrelevant to the rhetorical claim typically made by an outsider. In the second century c.e. virtually every Christian apologist referred to the practice of human sacrifi ce as a charge leveled against Christians. Justin refers to the charge that Christians engaged in “meals of human fl esh.” Athena-goras refers to the charge of “Th yestean banquet s” among fellow Christians.15 Mi-nucius Felix has a lengthy description of similar charges; however, he rebuts them by citing examples of human sacrifi ce, which he believes to be prac ticed among the Carthaginians , the Taurians, and the Egyptian Busiris. He also mentions the well-known reference (in his day) to the Roman practice of having buried alive two Greeks as well as what he believes was the current practice of human sacrifi ce to Jupiter Latiaris.16 Human sacrifi ce , at least in its rhetorical form, is meant to distance the other in a negative manner. Th e ancient authors (both Christian and non-Christian alike) indicate that only barbarians engaged in such vile practices, while civilized people did not. Th e advanced mores of the civilized Greek or Roman confi rmed their superiority to those cultures that practiced such barbarism.17 While at times the practice could signal cultural superiority, at other times it merely suggested diff erence and otherness. Some societies charged with human sacrifi ce were just 14. When I queried a group of suburban seventh-graders in the fall of 2005 regarding the type of sacrifi ce off ered by the death of Pat Tilman in Afghanistan in 2004, the over-whelming response was that he “sacrifi ced his football career and all that money.” Th at Tilman “gave his life for his country” was not their fi rst response. 15.

Written as early as the fi ft h century b.c.e., these stories recount in a matter of fact manner the human sacrifi cial practices of the Taurians. Th e sacrifi ce to Jupiter Latiaris, one of the old Latin gods, was a white heifer; however, Rives notes that the games asso ciated with the holiday were thought to include the blood of the performers killed, perhaps in gladiatorial combat suggesting a type of human sacrifi ce . 17.

Such a charge was meant to identify the correct sacrifi cial practices prescribed by religiously upright people.18 My point here is to underscore the power contained within the discourse of sacrifi ce . Such rhetorical power was used to construct and deconstruct divergent cul tures, and even subgroups within a single society.19Th e social anthropologists Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss sug gested that sac-rifi cial rituals are oft en used to invert the norms of human behavior, thus creating a positive control of disorder by containing it within limits that are defi ned and prescribed.20 Th e act of off ering a sacri fi ce was to move an object across a boundary as a type of mediation be tween two worlds. Hubert and Mauss were particularly interested in how cultures viewed the complete transformation of the off erings that were used in religious rituals. “Th e purpose of the incineration was the com-plete elimination from temporal surroundings.”21 Th is form of conse cration also had the ability to transform the participants as well. Th ose participating in the off ering were equally altered as was the sub stance off ered. Such a sacramental no-tion is, I think, key to the power eff ected by any forms of sacrifi ce . Not only is the object off ered altered, so too are those who participate in the ritual, or those who im merse themselves in the rhetoric of sacrifi ce . Graeco-Roman and Christian Sacrificial DiscourseAs Christianity began to develop, it was already immersed in a world fi lled with sacrifi cial discourse. Since the central core of Christian belief was the death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, sacrifi cial discourse became a natural vehicle to describe his death as well as his altered state of existence on Easter Sunday. For a small sect of Jews their leader died badly. Th e man whom they had experienced as the risen son of God had died like a common criminal. Th e manifold expressions of sacrifi cial discourse, so prevalent in the ancient world, became one of the chief vehicles for both an understanding of his death and the ethos out of which Chris-tian identity could be constituted and defi ned. For Chris tians, Jesus died nobly and his lordship was able to transcend the power of the emperor. Early Christian rhetoric borrowed from the rich sacrifi cial discourse widely available in the Greek and Roman world. 18. See Cicero, De Re Publica 3.13, where he comments without moral disdain that the Tau rians in the Black Sea, Busiris, King of Egypt , the Gauls, and the Punics have considered human sacrifi ce a pious act, “one most pleasing to the immortal gods” (quoted in Rives, “Human Sacrifi ce ,” 69). Cicero simply wants to underscore that the correct religious (read, political) sacrifi ces were those of the Roman people.19.

Lawrence Wills has argued that “in the Graeco-Roman world it is impossible to consider the death of the hero without seeing it as a sacri fi ce, nor the sacrifi ce of a person with-out the concept of hero.”22 In Greek literature the hero is both hated and praised. As sacrifi cial victim , the hero is both innocent and guilty. Th e tension associated with the hero is oft en worked out in the cult.23 Th e traditions of the pharmakós, associated as early as the sixth century b.c.e. with the philosopher Hipponax, de-scribe an enigmatic fi gure who was treated both as a social poison needing to be expelled, while at the same time as a medicine that brought healing to the city.24 Th e sacrifi ce, or death of the victim , carried the paradoxical power of expiating or expelling the threat to the popula tion at the same time it was able to generate a sense of civic identity—the safety of the city’s inhabitants. Th e noble death of the hero, both hated and despised, became in Christian cult one of the markers for understand ing the death of Jesus .25In addition to ancient Greece , one need only look at the sacrifi cial practices of the ancient Romans to see precisely how a sacrifi cial dis course was used as means of social cohesion and religio-political power. Th e Latin religio, from which our modern term originated, refers to the traditional honors paid to the gods by the state.26 Religio was the proper behavior that characterized the life of the Roman citizen. Cicero, address ing the Roman college of Pontifi ces, stated that one of the wisest things bequeathed by his Roman ancestors was “the maintenance of reli-gion by the proper administration of the state, and the maintenance of the state by the prudent interpretation of religion.”27 Roman religion was not concerned with distinguishing true from false beliefs; therefore, the obsti nacy of the early Chris-tians and their refusal to off er the traditional Ro man sacrifi ces was perhaps more a reshaping of the religio-political landscape of antiquity than it was a clash between polytheistic and mo notheistic beliefs.28 Th e pax deorum (peace of the gods) was 22.

Th e gods and state existed in a mutually benefi cial, if somewhat tension-fi lled relationship.29 Discerning proper action ensured the success of the people and the state. Without such balance cos-mic chaos would be inevitable. As an existential category, physical space as well as ritual action and practice were of paramount importance.30 As the Roman emperor was the chief benefactor to the state, local magistrates were patrons to the popula-tion within their juris diction, and the Roman pater was the chief benefactor to his local house hold. Complete with cultic sacrifi ces and ludi (games), the Roman religio-political agenda was about balancing power through political largesse and social benefaction. Just as honors were off ered to the benefactor in terms of praise and cult, the state off ered sacrifi ces to the gods. R. L. Gor don has written about the veil of power that surrounded the Roman empe ror and, by trickle-down eff ect, the local magistrates and patrons as well.31 When ever the emperor is pictured as the offi ciant in sacrifi cial practice he is depicted as veiled, ironically poised in humble dress, demonstrating his benefi cence to the community by off ering sacrifi ce . Th e people in turn off er the members of the imperial household cultic honors which in cluded sacrifi ces as a means both to praise the largesse received and to insure that it would be kept coming in the future. Not only did the proper sacrifi ces main-tain the vertical relationship with the gods, these same practices marked one as Roman . Th is discourse of sacrifi ce was a sign of civic pride. Identity and loyalty were bound together as a form of political power wielded by the state for the ben-efi t of all, guaranteed by the gods.While the sacrifi ces associated with the imperial cult have been for many histo-rians the linchpin of Christian and Roman antagonism, the imperial cult has been the scapegoat , as some historians consider it the pivotal element in Christianity’s rejection of Roman religious practices. In fact, the imperial cult constituted a va-nate determination of the monotheistic cult of Christ to tolerate no compromises” (Light from the Ancient Near East [London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1910], 338).29. In De Natura Deorum 1.3–4, Cicero argues “if the gods cannot and will not help us . . . if there is nothing on their side that touches our life, what reason have we to devote worship (cultus), honors (honores), and prayers (preces) to them?” In De Natura 1.46–49, Cicero’s character Velleius argued that the gods resembled the human form. Later in 1.77–82 his character Cotta argues against such a position. Lucretius, De Rerum Natura 5.146, summa rizes the Epicurean notion that the gods exist but are far removed from human comprehen sion. “Indeed, the nature of the gods, so subtle, so far removed from these our senses, scarce is seen even by intelligence of mind” (Th e Latin Library, n.p.

Th e idea that the emperor could be larger than life, even a divinelike hero, did have precedent in the Greek east long before the rise of the principate.33 S. R. Price has argued that aft er the death of Alexander a ruler cult in the Greek east developed, modeled on the cult of the gods. Such a form of political expression, complete with sacrifi cial honors, attempted to represent the new fl ow of Hellenistic power from center to periphery just as the power of the gods fl owed between earth and heaven in the tradi tional religious cults.34If Caesar’s imperium could be ritually honored with the largesse asso ciated with a sacrifi cial cult, so too could Jesus’ lordship in the king dom of the God of Israel. Not only was Jesus’ death valorized by Chris tianity’s appeal to a sacrifi cial discourse, his death was generative of a largesse, a type of cosmic power benefi cial for all. We fi nd such rhetoric in the Fourth Gospel. Caiaphas said that “it is bet-ter for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation de-stroyed” (John 11:50). Such benefi cence was meant to be exhortative as well. “No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends” (John 15:14). Christians were also called to emulate Jesus as well. Th e Markan Jesus makes the bold claim that “whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it” (Mark 8:35). While common English versions translate ἀπόλλυμι as lose, the force of the word means “die, perish, [or] destroy.”35 For the early Christians the death of Jesus eff ected not only societal and cosmic change, but it also had the correlative eff ect on those who followed him, uniting them as a distinct community within the Hellenistic world. Early Christians were able to draw on a sacrifi cial discourse present not only in the Graeco-Roman world, but from their Jewish rootedness as well. Hubert and Mauss noted that Israelite sacrifi ces served two irrecon cilable goals at the exact 32. For the variety of practices associated with the imperial cult, see D.

Aulus Gellius indicated many similarities between Scipio Africanus’s birth and that of Alexander the Great.

Robin Lane Fox claims that “representing power” is too conceptual. He challenges Price’s theory that the Hellenistic rulers caused a problem of categorization. “Stories of the fi rst divine honors are stories of people who are exploring new possibilities, not stories of people who are puzzled” (Pagans and Christians [New York: Knopf, 1987], 40, and in the notes, 686–87 n. 42). Such a conclusion is, however, less convincing than that of Price. Even if they are exploring new possibilities, there must be a motive for such behavior.35. William Arndt and F. Wilbur Gingrich, A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testa-ment and Other Christian Literature (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), 94. Not only does one perish or destroy their life for Jesus , but for the sake of the gospel as well. Of the three Synoptic Gospel writers it is only Mark who includes Jesus’ command to lose one’s life for him and the gospel, suggesting that at least by Mark’s time there was a developed notion of personal sacrifi ce as constitutive of the general Christian message."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"144Ritual and Metaphorsame time—the warding off divine anger and the obtaining of divine favor. “It is al-ready a remarkable fact that . . . sacrifi ce could serve two such contradictory aims as that of inducing a state of sanctity and that of dispelling a state of sin .”36 In their analysis of the va riety of sacrifi ces , they noticed that rites of consecration and rites of expia tion could both be eff ected through the same sacrifi cial descrip tion. Within the Jewish experience of early Christianity this is clearly evident in the Passover ritual. Even though the Torah equivocates in its description of the Passover victim , Deuteronomy (16:1ff .) describing it as a sacrifi ce and Exodus (12:6) describing it as a slaughter , the dead lamb was used for both expiation and sacralization regardless how one labels its death. According to the Exodus account, divine wrath is kindled and a murderous rampage is to begin. It is only the blood of the lamb that averts the deity’s murderous intent. In order to avert the wrath of God as destroyer, the Israelites were instructed to put the blood of the lamb on their doorposts (Exod 12:12). While the blood of the dead victim was used to ward off God’s wrath, the body of the victim was to be con sumed according to ritual prescriptions. Th ey were to ritually roast the victim , celebrating the day as a festival and even going so far as to share the meat with their neighbors (Exod 12:4, 14). Th e Passover ritual func tioned as a ritual rite of passage.37 Israel, located between Egyptian slavery and freedom in the promised land, ritualized its liminal experience through the power associated with the death of a victim . Th e Lamb both averted the wrath of God and marked out those who belonged to the God of Israel. Th e sacrifi ces of the Jerusalem Temple also functioned both to ex piate and sa-cralize. While the same sacrifi cial action could avert or drive away divine anger (thus purifying a petitioner), it had the correlative eff ect of altering the petitioner, thus allowing them access to holiness otherwise deprived. Th e Temple complex itself was a sacred space where the holiness of God had to be protected from the impurity of creation. Th e rituals of Yom Kippur attest to the need to protect the Temple space from the anger of the Israelite God. But in order for a human person to protect the holiness of God, they themselves had to become holy . In short, the closer one approached God the more one had to alter their identity. Th is is why the high priest sacrifi ced a bull fi rst to sanctify himself be fore he could make atone-ment for the sin of the people. In order to ob tain this purity one had to undergo socially prescribed rituals that were defi ned by Israel.38 Such prescriptions not only functioned as demonstra tions of sacred power, they also defi ned the people, the place, and the nature of their relationship to God. 36. Hubert and Mauss, Sacrifi ce, 58–59. In the sin off ering , once the blood has been taken into the sanctuary, the victim is rendered impure and must be burned outside the camp. In the peace off ering , once the blood has been poured at the base of the altar , portions of the victim are eaten. Hubert and Mauss ask: What diff erence was there between the impurity of the victim of the fi rst sin off ering and the sacred character of the victim of the peace off ering ? None—or rather there was no theological diff erence between the expiatory sacrifi ces and the sacrifi ces of sacralization.37. See Arnold van Gennep, Th e Rites of Passage (trans. M. Vizedom and G.

Leviticus 1–7 contains the detailed description of Israelite sacrifi ces."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"145Heyman: Sacrifice, Social Discourse, and PowerTh e author of the letter to the Hebrews captures this same reality for early Christianity. Jesus is described as both the off erer and the off ering . According to Hebrews the same atonement done repeatedly by the Jerusa lem high priest was done once for all by Jesus’ sacrifi ce ( 10:11–12). However, since Jesus was ultimately sinless, he did not need to off er any animal sacrifi ce , but he off ered himself in com-plete obedience (vis-à-vis his death) for the sins of all humanity for all time. His death was both noble and effi cacious.Th e eff ect of this atonement served both to remove any sin that might remain as well as to avert the wrath of God.39 Th is is why He brews indicates that Jesus died as a ransom “to set believers free from the sins committed under the fi rst covenant” ( 9:15). For the author of He brews, God the destroyer had to be appeased because of the impurity that had unwittingly accumulated since the foundation of the fi rst cove nantal agreement. Th e sacrifi ce of Jesus thus expiated , or atoned for, the “sin ” of the world. At the same time, the blood of Jesus eff ected a new sacralization of humanity—“those who are called [will] receive the promised inheritance” (9:15). Th e author here plays on the word διαθὴκη which can mean testament or covenant . In the Roman world the benefi cia ries of an estate only received the inheritance bequeathed in the last will and testament aft er the testator had died. Th us Hebrews emphasizes the real off ering of Jesus’ blood and the physical nature of his death as the guarantee of a new covenant promised by such prophets as Jeremiah (Jer 31:33). Th is new covenant resulted in “salvation for those who eagerly await” Jesus’ return (Heb 9:28). My point in the foregoing analysis is to show that Hebrews weds to gether the paradoxical polarities that are constitutive of sacrifi cial rituals in general. Th e sac-rifi cial off ering of Jesus’ blood both drives away and binds; it expiates and forges a communion with the same expression. In short, Hebrews utilizes the fullest pos-sible range of sacrifi cial rhetoric as it attempts to understand the death of Jesus . Th e fi nal exhortation in the letter commends believers to “continually off er to God a sacrifi ce of praise” ( 13:15). A Christian who off ers his or her life in God’s service, presumably through baptism, thus eff ects a metaphorical sacrifi ce . Th is cultic motif continues in the exhortation as believers are commanded to make a continual off ering (13:15). Th ese off erings are called a “sacrifi ce of praise.” No one can directly approach God, so these metaphorical sacrifi ces are off ered to God through Jesus . A “sacrifi ce of praise” is very much at home in the Hebrew Bible.40 Attridge has shown how the ten dency to describe this phenomenon as the spiritu-alization of sacrifi ce is problematic at best.41 Craig Koester also maintains that “the author is not spiritualizing the notion of sacrifi ce ,” since the believer is exhorted to serve their fellow Christians as well as strangers and prisoners (13:1–5) with con-crete acts of charity. Koester argues that these “sacrifi ces of praise” are not replace-39. Craig Koester, Hebrews (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 122. 40.

His unique approach to the death of Jesus unmistakably links Jesus’ death to the ritual and cultic traditions of Israel, only to deconstruct them in order to show believers that the sacrifi ce of Jesus was simply better and far more effi cacious than any other Jewish or Graeco-Roman sacrifi ce could have been.Th e Last Supper accounts in Synoptic Gospels also bear witness to the polyse-mous dimension of sacrifi cial discourse. As history interprets these texts, however, we fi nd that when Jesus’ fi nal meal is emphasized with covenantal overtones (Mark 14:24), the sacrifi cial dimension of expia tion has been downplayed (e.g., in the Protestant Reformation). Conversely, when Jesus’ fi nal meal is seen as a sacrifi ce that expiated sin (Matt 26:28), the idea of a communion meal is deemphasized (e.g., in the Catholic tradition).43 Th e description of Jesus’ fi nal meal and death in Mark’s Gospel also resonates with the pharmakós ritual of ancient Greece . He is mocked by the soldiers, dressed as a king, and crowned with thorns (Mark 15:16–20). He becomes the hero-king whose death is a sign of atonement for the purifi ca-tion of the world. For our purposes, it must be stressed that Jesus’ death, ritually symbolized through bread /wine as metaphors for his body/blood , had multiple levels of meaning, many of which can be subsumed under the various ancient meanings that utilize sacrifi cial discourse.44 Paul also makes numerous sacrifi cial references attempting to ex plain the death of Jesus to his readers. He uses terms that both under score the expiatory quality of sacrifi ce as well as the power Jesus’ sacri fi ce had to create an identity for a small community of believers. In 1 Cor 5:7 (nrsv) the expiatory nature of Jesus’ death is explained: “For our paschal Lamb, Christ, has been sacrifi ced .”45 However, in 1 Cor 9:13 Paul also underscores the idea that sacrifi ce has the power to create a cohesive identity among those who utilize such discourse. Paul writes: “Don’t you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple , and those who serve at the altar share in what is off ered on the altar ”? In 10:16–18 of 42. Koester, Hebrews, 578.43. One of the prayers used in the Catholic worship service calls the eucharistic ritual “the perfect sacrifi ce of Jesus ” (see Th e Roman Missal [New York: Catholic Book Publishing, 1985], 316).44. See Adela Yarbro Collins, “Finding Meaning in the Death of Jesus,” Th e Journal of Reli gion 78, no. 2 (1998): 175–96. In Matt 9:13 and 12:7 Jesus quotes Hos 6:6, indicating that he desires mercy more than sacrifi ce. Such a quotation does not necessarily mean that Jesus condemned the sacrifi cial system as a whole, but rather the particular way in which it was practiced, contrary to the opinion of Girard, Violence and the Sacred.45. Th e nrsv, reb, and niv translate this verse as “our Passover [or Paschal] lamb.” Th e kjv, asv, and nkj simply use “our passover .” Th e aorist passive ἐτύθη (“slaughter” or “sac-rifi ce”) implies the object “lamb” which is used by most English translations.

Most scho lars understand “sharing with the altar ” as a euphemism for sacrifi ces shared with the deity.46 His rhetoric reveals an under-standing of sacrifi ce as a cultic action that not only expiates , but also binds partici-pants with each other and with the deity in a type of ritualized communion meal. Paul expresses this idea again in 1 Cor 8 and 10–11. When quoting the eucharistic words of Jesus , Paul underscores what can only be ac counted as an early sacrifi cial understanding of Jesus’ death. In 1 Cor 11:25 Paul, quoting Jesus , says “this is my body which is for (ὑπέρ) you,” and, “this cup is the new covenant in my blood .” Th at Paul accepted the death of Jesus as a sacrifi ce is attested by his use of the word ὑπέρ where he locates the expiatory quality of Jesus’ death on behalf of, or for others.47 Such an idea is also expressed in Rom 3:24–25, where Paul suggests that God presented Jesus as a ἱλαστήριον, a “sacrifi ce of atonement .” As an expression of early Christian rhetoric we fi nd Paul, the Gospels, and Hebrews capitalizing on a sacrifi cial discourse to explain the death of Jesus and to forge an identity for Christians in the ancient world.Ascetic Sacrifice and Martyrdom Th e growth of Christianity in the Graeco-Roman world can be attributed to mul-tiple factors, not the least of which was the way Jesus’ followers employed a sac-rifi cial discourse through text and ritual. In addition to the texts of the New Tes-tament, Christianity also utilized a sacrifi cial discourse as it sought to describe the monk and the martyr . Th e rise of the holy man, as well as the tradition and the rhetoric of martyrdom , al lowed Christianity to augment a sacrifi cial discourse that was already present within its scriptures.48 Ascetics such as Antony of the Desert, fl eeing the urban centers of power and infl uence, were able to create an alterna tive world of power as they sacrifi cially off ered up food, drink, and their physical bodies. Th e ascetic was well-tuned to die to self in imitation of the bibli-46. See the detailed analysis of the θυσιαστήριον (altar ) in Wendell Willis, Idol Meat in Corinth: Th e Pauline Argument in I Corinthians 8 and 10 (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1985), 184–86. Interes tingly Willis points out (185) that Hugo Gressmann noted that “it was the divine numen which is referred to in this word” (italics added). Willis’s thorough analysis also reveals that θυσιαστήριον can simply refer to the sacrifi ce “placed upon the altar ” as is evidenced by the lxx’s use of this word (more than fi ve hundred times) to translate the Hebrew word for altar . Given Willis’s zeal to eliminate “sacramentalism” from the concept of κοινωνία (communion ) he dismisses the work of Gressmann. 47.

Douglas Burton-Christie notes that holiness in the desert meant giving concrete shape to a world of possibilities “stretching ahead of the sacred texts” by appropriating them into one’s life.49 Regard less of how these men and women actually lived, their admirers, such as Antony’s biographer Athanasius of Alexan-dra, craft ed a powerful rhetoric that transformed these socially liminal fi gures into saints.50 Th e sacrifi cial quality of the rhetoric used by their biographers created a posi tive charisma that accrued to such people as Simeon the Stylite, a liminal fi g-ure who sat atop a pole eating little or nothing while his body began to physically decay.51 Ascetic performers such as Simeon, as well as their biographers, realized that the body could never signal anything more than the lack inherent in created matter that by defi nition could never be overcome short of death, as Bataille would later suggest. However, admirers such as Th eodoret could easily look at the same ascetic body and see nothing less than saintly holiness .52 A conscious decision by the hagio graphers to valorize such physical alterity was only possible uti lizing the power of sacrifi cial discourse. In addition to the power of the desert ascetics, the martyr tradition also capi-talized on a potent sacrifi cial discourse. Unlike the ascetic, the martyr died like Jesus, thus altering their own identity, post mortem, as well as bequeathing power to their admirers through cult and relics. Unlike the desert ascetic, the martyr did not become a social actor until their death. Th ey were able to achieve what always eluded the ascetic. While the ascetic was a liminal fi gure always deprived of com-pletely imitating the sacrifi ce of Jesus , no such obstacle was present for the mar tyr . Martyrs , however, are created specifi cally through the rhetorical and discursive forms that are generated by their biographers. In a word, martyrs are primarily creations of the martyrologists, that is, those who specifi cally write and ascribe nobility to the deaths of those individuals typically considered enemies of the pre-vailing culture. Th at someone died a martyr is ultimately not subject to historical verifi cation. Even tracing the historical roots of martyrdom’s origins will remain a fruitless endeavor.53 49.

Just as Rome had used sacrifi cial discourse to cast its identity and fl ex its imperial power, early Christians also used the same discourse to interpret the executions of men and women such as Cyprian. As Polycarp of Smyrna approached his execution he is reported to have said, “May I be received this day as a rich and acceptable sacrifi ce , as you the God of truth . . . have prepared.” (Mart. Pol. 14.1–2).55 As the fl ames formed a vault around his body, the bystanders saw not burning fl esh, but “bread being baked” or “gold and silver being purifi ed” with a “delight-ful fragrance like incense . . . or some costly perfume.” (Mart.

Th e subsequent cult of the martyrs witnessed tremendous power localized in the relics and tombs of those who had off ered their lives.

Condemned as criminals, those who described these executions valorized the nobility of the mar tyrs’ cause and craft ed a powerful form of sacrifi cial rhetoric. Just as the New Testament was able to articulate the nobility of Jesus’ self-off ering , so too the martyr , dying in imitation of the Christian Son of God, did what no holy man of the desert could do, namely the off ering of one’s physical body in imitation of Jesus’ own self-off ering . Th e follow ers of Jesus had transformed and even valorized the inevitability of hu man suff ering. Even as the persecution of Christians ceased, the subse quent cult of the martyrs generated a power and an identity for later generations of believers who sought divine-like favors from the largesse of the martyr’s sacrifi ce . In short, early Christians, living in a sacrifi cial world, were able to capitalize on the power of sacrifi ce and thus secure a place for growth of Christianity. ConclusionsTh e growth of Christianity throughout the fi rst three centuries can be explained by many phenomena. One that has long been overlooked is the way that early Christians utilized a discourse of sacrifi ce . Such a dis course, however, must in-clude not only rhetorical expressions, but ritual and cultic practices as well. Th e cross-cultural phenomenon we call sacri fi ce has long witnessed to the inchoate need within human consciousness to separate the sacred from the profane. As an act of paradoxical negation, disorder and chaos are controlled as waste is valorized and social iden tity is constructed. Th e ancient world was steeped in the ideology of sacrifi ce as a way to control disorder, thereby accentuating the need within human consciousness for some sort of intimacy in the midst of cultural pluriformity. Cul-ture defi nes itself through comparison with the uncultured; however, alterity must be controlled. At times alterity can be valo rized and at times demonized. A dis-course of sacrifi ce has served ancient and modern societies to do both. Access to or avoidance of the sacred can be achieved and controlled through sacrifi ce . Th e power of sacrifi cial rhetoric and/or ritual is its ability to achieve what initially ap-pears as two contradictory goals at the same time. Th e same sacrifi cial off ering can expiate , ward off , propitiate, and atone and simultaneously unite, consecrate, and sacralize. Th e power of sacrifi ce is its ability to both drive away and bring to-gether at the same time. Th e ancient Greeks both ad mired and shunned the hero. Th e Romans off ered sacrifi ces to the gods (and to the imperial household) both to establish their religio-political power throughout the empire, as well as to appease capricious gods maintaining order and balance in the cosmos. Th e Jews used the Pass over lamb to avert the deadly rampage of an angry God and to mark them-selves as Israelites in a foreign land.

Believed to be exalted aft er his death and resurrection, the earliest followers of Jesus utilized the discourse of sacrifi ce as a means to both valorize his death and unite themselves as a distinct social group within the Roman world. Christian theology was able to explain the death of Jesus as a voluntary act of self-off ering . And just as Jesus obediently off ered his life to his God as a means to exalta tion, Christianity sought ways to mimetically provide believers access to the same good news. One of the rhetorical feats of the New Testament was its ability to explain Jesus’ sacrifi ce as far better and more complete than all others before. Th is rhetoric of self-off ering was taken up again in the second century when the desert ascetic harnessed divine power within the human body even as it began to die slowly through a regimen of strict physical discipline. Admirers of these holy men and women began to describe the healing power of these saints, thus elevating socially li minal fi gures to the realm of the sacred. While the ascetic could never fully at-tain the goal of complete physical privation and death, the martyr could. As some Christians refused to participate in the religio-political environment of the Roman world, they became a type of sacrifi ce as they imitated the biblical Jesus .

First, sacrifi ce in the Bible is a complex and multivalent category. Sacrifi cial rituals could comprise numerous distinct elements such as the selection of appropriate materials, their transport to the sanctuary, the burning rite on the altar in case of animal sacrifi ces slaughter and blood rites, and so on. Each of these activities had the potential of sparking multiple interpretive associations not only among the participants or observers, but also among modern scholars, and these associations are to be mul-tiplied by the number of ritual components. Depending on interpretive methods and approaches, the explanation of or theories about such ri tuals could yield con-siderably diff erent results. Th is explains the large number of answers to questions regarding “the meaning” of sacrifi ce . In light of such complexity it is more ap-propriate to slightly rephrase the question: What are the meanings of sacrifi cial rituals ? Th ey could be expli cit symbolic meanings or, as recent scholarship with emphasis on ritual theory affi rms, implicit latent meanings that are immediately linked to their referents. Second, sacrifi ce in the Bible is a phenomenon of the past. Its origins in the biblical world were actual rituals that were familiar to experts and laypersons who performed or witnessed them regularly. While the leg acy of such rituals continues through concepts and metaphors , it is a peculiar fact that Judaism abandoned the practice of actual sacrifi cial rituals aft er the destruction of the Second Temple ,1 while Christianity never adopted it, leaving mainly biblical texts from a distant 1. Recently, Guy Stroumsa argued that the abandonment of cultic sacrifi ce led to a deep transformation of Judaism and ushered in a new era of religious customs with a focus on, for example, issues of individual salvation and behavior (cf. G. Stroumsa, Th e End of Sacri-153"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"154Ritual and Metaphorpast as the modern interpreter’s access to these rituals. Such texts off er ample in-formation. Yet as testimonies representing diff erent time periods and geographi-cal areas they diff er in various aspects. Furthermore, some of these texts provide a range of interpretive comments to the ritual activities and use specifi c techni-cal terminology. Modern scholars inter preting such texts either focus on a few of the ritual activities de scribed therein, prefer to reference ritual sequences in their entirety, or stay attentive to the inter pretive comments in these texts. All in all, however, biblical texts off er a wealth of oft en incongruent information that resists scholarly attempts of fi nal systematization. Th ird, sacrifi ce in the Bible consists of rituals and metaphors . As rituals and metaphors are the topic of the present volume, I would like to elaborate in more detail on their relationship. Aft er being abandoned, Judean sacrifi cial rituals were survived by imagery , concepts, and terminology that became widely utilized as metaphors . While the latter are by their very nature secondary to sacrifi cial rituals , they do off er valuable insights into the suggestive potential of sacrifi cial rituals as perceived by interpre tive communities of the past. Yet Fika J. Janse van Rensburg notes that such biblical metaphors do not only pose problems to the mod ern in-terpreter because they date from a distant past.2 Th e interpreta tion of metaphors is a problem in itself that was already recog nized by Aristotle. While permitting the articulation of new concepts that can otherwise not be expressed, the use of meta-phors ultimately “results in some vagueness of interpretation.”3 Metaphor theory should therefore provide the foundation to the interpretation of sacrifi cial meta-phors , but cannot entirely resolve the ambiguity. When considering the relation between sacrifi cial metaphors and their back-ground, we are, in simplifi ed terms, dealing with the reception history of Hebrew Bible motifs in the New Testament.4 Th e problems related to this interrelation can-not be discussed exhaustively here; they have been touched upon in some of the fi ce: Religious Transformations in Late Antiquity [trans. S. Emanuel; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009]). 2. Van Rensburg references Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s adage: “Wer den Dichter will verstehen, muss in Dichters Lande gehen” (“Who wants to understand a poet, must go to the poet’s country”; see F. J. J. van Rensburg, “Metaphors in the Soteriology in 1 Peter: Identi fying and Interpreting the Salvifi c Imageries ,” in Salvation in the New Testament: Per-spectives on Soteriology [ed. J. G. van der Watt; NovTSup 121; Leiden: Brill, 2005], 409–35, 411; see also ibid., 117). In dealing with problems of biblical interpretation, a critical feature of “the poet’s country” is not only geographical and cultural diff erence, but also the circum-stance that the literature belongs to a world long gone. 3. See Van Rensburg, “Metaphors in the Soteriology,” 411; the quote is from p. 415. 4. Th is statement is simplifi ed since the Hebrew Bible features sacrifi cial metaphors in its own right (e.g., Isa 66:20; Ps 119:108) while the New Testament occasionally mentions actual cultic sacrifi ces (Matt 5:23–24). Yet either of these occurrences is a rather marginal phenomenon compared to the relative frequency of cultic sacrifi ce in the Hebrew Bible and sacrifi cial metaphors in the New Testament. In addition, sacrifi cial metaphors are not nec-essarily derived from Hebrew Bible rituals; they may just as well be allusions or echoes of cultic sacrifi ces from the Greco-Roman environment (cf. M. Vahrenhorst, Kultische Sprache in den Paulusbriefen [WUNT 230; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2008], 12–15)."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"155Conclusioncontributions to the present vo lume. I would like to supplement those results with some comments on the specifi c diffi culty of how the image (also called image-contributor ) transfers meaning to the subject (also called image-receptor or refer-ent), exactly which aspects and attributes are transferred, and what they con vey in the new context given its specifi c semantics. According to recent metaphor theory, the transfer of meaning is not unilateral but reciprocal. Th e referent also transfers meaning to the image , which means that the metaphorical use of the term sacrifi ce had its impact on the common understanding of ritual sacrifi ce .5 Th is insight might explain the dichotomy between the understand ings of ritual sacrifi ce as it emerges from the Hebrew Bible and the widely used modern secu-larized metaphor of sacrifi ce which gradu ally shift ed toward, and has come to em-phasize, aspects of killing and death. Th e term sacrifi ce , therefore, has a spectrum of meanings, and ultimately these meanings are not static, but in fl ux. Whoever studies sacrifi ce needs to determine its specifi c meaning(s) in a particular histori-cal context, and whoever employs the term sacrifi ce today needs to defi ne it as well. Indeed, the dichotomy between these diff erent mean ings might at times be considered important enough to raise the question whether the metaphorical use is still congruent with the term referring to rituals. On the other hand, soteriologically and christologically relevant is the question of what precisely the notion of the “sacrifi ce of Jesus” im plies. Despite the frequent use of this term in modern church and theol ogy, New Testament texts (with the exception of Hebrews ) rarely ever attribute the term sacrifi ce to Jesus ; indeed, the four Gospels never do. Th e term sacrifi ce, therefore, does not belong to the main soteriological or christological interpretive categories in the New Testament. It may, furthermore, be noted that sacrifi cial metaphors referring to Jesus do not necessarily convey only his death, as the specifi c choice of cultic terminology in, for example, Eph 5:2 (“off ering and sacrifi ce for God as a pleasing odor”) suggests as well as the immediate context of moral admonitions.6 Th e scent of sacrifi ce has been referenced repeatedly by Paul (2 Cor 2:14–16; Phil 4:18), thus attesting to its impor tance for the overall perception of sacrifi ce . Beyond these issues, the contributions to this volume show that new method-ological approaches create new perspectives on sacrifi ce . Th e emphasis on rhetoric and discourse has, for instance, led to a shift from historical inquiry to an aware-ness that stories about sacrifi ce are diff erent from sacrifi cial rituals ; they ought to be distinguished in modern theoriz ing. Th is methodological emphasis also insti-gated scholarly attentiveness to the meaning and rhetorical purpose of technical terminology of the sacrifi cial cult in its cultic and secular contexts and provides a link to rabbinic and early Christian communities, both of which relied on the authoritative character of such discourse to construct their respective identities 5.
