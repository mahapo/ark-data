X"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Chapter I INTRODUCTION The Mandaeans are a remarkable remnant of a religious com-munity that now lives in southern Iraq and Iran near the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers. When their existence was first made known to Europe in the sixteenth century, the Mandaean community numbered about 15,000. In 1875 there were about 4,000. Today there are still a few thousand left, not only in lower Iraq and Iran, but also in cities in other areas of these countries. How-ever, with the advent of modern education, the young people are being weaned away from their ancient way of life. The priesthood which carries little prestige for these ambitious young men, is in danger of extinction. Some thirty-five years ago Mandaean studies were in vogue, and occupied the attention of New Testament scholars, much as the Dead Sea Scrolls are doing today. Then Mandaean studies suffered a decline in the 30's and 40's. In the 50's and 60's there have been signs of renewed interest, mainly in Europe.1 With the ex-ception of Burkitt, Kraeling, and Gordon, Americans have done little for Mandaean scholarship. 1 For a survey of recent Mandaean stucies, see the writer's article, \"The Present Status of Mandaean Studies,\" JNES, XXV (1966), 88-96. 1"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"What is most remarkable about the Mandaeans is their reli-gion which is syncretistic, gnostic, and baptistic. The fact that theyare the sole surviving sect of the gnostic tradition lends special significance to their writings. In the earlier period of interest, exaggerated claims for the bearing of the Mandaeans on the New Testament and on Christianity were made. Today together with the Coptic Gnostic codices from Nag-Hamadi the Mandaean texts can give us a better insight into the evolu-tion of gnosticism in the early Christian era. The religious and magical texts are written in Mandaic--an eastern Aramaic dialect akin to the Aramaic used in the Baby-lonian Talmud. The religious texts are written on manuscripts dating for the most part to medieval times--the earliest dates from the 8th century A.D. These were probably composed in the early Islamic times, but contain materials from even earlier periods. The magical bowl texts included in our work are the earliest of Mandaic writings and date from the Sasanian era, about 600 A.D. The one lead amulet (Text 22) which we have in-cluded in our collection comes from about 400 A.D. and is the earliest known Mandaic text. A. ARAMAIC MAGICAL BOWLS The Mandaic magic bowls are of the same type as bowl texts written in Aramaic and in Syriac which come from the same area and the same period. Magic, it seems, has a pragmatic appeal that is limited neither by culture nor by religion. The Aramaic bowl texts together with similar Syriac and Mandaic texts, includ-ing the first texts published in 1853 and those published up to 2"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1913,were discussed by James Montgomery in his definitive work, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur. Franz Rosenthal in ~ie aramAistische Forschung seit Theo. Neldeke's Ver~ffentlichungen discusses the magical texts published up to 1939. For a review of Aramaic and Syriac magical bowl texts published since the lat-ter date, see the writer's article, \"Aramaic Magic Bowls,\" ~· LXXXV (1965), 511-23. The publication of texts since Montgomery's work has con-siderably enlarged the area from which bowls have come. Writing in 1913 Montgomery had said, \"The provenance of this material is thus confined to a small region, extending from Nippur and Bis-maya on the south to Asshur on the north, and lying on both sides o£ the Euphrates.2 We now know of a number of bowls that have come from Khuzestan in Iran. Text 31 is said to have come from Ramadan in Iran. The Aramaic text which I published in the arti-cle cited above came from Nehavand, Iran. As for the date of the magic bowls, Montgomery placed them in the pre-Islamic period about 600 A.D. Almost all of the texts published since Montgomery's time seem to come from close to this date. Javier Teixidor on the basis of epigraphy would date the Edessene Estrangelo (Syriac) texts which he has published some-what after this date.3 The occurrence of the Arabic word r~Y 2James A.

B. MANDAIC MAGICAL INCANTATIONS The first Mandaic bowl inscription was published by Pognon, the French consul at Baghdad, in 1892.4 This appears as text 17 in our work. The bowl came from Bismaya (Adab) south of Nippur. Then in 1898-99 Pognon published 31 more texts in his work, Inscriptions mandaites des coupes de Khouabir. Sixteen of these appear as texts 1-16; those which have been omitted are mainly duplicates. Khuabir is on the right bank of the Euphrates about 30 miles northwest of Musayyib and west of Baghdad. It was re-ported to Pognon that these bowls were found upside down, and in some cases one on top of the other. In 1904 Jacques de Morgan reproduced in Mission scientifigue en Perse photographs of Mandaic magic bowls, which are unfor-tunately too indistinct to be read. In 1909 Mark Lidzbarski transliterated into Hebrew charac-ters and translated five Mandaic bowl texts in ~phemeris f~ semitische Epigraphik, I, 89-106. The first three bowls are in the Berlin Museum: VA 2419, VA 2984, VA 2435; the last two are in the Louvre: A.O. 25?6 and A.O. 2629. The first two appear in our work as texts 18 and 19, and the last two as texts 20 and 21. 4Henri Pognon, \"line incantation centre 1es genies malfai-sants en mand~ite,\" Memoires de la Societe de Linguistique, VIII (1894), 193-234. 4"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Lidzbarski's text 5 is a duplicate of Montgomery's Aramaic text 11 and Fognon's text 25; his texts 1-3 are similar to Pognon's texts 15-18. Montgomery included three Mandaic bowl texts in !ramaic In-cantation Texts from Nippur, nos. 38-40, which appear in our col lection as texts 22-24. These bowls are in the University of Pennsylvania Museum: CBS 2941, CBS 29?1, and CBS 9005~ In going through the bowls from Nippur in the Museum, the writer recently found three poorly legible Mandaic bowls which have not been pub· lished. The parts that can be read will be published as part of a forthcoming article. In 1930 G. R. Driver published a Mandaic text in ~!· XXVII (1930), 61-64. This has not been included in the present work. Gordon published in ArC, IX (193?), 95-106, three Mandaic texts listed as texts M, N, and 0. These appear as texts 26-28. Text M is again similar to Pognon's texts 15-18, and also to the first three texts of Lidzbarski. On the exterior is the picture of a magician with uplifted arms to scare off the demons. Text N is a duplicate of Lidzbarski's fourth text. Text 0 is partly paralleled by Montgomery's text 38. Text M is no. 8669 in the Harvard Semitic Museum; text N is no. 91731 from the Ashmolean(? collection; and text 0 is no. 91?24 in the British Museum. Four years later Gordon published six partial texts in Q£• X (1941), 276-?8, 344-45, 347, 353-58, along with a number of Aramaic texts. Of these four have been included in the present work. Text 29 is a bowl marked \"92\" in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England. Text 30 comes from the Hilprecht Collec-tion of Babylonian Antiquities and probably comes from Nippur. 5"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Text 31 is no. 25.498 in the Malm~ Museum in Sweden, and comes from Hamadan, Iran.

This has not been included in the present work. Text 33 is a hitherto unpublished bowl from the Yale Baby-lonian Collection, YBC 2364, which the writer examined for publi-cation through the courtesy of Dr. William W. Halle, curator of the collection. A detailed commentary will appear in a separate article. Unfortunately the exact provenance of the bowl, which was purchased about thirty years ago by Raymond P. Dougherty; is unknown. It is probably from some site in Iraq. Because of its importance I have inc~uded in this study the lead amulet published by Lidzbarski in 1909.5 It appears as text 22 and is the most interesting specimen of magic in our collec-tion. As mentioned earlier it is the earliest of all the Mandaic writings. The writing was inscribed with a nail, and the letters are very small. Such Mandaic lead scrolls are very difficult to read.6 The scroll would be rolled up and worn in a container. 5Mark Lidzbarski, \"Ein mandllisches Amulett,\" Florilegium ou recueil de travaux d'erudition dedies aM.

Lidzbarski's lead amulet contains a long text of 278 lines, written on three pieces with the breaks at line 9? and line 222. The script in general is similar to that of the bowls with a few archaic features. The ~. even when it should not be so connecte~ is linked to the left, and is therefore difficult to distinguish from a 1. The n is never joined to the right. The age of the text is seen in the sparse use of vowel letters. The spelling of M~~n1 MY,JO with a consonantal Y is not found elsewhere. In line 94 after the negative M7, an imperfect form is preserved which maintains a -~ preformative, M~oo~M7. otherwise the 3rd person imperfect preformative is always -7, and never -J. It is for these and other reasons that Lidzbarski dated this inscription about 400 A.D. There are many other types of magical charms used by the Mandaeans even today. Lady Drawer has published many of these later magical texts, including a number of phylacteries, a book of black magic, and a book of the Zodiac. All of these are in the Drawer Collection (D.C.) of Mandaean manuscripts in the Bod-leian Library, Oxford. Her first attempt at translating a Man-daean text was a magical incantation (D.C. 21) against the Evil Eye.8 This spell was to be written on a tin or leaden bowl and was to be read over a jar o·f water. In 1938 she published a long ?E. S. Drawer, \"A Mandaean Bibliography,\" ~· (1953), 38. 8E. s.

In 1939 Lady Drower published three shorter phylacteries which are found in D.C. 33 and also in D.C. 43: \"Suba lbisna\" or \"I put on seven\"; \"csirna htimna\" or \"I am bound and sealed\"; and \"bYawar Ziua nisimtai\" or \"By Yawar Ziwa my soul.\"ll These three phylacteries guard women in travail, women who are nursing, those who see apparitions, children who are terrified in sleep, and those twisted by wind (flatulence). 9E. s.

The book contains curative charms, charms against the Evil Eye, charms to induce pregnancy or to protect the embryo, charms against enemies and demons, charms to stop children from weeping, charms to assist the fowler and the fisherman, love-charms and jealousy-spells. There is even a charm for one who grinds his teeth.13 Magical figures and images similar to those of the bowls occur. One of the charms against an enemy may be an example or the black magic against which the white magic of the bowls was to work. It reads as follows: And she is turned away from her village (the village of) N., and from her husband N. and from her children and her district: she is turned away from her husband, her sons ~d her daughters and from her home, so that she wanders away from it. Write and bury at thine enemy's outer door, and she (or he) will be overthrown by thee.14 A love charm to be written on a gazelle skin and buried at the mouth of three springs reads as follows: By the name of the Great Life have I adjured you, ye 12 E. s.

In 1946 Drawer published another phylactery, \"Pi§ra £-Sambrci' (D.C. 10), in which the plant rue is personified and is besought to deliver the client from disease-demons.16 The date on the manuscript is A.H. 1249, i.e. 18?1.

Each day of the month had its particular de-mon. It was hopeless to even read incantations against some ca-tegories of demons.: Against the demon which cometh on the fifth of the month. He is deaf; blind he is and sees not, nor hears; therefore he cannot be cured.19 There is unmistakable Islamic influence in these charms. In one of them we read: He tha~ cometh on the eve of the fifteenth of the month. He is a good fellow: he is afraid of the Qur'an (especially) of the Yasin chapter or of the Throne Verse, and will leave him (the possessed man).20 In addition to the manuscripts cited above, there are a num-ber of magic texts in the Drower Collection that are still unpub-lished, including the longest and most popular of the protective texts: \"Zrazta £-Hibil Ziua\" or \"The Protection of Hibil Ziwa\" (D.C. 44).

In the following pages we will analyze the various features of the Mandaic bowl magic and its·praxis, seeking to illustrate them by parallels from the Aramaic magic texts in particular and from the broader world of ancient and of not so ancient magic in general. C. THE CLIENTS Many of the names of the clients are Persian. We have the following elements that recur in the names: -ducht or \"daughter\"; !:!ihr-or \"Mithra\"; .!!~or \"Ahuramazda\"; and the dimunitive end-ing -£Z· Other names are Semitic. (See Glossary C.) Two names that may reflect an Indian origin are Hindu (text 25) and its feminine counterpart Hinduita (text 23). The Greek name Timo-theos occurs in text 19. There is a name which must clearly re-fer to a Christian, Sebre-le Yeso, \"His-hope-in~Je~' in text [4]. The Arabic name Yazid occurs in text 7, but this is not 12"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"necessarily a sign of any Muslim influence.22 Speaking of the situation in post-Islamic times, Lady Drower has written: Every Mandaean has two names, his Malwa§aa, or Zodiacal name, and his laqab or worldly name. The latter is usually a Muhammadan name and is used for all lay purposes, the for-mer is his real and spiritual name and is used on all reli-gious and magic occasions.

This was probably based on the ortho-dox Mandaean aversion to Judaism.

He cites an interesting passage from Gy 2?9:3 ff. where the angels are listed together with \"sorcery-spirits, demons, devils, etc.\" In the light of this usage in the later Mandaean manuscripts, he found it surprising to discover that in the Mandaic magic bowls pub-lished by Pognon the propitious beings with few exceptions are 83Angelicus M.

We have al-ready spoken of the later Mandaean phylactery to the personified Rue. Sundberg in his study of ku!-t;a or \"Truth\" concludes that in Mandaean texts there is no sharp dividing line between person and thing, between one person and another, between one thing and ano-ther, or between spiritual things and material things.86 Finally, there are a number of distinctively Mandaean beings and agents who play a role not only in the Mandaic bowls but also in the Aramaic and Syriac bowls.

To complicate matters there are several contradictory accounts. Originally there was a triad of divine beings: 1) Pira Ra9ba or the \"Great Fruit\"; 2) Ayar Ziwa Rabba or the \"Ether of Great Brilliancy\"; and 3) Mana Rabba, the King of Light, who was su-preme. From him proceeded the Great Jordan (cf. 11:39) which permeates the realm of ether. He then called into existence Hiia Qadmaiia, the \"First Life,\" who as the revealed and govern-ing deity is entitled to chief worship (cf. the frequent ·expres-sion, \"Life is victorious!\"). The First Life called into exis-tence Yosamin (cf. 22:244), the Second Life. According to one account it is the Second Life, and according to another the First 4 Life, who created the Uthras (cf. 22:209) or subsidiary beings who act as messengers and intercessors. ·Their name signifies \"treasures\" according to N~ldeke, and \"emanations\" according to Lidzbarski. Manda £-Hiia (cf. 22:16), a savior spirit concerned with the spiritual welfare of man was created. He revealed himself to man as the incarnation of three Uthras, who are brothers: Hibil (i.e. Abel), Sitil (i.e. Seth), and Anos (i.e. Enoch). Hibil (cf. [20: 20])xis closely identified with Manda £-Hiia. Sitil against whose soul the souls of men are weighed in the scales of judgmen~ does not occur in our texts. Anos the Uthra does not appear, but Anos occurs as the name of the clientxof text 8. The Third Life is Abatur (cf. 22:244), who is called the fa-ther of the Uthras. As Abatur Muzania he holds the scales of judgment in the border of light near the lower regions. (For a description of Abatur and his work, see E. S. Drower, Diwan Aba-39"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"tur, or Progress Through the Purgatories.) Below Abatur is an immense void, with troubled black water. His reflection becomes congealed as Ptahil (cf. [42:14]).8? Ftahil is commissioned to make Adam and Eve, but he is unable to make them stand. There-upon the First Life sends Hibil, Sitil~ and Anos to infuse the spirit of Manna Rabba himself into man. Man is therefore a com-posi te creat.ure with the \"spark of the divine\" enclosed in a body of matter. Salvation consists in the \"gnosis\" or knowledge of man's celestial origins, and redemption consists in the deliver-ance of the soul from the body at death and its journey back to the world of light. From the union of Ruha (cf. 22:201), the queen of darkness, and Ur, the devil, come successive progenies of seven,twelve, and five creatures. The first two sets are transformed by Ptahil in-to the Seven Planets and the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. Tibil (cf. 31:23) or the World appears as a sphere bounded on three sides by the ocean and on the north by a mountain of turquoise. With the exception of a single couple, mankind is destroyed by the sword, fire, and flood on three occasions. On the second oc-casion the couple who survive are called Ram (cf. 20:16) and Rud.

In addition to the invocation o! gods, a common feature of magical texts is the narration of myths, in which the magician or client often identifies himself with the subject of the story. Thus in text 22 after the appeal of the magician Yokabar !or help to Manda ~-Hiia (22:16-18), we have a narration involving several Mandaean divinities, Life, the great Deity, calls to the Uthra Hibil (22:28), who tells him about the troubles that are beset-ting the client, Per Nukraya (22:41-49). Life then calls to Yawar, an Uthra, whom he sends to intervene !or Nukraya, It seems that it is Hibil himself who goes in the personality of Yawar (22:??) and chases the evil Planets away (22:100). What is interesting is that the first person is used throughout the story. This narrative bears an unmistakable resemblance to the wel~-known theme o! Marduk and Ea which recurs in the Sumerian and Akkadian incantations. In this motif Marduk goes to his !a-ther Ea to report a calamity that has befallen and to ask !or Ea's advice.

It is often whispered or mumbled or spoken so rapid-ly that it cannot be understood.l33 Then, too, there is no doubt that the suitable moment would have to be chosen in accordance with the astrological horologues. The Mandaean Book of the Zodiac gives us explicit directions for the charming of particular demons that came on any given day. The directions vary even for the different periods of the same day. We have, for example, the following instructions: He (the demon) who cometh on the eve of the twenty-second of the month.

Layard thought that they might be utensils for the dead. Schwab and Rodwell suggested that they were used for hydromancy, that is, divination by water. Ellis had supposed that they held some liquids or semi-liquids. Halevy ar-gued against this, pointing out that the water would have effaced the writings and that the lips were too thick for drinking.

In our Mandaic text 5:10-11 we read: \"I who have seen them placed as a cover over them the great vault which is over the sorceries.\" Gordon objects that the last thing one would want to do was to trap the demons on the premises. Indeed, many of the phrases in the incantations, such as the divorce for-mulae, seek to evict the demons from the house. Gordon feels that the practice of upsetting the bowls was intended to \"upset\" the curses on the basis of sympathetic magic. In the final analysis, however, one need not expect logical consistency from magic. It may be that the upsetting of the bowls was meant to act sympa-thetically--as in the upsetting of the Babylonian clay boats--135 and also to enclose the demons, which strikes us as contradictory but which may not have been so to the ancients. In the Akkadian incantation series Namburbi, bowls of clay together with other items were used in a rite to ward off evil from the door of the house. An image of clay was placed in the bowl.

We thus have in magic a melting-pot of various nationalities and of differing religions. As noted above the very strangeness of. the magic of another culture makes it attractive. But if we are to seek the sources of the several elements of Mandaean magic, we must admit that in many cases it is not possible to tell whether similarities are the result of borrowing or of independent invention. Proper nouns and borrowed terms, however, do allow us to assign certain features to a given culture. Montgomery felt that the Aramaic magic bowls were closer to the Egypto-Hellenistic magic than to the Babylonian.151 It is my impression, however, that the Mandaic magic bowls owe their great-est debt to the Mesopotamian world. The dialogue formula that we find in text 22 is clearly based on the Marduk-Ea motif.

So also is the comprehensive list of baleful spirits. Many of the spirits are directly derived from Mesopotamian origi-nals. First and foremost are the ubiquitous liliths. The Sedim are no longer protective genii, but have been demoted to the sta-tus of devils. The planetary deities, outlawed in the official Mandaean texts are invoked in magic. In text 22 we have a parade of them: Samis the Sun, Bel or Jupiter, Nergal or Mars, Kewan or Saturn, the Moon, Dlibat or Venus, and Nebo or Mercury. It is not possible to say that the emphasis on names had its ultimate,home in~· as Egypt was not alone in this feature. The Egyptian's magic prepared him especially for the next world. It is the Mandaean's religion that does this for him; his magic helps him to make the best of this world. The demiurge Ptahil is no doubt a formation from Ptah and El, and not from the word \"to open.\" Ptah was also the Memphite demiurge. The Mandaeans even have a tradition that the Egyptians were considered to have been Mandaeans.153 Egypt rather than Mesopotamia was the country in which identification with the gods was strongly stressed in magic. Although the practice of the Mandaeans in identi!ying themselves with their divine prototypes may not be derived from Egypt at all, it is in any case akin to it. In spite of the fact that many of the names are Persian, l52cf. also w.

It is true that in the ritual there are many things which resemble aspects of the Zoroastrian rites.154 Despite their antipathy to them, the Mandaeans are indebted to the Jews for a number of elements as far as magic is concerned. Adonai appears as the king of the demons. The many names of the angels are built on Jewish prototypes. As Lidzbarski has pointed out, at a later age and in the official religion it is the Man-daean Uthras which are prominent and not the Jewish angels. Al-though it is noteworthy that no Scriptures are quoted, the words \"amen\" and \"selah\" occur.

When the polemic is fully developed against Jesus, it is evident from the accusations that the charges were those against the la-ter Nestorian Church and not against the early Christians. (Cf. the accusations of Muhammad against Christianity.) In a passage in Das Johannesbuch, 103, cited by Drower, Jesus comes to John to be baptized. John (Yahia) answers \"Jesu-messiah in Jerusalem\", \"Thou hast lied to the Jews and hast deceived men and pr~ests!\" and accuses Jesus of ascetism,(sic) monasti-cism, celibacy, and breaking the Sabbath. Jesus vehement-ly denies his accusations and continues to demand baptism. John proposes a series of riddles and paradoxes which Jesu-messiah answers in a plausible manner.156 With the decipherment of Linear A from Crete by Cyrus Gordon a new Minoan dimension has been added to the Mandaean problem. Almost all of the Linear A inscriptions are incised on clay tab-lets. There are, however, two clay bowls from Knossos that are inscribed with ink spirally on the interior as our magic bowls.

Another link with the Mediterranean is the word Jordan, which plays a prominent role in Mandaean religion (cf. texts 11:39, 16: 10, etc.). Scholars have generally assumed that this is a remi-niscence of the Jordan River in Palestine. But the Mandaeans say that this word means \"river\" or \"flowing water\" and that it has n·o reference to the River Jordan in Palestine.159 In the cosmologi-cal accounts the Jordan is represented as a.river of white water, as \"the living water,\" and \"the gleaming, and lustrous water.\" Gordon has pointed out that the word \"jordan\" in the Hebrew Bible is not a proper noun, for it appears with the definite article or some other qualifier with but two exceptions.

Kraeling, for example writes: The Mandaic codices, for example show the use of a small circle, like that of the Syriac ~ to indicate the letter Aleph. The only analogy is that of the Nabatean and Palmyrene inscriptions, where Aleph is represented by a l~ne ending in a small circle. The Mandaic codices lack the initial downward stroke, the line, but the lead amulet, published by Lidzbarski as the earliest Mandaic monument, still shows that line connected with the cir-cle.162 More recently Macuch has pointed out the resemblances between the Mandaic letters and those of the Elymean inscriptions from Tang-i-Sarvak between Fars and Khuzestan.163 These Elymean inscrip-tions, deciphered and published by Henning in Asia Minor, II (1952), 151-78, probably come from the 2nd century A.D. 161For supplementary letters and for the meanings attached to each letter see Drower, The Mandaeans of Iraq, pp. 239-44. 162carl H.

The head of l ~s open, the K does not become triangular, the 0 is shorter and less elliptical, the ::> and the :> have not assumed as sharp an angle as. in the later script. 2.3 There is no distinction phonemically maintained between an original nand a ~.164 In our transcription, however, we use ~ to represent the letter !h• which is used in the final position only.

There is no separate sign for a swa. In short open syllables where we might expect the dropping of a vowel as in Syriac, a vowel sometimes appears and sometimes does not. This would lead us to suspect that the vowel letters in these cases stand for the swa. 2.7 The ligatures of a 1 with a ~. n, or l, can lead to con-fusion. In these cases one of the multiple ridges may be omitted.

The X and ~ are difficult to distinguish even in the best of manuscripts, In the 15th and 16th centuries the scribes confused ~ and X, and replaced the former with the latter in many manuscripts.

Each letter is supposed to invoke a spirit of light and is a thing of power. It is a practice to write the letters separately and to sleep each night with a let-ter beneath the pillow. If the sleeper see·s in a dream something which will enlighten him, the letter upon which he slept that night is taken to a silversmith and a repli-ca in gold or silver is made and worn around the neck as an amulet.165 But elsewhere she notes that the copyists of magical texts are notoriously inaccurate and that their transcription is often hur-ried. Few of the magician's clients are literate enough to cri-ticize what the magician has written for them. \"Of the Mandaeans themselves, laymen who read and write the Mandaic script are rare, and even literates understand little of the written and classical Mandaic.\"166 2.11 Assuming that the situation was not too different even at the time of our texts, we should not be surprised to find numerous errors. When the writer perceived his error, he sometimes crossed it out, as in 23:6 where the word ~n'7'7 has been crossed out. Sometimes he wrote a letter above the line as in 25:4 where the writer mistakenly wrote a n and then correctly wrote a i above. 165 E. S.

There are often omissions of letters as in 10:1, K,1 for K,11; in 5:8 and 6:7 nx7 probably stands for nx?n. In 5:14 we have l~nK7 for l~noK7.

The words Kni~D ([46:7]) and x~110 (31:12) may come from the word for moon, Mi~O, *MinD. The n in pronominal suffixes very often drops out.

(SeeN. § 67.) 3.21 In our texts 0 is sometimes found immediately before ~, and J before T or 1. A.

In 17:5 we have the exceptional case of z.c~11MO \"fetters\"; cf. l(,1l'CO at 24:4.) Against Spitaler Macuch has argued on the ba-sis of evidence from Mandaic informants and on comparative evidenre that these combinations are phonetic representations of the dis-similation of doubled consonants (Ma. pp. XLVII-LIII). Examples of this phenomenon in our texts are as follows: z.c~o1v (5 :10); x,,,~or (13 :22); z.c7~~7Jm (31:21); z.c,7,~on7 (10:6); l<nl<,~rJl<rf( 16 :6); l<TlY (25 :4); z.c~ TJ7J ( 33:10); KY1JO ( 22:16) ; and-OX1J7J (22 :165).

Somewhat similar is the case of z.c7z.c7(7J)7J ~1:20) or·z.c~7J7J (16:13). In z.cnM,l71 (32:19) consonant 2 in the second half of the word is dropped.

Cyrus Gordon, Ugari-tic Manual, p. ??.) ~often occurs at the end of a verb as an enclitic: K~~n.,.'Y,-xnwhich were in me\" (5 :12); mi01JlCZI nJn~7 \"on which there is no passage\" (16:6); it occurs thus with the follow-ing verbs: v~1 \"to cling,\" Ken \"to sin,\" ,nl' Etpa. \"to be on guard, \" 1P~ \"to command, \" and K\"'T.D \"to dwell.\" A voiceless variant occurs in the phrase, o~,,,~ \"into Piriawis\" (16 :10). Another variant ~~ occurs in the phrase M'7J?~~ \"with the voice\" (33:10). It combines with substantives to form compound preposi-tions and prepositional phrases: n~w~1J \"in the beginning of\" (21:21); 1D \"in the midst of\" (22:134); 11J~K~JJ \"before you\" (16 :4); also K~J~~T K7~ \"prematurely\" or literally \"without times\" (22:70).x 7.3 7 means \"to, at, from, for,\" for example: nn~~7 n7,1nn \"let there be to his house\" (28:12); nJK~7 \"at the door• (22:9); K1T71 ••• K,~~ l~\"from the four ••• and from her husband\" ([4: 103"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"7]); il'nl<oJZl \"kept from him\" (22:40); ~\"07 \"to fullness\" (29:25); M\"ODJ7 \"to butcher\" (10:9); rJJ\":J7 \"for evil\" or·\"evilly\" (17:16). As in Syriac 7 serves to denote the direct object of the verb: M\"7 1MOM7 \"cursed me\" (15:17); Mn0177 M\"OM \"heal the curse\" (18c: 4); 1K:)1\"?.J7 i17v:Jro\"n~you dismiss Farrukan\" (18b:8); as in the last example, 7 also occurs as an enclitic on numerous verbs, as for example: 7.lM \"to say,\" M1n \"to be,\" M1n \"to show,\" MZl\" \"to swear,\" 10J \"to guard,\" K1j7 \"to call,\" p:Jro \"to dismiss,\" etc. 7 also in-dicates possession: M\"7nY, \"which belongs to me\" (15:20). A variant M7 occurs in the phrase, i1J:JM7 \"to his sons\" ([42: 25]). 7.4 .]2 means \"from, with, because of,\" as for example: MJ\"9Y l\"lnM\" 1T M\"YV< 1Zl \"repulsed from the four corners\" (1 :4); 1 1np7o, ill\"Zl \"with w.bich you ascended\" (16:19); M\"ZlnMn M:JMV/ 1Zl \"with (or by) the seven sealers\" (22:7-8); 1M:JY7, M:JYJ 1Zl \"because of the anguish of our heart\" (19:8). A partitive use is: 11\"MZlT 10 M\"nMro \"drink of their blood\" (29 :26). It occurs with pronouns as follows: \"Ml\"Zl Mj7nK1Zl \"removed from me\" (20:12); j7M9l MJ\"Zl, \"who from her departed\" (33:21); X Ml\"M:J 11J\"MJ\"Zl \"from you I ask\" (22:162-64); 11\"Ml\"Zl 117701, \"those whom it killed fran among them\" (33:16). It occurs frequently in compound phrases: lMn \"n l\"Zl \"from below you\" (15 :24); l\"JM, 7X:Ji7 1Zl \"because we are\" (22:202); 1Zl xm, M\"mn \"under Ruha\" (22:203); vXnT\"T, i1ZlM,1P 10 \"out of the presence of Ziztaq\" (31 :20). nxroY{ro}~ \"from the beginning\" (21 :21). 7.5 OM,1j? means \"before\" as in: Xnx'7x CX,1i7 0117, 71J \"everyone w.no stood before the god\" (15 :16); M:J, MZl1rJJ CM,1i77 \"before the Great Name\" ( ( 42 :6-7]); \"Ml T 1:J, i1Zl,1j7 nK7TX1 \"and departed before 104"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Buznai\" (33:21-22). 7.6 ~means \"under,\" as in Kn1i x~n1n 11n71~ \"they are a under Ruha\" (22 :200-201) ;XiXl~'7 xmn \"under foot\" (29:30). 7.7 7Y, and its graphical variant ?K, mean \"on, against, by\" as in the following examples: 1X7Y, \"which is on you\" (15:6); i1'7Y n~i1XW1 \"and I sent against him\" (22:213); 1X'7Y \"against us\" (22:48); pn~x7Y \"against them\" (7:7); ~x?K \"over me\" (22:171); cf. the variant, xnn X'm \"by Life\" (25:6). A compound expressi• occurs in Xj?iX, X9JX 7Y \"on the face of the earth\" (31:22). '7Y and 7X may take the place of '7, for example, as the sign of the direct object. (See N. p. 193; Ma. § 183; also pp. · 24, 105.)

Gesenius' on 77\" in his Hebrew and Chal-dee Lexicon. ) The following forms may be Pocel or dialectal variants: 11'<7Y~1, \"deprived us\" (6:12), cf. 11'<7Y~, (5 :13); n\"D1W \"I heard\" (18a:4), cf. n\"7JKW \"you listened\" (22:207); 1'<\"1\",11ll (19: 19) and ,,,,Ill (18c:l2) \"dissolve!\" cf. \"l'<\"\"lW (5:13). The verb 11'<J1ln\"7J \"quaking\" (22:43) seems to be an Ethpolpal with the drop-ping of a radical to form 1.1.2 from 1.2.1.2 (cf. 3.22). The verb 11'<7~Y \"scattered\" seems to be an Ethpaccal of the quadriliteral 1n~; a similar form from 71l~ but with the shift of the final 7 to l is 11'<1l~Y \"cast away.\" Both forms occur in the same passage (22:96, 98). 9.11 In the following list of examples for both the Strong and the Weak verbs, we shall be following the order of the paradigms given in the preceding chapter. A few observations may be recor-ded here concerning the Weak verbs. The initial l of the l\"~ 11?"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"verbs as&milates in the Pecal imperfect and infinitive; it is usually dropped in the imperative and assimilated in the A!el. On the other hand, there are some l\"~ verbs that act as Strong verbs, and some that have both assimilated and non-assimilated forms together. (See Ma. § 209.) The initial Y/K of the Y/K\"~ verbs assimilates in the Pecal imperfect and infinitive. in the A!el, and in the Reflexive stems. The initial ' of the ~~ verbs assimilates in the Pecal imperfect and infinitive; it falls away in the imperative; in the Afel the first syllable contains the characteristic diphthong 1K. The final radical of the Y\"Y is contracted with the iden-tical second radical except in the Pecal passive participle, the Paccel, and the Reflexive stems. The J~ verbs are identical in form with the ~ verbs in the Pecal perfect .and imperfect. (See Ma. § l96a.) The ~\"7 verbs end in K~-in the Pecal imperfect, except in the 2m.p. and 3m.p.; this is also the ending of many of the forms in the derived stems as may be seen from the paradigm (cf. 8.13). The final n of the ~ verbs is sometimes preserved by transposition (c!. 3.17). In the following citations ~oubly We~ verbs are listed in the category of the weakness that the parti-cular form best illustrates. 9.12 THE STRONG~ Pecal (For paradigm see 8.3.) A.

In the following summary, we shall sometimes refer to the previous discussions of these points and not repeat them. A. Nouns and Adjectives 10.2 There are two genders: masculine and feminine; two num-bers: singular and plural; and three states: absolute, construct, and emphatic. The inflectional endings again are as follows: Masculine Feminine Sing. Plural Sing. Pl!Jral Absolute P-X-1K-Construct K''-nK-nK-Emphatic X-x~-xn-Knl<-Abstract nouns generally appear with the feminine xn1-ending: XnDKT \"victory\" (22:2); Xn10X \"heal~h\" (6:1); \"dominion\" (22:136); and Kn1PJO~r.l \",poverty\" (20:21). The absolute state is used for predicate adjectives (cf. the following paragraph) and with certain constructions of nouns. The absolute state is used with n~es and other words used as proper nouns: ~~oxw \"the Sun\" (10:23); 7~J \"Bel\" or the planet Jupiter (22:130); 1JJ \"Nebo\" or the planet Mercury (22:252); l~,~J \"Nergal\" or the planet Mars (22 :248); PO \"Sin\" or the moon god, etc. The word 7~J~n·\"Tibil\" or the \"World\" also appears in the absolute state. 136"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Nouns used in distributive repetitions are found in the absolute state: 1KnN 1KnN~ \"here and there\" (23:11). The abso-lute state is used in adverbial expressions formed with preposi-tions: rJP~7 \"evilly\" (1?:16); CN7N7 \"for eternity\" (21:22); '110~ \"outside\" (16:18). Words with an indefinite meaning appear in the absolute state: t!l,JY \"a man\" (20:9); \"''l \"a man\" ([35 :5] ). Some loanwords have only the absolute form: e.g. ,N,N \"air\" from the Greek~ (22:61). For other examples of masculine singular absolute forms see 6.6. Masculine plural absolute forms of participles are quite common: l,O,N~ \"standing\" (22:10); 1,7,N \"entering\" (23:14); P~:lNJ \"departing\" (23:14); PIXJ \"fighting\" (9:3); and proco \"clapping\" (22:49). A nominal form is found in the phrase: CX7X po7N \"to the eternity of eternities\" (32:5?-58). Feminine absolute forms in the singular are rare: ~,1W \"tribe\" (22:145); xnxo \"village\" (22:106); X~1K \"earth\" (5:2); and KnY~ \"egg\" (2:6) are some examples. Feminine plural absolut forms occur most commonly among participles: lX:P~XO \"who pain\" (26:?); lXW\"l~XO \"who afflict\" (26:6); lX:lqDO \"who bewitch\" (9:4) and 11(0,7 \"who curse\" (19 :5). The construct forms are used in one of the three ways of expressing the genitival relationship. (See 6.8 above.) The other two ways whic·h use the particle 1 are more commonly found in our texts. Examples of masculine singular construct forms ar· K,07K cx7x7 \"to the eternity of eternities\" (1?:26); X,\"''1v n,~ \"the house of tombs\" (4:1-2); and the frequent \"'0 \"the son of\" i: proper names. Examples of masculine plural construct forms are rare, except in the common phrase: NU/?(JX X,J~ \"the sons of man\" 13?"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"(1?:9). Feminine singular construct forms are rare except for the common nx~ \"the daughter of.\" I have not noted any feminine plural construct forms in our texts. Emphatic forms are the most commonly found. (For a full list of examples see 6.9; 6.12; 6.15; and 6.1? above.) Examples of the masculine singular emphatic are: x::JX \"father\" (?:l?); xn~::J \"the house\" (10:5); X\"''l \"the man\" (5:15); X\"\"'''l \"the knot\" (22: 28). Examples of the masculine plural emphatic are: x~nx \"bro-thers\" (?:19); x~J::J \"sons\" (10:?); x~onxn \"seals\" (22:?). Exam-ples of the feminine singular emphatic are, in addition to the absolute nouns listed above, Xn10XT \"the singer\" (?:1?); xn~JXT \"the harlot\" (19:12); xn~7~7\"the lilith\" (21:2). Examples ofthe feminine plural emphatic are: XnN017 \"the curses\" (1:1); xnx~7~7 \"the liliths\" (4-:13); and xrno,,w \"the tribes\". (23:6). 10.3 The predicate adjective appears in the absolute state: iln~J TX,T01 P,T ,~oy \"bound, armed, and equipped is his house\" (23 :l); PJXT xnn \"Life is victorious!\" (10:28); XJ~,::>1 x::>~~y XJ11<017 pn71::> x~n,, \"repulsed, averted, and driven away are all the curses\" (1:1). The attributive adjective agrees with the noun that it modifies in gender, number, and state, and follows the noun that it modifies. A rare example of an attributive adjective in the absolute state is: tO~,Xi'1 91vXn •nvmvnoY \"powerful and infernal Estqutqup\" (5:8). The attributive adjectives that are found are generally in the emphatic state, as in the following examples: Xtll~::J x:l,n \"the evil destroyer\" (22:21); X~tOY::J ~xJXO \"my evil ene-mies\" (1:2-3); xnw~::J XPX \"the evil eye\" (2?:14-); XnxtO~::J l1nN::Jwno \"their evil designs\" (28:10). 138"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"10.4 A noun may be placed next to another noun in apposition. This is often true with a proper name, e.g. 11,XWY, 10,1., \"Yorba, the head of ••• \" (1:9). The placing of an appositional noun, es-pecially a proper noun, a1\"ter independent pronouns occurs quite frequently: K'>:JI<70 l1n:JI< \"you angels'' (26:23); 7,J'n I<JK \"I Hibil\" (22 :28); ~JK::l1, I(JK II I Yokabar\" (22 :14); 1(, ,n\"i X:'nJO nJK \"You Manda ~-Hiia\" (22:17-18). In the following example the same noun is repeated in the genitival relationship o! the modifying phrase: K,~,1 JX, 1(~,1 \"a knot--the greatest o! knots\" (22:210). Note also that this is also an expression of the superlative degree. (See Ma. §§ 246-48.) 10.5 The word 71::> may be used independently as follows: 71::> '7Y ~ C1j7\"i ''to everyone who stood\" (15 :16); J'IK~X\"i 71::> \"all that you said\" (11:25). As a construct before a singular noun it means \"each\" or \"every\": XnK71< 71:::> \"each god\" (15 :4). As a construct before plural nouns it means \"all\": 71:::> XJ'IK017 \"all the curses\" (9:13). With a suffixed 3rd person singular pronoun it means \"en-tire\" and stands in an appositional relationship before the noun: iln01j7 xn71::l11(his) entire body\" (22:44). With a suffixed 3rd person plural pronoun it means \"all\" and stands in an appositional relationship before the noun as in: I<,,DY nn71::> \"all the temple spirits\" (1:10). 10.6 The same noun may be repeated in a distributive repeti-tion: ~nx ~nl< \"here and there\" (literally, \"place place\") (31: 16). 139"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"10.7 In a series of nouns the governing preposition need not be repeated before each noun: Kn~1PDY1 K7J~n K11, Kn'J l~Txn7 \"to this house, dwelling, mansion, and threshold\" ([26:1-2]). B. Pronouns 10.8 For the pronouns in general see· chapter V. The lst and 2nd persons of the independent personal pronouns are used for em-phasis with verbs: pK~ x~nx·~ K7'JYn n•pJYW K7 KJK \"I have not let (them) loose but the Planets have\" (22:l37-3E); p~n1 nKJK \"you, remove!\" (l:ll). 10.9 A determined noun is often anticipated by a pronominal suffix in the following cases: a) Before a genitive: CK,K, ~JJ \"the sons of Adam\" (10: 13); K1,0J1,~, mK~PJ \"the building of Farrukusrao\" (20:2). b) With enclitic prepositions before corresponding pre-positional phrases: KlKnD KJ~,n,TO, \"who stand guard on the crowrf (ll:44); CK,K, K'JJJ 11~1cnn \"you sin against the sons of Adam\" (10:15); ,~rx•7 i1'71p::::lil7fl \"you free Yazid\" (?:15). c) In anticipation of the direct object of the verb as K7JK7 iln~~ OJ \"I seized the knife\" (22:146); K~1P l'TKn7 ~1J1n \"shatter this misfortune\" (22:18-19); 1K7~17 1K7JY \"I would de-vour you\" (22: l ?3). in: d) In anticipation, not of the direct object itself, but of the possessor of the direct object: ~XP1Pl ~n·x~7 K~1CK7 \"have cursed the house of·Quqay\" (26:21); lKnK07 lK7p•7o \"is come upon our village\" (22:46); K7n•nxo K01~ 7Y1 \"and against her mouth is smiting\" (33:20).

For interjections see ?.21. E.~ 10.15 The pronominal subject is not expressed with finite verbs except for emphasis (see 10.8). This is also true of the 3rd person of the participles when they are used as verbs. For the lst and 2nd persons of the participles, an enclitic form of the personal pronoun is suffixed (see 5.1). The 3rd person plural sometimes expresses an indefinite subject, which may best be rendered by a passive construction: K1riY\"'i ••• KOKll 1~ \"the command ••• which was brought\" (22 :263-64); KP Tl K7o:lPY K~ 112T.l7K \"he was clothed with a garment of brilliance.\" (22 :5?-8). 10.16 With a compound subject listed as a series the verb is singular: ••• l11TK~1 'KlTK pn~K7Y n'nJ \"there have gone down a-gainst them Azdai and Yazarun, etc.\" (?:6). 142"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"There is a great lack of congruence between the gender and number of the subject and the gender and number of the verb in our texts. Singular verbs are often used with plural subjects and masculine verbs are very often used with feminine subjects. As noted above (9.3, 5) there is no separate form for the 2f.s. of either the perfect or the imperfect. The 2f.p. of the perfect occurs twice: pn01'<7 (9:14), 1\"l\"'K7 (5:14) \"you cursed.\" The 2f. p. of the imperfect does not occur. In addition the 3f.p. of the perfect does not occur. The 3f.p. of the imperfect occurs once: i!Jl<\"~OYl \"they gaze at him\" (1?:16).
