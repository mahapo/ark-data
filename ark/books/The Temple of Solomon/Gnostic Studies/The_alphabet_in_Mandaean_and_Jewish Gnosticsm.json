[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Religion (1981) 11,227-234 THE ALPHABET IN MANDAEAN AND JEWISH GNOSTICISM Dan Cohn-Sherbok For some time scholars have recognized a connection between Judaism and the Mandaean religion, a In 1925 M. Lidzbarski located tile beginnings of Mandaeism in the Christian period in Syria-Palestine. According to him the ancestors of the present day Mandaeans were originally situated in the Trans- jordan and had their spiritual home in the heterodox circles of Judaism. 2 In 1940 S. Pederson argued that Mandaeism had at one time a positive relation to Jews and therefore contains numerous Jewish elements. 3 Following Brandt 4 G. Widengren in 1961 expressed the opinion that the earliest structure of Mandaeism is of Jewish origin, s Similarly in The Secret Adam, published in 1960, Lady Drower stressed the connections between Mandaeism and Judaism, drawing a few parallels between gnostic ideas in these religious traditions. 6 More recently K. Rudolph 7 and G. Scholem 8 argued along similar lines. Unfortunately, however, little work has been done on comparing Mandaeic texts with Jewish sources. 9 The purpose of this article is thus to contrast a central gnostic doctrine in Mandaeism--the role ofthe alphabet in creation-- with that found in the Sefer Yesirah, the earlies.t extant Hebrew mystical text of speculative thought. 1~ The fact that similar ideas are found in this early rabbinic text and in the secret scrolls ofan early date used at the ordination of Mandaean priests 11 adds weight to the view that Mandaeism and Judaism were originally intimately related. According to one of these secret Mandaean texts, the All Trisar Suialia, the Wellspring is described as the mother of the alphabet: 'And the great and lofty one (Adam Kasia) who is the soul who sitteth in the celestial firmament spoke and said, 'Praised be the great First Light, the Wellspring of Light, mother of the twenty-four letters of the alphabet. '~2 These letters are represented as instrumental in forming Adam Kasia--the cosmos in the shape of physical man--in the following way: 'The 'L' came into being--and up to the 'La' they were twelve. And from the halfway 'La' unto the end ofthe living (mysteries?) it was (also) twelve because they divided that Well in which there are four corners. Thus its counterpart which pertaineth to it, which is named 'L', is seen to be the middle halfofthe alphabet.

Cohn-Sherbok expressed themselves defectively but encouraged themselves saying, 'If we separate ourselves and place ourselves at a distance one from the other the building will not hold together. (But) if we approach one another and merge together we shall construct the building soundly and will set it out in orderly fashion .... When they had thus regarded themselves, they took hold of one another's hand', at those corners and set their course toward Him. And He turned about in His kingliness and caused them to approach Himself, gave His testimony and set them to work on the House'. 13 Adam Kasia is both macrocosm and microcosm; the cosmos was built in his form and man is constructed in the shape of the cosmos. In another ofthe Mandaean secret texts, the Alma Rigaia Rba, his creation is related as follows: 'And then He (the author of Being) stood at the brink of the Wellspring and the Palm Tree, looked in, and beheld that which was wondrous. Thus was formed Seed within the Wellspring, and thus He planned to create Adam, His First-born Son... seed was cast and fell into that Wellspring which is named the Womb. It was three hundred and sixty days within that ~,Vell. '14 When Adam was formed, 'Pure Ether came carrying a letter in his right hand. And he (Adam) took the letter with his right hand and smelt at it and sneezed.., then a voice came from above, and he sent Mahzian-the-Word, carrying a letter in his hand. And he (the Word) came towards him and gave the letter into his right hand .... And he (the Word) instructed him (Adam) about the alphabet. 'Is As macrocosm Adam Kasia seems to be represented diagramatically in the Alma RiYaia Rba: On the lower part of the trunk, facing the top of the scroll, is written: 'At the Beginning Water, mambuhia (founts) of Life. Above them (the waters), three Ykintas, Watchers that are sublime, blessed to the utmost degree. In the beginning I 16 came forth. I went thither; I remained and ruled over them, existing (mquaimia) from the Beginning to the End.

The following prayers are said in praise and obeisance to the various organs and limbs named: 'When thou has saidest 'Praised be the First life', thou praisest the four projections (zavia) which are in thy head .... And when thou recitest 'Ye are set up and raised', thou praisest its heart. And when thou sayest the longer 'Blessed and praised be Life' thou praisest and maketh obeisance to its Bowels, and when thou recitest 'Good is the good for the good', thou praiseth its Liver .... And when thou sayest 'Loosing sins'.... Thou makest bow and submission to tile Spleen ...."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"230 D.

And as thou eatest thy pihta thou subdueth thy gall from rage. And when thou drinkest thy mambuha \f9 thou hast soothed and purified its rage, for he is the Base of the Body ('stun) .... And when thou drinkest the halalta ... thou givest praise and impartest strength to the Bladder. And when thou takest the second rinsing and recitest 'Life is fulfilled' thou praisest and impartest strength to the partition which is between the faeces and the urine .... ,2o In Mandaean gnosticism then we can see that the letters ofthe alphabet are instrumental in forming Primal Man (Adam Kasia) with his various parts and organs, which is the physical model for mankind. In the Sefer Yesirah 21 there is a similar doctrine concerning the role of the alphabet in creation and the instrumental power of the letters in relation to the microcosm--the human form: According to the Sefer Yesirah the 'Foundation of all things' are the twenty-two letters: 'God has formed, weighed, transmuted, composed, and created with these twenty-two letters every living being, and every soul yet uncreated. '22 These letters are of three types: mothers; doubles; Singles. The mothers (~, ~, ~) represent the three types of Hebrew letters~mutes, sibilants, and aspirates, and the}, symbolize the three basic elements of all existing things. Water (the first letter of which is ~ in Hebrew) is symbolized by ~: lire (of which in Hebrew ~ is the most prominent sound) is symbolized by the sibilant \",~; air (the first letter ofwhich in Hebrew is ~) is symbolized by the aspirate ~.Just as the ~ holds the balance between the mute letters and the sibilants, so air is in the natural world intermediate to water which always tends in a downward direction and fire which always ascends. Thus 'three mothers' namely ~. ~. ~ . . . are Air, Water, and Fire: Mute as Water, Hissing as Fire, and Air of a spiritual type, is as the tongue of a balance standing erect between them pointing out the equilibrium which exists. '23 These three mothers represent in the microcosm, that is in the human form, 'the Head, the Belly, and the Chest--the head from the fire, the belly from water, and the chest from the air that lies between them. '24 The seven double letters (,~, \"], ~, ~, \"[, ,~, ~) typify the 'contraries' in the cosmos, the forces which serve two mutually opposed ends. These letters (which are double because they express two different sounds) were 'formed, designed, created and combined into the stars of the universe, the days of the week, the orifices ofperception in man.., two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and a mouth, through which he perceives by his senses. '2s According to some editions of the Sefer Yesirah each of the double letters is aligned with an individual orifice:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Alphabet in Mandaean and Jewish Gnosticism 231 (i) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) He caused and produced. ~. predominant in wisdom crowned, com- bined and formed, the Moon in tile Universe, the first day ofthe week, and the right eye ofman. ,~. predominant m health, crowned, combined and formed Mars in tile Universe, the second day ofthe week, and the right ear in man. \"[, predominant xn fertility, crowned, combined, and formed the Sun in the Universe, the third day ofthe week, and the right nostril in man. ~. predominant in life, crowned, combined, and formed Venus in the Universe, the fourth day ofthe week, and the left eye of man. ]~. predominant m power, crowned, combined and formed Mercury in the Universe, the fifth day ofthe week, and the left ear in man. ~, predominant m peace, crowned, combined, and formed Saturn in the Universe, the sixth day ofthe week, and the left nostril in man. ~. predominant in Beauty, crowned, combined, and formed Jupiter in the Universe, the seventh day in the week, and the mouth ofman. 26 The twelve simple letters ( ~. ~. ~. ~. ~, ~, , ~. ~. ~, T, \"3, ~) correspond to man's chief activities (sight, hearing, smell, speech, desire for food, the sexual appetite, movement, anger, mirth, thought, sleep and work)Y In addition these letters are emblematic of the twelve signs of the zodiac in the heavenly sphere, the twelve months, and the twelve chieflimbs of the body. According to some versions of the Sefer Yesi'rah each letter corresponds to particular parts and organs of the body: (1) ~--the right foot ofman (2) \"]--the right kidney ofman (3) ~--theleft footofman (4) ~--the right hand ofman (5) ~--the left kidney ofman (6) ~--the left hand ofman (7) Y--the gall in man (8) ,I--the intestines in man (9) [~--thestomachofman (10) ~--the liver in man (1 1) ~--the gullet in man (12) ~--the spleen in man. 2s The Sefer Yesirah thus parallels many of the notions found in Mandaean gnosticism. In both traditions the alphabet plays a fundamental role in creation, and despite the obscurity of many texts, it is evident that the letters are instrumental in forming man as a microcosm. The doctrine of Adam Kasia--as the universe constructed anthropomorphically--is absent from the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"232 D. Cohn-Sherbok Sefer Yesirah, 29 yet in this work the Hebrew letters are linked with the various parts and organs of man. These striking similarities suggest that the concept of the creative power of the alphabet stems from a common source, and there is no doubt that such a belief was deeply rooted in early rabbinic Judaism. The function of the letters in the construction of the world is found in numerous rabbinic texts. In an ancient fragment of Midrash Tanhuma, we read for example that 'the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: 'I request labourers'. The Torah told Him: 'I put at your disposal 22 labourers, namely the 22 letters which are in the Torah .... ,3o Again in the Talmud (Ber. 55a) it is stated that 'Bezaleel (tile architect of the Tabernacle in the desert) knew how to join together the letters by means ofwhich the heavens and earth were created.' No doubt the original Jewish elements in Mandaean cosmology were eventually overlaid with foreign notions, but the fact that Mandaean gnosticism echoes ideas found in the Sefer Yesirah strengthens the claim made by such scholars as K. Rudolph that 'even the earliest form of that which we today call Man- daeism was a splintering off from official Judaism ... a Jewish substratum with foreign elements, be they Iranian, late Babylonian, Syrian or Greek, is to be considered.., as the root ofMandaean N&6raenism'. 31 NOTES 1 I am indebted to Mr. Ian Gardner for the help he has given me with this article. 2 M.

This figure is from the scrolls accompanying A Pair of Nasorean Com- mentaries. 19 In early Ma'asheh Merkabah literature there are similar references to a primordial man of vast proportions. As Scholem writes in Kabbalah (New York: Quadrangle, 1974), p. 16, these passages 'enumerate the fantastic measurements ofparts ofthe head as well as some of the limbs. They also transmit 'the secret names' of these limbs, all of them unintelligible letter combinations. Different versions of the numbers and the letter combinations have survived and so they cannot be relied upon, and, all in all, their purpose (whether literal or symbolic) is not clear to us'.
