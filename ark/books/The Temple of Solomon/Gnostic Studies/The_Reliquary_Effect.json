Although stubbornly material, theydo not moulder and decay, but are able to act and operate in the world. Despitetheir broken and fragmented nature, they adeptly seize their audience’simagination and propel it on a trajectory that leads to distant destinations,from here and now to there and then.As obdurately material objects, how do they do it? Without doubt, the answer isthat the reliquary plays an essential role in this manoeuvre. Without thereliquary and ‘the reliquary effect’ to establish value, presentation andcontext, the relic could never succeed in capturing the attention required tolaunch a dynamic of meaning. But an even more essential question arises as wepursue this train of thought: what is a reliquary?It is surely no coincidence that many people believe they have never heard theword ‘reliquary’, while at the same moment remaining confident they are certainof the meaning of ‘relic’. Perhaps the simplest definition of a reliquary is acontainer intended to protect its relic contents. (And yet, as we will see, somereliquaries are not containers at all.) Rather than a depository or safe,however, a reliquary must be understood to be like a gift box, with all thetransient nature of such a thing. The reliquary performs a function ofpresentation, and then it is thoroughly and efficiently forgotten in theassertive presence of the relic. No one comes away from a church treasury sayingthey saw the reliquary of the True Cross. Devout and non-devout alike profess tohaving seen the relic of the True Cross.More questions arise. How does physical material become imbued with suchsignificance that it seems to shine forth from within its container? Or to beginat the ‘beginning’, how does an object become a relic? In the followingdiscussion not just the container but also the process will be characterized asthe ‘reliquary effect’. Through a framing action of physical context, legendsand rituals, relics are identified and defined as unique, authentic, powerfuland effective. Most importantly for our concerns, an object is most clearlyidentified as a relic when it is enclosed and presented in a reliquary (or othersimilarly definitive frame).For its part, the reliquary’s first manoeuvre is to make a simple assertion ofthe oldness of the relic through the most basic comparison with its own shiny‘newness’. This step implicates a ‘double condition’ of an old material thing:that is, it stands both for the present (presence) and the past.1[13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref1] In quick succession, presuppositions follow:that the provenance is unbroken, that the relic has been venerated since themoment the saint died (or a sacred event occurred) and ultimately, that therelic is precious. If the relic had to be discovered or found in some fashion,narratives of finding (inventio) are composed that connect the historical dotsand activate the roles of legend and ritual, launching the inestimable powers ofstory and performance.But how is the process initiated? How is a relic first identified; and what ifthe relic is false – inauthentic or even a fraud? Often there is little hardevidence of a relic’s authenticity. Stories about the moment of recognition areexceedingly rare except in instances where visions occur, and even then detailsare sparse.Perhaps we can find the answer in a contemporary example. In a fascinating studyof the manufacture of relics and reliquaries in modern-day France, theethnographer Francesca Sbardella reveals the mysterious process whereby bodilyremains are turned into sacral stuff, beautiful and authentic relics. Theprocess is undeniably purposeful, involving a dual strategy of activation andembellishment.2 [13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref2] Assuming the role of apostulant, and pursuing observation and interviews, Sbardella chronicled the(continuing) story of the remains of Françoise d’Amboise, a fifteenth-centuryfounder of the Carmelite order in France. Françoise’s body had always beenpreserved and honoured by the order. After her beatification in 1863 and atwentieth-century revival of her fame as founder and a model of devotion andprayer, however, the nuns were ready to convert the commemorated body intosomething at the next level of sacralization, powerful relic fragments thatcould be disseminated by the Carmelites and allow Françoise to serve as anactive intercessor, widely available for petition by prayer. As performed byselect nuns, the procedure of transformation involved a number of specificactions: a careful delimitation of symbolic space within which the changeoccurred, the implementation of tools used in ritually specified ways, theperformance of prayers and meditation, and the use of certain customary wordsand gestures (that is, the process was not fully liturgical but was controlledby formulaic practices).As the nuns testified to Sbardella, a transformation was effected through thisperformance. Incomplete objects – fragments of bone or small pieces of fabric –were turned into functioning relics by being labelled, decorated and, above all,enclosed (behind glass). The product was described by the sisters as ‘beautiful’and therefore authentic, but not, they insisted, a product of aesthetic concern.Enframement by means of container, religious materials and pious actions andprayers allowed the true beauty of the relic to emerge as a corollary to itsreligious power.Such relic-making is both like and unlike the use of bodily sheddings tomanufacture Buddhist relic-objects by a seventeenth-century Japanese nun. Bunchiincorporated the nail parings and hair of her father, a great and pious emperor,into calligraphy and images decorating a temple, thus both honouring him andaspiring to make him one with the Buddha, while ‘facilitat[ing] interactionbetween this world and the next’.3 [13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref3] Initiallyconceived as votive offerings, such religious practices came to be seen as a wayto actively unify the worshipper with the divine. Furthermore, in the case ofthe emperor and other venerable men, manufactured portraits take on saintedstatus. A related practice, writing Buddhist sutras with the devotee’s ownblood, joins body with devotion even more directly. One result of suchmanipulation of materials can be that a holy person is recognized as a ‘saint’.Persistent issues of great concern to this study may be identified in both thesescenarios. It has long been noted that relics do not have intrinsic worth butrequire ritual, story and social actors to find their place in religiousmeaning. As the French nuns insisted, the beauty of the relics is linked totheir authenticity, and is also created socially rather than being essential tothe nature of the object. Of great concern to our purposes here is that much ofthis work is done by actions of selection, collection and enshrinement – what wemight, by putting the emphasis on action rather than object, call relic-ing,4[13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref4] the making of relics.As apparent in the examples of the Carmelites and the Buddhist nun, reliquariesand art play a key role in such operations. Additionally, as the Carmelitesassert and as is often undeniably true, reliquaries are beautiful (and meant tobe so) but they also rarely follow aesthetic norms. Vision is an issue becausemany times, as in the case of the Buddhist holy man, the bits of body are notvisible or easily discerned in the larger whole. These questions of beauty andvisibility remain open ones. We thus begin with a query about the nature ofvisibility of relics and we will return to this issue again and again in thefollowing discussion.images [images/f0010-01.png]1 Colars de Douai and Jacques de Nivelles (goldsmiths), Jacques d’Anchin(cleric, designer), reliquary of St Gertrude, 1272–98, silver, 180 × 80 × 54 cm,Collegiate Church of St Gertrude, Nivelles, Belgium (no longer extant).THE ROLE OF THE RELIQUARYSo, to repeat and amplify: precisely as a precious medieval reliquary ismateriality glorified, sparkling silver, beautiful with precious metal and gems,it simultaneously erases its own existence, standing only as a setting orcontext for the staging of the relic (frontispiece; illus. 1[05_Introduction.xhtml#fig1]). Without the script supplied by labels andinscriptions, without the set design and lighting of brilliant substances,without the supporting cast of other relics and sacred things in a surroundingtreasury and the ritual actions of the devout, the relic remains mute – a silentand speechless thing, not even an object responding to a subject in dialogue.The reliquary makes the relic. In so doing, it has a wide, important and diverseset of duties.When performing optimally, indeed, the reliquary is almost miraculous inallowing the relic to initiate response:[It] allows a glimpse through immeasurable time and space . . . the witnessingof that place where past and future, flesh and spirit, are one. Interiors withininteriors within interiors fracture any simple interior/exterior opposition . .. in a relation in which the smaller object, the relic . . . elides, andencompasses its multiple containers . . . in relations that not only hold andprotect, hide and reveal, but displace one substance with another . . . therelics are never housed and never contained; instead they are always excessive,overflowing, spilling out.5 [13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref5]With this exuberant, indeed spilling out of words to match miraculous effects,Helen Hills tries to capture the aesthetic and spiritual impact of the Baroquechapel of San Gennaro in Naples (see illus. 69 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig69], andChapter Four [09_Chapter04.xhtml]). She also precisely and eloquently evokes aseries of the tasks that any reliquary must perform. Let us examine how thesetasks arise and how one ineluctably leads to the next.First, the reliquary encloses. By doing so, it makes a first move ofestablishing the place of the sacred in space. As a frame, such enclosure mightbe as subtle as the Jewish ritual eruv (or the spaces similarly defined throughdelimiting string by Fred Sandback on display at Dia:Beacon), or it might be asassertive and impenetrable as a strong locked box. In any case, the frame notonly puts forward the value of the interior space, the contents, but alsosimultanously puts the relic into a larger context. Through contrast with itsenclosure, the relic is set into an expanded environment, perhaps a series ofsuccessively defined spaces, perhaps even incommensurable space.The ‘space’ of the relic is redefined as numinous, perhaps the space ofsalvation, thus situating the relic’s importance in a larger and much morecomplex field than would be implied by its, usually, fragmentary nature. Thereliquary, while framing the relic and thus creating an interior, also joinstogether the relic and reliquary, simultaneously destroying any clear sense ofinterior and exterior and fusing the contained and the containing.One of the essential qualities of the relic, however, is its power to trespassboundaries and containment (it is intrinsically linked to the unboundedheavens). This ability of the relic to ‘escape’ its confines through its powercreates a paradox, and one common reaction to this quality of the relic as‘escape artist’ is a multiple-containment strategy – a sort of funhouse sequenceof iterations of enclosure, a veritable, physical mise en abyme of containment.Nevertheless, despite the multiplication of frames that attempts to fix therelic in place – in examples from early Christian churches (see illus. 24[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig24]) to Buddhist temples (see illus. 21[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig21], 22 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig22]) to Neapolitan Baroquechapels – the final result demonstrates that the power of the relic is neverhoused, never contained and always excessive. The relic works, as many havenoted, through a sort of contagion that cannot be quarantined by physicalconfines, but which wonderfully – that is, miraculously – spreads its divinequalities through touch, through sight and even through air.The reliquary seeks to control such contagion by initiating a teasing game ofhide-and-seek. Many reliquaries do not allow visual access to their relics anddevotees were rarely allowed to touch. Some manage an exchange in which thepower of the relic is transferred to another substance or even from brutematerial to the descriptive and narrative power of the image. As has been arguedin regard to African sacral remains (see illus. 96 [12_Conclusion.xhtml#fig96]),if the secret is to be effective, it has to be known that there is a secret, andthe constitution of the secret is far more important than the secret itself. Itsproduction, but also its obscurity, allows levels of access, as well ashierarchies of competency in interpretation that regulate the power of thesacred.6 [13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref6]Different scenarios abound, and in some sense this book – it will be more orless chronological – will be about the history of reliquaries and howpossibilities play out. Nevertheless, it will not, and cannot, be a simple storythat traces an arc of development. Above all, reliquary-making is not ateleological development, as some have argued, that progresses from the hiddento the visible relic. Even though a trajectory from the earliest medievalobjects to modern Plexiglas containers can be described, it must be admittedthat clear sight is almost never the goal.A more accurate metaphor for relic presentation might, indeed, be thestriptease. Giorgio Agamben insists that it is the process of disrobing that isthe point of that exercise:Strip-tease, that is to say, the impossibility of nakedness, is . . . theparadigm for our relationship with nudity. As an event that never reaches itscompleted form, as a form that does not allow itself to be entirely seized as itoccurs, nudity is, literally, infinite: it never stops occurring.7[13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref7]This fleeting notion of unending process captures something of the operation ofrelics in their function of allowing access to the divine. Unending process alsosuggests the role of reliquaries vis-à-vis relic secrets. Reliquaries bothreveal but also always hide the nature, the secrets, the power of what theycontain.So in some sense, the reliquary is better defined as a space containing theineffable; a never defined but defining container, a shapeless but also shapelyframe; a comely deformity, a deformed comeliness (pace Bernard of Clairvaux). Ifthe reliquary is the intersection of the abject and the beautiful, the preciousand the valueless, these values also continually change place – because, as somany Fathers of the Church inform us, the dust contained within the reliquary ismore valuable than any gem.To take the comparison of sexual and divine desire just a bit further,8[13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref8] we might compare the ‘history’ of relic-makingand the manufacture of reliquaries to the history of erotica. As above, thereliquary finds its purpose in stimulating attention and capturing desire. Itoften does so with the most current and coveted of artistic innovations. Just aspornography has been said to drive technical innovation – financing advances inthe wake of demand – reliquaries can be said to have generated and supported newartistic techniques and materials: enamel, such a beautiful technique with whichto depict blood, became popular in the age of blood relics (here used forChrist’s cloak, illus. 2 [05_Introduction.xhtml#fig2]); new sources of veryclear rock crystal were discovered in Africa when the French court’s urge todisplay specific relics became a primary motivation (see illus. 43[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig43]); reverse painted gold glass becomes ubiquitous whenItalian Renaissance artists inserted tiny relics behind glass into icon-likepresentations, a technique especially recommended for reliquaries by the artistCennino Cennini;9 [13_References.xhtml#rintro1ref9] sheets of plate glass andmirrors of unprecedented size were manufactured when churches wanted to exhibitwhole bodies on or under altars (illus. 3 [05_Introduction.xhtml#fig3]); andfinally, contrary to the usual glitter and brightness of reliquaries, the use ofebony became all the rage as it emerged as one of the most precious of importedcommodities from new colonial outposts (see illus. 90[11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig90]). One might even compare all this to another infamousand more properly modern process that manufactures desire – setting a product inplace through advertising.

Within thelimited pages of this book we will sketch only a quick picture: an overview ofthe continually changing appearance of reliquaries, but also an appreciation ofthe wondrous creativity of the artists involved, and their ability to producestartling revelations of these powerful substances. In the following pages,although our primary focus will be on Christian relics, objects and rituals fromother traditions and venues – Buddhism, Islam, tribal Africa and contemporaryart – will serve to expand our frame of reference."},{"pageContent":"1RELICS AND RELIQUARIES: MATTER, MEANING, MULTIPLICATIONWE BEGIN THIS CHAPTER with a consideration of the seemingly unpromisingmaterials of which relics are made, proceed to a discussion of the form andfunction of reliquaries and conclude with an investigation into the ur-reliquaryof the Judaeo-Christian tradition, the Ark of the Covenant. Along the way wewill discuss the question of how relics multiply, and highlight one of theirforemost attributes – their reputed persistence. Above all we will be concernedwith an exploration of the possibilities of sacred matter.But first we must pause to further explore the meaning of ‘relic’ – surely thecore concept at the heart of our endeavour, but also a consistently problematicone. We think we know what the word relic means; most of us think of bodies orbones. This conception is, however, not sufficient to describe the substance ofvenerated relics in any era (and far from comprehensive when considering secularrelic objects). For example, Buddhist relics often claim to be a body part suchas a bone, but when examined might reveal themselves to be man-made jadesimulacra of such bones. (To complicate matters, certain jewels are alsoconsidered to be relics of the Buddha.) Some of the most renowned Islamic relicsare a footprint or a sandal. The earliest Christian relics were often cloth,pebbles or even dust (see illus. 4 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig4]). Evidence fromtreasuries as well as from comments in early texts confirm this variety of relicmaterial, and two of the most prominent commentators on relics of the ChristianMiddle Ages, Paulinus of Nola (c. 420) and Thiofridus of Echternach (c. 1100),consistently refer to relics as dust.1 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref1]All relics, it should be noted, share a quality in that they are indexical –that is, in Charles Sanders Peirce’s semiotic definition, they arerepresentative of a sacred person or place in terms of being a product of (asblood indicates a body), adjacent to (as touching or having touched) or actuallybeing a portion of (a fragment or splinter) the holy thing.2[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref2] In these associations, as index, the relic istestimony or ‘indicative’ because it shares an authentic physical relationshipwith the holy thing.THE MATERIAL SACREDWe might, then, begin our query into relic materials, substances and things byasking, why dust? What is it? The answer to the latter question might seemobvious – dust is fine powder or earth, very similar in origin and as outcome toashes (a common relic material – Buddha was cremated and early Christian martyrswere often burned to death). If we, however, examine the meaning of the word‘dust’, we find it operates through a process of exclusion rather than throughpositive identity. Dust is a secondary product of dirt. Dust is what weunhappily discover in corners. Dust is the opposite of the valuable, whole andactive; it is the extraneous, the inert, the unwanted, the other. How does dustbecome the powerful and valuable relic? Why disparage precious objects with sucha demeaning term? The answer is both simple and complex.‘Dirt constitutes a border between being and not-being’ and as ‘the materialdissolution of matter that becomes the dust of mortification and physical decay. . . [it] is cast aside through purification rituals, in order that the bodymight live.’3 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref3] As the very essence of thenon-living, the no-longer-living or the yet-to-live, dust as a category featureslarge in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, especially the biblical Old Testament,which contains 102 occurrences in the King James translation, including theoft-cited, ‘And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground’ (Genesis2:7); ‘For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return’ (3:19); and ‘[I] ambut dust and ashes’ (18:27). The body is disparaged as dust, humiliated as dustand will return to this most base state at death. However, dust is alsogenerative: God used dust to make man, and further: ‘And thy seed shall be asthe dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to theeast, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall allthe families of the earth be blessed’ (Genesis 28:14). Finally, dust hasparadoxical potential: ‘Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?’(Psalm 30:9).Dust as relic in the Christian era finds its place above all as a base materialthat is collected and honoured and then disseminated. The immolated remains ofSt Polycarp were gathered by his followers and declared more precious than gems.In this first identifiable act of Christian relic-ing, the faithful recognizedashes as valuable and equivalent in meaning to a holy human being, despite theirunpromising form.Intrinsic to this act of collection and identification (or transformation) ofdust into relic is the corollary act of framing. As already mentioned in theintroduction, reliquaries offer a relic more than mere spatial delimitation andenframement. A reliquary’s enshrinement constitutes a temporal act, andimplicates an array of practices such as ritual, storytelling and collecting. Areliquary’s nature is above all intrinsically paradoxical; its function isemphatically contrary to its core message that no act of relicing ever tookplace. Through a reliquary’s construction and its display of precious materials,it asserts that the relic is by nature valuable, eternal and has existed from adesignated and pregnant historical moment worthy of remembrance – the death of asaint, the Crucifixion of Christ, the moment of a touch – and will be preservedforever without change. The reliquary therefore constitutes as its very missionthe support of memory (which also, without doubt, implies a value that precedesits existence). In that it insists on truth and authenticity, it cannot allowmaking or time, least of all history. But here again, contrary to sense, therelic does not exist without the reliquary in that the presentation serves tofix the relic’s authenticity and meaning and prove its persistence.Perhaps even more importantly, as part and parcel of these assertions ofimportance and permanence, the reliquary has the essential job of teaching thedevotee the significance of the relic. Defining the means of approach, itconstructs an environment and instructs the viewer in terms of use and decorum.Finally, in a last and once again paradoxical move, it deflects attention fromitself, promising truth and spiritual interiority at its secret and ineffablecentre. It must therefore be emphasized that enframement does not stage therelic subsequent to its importance, but is coterminous with its moment ofrecognition. Of fundamental and ontological importance,4[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref4] the reliquary and its ritual or story define therelic as valuable and worthy of preservation and honour, and occursimultaneously with its identification. Acts of selection and enframement makethe relic rather than the reverse, especially in the case of dust in its qualityas amorphous and undefined or transitional. And then they do their best todisappear.The nature of the relic-reliquary relationship did not go unremarked in theChristian Middle Ages. Just about 1100, in his Flores epytaphii sanctorum (theonly medieval treatise dedicated solely to relics and reliquaries), Thiofrid,Abbot of Echternach, insists that relic and reliquary are truly a single unitand that without the compensatory beauty of the reliquary, a relic could berepulsive (and thus ineffective).5 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref5] He furtherargues that, although by necessity of earthen materials, reliquaries ofsufficient beauty to honour a saint should be made of the finest materials,aureus atque gemmis (gold and gems).6 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref6]Elaborating on the comment on value made in the life of Polycarp, Thiofridinsists that repulsive and intrinsically valuable contents must be joined to andenclosed by beautiful but earthen and intrinsically valueless stuff, in asymbiotic union.By calling attention to the earthen origin of even the most seemingly valuablematerials, Thiofrid intends to deepen our understanding of reliquaries, theirworth and their link to their contents through a reference to 2 Corinthians 4:7:‘But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the powermay be of God, and not of us.’ This text seems to discuss terracotta, butmetaphorically refers to the human body and its nature as a container for thedivine, and of course also thus implicates Christ’s human body. Furthermore,although emphasizing the material nature of both relics and reliquaries,Thiofrid, in something like sleight of hand, reveals the reliquary to be anindex of the divine, setting the stage for a clear value and meaning forreliquaries themselves in their place in the created universe – made ofmaterials derived from God’s earth. Thus, we insistently circle back to matter,to the material and questions of its intrinsic meaning.Through its participation in what we might call a ‘reliquary strategy’, dust isrevelatory of the paradoxical nature of sacred substances and their need forreliquaries. A similarly unexpected relic material that, unlike dust, actuallyat times resists ‘gathering’, circumscribing and enclosure, reveals instead howrelics and reliquaries function as indices of ‘sacred space’.What material could be more indicative of God’s earth than stone? Although somereliquaries are fashioned of stone, especially those in the form of tombs, it isstriking that a common form of early relic was stone itself: the pebble, or, inother words, small mineral fragments. Although the diminutive pebble isseemingly insignificant and worthless, its outsize value lies in its indexicalreference to the earth – to rocks of larger size and even to immovable bedrock(which, as we shall see, sometimes also might move).7[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref7]Stone relics may present a more impenetrable and troubling aspect than dust, andare ultimately and particularly resistant to assigned meaning. Nevertheless, asone of the most essential of materials, stone is instrumental in turning ustowards spatial concerns: ‘When space is not overseen by the geometer, it isliable to take on the physical qualities and properties of the earth.’8[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref8] In speaking of the invisibility of space and itstendency to delude the viewer/inhabitant into believing it is transparent,natural and pre-existent, the famed theoretician of space Henri Lefebvrecounters such an intuition with the corollary perception of space asconfrontational in the form of the earth. Stones can be presented inreliquaries, or rock-as-relic may appear in more spatially complexconfigurations, including displays in the open air, but in any case, thepotential for the dense materiality of stone to be perceived as a condensationof the significance and essence of place is near universal to human culture.As with dust, stone is mentioned frequently in the Bible, from Jacob’s pillow topillars and altars or, metaphorically, in Deuteronomy 32:4, which states, ‘He isthe Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgement: a God of truthand without iniquity, just and right is he.’ Rocks are an unmovable foundation(or person – Peter), have clefts and caves at their depths, or represent theultimate heights. They have blood spilled upon them and give up water and oil inboth the Old and New Testament: ‘And did all drink the same spiritual drink: forthey drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ’(1 Corinthians 10:4). They are precious stones, foundation stones, cornerstonesand bedrock:9 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref9]As you come to him, the living Stone – rejected by humans but chosen by God andprecious to him – you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritualhouse to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to Godthrough Jesus Christ. (1 Peter 2:4–5)‘In many countries stone is the symbol of indestructibility, invulnerability,stability, light, and immortality.’10 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref10] TheGerman word Eckstein is both cornerstone and diamond; such stones can be pillarsthat are grounded but also rise to the heavens, objects of immeasurable value –the cornerstone of the Gospels might even be the apex of a pyramid rather than astone located at the foundation.Perhaps it is, therefore, not surprising that rocks and stones are so oftentreated as relics or numinous matter. The mysterious, perhaps meteoric blackrock of the Ka’aba in Mecca is a prominent example. Stones and pebbles are usedin burial ritual by Jews, in pilgrimage by Muslims and in burial and shrinecairns by Native Americans, which have also served syncretistically for NorthAmerican Christians when they are topped with crosses. In the Buddhist traditionin China, mountainous rock formations are marked (enshrined) with monumentalinscriptions.images [images/f0024-01.png]4 Pilgrim’s box from the Sancta Sanctorum, Rome, 6th century, Palestine(?),painted wood, stones, wood fragments and plaster, 24 × 18.4 × 3 cm, lid 1 cmthick, Museo Sacro, Vatican.Christian Holy Land relics are often stones that represent or point to theirlocus of origin. The famous sixth-century wooden box from the Sancta Sanctorum,now in the Vatican, preserves a selection of pebbles, labelled and inserted intoa narrative dynamic through the use of a set of loca sancta, or Holy Land imagesof the life of Christ, on the inner lid (illus. 4 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig4]).The pilgrim could relive his or her itinerary by recalling the sites, perhapstouching the stones that had been collected while doing so. Some sacred sites –Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome, the Italian city of Sansepolcro, the CampoSanto in Pisa, or lesser-known shrines such as Kutná Hora near Prague (seeillus. 76 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig76]) – gained their renown via quantities ofearth imported to ‘recreate’ the Holy Land and, in the latter two cases, createhallowed places for burial.11 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref11] Other stones,stained with blood – an example in Halberstadt Cathedral purportedly used tokill the martyr Stephen, or another once displayed by Italian Fascists – couldtestify to the violence of martyrdom.12 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref12]But one extraordinary form of stony relic does not descend from outer space, isnot thrown or used in building, is not marked with other substances and is notcarried away – but instead remains firmly attached to the earth. In ademonstration of the sacred established through the miraculous change in thenature of stone, footprint relics testify to past presence through the evidenceof impression. On the Mount of Olives, in the Chapel of the Ascension, the stoneat the centre of the martyrium-like building is said to show the marks ofChrist’s feet; the footprint(s) speak simultaneously to both divine presence andto absence (illus. 5 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig5]), that is, both to Christ’shistorical place on earth and his soteriological action of Ascension. As withthe cornerstone, this relic connects heaven and earth, but in this case theconnection is made as much through divine action as through material substance.Similarly, at the centre of the fifth-century octagonal Church of the Kathisma(Gr. seat or place of rest), located on the road from Jerusalem to Bethlehem,there is again an impression in the stone. It was said to be the stone uponwhich the pregnant Mary rested on her journey to Bethlehem, and so one seesevidence of her presence, her weight (gravitas), her supernatural burden incarrying the child in her womb. A spring is reported to have emerged from therock and there is a story of a miracle in which the stone resisted an attempt tocut it to make an altar to be sent to Constantinople (illus. 6[06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig6]).13 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref13]images [images/f0026-01.png]5 Crusader Chapel of the Ascension, detail showing footprint of Christ, 12thcentury building with earlier foundations and later additions, Mount of Olives,Jerusalem.Examples of rocks that have been impressed are common in many religions: thebedrock at the centre of the Dome of the Rock shows the footprints of Muhammadas he departed for the Night Journey; Buddha’s footprints document his earthlypresence and are revered as cult objects whether natural, as at Adam’s Peak inSri Lanka, or man-made copies (illus. 7 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig7]), and variousfootprints survive of the devil, angels and saints, as well as the imprint ofPatrick’s head on a stone pillow.14 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref14] Stone inthese instances has changed its nature, at some point becoming fluid or soft inorder to receive an impress. As if two spatial regimes – the heavenly and theearthly – intersected, one perceives that the divine is able to change themundane in an instant that is captured for ever. The mark is both eternal andthe evidence of a moment of great import.images [images/f0027-01.png]6 Church of the Kathisma, 5th century (part-excavated 1992), Hebron Road, southof Jerusalem.images [images/f0027-02.png]7 Buddhapada or Footprints of the Buddha, 2nd century, Gandhara (Peshwar),Kushan period (c. late 1st–early 4th century CE), grey schist, 127 × 80.1 cm,136.1 kg, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT.In the Buddhist examples, such traces are a boon to the devout, allowing thedevotee in humility to place his or her head at or under the feet of the reveredBuddha. The presence of the dharmachakra wheel in the centre of manufacturedfootprints along with other religious symbols and markings shows thecultural/cultual creation of such a relic. Other footprints in the ancient worldwere unabashedly manufactured as instruments to be used in rituals associatedwith endeavours as diverse as travel and coronation, by cultures ranging fromthe Celts to the Romans. Some were intended to allow social actors to matchtheir bodies against the declivities, that is, insert their own feet in thefootprints. (And, one assumes, put their own heads on the pillow.)Significantly, the Church of the Ascension in Jerusalem, as above, with itsfootprint of Christ, was originally open to the sky, supplied with a roof onlyonce it was rebuilt by the Crusaders (illus. 8 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig8]). Thepotential connection, originally framed by a set of circular architecturalsurrounds, was a direct one between heaven and earth. The pilgrim’s interactionwith the footprints is not one of mediation through a formal reliquary, but themarks, insofar as one can see them, are framed. Today, in addition to a squarestone frame, a nearby sandbox of sorts can be used to interact with themiraculous stone – one can fix candles in the sandy surface and one can fill thedeclivity of the footstep with sand and then carry it away as a holy souvenir(see illus. 5 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig5]). (One might compare these possibilitiesto the use of rose water to fill the footprint of Muhammad at Mecca.15[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref15]) At one time there was an altar stone above thespot and mass was said.16 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref16] Although the rock ishard and holy, it still interacts with the pilgrim through ritual and prayer.The Crusaders in particular, in accepting the cross of their vow, swore, ‘Wewill worship in the place where his feet stood’ (Psalm 131.7), pledging to makethe journey to the holy space.17 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref17]images [images/f0029-01.png]8 Crusader Chapel of the Ascension, 12th-century building with earlierfoundations and later additions, Mount of Olives, Jerusalem.Halfway around the Christian world, another set of footprints has been carefullypreserved as a relic, and the Risen Christ by Michelangelo in the church ofSanta Maria sopra Minerva in Rome (illus. 9 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig9]) may be anartistic rejoinder to the cult of those prints. The statue represents the figureof Christ carrying the Passion instruments, as he appeared to Peter just as theApostle, fearful of Nero’s persecutions of Christians, was leaving Rome. WhenPeter queried ‘Quo Vadis?’, ‘Where are you going?’, Christ replied that he wascoming to Rome to be martyred again. Peter understood the answer to be a rebuke,did not flee, and in consequence Christ ascended once again, leaving footprints,said to be those now preserved in the Quo Vadis church.The miracle both locates the miraculous presence of Christ in Rome and clarifiesthat Apostolic martyrdom repeats that of Christ. The sculpture by Michelangelo,responding to these ideas, emerges from deep shadow towards the viewer. Theleading foot pushes down on the earthen support as if in the act of making theimpression – the footprint that becomes the relic. This marble foot, however,also concretizes Christ’s presence in the space of Rome and in a sense isoffered to pilgrims. As can be seen in old photographs, it had to be coveredwith a metal cap to protect it from kisses. Observers have long remarked on thesculpture’s reference to ‘classical’ nudes as an assertion of its antiquity, andto the ‘true portrait’ of Christ in its distinctive profile – two more elementsthat respond to issues of presence and authenticity, making the sculpture itselfrelic-like.18 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref18]With this example, we have moved from one extreme of our story to another, fromthe prehistoric and early Christian veneration of rock shrines to a Renaissanceattempt to create an image of the body implied by a print in a rock, an image ofa living, breathing figure that animates not the stone but the story. As anatural feature of the landscape, hard, resistant stone is an element that isindistinguishable from its surroundings, without social marks, boundaries orceremonies that delineate it. Once cult operations are in place,earth/rock/stone is used to define space, is literally a landmark, andultimately emerges as a relic or sacred space insofar as it miraculously andeffectively expresses its own nature.images [images/f0031-01.png]9 Michelangelo, Risen Christ, 1519–21, marble, h. 205 cm, Santa Maria sopraMinerva, Rome.Although it may or may not be a universal human urge, clearly the need to usephysical materials that have a deep and significant potential to carry meaningis shared by many cultures. Relics are only one expression of this story, but acompelling one. We have begun with dust and rock, both unpromising but importantmaterials that find their place in the processes of relic-ing. Dust is thatwhich is unwanted and becomes valuable through enclosure; rock is stubbornlyintractable, a mute but powerful witness to place. If a generalization can bemade about relics, it is that they represent the paradoxical and the persistent.The paradoxical turns meaning on its head: the useless is valuable, the fixed isfluid, or, also, vice versa.Persistence, above all, proves that the paradox is not an evanescent phenomenon.If the idea that matter is changeable by its very nature was an unshakeableprinciple in medieval thought, then relics established their miraculous natureand their value through their ability to endure. Hosts that do not crumble andthat hold the marks of visionary blood are compelling testimony to the meaningof the Eucharist.19 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref19] Ideas of permanence,however, can be dramatically demonstrated in other sorts of relics andreliquaries. Persistence through time can be paradoxically captured in thepreservation of flesh – a material that is perhaps the ultimate symbol of thepotential for decay. Alternatively, Tibetan stones that materalize asapparitions, from thin air, carry the same message.In Tibetan Buddhism, a persecuted religion that first emerged in the seventh andeighth centuries and has found a resurgence in the twentieth and twenty-first, atreasure tradition of relics that are revealed to worthy and reincarnateddisciples helps to bind religious ideas across time. Objects from the earlierera, tertons, said to have been strategically left behind or actually buried,emerge in the present era to teach principles of Buddhism. They take the form oftexts, statues of the Buddha and ritual implements.20[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref20] The most remarkable aspect of this tradition isthat some of the reliquaries that contain these supposedly ancient objects arenot containers at all. They are simple spherical or ovoid stones of greatnatural beauty that, at times, drop from the sky (still warm like meteorites),or emerge from walls into the hands of the designated disciples (illus. 10[06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig10]). How they offer up their contents has never beenrevealed, but their status as mystical objects that are also timeless, naturaland valuable seems incontrovertible. Thus, they establish a frame of valueagainst which the status and value of the emergent relics is asserted. They alsoreverse the conventional order of relics and reliquaries – the relics areman-made objects of cult, the reliquaries natural, attesting to the persistenceof relics against all odds, as well as the value of reliquaries.In striking contrast, the most telling instance of persistence of relics inChristianity does not of course consist of materials of ‘natural persistence’but instead is realized in the bodies of the saints themselves, miraculouslyincorrupt. In the early Middle Ages, as in the example of St Cuthbert ofNorthumbria, such incorruption was thought to be evidence of virginity. On theoccasion of two different exhumations at intervals of four hundred years, it wasremarked that the saint’s joints were still flexible, in the first instance tothe pleasure of church officials, in the second instance to the dismay of thecommissioners of Henry VIII.21 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref21]Such flexibility, along with natural colour and freshness, are the gold standardof incorruption versus artificial mummification (as in the De cadaverumincorruptione of Benedict XIV, 1743), although other things are sure signs aswell, such as the presence of the heavenly odour of sanctity as opposed to thesmell of decomposition, emissions of oil or blood, or the presence of glowingrays of light. The Church is ill-disposed today to take such incorruption asmiraculous but, historically, it was often a deciding factor in declaring a holyperson a saint.Even more convincing than simple incorruption, however, are stories that tell ofincorruption against any logic of situation or matter. Francis Xavier remainedincorrupt even though he was packed in lime that was intended to aid in thedecomposition of his flesh. In life, Rita of Cascia was miraculously marked witha thorn fallen from a crucifix, receiving a wound that smelled rotten during herlife. Yet in death, her body remained wondrously sweet and incorrupt. When Zitaof Lucca, a virgin, was exhumed in 1580, three centuries after her burial, andfound incorrupt, her body was displayed in the Basilica of San Frediano (illus.11 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig11]). In a more metaphorical example, Paulinus of Nolatells of an occasion at the tomb of Felix, when ‘a heap of dust . . . burst outfrom below [an altar with relic repository]’.22 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref22]This miracle of lively dust was an occasion for joy, for as Paulinus clarifies,‘those bones of the saint’s body are not choked with the dust of death, butendowed with the hidden seed of eternal life’.23[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref23] In post-medieval European examples,incorruptible bodies are most often enclosed in glass coffins in order toclearly display the miracle; in these instances the reliquary really does seemto disappear.images [images/f0034-01.png]10 Tibetan tertön ‘reliquary’, 20th century, rock crystal.images [images/f0034-02.png]11 Incorrupt body of St Zita, mixed media, Basilica of San Frediano, Lucca,Italy.RELIQUARIES AND VIEWERS, RHETORIC AND RECEPTIONIn the absence of a relic of clearly miraculous material – malleable rock,lively dust, incorruptible flesh – reliquaries of precious materials arenecessary in order to represent the power of a saint. An impressive reliquary orshrine was assembled or reassembled using the best available resources: perhapsdonated materials and spolia (reused artworks or gems); certainly prayers andartisanal skill. Although we will encounter wood, ceramic, ivory and glass, thepreferred materials for the making of reliquaries have always been silver, goldand as many precious gems as possible (illus. 12 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig12]).Indeed the reliquary is by preference ‘over the top’ and excessive. In itssumptuous materials, its evocation of stories, its shining beauty and itsindexical power, the reliquary courts an awestruck response from its viewers –making a rhetorical argument, materially asserted, for the significance andpower of the relic. As the fourth-century bishop of Nola, Paulinus, wrote of hisshrine to St Felix:images [images/f0036-01.png]12 Nicholas of Verdun, Shrine of the Three Kings (detail; see frontispiece),completed 1225, gold, silver, enamel, gems, antique cameos and gems, woodencore, 110 × 153 × 220 cm, Cologne Cathedral, Germany.A new look gleams on the outside of the walls while the antiquity is hidden,enclosed within . . . [The buildings of the shrine] are simultaneously old andnew . . . as they depict the shape of future and present blessings . . . So itwill be on the day when men are permitted to rise again with life renewed.Amongst those who rise, precedence will be given to the group whose flesh iscovered with a shining garment.24 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref24]A fittingly constructed reliquary and/or shrine produces a ‘shining garment’worthy of the saint, and carries blessings from the past through the present tothe future in the hope of resurrection – a reification of the intercessorypromise of the saint, knitting time together in material.Reliquaries evidence aspirations of very complex goals in their work ofpresenting relics. Although some believers assert that incorrupt bodies allowthe faithful ‘to look upon the very faces’ of the saints,25[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref25] normally the possibility of direct vision of arelic is deferred or partial. The relic fragment, or bare bones, are housed in areliquary in order to re-present them to the faithful. In their enclosure in areliquary, moreover, the relic is often kept ‘secret’ and hidden. Even ifdevotees wish to ‘see’, they are not likely to see much or see clearly. Instead,the reliquary presents something that seems like an alternative ‘body’ orpresence of the saint.Often a form that faces us, confronts us or addresses us, the reliquary must actin a way that is direct and produces a visceral response. Whether facilitated bymaterials or form, however, such communication is neither simple nor natural.Although ‘representing’ bodies, reliquaries do not necessarily take the shape ofa body – certainly, at least, not a whole body. Despite appearances andassertions to the contrary, medieval reliquaries that do take the shape of bodyparts are not shaped like human heads and appendages in order to make themfamiliar to their viewers: they are meant to be exceedingly strange andcorrespondingly powerful. To paraphrase an anthropological notion of mimicry,‘the spirit of the [relic/reliquary] is not its outer form.’ The strikinglymimetic yet fragmentary quality of the reliquary instead serves ‘[to lift us]out of ourselves’, leaping the gap between the material world and thoughtthrough ‘sensuous fidelity’.26 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref26] Nor is it safeto assume that body-part-shaped reliquaries always enclose a correspondingbody-part relic – demonstrably they often do not. In the light of theseincongruities, the assertion that reliquaries are straightforwardrepresentations of their contents falls apart, leaving instead objects that arecomplexly metaphorical and relational.For example, one of the most popular types of body-part reliquaries – armreliquaries – plays upon a biblical metaphor and reveals the saint as the activelimb of the ‘body of the Church’ (through his or her relics). They allow theclergy to point and to extend their reach, literally and figuratively, perhapsin the form of miracles of healing, or in the form of theatrical liturgies wheresuch a prop could be used to bless the crowd. Two common gestures appearfrequently, an open-hand gesture and a blessing gesture, as here intwelfth-century arm reliquaries of Bernward and Vincentius in the HildesheimTreasury (illus. 13 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig13]).Each of these gestures supplies a variety of possibilities for the dramatic useof the arm. One medieval text tells of a bishop using such an object to stroke asick man, ‘chasing’ away the illness with a saintly touch. The fingers of thereliquaries often show damage and wear, as do, to a lesser degree, the shaft ofthe arms. Certainly put to use, carried and moved about, the arms wereornamented in fictive vestments and the ‘fall’ of these garments show that thearm was equally plausible in the vertical or horizontal position. Indeed, therealism of many of these life-size reliquaries has startled modern viewers, butsuch realism only made them more effective in their tasks.Head reliquaries make other claims and work other strategies. Mostsignificantly, they allow us to see a face (see illus. 28[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig28], 29 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig29]). Indeed, manyreliquaries are said to speak but they do not do so in the conventional manner;rather, they address their audiences with inscriptions and confrontationalimagery. At times the imagery solicits comparison, whether bodily or in terms ofaction and narrative, and often inscriptions speak in the first person (as ifthe reliquary itself had a voice). Thus, whether or not a face or portrait isincluded, the reliquary always addresses its audience.Ultimately, as above, reliquaries are made to stimulate reaction. It is oursurprise, astonishment or even our stunned silence that marks the effectivenessof the reliquary’s beauty, lavish material, visual references and story(iconography), perceived antiquity, or the way the reliquary is presented andused. Above all, as we are engaged in looking, the reliquary is activated andvaluable.27 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref27]images [images/f0039-01.png]13 Arm reliquaries of Vincentius and Bernward, 12th century, gilded silver,gems, wooden core, h. 56.2 and 54.5 cm, Dommuseum Hildesheim, Germany.THE ARK AND THE TEMPLE AS SACRED SPACEIn order to delve into the iconography of reliquaries – their meaning ascircumscribed by visual tradition – we must first understand the place inChristian tradition of the ur-reliquary and fundamental prototype for all Jewishand Christian sacred containers and shrines: the Ark of the Covenant, theTabernacle and the Temple.Over and above a human urge to enclose and protect the precious, God’sdirectives to build the Ark of the Covenant, the Tabernacle and the Temple canbe understood as divine commands to make spaces suitable to contain the holy.The spaces of the Tabernacle and Ark – and thus sacred architectural order,measure and its material realization – are at the heart of relic display.Because such objects are constructed, the space of reliquaries provides a meansof viewing and, above all, experiencing the relic and its power.The Ark was an essential part of both the Tabernacle and the Temple, surely themost important of the implements that God directed to be made:And they shall make an ark of shittim [that is cedar or acacia] wood: two cubitsand a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadththereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof . . . (Exodus 25:10)Specifying a gold covering, staves and rings to carry the Ark, two cherubim andthe insertion of objects of testimony, God concludes with the assertion that hewould visit the mercy seat or place of propitiation between the cherubim.These divine specifications were, of course, central to medieval questions ofthe legitimacy and production of images, as well as interpretable asinstructions concerning notions of the ideal. Indeed, in terms of the former –image legitimacy – the fact that God required figural elements to bemanufactured for the Ark legitimized the presence of figures in the most holyspaces of Judaism and Christianity. But above all, I would like to first focuson how the Ark is like a reliquary in its construction and meaning.images [images/f0041-01.png]14 Gerard Hoet (1648–1733) and others, illustration of Exodus 40:17–19 from theFigures de la Bible (1728).Like a reliquary, the Ark held relics or, as they are called in the Bible,testimony, including the tablets of the Law (the divine word), a pot of manna(divine sustenance) and the rod of Aaron (a tool of leadership, marked asmiraculous by its flowering). Above all, like a reliquary, the Ark was acontingent object, interacting with viewers in a social environment (illus. 14[06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig14]).The Ark was quintessentially portable, made with rings and staves for carryingand indeed, once it was fixed in place in Solomon’s Temple, it seems to havemysteriously disappeared.28 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref28] According to God’scommand in Exodus, it was made by divinely appointed artisans (led by Bezalel)of shittim or cypress wood (resistant to decay) and covered with sheet gold. Thefigural cherubim were made of massive gold and according to Jewish commentary,were capable of movement and response. Associated with light in Jewishtradition, the Ark was used to both lead and save the Jewish people in theirwanderings. It circled the walls of Jericho seven times and was instrumental inthe walls’ destruction. In public showings, it was covered and not trulyvisible. Those that treated it carelessly or inappropriately were mortallypunished.The Ark’s home was in the Tabernacle, another structure for which God gaveinstructions to Moses on Sinai. With the making and remaking of the Tabernacle,a temporary tent-like enclosure constructed of curtains, veils and pillars, wemove more closely to architecture, although a structure of an impermanent form.Remarkably, medieval Exegetes took the biblical directives as instruction forspiritual exercise in the full sense of edification as both building and moralimprovement, an intersection of the categories of the material and devotionalthat is well suited to conceptualizing reliquaries.29[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref29]There is no doubt that these biblical prototypes stood behind the making ofreliquaries (and churches) throughout the Middle Ages. One of the most commonLatin designations for a reliquary was arca; commentary on the Ark and theTemple by the Venerable Bede, Pope Gregory the Great (in the Regula pastoralis,c. 590) and many others makes it clear that this term was not used casually. Aswith Hrabanus Maurus, the Carolingian abbot of the German monastery of Fulda,who discusses an Ark (reliquary) that he commissioned, comparing its form andmovements explicitly to those of the Ark of the Covenant,30[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref30] medieval patrons of reliquaries felt a deepconnection between their efforts and those of the patriarchs and kings of theOld Testament. In creating beautiful artworks for the Church, and beautifulenvironments for the holy, they believed they were fulfilling God’s commandmentsas given to Moses.Crucially, in medieval exegesis, the Ark no longer holds its Old Testamentstatus as a place of sacrifice. The ultimate sacrifice – that of Christ – hadalready occurred. Instead, the Ark became the space of the Trinity and areminder of the Passion. As Paul wrote, the veil of the temple is replaced inthe New Covenant by a spiritual reality:But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He enteredthrough the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is tosay, not of this creation; and not through the blood of goats and calves, butthrough His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtainedeternal redemption. (Hebrews 9:11–12)Or as Abbot Suger of the Abbey of Saint-Denis wrote of one of histwelfth-century windows that depicted the Ark: ‘[it is] urging us onward fromthe material to the immaterial . . . / What Moses veils, the doctrine of Christunveils . . . / From the ark of the covenant is established the altar ofChrist.’31 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref31] In the later Middle Ages the Arkeven became a place of revelation for individual devotions:And by this [the interior of the Ark] is signified the state of contemplation inwhich God reveals his glory and reveals his secrets. There no one can enter butthe most intimate friends who have arrived at a perfection of very great grace.And they still cannot enter except after great suffering and after many tears.32[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref32]This elision of the Ark as the place of sacrifice with the Ark as embodiment ofthe promise of the Resurrection could not be more beautifully imaged than in theMarian chapel at Karlštejn Castle (illus. 15 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig15]), whichoffers the Ark as a means of encountering and seeing the divine (catching aglimpse of the invisible through the visible). In illustration of Revelation11:19 in a sequence of Apocalyptic images (at the location of one of the greatrelic collections of the Middle Ages, see Chapter Three [08_Chapter03.xhtml]), acompassionate Christ is depicted as emerging from the depths of the unlocked Arkas if from the tomb. Surrounding the floating temple that encloses the goldenreliquary-like Ark are howling masks, perhaps signifying the visionary nature ofthis image or the end of time.33 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref33] Rather thandisplay the wounds and abused body of the Man of Sorrows, Christ is gloriouslyrobed as the Salvator Mundi of the Last Judgement and in his left hand he holdsa silver globe upon which is limned a map of the earth. With his right hand,however, held in a blessing gesture, Christ points to his eyes. This gesturealerts us to question what we see, and we are reminded that this vision,granting us privileged access to the interior of the Temple of the Lord, canonly properly be viewed with the eyes of the spirit. In some sense, thiscautionary gesture warns us that the viewing of any Ark/reliquary must be aspiritual experience.images [images/f0044-01.png]15 Nicholas Wurmser of Strasbourg(?), Apocalyptic Ark from Revelation 11:19,wall painting on the eastern wall of the Chapel of Our Lady, Karlštejn Castle,Czech Republic, before 1362–3.THE MULTIPLICATION OF RELICSAs we embark on an investigation of reliquaries, we should remember that,despite the rhetorical claims for the purported uniqueness and persistence ofrelics, and their status as eternal (discussed above), the Tabernacle was notitself a singular or persistent object. More accurately, it was a set ofinstructions for the making of a space. The parts may have been retained fromone making to the next, but the whole could be recreated anew, even recreated inthe imagination from instructions. This sense of seriality and reproducibilitycreates the possibility of dispersal, universality and potential power that iscrucially important to both relics and reliquaries.Many reliquaries or relic-like works are quintessentially reproductions, some asmiraculous reiterations, such as the acheiropoeta, or images ‘made withouthands’. The most famous is the Veronica (discussed in Chapter Three[08_Chapter03.xhtml], see illus. 41 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig41]), which was saidto have been made on Christ’s way to Golgotha, when a sympathetic woman namedVeronica (vera icona, true image) offered a cloth to Christ so he could wipe thesweat from his brow. An image of Christ’s face was imprinted on the towel.Reproduction of this miraculous divine image did not diminish its power, as eachcopy was equally powerful. Similarly, images of the Madonna painted by St Lukecould be copied and yet retain their authentic and miraculous qualities, just asBuddha’s footprints could be reproduced and Muhammad’s sandal could be traced.The last example, the sandal, is a particularly instructive case of reproductionof the holy as the mechanism of copying is reputed to have an authoritativelineage. One of the prophet’s sandals, said to be authentic, was encased andsupplied with a keeper, and given by a thirteenth-century Ayyubid ruler to amadrasa (or medrese, an institution of higher learning) in Damascus. There itbecame the symbol of just rulership as well as an object of pilgrimage anddevotion. At a certain moment, the object was copied or traced exactly. Thistracing was then available to make other tracings, thereby allowing an intimateinteraction with the relic for many viewers. One possible form of interaction,attested in an early text that discussed the original, was to place the sandalover the face, a gesture that humbles the devotee (the dust of the sandal isvenerated and the devotee is lower than the low), and emphatically reverses theusual disgust with which shoes are treated in the Muslim world. There is alsoevidence that the tracings were used in the same way.But the sandal is not only a relic that represents Muhammad’s body. It alsoindicates his presence and potential for action. Representations of the sandalare often combined with imagery that concerns pilgrimage, especially to Mecca,so that one reads the sandal representations as footsteps but also footstepsthat can travel. Each iteration of the sandal, even if abstract in its rendering(illus. 16 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig16]), recreated the beneficial aura or barakaof the original (this example may reference a collection of the relics of theProphet gathered in the Topkapi Palace, as it finds its place in a prayerbook).34 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref34] The multiplication and dispersal ofrelics may even demarcate territory, and in some sense track the spread ofcivilization, thus, in the case of the Topkapi collection, asserting Ottomanauthority and rule.35 [13_References.xhtml#rch01ref35]So, although reliquaries make rhetorical claims to the singularity of the relicsthey contain, it was important to religions that relics and miraculous images,and even reliquaries, were disseminated and reproduced. The understanding of thepower of a relic, and its civilization, culture or religion, was moreefficaciously spread if copies and fragments could be disseminated – thus,reproducibility as well as divisibility are essential qualities of relics.Although in contemporary medieval thought bodies would rise entire at theResurrection, it should be noted that theologians also specified that partswould reunite, reflecting a network of powerful effects – in the case of relics,sacred effects. Paulinus of Nola compared the dispersal of the relics of StFelix to the scattering of seeds by birds (or even the insemination of theearth): ‘the sacred ashes have been scattered over different areas likelife-giving seeds . . . the drops of ashes have begotten rivers of life’.36[13_References.xhtml#rch01ref36] As early as the twelfth century, it was arguedthat relics were multiplied (like the loaves and the fishes) in order to magnifythe grace of the Lord. Just as, according to a well-known Buddhist legend, KingAshoka collected and then dispersed 84,000 relics of the Buddha in order toestablish the religion across Asia, in each of these cases, unity is is forgedrather than lost in dispersal.images [images/f0047-01.png]16 ‘Sandal of Prophet’ (recto), ‘Supplication to God’ (verso), folio 93 from anAnàm-i Sharif, c. 1790, prayer book in Ottoman Turkish, ink, opaque watercolourand gold on paper, single folio 22.5 × 14 cm.In sum, relics are ubiquitous, contagious and often virtually invisible. Theywould seem to be dangerous and difficult to control and at times that will proveto be true. It surely can be said that reliquaries have their job cut out forthem."},{"pageContent":"2OBJECTS OF INFINITE POWER: RELICS IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGESIF THUS FAR OUR FOCUS has been on materials and relatively universalcharacteristics of relics, here we turn to issues of history and change. Neithera straightforward narrative with clear beginning, middle and end, nor achronologically calibrated series of changes of style or type, the history ofreliquaries tells a story of change in response to the demands of faith –artistic solutions using ever more provocative forms. As such, reliquaries aremost emphatically not art for art’s sake, but objects of spiritual utility.Indeed, early medieval reliquaries have many roles, suiting the relics that theyhouse and the circumstances of their use. As commodities with ‘social lives’,relics begin with an inherent lack of identity. In fact, their neutrality andflexibility are the very qualities that allow them to be put into service asgifts and exchange, as well as to be shaped by story, culture and context intoobjects of immeasurable value, even subject to theft. Performing in such anunstable environment of desire, however, means that relics – that is, theirreliquaries – are subject to continual remaking, endlessly edited and revised tobetter inspire devotion and arouse the faithful to prayer. Objects of infinitepotential, essential elements in the production of power, and means for thedelimitation of the proper attitude towards the sacred – that is, the productionof social decorum – relics and their reliquaries played a central role in thehistory of the early Middle Ages.1 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref1]In the course of our discussion of examples of reliquaries and their primarilypre-millennial historical context, a few trends in relic presentation will be ofparticular interest. First, the recursive layering or nesting of relics withinsuccessive reliquaries will prove to be a transcultural and enduring approach ofsecuring and ‘treasuring’ the relic, with, in fact, perhaps the most strikingexample coming from medieval China.Second, reliquary shapes will be seen to promote relics in specific sorts ofways – reliquaries take the shape of sarcophagi, medicine bottles and boxes,purses, churches, books, arms, feet, heads and many other forms, each carrying aparticular meaning. Although the German notion of a redende Reliquiar – that is,a reliquary that ‘speaks’ by indicating its contents via its outer form – is anappealing concept, it proves to be an oversimplification. Reliquaries have muchmore complex things to ‘say’, and although they sometimes seem like isolatedobjects, they take their place in a complex dialogue or interaction of things.Hence, relic collecting is a third essential strategy of relic presentation ofthe early Middle Ages and will figure in the discussion of almost every relicexample in this chapter, an important part of the historical circumstances ofmost relics that continually emerges as a meaningful aspect of relic display.Relics were collected assiduously, they travelled in flocks and were almost whatone might call ‘gregarious’. If we were to imagine them speaking, we might haveto imagine such speech as very noisy gossip! Collecting is perhaps the firstgesture of relic-ing.From the time of Emperor Constantine and his establishment of Christianity asthe legitimate religion of the Roman Empire, Christian leaders both collectedand distributed relics. The first material remains and the reliquaries thathoused them survive from the fourth century, and it is clear that the Churchquickly saw the advantage in taking the lead in legitimating and establishingcults. Bishop Ambrose, in fourth-century Milan, may have been the first‘impresario’ of the relic cults of his city, moving relics about to greateffect, but soon enough Pope Damasus was building up Rome as a veritable capitalof martyrs.2 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref2]Insofar as relics were used to dedicate every church, every altar and even everyportable altar, saints of local significance loomed large throughout Europe, asin Milan and Rome. Such saints became associated with particular churches andterritories and, as patrons and protectors, marked the land as sacred. The powerof personal intercession by these saints is the origin of the regionalism thatdistinctively marks the early period of relic cult in Western Europe (incontrast to the more universal cults of the late Middle Ages and after).Nevertheless, we cannot properly tell the story of relics of the early MiddleAges without also discussing the circulation of relics.Despite intensely local cults, saints also moved out of their localities,‘overlapping’ with other saints and creating kinships and networks. Although notknown for a wealth of bodily relics of saints, Ireland offers a vivid example ofhow a reliquary can intervene in such issues. The shrine of St Manchán, thefounder of the monastery at Lemanaghan, County Offaly, reiterated the form of a‘grave’, as its inscription notes, but was also portable (illus. 17[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig17]). The figures of unarmed soldiers affixed to itssurface vividly represent a community brought together under a cross. The shrineseems to have served as an expediter of political contracts as well as the meansof empowerment of ritual circuits of churchmen. Such spatial mobility allowedthe control and definition of territory, and continued the peripatetictraditions first instituted by St Patrick.3 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref3]But saintly kinship circles were not created just within the clans of Ireland,nor among the noblemen of France. They also extended across Europe from one sideto another and from north to south in an international exchange of relics ofremarkable extent.4 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref4] Notwithstanding the Church’snominal control of cults, secular rulers following Constantine’s lead collectedand disseminated relics and may have been the most effective in using relics asinstruments of power. By the time of the Merovingian period, the collecting ofrelics was called the ‘custom of kings’ (and queens if we consider Radegund’sefforts as discussed below). A first major era of collecting culminates in theefforts of the emperor Charlemagne, who both gave and received relics inunprecedented numbers, in part as diplomatic exchange, building upon the effortsof his predecessors and firmly establishing a model for the manipulation ofrelics as a central feature of the power of a Christian king – although hisaccomplishments in this arena are greatly exaggerated by spurious later monasticclaims and fanciful romance epics.images [images/f0051-01.png]17 Shrine of St Manchán, c. 1130, yew wood with bronze and brass metalwork andenamelled fittings, 58 × 33 × 48 cm approx., St Manchán’s Church, County Offaly,Ireland.The myriad relics that Emperor Charlemagne gave to the abbot Angilbert and themonastery of Saint-Riquier (Centula) are a case in point. Although themonastery, unfortunately, is no longer extant, Saint-Riquier’s reception ofthose relics is well documented. The relics (probably tiny fragments) came fromthe east, from the popes, from the Holy Land and from across Europe, and manypassed through Charlemagne’s collection. They were subsequently distributed to aseries of altars in the church that became the focus of ritual liturgies. Theseliturgies were performed in complex itineraries that wove their way around thechurch, in performances that employed the bodies of the monks, servants andtownspeople in celebrations and processions on a yearly, weekly, even dailybasis. Such rituals were effective in magnifying the saints’ glory, but also in‘recreating’ a sort of image of the saints in the court of the HeavenlyJerusalem.Saint-Riquier surely was not unique. Churches did not receive relics by chance;they were acquired with purpose and, as at the Carolingian monastery, with theclear intention of creating sacred spaces on earth. Of course, as above, theyalso created networks of affiliation: at Saint-Riquier bonds were forged betweena patron and a specially favoured courtier, between the emperor’s court and themonastery, and between secular and clerical interests. In the Carolingianperiod, indeed, another significant network of affiliations developed throughthe exchange of relics and the encouragement of prayer brotherhoods.Remarkably, if the desired relics were not readily available, it is clear thatthere were means by which abbots, bishops or kings could obtain them. Requestscould be sent, exchanges take place and in extreme cases, furta sacra, or sacredrelic theft, could be and was justified. Such thefts could involve thepremeditated acquisition of a patron saint of great potential power, as in thecase of St Foi, who was described in historical accounts as amenable to the move(see illus. 19 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig19]), or they could be the result of astealthy grab of a handful of powder, as recounted by the irritated Carolingianchurchman Einhard, discovering a theft that occurred when his agent was carryingthe ‘ashes’ of Marcellinus north from Rome.5 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref5]Einhard’s story, in fact, represents another very important episode in theredistribution of relics in the early Middle Ages. Relics were traded,especially as a means to supply the north – lacking martyrs – with adistribution from the rich deposits in the catacombs in the south – that is,Rome. Much of such trade was not legitimate, in that the outright sale of relicsfor profit was never condoned by the Church (although there were many ways toget around such prohibitions).Indeed, to return to Rome, such depredations of the catacombs were enough of athreat that Pope Paschal I (817–24) effected a mass transfer of bodies from theunprotected catacombs outside the city of Rome into the church of SantaPrassede. His work could be considered a kind of collecting. He commemorated hisactions, casting them as a demonstration of Rome’s sanctity and the creation ofa communion of saints that was, once more, a reflection of the HeavenlyJerusalem, as represented in the mosaic on the apse of the church, the saintsgathered around Christ within the jewelled walls (illus. 18[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig18]).As we have already begun to see, it was staging and ritual that demonstratedrelics’ personhood or agency, and therefore power. Relics were inserted intoceremonies and practices that treated them as if they actually were the saintsthey represented (a treatment entirely congruent with relic doctrine). In onelegal procedure, relics could be ‘put to the test’, in other words burned, toascertain whether they were genuine, much in the way of witches who were subjectto trial by fire to determine whether they had magical powers or not. It wasalso common to swear oaths on relics, just as today witnesses are asked to swearon a Bible in a U.S. or British court of law. Of course miracles were also aclear demonstration of a saint’s ability to act in the world, and miracles,especially those of healing, encouraged pilgrimage and visits to the saints.One sort of saintly social interaction, ‘relic humiliation’, although rare, is afascinating and radical confirmation of the medieval belief that the saintresided in his or her relics. If a community believed its patron was notresponding to their prayers, they had recourse – in effect, they shamed thesaint, overturning and reversing the usual veneration. The ritual atSaint-Martin, Tours, is revealing:images [images/f0054-01.png]18 The Saints Welcomed to the Heavenly Jerusalem, mosaic commissioned by PopePaschal I, c. 822, Santa Prassede, Rome.[They] place on the ground . . . all of the reliquaries of the saints and putthorns on top of and all around the tomb of Saint Martin. In the centre of thenave they place a wooden crucifix likewise covered with thorns, and they blockwith thorns all but one of the church doors.6 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref6]This behaviour found its power precisely in its ability to shock. It may haveworked to coerce lay leaders into modifying their actions towards the monastery,but the ritual was clearly and specifically addressed to the saints themselves;it was not public, and put the saints, in a sense, in ‘solitary’.Above all, however, it was properly regular liturgical practices thatestablished the liveliness and presence of saints in their relics and theirability to act in this world. In particular, processions put saints into motion;whether on feast days or special occasions, sacred parades asserted the saints’powers. St Foi of Conques (illus. 19 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig19]) wasparticularly formidable in procession:images [images/f0055-01.png]19 Majesty of St Foi, 2nd–10th centuries and later additions, gilded silver,copper, enamel, rock crystal and precious stones, cameos, wooden core, 85 × 36 ×24 cm, Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy de Conques, France.. . . clergy and laity . . . move forward with great formality, carrying candlesand lamps . . . the holy relics, embellished all around with enamels and goldand studded with a variety of gems, flashing like stars . . . [one hears thesounds of] clashing cymbal, and even horns made of ivory that was donated bynoble pilgrims to adorn the monastery . . . such great numbers [of the sick]were healed . . . the divine work never stopped . . .There were, indeed, so many miracles occasioned by this particular processionthat the monks could not even get a chance to sit down to their evening meal.Given that Foi was famous for her practical jokes (which also served as modelsto the faithful), it is no surprise that during the procession a few miraclesoccurred that taught lessons: when a monk ridiculed an infirm old woman whoblocked the way, sneering that old age was not a curable disease, the womansuddenly leaped to her feet, proving that God had compassion for all and thatmonks too could be fools. In another example, a pious deaf man customarilycarried St Foi’s litter, and when suddenly cured, nearly went mad from the loudnoises and commotion of the event! (He did recover, and praised Foi.)This specific miracle-inducing procession had been initiated by the monks toresolve a dispute over a contested property. St Foi, in the form of herreliquary, was often carried to the site of territory disputes in order toresolve them in favour of her monastery. Her ‘presence’ asserted by her oversizehead, the ‘attentive, observant gaze’ of her ‘reflective’ eyes, her hands thatreached into the viewer’s space and her elaborately powerful and magnificentlygemmed body not only served to welcome supplicants’ prayers but also,apparently, intimidated the monastery’s foes. She was so effective that themonks complained that the townspeople of Conques asked too often for the relicsto be processed.7 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref7]The stories about St Foi clearly show us how the relics of the saints werepowerful forces in the politics and daily life of the Middle Ages, amplified viaimpressive and portable reliquaries that were useful as part of a socialperformance. A relic’s power might also be amplified through its associationwith a community of other relics, an aesthetic/material relic-ing manoeuvre wewill call nesting and enclosure.NESTING AND ENCLOSUREWhat led to the enclosure of relics? First, a common principle in the MiddleAges, one that contrasts strikingly with the presentation of relics in latemedieval reliquaries, was the conviction that relics should be protected fromcarnal sight. There are few crystals or other means of direct access to relicsbefore around 1000; other ideas of visuality and meaning apply in this era.8[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref8]At the same time that reliquaries were designed around the urge to protect and‘treasure’ the relic by hiding it, however, their construction testified to thecommon belief in the impossibility of that action. That is, it was taken as anarticle of faith that the relic’s power would always escape any enclosure. Themanoeuvre of enclosure, given its futility, leads to multiple further acts ofenclosure and something we might call the scalability of the relic cult. Thatis, in addition to the micro-environment of the portable reliquary, the powernetwork of the relic is successively ‘increased’ through various layers: thesharing of space with other relics, and placement in altars, chapels and thelarger environment of the church. In that many of the reliquaries we willdiscuss survive in museums or treasuries, an effort to remember their originalplace in a larger architectural setting of ritual and space is paramount. Or, asone scholar has argued, a proper consideration of relics isgrounded in an understanding that space is socially produced: the shrines, thesanctuary, the monastery, the . . . church – all, rather than absolute or‘natural’ spaces, are local and contingent, and their significance is generatedthrough interests and regulated through representation.Therefore, one has to consider ‘multiple, overlapping sacral geographies’.9[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref9]Already in the fifth century, Paulinus of Nola effectively argued that thetiniest sliver of a relic gained in power in inversion to its size, and thathiding relics within successive structures magnified their potential power andintensified faith. Enshrinement practices indicate that each successive layer ofmaterial, especially if precious or aesthetically value-added, seems to haveincreased potential, as if the relic were under pressure like a seltzer bottlethat has been shaken – as if the very act of containment increased power: ‘inrelations that not only hold and protect, hide and reveal, but displace onesubstance with another . . . the relics are never . . . contained; instead theyare always excessive, overflowing, spilling out.’10[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref10]Yet at the same time, relics must be contained. This is a notion that isembedded deeply in Christian story and tradition. Enclosure serves to definerelics and to honour them, while their hiddenness allows them to participate ina larger, more expansive discourse of faith. Also, an enclosure, necessarily‘new’, defines the relic as ‘old’.11 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref11] Already inthe Jewish tradition, as related in the Old Testament, ‘testimonies’ werehonoured, enclosed in the Ark of the Covenant, and subsequently the Ark wasenclosed in the Tabernacle.In the twelfth century, Bernard of Clairvaux wrote:In its deep and mystical breast, [faith] can grasp what is the length andbreadth and height and depth. ‘What eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor theheart of man conceived’ [I Cor. 2:9] is borne within itself by faith, as ifwrapped in a covering and kept under seal . . . Why wish to touch what is ugly?. . . You will touch me with the hand of faith, the finger of desire, theembrace of love; you will touch me with the mind’s eye.12[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref12]Bernard is weaving together images: of the doubting Thomas’s probing finger, the‘length and breadth’ of the cross or the world, and the ugly matter that is thestuff of the mundane revelation of the divine, perhaps bone or blood ‘wrapped’and ‘sealed’. Bernard may be thinking of relics along with many other materialand performative revelations of the divine that blossom and turn to desire inthe ‘mind’s eye’. If this is materiality and its function is devotion, wrappingand unwrapping, whether literal or figural, is a first step, not so much to hidethe relic, but to honour it, to cultivate its power – ultimately, to allow it torelease its potential.A first means of enclosure (and transportation), therefore, may be taken asarchetypal. Just as the body of Christ was wrapped in cloth in preparation forburial (that led subsequently to resurrection), relics were carefully wrapped inlinen, in silk and in fabric of all types. Furthermore, they were oftendeposited and carried in little cloth sacks or purses, which were thenoccasionally preserved in treasuries. What of such initial or preliminaryenclosure? Remarkably, even the cloth that might be used in this first andexpeditious step (later part of a double wrapping, again like wrapping a bodyfor the grave) was often luxurious and valuable in itself. Much of the figuredsilk or brocade that survives from early centuries – which can be seen ondisplay today in museums and church treasuries – was removed from reliquaries.The honour of the relic demanded the best available, and the luxury of thematerial was more important than any subject depicted on the cloth, even if thatsubject might be pagan (illus. 20 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig20] shows a Sassanianmythical creature, the Senmerv, woven in silk). A similar approach applies tothe use of other materials used to honour relics, including spolia – that is,reused materials (discussed below).But cloth, apart from serving as wrapping and purses for relics, could alsoitself be a relic, a so-called contact relic, gaining its power through havingwrapped or touched a holy body. Cloth is central in Islamic practices for itsrepresentation of the ‘mediated mingling’ of bodily fluids.13[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref13] In Christianity, many cloths may carry specialpower because this sort of relic is one of the few that can be called dominicalor Marian; that is, directly related to Christ or Mary.14[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref14]Finally, cloth takes a special meaning and place in medieval culture whenconsidered from the perspective of gender. Weaving is almost always women’swork;15 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref15] according to the Apocryphal Gospels,Mary herself was said to have spun and woven during her time in the Temple.Theologically, Mary is envisioned as responsible for weaving the cloth that isthe flesh that ‘contains’ Christ, and of course she is also credited withcreating a seamless robe that expanded throughout his life and was gambled forat his death, becoming associated with the Passion. (Interestingly, ‘seamlessgarment’ is a phrase used by pro-life supporters in the U.S.) Cloth becomes, ineffect, the equivalent of skin, and thus again a relic in itself. In all thesesenses, wrapping in cloth becomes a consequential and primary layer and actionthat is the first of layer upon layer of precious materials that is theChristian strategy of presentation and display.images [images/f0060-01.png]20 Patterned silk fragment with large simurgh (sēnmurw) in roundel, Iran orCentral Asia, 8th century, 36.5 × 54.3 cm (maximums), Victoria & Albert Museum,London.Perhaps the most fascinating example of multiple nested containers for relicobjects of power, however, occurs not in the Christian but in the Buddhisttradition and, as such, deserves extended treatment that may allow us to pursuesome of the motivations for such ‘nesting’ of relics, as well as parallels inrelic collecting and dissemination for purposes of political power. Theunderground shrine at Famen Si (Dharma Gate Monastery) in Shaanxi Province inChina was first sealed during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and topped by afour-storey stupa. The stupa was expanded in the Ming dynasty (1569–1620) to athirteen-storey construction, which began to collapse in 1981 (illus 21[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig21]). The excavation of 1987 discovered, in thefoundations of the stupa, four nested sets of relics of Buddha’s ‘finger-bones’,as well as a treasure-trove of inscribed gifts and liturgical objects donated bydevotees, attesting to the prasada, or grace, experienced in the physicalpresence of Buddha’s relics.16 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref16]Although many presentations of Buddhism portray it as a philosophy spreadthrough preaching to an intellectually persuadable populace, more recentscholarship has focused on the potential of Buddhism’s material culture andpractice; stories tell of Buddha himself having to promote relic veneration to asceptical audience. But such material expression of faith has long beenensconced in practice and legend, including a legendary dispute over his body athis death that initiated Buddhist relic veneration with an archetypal divisionand enshrinement of the ashes by eight contending Indian rulers.17[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref17] The relic of the Buddha’s finger at Famen Si,indeed, is said to have been a gift from the emperor Ashoka (r. 273–32 BCE), anideal Buddhist ruler of India who is reputed to have dispersed relics and built84,000 stupas to enshrine and honour them, as well as a central stupa from whichto celebrate a great festival of relics. The number 84,000 inextricably alliedstupa to relic, 84,000 being both the number of atoms reputed to be in Buddha’sbody and an enumeration of his teachings.In the sixth century CE, Emperor Wen of Sui, as part of his programme to unifyChina, emulated Ashoka and made empire-wide relic distributions with reportedmiraculous consequences. Then, in the seventh century, the Famen Si relic itselfsurfaced and was documented in records that attest to its veneration by the Tangemperors on many occasions over more than two centuries. After travelling 150miles to the palace from the monastery, the relic was received and veneratedlavishly by court and emperor. On one such occasion, this reception receivedbitter criticism by a renowned Confucian, Han Yu, who complained that suchactions were contrary to tradition, promoted superstition and were evenindecorous for the emperor. Notwithstanding the clash of cultures that suchcriticism reveals, the relic may have received special attention because ofimperial interest in the monastery and the healing nature of relics. In light ofthe later history of the relic, what is perhaps most striking about theceremonies and their consequences is that the relic’s fame was contingent onpublic display. In sum, although the provenance of Famen Si’s relic is ascribedto a seminal moment in the spread of Buddhism by the Indian ruler Ashoka, itscelebration by the Chinese Tang court came at a later historical turning pointfor Buddhism in China, a moment when China became an important region forBuddhist pilgrimage, a ‘legitimate Buddhist realm’.18[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref18] Relics were important in this change, as theyallowed followers to experience spiritual intimacy despite distances in time andspace.Over and above texts such as the Lotus Sutra (c. 100 BCE–200 CE), whichadvocates the veneration of relics and the building of stupas (in effectmonumental architectural reliquaries), practices such as the honouring ofremains, and especially the giving of gifts and the ritual circumambulation ofstupas, grew essential to religious practice. Of course, in some sense, suchcommunity-supported rituals are supportive of the operation of state buildingand maintenance. In Buddhism the response to relics, the habitus of gift-givingin the presence of relics (that is habitus in Pierre Bourdieu’s sense as apractice grounded in societal norms rather than individual choice), is such thatit is perceived as natural and automatic; not a faith-based act or one thatrequires a prepared mental state, but one that nevertheless wins spiritualreward. Such reactions and rewards are predicated more on the presence (whethervisible or not) of the body or relics, than on the possibility of sight.However, it has also been argued that seeing the relic was an iconic, revelatoryevent, even miraculous, when the sacred substance gave off otherworldly light.Perhaps all this explains some of the remarkable aspects of the Famen Sifinger-bone relic, or relics. Indeed the greatest mystery of the site is whichone of the four relics is the ‘authentic’ one, especially given that all fourhave been called ‘patent fabrications’.images [images/f0063-01.png]21 Ming dynasty stupa, 1569–1620, at Famen Si, after partial collapse in 1981,Shaanxi province, China.images [images/f0063-02.png]22 Eight-part reliquary set, Tang dynasty, Famen Si, chamber number 3, gold,silver, jade, gems and sandalwood (not pictured), 9th century, near Xi’an,Shaanxi province, China.Furthermore, challenging the credibility and beliefs both of priests anddevotees, two of the four that are actually composed of bone (the others arejade) are not finger bones, and none of the four is trying to pass as such. Theyare large and tubular, and one has star positions (the Northern Dipper) etchedon the interior. But this may be fitting:What better expression of the ‘true body’ . . . of the Buddha than a relic whosecenter is empty and whose compass is the entire universe? . . . constructed andcontingent . . . [it is] the dharma body itself.19[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref19]Furthermore, such a form literally indicates Buddha’s wordless teaching whilealso calling upon metaphor: ‘the wise student looks not at the finger but atwhere the finger is pointing’ (at the moon – the luminous mind). The relicobject becomes ‘self-emptying’, or ironic, and the relics become genuine worksof art. Alternatively, the events, containers and relics can be said to indicatethe ‘true body’ mentioned in inscriptions at the site.Notably, these relics-as-art could incite action – not only the giving of giftsbut also acts of self-mortification as documented in response to this relic,such as the cutting off of a finger or even an arm.20[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref20] One story tells of a devotee who, in thepresence of the relic, was not able to see it and chose to burn his finger. Theact and offering was effective and allowed him to see the relic perfectly.Perhaps such self-immolation drew upon the spiritual power of the Buddha,perfected the suppliant’s body and ultimately turned that body as well into a‘holy living relic’.21 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref21] Surely if any reliccould do without a reliquary, it would be such a white jade ‘bone’, an objectmade for devotion and contemplation that has inspired extreme acts of personalsacrifice. But, as above, the Famen Si relics are not just enclosed, butmultiply and even excessively enclosed.All four reliquary ensembles at Famen Si are multi-part, made of preciousmaterials such as jade, gold and rock crystal, carefully sealed into theirrespective crypt areas. Are the additional relics diversions, false relics orsomehow acts of devotion? Perhaps they survive as a sort of heavenly assembly,for just this sort of celestial gathering is depicted on some of thereliquaries. Perhaps the multiplication of containers speaks to a process ofjourneying of the body/relic and reflects funerary practice.The most magnificent reliquary at Famen Si is the ninth-century ensemblesurrounding the jade bone with stars. It has eight nested parts and, unlike theothers, was made in a single programme of production – in a single go: it is anintentional and complete art object, not a cumulative one (illus. 22[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig22]). The first container or enclosure is a tiny goldpagoda with a central post to hold and display the relic through the four sideswith open ‘doors’; the second container is made from a material like alabaster,set with gems and decorated with lotus motifs; the third container is again goldand is gemmed with lotus motifs; the fourth is gold and decorated with images ofBuddha and celestial assemblies; the fifth again is gilded silver with celestialassemblies; the sixth is plain silver; the seventh silver with a large pearl andimages of celestial kings and processions; the eighth and last (now in pieces)was sandalwood with precious fittings and images of Paradise and preaching. Whenthe whole was ‘assembled,’ each container was wrapped in silk before beingdeposited into the next.This assemblage has meaning both in terms of everyday encounters with relics,and in terms of elaborate rituals of purification and binding performed ataltars. Liturgies from Esoteric Buddhism describe an ‘adamantine’ spike (of ahard substance or diamond; compare with the rock crystal) and create an‘adamantine wall’, after which the ‘impregnable seat of enlightenment’ (oraltar) is ready to welcome the deity and his celestial ensemble. Finally, thewhole is sealed and further veneration focused on circumambulation of themassive stone-built stupa rather than interaction with smaller relics orreliquaries.As relics shifted, in Chinese imperial usage, from instruments of healing to themeans of support of political regimes, perhaps the stabilization of the relic inplace at Famen Si was necessary. The sealing with adamantine, a mythicallyimpervious material, may be a gesture towards securing and fixing the power ofthe relic. At any rate, the relic was no longer visible or public. Indeed, thesealing was extremely effective, after the many public displays documented fromthe sixth to the eighth centuries, the ‘palace’ of the ‘True Relic’ cryptremained closed and undisturbed for 1,100 years (only opened as a museum in1988; expanded in 2009).Christian reliquaries of the early Christian and early medieval era do notgenerally have the same sort of surviving historical documentation as Famen Si,and are not quite as spectacular or as definitive in terms of processes ofsealing and enclosing. Nevertheless, they take up much the same strategy ofsuccessive enclosure and may entail similar stories, rituals and politicalmanoeuvres (also a similar habitus). A cylindrical box of silver discovered inthe altar of St Euphemia in Grado (illus. 23 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig23]) isdivided into wedge-shaped compartments that contained a tiny gold box, a fewminiature glass vials and a silver capsule. Each of these objects was probably areliquary itself, the whole very like early Gandharan Buddhist reliquaries madeof steatite found in many collections, including the British Museum, which havesimilar internal divisions.images [images/f0066-01.png]23 Silver pyx reliquary, found in situ in the altar of St Euphemia in Grado,Italy, c. 5th–6th century.images [images/f0067-01.png]24 Set of three reliquaries discovered under pavement of church apse, CanavarTepe, Bulgaria, c. mid-4th/mid-5th century, gold and gems, garnets, 6.1 × 4.7 ×3.8; silver, 9.3 × 5.6 × 11 cm; marble, 22.4 × 15.5 × 15.6 cm, VarnaArchaeological Museum, Bulgaria.Another early Christian example, in Varna Archaeological Museum, again excavatedfrom its undisturbed ‘burial’ in an altar, is a set of three nested pieces,again with the most precious gold and gemmed box in the centre, encased in asilver box, finally enclosed in a marble sarcophagus-shaped exterior, each layerwrapped in silk when nested and buried (illus. 24 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig24]).These early reliquaries have been characterized as following a ‘consistentspatial and material grammar of embedding, interring, concealing, andcontrolling access’, and were only ‘briefly but spectacularly visible’.22[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref22] They were often buried in the altar, but alsomay have lain below it and, in a few documented cases, in an ingeniousarrangement: the relics were ‘accessible’ to the faithful but not visible – theywere located in proximity to the altar and accessible through a fenestella(little window)-like opening at the exterior of the church, through whichdevotees could pour oil over them and retrieve the newly sacral oil as arelic-like substance. Similarly, in Rome from as early as at least the sixthcentury, the grave of St Peter was accessible through a fenestella and one couldcarry away its blessings via brandea – that is, tiny cloths that were loweredinto the tomb to touch the grave.In contrast, one might recall the example of the basilica and remains ofDemetrios of Thessaloniki, in which the location of the relics is entirelyuncertain but an icon of the saint is ensconced in a ciborium in the nave andoil is collected in the crypt as a ‘relic’ of the saint. The reliquaries thatcarry this oil (many from the tenth century) take the approach of nestedcontainers, perhaps in this instance to amplify the prestige of a secondaryrelic. Small reliquaries of Demetrios were popular in the Byzantine capital ofConstantinople and were owned by both aristocrats and emperors, survivingprimarily in the form of pendants and small boxes. Like the relics of Famen Si,they were renowned for healing miracles, but unlike the entombment of thoserelics and other early Christian examples, the Demetrios reliquaries could betransported and opened. Indeed, they seem to have urged the participation of theowner who was called upon to manipulate and move the parts of the reliquary –opening little doors, or in one case, sliding the ‘coffin’ with the ‘relics’ ofthe saint in and out of its place in the miniature ‘ciborium’.23[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref23]In these cases in which we perhaps better understand how the relics functionedvis-à-vis their audiences, we can see that, like the Buddhist examples, therelics serve first and foremost as a foundation for the religious institutionbut that, in some fashion, they continue to be accessible and to provide comfort– they even sometimes have the capacity to leave the shrine of the saint tocarry the prestige of the institution to other places.The examples above, in which the relics are, in a sense, embedded in buildings,bring up the question of architectural ‘nesting’ and recall a famous story, notfrom the early Christian East but now from the early medieval West of Europe.This story brings us back to issues of royal collecting, but in this case by awoman. Radegund, a sixth-century Merovingian queen, who in a gesture ofextravagant piety (and rebellion against her husband) retired to a monastery shefounded in Poitiers, ‘with great devotion [began] to collect relics of all thesaints. At her request, a venerable priest named Magnus brought her relics ofLord Andrew and many others which she placed above the altar.’ Praying beforethese tokens, including the Apostolic relic of Andrew, she had a vision of a‘resplendent man’, in whose presence she was told that even relics she hadgathered and lost as a young girl were miraculously now once more present in hercollection. As confirmed by this heavenly messenger, Radegund’s collectingproject was divinely blessed and eternal. Indeed her biographer, the nunBaudonivia, argues that Radegund’s devotion and prayers drew relics to her:After she had entered into the monastery, she assembled a great multitude ofsaints through her most faithful prayers . . . as many came freely to her asgifts as came in response to her pleas. In their company, she gave herself up tochanting hymns and psalms continuously in ceaseless meditation. At last newscame to her that the holy limbs of Lord Mammas the Martyr rested at Jerusalem.She manages to acquire these relics of Mammas, extending the ‘geography’ of hercollection towards the East. Bishop Gregory of Tours, Radegund’s friend andprotector, further testifies to her preoccupation with the Holy Land, writingthat she ‘repeatedly sent servants to Jerusalem and throughout the entire regionof the East’. Finally, Baudonivia recounts:Thus, like Saint Helena [Constantine’s mother who found the buried relic of theTrue Cross], imbued with wisdom, full of the fear of God, glorious with goodworks, she eagerly sought to salute the wood where the ransom of the world[Christ] was hung for our salvation that we might be snatched from the power ofthe devil. When she found it, she clapped both hands.Radegund’s success was indeed reason for celebration. She had, in fact,petitioned the Byzantine emperor and empress to grant her a relic of the TrueCross and had had to navigate the hostilities of a competitive bishop in orderto receive it. Bishop Fortunatus, Radegund’s friend and supporter, complimentedthe empress Sophia for complying with Radegund’s request, thereby ‘scatteringsalvation’ to the West from the ‘shimmering axis of the East’.24[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref24]Radegund presumably received the relic already protected by a reliquary. Shefurther honoured it by enclosing it in a larger casket along with other relics,and in turn this arca was placed in an oratory. This story shows us something ofhow embedding is often elaborated. A relic travels in a reliquary of some sort,is honoured by its recipient with another reliquary container and is surroundedby ‘companions’ – other relics. As the relic enters into the social structure ithas encountered, it is thus enshrined and then placed in an appropriate space,in this case an oratory chapel.Radegund collected like a queen in that she was able to petition her colleaguethe empress for the precious relic of the True Cross, but she received like anun and a woman, ecstatically welcoming the relic as if it were Christ himself.As a bride receives her Lord, she welcomed the relic into her chamber. Incontrast, a later scandalous story involves a rebellious nun of the monasteryremoving the cross from its ‘chamber’, waving it about in a threatening mannerand loudly claiming its political power – to her decided detriment rather thanbenefit. The story demonstrates that enclosure was a process that was bothdevotional and necessary to the relic’s power, continuous with making the relicpart of a social structure that functioned properly. Unfortunately, the relicand reliquary that survive today in Poitiers cannot be the original, so there isvery little material testimony to support this complex story. For anunderstanding of what Western medieval reliquaries looked like and how they usedform as a strategy, we must turn to other examples.SHAPED RELIQUARIESUnlike Radegund or the wayward nun from her monastery, male ecclesiastics whohad control of relics could use them to amplify their spiritual power, or‘extend their reach’, in either case, often intending to dazzle onlookers, toarouse their devotion and to intensify their religious experience with the sightof beautiful objects. In the fourth century, Paulinus of Nola confessed that he‘saved’ some relics out of the altar in order to have them available for his owndevotions in times of need. By the eleventh century, Abbot Gauzlin used theinnovative form of an arm-shaped reliquary to ‘strengthen . . . [the crowd] by abenediction made by the relics’.25 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref25] Afterdedicating altars to Michael, Gregory and Martin, Abbot Berthold of Weingartenin the thirteenth century decided to use an ‘excess’ of relics to make thegilded silver head reliquary of Martin ‘in order to encourage the faith andpiety [of the people]’.26 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref26] Such unexpected andinnovative uses and forms speak to the desire to make relics and reliquariesspectacular and exciting for their audiences, especially through the use ofmeaningful shapes.In early medieval Ireland, the dispersal of holy material was essential toChristianization. St Columcille travelled, founding churches and leaving behindboth disciples and ‘treasured objects’. Reliquaries of unusual shapes such asbells and staffs were used as ‘performative extensions of the holy body’ byabbots and missionaries.27 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref27] It is true thatbells were of great utility for travelling Irish missionaries – used to ring outcanonical hours of prayer – and croziers served as marks of status andauthority, but when such objects were encased in precious metal as reliquariesthey became something entirely different. The bell no longer rings whenenshrined but still speaks to the activity of the saint, the ability to ‘awaken’the spirit. The crozier might hold relics in the ‘drop’ of the head, placingsacred matter in the abbot or bishop’s hands and exercising the potential to bepushed ‘in the face’ of the sinful Christian who might be chastised by theshepherd’s hook (illus. 25 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig25]).images [images/f0072-01.png]25 Crozier of Clonmacnoise, c. 1100 and later additions (figure of bishop ondrop), wood wrapped in sheet bronze with inlaid silver and niello, 96.5 × 15.9 ×4.6 cm, National Museum of Ireland, Dublin.The eleventh-century Clonmacnoise crozier made at the monastery in County Offalyis not only covered with a beautiful protective knot ornament signifying theaura of power of the object, but also carries a fierce face overgrown with plantmaterial and a full figure of the saint holding the crozier on the drop (addedlater in the Middle Ages), ‘making the body of the founder saint visible andactive’.28 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref28] These Irish reliquaries dispersed byColumcille and others are objects that are instrumental in spreading culture and‘civilization’. Unlike many shaped reliquaries, they literally take the shape ofthe thing they contain.In the more Romanized area of Europe, just at the turn of the millennium,Archbishop Egbert of Trier founded metalworking workshops in order to producelavish reliquaries that served as spectacular props for the liturgy. One of therelics involved was reputed to be the very staff of St Peter, which had worked amiracle in raising a dead man in the hands of an early sainted bishop of Trier.Although the same relic was said to be in Cologne, and Egbert did not even claimto have the entire staff, he was able, with a glorious and long metal cover(taller than a man), to make the staff appear not only complete but trulymagnificent, covered with gems and enamel and inscriptions naming the Apostlesas well as the bishops of Trier.A second project was perhaps even more spectacular and complex. The portablealtar of St Andrew’s sandal not only participates in the concepts of enclosureand enshrinement, but also addresses a wide range of other powers andpossibilities of the reliquary (illus. 26 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig26]). Theself-proclaimed ‘altar consecrated to Andrew’ contains, according to itsinscription: the Nail of the Lord, the sandal of Andrew, the beard of Peter,links from his chains and ‘other holy relics’.29[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref29] Through these relics, Egbert, who is named aspatron, has claimed association to the Apostles, now to both Peter and Andrew,patrons of Rome and Constantinople. He then goes further through other aspectsof the ornamentation of the altar to make claims about the reliquary’s power.First and foremost, the portable object is associated with the Ark of theCovenant via a shared quality of portability. This is clearly asserted throughthe inclusion of the lion’s heads with rings that make up the feet of the altar.images [images/f0074-01.png]26 Workshop of Archbishop Egbert, altar of St Andrew, 977–93, silver, gold,gems, enamel, spolia gems and brooch, Justinianic coin, with multiple relicsincluding holy nail in its own reliquary, 45 × 22 cm, Trier Cathedral, Germany.In his Regula pastoralis (591), Pope Gregory the Great implicitly argued thatprocessions create a unity for the Church and that carrying the Ark constitutescarrying its lessons out among the people:What else is symbolized by the precious Ark of the Covenant but the Holy Church?Its four rings are the four Gospels. Staves are set into these rings that it maybe borne by teachers, ‘for to carry the Ark with staves is to bring Holy Churchthrough preaching to the untutored minds of unbelievers.’ These staves areoverlain with gold and then carried by priests, ‘that when the sound of theirpreaching goes forth to others, they may themselves shine in the splendor oftheir way of life.’30 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref30]In addition to the rings, Egbert adorned the reliquary with the images of theEvangelical beasts to reinforce this sense of his altar. Surely he meant to‘shine in the splendor of their [the Apostle’s] way of life’, because presumablyhe would have carried the staff of Peter reliquary and followed behind thisaltar reliquary in processions, creating a vision in which he quite literally‘followed in the footsteps’ of the Apostles. Again Gregory wrote that the priestshould ‘meditate unceasingly on the lives of those elders. The priest then walksblamelessly, when he is ever contemplating the examples of the fathers whopreceded him, when without interruption he regards the footsteps of theSaints.’31 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref31] On the top of this altar is a goldenfoot, enclosed in a gemmed version of the sandal relic that the altar contains.As the Gospels remind us in Romans 10:15, ‘How beautiful are the feet of those[the Apostles] who bring good news of good things!’images [images/f0076-01.png]27 Inner compartment of the Staurothek (True Cross reliquary) of Limburg an derLahn, Byzantine, c. 948–59, gold, enamel and gems, 48 cm × 35 cm × 6 cm, LimburgCathedral, Germany.Before we leave our discussion of this remarkable object we should also note itsuse, or rather reuse, of materials – that is, the lavish use of spolia. Theemployment of spolia on reliquaries is a recurrent and privileged means ofclaiming power. Material objects that are already associated with royal andimperial power are reused in order to appropriate that power to the reliquary.On one end of the Trier Andrew reliquary is a Frankish fibula with a gold coinat its centre imprinted with a bust portrait of the emperor Justinian. Thecombination of the two objects makes a double claim to royal support. Similarly,the use of large and precious antique gems also associates the reliquary withroyal prestige – ownership of such gems was almost exclusively regal or, in thecase of a church, testament to a royal or imperial gift.Egbert’s altar is an early example of the manipulation of reliquary forms forliturgical drama and public spectacle, but no reliquary can outdo the complexityof form of Staurotheken – that is, cross reliquaries from the Byzantine East.These are not only nested and enclosed within elaborate forms but, as in thecase of the Limburg Staurothek and others like it, are multipart ‘machines’ thatcan be disassembled, reassembled and explored (like the Demetrios reliquariesmentioned above), all pursuant to the cause of asserting the power of the relicand the devotee’s privilege of access.32 [13_References.xhtml#rch02ref32]The Byzantine cross reliquary in the cathedral treasury of Limburg an der Lahnis one of the most sumptuous and spectacular works of art surviving from theByzantine world and contains a relic of the True Cross – the most coveted of allrelics – as well as other prestigious sacred tokens (illus. 27[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig27]). The gift of the crusader Heinrich von Ulmen to theAugustinian cloister of St Nicholas in Stuben, where his sister was prioress,the reliquary takes the form of a sliding lid tablet made in two different partsat two different times: the cross itself was made by Emperor Constantine VIIPorphyrogennetos and his son Romanus between 945 and 959; the tablet was remadewith ten additional relics between 963 and 985 by the courtier Basil theProedros.The sliding lid reliquary type already existed (see illus. 4[06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig4]), but the Limburg cross exhibits a twist. When oneslides the lid out of place, inside one sees a series of reliquary compartmentswith small doors and a removable cross, slotted into place. The primary relic,the large wooden cross, itself enclosing a number of embedded slivers of theTrue Cross, is in turn encased in precious materials. The surroundingcompartments, guarded by cloisonné enamel images of seraphim, hold prestigiousPassion relics, most likely from the famous Constantinopolitan Palace chapel,the Pharos. Their inclusion in this portable reliquary allows them to actoutside their usual sphere of influence in the Byzantine emperor’s palace. As amobile representation of imperial power, this reliquary may have been used onmilitary campaigns but, undoubtedly, given the ring on the top, could also havebeen carried in processions. The front of the reliquary represents the saintsand angels of the court of Heaven surrounding an enthroned figure of Christ. Theback exhibits a gemmed cross on steps signifying the fecund power of the‘living’ cross. An inscription reads:God stretched out his hands upon the wood, gushing forth through it the energiesof life. Constantine and Romanos the emperors with a frame [Gr. synthesis] ofradiant stones and pearls have displayed it full of wonder. Upon it Christformerly smashed the gates of Hell, giving new life to the dead; And the crownedones who have now adorned it crush with it the temerities of the barbarians.33[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref33]Clearly the cross could, in the right hands, work as a weapon, but in discussingthis inscription the translator draws attention to the ‘frame of radiant stonesand pearls’. The Greek word for frame, synthesis, suggests a transformativeprocess for the relic that transcends mere encirclement. This cross portion ofthe cross reliquary and its inscription insists on imperial powers, the controlof relics, the ‘eternal victory’ so important to Byzantine imperial prestige,and finally, the imperial power to make and create.This last concept, the power of synthesis, takes the reliquary beyondornamentation. The Limburg is not only a reproductive ‘portrait’ of the TrueCross relic, a large piece of which was controlled by the emperors, but alsoreflects a literal ‘making’ of the cross that occurred in Byzantine ceremony,when three separate parts, kept in the palace, had to be actually ‘tied’together. Although the arms of the Limburg cross do not literally come apart,one sees a reflection in the ceremonial tying ritual and its precious ‘ligature’in the (pseudo) pearls at the intersection of the arms of the cross. In otherwords, we are again presented with a Byzantine reliquary that the devotee wasmeant to open and manipulate, only now the manipulation carries the added chargeof reflecting holy ritual. This reliquary was admired and copied after itarrived in Germany and it is not unusual to find cross reliquaries from thethirteenth and fourteenth centuries with similar removable crosses.In contrast to this proclamation of imperial might and power of creation, asecond inscription on the outer, secondary box of the Limburg cross, added inthe later tenth century by a court official named Basil, takes a much morehumble approach.He did not have beauty (Is. 53:2), the one who was hanged on the wood [of thecross] (Deut. 21:22) although Christ surpassed [all] in beauty, (Ps. 44:2), indying he lost his form (Is. 53:2), but still he beautified my face distorted bysin God though he was, he suffered in a human body, eminently venerating him,the proedros Basil beautified the container of the wood.34[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref34]Not only has the proedros Basil ‘beautified’ the relic, he claims that in turnit has beautified him. Through contemplating Christ’s sacrifice, his loss ‘ofform’, the devotee in turn is re-formed without sin into a product of spiritualbeauty. In other words, the beauty of the art object shapes and parallels actsof relic devotion. One could imagine a sort of ‘infectious cycle’ of beauty –beauty lost, given as grace, returned to continue the cycle.If these crosses are reliquary-machines that use their many moving parts toinvite a complex set of interactions via manipulation, another sort of shape,the head reliquary, focuses instead on emotional and interior reaction andinteraction. Each head reliquary forges its own particular relationship to itscommunity. We have discussed how Foi was celebrated by the monks of Conques and,in similar fashion, Candidus was a very important person at Saint-Mauriced’Agaune (illus. 28 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig28]).35[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref35] Throughout the Middle Ages, Saint-Mauriced’Agaune, a monastery sited in the Swiss Alps, was an important stopover on thevoyage to Rome. The monastery was dedicated to Maurice and his ‘Theban legions’(supposedly 6,666 in number), early converts to Christianity who, as Romansoldiers, were martyred for their faith. With a cult originating as early as thefifth century, Maurice had the good fortune to become one of the primary saintscelebrated by kings (and to become the subject of the first documented headreliquary, made by a king of Burgundy, unfortunately no longer surviving).In particular, Maurice received special favour from the Ottonian emperors andtheir heirs: in 926, Henry I collected Maurice’s lance, sword and spurs, whichbecame part of the regalia of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 961 Otto Ipurportedly acquired the body of the saint and some of his companions and set upa shrine at Regensburg for ‘the salvation of the homeland’.36[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref36] From the thirteenth century, remarkably,Maurice is often depicted, in acknowledgment of his Theban origin, as a blackman. (Centuries later, Charles IV, another Holy Roman Emperor, once again showedimperial acquisitiveness and collected relics of Maurice at Agaune, see ChapterThree [08_Chapter03.xhtml].) Maurice, in effect, was the soldier-saint parexcellence, even named as patron saint of several chivalric orders, includingthe Order of the Golden Fleece.Candidus was Maurice’s brother in arms, a captain and standard-bearer of thelegion. As a valiant companion of the soldier-patron of the empire, Candidus wasa key figure at Agaune and became a model for the local counts of Savoy,especially in their pursuit of military glory in the Crusades. In 1148, AmadeusIII, count of Savoy and lay abbot of the monastery, died before reaching theHoly Land. He had borrowed gold from the abbey to finance his participation inthe Second Crusade, and the donation of the head reliquary represents the returnof the ‘pledge’ by Amadeus’s son, Humbert III. (This is not the only instance inwhich a gold covering of a head reliquary was used to finance a soldier for theCrusades and was then replaced after the Crusader returned.)images [images/f0081-01.png]28 Atelier of Saint-Maurice d’Agaune, head reliquary of St Candidus, c. 1165 andlater repairs, silver, gilded silver, gems, wooden core, 57.6 × 23.4 × 22.4 cm,Abbey of Saint-Maurice d’Augane, Switzerland.Crusaders’ families typically benefited for generations from the prestige ofparticipation in the Crusades, and such benefits are often concretized andmemorialized in the form of relic gifts with specific ceremonies, inscriptionsand prayers commemorating the contributions. The gift made to the abbey byAmadeus’s son Humbert consists of a very beautiful head composed of silver andcopper sheets over a precisely carved wooden core; some portions are gilded. Theeyes, like those of Foi, are striking, and worked in niello. The bust, whichstops just below the neck, is elevated through placement on a podium of sortsbearing a depiction in relief of the martyr’s death. From the evidence of theauthentics or relic labels inside, the largest percentage of the assortment ofrelics placed in the head alongside the large piece of a skull are Holy Landrelics, most apparently collected in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Alsodeposited in the reliquary is the only indication of the commemoration of thepatron – a coin of Amadeus III. The relics may have been collected by Amadeus’sfellows or his family and contributed to the project in his honour.Rather than Amadeus’s family, however, the monks must have chosen theinscription, as it makes no mention of the count, referring instead to thesaint’s martyrdom and the simultaneous rising of the soul to heaven, drawing aparallel between the martyr’s death, subsequent rise to ‘the stars’ and Christ’ssacrifice, through its final line, ‘for death life is given’, that insists onthe basic truths of any martyr’s death. The open form of the reliquary base mayindicate that it was used to shelter the Eucharistic elements on the altar likea ciborium, further drawing a parallel between Christ’s sacrifice, the martyr’ssacrifice and the sacrifice of the Mass.Candidus is clearly positioned as a powerful intercessor, but he is also a‘friend’ or confidante as is the case for many head reliquaries. Although helacks the hands and arms of many early personified reliquaries (see illus. 19[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig19]), his eyes are kind and receptive of prayers. He isalso, however, stalwart. In his ‘protection’ of the sacred substances of relicsand Mass, he serves as a valiant defender and protector of the Church, a fittingrole for a martyr who gave his life for his faith, as his fellow soldiers andeven the ‘enemy’ attest in the relief on the front of the reliquary – they allpoint in wonder at the miracle of the ascension of his soul.Adding a commemoration of a leader and soldier in the Crusades to its headreliquary functionality, the head of Candidus incarnates the presence of thesaint. He is both ‘judge and witness’ to the prayers of the faithful; his imageproduces ‘an active, reciprocal relationship’ with his audience, evoking aperson, a face, an individual, and implicating viewers in a shared socialrelation. Above all, the eyes, differentiated from the material of the face,draw and hold the viewer’s attention, eliciting the prayers and promising toforward them to God, binding the devotee to a ‘cosmic order’.37[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref37]A unique group of head reliquaries – once again representing saints not famousfor their individuality but for their collective faith and martyrdom – furtherexpands our understanding of the potential of this reliquary type. In 1155, workon the church of St Ursula in Cologne uncovered the remains of a Roman cemetery.Misunderstandings of an inscription where the number eleven was read as 11,000led to the pious conclusion that bones discovered in the burials (both male andfemale) were to be understood as the remains of the legendary group of 11,000virgins who accompanied the British princess Ursula and her fiancé on apilgrimage to Rome via the Rhine. Her piety was said to be so remarkable that onher return voyage she was accompanied by the pope and other ecclesiastics.Unfortunately, on that return journey, she and her party encountered the Huns.As is typical for a virgin saint, she was a great beauty. When she refused theHunnish king’s offer of marriage, she and all of her companions were slaughteredand buried on the spot. Although she is less celebrated today because of theahistorical nature of the story, Ursula was a very important saint in the lateMiddle Ages, as her cult was spread widely through the dispersal of the manyrelics. (In 1493, Christopher Columbus named the Virgin Islands in her honour ashe sailed past.) This legend and these ‘circumstances’ allowed the church of StUrsula and the city of Cologne an embarrassment of relic riches.images [images/f0084-01.png]29 Cologne artist, head reliquaries of companions of Ursula, mid-13th– 14thcentury, polychromed wood, varying sizes, church of St Ursula, Cologne, Germany.In response to the many relics, beginning in the thirteenth century and wellinto the fifteenth, head reliquaries were produced in Cologne in the hundreds.Perhaps in an economizing mode, the heads were made of polychrome wood ratherthan the usual metal of earlier head reliquaries, but the happy result was thelively end product (illus. 29 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig29]). Adding to theanimation of the busts, the figures gesture (pray) and often smile. Each figure,whether limited to a bust or inclusive of the full torso (illus. 30[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig30]), results in an image of a beautiful young girl withlong, loose blonde hair, and often a white complexion and pink cheeks. Eachreliquary held a skull inside the head and, frequently, a second relic wasincluded in a chest cavity (therefore not entirely visible). Perhaps the mostinteresting aspect of these reliquaries is that the large numbers of examples inthe city of Cologne allowed for their use in vivid processions in the laterMiddle Ages, during which the busts were carried by the daughters of the wealthyburghers of the town, a very effective way to create an alliance between thesaints and the Catholic faithful who would, one presumes, have identified withthe two classes of maidens – mortal and saintly.38[13_References.xhtml#rch02ref38]Even more remarkable, given the luxury of so many relic remains, forms ofdisplay had the potential to multiply. At the main altar of the church we seethe typical arrangement of the high Middle Ages, with shrines displayed behindthe altar on a sort of elevated table (here three shrines), but this issupplemented with two bust reliquaries and even relics embedded in the wallsbehind grilles (illus. 30 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig30]). In the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries, a fashion for working directly with bones (see ChapterFour [09_Chapter04.xhtml]) led the sisters of St Ursula to build the GoldenChamber as a sort of sacristy in which myriad relic busts were stored, and inwhich ‘extra’ bones of saints were used to spell out prayers of intercession onthe upper walls of the chamber.In this last example, we have drifted well past matters of the first millennium,but perhaps the example shows how, in many ways, the celebration of the cult ofsaints was seamless and continuous in certain parts of Europe – although ChapterFour [09_Chapter04.xhtml] will recount rupture and change in other parts.In this chapter we have discussed head reliquaries and a foot shape on areliquary, have briefly mentioned arm reliquaries and purse reliquaries (whichalso often took the shape of metal versions of ‘purses’, closed up tight withwooden cores to seal in relic fragments, but nevertheless believed to be capableof dispensing the bounty of the Church’s ‘heavenly treasure’). Whether bodyparts or not, the many manifestations of different sorts of portable reliquariestestify to a need for the saints to act in the world. As fulfilling relicdoctrine, saints are present both on earth and in heaven, and their presence inthese imaginatively shaped containers is palpable. A metaphor used by St Paul in1 Corinthians 12:12 speaks of saints as members of the Church, quite literally,as part of a ‘body’ of the Church of which Christ is the head. As active limbsthat can implement God’s bidding on earth after the Resurrection, whether armreliquary or not, these are lively relics indeed.This small selection of reliquaries from centuries of production during theearly Middle Ages has, one hopes, provided some idea of the riches produced inhonour of the saints in this era. As the faith congregations required furtherstimulation, however, even richer and more lavish forms were found, and the lateMiddle Ages became an era of unprecedented creativity in the making of ever moreelaborate reliquaries and relic displays. These are the subject of our nextchapter.images [images/f0086-01.png]30 Altar and shrine of St Ursula, 13th–14th century, Cologne, Germany."},{"pageContent":"3RELIQUARIES OF THE LATE MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCEIN THE LATER Middle Ages, relics became ever more powerful tools of politicaland spiritual import. Although Christian relic doctrine itself changed verylittle, the precious scarcity of relics of medieval Europe was altered foreverby a flood of relics from the East, and relic collecting became important forboth religious and ‘secular’ institutions, and even for individuals. Relics wereemployed as defence from the plague, as loot in war and conflict, as focus forpious personal devotion and as a means of consolidating royal and civicpolitical power. The varieties of their use are too numerous even to summarize;instead we will explore a few representative and remarkable instances of relicdisplay and manipulation.The period from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries is a creative one forrelic cult and reliquary design; however, aesthetic advances in the practice ofhousing relics do not neatly correspond with the humanist concerns of theRenaissance usually considered central to the era.In Renaissance Florence, miracles and other signs of faith were not lacking, buttended to centre on paintings rather than reliquaries. Furthermore, twodivergent literary trends in humanist circles – a genre of satires of miracles,and quasi ‘scholarly’ treatises that attempted to document and fortify reliccults and their origins – reveal a Church pushed to defend its positions ratherthan to engage in innovative relic display.1 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref1] Oneremarkable exception occurs, however, in a modification of the now familiar type– the head reliquary.Some might nominate the gemmed and gilded silver head reliquary of St Anthony ofPadua as worthy of such distinction (Giuliano da Firenze, 1434–6). However,despite its very distinctive strategy of preserving the ‘incorrupt’ tongue andjaw and therefore representing Anthony as the ‘mouthpiece’ of the Lord, thereliquary is only formally innovative in that the faceplate (now lost) could belifted up to allow devotees to look inside. Instead, it is the Florentinesculptor Donatello, with his restrained gilded bronze bust of St Rossore (illus.31 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig31]), who redefines the type of the head reliquary forthe Renaissance. Rather than act as intermediary and intercessor with wide‘staring’ eyes, as do many head reliquaries, the remarkably ‘lifelike’ and‘portrait-like’ characterization of the saint models a moment of profound innercontemplation. When Rossore, a third-century soldier saint, was converted whilereading a passage in the Psalms, suddenly his ‘mind was opened’,2[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref2] and Donatello depicts him in that moment, witheyes lowered and brow furrowed. Unlike the usual treatment of head reliquaries,the eyes are not differentiated by material or even engraved detail. Response tothis reliquary requires a very particular kind of reflective and empatheticdevotion; not prayer but ‘soul searching’, not supplication but ‘interiorconversion’ on the part of the viewer.Although I will suggest that a meditative approach is also required by many latemedieval reliquaries, correlating to the rise in private devotion of this era,any further substantial innovation in the contemplative ‘humanist mode’ willawait the period just before and after the Council of Trent (see illus. 56[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig56], 75 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig75]). Instead, inexamining ‘late medieval’ reliquaries of the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries,we will focus on one trend – a developing interest in ‘micro’ architecture, apassion shared by both northern and southern reliquary makers. In doing so, wewill consider how such reliquaries ‘invite’ us to view them, both in terms ofthe creation of sacred space and in provoking meditation. In the second part ofthe chapter we will see a further exploration of architecture, via examinationof actual buildings used to display relics and to serve complex political andcultural ends.images [images/f0090-01.png]31 Donatello, Saint Rossore, c. 1425, gilt bronze, 56 × 60.5 × 37 cm, MuseoNazionale di San Matteo, Pisa, Italy.In its articulation of ‘aspiration’, in its soaring, open, light-filled spaces,the Gothic is an architectural system perfectly suited to the recreation of thesacred spaces of the Heavenly Jerusalem and the display of ‘fragments’ of thedivine, that is, collections of relics. The scalable power of the relic isappropriately reflected in these two extremes of architecture – micro and macro– as each presents its own possibility for the experience of sacred space.Whether focusing and guiding the attention of the devotee with wondrousminiature buildings and elaborate ‘scenic’ reliquaries, or allowing the devoteeto enter a marvellous simulation of heaven (in the magic enclosure of a chapelor the miraculous spaces of a cathedral), Gothic architecture possesses uniquepotential to amplify and explore the experience of relics.‘THOSE WHO HAVE A TASTE FOR BUILDING’ (QUODVULTDEUS)3[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref3]As we have seen, the Ark of the Covenant and the Tabernacle serve as structuraltemplates for reliquaries and as fundamental prototypes for all Christian sacredcontainers, even, according to the thirteenth-century liturgical commentatorDurandus of Mende (Guillaume Durand), the model for any container for theEucharist. It should come as no surprise that in reliquaries of the later MiddleAges and early Renaissance, sacred architectural order, measure, its materialrealization and indeed an expanded conception of sacred space should emerge asthe heart of relic display. Medieval exegetes took the biblical directives forthe construction of Ark and Tabernacle as instruction for spiritual exercise,seeing in the doubled significance of ‘edification’ a directive for bothbuilding and moral improvement. Thus, as we think of how structures ofreliquaries intersect with the architecture of full-scale buildings, we shouldbe reminded that both also intersect with spiritual exercises, especially thoseof ‘private devotion’. With earlier medieval reliquaries, we explored thescalability of relic power as expressed through nesting. That strategy continueshere through an approach to architecture based on biblical precedent – theTabernacle enclosing the Ark, the Temple replacing the Tabernacle and both asthe site of the divine.In this I am referring, of course, to the Old Testament Tabernacle, butcontemporary tabernacles – that is, display pieces for the host, often calledmonstrances – are of interest as well. In the late medieval period, lines wereblurred between the sacred matter of relics and the sacred matter of the CorpusChristi (the Eucharistic wafer or host as the body of Christ). The host wasalready used as a ‘relic’ in consecrating altars as early as the fourth century,and with the advent and growth of the Corpus Christi feast and veneration afterthe thirteenth century, there is little significant theological differentiationamong various sorts of sacred matter. In 1365 the Carmelite Friars of Siena evencalled the host the ‘chief and lord of all the other relics’.4[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref4]From the early Middle Ages, reliquaries were inspired by ecclesiasticalarchitecture; shrines and monstrances of the later Middle Ages became even moreelaborately and precisely architectural (see illus. 1[05_Introduction.xhtml#fig1]). Labelled ‘micro-architecture’, they have beenthought to be generated through procedures of architectural design (using theso-called ‘mason’s secrets’). It has even been claimed that they were used toelaborate and test architectural designs in quasi-experimental fashion in orderto realize both architectural aspirations and fantasies. By no means denyingsuch creativity to the reliquary designer, I would, however, suggest a quitedifferent understanding of these forms. Rather than serve as a proving groundfor architectural innovation, the reliquary shared an aesthetic with monumentalarchitecture in order to advance a set of complex ideas about sacred space –especially ideas concerning the location of sacred space or, perhaps morespecifically, its relocation and renewal.The relocation of the sacred, especially the relocation of the Holy Land toEurope via architectural copies of the Holy Sepulchre, was an ongoing andpersistent project of medieval building. An alternative approach toaccomplishing the same goal, more prevalent in the late Middle Ages, was tocreate a simulacrum of the Heavenly Jerusalem through the new architecture ofthe Gothic, and to sanctify it through the presence of the Holy Land orApostolic relics. An added value of this approach is that when features of thisGothic architecture became recognizable as local – that is, identifiable as aregional or national style – they help to effectively relocate the sacred,arguing that ‘the holy’ has taken up residence ‘here, now’, in France, in Italy,in Bohemia. Such regionally marked, demonstrative, even tendentious sacralarchitectural styles, displayed in the coinciding forms of reliquaries and localecclesiastical architecture, occurs in examples from Florence, Paris, Orvietoand especially Prague.5 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref5]The correspondences between Florence’s most famous architectural feature – theDome of the cathedral – and its precious reliquary of the Apostle Philip’s arm(now in the treasury) have already been noted.6 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref6]In particular the details at the base of the reliquary ‘dome’ correspond tofeatures of the lantern of the Duomo.Such architectural correspondences occurred at an earlier moment in Paris whenthe French Crusader king, Louis IX, built the Sainte-Chapelle to house relicsfrom the Holy Land, especially the Crown of Thorns and, in so doing, made claimto a distinctive French and Parisian style of architecture which he also used inhis reliquaries. Unfortunately, most of Louis’ sacral treasure disappearedduring the French revolution, but some evidence survives. Among the manyreliquaries produced under Louis, the Thorn reliquary from Saint-Pierre de Lille(known only from an eighteenth-century drawing, illus. 32[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig32]) stands out for having a number of elements thatreiterate the architecture of the Sainte-Chapelle. The form of the buttressing,the high, elaborately crocketed spire, the double arched windows topped withfleurs-de-lis and the parapet pierced with quatrefoils along the roofline allrecall the royal chapel (illus. 33 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig33]). Even one of themost powerful aspects of the relic presentation at the Sainte-Chapelle, theconceit of the nesting reliquary writ large – as seen in the display ofreliquaries within the Grande Chasse (see illus. 44 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig44])and within the ‘architectural’ reliquary of the Sainte-Chapelle itself – wasalso copied in this lost piece. We can see the thorn is presented in a miniaturearchitectural shrine within another ‘church’, the whole succinctly recalling theprestigious site of the Crown of Thorns.7 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref7]images [images/f0094-01.png]32 Thorn reliquary, possibly 13th century, Saint-Pierre de Lille (no longerextant), reproduced from Aubin Louis Millin, Antiquités nationales; ou, Recueilde monuments . . . (1790).An even more intriguing case can be made concerning the Reliquary of theCorporal (1337), a beautiful shrine in gold and transparent enamel for a relicmoved by Pope Urban IV to Orvieto, his home town. In that example, architecturaldetails that correlate to the designs of the cathedral – which were not yetcompleted – ‘represent’ an architectural civic identity still in its planningstages.8 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref8] In that the frame of the reliquary isso clearly based on Orvietan architecture, it makes an argument that themiraculous corporal (a cloth used during the Mass, this one stained with bloodfrom a miraculously bleeding host), properly belongs in Orvieto, rather than innearby Bolsena, where the miracle took place.images [images/f0095-01.png]33 Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, exterior north, 1239–48, built by Louis IX.images [images/f0096-01.png]34 Tabernacle, St Vitus Cathedral, Prague, c. 1375, gilded iron, h. 208 cm.A last example, a host tabernacle from St Vitus Cathedral in Prague, again useselements of the distinctive local architecture in striking fashion (illus. 34[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig34]). The tabernacle reiterates the broad windows andornate tracery of its cathedral as well as the detailing of the spires and theirdecorative crockets, a micro reflection of its macro environment (illus. 35[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig35]). As we will see, the emperor Charles IV aggressivelycollected and relocated relics to his new imperial capital and, in a massiveprogramme of reliquary manufacture that includes this Tabernacle, he marked the‘sacred territory’ of his new acquisitions with the distinctive architecture ofhis cathedral. Furthermore, the emperor commissioned reliquaries as gifts forthe Palatine Chapel at Aachen and used the same distinctive architecturalelements, thereby transporting the densely significant forms to another locationwhere Charles claimed dominion as emperor.images [images/f0097-01.png]35 Peter Parler and others, St Vitus Cathedral, Prague, exterior, 1344–99 to19th century.In each of these cases, the citation of architectural form is the bearer ofmeaning. Architectural features in reliquaries have more to say than ‘Church’:they say which church and why, and they make important claims to particular andlocal varieties of spatial sanctity. Such citations surely continue into theRenaissance in Florence, as noted above in the case of the Duomo, and in themany citations of Bramante’s Tempietto in the form of a tabernacle or ciborium,a form that we will see becomes especially significant in Spain. Thus thearchitectural design of reliquaries beginning with the late medieval periodactively justified and normalized the massive relic relocation projects thatcharacterized the era.ARCHITECTURAL RELIQUARIES AND MEDITATIONAL DUCTUSIn addition to marking space as holy and heavenly, architecture can communicateinstructions for reflection and meditation. This notion has roots that go deepinto Jewish and Christian practices of the contemplation of the very act ofbuilding, through the construction of the Temple. Supplementing the buildingplans in the text of Exodus, the visionary text of Ezekiel exhorts (43:10–11):Thou son of man, show the temple to the house of Israel, that they may beashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern, and blush fromall they have done. Show them the plan of the house, and of its fabric, itsexits and entrances, and its whole description, and all of its precepts, and therest of its ordering, and all its laws, and write [them] before their sight sothat they may store away all its descriptions and precepts, and fashion them.This text introduces many possibilities vis-à-vis the study of architecture –measuring, mentally entering and exiting, understanding order, perhaps evenremaking – but most importantly, the text sets such architectural studies withinthe moral context of a confession of sin in the face of divine perfection:In Ezekiel, the measuring of the Temple is an act of contrition and return . . .the construction measurements . . . given on the mountain by God to Moses[constitute] the central act of covenant . . . in the Tabernacle, [and] later .. . the Temple built by Solomon . . . [and] In its final avatar, as the HeavenlyCity of John.9 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref9]The potential of the biblical text for Christian thought is immense. In thecontext of the textual directive ‘to measure the fabric [of the Temple] means tothink carefully upon the life of the just’,10 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref10]the Temple represents both a covenant and a set of nested spaces and ideas, acognitive map that functions at the personal, liturgical, but also the civiclevel, in the latter case to ‘reconcile an entire community with God’. One candescribe the process with a particular word derived from rhetoric – a ductus, aword that directs us to the concept of flow, the ‘movement within and through awork’s various parts’ . . . but also ‘the conduct of a thinking mind on its waythrough a composition’. In other words, movement, both abstract and physical,becomes a key aspect of architectural reception.For the most part, diagrams illustrating exegeses of this text (bytwelfth-century scholars Hugh and Richard of Saint Victor and Adam of Dryburgh)are static, but the ‘place of the Tabernacle’ in exegetical tradition was not.It ‘requir[ed] movement through and within its structure, as though within amaterial building’.11 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref11] Some diagrams accommodatethat need for movement, encouraging a sort of walking about in the mind, butmore significantly, such use of architecture to guide meditation relies on theimportance to medieval thought of memory systems, systems using architecturalspaces to create an armature for structured memory.It should come as no surprise that in a 1523 publication of the Ars memorativa,a certain learned Laurent Fries from Alsace created an itinerary throughStrasbourg Cathedral, especially its altars, the choir screen and twostaircases, each serving as memory loci.12 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref12]Reliquaries, of course, provide the distinct possibility of such a mentalitinerary on a smaller scale; architectural reliquaries even call out for a sortof mental peregrination, or exploration – creating a ductus that leads usthrough both a physical and imaginary landscape where relics can be venerated inturn.It should be recognized that architectural reliquaries represent a mixing ofobject types. Reliquaries, tabernacles and monstrances share forms, and evenex-votos overlap with these categories in terms of design. A large number ofvotive offerings made at shrines represented buildings, and even whole cities.Most of these do not survive, but documented examples included a votive offering‘model city’ from 1247 Parma that was credited with saving the city fromdestruction by Frederick II; a fifteenth-century votive city given by Louis XIto Saint-Denis representing his grant to the abbey of the city of La Guerche;votive model cities from Bourges and Amiens (the latter once hung in thecathedral of Amiens); and many city images that were donated to both the Virginof Loreto (eighteen by 1530 and many others in succeeding centuries, includingone of Fermo weighing 8 kg/18 lb) and to the Virgin of Liesse. Aseventeenth-century votive offering from Gemona del Friuli is a rare survivor ofthis class of objects; it includes models of two churches, the city walls and atown hall. It was a plea for salvation from the plague – and shows St Roch andSt George standing on the roof of the hall (reminiscent perhaps of Michaeldefending Rome from the plague atop the Castel Sant’Angelo in Rome).13[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref13]But such images of cities in metalwork were not always simply votive offerings.The example surviving in Soissons, from the end of the sixteenth century (datedby details of the construction of the church of St Leger completed in 1567–96,gilded copper with silver, illus. 36 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig36]),14[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref14] has previously been identified as a votiveoffering, but is now recognized as a reliquary made to house relics rescuedafter an attack on the city by Huguenots. The relics are enumerated in aninventory of 1770 and a letter preserved in the city archives notes that theywere placed in the church towers of the model. Although eight churches aredepicted, there are no civic buildings.images [images/f0101-01.png]36 Reliquary of the city of Soissons (Trésor de la cathédraleSaint-Gervais-Saint-Protais), end of 16th century, gilded copper, moulded andplate, wood, silver and gems, 34 × 75 × 44 cm, Musée Municipal de Soissons,France.The same eight churches are featured on a surviving Renaissance map of Soissons,which shows that the architecture of the model was generally accurate,especially in terms of the orientation and general position of the buildings.One notable change from reality was that, in the reliquary, the miniaturecathedral was given a second tall tower, never actually constructed. The modelcathedral is further emphasized by its movable doors and silver added on itsroof and facade.How was the viewer to navigate this strange but wonderful object? Following ourdiscussion above considering meditation upon the Temple, and as suggested by themap, an imaginative visit to each of the sacred locations within the city, witha pause for prayer and contrition at each, would have been appropriate. ‘Goingin and out’ and ‘measuring the spaces’ might have been part of the practice. Itwas not unusual at this time for a city to serve as a double for Jerusalem inprayers,15 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref15] and a visual assessment of thebeauty of the city would also not have been without merit. The verse fromPsalms, ‘Lord I have loved the beauty of thy house’ (Psalms 26:8) was not onlytaken as a directive to decorate the house of the Lord but also a command, asAugustine noted, to wonder at the ‘admirable tabernacle’. A kind of aestheticismas devotion informed architectural reliquary design.16[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref16]As one wandered within this architectural field, presented with a metaphoricalbouquet of beautiful flowers in the shape of the houses of the saints, one wasallowed free rein within the constraints of the walls, presumably on a sort ofitinerary culminating in the cathedral, the only building supplied both withdoors as well as a cabochon rock crystal and, presumably, stocked with visiblerelics. In contemplating this most ornate of buildings, one concluded theitinerary with thoughts of salvation – the city reliquary was once embellishedwith a large image of Mary apparently attached to the roof of the abbey of NotreDame (which seems to have had an inscription with an enumeration of the relics).So should this object be classed as an ex-voto or a reliquary? I would suggestit was both, and that perhaps some of the lost comparative examples functionedas both as well.The tabernacle, again from the town of St Gemona in Friuli, made by NicolòLionello in 1435 (illus. 37 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig37]), takes a differentapproach to the presentation of sacred space but even more emphatically invitesthe viewer to wander or ‘walk about’ using their imagination.17[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref17] In this case, the upper part of a towermonstrance is covered with what might be called tabernacolini, to borrow a termfrom the Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari. In the introduction to his1550 Lives of the Artists, the Italian railed against such constructions,although there he is speaking of what he called ‘German’ buildings of stone:images [images/f0103-01.png]37 Nicolò Lionello, tabernacle, Gemona del Friuli Cathedral, Italy, 1435, silvergilt and enamel, 61.8 × 17.3 cm.And so for the facades and all their ornament they made a damnation oftabernacolini, one above the other, with so many pyramids and spikes and leavesthat they could not possibly be supported often they put these things one overthe other, coming to such a height that the tip of the portal touched theroof.18 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref18]Instead of Vasari’s cursed tabernacolini, the little structures on themonstrance are intended as a force for good. One’s eye is overwhelmed, as Vasarisays, but one is also intrigued to climb the hill and the tiny stairs, moving inand out of the little spaces that are akin to monastic cells dotting a hillside,some still with minuscule figures – possibly hermits? – populating their spaces.As Augustine writes in his sermon on Psalm 41 (here much condensed, and shiftingfrom first to third, to second person as in the original but serving as ourguide to the itinerary):‘I will enter into the place of the Tabernacle’ . . . I will first blunder aboutoutside . . . ‘For I will enter into the place of the admirable Tabernacle, evento the house of God’ . . . and now I look with wonder at many things in theTabernacle. Faithful men [saints] are the Tabernacle of God on earth . . .having heard a sort of interior music . . . removing himself [the Psalmist] fromall the noise of body and blood, he made his way up to the house of God. Forthus he remembers his way and his ductus, as though we had said to him, you aregazing upon the Tabernacle in this world; how have you come to the hidden placeof God’s house.19 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref19]The verbs here are ‘walk’, ‘gaze upon’, ‘look’, ‘go’ and ‘ascend’. But more thansuggestive of random movement, the passage replaces wandering with purposefulwalking, noise with harmony. Furthermore, glancing about is ultimatelysuperseded by a meditative gaze.Augustine’s commentary on the Psalms, a foundational text for the Christiantradition, encourages an approach to architectural reliquaries. In looking uponLionello’s monstrance, we might linger upon the details of the tabernacolini orthe tiny stairs, preparing ourselves for the viewing of the host through therock crystal (the lunula or holder for the host is just visible behind thecrystal). Augustine insisted that audiences choose their own way in practising‘architectural’ meditation. The possibilities presented by this marvellous pieceare not an anti-classical confusion (pace Vasari) but an invitation to wander,wonder and find one’s way.Although late medieval reliquaries present many other wondrous and imaginativevisions, architecture remains prominent even in the most complex creations – thejoyaux of the French court (and also the custodia of the Spanish where KingPhilip II was known to practise such mental wandering and climbing in responseto a model of Jerusalem).Although a majority of viewers may not have had the opportunity to linger in theintimate presence of reliquaries and monstrances, the private patrons whocommissioned the Paris masterpieces of gold, gems and enamel, the joyaux sofashionable around 1400, intended them for close looking. Christine de Pizantells of the French king, Charles V, retreating after his afternoon nap to bewith ‘most privy friends taking delight in pleasant things, examining joyaux orother rich works . . . in order that the cares of too great occupation shouldnot impair the feeling of his health’. In his study, he took the counsel ofspecialists on the matter: ‘he had those appraise who were skilled in knowledgeof such things [cognoisseurs de telz choses] of whom there were some in hishousehold’, and had a fuller ‘knowledge of such things’.20[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref20] It should be emphasized that Charles occupiedhimself in this way to improve his well-being and that the etymology of theFrench word for these objects, joyaux, derives from joy (Lat. gaudium, orgaudere, rejoice).images [images/f0106-01.png]38 Unknown court goldsmith, Paris, Holy Thorn reliquary, made for Jean de Berry,c. 1397, gold and ronde-bosse enamel, sapphires, pearls, rubies and rockcrystal, 30.5 × 15 (max. w.) × 13 (base w.) × 7 cm, British Museum, London.Although Charles died in 1380 and thus would never have seen the small reliquaryof the Thorn (now at the British Museum, illus. 38 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig38])made around 1400 for his brother Jean, Duc de Berry (himself a connoisseur ofsuch things), we can be certain that Charles had the opportunity to encounterobjects very like it. We can imagine the viewer standing before the centralfigure of the judging Christ, meditating on the gorgeously presented thorn ofthe Christ’s Crown that occupies the space between God and the viewer,imaginatively joining the Apostles, praying along with the courtly saints andangels, celebrating the joy of the resurrection as it is depicted withtriumphantly trumpeting angels – in effect, taking up residence inside thesacred space of the garden walls of the paradise of the Heavenly Jerusalem thatsupport the vision.Or we may turn to a joyaux made for Charles’ son Charles VI, given to him as anétrenne, a New Year’s gift, by his wife Isabeau de Baviere in 1405 (illus. 39[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig39], see also illus. 2 [05_Introduction.xhtml#fig2]). Itwas soon in the possession of Isabeau’s brother and travelled to Ingolstadt andwas finally given as an ex-voto in 1509 to the pilgrimage church of Mary atAltötting where it remains today, holding a relic of the Mantel of the Virgin.21[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref21] The architectural features of this piece areessential in creating a sense of sacred space. One must imagine the king joininghis tiny simulacrum, imaginatively inserting himself into this space before theVirgin Mary. First he descends from the little horse, the goldenes Rössl thatgives its name to the piece, and, while the squire holds the horse for him, hepasses from the lower church-like space and climbs the stairs to the Virgin’sbower.22 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref22]Stairs as a means of ascent occur as a frequent trope in meditation and in thesearchitectural fantasies. In On Christian Doctrine, Augustine specifies the stepsone must ascend to find God – the first is fear of God, the second piety, thethird knowledge, the fourth strength, the fifth mercy and on the sixth step thedevotee ‘cleanses that eye by which God may be seen’ insofar as it is possiblein the world. Finally, the seventh step is wisdom. Augustine cautions, however:‘in this world we make our pilgrimage, although we have our conversation inheaven’.23 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref23]images [images/f0108-01.png]39 Unknown court goldsmith, Paris, Goldenes Rössl, made for Isabeau de Bavièreas a gift for Charles VI, 1404, gold, ronde-bosse enamel, pearls, sapphires andrubies, h. 62 cm, Wallfahrstmuseum, Altötting, Bavaria, Germany.Charles, in the form of his tiny enamel doppelgänger, has already climbed themany steps to the first stage, but also completed the ascent of the seven thatgive access to the upper platform. He now may have his conversation, kneeling onan exquisite cushion before an altar-like lectern. The Virgin herself resides ina slightly separate space, enclosed by the most minimal of walls – a gesturetowards the trope of the virgin as an enclosed garden – here carpeted withemerald-green grass. As a polite guest, Charles brings a gift, a crowned helmetpresented by his companion, a soldier courtier at the Virgin’s left. Charlesreads/speaks/prays from a silver book of devotion open before him. Mary respondswith her hand resting on her own silver book, supported on a wonderfully minutetabernacle/lectern with exquisite gothic ‘micro’ architectural details (seeillus. 2 [05_Introduction.xhtml#fig2], partially visible, lower right). WithinMary’s enclosure are the sacrificial lamb and the chalice of the Eucharist;however, the space is transformed from something formal and ecclesiastical, fromthe holy of holies, attended by angels/cherubim and populated by the sacrificialbody of Christ, to the space within ‘the admirable tabernacle’, the privatespace achieved by the ductus and personal choices of meditation. The Virginherself is in an informal mode; her cousin’s child John the Baptist brings thelamb almost as a pet. Baby John the Evangelist joins in offering flowers and thecup as if at a tea party. And behind John, little St Catherine reaches for thering the baby Jesus hands to her (and given that Charles and Isabeau had afour-year-old daughter Catherine at the time it all seems very like a familygathering). Lucky for Charles, as immortalized in this ex-voto, he will neverdescend from this heavenly bliss to where the little pony patiently waits.Such an ex-voto, where the votive function is combined with that of thereliquary, blurs distinctions that are further obscured in late Renaissance andBaroque environments. Counter to our modern desire to categorize and name, themission of these artworks seems to be multivalent as artists sought maximumdrama in the realization of a simulacrum of Paradise. Relics become part of thesupporting cast for the Corpus Christi and ex-votos are testimony to thevenerability and glory of any given individual church.Thus architecture in reliquaries and monstrances is neither merely decorativenor only representative of experiments in ‘microarchitecture’; rather, it isconstructed of details that claim spiritual space for the here and now, for thiscity, for this place. It may serve as practice for the architect, for theartisan, for the theologian, but also for any penitent ready to ‘build’. It isthe architecture of the biblical past, the architecture of the Gothic mason andbuilder, but also, as we will see in Chapter Four [09_Chapter04.xhtml], it willbe the new architecture of the humanist. It is a plan and an order thatstructures devotion; a beauty that shows the glory of God; a window, a door, aportal, an atrium, an oculus that can lead to the divine.ARCHITECTURE AND ARCHITECTURAL RELIQUARIES FOR RELIC COLLECTIONS (THE COURT OFHEAVEN)If Gothic architectural and scenic reliquaries create a space for venerationthat imaginatively expands the power of the tiny relic fragments they display,it is no surprise that, writ large, some of the same forms are put into play tohouse the great relic collections that came to be accumulated during the courseof the late Middle Ages. Gothic architecture is eminently scalable, and allowsthe expansion of the ‘space’ of the relic to monumental, glorious proportions.Here we turn from a look at individual reliquaries to a consideration of thegreat relic collections of the late Middle Ages in Europe, housed in some of themost beautiful architectural environments that could be imagined, by supremelytalented architects, each one aspiring to a recreation of the HeavenlyJerusalem.CONSTANTINOPLETo understand the wave of medieval relic collecting that is the motivation forthese structures, however, we must first step back to an earlier moment andexamine the precedent set by the renowned collections in the capital of theEastern Christian empire, Constantinople.Throughout much of the Middle Ages, that city was considered the ultimatetreasure deposit of material sanctity. Beginning with Constantine himself,celebrated as the first Christian emperor and founder of the city, rulersstocked it with saints’ relics from every corner of the empire. With only a fewlocal saints at the start (three by one count), what began as the tiny town ofByzantion on the strategically significant peninsula between Europe and Asia,through a series of acquisitions of ever more significant relics, was turnedinto an incomparable Christian capital.The first major cache of relics was deposited in a monumental porphyry column inthe new centre of the city, the Forum of Constantine, which was also the site ofthe city’s dedication in 330. At the apex of the column, Constantine placed agolden statue of Apollo (which was frequently mistaken for a portrait of theemperor himself and was later replaced with a cross) and at its base, he buriedthe relics. These are reputed in legend to have ranged from a bronze image ofPallas Athena, the ‘Palladium’ said to be the guarantor of the safety of thecity of Rome, to a fragment of the True Cross, given to the emperor by hismother Helena.Later, substantial Christian relic importations were implemented in concert withthe emperor’s more grandiose building schemes, especially that of the church ofthe Holy Apostles. For this church, in which it has been said that the emperorintended to be buried as the ‘thirteenth Apostle’, Constantius, his son,presumably following his father’s plan, imported the bodies of the ApostlesTimothy, Andrew and Luke between 356 and 357. Paulinus of Nola approved, callingthese relics ‘towers’ in the defence of the city.24[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref24]In contrast to this theme of relics as protection of the city, a somewhatdifferent motivation was presented by Robert the Monk. Chronicling the FirstCrusade in the early twelfth century, he asserted that the relics ofConstantinople were brought to the city from across Asia and Africa for theirown protection (presumably from Islamic depredation). We will see the same themeof relic collection as protection of relics during the Counter-Reformation, butthis can only be a belated justification in the case of imperial Constantinople.Clearly pursuing an aggressive programme of relic acquisition, the emperorsbegan by ‘requesting’ bodies in order to build a centre of power, a request fewchurches and monasteries could resist. Significant acquisitions by successiveemperors included the arms of John the Baptist and Stephen, and many, manyMarian relics.Although some of the most famous relics were kept in the monasteries of thecapital, the superlative collections resided in Hagia Sophia – the ‘cathedral’of Constantinople – and in the chapels of the imperial palace, especially thatof the Virgin of the Pharos. Our best lists of the relics come from pilgrimaccounts, but in a self-promoting speech about the ‘Palace Revolution of JohnKomnenos’ in 1200, the skeuophylax or sacristan of the Pharos, NicolasMesarites, describes his own vigorous defence of the Pharos chapel during ashort-lived uprising. Mesarites lists ten precious relics, grandiloquentlycomparing them to the Ten Commandments, in effect likening the chapel and itscollection of relics to the Ark of the Covenant and the Sancta Sanctorum, theholy of holies of the Bible.25 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref25]His list focuses on Passion relics, beginning with the Crown of Thorns, greenand ‘immortal’ through contact with the head of Christ, which he argues refutesdisbelieving Jews through its miracle of preservation. Next is the nail that is‘free of rust’ due to the purity of Christ’s flesh, and relics three to fivetestify to the incarnation and deeds of Christ. Other relics are the lance, thepurple cloak of mockery and the stone from the tomb of Christ, which Mesaritescompares to the second stone of Jacob and calls a cornerstone. Finally Mesaritesconcludes that, in addition to these relics as ‘commandments’ in the chapel, onehas ‘the lawgiver himself before one’s eyes’ in the form of two acheiropoieta(images made miraculously ‘without hands’, that is, without the intervention ofan artist): a cloth and a tile imprinted with Christ’s face. Mesarites calls thespace of the chapel the ‘second Sinai, a new Bethlehem, a second Jordan, a newJerusalem, Nazareth, Bethany, Galilee, Tiberias’.26[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref26] He concludes, directly addressing the viewer,with a narrative weaving the relics together into an evocation of Christ’s lifeand Passion, imagining the events of the Gospel recurring in the chapel itself.Travellers’ accounts mention even more relics in the chapel, filling out thelist of Passion relics, and also telling of saints ‘without number’.In contrast to the relics of the palace, the relics in Hagia Sophia were morepublicly displayed, and at least on some occasions available for devotionoutside the treasury. They include, again, many dominical relics including theswaddling clothes, the gold of the Magi and relics that duplicate those in thepalace such as the True Cross and blood of Christ. The treasury also containedmany relics of saints and objects such as the writing stool of St John. Votivecrowns given by the emperors, including one from Emperor Constantine, hung inprofusion over the great altar of the church. Other unique relics at HagiaSophia included the gilded cross made to the ‘measure’ of Christ by the entranceof the treasury, a miraculous icon of Christ, a stone from Jacob’s well on whichChrist sat, three doors made from wood from Noah’s ark, and the gilt silvercross made by Constantine to match the visionary cross of the Battle of theMilvian Bridge.A significant number of relics in the palace are related to Christ; others areOld Testament relics – the horn that anointed David, the rod of Moses and thetrumpet Joshua blew at Jericho. Rather than participate in a liturgy or praybefore invisible enclosed sacred substance, as is so often the case with Westernrelics, these relics (although certainly not without reliquaries) were onprominent display. As ‘commandments’, their sight demanded action, devotion andimaginative response. Perhaps, as prompted by these objects, the visitor was toact in the manner of the early Jerusalem pilgrims and vividly imagine thebiblical and hagiographic stories that were suggested by relics. The experiencethat was once unique to the Holy Land was recreated and relocated in theByzantine capital.Of these holy relics and sacred environments, the renown of which madeConstantinople so impressive, only the base of the column survives – the HolyApostles church was replaced by the Faith Mosque in the fifteenth century, andthe relics of the Pharos and Hagia Sophia were dispersed for the most part afterthe Crusader Sack of 1204, with the remainder disappearing with the Turkishconquest. Nevertheless, the memory of these collections in Constantinople playsan important role in the Western re-imagining of relic collections after theCrusades. The massive imperial acquisition of relics succeded in transformingConstantinople into the ‘new Jerusalem’. For aspiring relic collectors the cityprovided an enduring model of the potential of constructed sacred space,activated by means of relocated relics.Thus, one of the outcomes of the Fourth Crusade, the capture and looting ofConstantinople and the subsequent redistribution of relics from East to West,was a new, focused politicization of the act of collecting relics, as well as aconcentration on relics associated with Christ and the Passion. Indeed, anescalating competition of relics and relic collections was decisively set intomotion.In the following pages, we will briefly discuss the Lateran chapel of the SanctaSanctorum chapel in Rome, the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, and spend a bit moretime on the collection outside Prague at Karlštejn, forged by the Holy RomanEmperor Charles IV.PASSION RELICSRelics of Christ should, by all logic, be exceedingly rare, given that Christ’sbody ascended whole, leaving nothing behind.27 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref27]However, objects that touched Christ and Mary and participated in their storiescould help recreate those stories in the imagination – which is, after all, thepurpose of devotional meditation and, as we have seen, the function of manyrelics. Of course, other relics were said to have been ‘shed’ in some sense fromChrist’s body, the most important being: the umbilical cord from the birth; theholy foreskin, removed during the Circumcision; and blood shed during thePassion. There is also, of course, the blood that has appeared on various hostsduring Eucharistic miracles (theologically denied proper relic status).28[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref28] As to relics associated with the Virgin, therewas an abundance of cloths, hair and milk. All of these relics have provedcontroversial, in particular the foreskin, but that has not diminished interestin them even today – not long ago Slate magazine published a rather sensationalarticle on that sacred body part.29 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref29]The Passion relics, even if some were already considered uniquely important inthe early Middle Ages, became an even more compelling focus of attention in thelater Middle Ages as instruments for private devotion. In an array that recallsthe heraldic arms of knights or kings, symbolic images are isolated and gatheredin the so-called arma Christi. But here the word ‘arms’ can also mean weapon,and many of these symbols represent the weapons used to torment Christ,preserved as relics and paradoxically converted to Christ’s own ‘weapons’ offaith. Ultimately, however, in another transformation, they become objects ofgreat comfort to devout Christians. Because they not only came into contact withChrist’s body and were often held to be stained with Christ’s blood, the nails,the cross, the Crown of Thorns, the lance and the various holy cloths allvividly attest to his suffering.Devotions to the Passion often considered the arma Christi individually in amulti-part prayer that proceeded one by one through a list of relics, eachlabelled and identified. Byzantine artists seem to have paved the way for suchdevotions with ‘tablet’ reliquaries that displayed relic arrays clearly and thatcame to the West during and after the Crusades (see illus. 27[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig27]). One such Eastern reliquary appropriated by theFrench royal family was called the ‘Tutor’ of Philip Augustus, a title thatimplies that the now lost tablet reliquary acted almost like a primer, and thateach relic was like a letter in the assemblage that came together to form words,sentences, thoughts and finally completed ideas and prayers (which may give ussome idea of the intended mental structure of these devotions which were alsocommon to many manuscript illuminations of the arma Christi).The reliquaries the French king Charles V made for his brothers around 1360–70,one of which survives in Florence, the Libretto (little book), follow this sameapproach and therefore also attest to the king’s own piety. Such devotionsremained popular even after the Middle Ages. In the sixteenth century, Philip IIof Spain was said to pore over reliquaries, ‘learning them’ in a way thatrecalls just such a primer.These sorts of assembled reliquaries, whether Byzantine or newly made Westernversions, were sometimes dubbed a ‘New Jerusalem’, again speaking to theeffectiveness of the relocation of Passion relics. Following directly from aCrusade-inspired interest in the Holy Land, this approach to relics and theirdisplay and veneration testifies to a desire for a renewed experience of thelife of Christ in the late Middle Ages and prepares the ground for thecollections we will discuss.THE SANCTA SANCTORUM AND ROMEIn the eleventh century, the Descriptio Lateranensis ecclesiae praised theprivate chapel of the popes in the Lateran Palace as the most important sacredspace in Rome; by the thirteenth century the chapel was called the SanctaSanctorum in emulation of the biblical Temple (illus. 40[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig40]).30 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref30] The referencemay have been to the Ark-like cedar chest, constructed by Pope Leo III, thatrested under the altar, but soon the appellation was extended to the entirechapel. Relic lists in the Descriptio, a pilgrim’s guide, noted many elementspurportedly from the Holy Land and included others that filled out the narrativeof Christ’s life and the Passion with touching physical specificity: bread aswell as thirteen lentils from the Last Supper; bits of Passion relics such asthe sponge, the lance and the True Cross, as well as a series of stones ‘of Marywhere she stopped [the Kathisma, see illus. 6 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig6]], of theJordan where the Lord sat when he was baptized, of Bethlehem, of the Mount ofOlives where the Lord prayed to his father, of where the angel sat at theSepulchre, of the column where Christ was whipped’, and ‘of the Sepulchre’, andfinally ‘of the wood of the crib’ (not listed is the ‘loot’ from the Temple:Aaron’s rod, the seven-branched candlestick, the altar of incense, the jar ofmanna and the shew-bread table which were often also said to be in the altar).images [images/f0117-01.png]40 View of the altar with the Acheropita, Sancta Sanctorum, Lateran Palace,Rome.A pilgrim thinking of these relics makes what could be called a mental Holy Landitinerary. Indeed, some of the stones described might be the very ones now inthe little box that was retrieved from the altar and which originally came intobeing as a souvenir or blessing from the Holy Land (see illus. 4[06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig4]). But perhaps the most important and renowned relic inthe chapel was the image of the Saviour, said to be painted by Luke, theAcheropita (a distortion of the Greek word acheiropoieton, given thisappellation because the icon was reputed to have been finished by an angel).Only the golden reliquary of the True Cross, which was said in the eleventhcentury to hold a relic of the foreskin, had equal status among the Laterantreasures.The icon was considered to be the true face of Christ and it was the focus of aseries of rituals centred in the private (and tiny) chapel but which also movedout into the city of Rome through elaborate processions in which the popeparticipated. In one of these processions, held on the night before the Feast ofthe Assumption,31 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref31] Christ, personified by theicon, went to ‘meet his mother’ in the form of a Marian icon, the Salus PopuliRomani, in Santa Maria Maggiore. The feet of the icon were washed at StaFrancesca Romana (formerly Sta Maria Nova), where the ‘knee’ gushed forthmiraculous oil while psalms were chanted and crowds genuflected. In processions,the pope did not carry the icon but did carry the famous golden reliquary crosswith the foreskin so that both of these potent objects were ‘visible’ to thepublic, albeit contained in reliquaries of sorts (the icon was covered in gold,silver and enamel, leaving only the face – now repainted – visible). Indeed,actually seeing these relics was perilous: one legend reported by Gerald ofWales tells of a pope who attempted to scrutinize the image of Christ and wasstruck blind in consequence.32 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref32]It was, however, the possession of the Acheropita that inspired the boast in thetitle of the Descriptio: ‘the most important sanctuary of the Lord of holyRome’. Nevertheless, beginning in the eleventh century, the Lateran feltcompelled to respond to competition from across Rome as St Peter’s began to beasserted as an equally important repository of treasure. In addition to theincomparable body of the Apostle, St Peter’s had acquired, perhaps as early asthe tenth century, what was destined to become one of the most famous of thePassion relics and the primary destination of pilgrims to Rome, the Veronica(illus. 41 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig41]).From the perspective of an outsider, the twelfth-century chronicler Gerald ofWales saw the two icons as a sort of complementary pair, calling them theUronica and the Veronica while expressing the opinion that the acrimoniouscompetition between them should be resolved. Nevertheless, an active competitioncarried forward. In 1208 Pope Innocent III even established an annual processionon the Feast of the Wedding of Cana that paralleled the famous procession of theAcheropita. In his sermon on the occasion, Innocent talks of Mary ‘finding’ herson in this event, but also of the encounter of the viewers and the image as a‘spiritual wedding between the human soul and Divine Grace’.33[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref33] The Poor Clare Margherita Colonna visited StPeter’s on account of ‘her immense desire to see the image that makes present hefor whom she constantly burned with desire’ and, as the sister of a cardinal,was able to gain access to the rarely seen relic.34[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref34] This, however, was certainly an exception tothe rule, at least until the procession was instituted, after which many people‘saw’ the relic. But what, we must ask, did they see?images [images/f0119-01.png]41 Master of the Munich Veronica (15th century), St Veronica with the Shroud ofChrist, oil on wood, 48.2 × 78.1 cm, Alte Pinakothek, Munich, Germany.In a private audience in 1191, the first time the cloth was clearly described ashaving a ‘face’, Pope Celestin III showed the Veronica as well as the relicheads of Peter and Paul to Philip Augustus, the king of France who was justreturning from Crusade. It was also Celestin who had the cloth installed in aciborium (a typical way to protect and ‘display’ relics in Rome, something likea large tabernacle). The relic was celebrated with as many as ten lamps burningbefore it. Canons and supporters of the Vatican wanted to assert that theVeronica was not only a ‘true image’ of the face of Christ, but a Passion relicthat revealed suffering and could make a significant spiritual impact on theviewer. If so, these features are more evident in the many copies and versionsrather than in the physical nature of the cloth itself (which is now said to betucked away high in one of the piers of St Peter’s).The original relic of the Veronica was ‘copied’ and disseminated widely, withfeatures decidedly more recognizable in these copies than in the original.Remarkably, the copies show an extremely wide variation in details, and thisvariation is revealing. One of the earliest pictures of the Veronica, by theEnglish chronicler Matthew Paris, exhibited a bust-length, strictly frontalimage with a halo. Most replicas, however, focus on just the face against awhite cloth or even ‘encased’ in a metal frame. These versions overlap indetails with replicas of the Acheropita, not surprising in that that image wasalso barely visible through most of its existence.Saint Veronica, as the enabling agent of the relic, joins other women, alongwith Mary, who are linked to important cloth relics. Significantly, she alsocame to be associated with the Gospel story of the bleeding woman, a primaryscriptural demonstration of the means by which matter might work as a channel ofthe divine (Mark 5:21–43). The bleeding woman had faith that if she touched thehem of Christ’s robe she would be healed. The story turns on the comments ofChrist, who felt the woman’s miraculous touch as distinctively separate from thejostling of the crowd. As with all interactions with relics, it is mostimportant that the devotee have faith, but the story also demonstrates thetransmissive power of material stuff, and that fabric, specifically through itssuppleness, thinness, even translucency, can function as a second skin. Asabove, with the seamless robe, the Veronica relic is conceptually associatedwith skin.In a painting by the Master of Saint Veronica from about 1420 we see the fullyelaborated iconography (see illus. 41 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig41]). Here theviewer is implicated in a social relation with Veronica herself as she solemnlymeditates, holding up the cloth for us to see. Her sadness emphasizes the imagein its status as relic – that is, testimony to the Passion of Christ in thepast, even if it also bestows on the object a ‘real presence’. As is typical,the holy face is isolated on the cloth, entirely frontal and darkened – withblood, with age, with mystery. New elements that did not appear in earlierimages of the veil include a suffering expression and the Crown of Thorns thatpierces the skin of the ‘image’ and forces out rivulets of blood, againemphasizing the human suffering. Now the stains of ‘sweat’ that made thelegendary image on the cloth are therefore joined by stains of blood. The halois a lacy fantasy that surrounds the head, indicating the divine aura, evenprotruding from the bottom of the forked beard.Such pictorial elaborations are indicative of a profound shift that occursbetween the early fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries, traced to theinteraction of the image with indulgences, especially those promulgated byInnocent III (which were attached to these images although the pope did notrequire that one say the prayer before an image). During the Jubilee year of1350, a spurious bull of Clement VI promised the Jubilee indulgence for all sinsonly if the pilgrim saw the relic of the Veronica. The ‘vernicle’ or pilgrimbadge representing the Veronica eventually became a mark of the pilgrimage toRome; it would appear that by means of St Veronica’s flourishing cult, StPeter’s took the lead in the Roman competition.RELICS AND CRUSADERS, SAINT LOUIS AND THE SAINTE-CHAPELLEWe began this section on relic collections with a discussion of the relics inConstantinople, the Christian capital of the Empire. They became the envy of theChristian world and later, with the Sack of 1204, the source of relics forcollections across Europe. However, before the Fourth Crusade, Constantinoplewas already a fount of relics, although rather than a flood the dispersal was acontrolled and minimal ‘trickle’. Before the Crusades, the True Cross can becharacterized as the most desired of all Byzantine imperial gifts, valued evenover precious materials or treasures of consummate workmanship. As such, itrepresented tremendous political power.35 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref35] Thatis, specifically, after Emperor Heraclius won it back from the Persians in theseventh century, Byzantine emperors controlled the largest portion of the relicof the True Cross (although a portion was said to remain in Jerusalem). TheCross, of course, was the motivating symbol of the Crusades, worn by everycrusader on his cloak, and after the Fourth Crusade, relics of the cross camepouring into Europe.images [images/f0123-01.png]42 Sainte-Chapelle interior, Paris, 1238–9, built by Louis IX.The story of the Crusades can indeed be told as the story of a series of relicsfound, given and stolen, and shrines appropriated. The crusaders justified theirmission, claiming that they sought to protect the sacred matter and places ofthe Holy Land from the spoliation of the infidels. Once they captured Jerusalem,they restructured Holy Land shrines including the Holy Sepulchre and the Shrineof the Ascension (see illus. 8 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig8]).36[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref36] Major turning points in the course of war wereattributed to relics – for example, the disaster of the capture of the TrueCross, or the events of the Siege of Antioch centring on the discovery andsubsequent disastrous capture of the Holy Lance. Most importantly for thehistory of relics in Western Europe, Crusaders returning with relics from theEast were able to bring prestige and glory to their lineage, usually throughdonations to and association with foundations or cathedrals.37[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref37]Although we recognize that the Crusaders were following the Byzantine model ofcreating power through the use of relics, they seem to have conceptualized theiractions as modelled on a different imperial power, one closer to their heartsand heritage, that is, the empire-building strategies of Charlemagne in theearly Middle Ages.38 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref38] A famous window atChartres Cathedral represents the Carolingian emperor donating a thorn and anail from the Crucifixion, which Charlemagne himself had purportedly receivedfrom the Patriarch of Jerusalem, according to the Pèlerinage de Charlemagne, atwelfth-century versified romance. Indeed, this legend seems to have amplifiedinterest in the Crown of Thorns, a relic of little importance in Byzantiumbefore the twelfth century, when Crusaders began to return with relics of theCrown of Thorns along with splinters of the True Cross and lots of pebbles orstone relics, and the desirability of the Crown relic soared.It was in this cultural climate that Baldwin II, ruler in Byzantium, findinghimself in dire need of funds, wrote to his cousin King Louis IX of France aboutthe Crown. Was it Blanche of Castile, Louis’s shrewd and pious mother, orArchbishop Cornut, the writer of the account of the reception of the Crown inFrance, who urged Louis to acquire the Crown as he prepared to depart forCrusade? In 1237, once the relic was redeemed from the Venetians who had takenit in pawn from Baldwin, plans were set in place to build an astonishing palacechapel in the French capital that would house the incomparable relic – indeed aprecious building with enormous stained-glass windows that is often called areliquary ‘turned inside out’ (illus. 42 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig42]).Although no expense was spared in the construction of the building and it becameone of the wonders of its age, its cost, at 40,000 gold livres, was dwarfed bythe 135,000 livres needed to redeem the relic. (Let us remember, Louis was not‘buying’ relics but rescuing them, as a favour to Baldwin, a Crusader king andrelative.) What did the Capetian king get for his investment? Louis, later StLouis, in acquiring the Crown, became not just the conservator of one of thePassion relics; he became the guardian of one of the most powerful of them all.The Crown was believed to be miraculous through Christ’s blood, ‘always green’and visibly whole. Indeed, the complete circle of the Crown attested that nomatter how many thorns were removed, the French king would always remain inpossession of the object in its entirety, which in turn gave him the exclusiveright to dispense relics, an idea propagated by the Crown’s iconography (seeillus. 44 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig44]).Louis dispensed thorns with great ceremony and pomp.39[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref39] If possible, the precious gift of each thornwas conveyed by a trusted and spiritually distinguished messenger, Franciscansand Dominicans by preference. The messenger conveyed, along with the relic, oneother item which assured its proper reception: a letter of donation from Louis,emphasizing the prestige of the gift that was one tiny part of the whole Crownbut a great treasure nonetheless, and insisting that the relic be veneratedproperly, that is, through both physical and liturgical celebration. Inresponse, in the wake of the gifts, chapels were built and liturgies written.Surviving inventories make much of the thorns, often noting Louis as the sourceof the relic and even recording the letters. Most remarkable are the precioussurviving original reliquaries.images [images/f0126-01.png]43 Unknown court artist, Paris, reliquary of the Thorn, before 1262, gold,gilded silver, rock crystal and gems, 21 × 9.5 cm, Abbey of Saint-Mauriced’Agaune, Switzerland.Saint-Maurice d’Agaune, a renowned monastery that was the recipient of manyroyal, even imperial gifts (see Chapter Two [07_Chapter02.xhtml], illus. 28[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig28]), possesses a beautiful gold, gilded silver, crystaland gemmed example, as well as the original letter of donation (illus. 43[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig43]).40 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref40] It was deliveredby Abbot Gerold of Saint-Maurice in Paris at Louis’ behest and, remarkably, itis almost identical in all but a few details to another reliquary of the thorngiven by Louis to San Francesco in Assisi, apparently delivered to Assisi by StBonaventure himself.In both reliquaries, the thorn is held in a precisely cut ovoid of rock crystaldrilled with a central cylindrical void to present the thorn both visibly andsafely. The stone is so very clear (representing new African sources of crystalthat were superior to European ones) that at first glance it would seem todisappear. This is a tremendous difference from crystals on earlier reliquaries,which presented relics under magnification but also behind imperfections andcloudiness (see illus. 12 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig12]). The clarity of the thornreliquaries suggests, in fact, that Louis was making a point of the exact natureof his gift: one thorn from the Crown. As the reliquary of the whole Crown inthe Sainte-Chapelle was lost during the French Revolution, it is uncertain if itshowed the circlet clearly, but its enormous crown shape certainly asserted theundeniable presence and wholeness of the relic.images [images/f0127-01.png]44 The ostensorium of relics in Sainte-Chapelle, 19th-century copy of theso-called ‘Pontifical of Poitiers’, originally painted for the Duke of Bedford(1389–1435), 1837.Furthermore, Louis did not acquire only the Crown of Thorns for his treasury. Asthe reliquary presentation in the Sainte-Chapelle emphasizes (see the platformin illus. 42 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig42] and the Grande Chasse in illus. 44[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig44]), Louis had also acquired portions of the True Cross,the Holy Lance, the vinegar-soaked sponge, the purple cloth, relics of theVirgin, the Mandylion (an acheiropoieton), and a bit of the stone of the HolySepulchre, among many other treasures.The Grande Chasse, at the eastern end of the Sainte-Chapelle, exhibited a fullset of the Passion relics in a permanent display. The magnificent church-shapedreliquary cost 100,000 livres, due to the cost of the lavish materials used tomake it, and stood on top of an elevated platform behind the altar. The platformwas accessible from both lateral sides via two spiral staircases and must havebeen of a generous size as there are records of relic showings in which thefortunate viewer had room to kneel on the platform to pray.In order to access the relics, however, the Chasse first had to be unlocked.There were six locks, and the keys were the exclusive property of the king.Multiple texts note instances when the king himself opened them. The platformhad some sort of mechanism that allowed the shrine to revolve and, although itsnormal face resembled the profile of a church with a crucifix attached, on dayswhen the relics were exposed to the faithful the entire shrine was turned toreveal a cupboard-like arrangement within which the relics were fixed in more orless permanent positions (although room was made for a bust reliquary of Louisafter his death and sanctification). Some representations show curtains, othersdo not, but they were probably part of the display and used to dramatic effect.Given that the chapel was royal and private, scholars have questioned who mighthave been able to see the relics, but evidence of vendors who sold snacks andsouvenirs in the courtyard outside clearly indicate that the crowds arrived.Although the Grande Chasse contained a permanent display of the Passion relicsencircling the Crown of Thorns and attesting to the prestige of the Frenchcrown, other relics further adding to the great and holy lustre of the chapelwere housed elsewhere. Later inventories counted almost a thousand items, manyof a more local significance, such as the relics of early French bishops thatattested to the glory of France herself as a producer of sanctity. Thecollection allowed a full set of services of every sort of saint and feast tooccur in the chapel.Because the Sainte-Chapelle was indeed a testimony to the glory of France, itsarchitecture epitomized opus francigenum, the new Gothic style that, though itwas spreading across Europe in countless cathedrals, was most particularized toLouis and this moment. Much of the colour of medieval architecture (primarily inthe form of paint) has been lost over the centuries, but few churches could havebeen as gloriously and fully decorated as was the Sainte-Chapelle, where everysurface was purported to have been painted, gilded, even encrusted with statuaryand ‘gems’.41 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref41] And of course, the voids arefilled with some of the most exquisite, soaring stained-glass windows of theMiddle Ages.The sculptures attached to the piers represent the Apostles, the ‘enamel’medallions (actually painted) tell the passions of martyrs, and the windowsinclude the stories of the Old Testament kings. One remarkable window detailsthe history of the relic of the Crown of Thorns along with its progressionacross France and reception by Louis and his family, Queen Blanche andArchbishop Cornut. Indeed, Louis’ possession of the Crown connects his line tothat of the Old Testament kings, specifically David and Solomon (and thereliquary of the Crown is likened to the shape of the royal crown).The Crown, ultimately, revealed itself to be the perfect subject for devotion.Louis’ own veneration of the relic was worthy of a saint, involving tears andlong sessions of prayer and meditation. As the subject of veneration by otherdevotees, the Crown relic had the potential not only to evoke stories of themocking of Christ and the Crucifixion, but also to literally manifest thematerials of Christ’s torture. Pain is not easily imagined without an instrumentby which it could be inflicted – a knife, a needle or a sharp thorn.42[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref42] In imagining Christ’s torture, the devoteeturns the torture upon him- or herself and thereby accepts the consequences ofsin and the hope of redemption. In the first decades of the fifteenth centuryThomas à Kempis, in his devotional text the Meditations on the Life of Christ,wrote:Prick at last the hardness of my heart, and with the sharpest thorn on Thy headpierce its very centre; that all in my blood that is hurtful, mingled with theevils of the flesh, may pour forth from the wound and the great spur of Thysacred love remain fixed therein . . . where once was the thorn of envy [willgrow] the lily of chastity.43 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref43]In taking up a particular devotion to the Crown, some worshippers even receivedits ‘marks’, following the example of St Rita of Cascia, who may have been thefirst to receive such a wound. When Rita asked to suffer like her Lord, herlegend reports, a thorn from a sculpture of Christ crucified fell and left awound in Rita’s forehead that never healed. Although during her life the woundsmelled of putrefying flesh, at her death her body took on the scent of roses.The miraculous mark on Rita’s body was made after her interaction with anartwork, and although relic thorns gained tremendous prestige as eliteecclesiastical and diplomatic gifts (see illus. 32 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig32],38 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig38], 43 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig43]), in monasteriesand private devotional spaces the Crown became something even more than a relic.As a vision that lodged in the devotional imagination after being provoked bythe sight of menacing spines or flowing gore, the Crown became the ultimatesymbol of Christ’s suffering, as well as in some sense a frame for Christ’s facethat allows its close and pious examination.In sum, Louis’ Sainte-Chapelle was a remarkable achievement in the creation ofholy space and display of relics. It celebrated what became one of the mostrenowned relics of Christendom and through a series of ever more glorious levelsof presentation – from reliquary, to Grande Chasse, to platform and finally thechapel itself – put the ensemble forward as an evocation of heavenly space andan incomparably powerful recreation of the Temple and a direct link to thedivine. As a result, it launched a devotion to the relic of the Crown of Thornsthat has remarkable potency even today.CHARLES IV, PRAGUE AND KARLŠTEJNOne of the special guests privileged to visit the Sainte-Chapelle and see itsrelics was a young Bohemian prince who never forgot the power and splendour ofthe relics and their setting. When he had an opportunity, he recreated theeffect in a unique ensemble of his own (illus. 45 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig45]).images [images/f0131-01.png]45 Bohemian artist, the Man of Sorrows, 1347–49, gilded silver, silver,champlevé enamel and glass paste (imitation ruby), 29.5 × 21.3 (w. at wings) ×12.7 cm, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, MD. Commissioned by John Volek, Bishopof Olomouc, for Charles IV; once held a thorn relic behind the crystal.As a young man of seventeen, in 1333 Charles IV returned from his youth in Paristo a ruined Bohemia.44 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref44] Under occupation in1279–80, the country’s churches had been plundered, and during the rule of hisfather, John of Luxembourg, treasuries had been largely ignored or worse,drained of ready funds. Charles set out to create a new beginning. Thecollection and disposition of relics and the making of reliquaries became aprimary tool of nation building as well as a means of self-definition for theyoung ruler. We should understand his actions as the ideational conduit betweenthe relic strategies of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in Aachen and Cologne(see illus. 12 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig12]),45 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref45]those of Louis IX, the Capetians and the Valois, and the later actions of theWittelsbachs and Habsburgs (to be discussed in the next chapter). Charlesfollowed Louis’ lead not in one project but many, especially in glorifying hiscapital of Prague, around which he built walls that multiplied its size by anorder of four, and inside of which he endowed churches and monasteries,showering them with many, many relics. Raised as the human repository of theambitions of many of his relatives, Charles fulfilled them perhaps beyond anyreasonable expectation. His aspirational relic collection reflects his politicaland spiritual goals and represents a peak of medieval relic collecting.As Charles began his meteoric rise to power, one of his first moves was topersuade the pope, his former tutor, to free the bishopric of Prague from thecontrol of Mainz and to raise its status from bishopric to arch-bishopric, atask accomplished in 1344. A second important move was to found a university in1348, the only one in Central Europe. These acts established Prague as a centreof learning and spirituality; Charles went on to make it a centre of art.After finally becoming king of Bohemia in 1346 at his father’s death, Charleswas elected king of the Romans in 1347, a position that has been characterizedas that of ‘anti-king’ because of the ensuing and continual struggles with theother claimant for the throne, Ludwig the Bavarian (who acrimoniously contendedwith both the pope and Charles’s family, the Luxembourgs). With the help of thepope, and calling on his own great political acumen, Charles was at last crownedHoly Roman Emperor in Rome in 1355 and even had his son crowned as his successorin 1376. As Holy Roman Emperor, to spin a variant of the old joke: Charles wassurely not Roman, but he could make a claim to being holier than most and workedhard to be an emperor. In rebuilding his country and especially the Bohemiancapital, the most eastern of the great European cities, Charles focused on theearly lessons of his mother, reinforced and aggrandized by what he had seen inFrance.He rebuilt St Vitus in Prague as a combination of Saint-Denis, Reims and theSainte-Chapelle – that is, as royal burial church, coronation church andreliquary treasury.46 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref46] His efforts, with thehelp of the brilliant architect Peter Parler, produced one of the mosttheatrical of cathedrals in a city organized around processional axes andspectacular views. The hill of the palace and cathedral provides a breathtakingvantage point from which to survey the city, but at the same time also risesabove that very city as a looming presence. From the New Town, the cathedral andpalace seem an almost celestial destination accessible by means of the then newand glorious Charles Bridge crossing the Moldau River.The architecture of St Vitus confounds description (see illus. 35[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig35], 75 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig75]). A wholly newconception of light and airy soaring Gothic space with spectacular andinnovative vaults, it is nevertheless grounded upon the purposeful retention ofvenerable sanctity and tradition – that is, it surrounds and protects the‘oldness’ of the sombre and dark chapel that is the burial spot of the martyr StWenceslaus (and the precise location of a succession of churches built in hishonour, illus. 46 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig46]).As ancestor of the king and early nobility of the dynasty, Duke Wenceslaus wascelebrated above all others as the Bohemian saint par excellence. Charles, ineffect, paired him with his newly acquired patron, the Burgundian king Sigismund(from the opposite extreme of his empire and enshrined in a chapel across thenave of the cathedral), as holy royal forbears. Charles himself was eventuallyburied in the centre of the nave between them.images [images/f0134-01.png]46 Peter Parler, wall painting, with hardstone insets, gold pastiglia and othermaterials, 1372–6, St Wenceslaus Chapel, St Vitus Cathedral, Prague.While the cathedral was not yet complete (the foundation stone was laid byCharles in 1344 but building continued even after Parler’s death in 1399),Charles took advantage of its spatial potential and staged his own coronation,following the new ordo (coronation liturgy) that he had helped to write, andmaking use of the new and gorgeous ‘Wenceslaus’ crown that he had commissioned.The crown has now become part of the national regalia, but origin-ally, afterits first use in the coronation ceremony, was intended for deposit in thecathedral as an ornament for and donation to the golden reliquary bust ofWenceslaus commissioned by the emperor.Although our primary goal here is a discussion of Charles’s relic display in theChapel of the Holy Cross in his castle of Karlštejn (illus. 47[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig47]), 30 km southwest of Prague and consecrated in 1365(the castle itself was completed in 1372), the emperor’s projects were sointerrelated and complex that they must be discussed together in order tounderstand anything of their contemporary significance. Thus, although theWenceslaus Chapel in the cathedral was not consecrated until 1367, the twochapels at Karlštejn and Prague were conceived, constructed and decorated intandem, reinforcing one another’s meaning both symbolically and spiritually.images [images/f0135-01.png]47 Chapel of the Holy Cross, 1360–64, wall painting with hardstone insets, goldpastiglia and other materials, Karlštejn Castle, Czech Republic.Perhaps the most striking consonance between the two projects was the gold andprecious gems or, to apply modern precision, we’ll call them the semi-preciousstones and gilded pastiglia, that were used to clothe the walls of the chapels.The same stone is used on the shrine of Wenceslaus and in another palace chapelbuilt by Charles in Tangermünde in Brandenburg. Without doubt the use of thestone evokes associations with the Heavenly Jerusalem and its portals ofprecious stones, as described in Revelation. A contemporary Czech life ofCatherine describes her mystical marriage as taking place in such a room, with afloor ofberyl, the walls of diamonds set in gold, [with] many tiny windows . . . inwhich gleamed precious stones instead of glass: hyacinths and rubies, turquoise,sardonyx, balas rubies in ivory, jasper, chalcedony, chrysolite, amethyst,pearls, [all] exquisitely worked.47 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref47]Such descriptions are a feature of mythic royal rooms in medieval literature.Otherworldly effects are achieved at Karlštejn by the rich colours of the inlaidwall revetment and, in fact, the original windows did have translucent inlaidstones rather than glass. Of particular significance for contemporary viewerswas that the wall revetment stones were of Bohemian – that is, local – origin,so that while the reference is to heaven, there is no doubt of the‘localization’ of the sanctifying effect.Charles was obviously so enamoured with the extraordinary and enclosing effectof such stone cladding that he used it in all his most important projects.Indeed, at Karlštejn he covered over recently finished frescoes with anencrustation of the stones in the so-called Catherine Chapel (actually moreproperly called the Chapel of the Most Glorious Passion and its Signs, but alsothe Oratory of Charles IV, see illus. 49 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig49]). The effecthas reminded one scholar of an incident recorded concerning Charles’sgrandfather. Apparently, frightened of thunderstorms, he had an altar-shapedretreat constructed. When storms threatened, he would place relics on the uppersurface and crawl inside, calling for the intercession of the saints.Both the Catherine Chapel and the Holy Cross Chapel recall such a womb-like andmagical retreat. Indeed both are not only filled with relics but also encrustedwith health-giving gems – in the Holy Cross Chapel gems hang from the grille,and an ancient cameo of Medusa adorns the boss of the vault of the CatherineChapel.48 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref48] Now, however, rather than a retreatfor a fearful soul, these chapels are the expression of Charles’s visions of aglorious, elevated, yet also private and salvific space.The creation of such holy space – often, again, likened to a reliquary turnedinside out – required a degree of artistic mastery not readily available in theworkshops of Bohemia. Charles summoned some of the greatest talents of his ageto work for him: architects Matthias from Arras and Peter Parler from SchwäbischGmünd, and painters Nicholas Wurmser from Strasbourg and Master Theodoric fromPrague. The team also included many silver- and goldsmiths and even a courtstone polisher, Johann, all summoned to realize the emperor’s desire to displaythe relics he collected in the finest manner possible. Charles collectedvoraciously, while also selectively and with purpose. He acquired hundreds ofrelics and, though he redistributed most of these to the churches andmonasteries he founded, it is thought that 60 per cent of the relics still in StVitus are due to his donations. It was almost as if he considered that hisposition as emperor allowed him to declare a sort of ‘eminent domain’ in termsof relics he thought could be employed more effectively in another location. Heopened altars and coffins that had not been disturbed in centuries, arrivingwith large groups of ecclesiastical worthies and pressuring timid monks orcanons for a gift of their relics. Despite the horrified protests of the monksof St Gall, he collected part of the skull and half the body of Othmar, makinguse of a saw in the process. Clearly he understood the Church’s doctrine onrelics – even the tiniest fragment could stand for the undiminished power of thesaint – but nevertheless he had a certain affection for whole bodies or at leasttheir skulls. (Under his patronage Prague Cathedral had an unprecedented numberof head reliquaries.)The story of his acquisition of the body of St Sigismund as recounted by Jeand’Orville in La Chronique de Savoie, whether accurate or not, is telling.Charles became interested in the king and martyr Sigismund when he encounteredthe relics at the monastery of Einsiedeln in 1364 and took away part of a skullalong with the arm of St Maurice. Then, in 1365, after Charles revived anancient custom, not practised since Emperor Barbarossa in 1178, of being crownedas king of Burgundy in Arles as successor of the sixth-century Sigismund, hetravelled to Agaune to visit the primary relics. The ancient monastery had beendedicated by Sigismund himself, to the saint and martyr soldier, Maurice, thecommander of the Theban Legion (the warrior saints who were so important toGerman princes, as we have seen). In the sixth century, after his martyrdom,Sigismund’s body and those of his sons had been returned to Agaune andpurportedly caused miracles.Jean d’Orville’s chronicle claims that when the emperor arrived, the canons atSaint-Maurice did not know the location of the king’s body. A determined Charlesrevealed an old manuscript he had been studying that not only told the life ofthe saint but also specified his precise burial spot. The entourage swept intothe chapel and, by torchlight, determined a spot on the wall to break through –and the martyr was found. Charles took the skull (the canon’s letter ofauthentication attests that he also got half the body) but when he then askedfor the relics of Maurice, the monks finally found their courage, protested andwere able to persuade him to accept a ‘contact’ relic, an axe, instead.Charles was careful to characterize his actions at Agaune not as theft, but as afurta sacra, the oxymoronic term for holy theft, claiming that the canons atAgaune were not taking proper care of the Sigismund relic, as evidenced by hisassertion that they did not know where the body of Sigismund lay. Being able tomake this claim was important, as it put Charles’s actions in the category of‘rescue’ rather than ‘theft’. After pursuing this strategy, however, Charles’sdecision to leave behind a portion of the relics in a lavish reliquary was ajudicious final move.49 [13_References.xhtml#rch03ref49] Such exchanges andsubsequent promotion of cult veneration justified Charles’s frequent ‘eminentdomain’ claims. Further justification could be found in a letter Charlesaddressed to the pope, in which he asserted that many of the relics he took wereoriginally given to institutions by his predecessors as emperor, particularly byhis patron saint Charlemagne. As a result, Charles argued, he was simplyreclaiming the relics.A great light shone down on the city upon the arrival of the relics of StSigismund in Prague and a book was written in 1366 that collected the stories ofother miracles caused by the relics. We have already noted that Sigismund cameto reside in a pendant chapel to that of Wenceslaus in the cathedral, andCharles even had another gold head reliquary made for Sigismund, to pair himmore precisely with the older Bohemian royal martyr.Although many saints’ stories are written as if it were the case, this accountshould put to rest any idea that the acquisition of relics was fortuitous oropportunistic. Instead, in the case of Charles’s acquisition of the relics ofSigismund, we see a very different picture: the purposeful forging of structuresof power; the consolidation and expansion of legend; the polishing of the lustreof long traditions of veneration, and the culminating creation of spectacularartworks that present and glorify newly acquired relics. It is not surprisingthat the Czech people responded with alacrity to Sigismund’s presence and that acult developed that overshadowed the veneration of the native royal saintWenceslaus.We can reconstruct a similar purposeful and astutely political approach to thecreation of an artwork – a reliquary cross with Passion relics that Charlescreated in 1353–5 for Karlštejn and which he fully intended to have become anational treasure, bringing glory to his people and to his own position asemperor. Indeed, with this project, one can’t help but ask if, in his emulationof Louis IX, he was not aspiring to equivalent recognition – that is, hoping tobecome a dynastic saint like Louis, or Charles’s own ancestor Wenceslaus. We maypresume he did not achieve such recognition because of his son’s lack of successas a ruler and the Hussite uprisings that obviated such an outcome –canonization proceedings took a significant investment in both time and money.Charles’s Bohemian reliquary cross, although no longer extant, is clearlyrepresented in three pictures at Karlštejn (for two of the three, see illus. 48[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig48], 49 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig49]).50[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref50] Two are in the small tower, one in the MaryChapel (illus. 48 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig48]) and the other in the so-calledCatherine Chapel (over the door as one departs the chapel). The third is locatedin a damaged fresco on the stairs leading up to the Chapel of the Holy Cross inthe high tower. All show a massive cross with gemmed quadrilobes at the crossends and a fifth quadrilobe at the juncture of the arms (the images were allonce gilded with added ornament and ‘gems’, probably of glass).This cross should be contrasted (and in illus. 47 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig47] onecan see both, if barely) to a very different cross on another wall of the MaryChapel, made of the Bohemian gemstone encrustations and framed in gildedpastiglia banding. That cross, with its massive ‘stepped’ support and cruxgemmata form, should be thought of as recalling the Cross on Golgotha in theHoly Land, whose erection is now attributed to the efforts of EmperorTheodosius, but in the Middle Ages was thought to have been placed on the siteof the Crucifixion by Emperor Constantine himself.Remarkably, this Karlštejn cross is in a dynamic relationship with a narrativescene above it – the cross of Golgotha, which reminds viewers of the place ofChrist’s death, here gives way to his resurrection above. The scenes are unitedin their use of inset stones and gold pastiglia framing, as well as by a longinscription in Latin that begins: In hoc sepulchrum . . ., ‘In this sepulchre .. .’, and continues on to list a series of Holy Land relics – what must havebeen tiny pebbles and splinters embedded in the wallof the stone of the sepulchre of the Lord . . . of the crib of the Lord, fromthe place of the Last supper, from the place where Thomas touched him . . . fromthe place where the virgin died, from the place of the Ascension . . .This ‘gemmed’ cross therefore is not only a depiction of the Golgotha cross butalso is united to a fully realized reliquary, in effect itself a ‘holysepulchre’, a pilgrim’s cross containing relics that physically andmetaphorically unite Bohemia to the Holy Land through the relics under the stoneof the tomb, in the very wall of the chapel.images [images/f0141-01.png]48 Nicholas Wurmser of Strasbourg(?), Crux gemmata, 1357–8, wall painting withhardstone insets and pastiglia, Chapel of Our Lady, Karlštejn Castle, CzechRepublic.Perhaps Charles’s gold reliquary cross, as a crux gemmata, made in devotion byan emperor, is meant to echo this ‘Constantinian’ cross. Both show prominentcross ends and prominent green stones (any others are mostly missing). Charlesmust have also intended another reference – that is, to the great reliquarycross of the Holy Roman Empire, today in Vienna. It too is made of wood coveredwith gold, includes interior compartments for relics, has prominent cross endswith central gems surrounded by other gems, and contains a large relic of theTrue Cross that looks very like the one Charles holds in the fresco.Despite all Charles’s efforts to elevate his gold reliquary cross to the highestsacred status, it does not survive. He himself melted it down and made a new oneof pure gold in c. 1370 to accommodate yet another relic of the True Cross, agift in 1360 from the Byzantine emperor. The cross that survives in thecathedral of St Vitus has lily-formed terminals in a French manner and revealsits relics through windows and capsules – three separate relics of the TrueCross including the Byzantine gift and a large piece that was a gift from theFrench; two thorns, again a gift from the French; as well as relics of thesponge, a gift from Duke Alois Gonzaga of Mantua, and a holy nail. With theornamentation of this even more magnificent new cross, which includes exquisitesapphires, pearls and imperial cameos, of both ancient and Byzantine provenance,Charles clearly intended to supersede his original statement. Now he is emperor,displaying relic gifts from many royal and imperial sources. As king of kings,he is no longer building a great reliquary collection; it – and he – haveclearly arrived.Nevertheless, in order fully to understand Charles’s intentions for the use anddisplay of his imperial cross – and why it was so important to him – we mustreturn to the ‘portraits’ of the first gold cross at Karlštejn. The firstrepresentation of the reliquary seems to be in the frescoes on the wall thatflanks the entrance to the Catherine Chapel. There, in a much-remarked series,we see three active and highly symbolic exchanges (illus. 49[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig49]). In the first, Charles is dressed in gold shoes anda delightful, lavish green-lined cloak covered with images of parrots(!).Crowned with the imperial crown, which includes, underneath, a bishop’s mitrewith lappets, he is seen accepting a large piece of the True Cross and two longthorns from the French king (dressed much more simply in blue). This has beenvariously argued as representing Jean II or Charles V as Dauphin. In the secondscene, again, Charles, now in ermine-lined red, accepts an unidentified giftfrom a king in green (who some have suggested is the Byzantine emperor, or theking of Hungary or Cyprus). In the third and final scene, Charles has moveddecisively from under the arches and into a vaulted chapel (perhaps having first‘climbed’ the lavish steps below, which can be read as a reference to Solomon’spalace of the Song of Songs with its ‘lattices’ on windows through which onemight peer: Song of Songs 2:8–9). The priest-king Charles now steps up onto thealtar space, bending humbly in order to place the relic of the True Cross intothe larger Relic Cross. Dressed in gilded brocades, the most elaborate ofCharles’s costumes yet, the emperor reverentially grasps the elaborately definedfoot of the cross stand, which is ornamented with flying buttresses andpinnacles in a clear reference to the Prague style of Gothic architecture (asabove, see illus. 35 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig35]). The depiction of the emperorabout to place the relic into the cross indicates Charles’s assumption here ofquasi-priestly roles, especially confirmed by the episcopal pretensions of hiscrown.images [images/f0143-01.png]49 Nicholas Wurmser of Strasbourg, Charles Receiving Relic of the Passion andPlacing them in the Cross, before 1357, wall painting, Chapel of Our Lady,southern wall, Karlštejn Castle, Czech Republic.The precision of these depictions and their indication of Charles’s direct rolein these proceedings do not seem to be fiction. After commissioning this cross,Charles proceeded to appeal to the pope to allow a seven-year andseven-quarantine indulgence in 1357 (equal to the lavish Aachen indulgences forthe Virgin’s camisa, or for the regalia of the Holy Roman Empire), when it wasdisplayed in the newly built civic spaces of New Town along with the regalia.The emperor was also involved in writing the liturgy for that ceremony. Suchliterally hands-on involvement bespeaks Charles’s belief in the power of relics,but also his belief in the power of relics’ ability to arouse devotion, inciteaction and bind groups together. With his reliquary cross, he intended to forgea new identity for Bohemia that demonstrated the honour due to him (and, hehoped, his lineage) as Holy Roman Emperor. He could not legally lay claim to theimperial relics and regalia – they were always only on loan to the electedemperor – but he could create a collection of relics that rivalled their glory.If we now again look to the details of the representation of Charles and Anna ofŚwidnica, his third wife, above the door of the Catherine Chapel (illus. 50[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig50]), we are struck by the queen’s beauty, the king’sexpression of devout eagerness, and the way in which the imperial pair hold thecross. Their hands elevate the precious object, almost caress it, but also takea precise position that becomes a flesh and blood reiteration of the beautifulcross stand, their hands mimicking the architectural structures so apparent inthe two other mural portraits of this cross. It has been suggested that in thisimage, Charles and Anna recreate the homage of Constantine and Helena to theTrue Cross, but I would suggest that they are not only a reincarnation of sortsof that saintly imperial pair, they are also the incarnation of imperial dignity(Charles now in gold robe with the imperial eagles), and of Prague and Bohemiaitself as ‘support’ for the exaltation of this most holy Bohemian cross.The cross was, in fact, originally intended to be kept in the Catherine Chapel –that is, until the Chapel of the Holy Cross in the high tower could becompleted. Consecrated in 1365, the latter emerged as a tour de force display ofboth the emulation of old ideas and the introduction of new ones. In theseemingly impregnable heavy-walled fortress at the top of the high tower,protected by four doors and nineteen locks, accessible only to the privilegedfew, Charles sponsored what has to be recognized as one of the most beautifuland compelling of relic ensembles, one that likely represented for Charles theculmination of his expression of devotion to the saints, the Passion of Christ,the Empire and its heritage and rule.images [images/f0145-01.png]50 Nicholas Wurmser of Strasbourg, Charles IV and Anna of ēwidnica, mural abovethe entrance portal, Oratory of Charles IV, c. 1360, wall painting, addedhardstone inserts and gold pastiglia, Karlštejn Castle, Czech Republic.As many have noted, the Holy Cross Chapel recalls visions of the HeavenlyJerusalem, but a Heavenly Jerusalem inflected by contemporary political andspiritual exigencies. Rows of saints are represented, the most impressivepainted by the king’s artist Theodoric, who created figures that appear fullyround, weighty and present. Their gestures and glances create a forceful networkof psychological power within the relatively small but glorious chapel. Saintsfeatured include the Apostles, martyrs, confessors, knights, monks, nuns andvirgins, with prophets and angels supporting and commenting at the margins. Eachholy person was characterized individually by means of hairstyle and colour,costume, attribute and gesture. Each image was made the more potent with theinclusion of a relic wrapped in gold foil in the lower frame of the image (nowremoved except for KA 3721, which survived in the upper frame).51[13_References.xhtml#rch03ref51] Many figures overlap the frames that enclosethem, seeming to begin to protrude into the space of the chapel. Each looks outfrom his or her niche with large, liquid and beseeching eyes.images [images/f0146-01.png]51 Master Theodoric, St George, 1360–64, paint and gold on panel, 115 × 90 cmapprox., Chapel of the Holy Cross, Karlštejn Castle, Czech Republic.Given the particularization of the images and their distinctive sense ofpersonality, it is all the more ironic that most are now unidentifiable.Theodoric seems not to have wanted to disturb the spatial illusion he created byusing text labels, and presumably the saints were once identified withauthentics that were visible behind the crystal relic covers. Of course,habitués of the palace knew their identity. One of the knights that can still beidentified with certainty is St George (illus. 51 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig51]).His image was lavishly embellished with added elements of gilded tin, andpastiglia details of brooch, halo, the rim of the shield and the belt. Frequentrestorations of the panels (as early as c. 1600) have damaged the fine finishand modelling of figures such as this one, but George still emerges as asympathetic and lively figure. The motif of the shield wrapping around the bodyand receding into space gives the figure a vital quality of presence, as if hewere about to speak.images [images/f0147-01.png]52 Master Theodoric, upper centre: Crucifixion and Man of Sorrows with Angelsand Saints, 1360–64, paint and gold on panel, with lower centre: insertedtriptych by Tomaso da Modena, Virgin with SS Wenceslas and Palmatius, c. 1355,tempera on wood, Chapel of the Holy Cross, Karlštejn Castle, Czech Republic.In contrast, other figures such as St Ludmila are relatively unadorned andpainted only in shades of white and blue which, however, masterfully createthree-dimensional folds of cloth that so successfully define these figures. BothLudmila and George are located behind the grille that divides the chapel intotwo zones; that is, they are closer to the altar. If we turn to the images thatdominate the space before the grille, instead of Apostles, bishops and martyrswe find the doctors of the Church, holy knights and, in particular, a series ofsainted emperors. These rulers hold orbs of power and heraldic shields (attachedto the images, but mostly of later reconstruction, illus. 47[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig47]). They make an impressive array of Charles’sforbears: he specifically traced his lineage to Charlemagne and we have seen heemulated Constantine and venerated St Louis.Finally, if we attend to the paintings around the altar, we see a strikingensemble. Above the altar and the grilled cupboard that was used to hold andsecure the Bohemian reliquary cross and the imperial regalia, is a series ofdevotional images, surrounded by the icons of the Evangelists and St Anne(illus. 52 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig52]). Just as Charles focused his piety onrelics of the Passion, so these images trace Christ’s incarnation, culminatingin the Crucifixion above. The lowest triptych is, in fact, an inserted panelthat was painted by the Italian artist Tomaso da Modena in tempera rather thanthe oil of the other panels, and was imported from Treviso (1355–9). It depictsthe Madonna and Child with saints Wenceslaus and Palmatius. Above this image ofChrist’s childhood is a beautiful and tragic figure of Christ as the ‘Man ofSorrows’, displaying three actively, profusely bleeding wounds.The painting doubles as a representation of the Entombment as the Three Marysapproach from Christ’s left, bringing jars of ointment. A large rectangulardepression in the purple simulated stone of the sarcophagus is reminiscent ofthe ‘tomb’ with relics from the resurrection image in the Mary Chapel discussedearlier (see illus. 48 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig48]). Perhaps following thatprecedent, this tomb also held Holy Land relics. Above, the cycle culminates inan image of the Crucifixion with Mary and John mourning, now revealing all fivewounds.The large dark mark that is clearly visible in the centre of Christ’s chest inthat mural is not, however, one of the wounds, unless we think of it as a woundto the painting. In this spot in the fabric of the painting were embedded twosmall splinters of the True Cross. Similarly, a bit of the sponge was embeddednext to Christ’s side wound, and a bit of a thorn was inserted into the halo insuch a manner that it touched (or ‘pierced’) Christ’s head. Presumably, this useof relics was almost invisible to the uninformed viewer, as they were originallycovered in paint and held tight within the surface. Only the later destructiveremoval of the relics has made the repositories so visible. But these were therelics that were most precious to Charles, the very ones he celebrated in theBohemian Reliquary Cross and envisioned as the focus and motivation to hispersonal piety.There is no doubt that Charles succeeded beyond measure in his project ofsanctifying Prague and Bohemia. His Prague realized a ‘golden age’, the periodalways remembered as the apex of the glory of the Church in Bohemia. Crowds atannual relic showings were huge and the completed cathedral is one of the mostmagnificent in Europe. But even if our attention is drawn to the city, to thebridge, to the church architecture, to Theodoric’s paintings, to the beauty ofthe goldsmiths’ work, Charles’s own attention never waivered from his preciousrelics. He gave them to his church and to his city, embedded them in walls andin crosses, but always held them close to his heart. In his chapel, it must beadmitted, he created his own private Jerusalem."},{"pageContent":"4THE RELIQUARY AFTER TRENT: THE AFFECTIVE, THE COLLECTIVEAT FIRST GLANCE, Matthias Gerung’s print of 1546 for a German translation ofSebastian Meyer’s Apocalypse and Satirical Allegories on the Church (illus. 53[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig53]) recalls medieval representations of the celebrationof the Mass – it is organized into two pictorial registers, below a cleric‘celebrating’, and above a ‘heavenly mass’ paralleling the earthly events.Closer examination of the woodcut, however, reveals a very different picture.Instead of assisting with a Mass, a pair of demonic figures wearing cardinal’shats, flames licking their taloned feet, are selling indulgences laden withpapal seals. Behind them the pope himself, crowned with his tiara, protectivelywithholds a covered ciborium, a devil’s head protruding Alien-like from hischest; he is seated at a table rather than celebrating at an altar, and theactual altar, on which is placed an elaborate reliquary-like monstrance, hasbeen relegated to the back of the print, ignored by the elaborately andimmodestly dressed congregation who push forward eagerly to buy their way out ofsin.In the upper register, in striking contrast, the Protestant faithful celebrateas part of a primitive church, without ornamental or demonic elements. Childrenare baptized, congregants hear sermons and freely receive both the host and thewine, and a priest even leaves the church and ministers to a man in the streetoutside. The condemnation of the excess of Catholic practices is lively andpointed: Catholics are accused of being in league with the devil in anApocalyptic vision that holds pure religious devotion as the only means ofescape from a wicked world.images [images/f0151-01.png]53 Matthias Gerung, Apocalypse and Satirical Allegories on the Church, 1546,woodcut, 23.3 × 16.2 cm. Commissioned by Count Palatine Ottheinrich (Otto-Henry)as illustrations to Sebastian Meyer’s polemical commentary on the Apocalypse(first published in Latin in Zurich, 1539), translated into German by LaurentiusAgricola in 1544, never completed.Given the remarkable power that came to be centred on relics and reliccollections in the late Middle Ages, Protestant reformers found a ready targetfor censure. Critiques of the abuse of relics and the Eucharist, especially theoffence of payment for indulgences, poured forth. Attacks were met with counterattacks. Accusations of corruption were vigorously rebuffed by the Church at theCouncil of Trent (1545–63) and ‘a new language of contest, strife and victory’emerged in the discussion of the Eucharist at the Council, which issued thisruling:And it is necessary that the victorious truth should triumph in this manner overlies and heresy, so that its enemies should lose courage and be broken by thesight of so great a splendour and such joy of the universal church, or rather,affected by shame and confused, let them come to their senses.1[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref1]The mission was clear, the call to arms delivered. The fight, however, was notto be won with conventional weapons. It was a battle for the ‘senses’; the enemywas to be defeated by ‘the sight of so great a splendour’ and joy in theuniversal Church.Furthermore, the Church agreed that an effort to strengthen faith could notbegin with any challenge to the validity of relics, which had been venerated bythe faithful from time immemorial. Instead of addressing Luther’s specificcharges concerning relics, the Council simply insisted upon ‘authoritativeapproval before ostentation’ of relics. Remarkably, such approval allowing theshowing of relics might be based on a startling range of justifications:miracles, visions, previous veneration, even the existence of customarypilgrimages and fairs – not the sort of testimony that would be satisfactory intoday’s courts. The Bollandistes, who sponsored a much more evidence-basedproject arguing for the validity of saints (and eventually, famously, debunkedSt Christopher), did not appear on the scene until 1643.Jesuits were generally leaders in the Catholic defence, and one of their number,Jean Ferrand, wrote a response in 1647, Disquisitio reliquaria, in which hetakes on perhaps the most difficult objection raised by the Protestants – thatis, with so many duplications among venerated relics, which, if any, weregenuine? In astonishing fashion, Ferrand argues that relics such as the TrueCross, the thorns and Luke’s portrait of the Madonna were so ‘necessary to thedevotion of the Church’ that a divine and miraculous multiplication had occurredthat enabled access for the faithful.2 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref2] Otherless important multiples might be the product of human error, but the greattraditions of the Church were not to be derided or ignored.Ultimately, such arguments could not stand, and reform and enlightenmentsucceeded in labelling much of relic veneration as superstitious behaviour. Thismay explain why post-Tridentine collections, the most spectacular of allreliquary ensembles, are the least known today. In this great last age of reliccollection, cultural ambivalence may account for what amounted to wild swings ofthe pendulum, in the making and unmaking of collections, in alternatelymagnificent displays or secretive protection from theft and from view. If,however, princely glory required the assemblage of a Wunderkammer (cabinet ofcuriosities), such collections included not only scientific specimens, books andart, but also relics and reliquaries. Indeed, relics often served as thefoundational underpinnings of such repositories, and can often be characterizedas the most beloved of components. We will first discuss collections in the ageof Reform, then move to notable post-Tridentine relic displays in the militantlyCatholic regions of Spain, Portugal, Naples, Bavaria and Bohemia. As we willsee, Rome plays a lesser role in setting trends than might be expected.RELIC COLLECTIONS OF THE REFORMATION ERAWith newly reformed Protestant churches discarding unwanted relics, massiveamounts of sacred material was put into motion in sixteenth- andseventeenth-century Europe. Even as relics continued to be given as gifts,others, despite long-standing sanctions reaffirmed by Trent, were sold with theproviso that by such sale they were rescued from heretics. Some were evensubject to looting – for example, the Wittelsbach riches, including reliquaries,were transferred from Munich to Sweden by a victorious Gustavus Adolphus duringthe Thirty Years War, despite the fact that the general was fighting for theProtestants.With renowned imperial collectors like Maximilian I and later Rudolph II ofPrague setting the pace, collecting ever larger numbers of relics became whatcan only be deemed a rivalry in which even princes and nobility could take part.Albrecht, son of the elector of Brandenburg, archbishop and eventually cardinal,assembled more than 8,000 relics at Halle in a complex of buildings he wished tofound as a university. Prince Frederick the Wise, the elector of Saxony, endowedthe palace chapel of Wittenberg with a collection that eventually numbered over19,000 relics and was also associated with a university. Ironically, althoughmost of those relics were dispersed and the reliquaries almost entirelydestroyed, one piece does survive in Veste Coburg. A beautifully cut glass, onceused as a reliquary, was given to Luther and used by him for its originalfunction – drinking. It is now preserved as a ‘relic’ of the reformer. Giventhat Wittenberg is the very church upon which Luther posted the 95 theses, andthat the city in some sense represents the epicentre of religious change, acloser look is in order.Wittenberg’s relic wealth began as a ducal family collection. In 1353, withpapal permission, Rudolph I founded a chapel and chapter of canons in order tocelebrate a thorn relic given to him by Philip VI of France, a continuation ofthe tradition of such gifts of thorns by French kings. The thorn was only thefirst of a flood of gifts, diplomatic exchanges and bequests that, with thesupport of a series of documents signifying papal approval, swelled thecollection to enormous size under Frederick the Wise.The relic treasures were put on annual public display on the second Sunday afterEaster as a sort of pious and spectacular showing and source of ‘grace’ for thecommunity. Indeed, the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder, an artist who wouldlater be central in the creation of a new iconography of Protestant art, wasresponsible in 1508 for creating a pamphlet (published in 1509 in two successiveeditions) filled with woodcuts that celebrated the relics of Wittenberg andtheir potential viewing and veneration at such a showing.images [images/f0155-01.png]54 . . . Das wirdig hailthumb das do rastet auff dem hailigenn Perg ze Andechsin obern payern, broadside on the relics at Kloster Andechs, Bavaria, 1496, 26.5× 75 cm, woodcut with hand colouring, British Museum, London.The Cranach pamphlet itself is a remarkable, albeit modest document. It depictsfewer reliquaries than the Heiltumsbuch in Aschaffenburg (Ms 14), which included350 watercolours, produced in 1526 for Albrecht, generally called the HallescheHeiltum,3 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref3] but reveals much more about practiceand audience reception of the relics than does the renowned and singularmanuscript. Both Heiltumsbucher can be characterized as illustrated inventories,but the Wittenberg pamphlet was available for purchase by devotees and istherefore in many ways similar to the large single-sheet woodcuts that showedthe contents of treasuries, or even the woodcut Andachtsbilder (devotionalimages) that were sold at shrines to pilgrims (as at Andechs, illus. 54[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig54]).4 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref4]The series of images in the Wittenberg Heiltumsbuch must have served as a sortof guidebook for viewers of the reliquaries, which were arranged in Gängen, or‘passages’, culminating with the most spectacular and holy examples of Passionrelics. Few copies of the paper edition survive, although the presentationcopies that were printed on vellum persist in greater numbers. Remarkably, theevidence of the woodcuts makes it clear that one could not see the relics inmost of these reliquaries – the illustrations in and of themselves were doingthe devotional heavy lifting. And indeed, many represent appealing figures, forexample those of the virgin martyrs of the ‘erst gang’ were made more charming,active and fantastically detailed in the transition from surviving preparatorysketches to woodcut: Margaret bursts forth from the back of a defeated andgrisly dragon in the woodcut (illus. 55 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig55]), but in thesketch (surviving in the Weimar Archive sketchbook ThHStAW Reg. O213 fol. 32r.),a staid figure of a crowned Margaret holds a diminutive dragon.In addition, on each of the pages of the booklet, the relics are meticulouslylisted and each entry ends with an accounting of the total number of relicparticles therein contained – 34 in the case of Margaret, including a tooth. Thewoodcuts together form a fascinating document that attests to the devotionalpractice of viewing such relics/reliquaries; clearly the viewer was encouragedto let the saint ‘come alive’ in his or her imagination but also to enumerateand consider each individual relic in a process that promised to be good for thesoul.Such accounting was profitable because the devotee earned an indulgence with avisit to this ‘Sainte-Chapelle’, dedicated to All the Saints. According to aPapal brief, a total number of days of remission from purgatory were granted,calculated via the number of particles venerated. The pamphlet lists altogether5,005 – the arithmetic problem alone is stupefying, in an era of widespreadimplementation of double-entry bookkeeping, one that must have seemed worth itswhile. Notwithstanding its popular success, our contemplation of the worth ofthis project is ultimately brought up short by the reminder that this is thevery church that inspired Luther’s protests.Remarkably, Frederick continued in his support of Luther, and indeed, the devoutelector’s protection was the reason that the reformer was allowed to speak atthe Diet of Worms without punishment or execution. It is important to recallthat Luther’s initial furore was aroused by the selling of indulgences and thehated popular notion, ‘As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul frompurgatory springs.’5 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref5] Luther maintained that onlyGod granted forgiveness, and that it was given freely. One might imagine, then,that in continuing to support Luther, Frederick would have dispersed hiscollection of relics post-haste. He did not. The collection remained in place atWittenberg until after his death, when the silver was melted down to raise moneyfor a war. Despite a modern sense of cognitive dissonance, it must be admittedthat reformist zeal and reliquary veneration could coexist, at least for a time.images [images/f0157-01.png]55 Lucas Cranach the Elder, ‘Margaret Reliquary’, from Dye Zaigung deshochlobwirdigen Hailigthumbs der Stifft-Kirchen aller Hailigen zu Wittenburg(1508), woodcut, 19 × 14 cm.Part of the reason for Frederick’s amassing of relics must have been that suchassemblages were central to the perceived piety and nobility of the collector.Wittenberg was not just a public or ecclesiastical collection, it was also atestament to Frederick’s character and the prestige of the electorate. Frederickand his brother and heir, John the Steadfast, are depicted in an etching on thefrontispiece of the pamphlet (an interesting variation in medium and aninnovation by Cranach), and the introduction to the text of the book lists manyof the royal, noble and ecclesiastical donors, beginning with Philip VI and thethorn. But the collection also served Frederick’s personal devotions as well.The chapel was the family burial place and Frederick further commissionedCranach in 1510 to paint an altarpiece dedicated to the Virgin that includedportraits of himself and John, clearly relying on the frontispiece. Theseportraits, on the wings of the triptych, show each of the brothers presented tothe Virgin by a patron saint.Certainly not by accident, Frederick’s patron, St Bartholomew, is wellrepresented in the relic collection. The knife that Bartholomew holds as anattribute in the altarpiece copies one that is extant in the relic collection,and the Apostle Bartholomew, renowned for surviving a torture of being flayedalive (he was later crucified upside down), is represented by a silver figuralreliquary depicting the saint holding his flayed skin. Finally, and mostimpressively, Frederick owned a monstrance reliquary of Bartholomew that held 45relic particles, and also displayed a relic purported to be ‘all the skin of hisface’, presented in a way that is reminiscent of the Veronica image of Christ’sface (illus. 56 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig56] and see illus. 41[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig41]).One cannot imagine a more vivid devotional experience for the pious elector thanto have been able to gaze at this relic/image, which Cranach’s workshop hasdepicted with eyes that were capable of looking back. A second image, anengraving by Cranach marked prominently with the elector’s coat of arms,imagines Frederick praying to a living St Bartholomew next to the relic of theskin. Presumably, Frederick approved and encouraged the dissemination of hispious image via the new graphic ‘mass’ media in both the Heiltumsbuch and thisand other prints.images [images/f0159-01.png]56 Lucas Cranach the Elder, ‘Reliquary of Bartholomew’s Face’, from Dye Zaigungdes hochlobwirdigen Hailigthumbs der Stifft-Kirchen aller Hailigen zu Wittenburg(1508), woodcut, 19 × 14 cm.Even if, in the last years of his life, public display of the relics had ceased,one imagines that Frederick would have been reluctant to give up this testimonyand access to his protector and patron Bartholomew. Only after Frederick’s deathin the 1540s or ’50s did Wittenberg become a Protestant stronghold. Again,ironically, the Cranach workshop reused some of the woodcuts from the pamphletin Protestant projects, including a Eucharistic monstrance image adapted as anillustration for the title page of the publication of a sermon by Luther, ‘EinSermon von dem hochwürdigen Sakrament des heiligen wahren Leichnams Christi’ (ASermon Concerning the Blessed Sacrament of the Holy and Authentic Body ofChrist).Other collectors eagerly picked up the standard that the House of Wettin haddropped. Particularly active as collectors in the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies were the Catholic princes of Bohemia, Spain and Portugal. Again, theywere interested in many things besides relics – books, paintings, lavish burialsites and gorgeous architectural settings for their collections – but relics andreliquaries retained a status as the most treasured objects in theseassemblages. Hugh Trevor-Roper expressed dismay that the Gonzaga, when underfinancial stress, would sell paintings in preference to letting go of theirrelics, lamenting, ‘they were not self-respecting princes [but] disreputableex-cardinals whose ruling passion was not for works of art but for mistresses,relics, food and drink, and, above all, dwarfs and parrots’.6[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref6] A more historical assessment would reveal thatrelics were the very basis of these collections constructed to exhibit thepiety, learning and taste of rulers and, as I have argued in the case ofFrederick, may have been the objects closest to the princely affection.On another note, one might speculate a love of parrots may have similarlyexhibited learned interest – that is, interest in the New World. Indigenouspractices of feather art imported from colonies were quickly put into service tothe Church, creating high-status gifts, and even ornament for relics survivingas part of European collections.RELICS AFTER TRENTSo, if we admit that relics are not just for show, despite their often veryshowy display, how are we to understand their post-Tridentine reception? Tostart, we should not assume that the deluge of relic-acquisitions andreliquary-making that occurred in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries wasnot motivated by sincere devotion. Sforza Pallavicino, the seventeenth-centuryJesuit friend of Bernini, maintained that, although it only served to point inthe correct direction, art is an essential pathway to the divine. In Spain, StJohn of the Cross summed up the post-Tridentine position this way:The use of images has been ordained by the Church for two principal ends –namely, that we may reverence the saints in them, and that the will may be movedand devotion to the saints awakened by them. When they serve this purpose theyare beneficial and the use of them is necessary: and therefore we must choosethose that are most true and lifelike, and that most move the will to devotion.7[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref7]Although John emphasized the ‘true’ and the ‘lifelike’ in art, allegory as wellas aesthetic qualities such as variety and beauty were also important. Theintention was to simulate Paradise, a destination, however, that is always outof reach. It was the viewer’s obligation to pursue the goal in his or herspiritual meditation.If this ‘system’ of the Baroque can be characterized as recursive or folded,where truth is intimated but hidden, in which we are invited to savour thegorgeous surfaces, the intricacies, the artistic gifts to the spirit,8[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref8] as we will see, reliquaries are a privilegedmeans to the pious ends. They maintain the contemplative gaze through theirmaterials and beauty; they display the truth (the relic) but also hide it.The Reforms of Trent did however lead to important changes in the practice ofthe cult of relics and its arts. If once again the depiction of the Court ofHeaven in Paradise was the primary goal, now the cult of saints was subordinatedto the Eucharist, which was proclaimed to be the primary witness and realizationof the sacrifice and blessed presence of Christ. (See a quite literal example atAndechs, illus. 54 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig54] above, where reliquaries arearranged around a central monstrance containing miraculous hosts.) Bishops wereeven known to have rearranged churches to take emphasis away from long-veneratedlocal saints’ bodies and to turn the ceremonial and spatial focus towards theuniversal and the sacramental in the form of the host.9[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref9] Although, by theological definition, Christ’sblood, bloodied miraculous hosts and the host itself were separate things, whensurrounded by other relics, any of these could sufficiently and spectacularlystand for Christ himself.10 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref10]Innovations in reliquary-making flourish in this period in the guise ofinnovation in both media and form. A flood of fine metal-work, especiallyelegant silver figural reliquaries (as evidenced by the reliquaries ofWittenberg, see illus. 55 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig55]), testifies to the richproduction of German and eastern European silver mines, and the obelisk,appearing across Europe in many different media, stands out as a newly popularform (see illus. 58 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig58]).Just as in earlier periods of reliquary-making, particular forms could haveallegorical or metaphorical meaning; at this moment, the obelisk seems tosatisfy the need to express something essential about relics. Already in theeleventh century, Thiofrid of Echternach had described the pyramid, whose shapeconsisted of four aspirational edges, as leading the mind heavenwards. Theobelisk of the Renaissance and Baroque period is even more elegantly and‘precipitously’ aspirational. Like the flame of a candle it resembles, it leadsthe mind directly to God. The monumental Vatican obelisk in Rome was even‘venerated . . . as a sort of relic, a silent witness to the slaughter ofChristian martyrs in the circus of Nero and an object that had soaked up theblood of the Apostle Peter himself’.11 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref11] As anancient pagan object converted to Christian ends in Rome by Pope Julius II, itnot only served to represent post-Tridentine triumphalism but also appealed tothe archaeological interests arising in the sixteenth century and later.But, although triumphalist Rome may have popularized the obelisk form, ratherthan innovation in shape, post-Tridentine and Baroque reliquaries are mostdistinguished not by their singular form but by their appearance in spectacularensembles. In communion, the many voices of the saints and their accumulatedtestimonies to holiness ‘sing together’ to celebrate the divine and transportthe viewer to Paradise.Jesuits were particularly instrumental in finding inventive ways to celebrateorthodox religion, and large numbers of relics and sacred materials oftenfeature in their innovative spectacles. Among such displays, the 40 Hourscelebration, the renewal of pilgrimage (especially in Germany), the elaborationof the triumphalist Corpus Christi celebration, and the display of reliccollections, especially in Spain and Portugal, are particularly strikingexamples.12 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref12] Even if the lost collection ofWittenberg has been instructive as to issues of devotion, we must look tosurviving ensembles to understand the full physical magnificence ofpost-medieval reliquary display.Although relics continued to be carried in procession and made up a majorcomponent of the 40 Hours devotions, in general in Rome reliquaries are notfound in permanent configurations of public display. Instead, they were in somesense withheld from view while other artworks – most often paintings orsculptures – were offered instead. One can find this approach exemplified in theworks of Michelangelo (see illus. 9 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig9]); in themagnificent set of paintings depicting the miracles of the True Cross in Venicein the Grand Hall of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista by Carpaccio,Bellini, Perugino and others; as well as in Bernini’s famous sculpturalensembles in St Peter’s.Each of these stands as an impressive example of the manner in which the powerof relics was amplified by a magnificent sculptural or narrative presence, whilethe relics or reliquaries themselves remained out of sight. It has beensuggested, indeed, that the occlusion of the sacred may have served to magnifythe power of the Catholic hierarchy, while at the same time managing spaces andexcluding groups such as women who were perceived as uncontrolled, perhapsuncontrollable, in their impassioned reception of the holy.13[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref13] However, if Rome as a centre of ecclesiasticalauthority turned away from much of public reliquary display, other Italianlocations such as Naples revelled in it and perhaps even allowed it as a meansof access to power for women.SPAIN AND THE ESCORIALBefore we discuss the later Baroque displays in Naples, we turn to one of themost influential of late Renaissance reliquary exhibits – the Escorial – anensemble that perfectly melds royal ambition and post-Tridentine devotion toboth the Eucharist and the saints. Indeed Philip II, the Spanish monarch andpatron of the Hieronomite monastery dedicated to Lawrence (also the site of theroyal chapel), had the distinction of being the only king to attend meetings ofthe Council of Trent, and was the first to accept the decrees. He began thebuilding of the Escorial precisely when the Council ended in 1563,14[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref14] as if directly inspired by it.Believing the Spanish to be a chosen people, Philip’s dearest ambition was toremake Spain as the most Christian of countries and Spain itself as the centreof a Catholic empire that extended to England and Belgium. He intended theEscorial to be the heart of this new spiritual (and political) body. There canbe no doubt that in Philip’s Spain, as in Germany, the political and thespiritual travelled hand in hand. The Escorial was founded by the king toprovide an environment of continual veneration of the host and to house PhilipII’s extraordinary collection of relics, books and art. Monks were to pray inlaus perennis, without ceasing, while the life-size gilded bronze figures of theroyal family joined them in this prayer, the statues depicted kneeling andgazing towards the host Tabernacle or, as the Spanish called it, the custodia,visible on the altar from all points in the church (illus. 57[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig57]). The host in turn was surrounded with gorgeousecclesiastical ornamentation: an enormous retable replete with painting andsculpture, and a large reliquary cupboard at either side of the altar. FedericoZuccaro, an Italian painter who worked at the Escorial, knew very well that thecustodia in the altar retable quoted the renowned Roman building, the Tempietto,writing that it was ‘similar to that of Bramante at San Pietro in Montorio’.15[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref15] This direct visual citation clarifies the overtsymbolism of the Escorial. The complex was meant to evoke the ideal proportionsand measurements of the Temple in the Heavenly Jerusalem, and this miniature‘temple’ structure situates the host in the centre of a space of contemplation.Thus, as is consistently the case in the creation of such sacred spaces, thearchitectural tabernacle on the altar at the Escorial makes a double reference,pointing both to the distant sacred (Rome and Jerusalem) and the local (Spain)and this latter reference is reflected in its manufacture. The custodia wasdesigned by the basilica’s Spanish architect, Juan de Herrera, and althoughexecuted by the Milanese Jacopo da Trezzo, it was made in red and green jasper,rock crystal, gold, silver and gems, with an inscription that emphasizes thatthe materials were indigenous to Spain.The dedication ceremony of the Escorial as documented in contemporary sourceswas extraordinary, in part borrowing from the post-Tridentine celebration of the40 Hours devotion to the Sacrament. This ritualized devotion consisted of fortyhours of continuous prayer, and churches, especially in Rome, created specialeffects of ornament for the event, including special temporary structures aswell as relics and lights clustered around the host. Similarly, at thededication of the Escorial, reliquaries crowded the altars and more than 5,000lamps were lit. The lighting was so dramatic, in fact – with lamps placed ineven the very high windows like great ‘necklaces’ of gold – that the church wasvisible from a distance, again for the lucky spectators a vision of the HeavenlyJerusalem.16 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref16] Sigüenza, the monk chronicler ofthe Escorial elaborates on the effect on the interior:The light and burning splendour of the custodia with its appearance of a flamingbrazier reflects in the eyes and pierces the soul . . . it introduces a greatmarvel in the spirit because one has the impression of entering into anever-seen glory . . . without doubt there is no heart so hard or shut away fromGod that [in the presence of this experience] does not soften and dissolve intotears of spiritual sweetness . . . reverence mixed with joy raises hearts todivine praise of God’s glory.17 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref17]images [images/f0166-01.png]57 Juan de Herrera (architect) and other artists, main altar and surround, RealMonasterio de San Lorenzo, El Escorial, Madrid, 1579–85, precious marbles andjasper, gilded bronze, oil on wood and other materials, 26 × 14 m.As at Karlštejn, great crosses were embedded in the walls with candles in frontof them. Sigüenza links them in number (twelve) to the Apostles and in nature toChrist, calling them portals.18 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref18]Although the dedication ceremony was memorable and emphasized the riches ofrelics in the monastery, again, except on special feast days, the relics werenot customarily visible. For the treasure to be seen, the large paintingscovering the cupboards had to be opened (illus. 58 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig58]).However, the cupboards, it should be noted, were also accessible from the back,to the monks and to the king, who would sometimes visit them during the evening– the royal bedroom was linked to the space by a corridor behind the right-handcupboard.Philip loved his relics. Making use of pontifical letters of permission andagents across Europe, he collected over 7,000. Sigüenza gloated that many camefrom Germany, having made their way in secret through Protestant strongholdswhere sometimes, surely by the working of divine providence, miracles occurredthat marked their power. In one instance, a crowd of as many as 3,000 Calvinistsunknowingly ‘escorted’ the relics across the city of Frankfurt as if inprocession, and they then passed through Germany without incident, despite theviolent intentions of ‘heretic dogs’. When the four ‘large boxes’ arrived inSpain, they were processed around the city of Madrid and displayed in front ofthe palace with the host in the centre and six male skulls to one side, sixfemale to the other and the king presiding from a window above. Elaborateceremonies marked their arrival and their addition to the already ‘preciousjewels’ in the Escorial. Philip was especially interested in St Lawrence, theearly Christian, Spanish dedicatee of his monastery and patron of Peace, and hemade an attempt to ‘reassemble’ the body by collecting all the relics he couldfind.images [images/f0168-01.png]58 Relic cabinet (on north side of main altar), El Escorial, Madrid, 1579–85,precious marbles and jasper, gilded bronze, gilded wood and other materials;painting: Federico Zuccaro, Annunciation, 1585–8, oil on panel, 488 × 289 cm.His agents also collected ancient books, and royal bodies (for interment at thisnew royal burial site), but above all the king cherished his relics and he waswilling to pay princely sums to ‘save’ relics from the hands of heretics (thatis, Protestants). He is said to have ‘known’ each and every one of his relictreasures and to have spent time contemplating them, arranging and rearrangingthem, even washing them and of course kissing them. When sick, he used them like‘prescriptions’, specific relics for specific ailments. He especially prized hisrelic of the Magdalene and those of saintly kings such as Constantine andCharlemagne. As an educated man, however, Philip took the Tridentine positionthat even if some of his relics were false, if properly venerated, theveneration could do only good for the soul. As he was dying, he was surroundedby the favourites from his precious collection and his daughter used them in anovel way to attempt to prolong his life: when he drifted into unconsciousness,she shouted, as if to an intruder, ‘Don’t touch the relics!’, in order to rousehim to a defensive alertness.The Escorial surely stands out as an extraordinary example of the weavingtogether of sacred space, relics, sacramental devotion and extraordinaryornament in the form of painting, sculpture, pietre dure, silver and gold, allin support of a heavenly vision. Moreover, it should be recognized that thisheavenly vision is meant to have a literal aspect. Sigüenza commented that thebuilding takes the form of the Heavenly Jerusalem, while also referring toNoah’s Ark and the Desert Tabernacle. In striving to create a national historyand to be leader of a national Church, Philip espoused ideas of Spain as a NewJerusalem and went so far as to send scholars to Jerusalem to study its divinegeography. He also carefully studied a model of Jerusalem that was made for him,using the practice as a spiritual exercise (again the spiritual exercise of‘measuring the Temple’).Across Spain, and especially in Castile and Galicia, the Escorial served as aspiritual, educational and architectural model. In Monforte de Lemos, theCardinal D. Rodrigo of Castro, Archbishop of Seville and son of the countess ofLemos, built the ‘Escorial of Galicia’ with a facade almost as impressive andmassive as its model, completed in 1619 by the architect Simón de Monasterio.The compound echoes the grand architecture of the Escorial, similarly containinga school, a library, a chapel and picture gallery, a monumental stone stair, afamily burial place, and of course a relic collection, embedded in the retableof the westernmost chapel in the north aisle.Similarly, at Celanova, the monastery of San Rosendo was rebuilt by Jesuits inthe image of the Escorial with a cloister and a school in a somewhat softenedversion of the Escorial’s architectural style, all constructed in a lighterstone but with similar mouldings, corners, pilasters, dome and, again, even amonumental staircase. At Celanova, another collection of relics was embedded inthe primary altarpiece.In the many Escorial-inspired designs in Spain, while the collection of relicswas important, it was clearly subordinate to a unified vision – indeed,subordinate to the Eucharist. One should note additionally that, aligned toPhilip’s ambitions for Spain, these ensembles, these institutions are monumentsto the future, to education and learning, rather than testimony to a‘superstitious’ past.SÃO ROQUE, LISBONThe most impressive use of relics and reliquaries reflecting the culturalinfluence of the Escorial emerges, however, not in Spain but in Portugal, at thechurch of São Roque in Lisbon. During the time Philip reigned as king of bothSpain and Portugal, he visited Lisbon frequently and was involved in significantbuilding projects, even taking some part in the building of São Roque, althoughhe was not the first king to involve himself in that church’s fortunes.During a plague period, the Portuguese king Manuel I had solicited a relic of StRoch from Venice for his city of Lisbon. Following the recognition of itshealing power and the construction of a hermitage for its veneration near theplague cemetery at the top of one of Lisbon’s hills, the Jesuits, just beginningtheir mission in Portugal, obtained the newly desirable site for their firstchurch in 1553. The church was designed by Afonso Álvares, master of works forKing João III, and then completed by the Italian Filippo Terzi, under Philip II.In terms of São Roque’s relic treasure, however, the donor was not Philip, butD. João (or Juan) de Borja (1533–1606), who in his capacity as Philip’sambassador to the court of Rudolf II in Prague was the recipient of manyrelic-gifts from his associates there.Juan was the descendant of a pope, and the son of a Jesuit saint. His father,the Duke Francisco de Borja, had been converted to a life as a Jesuit by thesudden death of the Empress Isabella of Spain, and gone on to serve as thatorder’s third superior general. Francisco numbered among his manyaccomplishments the founding of the Jesuit mission of education and thetransformation of the Lucan icon, the Salus Populi Romani (see Chapter Three[08_Chapter03.xhtml]), into a Jesuit image that was copied around the world. Heeven preached in São Roque in 1553 when the Jesuits took possession. Thus Juan,who had originally thought to give his treasure to the Escorial, in the endfollowed in his father’s footsteps and donated his very rich collection ofrelics to the new Jesuit foundation in Lisbon in 1588.Although the gift was Juan’s, Philip’s concurrent activities cannot be ignored.At the time, Philip was in Lisbon, preparing the Armada for his attempt toconquer England – part of his Europe-wide campaign for Catholicism – and such agift must have seemed auspicious. The ceremony of donation was lavish. Twelvelitters were filled with reliquaries, at least five hundred people took part inthe procession, and spectators numbered in the thousands, coming from all overthe country for the occasion. The procession involved multiple stops withperformances of stories and poems written for the ceremony; the participantsthreaded their way through multiple triumphal arches along the route. The crowdwas enthusiastic, reaching out to touch the reliquaries, especially withrosaries, thinking to ‘catch’ a saintly blessing. All in all, the ceremony tookan entire day, and crowds continued to visit the church to view the relics for aweek. The pope granted São Roque four Jubilee indulgences a year in recognitionof the potential of its relic treasures.The artistic response matched the ceremonies in its exuberance. Over the nexttwo centuries, each of the chapels was ornamented in turn, one more lavishlythan the last, drawing upon royal donations and other riches derived fromPortugal’s increasing colonial wealth. The relic collection came to be embeddedin, or perhaps one might say encrusted upon, the very walls of the chapels. Mostof the chapels are seventeenth century, although perhaps the most spectacularand renowned chapel, that of John the Baptist, was created and fully constructedin Rome in 1742–50 under the patronage of King João V by the artists NicolaSalvi and Luigi Vanvitelli, and then blessed by Pope Benedict XIV, only to bedisassembled and shipped to Lisbon to be reassembled. Its walls and floors areladen with semi-precious encrustations of lapis lazuli, malachite andmicromosaics, but not, in this case, with relics.The largest display of the relics from the donation is housed in thegender-separated relic cabinets at either side of the altar (illus. 59[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig59], 60 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig60]), recalling perhapsthe relic display Philip organized in Madrid, mentioned above, and also that atthe Escorial. Originally covered by canvases and doors like those at theEscorial, the cabinets today have nineteenth-century glazing. The dedications ofthese altars were, on the left, ‘All Saints’ and, on the right, the ‘11,000Virgins’ (of Cologne). There were regular feasts for veneration at the altarsduring the ‘Jubilees’ mentioned above, as well as on other occasions, and onvarious feast days, relics were removed to be displayed on other altars in thechurch. But in the remaining chapels in the church, many of the relics wereperpetually visible. They literally found places in the walls, in columns and inportable reliquaries tucked into niches or situated on altars.images [images/f0173-01.png]59 Primary altar and Holy Martyrs altar (female), 16th–18th century, glass addedto relic cabinet 1898, Igreja de São Roque, Lisbon.images [images/f0173-02.png]60 Holy Martyrs altar (male), 16th–18th century, glass added to relic cabinet1898, reliquaries: primarily polychrome, gilded wood, Igreja de São Roque,Lisbon.The placement of relics in walls had precedents in churches in the Middle Ages,especially in Constantinople, Rome and Cologne (see illus. 30[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig30]), but at São Roque the walls of the church are quiteliterally built with the saints (illus. 61 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig61]). TheChapel of Our Lady of Doctrine, for example, was dedicated by the Congregationof the Oficiais Mecânicos in 1634 during the time of King Pedro II of the Houseof Braganza, who re-established sovereignty over Portugal and reclaimed itswealth as a colonial power. Pedro and his wife Sofia of the Palatinate hadalready demonstrated their devotion to the Jesuit order by sponsoring ornamentfor the tomb of St Francis Xavier in distant Goa. In a time-honoured queenlygesture, Sofia even made textiles with her own hands. No expense was spared forthe chapel in Lisbon – it is enclosed with an ebony balustrade (a cleardemonstration of colonial wealth), its walls are lined with relics incompartments, while a glass sarcophagus glows beneath the altar.Similarly, the Chapel of Our Lady of Piety (illus. 61[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig61]), founded in 1686 by Martim Gonçalves da Câmara (andproviding the place of his burial), was decorated with a gilded retablo between1707 and 1716 by the Confraternity of Our Lady of Piety, incorporating an olderstatue of the Pietà. Again, under the altar, a glass sarcophagus contains asculpture, this one representing Our Lady of the Good Death. Statues of Longinus(with his spear) and Veronica on the side walls welcome devotees to the chapeland ‘cabinets’ of reliquaries are integrated into the sculptural ornament.The two glass sarcophagi positioned under the altars in these chapels, unlikemany similar examples in Rome (compare to St Robert Bellarmine in San Ignazio),do not display relic bodies but, following Spanish artistic tradition, holdpolychrome sculptures. In the Chapel of Our Lady of Doctrine, the sculpture is astriking image of the suffering Christ of a type made famous by the Spanishsculptor Gregorio Fernández (illus. 62 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig62]).19[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref19]images [images/f0175-01.png]61 Chapel of Our Lady of Piety, 1686–1716 and 19th-century additions, sculptedand gilded wood and other materials, Igreja de São Roque, Lisbon.images [images/f0176-01.png]62 Gregorio Fernández, Cristo yacente of El Pardo, 1627, polychrome wood, ivory,glass, cork and cornamenta (bull’s horns), 183 × 73 cm, originally in the CasaProfesa de la Compañía de Jesús, Madrid, now in Museo Nacional de Escultura,Valladolid, Spain.This sculptural type clearly makes reference to the host as the Corpus Christi.One of a series of such sculptures, from Aránzazu, was placed in a similar glasssarcophagus, which was termed a tabernaculo in the contract (1629).20[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref20] Another in Lerma (1609), among the earliest bythe Fernández shop, held a vial of Christ’s blood donated to the monastery bythe queen, Margaret of Austria. The vial of blood is secured with a gold plaqueinscribed ‘Sangre de Christo’. In a reliquary-like manner, the vivid polychromyof this type of sculpture draws attention to Christ’s side wound in its statusas a visual testimony, while recalling the related Passion narrative of the cureand conversion of Longinus through the blood. ‘Fernández did not produce theperfect likeness of a dead corpse, but that of a spiritual or pneumatic bodythat would continue to pour blood and water in front of the eyes of theconvert’; that is a miraculous body, ‘an exception to the rules of nature’.21[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref21] Evidence suggests that these statues were attimes removed from their altars, that they served in liturgies that re-enactedthe entombment and Easter resurrection and therefore we must understand themwithin such ‘tabernacula’ as equivalent to the host and close in meaning torelics.At São Roque the devotion to the Eucharist is completed with a chapel dedicatedexclusively to the Sacrament, rounding out a spectacle of relics and devotionthat is clearly supported by colonial riches of extraordinary extent, andsurvives as one of the most lavish and extensive relic displays of the Catholicworld.THE SACRISTY OF ALCOBAÇANot far from Lisbon, another reliquary collection makes similar claims todevotion to the Sacrament. The Cistercian and royal monastery of Alcobaça,founded in 1153, was endowed with many relics during its long history, and themonastery added to its capacity for display of its treasures through theconstruction of a lavish reliquary chapel under Abbot Constantino de Sampaio(1669–72, illus. 63 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig63], 64[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig64]).22 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref22] Although thereis no direct evidence that King Pedro II endowed the chapel, it should be notedthat royal interest in the abbey was strong; in addition to earlier royalburials at Alcobaça, a series of royal portrait busts were created for themonastery at this time.Although a ‘New Sacristy’ had been constructed to accommodate the monastery’streasures under King Manuel I (unfortunately, because of a fire only one doorwayremains of the Manueline structures), the chapel represents yet anotheraddition, extending from the far end of the functional Sacristy space. Toeffectively display the prestigious collection of relics, the abbot added anoctagonal room, taller than it is wide, the walls of which are literally clothedin reliquaries. Nestled into an elaborate wooden architectural framework ofcolumns and niches, a few pre-existent wooden polychrome head reliquaries weresupplemented with almost one hundred figural, bust and arm reliquaries inpolychrome terra-cotta (illus. 65 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig65], 66[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig66]).images [images/f0178-01.png]63 New Sacristy, 1669–72, Alcobaça Monastery, Portugal.images [images/f0179-01.png]64 New Sacristy (vault), 1669–72, Alcobaça Monastery, Portugal.images [images/f0180-01.png]65 New Sacristy (detail), reliquary of St Sebastian: polychrome terracotta,glass (now missing: wooden arrows?), Alcobaça Monastery, Portugal.Construction in terracotta, a relatively unusual medium for large-scalesculpture, made use of local technique and local craftsmen, probably from asuccession of workshops. The largest figures, the seven full-figure sculptures,each weighing many hundreds of kilograms, were sliced into transverse roundsafter construction to facilitate drying, firing and transport. There were also82 busts fabricated, including the original seven in polychrome wood, andfourteen arms. Today only 68 busts and ten arms remain in the altarpiece; a fewmore are in storage. In addition to the ornamentation of the reliquary chapel,the workshops produced a large multi-figure group in a chapel in the church andthe series of royal portraits mentioned above. Given the humidity of thislocale, terracotta seems to have been a sagacious choice. Wood may not havelasted and the polychrome ceramic creates a lively effect that has survived forcenturies. Once more, that effect is the simulation of heaven on earth centredon an altar – but here one experiences a benevolent heaven populated byattentive saints under a masonry dome with an oculus that dramaticallyilluminates the space and vividly recalls a more famous Pantheon (see illus. 64[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig64]).images [images/f0181-01.png]66 New Sacristy (detail), 1669–72, reliquaries: polychrome terracotta, glass,varying sizes, Alcobaça Monastery, Portugal.In addition to the serried ranks of shaped reliquaries, the space is furtherstudded with relics behind tiny glass windows embedded into attached columns andother of the architectural details. Although, given the presence of the altar,this could be seen as a 360-degree gilded wooden retablo, it is also aglorified, oversize reliquary cupboard from which, as the broken fingers on manyof the arm reliquaries attest, the reliquaries could be removed for liturgicaluse and processions. The polychromy of the figures amplifies the sense of theirpresence, and the individualism of their portrait characterizations – varietiesof age, dress and station – adds to the effect. Indeed, rather than look uponthese images from a distance, one sees these figures as the saints themselves.Most look down upon the spectator or meditate, but just enough twist and turn,towards one another, or in gentle decorous torment, that the effect is not atall repetitive. While in this chapel we are in their space, immersed in theiraura, their beatific world. The environment is remarkably hospitable, creating acertain reluctance in the spectator to leave the presence of these amiableresidents of the court of heaven.SPANISH CUSTODIASThe manner in which many of the post-Tridentine relic displays insistentlycentre on the Mass, the altar and the host is consonant with a practice we havealready seen in earlier eras, where host receptacles themselves overlapped inpurpose and form with reliquaries. This sort of overlap is amplified in thecustodias of Spain, initiated with the glory of the custodia of the Escorial,and literally reaching ever greater heights in a series of custodia created forSpanish cathedrals – the Toledo custodia is almost 3 metres (10 ft) tall (seeillus. 67 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig67], 68 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig68]; see alsoillus. 56 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig56]).The portable tabernacle from Valladolid made specifically for the Corpus Christicelebration is a good example of such an elaborate custodia. Juan de Arfe, itsmaker, was responsible for some of the richest such objects in Spain – those inSeville, Avila and Valladolid – and was a member of a renowned German family ofgoldsmiths. Not just an artisan, in the year he made the Valladolid custodia –1587 – Juan also wrote a book of architectural theory, Varia commensuración parala esculptura y arquitectura. He also carried the banner of the Brotherhood ofSt Eloi, the sainted goldsmith, in the Corpus Christi procession in 1593 inBurgos.23 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref23]Juan’s custodia is a sophisticated example of sacred architecture consisting offour storeys which alternate circular and polygonal plans, and Ionic andCorinthian orders. The lower (multi-platformed) pedestal, upon which the goldenmonstrance is displayed, includes a figural group of Adam and Eve and thirtyepisodes from the Old Testament in relief, all prefiguring the Eucharist. Thesecond level again includes reliefs, now depicting the life of Christ, and afigural representation of the Assumption of the Virgin. The third and fourthlevels have obelisks, small figures and suspended elements, including bells thatwould have enlivened the object when it was carried.The arches of the first level are decorated with emblems. One impresa, inspiredfrom the Corpus Christi liturgical hymn Lauda Sion Salvatorem, once attributedto Thomas Aquinas, includes the sun reflected in a mirror, and branches with thewords QUOD NON VIDES. It may be related to emblems used by the Medici, CANDORILLESUS (purity unharmed), referring to love but also to purification and thefire created by putting a lens or crystal in the sun. Clearly, the emblem hererefers to light and vision, but also references sparkling silver.images [images/f0184-01.png]67 Juan de Arfe, custodia of Valladolid Cathedral, 1587–90, silver, gildedsilver and gems, 161 × 64 cm, Museo Diocesano y Catedralico de Valladolid,Spain.The presentation of the custodia surrounded by lights and by candles, reflectedin the glowing gold and gems of the monstrance, which holds the host, fulfilsthe description of the Escorial display by Sigüenza, cited above. Juan himselfwrites in a treatise he published on his Seville custodia: ‘The custodia is arich temple . . . representing the triumph of Christ’ and the holy of holies,and Bezalel is the ‘true artificer chosen by God for his perfection, bothartisan and intellect’.24 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref24] Of course here Juancompliments himself as parallel to Bezalel but also clearly links the tabernacleto the Ark and the Temple.The Valladolid custodia self-reflexively demonstrates its own meaning. The areaaround the host in this ‘temple’ is populated with viewers, the small silverfigures identifiable as the saints who were granted the grace of visions of thedivine during life, and now thereby serving as models for viewers in this life.Following the lead of these devotional figures, we gaze into the sparklingbrilliance that is at the centre of the custodia, having purified our souls byacknowledging our sinful state (along with Adam and Eve), and perhaps ‘measuringthe tabernacle’ as an act of contrition.Such exquisite objects were the focal points of the Corpus Christi processions,the most important feast of the year in Spain (as well as other countries acrossEurope), and an event of such consequence that secular and ecclesiasticalauthorities had to cooperate. The feast was thus a source of civic pride andunity. In Seville, where another custodia by Juan de Arfe was used in theprocession (illus. 68 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig68]), the celebration of the feastgrew in importance and complexity until, in the seventeenth century, it lastedan entire week rather than the prescribed day. The processions on the feast daywere the highlight of the spectacle. The order of the participants was carefullyorchestrated: in 1454 twelve choirboys led the procession with torches, followedby four men dressed as prophets, then a boys’ choir with many among them dressedas angels, two portable organs, all the relics of the cathedral borne onlitters, and floats known as Roca with mechanized tableaux (with ropes andpulleys!) depicting groups such as Christ and the Virgin, various saints and theEvangelists. Finally the host in the custodia was processed, borne on a carriagedesigned to represent the Ark of the Covenant. The procession concluded withChurch dignitaries, followed by the city council and finally the nobility.images [images/f0186-01.png]68 Jenaro Pérez Villaamil, The Corpus Christi Procession Inside SevilleCathedral, 1835, oil on canvas, 100 × 72 cm.By the sixteenth century, sources mention that among the participants of theprocession were figures dressed as dragons, the tarasca, representing the devil,other monstrous figures, heroes and villains, and people who danced. Singers andinstrumentalists were paid by the city ‘in order that on the day of CorpusChristi, from the time that the Custodia exits from the cathedral until itreturns, there will be no absence of music in the procession’.25[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref25] As a finale, plays were performed in the townsquare for which there were prizes for the best performance. The ceremony was solarge that provision for street cleaning and awnings for spectators werenecessary.Thirty crosses, one from each parish, were included in the sixteenth-centuryprocession, as were representatives of the confraternities. The custodia itselfwas placed on a litter, on a cloth shot with silver, and with an honour guard oftwenty-four priests. The litter was carried on the shoulders of a chosencofradia, whowere so cleansed and purified physically and spiritually as is required to carrysuch majesty on one’s shoulders, and they carry it so evenly that it does noteven seem that they are moving, due to the pause and gravity with which theybear it.A painting from 1835 by Jenaro Pérez Villaamil, now in the Fundación BancoSantander in Madrid, depicts the procession as it concluded in the mysteriousdarkness of the cathedral, the custodia glowing in all its silver glory, matchedonly by the clergy in their magnificent robes; the boy dancers, like ‘angels’,perform the seises (see illus. 68 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig68]). The altar isbedecked with a silver ‘throne’ and many candles, some proffered by cherubs, andsurrounded by a tapestry canopy of honour edged with gold; it awaits the host,which is in the process of being transferred. Too numerous to count are thebanners, flags, candles and spectators of every walk of life crowding into thecathedral, some falling to their knees in awe – including a pilgrim, a noblewoman and a gorgeously vested ecclesiastic. The custodia glitters for a reason –it is a perforated temple, built to contain the sacred and life-giving host thathas just spread its beneficence, protection and healing power throughout thecity and is now praised by the dancers who chant ‘brightness of light eternal .. . inaccessible light! . . . fire of love ineffable!’ as the setting sunflooding in through the doors illuminates its brilliance.26[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref26] Rome protested against excesses, but Sevillerefused to give up this ecstatic and elaborate ceremony.VIRTUOSOS OF THE SACRED: ‘MINOR ART’ AND NAPLESIn so many of the relic ceremonies and ensembles thus far discussed, we havedwelled quite persistently in the realm of the so-called ‘minor arts’ – we havelooked at ephemera, at ceramics, figural and ornamental carved wood, metalwork,marble work, as well as many other ‘crafts’. Very little of this superlativelybeautiful material, consigned to the designation of ‘decorative arts’, hascaptured the sustained attention of art historians; nevertheless it is essentialto the history of reliquaries.In another divergence from art history as usual, but following the lead of ahistory of reliquaries, the city that is perhaps the centre of the fine arts inthis period, and certainly a centre of theory and art criticism – Rome – hasbeen largely ignored in this account. Such an omission may be justified with theobservation that the Eternal City was not as rich in overt or permanent relicdisplays as more distant capitals; at the same time, the material on so-calledperipheries has proved surprisingly rewarding.Although not so far from Rome, perhaps Naples is just such a peripheral site.Under Spanish dominion in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, it grew to bethe second largest city in Europe after Paris and was host to many renownedartists. Nevertheless, the lack of an art academy in the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries, along with a simultaneous cross-breeding and creativeinterchange of the arts, allowed a virtuoso magnificence in the making ofreliquaries in Naples that placed such ‘minor arts’ at the top rather than thebottom of the hierarchy of the arts. Even anonymous artisans could find theirplaces in such a situation. Women, for instance, worked as embroiderers of thespectacular fabrics that rivalled silverwork in the production of sumptuoussurfaces.27 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref27] Such exertions towards mastery bypious craftsmen brought materiality to an apex in this age of unparalleledartisanal splendour in relic display.One stunning instance of such gorgeous materiality, the Tesoro, or Treasury, ofSan Gennaro, is located in the south transept of the cathedral of Naples (illus.69 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig69]). The Tesoro makes use of precious substances thatresonate with the local cult of the saint who is uniquely associated withmaterials and properties – blood, fire, water and metal – and through anaffinity of such matter was seen as protection from the eruptions of Vesuvius.Begun in the early 1600s by Francesco Grimaldi, the chapel includes the work ofmany artists, among them José de Ribera, responsible for St Januarius at theFurnace (1646, at the lower left of illus. 69 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig69]). Thealtarpieces are painted on giant sheets of copper and the chapel is filled withsculpture, much of it in the form of silver reliquary busts depicting the manypatron saints of the city. Finally, the chapel includes the renowned bronzecancello, or gate.Upon the gate a twinned Januarius (evocative of his namesake the God Janus who,two-faced, looks both ways at the New Year) ‘erupts’ towards us from theexterior and the interior: he is thus present in the Tesoro but also in heaven,both approving of the interior of his glorious chapel and blessing us as weleave – a boundary guard, marking the crossing point from heaven to earth. Thisgate can be seen as active, even transformative – when closed it seems to expandoutwards as if pushing towards heaven, but simultaneously it also pushesinwards, in a gesture of welcome. The materials speak to the saint’s essence:images [images/f0191-01.png]69 Treasury Chapel of San Gennaro, interior view from above looking towards themain altar, 1608 and 1770, Naples, Italy.shapeshifting bronze is a good analogical material for the blood of San Gennaro:from something solid to something liquid and back again . . . the gate extendsthe division itself and works to stage the chapel as a chamber oftransformation.28 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref28]That is, in this gate one also sees an evocation of the famous medieval headreliquary of Januarius made in 1304 for Charles II of Naples, and in thatevocation one is reminded of the ceremony in which the blood relic of the saint(in a second capsule-like reliquary) is brought out on the feast day to interactwith his ‘head’ in this very chapel. The ‘usual miracle’ is to be hoped for:that is, that the blood should liquefy and provide intercession for the city,the phenomenon of boiling as equivalence to fervent prayer. Perhaps the changingand miraculous substance might control ‘poorly behaved matter’, the lava, theplague and other perils of the city. It is matched by the brilliant, refined andglorious matter of the chapel.29 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref29]WALDSASSENAlthough Spain, Portugal and Italy were central to post-Tridentine Catholicdefence against Reformation attacks, we cannot overlook the importance ofBavaria and Bohemia, especially as territory that was contested and in partreclaimed from Protestant domination. Again, as in other ardently Catholiccentres, architects, painters, sculptors, metalworkers and artists of all kindsworked together to create heavenly spaces to display relic treasures.In decided contrast to the hiddenness and subsequent epiphanic revelation ofearlier medieval reliquaries, at the Baroque Cistercian monastery of Waldsassen,today a papal basilica, the saints and their relics emerge in plain view (seeillus. 70 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig70]–73 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig73]; also seeillus. 3 [05_Introduction.xhtml#fig3]).30 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref30]Within a gorgeous environment conceived by the Bohemian architect GeorgDientzenhofer, of the famous family of architects working from Prague, andcompleted by Abraham Leuthner in 1685–1704, the relics take their place as thefoundation of the glory of the church. They are displayed in the clearest ofglass, as the very foundation of the edifice that rises on the saints’insouciantly reclined and lavishly enrobed backs. As bejewelled and bedecked,carefully posed courtiers, skeletal remains perform in what can only be calledthe Court of Paradise. Rising above them is every sort of artistic device –large canvases representing saintly action, heroic sculptures boldly‘supporting’ soaring architecture, effusions of lavishly sculpted stuccovegetation, domes, elliptical voids and windows that pierce the skin of theenclosure allowing in sacred, illuminating, diffuse light (illus. 70[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig70], 72 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig72]).If one is fortunate enough to stand in this space while the organ roars, oneknows one occupies a numinous space, an alternative realm. One might be temptedto say that the effect is without surface, as the skeletons without their skin,but in truth surface dominates, shiny and magnificent, in the gold, the silver,the stucco, or even the spectacular clothing of the saints themselves. Eachlayer is filled with ornament and variety, and tempts the eye with illusionism;only the faces of the skeletons themselves seem to offer access to a pensive anddark interior.The Gesamtkunstwerk culminates in the main altar where the mirrored sphere atits centre (illus. 71 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig71]) seems to represents God’s eye,which reflects the church with golden benevolence. (When this sphericaltabernacle is opened, the visible edges look like nothing so much as eyelids!)The reflection in the orb ‘holds’ the whole of the ‘reality’ of this artfulParadise but also returns a view of an alternative space that beckons andintersects with our own (reminiscent of the purpose of the mirror in the secretcentre of a Shinto shrine). In some sense, the sphere becomes the reliquary wediscussed above, the reliquary that holds itself aloof but also both revealedand ‘concealed parts of space . . . often . . . revelatory . . . which serves togenerate consciousness . . . by virtue . . . of the interplay of reflections andmirages within [space]’.31 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref31] The relics serve toconstruct space but the effect is one created by the entire church as reliquary,the Ark or, in its lavish effects, a multiplication of ‘arks’ in the Temple.Although its effect is wonderfully unified, Waldsassen was built in stages, duein some part to the prolonged process of acquisition of relics and theirinstallation from 1688 to 1766. The magnificent mirror-like globe of thetabernacle is, in fact, the oldest part of this decorative ensemble. It wasexecuted in 1690 by Carl Stilp, the first work of a local sculptor.The Holy Bodies (heilige Leib), or Roman martyrs, at Waldsassen are a veryspecial sort of relic that came into being in the Baroque period, perfectlyrealizing a theatrical expression and love of materials of the era (illus. 72[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig72]). Of all relics these might be the most ‘material’themselves, for they are whole bodies, completely visible, completelyaccessible, in a sense ready to converse with the devotee. It is not uncommonfor an entire well-preserved corpse to reside below the altar in a Baroquechurch, but these are a variant to that practice; the bodies were imported toBavaria in their hundreds from a newly opened cemetery on the Via Salaria Novain Rome. They were unearthed there in 1578, when the Jordani cemetery was openedand began to virtually spew forth bodies of persons assumed to be martyrs. Eachbody was found with a tiny vial supposed to testify as martyr’s blood; a greatpopular devotion arose in response to the discovery.images [images/f0194-01.png]70 Georg Dientzenhofer and Abraham Leuthner, interior, Cistercian Abbey ofWaldsassen, 1685–1704, now Waldsassen Basilica, Bavaria, Germany.images [images/f0194-02.png]71 Carl Stilp, tabernacle and main altar, 1690, Waldsassen Basilica, Bavaria,Germany.images [images/f0195-01.png]72 Johann Michael Hautmann, apostle altar, 1751, north aisle, WaldsassenBasilica, Bavaria, Germany.images [images/f0196-01.png]73 Adalbert Eder and others, remains of St Maximus (detail), 1734–66, bones,glass, silver, gems, paper and other materials, Waldsassen Basilica, Bavaria,Germany (see illus. 3 [05_Introduction.xhtml#fig3]).The Church of Rome was not initially enthusiastic about the anonymous ‘martyrs’,but as their cult grew it took responsibility for ‘christening’ them with namesrevealed in visions, as well as promoting them. They were feted withprocessions, triumphal arches, lavish litters and jubilee columns, becoming thedevotional centre of a giddy material and spiritual celebration of triumph,ready and able to repopulate the churches of the re-catholicized areas ofGermany. If in the earlier Middle Ages each saint required a vita and clericalapproval, these saints seemed to flourish as a group rather than individually,seen together as the ‘Roman catacomb saints’ whose bodies were whole and entire.In response to their presence and their insistent corporeality, they werecelebrated by being adorned, often by women, in time-consuming acts ofdevotional ornamentation that were wildly multi-media, involving metalwork andgemwork, but also sewing, embroidery and papier roulé. Many examples of theseornamented, articulated skeletons survive, such as the famous figures in Wil inSwitzerland, and another in Rott-am-Inn. At Waldsassen the saints are dressed inthe most sumptuous costumes imaginable (illus. 73 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig73]),and although there is no lack of crowns and lavish goblets, these costumes arenot court costumes. In their details, they are revealed as military garb, makingthe saints milites Christi, soldiers of Christ, fighting Protestant heresy.Furthermore, in some sense these outfits are not clothes but encrustations.Their costumes are constructed of many materials – gold, silver, gems, pearlsand silk, but also paper, board and coloured glass – and made in an intricate,time-consuming assemblage of techniques that has been given the name ofKlosterarbeiten (also see illus. 3 [05_Introduction.xhtml#fig3], 90[11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig90]). Such work was typically done by women, and iscomparable to the artisanal achievements noted above from Naples and with a longhistory in women’s work, especially in textiles. The first of the saints to beinstalled at Waldsassen, St Deodatus, was made in just this fashion, ornamentedby Frau Magdalena Sinnerin in 1721. (Not a nun, she was paid more than 456Gulden for her efforts.) The remainder of the saints at Waldsassen, however,were clothed and posed by Adalbert Eder, a lay brother and apothecary of themonastery, who set about the time-consuming task as devotional work – that is,‘prayer with the hands’, or as I would like to call it, aesthetic prayer – justone effort in the multi-part symphony of the arts that makes Waldsassen such asuccessful evocation of Paradise (illus. 74 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig74]).32[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref32]images [images/f0198-01.png]74 Adalbert Eder and others, saints Vitalinus and Gratianus (north transeptaltar, saints on either side of tabernacle picturing the Ark of the Covenant),1734–66, mixed media including bones, glass, silver, gems, paper and othermaterials, Waldsassen Basilica, Bavaria, Germany.SILVER IN PRAGUE; BONES IN SEDLECAlthough reliquaries have always been made of materials that captured andreflected light, in the Baroque age, as at the Escorial, as at São Roque and asat Waldsassen, light and vision is primary: it could be realized by sets ofchandeliers, of candles and candleholders of all sorts, and also by the play andmanipulation of exterior light through windows and domes and screens, even bytheatrical lighting. Statues could be taken outside the church yet stillsurrounded by ‘luminous crowning[s] of stars and clouds’.33[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref33] This might seem to be a medieval aesthetic, butwhen whole shrines were covered in silver, the effect went far beyond thatachieved by the subtle glow of materials like mosaics. Although the virtuallyfloor to ceiling metal revetment of the chapel of St Nicholas in Bari has beendisassembled,34 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref34] perhaps the ensemble dominatingthe ambulatory of the Cathedral of St Vitus in Prague celebrating St JohnNepomuk can be used to recall such an effect (illus. 75[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig75]).images [images/f0199-01.png]75 Fischer von Erlach, Tomb and Shrine of St John Nepomuk, silver, 1729, StVitus Cathedral, Prague.It was designed in 1736 by Fischer von Erlach who, not content just to constructthe saint’s shrine in glittering silver, also literally joined the force of thegaze with the power of illumination by suspending a witnessing crowd of silvercherubs and angels who draw back long curtains of sumptuous fabric, creating acrowning tent-like ciborium. The architect further lit the ensemble usingenormous silver candlesticks ready to accommodate veritable columns of fire andsupplemented all this with giant clusters of hanging silver lamps. The resultingcreation of a focus of devotion plays upon pre-existing elements of the space,for example the presence of an architect’s self-portrait (see illus. 75[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig75], left, rear) who, attached to his handiwork, thesupporting arch of a 1493 royal oratory, turns to pray towards the saint andextends a red glass oil lamp. Modern-day tourists serve as witnesses as well,drawn in by the spectacle.35 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref35]Fischer von Erlach had to work with a predetermined location where the saint wasoriginally buried, replacing two earlier shrines at this same spot. This finaleffort was commissioned by Emperor Charles VI, and reportedly used over 1,500 kgof silver. On the lower section, narrative scenes remind us of the saint’s life– he was famously martyred by being pushed off the Charles Bridge on the ordersof Emperor Wenceslaus IV (a dispute over the confirmation of an abbot, latersaid to be a dispute over the inviolability of Confession). The sarcophagusitself is supported by angels and virtues, with benches below to accommodatethose who wish to venerate the saint. Although in its design the shrine relieson Italian wall tombs, here, set free of the wall, the ensemble spins intospace, soaring upwards and dominating the geography of the ambulatory. (So muchso that today visitors have to pass in single file.)I compare this fanfare of silver with a symphony of bones – a very different butperhaps even more powerful substance that insists on its own materiality.36[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref36] The city of Kutná Hora traces its origin to thefirst Cistercian monastery in Bohemia, Sedlec, founded in 1142 as a dependencyof Waldsassen. Today’s chapel, located near the All Saints cemetery, containsthe bones of between 40,000 and 70,000 people. This is not a collection of therelics of saints, but the bones of Christians hoping for salvation, many of whomdied in war or the plague and wished to be buried here because the abbot of themonastery had travelled to the Holy Land under the orders of Ottokar II ofBohemia (c. 1233–1278) and returned with earth from Golgotha, which he sprinkledon the cemetery.images [images/f0201-01.png]76 Sedlec Ossuary (interior), former Cistercian Monastery of Sedlec, c. 1400,1703–10, 1870 (bone decoration by František Rint), Kutná Hora, Czech Republic.This is not an unusual scheme for the relocation of the holy. The same strategywas employed by Helena to sacralize the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme inRome. But Sedlec is distinguished by having become the most desirable burialplace in central Europe. The chapel itself was built c. 1400 with a lower storeyto accommodate the bones, which were organized into mounds. It was rebuilt in1703–10 by Jan Santini Aichel, and in 1870, after the secularization of themonastery, František Rint organized the bones into a kind of sculpture, leavingfour of the mountainous mounds as the corners of the ossuary (illus. 76[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig76]).The completion of the skeletal ornamentation is therefore of a rather late date,but represents the continuation of earlier history at the site. Furthermore,such ossuaries and their ornaments are a distinctly post-Tridentine phenomenon.In Evora in Portugal, the Capela dos Ossos was built in the sixteenth century bya Franciscan who wanted to create a memento mori. An inscription at the entrancereads: ‘We the bones that are here, await yours.’ The ossuary of Fontanelle,Naples, has an even more intriguing story: there the skeletons, like those ofWaldsassen, became saints through interaction and hope. However, rather thanclerical blessings, these bodies were ‘sanctified’ by the devotions of thefaithful.Masses of anonymous corpses were buried in the cave at Fontanelle, especiallyafter the plague of 1656. Ecclesiastical recognition came from Father GaetanoBarbati, who in 1872 organized and cleaned the crypt and began the ‘paying ofrespect’ to the dead. Townspeople eagerly joined in, began to adopt skeletonsand skulls, care for them and decorate them; subsequently the lay people haddream visions about the identity of the corpses. This allowed the faithful tointeract in a very intimate way with the ‘captain’, the bride, the monk andothers. The cult was suppressed as fetishistic in 1969, but the site is openagain to tourism and today such ‘bone art’ is attracting widespread interest.THE CHAPEL OF THE SHROUD, TURINFrom a nineteenth-century culmination of the exploration of bones asrepresentation, bones as persons, even bones as decoration, we return to a lessmacabre ensemble of relics that is reminiscent of the royal aspirations to powerof the late Middle Ages. With the Chapel of the Shroud in Turin by GuarinoGuarini (1668–94, illus. 77 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig77], 78[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig78]), we take up once more the story of the acquisitionof Passion relics by rulers and turn to one of the finest buildings ever createdto house such relics.Not ‘the isolated architectural tour de force it appears’, the Turin chapelfunctioned as an extraordinary ‘instrument for political identity formation andfor state building for the Savoy [dynasty]’, showcasing ‘the only relic inEurope that still commands international attention’.37[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref37] Such a combination of aspiration to uniquenessand desire for artistic achievement, with an objective of political, especiallyroyal, promotion, has been the aim of many of the reliquary ensembles we haveexamined. Motivations such as these have been a consistent engine of creativityin the service of reliquary display and production. Because of his genius, andthe significant gestures at differentiation in his design, Guarini’sextraordinary results do argue for success; the chapel does indeed strike theviewer as ‘unique’.The Savoy considered the Shroud to be the greatest of all the Passion relicsbecause, as an almost ‘narrative’ relic, it showed the effects of all thePassion relics and remained unequivocally whole, unlike the multiply splinteredand disseminated True Cross and Crown of Thorns. Supposedly won in an unnamedbattle, the Shroud first appears in records as a 1356 gift to the church atLirey by a crusader knight, Geoffrey de Charny. The bishop of Troyes attemptedto suppress a flourishing cult and pilgrimage, and the Shroud left Lirey underthreat of war. After some wandering it was finally acquired by the Duke ofSavoy; undoubtedly money changed hands.Like his relic-collecting ancestor Louis IX, Louis of Savoy, inspired byCrusade-era relic prestige and his nominal claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem,saw an opportunity and invested in it. He acquired papal certification andindulgences, and the relic was at first frequently offered up to view. Thisprocess was eminently successful, winning prestige for the relic and funds forthe Savoy, even necessitating the building of a special chapel. In that chapel,located to the east of the main altar of San Giovanni, the cathedral of Turin,the duke continued to maintain control over the relic’s exhibition as he held atleast one of the keys that allowed the relic grate to be opened for access.After the building of the monumental reliquary chapel, however, the relic wasdisplayed much less frequently. The reason may be that the dynasty achievedroyal status in 1697, three years after Guarini completed construction.The relic Shroud was strongly identified with its material, an identity thatallowed it a remarkable flexibility of use and symbolism. For example, it seemsto have served as a military standard. Charny, who first won the cloth inbattle, may have in a sense fulfilled this significance as he was one of thebearers of the oriflamme (the famous French battle standard associated with theAbbey of Saint-Denis). By the eighteenth century, the Holy Shroud was depictedin prints as the Duke of Savoy’s own battle standard, paralleling other famousrelic standards, such as Constantine’s cross.38 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref38]In its status as a potentially enveloping cloth, the Shroud was alsosymbolically conceived as a royal mantle that could wrap kings as it had Christ.Finally, commemorative prints affirmed the material nature of the relic, notonly by depicting the Shroud hanging as a banner in ritual display, but byprinting ‘souvenir’ images on silk.images [images/f0204-01.png]77 Guarino Guarini, dome of the Chapel of the Holy Shroud, interior, 1668–94,Cathedral of St John the Baptist, Turin, Italy.images [images/f0205-01.png]78 Guarino Guarini, engraving of elevation, Chapel of the Holy Shroud, Cathedralof St John the Baptist, Turin, Italy.An example of such a print by Antonio Tempesta (1613), now in the BritishMuseum, depicts the press of the crowds, the excitement of the nobility and thedignity of an ecclesiastical honour guard of seven bishops who hold up theoversize relic (the duke and duchess stand just behind them, illus. 79[09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig79]). Tempesta’s print also shows another ritual thatmagnifies the effect of the presence of the relic. Devotees throw the specialPassion rosaries, so-called corone di Christo, at the Shroud, hoping to transferits power to their personal and private implements of devotion, and attendantsat the ends of the platform drop the rosaries back into the outstretched armsrising from the crowds. What is perhaps most intriguing is how the imagehighlights the holy relic quite literally by leaving the miraculous image inreserve in the chiaroscuro effect produced by using both woodblock and engravingprinting techniques on the silk, a wonderful manipulation of the possibilitiesof print ‘technology’.images [images/f0206-01.png]79 Antonio Tempesta, The Annual Display of the Holy Shroud in Turin on 4 May,after 1593, etching and woodcut printed on silk, 42.6 × 62 cm, British Museum,London.The figure of Christ, so difficult to see on the actual object, in this printseems almost to glow. As Alfonso Paleotti wrote in 1599,The celestial splendor which flashes from the most holy effigy of Christimprinted on the Shroud is redolent of, not human, but divine artifice. Somekind of hidden energy shines out of the sheet and fills those who look upon itwith heartfelt stupefaction . . . wounding the heart of the beholder with thedagger of remorse, dissolves him in tears . . . a certain radiance in the Shroudis a thing divine.39 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref39]Elsewhere the marks on the sheet are compared to the light of the stars. TheTempesta print, perhaps purchased within sight of this event (and combined witha Passion rosary), itself is very close to a tertiary relic, reproducing theeffect and emotion of the sight of the relic.The Shroud may have possessed such wonderful visual possibilities preciselybecause of its size and again its ‘flexibility’. Although it had a reliquary – arather small one as the object was usually rolled up – it is almost as if it didnot need one, and indeed, a simulacrum of the relic was typically on publicdisplay while the relic itself lay locked within the shrine. During itsostentations, once unfurled, the relic itself could serve as a banner with its‘narrative image’. As a sizeable piece of cloth (437 cm × 111 cm/14 ft 4 in. × 3ft 8 in.) that ‘took part’ in the Passion, it could be featured in iconographicrenderings of the Passion being used to lower the body into the grave, cradlingthe body during the Pietà, or as a means for angels to transport the body afterthe death on the cross. As a full-size image of the body of Christ, one couldinteract with it as St Carlo Borromeo did, in veneration, kissing the ‘wounds’that had purportedly been created by contact with Christ’s wounds. Members ofthe court were also allowed this devotion. Finally, it could be stitched, asAnne Marie d’Orléans, the Savoyard duchess, did in order to repair it, in aparticularly gendered form of veneration.The Shroud required many supporting hands during an ostentation, thereby unitingthe clergy and encompassing the aristocracy in a common devotional endeavour (asin illus. 79 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig79]). During the first major celebration ofits arrival in Turin, it took part in the 40 Hours devotion and upstaged theEucharist, effectively presented as an alternative body of Christ, whole andentire and celebrated with hourly sermons. In fact, this particular Eucharisticcelebration of the 40 Hours was extended by 24 extra hours to accommodate thethousands of pilgrims crossing the alpine valleys to see the relic, and moresermons were added. Two were delivered by Borromeo, emphasizing properpost-Tridentine doctrine, as the duke, a proper Christian prince, commanded.Although Guarini’s chapel surely deserves praise for its originality, many ofits elements must be recognized as reliant on longstanding traditions of relicdisplay, albeit amplified and made more theatrical. The strategy of creating aseparate and sacred space to the east of the body of the cathedral was used inmany reliquary chapels, notably the Corona of Thomas Becket at Canterbury. Theview of the reliquary above and behind the main altar was a standard displaytechnique as well, used both at the Sainte-Chapelle with its Grande Chasse, andin the display at St Ursula in Cologne (see illus. 29[07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig29], 30 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig30]). The circular shapeof the relic/mortuary chapel was also not unusual (again, compare to theCorona), and in this case, probably recalls the Holy Sepulchre. (The royalaspirations of such a copy are echoed in a contemporary rumour, contending thatthe Medici had plans to capture the Holy Sepulchre, and to disassemble andreassemble it in their mortuary in San Lorenzo in Florence.) As the chapel forthe Shroud of Christ, references to the Holy Sepulchre and burial areappropriate, but as the location of a salvific relic, the stunning manipulationof light is also fitting. Nevertheless, even if these elements are familiar, inits completed form, Guarini’s ensemble was considered ‘miraculous’.Guarini raised the dome high, in part to allow unobstructed light into the manypierced elements of the vaulting (see illus. 78 [09_Chapter04.xhtml#fig78]). Ofcourse, the entire floor of the chapel is also raised to connect to the pianonobile of the ducal palace with access via an eastern door, and to allow thereliquary to rise well above the level of the cathedral altar. Pilgrims had toclimb a set of dark stairs, and turn to finally step into the light of thechapel (as if climbing a tower; think of Karlštejn).Guarini intended, in the architect’s own words, ‘to stupefy the intellect andstun the viewer’. Much of his architecture is illusionistic rather thanstructural, making use of reiterated triangles, prospectively diminishinggeometric forms and elements stacked heavenwards to emphasize, and generallysupercharge, the space. Of course, here as well, he is following the lead andinspiration of others: Borromini’s San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane, and perhapseven the Roman Pantheon; but Guarini’s result makes the effect new.Contemporaries raved, with one calling it a reliquary in itself because of itspreciousness and striking design, and others critiquing it as bizarre and a‘terror’, but all registering its ability to provoke emotions.40[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref40]Ultimately, it was a functional design, presented as beautiful and astonishingprecisely in order to do reverence to the relic and to present it in its properplace within a larger relic display. In addition to the Shroud, the chapelcontained relics of the Crown of Thorns and the True Cross, but also a finger ofCatherine, relics of Maurice, Lazarus, Carlo Borromeo, Mary Magdalene, thevirgin Deodata and others.41 [13_References.xhtml#rch04ref41] The bronze gildedcapitals, highlighted against polished black marble, emphasized the specialtreasures of the collection with images of the Passion relics: the nails, theCrown of Thorns and the tablet inscribed INRI. These pictorial details literally‘support’ the relic that, in effect, binds them together, and devotionalexercises to be practised in the chapel took the devotee systematically throughthe Passion stories.The chapel was originally intended to include frescoes of the Passion that werenot realized, but devotional engravings do survive that depict how the Shroudwas thought to function as a sort of ‘map’ of Passion devotion. Such prints showthe image of the body of Christ with a series of keyed letters linked to Passionnarratives. They further surround the central image of the Shroud with the armaChristi, or even supplement it with a frame of Passion rosary prayers,explicitly designating these prayers as an ‘offering’ for the relic.42[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref42] Clearly the Shroud was presented not only as anobject that was part of the Passion, but also as the ultimate sign of Christ’ssufferings and the summation of the Passion – therefore the most prestigiousrelic of all.The Savoy dynasty, first as dukes, then, as they claimed, as kings of Jerusalemand Cyprus, were charged with the care of what they perceived as the greatest,most integral and most precious of relics. They worked hard to make it elusive.Once it was enclosed in Guarini’s chapel, as noted, it was rarely shown (48ostentions in the seventeenth century, five in the eighteenth). In publicostentions by 1686, it never left the palace; that is, the Savoyards rebuilt thepalatial buildings allowing access via elevated halls to an ostention platformbetween the Piazzetta Reale and the Piazza Castello, allowing the relic to beshown without ever descending to the streets. The court could occupy thisgrandiose ‘high ground’, wealthy citizens could purchase space on elevatedbleachers, but hoi polloi created a near chaos of joy in the streets. The ritualwas played out as entirely under the control of the duke/king and his master ofceremonies, from access via keys, to the very ordering of each ostention,masterfully manipulating the public’s desire to see this precious relic. Thisdegree of control allowed the Savoyard dynasty to turn the Shroud into their‘icon of authority’, and they used it as an excuse to create a superbly orderedcity – not the usual outcome of the enthusiasms of pilgrimage, but then thesedevotees have been characterized as ‘subject-pilgrims’.43[13_References.xhtml#rch04ref43]As a result of tight Savoyard control, the Shroud has maintained its prestigethroughout the centuries. In the ostention of 1842, not only was the glory ofthe relic recaptured after French suppression, but its support of the Savoydynasty was re-established. In an echo of early plans in the era before GuarinoGuarini’s chapel, the addition in 1850 of a series of dynastic tomb monumentsplaced in niches that had up to then housed ex-votos transformed the chapel froma shrine into a mausoleum.Once the new processes of photography revealed that the Shroud is essentially a‘negative’, the transition from royal to popular relic was complete. The relicbecame the definitive possession of the papacy in 1983 and, beginning with theostention of 1978, the Shroud itself was spotlit and immobile as visitorsstreamed past in silence, a complete change from the circumstances of earlierviewings. The setting promoted ‘optimum visibility’ and a scientific attitude;there were 3,333,000 visitors. In 1997 the chapel tragically burned just as arestoration was completed, the wooden scaffolding feeding the flames. Today, onehopes that the chapel will be restored. Meanwhile, a scenographic painting abovethe altar of the cathedral recreates something of Guarini’s original effect andshowings of the Shroud itself have continued – in 1998, 2000, 2010 and 2015. TheShroud even has its own logo, booking website and catchphrase – ‘The GreatestLove’ (visits are free). Somehow all this is both a tragic and yet fittingtransformation of the most spectacular of relic presentations of thepost-Tridentine era."},{"pageContent":"5RELICS DESTROYED, RELICS RETURNED, RELICS REINVENTED: THE FRENCH REVOLUTION,NAPOLEON, CELEBRITY, THE PHOTOGRAPHAFTER THE RELIGIOUS UPHEAVAL of the Reformation and the coming of a newEnlightenment emphasis on scientific thought and reason, for many people, relicslost their power. They were branded as superstitious and objects of derision.Notwithstanding such widespread intellectual disdain, within the still powerfulCatholic faith, relics were never rejected and the faithful continued to findthem fascinating and worthy of veneration. Furthermore, regardless of faithpositions, ‘reliquary strategies’ – that is, means and modes of presentation andperformance that had been generated by centuries of artistic and cult production– continued to have prestige and indisputable power. During the modern period,these strategies lay behind the formation of a cult of celebrity and itswide-ranging material expression so important in our contemporary world.It has been suggested that the concept of ‘celebrity’ was invented in theNapoleonic era, around the person of Napoleon as well as other important figuressuch as Keats and Byron, Voltaire and Mozart.1 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref1] Iwould argue that, just at this moment, the western European instinct to createand venerate relics was transferred from the sole domain of religious venerationto include secular obsession with the events and emerging celebrities of theera. In order to understand this cultural transformation of relic to treasuredmemory object, of saint’s legend to biopic, we’ll look at the relic-ingsurrounding the Revolution and Napoleon himself – that is, in France in theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Although similar trajectories could surelybe traced in England and elsewhere, for example with the celebrity of Napoleon’snemesis the Duke of Waterloo, or that of Bonnie Prince Charlie whose life can beunderstood as more like that of a Catholic saint, strongly associated as it waswith the divine right of kings. A consideration of revolutionary mementos andthe objects in Napoleon’s orbit provides a particularly vivid andwell-documented example.The French Revolution is usually considered to have been virulentlyanti-religious and destructive of all things having to do with the practice ofCatholicism. However, given that the revolutionaries themselves were raised inthe environment of Catholic spectacle and ceremony, it should come as nosurprise that very soon after the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789,‘patriots’ envisioned certain material and ceremonial possibilities within whatcould only be called a relic-mode. Later that same year, the parochial church ofSaint-André-des-Arts distributed blessed bread with the image of the Bastillestamped on it. And remarkably, a self-proclaimed patriot, Pierre-FrançoisPalloy, having secured the right to demolish the building that had been stormedand besieged by the revolutionaries, began a business in what has been termedthe production of ‘souvenirs’.2 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref2] Like thedistribution of the blessed bread, however, this project represents theexploitation of a culture forged in the consumption, experience andunderstanding of the material sacred, especially relics and reliquaries. Indeed,Palloy argued that he was preserving ‘sacred’ memory.None of the stones of the Bastille were wasted; they were used to build thebridge of ‘Concord’, but also, in a more complex aspect of the project, tomanufacture and preserve the memory of the now absent and long-detested monument(illus. 80 [10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig80]). As if marketing the stones, Palloyorchestrated a remarkable series of events that commemorated not the Bastilleitself, but its destruction, and in that destruction the foundation of Liberty:in other words these events celebrated the absence of the Bastille.images [images/f0214-01.png]80 Unknown artist, model of the Bastille, 1789–90, stone, 37 × 95 × 98 cm, MuséeCarnavalet, Paris.The first spectacle is reminiscent of Old Testament narratives of origin, and asecond more ambitious initiative was more clearly modelled on New Testamentprinciples of mission. On 23 February 1790, Palloy organized a civic processioninvolving 750 workers, followed by drummers, soldiers and heroes from theBastille battle terminating at the Hôtel de Ville. ‘In triumph’, the processiontransported ‘a model of the Bastille, carved from a stone of the demolition andwell and perfectly executed . . . they received the acclaim of the crowds’.3[13_References.xhtml#rch05ref3] At the Hôtel, Palloy delivered a speech andintroduced the artisan that had made his model, a man not otherwise known but incontemporary reports named Dax. (Not inconsequentially, Dax is a nameoriginating from a town in southwest France that was founded by the Romans; inother words, it is not Christian.) Dax proclaimed that he was a ‘stonecutter,but the liberty that you have rebirthed is propagated in me and has given me theidea of making this little monument . . . encouraged by the divine fire of his[Palloy’s] patriotism’.After this speech recalling the humility and divine inspiration of artisans ofthe Middle Ages, or even the biblical Bezalel, who was chosen to build theTemple, Dax’s work was consecrated. The Parisian municipal architect praised thevirtues of labour:every blow of the hammer, made by these brave workers, is an homage to liberty,and breaks a link in the chain of our slavery; the Bastille has disappeared;already the astonished eye searches for the place where it was, but its namewill be immortal.He then demanded that the terrible name be forwarded in history, passed frommother to child, harboured in the breast, so that it might serve always as aspur to action if liberty is threatened. The Bastille thus is characterized, insome sense, as the anti-Temple, preserved in memory, never to be rebuilt, but aninspiration to faith.If this ceremony recalls the Old Testament, a second spectacle employing therelic-stones-turned-models follows a New Testament narrative line. Palloy wonpermission from the Legislature in 1792 to send out a group of hand-pickedorators he called ‘Apostles of Liberty’ to take the models and theiraccompanying explanatory materials to the 83 departments of France, to spreadthe word to the provinces. Along with his models, he sent out plans of theBastille, fully annotated, and also included ‘implements’ of his now sacredanti-Temple – tiny metal cannons and grilles for the windows. As with theremains of saints or other sacred persons, these stones of the Bastille, nowmodels of the fortress, stood for an absence but also for an ever-present powerthat could be invoked at will. Many of the French provinces still exhibit these‘stones’ of remembrance in their departmental museums.It cannot be disputed that much of the story of the French Revolution is one offorces opposed to religion; relics and reliquaries as well as other forms ofmedieval and Renaissance art were destroyed or dispersed in massive numbers,subject to the rage of the people stirred up by the political party known as theJacobins, as well as by the more practical need of the young government forfunds.4 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref4] The Jacobins specifically targetedartwork perceived as ‘signs’ of power. Their discourse acknowledged the beautyof art, but detected danger in its ability to propagate an ideology of theruling class, whether that power consisted of ‘Rome’ or monarchy, or the twoacting together as the French monarchy and the Catholic Church had done so well.As a result, the revolutionaries despised coats of arms and other symbols onseals, buttons and coins as much as they did more monumental expressions ofpower.In quick succession, in November 1789, the Estates-General declared that allclerical benefices and goods were at the disposition of the State, and by theend of the month, all works of gold and silver of the royal chapel, theSainte-Chapelle, were inventoried in order to be turned over to the newgovernment. Some of the relics and other objects went to Saint-Denis, the gemsto the Cabinet des Médailles, the books to the Bibliothèque nationale. Insimilar fashion, art was ‘liberated’ from churches and chateaux for the benefitof the people of France. Some objects were spared destruction for theirhistorical significance (authentics of relics from Saint-Denis) or their beauty(the church of Notre Dame itself). In a somewhat ironic result, the chaos anddestruction of the revolutionary state by necessity gave birth to the publicmuseum, a new institution entrusted with the care of State treasures. AsJacques-Louis David argued, ‘Let us not forget that the culture of art is onemore weapon we can use to awe our enemies.’5 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref5]By 1794 Church lands had been nationalized and many churches closed, theirclergy scattered, and by 1795 Church and State were separated by law. However,in what might also be considered an unexpected consequence of the promise ofrevolution, many of the common people, especially in the provinces, andespecially during the years of 1794–5, argued that their new liberated statusshould allow freedom of religion, and petitioned for those rights – Robespierrehad in fact unsuccessfully urged this approach in 1793. Incidents in whichtownspeople broke the locks on church doors in order to chant the Psalms causedsome local governments to concede such rights, despite pressure to do otherwise.The political rhetoric of the time does not easily break into neat categories ofrevolutionary atheists versus the counter-revolutionary devout. (And of course,one treasury that survives, that of Sainte-Foi of Conques, was saved because itwas hidden by devout townspeople; see illus. 19 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig19].)It is not surprising that a ruler as shrewd as Napoleon Bonaparte recognizedthis complexity. He argued: ‘In every country, religion is useful to theGovernment, and those who govern ought to avail themselves of it to influencemankind. I was a Mahometan in Egypt; I am a Catholic in France.’6[13_References.xhtml#rch05ref6] One of the soon-to-be emperor’s key actions wasto reconcile with the pope in the Concordat of 1801, restoring Catholicism asthe national religion of France and bringing back the pomp and ceremony of theChurch – even if some revolutionaries showed their disrespect by snacking onbiscuits and talking during the solemn Te Deum that celebrated the act.Notwithstanding his reconciliation, Napoleon intended to dominate the Churchrather than to be dominated. Even after he obliged the pope to come to Francefor the imperial coronation, he subverted the carefully planned and stagedceremony by famously placing the crown on his head with his own hands.Just as the revolutionaries had displaced the ceremonies of the Church withrevolutionary feasts and processions that took advantage of familiarecclesiastical forms and practices, so Napoleon used his knowledge of history,and the possibilities of the spectacle of power, to manipulate customary ritesand reliquary strategies to his own advantage. He visited Aachen to reverencethe relics of Charlemagne, and on that trip, as if it were a bit of jewelleryrather than a powerful reliquary that once hung around the emperor’s neck in hisgrave, he had his wife Josephine presented with the famous Talisman ofCharlemagne. She was also offered a piece of the arm of the Carolingian emperorsaint, but replied that she already had a strong arm upon which to lean. FromCharlemagne’s palace chapel, Napoleon carted off the imperial regalia and also aselection of the porphyry columns from the building for use at the Louvre.(After 1815, the Prussians demanded them back.) When he conquered Italy,Napoleon even contemplated taking the relic of the Turin Shroud, but wassatisfied with despoiling Guarini’s chapel and sealing the door to the palace,transferring control over the great relic from the Savoyard dynasty to theChurch and exiling the king.7 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref7]Napoleon was especially interested in regalia. Like Emperor Charles IV, heunderstood that such objects brought legitimacy in the eyes of the people. Hehad both a sceptre and a copy of the Main de Justice made for ceremonial use.The crown for his coronation was newly manufactured but covered with ancientcameos, recalling a Roman heritage of rulership. The crown also carried theinscription, ‘the crown of Charlemagne’, but substituted palmettes fortraditional royal fleur-de-lis ornament (see the upper frame of illus. 87[10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig87]). He had himself crowned king of the Romans in Milanusing a replica of the famous Iron Crown of Lombardy, an ancient (actuallyCarolingian) reliquary crown held at the cathedral treasury of Monza (said tocontain one of the nails of the Crucifixion).8 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref8]He used a copy of the Iron Crown because he was not sure he could pry theoriginal loose to bring it to Milan and, furthermore, because the crown was toosmall to fit, he merely touched it to his head during the ceremony.Nevertheless, a print was circulated that showed him wearing it, and afterfounding an order of the Iron Crown, he wore the order’s medal thereafter (againsee illus. 87 [10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig87]).Finally of course, there was one more relic-crown for Napoleon to appropriate.That was the crown that had already served French political interests so well –the Crown of Thorns. The famous relic-crown was held at the French royal chapelof the Sainte-Chapelle (see illus. 42 [08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig42]). Therevolutionaries, as above, had mostly melted down the treasury for the fortunein gold that its reliquaries provided, although the Crown itself was saved andheld as the people’s treasure (its thirteenth-century reliquary was destroyed).Napoleon returned the relic to the Church in 1806, to the chapter and canons ofNotre Dame, and seems to have sponsored a beautiful empire-style reliquary thatstill survives in the cathedral, although it no longer holds the relic (illus.81 [10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig81]). The canons approved of and had to pay for thereliquary, and it was produced very quickly but not entirely to theirspecifications.The result assumes the appearance of a secular piece of silver-work. On atriangular base that holds a long inscription narrating the itinerary of therelic (which additionally was accompanied by a procès-verbal citing twowitnesses who testified that this relic is indeed the one that originally leftthe Sainte-Chapelle), a spherical container for the relic is supported by threeangels wearing empire-waisted dresses and fashionable hairstyles emulating theantique, looking very much like Napoleonic figures of Victory or Fame (as on thefamous coronation nef, or again see illus. 87 [10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig87]). Thesphere was a motif that frequently occurred on Napoleonic secular images, andwas certainly not the clear crystal container for the relic that was requestedby the canons of the Chapter; its use undoubtedly refers to French imperialambitions as well as being a gesture towards cosmic significance.images [images/f0219-01.png]81 Jean-Charles Cahier, reliquary of the Crown of Thorns, 1806, gilded copper,97.5 × 56.5 cm, Notre Dame, Paris.The Christian imagery on the reliquary is small and difficult to see (forexample, the sacred heart is lost at the centre of a Napoleonic sunburst). Onlya few elements identify the reliquary as Christian: the female figure withchalice holding onto the cross at the summit (not Ecclesia but Faith); the lionof Judah (which Napoleon once supported as a symbolic representation of France);and the inscription that declaims that the reliquary is the ‘RESTITUTION’ of theCrown of Thorns, presumably to its rightful owners ‘the French’. Of particularinterest, perhaps before he returned the relic to Notre Dame, Napoleon assumedthe privilege of the French monarch to distribute thorns, as he must havereserved at least the one he gave to Cardinal Spina(!) at the time of theConcordat in thanks for his cooperation.9 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref9]Napoleon thus demonstrated once again that he was just as capable of puttingreligious relics and reliquaries to use in shoring up his legitimacy as anyFrench king. Where he surpassed them was in his participation, and that of hisfollowers and descendants, in a transformation of the cult of relics into thebeginnings of the modern cult of celebrity, initiating an eighteenth-centurytrend. It is often remarked that preservation of celebrity-owned objects issimilar to the cult of relics, but in Napoleon’s time the boundaries weredemonstrably fluid – a newly found freedom to approach, even touch, the oncesacrosanct relics of the Catholic Church may have emboldened men to createstartling variations of personal relics and memorial objects.Perhaps the most fascinating is an object owned by Vivant Denon, Napoleon’sfirst director of the Louvre museum. An acquisitive aesthete, Denon pursuedbeauty and art wherever he travelled, including trips to Egypt, Italy, Germany –wherever Napoleon conquered. Denon created his own personal collection ofrelics, reusing a fifteenth-century medieval reliquary to house them (MuséeBertrand de Châteauroux, illus. 82 [10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig82]). Removing theoriginal relics from the reliquary’s series of compartments, now covered inglass, Denon inserted labelled relics of medieval persons of interest on oneside: bones of the Spanish hero El Cid and his lover Chimène, bones of Abelardand Héloïse, hairs of Inês de Castro (lover, later queen, of Pedro (Peter I) ofPortugal, buried at Alcobaça) and of Agnès Sorel, mistress of King Charles VIIof France. Perhaps the particular interest in illicit love evinced by thiscollection can be correlated with Denon’s production of erotic literature andengravings, but at any rate it corresponds to the medieval use of relics in whatone might call ‘imaginative’ devotion.In compartments on the other side of the object, we find ‘relics’ ofcontemporary celebrities: a bit of the moustache of Henri IV (a ‘good’ Frenchking who was found incorrupt at his exhumation at Saint-Denis), linen of Turenne(the Marshal of France, respected by the revolutionaries, removed fromSaint-Denis, reburied in the Jardin des Plantes, and then finally reburied byNapoleon in Les Invalides), bones of the literary heroes Molière and Fontaine, apiece of a tooth of Voltaire and hairs of General Desaix.These relics represent a roster of heroic bodies that reveals a rather shockingtrend during the Revolution: the ready exhumation, minute examination andrelocation of even the revered dead. Although a series of engravings depictDenon respectfully burying the remains of El Cid, gone unmentioned is that theFrench first rather unceremoniously exhumed him during the Spanish war, as theydid Inês de Castro, and Héloïse and Abelard, whose bones were then transferredfrom the Paraclete to the Père Lachaise cemetery. Similarly, all the graves ofFrench royalty were opened and despoiled at Saint-Denis, although, out ofrespect, the revolutionaries defended that of Turenne. Also opened were thegraves of Molière and Fontaine at Saint-Joseph, and the body of Voltaire wastransferred to the Pantheon. These ‘corpse-centred enterprises’ could be readilycompared to relic translations – moving bodies to places where they wouldreceive proper respect – but they also evince, on the negative side, in certaincases, a ‘symbolic execution . . . of a convicted elite’.10[13_References.xhtml#rch05ref10] A special attention to but also sometimesdisregard for the dead seems to have been part of the Revolutionary fervour.images [images/f0222-01.png]82 Vivant Denon, reliquary, repurposed 15th-century reliquary with gilded brass,glass, h. 45.7 cm, Musée-Hôtel Bertrand, province of Berry, France.At any rate, it would seem that Denon collected his relics on his travels andduring the execution of his duties and assembled them along with mementoes ofhis leader and friend Napoleon in his reliquary-memory object. That is, innarrow compartments on the short sides of the reliquary are displayed a largeand dramatic signature of Napoleon, part of the bloody shirt from the time ofhis death, a lock of his hair, and a leaf from a willow he used to sit under atSainte-Hélène. Finally, the interior of the reliquary was also stuffed withother various mementoes and pieces of paper. Rather than a simple collection ofsouvenirs, this object appropriates the functions of religious reliquaries andorganizes the souvenirs into a ‘showing’ that presumably was structured toprovoke thought, imagination and, in the case of Napoleon, reverence; truly amemento of many dimensions.These Napoleonic souvenirs, indeed, return us to what must be understood as thepremier body of the era. Even as Napoleon brilliantly explored larger reliquarystrategies in service to his claims for legitimacy, he and his descendantsapplied the same strategies to his own person and the newfound cause of hiscelebrity. It could be claimed that more ‘relics’ survive of Napoleon than anyother modern figure. Napoleon himself was accustomed to disseminating locks ofhis hair during his life and in his will he specifies that his hair be cut andmade into bracelets ‘with little gold clasps’ for each of his relatives, and abigger one for his son and heir. He also specifies that none of his personaleffects be sold and directs that some of them be given to close friends andrelatives; in particular that his gold dressing case, used on the morning ofvarious victorious battles (to prepare his body!), be preserved: ‘it is my wishthat it be precious in the eyes of my son’.11 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref11]Surprisingly, his corpse also participated in customs having to do with royalbodies – at his post-mortem his heart was removed and put in a silver vessel, aswas royal custom. (And apparently, surreptitiously, his private parts were alsoexcised; they recently sold to a New Jersey urologist for a handsome sum.)Napoleon even had plans to be buried in a dynastic mausoleum at Saint-Denis,although these plans did not come to fruition.There is no doubt that Napoleon as man and myth was celebrated after his deathwith a kind of cult, fostered in no small way by his family. Prints circulatedthat designated him as soldier and saint, or depicted him as a martyr to Englishviolence. During his life he likened himself to various classical gods,specifically Jupiter, but it would seem, in a deeply Catholic France of thenineteenth century, patterns of relic-making were more powerful than Greek andRoman myths. (Even Napoleon himself professed his catholicity at the end of hislife.) What is most impressive in this circulation of relics and body parts isthat there seems to be a transference from sacred to secular of not just theimpulse to make relics of these bits and pieces, but also of the idea that thesebits and pieces could be instructive, that a secular leader could be the properobject of meditation, as revelatory of the virtue and truth of a man as a sacredrelic was revelatory of the workings of the divine. In this period the corpsesof kings and of Napoleon (exhumed or recently dead) were studied minutely, akind of physiognomy of the dead.Clothing takes an astonishing place in such a system, far outstripping anystatus as commodity, perhaps because, as Walter Benjamin noted, it was thecommodity ‘closest to the skin’. One complication was its resale (and thus theready assumption of a new identity) but, as we have seen, Napoleon attempted tonegate this issue by forbidding the resale of any of his effects. In HouseholdWords, the magazine edited by Charles Dickens, George Augustus Sala recorded histhoughts about the exhibit of Napoleon’s clothes in the Musée des Souverains,galleries installed in the Louvre by Napoleon III in 1852:the famous redingote gris – the gray great coat . . . I don’t think,intrinsically, it would fetch more than half a dozen shillings . . . yet here itis beyond price and purchase. It has held the body of the man whose name isblazoned on the ceiling; whose initial, pregnant with will and power, N, is onwall and escutcheon . . . This common coat of coarse gray duffel hangs in themidst of velvet and silk, gold and silver embroidery, stern, calm andimpassable, and throws all their theatrical glories into shadow [see illus. 84[10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig84]].12 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref12]Never mind that viewers complained that Napoleon’s camp bed did not belong inthis same display in the Louvre; here his coat, also marked as common andeveryday, participated in the theatre of dress and fashion, but rose abovetransience or exchange. Just as a relic is marked by a reversal of naturethrough the miraculous, this coat superseded fashion. It was ‘calm andimpassable’, the precise words used by Emmanuel de Las Cases, in his Mémorial deSainte-Hélène, the most popular memoir written concerning Napoleon.13[13_References.xhtml#rch05ref13] The coat took on Napoleon’s character and theviewer purportedly could see that in gazing upon it.images [images/f0225-01.png]83 Charles Bouvier, after Charles Auguste, Baron de Steuben, Les Huit époques deNapoléon, par un peintre d’histoire, 1857, etching, 27 × 35 cm.For a man who employed crowns so effectively, perhaps it is no surprise thatNapoleon’s hats survive as prominent relics and as such the subject of painterCharles de Steuben’s recounting of Napoleon’s life through his headgear in LesHuit époques de Napoléon (1826, at Malmaison, here an engraving of thatpainting: illus. 83 [10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig83]). The hats take on ananthropomorphic air, and fittingly ‘Waterloo’ is knocked awry. The Waterloo hatitself survives in Berlin, and another example was displayed prominently amongother articles of clothing on display as ‘relics’ in a case near Napoleon’s tombat the Invalides.images [images/f0226-01.png]84 Napoleon’s hat and greatcoat, Château de Fontainebleau, near Paris.Many other somewhat less expressive relics of Napoleon are presented inreliquary-like frames with labelling authentics (many in private hands).Arguably, even certain of the portraits qualify as relics, especially thosecreated for intimate use by friends – that is, portrait miniatures. Portraitminiatures have frequently been compared to relics by observers who remark onthe intimate way in which one would hold and look at such things, creating asort of ‘intimate vision’, a gaze that possesses the viewer, drawing him or herinto a place apart (ultimately very similar to what Paulinus of Nola describedin looking at a tiny relic of the True Cross in the fourth century).14[13_References.xhtml#rch05ref14]In his treatise on the limning of miniatures, the English painter NicholasHilliard (c. 1547–1619) argued that he enriched his works with silver and goldand even adorned his product with polished gems of the greatest value, ennoblingthem so that they seemed the ‘thinge itselfe, even the work of god and not ofman’.15 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref15] The miniature seems to exist in a spaceof its own, ‘insists on its own mimetic privilege’, and attempts to double itsoriginal. As the minuteness of its reality draws the viewer in, it is outside oftime and point of view and creates a set of specified social relations andintimacies. Because of Hilliard’s mastery – using a brush with a single hair topaint on the skin-like surface of ivory or parchment and employing only thefinest pigments – his paintings seem miraculous, they do not revealbrushstrokes. The result is secret, as Hilliard claims, defended from the gazeof the other, reaching out to ‘protect’ the viewer. In his artist’s manual,Hilliard also insisted upon strict corporal discipline in the painter, animmaculate studio free of dust, and concluded by asserting that the maker shouldnot sign his product. The final product mimics the acheiropoieton, the image‘made without hands’, a miraculous image out of time and above art, and yet witha marvellous and ‘effective’ likeness.images [images/f0227-01.png]85 Unknown English artist, Eye Miniature, c. 1790– 1810, watercolour on ivoryset with two diamond ‘tears’, in frame set with pearls, Victoria & AlbertMuseum, London.One sort of miniature that is only a partial portrait intensifies these effects.Called eye miniatures, because they usually depict a single eye with perhapsjust a profile of a nose, an eyebrow and/or sometimes a lock of hair, theyrepresent a relatively short-lived fashion at the turn of the century. All arevery expressive; some ‘cry’ in the form of attached crystals or diamonds (illus.85 [10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig85]). These are tiny personal pieces of jewellery,probably not worn openly, that capture just a fragment of the body of thebeloved. Given as gifts, as numerous inscriptions attest, they performed thesocial ‘game of looking’, but specifically, like letters, participated in astructure of address. Those with tears generally represented not the living, butinstead a beloved person now departed, as performative dialogic objects thatfollow the structures of elegiac literature, both eliciting and delivering the‘gift of tears’. In some sense, they allowed the dead to act, to look, to be inpresent time.16 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref16]Napoleon and his circle do not seem to have participated in this French fashion,but Josephine’s granddaughter did own a beautiful example of a braceletfashioned with her mother’s hair and fastened with a clasp made of an eyeminiature now in Stockholm. There are, however, many portrait miniatures of theemperor and, indeed, many copies of a particular one painted by Jean-BaptisteIsabey, examples of which are in the Walters Art Museum, and The WallaceCollection in London (illus. 86 [10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig86], 87[10_Chapter05.xhtml#fig87]). This portrait likeness takes special care with thedepiction of Napoleon’s large liquid eyes and the texture of the skin and hair,producing the jewel-like effects aspired to by Hilliard. Napoleon, however, isnot portrayed looking at the viewer as is the case in most such miniatureportraits; he instead looks off to the side in a gaze that seems almost to waverbetween the intimate and the distant, as if his eyes have just turned away,perhaps to attend to a threat on the horizon.Isabey was commissioned to do many paintings for the emperor and empress, andarranged the ceremonies of their coronations; indeed he was responsible for allthe ceremonies and entertainments in the Tuileries, at Saint-Cloud andMalmaison, in his duties as Dessinateur du Cabinet de l’Empereur, des Cérémonieset des Relations Extérieures. In 1805 he was appointed premier peintre toJosephine.This miniature which Isabey painted of Napoleon includes the depiction of amedal of the Order of the Iron Crown which Napoleon founded in 1805 – perhapsthe original portrait was commissioned at that time by Napoleon himself as agift for his wife or a treasured associate. What is remarkable is that, despitethe fact that each miniature in itself would have had an ability to maintain thesense of a palpable and personal connection with the emperor, all of the manycopies of this miniature, many apparently by Isabey himself, could not have beenmade for Josephine – they are too numerous even to have been made for theimmediate family – and thus one can only conclude that these ‘intimate’ objectswere made for a much wider audience.If we look, however, to the example in the Walters Art Museum to think about thereception of the object, we see that it has been framed in such a way that itsfunction has been abruptly shifted away from some of the primary functions ofthe miniature – that is, it is no longer optimal for holding in the hand, orclose to the body and eyes. Instead it is placed in an elaborate, reused olderframe (1808). The assemblage with the frame promotes the image as that of theemperor surrounded by symbols of victory, the Charlemagne crown, sceptre andMain de Justice above, Merovingian ‘bees’ at the side and an eagle below. Theminiature has become a treasure or relic of Napoleon – perhaps it signifies aspecial relationship the owner had with the emperor. Nevertheless, the miniaturecontinues to draw upon conventions of contemporary social practice, but alsocombines them with processes of veneration familiar from a long Catholictradition. The end result has a magnetic presence even if it is not to betouched, even if it does not return our gaze; it nonetheless captures our eyesand ‘fascinates’ us.Although, surely, only the very privileged and wealthy would have had such aminiature of the emperor, it was not only the elite of society who participatedin these trends that we have seen in the ‘relics’ of Napoleon. As scholars havenoted, all miniatures could function in the manner of relics, and many peopleowned them and relied on them to make connections with their loved ones. NatalieHerzen wrote in a letter to her husband in 1837:Looking at your letters, at your portrait, thinking of my letters, of mybracelet [undoubtedly a hair bracelet], I have wished I could skip a hundredyears and see what their fate would be. The things which have been for us holyrelics, which have healed us, body and soul, with which we have talked . . .what will they be when we are gone? Will their virtue, their soul, remain inthem? . . . will they tell the story of us, of our sufferings, of our love, willthey win the reward of a single tear?17 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref17]images [images/f0230-01.png]86 Jean-Baptiste Isabey, Napoleon Bonaparte, 1812, frame 1808, watercolour onivory, miniature h. 4.8 cm, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, MD.It is said that the art of miniature painting died with the advent of thephotograph, only two years after these words were written. But one could equallyargue that the photograph carried the uses of the miniature forward into a newtechnology, a technology that was available literally to all levels of society.Or, if we admit that miniatures had something of a relic function, perhaps thereason the photograph supplants them is that it did the same job so very well.Photographs take over all the qualities that we have discussed in miniatures;they are described as like acheiropoieta, their very manufacture almostmiraculous as it is grounded in the working of light.18[13_References.xhtml#rch05ref18] They are made of a precious material, silver,encased in gilded protective boxes, and can only be seen from the ‘proper’angle, by the privileged viewer (because of the nature of early photographicplates). Moreover, they slot themselves into the place of the miniature in thesocial structures we have discussed; even better, they carry the ‘touch’ of thesitter.As Roland Barthes argued in Camera Lucida, ‘The photograph is literally anemanation of the referent. From a real body, which was there, proceed radiationswhich ultimately touch me.’19 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref19] Contemporaries tophotography’s invention also recognized its indexical power. In 1843, ElizabethBarrett described it as ‘the very sanctification of portraits’ in that ‘it isnot merely the likeness which is precious in such cases – but the association,and the sense of nearness involved in the thing, the fact of the very shadow ofthe person lying there fixed for ever!’20 [13_References.xhtml#rch05ref20]Perhaps the endless reproduction of photographs in the modern world hasdiminished this miraculous sense of presence, but the photograph remains to beexploited for its indexical and relic-like quality. One wonders what Napoleonwould have done with the marvellous new medium if he had lived a few decadeslonger?images [images/f0231-01.png]87 Jean-Baptiste Isabey, Napoleon Bonaparte, c. 1805, gouache on ivory, 5.5 ×3.8 cm, The Wallace Collection, London."},{"pageContent":"6THE RELIQUARY EFFECT: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS AND STRATEGIES OF THE RELICIN TRACING THE CONTINUING AFTERLIFE of the ‘relic’ in contemporary art, ourattention will shift from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century objects that lookand function very much like relics and reliquaries to artworks that insteadenshrine material per se and that explore the possibilities of agency and thesignification of ‘things’ for audiences. These works often lack anything thatcan be identified as a ‘relic’, relying instead on strategies of relicpresentation, what I have called the ‘reliquary effect’.Although presented here in more or less chronological fashion, this artisticproduction once again does not follow a developmental arc. The artists underdiscussion emerge from a society still steeped in relic use and work with oragainst this habitus to think through their art and practice. Given theadmittedly tendentious nature of my thesis, I will follow a somewhat differentcourse from that of earlier chapters, making a more exhaustive argument usingthe work of only three artists, with minimal additional citations of otherartists involved in such a ‘project’. Discussing the work with this limitedapproach will better serve our purposes, avoiding the trap of considering onlythe superficial aspects of reliquary form, but allowing an exploration of howthe ‘reliquary effect’ furthers serious artistic investigation.Of our three principle examples, Joseph Beuys is the least specific in hisreferences to relics, but remains a touchstone for artists of the twentiethcentury and for the emergence of German art from what Theodor Adornocharacterized as its post-Second World War inability to make ‘poetry’.1[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref1] His ‘student’ Anselm Kiefer is more literal inhis references to relic-like things that he has appropriated from a wide rangeof sources. A third proponent of reliquary strategies, The American artist PaulThek calls his work ‘reliquaries’ but such a title begs the question of theirrigorously manufactured contents.Beuys and Kiefer are German and Thek lived much of his life as an expatriate,primarily in Italy, creating some of his most influential work for Germangalleries. Artists using reliquary strategies, however, are not all German, norare they all Catholic. Beuys, Thek and Kiefer were raised as Catholics and Thekpursued his interaction with the Church, at least sporadically, throughout hislife, but none of the works to which we will attend are religious in aconventional sense.It has been claimed, however, that contemporary Catholic artists often produceda sort of ‘crypto-religious’ art – for example, Andy Warhol attended Mass eachSunday and painted a series of the Last Supper. It may be that ‘art asreligion’, or the ‘spirituality’ of art, especially in a Buddhist mode, has beendiscussed with profit in contemporary criticism, but art produced withinChristianity, or any organized religion for that matter, has been treated withsuspicion or even disdain by modern critics and historians. (Thek’s Catholicismis barely mentioned in the recent Guggenheim catalogue.) Fortunately, we willavoid this particular peril, as religious art is not our subject here. Insteadwe are concerned with practices of presentation that have long been associatedwith religious relics but that have been transferred to the realm of art. Thesepractices of presentation consist of: enshrinement and assemblage; displaythrough ceremony or ritual in performance; and hyper-awareness regardingmaterials, whether precious or worthless.We will see that relic strategies enable artists to elucidate a series ofissues: the ‘problem’ of the body, the instantiation of issues of personal andnational history and, perhaps most significantly, the processing of memories ofwar and genocide. As artists pursue a need to materialize and memorialize at thesupra-personal level, the ‘rhetoric’ of reliquaries proves to be a powerful toolin socially engaged discourses of contemporary art.SHOW YOUR WOUND, JOSEPH BEUYSTwo consistently appealing qualities of the relic/reliquary for contemporaryartists are the form’s insistence on viewer participation and its essentialengagement with materiality. As an early adopter of performance art, JosephBeuys (1921–1986) hoped to redefine and ‘extend’ the meaning of art for itsaudiences, disrupting strategies of the aesthetic or the representational.2[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref2] Instead of beauty, Beuys focused on physicalmaterial: ‘the purpose of philosophy is to arrive at materialism. In otherwords, to move towards death: matter. In order to be able to say anything aboutlife, one has to understand death: the methodology of reduction.’3[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref3] Or, as he added, he aspired to the‘transformation of substance [material]’ and wished, like the hare, to dig‘himself into Materia (earth)’.4 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref4]Beuys’s investment in the capacities of both audiences and materials was adecisive and powerful move that resonated for his fellow artists – and hascontinued to resonate and develop in practices such as relational art (orrelational aesthetics) and philosophical approaches such as speculative realism:‘an object is in itself an infinite recess, unknowable and inaccessible by anyother thing’, but ‘two objects can interact through the mediation of a “sensualvicar” [i.e. the artist]’.5 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref5] Beuys’s life andoeuvre must be examined from a broad perspective in order to begin to understandhis use of materials and the way they come to have meaning in his work, as wellas the legacy of that work in the contemporary field.From his earliest work, his active myth-making sensibility imbued Beuys’s artwith personal and, he contended, universal meaning. In the first entry in his‘curriculum vitae’ he ‘denotes his birth’ as an exhibited object/part of hisbody: ‘1921 Kleve. Exhibition of a wound drawn together with plaster.’6[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref6] This entry is a vivid demonstration of ‘hisbelief that trauma is the prerequisite for moral and social health bypositioning “the wound” as a natural state and art as a tool for healing’,7[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref7] as well as a testament to the power of theobject.As opposed to Beuys’s myths about his life, the biographical data are somewhatmore prosaic. Although born in 1921 in Krefeld, Germany, Joseph Beuys’s familymoved to Kleve, a region that was ethnically Dutch and religiously Catholic. Hejoined the Nazi youth and during the Second World War was conscripted into theGerman army, training as a fighter pilot and gunner. During a wartime bombingraid, his plane crashed and he was seriously injured – the central trauma of hislife. After the war, feeling the need to recreate himself both spiritually andphysically, he rejected his early training as a scientist and physician andchose to study art.Beuys was and is a controversial figure, and not only because of his one-timeNazi affiliation. Asserting that ‘Every man is an artist’, Beuys held that artencompassed politics, nature and the creation/recreation of the nature of manhimself. Through an association with artists of the international Fluxusmovement, in particular Nam June Paik, Beuys became an early practitioner of‘happenings’, or performance art, or, as he called them, ‘actions’. Because heinsisted on discussion and audience participation, some of his actions led tostrong, even violent reactions. Often referred to as a philosopher or shaman, hewas renowned as a charismatic teacher but is sometimes accused of being acharlatan.8 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref8] At the time of his Guggenheimretrospective in 1980, the critic Benjamin Buchloh questioned the validity ofthe myths upon which Beuys based his practice and assessed his art negatively.Buchloh’s much-reprinted essay slowed acceptance of Beuys’s work in the U.S.,although it has always been avidly admired in Europe.Another barrier to Beuys’s early critical acceptance was his lack of irony (andhis famous antagonism to Dada and Duchamp), combined with his investment in thespiritual nature of art. Even his primary biographer Caroline Tisdall admittedto having an anti-religious prejudice in a recent interview:In all my earlier writings, I must confess I rather suppressed the Christianangle. Fundamental to his work was the transformation of material and I thinkyou almost have to be brought up a Catholic to use that as a creativeprinciple.9 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref9]It is, indeed, Beuys’s ‘transformative’ use of materials and his ‘immersion’ inthem that makes him central to our concerns. These include the most infamous ofmaterials he employed – felt and fat – as well as materials we have seen inprevious discussions in this book – gold and the cross – and finally a few thatfall somewhere in between – iron and honey. One might object that the cross doesnot qualify as a material, but because Beuys consistently rejects aniconographical approach and sees materials as active rather than static, when heuses a cross-object, it is more than the conventional ‘sign’.Felt and especially fat are constituted as substances of great power in a storythat Beuys forges as his own re-creation myth (much like a saint’s story): arecovery that he casts as a transition from chaos into form. In the plane crashthat he described as a central part of his Second World War experience, Beuyscame down in the Crimea, between the Russian and German lines, and was rescuedby non-combatant native Tatars. His purposefully impressionistic story is vaguebut describes vivid sense impressions:I only regained consciousness completely after twelve days or so . . . So thememories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness . . . Imust have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as theplane hit the ground and that saved me . . . Then I was completely buried in thesnow. That’s how the Tatars found me a few days later. I remember voices saying‘voda’ (water), then the felt of their tents and the dense and pungent smell ofcheese, fat, and milk. They covered my body with fat to help it regeneratewarmth and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep the warmth in.10[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref10]The story, the most central evidence of Beuys’s myth-making activities, isfoundational for his artistic practice.It is a beginning for Beuys, not of a palette of colours or a set of symbols,but of a sensory world of purposefully non-art materials which involve smell,sound and touch and, even more importantly, the operation or potential of thesematerials to bring about transformation. Rather than disintegrate into the‘chaos’ of the war and its world, Beuys was reconstituted by the most primitiveand basic of materials which come to represent for him warmth and nourishment,energy and change, as well as literal and spiritual salvation.Beuys’s use of some of these materials is purposefully shocking. In many works,including Fat Chair (Fettstuhl) of 1977, the artist prized the ability of fat toprovoke reactions in his audience, including disgust (illus. 88[11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig88]). Buchloh’s critique of this piece referred to the‘suggestive and associative quality of anality’ and its ‘infantile’ nature, butBeuys argued that ‘the chair represents a kind of human anatomy, the area ofdigestive and excretive warmth processes, sexual organs and interesting chemicalchange . . . [a] chaotic character’.11 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref11] Thechair presents both a smooth upper surface like skin and a side view thatreveals the interior, ‘a cross section cut through the nature of fat’.In other artworks, Beuys chooses fat for its nutritive value which is ‘basic tolife’; fat is both from life and potentially sustaining to life. With this sortof material, ‘he manifested content, rather than symbolized it’.12[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref12] In differentiating himself from the aestheticrefinement of the minimalists, to whom he was compared, Beuys argued that ‘[Iuse] materials that are not beautiful and are also quite poor; but they havenothing to do with emptiness’.Fat Chair has been compared to a readymade, but Beuys also resisted thatassociation, asserting that the qualities of the fat, its heat and warmth, makethe work less of an elite art object as ‘defined’ by an ‘artist’13[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref13] and more of an event, akin to the human body’schanges. Of course, fat also refers to the potential ‘rendering’ of a human bodythat would serve to destroy it (potentially a reference to the Holocaust). Thisis one of the many elements through which Beuys begins to ‘homeopathically’process his culpability as a German.14 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref14]images [images/f0238-01.png]88 Joseph Beuys, poster showing Fat Chair (Fettstuhl), 1984, print on paper,89.7 × 64.5 cm.Although the Tatar story supplies a rich environmental context for Beuys’schoice of fat as a medium, Beuys’s interest in fat may also be motivated byearly experimentation with beeswax. He was particularly intrigued by thechangeable nature of wax and fat – sometimes liquid, sometimes solid – as wellas with its heat and movement and its ability to fill a void. (One work,Unschlitt, or Tallow, 1977, moulded 18,000 kg (20 tons) of fat to the shape of a‘marginal’ architectural space near Münster University. Beuys claimed both thatthe fat ‘will never cool’ and also that ‘it will never warm again’. After threemonths the fat was cut into pieces and transported to the museum.15[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref15])Beuys claimed after the war that the healing of his body initiated ‘arelationship between the chaos I had experienced and a sculptural metaphor’,drawing a direct line (without interim mediation) to his artistic practice andconcluding that: ‘Chaos can have a healing character, coupled with an idea ofopen movement that channels the heat of chaotic energy into order or form.’16[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref16] As materials transformed Beuys, so heultimately revealed them as transformative in his art.Although most commentators on Beuys’s artwork focus on the two humble materialsof felt and fat, they ignore another set of materials that are equally importantand equally embedded in Beuys’s ‘origins’ and myth-making practice. Beuys wasinterested in honey as an energy source produced by bees (along with their wax),whose ‘society’ he admired; he was specifically inspired by theories of theAustrian esoteric philosopher Rudolf Steiner. He used felt and fat, iron, honeyand gold in a seminal performance, How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare (Wieman dem toten Hasen die Bilder erklärt, 1965, at the Galerie Schmela inDüsseldorf), which included the application of some of these materials to hisbody, especially his head and foot:Gold and honey indicate a transformation of the head, and therefore, the brainand our understanding of thought, consciousness and all the other levelsnecessary to explain pictures to a hare: the warm stool insulated with felt andthe iron sole with the magnet. I had to walk on this sole when I carried thehare round from picture to picture, so along with the strange limp came theclank of iron on the hard stone floor – that was all that broke the silence,since my explanations were mute.17 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref17]Beuys pursued this idea that the application of honey to his head and face was ameans of generating energy in a number of other works, such as Honey Pump at theWorkplace (Honigpumpe, 1977, Documenta 6, Kassel). Similarly, in the performancewith the hare, he used the alchemical material gold on his head in order toenliven thought and lined his foot with iron to enact an elemental contact ofiron with the earth or stone. If one further parses a hierarchy of the body, onesees that Beuys links felt with the trunk, or ‘seat’ in this case, as he doesfat. As with iron and honey, felt and fat can be active or activated (the harerepresents many other ideas too dense to explore here).18[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref18] Materials may represent a different ‘mode ofperception’:Beuys’s art questioned the belief that we can adequately understand . . . ourworld through normal modes of perception . . . organs of knowing . . . differentfrom ordinary logical, analytical thinking must be employed to apprehend theforces at work in material substances.19 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref19]Always in considering Beuys’s work, we must try to understand the ‘processes’ ofthe materials that Beuys sought to explore.Similarly, in Beuys’s art, the cross operates as an organizing principle ratherthan a sign, persisting throughout his career both as a material object and as adirectional pointer. An early commission for a cross for a grave in 1953 causedhim to see the cross as ‘an indicator, a fulcrum, a meeting point’,20[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref20] where the spiritual was instantiated by thematerial. Furthermore he saw the cross in nature, calling queen bees, of whichhe made many early drawings and sculptures – ‘moving crosses’. One of hisprimary materials in his later work, Braunkreuz (literally, brown cross), is anopaque brown paint that evokes various associations to dried blood, to the redcross, to the Rosicrucians, even to Nazi brown shirts.21[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref21]In many of his key performances, crosses and cross movements are of signalimportance. Of the Infiltration Homogen for Grand Piano, The GreatestContemporary Composer is the Thalidomide Child (1966), now in the Centre GeorgesPompidou in Paris, the artist stated that the ‘red cross [on the felt pianocover] signif[ies] emergency, the danger that threatens us if we stay silent andare unable to carry out the next step in evolution’.22[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref22] In his Eurasia: 34th Movement of the SiberianSymphony (1966), Beuys began with the ‘Division of the Crosses’, in which hepushed two small crosses across the floor to a blackboard, then drew a cross onthe blackboard, then erased half of that cross, referring to the divisionscreated by ‘institutionalized . . . Christianity’. His crosses can represent theearth and the T-globe of medieval conception, or the spirit of inquiry ofscience, or even an ‘element’.23 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref23]Beuys made many series of postcards and a large number carry the stamp of a redcross (a kind of signature that he applied to any work he considered essentialto his ‘overall conceptual project’, known as the Hauptstrom [Mainstream]stamp). Alternately, he sometimes applied half a felt cross to works. Above all,to Beuys, it was the material expression of the cross that carried power. Itstwo joined elements expressed the goal of Beuys’s art – that is, ‘thereconstitution of a shattered originary whole’.24[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref24] (One cannot help but be reminded of themedieval role and importance of the relic of the True Cross as organizational,directive, part of nature and elemental.)25 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref25]In contrast to these changing and active pieces, one ubiquitous and renownedmultiple, Beuys’s Sled, would seem to exist in a static state which emphasizesan aggregation of materials, almost like a readymade (and reminiscent of spolia)assembled from a hardware store – felt blanket, disk of fat, sled with ironrunners and flashlight (illus. 89 [11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig89]). Beuys’scommentary on the Sled, however, once more points us away from seeing his workas a still collection of objects and towards seeing it as an embodiment ofaction and purpose. The Sled is one piece of a larger installation, The Pack(Das Rudel, 1969), which includes a Volkswagen minibus. Twenty-four sleds spillout of the rear of the vehicle like a pack of eager dogs, and Beuys designateseach as an ‘emergency object’, writing: ‘The most direct type of movement overthe Earth is the sliding of the iron runners of sleds’ (also compare to hisperformance with the Hare), and,Every sled carries its survival kit: the flashlight represents a sense ofdirectional orientation, then there is the felt, to protect oneself, and fat,which is the food. Like ‘Vakuum↔Masse’, on a purely formal level this is afilled sculpture, rare in art but common in life.26[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref26]Each part of the Sled shares in an overall purpose: the flashlight, a sort ofheadlamp that moves the piece forward into a beam of light; the felt, not only awarming blanket but ‘protection’; the fat, nourishment, which should thereforedisappear (and indeed is the most unstable part of the piece, a problem forcollectors and museums). A cross is marked in Braunkreuz on the front sledrunner. The whole is a ‘vehicle’ for discovery and salvation, one of the wordsBeuys uses to describe the true purpose of art.The reference to a ‘filled sculpture’ is somewhat enigmatic but the comparisonto Vacuum↔Mass (Vakuum↔Masse, 1968), made for Art Intermedia in Cologne, mayclarify the terminology. The latter piece was a cross-shaped iron chest filledwith 100 kg of fat and 100 bicycle pumps, sealed shut with an iron lid. Thecontainer then churned with continuous change and movement, both chemical andconceptual (pumps are a frequent ingredient in Beuys’s installations), at oddswith the iron’s suggestion of stability and the lid’s implication of finality.27[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref27]Very like a reliquary, Vakuum↔Masse, with its combination of sealed containerand dynamic, contained power, makes for a striking image. Even more provocativeand similarly concerned with the working of enclosed energy and enshrinement isanother, earlier work, the open Rubberized Box (Gummierte Kiste, 1957), an‘insulated space’ to which energy can be ‘directed . . . [and] lead to a newlevels of awareness’.28 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref28]The nature of the materials on the Sled comes into question. The neat roll ofprotective felt and the disc of fat on each sled of Das Rudel (The Pack) wouldseem to refer directly to Beuys’s rescue from the Crimean. But just as the fatcan take many different forms, and this was certainly not the raw animal fatthat was supposedly slathered on Beuys’s body, the felt is not the felt of theTatars. This felt, rather than a blanket for warming, is part of a process ofintellectual change: ‘Not even physical warmth is meant. Actually I meant acompletely different kind of warmth, namely spiritual or evolutionary warmth orthe beginning of an evolution.’images [images/f0243-01.png]89 Joseph Beuys, The Pack, poster showing installation, Neue Galerie, StaatlicheMuseen Kassel, 1992, print on paper, 83 × 59 cm.In the installation, which was arranged by Beuys himself at Kassel (see illus.89 [11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig89]), one can see, in addition to Das Rudel, thefamous Felt Suit, a multiple produced in 1970, hanging high behind The Pack, asif the artist himself were hovering there. The man-shaped suit must representBeuys, but one wonders exactly how, as photographs of Beuys never show himdressed in a suit – even though it was not unusual for artists to wear suits inthe 1950s. Rather he appears in two personally iconic sorts of uniform, one afisherman’s vest with many pockets, the other a large fur-collared coat and acharacteristic dress felt hat. The Felt Suit, then, does not stand in forBeuys’s own clothes, but rather operates as documentation or a sort of relic.Used as a prop for the performance, Action the Dead Mouse/Isolation Unit of 1970(protesting the war in Vietnam), Beuys did wear it. It was then frequentlydisplayed alone in its status as a multiple.The Felt Suit both suggests the artist’s body and also seems to refer to thebody’s absence. In the performance, the suit swaddled and constrained movementbecause the sleeves and legs are too long. Furthermore, the felt does notrepresent the usual material of the man’s suit, thus rejecting identificationwith the uniform of the businessman of the twentieth century. Finally, inexhibition, variations occur in the way the Felt Suit hangs, which tends toenliven it even if it is separated from its original context. (Maurizio Cattelanreiterates the piece in We are the Revolution, 2000, in which he represents amannequin of himself wearing a felt suit.) One scholar compared the Felt Suit tothe grey suits worn by camp inmates of the Second World War.29[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref29]What about its ‘felt-ness’? Does this (or any felt that Beuys uses) refer to theTatar material? Only in the most general way, as the felt of the Felt Suit isnot the irregular and sometimes colourful felt, common to nomadic tribes thatthe Tatars would have used. This is an even, grey felt evoking modern clothing,but thicker and less pliant than most modern fabric. Felt in general is aprimitive and very much a ‘handmade’ product, although rather than beingassociated with a distinctive substance, its identity lies in the process bywhich it is created. ‘Felting’ involves friction, moisture and even beating orstamping. Wool, even waste wool, because of the structure of its fibres, isespecially good for its production, but felt can be made from many materials,including artificial ones.Origin stories for this valuable and useful material occur in legends. In astory about St Christopher, the patron of travellers and a very popular figurein Germany, the saint is said to have avoided blisters by packing his shoes withwool, which turned to felt socks by the end of his arduous journey. In just thisway, Beuys associates felt with process, with wrapping and with journeying(compare with Coyote, 1974). The felt used in How to Explain Pictures to a DeadHare is reported to be made from the fur of hares, but usually Beuys’s materialslists are laconic on the subject. The hair of Holocaust victims was at timesmade into felt during the Second World War. Finally, because felt is the endproduct of a tangling of fibres in the presence of pressure, the fabric can belikened to human or societal networks, even those of the modern world. In hisFond series, Beuys piles up monumental rectangular stacks of felt, topped withcopper to simulate hulking grey, but soft batteries that create or store energyas collective units. In the display at Dia:Beacon, the piles retain a smell,animal or body-like. Finally, and most emblematically, Beuys created a ‘healing’Art Pill (1963) from a small round of felt.30 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref30]In sum, the Sled as ‘vehicle’ becomes processional, the means of change. Each ofthe materials of the ‘survival kit’ has its role in a very intimately personal,but also multiplied and universal meaning of materials. The Sled allowssalvation, a form that pulls forward out of chaos, not by means of symbolismbut, ultimately, through a deep and serious involvement with the material world.One more element stands out in the exhibition of work Beuys arranged in theKassel Museum (but cut off in illus. 89 [11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig89]). A series ofcases lines one wall to the side of The Pack that, like similar cases in theTate Gallery in London, Beuys designed to exhibit materials from hisperformances. As vitrines, they seem well suited to preserve the ephemera of‘actions’, especially given that the ubiquitous fat, from art objects such asFat Corners, or Fat Battery, would collect dust and degrade if not kept in avitrine. Beuys’s use of the cases has been called ‘theatrical’ as well as‘precious and microcosmic’; they have been compared to an intense andtransformative concentration on ugly things with dull colours.31[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref31] Buchloh critiqued similar display cases in theGuggenheim exhibition, complaining of art ‘pompously framed in chthonic iron,and weathered, withering relics and vestiges of past activities . . . enshrinedin . . . glass and wood cases’.32 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref32] Others haveargued, however, that the unexplained combination of things evokes curiosity andconstant re-evaluation, perhaps ‘Hermeneutic undecidability’ – they engender inthe viewer the creation not of a fixed memory point, but of a provocation tomake meaning and a confrontation with materials.33[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref33]During a 1969 Artforum interview, Beuys seems to side with his critics,elaborating on his principle ‘teaching is my greatest work of art’ by adding,the rest is the waste product, a demonstration. If you want to express yourselfyou must present something tangible. But after a while this has only thefunction of a historic document. Objects aren’t very important any more. I wantto get to the origin of matter, to the thought behind it.34[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref34]Like Buddha, Christ and Muhammad, Beuys the charismatic leader on one handrejects objects, but nevertheless values matter as origin. His followers and hislegacy depend upon the powerful and transformative materials left behind, andeven if like the congealed and desiccated fat, they have ceased to act, theystill represent ‘the thought behind it’. Like reliquaries for the modern world,the clear cases testify to actions and yet prevent devotees in the Museum asChurch from touching and taking souvenirs of this man who inspired eitherviolent rejection or unquestioning loyalty throughout his life – the artist asChrist figure, ‘often crucified’.35 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref35]ART IS LITURGY, PAUL THEKIt happens more often that the symbols choose me, than that I choose thesymbols. Art is liturgy, and if the audience reacts to the holy character of thesymbols, then I hope I have achieved my goal, at least at that moment.36[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref36]Although unfortunately too much of the physical material is lost, Paul Thek’swell-preserved and well-known Technological Reliquaries series, his lost Tomb of1967 (now documented with new photographs), and his 1968 installation in Essen(also documented photographically) clearly exhibit the reliquary strategies andconcern with materials that dominate his art. Thek (1933–1988) was not areligious artist but he was a deeply conflicted religious man. One indication ofthe depth of his involvement with Christianity is his chosen name. Thek’s birthname was George Joseph, but in 1955 he changed his name to Paul, in admirationof the visionary Christian writer and Apostle of the early Church, who hadhimself changed his name from Saul after a vision and conversion.Thek knew and admired Beuys’s work, and met him at Documenta 4 in 1968, but theyounger American artist found the German’s work ultimately too ‘ponderous’ and‘nasty’, and complained of his lack of a sense of humour and polish. Indeed,their differences are striking: Beuys had redefined the art world to include allof society, and explained his work endlessly in lectures, modelling himself asan authoritative healer, a shaman. In contrast, Thek allowed himself to bereferred to as a hippie, and called himself the Pied Piper (an anti-leader, withwhimsy); he treasured the intellectual discussion of art, although he claimed tobe ‘against interpretation’; he despised the art world, yet he wanted to be ‘INnot OUT’, and perhaps most significantly, much of his work is ironic butnevertheless grapples with the meaning and processing of the intransigent stuffof the body.Notwithstanding these striking differences between the two men, one commentatorremarked that Beuys and Thek did not become friends because they were too alike.Certainly both had a kind of charisma and both found inspiration in the imageryand aesthetics of their Catholic upbringing, finding rich yet impreciselydefined meaning in materials.Thek began to produce his ‘meat pieces’ in 1964 (see illus. 91[11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig91]). He acknowledged inspiration from Jasper Johns’s useof wax as a medium on canvases and Larry Bell’s precise minimalist boxes, butwhat Thek produced was altogether different – wax simulacra enclosed in andenshrined by Plexiglas. Although wax has a long history as an art medium, it hasnever gained general acceptance. It is a ‘material [that] has provided theprivileged metaphor of the work of memory, and even of sensorial operations ingeneral’, but at the same time has an ‘excessive resemblance’ to flesh.37[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref37] Such resemblance may explain its popularity inreliquaries of the seventeenth century (illus. 90 [11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig90], StValerianus, Vienna) and its use in creating uncanny lifelike portraits such asthe ones on display at wax museums – most famously, Madame Tussauds.Of course, wax’s ability to simulate flesh was precisely the quality thatattracted Thek. In an environment in which real meat had been used inperformances – and wax and plastic ‘meat’ was presented at ‘The AmericanSupermarket’ (Paul Bianchini Gallery, New York, 1964), which also sold commoditypieces by Andy Warhol – Thek produced laboriously handmade models of wax ‘meat’that so meticulously reproduced the surface, visual texture and colours of realmeat, fat and skin that one might almost expect the end result to rot. Theenclosure in Plexiglas cases also literally set Thek’s ‘masterpieces’ apart fromtouch and at a certain psychological distance. Thek himself characterized themeat pieces as ‘gripping’; their shock value did the work of drawing attention,and they were the first work to bring the young artist to the attention of thepress and critics.Of this series, in retrospect, Thek focused on an absence of meaning, onmaterials and on issues of viewing:They’re agnostic. They lead nowhere, except perhaps to a kind of freedom. Thedissonance of the two surfaces, glass and wax, pleases me: one is clear andshiny and hard, the other is soft and slimy . . . At first the physicalvulnerability of the wax necessitated the cases; now the cases have grown toneed the wax. The cases are calm; their precision is like numbers, reasonable. Idon’t know if the cases hold out the viewer or hold in the wax-flesh. Maybe it’sthe same thing. It’s almost impossible to tell what’s inside unless the viewerhas his nose to the glass. They’re ambiguous; they can’t be seen all at once.Very much like medieval reliquaries, there is a clear interdependence for Thekbetween container and contained, and a certain productive confusion about theseparation of their respective roles. The cases provide order and a border-likeframe. They surely function as an alternative ‘skin’, just as did the silversurfaces of body-part reliquaries – not, however, the ‘glorious’ skin of theresurrection of the medieval pieces, but a geometrically precise skin of apost-Enlightenment sort – a boundary that intends to confine flesh and definehuman substances, creating an ambiguity that recalls the multivalent meanings ofsubstances in Beuys’s work.In this focus on materials and their intrinsic but slippery qualities, Thek digsdeep into his exploitation of dissonance. The result allows the expression ofemotion and the creation of an audience reaction (without specific meaning), anaffective quality that differentiated his art from current trends such asminimalism. His work with wax, glass and steel activates not only vision butalso touch (hard, soft, slimy). In later work such as Tomb, he will add smell,and in Station of the Cross (Cherry Chapel), 1972, sound.In addition to wax and steel, Thek includes one other significant material inthe ‘meat pieces’: hair. As Walter Benjamin noted, hair is unsettling, neitherand yet both dead and alive.38 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref38] To a query aboutwhether hair was a fetish for him, Thek, answering indirectly, replied, ‘Thereis something I find very moving in hair, an extremely beautiful-ugly quality,very akin to nausea . . . hair is . . . like antennae . . . bristling,receptive’. Thek often used matted hair on his meat pieces, one aspect amongothers that surely invokes a reaction of disgust in the viewer, and alsoamplifies the tactile quality of the pieces. But when an interviewer mentionedthat some people feel nauseous while viewing his pieces, Thek replied, ‘thatdisappoints me’, and, ‘It should be a revitalization.’images [images/f0250-01.png]90 Hans Krumper (design), reliquary of St Valerianus, early 17th century,Munich, wax, fabric, pearls, hardwood overlaid with ebony, gold enamel andbronze gilt, 36 × 22.5 cm, Kunsthistorisches Museum (Kaiserliche Schatzkammer),Vienna.Thek’s comment about the antennae-like quality of hair is at the core of the‘revitalizing’ qualities of these pieces. Small, individual hairs reach out fromthe surface of the ‘meat’, and although it must be admitted that this ‘movement’is contained within the vitrine and does not reach the viewer’s space, it beginsto activate the piece. Undoubtedly, this is Thek’s own hair – and thus the firstof a series of significant references in his work to his own body. As an indexto his body, the hair becomes his investment in the piece, as well as the centreof ‘action’ (bristling, receptive). Other works in the series, for example,Untitled (Four Tube Meat Piece), 1964, have more emphatic but mechanistic‘antennae’, medical-seeming tubes that protrude from the piece and then evenbreak the boundary of the vitrine, providing a more emphatic ‘access’ to thecontents of the case.images [images/f0251-01.png]91 Paul Thek, Birthday Cake, 1964, from the series Technological Reliquaries,wax, hair, candles, stainless steel, paint and glass, 48.2 × 62.2 × 62.2 cm,private collection.In Birthday Cake (1964, illus. 91 [11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig91]), other levels ofreference and material are added to the basic elements of the series. First, thevitrine is not a neutral rectangle as in earlier examples but takes the shape ofa pyramid. Second, the meat is built up into three layers, each successive levelstepped back and smaller than the last. Third, Thek has whimsically addedcandles to the ‘layers’, giving the piece its common name and thereby invoking anauseating image of the eating of raw flesh. Finally, the piece has analternative name noted by the artist: Josef Albers Homage to the Square.These variant features in Birthday Cake offer insights about the series thattend to contradict Thek’s assertion that the meat pieces ‘lead nowhere’. Inother discussions of the series, he admitted that the pieces were meaningful,particularly in terms of process: ‘I choose this subject matter because itviolates my sensibilities, but that’s not the same as shock. I work with it todetach myself from it . . . it’s not sex, it’s flesh, something in a spasm.’ Inan interview on another occasion he claimed, ‘Very clearly I saw this meat on awall, almost crucified, hanging on a wall like a painting.’ The meat pieces arethus in some sense activated (in spasm) and assimilated to the tortured andcrucified body of Christ. Indeed, many commentators, including Thek’s friendAnne Wilson, have compared the flesh to the body of martyrs. Thek objected that‘the flesh is not mutilated. It is rigidly and orderly cut.’ Careful cuttingwould seem to correspond to the homage to Albers and his rectangles, especiallyin terms of the stacked rectangles of Birthday Cake, which also counter thenotion of any torture excepting perhaps sadism. Still, according to Thek the‘spasm’ is inherent, and the reference seems to be to torture, even ifcalculated and precise.Birthday Cake, however, unlike the other meat pieces, does not hang on a wall.Rather than spasm, its pyramid shape suggests stability. Thek, who had alifelong interest in Egyptian art and archaeology – indeed, at his death he waswrapped by his caretaker like a mummy, and ‘sealed’ with a rosary on his chest –was fascinated with pyramids and used the shape in a number of hisinstallations, including a stepped pyramid for his later and most famous piece,Tomb. The reference to the stepped pyramid in Birthday Cake thus reorients ourunderstanding, bringing in the question of entombment and death, even if, unlikethe pyramid Thek built for Tomb, the meat pyramid is one the viewer cannotenter.Despite its primary associations with ancient archaeology, Thek considered thepyramid to have Christian meaning: ‘[the pyramid has] a special fascination forme . . . [it is] the ideal cathedral . . . to me a pyramid is never finished . .. the only finished pyramid is the one with the eye of God’.Thek often sketched birthday cakes and a 1974 version takes the shape of apyramid, accompanied by a shaped poem:39 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref39]Does one have a RELATIONSHIP withGOD?[sketch of pyramid cake with a candle glowing on top]Take +Eat!The I at thetop of thepyramidRather than an innocent or childish sweet, this cake is likened to the Sacramentof the Eucharist – that is, the body of Christ, through the language of theMass, ‘Take + Eat’. Although it post-dates the meat piece by a decade, clearlythe drawing ties the pyramid imagery into Christian meanings.Such associations already existed in the early Middle Ages. We may recall thatin c. 1050 Thiofrid of Echternach described a pyramid-shaped reliquary in whichthe four sides of the base represented virtues that allowed man to climb towardsGod, moving from the carnal to the spiritual. Furthermore, from any given side,the pyramid presented a triangle, indicating the mystery of the Trinity, anessential doctrine of the Christian faith. Finally the unification of form inthe point at the apex represented the indivisibility and unity of the Church ofGod.40 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref40] In other words, the shape of a pyramidalreliquary as a whole reiterates lessons and truths of the Church but also, inits rising sides, duplicates the reaction it is meant to inspire – its verypresence and shape is meant to raise the mind of the devout viewer towards theapex and God. Similarly, we have seen that obelisk-shaped reliquaries used inthe Baroque era, especially those culminating in a flame (candle), signify anintended spiritual ascent.Thek presumably was unaware of these medieval ideas, but his notation of the ‘Iat the top of the pyramid’ seems to align with the imagery he cited of the ‘eye’on the pyramid (a masonic image that occurs on the reverse of a U.S. dollarbill), implying similar sorts of ascent and unity at the apex. The impliedrising of the smoke of the candles might remind us that a martyr’s ‘birthday’(dies natalis) is in fact the day of his or her death, the day the flesh becomesthe flesh of sacrifice – Christ, a saint or Thek himself – on the ‘altar’ of thecake. The candles, more assertive ‘antennae’ than the filaments of hair, beg tobe lit and to activate the interior of this reliquary. In descriptions ofmedieval visions, relics give off light and glow – this one should be imaginedas doing so as well.The meat pieces were retrospectively gathered into a series called theTechnological Reliquaries after a few similar pieces were included in Thek’sTomb installation at New York’s Stable Gallery in 1967. In that installation,inside the environment of a stepped pyramid, Thek placed the ‘corpus’, a mouldedreplication of his body, exposed in death. Significantly, Thek showed himself asa martyred artist (compare to the Byzantine Iconoclast monk, Lazarus), in thatthe fingers of the right hand were chopped off and hung on a wall in a pouchnearby and, in a work that was almost entirely a monochromatic pink, one seesthe red of blood and the white of bone in the mutilated hand. Significantly,among other paraphernalia in this installation, Thek included a series of bodyparts displayed in vitrines. As Thek noted, he had excessive amounts of thismaterial, resulting from early experiments of casting his body. In other words,once again, something of Thek’s own body occupies the reliquaries.92 Paul Thek, Warrior’s Leg, 1966–7, from the series Technological Reliquaries,wax, metal, leather, paint and Plexiglas, 66.5 × 36 × 21 cm, Hirschhorn Museumand Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC.images [images/f0255-01.png]Warrior’s Leg (1966–7, illus. 92 [11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig92]) is one of the moststriking of these new ‘technological’ reliquaries. Cut off below the knee, withfleshy bloody ‘meat’ protruding from the top, a realistically coloured wax legis girded in what looks like a sort of armour – a leather ‘greave’ protectingthe shin and attached to an antique-inspired sandal covering the foot. AnneWilson calls thishis brilliant metaphoric aesthetic shift from the classical fragment to thedismembered leg and arm of the Gladiator, from stone to wax, from the Christianmartyr to the human loss of the Vietnam War. That the classical figure should becast from his own body produced a further layer of meaning that supported aframework of ideas and created an autobiography of fragments.41[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref41]The classical and Vietnam references can be supplemented with a comparison tothe Apostolic reliquary from Trier with its realistically depicted foot (seeillus. 26 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig26]). Other pieces in the series recallmedieval hand and arm reliquaries, although casts of shoes, teeth anddeath-mask-like objects fall outside such reference.The nature of these objects as fragments (autobiographical or not) should behighlighted:The fragment is not only a rhetorical figure, it also makes its rhetoricalnature immediately obvious. Its effect is based on its being grasped as asegment or piece cut out of a larger whole. The fragment is consequently proof.In its structure is inscribed the memory of something more comprehensive(possibly not at all representable). In the here and now, within the limitationsof a given situation, it can function as symptom of this (absent, excluded)other.42 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref42]These sentiments are those of a contemporary art critic but could readily bethose of a medieval historian writing of relics, especially insofar as theyserve as complexly referential memory objects.All the meat pieces participate in this discourse of the fragmentary, but intheir function as memorials, an identifiable body is at issue: these reliquariesof course in some sense contain Thek’s body. But rather than reconstituting orrestoring memory,Within the rhetoric of the body, the abject may have been the most tellingcategory at that time, because it – in contrast to totalizing or fragmentingconceptions – is never bound up with the confirmation of identity, but ratherwith the threat of its dissolution.And,it [is] plausible that the impulse behind their production is to be sought inthe mastering of fears . . . the apotropaic capacity of the mimetic . . . wantsto banish terror though emulation . . . threats transform themselves intorepresentation.43 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref43]In part, this analysis is based on Thek’s own comments. In a letter to SusanSontag he wrote, ‘Occasionally there is a horror of my skin, an unpleasantsurface, a loathing & a frustrated violence.’44 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref44]Describing his process in an interview, Thek averred that he would ‘look closelyat something that is disturbing and detach myself from it’.There is no doubt that as a bisexual raised in an unhappy Catholic household bya non-attentive alcoholic mother, Thek had a certain fraught relationship withhis body. But, he argued:For me it was absolutely obvious, inside the glittery swanky cases – the ‘ModernArt’ materials that were all the rage at the time . . . was something veryunpleasant, very frightening and looking absolutely real. It seemed to me thatnobody noticed the fact that I was dealing with a frightening subject withabsolute patience and control so that it became serene. Nobody noticed that Iwas working with the hottest subject known to man – the human body – and doingit in a totally controlled way which, I thought, was the required distancing . ..This distancing of which Thek speaks is crucial. This is, however, the distanceof ‘representation’, not a physical or literal distance. Again, as quoted above,Thek said of the meat pieces: ‘It’s almost impossible to tell what’s insideunless the viewer has his nose to the glass. They’re ambiguous; they can’t beseen all at once.’ He is referring here to the vitrine’s sides, which, thoughmade of Plexiglas, do not provide in all instances a clear view of the vitrine’scontent. Some of the Plexiglas is tinted yellow, and most often it has yellowlines that obscure the vision of the viewer. As Thek describes a process ofcreation that counters fear and horror, the viewer is put in a position ofnegotiating his or her own ‘point of view’.This point of view is of paramount importance to Thek. In late exhibits, he hungpaintings low on the wall and supplied them with low chairs. He included aprie-dieu in his 1972 Station of the Cross. In these attempts to manipulate andcontrol the way in which his works are seen, he queried their visibility and themeaning of sight, forcing the viewer to make looking a conscious process.Ultimately, however, Thek focused upon the emotional response to these pieces.After the ‘horror’, they lead to ‘freedom’:I hope the work has the innocence of those Baroque crypts in Sicily; theirinitial effect is so stunning you fall back for a moment and then it’sexhilarating . . . [a body presented in a] windowed coffin . . . and [touching afragment] I felt strangely relieved and free. It delighted me that bodies couldbe used to decorate a room, like flowers. We accept our thing-nessintellectually, but the emotional acceptance of it can be a joy.In these comments, Thek is referring to a trip in 1963 to the Palermo catacombs(ossuaries) with his friend Peter Hujar. This visit, as well as his experienceof elaborate celebrations of saints’ feast days in Italy, profoundly affectedmany aspects of his art.While living in Rome, Thek was asked by the Galerie M. E. Thelen in Essen,Germany, to mount an installation. Thek entitled it A Procession in Honor ofAesthetic Progress: Objects to Theoretically Wear, Carry, Pull or Wave (1968).Thek arrived two days before his opening with his work packed in cases andtravelling with him on the train. Unfortunately, much of the work was damaged intransit and then held in customs, bringing the opening of the exhibition verymuch into question. Thek arranged the work that had survived under bright lightsand pushed the rest behind ropes and lit it with softer pink tints (illus. 93[11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig93]). At the opening, he spontaneously announced to onecritic that the installation was to be a ‘work in progress’ with multipleopenings, changing over the course of the exhibition. He was to be seen workingon the installation as part of the process. The reception of this concept wasenthusiastic and the exhibition was very much a success. Thek took up thisapproach to much of his work thereafter, and even began working with others inhis later installations, notably at Amsterdam, Stockholm, Philadelphia andMunich. This approach to artistic process may be one of the most important andinfluential aspects of his art career.Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the Essen installation mounted in thisprocess-focused way was inspired by Italian Catholic feast day performances. Ina letter of 1 July 1968 to Hujar, Thek wrote, ‘I want to do a crazy show, — aprocession — and do all the things that people carry and wear in a procession —like jewelry and masks and shrines etc — and it could be a joy to do’, although,he also said, processions were ‘a pun on process art’.images [images/f0259-01.png]93 Paul Thek, A Procession in Honor of Aesthetic Progress: Objects toTheoretically Wear, Carry, Pull or Wave, installation view, 1968, Galerie M. E.Thelen, Essen, Germany.Of the material that he shipped to Essen, most of the large pieces were made tointeract with the human body. Although the Head pieces were destroyed inshipping, their glass shattered, most of the other works survived, the largestof which was an elaborate sedan chair, for which Thek made ‘a two-headed baby’,speculating later: ‘I wonder why. — It goes in a porcamadonna and thentheoretical Germans will carry it on their 8 shoulders. — I really wonderwhy.’45 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref45] (Here ‘porcamadonna’ – an obscenity –must be one of Thek’s ‘mis-hearings’, elsewhere he says portamadonna.)From the perspective of reliquary strategy, the Head pieces are the mostinteresting, even startling, elements of the intended installation. As thephotos taken before Thek left Rome show, they were to be ‘worn’ by insertingone’s head into a hole at the bottom so that the head was enclosed in the glass,framed box. Two semi-circular shoulder supports (similar to those on the chairs)would then rest on the shoulders. In effect, the wearer would him/herself becomethe relic. Perhaps this was meant for the ‘theoretical Germans’ or, as indicatedby his previous practice and the photographs, Thek may have again been thinkingof his own body. Although there are no photos of the chairs in procession, giventhat each has shoulder supports jutting up from the seat and a hole in the seatitself, one would have to assume they were worn like the headpieces buttopsy-turvy, an implication that is either scandalous or merely amusing.As with Tomb and the Technological Reliquaries, the Procession centres on Thek’s‘processing’ of his body, coming to terms with its substance, its flesh anddesires, its joy and its eventual mortality. Although Tomb was perhaps his mostexhibited piece, he grew tired of showing it, and commented, ‘imagine having tobury yourself over and over’. Even with the many puns and jokes, theseinstallations were not ultimately light-hearted endeavours for the artist. ForThek his art was REAL:I was amused with the idea of meat under Plexiglas because I thought it made funof the scene where the game seemed to be ‘how cool can you be’ and ‘howrefined’. Nobody ever mentioned anything that seemed real. The world was fallingapart, anyone could see it. I was a wreck . . . the city was a wreck; and I’d goto a gallery and there would be a lot of fancy people looking at a lot of stuffthat didn’t say anything about anything to anyone.Like Beuys, Thek took materiality seriously. He worked with unconventionalmaterials and staged them in a theatrical manner that drew upon strategies ofrepresentation he had found exciting and compelling in European Catholicchurches (as well as the one of his boyhood). By presenting his own limbs (orgeneric flesh) as preserved and ornamented fragments, enframed in vitrines andyet difficult to see, he confronted his fears and addressed the horror and‘thingness’ of the body.By distancing the ‘meat’, processing it and enshrining it, he controlled itwithin precisely geometric shapes. The aspirational pyramid may have offeredhope of transcending mortality, whether on the altar of sacrificed flesh or viathe tomb and the ornamented (and mutilated) alter-body. Thek remarked that ‘alltheologies have something in common: a life-long journey, ascension, fusion orunion’, and admitted, ‘I’m a renegade Christian still looking for theTranscendental Experience.’ Such a transcendental experience might come throughthe prayers (and drawings and jokes) with which he filled his notebooks, orthrough art. But like medieval art and reliquaries, such transcendental art isonly a machine to lift the consciousness via the imperfect mechanism of sight:‘my eyes pierce me and burn’. For each step forward there is a step back. Oreven more fundamentally, as he wrote in a notebook, ‘Ideas are ‘MACHINES FORLIVING’ + hence destructive of life.’46 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref46]Beuys and Thek have had an outsize but, until recently, under-appreciatedinfluence on contemporary art, especially in terms of ideas concerningperformance, use of materials and installation. Matthew Barney admitted thatBeuys was a primary inspiration,47 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref47] as have MikeKelley and Paul McCarthy. Perhaps the ‘reliquary effect’ has thus far goneunremarked, but it is a powerful part of their work.OTHER RELIQUARIES?A more specific notion of the value of the ‘reliquary’ occurs in contemporaryart but to decidedly less powerful effect. Fluxus artists, a group that Beuysworked with (although he denied being one of their number), had some interest inthe form. George Maciunas designed a Fluxus piece, produced in a series byGeoffrey Hendricks variously titled and dated (1970–76), that is in effect ananti-reliquary, containing the ‘sweat of Satan’, shit from Last Supper, andother ‘relics’, and was produced with machine-like precision as a multiple.Similarly, Piero Manzoni’s work of 1961, Merda d’artista, featured canned shitsold for the market price of gold. Surely all this is more scatological andinfantile that Beuys’s fat? (Although the reference to the artist’s body inManzoni’s work and in another, a balloon entitled The Artist’s Breath, 1960,recalls Thek.)The Fluxus reliquary may be called a reliquary because it gestures towards anotion of the ordering of the world through assembled, categorized and framedcollections of material objects. Joseph Cornell’s boxes make stronger claims onthis power of assemblage and enclosure, but I would argue that many artists thatuse the title ‘reliquary’ do so only with the ironic intention of the Fluxuspiece. A confidence in the ability of material to both serve as memory objectand retain a potential for spiritual order may be a stronger motivation for theuse of reliquary strategies than such superficial and ironic references.In contrast to superficial references to reliquaries and reliquary strategies,land art and site work calls up powerful reminiscence of the sacral landscapesdiscussed in the Introduction. In some instances, artists transported materialfrom one location to exhibit elsewhere in order to join two ‘places’, as was sooften done with soil from the Holy Land. Robert Smithson wrote of his earthworksin ‘A Provisional Theory of Non-Sites’ that ‘The Non-Site (an indoor earthwork)is a three dimensional logical picture that is abstract, yet it represents anactual site in N.J. (The Pine Barrens Plains)’ (1968).48[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref48] Smithson also describes a trip to the landscapelocation as an ersatz metaphorical pilgrimage.Similarly, Michelle Stuart has made large abstract drawings of landscape using‘frottage’, or rubbing techniques, as well as materials from the site itself(#28 Moray Hill, 1974).49 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref49] In a statement thatis evocative of the sort of multiples we have seen with the relic of theVeronica or Buddha’s footprint (see illus. 7 [06_Chapter01.xhtml#fig7], 41[08_Chapter03.xhtml#fig41]), she observed, ‘We imprint and are imprints of allthat came before’, although, unlike those multiples, Stuart wants to implicatematter as intrinsic to the process.50 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref50]The ‘consecration’ of non-art material as practised by Beuys is again a strategythat brings powerful meaning to contemporary artists’ work. In The Holy VirginMary (1996), Chris Ofili used elephant dung, in part because of his story of an‘epiphany’ in Zimbabwe in which he discovered its ‘sacral’ quality. (Although itshould be noted that African artists use it as a material, especially as acolorant.)51 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref51] While some argue that Ofili isexploring the degradations of racism, others maintain that in Ofili’s Madonna,as in Andres Serrano’s Piss Christ (1987), the use of unacceptable materials inChristian representations engages in a long-standing discourse of theincarnation as reversal of expectations that rightly challenges ideas of beautyand religion-as-comfort.52 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref52]Both works are undeniably beautiful but in very unconventional ways. Serranophotographs light penetrating amber fluid in a fashion reminiscent of light andgems on medieval reliquaries. Ofili encases and ornamentsdung-as-Virgin’s-breast, making it reliquary-like as well. A small but tellingdetail of his work consists of the way that Ofili elevates his paintings onelephant dung-ball pedestals, entering the paintings into the world of objects(like cult objects), both connecting them to and removing them from the earth asreliquary feet do in the Middle Ages (where one sees metal lions instead of thedung of elephants, see illus. 26 [07_Chapter02.xhtml#fig26]).Reliquary strategies have been a powerful means for artists to examine andcritique the modern art market and its system of values, certainly in Manzoni’swork but also more recently in that of Eva and Franco Mattes, who use thediscursive language of relics in Stolen Pieces, 1995–7 (first revealed 2010), inwhich they display ‘relics’ of famous artworks, chipped off, broken or stolenfrom galleries and museums. Whether or not the artists’ story is true (they dosupply one video document), the horror of desecration of ‘masterpieces’ that itinvokes is reminiscent of the medieval story of St Hugh biting the relic bone ofMary Magdalene. Like that story, a medieval parable of appallingly inappropriatebehaviour, which paradoxically stands as an act of reverence on the part of adivinely inspired holy man, the Matteses’ critique of the art world unexpectedlyreinforces the status of art. In the same way that a relic fragment magnifiesthe importance of a saint, in Stolen Pieces the conceptual artworks are ‘broken’but thereby renewed and enlivened; from their moribund state as objects in anexhibition they are returned to an original ‘liveliness’.But perhaps the most powerful use of the ‘reliquary effect’ is its employment byartists who make memorials to the fallen, the often unidentified dead.Installations created between 1992 and 2004 by the Colombian artist DorisSalcedo are titled Atrabiliarios, translatable as either The Defiant orMelancholic. The units of the installations consist of single or paired wornshoes, usually those of women, reverently enshrined in wall niches that are verylike the niches of a columbarium cemetery (illus. 94[11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig94]). Rather than placed behind labelled plaques,however, the shoes are purposefully difficult to see – appearing behind thick,blurry screens made of a skinlike substance that are ‘sewn’ into the wall withirregular stitches of surgical thread. The artist collected the shoes as memorypieces, often from the families of people who had disappeared through violenceoriginating in politics or the drug trade in Colombia. These shoes, single or inpairs, attest to loss and memory and the difficult of mourning those who have‘disappeared’; they are uniquely personal, eloquently imprinted and shaped bylost bodies.images [images/f0265-01.png]94 Doris Salcedo, Atrabiliarios, 1992–2004, detail of wall installation withdrywall, shoes, paint, wood, animal fibre and surgical thread, 43 niches and 40boxes, overall dimensions variable, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.The French artist Christian Boltanski’s series of altar-like works often titledMonument, produced from the late 1970s into the ’90s, also commemoratessenseless death. In these haunting pieces Boltanski uses anonymous blurry blackand white photographs of (presumably) lost children of the Holocaust. The darkspaces of the display of such an ‘archive’, where candle-like electrical bulbsprovide dim illumination between photos set out in geometric arrays, adds to thesacral sense of memorialization. The crudely wired and connected cords of thebare bulbs and minimalist ‘framing’ creates an aura of desolation.Part of the American Dario Robleto’s artistic practice is similarly to gatherand use authentic materials in order to memorialize mourning – the alternatestate of mind that is such an indefinable and overwhelming emotion. He oftenuses artisanal techniques reminiscent of a widow’s customary actions, such asembroidery or sewing, to create pieces that in some sense re-enact experience,as in Gardens of Empire (2006), whose materials list includes: ‘homemade paper(pulp-made letters to their brides from soldiers who did not return from variouswars, ink retrieved from letters, cotton), fabric and thread from soldiers’uniforms from various wars, hair flowers braided by war widows, coloured paper,silk, ribbon, cartes de visite, passion flower, motherwort, bugleweed, poplar,ash.’Another piece is itself reminiscent of a reliquary box shape, although it liesopen to display its contents: A Sadness Silence Can’t Touch (2005). In thisinstance, materials include: ‘casts of Civil War-era “pain bullets” (bulletsused by soldiers to bite on during surgery) made from dissolved audiotaperecordings of poets’ voices, lace and fabric from mourning dresses, ink dyedyellow-heart and ash, nickel, silver, milk paint, typeset.’ And recordings: WaltWhitman, ‘America’; Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’;Siegfried Sassoon, ‘Died of Wounds’; T. S. Eliot, ‘The Waste Land’; RobertGraves, ‘In Procession’; Dylan Thomas, ‘A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire,of a Child in London’; David Jones, ‘In Parenthesis’.53[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref53]All three of these artists, Salcedo, Boltanski and Robleto, use strategies thatactivate the power of the indexical. In each case, he or she shows that personalmemories are elusive or irrelevant but collective memory can be constructed andbecome all the more powerful. The installations, rather than remaining tied to aspecific historical memory or moment, seek perhaps to initiate a searchinganalysis of the viewer’s own memories, and to push for societal processing ofthe horrors of war and even genocide – each calls upon the human spirit. Beuys’swork may have initially pointed in this direction, but it functionedmetaphorically, philosophically or perhaps in terms of ‘homeopathy’, as onecritic suggested. These works are more direct.It is the third artist of our primary focal group who brings many of thesethreads together in a concerted effort not only to memorialize but also to‘process’ German guilt vis-à-vis the Holocaust.NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM, ANSELM KIEFERAnselm Kiefer (b. 1945) is in some sense a student of Beuys, although he hasrejected Beuys’s dictum, ‘Every man is an artist.’ Furthermore, he ultimatelyturned away from more public event-based art and turned towards paintings,constructions and objects or vitrines that look like nothing so much asmonumental reliquaries.In his 2010 show Next Year in Jerusalem, a multi-part installation at theGagosian Gallery in New York, Kiefer’s art clearly implicated theJudaeo-Christian tradition, gathered up and filtered through the artist’spersonal vision. Its evocation of alchemy, Kabbalah and other mystic elements,however, destabilized the presentation of any fixed belief system. Rather thanreassuring, the whole is devastating. As Simon Schama argued in The Guardian inJanuary 2007, this art is not ‘fun’; Kiefer ‘does the big embarrassing stuff’,in particular querying how to remember and/or memorialize the Holocaust.Although Kiefer himself was born after the Second World War, he takes on itsconsequences as a German inheritance.The painting Iron Path (Eisensteig), 1986 (not in the Gagosian exhibit butsimilar in approach to many of the paintings included), is representative of theartist’s strategies. Kiefer implicates the viewer in the perspective ofrelentlessly converging tracks of a railway, inscribed upon a heavily workedimpasto landscape, the paint thickened with straw. The imagery recalls actionsof the Holocaust and its technologies of death. Additionally, by means of adense material ‘sedimentation’ (the artist’s term), layering a lead ‘rock’, apair of iron climbing shoes and some gold leaf pasted on the surface ‘above thehorizon’, Kiefer makes references to temporal presence, resistant earth, as wellas alchemical principles and spiritual aspiration.54[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref54]Although paintings line the walls, in the massive installation Next Year inJerusalem, Kiefer for the most part abandons the spaces of perspective and turnsinstead to a display that interrogates the power of things. Elements and themesthat have long engaged Kiefer’s attention – lead books, empty yet standing orfloating clothing, thorns, model warships and planes – are gathered together and‘put under glass’ to be encountered and examined. The viewer ‘in a performancepiece of the artist’s devising’ engages in a simulacrum of pilgrimage, seekingmeaning inside a space that the critic Roberta Smith called a ‘museum ofdevastation’ (New York Times, 18 October 2010). In her essay in the exhibitioncatalogue, Marina Warner calls the objects ‘anti-monuments’, and notes that theyverge on the ironic, yet wonders if they ‘take on the character of certainfundamental ritual speech acts: naming, lament, apotropeia, propitiation? . . .Can it be efficacious in this way?’55 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref55]There is no doubt that the pieces in this assemblage borrow the structures ofritual and the theatricality of the Catholic Church and, to some degree, itsiconography. The materials are (mostly) familiar to us, the objects ‘speak’. Inthe installation photograph (illus. 95 [11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig95]) on the leftwe can see, from front to back, as titled by the inscriptions on their glass:Valentinus; Jeremiah; Baruch; Die Sefiroth and Das rote Meer, and on the wall apainting, Wundtau Regnet. The titles of the works in the vitrines refer,sequentially, to: an esoteric Christian mystic represented in a ladder-likeconfiguration of buckets; two chairs on two tipping surfaces over a pile ofdeteriorating burned books; the diagram of the ten attributes/emanations ofKabbalah suspended over a wedding dress pierced with shards of glass, and threechairs on a single tilting surface tipping into a large, battered, bathtub-likeobject. All are literally grounded in cracked earth, but the last seems toindicate the perilous status of all three faith traditions that warily circlethe waters of the Mediterranean. If in Jewish mystical Kabbalah, as Kieferemphasizes, every letter has a meaning, so every element of this iconography ofspiritual meaning must be examined in turn. Like a collection of relics andreliquaries that gives support to a central depiction/relic/host/presence ofGod, these ancillary vitrines might be thought to encircle the large steel shedthat is the ‘heart of darkness’ of the exhibit (at the right of illus. 95[11_Chapter06.xhtml#fig95]).56 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref56]The massive box measures 3.42 × 5.03 × 10.56 m (11 × 16¾× 35 ft) and its doorsare partially open to reveal a set of photographs on lead (lead attached toburlap), hung inside as if in a crowded closet. Although installationphotographs rather misleadingly indicate that one can see the imagery on thesestacked sheets clearly, such was not the case. The 76 ‘colossal’ sheetsreproduce photographs from Kiefer’s earlier piece, Occupations (1969–70). Inthese photographs made during his student days, originally conceived forpresentation in small books, the artist photographed himself in myriad differentlocations performing a Nazi salute. There were accusations of neo-Nazism, butKiefer’s work was meant to ‘conjure a portrait of a dangerous German creator whoconstructs himself through symbolic actions and artefacts’,57[13_References.xhtml#rch06ref57] and in some sense to allow Kiefer to explore anartist/creator identity despite the German shame of the Holocaust.With these ur-images secured within the bunker/cattle car/processing plant atthe centre of the exhibit, forming a ‘battery-like stack’ of lead (againreminiscent of Beuys),58 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref58] this object suppliesthe dark and forceful centre of the process that is the exhibit. As aholy-of-holies anti-monument to which one is denied access, it conjures biblicalpower. That man, rather than God and his Ark, appears at the potent centre is ofsignal importance – especially given that this is a man who poses, questions anddoubts at the same moment that he constructs and directs (making the Nazisalute).If, as Kiefer claimed, he is a ‘boundary-crosser’, the boundary he is drawing isthat of the horizon, where earth meets sky, memory meets oblivion and creatormeets created. The tension that is established in the exhibit, a tension thatmoved some reviewers to feel uncomfortable, and may have been the reason thatmore than one ‘protest’ took place in the gallery space, translates into a senseof unease, of precarious and threatened balance, of glass barriers/glassshattered. The vitrines are too tall and too tightly positioned. The dust, ashesand dirt and unrelenting palette of grey, black and brown, with touches ofsepulchral white, sets a mood of despair. Only with effort is the viewersusceptible to the hope expressed in the title of the exhibit – can the ash canbe purifying, expiatory?59 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref59]Above all, Kiefer’s imagery of decay and loss centres on an oppressivemateriality: dead sunflowers, ghostlike dresses and coats stiffened and dirtied,thickets of thorn and bracken obstructing access, and burned books fallen anddiscarded. Degraded but nonetheless insistently present, matter may be the onlyconnection to other states and places – the means of access or border crossing.Kiefer’s use of both the miniature and the gigantic conveys the power of imagesand materials to condense and traverse microcosms and macrocosms of space(similar to reliquaries). Kiefer insists, ‘I think in images’, but also by‘descending into history, of descending into ourselves, into our innermostbeing’ through poetry, the Bible, mysticism and the contemplation of thematerial world. Kiefer seeks to negotiate passage to ‘Jerusalem’.By ending with Kiefer’s compelling juxtapositions, I hope to demonstrate thatthe ‘reliquary effect’ retains its power to move and make. Although Kieferretreats from performance, he has been justly accused of theatricality and acoercion of the viewer in this display.60 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref60]Kiefer’s vitrines put themselves forward as neutral enclosures, but as we haveobserved over and over again in the course of this discussion, the enclosureacts, organizes and intervenes. Spirit and matter might interpenetratemomentarily, but there is no stability in the result. These glass boxes hold usat a distance, deny access, force our steps in a circuitous route and oftenobscure rather than reveal. They loom over our heads in a threatening manner andthe relics inside seem expendable, replaceable, at times unspecific andunidentifiable. If these relics are memory objects, their meaning lies as muchin their material and the materials surrounding them as in their identity.In taking on the role of creator of a ‘neo-Jerusalem’ – but surely not heavenly– Kiefer implicates himself as artist/sinner/Nazi and challenges the viewer’sstatus as well, insisting on self-examination. He works to activate memory and‘keeps the Holocaust alive by evoking comparisons between the actions of theGerman perpetrator in the death camps and his own contemporary act of [artmaking]’.61 [13_References.xhtml#rch06ref61] In the tradition of relic/objectsthat have come before them, Kiefer’s works have the potential to move people toaction, to political dissent, to controversy, to discussion. As is the case withso many other contemporary artists, Kiefer’s relic strategies operate powerfullywithin an artistic practice that seeks to make sense of a problematic physicalworld – to force meaning from mute matter and material, to catch and holdmemories, to make political statements, to ease pain.images [images/f0271-01.png]95 Anselm Kiefer, Next Year in Jerusalem, installation view, Gagosian Gallery,New York, 2011, multimedia, paintings, vitrines; central element: lead, steel,photographic materials."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONTHE ACT OF enclosure vividly conveys both perceived value as well as the desireto preserve, protect or memorialize. Before the invention of clear glass in thefourteenth century, relics might be displayed as precious and powerful behind a‘window’ of rock crystal, itself precious. Today, in striking contrast, glassallows the indiscriminate use of the vitrine or display case, and our modernsociety might even be termed a ‘vitrine culture’: museums of course are filledwith glass cases, paintings are presented behind glass, shopping without displaywindows would be dull, and we go so far as to view our perishable food inglass-fronted refrigerators or freezers in supermarkets. Performers and artistshave even been known to use glass enclosures to take their work into publicspaces in the provocative display and containment of living bodies. Suchubiquitous, often unexamined behaviour might originate in a desire to controlmaterial substances; alternatively it allows the viewer to bask in the‘presence’ of things. Given that display is not always about seeing clearly,what are the issues at hand?1 [13_References.xhtml#rconref1] Is every container,every circumscribed and marked space, in some sense a reliquary? Surely thatgoes too far.The artist and writer Edmund de Waal has spent some time thinking about thevitrine. In discussing his family inheritance of a group of over two hundrednetsuke, the tiny and whimsical Japanese carved masterpieces in wood or ivory,he considers their enclosure and display to be intrinsic to their worth. Theseobjects once secured a Japanese man’s purse to his belt, but as time passed,they found a new life as Parisian collectibles representing a passion forJaponisme and were purchased by de Waal’s ancestor. De Waal writes:Netsuke cannot knock around your salon or your study unprotected. They get lostor dropped, dusty, chipped. They need a place to rest, preferably in company . .. The vitrines exist so that you can see objects, but not touch them; they framethings, suspend them, tantalise through distance.2[13_References.xhtml#rconref2]In considering tiny precious objects in a vitrine, de Waal praises thepossibility of opening the doors and taking out examples, examining them,rearranging them, telling stories with them, discussing them, but finallyreturning them to their green velvet habitat for security and safekeeping – allreminiscent of the way a medieval treasury or the Cabinet of Curiosity mighthave been used, but now staged with clear glass.In a more academic treatment of the issue, one scholar explicitly comparesvitrines to reliquaries, but signals that the vitrines represent an epistemicchange, a ‘liberating disenchantment of religious vision in scientific andconsumerist forms of display’, and marks yet another episteme in the ‘the emptycontainer of dehumanized commodity’ that is representative of contemporary art.3[13_References.xhtml#rconref3] Whether this is precisely correct or not, if somany artists of our time and times past take up reliquary strategies, perhaps weshould recognize enshrinement as an essential marker of meaning and enduringvalue.This book has discussed relics from many cultures (and thereby noted thatmaterial concerns are central to every society). In such treatment, however, Ihave not espoused a universal urge to relicing, the making of things intorelics. Rather I would like to assert that, insofar as matter tends towardsover-determined meaning in cultural environments, reliquary strategies are ameans of creating, communicating and perhaps even delimiting value. It is commonand meaningful to call significant matter or objects relics, and the use ofreliquaries and concomitant rituals are culturally shared practices, entailingnot only enshrinement, but also preservation (memory marking) and enlivenmentthrough ritual and story. Reliquaries hold memory, condense and focus story andritual, and therefore seem to be intrinsically powerful, creating at the least acertain mute strength and presence.A recent story from Russia reveals both the power but also, at the same time,the fragility of reliquary strategies.4 [13_References.xhtml#rconref4] Relics ofSaints Euthymios and Euphrosynia were the precious treasure of the RussianOrthodox Autonomous Church of Suzdal. In consequence of the Russian Revolution,relics were gathered from many sanctuaries, catalogued and stored as possessionsof the State. They were condemned as representative of religious superstition,but also seen as too powerful to be left in churches or destroyed. After thecollapse of the Soviet regime, such relics (and attendant icons) were reclaimedby their congregations, and the Russian Orthodox Church subsequently regainedits place as a powerful actor in Soviet politics (especially under VladimirPutin).The Church in Suzdal, however, was once allied to the Resistance and wasconsidered schismatic by the powerful Moscow Patriarchate. It is speculated thismay be the reason that the State once again intervened, attempting to confiscatethe church’s relics. Meeting resistance from the congregation, bailiffs took theextraordinary step of sealing the reliquary with ‘crime scene’ tape, placing thesaints ‘under arrest’. The case came to court and the legal team supporting theChurch’s rights mounted a surprising defence: they argued that the case had torely on the proper terminology for the remains in the reliquary, now doublysealed by both Church and State (and remaining unknown to all as they had neverbeen seen, the Church arguing that the State did not have the ‘skills’ to seethem). The State claimed a right to the material as cultural heritage. TheChurch countered that only if the material was identified as relics could it becultural heritage but, as relics, could never belong to the State which did notadmit to such a status (or participate in the belief that supported it). On theother hand, if the State persisted in labelling the confiscated material ashuman bodies, their actions were equally illegitimate because the State couldnot legally own bodies (slavery was invoked). The status of the relics waseffectively suspended by these arguments between ‘things’ and people.In the end, unfortunately, recourse to intellectual arguments may have provedtoo clever; acknowledging legal authority in any way may have defeated the causeof the Church as the final ruling inexplicably but, not surprisingly, wentagainst them. Ultimately, an inarticulate but fervent prayer may have been morepowerful and effective in demonstrating the power of faith and claiming therelics as foundational. This story once again demonstrates that despite theimperilled status of relics in the modern world, they persist and they continueto have power.For further proof, one can simply look to a long cultural history that supportssuch persistence – a history investigated in this book, a history that findsparallels across Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and the modern world. Indeed, theoldest of the relics and reliquaries discussed here are Buddhist, not Christian.The first surviving Buddhist examples are from Gandhara, a province that perhapsnot coincidentally was strongly influenced by Roman art and custom. Perhaps thisevidence should prompt us to seek shared origins for relic practice in theancient world, in hero cults and pantheism?5 [13_References.xhtml#rconref5]However, in addition to shared relic practice, we have seen distinctivevariations that separate cultures more than join them. Although Buddhism,Christianity and Islam share many cultural norms and even material goods (anIslamic glass vessel is preserved in the ninth-century treasury at Famen Si),many practices set the religions apart. But one scholar has suggested that evenJudaism takes up material practices in response to Christianity. Perhaps that isthe prism though which we should interpret the evidence – a long history of theexploitation and contestation of the material world.When we turn to look more closely at some examples, and here I look at thereliquary practices across Africa, differences may be more obvious thansimilarities. A closer look is merited. Relic practices are widespread inAfrica, common throughout the continent. Rather than shared communityexperience, however, African cults consist of ancestor worship and are primarilyexpressed as family burial processes. Many relics are private, owned byindividuals and are kept in homes, remaining secret and hidden from thecommunity (illus. 96 [12_Conclusion.xhtml#fig96]).6[13_References.xhtml#rconref6] The reliquaries are, however, often visible andare ambitious multimedia assemblages with many aspects of ornamentation. Insofaras nineteenth- and early twentieth-century examples have survived, they seem tohave been composed of a large container, often a basket, which housed acollection of human remains. In an exceptionally well-preserved Kota example inParis, the container is ornamented with an exuberant ‘skirt’ of twisted andworked leather which may reference rituals of animal offerings to the ancestors.Above, an intricately surfaced Guardian figure protects the container.In certain regions of Africa, Guardian figures take the form of ideallyproportioned and powerfully constructed simulacra of human bodies, but in thisKotu example, the ‘body’ follows a different type – it is emphatically abstract,consisting of an openwork lozenge (not legs as this structure is sometimes takento be), surmounted by a mask-like face typically inscribed with a cross. Boththe cross and lozenge are cosmic forms that facilitate travel in the afterlifewhile ‘reflective qualities of the surfaces evoke the body of water that servesas the fluid boundary between these two realms of existence’.7[13_References.xhtml#rconref7] These reflective surfaces are metal overlaysadded to the wood of the figure. Metal was a powerful material in sub-SaharanAfrica, and smiths were privy to mystic powers and esoteric knowledge. TheseKotu Guardians typically received ornamentation only on the face, sometimes onlyon the front of the face, but the use of multiple metals was common and no twofaces are the same. In this example, the emphatic eyebrows draw attention toboth the large eyes and a strong nose shape, and the head retains its originalhalo of feathers. Red colours are repeated in the face and in the feathers andmay refer to blood with associations of both vitality and sacrifice.images [images/f0277-01.png]96 Kotu peoples, Mindumu group, Gabon, basket reliquary with guardian figure,19th century, wood, iron, copper, lead, zinc, feathers, fibre, leather, bone andskin, h. 58 cm, Musée du Quai Branly, Paris.In African reliquaries the bones of ancestors are brought together afterelaborate rituals of preparation of the body (although the Paris example has thebones of only one man). The relics of a lineage were conceived of as being morepowerful when grouped together, but contents were changeable. Over time, some ofthe ancestors might lose power, and the reliquaries would have to be ‘fortified’with fresh power in the form of more recent ancestors. (Arguably, this happensin the Christian Middle Ages with saints waxing and waning in influence andpower, but I have never heard of a saint being retired except by the scholars,the Bollandistes.) Given that they resided in homes, such reliquaries interactedin daily life, particularly by way of dreams. The relics could convey power tomembers of the lineage and even to objects that were placed in front of them.Such focus on benefits for a lineage might be compared to Roman practices withlares or household gods, as well as to the private manipulation of Christianrelics, but has less in common with Christian community-oriented practices.In the Mediterranean, we saw shared practice and sometimes practices that werepurposefully differentiated from a competing culture. The Muslim disdain of bodyparts, all the while accepting hair and nail parings as relics, is one suchdifferentiation from the Christian acceptance of bone relics and bodilydismemberment. Although there are superficial similarities between Africanreliquaries and Christian examples – large eyes on heads, mixed media, hiddenrelics, the significance of metals – African practices of preserving andcelebrating relics, and making reliquaries, in general do not seem to overlapsignificantly with Mediterranean practice. Rather than drawing a negativeconclusion from these observations, however, I would contend that this lack ofcorrelation is of significant interest – it may point to the possibility of adiscernable differentiation between shared cultures versus shared humantendencies for ‘relic-ing’. It encourages comparative studies under certaincircumstances – to find parallels that are historical and not just formal orsuperficial – and points to the need for a more anthropological understanding ofthe power of material in other instances and across all human societies.Although in post-Reformation and post-Enlightenment societies – the modern world– the faith that sustained reliquary practice has disappeared for manyadherents, in many environments, especially the Catholic Church, cult structureshave remained strong, maintaining a powerful system of communication that hasbeen refined and reinforced over centuries of use. Many observers, even when notthemselves devout, recognize the power of such a language of objects and forms.It is precisely within these circumstances that I have defined what I am callinga ‘reliquary effect’ – that is, multiply expressive elements of enclosing,enshrining, mixing interior and exterior, playing hide and seek, denyinguniqueness in favour of replication and community, and focusing on the potentialof matter. In this sense, something can work like a reliquary without being areliquary. As we have seen, a reliquary effect sustains objects within celebrityculture and contemporary art making.Notwithstanding such arguments, one further question persists. What is thestatus of the modern Christian reliquary? There is admittedly much that isderivative, but there are also some wonderful modernist interpretations of thereliquary tradition. Monstrance starburst-like objects in Germany and shiningand simplified chasse forms in churches in France and Belgium show a reverencefor tradition. Dom Martin (1889–1965), a metal-worker who expressed his faith byjoining a monastery, the Abbey of Keizersberg in Leuven, made innovativereliquaries and liturgical service objects by exploring a range of materialsfrom horn to lapis lazuli with stunning effect in exquisite art deco pieces.8[13_References.xhtml#rconref8] Nevertheless, if we seek innovative form that isworthy of the term modernist, there could be no better example than therestructured shrine for the Merovingian saint in the Collegiate Church of StGertrude in Nivelles (illus. 97 [12_Conclusion.xhtml#fig97]).A reliquary must by necessity be a memory object, capturing and reflecting theprayers, needs and history of a shrine, a saint, a town. Indeed, this book beganwith a description and picture of the original thirteenth-century shrine fromNivelles (see illus. 1 [05_Introduction.xhtml#fig1]), a beautiful Gothic fantasycathedral populated with courtly and gracious figures, both saints as well asother inhabitants of a paradisiacal realm, turning gently to speak to oneanother in a magical space of sacra converzatione. Each is framed by thegorgeous arches and the rose windows of the shrine. On the roof, the story ofthe primary saint, Gertrude, was told in narrative scenes, something a number ofsimilar shrines, especially German ones, were prone to do. Gertrude herself,gracious abbess, stood at the ‘crossing’ of the micro-cathedral, held crozierand book and was backed by a starry field, surrounded by gems and spolia enamels(most likely from a yet earlier shrine of the tenth century), and greeted byangels. Seraphim stood guard at the upper edge of the shrine, as did the HolySpirit who held a crown in his dove’s beak. The rose window was ‘lit’ bytransparent enamels. All this beauty was the pride of the town of Nivelles, butunfortunately did not survive the Second World War. Destroyed in German bombingraids on 14 May 1940, only scraps of the shrine were recovered.images [images/f0280-01.png]97 Félix Roulin, reliquary of St Gertrude, 1982, silver, reused enamels andother spolia, l. c. 180 cm, Collegiate Church of St Gertrude, Nivelles, Belgium.However, in what I would term a brilliant realization of a contemporary shrine,and also a culmination of centuries of tradition, bits of old ornament and castsof other recovered remnants were embedded by the sculptor Félix Roulin in 1982,again as spolia, in the new sleek form that stands in the church today. The useof spolia is a break, a ‘visible seam’ that marks an awareness of the history ofthe object and its remaking.9 [13_References.xhtml#rconref9] In the Nivelleschasse, the ancient forms of figures and ornament seem as if trapped, strugglingto break free from a miasma of silver, or, alternately (simultaneously?), as ifform was coming to realization in a Terminator-like emergence from a pool ofquicksilver. The profile of the shrine recalls the overall shape of the originalshrine-cathedral, but now limns that shape in a series of modernist curves thatevoke the space rather than define it, recalling the interior space of thecathedral rather than the exterior – the soar, not the structure.One sees the function of the shrine made apparent. The staves by which theshrine is carried delimit the second storey and assertively protrude out fromthe front and rear edges, as if the shrine were ready to be taken up inprocession, declaring itself to be not a thing that rests, but a thing thatmoves. Finding its place in the modern world while memorializing its preciouspast, this wonderfully effective shrine is a locus of the holy, a stimulus forprayer and ritual, and a memory cache for its people, recalling both Gertrudeand her previous shrines and marking the suffering and losses of the war.But, finally, it is not in a ‘reliquary’ that we find the end point for ourdiscussion but in a contemporary shrine, one truly expressive of our era – MayaLin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Decisively taking up the ideas of material andmonumental commemoration and turning them into process (completed 1982, illus.98 [12_Conclusion.xhtml#fig98]), the memorial represents a lithic environmentlike other stone ‘monuments’ I discussed in the first chapter, but also teachesand shapes behaviour just as all great and successful reliquaries or shrines do.The black stone of the memorial was specially chosen for the possibility of amirror-like finish. As one looks at it, it looks back, as if the past wereprojected into the present. Only the engraved names of the dead disrupt thesurface. An abstraction that simultaneously invokes the body, it was called ‘ablack gash of shame’ in its controversial early moments; with its completion andsubsequent popularity, the metaphor shifted to a ‘wound that was healing’.10[13_References.xhtml#rconref10]images [images/f0282-01.png]98 Maya Lin, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 1982, 75.21 × 3.1 m tapering to 20 cm,Constitution Gardens adjacent to the National Mall, Washington, dc.Families of the commemorated dead have responded to the persuasions of theshrine en masse: they stop and take rubbings of the name of their beloved andleave mementos (ex-votos?) as they depart (gathered by the National Park Serviceas a sort of archive). The space has come to be perceived as a ‘shrine’ andvandalism has been minimal and perceived as ‘desecration’. Repairs and additionsto the names (originally 58,191) do not disturb a perceived unity and wholeness.Indeed, further evidence of the power of the wall is apparent in the copies ithas generated: a site that has its ‘non-sites’ in the form of at least fourtravelling versions of the wall as well as other more permanent iterations.Any viewer becomes quiet in the presence of the sombre dark stone with so manynames, aware in entering the space of the monument that he or she is descendingas the wall looms larger, now overhead, and the number of names – correspondingto the deaths caused by the war and peaking in 1975 – come to their apex. Theviewer, pausing, enclosed, looking, then ascending once more, becomes finallyaware of a larger context – the Washington ‘Mall’ with its many memorial pieces,the ascending obelisk of the Washington Monument – all speaking to the historyof a nation, but none as powerful as this sacred space manipulating the formsthat have such a very long history.The body and the notion of human presence are, and always have been, a powerfulmeans to create a ‘community’ of viewership, playing upon our intrinsicinstincts for empathy and identification. Using psychological tools includingrevulsion, as well as attraction, enclosure and the power of materials, artistsfrom the medieval to the contemporary have induced a sense of wonder in ourrelation with the material object. This sense of wonder endows these objectswith significance out of proportion to any intrinsic worth. This is surelytestimony to the ‘reliquary effect’, shaping our response to the material worldwe inhabit."},{"pageContent":"REFERENCESINTRODUCTION: THE ETERNAL RELIC1 [05_Introduction.xhtml#intro1ref1] Alexander Nagel and Christopher S.

Kent Garber disparaged the wall, calling it a gash."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSAfter the scholarly nature of my 2012 book, Strange Beauty, with itsthousand-plus footnotes and hundreds of bibliographic entries, it has been apleasure to write this book and to set myself at play in this field ofknowledge. Relics and reliquaries are mysterious things and exploring theirsecrets has been a fascinating task. This is only a beginning, of course, asthere is so much more to know and understand. But I take this material as achallenge to myself and to others to understand the intelligence of materialthings. I most particularly do not imagine that relics and their use is asuperstitious practice. Unlike a recent author who ends his book concerningrelics with the triumph of Protestantism, I know our concern with relics has notended; there are still material things that intrigue and provoke us whether wehave faith or not.Many people engaged me in this project over many, many years but I cannot hopeto thank any but the most immediate over the last few years: Martina Bagnoli,Tim Benton, Suzanne Preston Blier, Barbara Boehm, Ra’anan Boustan, BrigitteBuettner, Wenshing Chou, Lynne Cook, Sally Cornelison, Elizabeth Cropper, TomDale, Anne Dunlop, Jaś Elsner, Claire Farago, Barry Flood, Sherry Fowler, JackFreiberg, Cecilia Gaposchkin, David Germano, Oleg Grabar, Emily Guerry, Anne D.Hedeman, Helen Hills, Sandra Hindman, Jessica Horton, C.

They have taught me as much as I have tried toteach them.Editorial work and general discussion supplied by Cathleen Bell has beenessential to improvements to the text.I am especially indebted to the Center for the Advanced Study of the Visual Artsat the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, for a year-long membership, tothe Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton for a summer membership, to HunterCollege for a Scholar Incentive Grant and an award from the Presidential Fundfor Scholarship. Additional support for this project was provided by twogenerous PSC-CUNY Awards, jointly funded by The Professional Staff Congress andThe City University of New York.To my partner in travel and discovery, John Coonley Davies, I am greatlyindebted. If he did not drive while I navigated, so many of these mysterieswould not have been revealed. He also served as the non-specialist reader,unraveller and photoshopper/cook. I give him my love and respect. This book isdedicated to him."},{"pageContent":"PHOTO ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe author and publishers wish to express their thanks to the following sourcesof illustrative material and/or permission to reproduce it.© 2014 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn: 88, 89;photos author: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 29, 30, 34, 35, 39, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52,59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 90, 98; photos ©Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich: 55, 56; photo © Boltin PictureLibrary/Bridgeman Images: 25; photo bpk, Berlin/Alte Pinakothek, BayerischeStaatsgemäldesammlungen, Munich/© Art Resource, NY: 41; British Museum, London(photos © Trustees of the British Museum): 38, 53, 54; photos © Trustees of theBritish Museum, London: 79, 83; photo Lutz Engelhardt (© Dommuseum Hildesheim):13; © James Fraher for Offaly County Council, Tullamore, Co.
