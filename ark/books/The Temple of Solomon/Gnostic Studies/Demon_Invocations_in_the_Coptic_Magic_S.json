DEMON INVOCATIONS IN THE COPTIC MAGICAL SPELLS David FRANKFURTER, Durham∗ Do people worship demons ? The question arises with a number of Coptic magical texts in which the Devil, demons, or explicitly marginal spirits (such as those connected with Amente) — are invoked in some fashion. The question also arises in connection with a scholarly paradigm about « magic » that increasingly demands critical examination : that people who seek to do harm or exploit others or disrupt relationships by means of magical spells invoke evil spirits from a dark and debased counter-pantheon ; while appeals for health, protection, and success address the great gods of the central religion. Indeed, this paradigm makes the pantheon of demons fundamentally opposed to the central cult pantheon — in our case, P-Noute, Christ, Mary, and all the saints and martyrs1. This paper, then, will examine the types of peripheral or chaotic spirits — « demons » — invoked in Coptic spells for aid in coercing some individual. In what ways, I ask, can we speak of a separate « demonic pantheon » suitable for magical purposes ? From what domains did Egyptian Christian ritual experts construct their systems of supernatural powers ? A. THE CORPUS OF SPELLS : OVERVIEW My review of the principal Coptic spell collections found fifteen Coptic spells that appealed in some way to supernatural figures whom we could reaso-nably classify as « demonic » rather than « angelic » or « divine » — although I plan to complicate this classification shortly. The spells fall generally under the category of binding — that is, to constrain some individual to do something one ∗ I am grateful to the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and to the Center for Humanities of the University of New Hampshire for providing travel funds for this conference. 1 E.g., BARB, « Survival of Magic Arts », esp. p. 103 ; LUCK, Ancient Pathways, esp. p. 211.

Indeed, six of these spells aim to bind women for sexual purposes ; while others seek, for example, the separation of a couple, the punishment of perjurors, and even the prevention of a man’s seduction of a wo-man by afflicting him with impotence. All these rather harsh intentions on the part of clients — and indulged by the ritual experts who keep these spells in the ready — certainly lend themselves to the scholarly paradigm that views « magic » as selfish, antisocial, and violent, a paradigm that I shall also criticize in this paper. Who, then, are the demonic powers invoked ? Already a simple angel/demon dichotomy breaks down in my sample. While three spells invoke the Devil by name and one (Heidelberg 500) invokes two figures who « waged war with the angels and cherubim », nine spells invoke figures associated with Amente, the Underworld, and only two name traditional demons of early Christian tradition : Bersebour and Asmodeus. Already we must reckon with the fact that « invoking demons » in magical spells does not involve uniform appeals to — nor in any way « devotion to » — the realm of Satan, as church and monastic leaders imagined it2. The realms of the demonic in my sample are too diverse. Nor can we equate these demons with the central gods of the old Pharaonic religion, as « pagan survivals »3. They all function coherently within a Christian cosmology dominated by P-Noute, Christ, and saints, yet as dangerous, oppositional spirits associated with disorderly power. In what ways, then, can we comprehend their nature as « demons » ? B. THE DEMONOLOGY OF COPTIC SPELLS 1. Satan and Satanic Demons Let us look first at the invocations of the Devil : Diabolos, Satanas, Mastema. In the three spells that specifically invoke this figure he clearly functions as a folkloric anti-hero, not the evil Prince of Deception promulgated by Church and monastic authorities4. In one London spell, Mastema embodies erotic passion ; and it is to the apocryphal legend of his transferring that passion through his sweat to Eve that the spell refers. Indeed, as Jacques van der Vliet has proposed, the legend itself may have arisen to sanction the preparation of a love potion — as « sweat of Mastema »5. It is a disorderly, dangerous passion that the Devil offers, 2 Cp. Jerome, Vita Hilarionis 2 ; Codex Theodosianus 9.16.7 ; ACM 73 (p. 2 : Cyprian tries unsuccessfully to seduce Justina by « the powers of Satan » before invoking heavenly powers).

And the same is true for the Michigan text : a « spirit whose head is in heaven, whose feet are in the abyss » should « descend to Amente and uproot all the thoughts of the Devil about N »6. The Devil here is a denizen or prisoner of Amente who harbors in himself the very erotic passion upon which the spell seeks to draw. We come closer to the « Satanic » Devil in the second two of the spells : Satanas declares himself God, and Bachouch and Bikmn oppose the angels. Each case draws upon ancient Jewish ideas of Satan’s fall or the angels’ fall, recalling the Enochic Book of the Watchers and later texts (1 En 6-13 ; Wisdom 2:23-24). Yet what is invoked in these spells is not an evil borne of opposing heaven and hating the cosmos but specific paradigmatic actions : in the one case, the mutual conflict of heavenly forces ; in the other, a gesture of divine provocation : « I am also a god ! » Meant to take effect in the social world, these actions are imagined in human, even tragic terms7. Indeed, the Heidelberg text includes drawings of Bachouch and Bikmn that render these beings as versions of the Egyptian god Seth — a disorderly but not evil god who was still invoked in the Greek magical papyri. The overall effect of the invocation of these demons is to conjure an image of chaotic power that the ritual can direct, not cosmic evil8. In this respect, the fundamental context of ritual, we should note also the importance of names attached to Satanic demons : not simply Satanas but also Mastema and Bachuch/ Bikmn. Names, especially esoteric names, offer linch-pins for the direction of supernatural forces (cp. Testament of Solomon ; Mk 5:7-9). Coptic liturgy seems to have been a veritable factory for the production of such esoteric names : one homily calls the angel whom God cast out of heaven, to be punished by the Four Bodiless Creatures, Saklataboth9. 2. Amente Demons These last four spells are the only examples I have found of direct appeals to the Devil or diabolical beings. By far the most frequent « demons » invoked in the Coptic spells consist of underworld beings : the archons of Amente. Most of these figures are distinctive for their specific functions in Amente : Theumatha, who dwells in Gehenna with fiery tongs (ACM 79) ; Temelouchos, « the one who ... tortures the lawless and the liars and the perjurors » (ACM 92) ; the six powers of death, « who bring every sickness down upon every person » and 6 Ed.

The picture is of an elaborate realm of monstrous beings who serve eternally in specific roles to punish and destroy. There is also the sense that each of these monsters is bound to a name that can be invoked for purposes in this world. The other Amente-demons are invoked with respect to their authority in the underworld : Louchme, with his « fiery throne » (ACM 116) ; Dimelouchos, who presides over Judgment (ACM 82) ; and Tartarouchos, who is « a god also » (ACM 75)12. All these « demons », then, are figures of liminal authority — masters of that monstrous land of the dead — with the capacity to be called upon, to carry their disruptive powers out of that world, where they belong, into a world where they don’t belong, to accomplish specific tasks. As authorities over Amente, these spirits serve also the maintenance of justice in the cosmos — in the sense of the just punishment of the wicked. Given the disruption and brutality they seem to pose to our world, it might be strange to imagine — still in the Byzantine period — that Amente-demons could represent a kind of justice. But this function is underlined in the Berlin text invoking Temelouchos : revenge is sought against perjurors in this world by appeal to the being who destroys perjurors in Amente. Amente demons in many ways thus represent a greater justice, if a more dangerous and uncontrollable one. This idea is actually illustrated quite vividly in the mural of Hell found in an ancient church in Tebtunis. The mural portrays the Amente-archons Abbaton, Aftemeluchos, and a « Dekan who chews souls » in the grotesque process of punishing sinners13. It is also illustrated in the story of the sorcerer Astratolē embedded in the Martyrdom of Ss. Shenoufe and his Brethren. Seeking to learn more about the underworld, he descends there by his « magician’s art ». But « the demons [n-daimōn] surrounded him, and some of them said, ‘Let us behead him !’ Others said, ‘Let us flay him alive !’ Others said, ‘Let us remove his nails !’ In short, they were contemplating giving him great punishments. » When he cannot save himself by appeal to heavenly powers, Astratolē invokes Christ — a 10 Cf.

In the later Coptic Discourse on Abbaton, of course, Abbaton emerges as a monstrous metamorphosis of the loyal angel Muriel : now sporting seventy heads, long tusks, and scythe-like fingers, Abbaton is « established » in the cosmos to terrify souls out of their bodies at the time of death15. Many texts indeed underline the danger of Amente spirits in similar terms of monstrous appearance : for example, the serpentine faces of the « Six Powers of Death » according to the Coptic Book of Bartholomew16. The Amente spirits are violent, bloodthirsty, and not to be trifled with — hence they are labelled daimōn in some texts. Yet in disciplining the sorcerer they ultimately maintain the pre-servation of order and boundaries in the cosmos. We would then classify Amente spirits as « demonic » only for their function as monstrous denizens of the under-world, not by association with Satan or opposition to God. They function like — and indeed inherit many aspects of — the punishing angels of Jewish apocalyptic visions, who can also present horrific appearances : « Their faces were like a leopard, their tusks being outside their mouth [like] the wild boars. Their eyes were mixed with blood. Their hair was loose like the hair of women, and fiery scourges were in their hands17. » 3. Unaffiliated Demons The three demons that are neither Devil nor Amente demon — Bersebour, Asmodeus, and Keuentios Patilos, seem no more Satanic than the others. Asmodeus, of course, is an ancient and well-known chief-demon from early Judaism (Tobit 3:8 ; Testament of Solomon 5). The name Bersebour probably derives from Baalzebul, a well-known Semitic local god and part of learned demonology from ancient times18. The legend of « one who has fallen from his invisible chariot and been cast into outer darkness » (ACM 87) may point again to the Devil : some mythical downfall that would incline a figure to come and resolve a crisis in our world19. 14 Pierpont Morgan Codex M583, f. 119v I, ed.

C. THE INVOCATION OF PERIPHERAL POWERS But why invoke such monstrous powers in the first place, whether devil, demon, or Amente archon ? What connection is there between the disruptive functions of these spells and the nature of the beings invoked ? Under what circumstances do people appeal to demons ? It is important to note that there is no general correlation between binding spells for erotic or malicious goals and the demonic character of the beings in-voked. On the contrary, one need only peruse the chief collections of Coptic magical texts to see that most curses and binding spells appeal to P-Noute, Christ, and archangels. « Mary who bore Jesus, you must bring [the victim] away by means of an ulcerous tumor », demands one spell (ACM 101) ; « May (the) curse (of) P-Noute descend upon Alo and her entire household », demands one Apa Victor in another (ACM 104) ; a third appeals to the holy martyrs to rain havoc and pestilence on « Joor and his wife » (ACM 108). The Coptic erotic spell of Cyprian of Antioch (ACM 73) is introduced with a story about the inadequacy of Satanic powers to conquer the heart of one Justina, leading Cyprian to invoke instead « the Father of the aeons, the Lord of every lordship » in order to bind her to his desires. P-Noute, Christ, and the rest of the Egyptian Christian pantheon are adjured in these spells as arbiters of justice called in to resolve crises with proper vengeance and authority. But these beings function, according to the classifi-cation proposed by the anthropologist I.M. Lewis, as central morality spirits : that is, divine figures whom the dominant religious system promotes as guardians of social and political order and public ritual20. What might be the distinctive contexts for invoking what Lewis calls peripheral spirits, and the Church called demons and the Devil ? 1. The Bricolage of the Ritual Expert First of all, we must recognize a performative context for such invocations. Each spell represents, fundamentally, the creative, ad hoc constructions of tra-dition — the bricolages — of a ritual expert, probably a monk or church scribe. He composes the invocation, the gestures, and the ingredients to convey efficacy through the combined features of tradition — that these are ancient names and 20 LEWIS, Ecstatic Religion, p. 27-30, 63-64."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"DEMON-INVOCATIONS 7 figures ; authority — that these are recognizable names and figures associated with power, perhaps with the church and its liturgical lore ; and pertinence — that the words spoken, the substances used, the whole « theatre » of ritual binding, pertains intrinsically to the experience of the client. The whole process of collec-ting and editing master spells and presiding over their performance involves this kind of creative synthesis, in which the choice and articulation of spirits comprise the key component. Indeed, the importance of this performative dimension of ritual bricolages emerges especially in the use of ingredients. In many spells, the ingredients, the ritual materials, form the basis for designating spirits : a potion becomes Mastema’s passionate sweat (ACM 78) ; a bit of oil or iron might become opportunities for invoking other liminal beings in historiolae — magical narratives (cf. ACM 82)21. These exigencies of ritual performance, as well as the ritual expert’s own crea-tive preferences, go far in explaining the choice of peripheral rather than central morality spirits to motivate these spells. In contrast, it is quite difficult to find a systematic, cosmological rationale for why « demons » should be specified rather than angels. Many historiolae bear out this observation : the Strasbourg text in-vents a spirit « who has fallen from his invisible chariot and has been cast into the outer darkness » (ACM 87) — thus for this ritual bricoleur a spirit proper to the endeavor of striking a man with impotence. The critical element here, indeed, is not the historiola but the name — Keuentios Patilos Kous Makous — which completes the invocation. So also in the Coptic Museum papyrus that invokes Aknator the Ethiopian (ACM 119) : This spell, for gaining various powers, draws a verbal and an iconic picture of this peripheral spirit, associating him not just with a barbarian land — Ethiopia — but also with Amente. A wild spirit is cons-tructed and filled out for ritual purposes. Other spells display similar creativity with historiolae, combining names with mythical landscapes and stories : Elouch, Belouch, and Barbarouch under a mountain peak in Amente (ACM 116) ; and Bakhoukh and Bikmn, the angels who fell from heaven, in a spell that draws on Jewish apocalyptic legend for its aura of tradition (Heid. 500/1). So the choice of appealing to peripheral spirits — those associated with Amente, the Devil, or learned demonological tradition — can be understood largely in the context of the inclinations of particular ritual experts, who will present themselves as variously learned in esoteric names and cosmo-logy — and variously adept at « filling out » the characters of peripheral spirits22. 21 Cf. FRANKFURTER, « Narrating Power ». 22 See FRANKFURTER, Religion in Roman Egypt, p. 257-261, and « Dynamics of Ritual Expertise »."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"David FRANKFURTER 8 2. The Appeal of Peripheral Spirits But among clients there may also be an inclination towards invoking peri-pheral, rather than central morality, spirits in some circumstances, even with the knowledge that official religious leaders repudiate these spirits. What are the contexts in which people might do this ? We can learn much about these ritual situations from early modern European inquisition records, which offer volu-minous evidence for local magic and ritual expertise in sixteenth-to-eighteenth-century Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil. First of all, we learn that the situations that impel people to seek binding spells, especially of a sexual nature, can be quite desperate : mothers in fear of losing their husbands to other women, for example, or fathers in fear of losing their daughters to unapproved suitors — not the stereotype of men trying selfishly to steal others’ wives23. These ritual situations are enmeshed in real social and do-mestic crises. Thus, while ritual experts may usually invoke central morality spirits out of the conviction that Christ and Mary will bring justice to an unjust situation24, there are many occasions when appeal to a peripheral spirit, from the realm of repudiated beings like Mastema or Asmodeus, will match the despera-tion of the crisis. Moreover, we often find chief peripheral spirits — the masters of spirits of death, chaos, and affliction — invoked to protect in dire situations. This is a cross-cultural pattern : witness Kālī and Garuda in South Asia, Bhairava and other dangerous protector deities in Himalayan religions, and Santa Muerte and San Simon in contemporary Mexico25, but even more in Egypt : Seth, Bastet, Taweret, and in the Roman period Petbe and Toutou26. Indeed, Petbe, a regional god well-known to Shenoute of Atripe, is invoked in just this capacity in one spell ; but the ritual expert makes him chief in Amente (ACM 118)27. All these 23 Cf. BULLARD, « Hide and Secrete » ; O’NEIL, « Magical Healing » ; SÁNCHEZ ORTEGA, « Sorcery and Eroticism » ; and SOUZA, The Devil and the Land of the Holy Cross, ch. 5. 24 E.g., the following « notice » posted on the door of Pope John Paul II Bookstore, Hamtramck, Michigan (USA), as of 8 Aug. 1990: « This establishment has been placed / under the care and pro-tection of / ... /the Blessed Virgin Mary / ... / Any person or group* / who hinders or harms / in any way whatsoever / indirectly or directly / intended or accomplished / by word or by deed / the person or property of anyone / in any way associated with / (no matter how remotely) / an establishment de-dicated thus / invokes therefore ‘THE CURSE OF GOD’ / upon him/her/itself, /... / Since the curse is self-inflicted / by the doer of the deed, / it can only be undone by / the guilty one who is to blame. / NO ONE — such as a relative, friend, saint, / or Christ himself — may intervene on their behalf. » 25 Cf.

But there is another context for popular invocation of the Devil, we learn from the European and Latin American cases, and that is the fact that he exists as part of the Christian cosmos. Despite ecclesiastical attempts to « edit out », to marginalize and repudiate, so-called « demons » and the Devil, the lay recipients of this dualistic universe find themselves with effectively two potent cosmic moieties : the central morality spirits under God and the peripheral spirits, asso-ciated with the Devil and demons. Church authorities insist that proper power comes from the center only ; but layfolk and ritual experts behold a range of beings, some peripheral and some central, but all of whom present types of supernatural potency. Living in the landscape, one is forced to negotiate with this full range, not simply avoid those deemed demonic. Indeed, in some cases the very demonization of spirits traditionally asso-ciated with certain places, or festivals, or natural events (like the Nile surge), has had the effect of preserving them as potent beings. Hence devils and demons are often viewed with a sort of ancestral familiarity28. If we are most familiar with this tendency to domesticate the Devil in Europe and Latin America, we can see it also in the Coptic spells’ constructions of the Devil as an embodiment of passion. Overall, a range of peripheral spirits that church leaders might view as evil and contrary to cosmic order, villagers view on a continuum with the central mo-rality spirits, as complementary powers. Just as Christ may be invoked to seduce the girl next door, the Devil may be invoked to resolve a lawsuit29. 3. Peripheral Amente Spirits in the Egyptian Imagination It is likely that Amente-demons had a particular utility in late antique Egypt as an especially articulated realm of peripheral spirits. One notices, first of all, that the Coptic spells keep Amente-demons distinct from the Devil (ACM 82). They are rarely labelled « demons » — and then only to highlight their peripheral nature (ACM 79). But more generally, between Coptic magical texts and Coptic apocryphal texts, one does get the impression of an elaborate, if fluid, mortuary pantheon in late antique Egypt30. And the idea of such a mortuary pantheon would have provided a source not only for apocalyptic narratives and wall-paintings, but also for ritual experts’ bricolages of peripheral spirits. Of course, 28 Cf. CERVANTES, The Devil in the New World, p. 46-53 ; MEYER, Translating the Devil, p. 83-111 ; FRANKFURTER, « Syncretism and the Holy Man », p. 351-364. 29 Cf. SCOTT, « Protest and Profanation », p. 22-25. 30 PIANKOFF, « La descente aux enfers » ; DUNAND, « Pratiques et croyances funéraires » ; MONTSERRAT, « Burial Practices »."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"David FRANKFURTER 10 as Jan Zandee argued (perhaps too strenuously), one cannot infer a smooth transition of mortuary beliefs from Pharaonic Egypt. And yet, the well-defined range of Coptic Amente-spirits obviously continued many ideas from earlier Egyptian tradition, especially regarding the punishments that take place in Amente31. More important than putative « pagan survivals », however, is the broader sense, among ritual experts and their clients, a) that there existed a class of monstrous, bloodthirsty spirits belonging functionally and topographically to the periphery ; b) that this realm — Amente — had a system of roles and hierarchy ; c) that this realm actually contributed to cosmic order ; and d) that by this know-ledge of the names and features of these beings, the ritual expert could call upon them. In this mode, grounded always in ritual applications (including liturgical and graphic expressions), Christian ritual experts were able to maintain this class of spirits from earlier Egyptian tradition and to keep them familiar — a resource for ritual invocation. D. CONCLUSION In the end, the « demons » invoked in Egyptian-Christian spells amount neither to demon « worship » nor to an engagement with demons or the Devil as evil beings. Instead, we find a range of peripheral spirits, named, placed, and « narrated » according to the exigencies of the ritual situation. Some have heri-tages in Egyptian mortuary mythology, some in early apocalyptic texts, but many more, like the Devil-Mastema, coalesce out of the rich field of tradition and eso-teric lore that ritual experts in late antique Egypt maintained and drew upon — those monks and shrine attendants who purveyed oils and amulets and diverse « blessings »32. Indeed, we might conclude that, among the local Christianities of late antique Egypt, all spirits were potentially ambivalent, capable of harming or protecting, of being influenced by holy names and spells, and of shifting between liturgical and personal roles. This field of tradition and lore, which spread between monastery, festival, and ritual-professionals’ environments, only distantly reflected the stark dualism of Shenoute and church fathers, with its predacious cosmic Satan and exorcistic holy men33. Rather, the spirits of the periphery — the punishers of Amente, the demons of biblical lore, and especially the masters 31 ZANDEE, Death as an Enemy, p. 147-173, 200-226, 328-330. In what seems an intermediary stage in the transmission of such Amente spirits, the 2nd/3rd-century Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth (NHC VI, 6) instructs that the teachings contained therein should be carved in stone and placed in a shrine with « eight guardians [phylax] ... the males on the right are frog-faced, and the females on the left are cat-faced » (68.4-10). 32 Cf.
