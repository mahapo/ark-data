For years even the identity of the discoverer remainedunknown. One rumor held that he was a blood avenger; another, that he had made the find nearthe town of Naj 'Hammádì at the Jabal al-Tárif, a mountain honeycombed with more than 150caves. Originally natural, some of these caves were cut and painted and used as grave sites asearly as the sixth dynasty, some 4,300 years ago.Thirty years later the discoverer himself, Muhammad 'Alí al-Sammán; told what happened.Shortly before he and his brothers avenged their father's murder in a blood feud, they had saddledtheir camels and gone out to the Jabal to dig for sabakh, a soft soil they used to fertilize theircrops. Digging around a massive boulder, they hit a red earthenware jar, almost a meter high.Muhammad 'Alí hesitated to break the jar, considering that a jinn, or spirit, might live inside. Butrealizing that it might also contain gold, he raised his mattock, smashed the jar, and discoveredinside thirteen papyrus books, bound in leather. Returning to his home in al-Qasr, Muhammad'All dumped the books and loose papyrus leaves on the straw piled on the ground next to theoven. Muhammad's mother, 'Umm-Ahmad, admits that she burned much of the papyrus in theoven along with the straw she used to kindle the fire.A few weeks later, as Muhammad 'Alí tells it, he and his brothers avenged their father's death bymurdering Ahmed Isma'il. Their mother had warned her sons to keep their mattocks sharp: whenthey learned that their father's enemy was nearby, the brothers seized the opportunity, \"hacked offhis limbs . . . ripped out his heart, and devoured it among them, as the ultimate act of bloodrevenge.\"-1-"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Fearing that the police investigating the murder would search his house and discover the books,Muhammad 'Alí asked the priest, al-Qummus Basiliyus Abd al-Masih, to keep one or more forhim. During the time that Muhammad 'Alí and his brothers were being interrogated for murder,Raghib, a local history teacher, had seen one of the books, and suspected that it had value. Havingreceived one from al-Qummus Basiliyus, Raghib sent it to a friend in Cairo to find out its worth.Sold on the black market through antiquities dealers in Cairo, the manuscripts soon attracted theattention of officials of the Egyptian government. Through circumstances of high drama, as weshall see, they bought one and confiscated ten and a half of the thirteen leather-bound books,called codices, and deposited them in the Coptic Museum in Cairo. But a large part of thethirteenth codex, containing five extraordinary texts, was smuggled out of Egypt and offered forsale in America. Word of this codex soon reached Professor Gilles Quispel, distinguished historianof religion at Utrecht, in the Netherlands. Excited by the discovery, Quispel urged the JungFoundation in Zurich to buy the codex. But discovering, when he succeeded, that some pageswere missing, he flew to Egypt in the spring of 1955 to try to find them in the Coptic Museum.Arriving in Cairo, he went at once to the Coptic Museum, borrowed photographs of some of thetexts, and hurried back to his hotel to decipher them. Tracing out the first line, Quispel wasstartled, then incredulous, to read: \"These are the secret words which the living Jesus spoke, andwhich the twin, Judas Thomas, wrote down.\" Quispel knew that his colleague H.C. Puech, usingnotes from another French scholar, Jean Doresse, had identified the opening lines with fragmentsof a Greek Gospel of Thomas discovered in the 1890's. But the discovery of the whole text raisednew questions: Did Jesus have a twin brother, as this text implies? Could the text be an authenticrecord of Jesus' sayings? According to its title, it contained the Gospel According to Thomas; yet,unlike the gospels of the New Testament, this text identified itself as a secret gospel. Quispel alsodiscovered that it contained many sayings known from the New Testament; but these sayings,placed in unfamiliar contexts, suggested other dimensions of meaning. Other passages, Quispelfound, differed entirely from any known Christian tradition: the \"living Jesus,\" for example,speaks in sayings as cryptic and compelling as Zen koans:Jesus said, \"If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do notbring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.\"What Quispel held in his hand, the Gospel of Thomas, was only one of the fifty-two textsdiscovered at Nag Hammadi (the usual English transliteration of the town's name). Bound into thesame volume with it is the Gospel of Philip, which attributes to Jesus acts and sayings quitedifferent from those in the New Testament:. . . the companion of the [Savior is] Mary Magdalene. [But Christ loved] her more than [all] thedisciples, and used to kiss her [often] on her [mouth]. The rest of [the disciples were offended] . . .They said to him, \"Why do you love her more than all of us?\" The Savior answered and said tothem, \"Why do I not love you as (I love) her?\"Other sayings in this collection criticize common Christian beliefs, such as the virgin birth or thebodily resurrection, as naïve misunderstandings. Bound together with these gospels is theApocryphon (literally, \"secret book\") of John, which opens with an offer to reveal \"the mysteries[and the] things hidden in silence\" which Jesus taught to his disciple John.Muhammad 'Alí later admitted that some of the texts were lost--burned up or thrown away. Butwhat remains is astonishing: some fifty-two texts from the early centuries of the Christian era--including a collection of early Christian gospels, previously unknown. Besides the Gospel ofThomas and the Gospel of Philip, the find included the Gospel of Truth and the Gospel to theEgyptians, which identifies itself as \"the [sacred book] of the Great Invisible [Spirit].\" Anothergroup of texts consists of writings attributed to Jesus' followers, such as the Secret Book of James,the Apocalypse of Paul, the Letter of Peter to Philip, and the Apocalypse of Peter.What Muhammad 'Alí discovered at Nag Hammadi, it soon became clear, were Coptictranslations, made about 1,500 years ago, of still more ancient manuscripts. The originalsthemselves had been written in Greek, the language of the New Testament: as Doresse, Puech, andQuispel had recognized, part of one of them had been discovered by archeologists about fifty-2-"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"years earlier, when they found a few fragments of the original Greek version of the Gospel ofThomas.About the dating of the manuscripts themselves there is little debate. Examination of the datablepapyrus used to thicken the leather bindings, and of the Coptic script, place them c. A.D. 350-400.But scholars sharply disagree about the dating of the original texts. Some of them can hardly belater than c. A.D. 120-150, since Irenaeus, the orthodox Bishop of Lyons, writing C. 180, declaresthat heretics \"boast that they possess more gospels than there really are,'' and complains that in histime such writings already have won wide circulation--from Gaul through Rome, Greece, andAsia Minor.Quispel and his collaborators, who first published the Gospel of Thomas, suggested the date of c.A.D. 140 for the original. Some reasoned that since these gospels were heretical, they must havebeen written later than the gospels of the New Testament, which are dated c. 60-l l0. But recentlyProfessor Helmut Koester of Harvard University has suggested that the collection of sayings in theGospel of Thomas, although compiled c. 140, may include some traditions even older than thegospels of the New Testament, \"possibly as early as the second half of the first century\" (50-100)--as early as, or earlier, than Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John.Scholars investigating the Nag Hammadi find discovered that some of the texts tell the origin ofthe human race in terms very different from the usual reading of Genesis: the Testimony of Truth,for example, tells the story of the Garden of Eden from the viewpoint of the serpent! Here theserpent, long known to appear in Gnostic literature as the principle of divine wisdom, convincesAdam and Eve to partake of knowledge while \"the Lord\" threatens them with death, tryingjealously to prevent them from attaining knowledge, and expelling them from Paradise when theyachieve it. Another text, mysteriously entitled The Thunder, Perfect Mind, offers an extraordinarypoem spoken in the voice of a feminine divine power:For I am the first and the last. I am the honored one and the scorned one. I am the whore and the holy one. I am the wife and the virgin.... I am the barren one, and many are her sons.... I am the silence that is incomprehensible....I am the utterance of my name. These diverse texts range, then, from secret gospels, poems, and quasi-philosophic descriptions ofthe origin of the universe, to myths, magic, and instructions for mystical practice.Why were these texts buried-and why have they remained virtually unknown for nearly 2,000years? Their suppression as banned documents, and their burial on the cliff at Nag Hammadi, itturns out, were both part of a struggle critical for the formation of early Christianity. The NagHammadi texts, and others like them, which circulated at the beginning of the Christian era, weredenounced as heresy by orthodox Christians in the middle of the second century. We have longknown that many early followers of Christ were condemned by other Christians as heretics, butnearly all we knew about them came from what their opponents wrote attacking them. BishopIrenaeus, who supervised the church in Lyons, c. 180, wrote five volumes, entitled TheDestruction and Overthrow of Falsely So-called Knowledge, which begin with his promise to setforth the views of those who are now teaching heresy . . . to show how absurd and inconsistentwith the truth are their statements . . . I do this so that . . . you may urge all those with whom youare connected to avoid such an abyss of madness and of blasphemy against Christ.He denounces as especially \"full of blasphemy\" a famous gospel called the Gospel of Truth. IsIrenaeus referring to the same Gospel of Truth discovered at Nag Hammadi' Quispel and hiscollaborators, who first published the Gospel of Truth, argued that he is; one of their criticsmaintains that the opening line (which begins \"The gospel of truth\") is not a title. But Irenaeusdoes use the same source as at least one of the texts discovered at Nag Hammadi--theApocryphon (Secret Book) of John--as ammunition for his own attack on such \"heresy.\" Fiftyyears later Hippolytus, a teacher in Rome, wrote another massive Refutation of All Heresies to\"expose and refute the wicked blasphemy of the heretics.\"-3-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This campaign against heresy involved an involuntary admission of its persuasive power; yet thebishops prevailed. By the time of the Emperor Constantine's conversion, when Christianitybecame an officially approved religion in the fourth century, Christian bishops, previouslyvictimized by the police, now commanded them. Possession of books denounced as heretical wasmade a criminal offense. Copies of such books were burned and destroyed. But in Upper Egypt,someone; possibly a monk from a nearby monastery of St. Pachomius, took the banned books andhid them from destruction--in the jar where they remained buried for almost 1,600 years.But those who wrote and circulated these texts did not regard themselves as \"heretics. Most of thewritings use Christian terminology, unmistakable related to a Jewish heritage. Many claim to offertraditions about Jesus that are secret, hidden from \"the many\" who constitute what, in the secondcentury, came to be called the \"catholic church.\" These Christians are now called gnostics, from theGreek word gnosis, usually translated as \"knowledge.\" For as those who claim to know nothingabout ultimate reality are called agnostic (literally, \"not knowing\"), the person who does claim toknow such things is called gnostic (\"knowing\"). But gnosis is not primarily rational knowledge.The Greek language distinguishes between scientific or reflective knowledge (\"He knowsmathematics\") and knowing through observation or experience (\"He knows me\"), which is gnosis.As the gnostics use the term, we could translate it as \"insight,\" for gnosis involves an intuitiveprocess of knowing oneself. And to know oneself, they claimed, is to know human nature andhuman destiny. According to the gnostic teacher Theodotus, writing in Asia Minor (c. 140-160),the gnostic is one has come to understand who we were, and what we have become; where wewere... whither we are hastening; from what we are being released; what birth is, and what isrebirth.Yet to know oneself, at the deepest level, is simultaneously to know God; this is the secret ofgnosis. Another gnostic teacher, Monoimus, says:Abandon the search for God and the creation and other matters of a similar sort. Look for him bytaking yourself as the starting point. Learn who it is within you who makes everything his ownand says, \"My God, my mind, my thought, my soul, my body.\" Learn the sources of sorrow:, joy,love, hate . . . If you carefully investigate these matters you will find him in yourself.What Muhammad 'All discovered at Nag Hammadi is, apparently, a library of writings, almost allof them gnostic. Although they claim to offer secret teaching, many of these texts refer to theScriptures of the Old Testament, and others to the letters of Paul and the New Testament gospels.Many of them include the same dramatic personae as the New Testament--Jesus and his disciples.Yet the differences are striking.Orthodox Jews and Christians insist that a chasm separates humanity from Its creator: God iswholly other. But some of the gnostics who wrote these gospels contradict this: self-knowledge isknowledge of God; the self and the divine are identical.Second, the \"living Jesus\" of these texts speaks of illusion and enlightenment, not of sin andrepentance, like the Jesus of the New Testament. Instead of coming to save us from sin, he comesas a guide who opens access to spiritual understanding. But when the disciple attainsenlightenment, Jesus no longer serves as his spiritual master: the two have become equal--evenidentical.Third, orthodox Christians believe that Jesus is Lord and Son of God in a unique way: he remainsforever distinct from the rest of humanity whom he came to save. Yet the gnostic Gospel ofThomas relates that as soon as Thomas recognizes him, Jesus says to Thomas that they have bothreceived their being from the same source:Jesus said, \"I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become drunk from thebubbling stream which I have measured out.... He who will drink from my mouth will become as Iam: I myself shall become he, and the things that are hidden will be revealed to him.\"Does not such teaching--the identity of the divine and human. the concern with illusion andenlightenment, the founder who is presented not as Lord, but as spiritual guide sound moreEastern than Western? Some scholars have suggested that if the names were changed, the \"living-4-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Buddha\" appropriately could say what the Gospel of Thomas attributes to the living Jesus. CouldHindu or Buddhist tradition have influenced gnosticism?The British scholar of Buddhism, Edward Conze, suggests that it had. He points out that\"Buddhists were in contact with the Thomas Christians (that is, Christians who knew and usedsuch writings as the Gospel of Thomas) in South India.\" Trade routes between the Greco-Romanworld and the Far East were opening up at the time when gnosticism flourished (A.D. 80-200); forgenerations, Buddhist missionaries had been proselytizing in Alexandria. We note, too, thatHippolytus, who was a Greek speaking Christian in Rome (c. 225), knows of the IndianBrahmins--and includes their tradition among the sources of heresy:There is . . . among the Indians a heresy of those who philosophize among the Brahmins, who livea self-sufficient life, abstaining from (eating) living creatures and all cooked food . . . They say thatGod is light, not like the light one sees, nor like the sun nor fire, but to them God is discourse, notthat which finds expression in articulate sounds, but that of knowledge (gnosis) through whichthe secret mysteries of nature are perceived by the wise.Could the title of the Gospel of Thomas--named for the disciple who, tradition tells us, went toIndia--suggest the influence of Indian tradition?These hints indicate the possibility, yet our evidence is not conclusive. Since parallel traditionsmay emerge in different cultures at different times, such ideas could have developed in bothplaces independently. What we call Eastern and Western religions, and tend to regard as separatestreams, were not clearly differentiated 2,000 years ago. Research on the Nag Hammadi texts isonly beginning: we look forward to the work of scholars who can study these traditionscomparatively to discover whether they can, in fact, be traced to Indian sources.Even so, ideas that we associate with Eastern religions emerged in the first century through thegnostic movement in the West, but they were suppressed and condemned by polemicists likeIrenaeus. Yet those who called gnosticism heresy were adopting--consciously or not--theviewpoint of that group of Christians who called themselves orthodox Christians. A heretic maybe anyone whose outlook someone else dislikes or denounces. According to tradition, a heretic isone who deviates from the true faith. But what defines that \"true faith\"? Who calls it that, and forwhat reasons?We find this problem familiar in our own experience. The term \"Christianity,\" especially since theReformation, has covered an astonishing range of groups. Those claiming to represent \"trueChristianity\" in the twentieth century can range from a Catholic cardinal in the Vatican to anAfrican Methodist Episcopal preacher initiating revival in Detroit, a Mormon missionary inThailand, or the member of a village church on the coast of Greece. Yet Catholics, Protestants, andOrthodox agree that such diversity is a recent--and deplorable--development. According toChristian legend, the early church was different. Christians of every persuasion look back to theprimitive church to find a simpler, purer form of Christian faith. In the apostles' time, all membersof the Christian community shared their money and property; all believed the same teaching, andworshipped together; all revered the authority of the apostles. It was only after that golden agethat conflict, then heresy emerged: so says the author of the Acts of the Apostles, who identifieshimself as the first historian of Christianity.But the discoveries at Nag Hammadi have upset this picture. If we admit that some of these fifty-two texts represents early forms of Christian teaching, we may have to recognize that earlyChristianity is far more diverse than nearly anyone expected before the Nag Hammadidiscoveries.Contemporary Christianity, diverse and complex as we find it, actually may show moreunanimity than the Christian churches of the first and second centuries. For nearly all Christianssince that time, Catholics, Protestants, or Orthodox, have shared three basic premises. First, theyaccept the canon of the New Testament; second, they confess the apostolic creed; and third, theyaffirm specific forms of church institution. But every one of these-the canon of Scripture, the creed,and the institutional structure--emerged in its present form only toward the end of the secondcentury. Before that time, as Irenaeus and others attest, numerous gospels circulated among-5-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"various Christian groups, ranging from those of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, andJohn, to such writings as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, and the Gospel of Truth,as well as many other secret teachings, myths, and poems attributed to Jesus or his disciples. Someof these, apparently, were discovered at Nag Hammadi; many others are lost to us. Those whoidentified themselves as Christians entertained many--and radically differing-religious beliefs andpractices. And the communities scattered throughout the known world organized themselves inways that differed widely from one group to another.Yet by A. D. 200, the situation had changed. Christianity had become an institution headed by athree-rank hierarchy of bishops, priests, and deacons, who understood themselves to be theguardians of the only \"true faith.\" The majority of churches, among which the church of Rometook a leading role, rejected all other viewpoints as heresy. Deploring the diversity of the earliermovement, Bishop Irenaeus and his followers insisted that there could be only one church, andoutside of that church, he declared, \"there is no salvation.\" Members of this church alone areorthodox (literally, \"straight-thinking\") Christians. And, he claimed, this church must be catholic--that is, universal. Whoever challenged that consensus, arguing instead for other forms of Christianteaching, was declared to be a heretic, and expelled. When the orthodox gained military support,sometime after the Emperor Constantine became Christian in the fourth century, the penalty forheresy escalated.The Nag Hammadi discovery of manuscriptsIn December 1945, two peasants, Muhammed and Khalifah 'Ali of the al-Samman clan weredigging for fertiliser at the base of the Jabal al-Tarif cliff, using the saddle-bags of their camels tocarry the earth back. The cliff is about 11km north-east of Nag Hammadi. They tethered theircamels to a boulder, and came upon a buried jar as they were digging around the base of theboulder. Muhammed 'Ali told J.M.Robinson that at first he was afraid to break the jar -- the lidmay have been sealed with bitumen, as a blackish substance is present on the lid -- for fear a jinnmight be inside, but the thought that gold might be contained instead, he broke it with hismattock. Out flew particles of papyrus. The jar was of red slip ware, with four small handles nearthe opening. It was large, approximately 60cm or more in height, with an opening of some 15-20cm widening to 30cm in the side. The jar had been closed by fitting a bowl into its mouth. Thebowl survives, and is Coptic red slip ware of the 4-5th century, with a rim decorated with fourfields of stripes. The diameter at the outer edge is 23.3-24.0 cm, with inside diameter of 18.2-18.7cm.The books were divided among the 7 camel-drivers present. According to 'Ali there were 13 (our'codex XIII' was not included in this number, as it was inside codex VI). Thus a codex was lostmore or less at the site. Seven lots were drawn up. Covers were removed and each consisted of acomplete codex plus part of another. The other drivers, ignorant of the value and afraid of sorceryand Muhammed 'Ali, disclaimed any share, whereon he piled them all back together.'Ali wrapped his books in his tunic and took them home, to his hovel in the hamlet of al-Qasr,built on the site of ancient Chenoboskion. The books, loose covers and loose pages were dumpedin the straw, next to the oven. A blood-feud was in progress, for which reason Muhammed 'Aliwas very careful not to venture back later to the area. Muhammed deposited the books with alocal coptic priest, Basiliyus 'Abd al-Masih, as the police were searching his house almost nightlyfor weapons. The priest's wife had a brother, Raghib Andrawus, who went from village to villageteaching English and history in the local coptic church schools. He came to visit, and, on seeingone of the books, recognised it might be valuable and took it to Cairo. There he showed it to aCoptic physician interested in the Coptic language, George Sobhi, who called in the authoritiesfrom the Department of Antiquities. They seized the book, agreeing to pay Raghib £E 300. Afterendless haggling, he got £E 250, on condition he donated the remaining £E 50 to the CopticMuseum. The book was deposited in the museum, according to the register, on 4th October 1946.Thinking the books were worthless, or maybe even unlucky to have, 'Ali's widowed mother 'UmmAhmad had burned part of those lying in the straw in the oven (probably the covers and most of-6-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the pages of codex XII, of which only a few leaves remain, but also the cover of X, and looseleaves: 1 in codex II, 9 in III, 1 in VI, 3 in VIII and 2 in IX, and large and small fragments fromotherwise intact sequences of fragments), as she conceded to Robinson. Illiterate Muslimneighbours bartered or purchased them for next to nothing. Nashid Bisadah had one andentrusted it to a gold merchant of Nag Hammadi to sell in Cairo, dividing the profit betweenthem. A grain merchant supposedly acquired another and sold it for such a price that he ws ableto set up his shop in Cairo. Bahij 'Ali, a one-eyed outlaw of al-Qasr, got a number of the books. Escorted by a well-known antiquities dealer of the region, Dhaki Basta, he went to Cairo. Theyfirst offered the books to Mansoor's shop at Shepheard's hotel, and then to the shop of Phokion J.Tano, a Cypriot dealer, who bought the lot and then went to Nag Hammadi to get whatever wasleft. Once the news of the value of the books reached al-Qasr, the 'Ali brothers tried to lay handson the remainder.Most of Codex I was exported from Egypt by a Belgian antiques dealer, Albert Eid. He offered itfor sale in New York and Ann Arbor in 1949, and then his widow sold it on 10th May 1952 to theJung Institute of Zurich. It was returned to Cairo bit by bit after publication. Meanwhile Tano'scollection was seized by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities to prevent it being exported;when Nasser came to power, it was 'nationalised', a paltry £E 4,000 being paid as compensation. Today all the Nag Hammadi codices are in the Coptic Museum in Cairo.Publication was obstructed by the desire of various scholars to publish works first, with a full (andso lengthy to prepare) commentary. US scholar James Robinson became interested in the 1960's,and using contacts at UNESCO was able eventually to bypass this exhibition of obscurantism. Thefull collection was published in facsimile by Brill between 1972-1984 as the Facsimile edition of theNag Hammadi Codices. There is a 17-volume English edition, entitled The Coptic Gnostic Library, andfull English translations in the Nag Hammadi Library in English. Robinson also visited NagHammadi in the 1960's and 1970's, and tracked down those who found them and wormed outthem the story of the find.All the codices are fourth century papyrus. The find consists of 12 codices, plus 8 leaves from a13th, and contains 52 texts. Duplications mean the number of unique works is 45. The BerlinPapyrus 8502 is grouped with them, although found separately, because of its related contents. The texts were originally written in Greek, and later translated into Coptic, not always very well(e.g. the passage of Plato). The passage of Plato in fact has been reworked also.The largest leaves -- in codex VII -- are 17.5cm tall.

Gnosis derives fromGreek, and connotes \"knowledge\" or the \"act of knowing\". (On first hearing, it is sometimesconfused with another more common term of the same root but opposite sense: agnostic, literally\"not knowing\", a knower of nothing.) The Greek language differentiates between rational,propositional knowledge, and the distinct form of knowing obtained not by reason, but bypersonal experience or perception. It is this latter knowledge, gained from experience, from aninterior spark of comprehension, that constitutes gnosis. 1In the first century of the Christian era this term, Gnostic, began to be used to denote a prominent,even if somewhat heterodox, segment of the diverse new Christian community. Among theseearly followers of Christ, it appears that an elite group delineated themselves from the greaterhousehold of the Church by claiming not simply a belief in Christ and his message, but a \"specialwitness\" or revelatory experience of the divine. It was this experience, this gnosis, which--so theseGnostics claimed--set the true follower of Christ apart from his fellows. Stephan Hoeller explainsthat these Gnostic Christians held a \"conviction that direct, personal and absolute knowledge ofthe authentic truths of existence is accessible to human beings, and, moreover, that the attainmentof such knowledge must always constitute the supreme achievement of human life.\" 2What the \"authentic truths of existence\" affirmed by the Gnostics were will be briefly reviewedbelow. But a historical overview of the early Church might first be useful. In the initial decades ofthe Christian church--the period when we find first mention of \"Gnostic\" Christians--noorthodoxy, or single acceptable format of Christian thought, had yet been defined. During thisfirst century of Christianity modern scholarship suggests Gnosticism was one of many currentssweeping the deep waters of the new religion. The ultimate course Christianity, and Westernculture with it, would take was undecided at that early moment; Gnosticism was one of forcesforming that destiny. That Gnosticism was, at least briefly, in the mainstream of Christianity is witnessed by the factthat one of the most prominent and influential early Gnostic teachers, Valentinus, may have beenin consideration during the mid-second century for election as the Bishop of Rome. 3 Valentinusserves well as a model of the Gnostic teacher. Born in Alexandria around A.D. 100, in his earlyyears Valentinus had distinguished himself as an extraordinary teacher and leader in the highlyeducated and diverse Alexandrian Christian community. In the middle of his life, around A.D.140, he migrated from Alexandria to the Church's evolving capital, Rome, where he played anactive role in the public life of the Church. A prime characteristic of the Gnostics was theirpropensity for claiming to be keepers of secret teachings, gospels, traditions, rituals, andsuccessions within the Church -- sacred matters for which many Christians were (in Gnosticopinion) simply either not prepared or not properly inclined. Valentinus, true to this Gnosticpenchant, professed a special apostolic sanction. He maintained he had been personally initiatedby one Theudas, a disciple and initiate of the Apostle Paul, and that he possessed knowledge ofteachings and perhaps rituals which were being forgotten by the developing opposition thatbecame Christian orthodoxy.4 Though an influential member of the Roman church in the mid-1 1 Bentley Layton, The Gnostic Scriptures (New York, 1987), p.9.

While the historical and theological details are far too complex for proper explication here, the tideof history can be said to have turned against Gnosticism in the middle of the second century. NoGnostic after Valentinus would ever come so near prominence in the greater Church. Gnosticism'ssecret knowledge, its continuing revelations and production of new scripture, its ascetheticismand paradoxically contrasting libertine postures, were met with increasing suspicion. By A.D. 180,Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon, was publishing his attacks on Gnosticism as heresy, a work to becontinued with increasing vehemence by the orthodox church Fathers throughout the nextcentury. The orthodox catholic church was deeply and profoundly influenced by the struggle againstGnosticism in the second and third centuries. Formulations of many central traditions in orthodoxtheology came as reflections and shadows of this confrontation with the Gnosis. 5 But by the endof the fourth century the struggle with the classical Gnosticism represented in the Nag Hammaditexts was essentially over; the evolving orthodox ecclesia had added the force of politicalcorrectness to dogmatic denunciation, and with this sword so-called \"heresy\" was painfully cutfrom the Christian body. Gnosticism, which had perhaps already passed its prime, was eradicated,its remaining teachers murdered or driven into exile, and its sacred books destroyed. All thatremained for scholars seeking to understand Gnosticism in later centuries were the denunciationsand fragments preserved in the patristic heresiologies -- or so it seem, until until a day in 1945.... Discovery of the Nag Hammadi LibraryIt was on a December day in the year of 1945, near the town of Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt,that the course of Gnostic studies was radically renewed and forever changed. An Arab peasant,digging around a boulder in search of fertilizer for his fields, happened upon an old, rather largered earthenware jar. Hoping to have found buried treasure, and with due hesitation andapprehension about the jinn, the genie or spirit who might attend such an hoard, he smashed thejar open with his pick. Inside he discovered no treasure and no genie, but books: more than adozen old papyrus books, bound in golden brown leather. 6 Little did he realize that he had foundan extraordinary collection of ancient texts, manuscripts hidden up a millennium and a half before(probably deposited in the jar around the year 390 by monks from the nearby monastery of St.Pachomius) to escape destruction under order of the emerging orthodox Church in its violentexpunging of all heterodoxy and heresy. How the Nag Hammadi manuscripts eventually passed into scholarly hands is a fascinating evenif too lengthy story to here relate. But today, now over fifty years since being unearthed and morethan two decades after final translation and publication in English as The Nag Hammadi Library7,their importance has become astoundingly clear: These thirteen beautiful papyrus codicescontaining fifty-two sacred texts are the long lost \"Gnostic Gospels\", a last extant testament ofwhat orthodox Christianity perceived to be its most dangerous and insidious challenge, the fearedopponent that the Patristic heresiologists had reviled under many different names, but mostcommonly as Gnosticism. The discovery of these documents has radically revised ourunderstanding of Gnosticism and the early Christian church.Overview of Gnostic TeachingsWith that abbreviated historical interlude completed, we might again ask, \"What was it that these\"knowers\" knew?\" What made them such dangerous heretics? The complexities of Gnosticism arelegion, making any generalizations wisely suspect. While several systems for defining andcategorizing Gnosticism have been proposed over the years, none has yet gained any general5 Giovanni Filoramo, A History of Gnosticism (Oxford, 1990), p. 5.6 We should here note, given recent extensive discussions about the Dead Sea Scrolls, that the Nag Hammadi find is entirely separate and different from that muchpublicized discovery of ancient Jewish texts. Discovered beginning in 1947, two years after the Nag Hammadi texts were found, these records now known as theDead Sea Scrolls were apparently the possessions of Essene communities residing near Qumran in Palestine at a time around the beginning of the Christian era.7 J.

Hereafter cited as NHL.-9-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"acceptance. 8 So with advance warning that this is most certainly not a definitive summary ofGnosticism and its many permutations, we will outline just four elements generally agreed to becharacteristic of Gnostic thought. The first essential characteristic of Gnosticism was introduced above: Gnosticism asserts that\"direct, personal and absolute knowledge of the authentic truths of existence is accessible tohuman beings,\" and that the attainment of such knowledge is the supreme achievement of humanlife. Gnosis, remember, is not a rational, propositional, logical understanding, but a knowingacquired by experience. The Gnostics were not much interested in dogma or coherent, rationaltheology--a fact which makes the study of Gnosticism particularly difficult for individuals with\"bookkeeper mentalities\". (Perhaps for this very same reason, consideration of the Gnostic visionis often a most gratifying undertaking for persons gifted with a poetic ear.) One simply cannotcipher up Gnosticism into syllogistic dogmatic affirmations. The Gnostics cherished the ongoingforce of divine revelation--Gnosis was the creative experience of revelation, a rushing progressionof understanding, and not a static creed. Carl Gustav Jung, the great Swiss psychologist and a life-long student of Gnosticism in its various historical permutations, affirms,we find in Gnosticism what was lacking in the centuries that followed: a belief in the efficacyof individual revelation and individual knowledge. This belief was rooted in the proud feelingof man's affinity with the gods...In his recent popular study, The American Religion, Harold Bloom suggests a second characteristicof Gnosticism that might help us conceptually circumscribe its mysterious heart. Gnosticism, saysBloom, \"is a knowing, by and of an uncreated self, or self-within-the self, and [this] knowledgeleads to freedom....\" 9 Primary among all the revelatory perceptions a Gnostic might reach was theprofound awakening that came with knowledge that something within him was uncreated. TheGnostics called this \"uncreated self\" the divine seed, the pearl, the spark of knowing:consciousness, intelligence, light. And this seed of intellect was the self-same substance of God, itwas man's authentic reality; it was the glory of humankind and the divine alike. If woman or mantruly came to gnosis of this spark, she understood that she was truly free: Not contingent, not aconception of sin, not a flawed crust of flesh, but the stuff of God, and the conduit of God'simmanent realization. There was always a paradoxical cognizance of duality in experiencing this\"self-within-a-self\". How could it not be paradoxical: By all rational perception, man clearly wasnot God, and yet in essential truth, was Godly. This conundrum was a Gnostic mystery, and itsknowing was their greatest treasure. The creator god, the one who claimed in evolving orthodox dogma to have made man, and to ownhim, the god who would have man contingent upon him, born ex nihilo by his will, was a lyingdemon and not God at all. Gnostics called him by many names -- many of them deprecatory --names like \"Saklas\", the blind one; \"Samael\", god of the blind; or \"the Demiurge\", the lesser power. Theodotus, a Gnostic teacher writing in Asia Minor between A.D. 140 and 160, explained that thesacred strength of gnosis reveals \"who we were, what we have become, where we have been castout of, where we are bound for, what we have been purified of, what generation and regenerationare.\" 10 \" Yet\", the eminent scholar of Gnosticism, Elaine Pagels, comments in exegesis, \"to knowoneself, at the deepest level, is simultaneously to know God: this is the secret of gnosis.... Self-knowledge is knowledge of God; the self and the divine are identical.\" 11The Gospel of Thomas, one of the Gnostic texts found preserved in the Nag Hammadi Library, givesthese words of the living Jesus: Jesus said, `I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become drunk from thebubbling stream which I have measured out... 128 An excellent summary of these appears in: Stephan Hoeller, \"What is a Gnostic?\" Gnosis: A Journal of Western Inner Traditions 23 (Spring, 1992), pp. 24-27. 9 Bloom, p. 49.10 Clemens Alexandrinus, Exerpta ex theodoto 78.2.11 Pagels, pp. xix-xx.12 Gospel of Thomas, 35.4-7, NHL.-10-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: I myself shall become he, and thethings that are hidden will be revealed to him.’ 13He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: What a remarkably heretical image! The Gospelof Thomas, from which we take that text, is an extraordinary scripture. Professor Helmut Koester ofHarvard University notes that though ultimately this Gospel was condemned and destroyed bythe evolving orthodox church, it may be as old or older than the four canonical gospels preserved,and even have served as a source document to them. 14 This brings us to the third prominentelement in our brief summary of Gnosticism: its reverence for texts and scriptures unaccepted bythe orthodox fold. The Gnostic experience was mythopoetic -- in story and allegory, and perhapsalso in ritual enactments, Gnosticism sought expression of subtle, visionary insights inexpressibleby rational proposition or dogmatic affirmation. For the Gnostics, revelation was the nature of Gnosis: and for all the visions vouchsafed them,they affirmed a certainty that God would yet reveal many great and wonderful things. Irritated bytheir profusion of \"inspired texts\" and myths--most particularly their penchant for amplifying thestory of Adam and Eve, and of the spiritual creation which they viewed as preceding the materialrealization of creation 15 - Ireneaus complains in his classic second century refutation ofGnosticism, that every one of them generates something new, day by day, according to his ability; for no one isdeemed perfect [or, mature], who does not develop...some mighty fiction. 16 The fourth characteristic that we might delineate to understand classical Gnosticism is the mostdifficult of the four to succinctly untangle, and also one of the most disturbing to subsequentorthodox theology. This is the image of God as a diad or duality. While affirming the ultimateunity and integrity of the Divine, Gnosticism noted in its experiential encounter with the numinous,dualistic, contrasting manifestations and qualities. Consider the Gnostic affirmation that man, insome essential reality, is also God. This is a statement tinged with duality: Man, though not God,is. Another idea, offered by the Manichaean gnostic Faustus, that both matter (hyle) and the divinespirit are uncreated and coeternal was violently attacked by Augustine in his essay ContraFaustum as heretical, dualistic thinking. 17In many of the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts God is imaged not just as a duality, or diad, but as aunity of masculine and feminine elements. Though their language is specifically Christian andunmistakably related to the Jewish tradition, Gnostic sources continually use sexual symbolism todescribe God. Prof. Pagels explains, One group of gnostic sources claims to have received a secret tradition from Jesus throughJames and through Mary Magdalene [who the Gnostics revered as consort to Jesus]. Membersof this group prayed to both the divine Father and Mother: `From Thee, Father, and through Thee, Mother, the two immortal names, Parents of thedivine being, and thou, dweller in heaven, humanity, of the mighty name...’ 18Several trends within Gnosticism saw in God a union of two disparate natures, a union well imagedwith sexual symbolism. Gnostics honored the feminine nature and, in reflection, Prof. ElainePagels has argued that Christian Gnostic women enjoyed a far greater degree of social andecclesiastical equality than their orthodox sisters. Jesus himself, taught some Gnostics, hadprefigured this mystic relationship: His most beloved disciple had been a woman, MaryMagdalene, his consort. The Gospel of Philip relates13 Gospel of Thomas, 50.28-30, NHL. 14 Helmut Koester, \"Introduction to The Gospel of Thomas\", in NHL, p. 124 f..15 Irenaeus, Adversus haereses, 1.17.116 ibid., 1.18.117 Augustine, Contra Faustum, XXI, 1.

But Christ loved her more than all thedisciples, and used to kiss her often on her mouth. The rest of the disciples were offended...They said to him, \"Why do you love her more than all of us? the Savior answered and said tothem, \"Why do I not love you as I love her?\" 19The most mysterious and sacred of all Gnostic rituals may have played upon this perception ofGod as \"duality seeking unity.\" The Gospel of Philip (which in its entirety might be read as acommentary on Gnostic ritual) relates that the Lord established five great sacraments or mysteries:\"a baptism and a chrism, and a eucharist, and a redemption, and a bridal chamber.\" 20 Whether thisultimate sacrament of the bridal chamber was a ritual enacted by a man and women, an allegoricalterm for a mystical experience, or a union of both, we do not know. Only hints are given inGnostic texts about what this sacrament might be: Christ came to rectify the separation... and join the two components; and to give life untothose who had died by separation and join them together. Now a woman joins with herhusband in the bridal [chamber], and those who have joined in the bridal [chamber] will notreseparate. 21 We are left with our poetic imaginations to consider what this might mean. Orthodox polemicistsfrequently accused Gnostics of unorthodox sexual behavior. But exactly how these ideas andimages played out in human affairs remains historically uncertain. Classical Christian Gnosticism vanished from the Western world during the fourth and fifthcenturies. But the Gnostic world view -- with its affirmation of individual revelation grantingcertain knowledge; comprehension of humankind's true uncreated nature and inherent affinity oreven identity with God; and its perception of duality, or even in an extreme statement, ofmasculine and feminine elements seeking union within the divine--was not so easily extinguished.Such perceptions continued in various forms to course through Western culture, though, perforce,often in very occult ways. Gnosticism was, and remains today, a living tradition, a traditioneternally reborn in the gnosis kardia of humankind. -- Lance S.

Therefore, I say to you, 'Become full, and leave no space within you empty, forhe who is coming can mock you.\" Then Peter replied, \"Lo, three times you have told us, 'Become full'; but we are full.\" The Savior answered and said, \"For this cause I have said to you, 'Become full,' that you may notbe in want. They who are in want, however, will not be saved. For it is good to be full, and bad tobe in want. Hence, just as it is good that you be in want and, conversely, bad that you be full, so hewho is full is in want, and he who is in want does not become full as he who is in want becomesfull, and he who has been filled, in turn attains due perfection.

For your sakes I have placed myselfunder the curse, that you may be saved.\" But Peter replied to these words and said, \"Sometimes you urge us on to the kingdom of heaven,and then again you turn us back, Lord; sometimes you persuade and draw us to faith and promiseus life, and then again you cast us forth from the kingdom of heaven.\" But the Lord answered and said to us, \"I have given you faith many times; moreover, I haverevealed myself to you, James, and you (all) have not known me. Now again, I see you rejoicingmany times; and when you are elated at the promise of life, are you yet sad, and do you grieve,when you are instructed in the kingdom? But you, through faith and knowledge, have receivedlife. Therefore, disdain the rejection when you hear it, but when you hear the promise, rejoice themore. Verily, I say unto you, he who will receive life and believe in the kingdom will never leaveit, not even if the Father wishes to banish him.\" \"These are the things that I shall tell you so far; now, however, I shall ascend to the place fromwhence I came. But you, when I was eager to go, have cast me out, and instead of accompanyingme, you have pursued me. But pay heed to the glory that awaits me, and, having opened yourheart, listen to the hymns that await me up in the heavens; for today I must take (my place at) theright hand of the Father. But I have said (my) last word to you, and I shall depart from you, for achariot of spirit has borne me aloft, and from this moment on, I shall strip myself, that I may clothemyself. But give heed; blessed are they who have proclaimed the Son before his descent, thatwhen I have come, I might ascend (again). Thrice blessed are they who were proclaimed by theSon before they came to be, that you might have a portion among them.\" Having said these words, he departed. But we bent (our) knee(s), I and Peter, and gave thanks,and sent our heart(s) upwards to heaven. We heard with our ears, and saw with our eyes, thenoise of wars, and a trumpet blare, and a great turmoil. And when we had passed beyond that place, we sent our mind(s) farther upwards, and saw withour eyes and heard with our ears hymns, and angelic benedictions, and angelic rejoicing. Andheavenly majesties were singing praise, and we, too, rejoiced. After this again, we wished to send our spirit upward to the Majesty, and after ascending, wewere not permitted to see or hear anything, for the other disciples called us and asked us, \"Whatdid you hear from the Master. And what has he said to you? And where did he go?\" But we answered them, \"He has ascended, and has given us a pledge, and promised life to us all,and revealed to us children (?) who are to come after us, after bidding us love them, as we wouldbe saved for their sakes.\"And when they heard (this), they indeed believed the revelation, but were displeased about thoseto be born. And so, not wishing to give them offense, I sent each one to another place. But I myselfwent up to Jerusalem, praying that I might obtain a portion among the beloved, who will be mademanifest. And I pray that the beginning may come from you, for thus I shall be capable of salvation, sincethey will be enlightened through me, by my faith - and through another (faith) that is better thanmine, for I would that mine be the lesser. Endeavor earnestly, then, to make yourself like them,and pray that you may obtain a portion with them. For because of what I have said, the Savior didnot make the revelation to us for their sakes. We do, indeed, proclaim a portion with those forwhom the proclamation was made - those whom the Lord has made his sons.- 18 -"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"T h e A p o c r y p h o n o f J a m e sCODEX ITranslated by Ron CameronFrom Ron Cameron, The Other Gospels (Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1982), as quoted in Willis Barnstone, The Other Bible (Harper & Row, San Francisco, 1984).James writes to you. Peace be with you from Peace, love from Love, grace from Grace, faith fromFaith, life from Holy Life! Since you asked me to send you a secret book which was revealed to me and Peter by the Lord, Icould neither refuse you nor speak directly to you, but I have written it in Hebrew letters and havesent it to you - and to you alone. But inasmuch as you are a minister of the salvation of the saints,endeavor earnestly and take care not to recount this book to many - this which the Savior did notdesire to recount to all of us, his twelve disciples. But blessed are those who will be saved throughfaith in this discourse. Now I sent you ten months ago another secret book with the Savior revealed to me. But that oneyou are to regard in this manner, as revealed to me, James. Now the twelve disciples were sitting all together at the same time, and, remembering what theSavior had said to each one of them, whether secretly or openly, they were setting it down inbooks. And I was writing what was in my book - lo, the Savior appeared, after he had departedfrom us while we gazed at him. And five hundred and fifty days after he arose from the dead, wesaid to him: \"Have you gone and departed from us?\" And Jesus said: \"No, but I shall go to the place from which I have come. If you desire to come withme, come.\" They all answered and said: \"If you bid us, we'll come.\" He said: \"Truly I say to you, no one ever will enter the Kingdom of Heaven if I bid him, but ratherbecause you yourselves are full. Let me have James and Peter, in order that I may fill them.\" Andwhen he called these two, he took them aside, and commanded the rest to busy themselves withthat with which they had been busy. The Savior said; \"You have received mercy.... (7 lines missing) Do you not desire, then, to be filled?And is your heart drunk? Do you not desire, then, to be sober? Therefore, be ashamed! And now,waking or sleeping, remember that you have seen the Son of Man, and with him you have spoken,and to him you have listened. Woe to those who have seen the Son of Man! Blessed are those whohave not seen the Man, and who have not consorted with him, and who have not spoken withhim, and who have not listened to anything from him. Yours is life! Know, therefore, that hehealed you when you were ill, in order that you might reign. Woe to those who have rested fromtheir illness, because they will relapse again into illness! Blessed are those who have not been ill,and have known rest before they became ill. Yours is the Kingdom of God! Therefore I say to you,become full and leave no place within you empty, since the Coming One is able to mock you.\" Then Peter answered: \"Lord, three times you have said to us 'Become full', but we are full.\" The Lord answered and said: \"Therefore I say unto you, become full, in order that you may not bediminished. Those who are diminished, however, will not be saved. For fullness is good anddiminution is bad. Therefore, just as it is good for you to be diminished and, on the other hand,bad for you to be filled, so also the one who is full is diminished; and the one who is diminished isnot filled as the one who is diminished is filled, and the one who is full, for his part, brings hissufficiency to completion. Therefore, it is fitting to be diminished while you can still be filled, andto be filled while it is still possible to be diminished, in order that you can fill yourselves the more.Therefore become full of the spirit but be diminished of reason. For reason is of the soul; and it issoul.\" - 19 -"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"And I answered, and said to him: \"Lord, we can obey you if you wish. For we have forsaken ourforefathers and our mothers and our villages and have followed you. Grant us, therefore, not to betempted by the wicked Devil.\" The Lord answered and said: \"What is your merit when you do the will of the Father if it is notgiven to you by him as a gift, while you are tempted by Satan? But if you are oppressed by Satanand are persecuted and you do the Father's will, I say that he will love you and will make youequal with me and will consider that you have become beloved through his providence accordingto your free choice. Will you not cease, then, being lovers of the flesh and being afraid ofsufferings? Or do you not know that you have not yet been mistreated and have not yet beenaccused unjustly, nor have you yet been shut up in prison, nor have you yet been condemnedlawlessly, nor have you yet been crucified without reason, nor have you yet been buriedshamefully, as was I myself, by the evil one? Do you dare to spare the flesh, you for whom thespirit is an encircling wall? If you contemplate the world, how long it is before you and also howlong it is after you, you will find that your life is one single day and your sufferings, one singlehour. For the good will not enter the world. Scorn death, therefore, and take concern for life.Remember my cross and my death and you will live.\" And I answered and said to him: \"Lord, do not mention to us the cross and the death, for they arefar from you.\" The Lord answered and said: \"Truly I say to you, none will be saved unless they believe in mycross. But those who have believed in my cross, theirs is the Kingdom of God. Therefore, becomeseekers for death, just as the dead who seek for life, for that which they seek is revealed to them.And what is there to concern them? When you turn yourselves towards death, it will make knownto you election. In truth I say to you, none of those who are afraid of death will be saved. For theKingdom of God belongs to those who have put themselves to death. Become better than I; makeyourselves like the son of the Holy Spirit.\" Then I questioned him: \"Lord how may we prophesy to those who ask us to prophesy to them?For there are many who ask us and who look to us to hear an oracle from us.\" The Lord answered and said: \"Do you not know that the head of prophecy was cut off with John?\"And I said: \"Lord, it is not possible to remove the head of prophecy, is it?\" The Lord said to me: \"When you come to know what 'head' is, and that prophecy issues from thehead, then understand what is the meaning of 'Its head was removed'. I first spoke with you inparables, and you did not understand. Now, in turn, I speak with you openly, and you do notperceive. But it is you who were to me a parable in parables and what is apparent in what areopen. \"Be zealous to be saved without being urged. Rather, be ready on your own and, if possible, gobefore me. For thus the Father will love you. \"Become haters of hypocrisy and evil thought. For it is thought which gives birth to hypocrisy, buthypocrisy is far from the truth. \"Let not the Kingdom of Heaven wither away. For it is like a date palm shoot whose fruits poureddown around it. It put forth leaves and, when they budded, they caused the productivity of thedate palm to dry up. Thus it is also with the fruit which came from this single root; when the fruitwas picked, fruits were collected by many harvesters. It would indeed be good if it were possibleto produce these new plants now; for then you would find the Kingdom. \"Since I have been glorified in this manner before this time, why do you all restrain me when I ameager to go? You have constrained me to remain with you eighteen more days for the sake of theparables. It sufficed for some persons to pay attention to the teaching and understand 'TheShepherds' and 'The Seed' and 'The Building' and 'The Lamps of the Virgins' and 'The Wage of theWorkers' and 'The Double Drachma' and 'The Woman'. \"Become zealous about the Word. For the Word's first condition is faith; the second is love; thethird is works. Now from these comes life. For the Word is like a grain of wheat. When someonesowed it, he believed in it; and when it sprouted, he loved it, because he looked forward to many- 20 -"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"grains in the place of one; and when he worked it, he was saved, because he prepared it for food.Again he left some grains to sow. Thus it is also possible for you all to receive the Kingdom ofHeaven: unless you receive it through knowledge, you will not be able to find it. \"Therefore I say to you, be sober. Do not go astray. And many times I have said to you all together- and also to you alone, James, I have said - 'Be saved!' And I have commanded you to follow me,and I have taught you the response in the presence of the rulers. Observe that I have descended,and I have spoken, and I have troubled myself, and I have received my crown, when I saved you.For I have descended to dwell with you in order that you also may dwell with me. And when Ifound that your houses had no ceilings over them, I dwelt in houses which would be able toreceive me when I descended. \"Therefore, obey me, my brothers. Understand what the great light is. The Father does not needme. For a father does not need a son, but it is the son who needs the father. To him I am going, forthe Father of the Son is not in need of you. \"Pay attention to the Word. Understand Knowledge. Love Life. And no one will persecute you,nor will any one oppress you, other than you yourselves. \"O you wretched! O you unfortunates! O you dissemblers of the truth! O you falsifiers ofknowledge! O you sinners against the spirit! Do you even now dare to listen, when it behoovedyou to speak from the beginning? Do you even now dare to sleep, when it behooved you to beawake from the beginning, in order that the Kingdom of Heaven might receive you? In truth I sayto you, it is easier for a holy one to sink into defilement, and for a man of light to sink intodarkness, than for you to reign - or even not to reign! \"I have remembered your tears and your grief and your sorrow. They are far from us. Now, then,you who are outside the inheritance of the Father, weep where it behooves you and grieve andproclaim that which is good, since the Son is ascending appropriately. In truth I say to you, had itbeen to those who would listen to me that I was sent, and had it been with them that I was tospeak, I would have never descended upon the earth. And now, then, be ashamed on account ofthem. \"Behold, I shall depart from you. I am going and I do not desire to remain with you any longer -just as you yourselves have not desired. Now, then, follow me quickly. Therefore I say to you, foryour sake I have descended. You are the beloved; you are those who will become a cause of life formany. Beseech the Father. Implore God often, and he will give to you. Blessed is the one who hasseen you with him when he is proclaimed among the angels and glorified among the saints. Yoursis life! Rejoice and be glad as children of God. Keep his will in order that you may be saved. Takereproof from me and save yourselves. I intercede on your behalf with the Father, and he willforgive you much.\" And when we heard these things, we became elated, for we had been depressed on account ofwhat we had said earlier. Now when he saw our rejoicing, he said: \"Woe to you who are in wantof an advocate! Woe to you who are in need of grace! Blessed are those who have spoken freelyand have produced grace for themselves. Make yourselves like strangers; of what sort are they inthe estimation of your city? Why are you troubled when you oust yourselves of your own accordand depart from your city? Why do you abandon your dwelling place of your own accord,readying it for those who desire to dwell in it? O you exiles and fugitives! Woe to you, becauseyou will be caught! Or perhaps you imagine that the Father is a lover of humanity? Or that he ispersuaded by prayers? Or that he is gracious to one on behalf of another? Or that he bears withone who seeks? For he knows the desire and also that which the flesh needs. Because it is not theflesh which yearns for the soul. For without the soul the body does not sin, just as the soul is notsaved without the Spirit. But if the soul is saved when it is without evil, and if the spirit also issaved, then the body becomes sinless. For it is the spirit which animates the soul, but it is the bodywhich kills it - that is, it is the soul which kills itself. Truly I say to you, the Father will not forgivethe sin of the soul at all, nor the guilt of the flesh. For none of those who have worn the flesh willbe saved. For do you imagine that many have found the Kingdom of Heaven? Blessed is the onewho has seen himself as a fourth one in Heaven.\" - 21 -"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"When we heard these things, we became distressed.

You also: be zealous to reap for yourselvesan ear of life, in order that you may be filled with the Kingdom. \"As long as I am with you, give heed to me and obey me. But when I am to depart from you,remember me. And remember me because I was with you without your knowing me. Blessed arethose who have known me. Woe to those who have heard and have not believed! Blessed arethose who have not seen but have had faith! \"And once again I persuade you. For I am revealed to you building a house which is very valuableto you, since you take shelter under it; in the same way it will be able to support the house of yourneighbors when theirs is in danger of falling. In truth I say to you, woe to those on behalf of whomI was sent down to this place! Blessed are those who are to ascend to the Father. Again I reproveyou. You who are, make yourselves like those who are not, in order that you may come to be withthose who are not. \"Let not the Kingdom of Heaven become desolate among you. Do not become arrogant on accountof the light which illumines. Rather, become to yourselves in this manner, as I am to you.

Sometimes you persuade us and impel us to faith andpromise us life, and other times you expel us from the Kingdom of Heaven.\" And the Lord answered and said to us: \"I have given you faith many times. Moreover, I haverevealed myself to you, James, and you have not known me. Again, now I see you rejoicing manytimes. And when you are elated over the promise of life, are you nevertheless glum? And are youdistressed when you are taught about the Kingdom? But you through faith and knowledge havereceived life. Therefore, scorn rejection when you hear it, but, when you hear the promise, be themore glad.

Thrice-blessed are thos who wereproclaimed by the Son before they came into being, in order that you may have a portion withthem.\" When he said these things, he went away. And we knelt down, I and Peter, and gave thanks, andsent our hearts up to heaven. We heard with our ears and saw with our eyes the sound of warsand a trumpet call and a great commotion. And when we passed beyond that place, we sent out minds up further. And we saw with our eyesand heard with our ears hymns and angelic praises and angelic jubilation. And heavenly majestieswere hymning, and we ourselves were jubilant. After this, we also desired to send our spirits above to the Majesty. And when we ascended, wewere permitted neither to see nor to hear anything. For the rest of the disciples called to us andquestioned us: \"What is it that you have heard from the Master?\" And, \"What has he said to you?\"And, \"Where has he gone?\" And we answered them: \"He has ascended.\" And, \"He has given us a pledge and has promised usall life and disclosed to us children who are to come after us, since he has bid us to love them,inasmuch as we will be saved for their sake.\" - 22 -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"And when they heard, they believed the revelation, but were angry about those who would beborn.

GrantFrom Robert M. Grant, Gnosticism (Harper & Brothers, New York, 1961), as quoted in Willis Barnstone, The Other Bible (Harper & Row, San Francisco, 1984).The gospel of truth is joy to those who have received from the Father of truth the gift of knowinghim by the power of the Logos, who has come from the Pleroma and who is in the thought and themind of the Father; he it is who is called \"the Savior,\" since that is the name of the work which hemust do for the redemption of those who have not known the Father. For the name of the gospel isthe manifestation of hope, since that is the discovery of those who seek him, because the Allsought him from whom it had come forth. You see, the All had been inside of him, that illimitable,inconceivable one, who is better than every thought. This ignorance of the Father brought about terror and fear. And terror became dense like a fog,that no one was able to see. Because of this, error became strong. But it worked on its hylicsubstance vainly, because it did not know the truth. It was in a fashioned form while it waspreparing, in power and in beauty, the equivalent of truth. This then, was not a humiliation forhim, that illimitable, inconceivable one. For they were as nothing, this terror and this forgetfulnessand this figure of falsehood, whereas this established truth is unchanging, unperturbed andcompletely beautiful. For this reason, do not take error too seriously. Thus, since it had no root, it was in a fog as regardsthe Father, engaged in preparing works and forgetfulnesses and fears in order, by these means, tobeguile those of the middle and to make them captive. The forgetfulness of error was not revealed.It did not become light beside the Father. Forgetfulness did not exist with the Father, although itexisted because of him. What exists in him is knowledge, which was revealed so that forgetfulnessmight be destroyed and that they might know the Father, Since forgetfulness existed because theydid not know the Father, if they then come to know the Father, from that moment on forgetfulnesswill cease to exist. That is the gospel of him whom they seek, which he has revealed to the perfect through themercies of the Father as the hidden mystery, Jesus the Christ. Through him he enlightened thosewho were in darkness because of forgetfulness. He enlightened them and gave them a path. Andthat path is the truth which he taught them. For this reason error was angry with him, so itpersecuted him. It was distressed by him, so it made him powerless. He was nailed to a cross. Hebecame a fruit of the knowledge of the Father. He did not, however, destroy them because they ateof it. He rather caused those who ate of it to be joyful because of this discovery. And as for him, them he found in himself, and him they found in themselves, that illimitable,inconceivable one, that perfect Father who made the all, in whom the All is, and whom the Alllacks, since he retained in himself their perfection, which he had not given to the all. The Fatherwas not jealous. What jealousy, indeed, is there between him and his members? For, even if theAeon had received their perfection, they would not have been able to approach the perfection ofthe Father, because he retained their perfection in himself, giving it to them as a way to return tohim and as a knowledge unique in perfection. He is the one who set the All in order and in whomthe All existed and whom the All lacked. As one of whom some have no knowledge, he desiresthat they know him and that they love him. For what is it that the All lacked, if not the knowledgeof the Father? He became a guide, quiet and in leisure. In the middle of a school he came and spoke the Word, asa teacher. Those who were wise in their own estimation came to put him to the test. But hediscredited them as empty-headed people. They hated him because they really were not wise men.After all these came also the little children, those who possess the knowledge of the Father. Whenthey became strong they were taught the aspects of the Father's face. They came to know and they- 24 -"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"were known. They were glorified and they gave glory. In their heart, the living book of the Livingwas manifest, the book which was written in the thought and in the mind of the Father and, frombefore the foundation of the All, is in that incomprehensible part of him. This is the book which no one found possible to take, since it was reserved for him who will take itand be slain. No one was able to be manifest from those who believed in salvation as long as thatbook had not appeared. For this reason, the compassionate, faithful Jesus was patient in hissufferings until he took that book, since he knew that his death meant life for many. Just as in thecase of a will which has not yet been opened, for the fortune of the deceased master of the house ishidden, so also in the case of the All which had been hidden as long as the Father of the All wasinvisible and unique in himself, in whom every space has its source. For this reason Jesusappeared. He took that book as his own. He was nailed to a cross. He affixed the edict of theFather to the cross. Oh, such great teaching! He abases himself even unto death, though he is clothed in eternal life.Having divested himself of these perishable rags, he clothed himself in incorruptibility, which noone could possibly take from him. Having entered into the empty territory of fears, he passedbefore those who were stripped by forgetfulness, being both knowledge and perfection,proclaiming the things that are in the heart of the Father, so that he became the wisdom of thosewho have received instruction. But those who are to be taught, the living who are inscribed in thebook of the living, learn for themselves, receiving instructions from the Father, turning to himagain. Since the perfection of the All is in the Father, it is necessary for the All to ascend to him.Therefore, if one has knowledge, he gets what belongs to him and draws it to himself. For he whois ignorant, is deficient, and it is a great deficiency, since he lacks that which will make himperfect. Since the perfection of the All is in the Father, it is necessary for the All to ascend to himand for each one to get the things which are his. He registered them first, having prepared them tobe given to those who came from him. Those whose name he knew first were called last, so that the one who has knowledge is he whosename the Father has pronounced. For he whose name has not been spoken is ignorant. Indeed,how shall one hear if his name has not been uttered? For he who remains ignorant until the end isa creature of forgetfulness and will perish with it. If this is not so, why have these wretches noname, why do they have no sound? Hence, if one has knowledge, he is from above. If he is called,he hears, he replies, and he turns toward him who called him and he ascends to him and heknows what he is called. Since he has knowledge, he does the will of him who called him. Hedesires to please him and he finds rest. He receives a certain name. He who thus is going to haveknowledge knows whence he came and whither he is going. He knows it as a person who, havingbecome intoxicated, has turned from his drunkenness and having come to himself, has restoredwhat is his own. He has turned many from error. He went before them to their own places, from which theydeparted when they erred because of the depth of him who surrounds every place, whereas thereis nothing which surrounds him. It was a great wonder that they were in the Father withoutknowing him and that they were able to leave on their own, since they were not able to containhim and know him in whom they were, for indeed his will had not come forth from him. For herevealed it as a knowledge with which all its emanations agree, namely, the knowledge of theliving book which he revealed to the Aeons at last as his letters, displaying to them that these arenot merely vowels nor consonants, so that one may read them and think of something void ofmeaning; on the contrary, they are letters which convey the truth. They are pronounced onlywhen they are known. Each letter is a perfect truth like a perfect book, for they are letters writtenby the hand of the unity, since the Father wrote them for the Aeons, so that they by means of hisletters might come to know the Father. While his wisdom mediates on the logos, and since his teaching expresses it, his knowledge hasbeen revealed. His honor is a crown upon it. Since his joy agrees with it, his glory exalted it. It hasrevealed his image. It has obtained his rest. His love took bodily form around it. His trust- 25 -"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"embraced it. Thus the logos of the Father goes forth into the All, being the fruit of his heart andexpression of his will. It supports the All. It chooses and also takes the form of the All, purifying it,and causing it to return to the Father and to the Mother, Jesus of the utmost sweetness. The Fatheropens his bosom, but his bosom is the Holy Spirit. He reveals his hidden self which is his son, sothat through the compassion of the Father the Aeons may know him, end their wearying searchfor the Father and rest themselves in him, knowing that this is rest. After he had filled what wasincomplete, he did away with form. The form of it is the world, that which it served. For wherethere is envy and strife, there is an incompleteness; but where there is unity, there is completeness.Since this incompleteness came about because they did not know the Father, so when they knowthe Father, incompleteness, from that moment on, will cease to exist. As one's ignorancedisappears when he gains knowledge, and as darkness disappears when light appears, so alsoincompleteness is eliminated by completeness. Certainly, from that moment on, form is no longermanifest, but will be dissolved in fusion with unity. For now their works lie scattered. In timeunity will make the spaces complete. By means of unity each one will understand itself. By meansof knowledge it will purify itself of diversity with a view towards unity, devouring matter withinitself like fire and darkness by light, death by life. Certainly, if these things have happened to each one of us, it is fitting for us, surely, to think aboutthe All so that the house may be holy and silent for unity. Like people who have moved from aneighborhood, if they have some dishes around which are not good, they usually break them.Nevertheless the householder does not suffer a loss, but rejoices, for in the place of these defectivedishes there are those which are completely perfect. For this is the judgement which has comefrom above and which has judged every person, a drawn two-edged sword cutting on this sideand that. When it appeared, I mean, the Logos, who is in the heart of those who pronounce it - itwas not merely a sound but it has become a body - a great disturbance occurred among the dishes,for some were emptied, others filled: some were provided for, others were removed; some werepurified, still others were broken. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed for they had nocomposure nor stability. Error was disturbed not knowing what it should do. It was troubled; itlamented, it was beside itself because it did not know anything. When knowledge, which is itsabolishment, approached it with all its emanations, error is empty, since there is nothing in it.Truth appeared; all its emanations recognized it. They actually greeted the Father with a powerwhich is complete and which joins them with the Father. For each one loves truth because truth isthe mouth of the Father. His tongue is the Holy Spirit, who joins him to truth attaching him to themouth of the Father by his tongue at the time he shall receive the Holy Spirit. This is the manifestation of the Father and his revelation to his Aeons. He revealed his hidden selfand explained it. For who is it who exists if it is not the Father himself? All the spaces are hisemanations. They knew that they stem from him as children from a perfect man. They knew thatthey had not yet received form nor had they yet received a name, every one of which the Fatherproduces. If they at that time receive form of his knowledge, though they are truly in him, they donot know him. But the Father is perfect. He knows every space which is within him. If he pleases,he reveals anyone whom he desires by giving him a form and by giving him a name; and he doesgive him a name and cause him to come into being. Those who do not yet exist are ignorant of himwho created them. I do not say, then, that those who do not yet exist are nothing. But they are inhim who will desire that they exist when he pleases, like the event which is going to happen. Onthe one hand, he knows, before anything is revealed, what he will produce. On the other hand, thefruit which has not yet been revealed does not know anything, nor is it anything either. Thus eachspace which, on its part, is in the Father comes from the existent one, who, on his part, hasestablished it from the nonexistent. [...] he who does not exist at all, will never exist. What, then, is that which he wants him to think? \"I am like the shadows and phantoms of thenight.\" When morning comes, this one knows that the fear which he had experienced was nothing.Thus they were ignorant of the Father; he is the one whom they did not see. Since there had beenfear and confusion and a lack of confidence and doublemindness and division, there were manyillusions which were conceived by him, the foregoing, as well as empty ignorance - as if they werefast asleep and found themselves a prey to troubled dreams. Either there is a place to which they- 26 -"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"flee, or they lack strength as they come, having pursued unspecified things. Either they areinvolved in inflicting blows, or they themselves receive bruises. Either they are falling from highplaces, or they fly off through the air, though they have no wings at all. Other times, it is as ifcertain people were trying to kill them, even though there is no one pursuing them; or, theythemselves are killing those beside them, for they are stained by their blood. Until the momentwhen they who are passing through all these things - I mean they who have experienced all theseconfusions - awake, they see nothing because the dreams were nothing. It is thus that they whocast ignorance from them as sheep do not consider it to be anything, nor regard its properties to besomething real, but they renounce them like a dream in the night and they consider theknowledge of the Father to be the dawn. It is thus that each one has acted, as if he were asleep,during the time when he was ignorant and thus he comes to understand, as if he were awakening.And happy is the man who comes to himself and awakens. Indeed, blessed is he who has openedthe eyes of the blind. And the Spirit came to him in haste when it raised him. Having given its hand to the one lyingprone on the ground, it placed him firmly on his feet, for he had not yet stood up. He gave themthe means of knowing the knowledge of the Father and the revelation of his son. For when theysaw it and listened to it, he permitted them to take a taste of and to smell and to grasp the belovedson. He appeared, informing them of the Father, the illimitable one. He inspired them with that whichis in the mind, while doing his will. Many received the light and turned towards him. But materialmen were alien to him and did not discern his appearance nor recognize him. For he came in thelikeness of flesh and nothing blocked his way because it was incorruptible and unrestrainable.Moreover, while saying new things, speaking about what is in the heart of the Father, heproclaimed the faultless word. Light spoke through his mouth, and his voice brought forth life. Hegave them thought and understanding and mercy and salvation and the Spirit of strength derivedfrom the limitlessness of the Father and sweetness. He caused punishments and scourgings tocease, for it was they which caused many in need of mercy to astray from him in error and inchains - and he mightily destroyed them and derided them with knowledge. He became a path forthose who went astray and knowledge to those who were ignorant, a discovery for those whosought, and a support for those who tremble, a purity for those who were defiled. He is the shepherd who left behind the ninety-nine sheep which had not strayed and went insearch of that one which was lost. He rejoiced when he had found it. For ninety-nine is a numberof the left hand, which holds it. The moment he finds the one, however, the whole number istransferred to the right hand. Thus it is with him who lacks the one, that is, the entire right handwhich attracts that in which it is deficient, seizes it from the left side and transfers it to the right. Inthis way, then, the number becomes one hundred. This number signifies the Father. He labored even on the Sabbath for the sheep which he found fallen into the pit. He saved the lifeof that sheep, bringing it up from the pit in order that you may understand fully what thatSabbath is, you who possess full understanding. It is a day in which it is not fitting that salvationbe idle, so that you may speak of that heavenly day which has no night and of the sun which doesnot set because it is perfect. Say then in your heart that you are this perfect day and that in you thelight which does not fail dwells. Speak concerning the truth to those who seek it and of knowledge to those who, in their error,have committed sin. Make sure-footed those who stumble and stretch forth your hands to the sick.Nourish the hungry and set at ease those who are troubled. Foster men who love. Raise up andawaken those who sleep. For you are this understanding which encourages. If the strong followthis course, they are even stronger. Turn your attention to yourselves. Do not be concerned withother things, namely, that which you have cast forth from yourselves, that which you havedismissed. Do not return to them to eat them. Do not be moth-eaten. Do not be worm-eaten, foryou have already shaken it off. Do not be a place of the devil, for you have already destroyed him.Do not strengthen your last obstacles, because that is reprehensible. For the lawless one is nothing.He harms himself more than the law. For that one does his works because he is a lawless person.- 27 -"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"But this one, because he is a righteous person, does his works among others. Do the will of theFather, then, for you are from him. For the Father is sweet and his will is good. He knows the things that are yours, so that you mayrest yourselves in them. For by the fruits one knows the things that are yours, that they are thechildren of the Father, and one knows his aroma, that you originate from the grace of hiscountenance. For this reason, the Father loved his aroma; and it manifests itself in every place; andwhen it is mixed with matter, he gives his aroma to the light; and into his rest he causes it toascend in every form and in every sound. For there are no nostrils which smell the aroma, but it isthe Spirit which possesses the sense of smell and it draws it for itself to itself and sinks into thearoma of the Father. He is, indeed, the place for it, and he takes it to the place from which it hascome, in the first aroma which is cold. It is something in a psychic form, resembling cold waterwhich is [...] since it is in soil which is not hard, of which those who see it think, \"It is earth.\"Afterwards, it becomes soft again. If a breath is taken, it is usually hot. The cold aromas, then, arefrom the division. For this reason, God came and destroyed the division and he brought the hotPleroma of love, so that the cold may not return, but the unity of the Perfect Thought prevail. This is the word of the Gospel of the finding of the Pleroma for those who wait for the salvationwhich comes from above. When their hope, for which they are waiting, is waiting - they whoselikeness is the light in which there is no shadow, then at that time the Pleroma is about to come.The deficiency of matter, however, is not because of the limitlessness of the Father who comes atthe time of the deficiency. And yet no one is able to say that the incorruptible One will come inthis manner. But the depth of the Father is increasing, and the thought of error is not with him. Itis a matter of falling down and a matter of being readily set upright at the finding of that one whohas come to him who will turn back. For this turning back is called \"repentance\". For this reason, incorruption has breathed. It followedhim who has sinned in order that he may find rest. For forgiveness is that which remains for thelight in the deficiency, the word of the pleroma. For the physician hurries to the place in whichthere is sickness, because that is the desire which he has. The sick man is in a deficient condition,but he does not hide himself because the physician possesses that which he lacks. In this mannerthe deficiency is filled by the Pleroma, which has no deficiency, which has given itself out in orderto fill the one who is deficient, so that grace may take him, then, from the area which is deficientand has no grace. Because of this a diminishing occurred in the place which there is no grace, thearea where the one who is small, who is deficient, is taken hold of. He revealed himself as a Pleroma, i.e., the finding of the light of truth which has shined towardshim, because he is unchangeable. For this reason, they who have been troubled speak about Christin their midst so that they may receive a return and he may anoint them with the ointment. Theointment is the pity of the Father, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anointedare those who are perfect. For the filled vessels are those which are customarily used for anointing.But when an anointing is finished, the vessel is usually empty, and the cause of its deficiency isthe consumption of its ointment. For then a breath is drawn only through the power which he has.But the one who is without deficiency - one does not trust anyone beside him nor does one pouranything out. But that which is the deficient is filled again by the perfect Father. He is good. Heknows his plantings because he is the one who has planted them in his Paradise. And his Paradiseis his place of rest. This is the perfection in the thought of the Father and these are the words of his reflection. Eachone of his words is the work of his will alone, in the revelation of his Logos. Since they were in thedepth of his mind, the Logos, who was the first to come forth, caused them to appear, along withan intellect which speaks the unique word by means of a silent grace. It was called \"thought,\" sincethey were in it before becoming manifest. It happened, then, that it was the first to come forth - atthe moment pleasing to the will of him who desired it; and it is in the will that the Father is at restand with which he is pleased. Nothing happens without him, nor does anything occur without thewill of the Father. But his will is incomprehensible. His will is his mark, but no one can know it,nor is it possible for them to concentrate on it in order to possess it. But that which he wishes takesplace at the moment he wishes it - even if the view does not please anyone: it is God`s will. For the- 28 -"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Father knows the beginning of them all as well as their end. For when their end arrives, he willquestion them to their faces. The end, you see, is the recognition of him who is hidden, that is, theFather, from whom the beginning came forth and to whom will return all who have come fromhim. For they were made manifest for the glory and the joy of his name. And the name of the Father is the Son. It is he who, in the beginning, gave a name to him whocame forth from him - he is the same one - and he begat him for a son. He gave him his namewhich belonged to him - he, the Father, who possesses everything which exists around him. Hepossess the name; he has the son. It is possible for them to see him. The name, however, isinvisible, for it alone is the mystery of the invisible about to come to ears completely filled with itthrough the Father`s agency. Moreover, as for the Father, his name is not pronounced, but it isrevealed through a son. Thus, then, the name is great. Who, then, has been able to pronounce a name for him, this great name, except him alone towhom the name belongs and the sons of the name in whom the name of the Father is at rest, andwho themselves in turn are at rest in his name, since the Father has no beginning? It is he alonewho engendered it for himself as a name in the beginning before he had created the Aeons, thatthe name of the Father should be over their heads as a lord - that is, the real name, which is secureby his authority and by his perfect power. For the name is not drawn from lexicons nor is hisname derived from common name-giving, But it is invisible. He gave a name to himself alone,because he alone saw it and because he alone was capable of giving himself a name. For he whodoes not exist has no name. For what name would one give him who did not exist? Nevertheless,he who exists also with his name and he alone knows it, and to him alone the Father gave a name.The Son is his name. He did not, therefore, keep it secretly hidden, but the son came into existence.He himself gave a name to him. The name, then, is that of the Father, just as the name of theFather is the Son. For otherwise, where would compassion find a name - outside of the Father? Butsomeone will probably say to his companion, \"Who would give a name to someone who existedbefore himself, as if, indeed, children did not receive their name from one of those who gave thembirth?\" Above all, then, it is fitting for us to think this point over: What is the name? It is the real name. Itis, indeed, the name which came from the Father, for it is he who owns the name. He did not, yousee, get the name on loan, as in the case of others because of the form in which each one of them isgoing to be created. This, then, is the authoritative name. There is no one else to whom he hasgiven it. But it remained unnamed, unuttered, `till the moment when he, who is perfect,pronounced it himself; and it was he alone who was able to pronounce his name and to see it.When it pleased him, then, that his son should be his pronounced name and when he gave thisname to him, he who has come from the depth spoke of his secrets, because he knew that theFather was absolute goodness. For this reason, indeed, he sent this particular one in order that hemight speak concerning the place and his place of rest from which he had come forth, and that hemight glorify the Pleroma, the greatness of his name and the sweetness of his Father. Each one will speak concerning the place from which he has come forth, and to the region fromwhich he received his essential being, he will hasten to return once again. And he want from thatplace - the place where he was - because he tasted of that place, as he was nourished and grew.And his own place of rest is his Pleroma. All the emanations from the Father, therefore, arePleromas, and all his emanations have their roots in the one who caused them all to grow fromhimself. He appointed a limit. They, then, became manifest individually in order that they mightbe in their own thought, for that place to which they extend their thoughts is their root, which liftsthem upward through all heights to the Father. They reach his head, which is rest for them, andthey remain there near to it so that they say that they have participated in his face by means ofembraces. But these of this kind were not manifest, because they have not risen above themselves.Neither have they been deprived of the glory of the Father nor have they thought of him as small,nor bitter, nor angry, but as absolutely good, unperturbed, sweet, knowing all the spaces beforethey came into existence and having no need of instruction. Such are they who possess from abovesomething of this immeasurable greatness, as they strain towards that unique and perfect one whoexists there for them. And they do not go down to Hades.

MacRaeSelection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.The gospel of truth is joy for those who have received from the Father of truth the grace ofknowing him, through the power of the Word that came forth from the pleroma, the one who is inthe thought and the mind of the Father, that is, the one who is addressed as 'the Savior', (that)being the name of the work he is to perform for the redemption of those who were ignorant of theFather, while in the name of the gospel is the proclamation of hope, being discovery for those whosearch for him. When the totality went about searching for the one from whom they had come forth - and thetotality was inside of him, the incomprehensible, inconceivable one who is superior to everythought - ignorance of the Father brought about anguish and terror; and the anguish grew solidlike a fog, so that no one was able to see. For this reason, error became powerful; it worked on itsown matter foolishly, not having known the truth. It set about with a creation, preparing withpower and beauty the substitute for the truth. This was not, then, a humiliation for him, the incomprehensible, inconceivable one, for they werenothing, the anguish and the oblivion and the creature of deceit, while the established truth isimmutable, imperturbable, perfect in beauty. For this reason, despise error. Thus, it had no root; it fell into a fog regarding the Father, while it was involved in preparingworks and oblivions and terrors, in order that by means of these it might entice those of themiddle and capture them. The oblivion of error was not revealed. It is not a [...] from the Father. Oblivion did not come intoexistence from the Father, although it did indeed come into existence because of him. But whatcomes into existence in him is knowledge, which appeared in order that oblivion might vanishand the Father might be known. Since oblivion came into existence because the Father was notknown, then if the Father comes to be known, oblivion will not exist from that moment on. Through this, the gospel of the one who is searched for, which <was> revealed to those who areperfect, through the mercies of the Father, the hidden mystery, Jesus, the Christ, enlightened thosewho were in darkness through oblivion. He enlightened them; he showed (them) a way; and theway is the truth which he taught them. For this reason, error grew angry at him, persecuted him, was distressed at him, (and) wasbrought to naught. He was nailed to a tree (and) he became fruit of the knowledge of the Father. Itdid not, however, cause destruction because it was eaten, but to those who ate it, it gave (cause) tobecome glad in the discovery, and he discovered them in himself, and they discovered him inthemselves. As for the incomprehensible, inconceivable one, the Father, the perfect one, the one who made thetotality, within him is the totality, and of him the totality has need. Although he retained theirperfection within himself, which he did not give to the totality, the Father was not jealous. Whatjealousy indeed (could there be) between himself and his members? For if this aeon had thusreceived their perfection, they could not have come [...] the Father. He retains within himself theirperfection, granting it to them as a return to him, and a perfectly unitary knowledge. It is he whofashioned the totality, and within him is the totality, and the totality was in need of him. As in the case of a person of whom some are ignorant, he wishes to have them know him and lovehim, so - for what did the totality have need of if not knowledge regarding the Father? - he becamea guide, restful and leisurely. In schools he appeared, (and) he spoke the word as a teacher. Therecame the men wise in their own estimation, putting him to the test. But he confounded them,because they were foolish. They hated him, because they were not really wise. - 31 -"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"After all these, there came the little children also, those to whom the knowledge of the Fatherbelongs. Having been strengthened, they learned about the impressions of the Father. They knew,they were known; they were glorified, they glorified. There was manifested in their heart theliving book of the living - the one written in the thought and the mind of the Father, which frombefore the foundation of the totality was within his incomprehensibility - that (book) which no onewas able to take, since it remains for the one who will take it to be slain. No one could havebecome manifest from among those who have believed in salvation unless that book hadappeared. For this reason, the merciful one, the faithful one, Jesus, was patient in acceptingsufferings until he took that book, since he knows that his death is life for many. Just as there lies hidden in a will, before it is opened, the fortune of the deceased master of thehouse, so (it is) with the totality, which lay hidden while the Father of the totality was invisible,being something which is from him, from whom every space comes forth. For this reason Jesusappeared; he put on that book; he was nailed to a tree; he published the edict of the Father on thecross. O such great teaching! He draws himself down to death, though life eternal clothes him.Having stripped himself of the perishable rags, he put on imperishability, which no one canpossibly take away from him. Having entered the empty spaces of terrors, he passed throughthose who were stripped naked by oblivion, being knowledge and perfection, proclaiming thethings that are in the heart, [...] teach those who will receive teaching. But those who are to receive teaching are the living, who are inscribed in the book of the living. Itis about themselves that they receive instruction, receiving it from the Father, turning again tohim. Since the perfection of the totality is in the Father, it is necessary for the totality to ascend tohim. Then, if one has knowledge, he receives what are his own, and draws them to himself. For hewho is ignorant is in need, and what he lacks is great, since he lacks that which will make himperfect. Since the perfection of the totality is in the Father, and it is necessary for the totality toascend to him, and for each one to receive what are his own, he enrolled them in advance, havingprepared them to give to those who came forth from him. Those whose name he knew in advance were called at the end, so that one who has knowledge isthe one whose name the Father has uttered. For he whose name has not been spoken is ignorant.Indeed, how is one to hear, if his name has not been called? For he who is ignorant until the end isa creature of oblivion, and he will vanish along with it. If not, how is it that these miserable oneshave no name, (that) they do not have the call? Therefore, if one has knowledge, his is from above.If he is called, he hears, he answers, and he turns to him who is calling him, and ascends to him.And he knows in what manner he is called. Having knowledge, he does the will of the one whocalled him, he wishes to be pleasing to him, he receives rest. Each one's name comes to him. Hewho is to have knowledge in this manner knows where he comes from and where he is going. Heknows as one who, having become drunk, has turned away from his drunkenness, (and) havingreturned to himself, has set right what are his own. He has brought many back from error. He has gone before them to their places, from which theyhad moved away, since it was on account of the depth that they received error, the depth of theone who encircles all spaces, while there is none that encircles him. It was a great wonder thatthey were in the Father, not knowing him, and (that) they were able to come forth by themselves,since they were unable to comprehend or to know the one in whom they were. For if his will hadnot thus emerged from him - for he revealed it in view of a knowledge in which all its emanationsconcur. This is the knowledge of the living book, which he revealed to the aeons at the end as his letters,revealing how they are not vowels nor are they consonants, so that one might read them and thinkof something foolish, but (rather that) they are letters of the truth, which they alone speak whoknow them. Each letter is a complete <thought>, like a complete book, since they are letterswritten by the Unity, the Father having written them for the aeons, in order that by means of hisletters they should know the Father. While his wisdom contemplates the Word, and his teaching utters it, his knowledge has revealed<it>. While forebearance is a crown upon it, and his gladness is in harmony with it, his glory has- 32 -"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"exalted it, his image has revealed it, his repose has received it into itself, his love has made a bodyover it, his fidelity has embraced it. In this way, the Word of the Father goes forth in the totality, asthe fruit of his heart and an impression of his will. But it supports the totality, purifying them,bringing them back into the Father, into the Mother, Jesus of the infinite sweetness. The Father reveals his bosom. - Now his bosom is the Holy Spirit. - He reveals what is hidden ofhim - what is hidden of him is his Son - so that through the mercies of the Father, the aeons mayknow him and cease laboring in search of the Father, resting there in him, knowing that this is the(final) rest. Having filled the deficiency, he abolished the form - the form of it is the world, that inwhich he served. - For the place where there is envy and strife is deficient, but the place where(there is) Unity is perfect. Since the deficiency came into being because the Father was not known,therefore, when the Father is known, from that moment on, the deficiency will no longer exist. Asin the case of the ignorance of a person, when he comes to have knowledge, his ignorancevanishes of itself, as the darkness vanishes when the light appears, so also the deficiency vanishesin the perfection. So from that moment on, the form is not apparent, but it will vanish in the fusionof Unity, for now their works lie scattered. In time, Unity will perfect the spaces. It is within Unitythat each one will attain himself; within knowledge, he will purify himself from multiplicity intoUnity, consuming matter within himself like fire, and darkness by light, death by life. If indeed these things have happened to each one of us, then we must see to it above all that thehouse will be holy and silent for the Unity - as in the case of some people who moved out ofdwellings having jars that in spots were not good. They would break them, and the master of thehouse would not suffer loss. Rather, <he> is glad, because in place of the bad jars (there are) fullones which are made perfect. For such is the judgment which has come from above. It has passedjudgment on everyone; it is a drawn sword, with two edges, cutting on either side. When theWord appeared, the one that is within the heart of those who utter it - it is not a sound alone, but itbecame a body - a great disturbance took place among the jars, because some had been emptied,others filled; that is, some had been supplied, others poured out, some had been purified, stillothers broken up. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed, because they had no order norstability. Error was upset, not knowing what to do; it was grieved, in mourning, afflicting itselfbecause it knew nothing. When knowledge drew near it - this is the downfall of (error) and all itsemanations - error is empty, having nothing inside. Truth appeared; all its emanations knew it. They greeted the Father in truth with a perfect powerthat joins them with the Father. For, as for everyone who loves the truth - because the truth is themouth of the Father; his tongue is the Holy Spirit - he who is joined to the truth is joined to theFather's mouth by his tongue, whenever he is to receive the Holy Spirit, since this is themanifestation of the Father, and his revelation to his aeons. He manifested what was hidden of him; he explained it. For who contains, if not the Father alone?All the spaces are his emanations. They have known that they came forth from him, like childrenwho are from a grown man. They knew that they had not yet received form, nor yet received aname, each one of which the Father begets. Then, when they receive form by his knowledge,though truly within him, they do not know him. But the Father is perfect, knowing every spacewithin him. If he wishes, he manifests whomever he wishes, by giving him form and giving him aname, and he gives a name to him, and brings it about that those come into existence who, beforethey come into existence, are ignorant of him who fashioned them. I do not say, then, that they are nothing (at all) who have not yet come into existence, but they arein him who will wish that they come into existence when he wishes, like the time that is to come.Before all things appear, he knows what he will produce. But the fruit which is not yet manifestdoes not know anything, nor does it do anything. Thus also, every space which is itself in theFather is from the one who exists, who established it from what does not exist. For he who has noroot has no fruit either, but though he thinks to himself, \"I have come into being,\" yet he willperish by himself. For this reason, he who did not exist at all will never come into existence. What,then, did he wish him to think of himself? This: \"I have come into being like the shadows andphantoms of the night.\" When the light shines on the terror which that person had experienced, heknows that it is nothing. - 33 -"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Thus, they were ignorant of the Father, he being the one whom they did not see. Since it was terrorand disturbance and instability and doubt and division, there were many illusions at work bymeans of these, and (many) empty fictions, as if they were sunk in sleep, and found themselves indisturbing dreams. Either (there is) a place to which they are fleeing, or without strength theycome (from) having chased after others, or they are involved in striking blows, or they arereceiving blows themselves, or they have fallen from high places, or they take off into the air,though they do not even have wings. Again, sometimes (it is as) if people were murdering them,though there is no one even pursuing them, or they themselves are killing their neighbors, for theyhave been stained with their blood. When those who are going through all these things wake up,they see nothing, they who were in the midst of all these disturbances, for they are nothing. Suchis the way of those who have cast ignorance aside from them like sleep, not esteeming it asanything, nor do they esteem its works as solid things either, but (rather,) they leave them behindlike a dream in the night. The knowledge of the Father, they value as the dawn. This is the wayeach one has acted, as though asleep at the time when he was ignorant. And this is the way he has<come to knowledge>, as if he had awakened. {and} Good for the man who will return andawaken. And blessed is he who has opened the eyes of the blind. And the Spirit ran after him, hastening from waking him up. Having extended his hand to himwho lay upon the ground, he set him up on his feet, for he had not yet risen. He gave them themeans of knowing the knowledge of the Father and the revelation of his Son. For when they hadseen him and had heard him, he granted them to taste him, and to smell him, and to touch thebeloved Son. When he had appeared, instructing them about the Father, the incomprehensible one, when hehad breathed into them what is in the thought, doing his will, when many had received the light,they turned to him. For the material ones were strangers, and did not see his likeness, and had notknown him. For he came by means of fleshly form, while nothing blocked his course, becauseincorruptibility is irresistible, since he, again, spoke new things, still speaking about what is in theheart of the Father, having brought forth the flawless Word. When light had spoken through his mouth, as well as his voice, which gave birth to life, he gavethem thought and understanding, and mercy and salvation, and the powerful spirit from theinfiniteness and the sweetness of the Father. Having made punishments and tortures cease - for itwas they which were leading astray from his face some who were in need of mercy, in error andin bonds - he both destroyed them with power and confounded them with knowledge. He becamea way for those who were gone astray, and knowledge for those who were ignorant, a discoveryfor those who were searching, and a support for those who were wavering, immaculateness forthose who were defiled. He is the shepherd who left behind the ninety-nine sheep which were not lost. He went searchingfor the one which had gone astray. He rejoiced when he found it, for ninety-nine is a number thatis in the left hand, which holds it. But when the one is found, the entire number passes to the right(hand). As that which lacks the one - that is, the entire right (hand) - draws what was deficient andtakes it from the left-hand side and brings (it) to the right, so too the number becomes onehundred. It is the sign of the one who is in their sound; it is the Father. Even on the Sabbath, helabored for the sheep which he found fallen into the pit. He gave life to the sheep, having broughtit up from the pit, in order that you might know interiorly - you, the sons of interior knowledge -what is the Sabbath, on which it is not fitting for salvation to be idle, in order that you may speakfrom the day from above, which has no night, and from the light which does not sink, because it isperfect. Say, then, from the heart, that you are the perfect day, and in you dwells the light that does notfail. Speak of the truth with those who search for it, and (of) knowledge to those who havecommitted sin in their error. Make firm the foot of those who have stumbled, and stretch out yourhands to those who are ill. Feed those who are hungry, and give repose to those who are weary,and raise up those who wish to rise, and awaken those who sleep. For you are the understandingthat is drawn forth. If strength acts thus, it becomes even stronger. Be concerned with yourselves;do not be concerned with other things which you have rejected from yourselves. Do not return to- 34 -"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"what you have vomited, to eat it. Do not be moths. Do not be worms, for you have already cast itoff. Do not become a (dwelling) place for the devil, for you have already destroyed him. Do notstrengthen (those who are) obstacles to you, who are collapsing, as though (you were) a support(for them). For the lawless one is someone to treat ill, rather than the just one. For the former doeshis work as a lawless person; the latter as a righteous person does his work among others. So you,do the will of the Father, for you are from him. For the Father is sweet, and in his will is what is good. He has taken cognizance of the things thatare yours, that you might find rest in them. For by the fruits does one take cognizance of thethings that are yours, because the children of the Father are his fragrance, for they are from thegrace of his countenance. For this reason, the Father loves his fragrance, and manifests it in everyplace. And if it mixes with matter, he gives his fragrance to the light, and in his repose, he causes itto surpass every form (and) every sound. For it is not the ears that smell the fragrance, but (it is)the breath that has the sense of smell and attracts the fragrance to itself, and is submerged in thefragrance of the Father, so that he thus shelters it, and takes it to the place where it came from,from the first fragrance, which is grown cold. It is something in a psychic form, being like coldwater which has frozen (?), which is on earth that is not solid, of which those who see it think it isearth; afterwards, it dissolves again. If a breath draws it, it gets hot. The fragrances, therefore, thatare cold are from the division. For this reason, faith came; it dissolved the division, and it broughtthe warm pleroma of love, in order that the cold should not come again, but (that) there should bethe unity of perfect thought. This <is> the word of the gospel of the discovery of the pleroma, for those who await the salvationwhich is coming from on high. While their hope, for which they are waiting, is in waiting - theywhose image is light with no shadow in it - then, at that time, the pleroma is proceeding to come.The <deficiency> of matter came to be not through the limitlessness of the Father, who is comingto give time for the deficiency, although no one could say that the incorruptible one would comein this way. But the depth of the Father was multiplied, and the thought of error did not exist withhim. It is a thing that falls, (and) it is a thing that easily stands upright (again), in the discovery ofhim who has come to him whom he shall bring back. For the bringing-back is called 'repentence'. For this reason, incorruptibility breathed forth; it pursued the one who had sinned, in order thathe might rest. For forgiveness is what remains for the light in the deficiency, the word of thepleroma. For the physician runs to the place where sickness is, because that is the will that is inhim. He who has a deficiency, then, does not hide it, because one has what the other lacks. So thepleroma, which has no deficiency, but (which) fills up the deficiency, is what he provided fromhimself for filling up what he lacks, in order that therefore he might receive the grace. For when hewas deficient, he did not have the grace. That is why there was diminution existing in the placewhere there is no grace. When that which was diminished was received, he revealed what helacked, being (now) a pleroma; that is the discovery of the light of truth which rose upon himbecause it is immutable. That is why Christ was spoken of in their midst, so that those who were disturbed might receive abringing-back, and he might anoint them with the ointment. This ointment is the mercy of theFather, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anointed are the ones who havebecome perfect. For full jars are the ones that are usually anointed. But when the anointing of one(jar) is dissolved, it is emptied, and the reason for there being a deficiency is the thing by which itsointment goes. For at that time a breath draws it, a thing in the power of that which is with it. Butfrom him who has no deficiency, no seal is removed, nor is anything emptied, but what he lacks,the perfect Father fills again. He is good. He knows his plantings, because it is he who plantedthem in his paradise. Now his paradise is his place of rest. This is the perfection in the thought of the Father, and these are the words of his meditation. Eachone of his words is the work of his one will in the revelation of his Word. While they were stilldepths of his thought, the Word, which was first to come forth, revealed them, along with a mindthat speaks the one Word in silent grace. He was called 'thought', since they were in it beforebeing revealed. It came about, then, that he was first to come forth, at the time when the will ofhim who willed desired it. And the will is what the Father rests in, and is pleased with. Nothing- 35 -"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"happens without him, nor does anything happen without the will of the Father, but his will isunsearchable. His trace is the will, and no one will know him, nor is it possible for one toscrutinize him, in order to grasp him. But when he wills, what he wills is this - even if the sightdoes not please them in any way before God - desiring the Father. For he knows the beginning ofall of them, and their end. For at their end, he will question them directly. Now, the end isreceiving knowledge about the one who is hidden, and this is the Father, from whom thebeginning came forth, (and) to whom all will return who have come forth from him. And theyhave appeared for the glory and the joy of his name. Now the name of the Father is the Son. It is he who first gave a name to the one who came forthfrom him, who was himself, and he begot him as a son. He gave him his name, which belonged tohim; he is the one to whom belongs all that exists around him, the Father. His is the name; his isthe Son. It is possible for him to be seen. The name, however, is invisible, because it alone is themystery of the invisible, which comes to ears that are completely filled with it by him. For indeed,the Father's name is not spoken, but (rather,) it is apparent through a Son. In this way, then, the name is a great thing. Who, therefore, will be able to utter a name for him,the great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs, and the sons of the name, in whomrested the name of the Father, (who) in turn themselves rested in his name? Since the Father isunengendered, he alone is the one who begot him for him(self) as a name, before he brought forththe aeons, in order that the name of the Father should be over their head as lord, that is the namein truth, which is firm in his command, through perfect power. For the name is not from (mere)words, nor does his name consist of appellations, but (rather,) it is invisible. He gave a name tohim alone, since he alone sees him, he alone having the power to give him a name. For he whodoes not exist has no name. For what name is given to him who does not exist? But the one whoexists, exists also with his name, and he alone knows it, and (he) alone (knows how) to give him aname. It is the Father. The Son is his name. He did not, therefore, hide it in the thing, but it existed;as for the Son, he alone gave a name. The name, therefore, is that of the Father, as the name of theFather is the Son. Where indeed would compassion find a name, except with the Father? But no doubt one will say to his neighbor: \"Who is it who will give a name to him who existedbefore himself, as if offspring did not receive a name from those who begot <them>?\" First, then, itis fitting for us to reflect on this matter: What is the name? It is the name in truth; it is not thereforethe name from the Father, for it is the one which is the proper name. Therefore, he did not receivethe name on loan, as (do) others, according to the form in which each one is to be produced. Butthis is the proper name. There is no one else who gave it to him. But he <is> unnamable,indescribable, until the time when he who is perfect spoke of him alone. And it is he who has thepower to speak his name, and to see it. When, therefore, it pleased him that his name, which is loved, should be his Son, and he gave thename to him, that is, him who came forth from the depth, he spoke about his secret things,knowing that the Father is a being without evil. For that very reason, he brought him forth inorder to speak about the place, and (about) his resting-place, from which he had come forth, andto glorify the pleroma, the greatness of his name, and the sweetness of the Father. About the placeeach one came from, he will speak, and to the region where he received his establishment, he willhasten to return again and to take from that place - the place where he stood - receiving a tastefrom that place, and receiving nourishment, receiving growth. And his own resting-place is hispleroma. Therefore, all the emanations of the Father are pleromas, and the root of all his emanations is inthe one who made them all grow up in himself. He assigned them their destinies. Each one, then,is manifest, in order that through their own thought <...>. For the place to which they send theirthought, that place, their root, is what takes them up in all the heights, to the Father. They possesshis head, which is rest for them, and they are supported, approaching him, as though to say thatthey have participated in his face by means of kisses. But they do not become manifest in this way,for they are not themselves exalted; (yet) neither did they lack the glory of the Father, nor did theythink of him as small, nor that he is harsh, nor that he is wrathful, but (rather that) he is a being- 36 -"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"without evil, imperturbable, sweet, knowing all spaces before they have come into existence, andhe had no need to be instructed. This is the manner of those who possess (something) from above of the immensurable greatness,as they wait for the one alone, and the perfect one, the one who is there for them. And they do notgo down to Hades, nor have they envy nor groaning nor death within them, but (rather) they restin him who is at rest, not striving nor being twisted around the truth. But they themselves are thetruth; and the Father is within them, and they are in the Father, being perfect, being undivided inthe truly good one, being in no way deficient in anything, but they are set at rest, refreshed in theSpirit. And they will heed their root. They will be concerned with those (things) in which he willfind his root, and not suffer loss to his soul. This is the place of the blessed; this is their place. For the rest, then, may they know, in their places, that it is not fitting for me, having come to be inthe resting-place, to speak of anything else. But it is in it that I shall come to be, and (it is fitting) tobe concerned at all times with the Father of the all, and the true brothers, those upon whom thelove of the Father is poured out, and in whose midst there is no lack of him. They are the oneswho appear in truth, since they exist in true and eternal life, and (since they) speak of the lightwhich is perfect, and (which is) filled with the seed of the Father, and which is in his heart and inthe pleroma, while his Spirit rejoices in it and glorifies the one in whom it existed, because he isgood. And his children are perfect and worthy of his name, for he is the Father; it is children ofthis kind that he loves. - 37 -"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Treatise on the ResurrectionCODEX ITranslated by Malcolm L. PeelSelection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.Some there are, my son Rheginos, who want to learn many things. They have this goal when theyare occupied with questions whose answer is lacking. If they succeed with these, they usuallythink very highly of themselves. But I do not think that they have stood within the Word of Truth.They seek rather their own rest, which we have received through our Savior, our Lord Christ. Wereceived it when we came to know the truth and rested ourselves upon it. But since you ask uspleasantly what is proper concerning the resurrection, I am writing you that it is necessary. To besure, many are lacking faith in it, but there are a few who find it. So then, let us discuss the matter.How did the Lord proclaim things while he existed in flesh and after he had revealed himself asSon of God? He lived in this place where you remain, speaking about the Law of Nature - but Icall it 'Death'. Now the Son of God, Rheginos, was Son of Man. He embraced them both,possessing the humanity and the divinity, so that on the one hand he might vanquish deaththrough his being Son of God, and that on the other through the Son of Man the restoration to thePleroma might occur; because he was originally from above, a seed of Truth, before this structurehad come into being. In this many dominions and divinities came into existence. I know that I am presenting the solution in difficult terms, but there is nothing difficult in theWord of Truth. But since the Solution appeared so as not to leave anything hidden, but to revealall things openly concerning existence - the destruction of evil on the one hand, the revelation ofthe elect on the other. This is the emanation of Truth and Spirit, Grace is of the Truth. The Savior swallowed up death - (of this) you are not reckoned as being ignorant - for he put asidethe world which is perishing. He transformed himself into an imperishable Aeon and raisedhimself up, having swallowed the visible by the invisible, and he gave us the way of ourimmortality. Then, indeed, as the Apostle said, \"We suffered with him, and we arose with him,and we went to heaven with him\". Now if we are manifest in this world wearing him, we are thatone`s beams, and we are embraced by him until our setting, that is to say, our death in this life. Weare drawn to heaven by him, like beams by the sun, not being restrained by anything. This is thespiritual resurrection which swallows up the psychic in the same way as the fleshly. But if there is one who does not believe, he does not have the (capacity to be) persuaded. For it isthe domain of faith, my son, and not that which belongs to persuasion: the dead shall arise! Thereis one who believes among the philsophers who are in this world. At least he will arise. And letnot the philosopher who is in this world have cause to believe that he is one who returns himselfby himself - and (that) because of our faith! For we have known the Son of Man, and we havebelieved that he rose from among the dead. This is he of whom we say, \"He became thedestruction of death, as he is a great one in whom they believe.\" Great are those who believe. The thought of those who are saved shall not perish. The mind of those who have known himshall not perish. Therefore, we are elected to salvation and redemption since we are predestinedfrom the beginning not to fall into the foolishness of those who are without knowledge, but weshall enter into the wisdom of those who have known the Truth. Indeed, the Truth which is keptcannot be abandoned, nor has it been. \"Strong is the system of the Pleroma; small is that whichbroke loose (and) became (the) world. But the All is what is encompassed. It has not come intobeing; it was existing.\" So, never doubt concerning the resurrection, my son Rheginos! For if youwere not existing in flesh, you received flesh when you entered this world. Why will you notreceive flesh when you ascend into the Aeon? That which is better than the flesh is that which isfor (the) cause of life. That which came into being on your account, is it not yours? Does not thatwhich is yours exist with you? Yet, while you are in this world, what is it that you lack? This iswhat you have been making every effort to learn. - 38 -"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The afterbirth of the body is old age, and you exist in corruption. You have absence as a gain. Foryou will not give up what is better if you depart. That which is worse has diminution, but there isgrace for it. Nothing, then, redeems us from this world. But the All which we are, we are saved. We havereceived salvation from end to end. Let us think in this way! Let us comprehend in this way! But there are some (who) wish to understand, in the enquiry about those things they are lookinginto, whether he who is saved, if he leaves his body behind, will be saved immediately. Let no onedoubt concerning this. [...]. indeed, the visible members which are dead shall not be saved, for(only) the living members which exist within them would arise. What, then, is the resurrection? It is always the disclosure of those who have risen. For if youremember reading in the Gospel that Elijah appeared and Moses with him, do not think theresurrection is an illusion. It is no illusion, but it is truth! Indeed, it is more fitting to say the worldis an illusion, rather than the resurrection which has come into being through our Lord the Savior,Jesus Christ. But what am I telling you now? Those who are living shall die. How do they live in an illusion?The rich have become poor, and the kings have been overthrown. Everything is prone to change.The world is an illusion! - lest, indeed, I rail at things to excess! But the resurrection does not have this aforesaid character, for it is the truth which stands firm. Itis the revelation of what is, and the transformation of things, and a transition into newness. Forimperishability descends upon the perishable; the light flows down upon the darkness,swallowing it up; and the Pleroma fills up the deficiency. These are the symbols and the images ofthe resurrection. He it is who makes the good. Therefore, do not think in part, O Rheginos, nor live in conformity with this flesh for the sake ofunanimity, but flee from the divisions and the fetters, and already you have the resurrection. For ifhe who will die knows about himself that he will die - even if he spends many years in this life, heis brought to this - why not consider yourself as risen and (already) brought to this? If you havethe resurrection but continue as if you are to die - and yet that one knows that he has died - why,then, do I ignore your lack of exercise? It is fitting for each one to practice in a number of ways,and he shall be released from this Element that he may not fall into error but shall himself receiveagain what at first was. These things I have received from the generosity of my Lord, Jesus Christ. I have taught you andyour brethren, my sons, considering them, while I have not omitted any of the things suitable forstrengthening you. But if there is one thing written which is obscure in my exposition of the Word,I shall interpret it for you (pl.) when you (pl.) ask. But now, do not be jealous of anyone who is inyour number when he is able to help. Many are looking into this which I have written to you. To these I say: Peace (be) among them andgrace. I greet you and those who love you (pl.) in brotherly Love.

Attridge and Dieter MuellerSelection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.Part I 1. IntroductionAs for what we can say about the things which are exalted, what is fitting is that we begin withthe Father, who is the root of the Totality, the one from whom we have received grace to speakabout him. 2. The Father He existed before anything other than himself came into being. The Father is a single one, like anumber, for he is the first one and the one who is only himself. Yet he is not like a solitaryindividual. Otherwise, how could he be a father? For whenever there is a \"father,\" the name \"son\"follows. But the single one, who alone is the Father, is like a root, with tree, branches and fruit. It issaid of him that he is a father in the proper sense, since he is inimitable and immutable. Because ofthis, he is single in the proper sense, and is a god, because no one is a god for him nor is anyone afather to him. For he is unbegotten, and there is no other who begot him, nor another who createdhim. For whoever is someone's father or his creator, he, too, has a father and creator. It is certainlypossible for him to be father and creator of the one who came into being from him and the onewhom he created, for he is not a father in the proper sense, nor a god, because he has someonewho begot him and who created him. It is, then, only the Father and God in the proper sense thatno one else begot. As for the Totalities, he is the one who begot them and created them. He iswithout beginning and without end. Not only is he without end - He is immortal for this reason, that he is unbegotten - but he is alsoinvariable in his eternal existence, in his identity, in that by which he is established, and in that bywhich he is great. Neither will he remove himself from that by which he is, nor will anyone elseforce him to produce an end which he has not ever desired. He has not had anyone who initiatedhis own existence. Thus, he is himself unchanged, and no one else can remove him from hisexistence and his identity, that in which he is, and his greatness, so that he cannot be grasped; noris it possible for anyone else to change him into a different form, or to reduce him, or alter him ordiminish him, - since this is so in the fullest sense of the truth - who is the unalterable, immutableone, with immutability clothing him. Not only is he the one called \"without a beginning\" and \"without an end,\" because he isunbegotten and immortal; but just as he has no beginning and no end as he is, he is unattainablein his greatness, inscrutable in his wisdom, incomprehensible in his power, and unfathomable inhis sweetness. In the proper sense, he alone - the good, the unbegotten Father, and the complete perfect one - isthe one filled with all his offspring, and with every virtue, and with everything of value. And hehas more, that is, lack of any malice, in order that it may be discovered that whoever has anythingis indebted to him, because he gives it, being himself unreachable and unwearied by that which hegives, since he is wealthy in the gifts which he bestows, and at rest in the favors which he grants. He is of such a kind and form and great magnitude that no one else has been with him from thebeginning; nor is there a place in which he is, or from which he has come forth, or into which hewill go; nor is there a primordial form, which he uses as a model as he works; nor is there anydifficulty which accompanies him in what he does; nor is there any material which is at hisdisposal, from which <he> creates what he creates; nor any substance within him from which he- 40 -"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"begets what he begets; nor a co-worker with him, working with him on the things at which heworks. To say anything of this sort is ignorant. Rather, (one should speak of him) as good,faultless, perfect, complete, being himself the Totality. Not one of the names which are conceived or spoken, seen or grasped - not one of them applies tohim, even though they are exceedingly glorious, magnifying and honored. However, it is possibleto utter these names for his glory and honor, in accordance with the capacity of each of those whogive him glory. Yet as for him, in his own existence, being and form, it is impossible for mind toconceive him, nor can any speech convey him, nor can any eye see him, nor can any body grasphim, because of his inscrutable greatness, and his incomprehensible depth, and his immeasurableheight, and his illimitable will. This is the nature of the unbegotten one, which does not touchanything else; nor is it joined (to anything) in the manner of something which is limited. Rather,he possesses this constitution, without having a face or a form, things which are understoodthrough perception, whence also comes (the epithet) \"the incomprehensible. If he isincomprehensible, then it follows that he is unknowable, that he is the one who is inconceivableby any thought, invisible by any thing, ineffable by any word, untouchable by any hand. He aloneis the one who knows himself as he is, along with his form and his greatness and his magnitude.And since he has the ability to conceive of himself, to see himself, to name himself, to comprehendhimself, he alone is the one who is his own mind, his own eye, his own mouth, his own form, andhe is what he thinks, what he sees, what he speaks, what he grasps, himself, the one who isinconceivable, ineffable, incomprehensible, immutable, while sustaining, joyous, true, delightful,and restful is that which he conceives, that which he sees, that about which he speaks, that whichhe has as thought. He transcends all wisdom, and is above all intellect, and is above all glory, andis above all beauty, and all sweetness, and all greatness, and any depth and any height. If this one, who is unknowable in his nature, to whom pertain all the greatnesses which I alreadymentioned - if, out of the abundance of his sweetness, he wishes to grant knowledge, so that hemight be known, he has the ability to do so. He has his Power, which is his will. Now, however, insilence he himself holds back, he who is the great one, who is the cause of bringing the Totalitiesinto their eternal being. It is in the proper sense that he begets himself as ineffable, since he alone is self-begotten, since heconceives of himself, and since he knows himself as he is. What is worthy of his admiration andglory and honor and praise, he produces because of the boundlessness of his greatness, and theunsearchability of his wisdom, and the immeasurability of his power, and his untasteablesweetness. He is the one who projects himself thus, as generation, having glory and honormarvelous and lovely; the one who glorifies himself, who marvels, <who> honors, who also loves;the one who has a Son, who subsists in him, who is silent concerning him, who is the ineffable onein the ineffable one, the invisible one, the incomprehensible one, the inconceivable one in theinconceivable one. Thus, he exists in him forever. The Father, in the way we mentioned earlier, inan unbegotten way, is the one in whom he knows himself, who begot him having a thought,which is the thought of him, that is, the perception of him, which is the [...] of his constitutionforever. That is, however, in the proper sense, the silence and the wisdom and the grace, if it isdesignated properly in this way. 3. The Son and the Church Just as the Father exists in the proper sense, the one before whom there was no one else, and theone apart from whom there is no other unbegotten one, so too the Son exists in the proper sense,the one before whom there was no other, and after whom no other son exists. Therefore, he is afirstborn and an only Son, \"firstborn\" because no one exists before him and \"only Son\" because noone is after him. Furthermore, he has his fruit, that which is unknowable because of its surpassinggreatness. Yet he wanted it to be known, because of the riches of his sweetness. And he revealedthe unexplainable power, and he combined with it the great abundance of his generosity. Not only did the Son exist from the beginning, but the Church, too, existed from the beginning.Now, he who thinks that the discovery that the Son is an only son opposes the statement (aboutthe Church) because of the mysterious quality of the matter, it is not so. For just as the Father is a- 41 -"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"unity, and has revealed himself as Father for him alone, so too the Son was found to be a brotherto himself alone, in virtue of the fact that he is unbegotten and without beginning. He wonders athimself, along with the Father, and he gives him(self) glory and honor and love. Furthermore, hetoo is the one whom he conceives of as Son, in accordance with the dispositions: \"withoutbeginning\" and \"without end.\" Thus is the matter something which is fixed. Being innumerableand illimitable, his offspring are indivisible. Those which exist have come forth from the Son andthe Father like kisses, because of the multitude of some who kiss one another with a good,insatiable thought, the kiss being a unity, although it involves many kisses. This is to say, it is theChurch consisting of many men that existed before the aeons, which is called, in the proper sense,\"the aeons of the aeons.\" This is the nature of the holy imperishable spirits, upon which the Sonrests, since it is his essence, just as the Father rests upon the Son. 4. Aeonic Emanations [...] the Church exists in the dispositions and properties in which the Father and the Son exist, as Ihave said from the start. Therefore, it subsists in the procreations of innumerable aeons. Also in anuncountable way they too beget, by the properties and the dispositions in which it (the Church)exists. For these comprise its association which they form toward one another and toward thosewho have come forth from them toward the Son, for whose glory they exist. Therefore, it is notpossible for mind to conceive of him - He was the perfection of that place - nor can speech expressthem, for they are ineffable and unnameable and inconceivable. They alone have the ability toname themselves and to conceive of themselves. For they have not been rooted in these places. Those of that place are ineffable, (and) innumerable in the system which is both the manner andthe size, the joy, the gladness of the unbegotten, nameless, unnameable, inconceivable, invisible,incomprehensible one. It is the fullness of paternity, so that his abundance is a begetting [...] of theaeons. They were forever in thought, for the Father was like a thought and a place for them. When theirgenerations had been established, the one who is completely in control wished to lay hold of andto bring forth that which was deficient in the [...] and he brought forth those [...] him. But since heis as he is, he is a spring, which is not diminished by the water which abundantly flows from it.While they were in the Father's thought, that is, in the hidden depth, the depth knew them, butthey were unable to know the depth in which they were; nor was it possible for them to knowthemselves, nor for them to know anything else. That is, they were with the Father; they did notexist for themselves. Rather, they only had existence in the manner of a seed, so that it has beendiscovered that they existed like a fetus. Like the word he begot them, subsisting spermatically,and the ones whom he was to beget had not yet come into being from him. The one who firstthought of them, the Father, - not only so that they might exist for him, but also that they mightexist for themselves as well, that they might then exist in his thought as mental substance and thatthey might exist for themselves too, - sowed a thought like a spermatic seed. Now, in order thatthey might know what exists for them, he graciously granted the initial form, while in order thatthey might recognize who is the Father who exists for them, he gave them the name \"Father\" bymeans of a voice proclaiming to them that what exists, exists through that name, which they haveby virtue of the fact that they came into being, because the exaltation, which has escaped theirnotice, is in the name. The infant, while in the form of a fetus has enough for itself, before ever seeing the one whosowed it. Therefore, they had the sole task of searching for him, realizing that he exists, everwishing to find out what exists. Since, however, the perfect Father is good, just as he did not hearthem at all so that they would exist (only) in his thought, but rather granted that they, too, mightcome into being, so also will he give them grace to know what exists, that is, the one who knowshimself eternally, [...] form to know what exists, just as people are begotten in this place: whenthey are born, they are in the light, so that they see those who have begotten them. The Father brought forth everything, like a little child, like a drop from a spring, like a blossomfrom a vine, like a flower, like a <planting> [...], in need of gaining nourishment and growth andfaultlessness. He withheld it for a time. He who had thought of it from the very beginning,- 42 -"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"possessed it from the very beginning, and saw it, but he closed it off to those who first came fromhim. (He did this,) not out of envy, but in order that the aeons might not receive their faultlessnessfrom the very beginning and might not exalt themselves to the glory, to the Father, and mightthink that from themselves alone they have this. But just as he wished to grant that they mightcome into being, so too, in order that they might come into being as faultless ones, when hewished, he gave them the perfect idea of beneficence toward them. The one whom he raised up as a light for those who came from himself, the one from whom theytake their name, he is the Son, who is full, complete and faultless. He brought him forth mingledwith what came forth from him [...] partaking of the [...] the Totality, in accordance with [...] bywhich each one can receive him for himself, though such was not his greatness before he wasreceived by it. Rather, he exists by himself. As for the parts in which he exists in his own mannerand form and greatness, it is possible for <them> to see him and speak about that which theyknow of him, since they wear him while he wears them, because it is possible for them tocomprehend him. He, however, is as he is, incomparable. In order that the Father might receivehonor from each one and reveal himself, even in his ineffability, hidden, and invisible, theymarvel at him mentally. Therefore, the greatness of his loftiness consists in the fact that they speakabout him and see him. He becomes manifest, so that he may be hymned because of theabundance of his sweetness, with the grace of <...>. And just as the admirations of the silences areeternal generations and they are mental offspring, so too the dispositions of the word are spiritualemanations. Both of them admirations and dispositions, since they belong to a word, are seedsand thoughts of his offspring, and roots which live forever, appearing to be offspring which havecome forth from themselves, being minds and spiritual offspring to the glory of the Father. There is no need for voice and spirit, mind and word, because there is no need to work at thatwhich they desire to do, but on the pattern by which he was existing, so are those who have comeforth from him, begetting everything which they desire. And the one whom they conceive of, andwhom they speak about, and the one toward whom they move, and the one in whom they are,and the one whom they hymn, thereby glorifying him, he has sons. For this is their procreativepower, like those from whom they have come, according to their mutual assistance, since theyassist one another like the unbegotten ones. The Father, in accordance with his exalted position over the Totalities, being an unknown andincomprehensible one, has such greatness and magnitude, that, if he had revealed himselfsuddenly, quickly, to all the exalted ones among the aeons who had come forth from him, theywould have perished. Therefore, he withheld his power and his inexhaustibility within that inwhich he is. He is ineffable and unnameable and exalted above every mind and every word. Thisone, however, stretched himself out and it was that which he stretched out which gave afoundation and a space and a dwelling place for the universe, a name of his being \"the onethrough whom,\" since he is Father of the All, out of his laboring for those who exist, having sowninto their thought that they might seek after him. The abundance of their [...] consists in the factthat they understand that he exists and in the fact that they ask what it is that was existing. Thisone was given to them for enjoyment and nourishment and joy and an abundance of illumination,which consists in his fellow laboring, his knowledge and his mingling with them, that is, the onewho is called and is, in fact, the Son, since he is the Totalities and the one of whom they know bothwho he is and that it is he who clothes. This is the one who is called \"Son\" and the one of whomthey understand that he exists and they were seeking after him. This is the one who exists asFather and (as) the one about whom they cannot speak, and the one of whom they do notconceive. This is the one who first came into being. It is impossible for anyone to conceive of him or think of him. Or can anyone approach there,toward the exalted one, toward the preexistent in the proper sense? But all the names conceived orspoken about him are presented in honor, as a trace of him, according to the ability of each one ofthose who glorify him. Now he who arose from him when he stretched himself out for begettingand for knowledge on the part of the Totalities, he [...] all of the names, without falsification, andhe is, in the proper sense, the sole first one, the man of the Father, that is, the one whom I call the form of the formless, - 43 -"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the body of the bodiless, the face of the invisible, the word of the unutterable, the mind of the inconceivable, the fountain which flowed from him, the root of those who are planted, and the god of those who exist, the light of those whom he illumines, the love of those whom he loved, the providence of those for whom he providentially cares, the wisdom of those whom he made wise, the power of those to whom he gives power, the assembly of those whom he assembles to him, the revelation of the things which are sought after, the eye of those who see, the breath of those who breathe, the life of those who live, the unity of those who are mixed with the Totalities. All of them exist in the single one, as he clothes himself completely and by his single name he isnever called. And in this unique way they are equally the single one and the Totalities. He isneither divided as a body, nor is he separated into the names which he has received, (so that) he isone thing in this way and another in another way. Also, neither does he change in [...], nor does heturn into the names which he thinks of, and become now this, now something else, this thing nowbeing one thing and, at another time, something else, but rather he is wholly himself to theuttermost. He is each and every one of the Totalities forever at the same time. He is what all ofthem are. He brought the Father to the Totalities. He also is the Totalities, for he is the one who isknowledge for himself and he is each one of the properties. He has the powers and he is beyondall that which he knows, while seeing himself in himself completely and having a Son and form.Therefore, his powers and properties are innumerable and inaudible, because of the begetting bywhich he begets them. Innumerable and indivisible are the begettings of his words, and hiscommands and his Totalities. He knows them, which things he himself is, since they are in thesingle name, and are all speaking in it. And he brings (them) forth, in order that it might bediscovered that they exist according to their individual properties in a unified way. And he didnot reveal the multitude to the Totalities at once nor did he reveal his equality to those who hadcome forth from him. 5. Aeonic Life All those who came forth from him <who> are the aeons of the aeons, being emanations andoffspring of <his> procreative nature, they too, in their procreative nature, have <given> glory tothe Father, as he was the cause of their establishment. This is what we said previously, namelythat he creates the aeons as roots and springs and fathers, and that he is the one to whom theygive glory. They have begotten, for he has knowledge and wisdom and the Totalities knew that itis from knowledge and wisdom that they have come forth. They would have brought forth aseeming honor: \"The Father is the one who is the Totalities,\" if the aeons had risen up to givehonor individually. Therefore, in the song of glorification and in the power of the unity of himfrom whom they have come, they were drawn into a mingling and a combination and a unity withone another. They offered glory worthy of the Father from the pleromatic congregation, which is asingle representation although many, because it was brought forth as a glory for the single oneand because they came forth toward the one who is himself the Totalities. Now, this was a praise- 44 -"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"[...] the one who brought forth the Totalities, being a first-fruit of the immortals and an eternal one,because, having come forth from the living aeons, being perfect and full because of the one who isperfect and full, it left full and perfect those who have given glory in a perfect way because of thefellowship. For, like the faultless Father, when he is glorified he also hears the glory whichglorifies him, so as to make them manifest as that which he is. The cause of the second honor which accrued to them is that which was returned to them from theFather when they had known the grace by which they bore fruit with one another because of theFather. As a result, just as they <were> brought forth in glory for the Father, so too in order toappear perfect, they appeared acting by giving glory. They were fathers of the third glory according to the independence and the power which wasbegotten with them, since each one of them individually does not exist so as to give glory in aunitary way to him whom he loves. They are the first and the second and thus both of them are perfect and full, for they aremanifestations of the Father who is perfect and full, as well as of those who came forth, who areperfect by the fact that they glorify the perfect one. The fruit of the third, however, consists ofhonors of the will of each one of the aeons, and each one of the properties. The Father has power.It exists fully, perfect in the thought which is a product of agreement, since it is a product of theindividuality of the aeons. It is this which he loves and over which he has power, as it gives gloryto the Father by means of it. For this reason, they are minds of minds, which are found to be words of words, elders of elders,degrees of degrees, which are exalted above one another. Each one of those who give glory has hisplace and his exaltation and his dwelling and his rest, which consists of the glory which he bringsforth. All those who glorify the Father have their begetting eternally, - they beget in the act of assistingone another - since the emanations are limitless and immeasurable and since there is no envy onthe part of the Father toward those who came forth from him in regard to their begettingsomething equal or similar to him, since he is the one who exists in the Totalities, begetting andrevealing himself. Whomever he wishes, he makes into a father, of whom he in fact is Father, anda god, of whom he in fact is God, and he makes them the Totalities, whose entirety he is. In theproper sense all the names which are great are kept there, these (names) which the angels share,who have come into being in the cosmos along with the archons, although they do not have anyresemblance to the eternal beings. The entire system of the aeons has a love and a longing for the perfect, complete discovery of theFather and this is their unimpeded agreement. Though the Father reveals himself eternally, he didnot wish that they should know him, since he grants that he be conceived of in such a way as to besought for, while keeping to himself his unsearchable primordial being. It is he, the Father, who gave root impulses to the aeons, since they are places on the path whichleads toward him, as toward a school of behavior. He has extended to them faith in and prayer tohim whom they do not see; and a firm hope in him of whom they do not conceive; and a fruitfullove, which looks toward that which it does not see; and an acceptable understanding of theeternal mind; and a blessing, which is riches and freedom; and a wisdom of the one who desiresthe glory of the Father for <his> thought. It is by virtue of his will that the Father, the one who is exalted, is known, that is, (by virtue of) thespirit which breathes in the Totalities and it gives them an idea of seeking after the unknown one,just as one is drawn by a pleasant aroma to search for the thing from which the aroma arises, sincethe aroma of the Father surpasses these ordinary ones. For his sweetness leaves the aeons inineffable pleasure and it gives them their idea of mingling with him who wants them to know himin a united way and to assist one another in the spirit which is sown within them. Though existingunder a great weight, they are renewed in an inexpressible way, since it is impossible for them tobe separated from that in which they are set in an uncomprehending way, because they will notspeak, being silent about the Father's glory, about the one who has power to speak, and yet theywill take form from him. He revealed himself, though it is impossible to speak of him. They have- 45 -"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"him, hidden in a thought, since from this one [...]. They are silent about the way the Father is in hisform and his nature and his greatness, while the aeons have become worthy of knowing throughhis spirit that he is unnameable and incomprehensible. It is through his spirit, which is the trace ofthe search for him, that he provides them the ability to conceive of him and to speak about him. Each one of the aeons is a name, <that is>, each of the properties and powers of the Father, sincehe exists in many names, which are intermingled and harmonious with one another. It is possibleto speak of him because of the wealth of speech, just as the Father is a single name, because he is aunity, yet is innumerable in his properties and names. The emanation of the Totalities, which exist from the one who exists, did not occur according to aseparation from one another, as something cast off from the one who begets them. Rather, theirbegetting is like a process of extension, as the Father extends himself to those whom he loves, sothat those who have come forth from him might become him as well. Just as the present aeon, though a unity, is divided by units of time and units of time are dividedinto years and years are divided into seasons and seasons into months, and months into days, anddays into hours, and hours into moments, so too the aeon of the Truth, since it is a unity andmultiplicity, receives honor in the small and the great names according to the power of each tograsp it - by way of analogy - like a spring which is what it is, yet flows into streams and lakes andcanals and branches, or like a root spread out beneath trees and branches with its fruit, or like ahuman body, which is partitioned in an indivisible way into members of members, primarymembers and secondary, great and small. 6. The Imperfect Begetting by the Logos The aeons have brought themselves forth in accord with the third fruit by the freedom of the willand by the wisdom with which he favored them for their thought. They do not wish to give honorwith that which is from an agreement, though it was produced for words of praise for each of thePleromas. Nor do they wish to give honor with the Totality. Nor do they wish (to do so) withanyone else who was originally above the depth of that one, or (above) his place, except, however,for the one who exists in an exalted name and in the exalted place, and only if he receives from theone who wished (to give honor), and takes it to him(self) for the one above him, and (only if) hebegets him(self), so to speak, himself, and, through that one, begets him(self) along with thatwhich he is, and himself becomes renewed along with the one who came upon him, by hisbrother, and sees him and entreats him about the matter, namely, he who wished to ascend tohim. So that it might be in this way, the one who wished to give honor does not say anything to himabout this, except only that there is a limit to speech set in the Pleroma, so that they are silentabout the incomprehensibility of the Father, but they speak about the one who wishes tocomprehend him. It came to one of the aeons that he should attempt to grasp theincomprehensibility and give glory to it and especially to the ineffability of the Father. Since he isa Logos of the unity, he is one, though he is not from the agreement of the Totalities, nor from himwho brought them forth, namely, the one who brought forth the Totality, the Father. This aeon was among those to whom was given wisdom, so that he could become pre-existent ineach one's thought. By that which he wills, will they be produced. Therefore, he received a wisenature in order to examine the hidden basis, since he is a wise fruit; for, the free will which wasbegotten with the Totalities was a cause for this one, such as to make him do what he desired,with no one to restrain him. The intent, then, of the Logos, who is this one, was good. When he had come forth, he gave gloryto the Father, even if it led to something beyond possibility, since he had wanted to bring forthone who is perfect, from an agreement in which he had not been, and without having thecommand. This aeon was last to have <been> brought forth by mutual assistance, and he was small inmagnitude. And before he begot anything else for the glory of the will and in agreement with theTotalities, he acted, magnanimously, from an abundant love, and set out toward that which- 46 -"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"surrounds the perfect glory, for it was not without the will of the Father that the Logos wasproduced, which is to say, not without it will he go forth. But he, the Father, had brought himforth for those about whom he knew that it was fitting that they should come into being. The Father and the Totalities drew away from him, so that the limit which the Father had setmight be established - for it is not from grasping the incomprehensibility but by the will of theFather, - and furthermore, (they withdrew) so that the things which have come to be mightbecome an organization which would come into being. If it were to come, it would not come intobeing by the manifestation of the Pleroma. Therefore, it is not fitting to criticize the movementwhich is the Logos, but it is fitting that we should say about the movement of the Logos that it is acause of an organization which has been destined to come about. The Logos himself caused it to happen, being complete and unitary, for the glory of the Father,whom he desired, and (he did so) being content with it, but those whom he wished to take hold offirmly he begot in shadows and copies and likenesses. For, he was not able to bear the sight of thelight, but he looked into the depth and he doubted. Out of this there was a division - he becamedeeply troubled - and a turning away because of his self-doubt and division, forgetfulness andignorance of himself and <of that> which is. His self-exaltation and his expectation of comprehending the incomprehensible became firm forhim and was in him. But the sicknesses followed him when he went beyond himself, having comeinto being from self-doubt, namely from the fact that he did not <reach the attainment of> theglories of the Father, the one whose exalted status is among things unlimited. This one did notattain him, for he did not receive him. The one whom he himself brought forth as a unitary aeon rushed up to that which is his and thiskin of his in the Pleroma abandoned him who came to be in the defect along with those who hadcome forth from him in an imaginary way, since they are not his. When he who produced himself as perfect actually did bring himself forth, he became weak like afemale nature which has abandoned its virile counterpart. From that which was deficient in itself there came those things which came into being from histhought and his arrogance, but from that which is perfect in him he left it and raised himself up tothose who are his. He was in the Pleroma as a remembrance for him so that he would be savedfrom his arrogance. The one who ran on high and the one who drew him to himself were not barren, but in bringingforth a fruit in the Pleroma, they upset those who were in the defect. Like the Pleromas are the things which came into being from the arrogant thought, which are their(the Pleromas') likenesses, copies, shadows, and phantasms, lacking reason and the light, thesewhich belong to the vain thought, since they are not products of anything. Therefore, their endwill be like their beginning: from that which did not exist (they are) to return once again to thatwhich will not be. It is they, however, by themselves who are greater, more powerful, and morehonored than the names which are given to them, which are their shadows. In the manner of areflection are they beautiful. For the face of the copy normally takes its beauty from that of whichit is a copy. They thought of themselves that they are beings existing by themselves and are without a source,since they do not see anything else existing before them. Therefore, they lived in disobedience andacts of rebellion, without having humbled themselves before the one because of whom they cameinto being. They wanted to command one another, overcoming one another in their vain ambition, while theglory which they possess contains a cause of the system which was to be. They are likenesses of the things which are exalted. They were brought to a lust for power in eachone of them, according to the greatness of the name of which each is a shadow, each oneimagining that it is superior to his fellows. The thought of these others was not barren, but just like <those> of which they are shadows, allthat they thought about they have as potential sons; those of whom they thought they had as- 47 -"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"offspring. Therefore, it happened that many offspring came forth from them, as fighters, aswarriors, as troublemakers, as apostates. They are disobedient beings, lovers of power. All theother beings of this sort were brought forth from these. 7. The Conversion of the Logos The Logos was a cause of those who came into being and he continued all the more to be at a lossand he was astonished. Instead of perfection, he saw a defect; instead of unification, he sawdivision; instead of stability, he saw disturbances; instead of rests, tumults. Neither was it possiblefor him to make them cease from loving disturbance, nor was it possible for him to destroy it. Hewas completely powerless, once his totality and his exaltation abandoned him. Those who had come into being not knowing themselves both did not know the Pleromas fromwhich they came forth and did not know the one who was the cause of their existence. The Logos, being in such unstable conditions, did not continue to bring forth anything likeemanations, the things which are in the Pleroma, the glories which exist for the honor of theFather. Rather, he brought forth little weaklings, hindered) by the illnesses by which he too washindered. It was the likeness of the disposition which was a unity, that which was the cause of thethings which do not themselves exist from the first. Until the one who brought forth into the defect these things which were thus in need, until hejudged those who came into being because of him contrary to reason - which is the judgmentwhich became a condemnation - he struggled against them unto destruction, that is, the ones whostruggled against the condemnation and whom the wrath pursues, while it (the wrath) acceptsand redeems (them) from their (false) opinion and apostasy, since from it is the conversion whichis also called \"metanoia.\" The Logos turned to another opinion and another thought. Havingturned away from evil, he turned toward the good things. Following the conversion came thethought of the things which exist and the prayer for the one who converted himself to the good. The one who is in the Pleroma was what he first prayed to and remembered; then (heremembered) his brothers individually and (yet) always with one another; then all of themtogether; but before all of them, the Father. The prayer of the agreement was a help for him in hisown return and (in that of) the Totality, for a cause of his remembering those who have existedfrom the first was his being remembered. This is the thought which calls out from afar, bringinghim back. All his prayer and remembering were numerous powers according to that limit. For there isnothing barren in his thought. The powers were good and were greater than those of the likeness. For those belonging to thelikeness also belong to a nature of falsehood. From an illusion of similarity and a thought ofarrogance has come about that which they became. And they originate from the thought whichfirst knew them. To what do the former beings pertain? They are like forgetfulness and heavy sleep; being likethose who dream troubled dreams, to whom sleep comes while they - those who dream - areoppressed. The others are like some creatures of light for him, looking for the rising of the sun,since it happened that they saw in him dreams which are truly sweet. It immediately put a stop tothe emanations of the thought. They did not any longer have their substance and also they did nothave honor any longer. Though he is not equal to those who pre-existed, if they were superior to the likenesses, it was healone through whom they were more exalted than those, for they are not from a good intent. It was not from the sickness which came into being that they were produced, from which is thegood intent, but (from) the one who sought after the pre-existent. Once he had prayed, he bothraised himself to the good and sowed in them a pre-disposition to seek and pray to the gloriouspre-existent one, and he sowed in them a thought about him and an idea, so that they shouldthink that something greater than themselves exists prior to them, although they did not- 48 -"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"understand what it was. Begetting harmony and mutual love through that thought, they acted inunity and unanimity, since from unity and from unanimity they have received their very being. They were stronger than them in the lust for power, for they were more honored than the firstones, who had been raised above them. Those had not humbled themselves. They thought aboutthemselves that they were beings originating from themselves alone and were without a source.As they brought forth at first according to their own birth, the two orders assaulted one another,fighting for command because of their manner of being. As a result, they were submerged inforces and natures in accord with the condition of mutual assault, having lust for power and allother things of this sort. It is from these that the vain love of glory draws all of them to the desireof the lust for power, while none of them has the exalted thought nor acknowledges it. The powers of this thought are prepared in the works of the pre-existent <ones>, those of whichthey are the representations. For the order of those of this sort had mutual harmony, but it foughtagainst the order of those of the likeness, while the order of those of the likeness wages waragainst the representations and acts against it alone, because of its wrath. From this it [...] them [...]one another, many [...] necessity appointed them [...] and might prevail [...] was not a multitude,[...] and their envy and their [...] and their wrath and violence and desire and prevailing ignoranceproduce empty matters and powers of various sorts, mixed in great number with one another;while the mind of the Logos, who was a cause of their begetting, was open to a revelation of thehope which would come to him from above. 8. The Emanation of the Savior The Logos which moved had the hope and the expectation of him who is exalted. As for those ofthe shadow, he separated himself from them in every way, since they fight against him and arenot at all humble before him. He was content with the beings of the thought. And as for the onewho is set up in this way and who is within the exalted boundary, remembering the one who isdefective, the Logos brought him forth in an invisible way, among those who came into beingaccording to the thought, according to the one who was with them, until the light shone upon himfrom above as a lifegiver, the one who was begotten by the thought of brotherly love of the pre-existent Pleromas. The stumbling, which happened to the aeons of the Father of the Totalities who did not suffer, wasbrought to them, as if it were their own, in a careful and non-malicious and immensely sweet way.It was brought to the Totalities so that they might be instructed about the defect by the single one,from whom alone they all received strength to eliminate the defects. The order which was his came into being from him who ran on high and that which brought itselfforth from him and from the entire perfection. The one who ran on high became for the one whowas defective an intercessor with the emanation of the aeons which had come into being in accordwith the things which exist. When he prayed to them, they consented joyously and willingly, sincethey were in agreement, and with harmonious consent, to aid the defective one. They gatheredtogether, asking the Father with beneficent intent that there be aid from above, from the Father,for his glory, since the defective one could not become perfect in any other way, unless it was thewill of the Pleroma of the Father, which he had drawn to himself, revealed, and given to thedefective one. Then from the harmony, in a joyous willingness which had come into being, theybrought forth the fruit, which was a begetting from the harmony, a unity, a possession of theTotalities, revealing the countenance of the Father, of whom the aeons thought as they gave gloryand prayed for help for their brother with a wish in which the Father counted himself with them.Thus, it was willingly and gladly that they bring forth the fruit. And he made manifest theagreement of the revelation of his union with them, which is his beloved Son. But the Son inwhom the Totalities are pleased put himself on them as a garment, through which he gaveperfection to the defective one, and gave confirmation to those who are perfect, the one who isproperly called \"Savior\" and \"the Redeemer\" and \"the Well-Pleasing one\" and \"the Beloved,\" \"theone to whom prayers have been offered\" and \"the Christ\" and \"the Light of those appointed,\" inaccordance with the ones from whom he was brought forth, since he has become the names of the- 49 -"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"positions which were given to him. Yet, what other name may be applied to him except \"the Son,\"as we previously said, since he is the knowledge of the Father, whom he wanted them to know? Not only did the aeons generate the countenance of the Father to whom they gave praise, whichwas written previously, but also they generated their own; for the aeons who give glory generatedtheir countenance and their face. They were produced as an army for him, as for a king, since thebeings of the thought have a powerful fellowship and an intermingled harmony. They came forthin a multifaceted form, in order that the one to whom help was to be given might see those towhom he had prayed for help. He also sees the one who gave it to him. The fruit of the agreement with him, of which we previously spoke, is subject to the power of theTotalities. For the Father has set the Totalities within him, both the ones which pre-exist and theones which are, and the ones which will be. He was capable (of doing it). He revealed those whichhe had placed within him. He did not give them, when he entrusted them to him. He directed theorganization of the universe according to the authority which was given him from the first and(according to) the power of the task. Thus, he began and effected his revelation. The one in whom the Father is and the one in whom the Totalities are <was> created before theone who lacked sight. He instructed him about those who searched for their sight, by means of theshining of that perfect light. He first perfected him in ineffable joy. He perfected him for himself asa perfect one and he also gave him what is appropriate to each individual. For this is thedetermination of the first joy. And <he> sowed in him in an invisible way a word which isdestined to be knowledge. And he gave him power to separate and cast out from himself thosewho are disobedient to him. Thus, he made himself manifest to him. But to those who came intobeing because of him he revealed a form surpassing them. They acted in a hostile way toward oneanother. Suddenly he revealed himself to them, approaching them in the form of lightning. And inputting an end to the entanglement which they have with one another he stopped it by the suddenrevelation, which they were not informed about, did not expect, and did not know of. Because ofthis, they were afraid and fell down, since they were not able to bear the appearance of the lightwhich struck them. The one who appeared was an assault for the two orders. Just as the beings ofthought had been given the name \"little one,\" so they have a faint notion that they have the exaltedone, he exists before them, and they have sown within them an attitude of amazement at theexalted one who will become manifest. Therefore, they welcomed his revelation and theyworshipped him. They became convinced witnesses to <him>. They acknowledged the lightwhich had come into being as one stronger than those who fought against them. The beings of thelikeness, however, were exceedingly afraid, since they were not able to hear about him in thebeginning, that there is a vision of this sort. Therefore they fell down to the pit of ignorance whichis called \"the Outer Darkness,\" and \"Chaos\" and \"Hades\" and \"the Abyss.\" He set up what wasbeneath the order of the beings of thought, as it was stronger than they. They were worthy ofruling over the unspeakable darkness, since it is theirs and is the lot which was assigned to them.He granted them that they, too, should be of use for the organization which was to come, to whichhe had assigned them. There is a great difference between the revelation of the one who came into being to the one whowas defective and to those things which are to come into being because of him. For he revealedhimself to him within him, since he is with him, is a fellow sufferer with him, gives him rest littleby little, makes him grow, lifts him up, gives himself to him completely for enjoyment from avision. But to those who fall outside, he revealed himself quickly and in a striking way and hewithdrew to himself suddenly without having let them see him. 9. The Pleroma of the Logos When the Logos which was defective was illumined, his Pleroma began. He escaped those whohad disturbed him at first. He became unmixed with them. He stripped off that arrogant thought.He received mingling with the Rest, when those who had been disobedient to him at first bentdown and humbled themselves before him. And he rejoiced over the visitation of his brothers whohad visited him. He gave glory and praise to those who had become manifest as a help to him,while he gave thanks, because he had escaped those who revolted against him, and admired and- 50 -"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"honored the greatness and those who had appeared to him in a determined way. He generatedmanifest images of the living visages, pleasing among things which are good, existing among thethings which exist, resembling them in beauty, but unequal to them in truth, since they are notfrom an agreement with him, between the one who brought them forth and the one who revealedhimself to him. But in wisdom and knowledge he acts, mingling the Logos with him(self) entirely.Therefore, those which came forth from him are great, just as that which is truly great. After he was amazed at the beauty of the ones who had appeared to him, he professed gratitudefor this visitation. The Logos performed this activity, through those from whom he had receivedaid, for the stability of those who had come into being because of him and so that they mightreceive something good, since he thought to pray for the organization of all those who came forthfrom him, which is stabilized, so that it might make them established. Therefore, those whom heintentionally produced are in chariots, just as those who came into being, those who haveappeared, so that they might pass through every place of things which are below, so that each onemight be given the place which is constituted as he is. This is destruction for the beings of thelikeness, yet is an act of beneficence for the beings of the thought, a revelation Dittography of thosewho are from the ordinance, which was a unity while suffering, while they are seeds, which havenot come to be by themselves. The one who appeared was a countenance of the Father and of the harmony. He was a garment(composed) of every grace, and food which is for those whom the Logos brought forth whilepraying and giving glory and honor. This is the one whom he glorified and honored while lookingto those to whom he prayed, so that he might perfect them through the images which he hadbrought forth. The Logos added even more to their mutual assistance and to the hope of the promise, since theyhave joy and abundant rest and undefiled pleasures. He generated those whom he remembered atfirst, when they were not with him, (he generated them) having the perfection. Dittography Now,while he who belongs to the vision is with him, he exists in hope and faith in the perfect Father, asmuch as the Totalities. He appears to him before he mingles with him, in order that the thingswhich have come into being might not perish by looking upon the light, for they cannot accept thegreat, exalted stature. The thought of the Logos, who had returned to his stability and ruled over those who had comeinto being because of him, was called \"Aeon\" and \"Place\" of all those whom he had brought forthin accord with the ordinance, and it is also called \"Synagogue of Salvation,\" because he healed him(self) from the dispersal, which is the multifarious thought, and returned to the single thought.Similarly, it is called \"Storehouse,\" because of the rest which he obtained, giving (it) to himselfalone. And it is also called \"Bride,\" because of the joy of the one who gave himself to him in thehope of fruit from the union, and who appeared to him. It is also called \"Kingdom,\" because of thestability which he received, while he rejoices at the domination over those who fought him. And itis called \"the Joy of the Lord,\" because of the gladness in which he clothed himself. With him is thelight, giving him recompense for the good things which are in him, and (with him is) the thoughtof freedom. The aeon of which we previously spoke is above the two orders of those who fight against oneanother. It is not a companion of those who hold dominion and is not implicated in the illnessesand weaknesses, things belonging to the thought and to the likeness. That in which the Logos set himself, perfect in joy, was an aeon, having the form of matter, butalso having the constitution of the cause, which is the one who revealed himself. (The aeon was)an image of those things which are in the Pleroma, those things which came into being from theabundance of the enjoyment of the one who exists joyously. Moreover, the countenance of the onewho revealed himself, was in the sincerity and the attentiveness and the promise concerning thethings for which he asked. It had the designation of the Son and his essence and his power and hisform, who is the one whom he loved and in whom he was pleased, who was entreated in a lovingway. It was light and was a desire to be established and an openness for instruction and an eye forvision, qualities which it had from the exalted ones. It was also wisdom for his thinking in- 51 -"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"opposition to the things beneath the organization. It was also a word for speaking and theperfection of the things of this sort. And it is these who took form with him, but according to theimage of the Pleroma, having their fathers who are the ones who gave them life, each one being acopy of each one of the faces, which are forms of maleness, since they are not from the illnesswhich is femaleness, but are from this one who already has left behind the sickness. It has thename \"the Church,\" for in harmony they resemble the harmony in the assembly of those who haverevealed themselves. That which came into being in the image of the light, it too is perfect, inasmuch as it is an image ofthe one existing light, which is the Totalities. Even if it was inferior to the one of whom it is animage, nevertheless it has its indivisibility, because it is a countenance of the indivisible light.Those, however, who came into being in the image of each one of the aeons, they in essence are inthe one whom we previously mentioned, but in power they are not equal, because it (the power) isin each of them. In this mingling with one another they have equality, but each one has not cast offwhat is peculiar to itself. Therefore, they are passions, for passion is sickness, since they areproductions not of the agreement of the Pleroma, but of this one, prematurely, before he receivedthe Father. Hence, the agreement with his Totality and will was something beneficial for theorganization which was to come. It was granted them to pass through the places which are below,since the places are unable to accommodate their sudden, hasty coming, unless (they come)individually, one by one. Their coming is necessary, since by them will everything be perfected. In short, the Logos received the vision of all things, those which pre-exist, and those which arenow, and those which will be, since he has been entrusted with the organization of all that whichexists. Some things are already in things which are fit for coming into being, but the seeds whichare to be he has within himself, because of the promise which belonged to that which heconceived, as something belonging to seeds which are to be. And he produced his offspring, thatis, the revelation of that which he conceived. For a while, however, the seed of promise is guarded,so that those who have been appointed for a mission might be appointed by the coming of theSavior and of those who are with him, the ones who are first in knowledge and glory of the Father.10. The Organization It is fitting, from the prayer which he made and the conversion which occurred because of it, thatsome should perish, while others benefit, and still others be set apart. He first prepared thepunishment of those who are disobedient, making use of a power of the one who appeared, theone from whom he received authority over all things, so as to be separate from him. He is the onewho is below, and he also keeps himself apart from that which is exalted, until he prepares theorganization of all those things which are external, and gives to each the place which is assignedto it. The Logos established him(self) at first, when he beautified the Totalities, as a basic principle andcause and ruler of the things which came to be, like the Father, the one who was the cause of theestablishment, which was the first to exist after him. He created the pre-existent images, which hebrought forth in thanks and glorification. Then he beautified the place of those whom he hadbrought forth in glory, which is called \"Paradise\" and \"the Enjoyment\" and \"the Joy full ofsustenance\" and \"the Joy,\" which pre-exist. And of every goodness which exists in the Pleroma, itpreserves the image. Then he beautified the kingdom, like a city filled with everything pleasing,which is brotherly love and the great generosity, which is filled with the holy spirits and themighty powers which govern them, which the Logos produced and established in power. Then(he beautified) the place of the Church which assembles in this place, having the form of theChurch which exists in the aeons, which glorifies the Father. After these (he beautified) the placeof the faith and obedience (which arises) from hope, which things the Logos received when thelight appeared; then (he beautified the place of) the disposition, which is prayer and supplication,which were followed by forgiveness and the word concerning the one who would appear. All the spiritual places are in spiritual power. They are separate from the beings of the thought,since the power is established in an image, which is that which separates the Pleroma from theLogos, while the power which is active in prophesying about the things which will be, directs the- 52 -"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"beings of the thought which have come into being toward that which is pre-existent, and it doesnot permit them to mix with the things which have come into being through a vision of the thingswhich are with him. The beings of the thought which is outside are humble; they preserve the representation of thepleromatic, especially because of the sharing in the names by which they are beautiful. The conversion is humble toward the beings of the thought, and the law, too, is humble towardthem, (the law) of the judgment, which is the condemnation and the wrath. Also humble towardthem is the power which separates those who fall below them, sends them far off and does notallow them to spread out over the beings of the thought and the conversion, which (power)consists in fear and perplexity and forgetfulness and astonishment and ignorance and the thingswhich have come into being in the manner of a likeness, through fantasy. And these things, too,which were in fact lowly, are given the exalted names. There is no knowledge for those who havecome forth from them with arrogance and lust for power and disobedience and falsehood. To each one he gave a name, since the two orders are in a name. Those belonging to the thoughtand those of the representation are called \"the Right Ones\" and \"Psychic\" and \"the Fiery Ones\" and\"the Middle Ones.\" Those who belong to the arrogant thought and those of the likeness are called\"the Left\", \"Hylic\", \"the Dark Ones,\" and \"the Last.\" After the Logos established each one in his order, both the images and the representations and thelikenesses, he kept the aeon of the images pure from all those who fight against it, since it is aplace of joy. However, to those of the thought he revealed the thought which he had stripped fromhimself, desiring to draw them into a material union, for the sake of their system and dwellingplace, and in order that they might also bring forth an impulse for diminution from their attractionto evil, so that they might not any more rejoice in the glory of their environment and be dissolved,but might rather see their sickness in which they suffer, so that they might beget love andcontinuous searching after the one who is able to heal them of the inferiority. Also over those whobelong to the likeness, he set the word of beauty, so that he might bring them into a form. He alsoset over them the law of judgment. Again, he set over them the powers which the roots hadproduced in their lust for power. He appointed them as rulers over them, so that, either by thesupport of the word which is beautiful, or by the threat of the law, or by the power of lust forpower, the order might be preserved from those who have reduced it to evil, while the Logos ispleased with them, since they are useful for the organization. The Logos knows the agreement in the lust for power of the two orders. To these and to all theothers, he graciously granted their desire. He gave to each one the appropriate rank, and it wasordered that each one be a ruler over a place and an activity. He yields to the place of the one moreexalted than himself, in order to command the other places in an activity which is in the allottedactivity which falls to him to have control over because of his mode of being. As a result, there arecommanders and subordinates in positions of domination and subjection among the angels andarchangels, while the activities are of various types and are different. Each one of the archons withhis race and his perquisites to which his lot has claim, just as they appeared, each was on guard,since they have been entrusted with the organization and none lacks a command and none iswithout kingship from the end of the heavens to the end of the earth, even to the foundations ofthe earth, and to the places beneath the earth. There are kings, there are lords and those who givecommands, some for administering punishment, others for administering justice, still others forgiving rest and healing, others for teaching, others for guarding. Over all the archons he appointed an Archon with no one commanding him. He is the lord of allof them, that is, the countenance which the Logos brought forth in his thought as a representationof the Father of the Totalities. Therefore, he is adorned with every <name> which <is> arepresentation of him, since he is characterized by every property and glorious quality. For he toois called \"father\" and god\" and \"demiurge\" and \"king\" and \"judge\" and \"place\" and \"dwelling\" and\"law.\" The Logos uses him as a hand, to beautify and work on the things below, and he uses him as amouth, to say the things which will be prophesied. - 53 -"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The things which he has spoken he does. When he saw that they were great and good andwonderful, he was pleased and rejoiced, as if he himself in his own thought had been the one tosay them and do them, not knowing that the movement within him is from the spirit who moveshim in a determined way toward those things which he wants. In regard to the things which came into being from him, he spoke of them, and they came intobeing as a representation of the spiritual places which we mentioned previously in the discussionabout the images. Not only <did> he work, but also, as the one who is appointed as father of his organization, heengendered by himself and by the seeds, yet also by the spirit which is elect and which willdescend through him to the places which are below. Not only does he speak spiritual words of hisown, <but> in an invisible way, (he speaks) through the spirit which calls out and begets thingsgreater than his own essence. Since in his essence he is a \"god\" and \"father\" and all the rest of the honorific titles, he wasthinking that they were elements of his own essence. He established a rest for those who obeyhim, but for those who disobey him, he also established punishments. With him, too, there is aparadise and a kingdom and everything else which exists in the aeon which exists before him.They are more valuable than the imprints, because of the thought which is connected with them,which is like a shadow and a garment, so to speak, because he does not see in what way the thingswhich exist actually do exist. He established workers and servants, assisting in what he will do and what he will say, for inevery place where he worked he left his countenance in his beautiful name, effecting and speakingof the things which he thinks about. He established in his place images of the light which appeared and of those things which arespiritual, though they were of his own essence. For, thus they were honored in every place by him,being pure, from the countenance of the one who appointed them, and they were established:paradises and kingdoms and rests and promises and multitudes of servants of his will, andthough they are lords of dominions, they are set beneath the one who is lord, the one whoappointed them. After he listened to him in this way, properly, about the lights, which are the source and thesystem, he set them over the beauty of the things below. The invisible spirit moved him in thisway, so that he would wish to administer through his own servant, whom he too used, as a handand as a mouth and as if he were his face, (and his servant is) the things which he brings, orderand threat and fear, in order that those with whom he has done what is ignorant might despise theorder which was given for them to keep, since they are fettered in the bonds of the archons, whichare on them securely. The whole establishment of matter is divided into three. The strong powers which the spiritualLogos brought forth from fantasy and arrogance, he established in the first spiritual rank. Thenthose (powers) which these produced by their lust for power, he set in the middle area, since theyare powers of ambition, so that they might exercise dominion and give commands withcompulsion and force to the establishment which is beneath them. Those which came into beingthrough envy and jealousy, and all the other offspring from dispositions of this sort, he set in aservile order controlling the extremities, commanding all those which exist and all (the realm of)generation, from whom come rapidly destroying illnesses, who eagerly desire begetting, who aresomething in the place where they are from and to which they will return. And therefore, heappointed over them authoritative powers, acting continuously on matter, in order that theoffspring of those which exist might also exist continuously. For this is their glory. Part II11. The Creation of Material Humanity The matter which flows through its form (is) a cause by which the invisibility which existsthrough the powers [...] for them all, for [...], as they beget before them and destroy. - 54 -"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The thought which is set between those of the right and those of the left is a power of begetting.All those which the first ones will wish to make, so to speak, a projection of theirs, like a shadowcast from and following a body, those things which are the roots of the visible creations, namely,the entire preparation of the adornment of the images and representations and likenesses, havecome into being because of those who need education and teaching and formation, so that thesmallness might grow, little by little, as through a mirror image. For it was for this reason that hecreated mankind at the end, having first prepared and provided for him the things which he hadcreated for his sake. Like that of all else is the creation of mankind as well. The spiritual Logos moved him invisibly, ashe perfected him through the Demiurge and his angelic servants, who shared in the act offashioning in multitudes, when he took counsel with his archons. Like a shadow is earthly man, sothat he might be like those who are cut off from the Totalities. Also he is something prepared byall of them, those of the right and those of the left, since each one in the orders gives a form to the[...] in which it exists. The [...] which the Logos who was defective brought forth, who was in the sickness, did notresemble him, because he brought it forth forgetfully, ignorantly, and defectively, and in all theother weak ways, although the Logos gave the first form through the Demiurge out of ignorance,so that he would learn that the exalted one exists, and would know that he needs him. This iswhat the prophet called \"Living Spirit\" and \"Breath of the exalted aeons\" and \"the Invisible,\" andthis is the living soul which has given life to the power which was dead at first. For that which isdead is ignorance. It is fitting that we explain about the soul of the first human being, that it is from the spiritualLogos, while the creator thinks that it is his, since it is from him, as from a mouth through whichone breathes. The creator also sent down souls from his substance, since he, too, has a power ofprocreation, because he is something which has come into being from the representation of theFather. Also those of the left brought forth, as it were, men of their own, since they have thelikeness of <being>. The spiritual substance is a single thing and a single representation, and its weakness is thedetermination in many forms. As for the substance of the psychics, its determination is double,since it has the knowledge and the confession of the exalted one, and it is not inclined to evil,because of the inclination of the thought. As for the material substance, its way is different and inmany forms, and it was a weakness which existed in many types of inclination. The first human being is a mixed formation, and a mixed creation, and a deposit of those of theleft and those of the right, and a spiritual word whose attention is divided between each of thetwo substances from which he takes his being. Therefore, it is said that a paradise was planted forhim, so that he might eat of the food of three kinds of tree, since it is a garden of the threefoldorder, and since it is that which gives enjoyment. The noble elect substance which is in him was more exalted. It created and it did not wound them.Therefore they issued a command, making a threat and bringing upon him a great danger, whichis death. Only the enjoyment of the things which are evil did he allow him to taste, and from theother tree with the double (fruit) he did not allow him to eat, much less from the tree of life, sothat they would not acquire honor [...] them, and so that they would not be [...] by the evil powerwhich is called \"the serpent.\" And he is more cunning than all the evil powers. He led man astraythrough the determination of those things which belong to the thought and the desires. <He>made him transgress the command, so that he would die. And he was expelled from everyenjoyment of that place. This is the expulsion which was made for him, when he was expelled from the enjoyments of thethings which belong to the likeness and those of the representation. It was a work of providence,so that it might be found that it is a short time until man will receive the enjoyment of the thingswhich are eternally good, in which is the place of rest. This the spirit ordained when he firstplanned that man should experience the great evil, which is death, that is complete ignorance ofthe Totality, and that he should experience all the evils which come from this and, after the- 55 -"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"deprivations and cares which are in these, that he should receive of the greatest good, which is lifeeternal, that is, firm knowledge of the Totalities and the reception of all good things. Because ofthe transgression of the first man, death ruled. It was accustomed to slay every man in themanifestation of its domination, which had been given it as a kingdom because of the organizationof the Father's will, of which we spoke previously. Part III 12. The Variety of Theologies If both the orders, those on the right and those on the left, are brought together with one anotherby the thought which is set between them, which gives them their organization with each other, ithappens that they both act with the same emulation of their deeds, with those of the rightresembling those of the left, and those of the left resembling those of the right. And if at times theevil order begins to do evil in a foolish way, the <wise> order emulates, in the form of a man ofviolence, also doing what is evil, as if it were a power of a man of violence. At other times thefoolish order attempts to do good, making itself like it, since the hidden order, too, is zealous to doit. Just as it is in the things which are established, so (it is) in the things which have come to be.Since they bring things unlike one another, those who were not instructed were unable to knowthe cause of the things which exist. Therefore, they have introduced other types (of explanation),some saying that it is according to providence that the things which exist have their being. Theseare the people who observe the stability and the conformity of the movement of creation. Otherssay that it is something alien. These are people who observe the diversity and the lawlessness andthe evil of the powers. Others say that the things which exist are what is destined to happen.These are the people who were occupied with this matter. Others say that it is something inaccordance with nature. Others say that it is a self-existent. The majority, however, all who havereached as far as the visible elements, do not know anything more than them. Those who were wise among the Greeks and the barbarians have advanced to the powers whichhave come into being by way of imagination and vain thought. Those who have come from these,in accord with the mutual conflict and rebellious manner active in them, also spoke in a likely,arrogant and imaginary way concerning the things which they thought of as wisdom, althoughthe likeness deceived them, since they thought that they had attained the truth, when they had(only) attained error. (They did so) not simply in minor appellations, but the powers themselvesseem to hinder them, as if they were the Totality. Therefore, the order was caught up in fightingitself alone, because of the arrogant hostility of one of the offspring of the archon who is superior,who exists before him. Therefore, nothing was in agreement with its fellows, nothing, neitherphilosophy nor types of medicine nor types of rhetoric nor types of music nor types of logic, butthey are opinions and theories. Ineffability held sway in confusion, because of the indescribablequality of those who hold sway, who give them thoughts. Now, as for the things which came forth from the <race> of the Hebrews, things which are writtenby the hylics who speak in the fashion of the Greeks, the powers of those who think about all ofthem, so to speak, the \"right ones,\" the powers which move them all to think of words and arepresentation, they <brought> them, and they grasped so as to attain the truth and used theconfused powers which act in them. Afterwards they attained to the order of the unmixed ones,the one which is established, the unity which exists as a representation of the representation of theFather. It is not invisible in its nature, but a wisdom envelops it, so that it might preserve the formof the truly invisible one. Therefore, many angels have not been able to see it. Also, other men ofthe Hebrew race, of whom we already spoke, namely the righteous ones and the prophets, did notthink of anything and did not say anything from imagination or through a likeness or fromesoteric thinking, but each one by the power which was at work in him, and while listening to thethings which he saw and heard, spoke of them in [...]. They have a unified harmony with oneanother after the manner of those who worked in them, since they preserve the connection and themutual harmony primarily by the confession of the one more exalted than they. And there is onewho is greater than they, who was appointed since they have need of him, and whom the spiritual- 56 -"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Logos begot along with them as one who needs the exalted one, in hope and expectation in accordwith the thought which is the seed of salvation. And he is an illuminating word, which consists ofthe thought and his offspring and his emanations. Since the righteous ones and the prophets,whom we have previously mentioned, preserve the confession and the testimony concerning theone who is great, made by their fathers who were looking for the hope and the hearing, in them issown the seed of prayer and the searching, which is sown in many who have searched forstrengthening. It appears and draws them to love the exalted one, to proclaim these things aspertaining to a unity. And it was a unity which worked in them when they spoke. Their visionand their words do not differ because of the multitude of those who have given them the visionand the word. Therefore, those who have listened to what they have said concerning this do notreject any of it, but have accepted the scriptures in an altered way. By interpreting them, theyestablished many heresies which exist to the present among the Jews. Some say that God is one,who made a proclamation in the ancient scriptures. Others say that he is many. Some say that Godis simple and was a single mind in nature. Others say that his activity is linked with theestablishment of good and evil. Still others say that he is the creator of that which has come intobeing. Still others say that it was by the angels that he created. The multitude of ideas of this sort is the multitude of forms and the abundance of types ofscripture, that which produced their teachers of the Law. The prophets, however, did not sayanything of their own accord, but each one of them (spoke) of the things which he had seen andheard through the proclamation of the Savior. This is what he proclaimed, with the main subjectof their proclamation being that which each said concerning the coming of the Savior, which isthis coming. Sometimes the prophets speak about it as if it will be. Sometimes (it is) as if the Saviorspeaks from their mouths, saying that the Savior will come and show favor to those who have notknown him. They have not all joined with one another in confessing anything, but each one, onthe basis of the thing from which he received power to speak about him, and on the basis of theplace which he saw, thinks that it is from it that he will be begotten, and that he will come fromthat place. Not one of them knew whence he would come nor by whom he would be begotten, buthe alone is the one of whom it is worthy to speak, the one who will be begotten and will suffer.Concerning that which he previously was and that which he is eternally - an unbegotten,impassible one from the Logos, who came into being in flesh - he did not come into their thought.And this is the account which they received an impulse to give concerning his flesh which was toappear. They say that it is a production from all of them, but that before all things it is from thespiritual Logos, who is the cause of the things which have come into being, from whom the Saviorreceived his flesh. He had conceived <it> at the revelation of the light, according to the word ofthe promise, at his revelation from the seminal state. For the one who exists is not a seed of thethings which exist, since he was begotten at the end. But to the one by whom the Father ordainedthe manifestation of salvation, who is the fulfillment of the promise, to him belonged all theseinstruments for entry into life, through which he descended. His Father is one, and alone is truly afather to him, the invisible, unknowable, the incomprehensible in his nature, who alone is God inhis will and his form, who has granted that he might be seen, known, and comprehended. 13. The Incarnate Savior and his Companions He it is who was our Savior in willing compassion, who is that which they were. For it was fortheir sake that he became manifest in an involuntary suffering. They became flesh and soul, thatis, eternally which (things) hold them and with corruptible things they die. And as for those whocame into being, the invisible one taught them invisibly about himself. Not only did he take upon <himself> the death of those whom he thought to save, but he alsoaccepted their smallness to which they had descended when they were <born> in body and soul.(He did so) because he had let himself be conceived and born as an infant, in body and soul. Among all the others who shared in them, and those who fell and received the light, he came intobeing exalted, because he had let himself be conceived without sin, stain and defilement. He wasbegotten in life, being in life because the former and the latter are in passion and changing opinion- 57 -"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"from the Logos who moved, who established them to be body and soul. He it is <who> has takento himself the one who came from those whom we previously mentioned. He came into being from the glorious vision and the unchanging thought of the Logos whoreturned to himself, after his movement, from the organization, just as those who came with himtook body and soul and a confirmation and stability and judgment of things. They too intended tocome. When they thought of the Savior they came, and they came when he knew; they also came moreexalted in the emanation according to the flesh than those who had been brought forth from adefect, because in this way they, too, received their bodily emanation, along with the body of theSavior, through the revelation and the mingling with him. These others were those of onesubstance, and it indeed is the spiritual (substance). The organization is different. This is onething, that is another. Some come forth from passion and division, needing healing. Others arefrom prayer, so that they heal the sick, when they have been appointed to treat those who havefallen. These are the apostles and the evangelists. They are the disciples of the Savior, and teacherswho need instruction. Why, then, did they, too, share in the passions in which those who havebeen brought forth from passion share, if indeed they are bodily productions in accordance withthe organization and <the> Savior, who did not share in the passions? The Savior was an image of the unitary one, he who is the Totality in bodily form. Therefore, hepreserved the form of indivisibility, from which comes impassability. They, however, are imagesof each thing which became manifest. Therefore, they assume division from the pattern, havingtaken form for the planting which exists beneath the heaven. This also is what shares in the evilwhich exists in the places which they have reached. For the will held the Totality under sin, so thatby that will he might have mercy on the Totality and they might be saved, while a single one aloneis appointed to give life, and all the rest need salvation. Therefore, it was from (reasons) of thissort that it began to receive grace to give the honors which were proclaimed by Jesus, which weresuitable for him to proclaim to the rest, since a seed of the promise of Jesus Christ was set up,whom we have served in (his) revelation and union. Now the promise possessed the instructionand the return to what they are from the first, from which they possess the drop, so as to return tohim, which is that which is called \"the redemption.\" And it is the release from the captivity andthe acceptance of freedom. In its places, the captivity of those who were slaves of ignorance holdssway. The freedom is the knowledge of the truth which existed before the ignorance was ruling,forever without beginning and without end, being something good, and a salvation of things, anda release from the servile nature in which they have suffered. Those who have been brought forth in a lowly thought of vanity, that is, (a thought) which goes tothings which are evil through the thought which draws them down to the lust for power, thesehave received the possession which is freedom, from the abundance of the grace which lookedupon the children. It was, however, a disturbance of the passion and a destruction of those thingswhich he cast off from himself at first, when the Logos separated them from himself, (the Logos)who was the cause of their being destined for destruction, though he kept <them> at <the> end ofthe organization and allowed them to exist because even they were useful for the things whichwere ordained. 14. The Tripartition of Mankind Mankind came to be in three essential types, the spiritual, the psychic, and the material,conforming to the triple disposition of the Logos, from which were brought forth the material onesand the psychic ones and the spiritual ones. Each of the three essential types is known by its fruit.And they were not known at first but only at the coming of the Savior, who shone upon the saintsand revealed what each was. The spiritual race, being like light from light and like spirit from spirit, when its head appeared, itran toward him immediately. It immediately became a body of its head. It suddenly receivedknowledge in the revelation. The psychic race is like light from a fire, since it hesitated to acceptknowledge of him who appeared to it. (It hesitated) even more to run toward him in faith. Rather,- 58 -"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"through a voice it was instructed, and this was sufficient, since it is not far from the hopeaccording to the promise, since it received, so to speak as a pledge, the assurance of the thingswhich were to be. The material race, however, is alien in every way; since it is dark, it shuns theshining of the light, because its appearance destroys it. And since it has not received its unity, it issomething excessive and hateful toward the Lord at his revelation. The spiritual race will receive complete salvation in every way. The material will receivedestruction in every way, just as one who resists him. The psychic race, since it is in the middlewhen it is brought forth and also when it is created, is double according to its determination forboth good and evil. It takes its appointed departure suddenly and its complete escape to thosewho are good. Those whom the Logos brought forth in accordance with the first element of histhought, when he remembered the exalted one and prayed for salvation, have salvation suddenly.They will be saved completely because of the salvific thought. As he was brought forth, so, too,were these brought forth from him, whether angels or men. In accordance with the confession thatthere is one who is more exalted than themselves, and in accordance with the prayer and thesearch for him, they also will attain the salvation of those who have been brought forth, since theyare from the disposition which is good. They were appointed for service in proclaiming thecoming of the Savior who was to be and his revelation which had come. Whether angels or men,when he was sent as a service to them, they received, in fact, the essence of their being. Those,however, who are from the thought of lust for power, who have come into being from the blow ofthose who fight against him, those whom the thought brought forth, from these, since they aremixed, they will receive their end suddenly. Those who will be brought forth from the lust forpower which is given to them for a time and for certain periods, and who will give glory to theLord of glory, and who will relinquish their wrath, they will receive the reward for their humility,which is to remain forever. Those, however, who are proud because of the desire of ambition, andwho love temporary glory, and who forget that it was only for certain periods and times whichthey have that they were entrusted with power, and for this reason did not acknowledge that theSon of God is the Lord of all and Savior, and were not brought out of wrath and the resemblanceto the evil ones, they will receive judgment for their ignorance and their senselessness, which issuffering, along with those who went astray, anyone of them who turned away; and even more(for) wickedness in doing to the Lord things which were not fitting, which the powers of the leftdid to him, even including his death. They persevered saying, \"We shall become rulers of theuniverse, if the one who has been proclaimed king of the universe is slain,\" (they said this) whenthey labored to do this, namely the men and angels who are not from the good disposition of theright ones but from the mixture. And they first chose for themselves honor, though it was only atemporary wish and desire, while the path to eternal rest is by way of humility for salvation ofthose who will be saved, those of the right ones. After they confess the Lord and the thought ofthat which is pleasing to the church and the song of those who are humble along with her to thefull extent possible, in that which is pleasing to do for her, in sharing in her sufferings and herpains in the manner of those who understand what is good for the church, they will have a sharein her hope. This is to be said on the subject of how men and angels who are from the order of theleft have a path to error: not only did they deny the Lord and plot evil against him, but alsotoward the Church did they direct their hatred and envy and jealousy; and this is the reason forthe condemnation of those who have moved and have aroused themselves for the trials of theChurch. 15. The Process of Restoration The election shares body and essence with the Savior, since it is like a bridal chamber because ofits unity and its agreement with him. For, before every place, the Christ came for her sake. Thecalling, however, has the place of those who rejoice at the bridal chamber, and who are glad andhappy at the union of the bridegroom and the bride. The place which the calling will have is theaeon of the images, where the Logos has not yet joined with the Pleroma. And since the man of theChurch was happy and glad at this, as he was hoping for it, he separated spirit, soul, and body inthe organization of the one who thinks that he is a unity, though within him is the man who is the- 59 -"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Totality - and he is all of them. And, though he has the escape from the [...] which the places willreceive, he also has the members about which we spoke earlier. When the redemption wasproclaimed, the perfect man received knowledge immediately, so as to return in haste to hisunitary state, to the place from which he came, to return there joyfully, to the place from which hecame, to the place from which he flowed forth. His members, however, needed a place ofinstruction, which is in the places which are adorned, so that they might receive from themresemblance to the images and archetypes, like a mirror, until all the members of the body of theChurch are in a single place and receive the restoration at one time, when they have beenmanifested as the whole body, namely the restoration into the Pleroma. It has a preliminaryconcord with a mutual agreement, which is the concord which belongs to the Father, until theTotalities receive a countenance in accordance with him. The restoration is at the end, after theTotality reveals what it is, the Son, who is the redemption, that is, the path toward theincomprehensible Father, that is, the return to the pre-existent, and (after) the Totalities revealthemselves in that one, in the proper way, who is the inconceivable one and the ineffable one, andthe invisible one and the incomprehensible one, so that it receives redemption. It was not onlyrelease from the domination of the left ones, nor was it only escape from the power of those of theright, to each of which we thought that were slaves and sons, from whom none escapes withoutquickly becoming theirs again, but the redemption also is an ascent to the degrees which are in thePleroma and to those who have named themselves and who conceive of themselves according tothe power of each of the aeons, and (it is) an entrance into what is silent, where there is no needfor voice nor for knowing, nor for forming a concept, nor for illumination, but (where) all thingsare light, while they do not need to be illumined. Not only do humans need redemption, but also the angels, too, need redemption, along with theimage and the rest of the Pleromas of the aeons and the wondrous powers of illumination. So thatwe might not be in doubt in regard to the others, even the Son himself, who has the position ofredeemer of the Totality, needed redemption as well, - he who had become man, - since he gavehimself for each thing which we need, we in the flesh, who are his Church. Now, when he firstreceived redemption from the word which had descended upon him, all the rest receivedredemption from him, namely those who had taken him to themselves. For those who received theone who had received (redemption) also received what was in him. Among the men who are in the flesh redemption began to be given, his first-born, and his love,the Son who was incarnate, while the angels who are in heaven asked to associate, so that theymight form an association with him upon the earth. Therefore, he is called \"the Redemption of theangels of the Father,\" he who comforted those who were laboring under the Totality for hisknowledge, because he was given the grace before anyone else. The Father had foreknowledge of him, since he was in his thought before anything came intobeing, and since he had those to whom he has revealed him. He set the deficiency on the one whoremains for certain periods and times, as a glory for his Pleroma, since the fact that he is unknownis a cause of his production from his agreement [...] of him. Just as reception of knowledge of himis a manifestation of his lack of envy and the revelation of the abundance of his sweetness, whichis the second glory, so, too, he has been found to be a cause of ignorance, although he is also abegetter of knowledge. In a hidden and incomprehensible wisdom he kept the knowledge to the end, until the Totalitiesbecame weary while searching for God the Father, whom no one found through his own wisdomor power. He gives himself, so that they might receive knowledge of the abundant thought abouthis great glory, which he has given, and (about) the cause, which he has given, which is hisunceasing thanksgiving, he who, from the immobility of his counsel, reveals himself eternally tothose who have been worthy of the Father, who is unknown in his nature, so that they mightreceive knowledge of him, through his desire that they should come to experience the ignoranceand its pains. Those of whom he first thought that they should attain knowledge and the good things which arein it, they were planning - which is the wisdom of the Father, - that they might experience the evilthings and might train themselves in them, as a [...] for a time, so that they might receive the- 60 -"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"enjoyment of good things for eternity. They hold change and persistent renunciation and the causeof those who fight against them as an adornment and marvelous quality of those who are exalted,so that it is manifest that the ignorance of those who will be ignorant of the Father was somethingof their own. He who gave them knowledge of him was one of his powers for enabling them tograsp that knowledge in the fullest sense is called \"the knowledge of all that which is thought of\"and \"the treasure\" and \"the addition for the increase of knowledge,\" \"the revelation of those thingswhich were known at first,\" and \"the path toward harmony and toward the pre-existent one,\"which is the increase of those who have abandoned the greatness which was theirs in theorganization of the will, so that the end might be like the beginning. As for the baptism which exists in the fullest sense, into which the Totalities will descend and inwhich they will be, there is no other baptism apart from this one alone, which is the redemptioninto God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, when confession is made through faith in those names,which are a single name of the gospel, when they have come to believe what has been said tothem, namely that they exist. From this they have their salvation, those who have believed thatthey exist. This is attaining in an invisible way to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in anundoubting faith. And when they have borne witness to them, it is also with a firm hope that theyattained them, so that the return to them might become the perfection of those who have believedin them and (so that) the Father might be one with them, the Father, the God, whom they haveconfessed in faith and who gave (them) their union with him in knowledge. The baptism which we previously mentioned is called \"garment of those who do not stripthemselves of it,\" for those who will put it on and those who have received redemption wear it. Itis also called \"the confirmation of the truth which has no fall.\" In an unwavering and immovableway it grasps those who have received the restoration while they grasp it. (Baptism) is called\"silence\" because of the quiet and the tranquility. It is also called \"bridal chamber\" because of theagreement and the indivisible state of those who know they have known him. It is also called \"thelight which does not set and is without flame,\" since it does not give light, but those who haveworn it are made into light. They are the ones whom he wore. (Baptism) is also called \"the eternallife,\" which is immortality; and it is called \"that which is, entirely, simply, in the proper sense,what is pleasing, inseparably and irremovably and faultlessly and imperturbably, for the one whoexists for those who have received a beginning.\" For, what else is there to name it apart from\"God,\" since it is the Totalities, that is, even if it is given numberless names, they are spokensimply as a reference to it. Just as he transcends every word, and he transcends every voice, andhe transcends every mind, and he transcends everything, and he transcends every silence, so it isDittography with those who are that which he is. This is that which they find it to be, ineffably andinconceivably in (its) visage, for the coming into being in those who know, through him whomthey have comprehended, who is the one to whom they gave glory. 16. Redemption of the Calling Even if on the matter of the election there are many more things for us to say, as it is fitting to say,nonetheless, on the matter of those of the calling - for those of the right are so named - it isnecessary for us to return once again to them, and it is not profitable for us to forget them. Wehave spoken about them, - If there is enough in what preceded at some length, how have wespoken? In a partial way, - since I said about all those who came forth from the Logos, either fromthe judgment of the evil ones or from the wrath which fights against them and the turning awayfrom them, which is the return to the exalted ones, or from the prayer and the remembrance ofthose who pre-existed, or from hope and faith that they would receive their salvation from goodwork, since they have been deemed worthy because they are beings from the good dispositions,(that) they have cause of their begetting which is an opinion from the one who exists. Still further(I said) that before the Logos concerned himself with them in an invisible way, willingly, theexalted one added to this thought, because they were in need of him, who was the cause of theirbeing. They did not exalt themselves when they were saved, as if there were nothing existingbefore them, but they confess that they have a beginning to their existence, and they desire this: to- 61 -"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"know him who exists before them. Most of all (I said) that they worshipped the revelation of thelight in the form of lightning, and they bore witness that it appeared as <their> salvation. Not only those who have come forth from the Logos, about whom alone we said that they wouldaccomplish the good work, but also those whom these brought forth according to the gooddispositions will share in the repose according to the abundance of the grace. Also those who havebeen brought forth from the desire of lust for power, having the seed in them which is the lust forpower, will receive the reward for (their) good deeds, namely those who acted and those whohave the predisposition toward the good, if they intentionally desire and wish to abandon thevain, temporal ambition, and they keep the commandment of the Lord of glory, instead of themomentary honor, and inherit the eternal kingdom. Now, it is necessary that we unite the causes and the effects on them of the grace and theimpulses, since it is fitting that we say what we mentioned previously about the salvation of allthose of the right, of all those unmixed and those mixed, to join them with one another. And as forthe repose, which is the revelation of the form <in> which they believed, (it is necessary) that weshould treat it with a suitable discussion. For when we confessed the kingdom which is in Christ,<we> escaped from the whole multiplicity of forms, and from inequality and change. For the endwill receive a unitary existence, just as the beginning is unitary, where there is no male nor female,nor slave and free, nor circumcision and uncircumcision, neither angel nor man, but Christ is all inall. What is the form of the one who did not exist at first? It will be found that he will exist. Andwhat is the nature of the one who was a slave? He will take a place with a free man. For they willreceive the vision more and more by nature and not only by a little word, so as to believe, onlythrough a voice, that this is the way it is, that the restoration to that which used to be is a unity.Even if some are exalted because of the organization, since they have been appointed as causes ofthe things which have come into being, since they are more active as natural forces, and since theyare desired because of these things, angels and men will receive the kingdom and the confirmationand the salvation. These, then, are the causes. About the <one> who appeared in flesh, they believed without any doubt that he is the Son of theunknown God, who was not previously spoken of, and who could not be seen. They abandonedtheir gods whom they had previously worshipped, and the lords who are in heaven and on earth.Before he had taken them up, and while he was still a child, they testified that he had alreadybegun to preach. And when he was in the tomb as a dead man the angels thought that he wasalive, receiving life from the one who had died. They first desired their numerous services andwonders, which were in the temple on their behalf, to be performed continuously <as> theconfession. That is, it can be done on their behalf through their approach to him. That preparation which they did not accept, they rejected, because of the one who had not beensent from that place, but they granted to Christ, of whom they thought that he exists in that placefrom which they had come along with him, a place of gods and lords whom they served,worshipped, and ministered to, in the names which they had received on loan. - They were givento the one who is designated by them properly. - However, after his assumption, they had theexperience to know that he is their Lord, over whom no one else is lord. They gave him theirkingdoms; they rose from their thrones; they were kept from their crowns. He, however, revealedhimself to them, for the reasons which we have already spoken of: their salvation and the return toa good thought until [...] companion and the angels [...], and the abundance of good which theydid with it.

Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.The teaching of the savior, and the revelation of the mysteries and the things hidden in silence,even these things which he taught John, his disciple. And it happened one day, when John, the brother of James - who are the sons of Zebedee - hadcome up to the temple, that a Pharisee named Arimanius approached him and said to him, \"Whereis your master whom you followed?\" And he said to him, \"He has gone to the place from which hecame.\" The Pharisee said to him, \"With deception did this Nazarene deceive you (pl.), and he filledyour ears with lies, and closed your hearts (and) turned you from the traditions of your fathers.\" When I, John, heard these things I turned away from the temple to a desert place. And I grievedgreatly in my heart, saying, \"How then was the savior appointed, and why was he sent into theworld by his Father, and who is his Father who sent him, and of what sort is that aeon to whichwe shall go? For what did he mean when he said to us, 'This aeon to which you will go is of thetype of the imperishable aeon, but he did not teach us concerning the latter, of what sort it is.\" Straightway, while I was contemplating these things, behold, the heavens opened and the wholecreation which is below heaven shone, and the world was shaken. I was afraid, and behold I sawin the light a youth who stood by me. While I looked at him, he became like an old man. And hechanged his likeness (again), becoming like a servant. There was not a plurality before me, butthere was a likeness with multiple forms in the light, and the likenesses appeared through eachother, and the likeness had three forms. He said to me, \"John, John, why do you doubt, or why are you afraid? You are not unfamiliar withthis image, are you? - that is, do not be timid! - I am the one who is with you (pl.) always. I am theFather, I am the Mother, I am the Son. I am the undefiled and incorruptible one. Now I have cometo teach you what is and what was and what will come to pass, that you may know the thingswhich are not revealed and those which are revealed, and to teach you concerning the unwaveringrace of the perfect Man. Now, therefore, lift up your face, that you may receive the things that Ishall teach you today, and may tell them to your fellow spirits who are from the unwavering raceof the perfect Man.\"And I asked to know it, and he said to me, \"The Monad is a monarchy with nothing above it. It ishe who exists as God and Father of everything, the invisible One who is above everything, whoexists as incorruption, which is in the pure light into which no eye can look.\"He is the invisible Spirit, of whom it is not right to think of him as a god, or something similar.For he is more than a god, since there is nothing above him, for no one lords it over him. For hedoes not exist in something inferior to him, since everything exists in him. For it is he whoestablishes himself. He is eternal, since he does not need anything. For he is total perfection. Hedid not lack anything, that he might be completed by it; rather he is always completely perfect inlight. He is illimitable, since there is no one prior to him to set limits to him. He is unsearchable,since there exists no one prior to him to examine him. He is immeasurable, since there was no oneprior to him to measure him. He is invisible, since no one saw him. He is eternal, since he existseternally. He is ineffable, since no one was able to comprehend him to speak about him. He isunnameable, since there is no one prior to him to give him a name. \"He is immeasurable light, which is pure, holy (and) immaculate. He is ineffable, being perfect inincorruptibility.

There is no way tosay, 'What is his quantity?' or, 'What is his quality?', for no one can know him. He is not someoneamong (other) beings, rather he is far superior. Not that he is (simply) superior, but his essencedoes not partake in the aeons nor in time. For he who partakes in an aeon was prepared- 64 -"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"beforehand. Time was not apportioned to him, since he does not receive anything from another,for it would be received on loan. For he who precedes someone does not lack, that he may receivefrom him. For rather, it is the latter that looks expectantly at him in his light. \"For the perfection is majestic. He is pure, immeasurable mind. He is an aeon-giving aeon. He islife-giving life. He is a blessedness-giving blessed one. He is knowledge-giving knowledge. He isgoodness-giving goodness. He is mercy and redemption-giving mercy. He is grace-giving grace,not because he possesses it, but because he gives the immeasurable, incomprehensible light. \"How am I to speak with you about him? His aeon is indestructible, at rest and existing in silence,reposing (and) being prior to everything. For he is the head of all the aeons, and it is he who givesthem strength in his goodness. For we know not the ineffable things, and we do not understandwhat is immeasurable, except for him who came forth from him, namely (from) the Father. For itis he who told it to us alone. For it is he who looks at himself in his light which surrounds him,namely the spring of the water of life. And it is he who gives to all the aeons and in every way,(and) who gazes upon his image which he sees in the spring of the Spirit. It is he who puts hisdesire in his water-light which is in the spring of the pure light-water which surrounds him. \"And his thought performed a deed and she came forth, namely she who had appeared before himin the shine of his light.

And when he had consented, the foreknowledge came forth, and itstood by the forethought; it originates from the thought of the invisible, virginal Spirit. It glorifiedhim and his perfect power, Barbelo, for it was for her sake that it had come into being. \"And she requested again to grant her indestructibility, and he consented.

He came forth through the forethought. And the invisible, virginalSpirit placed the divine Autogenes of truth over everything. And he subjected to him everyauthority, and the truth which is in him, that he may know the All which had been called with aname exalted above every name.

And the second light (is) Oriel, whohas been placed over the second aeon. And there are three other aeons with him: conception,perception, and memory. And the third light is Daveithai, who has been placed over the thirdaeon. And there are three other aeons with him: understanding, love, and idea. And the fourthaeon was placed over the fourth light Eleleth. And there are three other aeons with him:perfection, peace, and wisdom. These are the four lights which attend the divine Autogenes, (and)these are the twelve aeons which attend the son of the mighty one, the Autogenes, the Christ,through the will and the gift of the invisible Spirit. And the twelve aeons belong to the son of theAutogenes. And all things were established by the will of the holy Spirit through the Autogenes. \"And from the foreknowledge of the perfect mind, through the revelation of the will of theinvisible Spirit and the will of the Autogenes, <the> perfect Man (appeared), the first revelation,and the truth. It is he whom the virginal Spirit called Pigera-Adamas, and he placed him over thefirst aeon with the mighty one, the Autogenes, the Christ, by the first light Armozel; and with himare his powers. And the invisible one gave him a spiritual, invincible power. And he spoke andglorified and praised the invisible Spirit, saying, 'It is for thy sake that everything has come intobeing and everything will return to thee. I shall praise and glorify thee and the Autogenes and theaeons, the three: the Father, the Mother, and the Son, the perfect power.' \"And he placed his son Seth over the second aeon in the presence of the second light Oriel. And inthe third aeon the seed of Seth was placed over the third light Daveithai. And the souls of thesaints were placed (there). And in the fourth aeon the souls were placed of those who do not knowthe Pleroma and who did not repent at once, but who persisted for a while and repentedafterwards; they are by the fourth light Eleleth. These are creatures which glorify the invisibleSpirit. \"And the Sophia of the Epinoia, being an aeon, conceived a thought from herself and theconception of the invisible Spirit and foreknowledge. She wanted to bring forth a likeness out ofherself without the consent of the Spirit, - he had not approved - and without her consort, andwithout his consideration. And though the person of her maleness had not approved, and she hadnot found her agreement, and she had thought without the consent of the Spirit and theknowledge of her agreement, (yet) she brought forth. And because of the invincible power whichis in her, her thought did not remain idle, and something came out of her which was imperfectand different from her appearance, because she had created it without her consort.

And shesurrounded it with a luminous cloud, and she placed a throne in the middle of the cloud that noone might see it except the holy Spirit who is called the mother of the living. And she called hisname Yaltabaoth. \"This is the first archon who took a great power from his mother. And he removed himself fromher and moved away from the places in which he was born. He became strong and created forhimself other aeons with a flame of luminous fire which (still) exists now. And he joined with hisarrogance which is in him and begot authorities for himself. The name of the first one is Athoth,whom the generations call the reaper. The second one is Harmas, who is the eye of envy. The thirdone is Kalila-Oumbri. The fourth one is Yabel.

And he placed seven kings - eachcorresponding to the firmaments of heaven - over the seven heavens, and five over the depth ofthe abyss, that they may reign. And he shared his fire with them, but he did not send forth fromthe power of the light which he had taken from his mother, for he is ignorant darkness. \"And when the light had mixed with the darkness, it caused the darkness to shine. And when thedarkness had mixed with the light, it darkened the light and it became neither light nor dark, butit became dim. \"Now the archon who is weak has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth, the second is Saklas,and the third is Samael. And he is impious in his arrogance which is in him. For he said, 'I am Godand there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which hehad come. \"And the archons created seven powers for themselves, and the powers created for themselves sixangels for each one until they became 365 angels. And these are the bodies belonging with thenames: the first is Athoth, a he has a sheep's face; the second is Eloaiou, he has a donkey's face; thethird is Astaphaios, he has a hyena's face; the fourth is Yao, he has a serpent's face with sevenheads; the fifth is Sabaoth, he has a dragon's face; the sixth is Adonin, he had a monkey's face; theseventh is Sabbede, he has a shining fire-face. This is the sevenness of the week. \"But Yaltabaoth had a multitude of faces, more than all of them, so that he could put a face beforeall of them, according to his desire, when he is in the midst of seraphs. He shared his fire withthem; therefore he became lord over them. Because of the power of the glory he possessed of hismother's light, he called himself God. And he did not obey the place from which he came. And heunited the seven powers in his thought with the authorities which were with him. And when hespoke it happened. And he named each power beginning with the highest: the first is goodnesswith the first (authority), Athoth; the second is foreknowledge with the second one, Eloaio; andthe third is divinity with the third one, Astraphaio); the fourth is lordship with the fourth one,Yao; the fifth is kingdom with the fifth one, Sabaoth; the sixth is envy with the sixth one, Adonein;the seventh is understanding with the seventh one, Sabbateon. And these have a firmamentcorresponding to each aeon-heaven. They were given names according to the glory which belongsto heaven for the destruction of the powers. And in the names which were given to them by theirOriginator there was power. But the names which were given them according to the glory whichbelongs to heaven mean for them destruction and powerlessness. Thus they have two names. \"And having created [...] everything, he organized according to the model of the first aeons whichhad come into being, so that he might create them like the indestructible ones. Not because he hadseen the indestructible ones, but the power in him, which he had taken from his mother, producedin him the likeness of the cosmos. And when he saw the creation which surrounds him, and themultitude of the angels around him which had come forth from him, he said to them, 'I am ajealous God, and there is no other God beside me.'

No, but when she had seen the wickedness which hadhappened, and the theft which her son had committed, she repented. And she was overcome byforgetfulness in the darkness of ignorance and she began to be ashamed. And she did not dare toreturn, but she was moving about. And the moving is the going to and fro. \"And the arrogant one took a power from his mother. For he was ignorant, thinking that thereexisted no other except his mother alone. And when he saw the multitude of the angels which hehad created, then he exalted himself above them. \"And when the mother recognized that the garment of darkness was imperfect, then she knewthat her consort had not agreed with her. She repented with much weeping. And the wholepleroma heard the prayer of her repentance, and they praised on her behalf the invisible, virginalSpirit. And he consented; and when the invisible Spirit had consented, the holy Spirit poured overher from their whole pleroma. For it was not her consort who came to her, but he came to herthrough the pleroma in order that he might correct her deficiency. And she was taken up not toher own aeon but above her son, that she might be in the ninth until she has corrected herdeficiency. \"And a voice came forth from the exalted aeon-heaven: 'The Man exists and the son of Man.' Andthe chief archon, Yaltabaoth, heard (it) and thought that the voice had come from his mother. Andhe did not know from where it came. And he taught them, the holy and perfect Mother-Father, thecomplete foreknowledge, the image of the invisible one who is the Father of the all (and) throughwhom everything came into being, the first Man. For he revealed his likeness in a human form. \"And the whole aeon of the chief archon trembled, and the foundations of the abyss shook. And ofthe waters which are above matter, the underside was illuminated by the appearance of his imagewhich had been revealed. And when all the authorities and the chief archon looked, they saw thewhole region of the underside which was illuminated. And through the light they saw the form ofthe image in the water. \"And he said to the authorities which attend him, 'Come, let us create a man according to theimage of God and according to our likeness, that his image may become a light for us.' And theycreated by means of their respective powers in correspondence with the characteristics whichwere given. And each authority supplied a characteristic in the form of the image which he hadseen in its natural (form). He created a being according to the likeness of the first, perfect Man.And they said, 'Let us call him Adam, that his name may become a power of light for us.' \"And the powers began: the first one, goodness, created a bone-soul; and the second,foreknowledge, created a sinew-soul; the third, divinity, created a flesh-soul; and the fourth, thelordship, created a marrow-soul; the fifth, kingdom created a blood-soul; the sixth, envy, created askin-soul; the seventh, understanding, created a hair-soul.

And again I ranup to my root of light, lest they be destroyed before the time. \"Still for a third time I went - I am the light which exists in the light, I am the remembrance of thePronoia - that I might enter into the midst of darkness and the inside of Hades. And I filled myface with the light of the completion of their aeon. And I entered into the midst of their prison,which is the prison of the body. And I said, 'He who hears, let him get up from the deep sleep.'And he wept and shed tears. Bitter tears he wiped from himself and he said, 'Who is it that callsmy name, and from where has this hope come to me, while I am in the chains of the prison?' And Isaid, 'I am the Pronoia of the pure light; I am the thinking of the virginal Spirit, who raised you upto the honored place. Arise and remember that it is you who hearkened, and follow your root,which is I, the merciful one, and guard yourself against the angels of poverty and the demons ofchaos and all those who ensnare you, and beware of the deep sleep and the enclosure of the insideof Hades. \"And I raised him up, and sealed him in the light of the water with five seals, in order that deathmight not have power over him from this time on. \"And behold, now I shall go up to the perfect aeon. I have completed everything for you in yourhearing. And I have said everything to you that you might write them down and give themsecretly to your fellow spirits, for this is the mystery of the immovable race.\" And the savior presented these things to him that he might write them down and keep themsecure. And he said to him, \"Cursed be everyone who will exchange these things for a gift or forfood or for drink or for clothing or for any other such thing.\" And these things were presented tohim in a mystery, and immediately he disappeared from him.

The winter is the world, the summer the other Aeon(eternal realm). Let us sow in the world that we may reap in the summer. Because of this, it isfitting for us not to pray in the winter. Summer follows winter. But if any man reap in winter hewill not actually reap but only pluck out, since it will not provide a harvest for such a person. It isnot only [...] that it will [...] come forth, but also on the Sabbath [...] is barren.Christ came to ransom some, to save others, to redeem others. He ransomed those who werestrangers and made them his own. And he set his own apart, those whom he gave as a pledgeaccording to his plan. It was not only when he appeared that he voluntarily laid down his life, buthe voluntarily laid down his life from the very day the world came into being. Then he came firstin order to take it, since it had been given as a pledge. It fell into the hands of robbers and wastaken captive, but he saved it. He redeemed the good people in the world as well as the evil. Light and Darkness, life and death, right and left, are brothers of one another. They areinseparable. Because of this neither are the good good, nor evil evil, nor is life life, nor death death.For this reason each one will dissolve into its earliest origin. But those who are exalted above theworld are indissoluble, eternal. Names given to the worldly are very deceptive, for they divert our thoughts from what is correctto what is incorrect. Thus one who hears the word \"God\" does not perceive what is correct, butperceives what is incorrect. So also with \"the Father\" and \"the Son\" and \"the Holy Spirit\" and \"life\"and \"light\" and \"resurrection\" and \"the Church (Ekklesia)\" and all the rest - people do not perceivewhat is correct but they perceive what is incorrect, unless they have come to know what is correct.The names which are heard are in the world [...] deceive. If they were in the Aeon (eternal realm),they would at no time be used as names in the world. Nor were they set among worldly things.They have an end in the Aeon. One single name is not uttered in the world, the name which the Father gave to the Son; it is thename above all things: the name of the Father. For the Son would not become Father unless hewore the name of the Father. Those who have this name know it, but they do not speak it. Butthose who do not have it do not know it. But truth brought names into existence in the world for our sakes, because it is not possible tolearn it (truth) without these names. Truth is one single thing; it is many things and for our sakesto teach about this one thing in love through many things. The rulers (archons) wanted to deceiveman, since they saw that he had a kinship with those that are truly good. They took the name of- 102 -"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"those that are good and gave it to those that are not good, so that through the names they mightdeceive him and bind them to those that are not good. And afterward, what a favor they do forthem! They make them be removed from those that are not good and place them among those thatare good. These things they knew, for they wanted to take the free man and make him a slave tothem forever. These are powers which [...] man, not wishing him to be saved, in order that they may [...]. For ifman is saved, there will not be any sacrifices [...] and animals will not be offered to the powers.Indeed, the animals were the ones to whom they sacrificed. They were indeed offering them upalive, but when they offered them up, they died. As for man, they offered him up to God dead,and he lived. Before Christ came, there was no bread in the world, just as Paradise, the place were Adam was,had many trees to nourish the animals but no wheat to sustain man. Man used to feed like theanimals, but when Christ came, the perfect man, he brought bread from heaven in order that manmight be nourished with the food of man. The rulers thought that it was by their own power andwill that they were doing what they did, but the Holy Spirit in secret was accomplishingeverything through them as it wished. Truth, which existed since the beginning, is sowneverywhere. And many see it being sown, but few are they who see it being reaped. Some said, \"Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit.\" They are in error. They do not know what theyare saying. When did a woman ever conceive by a woman? Mary is the virgin whom no powerdefiled. She is a great anathema to the Hebrews, who are the apostles and the apostolic men. Thisvirgin whom no power defiled [...] the powers defile themselves. And the Lord would not havesaid \"My Father who is in Heaven\" (Mt 16:17), unless he had had another father, but he wouldhave said simply \"My father\". The Lord said to the disciples, \"[...] from every house. Bring into the house of the Father. But donot take (anything) in the house of the Father nor carry it off.\" \"Jesus\" is a hidden name, \"Christ\" is a revealed name. For this reason \"Jesus\" is not particular toany language; rather he is always called by the name \"Jesus\". While as for \"Christ\", in Syriac it is\"Messiah\", in Greek it is \"Christ\". Certainly all the others have it according to their own language.\"The Nazarene\" is he who reveals what is hidden. Christ has everything in himself, whether man,or angel, or mystery, and the Father. Those who say that the Lord died first and (then) rose up are in error, for he rose up first and(then) died. If one does not first attain the resurrection, he will not die. As God lives, he would [...].No one will hide a large valuable object in something large, but many a time one has tossedcountless thousands into a thing worth a penny. Compare the soul. It is a precious thing and itcame to be in a contemptible body. Some are afraid lest they rise naked. Because of this they wish to rise in the flesh, and they do notknow that it is those who wear the flesh who are naked. It is those who [...] to unclothe themselveswho are not naked. \"Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God\" (1 Co 15:50). What isthis which will not inherit? This which is on us. But what is this, too, which will inherit? It is thatwhich belongs to Jesus and his blood. Because of this he said \"He who shall not eat my flesh anddrink my blood has not life in him\" (Jn 6:53). What is it? His flesh is the word, and his blood is theHoly Spirit. He who has received these has food and he has drink and clothing. I find fault withthe others who say that it will not rise. Then both of them are at fault. You say that the flesh willnot rise. But tell me what will rise, that we may honor you. You say the Spirit in the flesh, and it isalso this light in the flesh. (But) this too is a matter which is in the flesh, for whatever you shallsay, you say nothing outside the flesh. It is necessary to rise in this flesh, since everything exists init. In this world, those who put on garments are better than the garments. In the Kingdom ofHeaven, the garments are better than those that put them on. It is through water and fire that the whole place is purified - the visible by the visible, the hiddenby the hidden. There are some things hidden through those visible. There is water in water, thereis fire in chrism. - 103 -"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Jesus took them all by stealth, for he did not appear as he was, but in the manner in which theywould be able to see him. He appeared to them all. He appeared to the great as great. He appearedto the small as small. He appeared to the angels as an angel, and to men as a man. Because of this,his word hid itself from everyone. Some indeed saw him, thinking that they were seeingthemselves, but when he appeared to his disciples in glory on the mount, he was not small. Hebecame great, but he made the disciples great, that they might be able to see him in his greatness. He said on that day in the thanksgiving, \"You who have joined the perfect light with the HolySpirit, unite the angels with us also, as being the images.\" Do not despise the lamb, for without it,it is not possible to see the king. No one will be able to go in to the king if he is naked. The heavenly man has many more sons than the earthly man. If the sons of Adam are many,although they die, how much more the sons of the perfect man, they who do not die but arealways begotten. The father makes a son, and the son has not the power to make a son. For he whohas been begotten has not the power to beget, but the son gets brothers for himself, not sons. Allwho are begotten in the world are begotten in a natural way, and the others are nourished fromthe place whence they have been born. It is from being promised to the heavenly place that manreceives nourishment. [...] him from the mouth. And had the word gone out from that place, itwould be nourished from the mouth and it would become perfect. For it is by a kiss that theperfect conceive and give birth. For this reason we also kiss one another. We receive conceptionfrom the grace which is in one another. There were three who always walked with the Lord: Mary, his mother, and her sister, andMagdalene, the one who was called his companion. His sister and his mother and his companionwere each a Mary. \"The Father\" and \"the Son\" are single names; \"the Holy Spirit\" is a double name. For they areeverywhere: they are above, they are below; they are in the concealed, they are in the revealed.The Holy Spirit is in the revealed: it is below. It is in the concealed: it is above. The saints are served by evil powers, for they are blinded by the Holy Spirit into thinking thatthey are serving an (ordinary) man whenever they do so for the saints. Because of this, a discipleasked the Lord one day for something of this world. He said to him, \"Ask your mother, and shewill give you of the things which are another's.\" The apostles said to the disciples, \"May our entire offering obtain salt.\" They called Sophia \"salt\".Without it, no offering is acceptable. But Sophia is barren, without child. For this reason, she iscalled \"a trace of salt\". Wherever they will [...] in their own way, the Holy Spirit [...], and herchildren are many. What the father possesses belongs to the son, and the son himself, so long as he is small, is notentrusted with what is his. But when he becomes a man, his father gives him all that he possesses. Those who have gone astray, whom the spirit begets, usually go astray also because of the Spirit.Thus, by one and the same breath, the fire blazes and is put out. Echamoth is one thing and Echmoth, another. Echamoth is Wisdom simply, but Echmoth is theWisdom of death, which is the one who knows death, which is called \"the little Wisdom\". There are domestic animals, like the bull and the ass and others of this kind. Others are wild andlive apart in the deserts. Man ploughs the field by means of the domestic animals, and from thishe is nourished, he and the animals, whether tame or wild. Compare the perfect man. It is throughpowers which are submissive that he ploughs, preparing for everything to come into being. For itis because of this that the whole place stands, whether the good or the evil, the right and the left.The Holy Spirit shepherds everyone and rules all the powers, the \"tame\" ones and the \"wild\" ones,as well as those which are unique. For indeed he [...] shuts them in, in order that [...] wish, theywill not be able to escape. He who has been created is beautiful, but you would <not> find his sons noble creations. If hewere not created, but begotten, you would find that his seed was noble. But now he was created(and) he begot. What nobility is this? First, adultery came into being, afterward murder. And hewas begotten in adultery, for he was the child of the Serpent. So he became a murderer, just like- 104 -"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"his father, and he killed his brother. Indeed, every act of sexual intercourse which has occurredbetween those unlike one another is adultery. God is a dyer. As the good dyes, which are called \"true\", dissolve with the things dyed in them, soit is with those whom God has dyed. Since his dyes are immortal, they become immortal by meansof his colors. Now God dips what he dips in water. It is not possible for anyone to see anything of the things that actually exist unless he becomes likethem. This is not the way with man in the world: he sees the sun without being a sun; and he seesthe heaven and the earth and all other things, but he is not these things. This is quite in keepingwith the truth. But you saw something of that place, and you became those things. You saw theSpirit, you became spirit. You saw Christ, you became Christ. You saw the Father, you shallbecome Father. So in this place you see everything and do not see yourself, but in that place youdo see yourself - and what you see you shall become. Faith receives, love gives. No one will be able to receive without faith. No one will be able to givewithout love. Because of this, in order that we may indeed receive, we believe, and in order thatwe may love, we give, since if one gives without love, he has no profit from what he has given. Hewho has received something other than the Lord is still a Hebrew. The apostles who were before us had these names for him: \"Jesus, the Nazorean, Messiah\", that is,\"Jesus, the Nazorean, the Christ\". The last name is \"Christ\", the first is \"Jesus\", that in the middle is\"the Nazarene\". \"Messiah\" has two meanings, both \"the Christ\" and \"the measured\". \"Jesus\" inHebrew is \"the redemption\". \"Nazara\" is \"the Truth\". \"The Nazarene\" then, is \"the Truth\". \"Christ\"[...] has been measured. \"The Nazarene\" and \"Jesus\" are they who have been measured. When the pearl is cast down into the mud, it becomes greatly despised, nor if it is anointed withbalsam oil will it become more precious. But it always has value in the eyes of its owner. Comparethe Sons of God: wherever they may be, they still have value in the eyes of their Father. If you say, \"I am a Jew,\" no one will be moved. If you say, \"I am a Roman,\" no one will bedisturbed. If you say, \"I am a Greek, a barbarian, a slave, a free man,\" no one will be troubled.

For this reason, men are sacrificed to him. Before men were sacrificed, animalswere being sacrificed, since those to whom they were sacrificed were not gods. Glass decanters and earthenware jugs are both made by means of fire. But if glass decanters break,they are done over, for they came into being through a breath. If earthenware jugs break, however,they are destroyed, for they came into being without breath. An ass which turns a millstone did a hundred miles walking. When it was loosed, it found that itwas still at the same place. There are men who make many journeys, but make no progresstowards any destination. When evening came upon them, they saw neither city nor village,neither human artifact nor natural phenomenon, power nor angel. In vain have the wretcheslabored. The eucharist is Jesus. For he is called in Syriac \"Pharisatha,\" which is \"the one who is spread out,\"for Jesus came to crucify the world. The Lord went into the dye works of Levi. He took seventy-two different colors and threw theminto the vat. He took them out all white. And he said, \"Even so has the Son of Man come as adyer.\" As for the Wisdom who is called \"the barren,\" she is the mother of the angels. And the companionof the [...] Mary Magdalene.

When the wanton women see a male sittingalone, they leap down on him and play with him and defile him. So also the lecherous men, whenthey see a beautiful woman sitting alone, they persuade her and compel her, wishing to defile her.But if they see the man and his wife sitting beside one another, the female cannot come into theman, nor can the male come into the woman. So if the image and the angel are united with oneanother, neither can any venture to go into the man or the woman.

Its good things are not good, and its evilthings not evil. But there is evil after this world which is truly evil - what is called \"the middle\". Itis death. While we are in this world, it is fitting for us to acquire the resurrection, so that when westrip off the flesh, we may be found in rest and not walk in the middle. For many go astray on theway.

Truth did not come into the world naked, but it came in types and images. The world will notreceive truth in any other way. There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth. It is certainly necessaryto be born again through the image. Which one? Resurrection. The image must rise again throughthe image. The bridal chamber and the image must enter through the image into the truth: this isthe restoration.

This power the apostles called \"the right and the left.\" For this person is no longer aChristian but a Christ.

[...] he said, \"I came to make the things below like the things above, and thethings outside like those inside. I came to unite them in the place.\" [...] here through types [...]andimages. Those who say, \"There is a heavenly man and there is one above him\" are wrong. For it is the firstof these two heavenly men, the one who is revealed, that they call \"the one who is below\"; and heto whom the hidden belongs is that one who is above him. For it would be better for them to say,\"The inner and outer, and what is outside the outer\". Because of this, the Lord called destructionthe \"the outer darkness\": there is not another outside of it. He said, \"My Father who is in secret\".He said, \"Go into your chamber and shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father who is insecret\" (Mt 6:6), the one who is within them all. But that which is within them all is the fullness.Beyond it, there is nothing else within it. This is that of which they say, \"That which is abovethem\". Before Christ, some came from a place they were no longer able to enter, and they went wherethey were no longer able to come out. Then Christ came. Those who went in, he brought out, andthose who went out, he brought in. When Eve was still with Adam, death did not exist. When she was separated from him, deathcame into being. If he enters again and attains his former self, death will be no more. \"My God, my God, why, O Lord, have you forsaken me?\" (Mk 15:34). It was on the cross that hesaid these words, for he had departed from that place. [...] who has been begotten through him who [...] from God. The [...] from the dead.

A bridal chamber is not for the animals, nor is it for the slaves, nor for defiled women; but it is forfree men and virgins. Through the Holy Spirit we are indeed begotten again, but we are begotten through Christ in thetwo. We are anointed through the Spirit. When we were begotten, we were united. None can seehimself either in water or in a mirror without light. Nor again can you see in light without mirroror water. For this reason, it is fitting to baptize in the two, in the light and the water. Now the lightis the chrism. There were three buildings specifically for sacrifice in Jerusalem. The one facing the west wascalled \"The Holy\". Another, facing south, was called \"The Holy of the Holy\". The third, facing east,was called \"The Holy of the Holies\", the place where only the high priest enters. Baptism is \"theHoly\" building. Redemption is the \"Holy of the Holy\". \"The Holy of the Holies\" is the bridalchamber. Baptism includes the resurrection and the redemption; the redemption (takes place) inthe bridal chamber. But the bridal chamber is in that which is superior to [...] you will not find [...]are those who pray [...] Jerusalem who [...] Jerusalem, [...] those called the \"Holy of the Holies\" [...]the veil was rent, [...] bridal chamber except the image [...] above. Because of this, its veil was rentfrom top to bottom. For it was fitting for some from below to go upward. The powers do not see those who are clothed in the perfect light, and consequently are not able todetain them. One will clothe himself in this light sacramentally in the union. If the woman had not separated from the man, she should not die with the man. His separationbecame the beginning of death. Because of this, Christ came to repair the separation, which wasfrom the beginning, and again unite the two, and to give life to those who died as a result of theseparation, and unite them. But the woman is united to her husband in the bridal chamber.Indeed, those who have united in the bridal chamber will no longer be separated.

He appeared in the great bridal chamber. Thereforehis body came into being on that very day. It left the bridal chamber as one who came into beingfrom the bridegroom and the bride. So Jesus established everything in it through these. It is fittingfor each of the disciples to enter into his rest. Adam came into being from two virgins, from the Spirit and from the virgin earth. Christtherefore, was born from a virgin to rectify the Fall which occurred in the beginning. There are two trees growing in Paradise. The one bears animals, the other bears men.

Among his accomplishments are his children. They originate in amoment of ease. Thus his abilities determine what he may accomplish, but this ease is clearlyevident in the children. You will find that this applies directly to the image. Here is the man madeafter the image accomplishing things with his physical strength, but producing his children withease. In this world, the slaves serve the free. In the Kingdom of Heaven, the free will minister to theslaves: the children of the bridal chamber will minister to the children of the marriage.

For he said, \"Thus we should fulfill all righteousness.\" (Mt 3:15) Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive theresurrection while they live, when they die they will receive nothing. So also when speaking aboutbaptism they say, \"Baptism is a great thing,\" because if people receive it they will live. Philip the apostle said, \"Joseph the carpenter planted a garden because he needed wood for histrade. It was he who made the cross from the trees which he planted. His own offspring hung onthat which he planted. His offspring was Jesus, and the planting was the cross.\" But the Tree ofLife is in the middle of the Garden. However, it is from the olive tree that we got the chrism, andfrom the chrism, the resurrection. This world is a corpse-eater. All the things eaten in it themselves die also. Truth is a life-eater.Therefore no one nourished by truth will die. It was from that place that Jesus came and broughtfood. To those who so desired, he gave life, that they might not die.

And it is because of the chrism that \"theChrist\" has his name. For the Father anointed the Son, and the Son anointed the apostles, and theapostles anointed us. He who has been anointed possesses everything. He possesses theresurrection, the light, the cross, the Holy Spirit. The Father gave him this in the bridal chamber;he merely accepted (the gift). The Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. This is theKingdom of Heaven. The Lord said it well: \"Some have entered the Kingdom of Heaven laughing, and they have comeout [...] because [...] a Christian, [...]. And as soon as [...] went down into the water, he came [...]everything (of this world), [...] because he [...] a trifle, but [...] full of contempt for this [...] theKingdom of Heaven [...] If he despises [...], and scorns it as a trifle, [...] out laughing.

For he who created it wanted to create it imperishableand immortal. He fell short of attaining his desire. For the world never was imperishable, nor, forthat matter, was he who made the world. For things are not imperishable, but sons are. Nothingwill be able to receive imperishability if it does not first become a son. But he who has not theability to receive, how much more will he be unable to give? The cup of prayer contains wine and water, since it is appointed as the type of the blood for whichthanks is given. And it is full of the Holy Spirit, and it belongs to the wholly perfect man. Whenwe drink this, we shall receive for ourselves the perfect man. The living water is a body. It isnecessary that we put on the living man. Therefore, when he is about to go down into the water,he unclothes himself, in order that he may put on the living man.

There are other names, however; they are superior to every other namethat is named and are stronger than the strong. For where there is a show of strength, there thosewho excel in strength appear. These are not separate things, but both of them are this one singlething. This is the one which will not be able to rise above the heart of flesh. Is it not necessary for all those who possess everything to know themselves? Some indeed, if theydo not know themselves, will not enjoy what they possess. But those who have come to knowthemselves will enjoy their possessions. Not only will they be unable to detain the perfect man, but they will not be able to see him, for ifthey see him, they will detain him. There is no other way for a person to acquire this qualityexcept by putting on the perfect light and he too becoming perfect light. He who has put it on willenter [...]. This is the perfect [...] that we [...] become [...] before we leave [...]. Whoever receiveseverything [...] hither [...] be able [...] that place, but will [...] the Middle as imperfect. Only Jesusknows the end of this person. The priest is completely holy, down to his very body. For if he has taken the bread, he willconsecrate it. Or the cup or anything else that he gets, he will consecrate. Then how will he notconsecrate the body also? By perfecting the water of baptism, Jesus emptied it of death. Thus we do go down into the water,but we do not go down into death, in order that we may not be poured out into the spirit of theworld. When that spirit blows, it brings the winter. When the Holy Spirit breathes, the summercomes. He who has knowledge of the truth is a free man, but the free man does not sin, for \"He who sinsis the slave of sin\" (Jn 8:34). Truth is the mother, knowledge the father. Those who think that- 109 -"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"sinning does not apply to them are called \"free\" by the world. Knowledge of the truth merelymakes such people arrogant, which is what the words, \"it makes them free\" mean. It even givesthem a sense of superiority over the whole world. But \"Love builds up\" (1 Co 8:1). In fact, he whois really free, through knowledge, is a slave, because of love for those who have not yet been ableto attain to the freedom of knowledge. Knowledge makes them capable of becoming free. Lovenever calls something its own, [...] it [...] possess [...]. It never says,\"This is yours\" or \"This is mine,\"but \"All these are yours\". Spiritual love is wine and fragrance. All those who anoint themselveswith it take pleasure in it. While those who are anointed are present, those nearby also profit (fromthe fragrance). If those anointed with ointment withdraw from them and leave, then those notanointed, who merely stand nearby, still remain in their bad odor. The Samaritan gave nothingbut wine and oil to the wounded man. It is nothing other than the ointment. It healed the wounds,for \"love covers a multitude of sins\" (1 P 4:8). The children a woman bears resemble the man who loves her. If her husband loves her, then theyresemble her husband. If it is an adulterer, then they resemble the adulterer. Frequently, if awoman sleeps with her husband out of necessity, while her heart is with the adulterer with whimshe usually has intercourse, the child she will bear is born resembling the adulterer. Now you wholive together with the Son of God, love not the world, but love the Lord, in order that those youwill bring forth may not resemble the world, but may resemble the Lord. The human being has intercourse with the human being. The horse has intercourse with the horse,the ass with the ass. Members of a race usually have associated with those of like race. So spiritmingles with spirit, and thought consorts with thought, and light shares with light. If you are borna human being, it is the human being who will love you. If you become a spirit, it is the spiritwhich will be joined to you. If you become thought, it is thought which will mingle with you. Ifyou become light, it is the light which will share with you. If you become one of those who belongabove, it is those who belong above who will rest upon you. If you become horse or ass or bull ordog or sheep, or another of the animals which are outside or below, then neither human being norspirit nor thought nor light will be able to love you. Neither those who belong above nor thosewho belong within will be able to rest in you, and you have no part in them. He who is a slave against his will, will be able to become free. He who has become free by favor ofhis master, and has sold himself into slavery, will no longer be able to be free. Farming in the world requires the cooperation of four essential elements. A harvest is gatheredinto the barn only as a result of the natural action of water, earth, wind and light. God's farminglikewise has four elements - faith, hope, love, and knowledge. Faith is our earth, that in which wetake root. And hope is the water through which we are nourished. Love is the wind throughwhich we grow. Knowledge, then, is the light through which we ripen. Grace exists in four ways:it is earthborn; it is heavenly; [...] the highest heaven; [...] in [...]. Blessed is the one who on no occasion caused a soul [...]. That person is Jesus Christ. He came tothe whole place and did not burden anyone. Therefore, blessed is the one who is like this, becausehe is a perfect man. For the Word tells us that this kind is difficult to define. How shall we be ableto accomplish such a great thing? How will he give everyone comfort? Above all, it is not properto cause anyone distress - whether the person is great or small, unbeliever or believer - and thengive comfort only to those who take satisfaction in good deeds. Some find it advantageous to givecomfort to the one who has fared well. He who does good deeds cannot give comfort to suchpeople, for he does not seize whatever he likes. He is unable to cause distress, however, since hedoes not afflict them. To be sure, the one who fares well sometimes causes people distress - notthat he intends to do so; rather, it is their own wickedness which is responsible for their distress.He who possesses the qualities (of the perfect man) bestows joy upon the good. Some, however,are terribly distressed by all this. There was a householder who had every conceivable thing, be it son or slave or cattle or dog orpig or corn or barley or chaff or grass or [...] or meat and acorn. Now he was a sensible fellow, andhe knew what the food of each one was. He served the children bread [...]. He served the slaves[...] and meal. And he threw barley and chaff and grass to the cattle. He threw bones to the dogs,- 110 -"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"and to the pigs he threw acorns and slop. Compare the disciple of God: if he is a sensible fellow,he understands what discipleship is all about. The bodily forms will not deceive him, but he willlook at the condition of the soul of each one and speak with him. There are many animals in theworld which are in a human form. When he identifies them, to the swine he will throw acorns, tothe cattle he will throw barley and chaff and grass, to the dogs he will throw bones. To the slaveshe will give only the elementary lessons, to the children he will give the complete instruction. There is the Son of Man and there is the son of the Son of Man. The Lord is the Son of Man, andthe son of the Son of Man is he who creates through the Son of Man. The Son of Man receivedfrom God the capacity to create. He also has the ability to beget. He who has received the ability tocreate is a creature. He who has received the ability to beget is an offspring. He who creates cannotbeget. He who begets also has power to create. Now they say, \"He who creates begets\". But his so-called \"offspring\" is merely a creature.

Also, he who creates, creates openly. But one who begets,begets children in private. No one can know when the husband and the wife have intercourse with one another, except thetwo of them. Indeed, marriage in the world is a mystery for those who have taken a wife. If thereis a hidden quality to the marriage of defilement, how much more is the undefiled marriage a truemystery! It is not fleshly, but pure. It belongs not to desire, but to the will. It belongs not to thedarkness or the night, but to the day and the light. If a marriage is open to the public, it hasbecome prostitution, and the bride plays the harlot not only when she is impregnated by anotherman, but even if she slips out of her bedroom and is seen. Let her show herself only to her fatherand her mother, and to the friend of the bridegroom and the sons of the bridegroom. These arepermitted to enter every day into the bridal chamber. But let the others yearn just to listen to hervoice and to enjoy her ointment, and let them feed from the crumbs that fall from the table, likethe dogs. Bridegrooms and brides belong to the bridal chamber. No one shall be able to see thebridegroom with the bride unless he become such a one. When Abraham [...] that he was to see what he was to see, he circumcised the flesh of the foreskin,teaching us that it is proper to destroy the flesh. Most things in the world, as long as their inner parts are hidden, stand upright and live. If they arerevealed, they die, as is illustrated by the visible man: as long as the intestines of the man arehidden, the man is alive; when his intestines are exposed and come out of him, the man will die.So also with the tree: while its root is hidden, it sprouts and grows. If its root is exposed, the treedries up. So it is with every birth that is in the world, not only with the revealed but with thehidden. For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it isdissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. That is why the Word says, \"Already the axe is laid atthe root of the trees\" (Mt 3:10). It will not merely cut - what is cut sprouts again - but the axpenetrates deeply, until it brings up the root. Jesus pulled out the root of the whole place, whileothers did it only partially. As for ourselves, let each one of us dig down after the root of evilwhich is within one, and let one pluck it out of one's heart from the root. It will be plucked out ifwe recognize it. But if we are ignorant of it, it takes root in us and produces its fruit in our heart. Itmasters us. We are its slaves. It takes us captive, to make us do what we do not want; and what wedo want, we do not do. It is powerful because we have not recognized it. While it exists it is active.Ignorance is the mother of all evil. Ignorance will result in death, because those who come fromignorance neither were nor are nor shall be. [...] will be perfect when all the truth is revealed. Fortruth is like ignorance: while it is hidden, it rests in itself, but when it is revealed and isrecognized, it is praised, inasmuch as it is stronger than ignorance and error. It gives freedom. TheWord said, \"If you know the truth, the truth will make you free\" (Jn 8:32). Ignorance is a slave.Knowledge is freedom. If we know the truth, we shall find the fruits of the truth within us. If weare joined to it, it will bring our fulfillment. At the present time, we have the manifest things of creation. We say, \"The strong who are held inhigh regard are great people. And the weak who are despised are the obscure.\" Contrast themanifest things of truth: they are weak and despised, while the hidden things are strong and held- 111 -"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"in high regard. The mysteries of truth are revealed, though in type and image. The bridal chamber,however, remains hidden. It is the Holy in the Holy. The veil at first concealed how Godcontrolled the creation, but when the veil is rent and the things inside are revealed, this house willbe left desolate, or rather will be destroyed. And the whole (inferior) godhead will flee from here,but not into the holies of the holies, for it will not be able to mix with the unmixed light and theflawless fullness, but will be under the wings of the cross and under its arms. This ark will be theirsalvation when the flood of water surges over them. If some belong to the order of the priesthood,they will be able to go within the veil with the high priest. For this reason, the veil was not rent atthe top only, since it would have been open only to those above; nor was it rent at the bottomonly, since it would have been revealed only to those below. But it was rent from the top tobottom. Those above opened to us the things below, in order that we may go in to the secret of thetruth. This truly is what is held in high regard, (and) what is strong! But we shall go in there bymeans of lowly types and forms of weakness. They are lowly indeed when compared with theperfect glory. There is glory which surpasses glory. There is power which surpasses power.Therefore, the perfect things have opened to us, together with the hidden things of truth. Theholies of the holies were revealed, and the bridal chamber invited us in. As long as it is hidden, wickedness is indeed ineffectual, but it has not been removed from themidst of the seed of the Holy Spirit. They are slaves of evil. But when it is revealed, then theperfect light will flow out on every one. And all those who are in it will receive the chrism. Thenthe slaves will be free and the captives ransomed. \"Every plant which my father who is in heavenhas not planted will be plucked out.\" (Mt 15:13) Those who are separated will unite [...] and will befilled. Every one who will enter the bridal chamber will kindle the light, for [...] just as in themarriages which are [...] happen at night. That fire [...] only at night, and is put out. But themysteries of that marriage are perfected rather in the day and the light. Neither that day nor itslight ever sets. If anyone becomes a son of the bridal chamber, he will receive the light. If anyonedoes not receive it while he is here, he will not be able to receive it in the other place. He who willreceive that light will not be seen, nor can he be detained. And none shall be able to torment aperson like this, even while he dwells in the world. And again when he leaves the world, he hasalready received the truth in the images. The world has become the Aeon (eternal realm), for theAeon is fullness for him. This is the way it is: it is revealed to him alone, not hidden in thedarkness and the night, but hidden in a perfect day and a holy light.The Gospel According to Philip- 112 -"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Hypostasis of the ArchonsT h e R e a l i t y o f t h e R u l e r sCODEX IITranslated by Bentley LaytonSelection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.On account of the reality of the authorities, (inspired) by the spirit of the father of truth, the greatapostle - referring to the \"authorities of the darkness\" - told us that \"our contest is not against fleshand blood; rather, the authorities of the universe and the spirits of wickedness.\" I have sent this (toyou) because you inquire about the reality of the authorities. Their chief is blind; because of his power and his ignorance and his arrogance he said, with hispower, \"It is I who am God; there is none apart from me.\" When he said this, he sinned against theentirety. And this speech got up to incorruptibility; then there was a voice that came forth fromincorruptibility, saying, \"You are mistaken, Samael\" - which is, \"god of the blind.\" His thoughts became blind. And, having expelled his power - that is, the blasphemy he hadspoken - he pursued it down to chaos and the abyss, his mother, at the instigation of Pistis Sophia.And she established each of his offspring in conformity with its power - after the pattern of therealms that are above, for by starting from the invisible world the visible world was invented. As incorruptibility looked down into the region of the waters, her image appeared in the waters;and the authorities of the darkness became enamored of her. But they could not lay hold of thatimage, which had appeared to them in the waters, because of their weakness - since beings thatmerely possess a soul cannot lay hold of those that possess a spirit - for they were from below,while it was from above. This is the reason why \"incorruptibility looked down into the region(etc.)\": so that, by the father's will, she might bring the entirety into union with the light. The rulers laid plans and said, \"Come, let us create a man that will be soil from the earth.\" Theymodeled their creature as one wholly of the earth. Now the rulers [...] body [...] they have [...]female [...] is [...] with the face of a beast. They had taken some soil from the earth and modeledtheir man after their body and after the image of God that had appeared to them in the waters.They said, \"Come, let us lay hold of it by means of the form that we have modeled, so that it maysee its male counterpart [...], and we may seize it with the form that we have modeled\" - notunderstanding the force of God, because of their powerlessness. And he breathed into his face;and the man came to have a soul (and remained) upon the ground many days. But they could notmake him arise because of their powerlessness. Like storm winds they persisted (in blowing), thatthey might try to capture that image, which had appeared to them in the waters. And they did notknow the identity of its power. Now all these things came to pass by the will of the father of the entirety. Afterwards, the spiritsaw the soul-endowed man upon the ground. And the spirit came forth from the AdamantineLand; it descended and came to dwell within him, and that man became a living soul. It called hisname Adam, since he was found moving upon the ground. A voice came forth fromincorruptibility for the assistance of Adam; and the rulers gathered together all the animals of theearth and all the birds of heaven and brought them in to Adam to see what Adam would callthem, that he might give a name to each of the birds and all the beasts. They took Adam and put him the garden, that he might cultivate it and keep watch over it. Andthe rulers issued a command to him, saying, \"From every tree in the garden shall you eat; yet fromthe tree of recognizing good and evil do not eat, nor touch it; for the day you eat from it, withdeath you are going to die.\" - 113 -"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"They [...] this. They do not understand what they have said to him; rather, by the father's will, theysaid this in such a way that he might (in fact) eat, and that Adam might <not> regard them aswould a man of an exclusively material nature. The rulers took counsel with one another and said, \"Come, let us cause a deep sleep to fall uponAdam.\" And he slept. - Now the deep sleep that they \"caused to fall upon him, and he slept\" isIgnorance. - They opened his side like a living woman. And they built up his side with some fleshin place of her, and Adam came to be endowed only with soul. And the spirit-endowed woman came to him and spoke with him, saying, \"Arise, Adam.\" Andwhen he saw her, he said, \"It is you who have given me life; you will be called 'mother of theliving'. - For it is she who is my mother. It is she who is the physician, and the woman, and shewho has given birth.\" Then the authorities came up to their Adam. And when they saw his female counterpart speakingwith him, they became agitated with great agitation; and they became enamored of her. They saidto one another, \"Come, let us sow our seed in her,\" and they pursued her. And she laughed atthem for their witlessness and their blindness; and in their clutches she became a tree, and leftbefore them her shadowy reflection resembling herself; and they defiled it foully. - And theydefiled the stamp of her voice, so that by the form they had modeled, together with their (own)image, they made themselves liable to condemnation. Then the female spiritual principle came in the snake, the instructor; and it taught them, saying,\"What did he say to you? Was it, 'From every tree in the garden shall you eat; yet - from the tree ofrecognizing good and evil do not eat'?\" The carnal woman said, \"Not only did he say ‘Do not eat’, but even ‘Do not touch it; for the dayyou eat from it, with death you are going to die.’\" And the snake, the instructor, said, \"With death you shall not die; for it was out of jealousy that hesaid this to you. Rather your eyes shall open and you shall come to be like gods, recognizing eviland good.\" And the female instructing principle was taken away from the snake, and she left itbehind, merely a thing of the earth. And the carnal woman took from the tree and ate; and she gave to her husband as well as herself;and these beings that possessed only a soul, ate. And their imperfection became apparent in theirlack of knowledge; and they recognized that they were naked of the spiritual element, and took figleaves and bound them upon their loins. Then the chief ruler came; and he said, \"Adam! Where are you?\" - for he did not understand whathad happened. And Adam said, \"I heard your voice and was afraid because I was naked; and Ihid.\" The ruler said, \"Why did you hide, unless it is because you have eaten from the tree from whichalone I commanded you not to eat? And you have eaten!\" Adam said, \"The woman that you gave me, she gave to me and I ate.\" And the arrogant rulercursed the woman. The woman said, \"It was the snake that led me astray and I ate.\" They turned to the snake andcursed its shadowy reflection, [...] powerless, not comprehending that it was a form theythemselves had modeled. From that day, the snake came to be under the curse of the authorities;until the all-powerful man was to come, that curse fell upon the snake. They turned to their Adam and took him and expelled him from the garden along with his wife;for they have no blessing, since they too are beneath the curse. Moreover, they threw mankindinto great distraction and into a life of toil, so that their mankind might be occupied by worldlyaffairs, and might not have the opportunity of being devoted to the holy spirit. Now afterwards, she bore Cain, their son; and Cain cultivated the land. Thereupon he knew hiswife; again becoming pregnant, she bore Abel; and Abel was a herdsman of sheep. Now Cainbrought in from the crops of his field, but Abel brought in an offering (from) among his lambs.God looked upon the votive offerings of Abel; but he did not accept the votive offerings of Cain.And carnal Cain pursued Abel, his brother. - 114 -"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"And God said to Cain, \"Where is Abel, your brother?\" He answered saying, \"Am I, then, my brother's keeper?\" God said to Cain, \"Listen!

It will return to you: anyone who kills Cain will let loose seven vengeances, andyou will exist groaning and trembling upon the earth.\" And Adam knew his female counterpart Eve, and she became pregnant, and bore Seth to Adam.And she said, \"I have borne another man through God, in place of Abel.\" Again Eve becamepregnant, and she bore Norea. And she said, \"He has begotten on me a virgin as an assistance formany generations of mankind.\" She is the virgin whom the forces did not defile. Then mankind began to multiply and improve. The rulers took counsel with one another and said,\"Come, let us cause a deluge with our hands and obliterate all flesh, from man to beast.\" But whenthe ruler of the forces came to know of their decision, he said to Noah, \"Make yourself an ark fromsome wood that does not rot and hide in it - you and your children and the beasts and the birds ofheaven from small to large - and set it upon Mount Sir.\" Then Orea came to him, wanting to board the ark. And when he would not let her, she blew uponthe ark and caused it to be consumed by fire. Again he made the ark, for a second time. The rulers went to meet her, intending to lead her astray. Their supreme chief said to her, \"Yourmother Eve came to us.\" But Norea turned to them and said to them, \"It is you who are the rulersof the darkness; you are accursed. And you did not know my mother; instead it was your femalecounterpart that you knew. For I am not your descendant; rather it is from the world above that Iam come.\" The arrogant ruler turned, with all his might, and his countenance came to be like (a) black [...]; hesaid to her presumptuously, \"You must render service to us, as did also your mother Eve; for Ihave been given [...].\" But Norea turned, with the might of [...]; and in a loud voice, she cried outup to the holy one, the God of the entirety, \"Rescue me from the rulers of unrighteousness andsave me from their clutches - forthwith!\" The <great> angel came down from the heavens and said to her, \"Why are you crying up to God?Why do you act so boldly towards the holy spirit?\" Norea said, \"Who are you?\" The rulers of unrighteousness had withdrawn from her. He said, \"It is I who am Eleleth, sagacity, the great angel who stands in the presence of the holyspirit. I have been sent to speak with you and save you from the grasp of the lawless. And I shallteach you about your root.\" (Norea apparently now speaking) Now as for that angel, I cannot speak of his power: hisappearance is like fine gold and his raiment is like snow. No, truly, my mouth cannot bear tospeak of his power and the appearance of his face! Eleleth, the great angel, spoke to me. \"It is I,\" he said, \"who am understanding. I am one of the fourlight-givers, who stand in the presence of the great invisible spirit. Do you think these rulers haveany power over you? None of them can prevail against the root of truth; for on its account heappeared in the final ages; and these authorities will be restrained. And these authorities cannotdefile you and that generation; for your abode is in incorruptibility, where the virgin spirit dwells,who is superior to the authorities of chaos and to their universe.\" But I said, \"Sir, teach me about the faculty of these authorities - how did they come into being, andby what kind of genesis, and of what material, and who created them and their force?\" And the great angel Eleleth, understanding, spoke to me: \"Within limitless realms dwellsincorruptibility.

A veil exists between the world above and therealms that are below; and shadow came into being beneath the veil; and that shadow becamematter; and that shadow was projected apart. And what she had created became a product in thematter, like an aborted fetus. And it assumed a plastic form molded out of shadow, and became anarrogant beast resembling a lion. It was androgynous, as I have already said, because it was frommatter that it derived. - 115 -"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Opening his eyes, he saw a vast quantity of matter without limit; and he became arrogant, saying,\"It is I who am God, and there is none other apart from me\". When he said this, he sinned againstthe entirety. And a voice came forth from above the realm of absolute power, saying, \"You aremistaken, Samael\" - which is, 'god of the blind'. And he said, \"If any other thing exists before me, let it become visible to me!\" And immediatelySophia stretched forth her finger and introduced light into matter; and she pursued it down to theregion of chaos. And she returned up to her light; once again darkness [...] matter. This ruler, by being androgynous, made himself a vast realm, an extent without limit. And hecontemplated creating offspring for himself, and created for himself seven offspring, androgynousjust like their parent. And he said to his offspring, \"It is I who am god of the entirety.\" And Zoe (Life), the daughter of Pistis Sophia, cried out and said to him, \"You are mistaken, Sakla!\"- for which the alternative name is Yaltabaoth. She breathed into his face, and her breath became afiery angel for her; and that angel bound Yaldabaoth and cast him down into Tartaros below theabyss. Now when his offspring Sabaoth saw the force of that angel, he repented and condemned hisfather and his mother, matter. He loathed her, but he sang songs of praise up to Sophia and herdaughter Zoe. And Sophia and Zoe caught him up and gave him charge of the seventh heaven,below the veil between above and below. And he is called 'God of the forces, Sabaoth', since he isup above the forces of chaos, for Sophia established him. Now when these (events) had come to pass, he made himself a huge four-faced chariot ofcherubim, and infinitely many angels to act as ministers, and also harps and lyres. And Sophiatook her daughter Zoe and had her sit upon his right to teach him about the things that exist in theeighth (heaven); and the angel of wrath she placed upon his left. Since that day, his right has beencalled 'life'; and the left has come to represent the unrighteousness of the realm of absolute powerabove. It was before your time that they came into being. Now when Yaldabaoth saw him (Sabaoth) in this great splendor and at this height, he envied him;and the envy became an androgynous product, and this was the origin of envy. And envyengendered death; and death engendered his offspring and gave each of them charge of itsheaven; and all the heavens of chaos became full of their multitudes.

Still, that sown element will not become known now.Instead, after three generations it will come to be known, and it has freed them from the bondageof the authorities' error.\" Then I said, \"Sir, how much longer?\" He said to me, \"Until the moment when the true man, within a modeled form, reveals theexistence of the spirit of truth, which the father has sent. Then he will teach them about everything, and he will anoint them with the unction of life eternal,given him from the undominated generation.

Sheeven has her womb. As long as she was alone with the father, she was virgin and in form androgynous. But when shefell down into a body and came to this life, then she fell into the hands of many robbers. And thewanton creatures passed her from one to another and [...] her. Some made use of her by force,while others did so by seducing her with a gift. In short, they defiled her, and she [...] hervirginity. And in her body she prostituted herself and gave herself to one and all, considering each one shewas about to embrace to be her husband. When she had given herself to wanton, unfaithfuladulterers, so that they might make use of her, then she sighed deeply and repented. But evenwhen she turns her face from those adulterers, she runs to others and they compel her to live withthem and render service to them upon their bed, as if they were her masters. Out of shame she nolonger dares to leave them, whereas they deceive her for a long time, pretending to be faithful,true husbands, as if they greatly respected her. And after all this they abandon her and go. She then becomes a poor desolate widow, without help; not even a measure of food was left herfrom the time of her affliction. For from them she gained nothing except the defilements they gaveher while they had sexual intercourse with her. And her offspring by the adulterers are dumb,blind and sickly. They are feebleminded. But when the father who is above visits her and looks down upon her and sees her sighing - withher sufferings and disgrace - and repenting of the prostitution in which she engaged, and whenshe begins to call upon his name so that he might help her, [...] all her heart, saying \"Save me, myfather, for behold I will render an account to thee, for I abandoned my house and fled from mymaiden`s quarters. Restore me to thyself again.\" When he sees her in such a state, then he willcount her worthy of his mercy upon her, for many are the afflictions that have come upon herbecause she abandoned her house. Now concerning the prostitution on the soul, the Holy Spirit prophesies in many places. For hesaid in the prophet Jeremiah (3:1-4), If the husband divorces his wife and she goes and takes another man, can she return to him afterthat? Has not that woman utterly defiled herself? \"And you prostituted yourself to manyshepherds and you returned to me!\" said the lord. \"Take an honest look and see where youprostituted yourself. Were you not sitting in the streets defiling the land with your acts ofprostitution and your vices? And you took many shepherds for a stumbling block for yourself.You became shameless with everyone. You did not call on me as kinsman or as father or author ofyour virginity\". Again it is written in the prophet Hosea (2:2-7),Come, go to law with your mother, for she is not to be a wife to me nor I a husband to her. I shallremove her prostitution from my presence, and I shall remove her adultery from between herbreasts. I shall make her naked as on the day she was born, and I shall make her desolate like aland without water, and I shall make her longingly childless. I shall show her children no pity, forthey are children of prostitution, since their mother prostituted herself and put her children toshame. For she said, \"I shall prostitute myself to my lovers. It was they who gave me my breadand my water and my garments and my clothes and my wine and my oil and everything Ineeded.\" Therefore behold I shall shut them up so that she shall not be able to run after her- 119 -"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"adulterers. And when she seeks them and does not find them, she will say, 'I shall return to myformer husband, in those days I was better off than now.\" Again he said in Ezekiel (16:23-26), It came to pass after much depravity, said the lord, you built yourself a brothel and you madeyourself a beautiful place in the streets. And you built yourself brothels on every lane, and youwasted your beauty, and you spread your legs in every alley, and you multiplied your acts ofprostitution. You prostituted yourself to the sons of Egypt, those who are your neighbors, mengreat of flesh. But what does \"the sons of Egypt, men great of flesh\" mean, if not the domain of the flesh and theperceptible realm and the affairs of the earth, by which the soul has become defiled here, receivingbread from them, as well as wine, oil, clothing, and the other external nonsense surrounding thebody - the things she thinks she needs. But as to this prostitution, the apostles of the savior commanded (Acts 15:20, 29; 21:25; 1Th 4:3; 1Co 6:18; 2 Co 7:1): \"Guard yourselves against it, purify yourselves from it,\" speaking not just of theprostitution of the body but especially that of the soul. For this reason the apostles write to thechurches of God, that such prostitution might not occur among us. Yet the greatest struggle has to do with the prostitution of the soul. From it arises the prostitutionof the body as well. Therefore Paul, writing to the Corinthians (1Co 5:9-10), said, \"I wrote you inthe letter, 'Do not associate with prostitutes,' not at all (meaning) the prostitutes of this world orthe greedy or the thieves or the idolaters, since then you would have to go out from the world.\" -here it is speaking spiritually - \"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood - as he said (Ep6:12) - but against the world rulers of this darkness and the spirits of wickedness.\" As long as the soul keeps running about everywhere copulating with whomever she meets anddefiling herself, she exists suffering her just deserts. But when she perceives the straits she is inand weeps before the father and repents, then the father will have mercy on her and he will makeher womb turn from the external domain and will turn it again inward, so that the soul will regainher proper character. For it is not so with a woman. For the womb of the body is inside the bodylike the other internal organs, but the womb of the soul is around the outside like the malegenitalia which is external. So when the womb of the soul, by the will of the father, turns itself inward, it is baptized and isimmediately cleansed of the external pollution which was pressed upon it, just as garments, whendirty, are put into the water and turned about until their dirt is removed and they become clean.And so the cleansing of the soul is to regain the newness of her former nature and to turn herselfback again. That is her baptism. Then she will begin to rage at herself like a woman in labor, who writhes and rages in the hour ofdelivery. But since she is female, by herself she is powerless to beget a child. From heaven thefather sent her her man, who is her brother, the firstborn. Then the bridegroom came down to thebride. She gave up her former prostitution and cleansed herself of the pollutions of the adulterers,and she was renewed so as to be a bride. She cleansed herself in the bridal chamber; she filled itwith perfume; she sat in it waiting for the true bridegroom. No longer does she run about themarket place, copulating with whomever she desires, but she continued to wait for him - (saying)\"When will he come?\" - and to fear him, for she did not know what he looked like: she no longerremembers since the time she fell from her father's house. But by the will of the father <...> Andshe dreamed of him like a woman in love with a man. But then the bridegroom, according to the father's will, came down to her into the bridal chamber,which was prepared. And he decorated the bridal chamber. For since that marriage is not like the carnal marriage, those who are to have intercourse with oneanother will be satisfied with that intercourse. And as if it were a burden, they leave behind themthe annoyance of physical desire and they turn their faces from each other. But this marriage [...].But once they unite with one another, they become a single life. Wherefore the prophet said (Gn2:24) concerning the first man and the first woman, \"They will become a single flesh.\" For they- 120 -"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"were originally joined one to another when they were with the father before the woman led astraythe man, who is her brother. This marriage has brought them back together again and the soul hasbeen joined to her true love, her real master, as it is written (cf. Gn 3:16; 1 Co 11;1; Ep 5:23), \"Forthe master of the woman is her husband.\" Then gradually she recognized him, and she rejoiced once more, weeping before him as sheremembered the disgrace of her former widowhood. And she adorned herself still more so that hemight be pleased to stay with her. And the prophet said in the Psalms (Ps 45:10-11): \"Hear, my daughter, and see and incline yourear and forget your people and your father's house, for the king has desired your beauty, for he isyour lord.\" For he requires her to turn her face from her people and the multitude of her adulterers, in whosemidst she once was, to devote herself only to her king, her real lord, and to forget the house of theearthly father, with whom things went badly for her, but to remember her father who is in heaven.Thus also it was said (Gn 12:1) to Abraham: \"Come out from your country and your kinsfolk andfrom your father`s house\" Thus when the soul had adorned herself again in her beauty [...] enjoyed her beloved, and he alsoloved her. And when she had intercourse with him, she got from him the seed that is the life-giving spirit, so that by him she bears good children and rears them. For this is the great, perfectmarvel of birth. And so this marriage is made perfect by the will of the father. Now it is fitting that the soul regenerates herself and become again as she formerly was. The soulthen moves of her own accord. And she received the divine nature from the father for herrejuvenation, so that she might be restored to the place where originally she had been. This is theresurrection that is from the dead. This is the ransom from captivity. This is the upward journey ofascent to heaven. This is the way of ascent to the father. Therefore the prophet said (Ps 103:1-5): \"Praise the lord, O my soul, and, all that is within me, (praise) his holy name. My soul, praise God,who forgave all your sins, who healed all your sicknesses, who ransomed your life from death,who crowned you with mercy, who satisfies your longing with good things. Your youth will berenewed like an eagle's.\" Then when she becomes young again, she will ascend, praising the father and her brother, bywhom she was rescued. Thus it is by being born again that the soul will be saved. And this is duenot to rote phrases or to professional skills or to book learning. Rather it is the grace of the [...], it isthe gift of the [...]. For such is this heavenly thing. Therefore the savior cries out (Jn 6:44), \"No onecan come to me unless my Father draws him and brings him to me; and I myself will raise him upon the last day.\" It is therefore fitting to pray to the father and to call on him with all our soul - not externally withthe lips, but with the spirit, which is inward, which came forth from the depth - sighing; repentingfor the life we lived; confessing our sins; perceiving the empty deception we were in, and theempty zeal; weeping over how we were in darkness and in the wave; mourning for ourselves, thathe might have pity on us; hating ourselves for how we are now. Again the savior said (cf Mt 5:4, Lk 6:12): \"Blessed are those who mourn, for it is they who will bepitied; blessed, those who are hungry, for it is they who will be filled.\" Again he said (cf. Lk 14:26), \"If one does not hate his soul he cannot follow me.\" For the beginningof salvation is repentance. Therefore (cf. Acts 13:24), \"Before Christ`s appearance came John,preaching the baptism of repentance.\" And repentance takes place in distress and grief. But the father is good and loves humanity, andhe hears the soul that calls upon him and sends it the light of salvation. Therefore he said throughthe spirit to the prophet (cf. 1 Cl 8:3), \"Say to the children of my people, 'If your sins extend fromearth to heaven, and if they become red like scarlet and blacker than sackcloth, and if you returnto me with all your soul and say to me 'my Father!', I will heed you as a holy people.'\" Again another place (Is 30:15), \"Thus says the lord, the holy one of Israel: \"If you return and sigh,then you will be saved and will know where you were when you trusted in what is empty.\" - 121 -"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Again he said in another place (Is 30:19-20), \"Jerusalem wept much, saying, 'Have pity on me.' Hewill have pity on the sound of your weeping. And when he saw, he heeded you. And the lord willgive you bread of affliction and water of oppression. From now on, those who deceive will notapproach you again. Your eyes will see those who are deceiving you.\" Therefore it is fitting to pray to God night and day, spreading out our hands towards him as dopeople sailing in the middle of the sea: they pray to God with all their heart without hypocrisy.For those who pray hypocritically deceive only themselves. Indeed, it is in order that he mightknow who is worthy of salvation that God examines the inward parts and searches the bottom ofthe heart. For no one is worthy of salvation who still loves the place of deception. Therefore it is written in the poet (Homer, Odyssey 1.48-1.59), \"Odysseus sat on the island weepingand grieving and turning his face from the words of Calypso and from her tricks, longing to seehis village and smoke coming forth from it. And had he not received help from heaven, he wouldnot have been able to return to his village.\" Again Helen <...> saying (Odyssey 4.260-261), \"My heart turned itself from me. It is to my housethat I want to return.\" For she sighed, saying (Odyssey 4.261-4.264), \"It is Aphrodite who deceived me and brought meout of my village. My only daughter I left behind me, and my good, understanding, handsomehusband.\" For when the soul leaves her perfect husband because of the treachery of Aphrodite, who existshere in the act of begetting, then she will suffer harm. But if she sighs and repents, she will berestored to her house. Certainly Israel would not have been visited in the first place, to be brought out of the land ofEgypt, out of the house of bondage, if it had not sighed to God and wept for the oppression of itslabors. Again it is written in the Psalms (6:6-9), \"I was greatly troubled in my groaning. I will bathe mybed and my cover each night with my tears. I have become old in the midst of all my enemies.Depart from me, all you who work at lawlessness, for behold the lord has heard the cry of myweeping and the lord has heard my prayer.\" If we repent, truly God will heed us, he who is long suffering and abundantly merciful, to whomis the glory for ever and ever.

And itis obvious to me that the truth is difficult to perform before men.\" The savior answered, saying, \"If the things that are visible to you are obscure to you, how can youhear about the things that are not visible? If the deeds of the truth that are visible in the world aredifficult for you to perform, how indeed, then, shall you perform those that pertain to the exaltedheight and to the pleroma which are not visible? And how shall you be called 'laborers'? In thisrespect you are apprentices, and have not yet received the height of perfection.\" Now Thomas answered and said to the savior, \"Tell us about these things that you say are notvisible, but are hidden from us.\" The savior said, \"All bodies [...] the beasts are begotten [...] it is evident like [...] this, too, those thatare above [...] things that are visible, but they are visible in their own root, and it is their fruit thatnourishes them.

He came downfrom above for the annulment of the deficiency. Then the great Logos, the divine Autogenes, and the incorruptible man Adamas mingled witheach other. A Logos of man came into being. However, the man came into being through a word.

And thus there came forth from above the power of the great light, the Manifestation. She gavebirth to the four great lights: Harmozel, Oroiael, Davithe, Eleleth, and the great incorruptible Seth,the son of the incorruptible man Adamas. And thus the perfect hebdomad, which exists in hidden mysteries, became complete. When shereceives the glory, she becomes eleven ogdoads. And the Father nodded approval; the whole pleroma of the lights was well pleased. Their consortscame forth for the completion of the ogdoad of the divine Autogenes: the Grace of the first lightHarmozel, the Perception of the second light Oroiael, the Understanding of the third lightDavithe, the Prudence of the fourth light Eleleth. This is the first ogdoad of the divine Autogenes. And the Father nodded approval; the whole pleroma of the lights was well pleased.

And the consorts of these came forth by the will ofthe good pleasure of the Father: the Memory of the great one, the first, Gamaliel; the Love of thegreat one, the second, Gabriel; the Peace of the third one, the great Samblo; the eternal Life of thegreat one, the fourth, Abrasax.

Then the three malechildren came forth from above, down into the unborn ones, and the self-begotten ones, and thosewho were begotten in what is begotten. The greatness came forth, the whole greatness of the greatChrist.

Then there came forth from that place the great power of the great light Plesithea, the mother ofthe angels, the mother of the lights, the glorious mother, the virgin with the four breasts, bringingthe fruit from Gomorrah, as spring, and Sodom, which is the fruit of the spring of Gomorrahwhich is in her. She came forth through the great Seth. Then the great Seth rejoiced about the gift which was granted him by the incorruptible child. Hetook his seed from her with the four breasts, the virgin, and he placed it with him in the fourthaeon (or, in the four aeons), in the third great light Davithe. After five thousand years, the great light Eleleth spoke: \"Let someone reign over the chaos andHades.\" And there appeared a cloud whose name is hylic Sophia [...] She looked out on the partsof the chaos, her face being like [...] in her form [...] blood. And the great angel Gamaliel spoke tothe great Gabriel, the minister of the great light Oroiael; he said, \"Let an angel come forth, in orderthat he may reign over the chaos and Hades.\" Then the cloud, being agreeable, came forth in thetwo monads, each one of which had light. [...] the throne, which she had placed in the cloudabove. Then Sakla, the great angel, saw the great demon who is with him, Nebruel. And theybecame together a begetting spirit of the earth. They begot assisting angels. Sakla said to the greatdemon Nebruel, \"Let the twelve aeons come into being in the [...] aeon, worlds [...].\" [...] the greatangel Sakla said by the will of the Autogenes, \"There shall be the [...] of the number of seven [...].\"And he said to the great angels, \"Go and let each of you reign over his world.\" Each one of thesetwelve angels went forth. The first angel is Athoth. He is the one whom the great generations ofmen call [...]. The second is Harmas, who is the eye of the fire. The third is Galila. The fourth isYobel. The fifth is Adonaios, who is called 'Sabaoth'. The sixth is Cain, whom the great generationsof men call the sun. The seventh is Abel; the eighth Akiressina; the ninth Yubel. The tenth isHarmupiael. The eleventh is Archir-Adonin. The twelfth is Belias. These are the ones who presideover Hades and the chaos. And after the founding of the world, Sakla said to his angels, \"I, I am a jealous god, and apart fromme nothing has come into being,\" since he trusted in his nature. Then a voice came from on high, saying, \"The Man exists, and the Son of the Man.\" Because of thedescent of the image above, which is like its voice in the height of the image which has looked outthrough the looking out of the image above, the first creature was formed. Because of this, Metanoia came into being. She received her completion and her power by the willof the Father, and his approval, with which he approved of the great, incorruptible, immovablerace of the great, mighty men of the great Seth, in order that he may sow it in the aeons which hadbeen brought forth, so that through her (Metanoia), the deficiency may be filled up. For she hadcome forth from above, down to the world, which is the image of the night. When she had come,she prayed for (the repentance of) both the seed of the archon of this aeon, and <the> authoritieswho had come forth from him, that defiled (seed) of the demon-begetting god which will bedestroyed, and the seed of Adam and the great Seth, which is like the sun. Then the great angel Hormos came to prepare, through the virgins of the corrupted sowing of thisaeon, in a Logos-begotten, holy vessel, through the holy Spirit, the seed of the great Seth. Then the great Seth came and brought his seed. And it was sown in the aeons which had beenbrought forth, their number being the amount of Sodom. Some say that Sodom is the place of- 131 -"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"pasture of the great Seth, which is Gomorrah. But others (say) that the great Seth took his plant outof Gomorrah and planted it in the second place, to which he gave the name 'Sodom'. This is the race which came forth through Edokla. For she gave birth through the word, to Truthand Justice, the origin of the seed of the eternal life, which is with those who will persevere,because of the knowledge of their emanation. This is the great, incorruptible race which has comeforth through three worlds to the world. And the flood came as an example, for the consummation of the aeon. But it will be sent into theworld because of this race. A conflagration will come upon the earth. And grace will be with thosewho belong to the race, through the prophets and the guardians who guard the life of the race.Because of this race, famines will occur, and plagues. But these things will happen because of thegreat, incorruptible race. Because of this race, temptations will come, a falsehood of false prophets.Then the great Seth saw the activity of the devil, and his many guises, and his schemes, which willcome upon his (Seth's) incorruptible, immovable race, and the persecutions of his powers and hisangels, and their error, that they acted against themselves. Then the great Seth gave praise to the great, uncallable, virginal Spirit, and the male virginBarbelon, and the thrice-male child Telmael Telmael Heli Heli Machar Machar Seth, the powerwhich really truly lives, and the male virgin Youel, and Esephech, the holder of glory and thecrown of his glory, and the great Doxomedon-aeon, and the thrones which are in him, and thepowers which surround them, and the whole pleroma, as I mentioned before. And he asked forguards over his seed.

Then the great Seth was sent by the four lights, by the will of the Autogenes and the wholepleroma, through <the gift> and the good pleasure of the great invisible Spirit, and the five seals,and the whole pleroma. He passed through the three parousias which I mentioned before: the flood, and the conflagration,and the judgment of the archons and the powers and the authorities, to save her (the race) whowent astray, through the reconciliation of the world, and the baptism through a Logos-begottenbody which the great Seth prepared for himself secretly through the virgin, in order that the saintsmay be begotten by the holy Spirit, through invisible, secret symbols, through a reconciliation ofthe world with the world, through the renouncing of the world, and the god of the thirteen aeons,and (through) the convocations of the saints and the ineffable ones, and (through) theincorruptible bosom, and (through) the great light of the Father, who pre-existed with hisProvidence, and established through her the holy baptism that surpasses the heaven, through theincorruptible, Logos-begotten one, even Jesus the living one, even he whom the great Seth has puton. And through him, he nailed the powers of the thirteen aeons, and established those who arebrought forth and taken away.

Parrott (combining III,3 and V,1)Selection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.Eugnostos, the Blessed, to those who are his. Rejoice in this, that you know. Greetings! I want you to know that all men born from thefoundation of the world until now are dust. While they have inquired about God, who he is andwhat he is like, they have not found him. The wisest among them have speculated about the truthfrom the ordering of the world. And the speculation has not reached the truth. For the ordering isspoken of in three (different) opinions by all the philosophers; hence they do not agree. For someof them say about the world that it was directed by itself. Others, that it is providence (that directsit). Others, that it is fate. But it is none of these. Again, of three voices that I have just mentioned,none is true. For whatever is from itself is an empty life; it is self-made. Providence is foolish. Fateis an undiscerning thing. Whoever, then, is able to get free of these three voices I have just mentioned and come by meansof another voice to confess the God of truth and agree in everything concerning him, he isimmortal dwelling in the midst of mortal men. He-Who-Is is ineffable. No principle knew him, no authority, no subjection, nor any creature fromthe foundation of the world, except he alone. For he is immortal and eternal, having no birth; foreveryone who has birth will perish. He is unbegotten, having no beginning; for everyone who hasa beginning has an end. No one rules over him. He has no name; for whoever has a name is thecreation of another. He is unnameable. He has no human form; for whoever has human form isthe creation of another. He has his own semblance - not like the semblance we have received andseen, but a strange semblance that surpasses all things and is better than the totalities. It looks toevery side and sees itself from itself. He is infinite; he is incomprehensible. He is ever imperishable(and) has no likeness (to anything). He is unchanging good. He is faultless. He is everlasting. He isblessed. He is unknowable, while he (nonetheless) knows himself. He is immeasurable. He isuntraceable. He is perfect, having no defect. He is imperishably blessed. He is called 'Father of theUniverse'. Before anything is visible among those that are visible, the majesty and the authorities that are inhim, he embraces the totalities of the totalities, and nothing embraces him. For he is all mind,thought and reflecting, considering, rationality and power. They all are equal powers. They are thesources of the totalities. And their whole race <from first> to last is in the foreknowledge of theUnbegotten, for they had not yet come to visibility. Now a difference existed among the imperishable aeons. Let us, then, consider (it) this way:Everything that came from the perishable will perish, since it came from the perishable. Whatevercame from imperishableness will not perish but will become imperishable, since it came fromimperishableness. So, many men went astray because they had not known this difference; that is,they died. But this much is enough, since it is impossible for anyone to dispute the nature of the words I havejust spoken about the blessed, imperishable, true God. Now, if anyone wants to believe the wordsset down (here), let him go from what is hidden to the end of what is visible, and this Thoughtwill instruct him how faith in those things that are not visible was found in what is visible. This isa principle of knowledge. The Lord of the Universe is not rightly called 'Father' but 'Forefather'. For the Father is thebeginning (or principle) of what is visible. For he (the Lord) is the beginningless Forefather. Hesees himself within himself, like a mirror, having appeared in his likeness as Self-Father, that is,Self-Begetter, and as Confronter, since he confronted Unbegotten First Existent. He is indeed ofequal age with the one who is before him, but he is not equal to him in power. - 134 -"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Afterward he revealed many confronting, self-begotten ones, equal in age (and) power, being inglory and without number, who are called 'The Generation over Whom There Is No Kingdomamong the Kingdoms That Exist'. And the whole multitude of the place over which there is nokingdom is called 'Sons of Unbegotten Father.' Now the Unknowable is ever full of imperishableness and ineffable joy. They are all at rest in him,ever rejoicing in ineffable joy, over the unchanging glory and the measureless jubilation that wasnever heard or known among all the aeons and their worlds. But this much is enough, lest we goon endlessly. This is another principle of knowledge from <Self->begotten. The First who appeared before the universe in infinity is Self-grown, Self-constructed Father, andis full of shining, ineffable light. In the beginning, he decided to have his likeness become a greatpower. Immediately, the principle (or beginning) of that Light appeared as ImmortalAndrogynous Man. His male name is 'Begotten, Perfect Mind'. And his female name is 'All-wiseBegettress Sophia'. It is also said that she resembles her brother and her consort. She isuncontested truth; for here below, error, which exists with truth, contests it. Through Immortal Man appeared the first designation, namely, divinity and kingdom, for theFather, who is called 'Self-Father Man' revealed this. He created a great aeon for his own majesty.He gave him great authority, and he ruled over all creations. He created gods and archangels andangels, myriads without number for retinue. Now through that Man originated divinity and kingdom. Therefore he was called 'God of gods','King of kings'. First Man is 'Faith' ('pistis') for those who will come afterward. He has, within, a unique mind andthought - just as he is it (thought) - reflecting and considering, rationality and power. All theattributes that exist are perfect and immortal. In respect to imperishableness, they are indeedequal. (But) in respect to power, there is a difference, like the difference between father and son,and son and thought, and the thought and the remainder. As I said earlier, among the things that were created the monad is first, the dyad follows it, andthe triad, up to the tenths. Now the tenths rule the hundredths; the hundredths rule thethousandths; the thousands rule the ten thousands. This is the pattern <among the> immortals.First Man is like this: His monad [...]. Again it is this pattern that exists among the immortals: the monad and the thought are thosethings that belong to Immortal Man. The thinkings are for <the> decads, and the hundreds are theteachings, and the thousands are the counsels, and the ten thousands are the powers. Now thosewho come from the [...] exist with their [...] in every aeon [...]. [...] In the beginning, thought and thinkings appeared from mind, then teachings from thinkings,counsels from teachings, and power from counsels. And after all the attributes, all that wasrevealed appeared from his powers. And from what was created, what was fashioned appeared.And what was formed appeared from what was fashioned. What was named appeared from whatwas formed, while the difference among begotten things appeared from what was named, frombeginning to end, by power of all the aeons. Now Immortal Man is full of every imperishableglory and ineffable joy. His whole kingdom rejoices in everlasting rejoicing, those who never havebeen heard of or known in any aeon that came after them and its worlds. Afterward another principle came from Immortal Man, who is called 'Self-perfected Begetter.'When he received the consent of his consort, Great Sophia, he revealed that first-begottenandrogyne, who is called, 'First-begotten Son of God'. His female aspect is 'First-begotten Sophia,Mother of the Universe,' whom some call 'Love'. Now, First-begotten, since he has his authorityfrom his father, created angels, myriads without number, for retinue. The whole multitude ofthose angels are called 'Assembly of the Holy Ones, the Shadowless Lights.' Now when these greeteach other, their embraces become like angels like themselves. First Begetter Father is called 'Adam of the Light.' And the kingdom of Son of Man is full ofineffable joy and unchanging jubilation, ever rejoicing in ineffable joy over their imperishable- 135 -"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"glory, which has never been heard nor has it been revealed to all the aeons that came to be andtheir worlds. Then Son of Man consented with Sophia, his consort, and revealed a great androgynous Light. Hismasculine name is designated 'Savior, Begetter of All things'. His feminine name is designated'Sophia, All-Begettress'. Some call her 'Pistis' (faith). Then Savior consented with his consort, Pistis Sophia, and revealed six androgynous spiritualbeings who are the type of those who preceded them. Their male names are these: first,'Unbegotten'; second, 'Self-begotten'; third, 'Begetter'; fourth, 'First begetter'; fifth, 'All-begetter';sixth, 'Arch-begetter'. Also the names of the females are these; first, 'All-wise Sophia'; second, 'All-Mother Sophia'; third, 'All-Begettress Sophia'; fourth, 'First Begettress Sophia'; fifth, 'Love Sophia';sixth, 'Pistis Sophia'. From the consenting of those I have just mentioned, thoughts appeared in the aeons that exist.From thoughts, reflectings; from reflectings, considerings; from considerings, rationalities, fromrationalities, wills, from wills, words. Then the twelve powers, whom I have just discussed, consented with each other. <Six> males(and) females (each) were revealed, so that there are seventy-two powers. Each one of the seventy-two revealed five spiritual (powers), which (together) are the three hundred and sixty powers. Theunion of them all is the will. Therefore our aeon came to be as the type of Immortal Man. Time came to be as the type of FirstBegetter, his son. The year came to be as the type of Savior. The twelve months came to be as thetype of the twelve powers. The three hundred and sixty days of the year came to be as the threehundred and sixty powers who appeared from Savior. Their hours and moments came to be as thetype of the angels who came from them (the powers), who are without number. And when those whom I have discussed appeared, All-Begetter, their father, very soon createdtwelve aeons for retinue for the twelve angels. And in each aeon there were six (heavens), so thereare seventy-two heavens of the seventy-two powers who appeared from him. And in each of theheavens there were five firmaments, so there are (altogether) three hundred sixty firmaments ofthe three hundred sixty powers that appeared from them. When the firmaments were complete,they were called 'The Three Hundred Sixty Heavens', according to the name of the heavens thatwere before them. And all these are perfect and good. And in this way the defect of femalenessappeared. The first aeon, then, is that of Immortal Man. The second aeon is that of Son of Man, who is called'First Begetter' (\"who is called 'Savior'\" added in Codex V). That which embraces these is the aeonover which there is no kingdom, (the aeon) of the Eternal Infinite God, the aeon of the aeon of theimmortals who are in it, (the aeon) above the Eighth that appeared in chaos. Now Immortal Man revealed aeons and powers and kingdoms and gave authority to everyonewho appeared from him, to make whatever they desire until the days that are above chaos. Forthese consented with each other and revealed every magnificence, even from spirit, multitudinouslights that are glorious and without number. These received names in the beginning, that is, thefirst, the middle, the perfect; that is, the first aeon and the second and the third. The first wascalled 'Unity and Rest'.

After he rose from the dead, his twelve disciples and seven women continued to be his followers,and went to Galilee onto the mountain called \"Divination and Joy\". When they gathered togetherand were perplexed about the underlying reality of the universe and the plan, and the holyprovidence, and the power of the authorities, and about everything the Savior is doing with themin the secret of the holy plan, the Savior appeared - not in his previous form, but in the invisiblespirit. And his likeness resembles a great angel of light. But his resemblance I must not describe.No mortal flesh could endure it, but only pure, perfect flesh, like that which he taught us about onthe mountain called \"Of the Olives\" in Galilee. And he said: \"Peace be to you, My peace I give you!\" And they all marveled and were afraid. TheSavior laughed and said to them: \"What are you thinking about? Are you perplexed? What areyou searching for?\" Philip said: \"For the underlying reality of the universe and the plan.\" The Savior said to them: \"I want you to know that all men are born on earth from the foundationof the world until now, being dust, while they have inquired about God, who he is and what he islike, have not found him. Now the wisest among them have speculated from the ordering of theworld and (its) movement. But their speculation has not reached the truth. For it is said that theordering is directed in three ways, by all the philosophers, (and) hence they do not agree. Forsome of them say about the world that it is directed by itself. Others, that it is providence (thatdirects it). Others, that it is fate. But it is none of these. Again, of the three voices I have justmentioned, none is close to the truth, and (they are) from man. But I, who came from InfiniteLight, I am here - for I know him (Light) - that I might speak to you about the precise nature of thetruth. For whatever is from itself is a polluted life; it is self-made. Providence has no wisdom in it.And fate does not discern. But to you it is given to know; and whoever is worthy of knowledgewill receive (it), whoever has not been begotten by the sowing of unclean rubbing but by FirstWho Was Sent, for he is an immortal in the midst of mortal men.\" Matthew said to him: \"Lord, no one can find the truth except through you.

He has no human form; for whoever has human form is thecreation of another). \"And he has a semblance of his own - not like what you have seen and received, but a strangesemblance that surpasses all things and is better than the universe.

When God had created me out of the earth, along with Eve, yourmother, I went about with her in a glory which she had seen in the aeon from which we had comeforth. She taught me a word of knowledge of the eternal God. And we resembled the great eternalangels, for we were higher than the god who had created us and the powers with him, whom wedid not know. Then God, the ruler of the aeons and the powers, divided us in wrath.

For wewere not strangers to his powers. And we served him in fear and slavery. And after these things,we became darkened in our heart(s). Now I slept in the thought of my heart. And I saw three men before me whose likeness I was unable to recognize, since they were not thepowers of the God who had created us. They surpassed [...] glory, and [...] men [...] saying to me,\"Arise, Adam, from the sleep of death, and hear about the aeon and the seed of that man to whomlife has come, who came from you and from Eve, your wife.\" When I had heard these words from the great men who were standing before me, then we sighed,I and Eve, in our heart(s). And the Lord, the God who had created us, stood before us. He said tous, \"Adam, why were you (both) sighing in your hearts? Do you not know that I am the God whocreated you? And I breathed into you a spirit of life as a living soul.\" Then darkness came uponour eyes. Then the God who created us, created a son from himself and Eve, your mother.

Others were notanxious in their hearts. And in our hearts, we were united. We agreed to fulfill the ministry towhich the Lord appointed us. And we made a covenant with each other. We went down to the sea at an opportune moment, which came to us from the Lord. We found aship moored at the shore ready to embark, and we spoke with the sailors of the ship about ourcoming aboard with them. They showed great kindliness toward us as was ordained by the Lord.And after we had embarked, we sailed a day and a night. After that, a wind came up behind theship and brought us to a small city in the midst of the sea. And I, Peter, inquired about the name of this city from residents who were standing on the dock.A man among them answered, saying, \"The name of this city is Habitation, that is, Foundation [...]endurance.\" And the leader among them holding the palm branch at the edge of the dock. Andafter we had gone ashore with the baggage, I went into the city, to seek advice about lodging. A man came out wearing a cloth bound around his waist, and a gold belt girded it. Also a napkinwas tied over his chest, extending over his shoulders and covering his head and his hands. I was staring at the man, because he was beautiful in his form and stature. There were four partsof his body that I saw: the soles of his feet and a part of his chest and the palms of his hands andhis visage. These things I was able to see. A book cover like (those of) my books was in his lefthand. A staff of styrax wood was in his right hand. His voice was resounding as he slowly spoke,crying out in the city, \"Pearlsl Pearlsl\" I, indeed, thought he was a man of that city. I said to him, \"My brother and my friend!\" Heanswered me, then, saying, \"Rightly did you say, 'My brother and my friend.' What is it you seekfrom me?\" I said to him, \"I ask you about lodging for me and the brothers also, because we arestrangers here.\" He said to me, \"For this reason have I myself just said, 'My brother and my friend,'because I also am a fellow stranger like you.\" And having said these things, he cried out, \"Pearls! Pearls!\" The rich men of that city heard hisvoice. They came out of their hidden storerooms. And some were looking out from the storeroomsof their houses. Others looked out from their upper windows. And they did not see (that theycould gain) anything from him, because there was no pouch on his back nor bundle inside hiscloth and napkin. And because of their disdain they did not even acknowledge him. He, for hispart, did not reveal himself to them. They returned to their storerooms, saying, \"This man ismocking us.\" And the poor of that city heard his voice, and they came to the man who sells this pearl. They said,\"Please take the trouble to show us the pearl so that we may, then, see it with our (own) eyes. Forwe are the poor. And we do not have this [...] price to pay for it. But show us that we might say toour friends that we saw a pearl with our (own) eyes.\" He answered, saying to them, \"If it ispossible, come to my city, so that I may not only show it before your (very) eyes, but give it to youfor nothing.\" And indeed they, the poor of that city, heard and said, \"Since we are beggars, we surely know thata man does not give a pearl to a beggar, but (it is) bread and money that is usually received. Nowthen, the kindness which we want to receive from you (is) that you show us the pearl before oureyes.

Peter answered and told those things that he had heardabout the hardships of the way. Because they are interpreters of the hardships in their ministry. He said to the man who sells this pearl, \"I want to know your name and the hardships of the wayto your city because we are strangers and servants of God. It is necessary for us to spread the wordof God in every city harmoniously.\" He answered and said, \"If you seek my name, Lithargoel ismy name, the interpretation of which is, the light, gazelle-like stone. \"And also (concerning) the road to the city, which you asked me about, I will tell you about it. Noman is able to go on that road, except one who has forsaken everything that he has and has fasteddaily from stage to stage. For many are the robbers and wild beasts on that road. The one whocarries bread with him on the road, the black dogs kill because of the bread. The one who carries acostly garment of the world with him, the robbers kill because of the garment. The one who carrieswater with him, the wolves kill because of the water, since they were thirsty for it. The one who isanxious about meat and green vegetables, the lions eat because of the meat. If he evades the lions,the bulls devour him because of the green vegetables.\" When he had said these things to me, I sighed within myself, saying, \"Great hardships are on theroad! If only Jesus would give us power to walk it!\" He looked at me since my face was sad, and Isighed. He said to me, \"Why do you sigh, if you, indeed, know this name \"Jesus\" and believe him?He is a great power for giving strength. For I too believe in the Father who sent him.\" I replied, asking him, \"What is the name of the place to which you go, your city?\" He said to me,\"This is the name of my city, 'Nine Gates.' Let us praise God as we are mindful that the tenth is thehead.\" After this I went away from him in peace. As I was about to go and call my friends, I saw waves and large high walls surrounding thebounds of the city. I marveled at the great things I saw. I saw an old man sitting and I asked him ifthe name of the city was really Habitation. He [...], \"Habitation [...].\" He said to me, \"You speaktruly, for we inhabit here because we endure.\" I responded, saying, \"Justly [...] have men named it [...], because (by) everyone who endures histrials, cities are inhabited, and a precious kingdom comes from them, because they endure in themidst of the apostasies and the difficulties of the storms. So that in this way, the city of everyonewho endures the burden of his yoke of faith will be inhabited, and he will be included in thekingdom of heaven.\" I hurried and went and called my friends so that we might go to the city that he, Lithargoel,appointed for us. In a bond of faith we forsook everything as he had said (to do). We evaded therobbers, because they did not find their garments with us. We evaded the wolves, because theydid not find the water with us for which they thirsted. We evaded the lions, because they did notfind the desire for meat with us. We evaded the bulls [...] they did not find green vegetables. A great joy came upon us and a peaceful carefreeness like that of our Lord. We rested ourselves infront of the gate, and we talked with each other about that which is not a distraction of this world.Rather we continued in contemplation of the faith. As we discussed the robbers on the road, whom we evaded, behold Lithargoel, having changed,came out to us. He had the appearance of a physician, since an unguent box was under his arm,and a young disciple was following him carrying a pouch full of medicine. We did not recognizehim. Peter responded and said to him, \"We want you to do us a favor, because we are strangers, andtake us to the house of Lithargoel before evening comes.\" He said, \"In uprightness of heart I willshow it to you.

Do you not understand that my name, which you teach, surpasses all riches, and the wisdomof God surpasses gold, and silver and precious stone(s)?\" He gave them the pouch of medicine and said, \"Heal all the sick of the city who believe in myname.\" Peter was afraid to reply to him for the second time. He signaled to the one who wasbeside him, who was John: \"You talk this time.\" John answered and said, \"Lord, before you we areafraid to say many words. But it is you who asks us to practice this skill. We have not been taughtto be physicians. How then will we know how to heal bodies as you have told us?\" He answered them, \"Rightly have you spoken, John, for I know that the physicians of this worldheal what belongs to the world. The physicians of souls, however, heal the heart. Heal the bodiesfirst, therefore, so that through the real powers of healing for their bodies, without medicine of theworld, they may believe in you, that you have power to heal the illnesses of the heart also. \"The rich men of the city, however, those who did not see fit even to acknowledge me, but whoreveled in their wealth and pride - with such as these, therefore, do not dine in their houses nor befriends with them, lest their partiality influence you.

W. MacRae, Nag Hammadi Codices V,2-5 and VI withPapyrus Berolinensis 8502,1 and 4, ed. D. Parrott, Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1979, 231-55, with critical reference to the Englishtranslations of G. W. MacRae, in The Nag Hammadi Library in English, ed. J. M. Robinson, 271-277; and B. Layton, TheGnostic Scriptures, NY: Doubleday, 1987, 80-85. The poetic arrangement of the text is adapted from the translation of R.Unger, \"Zur sprachlichen und formalen Struktur des gnostischen Textes 'Der Donner: der vollkommene Nous,'\" OriensChristianus 59 (1975) 78-107.Thunder, Perfect Mind (NHC VI,2) presents the revelation discourse of a female divinity who speaks alternately in first-person statements of identity (\"I AM\") and second-person address. The text's parallelism of structure, together with itsextensive use of antithesis, paradox, and other literary devices, point clearly to its poetic or hymnic character. B. Laytonhas argued persuasively that the paradoxical and often outrageous pairing of antithetical terms in the \"I AM\" statements- 174 -"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"of Thunder can be read as a complex identity riddle to be solved by the knowing or \"gnostic\" reader. At the same time,attention to various features of the text as a whole suggests that it is not only the mystery of the speaker's identity, butthe relationship between the divine speaker and her human hearers that forms the exegetical crux of the text. Thunder focuses attention on the hearers' relationship to the divine speaker not only through its alternating structure offirst-person proclamation and second-person address, but also through its metaphorical imagery of kinship and gender,its references to the audience's responses to the divine, and its claims about the speaker's role in the operations oflanguage and intellect. Its persistent, uncompromising use of paradox pushes its hearers to relinquish the apparentsense of its words and to seek the hidden meaning of individual utterances and of the discourse as a whole. Finally, bylocating the divine in the \"voice\" and \"hearing\" of the text, it leads its hearers or readers to find the divine within the textand within themselves, and so to discover themselves within the divine. In such an interpretive movement of letting goand finding, of becoming sober and being found, the text's final words suggest, the reader \"goes up\" to the salvific \"placeof rest,\" \"finds\" the divine persona revealed in the text, and \"enters into\" a state of living and not dying again. Thunder's conception of salvation does not conform to the more familiar \"Gnostic\" image of a transformative movementor `conversion' from blindness to vision, deficiency to fullness, or ignorance to gnosis. Rather, Thunder presents anunderstanding of salvation that comes through the interpretive process of grappling with the language of the text andconfronting the paradoxical nature of the divine within the antitheses of ignorance and gnosis, weakness and power,shame and honor, death and life. At the same time, Thunder forges a sharp distinction between those who merely hearthe words of the text and those who hear the divine voice with gnosis, that is, between those who remain ignorant andthose who come to know the divine in the fullness of her complexity and mystery. Those who hear the utterances ofThunder with gnosis enter into salvific relation with the divine through the interchange of divine utterance and divinehearing, manifested within the symbolic world of the text and within themselves. \"Thunder, Perfect Mind\" may thus beinterpreted not only as a title for the text, but as a name for the divine speaker, her thundering utterances, and her placeof dwelling within those who hear her voice and know her mystery with the salvific gnosis and hearing of perfect mind.Setting in Ancient Mediterranean ReligionsWhile Thunder resembles many other ancient texts in various ways, its distinctive combination of features is virtuallyunmatched in the religious and philosophical literature of antiquity. In form, Thunder's first-person proclamations ofidentity (\"I AM\") parallel most directly the aretalogies of the goddess Isis. Yet the text's alternation between first-personidentity statements and second-person address bring it closer to the form of the philosophical sermon or diatribe,familiar from the monologues of biblical Wisdom (e.g., Prov 8, Sir 24, Wis 7-8, 1 Enoch 42). In addition, Thundercombines these literary modes with rhetorical features, such as paradox and antithesis, which are more characteristic ofthe Greek riddle. In content as well as form, the closest parallels to Thunder are found in the hymnic speeches of female divinities in otherNag Hammadi texts, especially those of Pronoia (in Ap. John II,1:30,11-31,28); Protennoia (throughout Trim. Prot. XIII,1);Sophia Zoe, the \"Eve of Life\" (in Orig. World II,5:114,8-15); and the spiritual Eve in The Gospel of Eve (Epiph., Pan.26.3.1). Yet unlike most of these divine discourses, the utterances of Thunder have no narrative or epistolary setting.They appear as unmediated divine speech, addressed directly from the divine to her human hearers or readers.There is no general scholarly consensus on the social or historical setting of Thunder. While scholars agree that the textexhibits no explicitly Jewish or Christian elements, its imagery resonates with a variety of sources, including Jewish andChristian Wisdom, Isis traditions, Middle Platonism, Stoicism, and with other Nag Hammadi texts, especially thosedesignated \"Sethian\" and \"Valentinian.\" Thunder may profitably be read in relation to all of these texts and traditions asa revisionary poetic work that puts forward a distinctive perspective on the nature of the divine and her relation tohumankind. Language, Date, Author, Provenance, and ManuscriptThunder, Perfect Mind exists only in the Coptic version found at Nag Hammadi (NHC VI,2:13,1-21,32). The author, date,and place of composition are unknown, but a cultural milieu like that of second- or third-century Alexandria isplausible. In any case, it is clear that the text was originally composed in Greek well before 350 C.E., the approximatedate of the Coptic manuscript. The surviving text is relatively well preserved, with minor damage near the top of thefirst four pages (13-16) and somewhat more serious damage on the first ten lines of the remaining manuscript pages (17-21).- 175 -"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"A u t h o r i t a t i v e T e a c h i n gCODEX VITranslated by George W.

From these the invisible soul of righteousness came,being a fellow member, and a fellow body, and a fellow spirit.

He presented it to her mouth to make her eat it like food, andhe applied the word to her eyes as a medicine to make her see with her mind and perceive herkinsmen and learn about her root, in order that she might cling to her branch from which she hadfirst come forth, in order that she might receive what is hers and renounce matter.

So therefore the body camefrom lust, and lust came from material substance. For this reason the soul became a brother tothem. And yet they are outsiders, without power to inherit from the male, but they will inherit fromtheir mother only.

We have nothing in this world, lest the authorityof the world that has come into being should detain us in the worlds that are in the heavens, thosein which universal death exists, surrounded by the individual [...] worldly. We have also becomeashamed of the worlds, though we take no interest in them when they malign us. And we ignorethem when they curse us. When they cast shame in our face, we look at them and do not speak. For they work at their business, but we go about in hunger (and) in thirst, looking toward ourdwelling-place, the place which our conduct and our conscience look toward, not clinging to thethings which have come into being, but withdrawing from them. Our hearts are set on the thingsthat exist, though we are ill (and) feeble (and) in pain. But there is a great strength hidden withinus. Our soul indeed is ill because she dwells in a house of poverty, while matter strikes blows at hereyes, wishing to make her blind. For this reason she pursues the word and applies it to her eyes asa medicine <opening> them, casting away [...] thought of a [...] blindness in [...] afterwards, whenthat one is again in ignorance, he is completely darkened and is material. Thus the soul [...] a wordevery hour, to apply it to her eyes as a medicine in order that she may see, and her light mayconceal the hostile forces that fight with her, and she may make them blind with her light, andenclose them in her presence, and make them fall down in sleeplessness, and she may act boldlywith her strength and with her scepter. While her enemies look at her in shame, she runs upward into her treasure-house - the one inwhich her mind is - and (into) her storehouse which is secure, since nothing among the things thathave come into being has seized her, nor has she received a stranger into her house. For many areher homeborn ones who fight against her by day and by night, having no rest by day or by night,for their lust oppresses them. For this reason, then, we do not sleep, nor do we forget the nets that are spread out in hiding,lying in wait for us to catch us. For if we are caught in a single net, it will suck us down into itsmouth, while the water flows over us, striking our face. And we will be taken down into thedragnet, and we will not be able to come up from it, because the waters are high over us, flowingfrom above downward, submerging our heart down in the filthy mud. And we will not be able toescape from them. For man-eaters will seize us and swallow us, rejoicing like a fisherman castinga hook into the water. For he casts many kinds of food into the water because each one of the fishhas his own food. He smells it and pursues its odor. But when he eats it, the hook hidden withinthe food seizes him and brings him up by force out of the deep waters. No man is able, then, tocatch that fish down in the deep waters, except for the trap that the fisherman sets. By the ruse offood he brought the fish up on the hook. In this very way we exist in this world, like fish. The adversary spies on us, lying in wait for uslike a fisherman, wishing to seize us, rejoicing that he might swallow us. For he places many foodsbefore our eyes (things) which belong to this world. He wishes to make us desire one of them andto taste only a little, so that he may seize us with his hidden poison and bring us out of freedomand take us into slavery. For whenever he catches us with a single food, it is indeed necessary forus to desire the rest. Finally, then, such things become the food of death. Now these are the foods with which the devil lies in wait for us. First he injects a pain into yourheart until you have heartache on account of a small thing of this life, and he seizes (you) with hispoisons. And afterward (he injects) the desire of a tunic, so that you will pride yourself in it, andlove of money, pride, vanity, envy that rivals another envy, beauty of body, fraudulence. Thegreatest of all these are ignorance and ease. Now all such things the adversary prepares beautifully and spreads out before the body, wishingto make the mind of the soul incline her toward one of them and overwhelm her, like a hook,drawing her by force in ignorance, deceiving her until she conceives evil, and bears fruit of matter,and conducts herself in uncleanness, pursuing many desires, covetousnesses, while fleshlypleasure draws her in ignorance. - 177 -"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"But the soul - she who has tasted these things - realized that sweet passions are transitory. She hadlearned about evil; she went away from them and she entered into a new conduct. Afterwards shedespises this life, because it is transitory. And she looks for those foods that will take her into life,and leaves behind her those deceitful foods. And she learns about her light, as she goes aboutstripping off this world, while her true garment clothes her within, (and) her bridal clothing isplaced upon her in beauty of mind, not in pride of flesh. And she learns about her depth and runsinto her fold, while her shepherd stands at the door. In return for all the shame and scorn, then,that she received in this world, she receives ten thousand times the grace and glory. She gave the body to those who had given it to her, and they were ashamed, while the dealers inbodies sat down and wept because they were not able to do any business with that body, nor didthey find any (other) merchandise except it. They endured great labors until they had shaped thebody of this soul, wishing to strike down the invisible soul. They were therefore ashamed of theirwork; they suffered the loss of the one for whom they had endured labors. They did not realizethat she has an invisible spiritual body, thinking, \"We are her shepherd who feeds her.\" But theydid not realize that she knows another way, which is hidden from them. This her true shepherdtaught her in knowledge. But these - the ones who are ignorant - do not seek after God. Nor do they inquire about theirdwelling-place, which exists in rest, but they go about in bestiality. They are more wicked than thepagans, because first of all they do not inquire about God, for their hardness of heart draws themdown to make them their cruelty. Furthermore, if they find someone else who asks about hissalvation, their hardness of heart sets to work upon that man. And if he does not stop asking, theykill him by their cruelty, thinking that they have done a good thing for themselves. Indeed they are sons of the devil! For even pagans give charity, and they know that God who is inthe heavens exists, the Father of the universe, exalted over their idols, which they worship. Butthey have not heard the word, that they should inquire about his ways. Thus the senseless manhears the call, but he is ignorant of the place to which he has been called. And he did not askduring the preaching, \"Where is the temple into which I should go and worship my hope?\" On account of his senselessness, then, he is worse than a pagan, for the pagans know the way togo to their stone temple, which will perish, and they worship their idol, while their hearts are seton it because it is their hope. But to this senseless man the word has been preached, teaching him,\"Seek and inquire about the ways you should go, since there is nothing else that is as good as thisthing.\" The result is that the substance of hardness of heart strikes a blow upon his mind, alongwith the force of ignorance and the demon of error. They do not allow his mind to rise up, becausehe was wearying himself in seeking that he might learn about his hope. But the rational soul who (also) wearied herself in seeking - she learned about God. She laboredwith inquiring, enduring distress in the body, wearing out her feet after the evangelists, learningabout the Inscrutable One. She found her rising. She came to rest in him who is at rest. Shereclined in the bride-chamber. She ate of the banquet for which she had hungered. She partook ofthe immortal food. She found what she had sought after. She received rest from her labors, whilethe light that shines forth upon her does not sink. To it belongs the glory and the power and therevelation for ever and ever. Amen.

But you will see me, and you will prepare your dwelling places in our greatPower. Know how what has departed came to be, in order that you may know how to discern what livesto become: of what appearance that aeon is, or what kind it is, or how it will come to be. Why doyou not ask what kind you will become, (or) rather how you came to be? Discern what size the water is, that it is immeasurable (and) incomprehensible, both its beginningand its end. It supports the earth; it blows in the air where the gods and the angels are. But in himwho is exalted above all these there is the fear and the light, and in him are my writings revealed. Ihave given them as a service to the creation of the physical things, for it is not possible for anyoneto stand without that One, nor is it possible for the aeon to live without him. It is he who possesseswhat is in him by discerning (it) in purity. Then behold the Spirit and know where he is. He gave himself to men that they may receive lifefrom him every day, since he has his life within him; he gives to them all. Then the darkness together with Hades took the fire. And he (the darkness) will release fromhimself what is mine. His eyes were not able to endure my light. After the spirits and the watersmoved, the remainder came into being: the whole aeon of the creation, and their <powers>. Thefire came forth from them and the Power came in the midst of the powers. And the powersdesired to see my image. And the soul became its replica. This is the work that came into being. See what it is like, that before it comes into being it does notsee, because the aeon of the flesh came to be in the great bodies. And there were apportioned tothem long days in the creation. For when they had polluted themselves and had entered into theflesh, the father of the flesh, the water, avenged himself. For when he had found that Noah waspious (and) worthy - and it is the father of the flesh who holds the angels in subjection. And he(Noah) preached piety for one hundred and twenty years. And no one listened to him. And hemade a wooden ark, and whom he had found entered it. And the flood took place. And thus Noah was saved with his sons. For if indeed the ark had not been meant for man toenter, then the water of the flood would not have come. In this way he intended (and) planned tosave the gods and the angels, and the powers, the greatness of all of these, and the <nourishment>and the way of life. And he moves them from the aeon (and) nourishes them in the permanentplaces. And the judgment of the flesh was unleashed. Only the work of the Power stood up. Next the psychic aeon. It is a small one, which is mixed with bodies, by begetting in the souls(and) defiling (them). For the first defilement of the creation found strength.

She brought the fire upon the soul and the earth, and sheburned all <the> dwellings that are in it. And its shepherd perished. Moreover, when she does notfind anything else to burn, she will destroy herself. And it will become incorporeal, without body,and it will burn matter, until it has cleansed everything, - and all wickedness. For when it does notfind anything else to burn, it will turn against itself until it has destroyed itself. Then, in this aeon, which is the psychic one, the man will come into being who knows the greatPower. He will receive (me) and he will know me. He will drink from the milk of the mother, infact. He will speak in parables; he will proclaim the aeon that is to come, just as he spoke in thefirst aeon of the flesh, as Noah. Now concerning his words, which he uttered, he spoke in all ofthem, in seventy-two tongues. And he opened the gates of the heavens with his words. And heput to shame the ruler of Hades; he raised the dead, and he destroyed his dominion. Then a great disturbance took place. The archons raised up their wrath against him. They wantedto hand him over to the ruler of Hades. Then they recognized one of his followers. A fire took holdof his soul. He (Judas?) handed him over, since no one knew him (Jesus?). They acted and seizedhim. They brought judgment upon themselves. And they delivered him up to the ruler of Hades.And they handed him over to Sasabek for nine bronze coins. He prepared himself to go down andput them to shame. Then the ruler of Hades took him. And he found that the nature of his fleshcould not be seized, in order to show it to the archons. But he was saying: \"Who is this? What is it?His word has abolished the law of the aeon. He is from the Logos of the power of life.\" And hewas victorious over the command of the archons, and they were not able by their work to ruleover him. The archons searched after that which had come to pass. They did not know that this is the sign oftheir dissolution, and (that) it is the change of the aeon. The sun set during the day; that daybecame dark. The evil spirits were troubled. And after these things he will appear ascending. Andthe sign of the aeon that is to come will appear. And the aeons will dissolve. And those who would know these things that were discussed with them, will become blessed.And they will reveal them, and they will become blessed, since they will come to know the truth.For you have found rest in the heavens. Then many will follow him, and they will labor in their birthplaces. They will go about; they willwrite down his words according to (their) desire. Behold, these aeons have passed. What size is the water of the aeon that has dissolved? Whatdimensions do aeons have? How will men prepare themselves, and how will they be established,and how will they become indestructible aeons? But at first, after his preaching - it is he who proclaims the second aeon, and the first. And the firstaeon perished in the course of time. He made the first aeon, going about in it until it perished,while preaching one hundred and twenty years in number. This is the perfect number that ishighly exalted. He made the border of the West desolate, and he destroyed the East. Then yourseed and those who wish to follow our great Logos and his proclamation - [...] Then the wrath of the archons burned.

Moreover, the birds ateand were filled with their dead. The earth mourned together with the inhabited world; theybecame desolate.

And he changed the commands. Then the timecame until the child had grown up. When he had come to his maturity, then the archons sent theimitator to that man in order that they might know our great Power. And they were expectingfrom him that he would perform for them a sign. And he bore great signs. And he reigned overthe whole earth and all those who are under heaven. He placed his throne upon the end of theearth, for \"I shall make you god of the world\".

For when thesemen reaches the climax, it leaps forth. In that moment, the female receives the strength of themale; the male, for his part, receives the strength of the female, while the semen does this. \"Therefore, the mystery of intercourse is performed in secret, in order that the two sexes might notdisgrace themselves in front of many who do not experience that reality. For each of them (thesexes) contributes its (own part in) begetting. For if it happens in the presence of those who do notunderstand the reality, (it is) laughable and unbelievable. And, moreover, they are holy mysteries,of both words and deeds, because not only are they not heard, but also they are not seen. \"Therefore, such people (the unbelievers) are blasphemers. They are atheistic and impious. But theothers are not many; rather, the pious who are counted are few. Therefore, wickedness remainsamong (the) many, since learning concerning the things which are ordained does not exist amongthem. For the knowledge of the things which are ordained is truly the healing of the passions ofthe matter. Therefore, learning is something derived from knowledge. \"But if there is ignorance, and learning does not exist in the soul of man, (then) the incurablepassions persist in it (the soul). And additional evil comes with them (the passions), in the form ofan incurable sore. And the sore constantly gnaws at the soul, and through it the soul producesworms from the evil, and stinks. But God is not the cause of these things, since he sent to menknowledge and learning. \"Trismegistus, did he send them to men alone?\"\"Yes, Asclepius, he sent them to them alone. And it is fitting that we tell you why to men alone hegranted knowledge and learning, the allotment of his good. \"And now listen! God and the Father, even the Lord, created man subsequent to the gods, and hetook him from the region of matter. Since matter is involved in the creation of man, of [...], thepassions are in it. Therefore, they continually flow over his body, for this living creature wouldnot have existed in any other way except that he had taken this food, since he is mortal. It is alsoinevitable that inopportune desires, which are harmful, dwell in him. For the gods, since theycame into being out of a pure matter, do not need learning and knowledge. For the immortality ofthe gods is learning and knowledge, since they came into being out of pure matter. It(immortality) assumed for them the position of knowledge and learning. By necessity, he (God)set a boundary for man; he placed him in learning and knowledge. \"Concerning these things (learning and knowledge) which we have mentioned from thebeginning, he (God) perfected them in order that by means of these things he might restrainpassions and evils, according to his will. He brought his (man's) mortal existence into immortality;he (man) became good (and) immortal, just as I have said. For he (God) created (a) two-fold naturefor him: the immortal and the mortal.\"And it happened this way because of the will of God that men be better than the gods, since,indeed, the gods are immortal, but men alone are both immortal and mortal. Therefore, man hasbecome akin to the gods, and they know the affairs of each other with certainty. The gods knowthe things of men, and men know the things of the gods.

Now it is clearto us concerning the race of the gods, and we confess it along with everyone else, that it (the raceof the gods) has come into being out of a pure matter. And their bodies are heads only. But thatwhich men create is the likeness of the gods.

For I exist with allthe greatness of the Spirit, which is a friend to us and our kindred alike, since I brought forth aword to the glory of our Father, through his goodness, as well as an imperishable thought; that is,the Word within him - it is slavery that we shall die with Christ - and an imperishable andundefiled thought, an incomprehensible marvel, the writing of the ineffable water which is theword from us. It is I who am in you, and you are in me, just as the Father is in you in innocence. Let us gather an assembly together. Let us visit that creation of his. Let us send someone forth in it,just as he visited (the) Ennoias, the regions below. And I said these things to the whole multitudeof the multitudinous assembly of the rejoicing Majesty. The whole house of the Father of Truthrejoiced that I am the one who is from them. I produced thought about the Ennoias which cameout of the undefiled Spirit, about the descent upon the water, that is, the regions below. And theyall had a single mind, since it is out of one. They charged me since I was willing. I came forth toreveal the glory to my kindred and my fellow spirits. For those who were in the world had been prepared by the will of our sister Sophia - she who is awhore - because of the innocence which has not been uttered. And she did not ask anything fromthe All, nor from the greatness of the Assembly, nor from the Pleroma. Since she was first, shecame forth to prepare monads and places for the Son of Light and the fellow workers which shetook from the elements below to build bodily dwellings from them. But, having come into being inan empty glory, they ended in destruction in the dwellings in which they were, since they wereprepared by Sophia. They stand ready to receive the life-giving word of the ineffable Monad andof the greatness of the assembly of all those who persevere and those who are in me. I visited a bodily dwelling. I cast out the one who was in it first, and I went in. And the wholemultitude of the archons became troubled. And all the matter of the archons, as well as all thebegotten powers of the earth, were shaken when it saw the likeness of the Image, since it wasmixed. And I am the one who was in it, not resembling him who was in it first. For he was anearthly man, but I, I am from above the heavens. I did not refuse them even to become a Christ,but I did not reveal myself to them in the love which was coming forth from me. I revealed that Iam a stranger to the regions below. There was a great disturbance in the whole earthly area, with confusion and flight, as well as (in)the plan of the archons. And some were persuaded, when they saw the wonders which werebeing accomplished by me. And all these, with the race, that came down, flee from him who hadfled from the throne to the Sophia of hope, since she had earlier given the sign concerning us andall the ones with me - those of the race of Adonaios. Others also fled, as if from the Cosmocratorand those with them, since they have brought every (kind of) punishment upon me. And therewas a flight of their mind about what they would counsel concerning me, thinking that she(Sophia) is the whole greatness, and speaking false witness, moreover, against the Man and thewhole greatness of the assembly. It was not possible for them to know who the Father of Truth, the Man of the Greatness, is.

But they, the archons, those of the place of Yaldabaoth, reveal the realm ofthe angels, which humanity was seeking in order that they may not know the Man of Truth.

For without those who were offeringpraise - I did not really die lest their archangel become empty. And then a voice - of the Cosmocrator - came to the angels: \"I am God and there is no other besideme.\" But I laughed joyfully when I examined his empty glory. But he went on to say, \"Who isman?\" And the entire host of his angels, who had seen Adam and his dwelling, were laughing athis smallness. And thus did their Ennoia come to be removed outside the Majesty of the heavens,i.e.,the Man of Truth, whose name they saw since he is in a small dwelling place, since they aresmall (and) senseless in their empty Ennoia, namely their laughter. It was contagion for them. The whole greatness of the Fatherhood of the Spirit was at rest in his places. And I am he who waswith him, since I have an Ennoia of a single emanation from the eternal ones and the undefiledand immeasurable incomprehensibilities. I placed the small Ennoia in the world, having disturbedthem and frightened the whole multitude of the angels and their ruler. And I was visiting them allwith fire and flame because of my Ennoia. And everything pertaining to them was brought aboutbecause of me. And there came about a disturbance and a fight around the Seraphim andCherubim, since their glory will fade, and the confusion around Adonaios on both sides and theirdwelling - to the Cosmocrator and him who said, \"Let us seize him''; others again, \"The plan willcertainly not materialize.'' For Adonaios knows me because of hope. And I was in the mouths of lions.

Those who were there punished me. And I did notdie in reality but in appearance, lest I be put to shame by them because these are my kinsfolk. Iremoved the shame from me and I did not become fainthearted in the face of what happened tome at their hands. I was about to succumb to fear, and I <suffered> according to their sight andthought, in order that they may never find any word to speak about them. For my death, whichthey think happened, (happened) to them in their error and blindness, since they nailed their manunto their death. For their Ennoias did not see me, for they were deaf and blind. But in doing thesethings, they condemn themselves. Yes, they saw me; they punished me. It was another, theirfather, who drank the gall and the vinegar; it was not I. They struck me with the reed; it wasanother, Simon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. I was another upon Whom they placed thecrown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height over all the wealth of the archons and theoffspring of their error, of their empty glory. And I was laughing at their ignorance. And I subjected all their powers. For as I came downward, no one saw me. For I was altering myshapes, changing from form to form. And therefore, when I was at their gates, I assumed theirlikeness. For I passed them by quietly, and I was viewing the places, and I was not afraid norashamed, for I was undefiled. And I was speaking with them, mingling with them through thosewho are mine, and trampling on those who are harsh to them with zeal, and quenching the flame.And I was doing all these things because of my desire to accomplish what I desired by the will ofthe Father above. And the Son of the Majesty, who was hidden in the regions below, we brought to the height whereI <was> in all these aeons with them, which (height) no one has seen nor known, where thewedding of the wedding robe is, the new one and not the old, nor does it perish.

For the soul, the one from theheight, will not speak about the error which is here, nor transfer from these aeons, since it will betransferred when it becomes free and when it is endowed with nobility in the world, standingbefore the Father without weariness and fear, always mixed with the Nous of power (and) ofform. They will see me from every side without hatred. For since they see me, they are being seen(and) are mixed with them. Since they did not put me to shame, they were not put to shame.

It was a trembling which seized thechaos of the earth, for the souls which were in the sleep below were released. And they arose.They went about boldly, having shed zealous service of ignorance and unlearnedness beside thedead tombs, having put on the new man, since they have come to know that perfect Blessed Oneof the eternal and incomprehensible Father and the infinite light, which is I, since I came to myown and united them with myself. There is no need for many words, for our Ennoia was withtheir Ennoia. Therefore they knew what I speak of, for we took counsel about the destruction ofthe archons. And therefore I did the will of the Father, who is I.

Butin the uprightness of our love we are innocent, pure, (and) good, since we have a mind of theFather in an ineffable mystery. For it was ludicrous. It is I who bear witness that it was ludicrous, since the archons do not knowthat it is an ineffable union of undefiled truth, as exists among the sons of light, of which theymade an imitation, having proclaimed a doctrine of a dead man and lies so as to resemble thefreedom and purity of the perfect assembly, (and) <joining> themselves with their doctrine to fearand slavery, worldly cares, and abandoned worship, being small (and) ignorant, since they do notcontain the nobility of the truth, for they hate the one in whom they are, and love the one in whomthey are not. For they did not know the Knowledge of the Greatness, that it is from above and(from) a fountain of truth, and that it is not from slavery and jealousy, fear and love of worldlymatter. For that which is not theirs and that which is theirs they use fearlessly and freely. They donot desire, because they have authority, and a law from themselves over whatever they will wish. But those who have not are poor, that is, those who do not possess him. And they desire him andlead astray those, who through them have become like those who possess the truth of theirfreedom, just as they bought us for servitude and constraint of care and fear. This person is inslavery. And he who is brought by constraint of force and threat has been guarded by God. Butthe entire nobility of the Fatherhood is not guarded, since he guards only him who is from him,without word and constraint, since he is united with his will, he who belongs only to the Ennoiaof the Fatherhood, to make it Perfect and ineffable through the living water, to be with youmutually in wisdom, not only in word of hearing but in deed and fulfilled word. For the perfectones are worthy to be established in this way and to be united with me, in order that they may notshare in any enmity, in a good friendship.

But he who lives in harmony and friendship of brotherly love, naturally and notartificially, completely and not partially, this person is truly the desire of the Father. He is theuniversal one and perfect love. For Adam was a laughingstock, since he was made a counterfeit type of man by the Hebdomad, asif he had become stronger than I and my brothers. We are innocent with respect to him, since wehave not sinned. And Abraham and Isaac and Jacob were a laughingstock, since they, thecounterfeit fathers, were given a name by the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I andmy brothers. We are innocent with respect to him, since we have not sinned.

But we are- 194 -"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"innocent with respect to him; we have not sinned. Solomon was a laughingstock, since he thoughtthat he was Christ, having become vain through the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger thanI and my brothers. But we are innocent with respect to him. I have not sinned. The 12 prophetswere laughingstocks, since they have come forth as imitations of the true prophets. They came intobeing as counterfeits through the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and mybrothers. But we are innocent with respect to him, since we have not sinned. Moses, a faithfulservant, was a laughingstock, having been named \"the Friend,\" since they perversely bore witnessconcerning him who never knew me. Neither he nor those before him, from Adam to Moses andJohn the Baptist, none of them knew me nor my brothers. For they had a doctrine of angels to observe dietary laws and bitter slavery, since they never knewtruth, nor will they know it. For there is a great deception upon their soul, making it impossiblefor them ever to find a Nous of freedom in order to know him, until they come to know the Son ofMan. Now concerning my Father, I am he whom the world did not know, and because of this, it(the world) rose up against me and my brothers. But we are innocent with respect to him; we havenot sinned. For the Archon was a laughingstock because he said, \"I am God, and there is none greater than I. Ialone am the Father, the Lord, and there is no other beside me. I am a jealous God, who brings thesins of the fathers upon the children for three and four generations.\" As if he had become strongerthan I and my brothers! But we are innocent with respect to him, in that we have not sinned, sincewe mastered his teaching. Thus he was in an empty glory. And he does not agree with our Father.And thus through our fellowship we grasped his teaching, since he was vain in an empty glory.And he does not agree with our Father, for he was a laughingstock and judgment and falseprophecy. O those who do not see, you do not see your blindness, i.e., this which was not known, nor has itever been known, nor has it been known about him. They did not listen to firm obedience.Therefore they proceeded in a judgment of error, and they raised their defiled and murderoushands against him, as if they were beating the air. And the senseless and blind ones are alwayssenseless, always being slaves of law and earthly fear. I am Christ, the Son of Man, the one from you who is among you. I am despised for your sake, inorder that you yourselves may forget the difference. And do not become female, lest you givebirth to evil and (its) brothers: jealousy and division, anger and wrath, fear and a divided heart,and empty, non-existent desire. But I am an ineffable mystery to you. Then before the foundation of the world, when the whole multitude of the Assembly cametogether upon the places of the Ogdoad, when they had taken counsel about a spiritual weddingwhich is in union, and thus he was perfected in the ineffable places by a living word, theundefiled wedding was consummated through the Mesotes of Jesus, who inhabits them all andpossesses them, who abides in an undivided love of power. And surrounding him, he appears tohim as a Monad of all these, a thought and a father, since he is one. And he stands by them all,since he as a whole came forth alone. And he is life, since he came from the Father of ineffable andperfect Truth, (the father) of those who are there, the union of Peace and a friend of good things,and life eternal and undefiled joy, in a great harmony of life and faith, through eternal life offatherhood and motherhood and sisterhood and rational wisdom. They had agreed with Nous,who stretches out (and) will stretch out in joyful union and is trustworthy and faithfully listens tosomeone. And he is in fatherhood and motherhood and rational brotherhood and wisdom. Andthis is a wedding of truth, and a repose of incorruption, in a spirit of truth, in every mind, and aperfect light in an unnameable mystery. But this is not, nor will it happen among us in any regionor place in division and breach of peace, but (in) union and a mixture of love, all of which areperfected in the one who is. It also happened in the places under heaven for their reconciliation. Those who knew me insalvation and undividedness, and those who existed for the glory of the father and the truth,having been separated, blended into the one through the living word. And I am in the spirit andthe truth of the motherhood, just as he has been there; I was among those who are united in the- 195 -"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"friendship of friends forever, who neither know hostility at all, nor evil, but who are united by myKnowledge in word and peace which exists in perfection with everyone and in them all.

O unseeing ones, why did you not know the mystery rightly? But the archons around Yaldabaoth were disobedient because of the Ennoia who went down tohim from her sister Sophia. They made for themselves a union with those who were with them ina mixture of a fiery cloud, which was their Envy, and the rest who were brought forth by theircreatures, as if they had bruised the noble pleasure of the Assembly. And therefore they revealed amixture of ignorance in a counterfeit of fire and earth and a murderer, since they are small anduntaught, without knowledge having dared these things, and not having understood that lighthas fellowship with light, and darkness with darkness, and the corruptible with the perishable,and the imperishable with the incorruptible. Now these things I have presented to you - I am Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, who is exaltedabove the heavens - O perfect and incorruptible ones, because of the incorruptible and perfectmystery and the ineffable one. But they think that we decreed them before the foundation of theworld, in order that, when we emerge from the places of the world, we may present there thesymbols of incorruption from the spiritual union unto knowledge. You do not know it, becausethe fleshly cloud overshadows you. But I alone am the friend of Sophia. I have been in the bosomof the father from the beginning, in the place of the sons of the truth, and the Greatness. Rest thenwith me, my fellow spirits and my brothers, forever.

He has now appeared among these,in him who appeared, who is the Son of Man, who is exalted above the heavens in a fear of men oflike essence. But you yourself, Peter, become perfect in accordance with your name with myself,the one who chose you, because from you I have established a base for the remnant whom I havesummoned to knowledge.

And he said to me, \"Peter, I have told you many times that they are blind ones who have no guide.If you want to know their blindness, put your hands upon (your) eyes - your robe - and say whatyou see.\" But when I had done it, I did not see anything. I said \"No one sees (this way).\" Again he told me, \"Do it again.\" And there came in me fear with joy, for I saw a new light greater than the light of day. Then itcame down upon the Savior. And I told him about those things which I saw. And he said to me again, \"Lift up your hands and listen to what the priests and the people aresaying.\" And I listened to the priests as they sat with the scribes. The multitudes were shouting with theirvoice. When he heard these things from me he said to me, \"Prick up your ears and listen to the thingsthey are saying.\" And I listened again, \"As you sit, they are praising you\".

For the place from which each of them is produces that whichis like itself; for not every soul is of the truth, nor of immortality. For every soul of these ages hasdeath assigned to it in our view, because it is always a slave, since it is created for its desires andtheir eternal destruction, in which they are and from which they are. They love the creatures of thematter which came forth with them.\" \"But the immortal souls are not like these, O Peter. But indeed, as long as the hour is not yet come,it (the immortal soul) shall resemble a mortal one. But it shall not reveal its nature, that it alone isthe immortal one, and thinks about immortality, having faith, and desiring to renounce thesethings.\"\"For people do not gather figs from thorns or from thorn trees, if they are wise, nor grapes fromthistles.

Do not trust anyone as a friend, for this whole world has come into being deceitfully, and everyman is troubled in vain. All things of the world are not profitable, but they happen in vain. Thereis no one, not even a brother (who is trustworthy), since each one is seeking his own advantage. My son, do not have anyone as a friend, but if you do acquire one, do not entrust yourself to him.Entrust yourself to God alone as father and as friend. For everyone proceeds deceitfully, while thewhole earth is full of suffering and pain - things in which there is no profit. If you wish to passyour life in quiet, do not keep company with anyone. And if you do keep company with them, beas if you do not. Be pleasing to God, and you will not need anyone. Live with Christ and he will save you. For he is the true light and the sun of life. For just as the sunwhich is visible and makes light for the eyes of the flesh, so Christ illuminates every mind and theheart. For (if) a wicked man (who is) in the body (has) an evil death, how much more so (does) hewho has his mind blind. For every blind man goes along in such a way that he is seen just as onewho does not have his mind sane. He does not delight in acquiring the light of Christ, which isreason. For everything which is visible is a copy of that which is hidden. For as a fire which burns in aplace without being confined to it, so it is with the sun which is in the sky, all of whose raysextend to places on the earth. Similarly, Christ has a single being, and he gives light to every place.This is also the way in which he speaks of our mind, as if it were a lamp which burns and lightsup the place. (Being) in a part of the soul, it gives light to all the parts. Furthermore, I shall speak of what is more exalted than this: the mind, with respect to actualbeing, is in a place, which means it is in the body; but with respect to thought, the mind is not in aplace. For how can it be in a place, when it contemplates every place? But we are able to mention what is more exalted than this: for do not think in your heart that Godexists in a place. If you localize the Lord of all in a place, then it is fitting for you to say that theplace is more exalted than he who dwells in it. For that which contains is more exalted than thatwhich is contained. For there is no place which is called incorporeal. For it is not right for us to saythat God is corporeal. For the consequence (would be) that we (must) attribute both increase anddecrease to the corporeal, but also that he (God) who is subject to these will not remainimperishable. Now, it is not difficult to know the Creator of all creatures, but it is impossible to comprehend thelikeness of this One. For it is difficult not only for men to comprehend God, but it is (also) difficultfor every divine being, (both) the angels and the archangels. It is necessary to know God as he is.You cannot know God through anyone except Christ, who has the image of the Father, for thisimage reveals the true likeness in correspondence to that which is revealed. A king is not usuallyknown apart from an image. Consider these things about God: he is in every place; on the other hand, he is in no place. Withrespect to power, to be sure, he is in every place; but with respect to divinity, he is in no place. Sothen, it is possible to know God a little. With respect to his power, he fills every place, but in theexaltation of his divinity, nothing contains him. Everything is in God, but God is not in anything. Now what is it to know God? God is all which is in the truth. But it is as impossible to look atChrist as at the sun. God sees everyone; no one looks at him. But Christ, without being jealous,receives and gives. He is the Light of the Father, as he gives light without being jealous. In thismanner he gives light to every place. And all is Christ, he who has inherited all from the Existent One. For Christ is the idea ofincorruptibility, and he is the Light which is shining undefiled. For the sun (shines) on everyimpure place, and yet it is not defiled. So it is with Christ: even if he is in the deficiency, yet he iswithout deficiency. And even if he has been begotten, he is (still) unbegotten. So it is with Christ:- 203 -"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"if, on the one hand, he is comprehensible, on the other, he is incomprehensible with respect to hisactual being. Christ is all. He who does not possess all is unable to know Christ. My son, do not dare to say a word about this One, and do not confine the God of all to mentalimages. For he who condemns may not be condemned by the one who condemns. Indeed, it isgood to ask and to know who God is. Reason and mind are male names. Indeed, let him whowishes to know about this One, quietly and reverently ask. For there is no small danger inspeaking about these things, since you know that you will be judged on the basis of everythingthat you say. And understand by this that he who is in darkness will not be able to see anything unless hereceives the light and recovers (his) sight by means of it. Examine yourself (to see) whether youwholly have the light, so that, if you ask about these things, you may understand how you willescape. For many are seeking in darkness, and they grope about, wishing to understand, sincethere is no light for them. My son, do not allow your mind to stare downward, but rather, let it look by means of the light atthings above. For the light will always come from above. Even if it (the mind) is upon the earth, letit seek to pursue the things above. Enlighten your mind with the light of heaven, so that you mayturn to the light of heaven. Do not tire of knocking on the door of reason, and do not cease walking in the way of Christ. Walkin it so that you may receive rest from your labors. If you walk in another way, there will be noprofit in it. For also those who walk in the broad way will go down at their end to the perdition ofthe mire. For the Underworld is open wide for the soul, and the place of perdition is broad. AcceptChrist, the narrow way. For he is oppressed and bears affliction for your sin. O soul, persistent one, in what ignorance you exist! For who is your guide into the darkness? Howmany likenesses did Christ take on because of you! Although he was God, he was found amongmen as a man. He descended to the Underworld. He released the children of death. They were intravail, as the scripture of God has said. And he sealed up the (very) heart of it (the Underworld).And he broke its (the Underworld's) strong bows completely. And when all the powers had seenhim, they fled, so that he might bring you, wretched one, up from the Abyss, and might die foryou as a ransom for your sin. He saved you from the strong hand of the Underworld. But you, yourself, difficult (though it be) give to him your fundamental assent with (even so muchas) a hint that he may take you up with joy! Now the fundamental choice, which is humility ofheart, is the gift of Christ. A contrite heart is the acceptable sacrifice. If you humble yourself, youwill be greatly exalted; and if you exalt yourself, you will be exceedingly humbled. My son, guard yourself against wickedness, and do not let the Spirit of Wickedness cast you downinto the Abyss. For he is mad and bitter. He is terrifying, and he casts everyone down into a pit ofmire. It is a great and good thing not to love fornication, and not even to think of the wretched matter atall, for to think of it is death. It is not good for any man to fall into death. For a soul which hasbeen found in death will be without reason. For it is better not to live than to acquire an animal'slife. Protect yourself, lest you are burned by the fires of fornication. For many who are submergedin fire are its servants, whom you do not know as your enemies. O my son, strip off the old garment of fornication, and put on the garment which is clean andshining, that you may be beautiful in it. But when you have this garment, protect it well. Releaseyourself from every bond, so that you may acquire freedom. If you cast out of yourself the desirewhose devices are many, you will release yourself from the sins of lust. Listen, O soul, to my advice. Do not become a den of foxes and snakes, nor a hole of serpents andasps, nor a dwelling place of lions, or a place of refuge of basilisk-snakes. When these thingshappen to you, O soul, what will you do? For these are the powers of the Adversary. Everythingwhich is dead will come into you through them (the powers). For their food is everything which isdead, and every unclean thing. For when these are within you, what living thing will come intoyou? The living angels will detest you.

Give them life.They shall live again! For the Tree of Life is Christ. He is Wisdom. For he is Wisdom; he is also the Word. he is the Life,the Power, and the Door. He is the Light, the Angel, and the Good Shepherd. Entrust yourself tothis one who became all for your sake. Knock on yourself as upon a door, and walk upon yourself as on a straight road. For if you walkon the road, it is impossible for you to go astray. And if you knock with this one (Wisdom), youknock on hidden treasures. For since he (Christ) is Wisdom, he makes the foolish man wise. He (Wisdom) is a holy kingdomand a shining robe. For it (Wisdom) is much gold, which gives you great honor. The Wisdom ofGod became a type of fool for you, so that it might take you up, O foolish one, and make you awise man. And the Life died for you when he was powerless, so that through his death, he mightgive life to you who have died. Entrust yourself to reason and remove yourself from animalism. For the animal which has noreason is made manifest. For many think that they have reason, but if you look at them attentively,their speech is animalistic. Give yourself gladness from the true vine of Christ. Satisfy yourself with the true wine, in whichthere is no drunkenness nor error. For it (the true wine) marks the end of drinking, since there isusually in it what gives joy to the soul and the mind, through the Spirit of God. But first, nurtureyour reasoning powers before you drink of it (the true wine). Do not pierce yourself with the sword of sin. Do not burn yourself, O wretched one, with the fireof lust. Do not surrender yourself to barbarians like a prisoner, nor to savage beasts which want totrample upon you. For they are as lions which roar very loudly. Be not dead lest they trampleupon you. You shall be man! It is possible for you through reasoning to conquer them. But the man who does nothing is unworthy of (being called) rational man. The rational man is hewho fears God. He who fears God does nothing insolent. And he who guards himself againstdoing anything insolent is one who keeps his guiding principle. Although he is a man who existson earth, he makes himself like God. But he who makes himself like God is one who does nothing unworthy of God, according to thestatement of Paul, who has become like Christ. For who shows reverence for God while not wanting to do things which are pleasing to him? Forpiety is that which is from the heart, and piety from the heart (characterizes) every soul which isnear to God. The soul which is a member of God's household is one which is kept pure, and the soul which hasput on Christ is one which is pure. It is impossible for it to sin. Now where Christ is, there sin isidle. Let Christ alone enter your world, and let him bring to naught all powers which have come uponyou. Let him enter the temple which is within you, so that he may cast out all the merchants. Lethim dwell in the temple which is within you, and may you become for him a priest and a Levite,entering in purity. Blessed are you, O soul, if you find this one in your temple.Blessed are you still more if you perform his service.But he who will defile the temple of God, that one God will destroy. For you lay yourself open, Oman, if you cast this one out of your temple. For whenever the enemies do not see Christ in you,then they will come into you armed in order to crush you.

Know who Christ is, and acquire him as a friend, for this is the friend who is faithful. He is alsoGod and Teacher. This one, being God, became man for your sake. It is this one who broke theiron bars of the Underworld, and the bronze bolts. It is this one who attacked and cast down everyhaughty tyrant. It is he who loosened from himself the chains of which he had taken hold. Hebrought up the poor from the Abyss and the mourners from the Underworld. It is he whohumbled the haughty powers; he who put to shame haughtiness through humility; he who hascast down the strong and the boaster through weakness; he who, in his contempt, scorned thatwhich is considered an honor, so that humility for God's sake might be highly exalted; (and) hewho has put on humanity. And yet, the divine Word is God, he who bears patiently with man always. He wished to producehumility in the exalted. He (Christ), who has exalted man became like God, not in order that hemight bring God down to man, but that man might become like God. O this great goodness of God! O Christ, King, who has revealed to men the GreatDivinity, King of every virtue and King of life, King of ages and Great One of theheavens, hear my words and forgive me! Furthermore, he manifested a great zeal for Divinity. Where is a man (who is) wise or powerful in intelligence, or a man whose devices are manybecause he knows wisdom? Let him speak wisdom; let him utter great boasting! For every manhas become a fool and has spoken out of his (own) knowledge. For he (Christ) confounded thecounsels of guileful people, and he prevailed over those wise in their own understanding. Who will be able to discover the counsel of the Almighty, or to speak of the Divinity, or toproclaim it correctly? If we have not even been able to understand the counsels of ourcompanions, who will be able to comprehend the Divinity, or the divinities of the heavens? If wescarcely find things on earth, who will search for the things of heaven? A great power and greatglory has made the world known. And the Life of Heaven wishes to renew all, that he may cast out that which is weak, and everyblack form, that everyone may shine forth in heavenly garments in order to make manifest thecommand of the Father (who) is exceedingly brilliant, and that he (Christ) may crown thosewishing to contend well. Christ, being judge of the contest, is he who crowned every one, teachingevery one to contend. This one who contended first received the crown, gained dominion, andappeared, giving light to everyone. And all were made new through the Holy Spirit and the Mind.O Lord Almighty, how much glory shall I give Thee? No one has been able to glorifyGod adequately. It is Thou who hast given glory to Thy Word in order to saveeveryone, O Merciful God. (It is) he who has come from Thy mouth and has risenfrom Thy heart, the First-born, the Wisdom, the Prototype, the First Light. For he is light from the power of God, and he is an emanation of the pure glory of the Almighty.He is the spotless mirror of the working of God, and he is the image of his goodness. For he is alsothe light of the Eternal Light. He is the eye which looks at the invisible Father, always serving andforming by the Father's will. He alone was begotten by the Father's good pleasure. For he is anincomprehensible Word, and he is Wisdom and Life. He gives life to, and nourishes, all livingthings and powers. Just as the soul gives life to all the members, he rules all with power and giveslife to them. For he is the beginning and the end of everyone, watching over all and encompassingthem. He is troubled on behalf of everyone, and he rejoices and also mourns. On the one hand, hemourns for those who have gotten as their lot the place of punishment; on the other, he is troubledabout every one whom he arduously brings to instruction.

But this divine is not pleased with anything evil. For it is this which teaches all menwhat is good. This is what God has given to the human race, so that for this reason every manmight be chosen before all the angels and the archangels. For God does not need to put any man to the test. He knows all things before they happen, and heknows the hidden things of the heart. They are all revealed and found wanting in his presence. Letno one ever say that God is ignorant. For it is not right to place the Creator of every creature inignorance. For even things which are in darkness are before him like (things in) the light. So, there is no other one hidden except God alone. But he is revealed to everyone, and yet he isvery hidden. He is revealed because God knows all. And if they do not wish to affirm it, they willbe corrected by their heart. Now he is hidden because no one perceives the things of God. For it isincomprehensible and unfathomable to know the counsel of God. Furthermore, it is difficult tocomprehend him, and it is difficult to find Christ. For he is the one who dwells in every place, andalso he is in no place. For no one who wants to will be able to know God as he actually is, norChrist, nor the Spirit, nor the chorus of angels, nor even the archangels, as well as the thrones ofthe spirits, and the exalted lordships, and the Great Mind.

When I had set straight my sinless soul, then Istrengthened 2 the intellectual [...] and I [...] in the [...] of my God [...] [...] I having done [...] growstrong in a holy spirit higher than god.

It is with them and the god of the unborn Kalyptos and the power[in] them all that existence is mixed. (About) existence: how do those who exist, being from the aeon of those who exist, (come) from aninvisible, undivided and self-begotten spirit? Are they three unborn images having an originbetter than existence, existing prior [to] all [these], yet having become the [world ...]? How arethose opposite it and all these 3 [...] good, he and an excuse. What is that one\"s place? What is hisorigin? How does the one from him exist for him and all these? How [does he come into existence]as a simple one, differing [from] himself? Does he exist as existence, form, and blessedness? Bygiving strength is he alive with life? How has the existence which does not exist appeared from anexisting power? I pondered these things to understand them; according to the custom of my race I kept bringingthem up to the god of my fathers. I kept praising them all, for my forefathers and fathers whosought found. As for me, I did not cease seeking a resting place worthy of my spirit, since I wasnot yet bound in the perceptible world. Then, as I was deeply troubled and gloomy because of thediscouragement which encompassed me, I dared to act and to deliver myself to the wild beasts ofthe desert for a violent death. There stood before me the angel of the knowledge of eternal light. He said to me, \"Zostrianos, whyhave you gone mad as if you were ignorant of the great eternals 4 who are above? [...] you [...] [...]say also [...] that you are now saved, [...] [...] in eternal death, nor [...] [...] those whom you know inorder to [...] save others, [namely] my father\"s chosen elect?

Other immortal souls associate with all these souls because of the Sophia who looked down; forthere are three species of immortal soul: first, those who have taken root upon the Exile becausethey have no ability to beget, (something) that only those who follow the ways of the others have,the one being a single species which [...]; being second, those who stand [upon the] Repentancewhich [...] sin, (it) being sufficient [... knowledge ...] being new [...] and he has [...] difference [...]they have sinned with the others [and] 28 they have repented with the others [...] from them alone,for [...] are species which exist in [...] with those who committed all sins and repented.

When he turns aside, he comes into being seekingthose things that do not exist. When he falls down to them in thought and knows them in anotherway because he is powerless, unless perhaps 46 he is enlightened, he becomes a product of nature.Thus he comes down to birth because of it and is speechless because of the pains and infinitenessof matter.

Therefore, powers are appointed for their salvation, and each one of them is in the world. Withinthe self-begotten ones corresponding to each of the [aeons] stand glories so that one who is in the[world] might be safe beside them. The glories are perfect thoughts appearing in powers.

Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.The Letter of Peter which he sent to Philip\"Peter, the apostle of Jesus Christ, to Philip, our beloved brother and our fellow apostle, and (to)the brethren who are with you: greetings! Now I want you to know, our brother, that we received orders from our Lord and the Savior of thewhole world that we should come together to give instruction and preach in the salvation whichwas promised us by our Lord Jesus Christ. But as for you, you were separate from us, and you didnot desire us to come together and to know how we should organize ourselves in order that wemight tell the good news. Therefore would it be agreeable to you, our brother, to come accordingto the orders of our God Jesus?\" When Philip had received these (words), and when he had read them, he went to Peter rejoicingwith gladness. Then Peter gathered the others also. They went upon the mountain which is called\"the (mount) olives,\" the place where they used to gather with the blessed Christ when he was inthe body. Then, when the apostles had come together, and had thrown themselves upon their knees, theyprayed thus saying, \"Father, Father, Father of the light, who possesses the incorruptions, hear usjust as thou hast taken pleasure in thy holy child Jesus Christ. For he became for us an illuminatorin the darkness. Yea hear us!\" And they prayed again another time, saying, \"Son of life, Son of immortality, who is in the light,Son, Christ of immortality, our Redeemer, give us power, for they seek to kill us!\" Then a great light appeared so that the mountains shone from the sight of him who had appeared.And a voice called out to them saying, \"Listen to my words that I may speak to you. Why are youasking me? I am Jesus Christ who am with you forever.\" Then the apostles answered and said, \"Lord, we would like to know the deficiency of the aeonsand their pleroma.\" And: \"How are we detained in this dwelling place?\" Further: \"How did wecome to this place?\" And: \"In what manner shall we depart?\" Again: \"How do we have theauthority of boldness?\" And: \"Why do the powers fight against us?\" Then a voice came to them out of the light saying, \"It is you yourselves who are witnesses that Ispoke all these things to you. But because of your unbelief I shall speak again. First of allconcerning the deficiency of the aeons, this is the deficiency, when the disobedience and thefoolishness of the mother appeared without the commandment of the majesty of the Father. Shewanted to raise up aeons. And when she spoke, the Arrogant One followed. And when she leftbehind a part, the Arrogant One laid hold of it, and it became a deficiency. This is the deficiency ofthe aeons. Now when the Arrogant One had taken a part, he sowed it. And he placed powers overit and authorities. And he enclosed it in the aeons which are dead. And all the powers of the worldrejoiced that they had been begotten. But they do not know the pre-existent Father, since they arestrangers to him. But this is the one to whom they gave power and whom they served by praisinghim. But he, the Arrogant One, became proud on account of the praise of the powers. He becamean envier and he wanted to make an image in the place of an image, and a form in the place of aform. And he commissioned the powers within his authority to mold mortal bodies. And theycame to be from a misrepresentation, from the semblance which had merged.\" \"Next concerning the pleroma: I am the one who was sent down in the body because of the seedwhich had fallen away. And I came down into their mortal mold. But they did not recognize me;they were thinking of me that I was a mortal man. And I spoke with him who belongs to me, andhe harkened to me just as you too who harkened today. And I gave him authority in order that he- 228 -"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"might enter into the inheritance of his fatherhood. And I took [...] they were filled [...] in hissalvation. And since he was a deficiency, for this reason he became a pleroma.\" \"It is because of this that you are being detained, because you belong to me. When you strip offfrom yourselves what is corrupted, then you will become illuminators in the midst of mortal men.\"\"And this (is the reason) that you will fight against the powers, because they do not have rest likeyou, since they do not wish that you be saved.\" Then the apostles worshiped again saying, \"Lord, tell us: In what way shall we fight against thearchons, since the archons are above us?\" Then a voice called out to them from the appearance saying, \"Now you will fight against them inthis way, for the archons are fighting against the inner man. And you are to fight against them inthis way: Come together and teach in the world the salvation with a promise. And you, girdyourselves with the power of my Father, and let your prayer be known. And he, the Father, willhelp you as he has helped you by sending me. Be not afraid, I am with you forever, as I previouslysaid to you when I was in the body.\" Then there came lightning and thunder from heaven, andwhat appeared to them in that place was taken up to heaven. Then the apostles gave thanks to the Lord with every blessing. And they returned to Jerusalem.And while coming up they spoke with each other on the road concerning the light which hadcome. And a remark was made concerning the Lord. It was said, \"If he, our Lord, suffered, thenhow much (must) we (suffer)?\" Peter answered saying, \"He suffered on our behalf, and it is necessary for us too to suffer becauseof our smallness.\" Then a voice came to them saying, \"I have told you many times: it is necessaryfor you to suffer. It is necessary that they bring you to synagogues and governors, so that you willsuffer. But he who does not suffer and does not [...] the Father [...] in order that he may [...].\" And the apostles rejoiced greatly and came up to Jerusalem. And they came up to the temple andgave instruction in salvation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And they healed a multitude. And Peter opened his mouth, he said to his (fellow) disciples, \"Did our Lord Jesus, when he was inthe body, show us everything? For he came down. My brothers, listen to my voice.\" And he wasfilled with a holy spirit. He spoke thus: \"Our illuminator, Jesus, came down and was crucified.And he bore a crown of thorns. And he put on a purple garment. And he was crucified on a treeand he was buried in a tomb. And he rose from the dead. My brothers, Jesus is a stranger to thissuffering. But we are the ones who have suffered through the transgression of the mother. Andbecause of this, he did everything like us. For the Lord Jesus, the Son of the immeasurable glory ofthe Father, he is the author of our life. My brothers, let us therefore not obey these lawless ones,and walk in [...].\" [...] Then Peter gathered together the others also, saying, \"O, Lord Jesus Christ, author of our rest,give us a spirit of understanding in order that we also may perform wonders.\" Then Peter and the other apostles saw him, and they were filled with a holy spirit, And each oneperformed healings. And they parted in order to preach the Lord Jesus. And they came togetherand greeted each other saying, \"Amen.\" Then Jesus appeared saying to them, \"Peace to you all and everyone who believes in my name.And when you depart, joy be to you and grace and power. And be not afraid; behold, I am withyou forever.\" Then the apostles parted from each other into four words in order to preach.

Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.Father of All, Ennoia22 of the Light, dwelling in the heights above the (regions) below, Light dwelling in the heights,Voice of Truth, upright Nous23, untouchable Logos24, and ineffable Voice, incomprehensible Father!25It is Norea26 who cries out to them.27 They heard, (and) they received her into her place forever. They gave it to her in theFather of Nous, Adamas28, as well as the voice of the Holy Ones, in order that she might rest in the ineffable Epinoia29, inorder that <she> might inherit the first mind30 which <she> had received, and that <she> might rest in the divineAutogenes31, and that she (too) might generate herself, just as she also has inherited the living Logos32, and that shemight be joined to all of the Imperishable Ones, and speak with the mind of the Father. 33And she began to speak with the words of Life34, and <she> remained in the presence of the Exalted One, possessingthat which she had received before the world came into being35. She has the great mind of the Invisible One, and shegives glory to <her> Father, and she dwells within those who [...] within the Pleroma36, and she beholds the Pleroma. 37There will be days when she will behold the Pleroma, and she will not be in deficiency38, for she has the four holyhelpers39 who intercede on her behalf with the Father of the All, Adamas. He it is who is within all of the Adams40,possessing the thought of Norea, who speaks concerning the two names which create a single name.22 Ennoia is the Greek word for thought.23 Nous is the Greek word for Mind. In Hermetic and Gnostic writings, Nous often is used as a name or a description of the one true God.24 Logos is the Greek word often translated into English as Word. In the original Greek it is more of a reference to ratio, order, or logic, although language (hence'word') is also a valid choice. Logos, in Christological writings is usually assumed to refer to Christ. This assumption, however, is drawn into question when oneobserves the use of the word in the Hermetic and non-Christian Gnostic traditions, as \"The Thought of Norea\" is an example of. It should be read as the savinglogic, or knowledge (gnosis) by which salvation is achieved.25 This part begins the Thought with an address to higher beings, formed as an invocation. Although Pearson details it as being to the divine Sethian triad of Father,Mother and Son, this does not seem so clear. Clearly more than one being is addressed, as Norea refers to \"them\" in line 3, and clearly the Son is addressed(\"Logos,\" line 2) and the Father (\"Nous,\" line 2), but presumably the Ennoia and/or the Voice is meant to refer to the divine Mother.26 Norea, under many variations of spelling, is a frequent figure in Gnostic literature (cf. especially The Hypostasis of the Archons), under a great variety ofcircumstances, from the ark burning wife of Noah to the sister-wife of Seth. In this last capacity, in Sethian Gnosticism, she often appears as a female equivalent ofhis male savior figure. Here, however, she takes the position of savior alone.27 Begins the second segment in the Thought, where Norea is taken from this world into the divine world (the Pleroma), being her proper place. It is telling in that thehigher powers do not receive her into their place, but into hers. She is brought into the thought of the mind, and there can speak with all the Imperishable Ones,being the higher powers themselves and all the saved. We see that she has inherited the Logos, which a Christian would read as receiving the Spirit of the Word,Christ, and she also becomes Autogenetic. Thus she, so to speak, is taken into the Godhead.28 Identified as \"the Father of the All\" and \"the Father of Nous\" (or mind), Adamas is a name often used to refer to the father of all mankind. One will notice, though,that, unlike the Bringhamite Mormons, this does not imply that a man, Adam, is the father of all, or the father of God (Nous), for Adamas is present in all that Adams(see note, line 20). This is, instead, a transcendent being, a totality of thoughts, by which salvation is achieved, roughly equivalent to the Christian Holy Spirit.29 Epinoia: Although this annotator does not know from what Greek word this is derived, it evidently refers to the Pleroma once again, wherein Norea may find rest.30 First mind: refers once again to the Nous, being the first mind of God. The significance is that it points out once again that she has inherited the very mind of God.31 Autogenes is the Greek word meaning \"self-begotten,\" in that the Creator is self-creating, and needs no external force to bring Him into being. In Hermetic andGnostic writings it is often used as an alternate name for the one true God. The significance here is that, having been freed from the bonds of this corruptible world,Norea becomes \"self-begotten,\" able to generate herself, showing the immortality of the soul and the fact that the appearance of creation is misleading.32 Living Logos: in Gnostic texts, the term \"Living Christ\", as opposed to simply \"Christ,\" is used to refer to the secret or spiritual being, as opposed to the earthly orcorruptible being. The use here may be construed as to refer to the immortal and spiritual Logos (note 3), as opposed to the Logos that manifests itself in the worldwhich we may perceive. Norea has, thus, inherited the true knowledge of reality, not simply earthly knowledge as can be studied from experiences here on thisplane.33 Part three: She has here received the very mind of God into herself, and simultaneously sees and is the Godhead, or Pleroma.34 Words of Life: Here, Pearson conjectures that the words of Life refer to the capacity to deliver salvation, and thus shows that Norea achieves the capacity to savemankind by virtue of her salvation.35 \"that which she had received before the world came into being\": refers to the immortality of the soul, and the concept that the soul, although it may believe orperceive itself to be apart from the Pleroma, in reality has received the mind of God (note 12), the living Logos, and the words of Life before this corruptible worldcame into being.36 Pleroma: The Pleroma is the word referring to the thirty highest Aeons, constituting the one true God, although it also refers to the beings that occupy thoseAeons. This is how Norea may simultaneously see and be the Pleroma. Essentially, this word means what is thought of as the Godhead in Eastern culture.37 Fourth and final section of the Thought, wherein it speaks of Norea's salvation, and how it is aided.38 Deficiency: The concept of being in or out of deficiency is a common one in Gnostic writings, and refers to being filled or not filled with the spirit of God (or,among Christian Gnostics, Christ). One who is not filled with the spirit of God is deficient, and thirsts, and is not saved. The Norea perceives the Pleroma and is notdeficient demonstrates that being one with the Godhead is salvation, and fills one with the spirit.39 Four holy helpers: Pearson identifies these helpers with the four \"luminaries\" of Sethian Gnosticism, Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithe, and Eleleth. These beings aremore detailed in Melchizedek, where it is seen that they are referred to as \"commander\" or \"Commander-in-chief,\" and seem to fulfill a position somewhat similar tothe Archangels in Christianty, although Melchizedek groups the \"offspring of the Archons\" with the offspring of \"all the angels,\" and so the luminaries may be of ahigher type. Here they are seen as entities aiding by intercession in Norea's continual salvation, thus implying that salvation is something that can be lost.40 Adams: Adam being the Hebrew for \"man,\" should be read as meaning the reference here to the Adams as the mass of created humanity. That Adamas ispresent in all Adams shows that the transcendent totality of thoughts is present in all created mankind.- 233 -"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"T h e T e s t i m o n y o f T r u t hCODEX IXTranslated by Søren Giversen and Birger A. PearsonSelection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.I will speak to those who know to hear not with the ears of the body but with the ears of the mind.For many have sought after the truth and have not been able to find it; because there has takenhold of them the old leaven of the Pharisees and the scribes of the Law. And the leaven is theerrant desire of the angels and the demons and the stars. As for the Pharisees and the scribes, it isthey who belong to the archons who have authority over them. For no one who is under the Law will be able to look up to the truth, for they will not be able toserve two masters. For the defilement of the Law is manifest; but undefilement belongs to thelight. The Law commands (one) to take a husband (or) to take a wife, and to beget, to multiply likethe sand of the sea. But passion, which is a delight to them, constrains the souls of those who arebegotten in this place, those who defile and those who are defiled, in order that the Law might befulfilled through them. And they show that they are assisting the world; and they turn away fromthe light, who are unable to pass by the archon of darkness until they pay the last penny. But the Son of Man came forth from Imperishability, being alien to defilement. He came to theworld by the Jordan river, and immediately the Jordan turned back. And John bore witness to thedescent of Jesus. For it is he who saw the power which came down upon the Jordan river; for heknew that the dominion of carnal procreation had come to an end. The Jordan river is the power ofthe body, that is, the senses of pleasures. The water of the Jordan is the desire for sexualintercourse. John is the archon of the womb. And this is what the Son of Man reveals to us: It is fitting for you (pl.) to receive the word of truth,if one will receive it perfectly. But as for one who is in ignorance, it is difficult for him to diminishhis works of darkness which he has done. Those who have known Imperishability, however, havebeen able to struggle against passions [...]. I have said to you, \"Do not build nor gather foryourselves in the place where the brigands break open, but bring forth fruit to the Father.\" The foolish - thinking in their heart that if they confess, \"We are Christians,\" in word only (but) notwith power, while giving themselves over to ignorance, to a human death, not knowing wherethey are going nor who Christ is, thinking that they will live, when they are (really) in error -hasten towards the principalities and authorities. They fall into their clutches because of theignorance that is in them. For (if) only words which bear testimony were effecting salvation, thewhole world would endure this thing and would be saved. But it is in this way that they drewerror to themselves. ... ... (3 lines unrecoverable)... they do not know that they will destroy themselves. If the Father were to desire a humansacrifice, he would become vainglorious. For the Son of Man clothed himself with their first-fruits; he went down to Hades and performedmany mighty works. He raised the dead therein; and the world-rulers of darkness became enviousof him, for they did not find sin in him. But he also destroyed their works from among men, sothat the lame, the blind, the paralytic, the dumb, (and) the demon-possessed were granted healing.And he walked upon the waters of the sea.

But when they are \"perfected\" with a (martyr's) death, this is the thought that they have withinthem: \"If we deliver ourselves over to death for the sake of the Name we will be saved.\" These- 234 -"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"matters are not settled in this way.

He stood up, being upright within himself, because he exists in everyone, andbecause he has death and life within himself, and he exists in the midst of both of them. Andwhen he had received the power, he turned towards the parts of the right, and he entered into thetruth, having forsaken all things pertaining to the left, having been filled with wisdom, withcounsel, with understanding, and with insight and an eternal power. And he broke open hisbonds. Those who had formed the whole place, he condemned. But they did not find [...] hiddenwithin him. And he gave command to himself; he began to know himself and to speak with his mind, which isthe father of the truth, concerning the unbegotten aeons, and concerning the virgin who broughtforth the light. And he thinks about the power which flowed over the whole place, and whichtakes hold of him. And he is a disciple of his mind, which is male. He began to keep silent withinhimself until the day when he should become worthy to be received above. He rejects for himselfloquacity and disputations, and he endures the whole place; and he bears up under them, and heendures all of the evil things. And he is patient with every one; he makes himself equal to everyone, and he also separates himself from them. And that which someone wants, he brings to him,in order that he might become perfect (and) holy. When the [...], he grasped him, having boundhim upon [...], and he was filled with wisdom. He bore witness to the truth [...] the power, and hewent into Imperishability, the place whence he came forth, having left the world, which has theappearance of the night, and those that whirl the stars in it. This, therefore, is the true testimony:When man comes to know himself and God, who is over the truth, he will be saved, and he willcrown himself with the crown unfading. John was begotten by the World through a woman, Elizabeth; and Christ was begotten by theworld through a virgin, Mary. What is (the meaning of) this mystery? John was begotten by meansof a womb worn with age, but Christ passed through a virgin's womb. When she had conceived,she gave birth to the Savior. Furthermore, she was found to be a virgin again. Why, then do you(pl.) err and not seek after these mysteries, which were prefigured for our sake? It is written in the Law concerning this, when God gave a command to Adam, \"From every treeyou may eat, but from the tree which is in the midst of Paradise do not eat, for on the day that youeat from it, you will surely die.\" But the serpent was wiser than all the animals that were inParadise, and he persuaded Eve, saying, \"On the day when you eat from the tree which is in themidst of Paradise, the eyes of your mind will be opened.\" And Eve obeyed, and she stretched forthher hand; she took from the tree and ate; she also gave to her husband with her. And immediatelythey knew that they were naked, and they took some fig-leaves (and) put them on as girdles. But God came at the time of evening, walking in the midst of Paradise. When Adam saw him, hehid himself. And he said, \"Adam, where are you?\" He answered (and) said, \"I have come underthe fig tree.\" And at that very moment, God knew that he had eaten from the tree of which he hadcommanded him, \"Do not eat of it.\" And he said to him, \"Who is it who has instructed you?\" AndAdam answered, \"The woman whom you have given me.\" And the woman said, \"It is the serpentwho instructed me.\" And he (God) cursed the serpent, and called him \"devil.\" And he said,\"Behold, Adam has become like one of us, knowing evil and good.\" Then he said, \"Let us cast himout of paradise, lest he take from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.\" - 236 -"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"But what sort is this God? First he maliciously refused Adam from eating of the tree of knowledge,and, secondly, he said \"Adam, where are you?\" God does not have foreknowledge? Would he notknow from the beginning? And afterwards, he said, \"Let us cast him out of this place, lest he eat ofthe tree of life and live forever.\" Surely, he has shown himself to be a malicious grudger! Andwhat kind of God is this? For great is the blindness of those who read, and they did not know him.And he said, \"I am the jealous God; I will bring the sins of the fathers upon the children until three(and) four generations.\" And he said, \"I will make their heart thick, and I will cause their mind tobecome blind, that they might not know nor comprehend the things that are said.\" But thesethings he has said to those who believe in him and serve him! And in one place, Moses writes, \"He made the devil a serpent <for> those whom he has in hisgeneration.\" Also, in the book which is called \"Exodus,\" it is written thus: \"He contended againstthe magicians, when the place was full of serpents according to their wickedness; and the rodwhich was in the hand of Moses became a serpent, (and) it swallowed the serpents of themagicians.\" Again it is written (Nm 21:9), \"He made a serpent of bronze (and) hung it upon a pole ... ...

Just as those to whom it was given to havebeen condemned, they shall get something! They are wicked in their behavior! Some of them fall away to the worship of idols. Others havedemons dwelling with them, as did David the king. He is the one who laid the foundation ofJerusalem; and his son Solomon, whom he begat in adultery, is the one who built Jerusalem bymeans of the demons, because he received power. When he had finished building, he imprisonedthe demons in the temple. He placed them into seven waterpots. They remained a long time in thewaterpots, abandoned there. When the Romans went up to Jerusalem, they discovered thewaterpots, and immediately the demons ran out of the waterpots, as those who escape fromprison. And the waterpots remained pure thereafter. And since those days, they dwell with menwho are in ignorance, and they have remained upon the earth. Who, then, is David? And who is Solomon? And what is the foundation?

He dwells alone in silence, andsilence is tranquility since, after all, he was a Monad and no one was before him. He dwells in theDyad and in the Pair, and his Pair is Silence. And he possessed the All dwelling within him. Andas for Intention and Persistence, Love and Permanence, they are indeed unbegotten. God came forth: the Son, Mind of the All, that is, it is from the Root of the All that even hisThought stems, since he had this one (the Son) in Mind. For on behalf of the All, he received analien Thought since there were nothing before him. From that place it is he who moved [...] agushing spring. Now this is the Root of the All and Monad without any one before him. Now thesecond spring exists in silence and speaks with him alone. And the Fourth accordingly is he whorestricted himself in the Fourth: while dwelling in the Three-hundred-sixtieth, he first broughthimself (forth), and in the Second he revealed his will, and in the Fourth he spread himself out. While these things are due to the Root of the All, let us for our part enter his revelation and hisgoodness and his descent and the All, that is, the Son, the Father of the All, and the Mind of theSpirit; for he was possessing this one before [...]. He is a spring. He is one who appears in Silence,and he is Mind of the All dwelling secondarily with Life. For he is the projector of the All and thevery hypostasis of the Father, that is, he is the Thought and his descent below. When he willed, the First Father revealed himself in him. Since, after all, because of him therevelation is available to the All, I for my part call the All 'the desire of the All'. And he took such athought concerning the All - I for my part call the thought 'Monogenes'. For now God has broughtTruth, the one who glorifies the Root of the All. Thus it is he who revealed himself in Monogenes,and in him he revealed the Ineffable One [...] the Truth. They saw him dwelling in the Monad andin the Dyad and in the Tetrad. He first brought forth Monogenes and Limit. And Limit is theseparator of the All and the confirmation of the All, since they are [...] the hundred [...]. He is theMind [...] the Son. He is completely ineffable to the All, and he is the confirmation and thehypostasis of the All, the silent veil, the true High Priest, the one who has the authority to enterthe Holies of Holies, revealing the glory of the Aeons and bringing forth the abundance to<fragrance>. The East [...] that is in Him. He is the one who revealed himself as the primalsanctuary and the treasury of the All. And he encompassed the All, he who is higher than the All.These for their part sent Christ forth to establish her just as they were established before herdescent. And they say concerning him: [...] He is not manifest, but invisible to those remainingwithin Limit. And he possesses four powers: a separator and a confirmor, a form-provider and asubstance-producer. Surely we alone would discern their presences and the time and the placeswhich the likenesses have confirmed because they have [...] from these places [...] the Love [...] isemanated [...] the entire Pleroma [...]. The persistence endures always, and [...] for also [...] the time[...] more [...] that is, the proof of his great love. So why a separator, and a confirmor and a substance-producer and a form-provider as others havesaid? For they say concerning Limit that he has two powers, a separator and a confirmor, since itseparates Depth from the Aeons, in order that [...]. These, then [...] of Depth [...].

That Tetrad projected the Tetrad which is the one consisting of Word and Life and Man andChurch. Now the Uncreated One projected Word and Life. Word is for the glory of the IneffableOne while Life is for the glory of Silence, and Man is for his own glory, while Church is for theglory of Truth. This, then, is the Tetrad begotten according to the likeness of the Uncreated(Tetrad). And the Tetrad is begotten [... ] the Decad from Word and Life, and the Dodecad fromMan, and Church became a Triacontad. Moreover, it is the one from the Triacontad of the Aeonswho bear fruit from the Triacontrad. They enter jointly, but they come forth singly, fleeing fromthe Aeons and the Uncontainable Ones. And the Uncontainable Ones, once they had looked athim, glorified Mind since he is an Uncontainable One that exists in the Pleroma. But the Decad from Word and Life brought forth decads so as to make the Pleroma become ahundred, and the Dodecad from Man and Church brought forth and made the Triacontad so as tomake the three hundred sixty become the Pleroma of the year. And the year of the Lord[...perfect...] perfect [...] according to [...] Limit and [...] Limit [...] the greatness which [...] thegoodness [...] him.

Since it is aperfect form that should ascend into the Pleroma, he did not at all want to consent to the suffering,but he was detained [...] him by Limit, that is, by the syzygy, since her correction will not occurthrough anyone except her own Son, whose alone is the fullness of divinity. He willed withinhimself bodily to leave the powers and he descended.

Therefore I am beyond confirmation as well. I deservethe things (passions) I suffer. I used to dwell in the Pleroma putting forth the Aeons and bearingfruit with my consort\" And she knew what she was and what had become of her. So they both suffered; they said she laughs since she remained alone and imitated theUncontainable One, while he said she laughs since she cut herself off from her consort. [...] IndeedJesus and Sophia revealed the creature. Since, after all, the seeds of Sophia are incomplete andformless, Jesus contrived a creature of this sort and made it of the seeds while Sophia worked withhim. For since they are seeds and without form, he descended and brought forth that pleroma ofaeons which are in that place, since even the uncreated ones of those Aeons are of the pattern ofthe Pleroma and the uncontainable Father. The Uncreated One brought forth the pattern of theuncreated, for it is from the uncreated that the Father brings forth into form. But the creature is ashadow of pre-existing things. Moreover, this Jesus created the creature, and he worked from thepassions surrounding the seeds. And he separated them from one another, and the better passionshe introduced into the spirit and the worse ones into the carnal. Now, first among all those passions [...] nor [...] him, since, after all, Pronoia caused the correctionto project shadows and images of those who exist from the first and those who are and those whoshall be. This, then, is the dispensation of believing in Jesus for the sake of him who inscribed theAll with likenesses and images and shadows. After Jesus brought forth further, he brought forth for the All those of the Pleroma and of thesyzygy, that is, the angels. For simultaneously with the agreement of the Pleroma her consortprojected the angels, since he abides in the will of the Father. For this is the will of the Father: not- 250 -"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"to allow anything to happen in the Pleroma apart from a syzygy.

Therefore he acquired sons who angeredone another. And Cain killed Abel his brother, for the Demiurge breathed into them his spirit.And there took place the struggle with the apostasy of the angels and mankind, those of the rightwith those of the left, those in heaven with those on earth, the spirits with the carnal, and the Devilagainst God. Therefore the angels lusted after the daughters of men and came down to flesh sothat God would cause a flood. And he almost regretted that he had created the world [...] theconsort and Sophia and her Son and the angels and the seeds. But the syzygy is the complete one,and Sophia and Jesus and the angels and the seeds are images of the Pleroma. Moreover, theDemiurge cast a shadow over the syzygy and the Pleroma and Jesus and Sophia and the angelsand the seeds. The complete one glorifies Sophia; the image glorifies Truth. And the glory of theseeds and Jesus are those of Silence and Monogenes. And the angels of the males and the seminalones of the females are all Pleromas. Moreover whenever Sophia receives her consort and Jesusreceives the Christ and the seeds and the angels, then the Pleroma will receive Sophia joyfully,and the All will come to be in unity and reconciliation. For by this the Aeons have been increased;for they knew that should they change, they are without change.On the AnointingTranslated by John D. Turner Selection made from James M.

Therefore I fear that my doctrine mayhave become something beyond what is fitting. And then, my son Messos, the all-glorious One, Youel, spoke to me again. She made a revelationto me and said: \"No one is able to hear these things except the great powers alone, O Allogenes. Agreat power was put upon you, which the Father of the All, the Eternal, put upon you before youcame to this place, in order that those things that are difficult to distinguish you might distinguishand those things that are unknown to the multitude you might know, and that you might escape(in safety) to the One who is yours, who was first to save and who does not need to be saved ...

But if he descends to his nature, he is less, forthe incorporeal natures have not associated with any magnitude; having this power, they areeverywhere and they are nowhere, since they are greater than every magnitude, and less thanevery exiguity.\" Now after the all-glorious One, Youel, said these things, she separated from me and left me. But Idid not despair of the words that I heard. I prepared myself therein and I deliberated with myselffor a hundred years. And I rejoiced exceedingly, since I was in a great light and a blessed pathbecause those whom I was worthy to see as well as those whom I was worthy to hear (are) thosewhom it is fitting that the great powers alone ...

When <I> was taken by the eternal Light out of the garment that was upon me, and taken up to aholy place whose likeness cannot be revealed in the world, then by means of a great blessedness Isaw all those about whom I had heard. And I praised all of them and I stood upon my knowledgeand I inclined to the knowledge of the Universals, the Aeon of Barbelo. And I saw holy powers by means of the Luminaries of the virginal male Barbelo telling me that Iwould be able to test what happens in the world: \"O Allogenes, behold your blessedness, how itsilently abides, by which you know your proper self and, seeking yourself, withdraw to the- 255 -"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Vitality that you will see moving.

Andwhen you receive a revelation of him by means of a primary revelation of the Unknown One - theOne whom if you should know him, be ignorant of him - and you become afraid in that place,withdraw to the rear because of the activities. And when you become perfect in that place, stillyourself. And in accordance with the pattern that indwells you, know likewise that it is this wayin all such (matters) after this pattern.

There was within me a stillness ofsilence, and I heard the Blessedness whereby I knew <my> proper self. And I withdrew to the Vitality as I sought <myself>, and I joined into it, and I stood, not firmlybut silently. And I saw an eternal, intellectual, undivided motion that pertains to all the formlesspowers, (which is) unlimited by limitation. And when I wanted to stand firmly, I withdrew to the Existence, which I found standing and atrest, like an image and likeness of what is conferred upon me by a revelation of the IndivisibleOne and the One who is at rest. I was filled with revelation by means of a primary revelation ofthe Unknowable One. As though I were ignorant of him, I knew him, and I received power byhim. Having been permanently strengthened, I knew the One who exists in me, and the Triple-Powered One, and the revelation of his uncontainableness. And by means of a primary revelationof the First One unknowable to them all, the God who is beyond perfection, I saw him and theTriple-Powered One that exists in them all. I was seeking the ineffable and Unknowable God -whom if one should know him, he would be absolutely ignorant of him - the Mediator of theTriple-Powered One who subsists in stillness and silence and is unknowable. And when I was confirmed in these matters, the powers of the Luminaries said to me, \"Ceasehindering the inactivity that exists in you, by seeking incomprehensible matters; rather, hear abouthim in so far as it is possible by means of a primary revelation and a revelation.\" \"Now he is something insofar as he exists in that he either exists and will become, or acts orknows, although he lives without Mind or Life or Existence or Non-Existence, incomprehensibly.And he is something along with his proper being.

Grant, Gnosticism (Harper & Brothers, New York, 1961), as quoted in Willis Barnstone, The Other Bible (Harper & Row, San Francisco, 1984).The gospel of truth is joy to those who have received from the Father of truth the gift of knowinghim by the power of the Logos, who has come from the Pleroma and who is in the thought and themind of the Father; he it is who is called \"the Savior,\" since that is the name of the work which hemust do for the redemption of those who have not known the Father. For the name of the gospel isthe manifestation of hope, since that is the discovery of those who seek him, because the Allsought him from whom it had come forth. You see, the All had been inside of him, that illimitable,inconceivable one, who is better than every thought. This ignorance of the Father brought about terror and fear. And terror became dense like a fog,that no one was able to see. Because of this, error became strong. But it worked on its hylicsubstance vainly, because it did not know the truth. It was in a fashioned form while it waspreparing, in power and in beauty, the equivalent of truth. This then, was not a humiliation forhim, that illimitable, inconceivable one. For they were as nothing, this terror and this forgetfulnessand this figure of falsehood, whereas this established truth is unchanging, unperturbed andcompletely beautiful. For this reason, do not take error too seriously. Thus, since it had no root, it was in a fog as regardsthe Father, engaged in preparing works and forgetfulnesses and fears in order, by these means, tobeguile those of the middle and to make them captive. The forgetfulness of error was not revealed.It did not become light beside the Father. Forgetfulness did not exist with the Father, although itexisted because of him. What exists in him is knowledge, which was revealed so that forgetfulnessmight be destroyed and that they might know the Father, Since forgetfulness existed because theydid not know the Father, if they then come to know the Father, from that moment on forgetfulnesswill cease to exist. That is the gospel of him whom they seek, which he has revealed to the perfect through themercies of the Father as the hidden mystery, Jesus the Christ. Through him he enlightened thosewho were in darkness because of forgetfulness. He enlightened them and gave them a path. Andthat path is the truth which he taught them. For this reason error was angry with him, so itpersecuted him. It was distressed by him, so it made him powerless. He was nailed to a cross. Hebecame a fruit of the knowledge of the Father. He did not, however, destroy them because they ateof it. He rather caused those who ate of it to be joyful because of this discovery. And as for him, them he found in himself, and him they found in themselves, that illimitable,inconceivable one, that perfect Father who made the all, in whom the All is, and whom the Alllacks, since he retained in himself their perfection, which he had not given to the all. The Fatherwas not jealous. What jealousy, indeed, is there between him and his members? For, even if theAeon had received their perfection, they would not have been able to approach the perfection ofthe Father, because he retained their perfection in himself, giving it to them as a way to return tohim and as a knowledge unique in perfection. He is the one who set the All in order and in whomthe All existed and whom the All lacked. As one of whom some have no knowledge, he desiresthat they know him and that they love him. For what is it that the All lacked, if not the knowledgeof the Father? He became a guide, quiet and in leisure. In the middle of a school he came and spoke the Word, asa teacher. Those who were wise in their own estimation came to put him to the test. But hediscredited them as empty-headed people. They hated him because they really were not wise men.After all these came also the little children, those who possess the knowledge of the Father. Whenthey became strong they were taught the aspects of the Father's face. They came to know and they- 263 -"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"were known. They were glorified and they gave glory. In their heart, the living book of the Livingwas manifest, the book which was written in the thought and in the mind of the Father and, frombefore the foundation of the All, is in that incomprehensible part of him. This is the book which no one found possible to take, since it was reserved for him who will take itand be slain. No one was able to be manifest from those who believed in salvation as long as thatbook had not appeared. For this reason, the compassionate, faithful Jesus was patient in hissufferings until he took that book, since he knew that his death meant life for many. Just as in thecase of a will which has not yet been opened, for the fortune of the deceased master of the house ishidden, so also in the case of the All which had been hidden as long as the Father of the All wasinvisible and unique in himself, in whom every space has its source. For this reason Jesusappeared. He took that book as his own. He was nailed to a cross. He affixed the edict of theFather to the cross. Oh, such great teaching! He abases himself even unto death, though he is clothed in eternal life.Having divested himself of these perishable rags, he clothed himself in incorruptibility, which noone could possibly take from him. Having entered into the empty territory of fears, he passedbefore those who were stripped by forgetfulness, being both knowledge and perfection,proclaiming the things that are in the heart of the Father, so that he became the wisdom of thosewho have received instruction. But those who are to be taught, the living who are inscribed in thebook of the living, learn for themselves, receiving instructions from the Father, turning to himagain. Since the perfection of the All is in the Father, it is necessary for the All to ascend to him.Therefore, if one has knowledge, he gets what belongs to him and draws it to himself. For he whois ignorant, is deficient, and it is a great deficiency, since he lacks that which will make himperfect. Since the perfection of the All is in the Father, it is necessary for the All to ascend to himand for each one to get the things which are his. He registered them first, having prepared them tobe given to those who came from him. Those whose name he knew first were called last, so that the one who has knowledge is he whosename the Father has pronounced. For he whose name has not been spoken is ignorant. Indeed,how shall one hear if his name has not been uttered? For he who remains ignorant until the end isa creature of forgetfulness and will perish with it. If this is not so, why have these wretches noname, why do they have no sound? Hence, if one has knowledge, he is from above. If he is called,he hears, he replies, and he turns toward him who called him and he ascends to him and heknows what he is called. Since he has knowledge, he does the will of him who called him. Hedesires to please him and he finds rest. He receives a certain name. He who thus is going to haveknowledge knows whence he came and whither he is going. He knows it as a person who, havingbecome intoxicated, has turned from his drunkenness and having come to himself, has restoredwhat is his own. He has turned many from error. He went before them to their own places, from which theydeparted when they erred because of the depth of him who surrounds every place, whereas thereis nothing which surrounds him. It was a great wonder that they were in the Father withoutknowing him and that they were able to leave on their own, since they were not able to containhim and know him in whom they were, for indeed his will had not come forth from him. For herevealed it as a knowledge with which all its emanations agree, namely, the knowledge of theliving book which he revealed to the Aeons at last as his letters, displaying to them that these arenot merely vowels nor consonants, so that one may read them and think of something void ofmeaning; on the contrary, they are letters which convey the truth. They are pronounced onlywhen they are known. Each letter is a perfect truth like a perfect book, for they are letters writtenby the hand of the unity, since the Father wrote them for the Aeons, so that they by means of hisletters might come to know the Father. While his wisdom mediates on the logos, and since his teaching expresses it, his knowledge hasbeen revealed. His honor is a crown upon it. Since his joy agrees with it, his glory exalted it. It hasrevealed his image. It has obtained his rest. His love took bodily form around it. His trust- 264 -"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"embraced it. Thus the logos of the Father goes forth into the All, being the fruit of his heart andexpression of his will. It supports the All. It chooses and also takes the form of the All, purifying it,and causing it to return to the Father and to the Mother, Jesus of the utmost sweetness. The Fatheropens his bosom, but his bosom is the Holy Spirit. He reveals his hidden self which is his son, sothat through the compassion of the Father the Aeons may know him, end their wearying searchfor the Father and rest themselves in him, knowing that this is rest. After he had filled what wasincomplete, he did away with form. The form of it is the world, that which it served. For wherethere is envy and strife, there is an incompleteness; but where there is unity, there is completeness.Since this incompleteness came about because they did not know the Father, so when they knowthe Father, incompleteness, from that moment on, will cease to exist. As one's ignorancedisappears when he gains knowledge, and as darkness disappears when light appears, so alsoincompleteness is eliminated by completeness. Certainly, from that moment on, form is no longermanifest, but will be dissolved in fusion with unity. For now their works lie scattered. In timeunity will make the spaces complete. By means of unity each one will understand itself. By meansof knowledge it will purify itself of diversity with a view towards unity, devouring matter withinitself like fire and darkness by light, death by life. Certainly, if these things have happened to each one of us, it is fitting for us, surely, to think aboutthe All so that the house may be holy and silent for unity. Like people who have moved from aneighborhood, if they have some dishes around which are not good, they usually break them.Nevertheless the householder does not suffer a loss, but rejoices, for in the place of these defectivedishes there are those which are completely perfect. For this is the judgement which has comefrom above and which has judged every person, a drawn two-edged sword cutting on this sideand that. When it appeared, I mean, the Logos, who is in the heart of those who pronounce it - itwas not merely a sound but it has become a body - a great disturbance occurred among the dishes,for some were emptied, others filled: some were provided for, others were removed; some werepurified, still others were broken. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed for they had nocomposure nor stability. Error was disturbed not knowing what it should do. It was troubled; itlamented, it was beside itself because it did not know anything. When knowledge, which is itsabolishment, approached it with all its emanations, error is empty, since there is nothing in it.Truth appeared; all its emanations recognized it. They actually greeted the Father with a powerwhich is complete and which joins them with the Father. For each one loves truth because truth isthe mouth of the Father. His tongue is the Holy Spirit, who joins him to truth attaching him to themouth of the Father by his tongue at the time he shall receive the Holy Spirit. This is the manifestation of the Father and his revelation to his Aeons. He revealed his hidden selfand explained it. For who is it who exists if it is not the Father himself? All the spaces are hisemanations. They knew that they stem from him as children from a perfect man. They knew thatthey had not yet received form nor had they yet received a name, every one of which the Fatherproduces. If they at that time receive form of his knowledge, though they are truly in him, they donot know him. But the Father is perfect. He knows every space which is within him. If he pleases,he reveals anyone whom he desires by giving him a form and by giving him a name; and he doesgive him a name and cause him to come into being. Those who do not yet exist are ignorant of himwho created them. I do not say, then, that those who do not yet exist are nothing. But they are inhim who will desire that they exist when he pleases, like the event which is going to happen. Onthe one hand, he knows, before anything is revealed, what he will produce. On the other hand, thefruit which has not yet been revealed does not know anything, nor is it anything either. Thus eachspace which, on its part, is in the Father comes from the existent one, who, on his part, hasestablished it from the nonexistent. [...] he who does not exist at all, will never exist. What, then, is that which he wants him to think? \"I am like the shadows and phantoms of thenight.\" When morning comes, this one knows that the fear which he had experienced was nothing.Thus they were ignorant of the Father; he is the one whom they did not see. Since there had beenfear and confusion and a lack of confidence and doublemindness and division, there were manyillusions which were conceived by him, the foregoing, as well as empty ignorance - as if they werefast asleep and found themselves a prey to troubled dreams. Either there is a place to which they- 265 -"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"flee, or they lack strength as they come, having pursued unspecified things. Either they areinvolved in inflicting blows, or they themselves receive bruises. Either they are falling from highplaces, or they fly off through the air, though they have no wings at all. Other times, it is as ifcertain people were trying to kill them, even though there is no one pursuing them; or, theythemselves are killing those beside them, for they are stained by their blood. Until the momentwhen they who are passing through all these things - I mean they who have experienced all theseconfusions - awake, they see nothing because the dreams were nothing. It is thus that they whocast ignorance from them as sheep do not consider it to be anything, nor regard its properties to besomething real, but they renounce them like a dream in the night and they consider theknowledge of the Father to be the dawn. It is thus that each one has acted, as if he were asleep,during the time when he was ignorant and thus he comes to understand, as if he were awakening.And happy is the man who comes to himself and awakens. Indeed, blessed is he who has openedthe eyes of the blind. And the Spirit came to him in haste when it raised him. Having given its hand to the one lyingprone on the ground, it placed him firmly on his feet, for he had not yet stood up. He gave themthe means of knowing the knowledge of the Father and the revelation of his son. For when theysaw it and listened to it, he permitted them to take a taste of and to smell and to grasp the belovedson. He appeared, informing them of the Father, the illimitable one. He inspired them with that whichis in the mind, while doing his will. Many received the light and turned towards him. But materialmen were alien to him and did not discern his appearance nor recognize him. For he came in thelikeness of flesh and nothing blocked his way because it was incorruptible and unrestrainable.Moreover, while saying new things, speaking about what is in the heart of the Father, heproclaimed the faultless word. Light spoke through his mouth, and his voice brought forth life. Hegave them thought and understanding and mercy and salvation and the Spirit of strength derivedfrom the limitlessness of the Father and sweetness. He caused punishments and scourgings tocease, for it was they which caused many in need of mercy to astray from him in error and inchains - and he mightily destroyed them and derided them with knowledge. He became a path forthose who went astray and knowledge to those who were ignorant, a discovery for those whosought, and a support for those who tremble, a purity for those who were defiled. He is the shepherd who left behind the ninety-nine sheep which had not strayed and went insearch of that one which was lost. He rejoiced when he had found it. For ninety-nine is a numberof the left hand, which holds it. The moment he finds the one, however, the whole number istransferred to the right hand. Thus it is with him who lacks the one, that is, the entire right handwhich attracts that in which it is deficient, seizes it from the left side and transfers it to the right. Inthis way, then, the number becomes one hundred. This number signifies the Father. He labored even on the Sabbath for the sheep which he found fallen into the pit. He saved the lifeof that sheep, bringing it up from the pit in order that you may understand fully what thatSabbath is, you who possess full understanding. It is a day in which it is not fitting that salvationbe idle, so that you may speak of that heavenly day which has no night and of the sun which doesnot set because it is perfect. Say then in your heart that you are this perfect day and that in you thelight which does not fail dwells. Speak concerning the truth to those who seek it and of knowledge to those who, in their error,have committed sin. Make sure-footed those who stumble and stretch forth your hands to the sick.Nourish the hungry and set at ease those who are troubled. Foster men who love. Raise up andawaken those who sleep. For you are this understanding which encourages. If the strong followthis course, they are even stronger. Turn your attention to yourselves. Do not be concerned withother things, namely, that which you have cast forth from yourselves, that which you havedismissed. Do not return to them to eat them. Do not be moth-eaten. Do not be worm-eaten, foryou have already shaken it off. Do not be a place of the devil, for you have already destroyed him.Do not strengthen your last obstacles, because that is reprehensible.

Do the will of theFather, then, for you are from him. For the Father is sweet and his will is good. He knows the things that are yours, so that you mayrest yourselves in them. For by the fruits one knows the things that are yours, that they are thechildren of the Father, and one knows his aroma, that you originate from the grace of hiscountenance. For this reason, the Father loved his aroma; and it manifests itself in every place; andwhen it is mixed with matter, he gives his aroma to the light; and into his rest he causes it toascend in every form and in every sound. For there are no nostrils which smell the aroma, but it isthe Spirit which possesses the sense of smell and it draws it for itself to itself and sinks into thearoma of the Father. He is, indeed, the place for it, and he takes it to the place from which it hascome, in the first aroma which is cold. It is something in a psychic form, resembling cold waterwhich is [...] since it is in soil which is not hard, of which those who see it think, \"It is earth.\"Afterwards, it becomes soft again. If a breath is taken, it is usually hot. The cold aromas, then, arefrom the division. For this reason, God came and destroyed the division and he brought the hotPleroma of love, so that the cold may not return, but the unity of the Perfect Thought prevail. This is the word of the Gospel of the finding of the Pleroma for those who wait for the salvationwhich comes from above. When their hope, for which they are waiting, is waiting - they whoselikeness is the light in which there is no shadow, then at that time the Pleroma is about to come.The deficiency of matter, however, is not because of the limitlessness of the Father who comes atthe time of the deficiency. And yet no one is able to say that the incorruptible One will come inthis manner. But the depth of the Father is increasing, and the thought of error is not with him. Itis a matter of falling down and a matter of being readily set upright at the finding of that one whohas come to him who will turn back. For this turning back is called \"repentance\". For this reason, incorruption has breathed. It followedhim who has sinned in order that he may find rest. For forgiveness is that which remains for thelight in the deficiency, the word of the pleroma. For the physician hurries to the place in whichthere is sickness, because that is the desire which he has. The sick man is in a deficient condition,but he does not hide himself because the physician possesses that which he lacks. In this mannerthe deficiency is filled by the Pleroma, which has no deficiency, which has given itself out in orderto fill the one who is deficient, so that grace may take him, then, from the area which is deficientand has no grace. Because of this a diminishing occurred in the place which there is no grace, thearea where the one who is small, who is deficient, is taken hold of. He revealed himself as a Pleroma, i.e., the finding of the light of truth which has shined towardshim, because he is unchangeable. For this reason, they who have been troubled speak about Christin their midst so that they may receive a return and he may anoint them with the ointment. Theointment is the pity of the Father, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anointedare those who are perfect. For the filled vessels are those which are customarily used for anointing.But when an anointing is finished, the vessel is usually empty, and the cause of its deficiency isthe consumption of its ointment. For then a breath is drawn only through the power which he has.But the one who is without deficiency - one does not trust anyone beside him nor does one pouranything out. But that which is the deficient is filled again by the perfect Father. He is good. Heknows his plantings because he is the one who has planted them in his Paradise. And his Paradiseis his place of rest. This is the perfection in the thought of the Father and these are the words of his reflection. Eachone of his words is the work of his will alone, in the revelation of his Logos. Since they were in thedepth of his mind, the Logos, who was the first to come forth, caused them to appear, along withan intellect which speaks the unique word by means of a silent grace. It was called \"thought,\" sincethey were in it before becoming manifest. It happened, then, that it was the first to come forth - atthe moment pleasing to the will of him who desired it; and it is in the will that the Father is at restand with which he is pleased. Nothing happens without him, nor does anything occur without thewill of the Father. But his will is incomprehensible. His will is his mark, but no one can know it,nor is it possible for them to concentrate on it in order to possess it. But that which he wishes takesplace at the moment he wishes it - even if the view does not please anyone: it is God`s will.

The end, you see, is the recognition of him who is hidden, that is, theFather, from whom the beginning came forth and to whom will return all who have come fromhim. For they were made manifest for the glory and the joy of his name. And the name of the Father is the Son. It is he who, in the beginning, gave a name to him whocame forth from him - he is the same one - and he begat him for a son. He gave him his namewhich belonged to him - he, the Father, who possesses everything which exists around him. Hepossess the name; he has the son. It is possible for them to see him. The name, however, isinvisible, for it alone is the mystery of the invisible about to come to ears completely filled with itthrough the Father`s agency. Moreover, as for the Father, his name is not pronounced, but it isrevealed through a son. Thus, then, the name is great. Who, then, has been able to pronounce a name for him, this great name, except him alone towhom the name belongs and the sons of the name in whom the name of the Father is at rest, andwho themselves in turn are at rest in his name, since the Father has no beginning? It is he alonewho engendered it for himself as a name in the beginning before he had created the Aeons, thatthe name of the Father should be over their heads as a lord - that is, the real name, which is secureby his authority and by his perfect power. For the name is not drawn from lexicons nor is hisname derived from common name-giving, But it is invisible. He gave a name to himself alone,because he alone saw it and because he alone was capable of giving himself a name. For he whodoes not exist has no name. For what name would one give him who did not exist? Nevertheless,he who exists also with his name and he alone knows it, and to him alone the Father gave a name.The Son is his name. He did not, therefore, keep it secretly hidden, but the son came into existence.He himself gave a name to him. The name, then, is that of the Father, just as the name of theFather is the Son. For otherwise, where would compassion find a name - outside of the Father? Butsomeone will probably say to his companion, \"Who would give a name to someone who existedbefore himself, as if, indeed, children did not receive their name from one of those who gave thembirth?\" Above all, then, it is fitting for us to think this point over: What is the name? It is the real name. Itis, indeed, the name which came from the Father, for it is he who owns the name. He did not, yousee, get the name on loan, as in the case of others because of the form in which each one of them isgoing to be created. This, then, is the authoritative name. There is no one else to whom he hasgiven it. But it remained unnamed, unuttered, `till the moment when he, who is perfect,pronounced it himself; and it was he alone who was able to pronounce his name and to see it.When it pleased him, then, that his son should be his pronounced name and when he gave thisname to him, he who has come from the depth spoke of his secrets, because he knew that theFather was absolute goodness. For this reason, indeed, he sent this particular one in order that hemight speak concerning the place and his place of rest from which he had come forth, and that hemight glorify the Pleroma, the greatness of his name and the sweetness of his Father. Each one will speak concerning the place from which he has come forth, and to the region fromwhich he received his essential being, he will hasten to return once again. And he want from thatplace - the place where he was - because he tasted of that place, as he was nourished and grew.And his own place of rest is his Pleroma. All the emanations from the Father, therefore, arePleromas, and all his emanations have their roots in the one who caused them all to grow fromhimself. He appointed a limit. They, then, became manifest individually in order that they mightbe in their own thought, for that place to which they extend their thoughts is their root, which liftsthem upward through all heights to the Father. They reach his head, which is rest for them, andthey remain there near to it so that they say that they have participated in his face by means ofembraces. But these of this kind were not manifest, because they have not risen above themselves.Neither have they been deprived of the glory of the Father nor have they thought of him as small,nor bitter, nor angry, but as absolutely good, unperturbed, sweet, knowing all the spaces beforethey came into existence and having no need of instruction.

MacRae Selection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.The gospel of truth is joy for those who have received from the Father of truth the grace ofknowing him, through the power of the Word that came forth from the pleroma, the one who is inthe thought and the mind of the Father, that is, the one who is addressed as 'the Savior', (that)being the name of the work he is to perform for the redemption of those who were ignorant of theFather, while in the name of the gospel is the proclamation of hope, being discovery for those whosearch for him. When the totality went about searching for the one from whom they had come forth - and thetotality was inside of him, the incomprehensible, inconceivable one who is superior to everythought - ignorance of the Father brought about anguish and terror; and the anguish grew solidlike a fog, so that no one was able to see. For this reason, error became powerful; it worked on itsown matter foolishly, not having known the truth. It set about with a creation, preparing withpower and beauty the substitute for the truth. This was not, then, a humiliation for him, the incomprehensible, inconceivable one, for they werenothing, the anguish and the oblivion and the creature of deceit, while the established truth isimmutable, imperturbable, perfect in beauty. For this reason, despise error. Thus, it had no root; it fell into a fog regarding the Father, while it was involved in preparingworks and oblivions and terrors, in order that by means of these it might entice those of themiddle and capture them. The oblivion of error was not revealed. It is not a [...] from the Father. Oblivion did not come intoexistence from the Father, although it did indeed come into existence because of him. But whatcomes into existence in him is knowledge, which appeared in order that oblivion might vanishand the Father might be known. Since oblivion came into existence because the Father was notknown, then if the Father comes to be known, oblivion will not exist from that moment on. Through this, the gospel of the one who is searched for, which <was> revealed to those who areperfect, through the mercies of the Father, the hidden mystery, Jesus, the Christ, enlightened thosewho were in darkness through oblivion. He enlightened them; he showed (them) a way; and theway is the truth which he taught them. For this reason, error grew angry at him, persecuted him, was distressed at him, (and) wasbrought to naught. He was nailed to a tree (and) he became fruit of the knowledge of the Father. Itdid not, however, cause destruction because it was eaten, but to those who ate it, it gave (cause) tobecome glad in the discovery, and he discovered them in himself, and they discovered him inthemselves. As for the incomprehensible, inconceivable one, the Father, the perfect one, the one who made thetotality, within him is the totality, and of him the totality has need. Although he retained theirperfection within himself, which he did not give to the totality, the Father was not jealous. Whatjealousy indeed (could there be) between himself and his members? For if this aeon had thusreceived their perfection, they could not have come [...] the Father. He retains within himself theirperfection, granting it to them as a return to him, and a perfectly unitary knowledge. It is he whofashioned the totality, and within him is the totality, and the totality was in need of him. As in the case of a person of whom some are ignorant, he wishes to have them know him and lovehim, so - for what did the totality have need of if not knowledge regarding the Father? - he becamea guide, restful and leisurely. In schools he appeared, (and) he spoke the word as a teacher. Therecame the men wise in their own estimation, putting him to the test. But he confounded them,because they were foolish. They hated him, because they were not really wise. - 270 -"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"After all these, there came the little children also, those to whom the knowledge of the Fatherbelongs. Having been strengthened, they learned about the impressions of the Father. They knew,they were known; they were glorified, they glorified. There was manifested in their heart theliving book of the living - the one written in the thought and the mind of the Father, which frombefore the foundation of the totality was within his incomprehensibility - that (book) which no onewas able to take, since it remains for the one who will take it to be slain. No one could havebecome manifest from among those who have believed in salvation unless that book hadappeared. For this reason, the merciful one, the faithful one, Jesus, was patient in acceptingsufferings until he took that book, since he knows that his death is life for many. Just as there lies hidden in a will, before it is opened, the fortune of the deceased master of thehouse, so (it is) with the totality, which lay hidden while the Father of the totality was invisible,being something which is from him, from whom every space comes forth. For this reason Jesusappeared; he put on that book; he was nailed to a tree; he published the edict of the Father on thecross. O such great teaching! He draws himself down to death, though life eternal clothes him.Having stripped himself of the perishable rags, he put on imperishability, which no one canpossibly take away from him. Having entered the empty spaces of terrors, he passed throughthose who were stripped naked by oblivion, being knowledge and perfection, proclaiming thethings that are in the heart, [...] teach those who will receive teaching. But those who are to receive teaching are the living, who are inscribed in the book of the living. Itis about themselves that they receive instruction, receiving it from the Father, turning again tohim. Since the perfection of the totality is in the Father, it is necessary for the totality to ascend tohim. Then, if one has knowledge, he receives what are his own, and draws them to himself. For hewho is ignorant is in need, and what he lacks is great, since he lacks that which will make himperfect. Since the perfection of the totality is in the Father, and it is necessary for the totality toascend to him, and for each one to receive what are his own, he enrolled them in advance, havingprepared them to give to those who came forth from him. Those whose name he knew in advance were called at the end, so that one who has knowledge isthe one whose name the Father has uttered. For he whose name has not been spoken is ignorant.Indeed, how is one to hear, if his name has not been called? For he who is ignorant until the end isa creature of oblivion, and he will vanish along with it. If not, how is it that these miserable oneshave no name, (that) they do not have the call? Therefore, if one has knowledge, his is from above.If he is called, he hears, he answers, and he turns to him who is calling him, and ascends to him.And he knows in what manner he is called. Having knowledge, he does the will of the one whocalled him, he wishes to be pleasing to him, he receives rest. Each one's name comes to him. Hewho is to have knowledge in this manner knows where he comes from and where he is going. Heknows as one who, having become drunk, has turned away from his drunkenness, (and) havingreturned to himself, has set right what are his own. He has brought many back from error. He has gone before them to their places, from which theyhad moved away, since it was on account of the depth that they received error, the depth of theone who encircles all spaces, while there is none that encircles him. It was a great wonder thatthey were in the Father, not knowing him, and (that) they were able to come forth by themselves,since they were unable to comprehend or to know the one in whom they were. For if his will hadnot thus emerged from him - for he revealed it in view of a knowledge in which all its emanationsconcur. This is the knowledge of the living book, which he revealed to the aeons at the end as his letters,revealing how they are not vowels nor are they consonants, so that one might read them and thinkof something foolish, but (rather that) they are letters of the truth, which they alone speak whoknow them. Each letter is a complete <thought>, like a complete book, since they are letterswritten by the Unity, the Father having written them for the aeons, in order that by means of hisletters they should know the Father. While his wisdom contemplates the Word, and his teaching utters it, his knowledge has revealed<it>. While forebearance is a crown upon it, and his gladness is in harmony with it, his glory has- 271 -"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"exalted it, his image has revealed it, his repose has received it into itself, his love has made a bodyover it, his fidelity has embraced it. In this way, the Word of the Father goes forth in the totality, asthe fruit of his heart and an impression of his will. But it supports the totality, purifying them,bringing them back into the Father, into the Mother, Jesus of the infinite sweetness. The Father reveals his bosom. - Now his bosom is the Holy Spirit. - He reveals what is hidden ofhim - what is hidden of him is his Son - so that through the mercies of the Father, the aeons mayknow him and cease laboring in search of the Father, resting there in him, knowing that this is the(final) rest. Having filled the deficiency, he abolished the form - the form of it is the world, that inwhich he served. - For the place where there is envy and strife is deficient, but the place where(there is) Unity is perfect. Since the deficiency came into being because the Father was not known,therefore, when the Father is known, from that moment on, the deficiency will no longer exist. Asin the case of the ignorance of a person, when he comes to have knowledge, his ignorancevanishes of itself, as the darkness vanishes when the light appears, so also the deficiency vanishesin the perfection. So from that moment on, the form is not apparent, but it will vanish in the fusionof Unity, for now their works lie scattered. In time, Unity will perfect the spaces. It is within Unitythat each one will attain himself; within knowledge, he will purify himself from multiplicity intoUnity, consuming matter within himself like fire, and darkness by light, death by life. If indeed these things have happened to each one of us, then we must see to it above all that thehouse will be holy and silent for the Unity - as in the case of some people who moved out ofdwellings having jars that in spots were not good. They would break them, and the master of thehouse would not suffer loss. Rather, <he> is glad, because in place of the bad jars (there are) fullones which are made perfect. For such is the judgment which has come from above. It has passedjudgment on everyone; it is a drawn sword, with two edges, cutting on either side. When theWord appeared, the one that is within the heart of those who utter it - it is not a sound alone, but itbecame a body - a great disturbance took place among the jars, because some had been emptied,others filled; that is, some had been supplied, others poured out, some had been purified, stillothers broken up. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed, because they had no order norstability. Error was upset, not knowing what to do; it was grieved, in mourning, afflicting itselfbecause it knew nothing. When knowledge drew near it - this is the downfall of (error) and all itsemanations - error is empty, having nothing inside. Truth appeared; all its emanations knew it. They greeted the Father in truth with a perfect powerthat joins them with the Father. For, as for everyone who loves the truth - because the truth is themouth of the Father; his tongue is the Holy Spirit - he who is joined to the truth is joined to theFather's mouth by his tongue, whenever he is to receive the Holy Spirit, since this is themanifestation of the Father, and his revelation to his aeons. He manifested what was hidden of him; he explained it. For who contains, if not the Father alone?All the spaces are his emanations. They have known that they came forth from him, like childrenwho are from a grown man. They knew that they had not yet received form, nor yet received aname, each one of which the Father begets. Then, when they receive form by his knowledge,though truly within him, they do not know him. But the Father is perfect, knowing every spacewithin him. If he wishes, he manifests whomever he wishes, by giving him form and giving him aname, and he gives a name to him, and brings it about that those come into existence who, beforethey come into existence, are ignorant of him who fashioned them. I do not say, then, that they are nothing (at all) who have not yet come into existence, but they arein him who will wish that they come into existence when he wishes, like the time that is to come.Before all things appear, he knows what he will produce. But the fruit which is not yet manifestdoes not know anything, nor does it do anything. Thus also, every space which is itself in theFather is from the one who exists, who established it from what does not exist. For he who has noroot has no fruit either, but though he thinks to himself, \"I have come into being,\" yet he willperish by himself. For this reason, he who did not exist at all will never come into existence. What,then, did he wish him to think of himself? This: \"I have come into being like the shadows andphantoms of the night.\" When the light shines on the terror which that person had experienced, heknows that it is nothing. - 272 -"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Thus, they were ignorant of the Father, he being the one whom they did not see. Since it was terrorand disturbance and instability and doubt and division, there were many illusions at work bymeans of these, and (many) empty fictions, as if they were sunk in sleep, and found themselves indisturbing dreams. Either (there is) a place to which they are fleeing, or without strength theycome (from) having chased after others, or they are involved in striking blows, or they arereceiving blows themselves, or they have fallen from high places, or they take off into the air,though they do not even have wings. Again, sometimes (it is as) if people were murdering them,though there is no one even pursuing them, or they themselves are killing their neighbors, for theyhave been stained with their blood. When those who are going through all these things wake up,they see nothing, they who were in the midst of all these disturbances, for they are nothing. Suchis the way of those who have cast ignorance aside from them like sleep, not esteeming it asanything, nor do they esteem its works as solid things either, but (rather,) they leave them behindlike a dream in the night. The knowledge of the Father, they value as the dawn. This is the wayeach one has acted, as though asleep at the time when he was ignorant. And this is the way he has<come to knowledge>, as if he had awakened. {and} Good for the man who will return andawaken. And blessed is he who has opened the eyes of the blind. And the Spirit ran after him, hastening from waking him up. Having extended his hand to himwho lay upon the ground, he set him up on his feet, for he had not yet risen. He gave them themeans of knowing the knowledge of the Father and the revelation of his Son. For when they hadseen him and had heard him, he granted them to taste him, and to smell him, and to touch thebeloved Son. When he had appeared, instructing them about the Father, the incomprehensible one, when hehad breathed into them what is in the thought, doing his will, when many had received the light,they turned to him. For the material ones were strangers, and did not see his likeness, and had notknown him. For he came by means of fleshly form, while nothing blocked his course, becauseincorruptibility is irresistible, since he, again, spoke new things, still speaking about what is in theheart of the Father, having brought forth the flawless Word. When light had spoken through his mouth, as well as his voice, which gave birth to life, he gavethem thought and understanding, and mercy and salvation, and the powerful spirit from theinfiniteness and the sweetness of the Father. Having made punishments and tortures cease - for itwas they which were leading astray from his face some who were in need of mercy, in error andin bonds - he both destroyed them with power and confounded them with knowledge. He becamea way for those who were gone astray, and knowledge for those who were ignorant, a discoveryfor those who were searching, and a support for those who were wavering, immaculateness forthose who were defiled. He is the shepherd who left behind the ninety-nine sheep which were not lost. He went searchingfor the one which had gone astray. He rejoiced when he found it, for ninety-nine is a number thatis in the left hand, which holds it. But when the one is found, the entire number passes to the right(hand). As that which lacks the one - that is, the entire right (hand) - draws what was deficient andtakes it from the left-hand side and brings (it) to the right, so too the number becomes onehundred. It is the sign of the one who is in their sound; it is the Father. Even on the Sabbath, helabored for the sheep which he found fallen into the pit. He gave life to the sheep, having broughtit up from the pit, in order that you might know interiorly - you, the sons of interior knowledge -what is the Sabbath, on which it is not fitting for salvation to be idle, in order that you may speakfrom the day from above, which has no night, and from the light which does not sink, because it isperfect. Say, then, from the heart, that you are the perfect day, and in you dwells the light that does notfail. Speak of the truth with those who search for it, and (of) knowledge to those who havecommitted sin in their error. Make firm the foot of those who have stumbled, and stretch out yourhands to those who are ill. Feed those who are hungry, and give repose to those who are weary,and raise up those who wish to rise, and awaken those who sleep. For you are the understandingthat is drawn forth.

So you,do the will of the Father, for you are from him. For the Father is sweet, and in his will is what is good. He has taken cognizance of the things thatare yours, that you might find rest in them. For by the fruits does one take cognizance of thethings that are yours, because the children of the Father are his fragrance, for they are from thegrace of his countenance. For this reason, the Father loves his fragrance, and manifests it in everyplace. And if it mixes with matter, he gives his fragrance to the light, and in his repose, he causes itto surpass every form (and) every sound. For it is not the ears that smell the fragrance, but (it is)the breath that has the sense of smell and attracts the fragrance to itself, and is submerged in thefragrance of the Father, so that he thus shelters it, and takes it to the place where it came from,from the first fragrance, which is grown cold. It is something in a psychic form, being like coldwater which has frozen (?), which is on earth that is not solid, of which those who see it think it isearth; afterwards, it dissolves again. If a breath draws it, it gets hot. The fragrances, therefore, thatare cold are from the division. For this reason, faith came; it dissolved the division, and it broughtthe warm pleroma of love, in order that the cold should not come again, but (that) there should bethe unity of perfect thought. This <is> the word of the gospel of the discovery of the pleroma, for those who await the salvationwhich is coming from on high. While their hope, for which they are waiting, is in waiting - theywhose image is light with no shadow in it - then, at that time, the pleroma is proceeding to come.The <deficiency> of matter came to be not through the limitlessness of the Father, who is comingto give time for the deficiency, although no one could say that the incorruptible one would comein this way. But the depth of the Father was multiplied, and the thought of error did not exist withhim. It is a thing that falls, (and) it is a thing that easily stands upright (again), in the discovery ofhim who has come to him whom he shall bring back. For the bringing-back is called 'repentence'. For this reason, incorruptibility breathed forth; it pursued the one who had sinned, in order thathe might rest. For forgiveness is what remains for the light in the deficiency, the word of thepleroma. For the physician runs to the place where sickness is, because that is the will that is inhim. He who has a deficiency, then, does not hide it, because one has what the other lacks. So thepleroma, which has no deficiency, but (which) fills up the deficiency, is what he provided fromhimself for filling up what he lacks, in order that therefore he might receive the grace. For when hewas deficient, he did not have the grace. That is why there was diminution existing in the placewhere there is no grace. When that which was diminished was received, he revealed what helacked, being (now) a pleroma; that is the discovery of the light of truth which rose upon himbecause it is immutable. That is why Christ was spoken of in their midst, so that those who were disturbed might receive abringing-back, and he might anoint them with the ointment. This ointment is the mercy of theFather, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anointed are the ones who havebecome perfect. For full jars are the ones that are usually anointed. But when the anointing of one(jar) is dissolved, it is emptied, and the reason for there being a deficiency is the thing by which itsointment goes. For at that time a breath draws it, a thing in the power of that which is with it. Butfrom him who has no deficiency, no seal is removed, nor is anything emptied, but what he lacks,the perfect Father fills again. He is good. He knows his plantings, because it is he who plantedthem in his paradise. Now his paradise is his place of rest. This is the perfection in the thought of the Father, and these are the words of his meditation. Eachone of his words is the work of his one will in the revelation of his Word. While they were stilldepths of his thought, the Word, which was first to come forth, revealed them, along with a mindthat speaks the one Word in silent grace. He was called 'thought', since they were in it beforebeing revealed. It came about, then, that he was first to come forth, at the time when the will ofhim who willed desired it. And the will is what the Father rests in, and is pleased with. Nothing- 274 -"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"happens without him, nor does anything happen without the will of the Father, but his will isunsearchable. His trace is the will, and no one will know him, nor is it possible for one toscrutinize him, in order to grasp him. But when he wills, what he wills is this - even if the sightdoes not please them in any way before God - desiring the Father. For he knows the beginning ofall of them, and their end. For at their end, he will question them directly. Now, the end isreceiving knowledge about the one who is hidden, and this is the Father, from whom thebeginning came forth, (and) to whom all will return who have come forth from him. And theyhave appeared for the glory and the joy of his name. Now the name of the Father is the Son. It is he who first gave a name to the one who came forthfrom him, who was himself, and he begot him as a son. He gave him his name, which belonged tohim; he is the one to whom belongs all that exists around him, the Father. His is the name; his isthe Son. It is possible for him to be seen. The name, however, is invisible, because it alone is themystery of the invisible, which comes to ears that are completely filled with it by him. For indeed,the Father's name is not spoken, but (rather,) it is apparent through a Son. In this way, then, the name is a great thing. Who, therefore, will be able to utter a name for him,the great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs, and the sons of the name, in whomrested the name of the Father, (who) in turn themselves rested in his name? Since the Father isunengendered, he alone is the one who begot him for him(self) as a name, before he brought forththe aeons, in order that the name of the Father should be over their head as lord, that is the namein truth, which is firm in his command, through perfect power. For the name is not from (mere)words, nor does his name consist of appellations, but (rather,) it is invisible. He gave a name tohim alone, since he alone sees him, he alone having the power to give him a name. For he whodoes not exist has no name. For what name is given to him who does not exist? But the one whoexists, exists also with his name, and he alone knows it, and (he) alone (knows how) to give him aname. It is the Father. The Son is his name. He did not, therefore, hide it in the thing, but it existed;as for the Son, he alone gave a name. The name, therefore, is that of the Father, as the name of theFather is the Son. Where indeed would compassion find a name, except with the Father? But no doubt one will say to his neighbor: \"Who is it who will give a name to him who existedbefore himself, as if offspring did not receive a name from those who begot <them>?\" First, then, itis fitting for us to reflect on this matter: What is the name? It is the name in truth; it is not thereforethe name from the Father, for it is the one which is the proper name. Therefore, he did not receivethe name on loan, as (do) others, according to the form in which each one is to be produced. Butthis is the proper name. There is no one else who gave it to him. But he <is> unnamable,indescribable, until the time when he who is perfect spoke of him alone. And it is he who has thepower to speak his name, and to see it. When, therefore, it pleased him that his name, which is loved, should be his Son, and he gave thename to him, that is, him who came forth from the depth, he spoke about his secret things,knowing that the Father is a being without evil. For that very reason, he brought him forth inorder to speak about the place, and (about) his resting-place, from which he had come forth, andto glorify the pleroma, the greatness of his name, and the sweetness of the Father. About the placeeach one came from, he will speak, and to the region where he received his establishment, he willhasten to return again and to take from that place - the place where he stood - receiving a tastefrom that place, and receiving nourishment, receiving growth. And his own resting-place is hispleroma. Therefore, all the emanations of the Father are pleromas, and the root of all his emanations is inthe one who made them all grow up in himself. He assigned them their destinies. Each one, then,is manifest, in order that through their own thought <...>. For the place to which they send theirthought, that place, their root, is what takes them up in all the heights, to the Father. They possesshis head, which is rest for them, and they are supported, approaching him, as though to say thatthey have participated in his face by means of kisses. But they do not become manifest in this way,for they are not themselves exalted; (yet) neither did they lack the glory of the Father, nor did theythink of him as small, nor that he is harsh, nor that he is wrathful, but (rather that) he is a being- 275 -"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"without evil, imperturbable, sweet, knowing all spaces before they have come into existence, andhe had no need to be instructed. This is the manner of those who possess (something) from above of the immensurable greatness,as they wait for the one alone, and the perfect one, the one who is there for them. And they do notgo down to Hades, nor have they envy nor groaning nor death within them, but (rather) they restin him who is at rest, not striving nor being twisted around the truth. But they themselves are thetruth; and the Father is within them, and they are in the Father, being perfect, being undivided inthe truly good one, being in no way deficient in anything, but they are set at rest, refreshed in theSpirit. And they will heed their root. They will be concerned with those (things) in which he willfind his root, and not suffer loss to his soul. This is the place of the blessed; this is their place. For the rest, then, may they know, in their places, that it is not fitting for me, having come to be inthe resting-place, to speak of anything else. But it is in it that I shall come to be, and (it is fitting) tobe concerned at all times with the Father of the all, and the true brothers, those upon whom thelove of the Father is poured out, and in whose midst there is no lack of him. They are the oneswho appear in truth, since they exist in true and eternal life, and (since they) speak of the lightwhich is perfect, and (which is) filled with the seed of the Father, and which is in his heart and inthe pleroma, while his Spirit rejoices in it and glorifies the one in whom it existed, because he isgood. And his children are perfect and worthy of his name, for he is the Father; it is children ofthis kind that he loves. - 276 -"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"F r a g m e n t sCODEX XIItranslation not provided here- 277 -"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"T r i m o r p h i c P r o t e n n o i aCODEX XIIITranslated by John D.

I am the movement that dwells in the All,she in whom the All takes its stand, the first-born among those who came to be, she who existsbefore the All. She (Protennoia) is called by three names, although she dwells alone, since she isperfect. I am invisible within the Thought of the Invisible One. I am revealed in the immeasurable,ineffable (things). I am incomprehensible, dwelling in the incomprehensible. I move in everycreature. I am the life of my Epinoia that dwells within every Power and every eternal movement, and (in)invisible Lights and within the Archons and Angels and Demons, and every soul dwelling inTartaros, and (in) every material soul. I dwell in those who came to be. I move in everyone and Idelve into them all. I walk uprightly, and those who sleep, I awaken. And I am the sight of thosewho dwell in sleep. I am the Invisible One within the All. It is I who counsel those who are hidden, since I know theAll that exists in it. I am numberless beyond everyone. I am immeasurable, ineffable, yetwhenever I wish, I shall reveal myself of my own accord. I am the head of the All. I exist beforethe All, and I am the All, since I exist in everyone. I am a Voice speaking softly. I exist from the first. I dwell within the Silence that surrounds everyone of them. And it is the hidden Voice that dwells within my, within the incomprehensible,immeasurable Thought, within the immeasurable Silence. I descended to the midst of the underworld, and I shone down upon the darkness. It is I whopoured forth the water. It is I who am hidden within radiant waters. I am the one who graduallyput forth the All by my Thought. It is I who am laden with the Voice. It is through me that Gnosiscomes forth. I dwell in the ineffable and unknowable ones. I am perception and knowledge,uttering a Voice by means of thought. I am the real Voice. I cry out in everyone, and theyrecognize it (the voice), since a seed indwells them. I am the Thought of the Father, and throughme proceeded the Voice, that is, the knowledge of the everlasting things. I exist as Thought for theAll -- being joined to the unknowable and incomprehensible Thought -- I revealed myself -- yes, I-- among all those who recognize me. For it is I who am joined with everyone by virtue of thehidden Thought and an exalted <Voice>, even a Voice from the invisible Thought. And it isimmeasurable, since it dwells in the Immeasurable One. It is a mystery; it is unrestrainable by theIncomprehensible One. It is invisible to all those who are visible in the All. It is a Light dwelling inLight. It is we also who alone have separated from the visible world, since we are saved by the hiddenwisdom, by means of the ineffable, immeasurable Voice. And he who is hidden within us pays thetributes of his fruit to the Water of Life. Then the Son who is perfect in every respect -- that is, the Word who originated through thatVoice; who proceeded from the height; who has within him the Name; who is a Light -- herevealed the everlasting things, and all the unknowns were known. And those things difficult tointerpet and secret, he revealed. And as for those who dwell in Silence with the First Thought, hepreached to them. And he revealed himself to those who dwell in darkness, and he showedhimself to those who dwell in the abyss, and to those who dwell in the hidden treasuries, he toldineffable mysteries, and he taught unrepeatable doctrines to all those who became Sons of theLight. Now the Voice that originated from my Thought exists as three permanences: the Father, theMother, the Son. Existing perceptibly as Speech, it (Voice) has within it a Word endowed with- 278 -"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"every <glory>, and it has three masculinities, three powers, and three names. They exist in themanner of Three ... -- which are quadrangels -- secretly within a silence of the Ineffable One. It is he alone who came to be, that is, the Christ. And, as for me, I anointed him as the glory of theInvisible Spirit, with goodness. Now the Three, I established alone in eternal glory over the Aeonsin the Living Water, that is, the glory that surrounds him who first came forth to the Light of thoseexalted Aeons, and it is in glorious Light that he firmly perseveres. And he stood in his own Lightthat surrounds him, that is, the Eye of the Light that gloriously shines on me. He perpetuated theFather of all Aeons, who am I, the Thought of the Father, Protennoia, that is, Barbelo, the perfectGlory, and the immeasurable Invisible One who is hidden. I am the Image of the Invisible Spirit,and it is through me that the All took shape, and (I am) the Mother (as well as) the Light whichshe appointed as Virgin, she who is called 'Meirothea', the incomprehensible Womb, theunrestrainable and immeasurable Voice. Then the Perfect Son revealed himself to his Aeons, who originated through him, and he revealedthem and glorified them, and gave them thrones, and stood in the glory with which he glorifiedhimself. They blessed the Perfect Son, the Christ, the only-begotten God. And they gave glory,saying, \"He is! He is! The Son of God! The Son of God! It is he who is! The Aeon of Aeons,beholding the Aeons which he begot. For thou hast begotten by thine own desire! Therefore weglorify thee: ma mo o o o eia ei on ei! The Aeon of Aeons! The Aeon which he gave!\" Then, moreover, the God who was begotten gave them (the Aeons) a power of life on which theymight rely, and he established them. The first Aeon he established over the first: Armedon,Nousanios, Armozel; the second he established over the second Aeon: Phaionios, Ainios, Oroiael;the third over the third Aeon: Mellephaneus, Loios, Daveithai; the fourth over the fourth:Mousanios, Amethes, Eleleth. Now those Aeons were begotten by the God who was begotten - theChrist - and these Aeons received as well as gave glory. They were the first to appear, exalted intheir thought, and each Aeon gave myriads of glories within great untraceable lights, and they alltogether blessed the perfect Son, the God who was begotten. Then there came forth a word from the great Light Eleleth, and said, \"I am king! Who belongs toChaos and who belongs to the underworld?\" And at that instant, his Light appeared, radiant,endowed with the Epinoia. The Powers of the Powers did not entreat him, and likewiseimmediately there appeared the great Demon who rules over the lowest part of the underworldand Chaos. He has neither form nor perfection, but, on the contrary, possesses the form of theglory of those begotten in the darkness. Now he is called 'Saklas', that is, 'Samael', 'Yaltabaoth', hewho had taken power; who had snatched it away from the innocent one (Sophia); who had earlieroverpowered her who is the Light`s Epinoia who had descended, her from whom he had comeforth from originally. Now when the Epinoia of the Light realized that he (Yaltabaoth) had begged him (the Light) foranother order, even though he was lower than she, she said, \"Give me another order, so that youmay become for me a dwelling place, lest I dwell in disorder forever.\" And the order of the entirehouse of glory was agreed upon her word. A blessing was brought for her and the higher orderreleased it to her. And the great Demon began to produce aeons in the likeness of the real Aeons, except that heproduced them out of his own power. Then I too revealed my Voice secretly, saying, \"Cease! Desist, (you) who tread on matter; forbehold, I am coming down to the world of mortals for the sake of my portion that was in thatplace from the time when the innocent Sophia was conquered, she who descended, so that I mightthwart their aim which the one revealed by her appoints.\" And all were disturbed, each one whodwells in the house of the ignorant light, and the abyss trembled. And the Archigenetor ofignorance reigned over Chaos and the underworld, and produced a man in my likeness. But heneither knew that that one would become for him a sentence of dissolution, nor does he recognizethe power in him. But now I have come down and reached down to Chaos. And I was with my own who were inthat place. I am hidden within them, empowering them, giving them shape.

And the high walls of darkness I overthrew,and the secure gates of those pitiless ones I broke, and I smashed their bars. And the evil force,and the one who beats you, and the one who hinders you, and the tyrant, and the adversary, andthe one who is King, and the present enemy, indeed all these I explained to those who are mine,who are the Sons of the Light, in order that they might nullify them all, and be saved from allthose bonds, and enter into the place where they were at first. I am the first one who descended on account of my portion which remains, that is, the Spirit thatdwells in the soul, which originated from the Water of Life, and out of the immersion of themysteries. And I spoke, I, together with the Archons and Authorities. For I had gone down belowtheir language, and I spoke my mysteries to my own - a hidden mystery - and the bonds andeternal oblivion were nullified. And I bore fruit in them, that is, the Thought of the unchangingAeon, and my house, and their Father. And I went down to those who were mine from the first,and I reached them and broke the first strands that enslaved them. Then everyone of those withinme shone, and I prepared a pattern for those ineffable Lights that are within me. Amen. The Discourse of Protennoia: One I am the Voice that appeared through my Thought, for I am 'He who is syzygetic' since I am called'the Thought of the Invisible One'. Since I am called 'the unchanging Speech', I am called 'She whois syzygetic'. I am a single one, since I am undefiled. I am the Mother of the Voice, speaking in many ways,completing the All. It is in me that knowledge dwells, the knowledge of <things> everlasting. It isI who speak within every creature, and I was known by the All. It is I who lift up the Speech of theVoice to the ears of those who have known me, that is, the Sons of the Light. Now I have come the second time in the likeness of a female, and have spoken with them. And Ishall tell them of the coming end of the Aeon and teach them of the beginning of the Aeon tocome, the one without change, the one in which our appearance will be changed. We shall bepurified within those Aeons from which I revealed myself in the Thought of the likeness of mymasculinity. I settled among those who are worthy in the Thought of my changeless Aeon. For I shall tell you a mystery of this particular Aeon, and tell you about the forces that are in it.The birth beckons; hour begets hour, day begets day. The months made known the month.Timehas gone round succeeding time. This particular Aeon was completed in this fashion, and it wasestimated, and it (was) short, for it was a finger that released a finger, and a joint that wasseparated from a joint. Then, when the great Authorities knew that the time of fulfillment hadappeared - just as in the pangs of the parturient it (the time) has drawn near, so also had thedestruction approached - all together the elements trembled, and the foundations of theunderworld and the ceilings of Chaos shook, and a great fire shone within their midst, and therocks and the earth were shaken like a reed shaken by the wind. And the lots of Fate and thosewho apportion the domiciles were greatly disturbed over a great thunder. And the thrones of thePowers were disturbed, since they were overturned, and their King was afraid. And those whopursue Fate paid their allotment of visits to the path, and they said to the Powers, \"What is thisdisturbance and this shaking that has come upon us through a Voice <belonging> to the exaltedSpeech? And our entire habitation has been shaken, and the entire circuit of the path of ascent hasmet with destruction, and the path upon which we go, which takes us up to the Archgenitor of ourbirth, has ceased to be established for us.\" Then the Powers answered, saying, \"We too are at loss about it, since we did not know what wasresponsible for it. But arise, let us go up to the Archgenitor and ask him.\" And the powers allgathered and went up to the Archgenitor. They said to him, \"Where is your boasting in which youboast?

Now behold, there has appeared a Voice belonging to that invisibleSpeech of the Aeon which we know not. And we ourselves did not recognize to whom we belong,for that Voice which we listened to is foreign to us, and we did not recognize it; we did not knowwhence it was. It came and put fear in our midst and weakening in the members of our arms. Sonow let us weep and mourn most bitterly! As for the future, let us make our entire flight before weare imprisoned perforce, and taken down to the bosom of the underworld. For already theslackening of our bondage has approached, and the times are cut short, and the days haveshortened, and our time has been fulfilled, and the weeping of our destruction has approached us,so that we may be taken to the place we recognize. For as for our tree from which we grew, a fruitof ignorance is what it has; and also its leaves, it is death that dwells in them, and darkness dwellsunder the shadow of its boughs. And it was in deceit and lust that we harvested it, this (tree)through which ignorant Chaos became for us a dwelling place. For behold, even he, theArchgenitor of our birth, about whom we boast, even he did not know this Speech.\" So now, O sons of the Thought, listen to me, to the Speech of the Mother of your mercy, for youhave become worthy of the mystery hidden from the Aeons, so that you might receive it. And theconsummation of this particular Aeon and of the evil life has approached, and there dawns thebeginning of the Aeon to come, which has no change forever. I am androgynous. I am Mother (and) I am Father, since I copulate with myself. I copulated withmyself and with those who love me, and it is through me alone that the All stands firm. I am theWomb that gives shape to the All by giving birth to the Light that shines in splendor. I am theAeon to come. I am the fulfillment of the All, that is, Meirothea, the glory of the Mother.

Here is the demonstration. How well it suits all men, on the subject of chaos, to say that it is a kind of darkness! But in fact itcomes from a shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'. And the shadow comes froma product that has existed since the beginning. It is, moreover, clear that it existed before chaoscame into being, and that the latter is posterior to the first product. Let us therefore concernourselves with the facts of the matter; and furthermore, with the first product, from which chaoswas projected. And in this way the truth will be clearly demonstrated. After the natural structure of the immortal beings had completely developed out of the infinite, alikeness then emanated from Pistis (Faith); it is called Sophia (Wisdom). It exercised volition andbecame a product resembling the primeval light. And immediately her will manifested itself as alikeness of heaven, having an unimaginable magnitude; it was between the immortal beings andthose things that came into being after them, like [...]: she (Sophia) functioned as a veil dividingmankind from the things above. Now the eternal realm (aeon) of truth has no shadow outside it, for the limitless light iseverywhere within it. But its exterior is shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'.From it, there appeared a force, presiding over the darkness. And the forces that came into beingsubsequent to them called the shadow 'the limitless chaos'. From it, every kind of divinitysprouted up [...] together with the entire place, so that also, shadow is posterior to the firstproduct. It was <in> the abyss that it (shadow) appeared, deriving from the aforementioned Pistis.Then shadow perceived there was something mightier than it, and felt envy; and when it hadbecome pregnant of its own accord, suddenly it engendered jealousy. Since that day, the principleof jealousy amongst all the eternal realms and their worlds has been apparent. Now as for thatjealousy, it was found to be an abortion without any spirit in it. Like a shadow, it came intoexistence in a vast watery substance. Then the bile that had come into being out of the shadowwas thrown into a part of chaos. Since that day, a watery substance has been apparent. And whatsank within it flowed away, being visible in chaos: as with a woman giving birth to a child - all hersuperfluities flow out; just so, matter came into being out of shadow, and was projected apart.And it did not depart from chaos; rather, matter was in chaos, being in a part of it. And when these things had come to pass, then Pistis came and appeared over the matter of chaos,which had been expelled like an aborted fetus - since there was no spirit in it. For all of it (chaos)was limitless darkness and bottomless water. Now when Pistis saw what had resulted from herdefect, she became disturbed. And the disturbance appeared, as a fearful product; it rushed to herin the chaos. She turned to it and blew into its face in the abyss, which is below all the heavens. And when Pistis Sophia desired to cause the thing that had no spirit to be formed into a likenessand to rule over matter and over all her forces, there appeared for the first time a ruler, out of thewaters, lion-like in appearance, androgynous, having great authority within him, and ignorant ofwhence he had come into being. Now when Pistis Sophia saw him moving about in the depth ofthe waters, she said to him, \"Child, pass through to here,\" whose equivalent is 'yalda baoth'. Since that day, there appeared the principle of verbal expression, which reached the gods and theangels and mankind. And what came into being as a result of verbal expression, the gods and the- 284 -"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"angels and mankind finished. Now as for the ruler Yaltabaoth, he is ignorant of the force of Pistis:he did not see her face, rather he saw in the water the likeness that spoke with him. And becauseof that voice, he called himself 'Yaldabaoth'. But 'Ariael' is what the perfect call him, for he waslike a lion. Now when he had come to have authority over matter, Pistis Sophia withdrew up toher light. When the ruler saw his magnitude - and it was only himself that he saw: he saw nothing else,except for water and darkness - then he supposed that it was he alone who existed. His [...] wascompleted by verbal expression: it appeared as a spirit moving to and fro upon the waters. Andwhen that spirit appeared, the ruler set apart the watery substance. And what was dry wasdivided into another place. And from matter, he made for himself an abode, and he called it'heaven'. And from matter, the ruler made a footstool, and he called it 'earth'. Next, the ruler had a thought - consistent with his nature - and by means of verbal expression hecreated an androgyne. He opened his mouth and cooed to him. When his eyes had been opened,he looked at his father, and he said to him, \"Eee!\" Then his father called him Eee-a-o ('Yao'). Nexthe created the second son. He cooed to him. And he opened his eyes and said to his father, \"Eh!\"His father called him 'Eloai'. Next, he created the third son. He cooed to him. And he opened hiseyes and said to his father, \"Asss!\" His father called him 'Astaphaios'. These are the three sons oftheir father. Seven appeared in chaos, androgynous. They have their masculine names and their femininenames.The feminine name is Pronoia (Forethought) Sambathas, which is 'week'. And his son is called Yao: his feminine name is Lordship. Sabaoth: his feminine name is Deity. Adonaios: his feminine name is Kingship. Elaios: his feminine name is Jealousy. Oraios: his feminine name is Wealth. And Astaphaios: his feminine name is Sophia (Wisdom). These are the seven forces of the seven heavens of chaos. And they were born androgynous,consistent with the immortal pattern that existed before them, according to the wish of Pistis: sothat the likeness of what had existed since the beginning might reign to the end. You will find theeffect of these names and the force of the male entities in the Archangelic (Book) of the Prophet Moses,and the names of the female entities in the first Book of Noraia. Now the prime parent Yaldabaoth, since he possessed great authorities, created heavens for eachof his offspring through verbal expression - created them beautiful, as dwelling places - and ineach heaven he created great glories, seven times excellent. Thrones and mansions and temples,and also chariots and virgin spirits up to an invisible one and their glories, each one has these inhis heaven; mighty armies of gods and lords and angels and archangels - countless myriads - sothat they might serve. The account of these matters you will find in a precise manner in the firstAccount of Oraia. And they were completed from this heaven to as far up as the sixth heaven, namely that of Sophia.The heaven and his earth were destroyed by the troublemaker that was below them all. And thesix heavens shook violently; for the forces of chaos knew who it was that had destroyed theheaven that was below them. And when Pistis knew about the breakage resulting from thedisturbance, she sent forth her breath and bound him and cast him down into Tartaros. Since thatday, the heaven, along with its earth, has consolidated itself through Sophia the daughter ofYaldabaoth, she who is below them all. Now when the heavens had consolidated themselves along with their forces and all theiradministration, the prime parent became insolent. And he was honored by all the army of angels.And all the gods and their angels gave blessing and honor to him. And for his part, he wasdelighted and continually boasted, saying to them, \"I have no need of anyone.\" He said, \"It is I- 285 -"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"who am God, and there is no other one that exists apart from me.\" And when he said this, hesinned against all the immortal beings who give answer. And they laid it to his charge. Then when Pistis saw the impiety of the chief ruler, she was filled with anger. She was invisible.She said, \"You are mistaken, Samael,\" (that is, \"blind god\"). \"There is an immortal man of lightwho has been in existence before you, and who will appear among your modelled forms; he willtrample you to scorn, just as potter's clay is pounded. And you will descend to your mother, theabyss, along with those that belong to you. For at the consummation of your (pl.) works, the entiredefect that has become visible out of the truth will be abolished, and it will cease to be, and will belike what has never been.\" Saying this, Pistis revealed her likeness of her greatness in the waters.And so doing, she withdrew up to her light. Now when Sabaoth, the son of Yaldabaoth, heard the voice of Pistis, he sang praises to her, and hecondemned the father [...] at the word of Pistis; and he praised her because she had instructedthem about the immortal man and his light. Then Pistis Sophia stretched out her finger andpoured upon him some light from her light, to be a condemnation of his father. Then whenSabaoth was illumined, he received great authority against all the forces of chaos. Since that dayhe has been called \"Lord of the Forces\". He hated his father, the darkness, and his mother, the abyss, and loathed his sister, the thought ofthe prime parent, which moved to and fro upon the waters. And because of his light, all theauthorities of chaos were jealous of him. And when they had become disturbed, they made a greatwar in the seven heavens. Then when Pistis Sophia had seen the war, she dispatched sevenarchangels to Sabaoth from her light. They snatched him up to the seventh heaven. They stoodbefore him as attendants. Furthermore, she sent him three more archangels, and established thekingdom for him over everyone, so that he might dwell above the twelve gods of chaos. Now when Sabaoth had taken up the place of repose in return for his repentance, Pistis also gavehim her daughter Zoe (Life), together with great authority, so that she might instruct him about allthings that exist in the eighth heaven. And as he had authority, he made himself first of all amansion. It is huge, magnificent, seven times as great as all those that exist in the seven heavens. And before his mansion he created a throne, which was huge and was upon a four-faced chariotcalled \"Cherubin\". Now the Cherubin has eight shapes per each of the four corners, lion forms andcalf forms and human forms and eagle forms, so that all the forms amount to sixty-four forms -and seven archangels that stand before it; he is the eighth, and has authority. All the formsamount to seventy-two. Furthermore, from this chariot the seventy-two gods took shape; theytook shape so that they might rule over the seventy-two languages of the peoples. And by thatthrone he created other, serpent-like angels, called \"Seraphin\", which praise him at all times. Thereafter he created a congregation of angels, thousands and myriads, numberless, whichresembled the congregation in the eighth heaven; and a firstborn called Israel - which is, \"the man that sees God\"; and another being, called Jesus Christ, who resemblesthe savior above in the eighth heaven, and who sits at his right upon a revered throne. And at hisleft, there sits the virgin of the holy spirit, upon a throne and glorifying him. And the sevenvirgins stand before her, [...] possessing thirty harps, and psalteries and trumpets, glorifying him.And all the armies of the angels glorify him, and they bless him. Now where he sits is upon athrone of light <within a> great cloud that covers him. And there was no one with him in thecloud except Sophia <the daughter of> Pistis, instructing him about all the things that exist in theeighth heaven, so that the likenesses of those things might be created, in order that his reign mightendure until the consummation of the heavens of chaos and their forces. Now Pistis Sophia set him apart from the darkness and summoned him to her right, and the primeparent she put at her left. Since that day, right has been called justice, and left called wickedness.Now because of this, they all received a realm in the congregation of justice and wickedness, [...]stand [...] upon a creature [...] all. Thus, when the prime parent of chaos saw his son Sabaoth and the glory that he was in, andperceived that he was greatest of all the authorities of chaos, he envied him. And having becomewrathful, he engendered Death out of his death: and he (viz., Death) was established over the- 286 -"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"sixth heaven, <for> Sabaoth had been snatched up from there. And thus the number of the sixauthorities of chaos was achieved. Then Death, being androgynous, mingled with his (own)nature and begot seven androgynous offspring. These are the names of the male ones: Jealousy,Wrath, Tears, Sighing, Suffering, Lamentation, Bitter Weeping. And these are the names of thefemale ones: Wrath, Pain, Lust, Sighing, Curse, Bitterness, Quarrelsomeness. They had intercoursewith one another, and each one begot seven, so that they amount to forty-nine androgynousdemons. Their names and their effects you will find in the Book of Solomon. And in the presence of these, Zoe, who was with Sabaoth, created seven good androgynous forces.These are the names of the male ones: the Unenvious, the Blessed, the Joyful, the True, theUnbegrudging, the Beloved, the Trustworthy. Also, as regards the female ones, these are theirnames: Peace, Gladness, Rejoicing, Blessedness, Truth, Love, Faith (Pistis). And from these aremany good and innocent spirits. Their influences and their effects you will find in theConfigurations of the Fate of Heaven That Is Beneath the Twelve. And having seen the likeness of Pistis in the waters, the prime parent grieved very much,especially when he heard her voice, like the first voice that had called to him out of the waters.And when he knew that it was she who had given a name to him, he sighed. He was ashamed onaccount of his transgression. And when he had come to know in truth that an immortal man oflight had been existing before him, he was greatly disturbed; for he had previously said to all thegods and their angels, \"It is I who am god. No other one exists apart from me.\" For he had beenafraid they might know that another had been in existence before him, and might condemn him.But he, being devoid of understanding, scoffed at the condemnation and acted recklessly. He said,\"If anything has existed before me, let it appear, so that we may see its light.\" And immediately, behold! Light came out of the eighth heaven above and passed through all ofthe heavens of the earth. When the prime parent saw that the light was beautiful as it radiated, hewas amazed. And he was greatly ashamed. As that light appeared, a human likeness appearedwithin it, very wonderful. And no one saw it except for the prime parent and Pronoia, who waswith him. Yet its light appeared to all the forces of the heavens. Because of this they were alltroubled by it. Then when Pronoia saw that emissary, she became enamored of him. But he hated her because shewas on the darkness. But she desired to embrace him, and she was not able to. When she wasunable to assuage her love, she poured out her light upon the earth. Since that day, that emissaryhas been called \"Adam of Light,\" whose rendering is \"the luminous man of blood,\" and the earthspread over him, holy Adaman, whose rendering is \"the Holy Land of Adamantine.\" Since thatday, all the authorities have honored the blood of the virgin. And the earth was purified onaccount of the blood of the virgin. But most of all, the water was purified through the likeness ofPistis Sophia, who had appeared to the prime parent in the waters. Justly, then, it has been said:\"through the waters.\" The holy water, since it vivifies the all, purifies it. Out of that first blood Eros appeared, being androgynous. His masculinity is Himireris, being firefrom the light. His femininity that is with him - a soul of blood - is from the stuff of Pronoia. He isvery lovely in his beauty, having a charm beyond all the creatures of chaos. Then all the gods andtheir angels, when they beheld Eros, became enamored of him. And appearing in all of them, heset them afire: just as from a single lamp many lamps are lit, and one and the same light is there,but the lamp is not diminished. And in this way, Eros became dispersed in all the created beingsof chaos, and was not diminished. Just as from the midpoint of light and darkness Eros appearedand at the midpoint of the angels and mankind the sexual union of Eros was consummated, so outof the earth the primal pleasure blossomed. The woman followed earth. And marriage followedwoman. Birth followed marriage. Dissolution followed birth. After that Eros, the grapevine sprouted up out of that blood, which had been shed over the earth.Because of this, those who drink of it conceive the desire of sexual union. After the grapevine, a figtree and a pomegranate tree sprouted up from the earth, together with the rest of the trees, allspecies, having with them their seed from the seed of the authorities and their angels. - 287 -"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Then Justice created Paradise, being beautiful and being outside the orbit of the moon and theorbit of the sun in the Land of Wantonness, in the East in the midst of the stones. And desire is inthe midst of the beautiful, appetizing trees. And the tree of eternal life is as it appeared by God'swill, to the north of Paradise, so that it might make eternal the souls of the pure, who shall comeforth from the modelled forms of poverty at the consummation of the age. Now the color of thetree of life is like the sun. And its branches are beautiful. Its leaves are like those of the cypress. Itsfruit is like a bunch of grapes when it is white. Its height goes as far as heaven. And next to it (is)the tree of knowledge (gnosis), having the strength of God. Its glory is like the moon when fullyradiant. And its branches are beautiful. Its leaves are like fig leaves. Its fruit is like a goodappetizing date. And this tree is to the north of Paradise, so that it might arouse the souls from thetorpor of the demons, in order that they might approach the tree of life and eat of its fruit, and socondemn the authorities and their angels. The effect of this tree is described in the Sacred Book, towit: \"It is you who are the tree of knowledge, which is in Paradise, from which the first man ateand which opened his mind; and he loved his female counterpart and condemned the other, alienlikenesses and loathed them.\" Now after it, the olive tree sprouted up, which was to purify the kings and the high priests ofrighteousness, who were to appear in the last days, since the olive tree appeared out of the light ofthe first Adam for the sake of the unguent that they were to receive. And the first soul (psyche) loved Eros, who was with her, and poured her blood upon him andupon the earth. And out of that blood the rose first sprouted up, out of the earth, out of the thornbush, to be a source of joy for the light that was to appear in the bush. Moreover, after this thebeautiful, good-smelling flowers sprouted up from the earth, different kinds, from every singlevirgin of the daughters of Pronoia. And they, when they had become enamored of Eros, pouredout their blood upon him and upon the earth. After these, every plant sprouted up from the earth,different kinds, containing the seed of the authorities and their angels. After these, the authoritiescreated out of the waters all species of beast, and the reptiles and birds - different kinds -containing the seed of the authorities and their angels. But before all these, when he had appeared on the first the first day, he remained upon the earth,something like two days, and left the lower Pronoia in heaven, and ascended towards his light.And immediately darkness covered all the universe. Now when she wished, the Sophia who wasin the lower heaven received authority from Pistis, and fashioned great luminous bodies and allthe stars. And she put them in the sky to shine upon the earth and to render temporal signs andseasons and years and months and days and nights and moments and so forth. And in this waythe entire region upon the sky was adorned. Now when Adam of Light conceived the wish to enter his light - i.e., the eighth heaven - he wasunable to do so because of the poverty that had mingled with his light. Then he created for himselfa vast eternal realm. And within that eternal realm he created six eternal realms and theiradornments, six in number, that were seven times better than the heavens of chaos and theiradornments. Now all these eternal realms and their adornments exist within the infinity that isbetween the eighth heaven and the chaos below it, being counted with the universe that belongsto poverty. If you want to know the arrangement of these, you will find it written in the SeventhUniverse of the Prophet Hieralias. And before Adam of Light had withdrawn in the chaos, the authorities saw him and laughed atthe prime parent because he had lied when he said, \"It is I who am God. No one exists before me.\"When they came to him, they said, \"Is this not the god who ruined our work?\" He answered andsaid, \"Yes. If you do not want him to be able to ruin our work, come let us create a man out ofearth, according to the image of our body and according to the likeness of this being, to serve us;so that when he sees his likeness, he might become enamored of it. No longer will he ruin ourwork; rather,we shall make those who are born out of the light our servants for all the duration ofthis eternal realm.\" Now all of this came to pass according to the forethought of Pistis, in orderthat man should appear after his likeness, and should condemn them because of their modelledform. And their modelled form became an enclosure of the light. - 288 -"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Then the authorities received the knowledge (gnosis) necessary to create man. Sophia Zoe - shewho is with Sabaoth - had anticipated them. And she laughed at their decision. For they are blind:against their own interests they ignorantly created him. And they do not realize what they areabout to do. The reason she anticipated them and made her own man first, was in order that hemight instruct their modelled form how to despise them, and thus to escape from them. Now the production of the instructor came about as follows. When Sophia let fall a droplet oflight, it flowed onto the water, and immediately a human being appeared, being androgynous.That droplet she molded first as a female body. Afterwards, using the body she molded it in thelikeness of the mother, which had appeared. And he finished it in twelve months. Anandrogynous human being was produced, whom the Greeks call Hermaphrodites; and whosemother the Hebrews call Eve of Life (Zoe), namely, the female instructor of life. Her offspring isthe creature that is lord. Afterwards, the authorities called it \"Beast\", so that it might lead astraytheir modelled creatures. The interpretation of \"the beast\" is \"the instructor\". For it was found to bethe wisest of all beings. Now, Eve is the first virgin, the one who without a husband bore her first offspring. It is she whoserved as her own midwife. For this reason she is held to have said: It is I who am the part of my mother; and it is I who am the mother. It is I who am the wife; it is I who am the virgin. It is I who am pregnant; it is I who am the midwife. It is I who am the one that comforts pains of travail. It is my husband who bore me; and it is I who am his mother. And it is he who is my father and my lord. It is he who is my force; What he desires, he says with reason. I am in the process of becoming; yet I have borne a man as lord. Now these through the will <...> The souls that were going to enter the modelled forms of theauthorities were manifested to Sabaoth and his Christ. And regarding these, the holy voice said,\"Multiply and improve! Be lord over all creatures.\" And it is they who were taken captive,according to their destinies, by the prime parent. And thus they were shut into the prisons of themodelled forms until the consummation of the age. And at that time, the prime parent then rendered an opinion concerning man to those who werewith him. Then each of them cast his sperm into the midst of the navel of the earth. Since that day,the seven rulers have fashioned man with his body resembling their body, but his likenessresembling the man that had appeared to them. His modelling took place by parts, one at a time.And their leader fashioned the brain and the nervous system. Afterwards, he appeared as prior tohim. He became a soul-endowed man. And he was called Adam, that is, \"father\", according to thename of the one that existed before him. And when they had finished Adam, he abandoned him as an inanimate vessel, since he had takenform like an abortion, in that no spirit was in him. Regarding this thing, when the chief rulerremembered the saying of Pistis, he was afraid lest the true man enter his modelled form andbecome its lord. For this reason he left his modelled form forty days without soul, and hewithdrew and abandoned it. Now on the fortieth day, Sophia Zoe sent her breath into Adam, whohad no soul. He began to move upon the ground. And he could not stand up. Then, when the seven rulers came, they saw him and were greatly disturbed. They went up to himand seized him. And he (viz., the chief ruler) said to the breath within him, \"Who are you? Andwhence did you come hither?\" It answered and said, \"I have come from the force of the man forthe destruction of your work.\" When they heard, they glorified him, since he gave them respitefrom the fear and the anxiety in which they found themselves. Then they called that day \"Rest\", inas much as they had rested from toil. And when they saw that Adam could stand up, they wereglad, and they took him and put him in Paradise. And they withdrew up to their heavens. - 289 -"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"After the day of rest, Sophia sent her daughter Zoe, being called Eve, as an instructor, in order thatshe might make Adam, who had no soul, arise, so that those whom he should engender mightbecome containers of light. When Eve saw her male counterpart prostrate, she had pity upon him,and she said, \"Adam! Become alive! Arise upon the earth!\" Immediately her word becameaccomplished fact. For Adam, having arisen, suddenly opened his eyes. When he saw her, he said,\"You shall be called 'Mother of the Living'. For it is you who have given me life.\" Then the authorities were informed that their modelled form was alive and had arisen, and theywere greatly troubled. They sent seven archangels to see what had happened. They came toAdam. When they saw Eve talking to him, they said to one another, \"What sort of thing is thisluminous woman? For she resembles that likeness which appeared to us in the light. Now come,let us lay hold of her and cast her seed into her, so that when she becomes soiled she may not beable to ascend into her light. Rather, those whom she bears will be under our charge. But let us nottell Adam, for he is not one of us. Rather let us bring a deep sleep over him. And let us instructhim in his sleep to the effect that she came from his rib, in order that his wife may obey, and hemay be lord over her.\" Then Eve, being a force, laughed at their decision. She put mist into their eyes and secretly left herlikeness with Adam. She entered the tree of knowledge and remained there. And they pursuedher, and she revealed to them that she had gone into the tree and become a tree. Then, entering agreat state of fear, the blind creatures fled. Afterwards, when they had recovered from the daze, they came to Adam; and seeing the likenessof this woman with him, they were greatly disturbed, thinking it was she that was the true Eve.And they acted rashly; they came up to her and seized her and cast their seed upon her. They didso wickedly, defiling not only in natural ways but also in foul ways, defiling first the seal of hervoice - that had spoken with them, saying, \"What is it that exists before you?\" - intending to defilethose who might say at the consummation (of the age) that they had been born of the true manthrough verbal expression. And they erred, not knowing that it was their own body that they haddefiled: it was the likeness that the authorities and their angels defiled in every way. First she was pregnant with Abel, by the first ruler. And it was by the seven authorities and theirangels that she bore the other offspring. And all this came to pass according to the forethought ofthe prime parent, so that the first mother might bear within her every seed, being mixed and beingfitted to the fate of the universe and its configurations, and to Justice. A prearranged plan cameinto effect regarding Eve, so that the modelled forms of the authorities might become enclosures ofthe light, whereupon it would condemn them through their modelled forms. Now the first Adam, (Adam) of Light, is spirit-endowed and appeared on the first day. Thesecond Adam is soul-endowed and appeared on the sixth day, which is called Aphrodite. Thethird Adam is a creature of the earth, that is, the man of the law, and he appeared on the eighthday [...] the tranquility of poverty, which is called \"The Day of the Sun\" (Sunday). And theprogeny of the earthly Adam became numerous and was completed, and produced within itselfevery kind of scientific information of the soul-endowed Adam. But all were in ignorance. Next, let me say that once the rulers had seen him and the female creature who was with himerring ignorantly like beasts, they were very glad. When they learned that the immortal man wasnot going to neglect them, rather that they would even have to fear the female creature that hadturned into a tree, they were disturbed, and said, \"Perhaps this is the true man - this being whohas brought a fog upon us and has taught us that she who was soiled is like him - and so we shallbe conquered!\" Then the seven of them together laid plans. They came up to Adam and Eve timidly: they said tohim, \"The fruit of all the trees created for you in Paradise shall be eaten; but as for the tree ofknowledge, control yourselves and do not eat from it. If you eat, you will die.\" Having impartedgreat fear to them, they withdrew up to their authorities. Then came the wisest of all creatures, who was called Beast. And when he saw the likeness of theirmother Eve he said to her, \"What did God say to you? Was it 'Do not eat from the tree ofknowledge'?\" She said, \"He said not only, 'Do not eat from it', but, 'Do not touch it, lest you die.'\"- 290 -"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"He said to her, \"Do not be afraid. In death you shall not die. For he knows that when you eat fromit, your intellect will become sober and you will come to be like gods, recognizing the differencethat obtains between evil men and good ones. Indeed, it was in jealousy that he said this to you, sothat you would not eat from it.\" Now Eve had confidence in the words of the instructor. She gazed at the tree and saw that it wasbeautiful and appetizing, and liked it; she took some of its fruit and ate it; and she gave some alsoto her husband, and he too ate it. Then their intellect became open. For when they had eaten, thelight of knowledge had shone upon them. When they clothed themselves with shame, they knewthat they were naked of knowledge. When they became sober, they saw that they were naked andbecame enamored of one another. When they saw that the ones who had modelled them had theform of beasts, they loathed them: they were very aware. Then when the rulers knew that they had broken their commandments, they entered Paradise andcame to Adam and Eve with earthquake and great threatening, to see the effect of the aid. ThenAdam and Eve trembled greatly and hid under the trees in Paradise. Then the rulers did not knowwhere they were and said, \"Adam, where are you?\" He said, \"I am here, for through fear of you Ihid, being ashamed.\" And they said to him ignorantly, \"Who told you about the shame with whichyou clothed yourself? - unless you have eaten from that tree!\" He said, \"The woman whom yougave me - it is she that gave to me and I ate.\" Then they said to the latter, \"What is this that youhave done?\" She answered and said, \"It is the instructor who urged me on, and I ate.\" Then the rulers came up to the instructor. Their eyes became misty because of him, and they couldnot do anything to him. They cursed him, since they were powerless. Afterwards, they came up tothe woman and cursed her and her offspring. After the woman, they cursed Adam, and the landbecause of him, and the crops; and all things they had created, they cursed. They have no blessing.Good cannot result from evil. From that day, the authorities knew that truly there was something mightier than they: theyrecognized only that their commandments had not been kept. Great jealousy was brought into theworld solely because of the immortal man. Now when the rulers saw that their Adam had enteredinto an alien state of knowledge, they desired to test him, and they gathered together all thedomestic animals and the wild beasts of the earth and the birds of heaven and brought them toAdam to see what he would call them. When he saw them, he gave names to their creatures. They became troubled because Adam had recovered from all the trials. They assembled and laidplans, and they said, \"Behold Adam! He has come to be like one of us, so that he knows thedifference between the light and the darkness. Now perhaps he will be deceived, as in the case ofthe Tree of Knowledge, and also will come to the Tree of Life and eat from it, and becomeimmortal, and become lord, and despise us and disdain us and all our glory! Then he willdenounce us along with our universe. Come, let us expel him from Paradise, down to the landfrom which he was taken, so that henceforth he might not be able to recognize anything betterthan we can.\" And so they expelled Adam from Paradise, along with his wife. And this deed thatthey had done was not enough for them. Rather, they were afraid. They went in to the Tree of Lifeand surrounded it with great fearful things, fiery living creatures called \"Cheroubin\", and they puta flaming sword in their midst, fearfully twirling at all times, so that no earthly being might everenter that place. Thereupon, since the rulers were envious of Adam they wanted to diminish their (viz., Adam'sand Eve's) lifespans. They could not (, however,) because of fate, which had been fixed since thebeginning. For to each had been allotted a lifespan of 1,000 years, according to the course of theluminous bodies. But although the rulers could not do this, each of the evildoers took away tenyears. And all this lifespan (which remained) amounted to 930 years: and these are in pain andweakness and evil distraction. And so life has turned out to be, from that day until theconsummation of the age. Thus when Sophia Zoe saw that the rulers of the darkness had laid a curse upon her counterparts,she was indignant. And coming out of the first heaven with full power, she chased those rulers- 291 -"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"out of their heavens, and cast them down into the sinful world, so that there they should dwell, inthe form of evil spirits (demons) upon the earth. [...], so that in their world it might pass the thousand years in Paradise - a soul-endowed livingcreature called \"phoenix\". It kills itself and brings itself to life as a witness to the judgment againstthem, for they did wrong to Adam and his generation, unto the consummation of the age. Thereare [...] three men, and also his posterities, unto the consummation of the world: the spirit-endowed of eternity, and the soul-endowed, and the earthly. Likewise, the three phoenixes <in>Paradise - the first is immortal; the second lives 1,000 years; as for the third, it is written in theSacred Book that it is consumed. So, too, there are three baptisms - the first is the spiritual, thesecond is by fire, the third is by water. Just as the phoenix appears as a witness concerning theangels, so the case of the water hydri in Egypt, which has been a witness to those going down intothe baptism of a true man. The two bulls in Egypt possess a mystery, the sun and the moon, beinga witness to Sabaoth: namely, that over them Sophia received the universe; from the day that shemade the sun and the moon, she put a seal upon her heaven, unto eternity. And the worm that has been born out of the phoenix is a human being as well. It is written (Ps91:13 LXX) concerning it, \"the just man will blossom like a phoenix\". And the phoenix first appearsin a living state, and dies, and rises again, being a sign of what has become apparent at theconsummation of the age. It was only in Egypt that these great signs appeared - nowhere else - asan indication that it is like God's Paradise. Let us return to the aforementioned rulers, so that we may offer some explanation of them. Now,when the seven rulers were cast down from their heavens onto the earth, they made forthemselves angels, numerous, demonic, to serve them. And the latter instructed mankind in manykinds of error and magic and potions and worship of idols and spilling of blood and altars andtemples and sacrifices and libations to all the spirits of the earth, having their coworker fate, whocame into existence by the concord between the gods of injustice and justice. And thus when the world had come into being, it distractedly erred at all times. For all men uponearth worshiped the spirits (demons) from the creation to the consummation - both the angels ofrighteousness and the men of unrighteousness. Thus did the world come to exist in distraction, inignorance, and in a stupor. They all erred, until the appearance of the true man. Let this suffice so far as the matter goes. Now we shall proceed to consideration of our world, sothat we may accurately finish the description of its structure and management. Then it willbecome obvious how belief in the unseen realm, which has been apparent from creation down tothe consummation of the age, was discovered. I come, therefore, to the main points regarding the immortal man: I shall speak of all the beingsthat belong to him, explaining how they happen to be here. When a multitude of human beings had come into existence, through the parentage of the Adamwho had been fashioned, and out of matter, and when the world had already become full, therulers were master over it - that is, they kept it restrained by ignorance. For what reason? For thefollowing: since the immortal father knows that a deficiency of truth came into being amongst theeternal realms and their universe, when he wished to bring to naught the rulers of perditionthrough the creatures they had modelled, he sent your likenesses down into the world ofperdition, namely, the blessed little innocent spirits. They are not alien to knowledge. For allknowledge is vested in one angel who appeared before them; he is not without power in thecompany of the father. And <he> gave them knowledge. Whenever they appear in the world ofperdition, immediately and first of all they reveal the pattern of imperishability as a condemnationof the rulers and their forces. Thus when the blessed beings appeared in forms modelled byauthorities, they were envied. And out of envy the authorities mixed their seed with them, inhopes of polluting them. They could not. Then when the blessed beings appeared in luminousform, they appeared in various ways. And each one of them, starting out in his land, revealed his(kind of) knowledge to the visible church constituted of the modelled forms of perdition. It (viz.,the church) was found to contain all kinds of seed, because of the seed of the authorities that hadmixed with it. - 292 -"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Then the Savior created [...] of them all - and the spirits of these are manifestly superior, beingblessed and varying in election - and also (he created) many other beings, which have no king andare superior to everyone that was before them. Consequently, four races exist. There are three thatbelong to the kings of the eighth heaven. But the fourth race is kingless and perfect, being thehighest of all. For these shall enter the holy place of their father. And they will gain rest in reposeand eternal, unspeakable glory and unending joy. Moreover, they are kings within the mortaldomain, in that they are immortal. They will condemn the gods of chaos and their forces. Now the Word that is superior to all beings was sent for this purpose alone: that he mightproclaim the unknown. He said, \"There is nothing hidden that is not apparent, and what has notbeen recognized will be recognized.\" And these were sent to make known what is hidden, and theseven authorities of chaos and their impiety. And thus they were condemned to death. So when all the perfect appeared in the forms modelled by the rulers, and when they revealed theincomparable truth, they put to shame all the wisdom of the gods. And their fate was found to bea condemnation. And their force dried up. Their lordship was dissolved. Their forethoughtbecame emptiness, along with their glory. Before the consummation of the age, the whole place will shake with great thundering. Then therulers will be sad, [...] their death. The angels will mourn for their mankind, and the demons willweep over their seasons, and their mankind will wail and scream at their death. Then the age willbegin, and they will be disturbed. Their kings will be intoxicated with the fiery sword, and theywill wage war against one another, so that the earth is intoxicated with bloodshed. And the seaswill be disturbed by those wars. Then the sun will become dark, and the moon will cause its lightto cease. The stars of the sky will cancel their circuits. And a great clap of thunder will come out ofa great force that is above all the forces of chaos, where the firmament of the woman is situated.Having created the first product, she will put away the wise fire of intelligence and clothe herselfwith witless wrath. Then she will pursue the gods of chaos, whom she created along with theprime parent. She will cast them down into the abyss. They will be obliterated because of theirwickedness. For they will come to be like volcanoes and consume one another until they perish atthe hand of the prime parent. When he has destroyed them, he will turn against himself anddestroy himself until he ceases to exist. And their heavens will fall one upon the next and their forces will be consumed by fire. Theireternal realms, too, will be overturned. And his heaven will fall and break in two.

And the deficiency will beplucked out by the root (and thrown) down into the darkness. And the light will withdraw up toits root. And the glory of the unbegotten will appear. And it will fill all the eternal realm. When the prophecy and the account of those that are king becomes known and is fulfilled bythose who are called perfect, those who - in contrast - have not become perfect in the unbegottenfather will receive their glory in their realms and in the kingdoms of the immortals: but they willnever enter the kingless realm. For everyone must go to the place from which he has come.Indeed, by his acts and his knowledge, each person will make his (own) nature known. - 293 -"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"T h e G o s p e l A c c o r d i n g t oM a r y M a g d a l e n ePapyrus Berolinensis 8502Translation : ???Chapter 4(Pages 1 to 6 of the manuscript, containing chapters 1 - 3, are lost.

It contains Coptic editions of three very importantGnostic texts: the Apocryphon of John, the Sophia of Jesus Christ, and the Gospel of Mary. Despitethe importance of the find, several misfortunes (including two world wars) delayed its publicationuntil 1955. By then the Nag Hammadi collection had also been recovered, and two of the texts inthe PB 8502 codex -- the Apocryphon of John, and the Sophia of Jesus Christ -- were also foundincluded there. The PB 8502 versions of these two texts were used to augment translations of theApocryphon of John and the Sophia of Jesus Christ as they now appear in the Nag Hammadi Library. Importantly, the codex preserves the most complete surviving copy of the Gospel of Mary (as thetext is named in the manuscript, though it is clear this named Mary is the person we call Mary ofMagdala). Two other small fragments of the Gospel of Mary from separate Greek editions werelater also unearthed in archaelogical excavations at Oxyrhynchus in Northern Egypt. (Fragmentsof the Gospel of Thomas were also found at this ancient library site, see the Gospel of Thomaspage for more information about Oxyrhyncus.) Unfortunately, the extant manuscript of the Gospelof Mary is missing pages 1 to 6 and pages 11 to 14 -- pages that included sections of the text up tochapter 4, and portions of chapter 5 to 8. The complete extant text of the Gospel of Mary is presented below. For those interested in a printedition of the text, we highly recommend Karen King's new translation and commentary (listed tothe side). An introductory lecture on the The Gospel of Mary Magdalen is also available in ourThe Gnosis Archive Web Lectures collection. - 296 -"}]
