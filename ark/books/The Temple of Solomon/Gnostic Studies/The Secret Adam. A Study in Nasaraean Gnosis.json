INTRODUCTION ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS THE author would like to express gratitude to scholars who have helped her by various suggestions and corrections. Amongst these she names Professors H. Chadwick, E. R. Dodds, G. R. ‘Driver, P. Kahle, A. Momiglino, and R. C. Zaehner. The list of helpers does not end there for it includes critical mem- bers of her own family, one or two friends, and the kind assistance of Mr. J. Thornton in procuring necessary books. New evidence in Mandaean literature was, of course, the main reason for the helpful patience shown by those whom the author consulted whilst attempting to relate this hitherto unknown material to other gnostic literature, including the Khenoboskin trouwuille. Finally, she would like to thank the staff of the Clarendon Press for their watchful care in shepherding the book through the press. BY the rivers of ‘Iraq and especially in the alluvial land of Al- Khaur where the Tigris and Euphrates squander their waters in the marshes, meeting and mating at Qurnah before they flow into the Persian Gulf, and in the lowland of Persia along the Karun, which like its two sister rivers empties into the Gulf, there still dwells the remnant of a handsome people who call themselves Munduiiu, Mandaeans (‘gnostics’), and speak a dia- lect of Aramaic. When the armies of Islam vanquished the Sassanids they were already there and in such numbers that the Qur’Hngrantedthem protection as ‘people of a book’, calling them ‘Sabaeans’. To that name they still cling, both in its literary form and as the vernacular q-Subbu, for it ensures their existence as a tolerated community. The word (from SB’, Syriac ua ) means ‘submergers’ and refers to their baptism (mqhtu) and frequent self-immersion. In the ninth book of his Fihrist ul- ‘ulzim, Al-Nadim, who wrote in the tenth century, calls them ul-Mu&tasiluh, ‘the self-ablutionists’. I chose none of these names when writing of them in this book for, though this may appear paradoxical, those amongst the com- munity who possess secret knowledge are called Nqruiiu- Nqoraeans (or, if the heavy ‘s’ is written as ‘z’, Nazorenes). At the same time the ignorant or semi-ignorant laity are called ‘Mandaeans’, Mmduiia-‘gnostics’. When a man becomes a priest he leaves ‘Mandaeanism’ and enters tumidutu, ‘priest- hood‘. Even then he has not attained to true enlightenment, for this, called ‘Neirutha’, is reserved for a very few. Those pos- sessed of its secrets may call themselves Nasoraeans, and ‘Nqo- mean’ today indicates not only one who observes strictly all rules of ritual purity, but one who understands the secret doc- trine. When the head priests of the community learned some years ago that two of their number had permitted certain scrolls to J"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I INTRODUCTION pass into my possession they showed resentment and anger. These scrolls, they said, contained ‘secrets’, knowledge im- partedonly to priests at ordmationand never to laymen or to out- siders. Their attitude is understandable. When I was advanced enough in their language to read these documents, I found at intervals stern insistence on secrecy. Only ‘one in a thousand and in two thousand two’ would be found worthy of initiation into certain mysteries and any initiate who permitted them to become public was doomed to punishment in this world and the next. The scrolls were of two kinds. In such manuscripts as ‘A Thousand and Twelve Questions’ (AY Trisar suialia), the. ‘Diwan of Lofty Kingship’ (Diwan Malkuta ’hifa), the ‘Great First World’ and the ‘Lesser First World’ (Alma RiSaia Rba and Alma RiiaiaZuta), the teacher who hears and answers questions is an exalted spirit of light; these manuscripts are placed in the initiation hut when a novice is prepared for priesthood. The second type of ‘secret’ scroll, in which explanation of the mys- teries is more or less incidental, is the Sarh, a composition in- tended solely to instruct priests in the correct performance of ritual. The word means ‘explanation, commentary’. Instruction usually takes the form of a description of a rite celebrated by spirits in the divine ether-world as a pattern for future priests in an as yet uncreated earthly world. The proper celebration of various types of baptism, maripta, and Blessed Oblation are de- scribed in them. A third type of document provides scattered secret teaching, namely a codex containing the canonical prayers and canticles. As these codices are the personal property of priests and in constant use, it was many years before I could obtain a complete copy. Only as manuscript after manuscript is studied does a picture gradually form of an ancient theosophy true to the type we call gnostic, which developed in the syncretistic centuries which pre- ceded the fall of classical paganism. This theosophy was hybrid. It embraced the star-knowledge and wisdom of Babylon and Egypt, the dualism of Iranian sages and Plato, the high specula- INTRODUCTION xi tion of the Greeks, and the stem morality of Jewry and its book of books. Deeper roots may have reached yet farther east. If one may venture into hypothesis, seedbeds in which Neirutha could well have germinated were the flourishing Jew- ish colonies in commercial towns in Parthia, Media, and Baby- lonia. These were, of course, in constant touch, not only with one another, but with Jerusalem. I suggest that such a sect may have spread into the Jordan valley, Galilee, and Judaea, where it would naturally have split into sub-sects, one of them possibly Christianity, which recognized in Jesus its crownedand anointed king-the Messiah. It is a striking fact that in all the Mandaean texts the word &ha (Messiah, Christ) is only used with the qualification ‘lying’ or ‘false’ of Jesus, and this is the more sur- prising as every priest is a king (mauta), crowned and anointed, as microcosm of the macrocosm Adam Kasia, the crowned and anointed Anthropos, Arch-priest, and creator of the ccsmos made in his form. The word for the oil of unction is miyu and the verbs for its application are RSM and ADA. The implication is that the word &ha (the anointed one) was so inextricably connected with the hated Jew and Christian that the root MSH was banned from Nasoraean use. Having set foot on the slippery road of speculation, I assume that it might well follow that after the destruction of Jerusalem, when Jewish Christians for the most part settled in East Jordan, our Nqoraeans, hating, and hated by, both Jew and Jewish- Christian, would naturally seek harbour in the friendlier atmo- sphere of Parthia and the Median hills-exactly as the Hwan Gnoaita relates, and, according to that manuscript ,a number of them migrated later under Parthian protection into Babylonia and Khuzistan. Did they find in the well-watered marsh districts there a baptizing gnostic sect like-or affiliated to-their own? It might explain much, but here I can only refer the reader to Chapter X of this book. In the ‘secret scrolls’ Jesus and John are unmentioned. In the two codices accessible to the uninitiated (GR and DraSia-d-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"xii INTRODUCTION Yahia) the former is represented as a perverter of Nasoraean teaching. In contrast, when Jesus appears in the Coptic Christian gnostic manuscripts’ he is used as a mouthpiece of gnosis. There is no attempt to represent him as an historical figure, although by use of his name the Coptic gnosis is given a Christian aspect. Dr. Gilles Quispel wrote recently? ‘Da13 die Gnosis in Wesen und Ursprung nuht christlich ist wird immer klarer : oh sie aber vorchristlich ist, muD noch hewiesen werden.’ Nasoraean scrolls of the first type mentioned on p. x exist in the librariesof head priests and are seldom copied, so that there is often a gap of several generations between one copy and the next. To what date can they be ascribed? The genealogy of each composition is long: and in the colophons it is stated that such manuscripts when examined in the Moslem era were already ancient, fragmentary, and in places difficult to decipher. It is to be surmised that the arrival of proselytizing Islam into Meso- potamia and Persia startled Nasoraeans and Mandaeans3 in those countries out of sleepy complacency induced by the security they had enjoyed during the Seleucid, Parthian, and Sassanian epochs. Reformers, the liturgist Ramuia and his colleagues set about the task of collecting manuscripts, and, the colophons chronicle, travelledfromplace to place, from priest to priest, and from bimundu to bimanda‘ in search of them. The final result was a heterogeneous, but nevertheless canonical, literature. It should be remarked that the reformers showed little interest in setting theology to rights although the religion by the eighth and ninth I e.g. in the Codex Askewianus and Codex Bmcianus translated hy Carl Schmidt, Koptirch-Gnartirche Schriften (Leipzig, 1905). and in the Evongelium Vm’catir, the first of the Khenohoskion papyri to he published. Judging by accounts given of the latter by M. Jean Doresse in Livres secrets des gnorriquer d’&ypte (Plon, 1958), what I have said above would hold good for the re- mainder of these texts.

INTRODUCTION xiii centuries had become overgrown like a barnacled ship with a variety of contradictory tenets, additions, and legends. Reform- ing zeal was reserved for and concentrated upon the correct per- formance of ritual, the meticulous observance of ritual purity, and uniformity in the celebration of baptism and the sacraments. There followed an era of strict observance for priesthood and laity. Exact directions about the way in which the rites of the Neoraean church were to he performed were inserted in the canonical prayer book and a certain amount of literary actirity ensued in the shape of fur& and such books as the Harun Gawa’tu, the Diwun Abutur, and other later compositions. A considerable part of the surviving literature may he dated back to the earliest phases of Nasoraeanism. Most scholars now accept Professor Save-Soderbergh’s discovery that the Coptic- Manichaean ‘Psalms of Thomas’ are adaptations, almost translations, of early Mandaic hymns,’ not, as was hitherto sup- posed, vice versa. Al-Nadim’s storyz that Fatik, Mini’s father, belonged to the Mughtasilah sect is thereby strengthened, for there can be no doubt that this baptizing sect were Sibians, that is to say Mandaeans and Nasoraeans. Fresh presumptive evidence about the history of the sect came to light when I discovered and the Vatican Press published the Harm Guwuitu just mentioned. It purported to be ‘historical’ andlrecounted in semi-legendary form how the Nasoraeans fled from persecution in Jerusalem and sought refuge in the Median hills (Turu &Madai) and in Hurun Guwuitu, which I take to mean the city of Harran. Their persecutors were punished by the destruction of Jerusalem, which would place the flight before A.D. 70. In ‘Ham’ they found co-religionists and even- tually migrated under a friendly Parthian king, Ardhan (Arta- banus), to Lower Mesopotamia where they established head- quarters at a place called Fb between Whit and Khuzistan.

Most of the re-edited manuscripts were, according to the colophons, issued from Tib. Dr. Rudolf Macuch’ points out that the sentence referring to Harran could be read ‘in which there me Nasoraeans’, showing that, at the time at which the writer lived and wrote, Nasoraeans, under that name, were still found in that city. Throughout the manuscript the word ’Nasoraeans’ is used, not ‘Sibiya’ (Sabians), and ‘Mandaeans’ are mentioned only once. The point raised here is discussed in the Appendix. That Nqoraeans were originally a Jewish group or partly Jewish group is suggested by their claim that John the Baptist was a member of their sect, and by the fact that the Jordanz is an essential and central feature of their tradition. Today the word yurdna (jordan) is applied not only to running water used in baptism and immersion, but to any flowing stream; yet the conjunction of John the Baptist and the Jordan is significant. Epiphanius (Adwersus Hnereses, mix: 6) says that there were ‘Nqoraeans’ (Nauapaiob) amongst the Jews before the time of Christ.3 The name could have been applied to any strictly law-observing Jewish sect, for the root 7U means ‘to keep, ob- serve, guard’ and could have been used as a laudatory term for more than one group of Jewish dissidents, particularly if they had secret teachings.’ Nqoraeans of the Mandaean type ‘keep and observe’ ritual law with zealous fidelity and ‘keep back‘- even from their own laity-mysteries considered deep and easily misunderstood by the uninitiated. NaSoraean hatred for Jews must have originated at a period ’ R. Macuch, ‘Alter U. Heimat des Mandlismus nach neuerschlossenen Quellen’, Theologische Liternturaeitung (June, I 957). a The Jordan, in contrast to other rivers in Syria and Palestine, is never really cold, hence is peculiarly adapted for immersion at all times of the year. Lidzhamki (ML, p. xvii) makes short work of W. B. Smith‘s arguments in Der vorchr*tltiheJenu (Giessen, ,906) that Epiphanius was mistaken in this statement. ‘ Cf. Isaiah xlviii. 6 and Ixv. 4. nil% ‘secret things’ and O’llg rseCret place*’. XV INTRODUCTION at which Nasoraeans were in close contact with orthodox jewry and at a time when the orthodox Jews had some authority over them. All this points to the truth of the Haran Guwffllatradition. Heterodox Judaism in Galilee and Samaria appears to have taken shape in the form we now call gnostic, and it may well have existed some time before the Christian era. In the Schweich Lectures’ given by Dr. Moses Gaster in 1923 on the Samaritans, the lecturer, speaking of settlements of Jews and Samaritans in the Diaspora, mentioned similarities which exist between Parseeism, Judaism, and Samaritanism, and pointed out the possibility that Mandaeism might also have sprouted in such seedbeds. The figure of Pthahil and its connexion as demiurge with the Egyptian god Ptah (see p. 37, n. z), the Mandaean tradition that they once had fellow religionists in Egypt: and the apparently ancientbelieftransmitted by word of mouth that the dove slangh- tered before the m@a is called a ba’ (unsatisfactory though these may be as evidence, for I can find little to justify them in the texts) must be considered contributory when assessing the possibility that Nqirutha originated in semi-paganized Jewish circles. In this book I have tried to view Nasoraean gnosis as a whole, and have not concealed my belief that the secret teaching, based upon the Mystic Adam, goes back to the first or second cen- turies. Vitally significant aspects of that gnosis are evident in un- published scrolls held as a closely-guarded heritage by the inner circle, the Neoraeans. These a layman, however pious, is not allowed to see or hear. They contain tenets imparted only to an initiated few; indeed, NaSirutha could be called truly esoteric- a religion within a religion, a gnosis within a gnosis, and its heart is the interpretation which it attaches to sacramental acts. ’ M.

I."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"xvi INTRODUCTI0,N To tabulate the principal features of the gnosis : NaSirutha has preserved for us, as I shall try to convey in the following pages, a complete and coherent gnostic system. Its main features ap- pear in various forms in other gnostic sects and they may be roughly summarized as these: I. A supreme formless Entity, the expression of which in time and space is creation of spiritual, etheric, and material worlds and beings. Production of these is delegated by It to a creator or creators who originated in It. The cosmos is created by Archetypal Man, who produces it in similitude to his own shape. 2. Dualism: a cosmic Father and Mother, Light and Dark- ness, Right and Left, syzygy in cosmic and microcosmic form. 3. Asafeatureofthisdualism, counter-types, a world of ideas. 4. The soul is portrayed as an exile, a captive; her home and origin being the supreme Entity to which she eventually returns. 5. Planets and stars influence fate and human beings, and are also places of detention after death. 6. A saviour spirit or saviour spirits which assist the soul on her journey through life and after it to ‘worlds of light’. 7. A cult-language of symbol and metaphor. Ideas and quali- ties are personified. 8. ‘Mysteries’, i.e. sacraments to aid and purify the soul, to ensure her rebirth into a spiritual body, and her ascent from the world of matter. These are often adaptations of existing seasonal and traditional rites to which an esoteric interpretation is attached. In the case of the NaSoraeans this interpretation is based on the Creation story (see I and z), especially on the Divine Man, Adam, as crowned and anointed King-priest. 9. Great secrecy is enjoined upon initiates; full explanation of I, 2, and 8 being reserved for those considered able to understand and preserve the gnosis. Other features and developments occur in various syncretic and gnostic systems, but the above are, upon the whole, the dis- tinguishing features of Nqoraean gnosis, NaSirutha. INTRODUCTION rvii I have not confined my quotations to the secret scrolls alone, for the Ginzu (also called ‘The Book of Adam’, see ‘Sources’) and the liturgical prayers and canticles’ are full of allusions to gnosis. One of the scrolls quoted,% a miscellany containing seven fragmentary books (at the time of writing it was still in page proof), will I feel certain beregarded as one of the most important Mandaean documents preserved for us in the priestly libraries. The style in which it and other manuscripts quoted are com- posedis obscure, perhaps intentionally so. The writers seem poor literary craftsmen: they dilate upon matters repellent to the Wes- tern mind, such as the organs and functions of the Body of the Secret Adam. To a NaSoraean the human body is a replica of the glorious cosmic Body, the holiest of mysteries, and every organ in it, including those necessary to digestion, reproduaion, and evacuation, has for him deep symbolical significance and is revered as an expression of the Divine chemistry of genesis, purification, and catharsis. Madiiiche Liturgien (see ‘Sources’) contains about a third of the canonical book. A full and complete edition of the latter is now published under the title of The Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandoems (E. J. Brill, Leiden). a Alj Trisar suiafin (‘A Thousand and Twelve Questions’) ; see ‘Sources’."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I IN THE BEGINNING There was not the non-Existent nor the Existent then; There was not the air nor the heaven which wm beyond.

Often, indeed, his puppets develop in ways hardly intended, but the main plot is unaffected and the dramatist remains the supreme authority. Such, on a cosmic scale, is the Nasoraean concept of Existence emerging from non-Existence in the beginning. The NaSoraean ‘Author of Being’, to use a Western phrase, isExistenceinexceL. It is absolutely without sex or human attribute and in speaking of It the pronoun ‘They’ is used, for Hiiu, ‘Life’, is an abstract plural. Creation is delegated to emanations, and appeals are ad- dressed to It by the two great creative forces which are the first manifestation of Itself, namely Mind-the instrument of evoca- tion-and a personification of active Light, Ziwa or Yawar-Ziwa (Awaking, or Dazzling, Radiance). When Yawar is about to call into existence the ‘ether-world’ and spirits to inhabit it, he approaches the Author-Spectator as a suppliant, humbly: ‘If it please You, Great Life; if it please You, Mighty Lifel’ seeking permission to begin his predestined task. We find the ideas which Nasoraean writers try to convey to US expressed in often contradictory terms. The picture changes, merges, melts before us as they envisage at an ever-fresh angle the Parpfa Rba, the ‘Great Immanence’ or ‘Great Counten- ance’an epithet applied to the Great Life.

The Great Life is described as nukraiia, literally ‘alien’, meaning ‘remote, in- comprehensible, ineffable’. The word used for ‘Mind‘, mana,‘ is not in that sense Semitic but Iranian, suggesting that the word was first adopted under Iranian influence. A NaSoraean hymn praises Yawar-Ziwa, the first Radiance which illumined the stage of existence, and the Mind which produced it: I worship, praise and laud The four hundred and forty-four names Of Yawar-Ziwa son of ‘Radiance-Appeared’,z King of ’uthras: great Viceregent of shecinahs,‘ Chief over mighty and celestial worlds Of radiance, light and glory. (He) who is within the Veil, Within his own shecinah, He, before whom no being existed. Then I worship, laud and praise The one great Name which is great, The Name which is powerful. Then I worship, laud and praise The word mana when meaning ‘mind’, ‘thought’, &c., is of non-Semitic derivation: the Aramaic mnna is ‘a garment’, ‘robe’, ‘vehicle’, ‘vessel’, ‘instrument’. There is often word-play on the two meanings, and this passed into other gnostic literature so that ‘robe’ or ‘vessel’ or ‘vehicle’ is used as a cryptogram for mono meaning ‘mind’ or ‘soul’. For the Zend and Pehlevi meaning of maw see Nyherg, Die Religionnz der Altm Iran (Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatisch-AWptischen Gesellschaft, Leipdg, 1938), p. 128. In general, Mona in a cosmic sense is equivalent to the Stoic, Valentinian, and Sethian NoB, ‘the emanation of the Forefather npondrwp’. Reitzenstein pointed out that the Valentinians translated the word mono as ‘vessel’ (its Aramaic meaning, possibly from a Mandaic source) when they made the dying soul exclaim: ‘I am a precious vessel.‘ The double meaning, Aramaic and Iranian, appears to be used BS a cryptogram in the gnostic ‘Song of the Soul’ (Acts of Thomas) when the Parthian prince meets his ‘robe’. It is significant that Parthia is the home of the princely hero. Parthia is mentioned by Hippolytus and Irenaeus as the original centre of the Elkasaite heresy (see Chapter X). ’ Nbay-Ziwa, lit. ‘Radiance burst forth’.

The Mandaean cult-hut is called a Ikixta or 6imanda (= biz mnndn). IN THE BEGINNING 3 That mystic First Mind [Mam] The glory of Which was transmitted Neither from the uttermost ends of the earth Nor from gates within it. For It is Mind, the Great, Mysterious, First, The glory of which was communicated By redoublings of radiance And by intensification of light. (CP 374.) The G~~zQ (GRr) describes creation as ‘utterance’, or ‘a cry’, ‘a calling forth’. ‘Through Thy Word‘ (mimm) says GRr 12, addressing the King of Light, ‘everything came into being’. The first two pages of this book describe Supreme Life, the Great Life, in mainly negative terms. The ‘great Pa&? has ‘no associate to share Its Crown nor partner in Its rule’; It is ‘light without darkness’, ‘the Life above the living’, ‘Glory above glories’, ‘Life without death’, and so on. Such descrip- tions could be understood even by the uninitiated, but gnostic metaphor, the ‘mystery idiom’, appears from time to time in GR. This is the Mystery and book of the Radiance which burneth in the pihta‘ which is effulgent in Its own radiance and great in Its light. (GRr 238.) Pihfa here does not mean as usual ‘sacramental bread‘, but ‘the opened‘, ‘the revealed’, used in the idiom of such mystery- hymns as 358-9 (CP) which begin, ‘When He opened His Garment’, referring to the first emanation and the act of crea- tion; and in the word Zbusa, ‘garment’, ‘covering’, ‘cloak’, we have a typical example of word-play on manu (see p. 2, n. I), so that ‘when He opened his 2bu.W really means ‘revealed His The mots PHT, PTH, and PTA mean ‘to open’, ‘to break apart’, and all are used sometimes to describe creative activity. PTA also means ‘to originate’. Lidnharski used the word schuf to translate pta. Pihta (lit. ‘opened‘) is the ritual name of the loaf used at all sacred rites. It may mean ‘something broken apart or into pieces’ (see E. S. Drower, ‘The Sacramental Bread (Pihtha) of the Mandaeans’, ZDMG, Bd. 105, Heft I, 1955, p. XIS, and d. Aramaic kW3). Bread is a symbol of life: the Arabic ‘life’ also means ‘bread‘ and ‘wheat’."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"4 IN THE BEGINNING Mind‘ or ‘Thought’. In the first hymn the mmua is mentioned directly afterwards: For the First Mmd (nonu) began (pta) and dwelt therein. Some words in the mystery-idiom are impossible to translate adequately, such as tuna (Tanna?). Judging by the context in some passages it would seem to mean a matrix, a formative centre.’ In the same hymn we hear of a turn and it is mentioned in one of the baptismal hymns: The Radiance glowed in great effulgence. The Tonna dissolved and a fkinto came into existence And was established in the House of Life. In GRr 238: 6 the Tuma is mentioned in a description of the creation of first things: . . . and radiance issued from theeta; light resred on thepihta and proceeded from it. It created an emanation for itself, the radiance and light which issued from itself. Radiance glowed, the light glowed; the Tanna heated, the Tanna dissolved. The first prayer in the baptismal liturgy, the Book of Souls, begins thus: In the name of the Life and in the name of Knowledge of Life and in the name of the Primal Being who was Eldest and preceded Water, Radiance, Light and Glory; the Being who cried with His voice and [utteredl Words. Vies grew and came into being and the First Life was established in its Skintu. . . . The First Life is prior to the Second Life by six thousand myriad years, the second Life is prior to the Third Life by six thousand myriad years and the Third Life more ancient than any ’uthra [spirit] by six thousand myriad years. There is that which is infinite. At that time there was no solid earth and no inhabitant in the black waters. From them, from those black waters, Evil was formed and emerged. Genesis i too includes ‘waters’ in the first act of creation. The . Neoraean concept seems to be that the ‘black waters’ either existed already as a form of chaos, or accompanied the mani- It is sometimes personified. IN THE BEGINNING 5 festation of the Ineffable. Evil is depicted as the inevitable con- comitant of matter: it appears as it were of itself as the result of the dualism which is the first expression of Unity in plurality. This inevitability appears again and again in the secret teaching: For darkness and light are bound together: had there been no dark then light would not have come into being. (AT$ p. 134.) The worlds of darkness and the worlds of light are Body [($urn]’ and counterpart: they (complement) one another. Neither can re- move from or approach the other, nor can either be separated from its partner. Moreover, each deriveth strength from the other. (ibid., P. 213.) Other passages in the same scroll confirm the inevitability, the dependence of one upon the existence of the other: 0 Vision of ’uthras, 0 Word from whose Mind all kings emanated! Behold! Light and Darkness are brothers; they proceeded from one Mystery and the Body [‘$una] retaineth both. And for each sign in the’body [pagra]’ that pertaineth to Light there is a corresponding mark of Darkness.

The implication that ziwa (radiance is an approximate trans- lation), the syzygy of nhura, is an active, creative male principle and light a receptive, passive (female) principle occurs more than once: in AT3 Hibil-Ziwa says: Now as to these two mysteries of ziwa and nhura, know that they are the ancient Primal Father and Mother. Pure gold is the mystery [symbol] of the Father, its name is Radiance. Silver is the Mother’s mystery [symbol] and its name is Light. The Crown is the Father’s symbol and its name is Radiance: the myrtle-wreath the symbol of the Mother and itsname is ‘Let there be Light’. The ‘owner of a crown’ [a priest] is concerned with the mystery of the Father. A Mandaean [i.e. layman] and his wife are occupied with the mystery of the Mother. The mutual interdependence and yet opposition in partner- ship is constantly expounded. The Teacher says (ibid., p. 145): Behold and Ieam that betwixt darkness and light there can be no union or pact: on the contrary, hatred, enmity and dissension, al- though We are aware of all that taketh place and seeketh to take place. For darkness is the adversary of light. They are Right and Left, they are ruha [vital spirit] and nilimfa [soul] ; moreover, they are called Adam and Eve. Radiance, active light, was the first emanation. Its amplified name Yawar-Ziwa means ‘dazzling’ or ‘awaking’* Light. The opening lines of a series of hymns (CP 358-69) are: When He opened His Garment and when Radiance was formed ’ Qin; seep. 57. n.

He was created Chief of mighty ones: He implanted reproductive power in his brethren. Dualism is expressed in many ways and metaphors. The perpetual opposition and interdependence of two forces, like the negative and positive in electricity, combine to produce energy. Complementary pairs unite for the purpose: there are, in particular, the two who seem to symbolize the first ‘sacred marriage’ (and the pattern is repeated throughout the cosmos). They are the Ainu usindirka, the Wellspring and Date-palm. By modern Mandaeans the wordsindirka is traditionally accepted as meaning both ‘date-palm’ (a male date-palm) and ‘dates’, and the szhdirka which ritual texts order to be placed with other symbolic fruits on the altar table and eaten, to be crushed with grapes for the marriage drink, or pounded with sesame for the oil of unction at the mmqta, can be no other fruit. Lidzbarski (ML, p. 28) translates the word as ‘Palme’ but says on p. xxi, ‘Als Palme laBt sich X31’71’0 nicht erklken’, and after discussion of probabilities he concludes that the tree of Life may have been originally a juniper, and that the word sindirka must have come from the Persian for sandarach (‘Im Persischen heiDt ’” ’’*’ das Harz des Wacholders’).

In Baby- lonia it served for a long time as a sacred emblem.’ In Ephesus as symbol of fertility it figured in the temple of Artemis the many-breasted. The male date-palm with its fertilizing pollen, its upward-soaring shaft, naturally suggested a phallic symbol, and in the secret texts it is so explained in plain language. In the MiddleEast generally itwas associatedwith nutrition and fertility. The ancient Egyptians knew it in this sense; for them it also symbolized the immortality of the soul and, like the part of the soul which was represented as a bird, it was called a bai or ba.3 To add to the maze of trails-true or false4-in the courtyard of every Parsi fire-temple there must grow a date-palm and near it must be a well of flowing water, so that here we have in modern times wellspring and palm-tree side by side in a holy place. The well is a symbol of the Life from which all emanates and to which all must return (see WW, p. ZZI), and a strip of date-palm leaf is used by the Parsi aoti to bind the symbolic bundle of twigs which might be described, in the ancient Jewish phrase, as ‘a bundle of life’. This parallel seems too close to be fortuitous. It suggests contact between people using such similes at one time or another and also syncretic ramifications far wider than hitherto assumed.

Spandarmat is Mother Earth and she is also the ‘Primal Whore’. The ‘Mother’ of Nqoraean gnosticism is more than these, for in her highest aspect she is the divine Mother, complement of the Father. In her celestial character she has several aspects and several names: she is the ‘Wellspring’ (Ah), Mother of Life; she is Simat-Hiia, ‘Treasure of Life’, spouse of the great principle of divine enlightenment; she is ’zlat, archetype of pure Bride and she appears too as Nasirutha, the true Nasoraean faith.

When a man becomes a priest he must divest himself of the Mother and ‘put on the Father’, in other words, must put off that which is earthly and identify himself with that which is spiritual. In one aspect she resembles the Indian Kali: she produces and nourishes her children but she also devours them: Behold, everything is founded in the Earth and issueth from her and is kept in her and there is nought which leaveth her save soul and spirit which the Jordan bringeth out from her and delivereth them from her snares and bonds.

She raised up physical life and she is the Great Mother from Whom all swarming creatures, burgeonings and increase proceeded and by Whom they are maintained. (AT‘S, pp. 238-9). The Mother is ‘the Left’, the Father ‘the Right’: the Mother, Earth, the Father, Sky; the Mother, Matter; the Father, Non- matter; the Mother, ruha (vital spirit), and the Father, nifimta (soul).

In CP, Prayer 233, Yawar-Ziwa,’ who in the poem is called ‘the proven, pure One’, reports its creation which was necessary before the creation of the ’uthras’ who would inhabit the ‘ether-world’: In it Radiance [zima] will form itself And sublime Light [nhura] be set up therein. In it there will be ’uthras’ And Rays-of-Light will be,established therein Appearances that shine with lovely radiance. In the ritual manuscripts describingthecelebration of heavenly mysteries, Ayar (or Ayar-Ziwa or Ayar-Rba) is given the role of chief celebrant, corresponding to that of a ganzibra3 or head priest on earth. Ayar is the personification of a divine and absolutely pure atmosphere, the very essence of Life drawn into the light-body by something akin to breathing. The soul brings it with her into the world. We hear also of ayar baraia, ‘the outer ether’, and ayar gawaia, ‘the inner ether’, the latter probably meaning the breath or pure air of Life within the soul. We send them [ie. human beings] pure ether that will build up their fabric and sweeten their stink. [But] they are ungrateful to the Life and complain that it is [too] cold and strong. And We send them living waters, bright and invigorating, that they may live and be raised up by them. [But] they go not down into them [in baptism], nor do they receive the Pure Sign. (Am, lines ZZI f.) In ATS, p. 173, we find: The outer Ether is held above the skies and exists below the earth.

He is also a teacher: in the ARR he not only acts as chief celebrant in celestial rites but explains their purpose and secret meaning. The soul for whom these ‘pattern rites’ are performed is that of Adam-Shaq-Ziwa, i,e. Adam Qadmaia, the Primal Adam who is the archetype of the yet unborn humanity. A passage illustrating this is quoted in a later chapter. In the Diwan Malkuta ’laita (lines 165-76), in a passage describing the ‘pattern’ initiation of a priest, candidates for the crown of priesthood are questioned by the examining board of spirit- priests: ‘Tell us about the mystery of the ruha [spirit] and the mystery of the nijimfa [soul]. Tell us who is thy Father and who thy Mother!’ And they [the nooices] reply ‘My Father, our Father, is Ether and our Mother is the Jordan.” When (see CP. Hymn 239) Yawar-Ziwa with a mandate from the Great Life had called into being the ‘ether-world’, the other sacred element was still uncreated. ‘In the Ether there is no water: how can the ’uthras thrive?’ he asks.

The Jewish Sefer Yefir& purports to be a Book of Creation. Professor Scholem’ thinks it may have been composed between the third and sixth centuries. He writes: ... the elements of the world . . . are sought in the ten elementary and primordial numbers-Sefiroth, as the book calls them-and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. These together represent the myster- ious forces whose convergence has produced the various combinations observable throughout the whole of creation; they are the ‘thirty-two secret paths of wisdom’ through which God has created all that exists. Such a concept appears repeatedly in the secret Mandaean texts when they describe the process of forming the universe into anthropomorphic shape. It is the kind of allegory which would appeal to priestly scribes and rabbis and its origin may be sought in schools of thought influenced by Pythagoras. In all gnostic writings the ‘Word’ (logos) is full of creative power, for the act of pronunciation was the act of creation. The Word ‘existed with God’ says St. John the Evangelist, and ‘was God’. In Mandaic it is the mimra or malulta, the spoken Word. As ‘Mahzian-the-Word’ it is sometimes personified as a messenger who brings divine decisions to the ’uthras. To pronounce or write a name in magic is to summon its owner. The Idea is the first stage of conception: speaking aloud (i.e. the ‘word‘) is the next, and it gives the idea shape and existence. The written word, therefore, has magical, mystical, and holy power and the belief that it has reflects the awe in which the unlettered hold the lettered. And each letter in a word has, in itself, dynamicvirtue, both numerical and magicaLz This may account for the presence in some gnostic writings of seemingly nonsensical names. Mandaeans wear letters as charms and I was told that some of them place the alphabet under their Pillows at night as a protection against evil.

The Aleph is represented by a circle, symbol of perfection, or of Life unending, and of the sun-disk as light on earth. With this symbol of divine perfedon (the ‘Alpha and Omega’) the alphabet begins and ends, so that in itself the alphabet symbolizes the return of all things to their Source. Hence, when creation is described in the secret books, the symbolism of the alphabet is utilized, and no doubt the mystics who teased hidden allusions out of such passages spent many an hour in meditation and in discussion about them. In a hymn in AT$ (which seems to be a variation of the sal sulta, see p. II), the alphabet is included in a paean about creation.

The word ’!.tun or ’?.tuna in Mandaic (\\&+r Syriac) means ‘the trunk’ (of a human body), or ‘a column, support’. When used of a cosmic being the word means the former, not the latter.’ The Body (and for the sake of clarity I will give it a capital ‘B’ to distinguish it from ‘body’ which in Mandaic is usually pagru or ’!.tun pugria) is that of Adam Qadmaia,z the ‘First I See p. 4, n.

By it, souls ascended to the world of light (as in the Mandaean maripto). Widengren points out (op. cit., p. 14) that this ‘column’ is always associated with the ‘Perfect Man’ (i.e. the First Adam). Dr. Boyce writes to me that “#un is an Indo-Iranian ward: Sanskrit rthupz, Avestan stem, Manichaem Middle Persian ishrn and Persian settin. The Syriac is SM’ (all of which undoubtedly mean ‘pillar, column’). In the case of Adam, whose body stands erect, the ’:tun (as in other Mandaic texts) has the meaning of ‘body’, i.e. without the head and limbs, hody in s literal sense of trunk. In Manichaem- ism the Milky Way was called the ‘Pillar’ of Glory (Parthian b’m ‘stwit), a conception which could well have heen derived from the Light-Body of the cosmic Adam. According to Dr. Boyce ‘the Last Man”s body was composed of the last partides of light to he saved from earth at the end of the world. The Manichean doctrine is evidently P development of the Naparaean concept of the cosmic Man. ‘According to the Jewish mystics God first created the Heavenly Man, the Archetype, who filled the universe and served 8s the pattern on which it wasmade’(H. Schonfield, ed., The AuthenticNm Tertament (Dohson, 1956). P. 309, n. 59.) He is the Adam Kadmon of Lurianic Kahhalism: ‘Adam Kadmon is nothing hut a first confiwration of the divine light which flows from the essence of En-Sof into the primeval space’ (G. Scholem.

In like manner, according to the secret doctrine, as we shall see in a later chapter, it is through and because of Adam Kasia that a disembodied soul obtains its spiritual body. The detailed description of the construction of Adam Kasia’s Body is understood when the ritual manuscripts are read, for every act in the mmqta is represented as part of the process by which the new and spiritual body is built up for the departed soul from plasma to perfection within the cosmic Womb. As Primordial Man he is agnostic figure rather than a purely Jewish or Iranian concept.‘ Explanations about Adam and his (the cosmic) Body are secret: For this mystery, this explanation, is a Voice which explaineth voices, a Word which interpreteth all words: it is [lie] a good man who teacheth and addresseth each individually. It is the cry that was called at dawn and the last cry uttered at night. For with it emerged perception: it made a pranouncement which confounded all other pronouncements.

The Greater BundahiSn, quoted on p. 318 of the ~ame book, describes the gradual building up of the wsmic being in terms which are remarkably close to those used in the Nasoraean secret scrolls of the development of the embryonic Adam in the womb of the cosmic Mother. If the cosmos was built in the form of Primordial Man. the converse follows: man, the microcosm, is built up in form of the wsmos. This belief was Hermetic also. ‘Hem& se reprksente I’homme wmme un microcwme, tout ee que contient le macro- wsme l’homme le wntenant aussi. . . .

Then he said ‘I am the Adam of the mighty Life. I am Adam [son] of the Mighty Life for I shine in praise of my Father. Know that when Adam was united with Hawa pve], Adam was the Soul and Eve Body, and she is the Earth and Adam the Sky. Behold, a name was assigned to them when they inaugurated the mysteries of kings and put on the Body and bore children and propagated generations.’ (ibid., p. 173.) The physical man, Adampugriu, came into being through the union of the cosmic pair. When they beheld children by divining [or terting] mysteries, Adam and &ti1 [Seth] came into being, and yonder they called Seth ‘the mysteries of the soul’ and they called Adam ‘the body’, because in that Place Adam was the blood and Seth was the soul. And in an- other sense, Adam was darkness of the eyes and Seth was vision, and Adam was Earth whilst in all the mysteries Seth is the Jordan, for all of them are connected with the Jordan. (ibid., p. 173.) The first creative impulse, when the Great Life became active and Non-Existence became Existence: assumed an anthropo- morphic shape. The explanation of this is given by Nasirutha in theological rather than metaphysical language. In the name of the great powerful Mum [Mind] Who thought and evoked companionship for Itself And said ‘There shall be companionship for Me.’ (CP 375.) The ARR (line 24, rt. side) relates in haggadic form the calling forth of the First Adam from the Wellspring-the Womb of Creation. The task is deputed to the cosmic Light, Yawar- Ziwa, who speaks first of his own emergence from the two great generative forces, the Male and Female: ’ G. Quispel has exactly expressed the Na~oraean concept of Adam in The Jvng Coda md its Significance (Mowhrays, London. 1955), p. 77: ‘That Adam is the All is clear from a passage in Ydkuth Shimoni on Genesis, para. 34: “He cast a soul into him and set him up comprising in him the universe.”’ a ‘Nothing was when He (or It) was not and nothing would be were He not to be’ (GRr 5)."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"24 ADAM KASIA, THE SECRET OR HIDDEN ADAM Then was I formed from the Wellspring and Palmtree [Date-palm], I, the King who is All-Light.

Then he arose and sat by a well of vain imaginings and said ‘I am a king without a peer!

Then he prostrated himself, cast himself down on his face and said ‘Is there a loftier and mightier than I? This is a Stream of living waters, white waters which come from worlds with- out limit or munt!’ Then his mind became disquieted. He pondered and said ‘I said that there was no ldng greater than I, put] now I know that there exists That which is greater than myself.

Vaunts recalling Isa. xlv. gd and xlvi. 9 occur no less than five timer, in the Coptic Kbenoboskion papyri: they are uttered by a demiurge or other created cosmic being (pp. 172. 182, 184, and zzz of Professor Doresse’s summarized version of these manuscripts)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"26 ADAM KASIA, THE SECRET OR HIDDEN ADAM Then a Voice came from above at which he fell upon his face and was powerless to rise and [stayed] fallen on his face until Ayar- Dakia [Pure-Ether] came-and in his right hand he was carrying a Letter.’ Then he [Adam] took the Letter into his right hand, smelt at it, sneezed,’ prayed and praised the King Who is all Light and said ‘I beseech Thee for lofty strength like Thine own.’ Then a Voice came to him from above and it sent Mahzian-the- Word. In his hand he was carrying a Letter. And he came towards him and gave the Letter into his [Adam’s] right hand and he [Adam] kissed it three hundred and sixty times, then opened it, but under- stood not what was in it. He rejoiced in his mind and prostrated him- self before Mahzian-the-Word and thereafter arose and understood the ABG and comprehended all Nqirutha little by little. This allegory shows Primal Man, His pride in Himself shorn away by the sight of Water of Life, learning from Mahzian-the- Word (here this might foreshadow written revelation) the rites which in the future physical World, He, and human celebrants in future ages mirroring himself, must perform. The First Adam is a vast shapes embracing all that is to exist in the future cosmos. As the First Priest he is identified in one fragment of the ATS with Mara-d-bbutha, and he sets on him- self the crown of priesthood, which is the crown of intermedia- tion between the worlds of light and those of matter, himself. The ecclesiastical test for literacy and knowledge of the holy books is pre-figured; he ‘enunciated the alphabet and recited the Book of Souls’.‘ ’ That is, as archetipe of a dying person about to enter the higher life, he receives the sacrament of the ‘Letter’. * In Semitic folklore, revival from death, deep sleep, or a swoon is accom- panied by a sneeze. See below, p. 35. ’ The vast dimensions of cosmic Adam appear, not only in gnostic texts, hut also in Rabbinic literature. The Adam of the Naaseni (Hippolytus, Refutation of all Heresies, bk. v, ii, A-N Libnuy, vol. i, p. 130) was ‘like that of the Cbaldaeans’, a ‘huge image of Him who is above’. Irenaeus, describing the Ophite doctrine of the unsuccessful creation of an Anthropos by Yalda- ha&, says the figure was of enormous dimensions (Irenaeus, Ag. Her., bk. i, xxx, A-N Libraly, vol. i, p. 107). The insistence upon vast size helps to identify the angel of gigantic proportions, who appears with a female angel called Holy Spirit to reveal Elkasai’s hook (Hippolyois. op. cit., bk. ix. viii, A-N Library, vol. i, p. 346) as the androgynous Adam, Adam Kasia. ’ See p. 19, n. 6.

Thou art the First and Thou art the Last! Thou, 0 Date-palm, [art] my Father and [Thou], Wellspring, my Mother from whom I derive being.’ Then he said ‘In the name of the Great Life Who is spirit and soul, health and purity, sealing and armed-readiness! May there be speech and hearing and forgiveness of sins for me, Mara-d-Rabutha- ADAM, son of Hibil-Ziwa, who came into the world as result of mysteries, as result of purification of the soul. For I have cleansed the mysteries of the Body.’ . . . (AT$, pp. 118 ff.) The second paragraph starts with ‘In the name of the Great Life’, a formula which precedes every sacred utterance in the sacred books. Adam throughout is the archetype of spiritual humanity and priesthood, of Adam as crowned and anointed Mankind. The cosmic Body, the ’&nu in which Adam Qadmaia appears in AT9 and other texts, includes the worlds of light and the worlds of darkness. Man’s body has organs and parts which perform what are thought to be menial functions and the cosmic Body of Adam, although immaterial inasmuch as it is the ideal counterpart of the universe, likewise possesses organs of diges- tion and evacuation: they are realms assigned to spirits of dark- ness and pollution, but also of catharsis. Thus: . . . and so, when food goes down and reaches the inside, the lower belly, Sdum-Daiwa [a being of the underworlds] cometh and by his agency and strength bringeth the excrements forth byway of Karafiun and two worlds, so that they come and fall into Sihiun (Sion),’ a valley which is the dumping-ground of dung and urine in one place. It is the world below the Ocean. . . . (AT$, p. 163.) So, too, the ‘nobler’ parts of man are assigned to the great spirits of light and life, or worlds of light: ’ Cf. a passage in the John Apokryphon quoted by Quispel, Gnorir a* Weltrelipion, p. 14: ‘I am the Father, I am the Mother, I am the Son, I am the Eternally Existent, the Unmixed who mingled Himself with Himself.’ This is probably an allusion to Jerusalem, with its Dung-Gate, and the valley into which refuse was cast."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"28 ADAM KASIA, THE SECRET OR HIDDEN ADAM . . . and to each of them their light is mutually visible, pleasing and displayed: their rays are formed lie one another for they are all of light: all form part of the single Body. And each of them is a world. And if it happened that these worlds divided it would he as if one of them were divided. The Body is One, and one the division. The head is one world, the breast one world and each leg a world: yea men unto liver, spleen, bowels, stomach, male organ, womb, skin, hair, nails, back and viscera, each one of them is a separate world.’ And when they commune together it is as between persons in whom there is no hatred envy or dissension. And if, amongst all these [worlds] there were one superfluous or another lacking from the structure of the Body, the whole Body would be harmed for they counterpoise one another and the Soul dwelleth in their midst as they with one another. And should they not be counterpoised one would corrupt the other and they, together with Body and Soul, would not he mutually established. For when the Body formed itself, the Soul was formed, and when the Soul took shape in the Body the Body formed the vital spirit [tuha]. And when both had taken shape, the Womb was formed, for the Womb is a great world, there is nothing greater or more powerful than it. (AT$, 163 ff.) The Mystic Adam is androgynous, and the male organ repre- sents the Father principle: it distributes (Diwan Malkuta ’laita) ‘streams of living water’ (i.e. Water of Life), and in AT3 it is said of it : And the male organ is vigorous in its strength and imperial majesty and the Body, [that is] the earth’ and sky and the worlds of light and darkness, is equipped therewith.

See Greater Bund&h, 189,8. quoted by Professor Zaehner in Zumm (p. 145). Similar correspondences between microcosm and macrocosm (bones like rocks, veins like riven, &c.) appear in two medical treatises by Hippocrates, De Hebdarodibus, bk. vi (Work, ed. M. P. E. Littre, Paris, 1839-61, vol. ix, p. 436), and De Beta, bk. iv (ihid., vol. vi, pp. 652 ff.). Their date and origin are uncertain but Oriental influence is to be suspected. * True to the mauocwm-mimocosm pattern, the earth too has an anthro- pomorphic shape, ‘the earth is a body, and air the soul therein.

In ARZ the organ of virility is assigned to ‘Abathur of the Scales’, the celestial being who weighs souls after death in his balances against the soul of Seth, and semen is attributed to Hibil-Ziwa ‘because thou, Hihil-Ziwa, art the Living Seed: Thou rulest us and all worlds.’ This scroll also assigns the bowels, spleen, and liver (lines 177 ff.) to the rulers of the under- world, such as ‘the great Giu’ and ‘the great Gaf‘, and so on. In Diwan Malkuta ’laita and ARZ the identification and naming of the organs and parts of the body (i.e. spiritual Body, both of the departed soul and of Adam Kasia) are connected with the recitation of liturgical prayers, as the latter mark the gradual formation of the spiritual body for the deceased during the celebration of the masiqta. In ARZ these prayers are said ‘in praise of and obeisance to’ the various organs and limbs named. When thou recitest the major ‘Blessed and praised is Life’f thou renderest praise and makest obeisance to the bowels; and when thou recitest Tab tuba l~~bi~,3 thou offerest praise and makest obeisance to the liver.

The priest belives that during the recitation of prayers and hymns during the nuzsiqta, with the loaves and wine-cup before him on his altar-table, these very organs are being formed for the soul of the deceased in the Cosmic Womb, represented by the wine-cup.

According to AT$ the blood which circulates in the Body . . . is lovely radiance and the Blood which is within the Heart is precious and sublime Radiance. The Blood in its Liver is lovely and plenteous Radiance that moveth in all the Body. These are four lights which control the Body: had they been three, the Body would not be established.

And then he planned celebration of the ma.s@taz and the qnasa’ was that although this body had organs of digestion, sexual reproduction, and 80 on, a change, a ‘cessation of office’ had taken place. The gnostics seem to have abandoned completely the Jewish and Persian idea that bones when the dead arise are the seed of a body of flesh and blood. The Zoroastrians, after birds and beasts had picked the skeleton free from pol- luting decomposing flesh, placed the bones in astodam. Oriental Jews have B tradition that the Havdalah meal strengthens a certain bone at the base of the neck which is nourished only by the Sabbatical Havdalah food. When a man dies and his hones moulder, this bone resists decomposition and becomes the seed of a new body at Resurrection. The Rabbinic ward for the indestructible hone is tf? (lriz), literally an ‘almond’ or hut’. This may explain the presence on the masiqta table of nuts (usually walnuts) although these for the Man- daeans have only a symbolic meaning, like seeds also placed on the altar. Mandaeans are so far from a materialistic view of life after death that graves are neglected and allowed to sink back into the earth after the third day, when the soul is thought to he detached from the corpse and ready to ‘arise’, only awaiting the formation of its ‘light-body’, which is necessary before it can leave the earth. On the day of burial the grave is sealed (see MMII, p. 186). and on the third day the seal (which wards off evil spirits) is removed. ’ See DA, p. iv. The soul must give B password at each ma(mta. Originally planets, in later manuscripts the matorota are given other names. The m+ta (lit. ‘raising-up’, ’resurrection’) resembles in many features the mass. The bread on the ritual table represents the dead, and during the rite, seeds and nuts and a tiny fragment of the dove’s flesh are placed on the wafers.

The word pmu suggests piacular sacrifice, and these ‘sacri- fices’ take place 6efore the actual mmqtu, and correspond closely to the Parsi Parapa,’ for they refer primarily to the milling of the wheat and crushing and pounding together of the sesame and dates.

Its slaughter is unmentioned in the GR or in the liturgy and its silent killiig before the wwiqfa and the tiny gobbet of its flesh placed with the ritual fruit and nuts on the fatiria, like the tradition that it is called the ba, are inexplicable. There are pictures of the dove and of a lamb on a ritual table in an illustrated Sarh describing the Blessed Oblation. The yearly slaughter of a male lamb at Parwanaiia,‘ which usually takes place before the mqta, but not always in the sacred enclosure, has nothing whatever to do with the latter sacrament, although a small piece of the fat is placed later on the Blessed Oblation table. The slaughter (with the usual formula for slaughter of a bird or beast) takes place on the fifth day of the feast. It appears to be nothing more or less than the yearly slaughter of a male lamb practised by a number of religious bodies all overtheMiddleEast(e.g. theYazidis)andregarded as aspring custom. The formula whispered voicelessly by the priest who slaughters the dove, in a specially washed and segregated square in the sacred enclosure, has a slight addition, for the priest tells it that it will rise with the commemorated souls. ’ The lamb is paid for by the community, and its flesh later cut up and distributed mmpt the housewives of the village. It is eaten by the various families who contributed to its cost.

This Adam represents human nature with all its aspirations, failings, and follies, and admonitions to Adam abound in such books as the GR. His selfishness is the theme of an allegorical story, a hieros- logos, told in that book. He has reached the patriarchal age of a thousand years when word is brought by celestial messengers that his time to depart the body has come. Adam is unpleasantly surprised for he has no wish to leave the world: he wants to live for another thousand years. ‘Go’, says he, ‘to my son Sitil (Seth) and summon him in my stead, for he is well fitted for the other world, since he has had nothing to do with women, has never shed blood and in all his eighty years has led a pure life.’ The messengers return to the Great Life and report. Adam’s sug- gestion is accepted by Divine Will and the messengers go again to earth. Visiting Seth the Pure, they summon him to leave the body. Seth, surprised, says that his father, far older than him- self, has precedence, and asks whether it would not be better that Adam should quit the earth before senility came upon him or disappointment in his offspring. ‘Besides,’ he adds modestly, ‘I have done no mighty works.’ The messengers explain that Adam is loath to leave the world and has sent them to him. Seth engages in prayer, joyfully lays aside hisbody of flesh and blood, and puts on the dress of glory and light. It is this act of filial devotion, say the priests, which makes Seth the purest of all human souls, against whose self-sacrifice and vir- tue soulsmust be weighed in the scales of judgement. If a depar- ted soul is pure enough to counterpoise the soul of Seth, Abathur ADAM AND HIS SONS 35 permits it to pass on from the judgement seat to MSunia KuSta.1 If not, it must return to the matarataZ for further purgation. There are several contradictory accounts of Adam’s creation. In GRr 13: 9 there is the bare statement Adam the Man and Hawa his wife were formed and the soul [nihta] fell into the body. And when the soul fell into the body, they discerned and understood all things. The statement is repeated in the same book and with it the corollary that ‘angels of fire’ served him. In GRr 101-2 the un- successful creation of Adam by Pthahil is related, and that the imperfect and lifeless creature3 was completed by Adakas-Mana who added a soul. In GRr 172: 13 it is Yawar-Ziwa who comes to the rescue and places the soul in the inert body made by Pthahil, and in another account of Pthahil’s vain attempt, it is Pthahil himself who, aghast at his inability to breathe life into Adam’s body, appeals to his father, Abathur, with whose help a mana kasia (occult mana) is procured from the House of Life and placed in the bodies of the human pair. Thereupon Adam sneezed’ and came to life, It was unwillingly that the soul came from the House of Life (GRI 74: IS) and before she entered Adam’s body she lamented and wept. The metaphysical Adam appears in the GR and other can- onical books under another name, Adakas (a contraction of Adam-Kasia) or Adakas-Ziwa, the Light-Adam. Adakas is the metaphysical Adam, the wholly spiritual humanity. He is the macrocosm conceived not only as an Idea but as an Ideal. Adakas is Adam the microcosm’s guardian, his soul, his mana, a messenger sent to him, a ‘youthful boy’,5 and in GRr 24s : 13 ff. Adakas-Mana proclaims himself to be ‘ See Chapter V. Places-of-detention (customs-houses), at the frontiers of worlds through which the soul must pass and expate her evil deeds and impurities. See P. 30, n. I. ’ Variations of the myth such as unsuccessful creation BS a prone lifeless figure, usually of huge shape, constantly appear in gnostic, Rabbinic, and Kabhalistic writings. Petermann’s text (pp. 235-6) and Lidzbarski’s translation (pp. 2367) give many of these aspects in a haggadie form. ‘ Like his prototype, see p. 26."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"36 ADAM AND HIS SONS the Head, Adakas the occult manu who came from Its place. Our name is ‘Offspring’, the ‘World of Law’ they call me. Our name is Resurrection of Life, our name is Tanna, our name is ‘living flames’. And I, my name is secret: it came from the House of Life. I am Adakas, the Radiance which came from the Secret Place. He is also the Word (GRr 235: 17 and GRr 236) who comes from the great mighty Mana’s presence. Adakas-Ziwa’s spouse, Anana-Ziwa,’ also called Hawa-Kasia (Occult Breath or Pneuma-Eve), produces three pairs of twins, male andfemale(GRr 104), to whom names symbolic of life and light are given. Finally the triad Hibil (Abel), &ti1 (Seth), and Anus (Enos) are born. Hibil, usually Hibil-Ziwa, is the light-bearer; his other names are Hibil-Yawar (the dazzling Hibil), Hibil-Mana, and Hibil- ’uthra. He is essentially a saviour-spirit: it is he who descends to the dark underworld to free souls imprisoned there and to bring back with him from the great ‘Well of Darkness’ thegimra (pearl), i.e. the soul, and a mysterious mruru2 (bitterness)--can it be the bitterness destined to be theJot of the soul on earth? How he achieves his ends is told in more than one version; and the purifying rites necessary before he could be readmitted to celestial circles described in priestly scrolls serve as patterns for those which must be gone through on earth for seriously pol- luted persons.

The verb l7.v means ‘to place’, ‘set’, ‘put’. The three-letter mot h.. (hq) means ‘to transplant’. It was from the latter Aramaic root with its enriched meaning that Nworaeans derived their name for Seth, for %ti1 is the trans- planted soul or mm. The fortyeight or more Coptic MSS. found at Naga Hammadi in 1946 apparently honour Seth as just this. ADAM AND HIS SONS 37 first suggest, Sun, Moon, or Fire, but the Jordan, pihta (sacra- mental bread), M$u (the ritual handshake symbolical of good faith and sincerity), mumbugu (sacramental drink), the Blessed Oblation, and the sanctuary itself. Anus (Enos in the Authorized version of the OT-the word like Adam means ‘mankind‘) is patron and promoter of Nasir- utha-and of Nasoraeans who profess and practise it. He is active as healer and guide: I took upon me a bodily form and went to the place Jerusalem; I spoke with my voice and preached, I became a Healer to Miriai . . . I was a healer of kuS@ [ie. a true healer] who cureth and taketh no fee. I took Miriai’ down into the Jordan and baptized her and signed her with the pure sign. (GRr 332: I ff.) In the Hurun Guwuitu AnuH guides the persecuted Nqor- aeans to Harran and later into Babylonia, and he avenges them by destroying Jerusalem. In the same manuscript AnuH or Anus-’uthra as he is also called, as patron of Nqirutha protects, baptizes, educates, and initiates John the Baptist. In both GR and DraHia d-Yahia he appears as intercessor for his clients, the Nasoraeans. Returning to Adakas-Ziwa, the Secret Adam, as over-soul of humanity, he ‘fell into Adam’ and Eve, the parents of mankind, after twins had been born to them (GRr 243 ff.). He raised them to their feet, lightened their eyes so that they saw, established their feet for going forward, opened their mouths for eating and placed Adam as ruler over animals, fruit, grapes, trees and the winged birds and fish in the sea which his father Pthahil’ had provided for Adam when planning for him. I A converted Jewess; seeTB and ML under Mijai. In the GR and other Mandaean texts there is much reference to Ptbahil as an unsuccessful creator, hut in the secret scrolls he hardly appears at all and there are only B few brief references to his name. In the Canonical Prayers he is mentioned four times but not as a creator. In the cycle of gnostic poems entitled ‘When the Pure, Chosen One went’, which describe creation, three long pwms of the series refer to him as disgraced (by hia failure as creator). These three pwms are omitted from CP. They deal with his punishment and eventual reinstatement.

In short Adakas is the guardian- spirit, the dmutu, the Over-soul of the human race, of all the descendants of Adam Pagria-his small reflection on the material earth. Adam Pagria, the microcosm, and his three sons Hibil, ’%I, and AnuH have nothing in common with the Jewish myth of Adam and his sons and grandson but their names, nor do the three brothers belong to the world of earthly mankind.

He is constantly mentioned in GR, and in Dragis d-Yahia the unsuccessful creation story is prominent. In the Ophite story of Yaldahaath’s failure to make man in his own image, Prounikos, the Mother, comes to his aid (Irenaeus, &. Her., bk. i, xxx, A-N Library, vol. i, p. 107). Lidzbarski (YE xxvii) suggested a connerion between Pthahil and the Egmtian god Ptah. Should this be so, such a connexion may point to an adoption through Alexandrian circles of Ptlh into the Creation story as Pthahil. Both R. Reitrenstein (Poimmtdres.

Festugibre (La Ilkidlation d’Hnmh TrisrnC girte, vol. i, p. 81) mention a Hermetic confraternity which flourished between the second century B.C. and second century A.D., even reaching Rome. The founder of the sect was an Egyptian priest who combined the doctrine of creation of the world by P* with an Oriental revelation about the enslavement and redemption of man. ‘Avec le temps, la doctrine revet un aspect de plus en plus mystique et I’6lhent dgyptien y tient plus de place. . . .

It is the home of AnuH WllX (And- ’uhu), to which he returned after his bodily appearance in Jerusalem, for he . . . came and walked in Jerusalem when he had put on a robe of water-clouds, in bodily semblance. He was not clothed in a physical garment: there was no heat or perturbation in him. He went and came in the years of Pilate [Paltus], a worldly king. Anus-’uthra came to the world in the strength of the great King of Light, healing the sick, opening the eyes of the blind, cleansing the leprous, raising up the broken and those who shuffle on the ground to walk on their feet, making the deaf and dumb to speak, the dead to live and gaining believers amongst the Jews and showing them that ‘there is death and there is life: there is darkness and there is light. There is error and there is truth‘ and converting Jews in the name of the High King of Light. Three hundred and sixty prophets emigrate from the town of Jerusalem testifying to the name of Mara-d-Rabutha. And Anu&’uthra mounteth upward and remaineth in MHunia- KuHla. (GRr 29.) The story is probably a polemic against Christianity in which the miracles of Jesus are attributed to AnuH, who, according to I The expression is difficult to translate. Mhmia is B West-Aramaic form (seeyB, p. xvii): it is derived from the root BNA, not in the sense ‘to remove’, as Lidzbarski thought, but in the second root-meaning, related to TN~, ‘to double’, ‘repeat’. Kdga (‘truth’, ‘verity’, &c.) has here the extended meaning of ‘reality’, for it is the ideal counterpart which is real, not its reflection in matter."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"40 MSUNIA KUSTA Mandaeans, was a ‘son of Man’, that is of Adam Kasia, himself a counterpart (dmut) and Son of the supreme Being. MSunia KuSta must he translated by a paraphrase: it is a sublime other-world of reality, for this material world is illusion, unreal, temporary. In my book MMII I gave an account of this world as given to me by Mandaeans in ‘Iraq : MHunia KuHta is the ideal world of the Mandaeans and peopled by the descendants of Adam-Kasia and Hawa-Kasia [the hidden or mystical Adamand Eve] ; for, as one priest told me, ‘of all things there are two, an actual and its mabda [ideal or archetype]’. Another ex- plained that each individual on earth has his double [dmutu] or like- ness in MSunia KuHta and at the time of death the earthly individual leaves his earthly body and assumes the ethereal body of his double. Part of that explanation, namely the last clause, could be modified by the ‘Adam’ teaching which will be dealt with later. The theory of doubles is Iranian as well as Platonic. Sir J. J. Modi writes:‘ On the death of a person, his soul [umdn or rmdn] meets with justice according to his merits or demerits. If he has deserved well he goes to heaven, if not to hell. His Fravashi, which guided him through life as a guiding spirit, parts from his soul and goes to its abode or place among all the Fravashis. It is the soul [urn&] that meets with good or evil consequences of its actions. The Fravashi or the guiding spirit, was pure and perfect, unalloyed and uncontaminated from the beginning and has passed away as such. So it is this pure and spiritual identity, the Fravashi, that is the medium, as it were, of the continued relation between the living and the dead. (MMII, PP. 54-55). Modi goes on to say that, according to the Avesta, all natural objects have their Fravashis, but not objects that have been made from those natural objects: For example, the trees have their Fravashis, but not the chair or table that has been made from the wood of the tree. God bas created ’ J. J. Modi, The Rrlt&&us Ceremonies and Cwtm of the Pmrees (British India Press, Bombay, qzz), p. 413, THE WORLD OF IDEAL COUNTERPARTS 41 the Fravashis of these natural objects from the very beginning of creation. Before the creation of the object, there existed the Fravashi of that object, perfect, complete and correct. The Fravardin YaSt, which is in praise of the Fravashis, seems to dwell chiefly on their office as guardian spirits. Their presence in the material world is necessary to the struggle with Ahriman and evil, so they hover everywhere as protectors of men, trees, sun, moon, cattle, and all the good creations of Ahura-Mazda, guarding, warning, and blessing. In the Bundahign Ohrmazd (the Pahlavi version of Ahura-Mazda) appeals to the fravahn (Pahlavi form of Fravashi) of human beings and invokes their aid. At death the fravahr separates itself from the body (taw or nsta = ‘bones’)’ and rejoins its fellow guardian spirits. Plato’s ideal world is akin to both the Mandaean MSunia KuSta and the Parsi world of prototypes: The temperature of their seasons is such that they are free from disease and live much longer than we do ; and in sight and hearing and smell and the other senses they are as much more perfect than we as air is purer than water and ether than air. Moreover they have sanctuaries and temples of the gods, in which the gods dwell in very truth. (Phuedo 1x1 b.) The air of Mgunia KuSta, too, is etheric, and worship there is perpetual, the archetype of earthly worship. MSunia KuSta is reached after purification, and is not the final goal.* And thus, as they depart, set forth and fly into the sky, traversing the road, they behold the Gate of Mercies which is opened in the midst of MHunia Ku@a and then they move onwards and sit at the boundary that bounds Mhnia Kugya which no earthly being may cross unless signed with the sign of the Jordan in true sincerity [lit. and kd@ was therein]. So there spirit and soul wait until they are taken up into worlds of light. And from the day that she departeth [the body] till the day that she setteth forth, she [the sour] beboldeth those forms, trees and souls ’ See p. 29, n. 4.

(ATS, pp. 189-30.)5 The writer of ATS describes how Hibil-Ziwa, when baptiz- ing Adam and Eve, procured bread (@a), sacramental drink (mambuha), myrtle, and incense from MHunia Ku&a. The ‘Letter’ is the rite for the dying (see p. 73). Tinfa also means ‘urination’ (as it may here, as a word-play). ’ The sacramental bread. The meaning is, that there it needs no baking. ’ i.e. all the fruits, nuts, and other necessary adjuncts for the sacramental meal. A similar ideal world is described in the Parthian Manichaem hymns (see The Mmrichun Hymn-Cycle in Parthim translated hy Dr. Mary Boyce: the Huwidagmh, i, pp. 6777. THE WORLD OF IDEAL COUNTERPARTS 43 Because souls clothed with an [earthly] body neither consume nor perceive food and drink which is from above, [from] MSunia KuSta; and bodies which (exist) on Mgunia KuSta do not eat of food of the Second [i.e. material] world on account of the mysteries of death which are inherent therein. Any person who eateth earthly fwd but wisheth to depart the body should [consume] nothing but that of the mrr;Pta, the ‘Letter’, the Commemoration and the ‘Of the Fathers and forgiving of souls’,’ for they [samamental foods] rise hence and are given to SOU~S.~ (Ibid., pp. 190-1 trs.) That this over-soul or spiritual counterpart acts as guardian spirit appears here and there in Mandaic stories, as for example when Miriai, the Jewish princess converted to NaSirutha, falls asleep in the bd dkna (sanctuary). Her fellow worshippers slip out without awakening her, but her ‘sister in KuHta’ rouses her and bids her wake and depart beforecockcrow. Occasionally the soul itself is called a ‘sister in KuHta’ as in AT$, p. 241, and later, in the same scroll, the dmut or dmufa appears as conscience: Amongst [them are] those whose feet stumbled and whose dmutu warned them so that they perceived her and knew. Such men are elect and redeemed Nasoraeans. (Ibid., p. 363.) Dmuthiia (Counterpart-of-Life) is the name of one of the divine male and female twins born to the mystic Adam and Eve (seep. 36), her twin being ‘Son-of-Life’. Of her it is said ‘from her (Dmuthiia) the world was called into being’. If the passage is continued without a stop, she appears as the mother of Hibil, Sitil, and And, instead of, or as a counterpart of, Eve (Hawa). She, or he, for the sex varies, is often praised, worshipped, and identified with other emanations of the Great Life. In his pre- face to Tafir Pap (part ii of AT$ p. 168) the priestly author writes of his treatise: And the Aspect [Parpfa] of Mara-d-Rabutha [the Lord of Great- ness] is portrayed herein. It dissecteth all mysteries and explaineth ’ Rihd meals commemorating the dead. Lofomi. The aged sometimes end their lives voluntarily by eating and drinking nothing but the sacraments.

(AT$ p. 168.) The image of the mirror is employed again and again in this poetical religion. Water mirrors light; one being reflects or is the image of another.

(AT.$ p. 167.) The world of archetypes as a religious conception reappears in medieval Germany, and Modi’s description of the fravahrs quoted earlier in this chapter (see p. 40f.) agrees with startling accuracy with a description of the archetypal world given by the Jewish mystic Eleazar ben Yehudah of Worms who died at the end of the thirteenth century. He, like the Hasidim of Palestine appears, Professor Scholem remarks, to have been influenced by neo-Platonic thought. (May not Jewish Kahbalists have preserved something of the gnosticism of earlier centuries?) I will quote what Professor Scholem says : Of special interest in this connection is the doctrine of the arche- ’ ‘Trees’ and ‘vines’ usually mean ‘believers, those of the true faith’. THE WORLD OF IDEAL COUNTERPARTS 45 types. . . which dominates Eleazar’s work on ‘The Science of the Soul’ but is of importance also for the ‘Book of the Devout’. According to this doctrine, every lower form of existence, including lifeless things,-‘even the wood block‘ to say nothing of even lower forms of life-has its archetype, demuth. (Scholem, op. cit., p. 117.) If, with Scholem, we assume that thirteenth-century Jews borrowed conceptions such as these from neo-Platonic writings, it will also he asked at what period did the idea of archetypes penetrate Mandaean-NaSoraean teaching ? Could it not pos- sibly have been introduced during the Moslem period, together with passages which resemble the Hermetica? (see Appendix). The answer is emphatically No. The entire theology of Nasir- utha rests upon the twin motifs of archetypes and syzygies. This dualism, possibly Magian in origin, perhaps Pythagorean, must have been well rooted in Judaea in the first Christian cen- turies. We find it in the Clementine Homilies, though in a form which seems to suggest that it was part of secret teaching. Thus : Homily 11, chap. XV:’ Hence therefore God, teaching men with respect to the truth of existing things, being Himself One, has distinguished all principles into pain and opposites, Himself being sole God from the beginning, ‘ See Cad Schmidt’s Studien zu den Pseudo-Clmmtinm, Texte U.

Their conclusions have been disputed with some heat by other theologians, e.g. Bultm- in Gnomon, uvi, 1954, p. 177, and with greater reserve by A. D. Nock, Gnomon, xxviii, 1956, pp. 621 ff. The Clemmtine Harnilier and Recognitions are, according to most scholars. probably based on a lost work (or on lost works) in circulation at the time, called the Periodoi Pehou and Krygrnotu Petrou. The supposed date of these and of the Clementines has been much in dispute. The sources were thought by Schoeps to he dated circa AD. 160-90.

The word nufs means roughly ‘self‘: it is that which expresses individu- ality, the person; and is only occasionally used for ‘soul’. Persons as people are often referred to as nismata, ‘souls’, or almia, ‘worlds’. The ruhu is the vital spirit (see p. 6), the seat of desire and lust. Personified, it becomes in the GR andJB the enemy of the niJimta (soul), and in polemical passages, as Ruha-d-QudSa (Holy-Spirit), sheis a demon, the ally and mother of the planets. In esotericwritings the polemical Ruha-d-QudSais not mentioned at all: the ruha is sometimes portrayed as a trembling sister to the soul, looking to her as a ‘sister in kuSta’ for help, or as re- pentant and longing for redemption. The spirit speaketh to the soul saying ‘By thy life, by thy life [O] Soul! take me with thee as thy companion1 If I did loose persecution upon thee, [yet] do in kindness remember me, for I knew not and understood thee not. Well is it for one who walketh in kindliness, for all that he seeks he shall find. (Diwan Malkuta ’laita, lines 213 ff.) Again, when the novice-priest has performed his first baptism and places his foot on the Jordan-bank: The spirit [&I rises up from the depths of the Body [‘@ma] and is embraced by the soul [niSimta] who is sitil [Seth], and she says to her ‘Take me with thee as thy companion!‘ (Ibid., lines 507 f.) Compare this with another passage in the same manuscript: And They said to them [candidates for&esthooa] ‘Who is He who formed you and in whose lap were ye nurtured?’ And they said ‘We"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"48 THE SOUL were nurtured in the lap of Ruha; but my Father, our Father, shaped us, He whose name is Pure-Ether.’ And they said ‘We have hated the worlds’ children and the bed of the Mother, the Companion before whom no [companion, spouse] existed.’ And they said ‘Accursed be Ruha and anathematized! she who liveth in horrid darkness, sitteth in company with devouring fire and drinketh red waters.

Woe to those who loved gold and silver . . . did not turn away from Earth, nor came forth from within their Mother. (Ibid., lines 167 ff.) Of the mana we have already spoken. Twenty-eight hymns in the Ginza (GRI 38: 18 to GRI 74: I f. and trs. pp. 452-504) begin with the words I am a mana of the Great Life, A muna of the Mighty Life am I, A muna I am of the Great Life. The first hymn opens with a bitter lament-‘Who hath made me dwell on earth, who hath cast me into the physical body (‘:tun pag.ia)z which hath no hands or feet and howeth not how it will walk? It lies there and crawls’, for this is the soul’s complaint when put into the still imperfect Adam. She is com- forted: Manda-d-Hiia, Knowledge of Life, comes in answer to her cry of dismay and urges her to rise and seek her home, return to which is assured her. In hymn after hymn we find first the complaint and cry of the imprisoned manu and then consolation and promise. These hymns are probably intended to be read antiphonally, first the cry of the mum and then the comforting words, and priests still intone them at the graveside or in the homes of mourners. A second series follows in GR in which the chief theme is ’ A gnostic metaphor for crossing from the world of matter into that of spirit. Yoma d-Suf = Sea of Reeds, Red Sea, Sea of the End. Seep. 83. $fun, see pp. 5, n. 2 and 21, n. I. I. 49 THE SOUL that of redemption and glory: ‘Depart in peace, Chosen, Pure One!’, ‘Go, soul, triumphant to the Place of Joy’, and ‘Come in peace, thou pure Pearl!’, and in the second series the word nilimta is used oftener than mana. All these hymns of the soul voice genuine devotion, moving sorrow, and belief in future lie. In all the holy books hatred and horror of the body‘ are expressed, a hatred hardly logical in a people whose whole literature shows delight in life, flowers, trees, and natural beauty. These, however, are not thought hateful. When the soul left worlds of ether she brought with her as consolation some of the lovely gifts of Life. When the Soul came from worlds of light and fell into the Body, there came with her some of all the mysteries which exist in the world of light: some of its radiance and light, some of its sincerity, some of its unity, its order, its peacefulness and its honesty; some of all that there is in the realm of light came to bear her company, to delight her, to purify her and surround her so that she may commune with them and that there may be for her that which will aid her against the evils and temptations of the earth. And the evil spirit [nrha] came with her, accompanied by all the mysteries that exist in darkness, and into the body she introduced song, frivolity, dancing, deceit and falsehood, excitement and lust, lying and witchcraft, violence and perversion. . . . . For spirit and soul are distinct from one another and I placed strife between them. (AT$ trs. pp. 215-16.) In ARZ, the soul’s dowry is the . , , sweet-smelling flowers and herbs, and the trees and the good things which we gave to the soul as her escort when she wishes to go to the house of her father-in-law. For she is Our crowned Bride: I give her to them as a bride but they are stupidly indifferent to her, hating her, detesting her heartily; and [although] she gives light to their gloomy abode, sweeps it and cleanses it, her mother-in-law grumbles about the bride. She hangs up lamps of radiance at night, but they say to her ‘Thy ‘ ‘Good is the day when I depart from thee, stinking body, and when I am 620s E Purified from evil deeds!’ (Diwan Malkuta ’laita, line 209)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"50 THE SOUL lamp gives out no light]’ She sets out delicious fare before them and spreads out for them [couches], hut they remove that which she spreads out, saying to her ‘Fetch water instead” or ‘Guard the door from thievesl’ wishing to get her out of the house. And they know not that they will die, perhaps falling asleep on their beds into an everlasting sleep on the spot. And in their folly they slay the living soul, hut before they kill her, they kill themselves unwittingly. Then they know that a body without a soul is speechless and that it is the muna which establishes it. I tell you, my brother ’uthras, that we cannot permit the soul to he held back in gloomy darkness1 If ayoung husband loveth his wife, she will love him and not desire to see her parents: she cuts herself off from them, forgetting her mother’s breasts and the home in which she grew up. If she is an unwilling bride [lit. ‘hating bride’] she will get the better of all her slayers, will be spurred on by the compulsion through which she has passed, making her forget her brothers and parents and re- main cut off from security. Nevertheless, We will see to this our holding (property), so that she may come and dwell with Us. (ARZ, lines 227-40.) It must be remembered that the manuscripts just quoted are intended for priests only, and the extracts given only occur here and there, for over the whole gnosis priestcraft broods with menace of penalties in this world andthe next shouldthe hundred and one rules for ritual purity and correct procedure be in- fringed, wittingly or unwittingly. The future of the soul here and hereafter depends, it would seem, less upon virtuous deeds than upon observance of ritual purity and punctual and meti- culous performance of all the rites of the Nacoraean church. A soul which died a ‘polluted death’, such as in child-birth, or by fire, accident, attack by a wild beast, or under conditions con- sidered ritually impure, becomes ‘the portion of Darkness’ (AT$ trs. p. 225) and is doomed to the matarata unless the rela- tives of the deceased pay money for redeeming masiqtas. With- out either ‘Letter’ or mm’qta a departed soul has little chance of escaping torment in the future life, and must long sojourn in Aramaic +?2 (see J. val. z, ‘complement, replace’). To fetch water is the duty of a female servant. THE SOUL 51 what are practically purgatories. To die naked or wearing ordinary dress is to die in a state of impurity, hence every year during the five intercalary days (Parwanaiia, Panja), the ‘five days of light’, many persons commission the Blessed Oblation known as Ahaba &Mania (Giving of Garments). A proxy acts the part of the deceased who died ‘improperly clothed’ and in the latter’s name is baptized, puts on a new ritual dress (rasto, the word is Persian), and eats the sacred meal.’ At this time, too, masiqtas are celebrated (for fees) and the names of the departed are read in lists at commemorative Lofunies--(the literary name is huja, communion, union) at which bread is broken and eaten ritually and water drunk in the same way. The AT3 in Tafir Pagra, a composition which must be dated after the introduction of the silk-moth into Persia, gives a picture of life after death in which the magarata are entirely unmentioned : We, the Great Life, made all mysteries [ginzia] and We freed the soul so that she should not remain encaged [in the body]. That which We brought out from Our midst shall come and return to her place, hut not in that appearance in which she went forth from amongst Us. When she cometh hither [to be] with Us, she will not go hack. For when We sent her and placed her in the Body like a grain of mustard-seed, We sent her and placed her and gave her to Hibil- Ziwaand she writhedandtwistedin his hand when she felt its warmth. And so he brought and placed her in heat and cold, casting the seed so that it fell into its garment of heat and cold. . And then she emergeth from the Womb as a chicklet cometh forth from the egg. And the soul liveth and issueth from the interior of evil mysteries so that she meeteth the eye and is seen. (AT$, trs. p. 188.) Here the manuscript shows signs of imperfection, for a com- parison with the silkworm should begin here, but is missing. The ‘leaves’ referred to in the continuation are mulberry-leaves or, figuratively, leaves from the tree of Neirutha. So they nurture it upon a diet of leaves.

Thus it happened that in a little year, that is forty- five days, I perfected that mystery, that mystery pregnant and sown therein. Hence, from that which seeketh tuta, tufa goeth forth.

I The reference is to the ‘sacred union’ of the cosmic Father and Mother during m’qta rites. See WW, chap. Y. * Reed tutu gnmaia (inner remorse). Tutu = (a) ‘sorrow. remorse’, (b) ‘mulberry-tree’. 3 Periods at which rites for the ‘rising’ or ‘raising-up’ of the soul are per- formed, representing stages of her progress, are performed on the third and forty-fifth day after death (see MMII, p. zoj, n. 16, and WW, pp. 149, 185, 234, 257). THE SOUL 53 And then a cleft is rent in the body which dwelleth in the midst of worlds and generations. And they loosen the girdle of the chosen one and there, at the first aperture, the first formation, is a knot which is a great boundary placed between Light and Darkness. If the soul crosseth it deliberately downward she becometh the portion of Dark- ness, and if the spirit [da] passeth over it upward, she becometh the portion of Light. And so, when spirit and soul have reached their end together and seek to leave the house of the body, there she-each of them severally -1ooseneth her own mysteries and [then) they fly hand-in-hand into the sublime ether as one. For, when the ruha accompanieth the niSinrfa, the twain become, as it were, a single body, like seed and stock formed by two bodies. As they commingle, rejoicing, a [single] form resulteth from them. And thus, as they depart, set forth and fly into the sky, traversing the road, they behold the Gate of Mercies which is opened in the centre of MSunia KuSta. And they move onward and sit at the boundary which bounds MZunia Ku$a which no earthly being may cross unless signed with the sign of the Jordan in true sincerity. So there they wait, spirit and soul, until they are taken up into worlds of light. (Ibid., pp. 1889.) Of the final union which lies even beyond the worlds of light there are glimpses, chiefly in the hymns. One of the most beautiful is recited at baptism. It is probably one of the oldest. In the name of the Life! What did thy Father do for thee, Soul, The great day on which thou wast raised up? “He took me down to the Jordan, planted me And rose and stood me upon its bank. He broke’ and gave me bread [pihfu] Blessed2 the cup and gave me thereof to drink. He placed me between his knees And pronounced over me the name of the Mighty [Life]. He passed into the mountain before me. He cried loudly that I might hear, That I might hear he cried loudly, ‘If there is strength in thee, Soul, come! ’ ’ Pta (tit. ‘opened’) = ‘broke open, broke apart’. Lit. ‘praised’; i.e. pronounced the Benediction."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"-- 54 THE SOUL ‘If I climb the mountain I shall fall, I shall overturn and perish from the world!’ I lifted mine eyes to heaven And my soul waited upon the House of Life. I climbed the mountain and fell not. I came and found the life of my Self.’’ The question is repeated, and the beginning of the reply is the same, then: “He passed into the fire before me And cried loudly that I might hear, That I might hear he cried aloud, ‘If there is strength in thee, Soul, come! ’ ‘If I go into fire, I shall bum, I shall scorch and perish from the world!’ To heaven I lifted mine eyes And my soul waited upon the House of Life.

If ye do not desire her, she will not remain with you!’ Then Ayar (Ether) took down the veil which he had drawn over her before them, and when he had taken it down the radiance of the soul shone out over them: they all fell on their faces and said ‘Have mercy on us!

The word is derived from a root meaning ‘to increase, be abounding’. They become denizens of the ethereal world from the moment that it was called into existence. They are not First Emanations, but they were created by them, although this is often apparently contradicted by what is said of them in the texts. Mulkiu, ‘kings’, apart from its literal and derived meaning when applied to priests, is a term which may indicate evil beings as well as good: there is a malku d-nhuru (king of light) and a mulku &hSuku (king of darkness), but these are epithets, des- criptive of characteristics rather than names of beings. The word gubru, ‘man’, applied to any non-material being does not mean a human being, but a being anthropomorphically visualized; whenever the termgabru is applied to such a being in Mandaean literature it must be understood in this way. Myths attached to such beings are usually told in allegorical or folk-tale form, for they are intended for the edification of those not versed in the inner meanings of such parables. In the secret texts there is little, or only remote, allusion to such myths, with the exception of that attached to the saviour-spirit Hibil-Ziwa and his descent into the underworld. Two priestly scrolls make this story the theme upon which to hang an account of the exact way in which a Blessed Oblation and the ‘Great Baptism’ (360 baptisms) should be celebrated. They are the Sarh d-Masbuta d-Hibil- Ziwa and the MdHZ. The latter leaves out most of the story as told in the GR although the tale is told in a similar lively folk- tale style. Hibil-Ziwa and his companions set out for the under- world in ships, protected by magic talismans, seals, and weapons of holy might, preceded by banners of light to hold PERSONIFIED EMANATIONS AND ‘UTHRAS 57 spellbound the spirits of darkness who might behold them. The account of the visit to the realms of darkness is brief. Hibil-Ziwa, when he arrives at the world of Anatan and Qin,’ is welcomed without suspicion. Qin shows her visitor, Hibil-Ziwa, where the jewel (gimru), mrmu (bitterness), and the mirror have been hidden and he pilfers them without her knowledge. He also takes away Ruha who has been mated to her brother and is pregnant of ’Ur and of the ‘warriors of Darkness’, i.e. the planets. All this is explained in a few short lines: the narrator is chiefly interested in the return and ascent. The first stage of ascent is the ‘Letter’, which means the sacrament for the dying, in fact the whole sequence of events related represents the rites neces- sary for the ascension of a son1 after death: the ceremonies are described at great length. The manuscript first mentioned, the Masbuta Rabtia, is de- voted to a detailed description of the 360 baptisms ‘of Hibil- Ziwa’ and of the ceremonies and prayers which precede the baptisms, and gives the number of gundwiu, priests, as’gundiu, and banners which must be present. By the time that this text was composed, the number of ecclesiastics had dwindled, so that a method of compressing 360 baptisms into a few had to be contrived. The greater part of the manuscript is devoted to commentary and explanation of all the rites, including the Blessed Oblation and the Mmiqtu. In the GR the story of descent, ascent, and return is told quite delightfully.” It is an ancient story, a version of which is related in Apuleius’s Golden Ass as the story of Eros and Psyche, and part of it may he based on Babylonian myths. Hibil- Ziwa’s sojourn in the underworld lasts thousands of years. In the first underworld he finds Ruha. He travels farther in a dis- guise which no ma can penetrate-in this story spirits of dark- ness are called munus. By each king he is given a passport into the territory of the next: one of the talismans is the skundolu.3 Qin, possibly from the root vp, ‘to fabricate, work in iron’, &c. (hence See GR, tm. pp. 150 ff. the Cain of the Bible).

He takes her and the mruru with him, and, appearing as a beautiful stranger to Qin and Anatan, tells them that he comes as suitor for their daughter Zahriel.z(Ruha, their other daughter, is wedded to her brother Gaf.3) The story of the wedding is related racily and in great detail: it might almost be a description of a betrothal and marriage in the marshes today. Qin is entranced by the suitor’s comeliness : he is embraced by Anatan and accepted as future son-in-law. Zahriel describes to her mother the unearthly beauty of the ring he has given her. Guests are bidden to the marriage, a feast made ready, and a wedding-tent and golden bed prepared for the young pair on the nuptial night. At the wedding-feast Hibil- Ziwa merely pretends to eat and drink, and the next morning when, as today, according to custom, the mother visits her daughter to inquire what took place, she hears that the bride- gloom did not remove the bride’s veil, that is to say, he left her virginity intact. Qin asks anxiously if the bridegroom possesses that which makes a man. Zahriel replies that he does. Questioned by his mother-in-law, Hibil-Ziwa replies that in his country a man waits seven years before a marriage is consummated. By magic, worked by the ‘great Mystery’ which accompanied him, the seven years are converted into seven thousand myriad ycars. Qin tells her strange son-in-law secrets of the World of Darkness and how it came into being: ‘She saith to me, “We came into being from the Tanna4 and procreations of the Dark- ness and from the whole suka [extreme, limit] of the Black Waters.” ’ ’ Xpj = ‘whiteness, beauty’. 3 = ‘body, person, self‘. ‘ Here ‘womb’? 5 Ni&o is B word of wide meaning, ‘plant’, ‘planting’, ‘implanting’, ‘propagation’, ‘fertilization’, ‘procreation’, &c.. and in ATS tyab +to means ‘took to wife’ or ‘performed a marriage’. i.e. the Womb of Matter. PERSONIFIED EMANATIONS AND ‘UTHRAS 59 In foolish trustfulness she shows him the well in which a magic mirror lies in which they ‘behold their faces and know what they intend to do’. Again he deceives her and takes the mirror. The end of this allegorical fairy-story, for such it is, is long and confused. Zahriel passes out of the picture, yet, as appears from other passages in the book, the unconsummated marriage results in the birth of Pthahil, who thus has within himself a heritage from ‘both sides of the family’ as child of light and child of darkness. The end of the story is concerned with the woes and perplexities of Zahriel’s sister Ruha, who, pregnant of ’Ur by her brother, passes weeping upward through other worlds of darkness. She asks Hibil-Ziwa several times, ‘When shall I reach my parents?’ But the parents for whom she longs are still not the Parents whom she must one day seek and it is in the worlds of darkness that ’Ur, the Serpent-child, the giant, is born. I need not follow the myth further : I have told it only to show how the story of Hibil-Ziwa’s journey is told in the GR and the Surh scrolls. In the secret literature it is almost ignored. In the GRr little is said about the elaborate purifications necessary before Hibil-Ziwa is freed from pollution. The Nip.& (‘Drop’) immerses him in seven Jordans u/tw he has embraced his Father (GRr 152: 9), and from that immersion he goes to the Jordan ‘of the Munu and its Counterpart’ (mum udmuth) My father [here Mundu-d-Hiiu is meat] baptized me and pro- nounced secret signs (ruhm’a) over me. He baptized me in three hundred and sixty thousand myriads of mighty Jordans of white water, and all the ’uthras who were with me. (GRr 153: 4 f.) There is no mention of the ‘Letter’, or of the Blessed Oblation; only of baptisms, or immersions. An ’uthra prominent in priestly scrolls is, of course, the ’uthra who is the archetype at once of priest and bridegroom, %lam- Rba. The name, like Adakas, is probably a contraction of two words, but what are they?’ He is the protector of Nqirutha and I plq (W) and d7Y? Or a Sbafel of ELM?"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"60 PERSONIFIED EMANATIONS AND ’UTHRAS promotes the welfare of Nqoraeans both in this world and in the next. He sanctifies the continuance of the race. Both as priest and bridegroom he is crowned, but the bridegroom’s crown is a wreath of fig-leaves and myrtle, whilst the priest’s crown, a silken fillet, represents the ether-crown which rests on the brow of Adam Kasia (see p. 6). The rituals of ordination and of marriage are described in three priestly scrolls, the Sarh d- Tarasa d-Taga d-SiHlam-Rba, the Sarh h-Qabin d-Siglam-Rba, and a defective section in the ATS in which the marriage with ’zlat-Rabtia (Great ’zlat) is related in Part Vb. The marriage of the two is described as a ceremony which reflects the Sacred Union: And then the Guardian of Mysteries speaketh, saying to the Great Primal Father, the Hidden Radiance: ‘0 Lofty King to whom ’uthras submit themselves! Reveal this word and tell me what this testimony is lie, why it exists and what doth the transplantation’ resemble?

In Part VII of the same manuscript, &lam-Rba is called the son of Life ‘who standeth at His right hand’. As archetype of priesthood he admonishes and inspires priests, just as a lower type, Yubmin or Yugamin-Rba, typifies the inexpert and care- less priest. And should there be aught of Yusamin-the being whose throne was overturned-in his mind, do thou [0] %lam-Rba see to it. For thou art Our sight, thou hast no cause for anxiety, thou dost not fret or trouble thyself as to whether thou wilt be questioned about thy misdoing. Teach thy priest! (AT$, p. 296.)

PERSONIFIED EMANATIONS AND ’UTHRAS 61 In the Diwan Malkuta ’laita and in the Coronation prayers all Nature breaks into manifestations of joy when the crown of priesthood is placed on his head: the ‘white waters which dwell in the Wellspring’ sport and rejoice, the Jordans frolic and dance in CP Prayer 307. They say Our glory here hath shone out It hath shone in this new crown The lie of which existeth not. Blessed is this new crown And blessed are its leaves which shall not fall. The last line indicates that the original ‘crown’ of priesthood was of living leaves, and not of metal or silk. The priest’s in- signia are his crown, his gold ring, his staff, and his banner, or perhaps ‘regalia’ should be the word since he is a king. The banner in the Coronation prayers is called SifZunzieZ, and in the canonical prayer book twenty canticles are intoned for it. On the other hand, neither %lam-Rba nor his banner are mentioned in the GR. The word for ‘banner’ is Persian not Semitic4ru6k1, pro- nounced drafsha: it also means ‘a ray or beam of light’. In Persian the di~ufsh ( SJ 2) is a ‘banner or standard, a flash of light, or sunrise’. In hymns the banner is always a symbol of light. The Persian origin of the word may offer some clue as to the time when it was adopted as a symbol used in cult or religious ceremony.’ Professor Henning was good enough to direct my attention to Persian coins. On those of the Frataraka dynasty of Fars, somewhere about zoo B.c., a banner is repre- sented beside a fire-altar: on one set of coins, that of Autophra- dates the First, the king stands by a large fire-altar in an attitude of worship; the banner is planted on the opposite side of the altar above which is the winged effigy of Ahura Mazda.

The fire-altar’ has shrunk to the small but nevertheless essential he-saucer. The banner is planted beside it just as on the Persian coin, although the pennant part is lengthened considerably. I think that we have a clue here. The adoption of the banner, together with a great many names of cult objects, vestments, and so on point to Persis or Parthia. Supposing migration to be accepted as possible, was all this adopted before or after migra- tion? Possibly the latter? Tibf was the centre of the cult at the time of the Moslem invasion, and YZqiit, in Mu‘ajam al- Buldan, mentions the report that Tib ‘was one of the residences of Seth, son of Adam, and that the inhabitants of the town never ceased to confess the religion of Seth’ (i.e. Mandaean sitil). He also says that they were Nabataeans speaking Nabataean (i.e. Aramaic). Fars is actually mentioned in the second of the banner hymns, (CP, NO. 330): In the name of the Great Life1 When Radiance emerged from the white land Faris, A youth, Arsfan, unfurled a banner: He unfurled a great radiance So that ’uthras and tkintas shone in its glory. They shone in the brightness of his banner Like radiance in the House of the Mighty. [i.e. Furs, Persis] Can it be deduced from this hymn, from the silence of the GR on the subject of the banner and its omission of &lam’s name, that both are accretions due to an Iranian environment after emigra- tion to the south-east, and that SiKlam is a late aggrandisement of the sacerdotal caste? Whether we consider &Slam a figure of later cult or not, ’ Little is said in Mandaean texts about the fire although it is always present and necessary for the incense and for haking the sacramental bread. Its purityis strictlypresewed (see p. I 13) and in AT3 we read that ‘a baptism without fire will not ascend to the House of Life’. The town has now disappeared: it lay in a well-watered district between the mamhes of southern Iraq and the Jebel Hamrin. Seep. 105, n. 2. PERSONIFIED EMANATIONS AND ‘UTHRAS 63 Yawar, or Yawar-Ziwa, certainly belongs to an older stratum. The hymn cycle ‘When the Proven Pure One went’, part of which appears in GR, represents him as the ’uthra to whom is entrusted the creation of the ether-world and its inhabitants. Most of the canticles of the series are recited at every wedding and at the ‘coronation’ of a priest. The root from which his name is derived, ’UR or AWR, has a double meaning, ‘to blind or dazzle with light’ or ‘to awaken’. The basic idea, perhaps, is that light falling on the eyes of a sleeper causes him to awake. Hence as a spirit of dazzling light, who wakens to life and to light, he appears in the gnostic cosmology as one of the first emanations. In Hymn 374 we see him in all his glory: I worship, praise and laud The four hundred and forty-four thousand names Of Yawar-Ziwa, son of Nbat-Ziwa,’ King of ’uthrar, great Viceregent Of Skinata (sanctuaries, shekznahs) Chief over mighty and celestial worlds Of radiance, light and glory; Who is within the Veil, within his own Ainta, Before whom no being existed. His spouse, Simat-Hiia, ‘Treasure of Life’, has already been mentioned; the pair are often invoked together. Names with Ziwa (Radiance) as part of them seem to be aspects or functions of Primal Light. Hibil-Ziwa, for instance, seems to typify the enlightenment of Man, Hibil being one of the sons of Adam, which explains his occasional identification with Manda-d-Hiia (Knowledge-of-Life) (e.g. AT$ p. 140, No. I 14), for one ’uthra is often equated with another when their respective functions overlap. Occasionally Hibil-Ziwa appears as a counterpart of Yawar-Ziwa (Dazzling or Awaking Radiance); they sometimes converse together, as a man will with himself (AT$, p. 210). This identification of one ’uthra with another often happens with Mara-d-Rabutha (Lord of Greatness), partly &C. ’ mot: the root NET means ‘to spring forth, burst forth’, ‘spring upward’"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"64 PERSONIFIED EMANATIONS AND ‘UTHRAS owing to the double meaning of rdutu, which means not only ‘greatness’, ‘magnificence’, but has a technical meaning. A rba is a priest who initiates candidates for the priesthood, and his office is termed rabuta. Rbu then becomes synonymous with ‘master’, ‘teacher’, like the Jewish Rabbi, and as a title is written Rbai So-and-so. It is extremely difficult to detect, when Mara- _d-Rubutu is mentioned in a text, whether the allusion is to the priestly teacher or to the divine Teacher, Adam Kasia. Connexion between one ’uthra and another is often indicated by the word br, ‘son of’, or ab, ‘father’. They have of course no literal meaning but they show that the beings named are close in personified relationship one to another or, rather, are aspects of each other. Manda-d-Hiia, literally ‘gnosis of Life’, is, therefore, quite often identified with Mara-d-Rabutha. His function clearly ex- pressed by his name, he is usually a teacher of the true doctrine, for instance, in GRr, book I I, he instructs Anus (Biblical Enos) thus: (267.) ‘Come, I will reveal to thee about the detestable mysteries of this world, which thou hast seen’, &c. It is curious that in so long and important a document as AT9 (and other secret scrolls) he is hardly mentioned at all, save in quotations, or when identified with Mara-d-Rabutha. I suspect that he be- longs to the same era of composition as Pthahil, who is also considered negligible in the secret scrolls. Abatur, pronounced Awathur, is a mystery-figure and the meaning of his name uncertain. He is sometimes called the ‘Third Life’. Andreas, according to Wilhelm Brandt,’ derived the name from old Persian words meaning ‘provided with (or “possessing”) weighing-scales’.” If so, the second part of his name _d-muzuniu, which distinguishes him from the higher counterpart, is repetitive, for it too means ‘of the scales’. His ideal counterpart is Abutur Ram, the ‘Lofty Abathur’. The parallel with the Egyptian weigher of souls is obvious; the Persian Meher Davar at the Cinvat (Bridge of the Requiter) also weighs ’ W.

Purely allegorical are (a) Kurfa, a personification of truth, sincerity, and vows and also of the ritual handshake which symbolizes good faith, and (b) Hubfabu, ‘first of the week’, Sun- day. Minor allegorical figures abound, for instance Nbuf or NbapHiia or NSab-Hiia (‘Life-burst-forth’, ‘They-planted- Life’, kc.). Abad-ukiw (He-acted-and-succeeded) is one such name: all or most of which refer to activities and emanations of Life. One most important ’uthra, Bihram, however, must be con- sidered separately because he is so closely associated with the rite of baptism. His name is Iranian (Avestan VaGaBrayna) and the Mandaean Bihram may be the Persian genius of victory (New Persian Buhrtim < Middle Persian Vurhrrin). He has a Yalit to himself and the original form of his name, Verethragna, is, according to Professor E. Benveniste, best rendered as ‘celui qui abat la resistance’, i.e. ‘victor’.’ Water entered into Vere- thragna’s cult. The presence of the banner at Mandaean baptism may be connected with Bihram’s banner of victory, to which I have referred on p. 61 f. The words pronounced by St. John the Baptist over his candidates for baptism are not chronicled in the gospels. Those pronounced by the Mandaean baptist are these: Thou art signed,with the name of Life: the name of Life and the name of Knowledge-of-life [Manda-d-Hiia] are pronounced over thee. Thou art baptized with the baptism of the great Bihram son of the Mighty. Thy baptism shall protect thee and shall succeed [be &acim]. The name of the Life and the name of Knowledge-of- Life are pronounced upon thee. (Cambridge, 1959), pp. 15342. ‘ For a more recent view see I.

They deal also with the correct performance of all rites and religious ceremonies. In these scrolls, therefore, there is only an occasional hint or reference to the inner meaning attached to ritual acts. Nevertheless, when these are set together a picture gradually emerges. Each rmu, each ‘mystery’, is a drama, and the actions performed by its celebrant express in mime and symbol what that ‘mystery’ represents and what effect each sacra- ment has on the soul for whose benefit it is performed. Scrolls intended for perusal in the hut of initiation are more outspoken, but they are still couched in the language of parable and symbol, so obscure in expression that none but a ‘true NaSoraean’ can interpret its meaning. The mysteries of NaSirutha are reserved for men who realize that the mcmu must be hidden from the unworthy although these embody truths essential to the under- standing of religion. Baptism is the foundation of the whole redemptive system: it is spiritual rebirth. It cleanses body and soul and symbolizes rising into a new life: the ascent to the bank after immersion is symbolic. It is an individual act-though there may be several candidates, only one at a time descends into the water, just as later on a man or woman goes down into death alone. They are still in the physical body (the ’s@zpugria). When on the bank they wait with others who have been baptized for the sacra- ’ MYSTERIES AND THE GREAT MYSTERY 67 mental bread and water’ and the signing with sesame oil, this conveys the lesson that whilst they are still ‘in the body’ they share with fellow believers the higher life into which baptism admits them. Hence the unction and communal meal of baptism represent a luufa, a union or communion. The bread itself is a ‘mystery’. The wheat is brought, selected, washed, dried, and ground in a quern by the priest in the mundi or other purified place. He has previously immersed himself, robed, and said the preliminary prayers. He mixes the flour with salt (called ‘the mystery of the soul’), wets it with ‘Jordan’ (running) water, and bakes it just before the baptism on a fire-saucer used for this purpose and for burning incense. Of the breaking of bread as a symbol of creation we have already spoken (p. 3). The banner planted by the fire is a symbol of light and of Bihramz and the gold twisted beneath its peak is a sun-metal symbolical of the Father. In this world baptism is a protection: it wards off evil spirits, disease-demons, and the attack of inauspicious planets. In the next it is all-important, for the soul ‘which descended into the water and was baptized‘ has been ‘signed with the Pure Sign’, ‘signed with the Sign of Life’. When the departed soul arrives at the frontier guarded by Abathur.3 she displays it as a pass- port prompted by the guardian with whom she has been pro- vided. All those souls who were signed with the Sign of Life will be met by a guardian. If not, the soul’s deeds will accompany her and bear her company until, at the frontier-house, her evil deeds stand revealed. (AT$ p. 264.) ‘ The Jewish Christians, the Ehionites, used water not wine in the baptism sacrament, which use some early Church writers confused with the sacrsments of the mass, as did, apparently, Irenaeus (&.

Such is the simple ritual meal called Luuja, ‘union’ or ‘communion’--lojuni* in the vernacular. This is a communal ritual eating of bread and drink- ing of water followed by other foods symbolic of life. It is celebrated after death at the graveside or at intervals after death by mourners, and the immaterial double of the food consumed by them is supposed to be eaten by the spirit of the deceased whose death is commemorated,as well as by those of any other dead persons whose names are mentioned with his, with the I Baptism does not replace self-immersion, which should take place after any pollution such BS child-birth, sexual connexion, menstruation, &c., and is also curative of certain forms of illness, such as lunacy.

The name covers several different forms of the sacrament. In all of them, together with unleavened loaves (round), fruit, and other ritual foods, bread appears in an unusual shape. It is the !a, emblematic of the Father. This may be either (a) two flaps of breadrolledtogether’ in a tight scroll into which the celebrant inserts morsels of ritual food all symbolic of fertility, or it may be (b) a solid, sausage- shaped lump of unleavened dough about four or five inches long. Both appear to be models of the phallus.z The first type, (a), of !a is used at the wedding sacrament: when broken in two, half is eaten by the bridegroom and half by the bride. A second Oblation is celebrated after the wedded pair have been purified by baptism. An account of the wedding Oblation is given in detail in MMII, pp. 59-72, and need not he repeated here. Priestly commentaries on and descriptions of a heavenly wed- ding are given in a section of AT9 and in the S&Q. I have found in none of the ritual scrolls in my possession a definite indication of what, at these Oblations, symbolizes the ‘Mother’. Commentators state that at the masipta her womb is represented by the cup or bowl of freshly drawn water into which grapes or raisins have been macerated; hence it is likely that the wine-cup similarly prepared at the Oblations is also re- .presentative of her reproductive power. Dates (sindirka) added to the wedding cup only intensify that power, for to the ‘Mother’ - 4. Trin faiiria dabfin bhdadia (Diwan MaShuta Rahtia, line 132).

A similar object of phallic shape appears in a Nestorian rite ,(see WW, pp. 70 ff.) which apparently represents the conception of the Virgin Mary.

Commen- taries enumerate what should be placed on the various Oblation tables: for a wedding (Bodleian Library MS.

Both these Oblations are for living persons. The ya for the Oblation after burial is solid and no nuts or fruit are inserted, nor are they in the Ahaba &-mania, for both are celebrated for the dead, not for the living.

The soul of Adam Kasia is being ‘raised‘ by the ceremony. So he hearkened to the Word and took white sesame from the bank ‘ Seep. 69, n. 2 and p. 71. n. 4.

Then they soused the bimunda. And they took the wheat, a quern and fuel from mulberry trees and took in the white sesame, pounded it and extracted its oil. And they kneaded and pressed bread with oil lie the anointing of the wreath. Then they folded and wrapped the pandamaz over their mouths. Thus did they make preparations until the dawn.

This narrative continues without a break to a description of the first mm@a performed by the divine celebrants for the soul of Archetypal Man.

The actual performance of the mm’qta is described in full detail in W. It is, of course, easy to recognize in many details of these rites ancient fertility magic, which, in the marriage sacrament lies behind the insertion of seeds and scraps of prolific fruits in the bread eaten by the pair-they hope to have children. The true Nasoraean, unperturbed by such an identification, would readily assent and accept, for he knows and understands the language of symbol and would find in this nothing to offend his worship of the Great Life. Asceti- cism is abhorrent to him, to carry on the gift of lie is the will of the Great Life. Although to the soul the body is a prison, she accepts and is grateful for the good gifts which sweeten her exile. They are meant to be used and enjoyed, not to be misused or rejected. Man may take pleasure in those things which delight his soul; beauty, the warmth of sun in winter, pureair, thegreen shade of trees, the fragrance of flowers, sexual intercourse within In the ritual manuscripts SDbuta (goodness, benefaction, bounty, &.) often means ‘bread’ and is so understood.

MYSTERIES AND THE GREAT MYSTERY 73 marriage,’ which should be early, the begetting of children and delight in them; the finer pleasures of the senses,* but not lust; eating and drinking, but neither greed nor fasting. The GR is full of precepts urging moderation and condemning celibacy and mortification of the flesh. When a man prays for forgiveness of sins, in the next breath he prays for ‘joy of heart’. The approach of death should be welcomed if an absolutely pure life has been led, but too often it is accompanied by dread, for, no matter how innocent a life a man has led, he faces peril. His death must be ritually ‘clean’, he must neither be naked nor wear ordinary clothes-at the moment of passing he must face the north, and, above all, a priest and his assistant must be present for the last rites. Otherwise his soul may be held back or pass into torment. The sacrament for the dying, called ‘the Letter’, isundoubtedly ancient. As I said earlier, it is referred to in the Syriac ‘Song of the Soul’. It is fully described in the book of liturgical prayers and hymns and I was given an account of it which can be read in MMII; but when writing that book I did not realize that the ceremony should be performed for every dying person. A candidate for the ganzivrate must have been present at such a ceremony for a ‘perfect’ (see p. 43, n. 2) before he is linally consecrated in office. Nowadays it is rarely performed in toto because priests are few and often far, so that to summon a priest and an as’ganda (acolyte) to a deathbed in time is usually im- practicable. Part of the rite is performed in most cases. As soon as the relatives of a gravely ill person think that death is imminent, and often while life hangs in the balance, he or she is dressed in ’ According to Epiphanius, early marriage was enjoined by Judseo- Christians (Nazarenes) and by the Elkasaites.

The im- mersion may be either in the river or baptismal pool, or water may be drawn from either running source and there and then poured three times over his or her body. The death is then ‘clean’ and what is lacking may be atoned for later, usually during the five intercalary days, by dukrana (‘mentioning’) at ritual meals and Blessed Oblations. Should death overtake a Mandaean whilst not dressed in the rusta or naked, an Ahaba &mania rite must be performed and a mmqta is desirable. In the chapter on Adam Kasia much has already been said about the w’qta, the mystery of mysteries. We have seen that it symbolizes the creation of the Secret Adam, the cosmic Adam, limb by limb in the primeval vastness of the cosmic Womb, the Mother.’ Just as his embryo was developed and built up until the whole Archetypal Man was formed, so, by invocation of those tremendous cosmic powers, is the soul of the deceased provided bit by bit with a spiritual body. With Man and in the Divine Man, he is born again. Were St. Paul’s words (I Cor. xv. 22) to be slightly altered, they could be those of a Nqoraean -‘For as in Adam all die, even so in the Secret Adam shall all be made alive.’ The masipta is so holy that lay eyes may not witness it, so sacredly dangerous that the least slip, the least omission, must be expiated by baptisms and repeated mariqt~s.~ The gravest mistakes such as those which concern the ‘semination’ (pouring water into the wine-cup) may disqualify a priest for life. In WW I recorded as faithfully as I could how modern priests celebrate the rite. But they did not tell me the symbolic meaning of the actions they performed and for reasons explained in the Epilogue I have sometimes wondered if they really knew. The AT3 and the ARR and the other secret texts describe the first archetypal mqtu celebrated for Adam Kasia. The ARR begins I Commentaries on the mosipta use the words ‘Father’ and ‘Mother’ of the two cosmic powers during the ‘sacred marriage’. a ATS in Mhita umta specifies errom and omissions committed during celebration, and enumerates the baptisms and masiqrm necessary to atone for such fsults.

Today, a masiqtu should be celebrated by a gunzibra (head priest, chief celebrant), two priests, and an dganda.‘ The masipta described in ARR appears to have only two celebrants, Ayar-Rba (Great Ether) sometimes called Ayar Dakia (Pure- Ether) as gmzi6m, Mahzian-the-Word as concelebrant, and a spirit called Bihdad as dgunda. The Body of Archetypal Man is, apparently, still theoretically unformed; I cannot explain this confusing assumption. Throughout the mariqta he is called Adam-Shaq-Ziwaz son of Himat-Razia,3 for in an earthly masiqta the name of the mother must be given. His soul, that of future humanity, since man is not yet created, is pictured as bodiless, anxiously watching the mysteries and impatiently awaiting the ‘ninth month’ when the divinely-conceived Body is given birth. The rites up to the time of birth are described as being ‘of the Mother’. The second part of the mmqta, which is supposed to mime the baptism of the soul, her anointing with the chrism and the provision of viaticum for her journey towards the worlds of light, is, according to the running commentary, ‘of the Father’. The narrative shall be quoted from the point when the qnasa performed outside the sanctuary (seep. 31) is accomplished: the slaughter of the dove in silence has taken place: 75 They cleansed it [the dove’s body], brought the mystery of salt and put with it, cooked it and took it over to the bimunuiz.‘ Then they entered the bimumfa and each [celebrant] put on his vestments; set his table before him and placed thereon thefatink,’ the dove’s flesh and See pp. 73, 107. a ‘Adam-was-bright-Radiance’ (PIW, ‘to he bright, to laugh’, is paralleled by pnr, ‘to laugh or smile’). ‘Now it is a most typical feature of El in Ugaritic literature that he “laugh$’, y& . . .’ G.

It is unnecessary to continue, for the rite proceeds, with only slight difference, as described in WW, pp. 242-58. It is to the commentaries that we now look for explanation of the rite. As the mm’qta performed by Adam is the first of its kind, and as yet there are, supposedly, no human beings, the sixtyfaiiria on the ritual table (which today represent the souls of the dead) are explained as ‘souls of sixty priests’ due to come into earthly existence in the far distant future: ‘thirty from the world of the Father and thirty from the world of the Mother’. Liturgical prayers are quoted as milestones or landmarks; the commentary running thus: And when thou takest the phial and recitest over it ‘Ye are waters of Life’,” thou rousest the Semen which seeketh to fall down into the Womb, for thou prayest a command to shed water on the earth.’ (ARR numeration of lines impossible because of illustrations).

The explanations given by the priestly commentators are in- volved: it often seems as if they were reading from a palimpsest, in which first one writing and then another were visible. The reason is, that thefuiiria, as representative of the Body of Adam, symbolize, not only the souls of the dead awaiting their light- bodies, but also that Body, of which they as human beings form part, the limbs and organs, the spirits of light which govern them- the spiritual powers of the cosmos. ARR uses Persian words when describing the ‘semination’: And when the Semen falletb on the blood in the Womb,‘ it puri- fieth the blood and maketh it of one nature with Itself so that there is no darkness therein. And when thou makest the three passes2 thou placest three names upon it [ie. the fagira] ‘which are MUHR, RST and RST’.) And these are various epithets of Yawar-Ziwa. ARR enumerates organs and limbs at great length, for, should any mistake occur, the ‘light-body’ would be injured. After the water has been poured into the wine-cup, the com- mentaries liken what follows to the nine months of gestation. The Great-Ether says to Adam Kasia: Note that there are nine Tab rabias,’ one for each month till the infant is developed, stage by stage until, at the ninth month, Pure- Ether comes and enters into it and turns its head downwards. Because every soul that leavetb the body descends downward-and then rejoices, seeks grace, leaps up and rises towards Me.

MYSTERIES AND THE GREAT MYSTERY 79 The soul ‘on wings of ether’ is on her way to Abatbur’s scales, confident that the w‘qtu has cleansed and redeemed her, for she is wearing the glorious robe of Yuzataq-Manda-d-Hiia.’ Throughout any mm’qtu the priest assumes the identity of the soul for whom the mariqfa is celebrated. The expression in Mandaic is curious, he is ‘clothed in’, that is acts as, the soul of the departed. Before the mmqtu actually begins, priests baptize each other and partake of the simple baptism sacrament of bread (salted) and water. This is repeated, minus the baptism, in the cult-hut as soon as the mmqtu is over. The pihtu (sacramental bread) he consumes in character of the departed is one of the fatiria into which, like the others, small pieces of the ritual food and a sliver of dove’s flesh has been added. It is brought into connexion with the other loaves by adding to it fragments from two of the piles offatiria which lie before him. Before it is swallowed by the celebrant, thepihtu is wrapped about a myrtle wreath, unwrapped, signed with miss (oil) dipped into the wine-cup, and consumed whole. Then the priest drinks the ‘wine’ and the water which rinses the cup. Throughout this very elaborate and lengthy ritual the priest is terrified of making a mistake. Should he do so, not only would he injure the soul he iepresents, whose spiritual body may be maimed, but he himself will suffer. Penalties are heavy, graver omissions or mistakes may be punished by degradation to lay status. He is as responsible as a chemist making a dangerous compound. Not only may he spoil what he is makiig, but he may blow himself up! If he goeth wrong, and signeth at one of them or both of them [ie. twoprayers to be recited] blindness in the eyes and deafness in the ears resulteth. (AT$ p. 208.)

(A?‘$ p. 207, No. 35.) The commentaries vary, but follow the main line of explana- tion. Over-elaboration is characteristic and it is often difficult to follow or disentangle one metaphor from another. The ARR is one of the simpler commentaries: that is the reason why I chose it. This most solemn of all rites remains a profound experience to the devout, a supreme act of faith and worship. And Mara-d-Rabutha‘ set Himself above all, for He is the Head, the Sign, the Crown and the Wreath. The Word dwelleth in Him and Vision, fragrant perfume and the Ear which heareth all things. (ATS, p. 232, No. I 14.) The name ‘Mara-d-Rahutha’ is given to Adam Kasia in his aspect of Arch-priest and Initiator into the higher rites. A priest who initiates a novice is a rba (vulgar rbai) and the office of teacher to intending priests is called robutha. IX THE LANGUAGE AND IDIOM OF NASIRUTHA IN Western art, poetry, and rhetoric, personified abstractions such as Liberty, Truth, and Charity are often invoked: they are portrayed as asleep, smiling, weeping, betrayed, or victorious, but they are not worshipped. Gnosticism deliberately employed anthropomorphisms; it was no unconscious choice which evolved the Valentinian Sophia (Wisdom), the Marcosian Ennoiu (Idea, Thought), and the N+oraean Mana (Mind). There had been ratiocination: the inventors of gnostic systems needed a fresh language to convey metaphysical concepts: they sought ways of conveying philosophical ideas in terms of religion and of expres- sing the belief thatthematerial worldwasan illusion of the senses. The process was a gradual one. It is difficult to detect where the language of poetry ends‘ and that of Jewish eclecticism begins, an eclecticism which gradually freed itself from Judaism and became gnosticism. We see the process at work in the pre- Christian Book of Enoch and the Wisdom of Solomon. In the latter, for instance, Wisdom ‘is a breath of the power of God‘, ‘an effulgence from everlasting light’; she ‘hath power to do all things’ and ‘from generation to generation passing into holy souls she maketh men friends of God and prophets’.z Addressing God the poet says: ‘(Thou) who madest all things by thy Word and by thy Wisdom thou formedst man.. .give me Wisdom, her that sitteth by Thee on Thy throne.’3 Such language, divorced from Judaism and wedded to syncretism, fathered gnosticism. Philo and before him Aristobulus, both Alexandrian Jews, In Iranian relrgion there is a pantheon of deified abstractions such as Wlsd. of Sol. VII. as, 26, 27.

Although both were loyal to the Jewish faith and customs of their fathers, they had imperceptibly reached a point at which Judaism could absorb a number of syncretistic theories; it was but a short step to the gnostic theology of the Nqoraeans. Philo had already presented the macrocosm-microcosm idea, so prominent in Nqirutha in a manner likely to appeal to Jew and Gentile alike: in the Book of Enoch the metaphysical Adam already appears. Gnostics of the earlier Nasoraean school found, ready-made as it were for their purposes, such Old Testament figures as Adam (man),’ Enog (mankind), and Eve HUWO (Mandaic wind, breath, spirit).2 To these personified figures allegorical narratives were at- tached. The art of exegesis had been employed for a long while: Philo used it to reconcile Stoicism with Hebrew stories which he retold exegetically. Huggaduh was the name given by Jews to this well-known way of telling and retelling stories in a way which conveyed hidden meaning. It was practised widely and not only by Jews of the Diaspora. Jesus taught in parables and some of the stories about Him related in the Gospels were thought by the scholarly Origen to be unhistorical.3 I The Qumran community must have believed in the other derivation of Adam, i.e. ny, ‘red’, for they constantly refer to his being made of dust. i.e. red earth, which refers to the ‘physical’ rather than the ideal Adam. * In Mandaic homo means both ‘wind‘ and ‘Eve’. Professor G. R. Driver writes to me: ‘This resembles the Ass.-Bah. ad “to speak”, Ugaritic hwf “voice” = Hebrew ?In, h6w&, how& “bluster”; “ill-wind, ill luck”; “disaster” and Syriac “ruin”and I$& “wind; disaster”. The basic sense may be seen in Arabic 69, “blew”; “whispered”; “rushed; fell”. I presume that Hebrew Vq, XI? (= Aramaic tQ9) “fell (I), fell into, became, was” is the same mot. Obviously this is an onomatopoeic root; “open your mouth”, “expel the breath” (ete.). . . . Your main contention of howa “breath, wind, spiFit’: seems to he incontestable.’ 1 Origen, De Pr~nctpiir (of the gospels): ‘. . . those narratives which appear to be literally recorded there are inserted and interwoven, things which cannot be admitted historically, but which may be accepted in a spiritual signification’. St. Augustine is said to have adopted Christianity only when he learnt from Amhrosius that the Bible was to be understood allegorically rather than literally. According to Reinhold Merkelhach (‘Ems U. Psyche’. Philologusioz, 1958,~. 114),‘DieserArtder Exegesest~taberausLgypti- scher Tradition und ist zum Beispiel von dem alexandrinischen Priester und Philosophen Chairemon geiiht worden.’ __ THE LANGUAGE AND IDIOM OF NASIRUTHA 83 Carrying symbolism further in order to conceal secret doctrine from the uninitiated, the gnostics invented a code-language of their own, to which Jewish mystics contributed Gematria, that assigned a number and hidden meaning to each letter of the alphabet. Finally the Pythagorean number-mysticism provided them with yet another method of mystification. Indeed, a searcher for the inner meaning of such literature is often re- minded of the Russian doll which when pulled apart discloses another, and yet another, reaching finally the tiny inmost figure -itself an image! The Nasoraean availed himself of this language of symbol and occasionally himself furnishes a key. For instance, in ATS (p. 179, No. 236) he explains that by ‘Adam and Eve’, ‘Ram and Rud‘, ‘ Surbai and Sarhabiel’,’ ‘EtherandFire’, ‘Sunand Moon’, he means ‘soul and spirit’. Elsewhere ‘soul and spirit’ are likened to the primal cosmic Father and Mother, and the latter pair are reflected in a number of ‘pairs and opposites’, such as Sun and Moon, Radiance (ziwa) and Light (nhuru), Sky and Earth, Rain and Earth, or Water and Earth, Date-palm and Well- spring, Gold and Silver. In this language of hidden meaning the tomb is a womb and the womb a tomb. ‘Crossing the yam d-SuP means crossing from a material state to the world of spirit. It is sometimes possible to recognize code words in other gnostic systems. For instance, we are told of the Manichaeans,3 that souls of the deceased (the sparks) are conveyed to the moon, which swells like a pregnantwoman till the fifteenth night ‘ These are the names of surviving human pairs left to repeople the earth after the destruction by sword and plague, by fire and by water of its in- habitants, each pair, like Noah and his wife, being sole survivors. These periodic destructions, caused by astrological conditions, must he related to the Persian and Greek traditions of destructions by flood and fire at the ‘great year’, a time when the planets had moved to their original positions in the heavens in relation to the constellations of the Zodiac.

I) to ultimate perfection- in the Neoraean idiom, ascent through the Mystic Adam to worlds of light. In short, we could have here reference to a Manichaean ‘mystery’ to assist the ascension of a departed soul. Figures of speech used by Nasoraeans are familiar to us in the Old and New Testaments: they are those which spring naturally to the lips of tillers of the soil who depend on mountain freshets as well as on perennial streams for water to irrigate field, garden, and vineyard and on rain to produce grazing for their flocks. In the Bible as well as in Nasoraean literature the vine becomes the symbol of the whole community as well as that of the true believer.’ The use of this simile is intensified in Mandaean poetry, the wordgufna, ‘a grape-bearing vine’, is attached or added to the names of angelic beings as an honorific or title, e.g. Ayar-Gufna, Run-Gufna, Sar-Gufna, &c.

The tendrils that curl at the leaf-ends Bore prayers, hymns and sublime recitations. When I arose in my place I made a request that was great; I asked that a tall ladder be given me That I might place it against the Vine for ascent, That against the Vie for ascent I might place it And might mount into my Vine, Might wax great and grasp its foliage, Might eat, be refreshed by its shade And enjoy its leafiness, Might twine me a wreath of its tendrils And place it upon my head. Vines as true believers occur in the first of the baptismal hymns: This and other similes2 are unlikely to have originated in the present home of the Mandaean sect where the date harvest re- places the vintage of milder climes. In one hymn Carmel is mentioned : In the name of the Life And in the name of Knowledge-of-Life And in the name of that Primal Being Who is Eldest and preceded Water, Radiance and Glory; the Being who Cried with His voice and uttered words. Because of His voice vines grew and came into being And the First Life was established in its abode. Hearers are urged to uproot the bad vine and replace it by a good one (GRr 22, ult.).

In the GR the sacramental form used for the grape-bearing vine, hamar-kana’, does not occur. As ex- plained elsewhere, the sacramental wine is not fermented juice but water reddened by the maceration of grapes or raisins.” Ham-kana has a further meaning, for kana means ‘a group’, ‘an assemblage’, as well as ‘a root’, hence the expression kana 6-nihata (congregation or ‘root’ of souls) is linked by its double meaning to the vine just as in Ps. lxxx. 8 ff. the vine is used as a symbol of the people of Israel.3 Indeed the synoptics as well as the Fourth Gospel‘ abound in phrases and allusions understood and used by NaSoraeans, such as ‘children of light and children of darkness’,S ‘living water’, ‘everlasting life’, ‘bread of life’, references to wheat and grain, sheep and shepherd, fish and fisherman, and so on. Names are ‘blotted out of the scrolls’ of divine beings; the Day of Judge- ment (’ym dina) and the Last Day are constantly mentioned. There are those who have ears and do not hear. Souls stumble and are supported, stray from the right path, and there is the ‘Way’ which must be followed without diverging.

(Cf. Matt. xxvi. 2.9, &e., and Souter, Lexicon NT, sw. wlth definitions and cross-references.) Professor Bultmann (Ewagelium der Jahnnner, Gtittingen, 1950) has pointed out in great detail parallels with Mandaean phrases in the Fourth Gospel.

THE LANGUAGE AND IDIOM OF NASIRUTHA 87 speak and be heard’ as an initiation formula’ (the corollary ‘knockandit shall be opened to you’, Luke xi. 9, does not follow). The equivalent of a ‘voice from heaven’ (yip n3) is often heard in Mandaean narratives and a cry of woe on earth is heard and answered, especially in the magical texts. Nasoraeans use some words which might be called ‘parables inminiature’. Children and disciples are called ‘plants’ :taking a wife (which is understood to imply founding a family) is ‘planting a plant’ or ‘establishing propagation’, for the word nipbta both inMandaic and Syriac has extended meanings such as ‘procreation’, ‘fertilization’, ‘repro- duction’, and in such texts as the AT3 it often means ‘bride’. There is no precise explanation of the symbolic meaning of myrtle, the presence of which is necessary to all Mandaic rites2 It may be that in some earlier form of the ‘mysteries’ myrtle was not originally a necessary adjunct, or it may perhaps have been because ritual inhalation (still practised by Jews, see WW) re- sembled too nearly Magian barsom-rite. In which case, reticence may be, like the silence on the subject of the sacred fire, due to the dangerous proximity of the Magians. The myrtle prayers, however, appear to be ancient. Myrtleis used in Jewish rites, and in my book WW, chap. vi, I described these and pointed out similarities with Parsi ceremonies. In MMII (p. 206) I said: The drinking of the hamra follows the Abahotan’ and this drinking of fresh fruit juice and water is combined throughout with myrtle rites and the formal ‘smelling the perfume of the myrtle’, thereby intensifying . . . the implied symbolism of evergreen immortality and of the resurrection forces of spring, germination, and growth. The wealth of symbolic phrases, of symbolic words, of sym- bolic acts of personification, and the use of the ‘ear that hears and the eye that sees’ make Nasirutha, even in its most extrava- gant expression, the poetry of religion. 1 For instance at ordination this phrase is said before the novice enters the cult-hut for the final coronation and investiture. a The omission of m rtle and of the myrtle wreath is a sin, which according to Mhita uarota (AT& needs purification by baptisms, repetition of the Rahmia (family office), and so on. 8 The longer Commemoration prayer.

His Messianic claims were believed in by many; and although his miracles, or what passed as such, were branded as magic by his opponents, nodoubt a tu pope was not missing, although it has not survived.‘ For an inquirer about Mandaean Nasirutha the importance of Simon is shown by the fact that by Hippolytus and Eusebius as well as by the author of H this Magian is described as a baptist and as a disciple of John the Baptist. On both counts, this makes the Clementine picture of Simon a valuable one as representing a still surviving tradition about one who has been called ‘the first Gnostic’. The chief point at issue between the disputants is not, as one might have expected if the original is a late one, the Mes- siahship or Sonship of Jesus, whom Peter calls ‘this good king’, ‘the prophet of the Truth’, ‘the true prophet’, one ‘of a succes- sion of prophets, being sons of the world and having knowledge of men’; it is the difference between Peter’s view of Adam and his Creator and that of Simon. According to Peter, God the Creator first made the world and all that is in it, and then his creature Adam. Peter is a monotheist and defends his position as such, whereas Simon, according to Peter, is a polytheist who places another Unknown and Unknowable God above the Jewish God the Creator, and thus turns Jehovah into his Agent. What actually was Simon’s teaching? Hippolytus gives a somewhat confused account in book vi of his Refutations of all Heresies, using as his source Simon’s own book Great Announce- ment, now lost. According to it, above this our world are great creative powers, ‘from above’, male in character, and ‘from below’ (female): he calls the first pair ‘Mind‘ and ‘Intelligence’ (or ‘Idea’, “Ewota). These are the production of a ‘Great Indefinite See A. D. Nock, Conversion: from Alexadn the Great to Augustinr of Hippo (Clarendon Press, 1933). X THE BAPTIZERS AND THE SECRET ADAM IT is with consciousness of temerity that I venture in this chapter to touch on subjects that are outside my own special ground of study. I ask, therefore, for forbearance in the hope that scholars better equipped than myself may find in the following attempt to trace the Nasoraean Adam grounds for further study of early Jewish gnosticism. In Chapter V I quoted from the Pseudo-Clementine Disputa- tions. As remarked in a footnote to page 41, the dates of this romance and that of writings presumably used as its sources are still the subject of controversy. Nevertheless, it seems to be agreed that the Disputations reflect the opinions and beliefs of Jewish Christians between the first and fourth centuries,’ and, as such, they must be treated as genuine. The fictional dispute between Peter and Simon the Magian, therefore, is of value to this inquiry of ours. It is represented as carried on in the Socra- tic tradition, with courtesy and logic on both sides.2 ’ See 0. Cullmann, ‘Die neuentdeckten Qumrantexte und das Juden- christenhlm der Pseudoklementinen’, Natestamentliche Studien fiir Rudolf Bultmmn, Berlin, 1954. Simon, like Marcion, sees in the Jewish Creator B being who is often unjust, cruel, partial, and fallible, and, posingas a fundamentalist, he quotes the OT to prove it. He tells Peter that the Jewish Creator-God is really identical with the Demiurge who, indeed, was fonned in the image of God as said in Genesis, but sprang in anthropomorphic form from B Supreme Being who is unknowable, ineffable, and entirely beyond human compre- hension. Peter defends the OT whilst accusing it of being the faulty work of man: if statements derogatory to God appear in it, they are not to be believed. ‘Whatever sayings of the Scriptures are in harmony with the creation that was made by Him are true, but whatever are contrary to it are false’ (H. 111. xlii). Peter denies that Adam, ‘who ww fashioned by the hand of God’, ww ‘a transgressor’ (If. 11. lii). It seems that Peter regards Adam w something more than the father of mankind, however, and he hints that Adam was reincarnated as Christ: ‘hut the Other, as Son of Man, being B Male, prophesies better things in the world to come’ (H. 1x1. xxii)."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"90 THE BAPTIZERS AND THE SECRET ADAM Power’ ‘at the root of all things’. He likens it to fire, which is of, two kinds,’ secret and manifest: the former may be perceived by the spiritual but ‘evades the power of the senses’. The generated world springs from the ‘Unbegotten Fire’ that is from God (Deut. iv. 24). He who was begotten from the principle of that fire took six roots.. . primary ones of the originating principle of generation. And he says, that the roots were made from the fire in pairs, which roots he terms ‘Mind’ and ‘Intelligence’, ‘Voice and Name’, ‘Ratiocination’ and ‘Reflection’.z (Refutation, Uc., A-N Library, hk. VI, chap. ix, p. 201.) Simon’s Tree of Life has yet another, seventh, root which permeates and dwells in the others: ‘a great, indefinite, existing power’ which is androgynous. Simon calls it ‘the Father’ and ‘He who stood, stands, and will standI.3 This bisexual, creative power is the emanation of pre-existent, indefinite Being.‘ The All-Supreme, the ‘One Root’, is Sige (Silence), Invisible and In- comprehensible. It exists in isolation yet has expressed Itself in creative emanations ‘in a state of duality’. Hippolytus sees in the mystical fire of Simon a plagiarism from Heraclitus, but we must not forget that Simon was called a Magian, and here we may see an effort to reconcile the Pentateuch to the sacred and purifying fire of the mobeds. The method of identification is ’ In the Mandaean hooks we get constant reference to two kinds of fire, ’Rilta and haito, ‘consuming’ and ‘living’. Cf. the Kabhalistic ffokhmah and Bid. We have here a possible mistranslation from the Aramaic. ThePa‘eI form of QUM [@im (qayyim)] certainly means ‘standing’. In Mandaic, in the Com- memoration Prayer the words dqaim’a bpagraihun mean ‘who are living (alive) in their bodies’. In this sense the participle means ‘living’; conversely ‘lying down’ and ‘sleeping’ are synonyms for death. ‘ Simon’s Unknowable Cause of the universe and androgynous ‘Father’ creator of the world correspond in many respecta to the Mandaean ‘Great Life’ and Adam Kasia. In the Simonian system, not only is the first Cause infinite hut also, according to Hippolytus. a medial Space filled with ‘air’ (ether) without beginning or end. This corresponds nearly enough to the Mandaean ethw-world and to the ‘all-pervading air’ taken 8s witness in the ‘Epistle of Peter to James’ in H. The authenticity of the latter is denied: hut the tradition is interesting. Another parallel is the Pehlevi deity Vay (see Zurvmr.p. 88), of which Zaehnersays that it became ‘identified with the Void or intermediate space between the realms of light and darkness . . . further idenrified with Space’. THE BAPTIZERS AND THE SECRET ADAM 91 truly gnostic, and habits of reasoning learnt in Greek (Alexan- drian?) academies, mysticism in the dress of philosophy, lie behind Simon’s doubtless sincere interpretation of what he thought the truth. According to Clementine tradition the immediate successor to John the Baptist was another Samaritan, Dositheus, as Simon was in Egypt at the time of the Baptist’s martyrdom. H. 11. xxiv recounts that when Simon returned, the two men quarrelled. Simon’s superiority was proved miraculously and Dositheus ceded his position as head of the sect to Simon. Legend may contain grains of truth and we know from patristic sources that baptizing sects of the Simonian school survived for some time. Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical Hisfmy, IV. xi, names offshoots of the Simonian type: Simon’s immediate successor, the Samaritan Menander (op. cit. III. xv), Saturninus in Antioch, and in Rome Cerdo, all came under this heading. The last-named, according to Eusebius, settled in Rome in the time of ‘Hyginus who held the ninth place in the Apostolic succession’. Contemporary with Cerdo and Valentinus was Marcus, whose sacramental mysteries are described in a slanderous manner by Irenaeus.’ In what appears to have been a hieros gums rite, ‘cups were mixed with wine’.2 Eusebius gives a slightly more moderate account: Some of them [i.e. the Murcosim] construct a bride-chamber and celebrate a mystery with certain invocations on their initiate and say that what they do is a spiritual marriage according to the likeness of the unions above; others bring them to water and baptize them with thisinvocation; ‘To the name ofthe Unknown Father ofthe Universe, to Truth, the mother of all things, to Him who descended into Jesus’, and others invoke Hebrew words in order more fully to amaze the initiate.

Matt. xvii. 10-13, and John i. 21. That divine inspiration arises from an indwelling of the Celestial Adam is a fundamental tenet of the Elkasaite heresy. Simon the Magian, too, looked upon himself as an embodiment of, or as possessed by, the divine ‘Father’, the androgynous Father-and-Mother in One, when he calls himself ‘the Standing (i.e. ‘living’, ‘persisting’) One’. Like the Simonian Adam, the Adam of the Elkasaites appears, as it were, at intervals as a divine intervention, recalling mankiid to its spiritual source, the first spiritual Adam. We hear first of the Elkasaite heresy in Hippolytus (Rejutation of all Heresies, bk. IX, chap. viii, A-N Lihrary,vol. i, p. 345). The eponymous founder of the sect, according to Hippolytus, was the ‘false prophet’ called HAxaoai. By Hippolytus and Fathers of the Church who subsequently wrote about this heretical sect ‘Elkasai‘ was taken to be a man and author of a book. St. Augus- tine described him as ‘the false prophet Elci’ followed by the Sampsaeans and Elkasaites. Epiphanius spelt his name Elxai (“HAfai) and calls the Elkasaites ’Ekaualoi. Origen has for the latter ’EAKauama; and Theodoret talks of “Ehauac as the founder of the sect. Much later, Elkasai reappears as B1- Hasih who, al-Nadim asserts, is regarded by the Mughtasilah as their founder-and the Mughtasilah he identifies with the ‘SHbians of the marshes’.Z Hippolytus, writing of the appearance of the sect of the Elka- ‘ The Messiah expected by first-century Jews was an anointed and crowned king of Israel aceording to T.

(Op. cit., bk. IX, chap. viii, A-N Library, vol. i, p. 345.)’ The book, Hippolytus continues, was revealed by an angel of gigantic proportions with whom was ‘a female’ of equal size. Those converted and obeying the book were to receive remission of sins by baptism. This baptism (op. cit., bk. IX, chap. x, A-N Library, vol. i, p. 348) needed witnesses, which Hippolytus names as ‘heaven, water, holy spirits, angels of prayer, oil, salt and earth’. Here there are parallelisms with the Mandaeans. They too invoke witnesses at baptism: they are pihtu (bread made with salt), manzbuha and the Jordan (i.e. the running water used for drinking and immersion), Habfaba (the personified first day of the week, Sunday) and Zidqu (oblation).z (See CP 21.) I Miscornprehension of another language and a foreign alphabet can be traced here. ‘Serae’ may be, not a town, but a group of Jewish pietists of that name living in Parthia, the Sems (see The Clementine Recognitions, bk. VIII, xlviii (A-N Library, Clark. Edinburgh, 1867), p. Do), and, in spite of Brandt’s doubts (Elchum’, p. 44), ‘Sobiai’ probably stands for $ubba or Sabians, i.e. immersers, baptists. Transliteration of Aramaic into Greek constantly leads patristic writers asmy; some Hebrew letters have no exact equivalent in the Greek alphabet (e.g. 3 and 3). The various methods of transliterating the latter are exemplified in the various spellings of Kuui in Elkasai‘s name, and the first syllable, as is suggested on another page, is also rendered hy various spellings. If I am right in supposing it to have been !’-Y, these are explained. Professor Driver agrees with me that the El would he approximated by the ‘AL (in Arabic), as both mean ‘high’, ‘celestial’ (?v, ‘high one’, can be equated with ??, ‘the high god’). In 0.-Ass.

Driver (editor of the Ugaritic poems), Clark, Edinburgh, 1956, p. 54. Kuoi for ‘secret’, ‘mystic’, ‘hidden’, is a W. Aramaic form. In the GR Jewish names usually end with oi, e.g. ‘niHbai, Miriai, Silai, Salbai, &c. Salt, according to the Drabia d-Yahia(JB text, r66: 9 f.), ‘is the mystery of the soul’.

After a similar mishap, Mandaeans, too, immerse themselves immediately, wearing the rasfa, the white dress which, according to them, they formerly wore continually, lie the Essenes. Moreover, should a Man- daean die from such a cause, a special masipfa called Zihrun Raza Kasia must be celebrated for the soul of the departed which is grievously polluted by such a death. Mandaeans, like Elkasaites (according to the heresiologists), must immerse themselves immediately after cohabitation,pollufio no&, and possession by disease-demons. To return to Hippolytus: And he [Elchasai] asserts that Christ was born a man in the same manner common to all and that he was not for the first time [on earth] born of a virgin but that both previously and frequently again he had been born and would be born: would thus appear and exist under- going alterations of birth and having his soul transferred from body to body. (Op. fit., bk. IX, ix, A-N Library, vol. i, p. 347.) The phrase ‘born of a virgin’ may have been an interpolation, forthe virgin birthwas always denied by Judaeo-Christians, but the rest agrees well with the idea of the periodical return of the ‘true prophet’. Hippolytus mentions in a scornful manner their . . . formulae for those bitten by dogs, possessed by demons and seized by other diseases.’ By the second century, as shown by Hippolytus, the Elka- saite gnosis was sending out its missionaries. In the fourth its conquests were continued. According to Epiphanius, bishop of In H bread and salt are consumed at the meal which follows baptism (H. XIV. i).

Among its converts, he tells us, were Ebionites, Nazarenes, Ossaeans (probably Essenes), Nasaraeans (with a sigma), and Sampsaeans. The Ebionites (ebionim)’ were the Judaeo-Christians who were classed with heretics by the now dominant catholicized Pauline church. The Judaeo-Christians were divided in observance and belief: some continued to cir- cumcize and observe the Sabbath and some not. Some, following the example of James the brother of Jesus,Z were vegetarians and ate no meat. Blood-sacrifice, since the destruction of the Temple, was dead: it had been frowned upon by the Essenes and others before them. Baptizing Jews thought that the sacrament of baptism replaced it. The Ebionites for the most part had settled in Transjordania.

His evidence is valuable as giving a picture of the followers of Jesus soon after his death. Of James he says that Some inquired of him what was ‘the gate of Jesus’ and he replied that he was the Saviour. Owing to this answer, says Hegesippus, some believed that Jesus was the Christ (11. xxiii). He records that in Jerusalem some did not believe either in resurrection ‘or in one who will come to reward each according to his deeds; hut as many a8 believed did so because of James’. Hegesippus says that James wore long hair, unshaven heard, Linen clothing, and was B vegetarian. He did not anoint himself with oil, drank no wine, and did not visit the baths. This has been taken to mean that Jameswas aNazarite, hut had he heen, it is probable that Hegesippus would have said SO.

Epiphanius did not content himself with mere hearsay: he took trouble to find out from converts (he himself was a con- vert from Judaism) the Elkasaite point of view. Their Christ, according to him, was a G6vapis: Some of them, tm, say that Christ is Adam, the first-created (being) . . . others say that he was created before all things, superior to the angels, ruling over all and called Christ.

Elkasaites such as these were probably Ebionites for whom the docetic theory explained the mystery of the shameful death of Jesus. Other Elkasaites were not Christians. The Sampsaeans (Zap- $aioi)* were monotheists but not Christians or Jews or Greeks. Hence the Adam-figure was not the Christian Messiah. They declared the canonical books of the Christians to be falsified and dispensed with the Old Testament. on p. xi”. Philologists and theologians for the most part (e.g. Schoeps, Torrey, and Burkitt) have decided that the form used in Matt. ii. t3 (Nobpoios) could not mean ‘of Nazareth’.

How- ever, he managed to see this book or a page or so of it, for he transcribed from it the following words: xm xm n1-a p+u mm tux I will be your witness on the great Day of Judgement. These words would, to a Mandaean, sound like a quotation from the Ginza (the ‘Book of Adam‘ is its other name). In it there are many references to ‘the great day of Judgement’, ‘the day of Judgement, the Hour of Deliverance’. In one such passage the Great Life addresses Adam: Then spoke the Great First Life to Adam, Head of the Race [of mankind]. ‘0 Adam, rest at ease in thy glory: let the calm of the good come upon thee. Hibd-Ziwa is here, thy brethren the ’uthras are here and the Jordan; it is all here. Here wilt thou dwell, Adam! Thy spouse Hawa is coming hither.

Like the Mandaeans and Ebionites, the Sampsaeans favoured early marriage and thought ill of celibacy. Epiphanius says of both Sampsaeans’ and Ossaeans (Essenes?) that they had fallen away from Judaism and adhered to the Elkasaite heresy. I have mentioned details in which the Elkasaite sects and Mandaean Nqoraeans resemble one another. There is a much deeper ground for thinking that there is a common background and for believing that the Elkasaites were once closely related to our Nqoraeans. The central cult of both is the Heavenly Man, ’ The word ‘Sampsaean’ Epiphanius translated as ‘sunny’.

In the secret scrolls the ‘false prophet’ of the Elkasaites can be recognized as the Nqoraean Adam Kasia-no ‘man’ but Man, Anthropos, the Son of Man, the Son of God; El Kasia.’ In his lower aspect he is the Demiurge, creator of ‘worlds of illusion, seven to his right and seven to his left’. In his higher anddivineaspect heisMankindanointedand crowned, priest and king, an image of divine kingship.

Were the originalNaSoraeans(M) Jews, or Samaritans, or what? Was their original home Judaea, or Samaria or Galilee, or did the cult start amongst Parthian Jews on the great trade route? At what period did the ‘three hundred and sixty tarmidia (disciples) who came forth from the city of Jerusalem’, commemorated in the longer Tab jabia prayer, leave that city? Why should the Nasoraeans(M) hate the Jews so fiercely? Why, if Jews, did they give up circumcision, and when? ’ Epiphanius’s explanation of the first syllable as h, ‘strength‘, ‘power’, has heen accepted by Some scholars with the result that they get ‘secret Power’ from Ekasai, e.g. H.

Chwalsohn (Die Smbier., “01. i, ~p. 116 ff.) connected the Elkasaites with the Mandaeans but did not associate the ‘founder’ of that sect with the Secret Adam, for Mandaean literature in his time was largely unread. He dwelt upon the fame of the Elkasaites as foretellers of the future, a reputation which they shared with the Essenes (see Josephus, The Antiquitier sf fhermr (Whiston, Edinburgh, n.d.), XVII. xiii. 3). The Mandaean pdesthood is famous for the same reason; see the Book qfthe Zodiac (Royal Asiatic Society, London, 1949). THE BAPTIZERS AND THE SECRET ADAM 99 These are grave objections, and satisfactory answers to such questions should be found before the identity of Adam Kasia with Elkasai is proved. The historical background, dim though it is, can help a Iiftle. The Parthian Empire at its height was far flung. During its long and successful appearance on the stage of the civilized world Jewish colonies were to be found in all the larger cities along the great trade routes. Many of them had been established long be- fore: in Babylonia we have records of Jewish banking under Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of the ‘Captivity’ only a minority of Babylonian Jews returned to Palestine, and under the tolerant rule of the Achaemenids and Arsacids the Jews flourished. From one trading centre to another, from India to the Mediterranean, and from far China to the Persian Gulf, Jewish merchants travelled, tarried, and intermarried. For the most part they carried with them a tendency to monotheism or at any rate fidelity to their tribal god Yahweh. Well-to-do colonies sheltered Jewish academies and synagogues, where there was discussion and opportunity to satisfy that intellectual curiosity which has always been characteristic of the Hebrew. Alexandria was a seat of learning and had a large Jewish population. There, Greek thought and Oriental cults met and flourished: the Hermetic treatises which purported to be Egyptian were probably com- posed there and from this centre alone a stream of liberal and intellectual mysticism flowed out into the Mediterranean world of culture. Judaism held its own, but profited by its surround- ings. PhiIo was no exception: others, such men as Aristobulus the philosopher, had preceded him. The age of syncretism had arrived and, as carriers from city to city, Jews must have con- tributed much towards this tolerant attitude toward the religion of others. Dr. R. Ghirshman writes:’ Under the Parthians there was a great expansion of Judaism in Babylonia. In 20 B.C. a small Jewish vassal state was established on the banks of the Euphrates and remained in existence nearly twenty R.

The moral and intellectual life of the Jewish nation with its flourishing schools became centred in this area, in Babylon and the Greek cities, and played a part in the influence exercised by Jewish ideas on Iranian religion. During the great Jewish revolt of the second century A.D. which set all the Roman Orient ablaze, the rebels received aid from the Parthians, a fact which gave rise to the well- known saying: ‘When you see a Parthian charger tied up to a tomb- stone in Palestine, the hour of the Messiah will be near.’ If the iniluence of Parthians and Greeks’ over Judaism re- sulted in a certain fusion of ideas, there was reciprocity: Juda- ism had much to give as well as to take. Palestine was open on every side to foreign influence, yet preserved its individuality; Judaea remained very Jewish. What of Samaria and Galilee? The Samaritans, as Josephus notes sourly more than once, were always glad to claim kinship with the Medes and Parthians near their borders to their own advantage when Jewish fortunes were low (Antiquities, X. ix. 7). Samaritans were usually ready to assist the enemies of the Jews, and though they cherished the Pentateuch they retained religious independence. In constantly close and friendly touch with Media and Parthia on the one hand and with Greek settlements on the other, Graeco-Iranian ideas, and, above all, those of the Magians must have had great in- fluence over many of them. In Samaria, therefore, we have a natural forcing-bed for early gnosticism and it is significant that Simon called ‘the Magian’, Dositheus, and Simon’s successor Menander were all Samaritans-and baptists. What kind of a religion was professed in Media and Parthia during the era of Parthian domination? Dr. Ghirshman (op. cit. p. 268) writes: ‘The Parthians were no more Zoroastrian than were the Achaemenians’, and ‘there is no great certainty what the state religion, if one existed, was’. That there was a fire-cult was probable.

It might be in Galilee that our original Nasoraeans (M) are to be sought and Epipha- nius may be stating a truth when he says that there were ‘Nasa- raeans’ in pre-Christian times, meaning, groups of dissident Jews whose teaching was not revealed to those who might decry its unorthodoxy and who perhaps celebrated ‘mysteries’ to which outsiders were not admitted. It may have been a form of ‘Elka- saitism’, i.e. mysticism centred about the figure of Divine Man. Was John the Baptist connected with these? He left no book behind him, but there are traces of grave differences between his disciples and those of Jesus. It is certain that Simon the Magian was never a Nqoraean (M) although the Divine Man was the centrepiece of his system, and he himself claimed to be a Messiah. Had he been, we might have found his name, like that of John the Baptist, in the Nqoraean Commemoration prayer.’ As remarked earlier in this book, John is never the mouthpiece of Nasoraean doctrine as it appears in the secret scrolls, and John’s figure may have been inserted at a later date, for the name Yuhiu is Arabic not Aramaic. The figure of Adam in Canaan is an ancient one, and is bound to the Canaanite god at a very early time.* He was the son of ‘El, so that it is natural to find him in the ’EI-Kasai gnosis.3 The Nasoraean connexion with Samaritan schools of thought would be enough to account for their detestation of the Jews, ’ Although there is a legendary ‘life’ of John the Baptist in the Harm Gowaita, and he appears in both the Ginza and Drsgia d-Yahia, he is never represented BS an incarnation of Adam as Son of Man, or BS the founder of the religion.

To the true Nqoraean Adam could never be anything but a spiritual figure, an ideal humanity personified in Adakas, the earthly Adam’s guardian, his soul, teacher, ‘the Radiance which came from the Secret Place’, the heavenly High Priest and King, of whom every earthly priest must be the crowned symbol. Hence the idea prevalent in Judaeo-Christian and in some Elka- saite circles that there was reincarnation of the Adam-Christ, if it had ever existed in Nasoraean (M) gnosis, early disappeared, just as it did from Christianity. For Paul, Jesus was ‘the Last AM.2 Amongst the Judaeo-Christians and the Simonians in Rome the idea lingered awhile, but these heretical gnostics dis- appeared after a time. Principles which, according to Epiphanius, were held by some adherents to Elkasaite gnosis, such as circumcision, food taboo, and observance of the Sabbath, do not appear in ‘ References in the Ginza and liturgical prayers show that Nasoraeans (M) associated the word ’El 59Y and Adomi with Judaism. ‘Praise not the sun, whose name is Adonai, whose name is Qadd, whosename ~s’El’El (by 5-y); moreover he hath secret names not revealed in this world‘ (GRr zq: 15 ff.).

Amongst Magian sects described by the scholarly ShahrastPni in his Kitabu-1 Mild wal Nihal was one which he calls the Kaiumartiya, worshippers of Kaiumart (i.e. the Avestan Gayomard or Gayomart, ‘Life-Man’). He says of them: The Kayumartaeans say that Kaiumart was Adam, in the chrono- logies of the Indians and Persians, Kayumart. Under the same heading Majtis, Magians, ShahrastPni men- tions the influence of the Israelites which, he says, extended over Syria and westward beyond it, adding that it spread little to Persian countries (+I 2%). He continues: In the time of Abraham the Friend of God, the Parthians corre- sponded to two classes, one of them being the SHbians [SHbiya] and the other the Hanefites. And the Sibians said, ‘For understanding the most High God, knowledge of and obedience to Him and His commandments and ordinances, a Mediator is necessary, but that Mediator must be a spiritual being and not of corporeal nature. This is so because of the purity of spiritual beings and their undefiled nature and because they are near to the Lord of lords; whereas Corporeality of Flesh resembles us, eating of all that we eat and drinking all that we drink and like us in matter and form.’ The ‘spiritual Mediator’ and ‘Corporeality of Flesh‘ corre- spond to Adakas-Ziwa and to Adam Pagria.

The element which appears in an amazingly conservative form is that of Primordial Man, who, already in Canaanite times, was conceived of as King, Priest, and Son of God. Every Mandaean priest is anointed, crowned, and given the insignia of kingship when he is ordained, for he is the earthly representative of the Heavenly Man: and every baptized person in anticipation of his union (luufu) with the redeemed body of the elect is taken, as it were, into the Body of Adam by a ‘signing’ with water and ‘crowning’ with a myrtle wreath, ceremonies re- peated in his dying hour with the difference that the signing is with oil; for, as a true believer dying in purity, he will become one with the spiritualized humanity called the Secret Adam. There is a unity in this which can be understood only by examining the Mandaean sacraments as symbolic of progres- sion into the life to come and interpreting them by the secret teaching. How did the severance between exoteric and esoteric teaching arise? The answer cannot be merely that ‘mysteries’ are always protected by secrecy in gnostic sects and mystery religions. There is a definite cleavage which must be explained. I fear that nothing but speculation can provide an answer. As we know, the Hmun Guwuita, which cannot be altogether dis- missed as legend, relates how the NaSoraeans fled from Jewish persecution to Media and Harran, and, later on, under the pro- tection of Parthian rulers, into Lower Babylonia. What did these immigrants find on arrival? Ritual immersion was ancient indeed in Babylonia, and during Iranian domination shrines had been built on the Tigris and Euphrates to the water-goddess Anahita,’ who under her Semitic name Nanai or Nanaia is still invoked in Mandaean exorcism I ‘Artaxerxes I1 set up images of Anahits in Babylon, Susa, Ecbatana and established the cult in Persia, Bactria, Damascus, and Sardis’ (A. D. Nock, Conversion, p. 355). THE BAPTIZERS AND THE SECRET ADAM 105 books.’ Did these Nqoraeans from Harran and Media find on the rivers of southern Mesopotamia and KhiizistHn a baptizing sect so similar to their own that they incorporated and domina- ted it?Z Guesswork should have no place in serious research, but we have yet to account for the curious fact that parts of books to which laymen have access are at variance with the secret doctrine, that Mandaeans as laymen are graded beneath the hereditary priesthood, and that even within that priesthood only a select few are admitted into the arcana of Neirutha, into the mystery of the Hidden Adam. To sum up this mystery once again: the Hidden or Secret Adam is an emanation from the Great Life which appeared in the shape of Man and of material man who appeared later on earth. In his highest aspect, Adakas-Ziwa, the mystic Light- Adam, he is re-created at every mmiqtu, for he represents sub- limated humanity, a state into which the souls of the departed who no longer ‘stand in the body’ pass after they have been pro- vided by his re-creation with a new and spiritual body. In and by him they pass upward into ‘worlds of light’ and eventually, with him, into the final union with the Absolute which is above human imagination. Although as ‘soul’ he exists in every man, he is, as we have ’ Seepartiiiof E. S. Drower,‘AMandseanBookofBlackMagic’,r.R.A.S., 1943, p. 159, and unpublished magical texts. In the long lists of copyists in colophons of the older sacred books we find at the end of most of them ‘Ramuia son of ‘Qaimat’, ‘Bainai son of Haiuna’, and ‘Zzai d-Gawazta’, men credited with the collection and editing of Mandaean manuscripts early in the Moslem era. They lived at al-Tih, which was then the seat of a Mandaean ethnarch (r3amn). This town. now non-existent, was situated between Wasit and Khozistb. YSqfit ibn ‘AbdallHh al-Hamawi described it in his Mu‘qYarn d-BuUZn as ‘one of the residences of Seth son of Adam’. Until they embraced Islam the inhabitants ‘never ceased to confess the religion of Seth’ and were of the $ihian faith. By describing them as ‘Nahapeans who spoke Nahataean’ he certainly indicated that they were of foreign descent who spoke an Aramaic not of the Bahy- lonian type, for in the twelfth century in which he wrote there must still have remained many who still spoke Aramaic: in fact, there are still pockets of Aramaic-speaking people in ‘Iraq. If, as Epiphanius stated, the Elkssaite doctrines spread into Nabapea, the story in the Harm Gauroila that Nasoraeans emigrated under Parthian protection into the marshes of Bahy- lonia from the north-east becomes very credible (see Mu‘njam d-Buldrin, vol. vi, p. 76 (Cairo, 1906))."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"106 THE BAPTIZERS AND THE SECRET ADAM shown by some extracts from the secret scrolls, recognized as king and priest. When the celebrant, breaking off fragments from the loaves before him which represent human souls, adds these to the pihtu he holds to represent the newly departed, he does this to symbolize Luufu, that is, unity in this world and the next. When he crowns thepihtu with a myrtle wreath and anoints it with mSu, he indicates that the Secret Adam is a Messiah in the ancient sense of the word, a crowned and anointed king. He is Humanity fulfilled, ruler and victor. EPILOGUE RITUAL observances which concern cleanness and uncleanness described in the OT and those which appear in the later Jewish Sulhun ‘Arukh should be compared with similar and equally strict rules governing ritual purity in the Mandaean book Mhifu uasutu and the Parsi regulations enumerated by Modi in his book on Parsi customs and usages.‘ The NaSoraean observances are close to the latter, although the methods of cleansing ritual faults and impurities differ widely. Like the Parsi priest a Mandaean must avoid contact with deadmatter, andshouldsuch a pollution occur it must be cleansed hy baptism and musiqtas. Contact with any unclean thing or person debars aMandaean priest from taking part in any rite: fear of touching a corpse is the reason why a Mandaean priest is forbidden to open his door to a dying person. This is one reason why an official go-between must be present at all rites. He acts as it were as a bridge between the laity and priests, and shields them from danger of pollution. I refer to the dgundu, whose office in some ways resembles that of a Christian deacon. At a baptism the dgundu takes no part in the rite itself except at the beginning and end when he exchanges the ritual hand- clasp with the priest which expresses a form of oath or covenant. This ceremony takes place at every rite, and each time afresh the afgundu goes through a preliminary purification and consecra- tion. The words of initiation which begin ‘Seek and find, speak and be heard‘ arc dictated to him. In the muriqtu the dgutzdu is allowed to enter the cult-hut into which he takes the ‘outer phial’ when it is required. He must be of priestly birth and priests have usually had experience as dgandas before they are ‘crowned’. In spite of all this care to preserve ritual ‘cleanness’, of laws rigorously observed for centuries, this very faithfulness to Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Curtoms of the Pmreer. i"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"I08 EPILOGUE regulations of ritual purity is bringing doom upon the priestly caste. During an outbreak of cholera or plague during the early nineteenth century a great number of Mandaeans in Mesopota- mia and Persia died. Constantly drinking infected water, and entering it with sick and dying persons, the entire priesthood perished. Not a single priest escaped. There was no one to baptize, to perform marriages, or to celebrate the last rites for the dying. Colophons to manuscripts copied at that time record that in desperation and with tears and misgivings a small group of survivors of priestly families who had formerly assisted as uigandas, and thus knew most of the baptismal prayers by heart, assembled and agreed to consecrate one of their number as priest, performing the rites of consecration as best they could. Aided by anxious perusal of ritual scrolls, they set about the task of rebuilding the priesthood. The first new priest, therefore, had no qualified instructor and no proper initiation. A new hierarchy was painfully built up. The sect, however, had suffered a blow from which it has never recovered and modern education and the impact of a Westernized, mechanized world is quickly completing the process of dissolution. In my own lifetime I have watched the approach of the end. In spite of one or two devoted priests, at baptismal feasts nowadays only the very young and very old come forward for baptism. The sons of gun&a and priests enter lay professions and not the priesthood and, like the Mandaean laity who long ago ignored the old taboo, they cut their hair and dress lie their neighbours. At birth, marriage, and death a handful of priests still func- tion, but they are nearly all aged men for whom there will be no replacement when they die. Yet, so strong is tradition, that it is liely that immersion and certain rites and customs will persist in some form or other even after the religion itself is dead. How strong such traditions are was brought home to me when, a few years ago, I returned to visit ‘Iraq. Whilst myself a patient in an American mission hospital at ‘Amarah, I was told that a Mandaean lad had been brought in EPILOGUE 109 from a marsh village. He was desperately ill: long-neglected bilharzia had reduced him to the point of death. The doctor ex- amined him and told his father that the boy, his only son, was so ill that recovery was doubtful, but that they would accept him as a patient and give him treatment. The father realized that the balance was tipped towards death and wished to take the boy back with him, but the medical staff dissuaded him. The next morning at breakfast I was told that the father had returned before dawn with a priest and a man who have must been an dganda. In spite of protests by the night-nurse, the sick boy had been dressed in his rasta and carried down into the garden which is only a few yards from the river Tigris. There, they emptied three buckets of river water one after the other over the boy, who died there and then of the shock. It fell to me to explain when the father and his friends asked to be allowed ‘to build something’ outside the door through which the corpse was to be taken out that morning for burial. The ‘something’ was the mandelta, a low row of three reed bundles over which the four bier-bearers must step and which, they said, must remain in situ for three days. Permission was eventually granted on an understanding that the hospital could not be responsible if hostile spectators or. callers injured or removed the bundles. In reply, the Mandaeans said that they would guard it day and night. Before noon, bier-carriers wearing white religious dress arrived: the corpse was carried out over the mandelta which the priest sealed with his iron ring (see MMII, pp. 181-4). An old man sat and lay by the reed bundles and kept watch until the third day after death, when they were removed. The family was satisfied. The rites for the dying, the ‘Letter’, had, thanks to the presence of a priest in the town and the fore- sight of the father, taken place in time and no Ahuba &Mania‘ would be necessary to redeem the boy’s soul that year at Panja, (Parwanaiia) the ‘five days of light’ during which all the dead are remembered.

APPENDIX IN a scholarly tome, Die Ssubie~ und das Ssabim, published in 1856, the Russian scholar Dr. D. Chwolsohn assembled material gathered from Arab, Persian, and Jewish writings of the early Moslem epoch about the Ssbians. Quoting a story told by the Christian Abii-Ymuf Absaa’ al-Qgti’i, he deduced that pagans who still worshipped gods of classical antiquity adopted the name as a cloak in order to acquire the protection promised by the Qur’a to Jews, Christians, and S8bians as ‘people of a book‘, for the Caliph Mamiln had told them that unless they chose to profess one of the tolerated religions they must become Moslems or die. Theerroneousidentificationof these pretendedand pagan ‘Sgbians’ with the real Ssbians, who were according to Chwolsohn, ‘low, ignorant Mandaeans of the marshes of ‘IrHq’, is the main theme of his erudite book. How could those poor ignorant Mandaeans be con- fused with the learned and famous Harranian pseudo-Slbians who did so much to bring Western philosophy, medicine, and astronomy to Moslems in Baghdad during the ninth, tenth, and early eleventh centuries? Nevertheless, these men did not become Moslems but continued to call themselves Sibians. According to Shahrastai’s account of them in the Kitib-al-Millal and that of Al-Kindi and other writers, the Harranian Slbians satisfied inquiry as to the nature of their religion with answers based upon Neo-Platonic philosophy rather than theology. Their references to Biblical figures such as Noah, Seth, and And were, Chwolsohn suggested, thrown in as a sop to Moslem hearers, and their assertions that theirs was the religion of Agathodaemon and Hermes proved both their paganism and their learning. That such brilliant scholars as the Sibian Thgbit-ibn-Qurrah and his school, who were responsible for many translations into Arabic from the Greek, were acquainted with Stoic, Hermetic, and Platonic literature is of course probable;‘ nevertheless they may have been no pseudo-Sghians but genuine members of that sect, Nqoraeans, who ’ The Oxford scholar Walter Scott, in his Xenneiica (Clarendon Press, 1934)) followed Chwolsohn’s argument closely, and took Har-an SShian references to Hermes, Thoth, and so on as so much evidence that they were steeped in knowledge of Greek and Latin writings assigned to ‘Hermes Trismegistus’, the thrice-holy Hennes."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"IIZ APPENDIX practised baptism and were faithful to the religion into which they had been born. In this case they would probably have been of the priestly clan which today still provides the intelligentsia. Such men, probably not priests but yalujia (literates), would be well-read in the sacred literature, and possibly might have helped their fathers to copy the manuscripts. The Hermetic writings have so much which corresponds closely to religious conceptions familiar to them in NaSoraean gnosis that they would readily have identified the Hermes of the Poimrmdres as their own Manda-d-Hiia or Mara-d-Rabutha. Such passages as that in Poinuzndres, which speak of the bisexual vok, ‘Cxistant comme vie et lumikre’ in the translation of Festugikre and Nock,’ would be easily recognized by them as the mystical Palm- tree and Wellspring, or perhaps as the bisexual Adam who was both of these according to the secret teaching. It is hardly to be wondered at if Harranian Sibians gave names such as ‘Hermes’ or ‘Agathodaemon’z to Moslem inquirers, instead of sacred names which were never to be uttered in the presence of unbelievers. Some Harranian S8hians appear to have truly been pagans and the term ‘S8bian’. as Chwolsohn showed, was applied later indiscrimin- ately to any non-Moslem, non-Jew, or non-Christian, in the easy, inexact fashion of thosewho despised such religions and thought them unworthy of serious consideration. In the Fihrirt (see Chwolsohn, op. cit., p. IS) we are told that in Harran there was intermarriage ‘ ‘Or le Noiis Dieu, 6tant mHle et femelle, existant comme vie et lumitre, enfenta d’une parole un second Noils demiurge qui, &tam dieu du feu et du sofie, fagonna des Gouverneurs, sept en nombre, lesquels enveloppent dans leurs cerdes le monde sensible; et leur gouvernement se nomme la Destinee’ (A. D. Nock and A. J. Festugikre, Hermar Trirmdgiste (Paris, 1945). vol. i, Trait&, I. ix). a There is no mention of Hermes or Agathodaemon in Mandaean books. The Harmnians seem to have quoted Hermes and ‘Arzni’ as founders of their religion! They probably referred to Seth and End (Sitil and Anus in Mandaic), for Shahrasemi identified Agathodaemon with the former and Heme with the latter. M-Qifti calls Agathodaemon the ‘teacher’ of Herme$. Seth or Setheus figures in the Coptic gnostic texts. The Sethians were amcked by Christian heresiologists (e.g. Hippolytus in his Refutation of all Hnerier, hk. x, chap. vii). According to M. Jean Doresse’s survey of the Khenoboskion gnostic books (Ler Livres secrets des gnortipues d’Eerpte) a number of the manuscripts found there belong to the Sethian group. In Koptirch-Gnostische Schriftnz, ?I. I (see p. xii, n. 1) ‘Setheus’ figures in several obscure passages, e.g. as lord of the Pleroma’ (363: 32), ‘crowned dcmiurgc’ (350: 7). &c. €icmes (op. cit. 234: 30 f.) is said by ‘Jesus’ to be the third great archon.

Let us consider the names of some Harranian Sibians who became famous under the Abbasids as scholars, physicians, and SO on. We find the name Abu’l-Fath-al-Mand&i (i.e. ‘the Mandaean’), and Ibrihim-ibn-Zah~n-ibn-I;Iabb~-al-Harr8ni, whose son was another Zuhrtin, and Hil~l-ibn-Ibrlhim-ibn-Zuhrti~-abu’l-Husain-al-S~bi- al-Harrini. To this very day ‘Zahmn’ is the name most favoured by Mandaeans: I know many so called and it is a name reserved for them. Other names favoured by them are %ti1 (Seth), Anus (Enos), and Hirmis or Hirmiz (Hermes or Ohrmazd?’), although the last is a ‘worldly’ name, not a malwaSa (baptismal name). It is hardly surprising that the name ‘Hirmiz’ (which by Assyrians is used in the form ‘Hormuz’ and ‘Hormuzd’2) on account of its Magian connexion should be shunned as a religious name. It never appears in colophons. The Mandaeans were settled round the Tigris, Euphrates, and Karun rivers, with headquarters at Tib. Their neigh- bours before the arrival of the Moslems were Magians, and although we find Persian names such as ‘Shahpiir’ in colophons, the name ‘Hirmiz’ could not, on grounds of orthodoxy, be used for baptism.’ For a similar reason, perhaps, no prayer or hymn in the Mandaean liturgy is addressed to Fire, although a fire is essential for every Mandaean rite, including baptism. Its purity is carefully preserved, fuel receives triple immersion, incense is cast into it, and the sacred bread baked on it. Moreover, in AT$ it is said that ‘Without fire no baptisnr can ascend to the House of Life.’ To exalt it unduly, however, might have beenunwise: fire-temples and Magian priests were close at hand.’ ’ Although the work of several authors, the Hermetic writings shelter under the name of Hemes. Greek syncretists, because the Emtian god Thoth was the scribe of the gods, found his equivalent in their own god Hemes, that aerial immortal who conducted departed spirits to the next world and spoke to mortals in dreams. This fictitious Hermes: could he have been R syncretistic corruption of the Pehlevi Ohrmuzd, the deified principle of good, the Zoroastrian Ahura-Mazda? If so, it was by route of Jewish- Alexandrian gnosticism in close touch with Galilaean and Samaritan circles. 1 Yet the Mandaean genius of baptism is the Persian Bihrsm (seep. 65)C I suggest that he became attached to the baptism-cult before the settlement in southern Persia and Mesopotamia, when Jewish gnostics were in close touch with Magian mystics in the first century, in the Wept. 1 Cf. the omission of fire in the list of witnesses necessary at an Elkasaite immersion, which, according to Hippolycus, were sky, water, holy spirits, the angel of prayer, oil, salt, and earth.
