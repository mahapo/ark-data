Mark, my boyfriend, had come back to our apart-ment and asked whether I wanted to go to Iran the next day. We had an offer to drivea car from Amsterdam to Tehran for an Iranian businessman. Istanbul would be justmidway. After a late evening meeting with the businessman and his family—they woulddrive their other car the same route—I agreed to go. I was on a Norwegian-Dutch fellow-ship in the Netherlands, and I grasped the chance to go to Iran because I wanted tomeet Mandaeans in the Persian Gulf area. Since the late 1960s, I had studied Mandaeism.Now, it was late September 1973.A fourteen-day-long, strange, and wonderful journey began. While we were in Yugo-slavia, the war started between Israel and Egypt. For a day and a half, on the TurkishAnatolian high plains, continuously overtaken by Bulgarian cheese trucks spewing high-lead gasoline fumes, we contemplated Mount Ararat, in and out of thunderstorms, aserene 17,000-foot pyramid at the end of a long mountain range. At Dogubayazit, weentered Iran. The landscape of Iranian Azerbajan is impressed in my mind: dramaticbrown mountains with green, steep slopes dotted by tiny sheep and shepherds; thencame flatter deserts and haughty-looking camels.In Tehran we stayed six days, spending much time trying to find information aboutthe Mandaeans in the Gulf. No one seemed to know much. Finally, one official said,“Why don’t you just go?” Indeed. The political situation down there had eased; be-cause of the war, Iran and Iraq had established diplomatic relations so that the Iraqisoldiers could be ready on the western frontier in case Egypt needed help.We took as our guide and translator a contact, Hawa, an Iranian professor of En-glish in Tehran. The three of us boarded an evening plane to Abadan, Khuzistan. Inthe air, I briefed Hawa on Mandaeism, of which she knew nothing. In Abadan, an oilcenter, a couple of tall Texans in large hats were among the few guests in the hotel’slavish dining room, where a huge fish, carved out of yellow butter, swung its tail abovea frozen, green waterfall. We ate excellent food and chatted with the cook, who told ushe had been a chef in Copenhagen and would soon be headed for Tokyo."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viiiPrefaceThe next day I watched a man struggle with his goat in the place where taxi ridescould be negotiated. Hawa fixed us up with a driver who said he would take us to thechurch of the Subbi, the Mandaeans. I became suspicious, for the Mandaeans do nothave “churches.” It was a sad sight, a small, white painted Roman Catholic chapel, butboarded-up and abandoned. Try again.At first, I did not think that the silversmith, Shaker Feyzi, was a Mandaean, for hehad no beard. His little shop was not much more than a cavity in a wall. A group ofblack-clad women carried handfuls of heavy silver ankle bangles to Mr. Feyzi. Theyhaggled, he bought, and later I purchased a bracelet from him. He was about fifty andvery friendly, and we conversed and met his family. Mr. Feyzi stressed that he was anIranian, and the requisite picture of the Shah and his family, Shah Reza Mohammad,the last of the Pahlavis, hung on the wall. “He is my Shah,” said Mr. Feyzi, inviting nofurther inquiries on that point. We had already learned that any business that did notsport such a picture would be closed. We had also learned to approach anything resem-bling a political question with extreme care. The Savak, the Shah’s secret police, couldbe anywhere.“Come back in four months, at Panja,” said Mr. Feyzi, “then we go in the river.”He was referring to the intercalary feast at New Year’s, when many Mandaeans arebaptized. Now, only two families were left in Abadan, he told us, but there were manymore earlier. Where had he learned English? From English-speaking soldiers duringthe Second World War, and later from Americans in the oil trade, who came to buysilver from him.In neighboring Khorramshahr, the old Muhammerah, we met another, older smith,a goldsmith who gave his name as Aran. Other goldsmiths advised us to go to Ahwaz,the capital of the province. Soon we moved swiftly through the flat desert, leaving be-hind the junklike sailboats that seemed to float in the shimmering air above the water-way, the Shatt al-Arab. Patches of blooming roses and rows of tall date palms flew by,while the human-sized dust devils, the miniature dust storms, whirled like dancers inthe distance. A mythological landscape.In a large, prosperous-looking goldsmith shop in Ahwaz, we were first greeted withreasonable suspicion because we used the “inside” term, Mandaean, not Subbi. This showedthat we knew something; the question was what? and why? I explained, via Hawa, andthey soon relaxed and showed us a Mandaean calendar, and we admired the jewelry. Weshould visit their priest, they suggested. Could we do that? Sure, why not?We entered the enclosed courtyard of the house of Sheikh Abdullah Khaffagi, thehead of Mandaeans of Iran. I spotted cows tethered off to one side. A strikingly beau-tiful woman, veil-less, with high cheekbones, blue eyes, and dark blonde hair, cameacross the courtyard and smiled at us. Enchanted by her, Hawa paid her a compliment,laughed and clapped her hands. We were led up the stairs by a young man, one of thepriest’s grandsons, as I recall. He warned us not to touch the old man, who must re-main pure. Glasses of Coca-Cola were brought, and we sat down to wait in the upstairsroom. Sheikh Abdullah appeared in the doorway, with a slight smile and twinklingkeen blue eyes. He was about ninety-five, bent over approximately the same number ofdegrees, white bearded, clad entirely in white, with white cloth slippers (no animal hidemust touch him). Living separately from his family, he cooked his own food. Now wesmiled and bowed, but we did not stretch out our hands to him."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PrefaceixThe sheikh sat down on a cushion on the floor, his covered knees almost up to hisears. We conversed for an hour, he showed us letters from European scholars (in Mandaic)and told us that he had met Lady Drower many times and had visited Professor RudolfMacuch in Tehran.1 I let him know that I had met Lady Drower once, a few years ear-lier, when she was ninety-one, less than a year before she passed away.The priest fetched several Mandaean books and scrolls to show us, all in their indi-vidual white cloth bags. He also gave me a paper copy of the imprint on the Mandaeanskandola, the ritual iron ring with an iron chain. This is used to seal newborn babies ontheir navels, and it also seals graves. Sheikh Abdullah showed us his ring and explainedthat the four animals depicted on the seal—the lion, the wasp, the scorpion, and theencircling snake—were “the elements of life.”Then he began to tug at something under his cushion. We helped him pull out alarge cloth bag, like the others, but this one was heavy as a rock. It was an archetypalbook, The Book of John, made entirely of lead, inscribed with stylus on lead pages boundtogether like a regular book. No wonder it was heavy. Its edges were frayed and worn.We leafed through it reverently. C. G. Jung might have fantasized about a tome likethis. There is probably not its like in the world. Sheikh Abdullah told us that the bookwas 2,053 years old and written by John the Baptist himself. There and then, it seemeda likely view.Cosmological and mythological topics came up. What will happen to us at the endof the world? we asked. There we sat—Hawa, a secular Iranian with a Sufi father; Mark,an American Jew; me, a Norwegian apostate Lutheran—all somehow representing tradi-tional neighbors and enemies of the Mandaeans. Perhaps it had been frivolous to ask.Sheikh Abdullah avoided answering us directly, saying he did not know. But, showingbetter diplomacy and taste than we did, he might just as well have been being polite. Inany case, the Mandaeans will go to the Lightworld, the heavenly world. Paradise liesbeyond the gate at the North Pole, ours is just one of 365 universes, and the earth is flatand stands still. And it will soon end. Such were the sheikh’s words.We thanked him, took farewell, and, with heads reeling, descended the stairs to theworld still there."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsIt is more than thirty years since I began studying the Mandaean religion, and for thepast decade my contacts with Mandaeans worldwide have increased dramatically. Thoughoriginally a “desk scholar,” I have in recent years been able to use my knowledge of thereligion in a more immediately practical context: as an expert witness for Iraqi and IranianMandaeans seeking asylum on political and religious grounds. Therefore, my study ofMandaeism and my close relationship with its people cannot be separated. A recent,illustrative example is the conference on Mandaeism, the first of its kind, that took placeunder the sponsorship of the ARAM Society for Syro-Mesopotamian Studies, at HarvardUniversity in June 1999. At this event, Mandaeans by far outnumbered scholars, andthanks to the presence of Mandaean priests, the traditional Mandaean baptism (maƒbuta),was performed in the Charles River in Allston, Massachusetts. The story of this eventdoes not form a part of this book, however; neither does my ongoing legal work onbehalf of Mandaeans or the numerous post-1996 interactions, visits, and celebrationswith them.Instead, the contents of the book reflect large segments of my research efforts fromthe beginnings of my doctoral studies in the United States in 1975 to my (second) tripto Iran in 1996. Having concluded my studies in the history of religions in Norway in1973, I wanted to pursue a Ph.D. degree in the United States on the topic of theMandaean female mythological figure Ruha. It is therefore with pleasure that I thankthe University of Chicago Divinity School’s History of Religions program for admittingme into its doctoral program in 1975, despite the school’s lack of a specialist in Mandaicstudies. Risking a chance on an unknown European with a firm idea of her dissertationtopic, my Ph.D. committee, consisting of Jonathan Z. Smith, Robert M. Grant, and thelate Arthur Vööbus, supported my esoteric project. I wish to express my special indebt-edness to Jonathan Z. Smith for his courageous open-mindedness and his continuedinterest in my work.Countless others have been helpful along the way, not the least scholarly organiza-tions and other forums under whose auspices I have been able to present my research,chiefly among them the American Academy of Religion, the Society of Biblical Litera-ture, and the American Oriental Society.

Central religious terms such asyardna1 (running water), kušta (truth), and manda (knowledge) point decidedly towardthe religion’s western origins there. Exactly when the Mandaeans emigrate from theJordan valley to the rivers and marshes of present-day southern Iraq and southwest Iran(Khuzistan) is still subject to debate. Discernible from the second century C.E. on, theMandaeans perhaps leave their western habitat in the first-century migration, as RudolfMacuch argues,2 though others, such as Kurt Rudolph, still considers the third centuryto be more likely.3 Three (of four) Parthian kings named Artaban, who span three cen-turies, appear as candidates for the role of protector of the Mandaeans eager to leave theJordan/Palestine area. Whatever the case may be, the Mandaeans arrive during earlyChristian times into Iraq and Iran, probably incrementally and via the Harran area.Early on, the religion clearly experiences more or less hostile contacts with variousforms of Christianity and becomes acquainted with Babylonian remnants, Zoroastrian-ism, Manichaeism, and other religions. Parts of Manichaean hymnic literature are bor-rowed and translated from Mandaean poetry.4 From the seventh century onward,Mandaeism persists under Islamic rulers. A complete portrait of Mandaean historythrough the centuries is impossible to acquire, but glimpses appear here and there.Mythological traditions contain grains of history, as in the emigration legend HaranGawaita, which mentions an Arsacid king Artabanus—but does not specify whichArtabanus—as the protector of the persecuted Mandaeans leaving their western habitatfor the east. If the emigration takes place in the first half of the first century, as Macuchholds, one must assume that Mandaeism already existed in some original form. Aloneamong scholars, Rudolph has drawn attention to a number of links between featuresfound in Mandaeism and in the Coptic Gnostic Nag Hammadi documents.5 This areaof scholarship urgently awaits further investigation. Given Mandaeism’s affinities withother forms of Gnosticism, one might be able to combine research in the earliest data"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4Introductionand strata of Mandaeism with those of other Gnostic sources. This would be crucial forthe aim of obtaining a clearer historical picture of Gnosticism’s beginnings.According to Haran Gawaita, the Mandaeans know of the destruction of Jerusalemand its Temple in 69–70 C.E. However, according to the text, they do not emigrate as aresult of this calamity. In Mandaean eyes, the punishment of the Jews is deserved, butthe Mandaeans have another consideration: they abandon Adonai after Mary (Miriai)becomes pregnant by witchcraft, or by someone other than her husband.6 Miriai, theJewess turned Mandaean, is a heroine—as I will explore in chapter 5—though her sonJesus swerves from his true, Mandaean heritage. Historically and mythologically, it issignificant that, according to Haran Gawaita, Mandaeans consider themselves formerJews. In this context it is worth mentioning that the language of the Babylonian Tal-mud is quite close to classical Mandaic.Macuch insists that the Mandaeans must have arrived via northern Babylonia andMedia into Khuzistan already in the second century, and that the religion was fullydeveloped with texts and rituals at this time. As noted, technical terms, including majorcultic ones, point westward to the Jordan area, though strong secondary Babylonianand Persian influences on Mandaeism soon become notable. But the idea that Mandaeismis of Babylonian origin, as Edwin Yamauchi holds, is vociferously opposed by Macuch.7Since 1987, I have been researching parts of Mandaean history by studying andcomparing accessible Mandaean colophons, which are lists of scribes appended to nearlyall Mandaean documents. At present, my findings show that the earliest attested, namedhistorical person in Mandaeism is the woman Šlama, daughter of Qidra (cooking pot).This woman, named in relation to her mother and/or initiator into priesthood, is theearliest recorded Mandaean copyist of the text called the Left Ginza. The Mandaeanholy book, Ginza (treasure), is separated into a right (GR) and a left (GL) part.8 GL,much of it in poetic form, deals largely with the soul’s ascent to the Lightworld, andthis section of the Ginza belongs among the religion’s most ancient textual material.Šlama may be dated to approximately 200, for she appears several generations beforethe famous early copyist Zazai of Gawazta, who flourished in the 270s. One may notethat Zazai belongs to the decade of Mani’s death.9Whether the Aramaic-speaking people in Elymais, near Susa, may have been Mandaeansis impossible to know, but the Aramaic inscriptions from Tang-i-Sarwak, Khuzistan,stem from the second century and resemble Mandaean letters. Macuch thinks that theMandaean letters precede the Elymaic ones.10Under Persian rule, during the time of the later Arsacids, the Mandaeans evidentlyenjoy royal protection. This situation changes as the Sasanid ruler Bahram I comes topower in 273. Mani is executed at the beginning of his reign, as the influential and zeal-ous Zoroastrian high priest Karter continues to suppress adherents of non-Zoroastrianreligions, such as Mandaeans, Manichaeans, Jews, Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists.During these dangerous years, one might surmise a consolidation of Mandaean litera-ture in an attempt to rescue and codify the religion. Zazai’s extensive copyist activitiestestify to this.The persecutions instigated by Karter do not quench Mandaeism, however. Exceptfor a few copyists’ names in the Mandaean colophons, the religion seems to fade fromrecorded history for centuries. But a particular form of literature emerges, perhaps asearly as the third to seventh centuries: the inscribed, so-called magical bowls, and also"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction5lead strips. Firm historical evidence comes from scribal information in the Mandaeanliturgies, which state that in 639–40, at the beginning of the Muslim expansion, theMandaean “head of the people” and “head of the age,” Anuš, son of Danqa, appearswith a delegation of Mandaeans before Muslim authorities.11 Showing the Muslims theholy Ginza and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be John the Baptist—whowas well regarded by Muslims—the Mandaeans ask for protection. They know that thetwo criteria of a holy book and a prophet are essential for acknowledgment as a “Peopleof the Book” (ahl al-kitab), that is, a legal minority religion, and they appeal to this.The Mandaeans appear to succeed, for the religion flourishes, with intense scribalactivity. Mandaean texts are collected, compared, and consolidated as conscientious leadersamong the priestly copyists exert themselves to weed out local variations in ritual texts.This is a time of creating canons. Famous copyists such as Ramuia, son of \u0001Qaimat, areactive in the mid–seventh century and the woman priest Haiuna, daughter of Yahia,somewhat later. The town Tib, in Wasit, Iraq, emerges as one of the great Mandaeanscribal centers.In 831, the Calif al-Mamun, on his way to wage war in Turkey, comes across theplanet-worshiping Harranian Sabeans and presents them with the choice of becomingMuslims or facing death. Much has been written about the possible connections be-tween the Harranian Sabeans—Neoplatonist “pagan” astrologers and scientists in thetown of Harran (now in far southern Turkey)—and the Mandaeans.12 Still known todayas “Sabeans” (“dippers,” “dyers,” “baptizers,” “converts”) by their Muslim neighbors,the Mandaeans carry a double name, one used externally, the other internally. Certainexchanges between the two kinds of Sabeism did occur, though the religions are, atbest, only distant relatives. But the incidence in Harran shows that in the ninth cen-tury, minority religions remained under scrutiny and that Sabeism was a fluid term. Farsouth of Harranian territory, Mandaeism remains active in that century, with the lumi-nary copyist \u0001Qaiam, son of Zindana.During 932–934, the status of the Mandaeans becomes an issue for the AbbasidCalif al-Qahir Billah. He asks the Shafi\u0001i scholar al-Istakari about the Sabeans (i.e.,Mandaeans) of Wasit, in southeast Iraq. This suggests that their protected minority(dhimmi) position has become uncertain. To avoid further investigation by the authori-ties, the Mandaeans pay a bribe of 50,000 dinars and are left alone. Even in the time ofthe scholar Ibn-Fuwati, who lives approximately 1300 and who records this story, theMandaeans do not pay the poll tax. So, they successfully bypass the laws pertaining toofficially recognized minority religions.13 This feat testifies to the Mandaeans’ talent forshrewd political adjustment. Of course, had times been different, they might have beenpersecuted, not tolerated.Around the year 1200, the geographer Yaqut states that Tib, the Mandaean scribalcenter of centuries past, is inhabited by Nabateans, who speak Nabatean and are Sabeans.They consider themselves to be descendants of Seth, son of Adam.14 There can be littledoubt that these are Mandaeans, for we do not know of others settled there at that timewho considered themselves Seth descendants.In the mid–sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries begin to encounter Mandaeans,whom they mistakenly designate as “Christians of St. John,” and during the next fewcenturies European religious officials, travelers, adventurers, and representatives of en-terprises such as the East India Company become acquainted with Mandaeans as well."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6IntroductionAn interesting report, based on archival work on this time period, can be found inEdmondo Lupieri’s book.15Tacked onto the tarik (postscript to a colophon) of a Mandaean exorcism written in1782 is a much older tarik, from approximately 1480.16 In it, the Mandaean copyistYuhana Šitlan tells of sufferings and persecutions. At the time of the writing of theexorcism, the Mandaeans under Qajar rule in the 1780s in Iran also are experiencinggreat hardships.17 About fifty years later, the Mandaeans are threatened by completeextinction by the great cholera epidemic of 1831—the so-called Plague of Šuštar—in whichhalf of the inhabitants of that city die. Mandaeism is rescued solely because of the great,heroic restoring efforts of a few learned laymen (yalufas). The entire priesthood hasperished. One of the surviving sons of a priest tells heartrending stories of the cholera’saftermath. His name is Yahia Bihram, and he is one of the yalufas who becomes a priestin 1831.18Having survived the epidemic, Mandaeans such as Yahia Bihram may again haveseen concerted attacks against the religion in the 1870s.19 According to oral informa-tion (some of which is attested in colophon postscripts I have not yet researched suffi-ciently), one of Nasruddin Shah’s local representatives in Šuštar, Khuzistan, is respon-sible for a massacre on the Mandaeans. This happens against the will of the Shah, whoasks his representative to desist, and the Shah remains a good ruler in Mandaean eyes,even today. Nevertheless, many Mandaeans die, and those who are able to flee knowthat their fellow religionists have been thrown into wells and drowned. A calculated,cruel death for baptists! In April 1996, I stood with several Mandaeans on the tradi-tional spot of the Šuštar massacre as Sheikh Jabbar, the leader of the Mandaeans inAhwaz, prayed for their dead.20Like others, Mandaeans suffered during two recent wars and their aftermath: theIran-Iraq war of 1980–88 and the Gulf War of 1991. Partly as a result of these conflicts,the majority of Mandaeans now living in emigration left their homelands only veryrecently. Their numbers are debated. Scholarly estimates have long hovered around14,000 to 15,000, which is clearly too low. Many Mandaeans calculate the populationat anywhere from 3,000 to about 100,000, the majority living in Iraq. Others insist thatthe numbers are much higher than 100,000. For a variety of reasons, exact figures areimpossible to ascertain. Iranian and Iraqi authorities may have their own demographicdata on the Mandaeans. Mandaeans themselves may harbor conflicting views on howto categorize those married outside the religion, those forced to convert to Islam, andthe secularized. Whether in “the old countries” or in emigration, current Mandaeancommunities face urgent, difficult identity questions. Many tend to determine theirheritage in terms of ethnicity or culture, giving less emphasis to the religion.At the moment of this writing, Iranian Mandaeans are hoping that their protectedstatus as “People of the Book,” in force during the Shah’s reign but removed whenAyatollah Khomeini came to power, will be reinstated. There are hopeful signs. In Iraq,the Mandaeans have at least pro forma protection, but in the ruined economy and thecurrent political climate, their lives are regularly endangered, and various forms of vic-timization occur. Because Mandaeans traditionally are goldsmiths, many are accused ofhoarding gold and other precious metals. Also, confiscations of shops and goods havebecome increasingly common. It is no wonder, then, that many Mandaeans seek tomove elsewhere. Today, an increasing number of Web sites keep Mandaeans connected."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction7Characteristics of the ReligionScholars have long debated the term Gnosticism and have noted that the word Gnosticis barely recorded as a term of self-designation in the ancient world putatively harboringGnosticism. However, as self-designated “knowers,” the Mandaeans (from Aramaicmanda: knowledge) do constitute the only still surviving group of Gnostics. Other lateantiquity Gnostics died out or were overrun long ago, largely due to the growth of or-thodox forms of Christianity. But the Mandaeans alone have persisted.They defy easy categorization. Neither Jewish, Christian, nor recognizably “pagan,”they possess an extensive literature containing multifarious mythological traditions, andthey continue to practice intricate rituals whose precise origins and antecedents are dif-ficult to determine. A modern variant of their own ancient Mandaic language (an EastAramaic dialect) is still kept alive, mainly in Iran.21 Various Mandaean communities,such as the one in and near Northbridge, New South Wales, Australia, are makingefforts to rescue their linguistic heritage, including the spoken language, called ratna.This is distinct from the classical, written language of Mandaean literature and tradi-tional ritual use.22Many aspects of the religion, particularly on the mythological level, resemble thosefound in other Gnostic systems. But it has a distinct identity, not attributable merely tolanguage and geography. Mandaeism’s own enormous literature spans a number of genresand is barely studied these days, let alone fully known. And the religion’s lengthy anddetailed rituals resist easy interpretations.Anyone starting to study the religion’s multifarious, complex mythological, ritual,and esoteric exegetical traditions gradually becomes attuned to its plural, encompassingworldviews, its cosmologies. One must ask: What is the many-faceted universe withinwhich Mandaeism breathes and makes sense? Can a common ground be found, oneon which the religionists themselves might nod and say, yes, such and such a scholarlyinterpretation seems reasonable? Alone among the ancient Gnostic religions, Mandaeismis alive, and its constituents must be reckoned with as interlocutors with scholars. It isnot possible to cling to outdated models of “objective” scholarship in which the scruti-nized subject remains mute and unable to interact with scholars who might adhere tostereotypical ideas about Gnosticism.“Meaning” does not remain static but is regularly subject to discussion, whetherinternally in Mandaeism or in scholarly work on it. Like most living religions, Mandaeismhas its battles, competing views, clashes of symbols, and a welter of apparently incom-patible mythological structures. But such dynamics demonstrate that the religion remainsin conversation with itself, and these debates should not be interpreted as glaring con-tradictions, hopeless fragmentation, or loss of identity.To begin, one might reasonably state that in Mandaeism the world is basically three-tiered: an upper, heavenly Lightworld (alma d-nhura: “world of light”); a middle, earthly,human world, named Tibil; and a somewhat gloomy underworld, an area that receivesless attention than the two others. Much energy is focused on the Lightworld, which insome texts is envisioned and/or mapped out in detailed descriptions. Mandaeism hasthis interest in common with other Gnostic systems, which see human beings living infundamental alienation on earth while the true home lies up above, in the light. Thereresides the supreme First Life, who also carries names such as the King of Greatness or"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"8Introductionthe King of Light, depending on the literary tradition or stratum. In downward or out-wardly expanding order come the subservient beings of light: Second Life, Third Life,and numerous others.The religion offers both an emanation model of creation and one that posits twooppositional worlds, the Lightworld and the world of darkness, existing at the begin-ning of time. But the emanation model is by far the most common, and the sheer massof variations in the creation mythology makes it impossible to appoint one, specific versionas “the original.”23 Evidently, Mandaeans have enjoyed and accommodated variety inthis respect, a characteristic that might frustrate scholars yearning to pinpoint a singu-lar, original myth.Most of the Lightworld beings, called \u0001utras (sing.: \u0001utra “wealth,” but meaning “angel”or “guardian”), were involved in the creation of the world(s) at the beginning ofime. In varying ways, they continue to uphold and look after the Lightworld and earth,and especially to keep contact with the Mandaeans of earth. Laufa (connection) is acentral Mandaeaen concept, and it expresses this contact between the worlds. The termcarries a practical—and not merely an abstract—significance. At the first creation, theLightworld beings established the laufa, which is constantly reestablished and recon-firmed by Mandaeans on earth as they perform rituals. Prayers, along with all otherrituals, were sent down to earth by the forces of light in order to be conveyed back upby humans. So there is an unceasing give-and-take between the two realms as earthlyactivity spins the life thread between the human world and ensures the connection tothe Light.The Lightworld contains different kinds of \u0001utras. Some of those who became toocaught up in the world creation are now incarcerated in the matartas, (toll stations) inthe vast spaces between earth and the Lightworld proper. Here they are stuck in sorrowand punishment until the end of time. It is commonly understood that when noMandaeans are left on earth, it will simply cease to exist. Then the last of the four worldages will have been completed, and the jailed \u0001utras will ascend, liberated, to their right-ful Lightworld home. This time of imprisonment reflects the Mandaean ambivalenceregarding creation and concrete life in the earthly world. For, just as soul and spirit aretrapped within human bodies, \u0001utras are stuck in their own prisons in the long interimbetween creation and end time.Other \u0001utras are more positively envisioned, predominantly as saviors and messen-gers. These movable figures regularly trek to earth to reveal Lightworld teachings and toassist Mandaeans. Manda d-Hiia (Knowledge of Life) occupies the preeminent positionamong \u0001utras. Another one, Anuš, performs miracles in the style of Jesus and destroysJerusalem. (Such traditions are clearly polemical toward Christianity and Judaism.) Šitil—a brother of Anuš and usually less prominent than Anuš and the third brother, Hibil—inhabits curiously interstitial roles. Partly because of his middle role, I have chosen Šitilas the subject for one of this book’s chapters.Presiding at the pinnacle of the Lightworld is the First Life, majestically enthroned,the royal chief of the saving ambassador \u0001utras, of those imprisoned in the matartas,and of all Mandaeans. Unlike the \u0001utras, the First Life does not travel about but restsserenely above, overseer of everything below. Female Lightbeings, usually envisioned aswives of the male ones, are commonly acknowledged. Such evidence for gender balancein the Lightworld is striking, for many other forms of Gnosticism harbor overt forms of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction9misogyny.24 Prominent among female figures in the Lightworld is Simat Hiia (Treasureof Life), who appears in the recurrent Mandaean formula “In the name of Yawar Ziwa[i.e., Yawar Radiance] and Simat Hiia.” Several Lightworld females appear in chapter 4,which focuses on Ruha.At first glance, she seems to be the only undisputedly evil being in Mandaeism. Thetraditionally demonic beings in Mandaeism are the zodiac spirits, the planets, and theirmother Ruha, the personified evil spirit, a parody of the Christian “Holy Spirit” (Ruhad-Qudša). According to a few traditions, she originally belonged in the Lightworld, butRuha mainly epitomizes lust, music, and the emotions. Many myths pair her with hertragically undeveloped dragon son \u0001Ur. Envious of human beings, Ruha tries to trapthem by allying herself with her counterpart in the human beings, the spirit (ruha), who,as the middle component in a person, wobbles between the elevated soul and the fleshlybody. On the level of Mandaean anthropology, as a native science of the human being,this tripartition is of central importance, especially as envisioned in ritual life. As acounterpart to the Lightworld, the underworld plays a major role mainly in a few large,dramatic creation myths featuring a Lightworld envoy, usually Hibil, who travels down-ward to subdue the underworld prior to the creation of Tibil, the earth.25 Krun, thegreat flesh-mountain, rules on the bottom of the seven-leveled underworld but is de-feated by Hibil. As in Manichaeism, the Mandaean underworld is a primordial given,arisen from itself, and when it catches a glimpse of the Lightworld, it attacks. After Hibil’sexploits have sapped the underworld’s strength, that realm seems to play only a minorpart in the further affairs of the universe. This might be so because, as the earth comesinto being, it and the matartas appear hellish enough. Souls of wicked Mandaeans gonot to the underworld but upward to be purified in suitable matartas until they are fitfor further ascent. Unbaptized dead infants spend time in a special limbo world wherethey are suckled by a tree with breastlike fruits.26The chief concern for Mandaeans is, then, how to live in the middle realm, that is,in Tibil. Another overarching interest is how to die, to obtain a proper ascent to theLightworld. The chief Mandaean rituals are time-consuming. But one could also putmatters in the opposite perspective and say that the rituals are time-creating. Highlycomplex, the rituals of life and death—with their patterns, rhythms, and symbolic worlds—are difficult to interpret in their full depth. Some are undertaken by priests only, shieldedfrom the eyes of the laypeople.Priests, of whom there are two main classes, ganzibras (treasurers) and tarmidas (originalmeaning: “disciples”), essentially hold the position of \u0001utras on earth. Similar to the\u0001utras, they may move—ritually rather than literally—between the realms. Keeping up thelaufa, the priests act as “\u0001utras-from-below,” and because priests are humans, their start-ing point is of course the earth, not the Lightworld. Preparing themselves for rituals,the priests are able to harness Lightworld energies and thereby in a sense effect theirpropulsion upward. Suitably, at the end of ceremonials, the priests deconsecrate theirinsignia and again assume “human” status.The sixty-eight-day-long priest initiation for the tarmida is the subject of chapter 9.Rituals such as the death mass (masiqta), treated in chapter 8, and the priest initiationare both built from clustered, separate ritual elements, which are arranged like buildingblocks. For instance, a tarmida initiation contains several baptisms and a number ofmeals. At death, the souls and spirits of all Mandaeans (priests and laypeople alike) go"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"10Introductionto the Lightworld, provided the death has been pure and the death rituals have beenperformed properly.27As baptist Gnostics, the Mandaeans possess as their most central ritual the baptism(masbuta). On Sundays and on special holidays baptism takes place, and it must beperformed by a priest (any Mandaean may do a kind of self-baptism, but these consti-tute other, minor Mandaean washing rituals). The maƒbuta is not an initiation ritualbut a repeated baptism in flowing, fresh water, the primary form in which the Lightworldmanifests itself on earth.Daunting remedies—in terms of sheer time and details—await priests who commiterrors in death rituals or other ceremonials. Mistakes in rituals affect both the performerand the one for whose benefit the ritual is conducted.28 After bodily death, a successfulmasiqta merges soul and spirit into one ascending entity that will reside in the world ofideal counterparts (Mšunia Kušta). In this particular area of the Lightworld, the risenentity joins its departed relatives and ancestors. Here lives the nonincarnate portion,the dmuta (image) of each person. A soul, safely arrived in this upper world, has tra-versed vast cosmic distances and endured many tests presented by the toll house watch-ers, the jailed creator \u0001utras and other, less tragic but more demonic, beings.As noted, all the major Mandaean rituals aim to reinforce the laufa, to reconnect thepeople with the Lightworld. While the maƒbuta temporarily puts living Mandaeans indirect contact with the Lightworld, the death rituals convey the dead to the upper world.Funerary meals strengthen the living and the dead. And the community must producepriests whose task it is to create the laufa from below. This uppermost class of leadershold the Mandaean communities together, act as go-betweens with secular authorities,instruct the people, and are experts in astrology and in writing talismans. Also, in termsof the ongoing production of transcribing the vast corpus of religious texts, the priests(and, more rarely, learned laymen) are still the carriers of this task.29Overview of Mandaean LiteratureThe GinzaIn the spring of 1998, I received in the mail a copy of the first-ever printed Mandaeanholy book, the Ginza. The Mandaean Research Centre of Northbridge, New South Wales,Australia, has produced this hefty tome,30 in Mandaic fonts developed in their commu-nity. For nearly two millennia, the Ginza has been transcribed by Mandaean priests,always in the same format. As noted earlier, the work is separated into a right and a leftpart, GR and GL, and the two parts are organized in such a way that on reaching theend of GR, a reader must turn the volume upside down to read GL. The two parts faceone another in the manner of two inscribed bowls enclosing the text within. I thinkthat this may very well be the Ginza’s model, for traditional Mandaean inscribed claybowls are often found buried in this same fashion.The most revered among Mandaean texts, the Ginza is a conglomerate. The codexmay have reached its final, collected form in the mid–seventh century. As noted, at thattime Mandaean authorities presented the book to Muslim leaders as proof that theMandaeans had a holy book and therefore merited exemption from forced conversion"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction11to Islam. But it is quite likely that the various parts of the Ginza already had been col-lected for internal Mandaean purposes,31 and not solely to present a holy text to theauthorities. The first useful Ginza to be published in the West was Heinrich Petermann’sSidra Rabba,32 which remains the only critical edition, containing a Latin translationand Petermann’s transcribed Mandaic. Mark Lidzbarski’s introduction to his editedGerman translation of the Ginza gives valuable information, and so do his individualintroductions to each Ginza tractate.Of the eighteeen tractates making up GR, the first and second ones contain very oldtraditions, though no part of GR appears to be as ancient as GL.33 GR 1–13 comprise,first, GR 1 and 2, which are basically two versions of the same work.34 GR 1 has onlyone tractate, containing a series of moral teachings and a Mandaic “world history,” whileGR 2 consists of four sections. Creation stories, moral exhortations, a confession ofsins, revelations about history, end-of-the-world speculations and polemics—especiallyanti-Christian materials—are all present. So, GR 1 and 2 offer a representative selectionof Mandaean religious concerns.By far the largest of the Ginza tractates, GR 3 is a vast, poetic creation myth of per-suasive narrative power. The next two tractates deal with underworld journeys, heroic\u0001utras, the soul’s travels through the matartas, and with the baptism of the Mandaeansavior and messenger Manda d-Hiia (Knowledge of Life) by John the Baptist—the latterstory is found in GR 5, 4. GR 6 contains the marvelous story of the Noah/Utnapishtim-like Dinanukht (the one who speaks according to the religion),35 the half man, halfbook who goes on a journey to the upper worlds.36 Words of wisdom from John theBaptist make up GR 7, while in GR 8 Manda d-Hiia warns believers against Ruha.Polemics dominate the first part of GR 9, and the young boy created from the heavenlyJordan in GR 9, 2 may be of Orphic origin.37Creation stories dominate the next couple of tractates. GR 12 has seven sectionscomposed of varied contents, while GR 13 is a priestly, exhortatory prayer for the com-munity. The first (of seven) Ginza colophons occurs after GR 13, which indicates thatthis part of the Ginza was considered to be a unit. There is no doubt that GR 1–13alone testify to a fully developed Mandaean Gnosticism. Many of the religion’s chiefliterary genres are present, in prose and poetry: moral teachings, creation myths, polem-ics, liturgy, sapiential traditions, and so forth.Each of the next five tractates carries a colophon, which demonstrates that they oncewere separate documents. Most of these contain poetry. The right part of the Ginzaends with GR 18, an apocalyptic world history in which the Old Testament EgyptianExodus is given a Mandaean twist. According to GR 18, the world is 480,000 yearsold, but my current Mandaic calendar—printed in New York38—states that it is now445,368 years since Adam’s birth.Turning the Ginza upside down, one finds that GL, the part of the Ginza that con-centrates on the fate of the soul after the body’s death, consists of three tractates. GL 1has four sections, and the prose piece GL 1, 2 tells the wondrous story about the firstman to die, Adam’s son Šitil. GL 2’s twenty-eight sections of poetry begin with theformulaic “I am a Mana39 of the Great Life.” Sixty-two poems dealing with the destinyof the soul constitute GL 3. A few of these pieces belong to the prayer category \u0001nianas(responses) found in the Mandaean liturgical collections."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"12IntroductionThe LiturgiesThe heart of Mandaean religious life is found in its rituals, hence the importance ofprayers and liturgies. First translated by Lidzbarski, a sizable portion of the prayers becameavailable in 1920, while Drower in 1959 published her larger, English translation ofwhat is termed Qulasta (collection), the corpus of Mandaean liturgies.40 In the back ofDrower’s Prayerbook one finds all the prayers in Mandaic, in facsimile. Over 400 num-bered prayers are included, but some, especially toward the end of the collection, areduplicates. Among the Mandaeans themselves, smaller, well-thumbed volumes of prayersfor specific liturgical purposes are commonly used.Originally, what became the Prayerbook consisted of eight different units, for thecollection contains eight colophons. The prayers are of varying length; some are only afew lines long, others take up several pages in Drower’s translation. At the beginning,we find the baptism liturgy, the masiqta prayers, and two \u0001ngirta (letter) prayers. This isan ancient section, going back to the third century, according to colophon information.At specific segments in the ritual sequences, the text offers directions and other formsof explanations to the priestly officiant. For instance, after prayer 19 the text states, “Thisis the set prayer for the baptism wreath. Recite it over the myrtle wreath and place it onthe heads of the souls that thou baptisest.”41 Three very long hymns of praise,42 75–77,make up the next unit, and then comes a \u0001niana series used for baptism, masiqta, andother rituals. The next segment, which includes the daily prayers, is composed of spe-cific groupings of prayers for the different days of the week. Priests pray such sets threetimes a day, and prayer 104 is also uttered by Mandaean laypeople. In contrast to thePrayerbook’s second and third units, the fourth segment carries a colophon stretchingback to Zazai of Gawazta, as did the text’s first segment.The very important prayer 170, called “Our Ancestors,” appears in the next sec-tion. Used at specific times of the year, this prayer asks for forgiveness of sins for thereciter and for a long list of Mandaean ancestors, mainly priests.43 A peculiar featureof Mandaean liturgy is the occasional alphabet hymn, a prayer featuring clue wordsin alphabetic sequence at the beginning of each stanza, running from A to T.44 Prayer179 is such a prayer, praising central Lightworld entities. Hymns for priest initiationceremonials and for marriage are also included in this part of the Prayerbook.Priest initiation liturgies occur also in the next part of the text, for here begins theantiphonal series “When the Proven, the Pure One, Went,” recited at marriage and atthe creation of a new tarmida.45 The next segment covers prayers already included inother parts of the text, and the last part includes the priest coronation hymn series,305–29, which are recited alternately by the chief officiant and by the other priests presentat the initiation of a new tarmida. The last of the Prayerbook’s colophon appears afterprayer 329, and the end of the book contains a number of prayers without a colophon.This looks like a certain looseness in the “canon.” Some very long hymns occur towardthe end.All in all, one may say that the contents of the Prayerbook reflect a variety of facets ofMandaean religion. Mythological references, cosmological teachings, and moral preceptsare presupposed in almost all of the liturgies, so that a reader familiar with the founda-tions of Mandaean teachings may perceive clear or veiled associations to—and even re-vealing ideological uses of—these materials in the prayers.46 Especially with respect to"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction13the major rituals, one may detect how Mandaean baptism and masiqta ritual segmentsare carefully anchored in mythological materials. But, as in any liturgical tradition, itwould be difficult to reconstruct the overarching mythological structures on the basis ofprayers alone. Liturgies take for granted an already established worldview, and they workto reinforce it.The Book of JohnMuch cherished by Mandaeans but hardly studied at all by scholars, this conglomeratedocument, named for the chief Mandaean prophet, occupies an important place in thereligion. A leaden copy of this book was shown to me in Ahwaz in 1973, as noted inmy preface. The only translation remains Lidzbarski’s from 1915,47 which, in the latterhalf of the book includes his own Mandaic transcription in stunningly beautiful callig-raphy. Like the Ginza and the liturgies—though unlike many other Mandaean texts—John is always in book, that is, codex, form.Its age, in terms of colophonic information, can be assigned to early Islamic times,though John undoubtedly retains much material that is considerably older. Lidzbarskidivides the text into thirty-seven tractates and bestows on them titles according to con-tent. Here we find, despite the title of the book, a focus on John the Baptist mainlyconfined to the lengthy sixth tractate of the book. This deals with John’s miraculousbirth and preaching and includes the prophet’s polemical conversations with a defen-sive Jesus. Most of the sections in this tractate begin with the mysterious formula “Yahiapreached in the nights; Yohana in the evenings of the night,” which retains both theAramaic and the Arabic forms of John’s name.48Tractates are devoted to specific \u0001utras. Some of the Lightbeings are shown in de-grees of distress, for instance, Hibil in tractate 21, which Lidzbarski names “Hibil’sLament.”49 Other featured Lightworld beings include the personified Truth (Kušta) intractates 1 and 5 and the \u0001utra Anuš mimicking Jesus’ deeds in Jerusalem (tractates 20and 37). Very intriguing material on Miriai, Jesus’ mother, appears in tractate 7.50 Severaltractates take a striking interest in female entities connected with the Lightworld.Mythological themes and moral exhortations dominate in John; some of these arefound elsewhere in Mandaean texts, while others are unique to the text. Several tractatesfocus on polemics. There is a conspicuous emphasis on suffering Lightworld beings—Hibil is only one example. In fact, John carries a strong emotional force, its movingdescriptions of pain, longing, and alienation perhaps reflecting—and projecting upwardto the Lightworld—the tribulations of Gnostics under persecution.Ritual Commentaries: Esoteric Exegetical LiteratureThe largest and most complex among the ritual commentaries is The Thousand and TwelveQuestions, edited and translated by Drower. This not a coherent book in itself but acompendium of texts. Drower’s transliterated texts take up the first 108 pages of heredition, and a booklet containing the facsimile text is tucked into a pocket on the insideback cover. Separated into two books, the first containing two sections and the secondhaving seven sections (with subsections), 1012 at first gives an unwieldy impression.Certainly, this is not a text for novices in Mandaean studies. Depths of mysteries are"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"14Introductionexplored, usually through utterances by a Lightworld being, such as the Lord of Great-ness, (mara d-rabuta), at the request of a prototypical priest. 1012 offers detailed com-mentaries on different kinds of death masses, on meals for the dead, and on the mar-riage ceremony. The original, Lightworld celebration of such rituals is held up asexemplary for earthly officiants, who are admonished to avoid mistakes in rituals. Howto rectify such errors if they do occur is one of the text’s most conspicuous features.Detailed instructions show how officials must deal with errors committed at any givenstep, and/or in any given formula, of the ceremonials.A secret treatise on the original creation of the body appears in Book I, ii of 1012.Physiological-metaphysical and alphabetical speculations are interspersed everywhere,51and esoteric creation mythologies abound throughout the text. The Lightworld speakerrepeatedly emphasizes how secret this text is, and that it must not be made availableto anyone except, according to the recurring Mandaean formula, only “to one amongthousand, two among two thousand.” 1012 is perhaps the quintessential Mandaeantext demonstrating the priestly craft. A fruitful way to use it, for scholars, is as a guideto the step-by-step sequence of certain rituals. It can be profitably consulted in con-junction with other texts, whether liturgies, other ritual commentaries related to 1012,or mythologies.As he concludes his copying task of 1012 in or after the middle of the seventh cen-tury, the well-known Mandaean copyist Ramuia, son of \u0001Qaimat, states, “When I wrotethis Diwan it was in separate treatises. I wrote them down and collected these reliablemysteries one by one, and combined them into fourteen writings, (making) two or threediscourses into one.52Addressing himself to fellow priests and scribes, Ramuia adds that in order to keepthese separate texts united, he has made them into a single scroll, “so that its beauty,fame and honor may be yours, and forgiveness of sins.”53Other, smaller texts belonging to the same category as 1012 are The Coronation ofthe Great Šišlam, The Great “First World” and The Lesser “First World,” The Scroll ofExalted Kingship, and The Baptism of Hibil Ziwa. All of these are scrolls and, except forCoronation, have illustrations in the classical Mandaean stylized manner.54 Apart fromExalted Kingship, Drower edited and translated all the others, publishing them duringthe decade 1953 to 1963. Coronation and Exalted Kingship are commentaries on thetarmida initiation, the first text being much shorter, almost like a catalog when com-pared with the exuberantly esoteric and expansive mind-set of Exalted Kingship.55The Great “First World” and the Lesser “First World” belong together, for the first onedeals, ostensibly, with the creation of the Lightworld, and the second with its lowerimage: the earthly world. But both are esoteric ritual commentaries, in the style of 1012and Exalted Kingship. Macro- and microcosmic speculations abound as metaphysics andanatomy hover side by side in dizzying priestly mental constructions. Facsimiles of bothtexts are rolled up in a carton container that accompanies the translation in regularbook format.The Baptism of Hibil Ziwa deals with the first baptism, that of Hibil Ziwa. It is set inthe context of Hibil’s return from the underworld (a myth elaborately expounded inGR 5, 1), marking the end of a trip necessitating the \u0001utra’s baptism in order to restorehis purity. Hibil Ziwa, then, becomes a commentary on the maƒbuta, the baptism ritual.The scroll is lavishly illustrated, and its facsimile is folded up in the back of the book"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction15and can be unrolled across a room as a long, narrow runner, showing Lightworld be-ings and trees.Despite scholarly skepticism, most of these ritual commentaries are ancient, as theircolophons demonstrate. Further investigations of the age of these texts belong to myseemingly endless historical research on Mandaean colophons.Other WorksHibil Ziwa is bound together with Haran Gawaita (Inner Haran). As noted already, thelater is the intriguing “history” of the Mandaeans leaving Jerusalem for the east. Brokenoff at the beginning, Haran Gawaita starts with a diatribe against Jesus, whose motherbecame pregnant by witchcraft. The real historical value of this tale is much debated,56but the work contains information about Mandaean settlements in Babylonia and nameshistorical persons.Oddly enough, another historical source is the Mandaean book of astrology, SfarMalwašia: The Book of the Zodiac, published by Drower in 1949, her first translatededition of a Mandaean text. The document offers numerous place-names, many of whichare difficult to ascertain geographically.57 Clearly indebted to Babylonian traditions, thiswork has received almost no scholarly attention.58 Astrology is the province of priests,and traditionally, every Mandaean has his or her horoscope read. Unlike the Mandaeantexts mentioned in the previous section, this text is in loose-leaved, kurasa form. It hasno illustrations. A facsimile of the text is given in the back of Drower’s translation.Šarh d-Qabin d-Šišlam Rba: The Scroll of the Marriage of the Great Šišlam,59 containsinstructions for the Mandaean marriage ceremony and gives the hymns belonging to theritual. Unlike the majority of ritual scrolls, this one is not illustrated, and the text plumbsno symbolic depths. It has, therefore, a quite straightforward character. At every marriage,the officiating priest reads through the entire book. The hymn cycle “When the proven,the Pure One Went” occurs here, as well as in the Prayerbook, as noted earlier.One of the most lavishly illustrated texts is Diwan Abatur, which gives detailed infor-mation on the matartas and on Lightworld geography. “Purgatory” inhabitants are iden-tified, the question-and-answer format known from other commentary literature appears,and a version of the world creation is included. Folded up in a pocket in the back of thebook is the facsimile of the scroll itself. Twenty feet long, the ream60 is an impressivepiece of art. It is all here: priestly prototypes, heavenly ships, threatening animals, de-mons with clanging cymbals, the Lightworld tree nourishing unbaptized infants, andthe scales at the entrance to the Lightworld proper.Another illustrated scroll is Diwan Nahrawata (The scroll of the rivers), translatedinto German and published by K. Rudolph in 1982.61 It shows mountains, rivers andcanals, plants and trees of decidedly earthly geography. But the pictures are entirely styl-ized. Some place-names can be identified, others not. Photographs of the scroll are in-cluded at the back of the volume.Many of the texts in the Drower Collection (DC) in the Bodleian Library in Oxfordremain unpublished. Drower let some of the smaller texts, mainly exorcisms, appear inscholarly journals and other such forums, as they are not large enough for book for-mats. Mandaean texts unknown in the West are surely preserved in private Mandaeanlibraries in the Orient. One-third of the forty Mandaean manuscripts that K.

One unpublished bowl has its lines (which appearmainly to be names) fanning in petal fashion from the bottom of the bowl.65 The painton the bowls may be black or reddish. As noted, bowls are frequently buried in pairs,one enclosed upon the other, evidently to secure the formulas protected inside. Onescholar currently researching bowls is Erica C. D. Hunter.66Surprises occur in the search for Mandaean literature, and not just in the Orient.Books or scrolls that hardly anyone ever sees or that attain no mention in scholarlyworks still lie tucked away in research libraries. In 1996, I made a few such finds in theBodleian Library at Oxford. First, an impressively illustrated scroll called The Scroll ofExorcism (of) the Great Name of the Lord of Greatness and the Image of Truth is indicatedas having been bought through Drower in 1954.67 The text’s contents are unknown tome. Second, the oldest manuscript in Europe is also the smallest book volume of anyMandaean text that I know. It measures four by five inches and is a leatherbound col-lection of prayers, transcribed in 1529.68 In contrast, a third work, Hunt. 6, a collec-tion of texts transcribed in 1615, is an enormous volume at sixteen inches high andtwelve inches wide and containing 536 pages. Some of its thick, yellowed pages, whichare edged like a washboard, bear ancient water stains. I have determined that this is aGinza, but it has not been studied by scholars.Brief Note on ScholarshipAs noted, Europeans became aware of the Mandaeans mainly during the sixteenth cen-tury, when Portuguese Jesuit missionaries tried to convert them. Young Mandaean menwere induced—or outrightly kidnapped—to serve in at least one of Portugal’s colonialwars, in present-day Sri Lanka. The missionaries and other officials were the first tobring Mandaean texts to Europe.69 Libraries such as the Vatican Library, the BibliothèqueNationale in Paris, the British Museum in London, and the Bodleian Library at OxfordUniversity hold Mandaean texts, and inscribed clay bowls and lead strips are housed invarious collections. The Bodleian Library has the largest collection, the Drower Collec-tion, given by Lady E. S. Drower toward the end of her long career.70When Theodor Nöldeke published his Mandaean grammar in 1875, he rightly judgedthat the time was ripe for such a work. Still, he had little regard for Mandaean texts asreligious literature, as he found them confusing and downright insane. True to his time’stheories of climate-dependent intelligence, Nöldeke held the marshes in southern Iraqto be unsuitable for the development of mental faculties.71In the early 1800s, the Swedish scholar M. Norberg published a flawed Latin transla-tion of the Ginza.72 Later in that century, H. Petermann transcribed the Ginza in Mandaic"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction17letters and translated it into Latin.73 Petermann also gave valuable accounts of Mandaeanlife as he saw it during his travels in the mid–nineteenth century.74 Scholars such as WilhelmBrandt and Richard Reitzenstein became interested in Mandaeism. 75 This was due inpart to the notion that Mandaeism might belong to a hypothetical, pervasive Iranian-basedGnostic “system.” The early part of the next century saw the activities of M. Lidzbarski (d.1928), a Polish Jew who hated his own tradition, ran away from home at a young age,76and became the first great scholar of Mandaeism. Any scholar working in the religiontoday still uses Lidzbarski’s translations of John, the liturgies, and the Ginza.Spurred partly by the works of Lidzbarski, Rudolf Bultmann entered the increasinglylively scholarly arena of Mandaean studies by publishing his famous article on theMandaean and Manichaean connections to the Gospel of John.77 At this time scholarshad swung around to entertain early Christianity as a serious arena for Gnosticism andas a competing parallel to the idea of Gnosticism’s Iranian origins. Hans Jonas’s mag-isterial work can still be consulted for its thorough overview of scholarship at that time,and his choice of Mandaean sources as Gnostic textual examples served to make knownthe religion’s mythologies.78 A host of scholars were engaged in what was dubbed the“Mandaean fever” of those decades; however, it must be conceded that some of thescholars harbored ideological concerns, having more or less overt religious-political axesto grind, faiths to defend, and origins to prove.79Lady Ethel S. Drower (1879–1972) broke the traditional scholarly molds. A success-ful author and an experienced Near Eastern traveler, she was an autodidact who dwelledintermittently in Iraq and befriended Mandaeans there during four decades after theFirst World War. Lady Drower remains unchallenged as the primary fieldworker onMandaeism and as the chief collector of the Mandaeans’ manuscripts.80 She remainedactive into her eighties. Franz Rosenthal has said that she has done more for Mandaeanstudies than even Lidzbarski.81 Today, older Mandaeans still remember her fondly.Drower’s coworker in the decades-long work of producing a Mandaic dictionary wasR. Macuch,82 the primary linguist of ancient and modern Mandaic, and a tireless workerwith Iranian Mandaeans on their spoken language. In 1953, he discovered, to his ownand Lady Drower’s delight, that spoken Mandaic, long assumed to be extinct, was stillalive in parts of Khuzistan, Iran.Another scholar dedicated chiefly to Mandaeism is the historian of religions KurtRudolph, whose extensive works on the religion, the tradition of its history, and itsphenomenology remain authoritative. Taking his clues from the predominance of dual-istic versus emanation patterns of Mandaean creation mythology and from the variousterms for the Lightworld and its denizens, Rudolph has carefully sifted the differentstrata of the Mandaean literature, including the Ginza.83 His early two-volume work onMandaean religion remains the most thorough to date.84 Moving competently betweenthe Gnosticism in Nag Hammadi texts, Manichaeism, and Mandaeism, Rudolph’s workhas a breadth uncharacteristic of most scholars of Gnosticism. His essays on Gnosti-cism and late antiquity are conveniently collected in a recent volume.85Any new scholar entering the field of Mandaeism will be indebted to Drower, Macuch,and Rudolph. It should also be said that the Mandaeans themselves, increasingly so-phisticated about scholarly studies in their religion, take a vital interest in what outsid-ers say about it. Further work on the religion may therefore be expected also from theMandaeans’ own ranks."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"18IntroductionMy own study of the religion began in Norway in the middle to late 1960s, as aresult of reading Hermann Hesse, Jorge Luis Borges, and Hans Jonas’s massive two-volume Gnosis.86 I am often asked why I study Mandaeism, and my answer is threefold:because the Mandaeans are still alive, because they have an enormous literature, andbecause almost nobody else studies them. From the very beginning, my concentrationon Mandaeism became an exercise in the history of religions, that is, for my purposesMandaeism serves as an example of a religion. Viewing any religion as a systematicordering of experiences and knowledge of human interactions with otherworldly enti-ties, I try to make sense of the specifically Mandaean way of ordering experiences andforms of knowledge.Parameters and Purposes of the Present WorkBecause the Mandaeans, unlike other Gnostics, are still alive and active in their tradi-tion, it seems improper to write about them in the past tense. The religion’s continuedlife demands that scholars avoid relegating them to a distant past, one in which theMandaeans themselves have no voice. We have a scholarly, moral responsibility to dulyrespect these last surviving Gnostics, who can teach us much, not only about them-selves but also, in a comparative perspective, about Gnostics long ago.I do not aim to present a complete portrait of the Mandaean religion. Rather, throughchosen frameworks, this book tries to show how and why Mandaeism works the way itdoes, in thoughtful action and practical thought. It is with an eye to Mandaeism’s wider,more general usefulness as an example of how a religion creates itself that I offer whatfollows.This book takes rituals seriously, for even more than in the study of mythologies, aparticular danger lurks in the interpretation of rituals. It may be easy enough to traceritual steps and segments and to undertake an immediate comparison of, say, theMandaean repeated baptism, the maƒbuta, with Christian forms of baptism. But it is adifferent task to interpret the Mandaean baptism in accordance with its own cosmologyand soteriology. Especially with respect to Gnostic religions—allegedly so “brainy” andintellectual—scholars have too often tended to exclude the study of rituals, as if practiceswere somehow scandalous.87 In more recent years, however, scholars seem to be takingGnostic rituals more seriously.If rituals aim to concentrate the attention and imagination in order to create other realitiesand other worlds, interpreters need to grasp the Mandaean understanding of the differencebetween its “here,” the earthly world, and its “there,” the Lightworld, without leaping toautomatic conclusions based on other Gnostic examples. In Mandaeism one encounters,for instance, a horror of asceticism and celibacy, characteristics commonly associated withother forms of Gnosticism. (Both features need to be rethought in Gnostic studies.) Therather muted Mandaean dualism appears less stark than one might expect in a Gnosticreligion.I view rituals as work. To explain what I mean, I will refer in the next few para-graphs to a particular focus in Martin Heidegger’s analysis of the structures of under-standing in Being and Time.88 (Many years ago, I was a philosopher before I became ahistorian of religions.) People already live in a world they have understood in a prelimi-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction19nary sense, according to Heidegger. Understanding is, for Heidegger, a given, an “exis-tential,” a fundamental, a priori category of human existence. Understanding leads topractice, and abstract thinking constitutes a third step. Practice becomes the basis forexplicit interpretation, such as conceptual thinking. But this step is not of any particu-lar interest to religious insiders, except, perhaps, for levels of esoteric exegesis.Not surprisingly, it is the second step, practice, that I find useful for an interpreta-tion of rituals in Mandaeism. Rituals occur in a world that is already informed by mythol-ogy, and the ritual implements fit the religious work space. The intention of the workis circumscribed in what Heidegger calls the care structure (Sorge), which shows whatthe work is intended to accomplish. In the dynamics of the work, both tool and workerrecede and become non-ostentatious. Theoretical contemplation of the work does notlead to completion of the work; instead, the proper, practical relation between workerand tool is essential. As supposed aliens in this world, that is, “stereotypical” Gnostics,Mandaeans seem strikingly interested in concrete tools deriving from the material world.How is the Mandaean soteriology discernible in the ritual work? As long as the ritualproceeds according to its work rhythm, the Lightworld is accessible, made present. Thetools are “ready-to-hand,” as Heidegger would say. While an outsider—let’s say a student—might ask why a priest is wielding a certain item or performing a particular action, theofficiant does not, normally, stop in midaction to contemplate his ritual staff, for in-stance. He is not likely to gaze at it in a distancing manner and ask abstract questionsabout what it “means” or about the meaning of life. Rather, it is in the work that theexistential called understanding (Verstehen) realizes itself most authentically, Heideggerwould say. Ritual practice brings the already understood life-world into clear view. Butstudents must first find out what that Mandaean world is.Mandaean rituals are precise and complicated, rely utterly on words and deeds intandem, and seem to demonstrate confidence about the very possibility and efficacy ofritual work. The rituals challenge any facile prejudgments about world-weary Gnostics.The priestly craft aims at overcoming distances, making the laufa (the connection be-tween earth and Lightworld) explicit, and reconfirming it. Freeing soul and spirit takestime, and the river needs to be made ready for baptism in just the right way. Hard workrequires complex work structures. These are pragmatic issues.Familiarity and alienation exist together. In this book, I emphasize the tensions withinthe religion, for it is precisely the issues a religion never manages to solve fully thatmerit our special attention. To my mind, rituals reveal the creative tensions withinMandaeism. Polemics offer another illustration, for when Mandaeism spends much efforton restating that it does not, never did, and never will resemble certain other religions,it obviously has considerable experience with those religions. Identity is won at a cost.When Mandaeism rails against, say, Judaism and Christianity, its own contours be-come clearer.Internally, a religion can tolerate paradoxes where outsiders may see only contradic-tions. Mandaeism never quite solves the problem of where a figure such as the creatorPtahil belongs in an ideal categorizing system of “good” and “evil,” but lets him roam.Thus, Ptahil invites thought, puzzlement, and ultimately, no final answer. Where andwhen he appears determines how a given text evaluates him. Double-sided \u0001utras areportrayed in some contexts as sinful, imperfect figures involved in the deplorable activ-ity of world creation, and in others as lofty Lightworld beings above reproach."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"20IntroductionSetting the stage for chosen mythological figures, the next chapter introduces a Mandaeanpoet. Chapters focusing on Šitil, Ruha, and Miriai follow next. Part II—on the rituals ofbaptism, death mass, and priest initiation—begins with a description of my visit withthe Mandaeans of Iran. Interpretation issues are introduced by a chapter on the NewYork Mandaeans. Part III contains a chapter on solving a puzzle in The Great “LesserWorld,” one on issues in Exalted Kingship, and one on Mandaean language games, andends with a brief look at my ongoing colophon research. This, latter area is the topic ofanother, future book.Because of the difficult political situations in the traditional Mandaean homelands,the chapters involving living Mandaeans have been thoroughly censored and edited,with invaluable help by Mandaean friends in many countries. I am grateful for theircare in these matters, for any scholar writing about present-day Mandaeans must takecurrent political realities very seriously. I can only hope that no Mandaean will be ad-versely affected by what has emerged as the final versions of the “fieldwork” chapters."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"2From Iraq to CaliforniaGrains of Musk21During a hectic lunch break at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Reli-gion in 1991, I saw a former classmate hurrying toward me. Many years earlier, at theUniversity of Chicago, Marcia and I had taken a course together at the Oriental Insti-tute. Visibly excited, she said, “Jorunn, I have to talk to you; I have found the Mandaeansfor you!”“You must be kidding! Tell me! Do you have a minute?”She did. Marcia Hermansen, then a professor at San Diego State University, toldme that about forty Iraqi Mandaeans lived in San Diego and its environs. She had becomea friend of the Amara family and suggested that I come to meet the Mandaeans and togive a talk in her department the next fall.And so I did. This was the first time I met with Mandaeans in the United States.The Amara family, headed by Lamea Abbas Amara—a well-known poet in the Arabworld and a former political and cultural activist—gathered together about seven Mandaeanfamilies for a potluck dinner. Every time I turned to talk to someone, more deliciousfood mysteriously appeared on my plate. It was a very convivial evening, with much totalk about, much to learn and enjoy. But my time was short then, and it became clearthat I must return for a longer visit: That happened a year later, in December 1993.I am sitting at the dining table in Lamea’s apartment, transcribing priest lineages fromher grandfather’s Mandaean books—handwritten, priceless documents. The radio hums,the TV is on, other people talk, and rainwater drips from the ceiling into a bucket be-cause the landlord has not managed to repair the roof. Lamea is on the phone, talkinganimatedly in Arabic with someone in Washington, D.C., about her upcoming poetryreading there.Lamea, who is in her sixties, dark and intense, with the personality of an archaicqueen, lives with her sons and her sister in San Diego.1 They produce a magazine,Mandaee, mainly in Arabic, a little bit in English, which seeks to link Mandaeans allover the world and to instruct its readers about Mandaeism.

I learn thatLamea was the only woman in the 1959 Iraqi delegation to China, where she met MaoTse-tung and the Dalai Lama when the latter was a young man. For several years shewas a UNESCO delegate to Paris, and she has known high-ranking politicians and comeand gone in many embassies. She writes fiery love poems—and political ones.“I was killed in 1963,” she remarks to me one day, matter-of-factly.“What do you mean?” I am startled. She is referring to the heady, revolutionary daysof 1963, when the authorities thought they had caught Lamea but actually tortured andkilled another young woman. Lamea spent the years 1979–85 in Lebanon during thewar there: hiding, writing, sometimes being hungry.I ask about the Mandaeans in Iraq, about her own and her sister Shafia’s experi-ences, and those of her sons. Throughout the centuries—if not millennia—Mandaeanshave known that political upheavals usually spell trouble for them. If a coup overturnsthe present system, they may become victims again. Surely, the Mandaeans suffer alongwith other Iraqis, as the economy during the continuing embargo is among the weakestin the world. Money is basically worthless, but a sizable number of Mandaeans in Iraq(now chiefly in Baghdad) are in the gold and diamond trade. Such assets, at least tem-porarily, give them something durable in a ruined economy. But many go hungry, andeven those who have and deal in precious metals are often targets for robberies andkillings.Religious Origins, Neighbors, and FencesThree suras in the Qur\u0002an state that specified religions apart from Islam possess part ofthe divine truth and therefore, according to legal tradition, need not be forced to con-vert to Islam. Judaism and Christianity are among the specified religions, but a thirdgroup, the so-called Sabeans, has caused dispute throughout Muslim history.2 Whatdoes the term mean? Through the centuries, Mandaeans have fallen under the umbrella“Sabeans.” But the issue remains unsettled, and the relationships between the fourreligions are complex and subject to variations.In the 1960s, Lamea had a Jewish couple as neighbors and friends in Baghdad. Thehusband, who had a high position in the Jewish community, told Lamea that after theSix Day War with Egypt and the Arab countries, when Israel had gained more territory,he was approached by some families posing as Jews. They said they had merely beenpretending to be Muslims, but now they could reveal their true identity. Lameas asked,“Did you accept them as Jews?”“Of course not. They were known to have been Muslims for many generations.”What about me, here in San Diego, among Mandaeans? Though a lapsed Lutheran,and by culture a Christian, I ponder my status. Can the family let me eat with them intheir house? Yes, of course. Lamea and Shafia admit me to the kitchen, even to cookdinner. Shafia hovers around me, pencil in hand, and writes down my actions as Iprepare to serve poached salmon in the Norwegian manner. They make jokes about myjar of Postum (I don’t drink coffee): “Fake coffee for the fake Mandaean!” Shafia showsme how to eat Mandaean style—delicately and elegantly.

I give up and resort to the fork.Morga, a tasty meat and vegetable stew, is often simmering on the stove. Rice andbread are staples, chicken with a strong, sour broth appear regularly, and sometimesspaghetti with a sauce no Italian would quite recognize. When I first met the family in1992, Lamea gave me big packets of dates cured with sesame. The family had boughtthe dates in the desert and filled the back of a pickup truck lined with a sheet. Thedriveway at Marcia’s former house may still be spotted with dates that slid off the truckbed when the fruit was hosed down after the desert expedition.Under the sink hides a large bucket of curing olives, picked from the trees around theapartment complex. Green vegetables, salads, and fruits are always present in the apart-ment. I see no alcohol in the house, and nobody smokes. Lamea once wrote a thesis onthe Mandaean diet, which she holds to be extremely beneficial. She attributes the long lifeof the priests to their healthy food. Mandaean priests keep their teeth until they die in oldage, she tells me, and they do not die of cancer or heart attacks, but “from lungs,” pneu-monia—an understandable effect of dipping in water during the cold season.When it is just the three of us—Lamea, Shafia, and I—Lamea sometimes hands outcandy, which she hides from “the children,” the boys. Gifts of sweets and cookies dis-appear into a cupboard, sheltered from them. Zaki, still recovering from a heart attackhe had while in Jordan, is careful with his diet and brings home bags of fruits andvegetables. Zaidoun returns from a Christmas reception at the university with lots ofpomegranates. Ruman! Gleeful, we dig in. The Americans at the party considered thefruit to be only decoration, not food.“I never used to cook,” says Lamea with a sigh, “but now I cook all the time.” InIraq, the family lived a different life, with cooks and nice cars and houses. Everything isgone; nothing can be taken for granted. At least, in America there is food. But theyworry about the conditions of relatives and friends back home, the lack of food andnecessities, the dizzying rate of inflation.Zaidoun explains to me the three classes: the priest families, the regular people, andthose who are considered “Gentiles.” This structure still struggles with the more mod-ern notion of treating everyone as equals. Within Mandaean priestly families, specialrules obtain. Lamea tells me that when her grandmother had her period or if she hadjust had a child, Lamea’s grandfather, the priest, would cook his own food and bake hisown bread. I suddenly see the wisdom of having several wives.Rules were not Jesus’ strong suit. He made the Mandaean religion easier by relaxingthe regulations, according to the prevalent Mandaean view. Originally a Mandaean, Jesuscreated a religion of his own. A leader, he was “an intellectual,” explains Lamea, and hewanted to strengthen his position. In order to become a priest, he sought baptism fromJohn the Baptist. Jesus knew full well that being initiated into priesthood by a prophetwould have certain advantages. While not being the first prophet, John inhabits a spe-cial position as religious renewer in Mandaeism.Neither John nor Jesus is Jewish, but Mandaean. Many Mandaeans I have met wishto discuss these two figures with me. “You wrote in your book that John was Jewish,”says Lamea, disapprovingly. I admit that I did, and I explain that this is a common"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"From Iraq to California: Grains of Musk25notion among scholars. Of course, we might be wrong—who knows! I throw up myhands, trying to balance things out, and I comment that Jesus, branching out on hisown, did not do too well in Mandaean terms. But Lamea emphasizes the main point:that Jesus wanted power, and that he knew he could obtain it only through John.3Issam Hermiz, my Mandaean friend in Sweden, told me years ago that Jesus wantedto be baptized by John because Jesus was already planning to start his own religion, tobecome an apostate from Mandaeism. But Jesus wished first to secure the salvation ofhis soul. The two men were cousins, and their mothers were on good terms with oneanother, with Mary (Miriai) helping her kinswoman. “If Mary was not a Mandaean,she could not assist her aunt,” Lamea declares, and nails down her proof: “I never sawa girl from another religion come to my grandfather’s house to help my grandmother.This is forbidden. She could not even come into the house.”4 So it must be right thatMary and Elizabeth came from the same religion.The Christian Gospel tradition is criticized, for John the Baptist, given his character,could not possibly have said to Jesus, “I am not worthy of opening your shoes,” Lameaclaims. This is ridiculous and out of character—for John is not a humble man, but strong-minded, I am told. In fact, he even went against the power of the king (Herod) and thegovernment. Moreover, John initially did not want to baptize Jesus, for he knew thatJesus would make the religion easy.These days, Mandaeans may run into situations that demand ingenious responsesto the question of their identity. I tell Lamea about Issam’s story. Several years ago, I satin his living room outside of Stockholm, and we talked about the eternal question ofMandaean identity: Are the Mandaeans Jewish, or what? He says he will tell me whathappened to him recently because he wants to know whether I think he reacted cor-rectly. He begins, “You know that I work for a large bank, designing computer soft-ware. At lunch time, we line up for our food trays. One day in line, the guy behind menotices my tray, and he comments, ‘Why do you always get such good-looking food?’ Ianswer, ‘I don’t eat meat, especially not pork.’”Here Issam pauses briefly, making a face at the very thought of Swedish sausage,with its unspecified, unsavory contents. I cannot restrain myself but barge in, “So, heprobably asks you, ‘Are you Muslim?’”Issam nods, “Exactly.” And he continues, “I reply, ‘No.’ So the man looks at meand wants to know, ‘What are you, then?’ I hesitate a second, and answer, ‘There arethose other than Jews who do not eat pork.’” Issam implies that, in a sense, he is “halfJewish.” After that occurrence, one of the bank’s leaders, who is Jewish and who hadheard what happened, would greet Issam with special respect when he passed him inthe corridors.In May 1994, Majid \u0001Arabi, a young goldsmith in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon,shows me a video of his own baptism in January of that year, when he went back toBaghdad for the first time in about fifteen years. We sit in Lamea’s living room—Majidwith his wife, Abir, and his little daughter, Nura, along with Lamea, Shafia, my step-son, Jesse, and myself. Majid tells me that he left Iraq, alone, in 1980 because he couldsee a war coming. He went first to Morocco, then to Europe, and finally to New York.Having already learned the goldsmith trade from his grandfather, Majid apprenticedhimself to Jewish Hasidic gold and diamond specialists in Brooklyn.

The same clothes, the samehabits, the same humor—everything! I was amazed!” Majid beams.I ask him whether the Hasidim knew he was a Mandaean, whether they knew whatthat meant. No, they didn’t , and they didn’t care, but they knew he was not a Muslim.To the Hasidim, Majid was some kind of Christian. Then Majid asks me the questionhe seems to have pondered for years, “Are they Mandaeans? Are we Jews?”I shrug my shoulders and say, as so often, “Well, that’s the question, isn’t it? Whoknows!”Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all have a special place in their hearts for Ibrahim(Abraham). Some Mandaeans, too, see him as the first monotheist. And Lamea stressesthat Mandaeism was once, long ago, an extremely widespread religion. Socrates was aMandaean, as were many Egyptian pharaohs, and even some Roman emperors. In themiddle of the excitement about the Dead Sea Scrolls, Lamea went to hear a presenta-tion on the scrolls at San Diego State University. After the lecture, which was given bya museum director from Israel, Lamea went up to him and declared, “I am from thosepeople who wrote the Scrolls.”Immediately, he replied, “You are from Iraq; you are a Sabean.”On the subject of identity, I ask one day, “Can you tell, in Iraq, who is Mandaeanand who is not?”Not necessarily. During the 1970s, in Sweden, Issam explained to me how Mandaeansmay find out whether they are dealing with a coreligionist. A Mandaean would saysomething innocent, like “Do you want a cup of coffee?” to the other person but wouldadd the word Mandai at the end of the sentence. If the guest would catch the word, itwould mean that he is one of yours—if not, he would have concluded that you just garbledyour words a bit.Lamea tells me that her children were registered as Muslims, for protection. “Wedid not want them to go through the discrimination that we experienced,” she says.Before 1958, Iraq had a strict quota system regarding access to higher education forminorities. The Mandaeans, being perhaps 2 percent of the population, suffered underthese conditions. But after the revolution in 1958, these rules were relaxed, and manyMandaeans excelled in education. In fact, years ago I had heard that Mandaeans wereconsidered especially intelligent, with a high percentage being doctors, engineers, intel-lectuals, scientists, teachers, and so on.Zaki, Lamea’s eldest son, is one of several Mandaean air pilots. Mazin, her middleson, was in the army for sixteen years, sent to a very dangerous position in the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq war because one of Mazin’s superiors hated Lamea and wanted her sonkilled. But another superior acted in the opposite direction, for he admired Lamea andsaw to it that Mazin got a desk job, safer than being at the front.One day as I am sitting with my transcription work, Zaidoun comes in with twoserious-looking weapons. “Who have you been shooting?” I inquire. “Who? Who?” heechoes, jokingly, his eyes dancing. Two dry rattlesnake skins hang on the wall abovethe sofa, and Lamea has told me that Zaidoun killed the snakes in the mountains. Aformer Iraqi champion in marksmanship, Zaidoun has been practicing target shooting.Had not Iraq been excluded (due to the war) from the 1988 Olympics, Zaidoun wouldhave represented his country. Years before, he was sent to Yugoslavia to an interna-tional marksmanship competition and beat everyone."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"28BeginningsMandaeans distinguish themselves in various ways. One day a tape comes in themail from Baghdad. Lamea and Shafia are excited and insert the tape into the littleyellow boom box. The slow, sonorous voice belongs to their cousin, now the “statepoet” of Iraq, directly protected by the state and living “in a palace by the river,” Lameaspecifies. The cousin is reading one of the Ginza myths about Adam’s creation, in Ara-bic. He proclaims it solemnly, with dramatic pauses, and the echo makes it sound likehe is speaking in an immense hall. The two sisters sit and listen, moved, awed. “Beau-tiful.” After a while, they turn the tape off.Earlier, Lamea has told me that translation of Mandaean texts into Arabic is forbid-den, but that it ought to be done, and preferably by three or four people together. Thesecrets of the Mandaeans are in the language, says Lamea. This sounds like an exhor-tation to let them remain secrets. What of all the translations of Mandaean texts intoEuropean languages (I myself am guilty of one)? “Never mind!” Lamea does not care todiscuss it. There seems to be some ambivalence on this point, but in the interest ofcultural and religious survival and promulgation of knowledge, translations should bedone, or so Lamea implies.The conversation returns to the state poet. Lamea tells me that she could have beenin that position, but she refused. “I don’t want to owe them anything.” I understand.I also learn that this cousin’s privileged position presents certain problems for theMandaeans. On the one hand, it is good to have one of their own in such a position,for it may protect the rest of the community in some sense; however, some see the manas being bought by the government.In 1973, ten years after Lamea was “killed,” she was called in to the president ofIraq, Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr. He was sitting with several of his ministers. “Do you knowwhy we wanted you to come?”“I don’t know.”“The people love you; we need you.”“I wish you had asked about me ten years ago,” Lamea replied softly.Past and PresentLamea recalls the house of her maternal grandfather, Sheikh Jawdat of Amara, beforethe Second World War. It was Sheikh Jawdat who gave her the texts that are now inher apartment. She makes a drawing for me. Around a central rectangular courtyard arearranged a diwaniyya (a sitting room for men); the shed for the cows and chickens; theouthouse; the tannur (the oven for bread baking); the kitchen, with high shelves out ofreach of the children, hanging clay containers for water, and an eating area for the win-tertime; and bedrooms. At the back, at one of the short ends, are a door and steps tothe outside. There is also a covered terrace. In the summer, the people eat outside inthe courtyard, near the garden with fruit trees and its central palm tree. As I listen andlook, I think back to the fall of 1973 and the house of Sheihk Abdullah Khaffagi, inAhwaz.“For thirty-six hours, at Dehwa Rabba, New Year’s, every Mandaean family locks thehouse and does not leave it,” Lamea tells me. In advance, they have surrounded the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"From Iraq to California: Grains of Musk29garden with a kind of temporary fence and have sent their cows to their Muslim neigh-bors. The cowshed is empty, for a specific reason: if any of the family women menstru-ate during those thirty-six hours, they are put there. Lamea remembers her sister sittingin the cowshed, being fed by her family.5Why the shut-up during the thirty-six hours? There are two explanations, says Lamea:one, it is a commemoration of a disaster; two, at New Year’s, for that day and a half, allthe natri (watchers) go up to the Lightworld. Therefore, the earth is left without protec-tion, without guardians, and it is dangerous to venture outside.6 People must not touchanything that grows during this time. Because the natri are off duty, only food that isalready secured and protected can be prepared and eaten within the household limits.The information about menstruous women is new to me, and I see it as an understand-able strategy in a challenging situation. Blood is, after all, usually impure. But becauseno Mandaean may go outside during this feast, the girl must be sequestered within aspecific area.The palm tree in the middle of the garden is of special importance at any time, notjust during the feast. Shamash, the sun, shows the time by the palm tree’s shadow,Lamea informs me. “Oh, it is time to milk the cow! It’s time to bake the bread!” Sheadds, “Without Shamash, there is no life. A house into which Shamash does not enteris a poor house. When he leaves at sunset, there is no ceremony, for without the sun,they cannot do any prayer.” Priests have long beards and hair in order to resembleShamash, says Lamea.What is up there; who is up there, of and among the heavenly bodies? After a while,I learn not to ask too many questions about the dead. It is a difficult problem forMandaeans in U.S. exile who, then still without priests, cannot have proper death ritu-als. In fact, my first question to Lamea was: How do you die in this country? Before Icame to San Diego, an elderly couple had returned to Iraq to die, despite the situationthere. No Mandaean had yet died in the San Diego community as of December 1993.But what will happen when someone does? Lamea says that she has a rasta (ritual gar-ment), and “the men will be hallalis [laymen who assist with the dead] and take care ofthe person.” Lamea points to a vase on the table and says, “I have myrtle for the klila[wreath].” In New York City, I hear, the Mandaeans rely on the Roman Catholic Churchand on the rental of grave plots. In San Diego, the local Chaldean priest has so farrefused to marry Mandaeans. This is a painful situation, as the Mandaeans feel close toChristianity.Early on in my relationship with Lamea, she still had her dream of a Mandaean cere-monial center in Florida. It was to be on a river, with a mandi (community center) and apriest: she envisioned baptisms, marriages, and ceremonies for the dead taking place there.So far, there are no such centralized solutions.7 I express my worry about the fate ofMandaean souls, where they might be now. But Lamea prefers not to talk about it, notbecause she does not worry but probably because the problem is so immense.In a related conversation, Lamea lays out her views on the soul and of afterlife. “Thesoul is never destroyed,” she begins, then describes paradise, the Lightworld, as a peace-ful place of abundant food, music, fresh breezes, and no need to communicate by talk-ing, for everybody knows what the others want. “There is a person like me waiting forme. She is waiting, very happy to embrace me when I come—I have a poem about it."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"30BeginningsHere, on earth, we live only temporarily, as in a prison; it is a suffering place. But weare going to a beautiful place. Everything and everybody have a heavenly counterpart;trees, too.”“Trees?” I interrupt. “How about this chair?”“Yes.”“Really?”“Yes, because you carry it in your imagination. You will carry it with you.” She con-tinues, “When you die, your soul goes back to its origin. The soul is given to the childby God. And at the end of life, the beginning becomes the end—like a big pot of water.The water always moves; it is a never-ending cycle.”The various names of God—El, Adonai, and the rest—are just names, but God isone, Lamea explains. I ask, “Are there women also?” “Yes, Simat Hiia!” She protectschildren and their mothers, like Astart (Astarte/Ishtar). As we discuss Ishtar, Lameainforms me that the gate of Babel was really the gate of Ishtar, and before that it was thegate of El. The gate is still there, and the temples of Hammurabi and Nebuchadnezzar,too. Both have been restored.Some years ago, I am told, the Iraqi government announced an award for the bestanswers to the question of how the famous hanging gardens of Babylon were watered.“Everybody started to think,” says Lamea. “Of course, in those days in Babylon, therewere no machines.” We ponder the engineering problem, and I suggest a line of a thou-sand people with buckets. “Perhaps,” Lamea replies, without much conviction. She pointsout that you need water only at certain times of the year. The government picked out200 answers as the best, but I forgot to ask whether they all got rewards.As I sit at the dining table for eight days transcribing priest lineages from Lamea’sbooks, I am doing my own kind of dipping into that vast Mandaean wellspring: thelists of names. Filling page after page, muttering names and comparing lineages, I some-times recognize a name and its lineage and exclaim, “Aha! I know him!” The familymembers come and go, peering at my work. Lamea writes up a report for her magazineon what I am doing. After I explain my work to Zaidoun, he says quietly, “May Mandad-Hiia help you!” I ask Shafia what these hundreds of priests in past generations wouldthink if they knew what I was doing. She has just been wondering about this, and shehas decided that they would be very pleased and bless me.Bowls of olives and cups of Postum break the work, and I try to keep a safe distancebetween any food or liquid and the sacred books. Guests wander by and throw a glanceat the text, asking, “You read that?” I feel a tinge of sacrilege handling the books, takingthem out of and wrapping them back into their cotton cloth bags, sifting the grains ofmusk that have been put into the bags to keep the books enveloped in the ruha d-Hiia,the breath of Life.I notice that Majid, on the evening when we watch his baptism video, reverentlyinhales the aroma of and kisses one of the Ginzas as it passes through his hands. Hesays he must be clean to handle it. I wonder about myself, and about my stepson, Jesse,who is with me on this occasion to meet the family and to take photographs. With afreshly hatched bachelor’s degree from the University of California at Berkeley’s an-thropology department, Jesse is allowed to see and handle the books. He marvels at theclash of cultures: while the rocker Cindy Lauper prances and sings on TV, he carefullyleaves through sacred scripture of an awesome kind."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"From Iraq to California: Grains of Musk31Priests and GoldsmithsLamea’s ancestor Sheikh Mohi is considered a saint by both Muslims and Mandaeans.He worked miracles, even after his death. Once he stopped a flood in the river al-Aqiqa,near Nasoriyah. The flood rose, people piled up sandbags, and the Muslims called ontheir holy men, but to no avail. Then they called on the name of Sheikh Mohi, and theflood stopped immediately. In gratitude, the Muslims built a saint’s memorial for him.Right after Sheikh Mohi died, his grieving sister tried to take the dust from his grave.Throwing herself on the grave, she became practically glued to it, and people tried invain to pull her away. When she finally got loose, she apologized to Sheikh Mohi forher excessive display of grief and promised to mourn for the dead in a more respectfulmanner. Lamea assures me that there were reliable eyewitnesses to this scene.I hear a story about a family quarrel, a priest lineage fight, many years ago. Lamea begins:When the ganzibra died, several men in the family wanted to take his place. One side ofthe family said, “It is our turn.” So, one of theirs became the ganzibra. But this was con-tested. It is forbidden for the Mandai to kill somebody, so the slighted side of the familygave money to an outsider to kill the new priest. But the stranger does not know who thepriest is, he only knows that his house is on the river. So, he waits for him nearby. Andthe sheikh appears, with a family member. As he is about to jump into a small boat, hiswife calls on her husband by name, “You forgot something!” Then the stranger knewwho he was, and he shot him with a big shotgun.Lamea pauses, looking at me intently. “Now you know that the man who was shotis a ganzibra. And he must not die with his blood. They change his white clothes, therasta, seven times. He is still bleeding. It is forbidden to die like this. And the rastamust be pure and white. With the eighth rasta, there is no blood, and he dies.”She continues. “The dead man’s brother swears and decides to kill somebody fromthat side of the family. He wears wool—very rough, instead of cotton—and he will wearit and not change it until he has avenged the murder. The people complain to the localsheikh of the Muslims, and the brother is put in jail. The heavy chains on hands andfeet, the big ball of iron, in a room without a window.“Because the prisoner is a priest, he is allowed to get food from his family. One ofhis cousins comes with food. The priest asks the boy to bring him a knife hidden in thefood, in the bread, a small knife. He gets it, digs through the night with the knife, throughthe wall, one meter thick. He puts his wool dress, his abaya, on his head, with the ironchain. It is winter. He crosses the river, the Euphrates, swimming. He comes to thesheikh of the other Muslim tribe, on the other side of the river, and he says to him,‘Dahilek! I am in your protection!’“The sheikh looks at him, sees the ball and chain, and notices that the abaya is notwet. It is early dawn, very cold—so, so cold. ‘The man who crossed the Euphrates with-out wetting his abaya, carrying the heavy chain and comes to me—nobody shall touchhim! I send all my men, no one shall kill such a man,’ says the sheikh. He asks, ‘Whatdo you want?’ ‘I want to go home.’Lamea explains to me that he had been in jail in another town. “They opened thechain on him. He had not eaten. They sent some men and a horse with him to takehim home."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"32Beginnings“Back there, he saw a dream. He saw his brother, the dead man, who said to him,‘Brother! Go to your normal life. Don’t avenge the murder. The sheikh (on the slightedside of the family) will never have sons who can become priests.’”Lamea stops for dramatic impact, then adds, “Till now, it’s true. Someone wasblind, handicapped, and nobody could become sheikh.” She continues, “’I will do itfor you,’ explained the dead man to his brother.” Finally, Lamea adds, “When thesheikh was killed, the women cut their long, long hair—their curls—and put them onlong strings at home, like Ishtar did when Tammuz died and Ishtar asked the womento cut their hair.”Mostly, it is outsiders, not insiders, who may present dangers to the Mandaeans.When Lady Drower tried to make contact with Lamea’s grandfather, Sheikh Jawdat,and his family, he warned them, “Don’t tell your secrets to the stranger!” Drower, some-what naively, felt that the Mandaeans should claim their own territory, as did theAssyrians, who in the 1930s rebelled in the north of Iraq, wanting their own state.“Very dangerous,” says Lamea.In the seventeenth century, the Portuguese military forced Mandaean men to domilitary service in the colonial wars. Coming to the Mandaean silversmith shops, thePortuguese asked who they were. They replied that they were followers of John the Baptist.A good number of Mandaeans were sent to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). Now we—Lamea,Shafia, and I—wonder what happened to the Mandaeans there. No one ever heard fromthese men again. We ponder whether they were absorbed into the Ceylonese popula-tion, converted, or whether any remained separate, all alone?“And why have you become a Mandai?” a Palestinian Christian friend of the familyasks me, inclining his head with a sincere expression. He is an elderly man, and wehave been invited to his house for a lavish dinner. He asks politely, with curiosity. “Iam not,” I reply. “It is not possible to convert, not permitted.” This is surprising newsto him. Lamea does not explain the matter; she just smiles. As we are about to eat,Lamea makes the sign of the cross. I ponder this. The next day I ask her about it. “Oh,I often do that. It cannot hurt. For example, on an airplane, I do it.”One evening we go to Majid’s to see a video of a very popular Baghdadi singer whorecently came to San Diego to entertain the Arabic community. Majid was one of thesponsors. Lamea and Shafia are riveted to the screen, while Zaki and Zaidoun watchwith expressions of interest mixed with critical distance. The slightly effeminate singerwears a yellow suit and, confident in his popularity, an expression half bashful, halfdefiant. Men in the audience come up to him while he is singing to shower him withmoney. He stands in a rain of green. In the car, on the way home, the singer’s meritsare hotly debated. I ask about music and dance, behaviors repudiated in traditionalMandaeism. No, Mandaeans are not entertainers.Still, Mandaeans dance. Majid has another video, this one of the party thrown forhim when he came back to Baghdad after fifteen years. Women are by themselves, talk-ing and smiling. The men dance, and Majid, looking happy, moves in the middle of agroup of them. The atmosphere is festive, Majid being treated as a long-lost son. “Theseare my relatives,” he lets me know as he points to the screen. “All of them?” I ask,incredulously. “Oh, these are just two hundred or so!” The dancing? “They have tobehave like Arabs when they party. Otherwise, it will be seen as a possible politicalclub—not good,” Lamea explains."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"From Iraq to California: Grains of Musk33Lamea, Shafia, and I form our own club of sorts. Lamea dubs the three of us “thegolden girls,” after the trio on TV. On a snack break while visiting Mandaean gold-smiths in the suburbs of San Diego, we are sitting in a shop that sells frozen yogurt. Wecompare our ages; I am the youngest. Lamea assures me, “When you are fifty, you’ll bepure; no more period.”I think of purity, food, and marriage. The young men we meet, the goldsmiths, aremarried to Mandaean women. The first time I met Lamea and her family, at the pot-luck dinner, a couple of strikingly pretty young mothers came with their babies. Babygirls wear tiny gold armlets and earrings. Gold is the metal of the soul, says ExaltedKingship. The danger of extinction does not seem imminent for the artisans of the younggeneration, although many think that the Mandaean identity will soon dissolve, mainlythrough intermarriage.The young goldsmiths seem to thrive. One, Zahir Ghanim, used to be a jewelry andgem buyer for the department store Marshall Fields in Chicago before he set up hisown business outside San Diego. On my first evening in San Diego, his wife presentsme with a fine pair of silver earrings. In Khalid’s newly opened shop, we wait by themirror-covered wall until the meaty, rich-looking Nestorian is finished with his Christ-mas purchases. He is in no hurry, sipping coffee from a styrofoam cup. After passing afan of green money across the counter, he leaves with a plastic shopping bag full ofgold. People from the Orient tend to support each other in business. While we wait, Isurvey the selection of religious merchandise. There is something for us all: curvy, elabo-rate gold pendants with Allah’s name for the Muslims, stars of David for the Jews, goldcrosses and demure Madonnas for the Christians, and Babylonian lions and gates ofIshtar for everybody.But in the small shop of an older man, Amjed Bahur, a real \u0001ustad, a craftsman, Ifeel transported back to Iran. Here is the kind of jewelry seldom seen—handmade, withstriking designs. Later, I learn that he is among the few here in America who knows theold, secret recipe for the Mandaean trademark in jewelry, which is the black dye, mina,used on silver to make miniature landscapes, marsh scenes with boats and palm trees,or abstract, geometric patterns. I admire a tiny, beautifully made gold dagger in its scab-bard and pull out the miniature weapon, not quite the length of my thumbnail. I recalla piece of jewelry I saw in a Mandaean shop in Ahwaz in 1973, a gold ring holding aperfect, tiny bull’s head, with horns, nostrils, eyes and all. Mr. Bahur gives me a bluefajence bead, just arrived from Baghdad. I wear it on a gold chain, alternating it with adrabša (Mandaean banner), a present from Majid. Later, when I meet Mr. Nasser Sobbiin New York, he gives me a silver drabša to keep on my key chain. Protective charmsare piling up.In October 1994, Lamea came to give a poetry reading at the Islamic Center in Sharon,Massachusetts. We dressed up and went, my husband and I, being among the fewWesterners at the event. Lamea looked regal, in a black chiffon gown with gold embroi-dery, and our gaze was drawn to her sparkling gold choker with a large ruby gem set atthe center of her throat. We sat at round tables, ate glorious Middle Eastern food, lis-tened to live music—tabla, oud, and qanoon—and engaged in conversations.Lamea’s performance was videotaped. She sat at a table on the stage with a youngwoman who read some of Lamea’s poetry in English translation, while other poems"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"34Beginningswere given in Arabic only. Looking intently at the audience and leaning toward themicrophone, Lamea cast a spell on all, and people clapped, laughed, sighed, or drew intheir breath sharply as if they had been stabbed—all according to the content of thepoems. An Iraqi woman at our table was overcome and had to run outside to cry. Duringbreaks, a gentleman looking like a retired Harvard professor walked around the roomhappily snapping his fingers. At the end, an elderly woman stood up and thanked Lamea,saying that the event had brought back her childhood memories of the Arab immigrantsto the United States. They used to spend evenings in each other’s homes reciting Ara-bic poems. “Why don’t we do that anymore?” she asked wistfully.Still breathing the atmosphere of poetry, people seemed reluctant to face the nightair outside."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"3ŠitilAn Example of “the Image Above and Below”35It was in Lamea’s house that I first became familiar with the coexistence of Mandaeanmythology, history, and the present day. We moved relatively effortlessly between hori-zons of time and space. The dynamics somehow resembled that of many Mandaeanmythological figures, those who travel between realms, hard to pin down, resistant tostasis.Scholars of Gnosticism have paid scant attention to the Mandaean Šitil. In his bookon Seth, A. F. J. Klijn offers only a one-page mention of him,1 and other investigatorsinterested in the scholarly construct called “Sethian Gnosticism” devote little space toŠitil.2 To me, it seems odd that an attempt to create a tradition history of Seth in hisGnostic permutations would bypass the Mandaean Šitil. As an emblem of the movableimage, he appears to cross divine-demiurgic-human boundaries.“In the name of Hibil, Šitil, and Anuš” is a recurring formula in Mandaean prayersand other texts. All three brothers are \u0001utras, sometimes seen as belonging in threedifferent generations. Less flashy than his two brothers, Šitil engages in no gloriousbattles or grand salvific schemes, such as Hibil does, nor does he become involved inhealing and preaching competitions with Jesus (one of Anuš’s specialties).And yet, Šitil is the purest of all souls. The souls of departed Mandaeans enter thescales of Abatur on their way to the Lightworld. Weighed against Šitil’s soul, which sitson the right side of the scales, an ascending soul is tested. If it is found to be as lightand as sinless as Šitil, the soul may continue unimpeded to the Lightworld on a ship oflight across the river that surrounds the world.3 If the soul is found wanting, it entersinto a suitable matarta for further purification.How did Šitil obtain this role as the purest of all souls? GL 1, 1, tells the story.4The section starts with a poem emphasizing the utter stability of the Lightworld and itsdenizens. Next, Hibil, Šitil, and Anus are held up as illustrious examples of such stabil-ity. They are Mandaeans—the text calls them “our brothers”—and at the same time their\u0001utra status is unmistakable. They give alms generously, and they remain unshaken inthe face of the trials and tribulations of the earthly world, Tibil, which is lit up by theirpresence."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"36BeginningsThe Great Life, the primary entity on the pinnacle of the Lightworld, dwelling in itsown splendor, ponders and decides that it is time for the death penalty, for the firstearthly man to ascend to his origins. Adam, the first man, is a thousand years old andought to return home before he becomes senile. Firm in its determination, the GreatLife summons the angel of death, 9auriel Qmamir Ziwa, “’Death’ he is called in theworld, but ‘Kušta’ (‘Truth’) by the knowledgable ones, those who know of him,” readsthe text.5 9auriel, who cannot be bribed and who accepts no substitutes, descends toAdam with the Great Life’s message. Adam becomes enraged, spits bitterness on theearth, and refuses to go. He screams, beats his breast, and insists that it is customary toeat the younger, tastier, green parts of a plant first, so why should he die now?The angel returns to the Great Life with the embarrassing report—which the Great Life,in its omniscience, already knows. The Great Life further strengthens its request to Adam,and 9auriel again descends with the message. Adam wants to live for another thousandyears and suggests a substitute: his youngest son, Šitil, who is only eighty, has never sleptwith a woman, consequently has no offspring, and is innocent of bloodshed. 9auriel trav-els back up with this report, and the Great Life agrees to take Šitil instead. The angel ofdeath calls to him, “O Šitil, son of Adam! Up with you! Die, as if you never existed, anddepart, as if you were never created! For your soul is wanted for the kana,6 by the greatfirst parental house, and by the place where she [i.e., the soul] formerly dwelled.”79auriel explains the matter of substitution to Šitil, who, though somewhat taken aback,dares not oppose the will of the Great Life and agrees to die instead of his father.In preparation for his ascent, Šitil prays and sheds his body of blood and flesh be-fore he puts on a garment of radiance and a turban of light. Gleaming more brilliantlythan the sun and the moon Šitil soars upward, taken by winds and storms up to acloud of light, where he prays, entreating the Lightworld beings to let his father, Adam,see the glories that he, Šitil, now beholds. He asks them to remove the blinders fromAdam’s eyes, the plugs from his ears, and the fleshy nature of his heart so that Adammay gaze at the upper world. Šitil’s wish is granted. Adam sees, is amazed, calls out tohis son, and wishes to die immediately.But he may not. Now Šitil takes a stern, rebuking role toward his father, declaringthat no one may decide on the hour of death. Šitil uses eloquent rhetoric. Nobodyswallows spittle already spat, he declares, and a fetus does not reenter the womb. Infact, Šitil claims to be such an untimely abortion, because he had to leave the earthprematurely, like an infant with its mouth full of milk, like a bride taken away duringthe wedding. Then, Šitil ascends further upward and at the end declares that the perfectpeople will imitate him by going on the same path that he has broken to the light.Thus, Adam’s young son becomes the first man to die and the first one to ascend tothe Lightworld from Tibil. One notes how the story changes the relationship betweenAdam and Šitil, for while the son is still on earth, he plays the role of obedient son, butwhen he has risen to the light, he scolds his father. The reversals upset the expectedpattern, for the first man, Adam, should be the first one to depart from the world. Despitethe assurances that 9auriel accepts no bribes or substitutes, just the opposite has takenplace, and the first death became the first vicarious death. Šitil’s purity above all otherhumans is ensured because he died instead of his father.It is also because of his death that the Mandaean tradition elevates him from humanto \u0001utra status. In this way, the GL story shows the conjunction of two different tradi-"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Šitil: An Example of “the Image Above and Below”37tions, one in which Šitil is human, and one in which he is an \u0001utra. However, we mightjust as well say that Mandaean texts assume a characteristic doubleness in Šitil. Thisdoubleness is the mark of the Mandaean idea of the dmuta, the image. Far from beinga merely abstract idea, the term dmuta conveys a dynamic relationship between the earthlyimage and its Lightworld counterpart. More precisely, the Lightworld image dwells inMšunia Kušta, the world of ideal counterparts, which is a specific section of theLightworld. The earthly image can only function insofar as it is energized by its dmutain the upper world.Everything, every human being and all \u0001utras, seems to have such an image. Whatone might expect of a given mythological figure characterized by great mobility dependson where that figure happens to be at any moment. Due to the dmuta, the figure’s iden-tity is constant, but the figure may show itself as positive or negative depending on lo-cation and on the company it keeps. There is an underlying Mandaean psychologicalidea at work here, for personality traits may vary, but the fundamental, dmuta-givenidentity remains constant. Therefore, one should proceed cautiously in assigning anyMandaean \u0001utras definite designations like “positive” or “negative.” It is all a matter ofcircumstances. Plots thicken if an \u0001utra usually encountered in unblemished Lightworldenvironments suddenly becomes entangled in world creation.Only rarely does Šitil turn up in cosmogonic settings. But one of the tractates inJohn gives a world creation myth featuring Hibil, Šitil, Ptahil, and Ayar (personifiedEther) as creators.8 Ptahil is the only figure one would expect to find in such a workcrew, for the three others are usually cast in roles of revealers and saviors, not as cre-ators. But here things are different. As Hibil builds up a moat, measures out the water,and divides it into channels, a fifth figure, Šihlaun, enters the work stage. He addressesHibil and Ayar, calling them “his brothers,” but he mocks their plans, listing all thethings they will be unable to perform correctly. After Šihlaun’s long harangue, Ptahil(usually the prototypical world creator) steps up and says to him:I will form the solidification, and Ayar shall hover over it. I will shovel away the blackwaters, and Hibil shall make a hollow for it.I will create the earth, and we shall bring the garment from \u0001Ur.9 Hibil and Šitil shallspread out the roof of the tent.10Šihlaun becomes enraged, strikes Ptahil, and curses him, literally saying, “Who do youthink you are?”Nevertheless, all the \u0001utras (except for Šihlaun) take their part in the creation, asPtahil proposed, and more. Šitil and Hibil create the hollow for the waters, and Šitilmakes the heavenly spheres. There are further details about the division of the con-struction, which is completed to satisfaction. Then arises the question of overseers, andthe sons of Yušamin11 are installed to watch over and light up the world. Somewhatsurprisingly, his sons are said to be the planets (at least in part), but they are not de-monized. Only after eighty years, when Yušamin’s sons tire of their job, are the realplanets brought in to take over their function.Several elements deserve comment in this story. One notes, first, that the \u0001utras arequarreling among themselves, that they are not battling against demonic forces. Thecreation itself is seen as a positive event. Only Šihlaun criticizes it, and he is silenced.The story looks like a spoof of the usual Gnostic pattern, according to which the creation"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"38Beginningsof the world is deplored. Even when the planets arrive to replace Yušamin’s sons, thereis no hint of any negative comment. The story illustrates the flexibility of the dmutaidea, for while \u0001utras are involved on earth—or in the realm of the-earth-to-be—they mayseem almost human, subject to emotions, hard at work with matter, and significantlyuntainted by it. Had they been portrayed within the geography of the Lightworld aslofty revealers, their personalities would have been displayed in a different manner.In descending order, the three main Mandaean creator \u0001utras usually are Yušamin,Abatur, and Ptahil. All three have complex double personalities, which are negative orpositive depending on where they show up, what they are doing, and how the givenmyth evaluates their actions. Because of the Mandaean ambivalence regarding creation,one can find creation myths where the act is positive, negative, or undecided in termsof worth. The exuberant wealth of different Mandaean creation myths demonstrates aparticular point: that these are worth telling over and over, in manifold varieties. Con-sequently, the evaluation of the actors in these myths also varies.Yušamin is both a Lightworld \u0001utra beyond reproach and the prototype of a priestwho has made mistakes in ritual. As such he is called Yušamin the Peacock, character-ized by his excessive pride. Abatur is Abatur Rama, “the Lofty,” and also d-Muzania,“of the Scales,” which refers to his detested job as guardian of the scales, where soulsare weighed. Abatur was forced into this job as punishment for his involvement in thecreation, and he will have to continue in this position, though complaining bitterly,until the end of the world. Ptahil, insufficiently instructed by his father, Abatur, in howto create the world (according to one myth), suffers for his mistakes. All three are jailedin separate matartas for the duration of the earth.Usually the triumvirate Hibil, Šitil, and Anuš are portrayed as saviors less than ascreators. But the story in John serves to warn readers not to draw fast, facile conclusionsbased on expectations of creator versus savior \u0001utras. If the creation, as in this ratherunusual myth, is not a problem, the creators in it may escape unscathed. However, Šitilalways seems to be above reproach, for in no story, that I know, does he become tainted.His purity and vicarious death in the GL story show a rare human being, virtually sinless.Unlike some other \u0001utras, for instance, his older brother Hibil,12 Šitil never complainslike a lost Gnostic soul on earth.It is interesting to contemplate Abatur, as the personified scales, whose position asjudge might otherwise seem a powerful one. But in the Mandaean view, Abatur’s posi-tion is a form of punishment, a thankless, contemptible task. One is invited to imagineAbatur tortured by his job of weighing souls, constantly forced to behold the spotlessŠitil in the right scale, constantly reminded of his own lost purity. Šitil is, of course,superior to everyone, including his own father. 1012 stresses Šitil’s unique position,stating that Šitil represents the soul, vision, and the yardna, while Adam is body andblood, darkness of the eyes, and earth.13 Further exalting Šitil, the text calls him “fatherof mysteries and of all kings, and father of souls, (and) of constructed things.”14According to Mandaean teaching, there are four world ages, and each one has aLightworld guardian and a human couple as caretakers. Each world epoch ends in de-struction, by epidemics, fire, and water. We are now living in the last, evil age, super-vised by the \u0001utra Anuš and by Noah with his wife. When this age has spent itself, theworld will finally be annihilated. Šitil guarded the second age, and it was under hisleadership that the true Naƒoraeism (naƒiruta, i.e., the priestly-level knowledge in"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Šitil: An Example of “the Image Above and Below”39Mandaeism) established itself.15 From what we have seen of Adam’s career in the GLstory, it is no wonder that his guardianship over the first world age was seen as less thanperfect. The son, rather than the father, is the measure of perfection.16Still, Adam possesses two sides, for Mandaean texts testify both to an Adam Kasia,“the hidden Adam,” who is a Lightworld being, and to the earthly one, Adam Pagra,the bodily Adam. Šitil, son of Adam—despite this appellation—is the same as Šitil, the\u0001utra.17 The striking difference in the portrayal of the two figures, Adam and Šitil, isthat no hint of negativity appears regarding the latter.Adam and Šitil both have masiqtas (death-masses) named after them. Mandaeismhas many kinds of masiqtas.18 A masiqta of Šitil is required at specific unclean deaths.These include: for a priest who dies without his tiny myrtle wreath (klila); for a womanwho dies on or after the seventh day after childbirth; or for anyone dying during thethirty-six hours of seclusion on New Year’s Eve.19 In the case of someone dying in oneplace and being buried in another, both the masiqta of Adam and the one of Šitil arerequired.20 There is also a specific baptism of Šitil, obligatory for a defiled priest, forone who has unwittingly officiated at a marriage in which the woman was not a virgin,and at a baptism of an infant who died during the proceedings.21 One notes that in thebaptism examples, the specified pollution concerns the priest, not the person for whomthe ritual is performed.The references to Šitil in the particular instances of the two major Mandaean rituals,masiqta and baptism, may be quite incidental to the topic of Šitil himself. Or it may bethat the impurities requiring his masiqta are considered to be particularly severe. In anycase, Šitil’s main role is that of \u0001utra, and he marks the ideal of purity because of hisdeath, as told in the GL story. I have presented him here as an example of the dynamicworkings of the idea of the dmuta (the image above and below). Being undeniably “good,”Šitil, whether in his human or in his Lightworld aspect, possesses traits associated withboth realms, and his duality does not run along a predictable “good-evil” axis. As acontrast to Šitil, I will in the next chapter present another double-sided figure, Ruha.Much more dramatic than Šitil—and, unlike him, much maligned—Ruha plays a deci-sive role in the creation of the world. In a marked departure from most traditional treat-ments of Ruha, I concentrate on her ambiguous aspects, even leaning toward her posi-tive traits."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"40Beginnings4Ruha40Mandaeism presents Ruha (Spirit) largely as a leader of the forces of darkness opposingthose of the Lightworld. Traditionally, most scholars have labeled her as evil, and it istrue that she possesses abundant negative traits. One of her epithets is Ruha d-Qudša(Holy Spirit), a devalued Christian Holy Spirit, it seems. A mistress of the detested Jew-ish god Adonai, Ruha is also the mother of the malignant zodiac spirits and of theplanets.Still, there are good reasons to see Ruha as a fallen wisdom figure, resembling Sophia(Wisdom) in other Gnostic traditions. Mandaean materials testifying to such a view ofRuha include passages in which she speaks and behaves in ways one would not expectof a force hostile to the Lightworld. She displays dramatic mood swings, suffers, andutters revelatory speeches uncharacteristic of a figure of darkness. Instead of seeing thesepassages as atypical occurrences thwarting a scholarly, imposed negative pattern, I thinkit is useful to take them as clues to Ruha’s own ambivalence and to her ambiguouspersonality. This chapter, therefore, offers a sustained examination of the stories in whichRuha appears as ambiguous or in a downright positive light. Four sets of mythologicaltraditions, taken from a variety of texts, will serve to illustrate my point.Hibil Ziwa’s Descent into the UnderworldGR 5, 1, tells a long, dramatic story of the \u0001utra Hibil Ziwa (Radiance) traveling to theunderworld.1 Before the creation of the earthly world, Tibil, disturbing rumors reachthe Lightworld, for underworld forces plan to wage war against the Light. Hibil is sentout on a mission to find out whose plan it is and to prevent the attack. Descendingfrom the Lightworld, the well-equipped Hibil begins a long and dangerous journey downthrough the lofty spheres and the spaces of what is not yet Tibil, to the seven under-worlds. In the first of those seven worlds, he encounters Ruha. The text gives no infor-mation as to why she is there or whether this is indeed her home. Hibil stays with Ruhafor a thousand myriad years, though hidden from her view. Then he continues down-ward through the worlds, accomplishing his task of subjecting the dark forces in each"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Ruha41of those regions. At the bottom, he vanquishes the great flesh mountain, Krun, whosedigestive system is destroyed as Hibil, clad in a suit of armor full of knives, sabers andsharp points, hurls himself into his mouth.2After Hibil has forced Krun to give him a kind of passport containing mystical pow-ers, Hibil turns his way upward. Just before he reaches Ruha’s world again, he stealstwo objects that contain the strength of the darkness: mrara ugimra, (bitterness and jewel).Invisible, he arrives in Ruha’s world as she is about to be married to her brother, thedemon Gaf. Disguised as a demon, Hibil impresses Qin, Ruha’s mother, who giveshim her other daughter, Zahriel, in marriage. But the \u0001utra does not consummate themarriage nor touch the demons’ food. He tricks Qin into revealing certain darknesssecrets to him, secrets hidden in a mirror. Stealing the mirror, Hibil disguises himselfas Ruha’s husband, Gaf, faces her, and proclaims, “Up! We will travel to your par-ents!” She is surprised and asks where the parents are. Hibil says that they live in theworld just above.3This is a remarkable exchange, for it implies that Ruha’s real parents are not thoseshe imagined. Of course, Hibil may be lying. He forsakes Zahriel and takes Ruha up-ward, and a kafkaesque journey ensues. Ruha is anxious, for the journey seems endless,and Hibil’s answers to her questions remain unenlightening. Furthering Ruha’s des-peration, Hibil does not bring her to her parents but, having locked the doors of theunderworld behind him, imprisons Ruha in a world of her own. Here she spends myriadsof years, pregnant by Gaf with \u0001Ur, the dragon monster. On and off, Hibil visits her,only to confuse her even more. Now it seems that Hibil’s parents are hers, too, andHibil says that they do not want to see him, their own son. Utterly bewildered, Ruhacurses the parents but yearns for them, too.In another text, Hibil explains why Ruha, at this stage, is unfit to see her parents,“How can we rise up towards my Parents, when these creatures that I brought are notlike Us, nor is their appearance radiant like that of the uthras, the children of light? MyParents will not now desire to have them in Their presence!”4 To continue with GR5,1: Ruha hopes that her dragon son will be able to free her from her misery, but shehas to wait. Hibil pays her another tactical visit, and before she gives birth to \u0001Ur, Hibil’sfather in the Lightworld commends the actions of the Light forces, declaring, “Had wenot done this and had you not organized things, we would have been unable to copewith \u0001Ur and his mother.”5 It is clear that Ruha and her son must be kept under strictcontrol.Haran Gawaita speaks of four creations, two male and two female, that Hibil carriedaway from the underworld,6 and 1012 identifies the “egg” (hilbuna), Ruha, with “bitter-ness and jewel,” stating that the power of the darkness was lacking from the day thatHibil carried away the hilbuna.7 Ruha, then, is the entity incorporating the powers ofdarkness, which the Lightworld had to conquer. Her world of imprisonment is called“the world of Lacking,”8 and here she must dwell until the creation of the earthly worldbegins to unfold.\u0001Ur wonders why Ruha’s parents seem to close the door in the face of their owndaughter, and Ruha herself is stricken by doubt, “Am I such a one?—I am searchingand pondering everything.”9 Mother and son desperately try to escape, but to no avail.Finally, Ruha shows her son a magic mirror in which he beholds the upper and lowerworlds. Now he feels a great yearning to fight the Light that he has seen in the mirror."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"42BeginningsBut Ruha has drawn different conclusions from the vision in the mirror, and she urgeshim to wage war against the darkness instead.10Hibil now appears and wrests the mirror from Ruha, who bewails her loss, feelingher powers of sorcery and magic waning. Hibil then defeats \u0001Ur and chains him. Motherand son lament his fate, but Hibil consoles Ruha, emphasizing that \u0001Ur, not Ruha, ishis enemy. He tells Ruha to remain where she is. It is interesting that Hibil does notintend to destroy Ruha. He obviously has other plans for her; otherwise it would seemstrange that he brought her up from the underworld. So, still stuck in her limbolikeworld, Ruha stays put, awaiting further notice of possible liberation.The Creation of Tibil and of the Human BeingsDrower observes that “the visit of Hibil Ziwa to the world of darkness resulted eventu-ally in the creation of the material world and of humanity.”11 Hibil’s removal of Ruhafrom the underworld indicates that this is not her proper place and that she incorpo-rates certain powers necessary for the next stage of development, the creation of theworld and of people, both of which will possess some of her essence, the spirit. This iswhy she is such a crucial figure in what follows.In GR 3, a large creation account, we find a description of the interactions betweenPtahil and Ruha, the two main agents in the world’s creation. Uneasy as collaborators,each strives to remain in charge, and when Ptahil feels his strength subside, Ruha swellsin hers. Ptahil has come down from the Lightworld to play his role as creator, but al-ready on leaving his lofty home, he anxiously senses how the “living fire” in him abates.Unsettled, he asks, “As I am a son of the Great One, why has the living fire in mechanged?”12Ruha and \u0001Ur are still jailed,13 but now mother sleeps with son in order to liberatehim. After seven days she bears the seven planets, whose aspect displeases her: “I re-quested, but it was not given to me; what I wanted did not come about; none of themresembles the others.”14Meanwhile, Ptahil is doing his best to create the earth, but he fails, for it will notsolidify.15 Ruha observes his failure, sleeps with \u0001Ur again, and produces the twelvezodiac spirits. But they are not what she hoped for, and again she laments, wishing thatthey would have looked like Ptahil. Events roughly repeat themselves for a third time,Ruha now giving birth to the five planets (sun and moon not included). She dislikesthem and complains that she has lost her sorcery powers. Furthermore, the sexual activ-ity has failed to liberate \u0001Ur, too. So far, then, GR 3 has emphasized both Ptahil andRuha as unsuccessful creators.The next project is the creation of the first human being. The planets and Ptahilmanage to create Adam, but he cannot stand up on his two feet, for the powers of hiscreators are insufficient. The lacking element is the soul, which Ptahil and the planetsare unable to supply. Only after the soul has come from the Lightworld does Adamstand up. But according to 1012, the soul came accompanied by the evil spirit into manfrom the Lighworld, and this spirit introduced deceit, falsehood, and excitability intothe body. The text states that this was permitted, “so that the Soul should not dominateher (the earthly spirit).”16 We see here an example of the ambiguity in the view of soul"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Ruha43versus spirit and also note the Mandaean tripartite anthropological model. It is interest-ing to observe that, according to 1012, Ruha’s elemental correlate, the spirit, arrivesfrom above. Indeed, another tradition in 1012 says, “For when the Body was formed,a Soul (nishimta) was formed, and when the Spirit took shape in the Body, the Bodyformed the Vital Spirit (ruha).”17In one GR myth Ptahil says to Ruha and her angels that he will create his image asman, Adam, and Ruha’s image as woman, Hawa (Eve).18 Ruha is found worthy to bethe pattern for the female. But when Adam dies, Ruha tempts Hawa into noisy mourn-ing for him19—behavior strongly repudiated in Mandaeism, even today, for ascent intothe Lightworld is cause for happiness, not sorrow. Far from rejoicing, Ruha complainsat Adam’s death, because he, as soul carrier, is now lost to her. She says, “Woe untome! For I did not know about their treasures, which I yearned for.”20 The “treasures”indicate the soul and its capacity to return to the Lightworld, an ability that Ruha lacks.When it is time for Hawa to die, Ruha shows her attachment to the first woman:“Why are you leaving life, you noble one, and leave the house without masters? Whereshall we go and in what shall we trust?”21 Hibil comes to lead Hawa out of earthly life,and Ruha wails, “You take away from us everything desirable, and what is worthless,you leave behind for us.”22 Ruha clearly has knowledge of what is valuable, and shesounds like a Gnostic with a troubled conscience.In GR 3 Ruha seduces the young Adam, son of Adam, disguised as his wife. Surpris-ingly, she teaches him about the origin of the separate sexes, saying that if there was noimbalance, they would have been created as one mana (vessel), but because there isimbalance, “they have made you a man and me a woman.”23 The unavoidable imbal-ance is due to the involvement of the planets and the fallen \u0001utra (Ptahil) in the creationof mankind. It is remarkable that Ruha here plays the revealer, while young Adam re-ceives the epithet “lying prophet.”The tension between the two natures, male and female, is rendered in the dramaticimagery of rape in 1012. The earth (elsewhere identified with Ruha) cries out to themale principle, the yardna, the living, running water coming from the Lightworld, “Donot penetrate me!”24 At the same time, because of the positive emphasis on fertility, itis clear that this overpowering is legitimate, even desirable. The Lightworld water rusheddown, spoke to the earth, and “clothed all of her [the earth’s] mysteries, covering heraridities with green foliage. And her baser mysteries he drew upwards, he steadied herbabbling tongues, cleared her vision and turned the spheres.”25 This myth seems topartake of ancient mythological traditions regarding the Mesopotamian flood seasons.Elsewhere in 1012, Ruha is explicitly identified with the earth, who upholds andkeeps to herself all life:Behold this fair body that was nurtured by her! (At death?) she encloseth it and consumethit and maketh it as if it had never existed. And all the kindly mysteries which she pro-duces and tends—like oil for a lamp—eventually she turns on and devours them with teethof wrath. This is the Earth of the Parents: She raised up physical life and she is the GreatMother, from whom all swarming creatures, burgeonings and increase proceeded and (byher) were maintained.26The “Great Mother” takes up considerable space in some of the speculative portionsof 1012. In Exalted Kingship, she also appears, for here the candidates for priesthood"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"44Beginningsadmit that they have been nurtured in earth’s, Ruha’s, lap, but they stress that theirfather is the Pure Ether in the Lightworld. In their long and complex initiation ritual,these priest candidates symbolically pass from the Mother to the Father, that is, fromearth to Lightworld, in their preparation for full priesthood.27It is now clear why Hibil brought Ruha up from the underworld, for her presencewas needed at the creation, which, though imperfect, still found no objection in theLightworld. Externally, Ruha is earth, and within human beings, the middle element,the spirit wobbling between body and soul. Her nature is unavoidably ambiguous, andthe varied portraits of her do not mean that the Mandaeans contradict themselves, butthat they admit her problematic nature and never cease pondering it. Earth and humanbeings alike are unthinkable without her. Up above, the planets and the zodiac spiritshave her as their origin. Her own home is originally in the Lightworld, and one ques-tion is whether she, like a good Gnostic, has any chance of salvation. But first let melook at her relationships with some of the \u0001utras.Ruha and the \u0001UtrasIn command of her seven planetary sons, Ruha sets out to build the city Jerusalem.28Anuš \u0001Utra warns her that 360 Mandaean disciples (or priests) will arise in the cityif she erects it. She tries to build her city in several places, but Anuš puts a curse onthe plan each time. Finally, Ruha erects Jerusalem’s seven pillars, and the Jews thrive.From a lofty vantage point Anuš first watches the events and then makes his waydownward to the city, where he preaches and converts some of the people to Mandaeism.The enraged Jews kill the offensive believers, and Anuš intends to destroy the city inretaliation.Through much of this tale, Ruha seems evil and hostile to the Mandaeans. But thingsbecome more complex, for the text asks repeatedly, in a lamenting tone, how Ruha couldhave obtained the information that Anuš would thwart her plans. There is obviouslysome ambivalence here, for the \u0001utra did speak to her, while, at the same time, the storyseems to deplore this. I take this wavering to indicate a recognizable problem in Gnos-tic texts: when an evil figure obtains information from saviors, one suspects either thatthe evil one is eligible for salvation or that there will be an attempt at collaborationbetween the dark and the light force.In this case it is the latter, for when Anuš arrives in Jerusalem, Ruha knows that shewill lose unless she can work out a compromise with him. As Anuš begins his demoli-tion work, Ruha bows down to him, pleading, “By your life, Anuš-\u0001utra! Do not destroythis place Jerusalem, which I have built!”29 He does not listen, and the frightened Jewstry to hide. Ruha suddenly switches sides, turns against her Jewish subjects, and offersto help Anuš: “Please! Give me permission! I will bring down the gates of the wallsupon them [the Jews] so that they die on the spot. The Jews who sinned against yourdisciples [or: ‘priests’] shall be killed.”30 Infuriated, Anuš refuses any collaboration, andhe single-handedly puts an end to the city.In another Ginza tradition, Ruha asks Hibil who his creator is and how he, Hibil,will ascend to the Lightworld.31 He tells her, which amounts to giving her the gnosis!And Ruha launches into an admonishing speech that would better suit Hibil:"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Ruha45The Naƒoraeans who wear a perverted garment shall not ascend. The Naƒoraeanswho testify to money and possessions shall not ascend. . . . All souls that do evil willbecome thin like a hair on the head. Whoever denies the name of Life shall die a sec-ond death. He will die a second death, and his stature will become dark and will notshine.32Not unlike Anuš in GR 15, Hibil reacts violently. He hits Ruha with a bolt of radianceand takes away her power. She is obviously not yet eligible for Lightworld collaboration.Elsewhere, Ruha tries to bribe Hibil and asks him to sing and preach to her. Herefuses brusquely, saying that he is no music-making gypsy: “I am a man from the otherworld! I am an iron shoe whose word and song are cudgels and clubs for evil spirits!”33Surprisingly, Ruha replies by blessing Hibil: “Well then! May the Truth preserve you,you good one, and preserve the word that you have spoken!”34In one of the Mandaean prayers for a specific weekday, in this case Tuesday, Ruharecognizes an \u0001utra as someone coming from above. Still, she wishes that he had nevercome into the corruption and falsity of this world and that her eyes had never seen him.He answers that her eyes are those of falsehood, but that if she wishes to see the truth,she must go to the house of those who know him.35 Ruha’s ambivalence is intriguing.She bewails the fate of the \u0001utra while she remains in a state of error, but she obtainsguidelines for his gnosis. So, in this prayer, every Tuesday for nearly 2,000 years now,the priests express the yearnings of the ambivalent human spirit.No other allegedly “evil” being in Mandaeism speaks so consistently like a Gnostic.Ruha reveals knowledge properly belonging to pious believers or to \u0001utras. Why doesRuha have the gnosis, and who instructed her? The question was raised repeatedly in aplaintive part of the long poem GR 15, 11, as seen earlier. There, Anuš clearly had warnedRuha in advance. In John, the elevated \u0001utra Manda d-Hiia (Knowledge of Life) and alsoan \u0001utra named Gubran are said to have instructed Ruha in the gnosis, and this hascaused consternation in the Lightworld.36 Considering that it is dangerous to instructreportedly evil figures in the secrets of the Lightworld, one wonders about the saviors’motives for doing so. As a preliminary answer, one may conclude that Ruha increas-ingly resembles a malfunctioning Gnostic, and that this is why she appears as a candi-date, however reluctant, for salvation.Ruha’s Self-Revelations and Identifications with LightbeingsGR 6 tells the wondrous story of Dinanukht, half man, half book, who sits between thewaters, reading in himself.37 Diƒai, another, smaller book, comes to him and speaksdisturbing, prophetic words. Dinanukht tries to burn and drown the intruder, but tono avail. After Diƒai repeats his message, Dinanukht leaves him alone and falls asleep.Suddenly, he has a vision:Then came Ewat, the Holy Spirit, to me in my dwelling and said to me, “Why are youlying there, Dinanukht? Why do you like to sleep? I am the Life that was from thebeginning. I am the Truth (kušta) which existed even earlier in the beginning. I amradiance; I am light. I am death; I am life. I am darkness; I am light. I am error; I am truth.I am destruction; I am construction. I am light; I am error. I am blow; I am healing.I am the elevated man who is older and who was there before the builder of heaven"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"46Beginningsand earth. I have no peers among kings, and there is as yet no crown in my kingdom.There is no human being who can give me a message in the foggy clouds of darkness.”38Ewat is Ruha, and, in part, her self-declaration has already been spoken by Diƒai.The little book started by saying, “There is a Life that was from the beginning, andthere is Truth that was there even earlier in the beginning.”39 The speech that sodisturbed Dinanukht is now confirmed by Ruha’s revelatory proclamation. One notesthat Ruha says that she is the oppositions (and more), while Diƒai merely testifiedto her existence. This is cosmic speech, a declaration of a figure inhabiting centraloppositional Mandaean categories.40 Ruha also defines herself as a preexistent malefigure.Immediately, Dinanukht begins an ascent to the upper worlds. He passes through thematartas, and in the third one he meets its ruler, who is Ruha herself, now appearing asa seductress. In the last tollhouse, the world of Abatur, Dinanukht beholds the opposi-tions proclaimed by Ruha. That world is the storage place for the dichotomies, and it alsohouses the pre-existent souls not yet sent to earth. Dinanukht would like to ascend be-yond Abatur’s realm to the Lightworld itself, but further access is denied him. He mustreturn to earth to preach his vision, which distresses him, but he complies. Back home,Dinanukht acts so strangely that his wife, Nuraita, accuses him of insanity.41The central message in GR 6 is the sets of dichotomous, yet complementary, ele-ments that are Ruha. She is everywhere: on earth, in the preexistent world, and in thethird matarta. The question remains whether she inhabits the Lightworld, too.John contains a brief story in which Manda d-Hiia visits the underworld (a themerecalling Hibil’s visit there, in GR 5, 1).42 A female figure approaches Manda d-Hiia inthe world of Gaf. She carries several names, but all are compounds of Nitufta (“cloud”or “drop”), a frequent title or name for female Mandaean Lightworld entities. The storydescribes her emerging, “from the inner habitations . . . from the howling darkness . . .and the black water came out, too, and [she] arrived at the seven walls that enclose theearth Siniawis.”43 For sixty-two years she sits at the outer wall until the scent of the Lifesettles and a messenger appears, inviting her to rise upward to the Life who loves her.Because of her underworld associations, there are good reasons to identify Nitufta withRuha, and to see this story as a closure to that of GR 5, 1, where Hibil left Ruha in alimbo world. Ruha has now found mercy with the Lightworld.Abatur gives several names for Ruha, and some of them are the same as in the Johnstory.44 In addition, she is identified with her underworld mother, Qin, an identifica-tion that also occurs in 1012. Here, an instructor teaches that Hibil is light and Qin(Ruha) is darkness: “Between them I cast strife, (yet) their voice is one, degrading oruplifting, urging to good or to evil. . . . Good and Evil . . . I mingled together, for theyare living waters and turbid water; they are life and death. Error and truth . . . woundand healing . . . they are spirit and soul.”45Ruha’s sign is that of “the Left,”46 of the spirit (as opposed to the soul). 1012 explains,“Behold, Light and Darkness are brothers. They proceeded from one Mystery. . . . Wereit [the body] not marked with the mark of Darkness, it would not be established, norcome forward for baptism and be signed with the Sign of Life [the sign of ‘the Right’].”47This means that the deficient sign of the spirit is a prerequisite for liberation. To live thetemporary life ruled by Ruha is a necessary step toward eligibility for the Lightworld."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Ruha47In Abatur, Hibil tells Ptahil that Ruha and her creatures are completely subdued andthat the seal of Life has been placed upon them.48 This implies nothing less than salva-tion, and it seems more inclusive than the information in GR 5, 1, where Hibil assuredRuha that it was \u0001Ur, not Ruha, who evoked the Great Life’s anger.Part of a very long prayer in the Prayerbook compares the blessing given to thosecommemorating their dead with the blessing bestowed on Simat Hiia (Treasure ofLife), who is usually the wife of the \u0001utra Yawar Ziwa but at times is identified withRuha. The prayer refers to Simat Hiia’s rising out of the worlds of darkness. She iscalled the bride of her liberator, the \u0001utra, who remains impure from his infernal trav-els and cannot be cleansed “until Simat Hiia arose.”49 So, the liberator needs hispartner to rise up before he is eligible for the Lightworld again. The tables seem turnedin comparison to GR 5, 1, for the female now, in Prayerbook, prayer 376, possessesmuch more strength.A lengthy prayer of praise, prayer 75, includes Ruha’s lament:My Father, my Father,Why didst Thou create me? My God, my God,My Allah, why hast thou set me afar offAnd cut me off and left me in the depths of the earthAnd in the nether glooms of darknessSo that I have no strength to rise up thither?50The last part of this echoes the end of Ruha’s self-proclamation in GR 6. It is importantto note that this lament does not occur in isolation but belongs in a section of the prayerwhere the evil powers are overcome by the Lightworld and offer praises to it.Ruha covers a remarkable range of “geographic” as well as emotional territory. Hibilbrought her up from the infernal world so that she would, in time, make life possiblein and on the earth. “Ruha is the breath of life in the created world, and our breath isfrom her, “ says one of Lady Drower’s informants.51 Then, at creation, Ruha displayshighly ambivalent behavior toward her offspring and toward the \u0001utras. Her allianceswaver, but she clearly yearns for gnosis and does obtain it. Her self-revelation and iden-tifications with Lightworld figures show that her real home is, indeed, in the Lightworld.Curiously, in comparison to other Gnostic myths, it is precisely the typical “fallen Sophia”story that is lacking in Mandaeism, for as far as I know the Mandaean texts at present,there is no myth that explains her appearance in the netherworld.As “generic” spirit, Ruha reflects a Mandaean’s own vacillation between ignoranceand gnosis, and as an autonomous mythological figure, she engages in equally unbal-anced behavior. Until the material world perishes for lack of believers, Ruha rules andimpersonates the earthly world, caught between light and darkness. But at the end, shewill be due for redemption, in accordance with Hibil’s promise to her in GR 5, 1.The notion of the dmuta, as presented in chapter 3, helps to explain the variationsin Ruha’s character. As a feature of Mandaean dualistic thought, the dmuta also im-plies an inherent dynamics, as opposed to a static dualistic schema. Such an activeprinciple effectively undercuts any expectations one might have regarding “predict-able” behavior in a figure deemed to be “good” or “evil.” The Mandaean tripartiteanthropological model of soul, spirit, and body also, in its particular way, breaks anystolidly dualistic interpretive mold. “What . . . the middle beings were to ‘mediate’"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"48Beginningswas precisely the realization of an otherwise merely abstract dualism,” says Jonas aboutmediating figures in Gnosticism.52 That is, without mediation a mythological dual-ism remains dead, inert.In the next chapter, I shall present a female figure quite different from Ruha: Miriai,Jesus’ mother. By using her, Mandaeans engage in polemics against Judaism and to alesser extent against Christianity. To serve Mandaean, internal purposes, the religionelevates Miriai to a remarkable degree. If Ruha as “Holy Spirit” represents a sort ofborrowing in which ambiguous and mainly negative traits predominate, Miriai exem-plifies a loan for very different ideological reasons."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"5Miriai49Several Mandaean texts feature Miriai, a young Jewish woman who converts to Mandaeism.Whether there is any historical core linking Miriai to Jesus’ mother remains an openquestion. In any case, her name indicates that, at least in some of the Mandaean tradi-tions, she is the mother of Jesus. Only in a few places is the Muslim name Mariamused for her.1 In most traditions she is portrayed as an altogether positive figure, andher associations with Jesus are absent. It is a puzzle why she appears in Mandaean textsat all, and her presence raises the issue of the possibility of a brief, Christian stage inearly Mandaeism.2 At the very least, one must assume that the Mandaeans early onknew some of the Christian traditions about Mary.In this chapter, I show how the Mandaeans present Miriai in their mythologies. Asnoted in chapter 1, Haran Gawaita gives the Mandaean migration legend. Even thoughMiriai does not appear in this legend, she still has her own part in the Mandaeancommunity’s earliest “history.” Mysteriously, Haran Gawaita says of her:And [the Mandaeans] loved the Lord, that is, Adonai, until in the House of Israel therewas created something which was not placed [i.e., was placed by unnatural means] in thewomb of Mary, a daughter of Moses [miša]. It was hidden in her womb for nine monthsand bewitched her until the nine months were fulfilled and she was in labor and broughtforth a messiah [mšiha].3This seems to mean that the Mandaeans were “good Jews” until the birth of Jesus.The pregnancy results from witchery, which exonerates the woman. The use of the nameMiriai is instructive, for one might have expected the more negatively tinged Mariam.Punning on the similarity between Miša (which also means “oil”) and mšiha, the textemphasizes the connection between Judaism and the emerging Christianity.4 HaranGawaita juxtaposes two pregnancies, for a bit further on in the text Elizabeth (\u0001Nisbai)is presented. In contrast to Miriai, \u0001Nisbai became pregnant by a pure seed, and shebrings forth the Mandaean hero and prophet, John the Baptist.5Even if the resulting infants are placed in opposition to one another, the two womenare not. The Mandaeans must have known about the ties between the two women,perhaps from sources such as the “Gospel of Luke” and the Christian infancy gospels."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"50BeginningsHowever, in John things take a decidedly Mandaean turn, with Miriai figuring promi-nently in a migration legend different from the one in Haran Gawaita. For in John sheis associated with Mandaean female Lightworld beings and even becomes a priest. Inyet another context, in a section of the weekly Mandaean liturgy, an anti-Jewish polemi-cal story is told in which Miriai converts from Judaism to Mandaeism.Miriai in JohnFirst, let me turn to the two lengthy John traditions about Miriai. These sections appearin sequence,6 and in the first one Miriai states that she is the daughter of kings in Babel.7(This city is often conflated with Jerusalem in Mandaean texts, and, in view of the sub-stantial Jewish population in Babylon in the early Christian centuries, the confusion isunderstandable.) Carried at a tender age in the priests’ robes into the temple, Miriai isthen raised by these priests and compelled to perform harsh work for Adonai there.8After what seems like a break in the story, Miriai is suddenly at her parents’ home,where her father prepares to go to the synagogue (bit ama) and her mother to the Jewishtemple (mqadšia). Before they leave, both warn Miriai against stepping outside, lest therays of the sun fall on her.Of course, Miriai ventures out, the sun rays affect her, and despite her best inten-tions to follow her father to the synagogue, her feet take her to the Mandaean temple(maškna). She enters while the Mandaeans are in the middle of their service, with thebrethren giving sermons (drašas) and the sisters offering responses (\u0001nianas. Miriai fallsinto a swoonlike sleep, unaware that the service is soon over and that the celebrantshave left her alone. While she sleeps, her “sister in truth (kušta)” warns Miriai to get upbefore the day breaks, for at that hour “the priests and sons of priests go out and sit inthe shadows of the ruin Jerusalem.”9Miriai leaves the maškna, and her father finds her, brusquely demanding to knowwhat his disobedient daughter has been doing. He accuses her of being a prostitute,which she denies. Still, the father calls on everyone to come and see Miriai, who hasscandalized her family and kin by leaving Judaism for the Mandaean religion, “to loveher Lord.”10 Miriai now prefers white, the Mandaean color, to the Jewish dyed ones.Moreover, she takes no interest in silver and gold (which the Jews love), and she favorsthe Mandaean priestly headgear, the burzinqa, over the Jewish tutifta. Possessed by theextraordinary courage of the fresh convert, Miriai curses the Jews and their priests, call-ing for dust and ashes into the mouths of her opponents and for horse manure on theheads of the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem.Here, in John’s first story about Miriai, one notes the automatic association of con-version and adultery. I suspect that there is a pattern of equating women’s conversionwith adultery, with sexual sin, a parallel seldom found if the convert is male. One needsonly to look to the Old Testament to see an entire people, the Israelites, collectively castinto a female, adulterous role over against Yahweh, the scorned husband raging abouthis unfaithful wife (cf. Hosea; Ezekiel 16). There seem also to be echoes of the typeprovided by Thecla in the Christian apocryphal story about Paul and Thecla, in whicha young woman falls for an alien man, thus enraging her parents and committing asocial sin.11"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Miriai51It is interesting to note the Mandaean emphasis on contrasts: the Mandaean templeversus the Jewish house(s) of worship; the opposed priestly headgears; white versus colors;her new religion as Miriai’s rightful place versus Judaism. Underlying the dichotomybetween the two religions is a pun much savored in Mandaeism (though not mentionedin this text): the Mandaean word for miscarriage or abortion is iahta,12 based on theroot HTA (to sin). “Jews” are iahudaiia, and it only takes a change in one consonant,making the t into a d, to bring out the wordplay showing that the Jewish religion isreally one of those not yet full-born, still on in imperfect or badly developed fetus stage.But to be a Mandaean means to have a fully human status.John ‘s second tale about Miriai takes the reader to the mouth of the river Euphrates,where Miriai stands transformed as a vine giving shelter to birds that wish to buildtheir nests there. The vine’s leaves and fruits are precious stones and pearls. A sweetscent emanates from the vine, which provides sacred food and drink for the birds.13Sudden hurricanes attack the vine, however, and some birds manage to hold on, whileothers are blown off.The \u0001utra Hibil Ziwa appears as a white eagle to converse with the birds still clingingto the vine. The survivors wish to know what has befallen their lost companions, butHibil Ziwa tells them that it is better not to ask. He then reveals that the others havebeen torn to pieces. (This clearly reflects a story of violent persecution.) Hibil Ziwa hascome for two reasons: first, to admonish the remnant true believers to remain steadfastand second, to furnish companionship (ƒauta) to Miriai, for he himself will be her healer.But Hibil focuses on the believers; the attacked vine, Miriai, may have healed her-self. Hibil carries water in his white bucket to the plants, which are no longer birds, for“plants” (šitlia) is a common eponym for faithful Mandaeans. They grow to twice theirformer size. Miriai is now outrightly identified with Simat Hiia (Treasure of Life), theprimary female Lightworld principle,14 and with Truth, Kušta. Hibil then flies off towake up the sleeping Gnostics, and he curses the Jews who persecuted Miriai. One ofthese Jews is singled out. He is Zatan, one of the seven pillars of the Temple, and hehas spread lies about Miriai.The enraged Jews appear, having pursued Miriai to the mouth of the Euphrates.Wanting to kill her and to hang her seducer on a pole, the Jews accuse the alien manof having broken down Jerusalem’s dove cotes and trapped its doves. But now, rising tothe demanding occasion, Miriai has been transformed from a nurturing vine into a priest.This is quite extraordinary, for to my knowledge this is the only Mandaean myth thatpresents a female priest.15 Sitting on her throne, book in lap, priestly staff (margna) inhand and the priestly belt (himiana) enclosing her waist, Miriai presides with a priestlybanner (drabša) stuck into the earth beside her. As she reads, the worlds shake. Sheprays and preaches, while fishes and birds listen in rapt attention. Sweet riha (incense)envelops her entranced, wide-awake audience.This spectacle makes the Jews even more angry. Among them, Miriai’s mother criesand pleads, asking her daughter to remember her former, exalted position in Judaism.The mother mentions a significant contrast: the \u0001uraita (Torah) used to lie in your lap,she says to Miriai—instead of the Mandaean scripture lying in your lap now. Jewishpriests and their sons used to kiss Miriai’s hand, and the Jews at home were desolateafter Miriai left. Now they stand on the rooftops of Jerusalem looking for her, hopingfor her return.16 Since Miriai left, the Jews, who formerly loved gold, now regard it as"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"52Beginningsworthless, and lamps are extinguished in mourning over her absence. Miriai’s mothercontinues to plead with her daughter: “Come! Teach the little ones writing! And bringthe Torah from the shelf! From the day when you laid down the hala (hallah), it hasbecome a miscarriage (or: ‘excrement’). And bring it to your lap (or: ‘shelter’) and let ushear your voice as it was before!”17 With haughty laughter, Miriai dismisses her mother’sentreaties, accuses the Jews of worshiping a vault (azga—perhaps a confusion with theMuslim Dome of the Rock), and insists that she has not been seduced in any sexualsense. Hibil Ziwa, still as eagle, now reappears, chains the Jews, and drops them to thebottom of the ocean. Next he destroys the Jews in Jerusalem, their city, and the Temple.18Hibil preaches to Miriai, and the two exchange kušta, the sacred hand clasp. Then, inheroic fashion, the \u0001utra embraces Miriai and lays her down on her throne while callinghimself her “good messenger.”19 But no seduction scene ensues. Instead, he asks herfor the kušta, which only a priest can give. This seems to show who really is in chargeat this point. Like a true savior, Miriai promises him, “ I and you will wind our wayupwards and victoriously ascend to the Place of Light.”20 Here end John’s stories aboutMiriai.One notices several points in this material. First, Miriai’s role is that of a “foundingmother” who provides life-giving food and drink to the community. Second, the stormhurling off a portion of the birds shows a community in distress, subject to persecution.Third, Hibil Ziwa asks the remaining birds to be companions for Miriai. The word for“companion,” ƒauta, has a number of meanings, but here I would like to stress thatwhile the usual gender balance appears, the genders are reversed, upsetting the expectedpattern. A superior male may need a female as a spiritual or sexual companion, buthere the community is put in a male role vis-à-vis Miriai. She maintains her superiorposition, while the males are her faithful believers. Fourth, the expected rescuing herofigure Hibil Ziwa appears to subject himself to Miriai, despite his initial “macho” pos-turing. Gender balance comes through, however, in the parallel actions of Miriai asvine, feeding her birds with her own substance, and Hibil Ziwa, who waters his plants.Last, and not least, comes the stunning portrayal of Miriai as female priest, in full rega-lia. One must conclude that the story offers very daring messages regaring gender hier-archy and gender balance.Because this is also a highly polemical tale, its treatment of the Jews is instructive.The Jews possess no power over the imposing female priestly figure, and Miriai’s motheris defeated, unable to lure her daughter back into Judaism. Miriai’s former, powerfulposition in that religion may, in fact, have prepared her quite well for her newfoundrole. Judaism’s loss is Mandaeism’s gain, and the Mandaeans emigrating from Jerusa-lem now have a new home on the Euphrates, under the tutelage of a female leader.(One may see this as a reflection of the mythical-historical scenario of the Mandaeanstraveling eastward under King Ardban’s protection). Hibil Ziwa’s destruction of the Jewsand their city may well recall what the Mandaeans knew of the events around the year70 C.E. Similar to certain Christian interpretations, the Mandaean view emphasizes thejust punishment of the Jews for their hostility against other, “quasi”-Jewish, religions intheir midst.John’s story is subversive in many ways. It permits a female figure to turn into apriest, and it reverses the usual pattern of expected behavior for \u0001utras such as HibilZiwa. Even though Hibil, manfully, appears to rescue a grammatically and mythologi-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Miriai53cally female soul, he also, toward the end, asks Miriai for the handshake, and she promiseshim salvation. The initial hint of hieros gamos (holy marriage) is not played out, for it isthe community, rather than Hibil Ziwa, who is Miriai’s ƒauta. Even if one sees Miriai asthe soul rescuing the spirit (Hibil), according to the common pattern of salvation at theend of bodily life, the expected gender pattern does not work, because both soul andspirit are female in Mandaeism. Therefore, sexual imagery remains irrelevant in thepromised, salvific union of Miriai and Hibil.While she was Jewish, Miriai had her hand kissed by the Jewish priests and their sons.Now it is Hibil Ziwa who asks for her handshake. His request almost seems to under-mine his status as savior. However, Miriai and Hibil rescue one another, and they areequals, both \u0001utras. First Hibil saves Miriai from the menace of the Jews, and then shevows that both of them will ascend back to the Lightworld together. The text seems to meto conduct a conversation with itself about the possibly competing roles of priests andsaviors. Thus, John experiments with different patterns of gender and hierarchy.A Pious BelieverIn sections 21 and 22, John offers more information about Miriai.21 Here are polemi-cal stories featuring John the Baptist in his role as preacher in Jerusalem. Miriai and\u0001Nisbai listen to his words and weep in response, knowing that John (and/or thewomen themselves) will soon depart from the city.22 A bit later, Miriai, Jaqif (perhapsa form of Jacob, Jesus’ brother), and Benia Amin (“the sons of Amin,” probably amisunderstanding of “Benjamin”) speak to John,23 who has replaced the Torah in Jerusa-lem with his own teaching. The Mandaeans will disappear from the city, he predicts,and the three inquirers wonder whether the Mandaean message and rituals will ceaseand the priests be murdered. In response to their anxious query, John predicts not onlythe dwindling of the Mandaean community and the destruction of Jerusalem but alsothe rise of Muhammad. Again, one sees the reflection of persecution and migrationtraditions.24Jaqif, Benia Amin, and Miriai also appear in GR 15,25 in a section concerned withAnuš, the white eagle, which intervenes in the evil plans of Ruha and her planets, thebuilders of Jerusalem. Anuš declares Miriai to be perfect, and Jaqif and Benia Amin areher descendants, says the text.26 In turn, the two men give rise to 365 (a much-usedmythological number in Mandaeism) disciples in Jerusalem. “Genealogy” leads to “his-tory,” for also in GR, the Jews are described as destroyers of Mandaeism in their midst.Like Hibil Ziwa in John, Anuš calls himself Miriai’s healer, and he takes care to men-tion that he does not demand payment for his services—probably an anti-Christian hint.Compared with John’s story about Hibil Ziwa and Miriai, GR’s seems more cautiousin terms of gender portrayal, for the \u0003utra says that he has baptized Miriai, signing herwith the pure sign. In John, nothing of that sort happens, perhaps because of Miriai’spriestly status. Nobody baptizes Miriai, who already is a priest. In GR, John the Baptist’spresence does not specifically portray him as a baptizer. Stories such as the one inMandaeans, in which Miriai asks for baptism, stress an initiation ritual, a ritual thatprobably did occur in Mandaeism long ago, but this is not the regular Mandaean re-peated baptism, the maƒbuta."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"54BeginningsThe materials about Miriai in John, GR 15, and the oral legends constitute mytho-logical creations and reflections based on admittedly vague and as yet unretrievable,historical traditions. But the notion of a Jewess turned Mandaean seems to give someclues to Mandaean history, which naturally puts polemical issues in the forefront. Elabo-rations in the mythologies include Miriai’s role as a founding mother figure, a sustain-ing vine, and a priest—all highly positive to such a degree that these traditions appearalmost provocative. In contrast, there is the story of Miriai as a demure follower (to-gether with \u0001Nisbai) of John the Baptist, though here, too, her foundress position isdiscernible.Friday and SaturdayIn my view, Miriai’s most significant appearance in the Mandaean literature is in theweekly liturgy, in two ancient prayers regularly uttered by priests. These are Prayerbook,numbers 149 and 162, of the prayer type rahmas (devotions), and these two are spokenon Friday morning and Saturday evening, respectively.27 Each day of the week has itsown set of three prayers, and it is significant that the two prayers belong, respectively,to Friday morning, which heralds the Jewish Sabbath, and to Saturday evening, whichmarks the exit of the Jewish holy day. Both prayers have highly polemical contents.The first one, prayer 149, recalls the first section of John’s Miriai material, in whichthe young woman ventured outside in spite of her parents’ rules. In prayer 149, Miriai’smother meets her daughter at the door of the bit ama, notes her sleepy expression andflushed cheeks, and demands an explanation. Miriai has spent several days in theMandaean temple, listening to the beautiful service, she says. Her mother replies:Have you not heard, daughter Miriai, what the Jews say about you?The Jews say, “Your daughter loves a man, she hates Judaism and loves the naƒiruta;she hates the door of the bit ama and loves the door of the maškna; she hates the tutiftaand loves the fresh wreath. On the Sabbath (šapta) she carries out work; on Sunday(habšaba) she keeps her hand (from it).”28In response, Miriai curses the Jews, as she did in John, with some of the same ex-pressions used in that text. She declares her love for her Lord, Manda d-Hiia, who willhelp her ascend from darkness to light. In contrast to John, in the Prayerbook Miriaiplays a more subservient role, suitable for a new convert. She is the female recipient ofthe male savior’s grace, not a bestower of it.As Mandaean priests speak this prayer every Friday, they remind themselves of andre-create the tradition of their Jewish origins. Miriai is the figure who repeats the state-ment of Mandaeism’s cut ties with Judaism. As a “counter”-day to the Mandaean Habšaba,Sunday,29 the Jewish Sabbath represents danger, and the prayer can be seen as an exor-cism. As in John, the text in the Prayerbook lists the contrasts between the two religions,contrasts that are too close for comfort.Prayer 162, the rahma for Saturday evening, puts the Jewish Sabbath in oppositionto the Habšaba. Miriai goes to the maškna to perform her prayers, but armed, evil people(presumably the Jews) accost her, demanding to know the character of her savior. Shecurses them, declares that they will never see what she has seen, and that Manda d-Hiia"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Miriai55surpasses everyone else, for the earth trembles before him, he raises the dead, heals,and cures lepers.30 This prayer takes polemical care of both Christianity and Judaism,and the Sabbath is ushered out, perhaps with the relieved thought of “good riddance.”Even as the place is now cleared for the entry of the Mandaean holiday, the JewishSabbath is sure to reappear next week. And the weekly round of rahmas begins anew.Across the SpectrumTo my knowledge, Mandaeism has no tradition in which John the Baptist appears as aproto-convert, like Miriai does. John, simply, is the chief Mandaean prophet, belongingto a prophetic tradition extending back to Adam, according to the Mandaean view.Carrying on the eternal message of the Great Life, John springs up as a timely counter-messenger to the Jewish religion. Nowhere does he baptize Miriai, though he reluctantlybaptizes Jesus, who is on his way out of Mandaeism, in contrast to Miriai, who is enter-ing it. If Miriai is baptized at all, it is by an \u0001utra, the object of her love, not by a humanbeing. One might have expected a closer connection between John and Miriai, but thetwo seem to belong to independent traditions,31 even though they occasionally appeartogether, as in GR 15, 11.Perhaps the Mandaean adoption of Miriai while denigrating her son reflects a his-torical development out of Judaism. From the Mandaean viewpoint, Jesus was wrong,an apostate from the true religion, but his mother is a Mandaean heroine. Miriai standson her own, and her connections are all laudable. She is not upstaged by Elizabeth(\u0001Nisbai), whose role as mother of John the Baptist puts her in a special position. Tra-ditions such as Luke’s gospel (or Islamic reworkings of the story) about the two womenseem to furnish Mandaeism with one among several possibilities of distancing Miriaifrom her pernicious son.32On another note, the intimation of sexual innuendo in the conversion stories findsparallels in Christian apocryphal legends such as “Acts of Paul and Thecla.”33 Swoon-ing to the message by “the alien man,” Miriai, like Thecla, converts, and this is under-stood as sexual seduction, especially by the upset parents who take their daughter’s newview as a personal attack on them and on their community.34 The elevated position ofMiriai as otherworldly vine and female Lightworld being, on the other hand, might berelated to other Gnostic portrayals of a related kind, such as Ennoia in “The Apocryphonof John.”35Mandaeism leaves the road open for depicting Miriai in exalted Lightworld rolesbecause nothing in the religion prohibits such possibilities. Like Ruha, whose portray-als run from the most base and evil to the highest female in the Lightworld, Miriai, too,can be a female \u0001utra. Lofty female beings may exist independently, without male coun-terparts. Miriai leaps from human status upward, to priest and supernatural vine.Unlike culpable female figures in other forms of Gnosticism, such as the soul whofalls, suffers, and finally is rescued by a male and restored to matrimonial harmony,Miriai never sins sexually, needs no pairing with a male, and does not repent. Com-pared with Ruha, Miriai seems much less endangered. Her “fall” is not one from aheavenly Lightworld down into matter but a horizontal breach with an earthly, religioustradition. In her move from Judaism to Mandaeism, from west to east, Miriai is not"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"56Beginningsbrought back into any “fold” but instead, creates her own. Especially in John’s account,the daring apotheosis of Miriai makes sense as an illustration of the idea that if malepriests are \u0001utras on earth, so may women be.Ironically, Miriai breaks out of a religion that seems very close to the one she enters.The polemical dichotomies and similarities listed in both John and the Prayerbook showthat even if Miriai has now joined the better, more”mature” religion of Mandaeism(recall the pun on iahutaiia), its features are not that radically different from Judaism’s.Both have books, both treasure learning, both have priests with requisite headgear, andMiriai now inhabits an elevated position in Mandaeism—as she once did in her formerreligion, according to her mother’s statement. Miriai has simply made the obvious con-clusion that Mandaeism, the fully developed religion, is naturally preferable to theembryonic-abortive Judaism.The conversion of Miriai seems natural because it is a case of development and re-placement, not a matter of an extreme re-creation. The two religious universes are par-allel, not totally different, and religious polemical forms of literature gain particular forcein such a situation. For battles are begotten not by enormous differences but by scan-dalous similarities. There is little point in engaging in heated polemics with a religionso different from one’s own as to furnish no real common ground on which to hurlarguments. Historically and mythologically, Mandaeism’s view is that Judaism andMandaeism resemble one another too much. The Miriai traditions portray Mandaeism’scritical attitude toward its former home."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"PART IIRITUALS"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"6To the RiverIn Iran, April 199659Sightseeing“Where is the sheikh?” This is the question.

A goldsmith who has lived almost half his life in Englandand whose command of Farsi still evokes sniggers from some of the men, Suhrab isone of my interpreters and companions, a serious, thirtyish father-to-be.We are waiting for two sheikhs, two Mandaean priests, who are with us today: theriš ama, (head of the people), Sheikh Jabbar Tawoosie, a magnificent, dignified man ofseventy-five in flowing robes, and his older son, Sheikh Salah, dark and intense, dap-per in a black suit and white shoes and headgear.

Maybe they were halted at roadblocks, for the military-looking police mightwell be interested in taking a closer look at these unusual men.

Only women and children are inside, one woman motionlesslystretched out and completely hidden in her black cover on the tiled floor. The honey-combed ceiling and walls blink in thousands of glass mosaic pieces. A fiercely devo-tional atmosphere reigns, some of the worshiping women have a wild air about them,and I sense that this is a place they seek out for its healing powers.

That they beregarded as monotheists is crucially important to the Mandaeans right now, in April1996, for it is about a year since the Iranian leader Khamenei issued a fatwa (opinion),stating that the Mandaeans possess the requisite characteristics to be recognized as a “peopleof the Book.” Since the revolution of 1980, this protection, which the Qur’an does grantto monotheists, has been given to the Zoroastrians instead of to the Mandaeans.2 Foryears now, Mandaeans have sought to regain their status.

I am struck by the presence of the two Mandaean sheikhshere, for they seem naturally to belong to the place, as if they could easily trace an an-cient heritage back to this territory.This impression grows much stronger at the next site, the ziggurat at Choga Zambil,the remains of an enormous and fantastic Elamite castle already very old when Assurbanipaloverran it in the seventh century. As the straight road of the flat desert suddenly turnsin between narrow, rocky hills and I see the ruin rising like a weird vision on my right,it is impossible not to exclaim. We are the only visitors. The thin, leathery, knowledge-able guide comes with us, and Suhrab translates for me. He points: here virgins weresacrificed; here is the ancient “clock”; out there one can still see the outer concentricwalls of the entire complex. Right across the structure appears, once a year, an unex-plained green line, pondered over by French scientists who arrive to observe it from theair. Suhrab and I agree that we would like to come back on that mysterious, annual dayto see the line.“Look at the sheikh,” Suhrab suddenly says. Sheikh Jabbar seems to have flown likea bird up to the top of the ziggurat, ahead of everyone else. Halfway to the sky, he waves,his clothes like wings in the breeze. He looks like he owns the place, and the sight ofhim remains one of the lasting, archetypal images of my stay in Iran. We ascend thesteep steps. Every tenth row of wall bricks is densely inscribed with cuneiform charac-ters. Sheikh Choheili expresses concern that I might fall off the flattened summit, whereI run about, but I tell him that I am used to mountains. He lightens up, “Well, I’ll takeyou mountain climbing in Tehran next week!”As we circumambulate the ziggurat, I hear that the French archaeologist J. de Morganwas among the scientists who examined the site long ago.3 I tell Sheikh Choheili that deMorgan procured Mandaean manuscripts in Persia in 1889–90 and that Mandaeans theninformed him of severe persecutions about a century earlier. This calamity, de Morganfound, was still fresh and raw in Mandaean minds. As I talk about this, Sheikh Choheilitranslates for Sheikh Salah, who is walking next to us and now listens intently.At that time, I do not know that our next site still holds aching memories for theMandaeans. We are going to Shushtar, dodging traffic around rotaries and aiming firstfor a sorrowful place near the arches of the old bridge. During the time of Qajar ShahNaƒir al-Din4 (but not with his approval) Mandaeans were thrown into wells and drownedhere, a terrible death for baptists. Some Mandaeans escaped to the village we passednear Choga Zambil, from where Sheikh Choheili’s family hails and where Mandaeanslived on good terms with their neighbors. Now, as the probable location of the wells ispointed out, our company grows somber and silent. Because I roam around a bit, en-tranced by the surroundings, I miss Sheikh Jabbar’s prayer for the dead. Suhrab is slightlyaccusing, “I noticed you did not join in the response to the prayer.” He is right; myattention was elsewhere, and because of this I feel guilty.Next we head for Shushtar’s old “Subbi Kush,” the Mandaean area, where noMandaeans live anymore. I recall a number of colophons stating that the scribe did hiswork in this city, probably in this very quarter. An expanding vista opens up at the endof what is now a Muslim street. Across the valley a dome is gleaming bluish in the fardistance. Below it flows the river, crossed by a long, low bridge carrying an ant-sizedstring of sheep with their shepherd. Hamid takes the opportunity to clean his car, while"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"62RitualsThe Yalufa Eidan Jizan and the Ganzibra, Sheikh Abdullah in Shushtar, Iran.

Suhrab, seemingly gripped by a sud-den anxiety, turns to me and wonders if local people will harass us. “Relax,” I say, “itis not the nineteenth century now.” But I sense his worry, and a cloud of unease re-mains with us until we leave the area.While still in the bustle of town, we stop on a bridge to admire the dramatic gullywith water spouting out of the rocks above the river. Sheikh Choheili, whose affablenature causes him to fall into conversation with locals anywhere—be they taxi drivers inTehran or fellow passengers on a plane5—does just that. We are all ready to leave Shushtar,while Sheikh Choheili still lingers in an animated chat with a man on the bridge. Ittakes us a while to find the right way out of town. Evening light falls aslant on the flatlandscape as we hurtle toward Ahwaz through a rain shower or two, the hazy brownmountains toward the distant northeast. Somewhere in the car lies the enormous pad-lock used to secure the gas pedal against the “too many Ali Babas,” as Hamid has ex-plained to me. But now the car flies, liberated, past the land’s manifold vehicles, includ-ing Iranian and Toyota pickup trucks crammed with tightly tethered sheep and heifers.Purity Controlled, Negotiated, ThreatenedI would like to import Mandaean cows to the United States. The reason is the yogurt,unpasteurized. I have just finished a bowl of it, like exquisite sour silk, in the house ofthe gentle, ever-smiling old goldsmith, Mr. Abdullah Tawoosie. Now I want to thankthe cow, and we go through a gate to the inner yard, where the cow stands in her shed,a calf nearby, along with numerous chickens, ducks, and geese. Even here, in Ahwaz, acity of 3 million people, people still keep livestock and fowl. Indeed, any time of day ornight a neighboring rooster crows next to my hotel. Graciously, I am offered a duck eggand a goose egg, but I have to decline, for how would I cook them in the hotel?A few days later, when we have spread blankets under trees on the sidewalk in thecity of Khorramshahr to have lunch—tea, yellow soda, pistachio cake, mulberries, bread,and so on—the ever-joking Mr. Said Berengi offers me a huge egg. “What is that?” Iinquire. “Camel egg,” he replies, deadpan. After I have played half offended, we leanover in laughter. The Berengis are a barrel of laughs. One afternoon I spend an hourat their house, in constant merriment, despite our almost total lack of a common lan-guage. One of the young sons, Farshad, declared himself to be “my baby” while wewere in Susa, so that he could get into the museum, which is off limits to Iranians butnot to foreigners. (It was Monday, so the museum was closed anyway.) He has to facemilitary service first, but then he wants to visit the United States. With his jeans andhip sunglasses, he will fit right in.Now, in Khorramshahr, I have already had another, noncamel egg, and I declineMr. Berengi’s offer. But I am watching Sheikh Najah, who does not eat with us butwanders around with the video camera belonging to Ahmed, the ubiquitous recorder ofmost of my trip. A younger son of Sheikh Jabbar, Sheikh Najah—who likes to drive fastand who furnishes us with a spiritual presence on this tour to the war-ravaged coastalarea—is a tarmida, tall and lanky like his brother, dressed entirely in white, with a coalblack beard like a bib. Notably, he neither eats nor drinks on this outing."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"64RitualsIndirectly, I am given several lessons in food. Who eats what, whose food, with whom,where? In the history department at Dr. Beheshti University in Tehran, it is rumoredthat I am a vegetarian. A whispered question: Would I like the canned tuna cold orheated? I clear things up and eat chicken kebab. But six days earlier, in Khuzistan onour inland sightseeing tour, as we take a lunch break at a sugarcane plantation, I makesome observations. Zakia, a Mandaean, works at the plantation, which is why we areinvited to lunch there. In the cavernous restaurant, empty except for us, we have anexcellent meal. I notice that those who are with us around the table are the ones with-out special purity rules. Someone sighs about the lack of alcohol—a provocative longingin Iran, a dry country but with very good Islamic beer.Having leaned back for a bit and decorously picked our teeth, we go outside andthen enter a small sitting room with a tea kitchen, like a motel room. There, SheikhChoheili and Eidan Jizan, the other yalufa in our company, have just finished theirmeal, eaten off of their own utensils on an oilcloth spread on the floor. They have broughtall their food and utensils themselves. Through the half-open door to the next room, Iglimpse the riš and notice Sheikh Salah, stripped to his white ritual garments. With awhite cloth, he is wiping his empty, clean, tinned food bowl very slowly, very carefully.He catches me watching him. The women of priestly family—Manijeh and Neda, andNeshat, the little girl who skips around and who will later run with Sheikh Jabbar tothe top of the ziggurat—have evidently eaten separately. It is clear to me that our lunchhas been eaten in different tiers of purity.In Tehran, later, I play food police and say to a Muslim friend, “Hey, that’s nothalal [pure] for you!”Mr. Frouzandeh is eating shrimp. I learn that it is clean now, for the authorities,evidently in an effort to boost the shrimp industry, last year declared the food fit to eat.And I, the barbarian from a Christian culture, began to appreciate the Iranian shrimpvery soon after my arrival. Another day in Tehran, at lunch in a small restaurant withSheikh Choheili and Mr. Askari (the singer and shipping company director), SheikhChoheili has expressed skepticism about the fish. How is it cooked? He eats no meatbut will take other restaurant food, which can be risky business. I am surprised to seehim eating shrimp one day.But mushrooms, which I am savoring on that day in Tehran, he will not touch.Mr. Askari gently complains to me, “I have tried to tell him: it is not meat. It grows onthe ground. Am I not right? You tell him. “ I agree but must concede that mushroomshave a strange texture, grow in a funny way, and certainly do not look like plants. SheikhChoheili stands his ground, unswayed. Having listed the mushrooms’ suspect featureswhile picking at those remaining on my plate, I am beginning to harbor the more tra-ditional Mandaean attitude toward mushrooms.That we are separated in thought as in the sharing of food becomes clear in theelegant house of the Tawoosie sheikhs. We spend our time discussing religion (I amthe only woman in the company of men). Sheikh Salah, ever the ideologue, and I re-main respectful of each other’s positions as we sit on opposite sides of the carpet, withSheikh Choheili interpreting. Both of us are gesturing, acknowledging our differencesin the matter of Mandaean origins.“Our religion is very old. We go back to Adam. You saw the clay tarianas [trays] in thewedding canopy, like Adam used, everything in natural materials, nothing artificial.”"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"To the River: In Iran, April 199665Yes. But I explain that scholars will not accept the historical validity of such state-ments, that they want proofs, according to their scholarly terms. We may all derive fromAdam, but we cannot prove it historically.Accepting our separation in views, we finish, and around ten-thirty get up from thebeautiful carpet. We, as guests, are invited to take our meal. Throughout the evening, Ihave not even laid eyes on any women of the house, and only a few young boys havehovered at the far rim of our discussions. Now four men and I sit down at the tableladen with a delicious repast of fish, rice, vegetables, and greens. Our hosts are no-where to be seen, and only toward the end do I notice the passing shadow of one of thesheikhs beyond the sprays of the indoor fountain. Eating seems to be an intensely pri-vate affair in a pure house. It feels like an immense honor to eat here at all.What is clean, what unclean? Cows and fowl stay in their courtyard areas. On Sun-day, two hens sleep peacefully a few feet away from the bamboo wedding canopy whilethe solemn, but festive, ritual proceeds. Except for occasional small birds in cages andgoldfish, Mandaeans do not keep pets. Neither do I, having grown up with serioushunting dogs. One morning at breakfast I watch a dust-colored cat lying down to rest inthe bed of asters and sweet william right outside the hotel window. Only once does itrise to swat a butterfly. I see no other cats during my entire stay. A few thin dogs slinkalong the house walls near the hotel.On my first, dizzying morning in Ahwaz, touring Mandaean workshops and facto-ries,6 I learn about the distance kept from dogs. In increasing heat and din, we enter aniron-smelting plant. Across the courtyard, I notice three guard dogs pricking up theirears at us from a dark doorway. They actually look friendly, and, following my naturalinclinations, I want to greet them, though keeping my distance. But Mr. Kataneh, oneof my companions and translators, speaks harshly to them, and they cower and retreat,only their eyes visible. A retired engineer, Mr. Kataneh explains at length to me aboutthe workings of machinery and products, and he also tells me that he once kicked inthe teeth of an attacking dog that belonged to a foreigner. Later, at his house, Mr. Katanehwants to show me something. He reaches up to the top of the air conditioner facing thegarden and hauls down a stuffed jackal, its teeth bared. His eternal revenge on thatEnglish canine!Mandaeans seem far away from violent attitudes, however. My blue bag, which holdsmy daily gear and the plastic bottle of mineral water, Damavand (named for Iran’s tall-est mountain), evokes the suspicion of the hotel doorman. Am I concealing a bomb?No. Back in Sweden, right before I came to Iran, my Mandaean friend Issam coveredhis head and shook it when I modeled my chador for him and his family. “You looklike a tank! U.S. ‘s new, secret weapon!”Naturally, military and war monuments grace city squares and rotaries in Iran, alongwith huge murals of the leaders, often poised benevolently against a background of clearrivers and flowering fields (tulips and roses seem to be favorites). Young soldiers, mostlywithout visible weapons, appear just as regularly, and only one bore an expression ofsuch subtle, unspeakable cruelty that I had to turn away. I was unable to shake theimpression for several days.On the trip to Khorramshahr and Abadan, near the Gulf, we visit territory I haveseen before on a visit in 1973. However, I now recognize only part of the Khorramshahrcity block where Mandaean silversmiths used to have their shops. Aran is no longer"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"66Ritualshere, and Shaker Feyzi went to Kuwait. Mandaeans do not live here anymore, for theyall left during the 1980–88 war. We have passed shot-up, rusted tanks on the way, andthe areas where heavy fighting occurred are pointed out to me. One of Mr. Kataneh’ssons was an officer in the war. The Iranian Mandaeans lost fewer than ten of theirown, but more are missing.We stop at the old, bombed Mandaean quarter in Khorramshahr. I take a picture ofMr. Sobbi’s rebuilt house, to show him back in New York. Mr. Kataneh and his wifeare in our company, and he tells me where his own house stood. “It must be strange foryou to be back,” I offer. It is; they have not been here for seventeen years. Behind abrick wall, the Mandaean mandi still exist, cared for by the people who live there. Thelocals eye us with mild, curious suspicion.After the lunch of the spurned “camel egg,” we cross over to Abadan to look intoIraq. Having arrived at our first vantage point, we leave immediately, sensing that it issafer to go to a slightly different place to ponder the border. Soon we stand meditativelyin front of a tall, chain-link fence topped with barbed wire and gaze at the green, seem-ingly uninhabited marshland on the other side. In easier times, Mandaean priests wereable to cross the border to officiate at rituals for their fellows in the neighboring coun-try, but not now. Are there still Mandaeans left in the southern Iraqi marsh country?Yes, a few. Are any of them looking across at us, right now?In Shiraz, at the dinner table in the Ghilani family’s house,7 I ask if there are differ-ences between Iranian and Iraqi Mandaeans. At first, the answer seems to be no. Butthe question quickly unleashes a twenty-minute heated discussion, which I wait out.When I surmise the result, it is almost the same as the answer given to me on LongIsland in New York: a hesitant “no, but . . .” Perhaps the reaction would be different inIraq, but the consensus here seems to hold that the Iranians feel themselves to be morecareful in keeping to the traditions and the Mandaean language, while the Iraqis aresuspected of relaxing the rules, more susceptible to modern, secular ideas.Without having been in Iraq, I cannot judge. But from my own experience, it seemsto me that differences may not be that wide. Some Mandaeans have more money thanothers, more education and familiarity with other parts of the world, but even the most“Westernized” seem to maintain a sense of identity and commitment to the religionand to its values. My experience now, in Iran, of a persisting community, with leadersand priests, marks a contrast to the mostly priestless groups outside the “old” countries.However, after I return home from Iran, I learn that the Australian Mandaeans haveobtained a Mandaean tarmida from Iraq. Later, in the fall, I find out that Sheikh Salahand his family have moved to Australia, too.Traditionally, at least yalufas may be movable. Several years ago, Sheikh Choheili spenta month in Germany to work with Professor Macuch. He also went to Australia to pre-pare the way for Sheikh Salah, who traveled there twice to perform rituals for the emi-grated Mandaeans and to ready himself for his move. The sheikh’s travels astonished me.The risk! On his first air segment, Sheikh Salah ate nothing but stopped over in Malaysiato rest, eat, and purify himself. Coming from Ahwaz, he had entered the Tehran airportcarrying two bottles of water from the river Karun, only to have one bottle rendered use-less by a customs official who suspected liquor. The presence of Mandaean leaders, withtheir white clothes and dignified long beards, made a deep impression on the airportpersonnel, who whisked them through the electronic controls."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"To the River: In Iran, April 199667I remember that upstairs in my hotel room I have photos of my beloved Floridasprings and rivers. I fetch the pictures to show to Sheikh Choheili. He looks at themcarefully, and we start to form dreamy plans. Could we obtain regular access to a goodFlorida river, have a pure place for the priest to stay in, and North American Mandaeanscould come there to be baptized and have other religious needs fulfilled? Could therules be changed so that a yalufa might do the rituals if a priest did not come? (Sincethen, the Mandaeans in the midwestern United States have obtained a priest and amandi, as noted.)“Did you not ever want to become a priest?” I ask Sheikh Choheili at some point.“No.” “Why not? “ “Because then I could not work with someone like you.” I see. Oneof the many new things I am learning in Iran is the role of the yalufas, the men in themediating position between priests and laypeople.ProximitiesOne of the hardest rules for me in Iran is that I must not touch a man in public. Shak-ing hands is out of the question, and yet I unthinkingly violate the rule several times.It is especially difficult not to touch Sheikh Choheili’s hands, for he quickly becomeslike a brother to me. One evening in Tehran, when I notice that Sheikh Choheili isexhausted, I exhort Cyrus, “Take good care of him!” Cyrus is Suhrab’s twin brotherand a computer virus exterminator. He promises to give the sheikh a good massage.Sheikh Choheili, my trusted friend and soul mate, spends most of his time with me,not only in Ahwaz, for we also travel by air together to and from Shiraz and Tehran.Virtually every morning, he shows up in the hotel lobby, a gray-bearded, alert, kind,slightly built man in a green-gray suit, his woolen beanie on head or in hand. In Ahwaz,his trusty old Ford, with its long-spent suspension, windshield bullet hole, and coarsefake fur on the dashboard, waits outside the hotel.On Easter Sunday morning he arrives while I am still at breakfast. “Come. The priestsare already at the river.”For the first time in my life, I will see a Mandaean baptism. We park on the wideriverbank, and between us and the swiftly flowing, mountain-born Karun full of meltedsnow water, now brown and muddy, the three priests work like a team. Downstreamon the bridge, occasional pedestrians pause to glance in our direction. The yalufa Amin,who is the šganda (ritual helper) today, walks about in his rasta (ritual garment), bare-foot on sturdy legs, ever watchful, hands mostly clasped behind his back. Once he gentlybut firmly shoos away a curious little outsider, a boy who sits a bit too close to theaction. Amin functions as the religious overseer, directs those to be baptized to theirright place, and otherwise makes certain that everything proceeds correctly. (Off duty asšganda, Amin is never without his brown, knitted cap.)I sit down, but Mr. Kataneh soon alerts me to my scandalous attire: the ever-presentscarves, long, voluminous pants, loose shirt—but without a skirt! It would not be good ifpeople reported this. I scurry to the car, get my chador, and soon sit under a fancy whitelacy umbrella lent to me by a photographer who is here to take pictures of one of thebridal couples. Today, two such couples are being baptized. In addition, there is one otheryoung man who was married last Sunday, though his bride, due to her period, is absent."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68RitualsThe previous day, I attended the party of one of the couples. Now both the groom,Behzad, and his bride, Shaida, are serene in their rastas. Shaida wears a yellow cloakover her rasta, and her face bears no trace of the previous day’s carefully applied makeup.But yesterday was a din of festivities, with singing to taped music, hand clapping, drum-ming, foot stomping, dancing, women’s thrilling cries, and swaying walls of happy,perspiring humanity (women and children) in the room filled to overflowing. Prodded,I shed my scarves and dance with the women. The men are by themselves, in anotherroom. After the ritual applying of rings and gold necklaces on both bride and groom,the two feed each other from the sloping, sweating, three-tiered pink wedding cake. SheikhChoheili finally appears to extract me from the hot, exhilarated din.8Today is a contrast, the quiet, serene work of baptism moving like finely tuned clock-work. Sheikh Taleb Duragi, with his gray-brown beard and tilted-back head, is olderand smaller than the Tawoosie brothers. Sheikh Jabbar, their father, has stopped doingmost public rituals. I watch, strangely familiar with most of what I see, so I am notsurprised. Here, in the middle of Ahwaz, with the “real” world going about its businessin the distance, the baptism scene seems timeless yet completely natural, a vivid imageof ancient Gnostic life. I photograph Sheikh Salah smiling, pausing and at ease be-tween two ritual segments, his black cloak for warmth over his wet rasta, a wrinkled,empty Winston cigarette pack on the hardened mud just inches from his sandaled feet.The three priests are positioned on different “workstations,” as it were. While oneof the Tawoosie brothers stands in the water, inviting a bride (who is accompanied byfemale relatives) to descend for baptism, the other stands on land behind one of thecrouching grooms and reads prayers from the baptism liturgy. A bit farther back, SheikhDuragi, his lower face without the pandama (ritual mouth cover) and his rasta fallingfreely and not tucked up into his belt, consecrates his crown, readying himself for hisnext ritual segment.A priest at work is never without his staff, his margna. I notice the endearing gesturefor keeping the margna in place when a priest ascends from the river.9 Holding hisright, bared arm outstretched—for it is newly cleansed—he will tilt his head to his leftshoulder to support the margna leaning there. At this point his left hand holds thewater-filled bottle, and his right hand must remain free. When the silk taga (crown) isdeconsecrated, the priest lifts it to his mouth and eyes in an elliptical motion, rhythmi-cally and with lightning speed.10 A praying priest places his right hand to the right sideof his head, concentrating on his crown.11 Deactivated several times during the entireevent, the taga is secured inside the right, rolled-up sleeve of the priest’s shirt.I watch the praying Sheikh Duragi rapidly count formulas on the three digits of hisfingers. Zakia, a layman, hovers about throughout the baptism. Now he crouches andpulls myrtle twigs out of the large plastic bag; he is the man who twists the klilas. Thegold ring, Šum Yawar (the Name of Yawar) shines on the priest’s right little finger whenhe pushes the klila in under his crown. Only much later do I realize that no drabšastood on the riverbank. It is used for major holidays, such as John the Baptist’s birth-day and Dehwa Rabba (New Year’s), for masiqtas, priest initiations, and at the five-day-long intercalary feast Panja.Saeed, one of Sheikh Choheili’s brothers—all of whom are yalufas—has rolled thelegs of his pants up to his knees, and now he helps with the baptism of the cookinggear.

Her chador is tied up crosswise for work, and she and the yalufa hand the potsto the priest, who gives them the requisite cleansing.On and off, I scribble in my notebook, but mainly I watch. For a little while, thegrandmother of both bride and groom sits next to me and smiles with satisfaction atthe well-made match. A bit earlier, another woman has helped me arrange my chador,for I still have trouble with its symmetry, nearly tripping on the side hanging down toolow. Mostly, I sit still during the baptism, chatting with people now and then, and noddingto myself as I observe a ritual gesture so far known only from books. I am satisfied tosee that my theory of ritual as work holds up well today.Afterward, we go up to the house of the Tawoosie sheikhs, and I am invited to takea seat on a log next to two priests by the house wall, in the shade of trees. Sheikh Choheilistands by a truck, chatting with other men. The priests in this household can go rightout of their back door, cross the small street, ascend the steps up the low brick wall onthe other side, descend behind it, pass on a path through bushes and low trees, andarrive on the riverbank in a matter of minutes.The worlds I inhabit in Ahwaz are mostly with men, although women clearly domi-nate the home sphere. Suhrab’s sister, Seema, gives me a black elastic band to keep myhair in place under my scarves. The awkwardness of the visiting outsider! It takes me agood while to realize that when I am in people’s homes and they say, “Feel free,” theymean, “You may take your scarves off now.” At first I think that my pale skin and lighthair make the children shriek in excitement and surprise when I look directly at themor when I take off my head covers. But no, a woman explains, “it is your eyes.” I playhide-and-seek behind my hand, throw a sudden glance in an unexpected direction atthe groups of children, and delighted screams erupt from the girls and smaller boys, theolder boys being more brave, their gazes steady.I sense very strongly the immense advantage of a married priesthood. Everyone isnaturally comfortable around women, and the priests’ attitude toward children is warmand affectionate. An informal, relaxed atmosphere reigns in private. At first wary ofshedding my scarves in people’s homes, I am shocked to see my own bare head in thevideo segment in the priests’ house. (Later, in the Bahrain Airport, people look nakedto me—though some of them almost are, for Hajj season is near). Rules for public ap-pearances in Iran are clear, and to an outsider like me the difference between publicand private spheres in Iran is striking. Bejeweled, colorfully clad, exuberant womeninside homes don large scarves and long, demure coats or become black bundles on thestreet (although airs of quiet testing of the limits do occur: a fancy pair of shoes, a touchof earth-colored lipstick, “I-dare-you” gazes). Young men swagger in jeans or black, tight-waisted, loose-legged pants and fashionable shirts, bead strings dangling from their hands.The men show easy affection for one another; they may kiss and hold each other’s hands.Only once, in another city, do I see a young Muslim couple holding hands on a street,and then I cannot quite believe my eyes.A wedding takes days, for a married couple is not made in a hurry. On the day ofthe baptism, stepping across the blood of the rooster killed that morning,12 I enter thecourtyard of the house of the wedding. Where there was no structure yesterday, an airybamboo bridal canopy festooned with gladioli and roses stands like the frame of anelegant gift. Inside, soon enough, sit the three priests and the bridegroom, with Sheikh"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"72RitualsSalah officiating. Onlookers press on at the edges, videos whirr, and cameras hover.Sheikh Jabbar, off duty, sits contentedly at the canopy’s northeast corner. I am particu-larly interested in the end of Sheikh Salah’s long stole (naƒifa). For hours, the bride-groom maintains a firm grasp on it, because the creative powers residing in the ganizbrawill pass to the groom through the cloth, like nourishment through an umbilical cord.Two boys are present, white cloths artfully arranged around their heads. Each waitsfor the cue to smash an earthen pot on the threshold of the canopy and of the door tothe house. They each get their chance, for there are two pots. The basket with the mixedclothes of bride and groom stands nearby, the green bridal veil on top. We enter thehouse to watch the backs of the groom’s and the bride’s heads being knocked together,nine times in all. A white, gossamer-thin cloth suspended from the ceiling separatestheir heads. We women sit along the walls, clapping and singing. I munch on pita bread,and outside, an old woman hands me peeled cucumber. We all need our strength. Fora while, I sit ringside on the narrow terrace above the canopy, watching and talking toa Muslim woman, a guest and friend of the family.Sheikh Salah keeps up his readings, whether he is outside in the canopy or insidethe house. Where he goes, the groom follows on the naƒifa leash. The sheikh makes hisway through the entire wedding liturgy. At some point, I notice that his voice rises to adifferent pitch. I have long known that Mandaeans do not sing, and so it is not correctto call the prayers “hymns,” but they are certainly performed in a kind of chanting voice.Finally, with a flourish the groom throws away the naƒifa and speeds ahead of the priestinto the house to shake hands with his bride. A ripple of good-natured laughter eruptsat Behzad’s hurry.Public AppearancesMy image of a mandi was based on Lady Drower’s photos and descriptions of the tra-ditional hut made of straw, bamboo, and mud.13 But I knew that Mandaeans have larger,modern ones, essentially community houses and administrative centers. In Khuzistan,I see both kinds.One day we drive out to a remote village, where the traditional hut sits enclosed bya high wall, behind a locked gate. A corrugated tin roof covers the entire mandi area.This is the Mazrieh mandi, in the village of the same name. The Mandaeans can havetheir holy place here because of Mr. Haial Berengi, who, dressed in traditional garb,accompanies Mr. Kataneh, Sheikh Choheili, and me on this trip. On friendly termswith the locals, Mr. Berengi has enabled the granting of the land for the building. Thehut looks old, but it is not. Two tarianas (ritual clay trays) sit on its mud roof (others areinside the building). A channel has been dug so that water flows sluggishly into themud brick–lined pool beneath the earthen steps in front of the hut. The water does notlook clean to me; still, Mr. Berengi performs his ritual ablution.By special, previous permission from Sheikh Jabbar, I cross the miƒras, the rituallines drawn on the ground, and enter the mandi on ritual footgear: wooden sandals.Light comes only from the narrow doorway; the floor is hardened mud.

Again, as atthe baptism, I feel on eerily familiar territory.Outside, I sit on a huge, upended clay pot to contemplate the place. “This is whereSheikh Jabbar always sits,” Sheikh Choheili says, nodding toward my seat. They havejust celebrated Panja here a couple of weeks ago, but it is hard to imagine 200 peoplethronging inside this small enclosure. Singing birds flutter in and out of the space be-tween the corrugated roof and the surrounding wall. I clutch my himiana (sacred belt),which Mr. Berengi has given me and patiently tried to teach me to tie correctly.14There is a garden with small fig trees and recently cut olive trunks, for the olive treeshad grown too large. Soon we sit down to tea on the floor in the adjacent shed, wherewe are served by Mr. Berengi’s son, a young, recently married man. Mr. Berengi coughs(I brush aside a shade of guilt for having given him American cigarettes) and then sings.I lean against the wall, listen, and gaze out the open door. Mr. Kataneh becomes in-spired, too, and drumming on the emptied tea tray, joins in the singing. A peacefultime, a comfortable, cozy lull before taking off into the flat, endless, patchily cultivateddesert again. I am struck, as so often, by the contrast between us in a small room andthe vast land outside, largely devoid of people.Crowds show up where least expected, however. I had not been prepared for the largenumber of Mandaeans coming to meet me at the Ahwaz airport the first evening. As wewait for my luggage on the moving band, Sheikh Choheili says softly, “There are someMandaeans here to see you.” I sense several people behind the glass wall. Outside, a videocamera whirrs, and a veritable wall of people surrounds me. A girl with a large bouquetof gladioli, roses, and carnations stands in front of yet another group. I glance back andsay to myself that there must have been someone important on our plane from Tehran.But the smiling girl starts moving toward me, and I realize what is happening.The Mandi in Mazrieh, Iran.

Treated like a visiting celebrity or a head of state, I am given flowers and gifts;I sign autographs, smile, and shake hands. On my first full day in Ahwaz, I give twoconferences in the mandi, the community house with a large hall downstairs and a halfsecond-story level holding an office for business affairs and for the settling of internaldisputes. First, in the late morning, shedding my shoes at the door and seeing the largeaudience of men in the hall inside, I am taken by surprise. Is this the entire Mandaeanmale population of Ahwaz? Priests and a couple of dignified-looking, bearded older menin traditional dress sit on chairs in the first row. Many men sit on the floor, some leanagainst the walls (among them is the white-bearded Mr. Moradi, Saeed’s father,15 whomI may have met in his shop back in 1973).On the lectern, placed in the northeast corner, stands a vase of myrtle, water for me,and a microphone. If I look straight up, toward the window of the mandi office above,I see a serenely depicted drabša under the inscription “Praised be my Lord! with a pureheart.” On the north wall hangs an impressive painting of John the Baptist, praying onthe riverbank and portrayed in the Islamic artistic manner: his face a protruding flame.Later we will all stand facing north, with our hands outstretched and palms up, as SheikhChoheili, his eyes shut in passionate concentration, leads all in wall-vibrating prayer.But first there are solemn introductions, and I speak. On that occasion alone, I havethree different interpreters. Scholarship and studies, how I came to these, the originsquestion, Dead Sea Scrolls, Gnosticism, history, Lady Drower and Professor Macuch,my friendships with Mandaeans in the United States, prospects for the religion—all ofthis and more. The men’s attention does not flag. Afterward, additional issues andquestions arise from the audience. I sip water, talk, and listen, waiting for the translatorto finish his sentence.In the late afternoon, I return to find the mandi even fuller, this time with an enthu-siastic audience of women and children. By this time, I feel like a veteran and give awave and a smile as I enter. Two groups of children in rastas give heartfelt recitals ofMandaean prayers. They have been taught by Sheikh Choheili, who tirelessly works toimpart the religious traditions to the young. I sit next to Suhrab and listen, almost re-gretting that I cannot see the childrens’ faces, for they have their backs to me (thoughnow I have the video). One of the girls projects such intense sincerity in her powerfulvoice that I feel certain she will be priest material.This conference resembles the earlier one, but the atmosphere is looser and moreintimate. Now the questions from the audience are written down first, and childrenand women, weaving their way through the others, come up with pieces of paper inhand. At the very beginning, even before I have said anything, Shahrzad Abadeh Ahwazi,a woman from the Mandaean Association, presents me with a white gold ring with abrilliant. This is the first in a veritable shower of jewelry I receive in Ahwaz.Days later, just before I head for the airport on my last evening in Ahwaz, there is afarewell session in the mandi’s upper office, with warm words, presents, and assurancesthat I will keep in contact and come back. A young woman, Reema, gives me a beautifulpresent: her own cross-stitched embroidery, with flowers and the words Ya Hiia. Nextto me, Shahrzad mercifully prevents me from committing a bad mistake, for I am hot,sigh, and make motions to loosen my chador. Whispering, she swiftly tells me: no, forthere is a Muslim present. I had no inkling of this. Now I notice a man in earnest"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"76Ritualsconversation with Sheikh Choheili, and I see them throwing glances in my direction.The authorities have been kept aware of my presence in the Mandaean community. Itis certainly important that I behave decently now!In a letter of January 20, 1995, Sheikh Choheili had ended with these words: “Wehope that you will get whatever you want as well as being useful to us in this journey.”Then, I could not know how poignant his words would turn out to be. The HistoryDepartment at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran had arranged for my visa (a lengthysaga in itself). Without assurance of any set schedule, I had made extensive notes fortwo academic lectures, one on Mandaean religion, one, based in part on my colophonresearch, on Mandaean history. On the advice of an American colleague, I had arrivedin Tehran thinking that maybe I would lecture, maybe not. But in Iran, people turnedout to have firm plans for me.Mr. Frouzandeh, a rice importer and a student of Sheikh Choheili’s, may be the firstserious Muslim student of Mandaeism in his generation. For a month, Mr. Frouzandehworked on my schedule, arranging for my appearances in Tehran. We spend muchtime together, at tea-drinking sessions in the lobby of my hotel, Azadi, on the northernslope of the city, and in Mr. Frouzandeh’s car as he careens through the smooth chaosthat is Tehran traffic. Twice, we have a late dinner in a village restaurant up in themountains. Sitting under a half roof on a carpet-covered table, listening to the rushingstream below, we eat and carry on philosophical discussions. One evening, a few flakesof snow fall as the coals glow on top of the hookah, the water pipe, at the next table.“Ahh, delicious. We are like Sufis, “ says Mr. Frouzandeh, leaning back contentedlythe next night, after the three of us (Sheikh Choheili is the third) have finished ourmeal and our conversation.Untiring in his quest for religious information, Mr. Frouzandeh wants to know thepositive versus negative percentage in the personalities of certain \u0001utras. Details aboutMandaean Lightworld geography interest him so keenly that I have to tease him andask whether he is planning a trip. Does he have a ticket? But for now, my own move-ments have priority. Who will be my audience at the planned sessions, where, and when?At the tea-drinking meetings in the hotel lobby, I meet my first interpreter, Mr. Amin,the sociologist, and Sadaf Azimi, the young woman who for Mr. Frouzandeh’s benefithas translated my encyclopedia article on Mandaean religion into Farsi.16 Mr. Askari,the Mandaean singer, often shows up. An energetic man with a lively gait, dancingeyes, and a voice like a burbling brook, Mr. Askari lives in a nearby town, though hisbusiness is in Tehran. Sheikh Choheili and Mr. Askari are my constant Mandaeancompanions in what is decidedly Muslim territory.Mr. Askari’s son, Cyrus, turns up, and, as Sheikh Choheili promised back at ChogaZambil—and I do not let him forget—a mountain trip is arranged. The three of us embarkon an unforgettable climb up through the villages in one of the dramatic mountain chasmsnorth of Tehran, an almost Himalayan-looking landscape. Passing caparisoned donkeyscarrying cases of soda and supplies for the tiny restaurants higher up the path, Cyrus,Sheikh Choheili, and I make our way slowly above the brown, high-lead-gas-saturatedair of Tehran. We never even approach the pristine, shiny snow peaks hovering at 15,000to 16,000 feet. Villages seem to hang, suspended, off the mountain cliffs; three-log bridgesfortified with cement cross the rushing creek; two men lean on the edge of a laboriously"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"To the River: In Iran, April 199677built stone terrace hemming in their garden plot. Even up here, Sheikh Choheili be-friends a local, a man who hails from Khuzistan. Climbing, the two keep up a runningconversation.But most of my time in Tehran is spent indoors, at business. Dr. A. Khalatbari,the chair of the History Department at Shahid Beheshti University, has arranged formy appearance there. Khamenei’s fatwa regarding the Mandaeans is foremost in theminds of Sheikh Choheili and Mr. Askari, the only Mandaeans at my two large publicevents. What I will say about Mandaeism to the Tehran audiences—students, faculty,and clerics—carries the most serious import.In the photos taken of the conference at Shahid Beheshti University, Mr. Amin,my translator, is consistently hidden behind the Iranian flag, which sits on the longtable with the gladioli arrangement and the microphones. My scarf-covered head is bentover one of them. Alternatively, microphone in hand, I stand gesturing at the whiteboard,felt pen poised. Under the klieg lights, Mr. Amin works harder than I do. The event,in the Rumi Auditorium, to an audience of several hundred, lasts for two hours. I talkabout the Mandaeans and, by request, about Manichaeism. At the beginning I am puzzledby the intoned formulas emerging from the rows seating most of the male students. Ontwo occasions when I refer to Khamenei, they pray for several seconds. I think that thisis some form of decorous heckling, but later realize that at the mention of the country’sleader, the formulas are automatic.We break for lunch. At the meal, with Sheikh Choheili and Mr. Askari sittingopposite me at the table, Mr. Askari begins to sing two of his Mandaean songs. It isabout one o’clock. Outside, the broadcast voice of the muezzin calls to prayer. Mr. Askaricontinues. I watch and listen as the two voices carry on in parallel. There is a quietattentiveness in the room, followed by subdued applause around the table for Mr. Askari.We return to the auditorium for the panel discussion, which lasts for two hours.With Dr. Khodadadyan as moderator, six of us sit down at the podium. Mr. Aminand I hover together, and he goes to work for me again. Now Sheikh Choheili is withus, together with three professors, one of them a philosopher, and on the far rightMr. Frouzandeh’s beloved teacher, the delightful elder statesman of religious studies inIran: Dr. Mujtabai. We spend most of our time dealing with written questions fromthe audience. A stack of small pieces of paper grows in front of Dr. Khodadadyan.Some questions are in English, some in Farsi. Several are addressed especially to me,and one expresses sincere concern that this might be a tiring experience for me. Nomatter! We take turns answering the queries, and I refer some present-day Mandaeanissues directly to Sheikh Choheili. Everything is translated for my benefit.Throughout, I feel strongly that this is a very positive event, a sincere and well-receivedlearning experience for all—certainly for me. I hope to have done a satisfying piece ofadvocacy. It is evidently a long time since anyone has come to give a presentation onMandaeism to a university audience in Tehran. Later, at home in the United States, thesoulful, inward gaze of the artfully turbaned mystic Rumi peers down from a wall. Thesilk carpet with his image, a gift from the university’s president, hangs there, remindingme of that day.A few days later, we attempt to rehearse what will be a somewhat different appearance.I meet for hours with members of the Ibn Sina Institute, an organization devoted to thephilosopher’s ideas and to the integrated study of religion, philosophy, and psychology."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"78RitualsThe members wish to obtain connections with similar organizations in the United States.Made up of a group of spiritually inclined men devoted to a sort of Islamic New Agemonotheism with Sufi overtones, the institute has as its spokesman the unflappably bal-anced, elegant Dr. Mahfouzi, a clinical psychologist. We have an excellent lunch, andthen tea, with Armenian delicacies (Armenian bakers and confectioners are famous).Then our distinguished visitor enters. He is Ayatollah Sajjadi of Alzahrah Univer-sity in the holy city of Qum. A candidate for Parliament and a well-known legal scholar,he carries himself with natural authority and seems at ease in our company. His ques-tions to me about the Mandaeans are three: Do they have prayers? Do they fast? Dothey allow temporary marriages? I appreciate the practical focus of his queries, and heseems satisfied with my answers.I spend two hours priming tomorrow’s interpreter, Mr. Khoshchashm, a quick-minded young man with a degree in English. The makers of my second conferencehave arranged for it to be held on neutral territory in Laleh Hotel, rather than at auniversity. They have asked for a presentation on research methods in the study of re-ligion. In a country like Iran, this topic seems challenging. I decide to tackle it head-on,and I fill Mr. Khoshchashm’s head with scholarly terminology. But the Ibn Sina soci-ety has its own concerns: Will I attend to the question of relativity, that is, the absoluteknowledge of God versus our, incomplete one? I say I will, probably indirectly—but itturns out to be sufficiently direct.The next day we arrive early, passing through the hotel lobby, which sports an ominoussign on one wall. A stream of professionals with light and sound systems parade intothe barely lit conference room. I wonder who is going to show up, for I have seen arather elegant, printed invitation (there was a notice in one of Tehran’s newspapersabout my first appearance). Clergy, professors, students, and intellectuals are in atten-dance. I keep an eye out for “my guys” sitting in the front row: Sheikh Choheili,Mr. Askari, Mr. Frouzandeh, sitting together with some of the professors from ShahidBeheshti University.There are a number of introductions, one by a scholar from Shushtar, SheikhShushtari, who knows the Mandaeans and speaks well of them, to the pleasure of SheikhChoheili and Mr. Askari. Dr. Mahfouzi makes another introduction. Deplorably, Ineglect to start with the formula, “In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Mer-ciful.” Mr. Khoshchashm works with admirable concentration for about two hours.On the whiteboard, I sketch three positions I call “Pure science,” “hermeneutics,” and“going native,” criticizing the first position, then postmodernism, absolutism, idealism,and the privileging of monotheism. I posit myself in the “hermeneutics” slot, side withBuddhism and the pre-Socratic philosophers on paradox and relativism, and knowinglycreate a polite stir.Just as I am drawing in my breath to wrap it all up, Dr. Mahfouzi decides it is timefor a break. Talking among themselves, people head for the refreshments—tea, cakes,and fruit—set up at a long table. An enthusiastic young academic immediately engagesme in conversation, and I hardly have time to eat half an orange before we start again.The indefatigable Mr. Khoshchashm at my side, I ascend the podium with three menready to respond to my statements: the literature professor Dr. Awani; the religiousleader Hojatolislam Abd Khodaei; and Dr. Tawakuli, a loquacious young sociologistwho at first seems quite challenged by my talk."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"To the River: In Iran, April 199679He believes “going native” is a fine position, and it soon dawns on me that this is ofcourse the conversion position, of eminent importance in a country like Iran. (I recallthat at the office of the police of foreign affairs in Ahwaz I had pleaded scholarly objec-tivity and declined to recognize Islam as the best religion). I defend my position as thatof an academic’s inquiry into religions, stressing tolerance for native logic, objectivitywithout meaninglessness, and agreeing to ethical standards. The literature professor,while happy to hear that Americans are now gripped by colonial guilt in the study of“others,” twice holds up Augustine as an example for us all. Avoiding what I considerChristian bait, I pay no special homage to the church father. But I am intrigued byHojatolislam Abd Khodaei, who seems to me a master of diplomacy and evenhanded-ness. Holding on to his own positions regarding faith and monotheism, he is deft inhis defenses, and I find myself frequently nodding to his words. I am exhilarated bythis event, our high-wire act between the poles of faith and academic freedom. A shiny-eyed young woman asks me afterward whether I am aware that this was quite provoca-tive. Oh yes.There, at the Laleh Hotel, my last public appearance in Iran, Mandaeism is hardlymentioned (aside from the Shushtar introducer). This conference probably did not feelvery relevant for Mr. Askari and for Sheikh Choheili, who faithfully sat through it. Wedo not talk much about it, as the event dealt with a different, to them more abstract,side to my religion studies. The Mandaeans clearly welcome my study of their religion,and I am now firmly ensconced in what feels like a new, large family. Already two yearsago a Mandaean friend on Long Island in New York had said to me, “You are part ofus now, and we of you. There is no going back.” And this is true."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"80Rituals7Baptism (Maƒbuta)80When people think of Mandaeism, they might quite rightly automatically associate itwith baptism. One might call baptism the chief characteristic of Mandaean religion.This runs counter to two traditionally held assumptions, however. The first is that ritu-als as such are basically superfluous in Gnosticism, and the second is that baptism al-ways marks a ceremony of initiation. With regard to the first assumption—now fortu-nately fading in research on Gnosticism in general—scholars have tended to think thatif Gnostic rituals occurred at all, they belonged either to an early or to a late stage of thedevelopment of Gnosticism. Far from being innocent labels, “early” usually impliedhaving a place in a mythological stage of Gnosticism, that is, one unformed by philo-sophical, abstract ideas, while “late” connoted degeneration, a form of Gnosticism slidinto magic from a prior, more genuine stage.1 In neither case did ritual occupy anyrightful position in a “present” tense, but it was seen as part of a once genuine, nowlost, stage, or as an embarrassing survival.Regarding the second assumption: when initiatory baptism is considered as the onlyvalid form, a repeated ritual like the maƒbuta becomes categorized as “atypical,” at best.Max Weber shows his distaste for repeated rituals in a remarkably prejudicial manner:“Mysteries purport to produce their effect ex opere operato by means of a pious occa-sional devotion. They provide no inner motivation for any such requirement as thebeliever’s demonstration in his life pattern of a religious norm as rebirth might entail.”2Weber clearly evaluates an event such as “rebirth,” the once and for all transformativeexperience, as positive, juxtaposing it to negatively judged repeated rituals of salvation.In Weber’s view, ethics and sincere religiosity do not fit with repeated rituals.Scholarly prejudices aside, one must ask what Gnostic baptisms, taken on their ownterms, look like. K. Rudolph has soberly observed that there is no common Gnosticideology with respect to baptism.3 The Mandaean maƒbuta must be interpreted in ac-cordance with Mandaean cosmology, anthropology, and soteriology. Running water inMandaeism is the form that the Lightworld takes on earth. Therefore, repeated immer-sions mark preparations and rehearsals for entry into that world, an entry that properlyhappens only at the death of the body. If one takes seriously this fundamental Mandaeanunderstanding, a valid interpretation of the maƒbuta cannot insist on a rebirth typol-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Baptism (Maƒbuta)81ogy. And stubborn comparisons with early Christian and Jewish forms do not lead toenlightenment, for such approaches leave Mandaeism “lacking” or “abnormal” as it isheld up to unavoidable standards taken from these religions.4Rudolph rightly states that “because the baptism furnishes the only possibility fortaking part in the Lightworld, its steady repetition is necessary.”5 In other words, werebaptism to be abolished, spiritual death would ensue.6 Stepping into the water, the peopleare dressed in the required white garment, the rasta. How could they enter the Lightworldin any other way? But the white dress, too, has been a stumbling block for interpreters,who expect an investiture after the immersion, not before. Freshly immersed, drippingMandaean people stand on the riverbank and do not wear their regular clothes, nor arethey naked. In a sense they are pure already, before they step into the water. In whatfollows, I will give a brief description of the proceedings in the maƒbuta and then at-tend to specific interpretive problems in it.7OutlineBaptism takes place in running, “living,” water, either in a river or, if the area has amandi (cult hut), in a channel dug and directed from the river so that the water moves,whether rapidly or sluggishly, in front of the hut.8 Baptism belongs in many contexts inMandaeism, but here I will focus on the maƒbuta as it occurs in its simplest form—alone, not in a cluster of other rituals.9 On Sundays and major holidays, many Mandaeanschoose to be baptized. On my 1973 trip to Mandaean territory, in Khorramshahr, Iran,Mr. Feyzi said to me, “Come back at Panja! Then we all go into the water!”10 Feastdays tend to be baptism days for Mandaeans who may otherwise neglect the ritual.Several priests may be present at a baptism. A ganzibra or a tarmida baptizes menand women in separate groups. They are all dressed in rastas, and women add a cloakfor the sake of modesty. The people line up on the riverbank, where several ritual imple-ments are ready. If it is a major holiday, there is the banner (drabša), a length of white,looped-up silk on a cross-barred, wooden pole stuck into the ground. Myrtle is twinedwhere the two poles meet, and an almost invisible thread of gold is tied right under ornext to it. Always, the clay table, the tariana, sits on the ground, holding incense andfuel. There is flour, salt, and sesame, brass drinking bowls, a bottle (qanina), and abunch of myrtle twigs that are kept fresh in a water-filled container (or in a large plasticbag, as I have seen).The priest recites the set prayers (rahmas) for the day.11 He is in full regalia, and hepays attention to each piece of his ritual garb as he blesses one after the other. His chiefemblem is his taga, the white silk priestly crown, with which he touches his eyes, mouth,and forehead sixty-one times, very rapidly. Then he burns incense and mixes flour andsalt with water to make a pihta, a small, biscuit-sized flat bread that he will eat. Later hebakes another pihta, which is to be shared among the baptized people.If the drabša is present, the people stretch out their right hands to grasp hold of itsvertical pole before they descend into the water, one at a time. First they take hold at itsbottom, then at the top, and the priest places his right hand just above the hand of eachperson holding on to the drabša pole. The priest enters the water first, and then the peopleon the riverbank, one at a time. Each walks out into the water in front of the priest, turns"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"82Ritualsleftward around him, and crouches in the water to make a full submersion three times inthe water behind the priest. Then the priest throws water three times on the wet figure.Using his left hand, the priest next grasps the person’s right hand and transfers the splashedfigure to his right side, placing the person between himself and the priestly staff (margna).Stuck into the river bottom, the secured priestly staff frees the priest’s hands.The priest submerges the person three times and uses his wet finger to draw a line threetimes across the person’s forehead, from the right to the left ear. Again thrice, the personin the water receives a palm full of water to drink. The sacred handshake, kušta, takes placebetween the two. The officiant sticks a klila, a small myrtle wreath, under the baptizedperson’s burzinqa (turban). Protecting the baptized with potent names of Lightworld beings,the priest then places his hand on the person’s head and recites these Lightworld names.Back up on dry land, the baptized crouch, often shivering, and wait until the officianthas finished the ritual in the water for each one. There may be a fire nearby for warmth.If many people are present, the line on the riverbank grows, people waiting for the priestto smear each one with sesame paste across the forehead. As before, the movement isfrom right to left. The priest gives each one a second kušta, and each now descends to theedge of the river. There the baptized, using their right hands, splash water three timesover their own right arms. Up on the bank once more, priest and baptized people alikeextend their right hands toward the river, taking the yardna as a witness to the baptism.The meal comes next. Crouching on the ground, the baptized receive a piece of thecommunal pihta and, in individual bowls, three servings of water, which the priest poursfrom the bottle. They drink the first two full bowls but throw the third pouring overtheir shoulder. After a third kušta, the priest stands behind the row of crouching people,touching the head of each person while uttering the hatamtas (sealing prayers). Risen,the baptized people exchange kušta with the officiant, and the rite ends as each partici-pant extracts the klila from underneath the turban and throws the little wreath into thewater, where it drifts off, slowly or rapidly, depending on the current. Finally, the priestperforms the deconsecrating rituals. These mirror those that he went through beforethe baptism, and thus the circle of events is closed.DetailsThroughout the baptism, the priest has kept up a steady stream of words, more or lessmuffled by the priestly mouth and nose cover (pandama).12 The prayers called for ineach step of the proceedings can be found in the Prayerbook. Their contents not onlyexpress the significance of the ritual steps but also contribute to creating these steps. Iwill now focus on the contents of the baptismal prayers, on some of the implementsused in the baptism, and on the prescribed movements. Actions and words, as mani-fested in practice and mythology, mutually reinforce and support one another in rituals,and the maƒbuta is no exception.A Mandaean consecrated priest is an \u0001utra manifested on earth. The officiating priestat a baptism first “opens up” the yardna by reciting prayer 12.13 The act can be inter-preted as activating the channel from the Lightworld to the earthly river. During a spe-cific line in prayer 13, the priest descends into the water while calling on the LightbeingPiriafil to “give free movement to the limbs of my body!”14 He continues, “I go down"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Baptism (Maƒbuta)83before these souls [i.e., the people to be baptized] whom the Life delivereth and savethand protecteth these souls from all that is evil.”15 He then asks a number of Lightworldbeings to guard and secure the souls of those to be baptized.Prayer 14 is recited for the margna, which is baptized and, as noted earlier, stuckinto the river bottom. Secured in an upright position, the margna stands enclosed withina loop in the kanzala (priest’s stole). Prayer 14 describes the margna as being covered inlight and radiance, which suggests not the white stole but, more accurately, the water,because the water is the Lightworld. Removing a tiny klila that has so far encircled hisfinger next to the one bearing the Šum Yawar Ziwa, the priestly gold ring, the priestslips this wreath onto his margna. The staff, then, is subject to a twofold activity: bap-tism—a form of investiture—and wreathing.16 In this very graphic manner, the margnaseems to represent a priest or an \u0001utra.Yet another item is a personified Lightworld being, for a drabša on the riverbank re-ceives treatment like a priest. When the persons to be baptized grasp hold of the drabšapole before they descend into the water, the act can be interpreted as a kušta. The bannermarks the presence of the Lightworld, and its length of cloth must avoid the earth be-neath it. This correlates with the rules for a priest’s clothes, which likewise may not comeinto contact with the ground. Both margna and drabša receive a klila. The evergreen klilais a female symbol, a counterpart to the white crown, which is always coded as male.17While he stands in the water, the priest draws three circles in it with his margna inorder to bind the forces of darkness. Prayer 15 speaks of seven walls of iron, which inall likelihood refer directly to the priest’s activity. He must rid the water of evil, makingit suitable for baptism. Only one-ninth of the water particles are pure18—the rest aremixed or evil—but the ninth part is, of course, crucial. The central baptism prayer isprayer 18, in which the priest calls on the first person to join him in the water: “In thename of Life! Let every man whose strength enableth him and who loveth his soul,come and go down to the jordan and be baptised and receive the Pure Sign; put onrobes of radiant light and set a fresh wreath on his head!”19As noted, the lack of investiture after baptism has been a puzzlement to commenta-tors on the maƒbuta, especially so to Segelberg. He feels that originally there must havebeen an investiture, and that the Mandaeans are now using the rasta symbol ineffec-tively.20 Segelberg cannot abandon the idea that all baptisms are initiatory. When hequotes a so far unpublished Mandaean text, which states, “It is the water in which weclothe ourselves,”21 he is unable to hear the text out, that is, he cannot accept the wateras a garment. However, in prayer 18, the expression “put on robes of radiant light” alsorefers not to actual, material clothes but to the water, which is the Lightworld incarnate,the “garment of light” enveloping the rasta already on the bodies in the water.Instead of looking in vain for “typological” initiations and for after-the-fact investi-ture, one must instead recall that Mandaeans prepared for baptism are no neophytesready to step into a new stage of life, acquiring a new religion, or new selves. TheMandaeans are secure in their identities. In baptism, they seek reaffirmation, consolida-tion with the Lightworld, and a reintegration with fellow Mandaeans past and present.Like all Mandaean rituals, the maƒbuta re-create and reconfirm the laufa, the vital con-nection between the earthly world and the Lightworld.Masiqta Zihrun Raza Kasia, the text quoted by Segelberg, interprets the priest’s left-to-right movement when he grasps the person in the water as an act of clothing with the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"84Ritualsgarments of Life.22 The movement is, indeed, another pervasive item in the Mandaeansymbolic universe, and it corresponds to the vertical movement from earth to Lightworld.However, an earthly, human being never fully belongs in either realm. By immersionin baptism, Mandaeans secure the laufa, a connection that cannot be severed as long asritual life persists.I suggest that the baptism is a “horizontal death mass,” that is, it foreshadows themasiqta, the death mass (to be treated in the next chapter). The movement down intothe water symbolizes and prefigures the final, vertical movement, at the death of thebody, up to the Lightworld. A rasta is worn at both rituals, and the technical term toraise up (SLQ I)23 is used for the activity and the outcome in both baptism and deathmass. Horizontal and vertical movements mirror one another, and the right-to-left pat-tern marks the path from earthly, female world to male Lightworld.In the water, each person is signed with water across the forehead, and eachindividual’s name is mentioned in the formula “N., son of N., thou hast been signedwith the Sign of Life and the name of the Life and the name of Manda-d-Hiia werepronounced upon thee.”24 Drinking the three handfuls of water, the celebrant is invitedto “be healed and strengthened!” Consuming the water can be understood as a kindof internal baptism. “May kušta heal you and raise you up!” says the priest, and thisis repeated by the baptized person. The two then shake hands, confirming the mutualwish. According to prayer 19, the name Hazazban and names of other Lightworldentities are spoken over the baptized person. The names seal and protect.Back up on land, the baptized await smearings with sesame paste. This ritual seg-ment has caused problems for some interpreters, such as Segelberg, who feels that thesmearings appear in the wrong order; to him, oil signs should occur before wreath-ing.25 But his view seems unduly influenced by ancient Near Eastern royal enthrone-ment ideologies, which are only partially useful for comparison. The baptized persondoes not become a king, and the oil prayers 22–24 nowhere even hint at royalty rites.Instead, the oil is emphasized as healer and protector from illness. It has come downfrom the Lightworld “to heal, uplift, raise up and ameliorate all pains, diseases, com-plaints, tumors (and) the seven mysteries that inhabit the body.”26 This prayer has apolemical tenor, for it takes the opportunity to stress that the oil is that of Mandaeism,not of Christianity nor of the Ishtar worshipers.Polemical issues figure centrally in prayer 21, recited while the baptized step up onthe riverbank in order to receive the sesame sign. Here, pihta, kušta, and mambuha(water drink) are listed among the primary bearers of witness for the newly baptizedsouls. After the signing, the persons go down to the river to splash water on their rightarms, a rite that Segelberg rightly sees as a form of kušta with the water.27Like sesame, pihta and mambuha are substances that originally descended from theLightworld. Salt must be present in the pihta dough, for the celebrants are alive (in themasiqta, as we shall see, the pihta symbolizing the dead person is saltless). At the mo-ment when the third bowlful of water is thrown over the left shoulder, the priest says,“For your left.”28 “The left” signifies Ruha, associated with the female realm and theearth, who in this way is allotted her rightful share.Let me make a brief aside here. In the film Mandaean Ceremony, made by an assis-tant to Drower in Qalat Saleh, Iraq, in 1954, a small boy forgets this step and insteadof throwing the water away, drinks the third bowlful. Nobody reacts.29 I was thinking"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Baptism (Maƒbuta)85of this film as I watched the video of Majid’s baptism (see chapter 2). Then I leanedforward and focused especially carefully as Majid, crouching in his wet rasta, is about tothrow the bowlful of water over his shoulder, and he does it. I exclaimed, “Thank Godyou did that right!” The others laughed, and I explained to them that in the film, thelittle boy does it incorrectly.On that occasion, Majid’s wife, Abir, watched with interested amusement (she wasnot with him in Iraq at the baptism). “Why are they taking so long?” she asked me. Itold her that they have to get all the evil off her husband and all the good spirits onhim. “Oh, I see,” she replied, laughing and leaning back in the sofa, “there’s a lot to getoff him! No wonder it takes time!” “No,” I said, “it’s like that for everybody.”Now I return to the sequence of the baptism ritual. After a third kušta, the priestrecites the four hatamta (sealing) prayers 25–28 over each person. These prayers protectthem from evil powers, and their souls are now “bound and sealed,” immune to attacksby illnesses and curses. Following a number of prayers, a fourth handshake occurs afterthe recital of numbers 71 and 72, an especially powerful combination of prayers. Prayer72 is Mandaeism’s “chief sacramental formula,”30 asking forgiveness of sins for pastand present Mandaeans. In addition, it specifically mentions the food provided for thebaptism ritual. Indeed, the prayer’s enigmatic title,”Good is the good for the good” (tabtaba ltaba), shows the importance of the effect of food on the good people, for tabarefers to the food benefiting “the good people” (ltaba), who are partaking of the foodand those who are commemorated in the ritual. This is a good example of Mandaeanfondness for wordplay.The four appearances of the kušta occur at these points: (1) after the baptized havebeen signed with water across their foreheads, (2) after the sesame smearings, (3) fol-lowing pihta and mambuha, and (4) at the closing of the sacramental prayer 72. I in-terpret them as a reconfirmed laufa with alive and departed Mandaeans and with theLightworld. Laufa is chiefly expressed in terms of food, the prime symbolic means ofexchange across the realms. In all four instances of the kušta, the celebrants have justreceived some kind of life-giving substance ultimately stemming from the Lightworld.These four are water (twice, externally across the forehead), the mambuha drink, sesame,and pihta. Both externally and internally, the baptized have been fed by the Lightworld.The food purifies, revives, and sustains them as Mandaeans.The well-worn term realized eschatology would seem at least partially legitimate withrespect to the maƒbuta. Salvation is already at hand. Still, the constantly created redemp-tion remains incomplete, for it must be balanced at the end of earthly life with the finalliberation from this life. While it persists, life on earth is neither free nor automatic butmust be continuously reconfirmed in its dependence on the Lightworld. The exampleof the maƒbuta demonstrates the human responsibility for keeping up the laufa. It isnot just a matter of the Lightworld benevolently sharing its bounty.Becoming Who You AreAgain, I wish to emphasize the importance of an already existing, communal Mandaeanidentity, as exemplified in the baptism ritual. Mandaeans (like Manichaeans and doubt-less other ancient Gnostics) belong in clearly defined communities. Identity is chiefly a"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"86Ritualscommunal matter. But scholars tend to remain fascinated by the singular initiation ritual,its lone subject, and the ritual’s concomitant dramatics of personal transformation. Thus,individual identity is overemphasized. The conversion model featuring a reborn per-son, a neophyte, seems hard to resist. As indicated, such a pattern, with its narrowlyviewed “ideal-type,” initiatory form of baptism, may derive from scholarly Christian biases.However, this model has limited use in Mandaeism.Any study of ritual needs to establish what the ritual accomplishes and means to itspractitioners. Native exegesis must be consulted, above all else. If no such direct exege-sis is available, it should be teased out of the text—or out of other forms of evidence. Aritual such as the Mandaean baptism creates and re-creates meaning, reconstituting andundergirding the realities discernible in the ceremonial goings-on. One might say thatrituals reconfirm consensual realities.From a scholarly viewpoint, rituals of course do not fall from heaven but are humancreations. Needless to say, repeated rituals are created in order to be performed morethan once in a person’s life time. But the mere fact of repetition appears to be disagree-able to scholars who—consciously or not—operate with an ideal model of baptism, amodel based on initiation. As noted in chapter 1, I consider rituals to reflect a particu-lar understanding of work, emerging from everyday experiences of labor. Creators ofrituals find their models in work, and as in ordinary life, some tasks are once-and-for-all, while others require cyclical or seasonal reproductions. Regular intake of food isnecessary, but one may have to be inoculated against a certain disease only once inone’s life. Mandaean baptism is understood according to the food model, while a priestinitiation fits the once-in-a-lifetime pattern.When Sevrin states that rituals in Gnosticism are “in disagreement with its mostprofound character,”31 he seems to subscribe to an abstract, so-called spiritualized viewof Gnostic religiosity, one disproved by many forms of Gnosticism, and certainly byMandaeism. On the other hand, when Gnostics themselves criticize rituals, they do soprimarily for two reasons: either the (orthodox Jewish or Christian) non-Gnostic prac-tices are seen as useless and impotent, or the traditional rituals are considered to be inneed of new modes of understanding. Very rarely is the idea of rituals as such rejected.To make Gnosticism into a kind of abstract philosophy deprives the religion of its basisin concrete reality.A lived, practiced religion presupposes rituals. To view rituals along a time spectrumfrom the “once-and-for-all” through “occasional” to “frequently repeated productions”is a line of scholarly inquiry that has not yet been fully explored. Any examination ofrituals in a given religion must take that religion’s basic cosmologies and mythologiesinto consideration. If the religion has both initiatory and repeated rituals, an analysis ofthem will yield, among other things, information about that religion’s understanding ofwork and production.In this chapter, I have presented maƒbuta as a specific example of a repeated ritualin Mandaeism. I have argued that the ritual is best comprehended within the greaterhorizon of Mandaean cosmology. As one of the means to constantly re-create the laufa,the maƒbuta has its natural place in Mandaeism. The next chapter will investigate an-other laufa creation, one particular form of the masiqta, the death mass: the “masiqta ofthe Parents,” the Tabahata masqita."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"8The Tabahata Masiqta87In her introduction to Haran Gawaita, Drower says:To [the Mandaean] the immutable and sacro-sanct elements of his religion are the an-cient rituals, baptism and the various forms of the sacramental meal. It does not worryhim that there are a number of creation stories, contradictory to one another or that thereis confusion in his heterogeneous pantheon of spirits of light and darkness. What doesmatter is that no rule of ritual purity be broken, and that every gesture and action pre-scribed for ritual shall be rigidly observed.1The Mandaean masiqta (death mass) is performed three days after the death of a per-son, unless an astrologically “bad” (mbattal) day interferes. It is an extremely complex ritual,focusing on the spirit (ruha) and the soul (nišimta), the two upper elements constitutingthe human being. Because the body (pagra) cannot rise to the Lightworld, it receives littleor no attention in the masiqta. The emphasis rests on the joining of spirit and soul, forthese must accompany one another upwards in order to be incorporated into a new,Lightworld body, the \u0001uƒtuna. This is the masiqta’s goal. In addition, the ritual aims toincorporate the newly deceased into the community of the Mandaean ancestors in theLightworld. Like the baptism ritual, the masiqta effects a re-created, reestablished laufa.Death masses differ somewhat with respect to prayers and numbers of required priestlyparticipants.2 The masiqta I present here is the “masiqta of the parents” (Tabahata), anevent occurring only once a year, on the last day of the five-day intercalary period Panja. Itis a double masiqta,3 performed in two parts, the first of which has two segments. I willdescribe the masiqta in three sections, relying on Drower’s fieldwork accounts and on hereditions and translations of Mandaean texts. Prayers, priestly instructions, commentaries,and activities will be laid out in conjunction with one another to show the complex inter-actions of religious thought, imagery, and ritual proceedings. I start with the preparationsfor the Tabahata masiqta, then move to the three descriptive parts, and end with a shortinterpretive section.PreliminariesIn its entirety, a regular, single masiqta takes about twelve hours,4 but the annual Tabahatamasiqta requires even more time. Of the several priestly celebrants, at least one must be a"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"88Ritualsganzibra. As usual, an ašganda (helper) supplies the priests with certain materials for theceremony. Preparations begin the day before the masiqta. On the day of the ceremony itself,the celebrating priests perform minor ablutions and partake of two ritual meals, zidqa brikha(blessed oblation) and dukhrana (commemoration). During the second meal, the priestsbegin to impersonate the dead person(s) for whom the masiqta is celebrated.5 The presenceof laypeople, as spectators, is required during these public rituals, but the masiqta properis conducted inside the mandi (cult hut), unseen by anybody but the participating priests.6Before they enter the mandi, however, the ganzibra, assisted by the ašganda, kills adove outside the hut. The two men imitate the two primordial \u0001utras who first carriedout a masiqta, the masiqta for Adam, the first man.7 Impersonating “Pure Ether,” AyarDakia, the ganzibra puts the dove under his foot, lays the knife against the bird’s throat,and, watched by the ašganda, intones:“‘In the name of Life and the name of Knowledge-of-Life”’ is being mentioned over thee!Ptahil summoneth thee and Hibil-Ziwa commandeth thy slaughter.’” And then he drewthe knife across the mystery of its throat and said ‘Thy flesh is pure for souls of thosemasiqtas who are called on (by name). With thee, Adam shall rise to the Light, and anywho eat of thee shall live, be made healthful and well-established. The name of Life andthe name of Knowledge-of-Life is mentioned upon thee.’8The dove, called Ba, symbolizes the spirit, and the priest assures it that it will rise withthe soul.9 After the killing of the dove, the ganzibra and the ašganda immerse themselvesin the river. The ašganda brings the sacrificed dove with him into the water. Back up onland, the ganzibra takes the bird, plucks away some of the feathers on the right side of thebird’s breast, cuts out a piece of flesh, roasts it in the fire burning on the precincts, dips thepiece in salt, and shreds it into tiny bits. Later these pieces will be distributed to the cele-brating priests as they arrange their ritual trays (tarianas). The fragmented bird flesh is called“the portion of the Ba.” Drower describes what happens next: “The ganzibra wraps thebody of the dove (the Ba) in palm-fibre, enters the cult-hut and pushes it into the spacebetween the roof and the northern wall, so that it will face the celebrants during the masiqta.”10In the meantime, the other priests have purified themselves, prepared ritual foods, andcleansed their tarianas. Fatiras, small, round, saltless biscuits, are half baked, and a cer-tain number of these are distributed to each of the priests. Now each priest arranges hisclean tariana with the following: a small water bottle; a cup of miša (sesame oil mixedwith pounded dates); the allotted fatiras (the total must be sixty, or fifteen biscuits each forfour celebrating priests); a drinking bowl containing four raisins; a twig of myrtle; and,finally, shreds of these foods: Ba, seeds of grape, pomegranate, quince, dates, coconut,almond, walnut, and citrus. All the trays are placed within the mandi. A second tray foreach priest holds a fire basin with fuel and a stand with a cube of incense. In full ritualgarb, the priests enter the mandi and remain secluded there until the end of the masiqta.The First Part of the Masiqta: The Sixty FatirasEach celebrant stands inside the mandi in front of his two trays; the one to the left, withthe foodstuffs, represents the spirit, the one to the right, the soul.11 After reciting a prayerfor his mouth cover (pandama),12 each priest picks up the bottle and the sprig of myrtle"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Tabahata Masiqta89on his tray and pours some of the water from the bottle over the four raisins in thebowl. Kneading the raisins in the water, he turns the liquid into hamra (wine).13While he is doing this, he recites prayer 33, the first of the masiqta prayers. Thisprayer addresses the life-giving “water of Life,” which has come from the Lightworld,and which erases evil. Also:As the water falleth on the earth, so shall their sins, trespasses, follies, stumblings andmistakes be loosed from those who love the name of Truth (kušta) and from the souls ofthis masiqta, and from (the souls of) our fathers, teachers, brothers and sisters who havedeparted the body, and those who (still) live in the body.14Next, the priest lifts the incense cube from the right tray and salutes the First Life inthis manner:Hail Yuzataq, Gnosis of Life, Source of Life; He who unveileth the silence, giveth hopeand keepeth the prayers of the spirits and souls of the righteous and believing men intothe Place of Light. . . . Pray ye from there for us and we will pray from here for you. Allfruits wither: all sweet odours passeth away, but not the fragrance of Gnosis of Life, whichcometh not to an end nor passeth away for an age of ages.15Like prayers, incense rises toward the Lightworld, maintaining the laufa. Incense isnow thrown on the fire, and the smoke wafts toward the left in order to envelop theitems on the left tray in the fragrance of the Lightworld. 1012 explains the effect ofprayer and of the wafting onto “the Mystery of the Mingling” (i.e., the liquid in thehamra bowl) as giving the soul a hand, purifying her, lifting her up, and mingling herwith “the mystery of the Water.”16The next, very long prayer, number 35, includes these words toward its end: “Spiritsand souls sit (here) as guilty, (yet) by thy name they shall rise as innocent.”17 After that,three other long prayers follow, numbers 75–77. The first one describes how the LightworldThe two tarianas at the masiqta. From Drower, Water into Wine.

Even the evil ones,“sitting on thrones of rebellion,” are overpowered by the forces of the Light and end uppraising these.18 When the priest reaches the words “Turn back, push back, remove andmake impotent Angels of wrath, frost and hail from my land and My house” in prayer75,19 the effect is that “spirit and soul are estranged from hatred, envy, dissention and evilthought.”20 At the very end, prayer 75 asks for the soul’s successful establishment in theLightworld. And at these words, says 1012, “soul and spirit take hands and are heartened.”21The next prayer in the segment, prayer 76, mentions the Perfecter of Souls, whogives the soul a radiant garment and a wreath made of victories. The soul’s own goodworks while on earth, including proper partaking in commemorative meals for the dead,will precede the soul on its way upward and make the soul perfect. Just as the priest willnow eat for the benefit of the ascending soul, so that soul, while on earth, ought to haveobserved the duties of dukhrana and zidqa brikha.At the recital of prayer 77 the foods on the tariana are illuminated.22 Before the re-cital prayer 9, which follows, there is a formula that begins, “May there be laufa, solaceof Life, and forgiveness of sins for me.” At these words, “the spirit moveth towards thesoul and saith to her, ‘By thy life, my sister in kušta, this is my day of days! Mine eyesare no longer dazzled and fleshly sloth is removed from my heart.’”23Prayer 35 now reappears, and during its recital the priest purifies the soul’s “eyes andears, the portals of the brain, and bones, heart and liver.”24 It is worth noting that prayer35 is an extremely versatile; it is called “good for all occasions.”25 Indeed, the reappear-ance of prayers—at different times, in the same ritual—is an important feature of Mandaeanrituals. The prayers may have different effects depending on where they appear in a ritualsequence. As tools, prayers perform functions that vary according to where the ritual worker,the priest, is posited in the ritual production toward the construction of a complete ritualedifice. To give an example: frame carpentry is different than fine cabinetmaking, but thebuilder is still in the construction business, using the tools of his profession. Repetition ofprayers and specific, set prayer sequences surface regularly in Mandaean rituals, and Ishall have more to say about the significance of these features later on.The Great “First World,” commenting on the proceedings during prayer 35, remindsthe priest to insert the zhara (warning, i.e., the name of the deceased). Thus the formulain prayer 35 is individualized, adjusted to the present moment: “barred to this the soulof [name inserted] of this masiqta is the gate of sin, and we will open to him the Gateof Light.”26All through these prayers the priests have wafted incense toward the left onto thefoodstuffs and other items on their tarianas. Drower explains:Throughout this opening part of the ritual [the priest] has held myrtle in his left hand.He now twists it into a tiny wreath. Meanwhile, the ashganda has left the hut and goes tothe yardna, taking flour with him. He mixes this with a little water in the palm of hishand and makes a saltless dough. As he goes by the fire on his way back to the hut, hepasses the dough thrice through the flame, saying, “The name of Manda-d-Hiia is pro-nounced on thee.” This is called “the testimony of the fire.” On the ashganda’s re-entryinto the hut, bearing the dough, each celebrant takes a pinch of it from him.27This dough fragment becomes the pihta. Eight pihta prayers follow, the first of whichopens “the great Door of Nourishment to the soul and spirit.”28 Together, the eight"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Tabahata Masiqta91prayers symbolize the eight months of pregnancy.29 In this manner the gestation of theLightworld soul is foreshadowed.Each man dips his priestly gold seal ring, Šum Yawar Ziwa (the name of Yawar Ziwa),into the hamra bowl and recites the two prayers for the mambuha. (In this case themambuha is identified with the hamra in the bowl, but mambuha usually refers to theritual drink of river water.) The last sentence in the second mambuha prayer is “(Like)the mingling of wine with water, so may your truth, your righteousness and your faithbe added to those who love your name of Truth.”30 This mingling, by those who lovethe name of Truth, the priests, is threefold: in the priests themselves, mediated throughthem as activators for the ascending spirit and soul, and in the spirit and soul.31 Thehamra bowl is a womb, now fertilized by the priests’ actions.Prayers 46 and 47 are klila prayers, which interweave spirit and soul, and the klila isset on the head of the soul. The next prayer, 48, an oil prayer, clears the soul’s vision.32The masiqta has now reached a crucial stage. If errors in the ritual are committed atthis point, at prayer 49, the proceedings must be halted at once, and severe penalties aredue. Carefully, each priest puts down the klila and the pihta on the tariana, and he placeshis right hand on the first of the fatiras (as seen in figure 1, there are fifteen fatiras to atray—the total number of fatiras must be sixty). Prayer 49 begins, “This, the glory and lightof life, is to bring forth the spirit and soul from the body and to clothe the living soul ina living garment.”33 Further, the prayer invokes 9auriel, the angel of death, and the soulis said to acquire vestments of light after all bodily components have been removed fromit.34 Envious but impressed, the hostile planets behold the soul’s radiant clothes, but theycan do nothing to harm the soul at this point. Ascending, the soul reaches the scales ofAbatur, where the soul and spirit are questioned “as to their names, their signs, theirblessing, their baptism and everything that is therewith.”35Each priest now sits down, pulls off a shred of the pihta, and folds it over the klilabut makes certain that the two ends of the dough fragment do not meet. This act iscalled “clothing the wreath.”36 In his left hand the priest holds aloft the klila with thepihta piece, and while he holds it, he uses his right hand to move the first of the fatirasto the front of his tray. Next he picks a little of each kind of fruit, seed, and nut and apiece of dove flesh and puts these fragments on the fatira. It is now an “arrangement”(qina). He then dips four fingers, tips pressed together, into the oil and signs the fatirawith oil three times, from left to right.The triple smearing takes place three times, so that there are nine passes of oil foreach biscuit. These passes are required at specific lines in prayer 49: at “that which iswith her of the body,” at “the House of Abatur,” and after the phrase “the spirit of N.[zhara] of this masiqta hath gone and become of (the same) nature as the soul.”37 As aresult of these passes paired with the required words, the soul gazes at the spirit, reachesout for her, and embraces her.38Risen to a safe position, the soul sits in Lightworld splendor. At the requisite prayer,number 50, another triple sign of the fatira is due. And again, at prayer 51, at the words“When this, the soul of N., casteth off her bodily garment, she putteth on a dress of lifeand becometh like unto the Great Life in light.”39 At prayer 52 a triple pass also occurs.Returning to the rest of his fatiras, the priest deals with each one in turn, beginningall over again with prayer 33. His acts are identical to those for the first fatira, with oneexception: the very last fatira, the fifteenth, receives no sign at prayer 52. This omission"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"92Ritualsleaves an open-ended situation, and the point of this will become clear later. Next thetreated biscuits are piled into a stack, on which the priest puts his hand while recitingprayer 53, the “seal of the masiqta.”The crucial part involving the prayer sequence 49–53 is now finished, but prayer 49,alone, is repeated, with the difference that at the phrase “the House of Abatur” it is notthe name of the dead person that is inserted but the word tabahatan (our ancestors).40This is most fitting, for the stack of biscuits now invoked represents the assembledancestors, whom the risen soul will join.Lifting his hand from the pile of fatiras, the priest repeats the first mambuha prayer,44, which invokes the source of living water, Biriawiš. Having held the pihta-wrappedklila in his left hand for a long time, the celebrant finally separates the dough from theklila and puts the wreath down on the pile of fatiras. Mysteriously, the wreath is called“an inner heart situated in the breast.”41 This exegesis associates klila and the dove, theBa, whose breast meat has been distributed onto each of the fatiras in the stack. Bothklila and Ba are spirit symbols.“Should the slightest error be made at this point, the entire masiqta is invalid;moreover, the soul for whom it is celebrated may be injured. The priest who madethe mistake is automatically disqualified from his office,” says Drower.42 The priestmust say “One and two and three” as he separates klila from pihta. Then he breaksoff a piece of the top fatira in the stack and one from the fatira on the bottom.43 Thisbreaking off marks a mouth opened for the soul.44 Obviously, the soul, as a kind offetus handled by the priest, is now ready to take nourishment. The priest presses thetwo separated pieces of fatiras and a sliver of the dove meat into the pihta and thenpours water from the water bottle into the hamra bowl. This mingling of water and“wine” is “the union of the cosmic Father and Mother, a union previously sanctifiedby the dipping in of the priestly ring. The Divine Womb, represented by the hamrabowl, is now fertilised.”45“Eating in the Above, drinking in the Above and casting incense in the Above,” thepriest utters, while he folds the pihta around the foodstuffs pressed into it and dips itinto the bowl, while reciting prayer 54.46 The effect of this action is that spirit, soul, andbody are now firmly integrated, the soul being clothed with the mystery of the cosmicparents: the Father, water, and the Mother, the hamra.47Prayer 55, short and to the point, follows: “The Great Life spoke and revealed (opened)with His mouth, in His own radiance, light and glory.”48 Each priest now imitates theGreat Life, for he “pushes aside his pandama, opens his mouth and drops the pihta intoit, swallowing it whole. Then he drinks the hamra.”49The mediating ašganda enters the mandi with a water bottle that has so far beenkept outside. This is called the “outer bottle,” to distinguish it from the bottle on thetarianas. The “outer bottle” contains halalta (rinsing water), which the priests use torinse their bowls. They then drink that water, for nothing of it must be spilled. Prayers56 and 57 follow, and throughout the rest of the prayers, numbers 58–72, the priestsextend their hands above the heap of fatiras. Prayer 91 is the last prayer for this part ofthe masiqta. At the end, they all exchange the kušta, saying, “May Kušta strengthenyou, my brother-\u0001uthras! The living have been joined in communion, just as \u0001uthras intheir škintas are joined in communion. Pleasing is your fragrance, my brothers, in yourinnermost, that is all full of radiance!”50"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Tabahata Masiqta93The Second Part: The First Treatment of the Six FatirasSix fatiras (not shown in figure 1) have been left untreated on each tariana. Each priest’sattention now turns to these. Drower admits that she fails to comprehend why these sixbiscuits now require a full, separate treatment.51 There are differences in the masiqtafor these six, and The Great “First World” gives the best account of how these six fatirasare handled.As before, the action begins with prayer 32, and it continues, as in the masiqta forthe batch of sixty fatiras, up to prayer 49. Then a voice of warning is heard from theLightworld regarding the phrase “that which is with her (ma d-bh)’: ‘Be heedful lest(thou signest a sign (at) the Ma d-bh (or) the soul will not enter.’”52 If a priest errs bymaking a first sign on the sixth fatira with sesame oil at prayer 49 in this second round,he resembles a date palm consumed by fire. In addition, his own right eye and the lefteye of the rising soul suffer injury, and the priest himself is polluted.53Only the first sign—of three, as in the masiqta for the sixty—appears to cause destruc-tion at this point. The two other signs at prayer 49 seem to produce no harm. Prayer 50follows, with no signs this time. At prayer 51, the priest must again be on guard againstsigning. At prayer 52, also, the priest must restrain his hand, making no pass at theconclusion of this prayer. A sign here would seriously stain the soul.After this section, the prayers run as before, in the masiqta for the sixty fatiras, up toprayer 91, which concluded the first round. But a whole new series of prayers nowensue, twenty-four in all, ending with the large Tabahatan, the genealogy prayer 170.So far, one notices that neither the sixtieth fatira in the first round of the masiqtanor the sixth biscuit in the second treatment has received a sign during the recitals ofprayers 49–52. This has left an open-ended, suspenseful situation. The Great “First World”explains regarding the first sixty fatiras that they “keep the (unborn) babe safe: thirty forthe days, and thirty for the nights during which it breathes not (yet) the breath of life.”54And 1012 considers the six fatiras to be the head of the so far headless body created bythe sixty biscuits.55 It now becomes clear why there is no sesame oil sign at the sixtiethfatira at prayer 52 in the first round of the masiqta. The reason is that the sixtieth fatirakeeps the headless body ready for the creative act of attaching the “head.” This head isthe sixth fatira, to be added to the body already created by the sixty biscuits. But thequestion still remains why an open-ended situation, the lack of oil signs at prayers 49–52, still exists for the head.Procedure for creating a Lightworld body (\u0001uƒtuna) for the soul. Drawing byauthor."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"94RitualsThis question will not be answered until the third section of the Tabahata masiqta.Having completed the second round, the priests now deconsecrate themselves andprepare and consume the same two meals that preceded the first part of the masiqta.Symmetry rules.The ashganda collects the piles of fatiria from the tariania and takes down the dove fromthe north wall. He wraps bread and dead bird together in a white cloth and places thebundle reverently aside somewhere in the bit manda. . . . the bundle is interred by the ashgandain the sacred area. Any part may be chosen except ground lying east of the cult-hut.56The Second Treatment of the Six Fatiras: The Tabahata MasiqtaNow, finally, comes the answer to the puzzle of the open-ended acts, the lacking oilsigns. As noted, only at the festival of Panja, the five days between the old and the newyear, does the entire sequence, the “masiqta of the Parents,” take place. The third sec-tion of the ritual ties up the “loose ends” of other masiqtas performed throughout theyear and completes the lacking oil signs so far. At Panja, when access to the Lightworldis open and unimpeded, the time has come to bring everybody who has died during theold year safely to the goal.57 Masiqtas are also celebrated for Mandaeans who have diedimpure deaths during the past year. This is so because the Tabahata masiqta takes careof any evil effects of such deaths, and it helps those souls stuck in the matartas sincebodily departure.One may safely say, therefore, that the Tabahata masiqta constitutes an annual clos-ing up of necessarily incomplete death rituals performed during the past year. Spiritsand souls wander about until they are liberated by the Tabahata, for this masiqta func-tions as the final sealing of the united body, the \u0001uƒtuna.58 1012 warns against the errorof performing the Tabahata masiqta at times other than Panja.59The Great “First World” instructs the priest in the following manner: the Mothermasiqta, that is, the ritual of the sixty fatiras and the first treatment of the six fatiras, isdifferent from the next component. This is the Father masiqta, in which the six fatirasare treated for a second time, now smeared with sesame oil.60 Together, then, the firsttwo treatments mark the Mother masiqta, while the Father masiqta stands separately,concluding the work. The fifteenth fatira in the section for the sixty, and the last biscuitin the first treatment of the six are now signed at the requisite places in the centralprayers, numbers 49–52.The sequence of prayers for this section varies from those in the preceding two sec-tions. The difference begins with prayer 91, which concluded the masiqta of the sixty.After a segment of ten other prayers, at prayer 9, the soul becomes enveloped by themysteries of the Father to such an extent that the purgatory dwellers are unable to blockher way.61 The two klila prayers, numbers 46 and 47, are omitted. This is a tellingfeature, for the klila marks a spirit symbol, and a reference to it is avoided at this point,in all likelihood because the spirit has become one with the soul.As noted, at prayers 49–52 all six fatiras—not just the last one—receive signs. At thispoint, The Great “First World” takes care to note that the myrtle on the pile of fatiras is theseal of prayer 52, for the myrtle is “clothing which preserves the soul. So she goes andputs it on, rejoices in it and is enveloped in it, for it is a body into which she entereth.”62"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Tabahata Masiqta95Even though the seals of the soul are now concluded, the soul has not yet arrived at itsgoal.

The sheer mass of tangible materials and the meticulousrules for the masiqta may strike an observer as most mystifying. Drower, for example,admits that she is put off by the initial dove sacrifice, an act she considers unnecessary,for, in her opinion, the Mandaeans are “above all things, baptizers,” not sacrificers.64But the dove is the body most appropriate for the spirit in its ascension aspect. Ba is apun for the indicated spirit. It means “with it,” that is, “with the soul,” a euphemisticway of mentioning the spirit without directly invoking it.As the priest handles the various elements on his tray, one notes a consistent right-to-left symbolism. Incense is wafted from right to left, that is, from Lightworld to earth,and the food elements are cloaked in the fragrance from the upper world. Klila andpihta remain in the priest’s left hand. The wreath and the piece of dough are still intheir earthly modes, but through the mediating stage of qinas they aspire to becomefatiras, the heaped-up ancestors on the right side. Appropriately, these are treated withthe priest’s right hand. The clothed wreath—a soul-wrapped spirit—is moved from left toright.The fatiras play the double role of ancestors and rising soul. One notes that thesignings on the biscuits are performed, or emphatically not, while the pihta is held aloftin the priest’s left hand. I see the treated qinas, which are fatiras-in-the-making, halfbaked, as being both “here” on earth and “there” in the Lightworld. They manifest thesoul’s final goal. So, these biscuits move back and forth between signifying ancestorssafe in the upper worlds and symbolizing the rising soul being led upward, step by step,seal by seal, and, most important, by withheld seals when required. Seals in the wrongplace would impair the soul’s development in its temporary home in the symbolicallycreated wombs of the priests. For thirty days and thirty nights, neatly corresponding tothe sixty fatiras, the body will mature. Its head is provided by the six in the secondround. (By any computation, this is a speeded-up pregnancy.) Full integration of thecompleted body occurs only with the second treatment of the six fatiras during Panja,an auspicious time when deaths turn into perfect lives in the Lightworld.When, in the two first parts of the masiqta, the phrase “our ancestors” (Tabahatan),is inserted into prayer 49 at the appropriate spot, the prayer focuses on the ancestors,not on the soul. Only the ancestors can assure that the rising soul achieves its goal. Thepile of fatiras is the laufa made manifest, and all ascended Mandaeans are present inthe heap. Thus symbolized, they are finally buried with the dove.What about the klila on top of the heap? The wreath is called “the inner heart,”65and when it is disconnected from the pihta and placed on the pile of biscuits, it invigo-rates the ancestors with the myrtle’s evergreen life force. Even if the spirit must be over-come, in the sense that it will be subsumed by the soul, the klila as spirit symbol stillholds a positive value both for the “raw,” ascending soul and for the “half-baked” an-cestors. These ancestors feed the soul when a piece from the top and one from thebottom fatira are broken off. 1012 calls this “the opening of the mouth of the soul.”When the priestly ring is dipped in the hamra bowl, the liquid becomes fertilized.

One notes that they do not chew it,66for the pihta must remain an unmangled fetus, soon safely incubating in the priestly“wombs.” The “male” people par excellence, the priests, have become women!In The Great “First World,” Pure Ether (Ayar Dakia) approaches the king of theLightworld with a question about the lack of sealings in the two first parts of the masiqta.The king’s answer is lengthy, and it includes the following:If thou signest (at the ma d-bh) . . . the soul perisheth and is destroyed.Look at that salt yonder, which is (symbolises) the soul! (Salt) when covered with water,a stole of water covers it, a tunic (ksuia) of water is placed on its shoulders, a girdle ofwater is bound about it and it putteth on leggings of water! When it cometh out of its(watery) dress, and is clothed in air (ether) it becomes changed! It (salt) may lie in theearth a thousand thousand years and yet not be spoilt, but when water reaches it, it goeswrong and is destroyed!Behold! the soul is sealed with sixty-six seals . . . see, (therefore), that signing (performed)at the ma d-bh destroys them and spoils the whole Body (\u0001uƒtuna).67A sign at “ma d-bh” would ruin the sixty-six seals of the soul, which is here depictedin its baptismal rasta. Drawing a parallel between soul and salt, the king states that justas water dissolves salt, so would a seal at “that which is with her” destroy the newlyformed \u0001uƒtuna, the Lightworld body of joined spirit and soul. Attention drawn to thespirit alone at these points (in prayers 49–52) would demolish the entire ritual con-struction. An interesting point in the king’s speech is that water, normally an undisputedlypositive symbol in Mandaeism, is detrimental to the soul understood as salt. The expla-nation delivered to Pure Ether also contains an explicit “physics” lesson on the effectsof the elements water and air on the soul.The carefully choreographed three-part Tabahata masiqta frees the souls caught inthe matartas during the past year. The final part of the ritual (6,2) closes the open-endedacts, sealing the ascended Mandaeans into the community of the ancestors above. Gen-eral scholarly consensus rules that the masiqta liturgy, as found in the Prayerbook andalso partly in GL, belongs in the oldest strata of Mandaean literature. There is thereforeno reason to assume that the time-consuming, meticulous, step-by-step character of theritual is the product of more recent times. What Drower saw and then described inMandaeans and Water into Wine from the 1930s on can be correlated without diffi-culty with Prayerbook liturgies extending back at least to the third century and prob-ably beyond. The origins of ritual commentaries such as Exalted Kingship, 1012, TheGreat “First World,” and Coronation appear to be very old. Despite their linguisticallyyounger features, the texts offer information that may be nearly as ancient as the lit-urgies themselves.68Most chief Mandaean rituals remain the business of priests. Without this class thereligion would not have been kept alive throughout the centuries. How the Mandaeanscreate their officials will be the topic of the next chapter, which centers on the creationof the tarmida, the lower ranking priest."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"98Rituals9The Initiation of the Tarmida98To make a new Mandaean priest of the first level, a tarmida, is an extremely compli-cated matter.1 Most taxing, for initiator (rba) and novice (šualia) alike, is the week theyspend sleepless in the initiation hut (škinta). The entire ritual takes sixty-eight days andrequires set clusterings of rituals and ritual segments. Here I will give as simple a pre-sentation of these proceedings as I can, trying not to violate the initiation ritual by over-simplifying it. In addition to offering a description of the sequence of events, I willfocus on two particular issues, first, the relationship between the novice and his teacher,and second, the emphatic instructions regarding including or excluding certain wordsor formulas at specific points in the ceremonials.Similar to the masiqta, the tarmida initiation ritual can be seen as arranging build-ing blocks in order to construct the new edifice, which is the new priest. The proceed-ings show a kind of logical progression that should, by now, have become familiar tothe reader. In the ritual, the novice is gradually transported from the earthly to theLightworld realm, a goal that necessitates nothing less than a re-creation of the man.2PreparationsAny Mandaean man of pure (not necessarily priestly) family can become a priest.3 Heneed not yet be married, although this is the desirable Mandaean state. In all likeli-hood, the novice has trained as a šganda since childhood and is familiar with the priestlyactivities. He will be ready for initiation after puberty.4 His teacher, a ganzibra, gathersas many priests as can be found for the initiation ceremony. The priests baptize theinitiate, who is then closely inspected, for he must be perfect of body and mentally fit.5Next a ritual slaughter of a sheep both wards off evil and furnishes a fidwa (ransom) forthe novice himself.6 The mutton feeds the community, in anticipatory parallel to thenew priest, who will soon serve his people.The priests construct a reed hut (andiruna) and throw a blue cloth, the “little sky,”over it as a roof. This symbolizes the earthly, female world, ruled by Ruha, in which thenovice will first sit, and then leave. Sacred books are placed in the hut, and the texts"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Initiation of the Tarmida99The Great “First World” and Exalted Kingship must be present; otherwise the initiationwill be invalid. 7 The rba prays the rahmas, the prayers for the day, inside the hut.Outside, the novice sits on a chair, receives his silk taga (crown), and is publicly testedin his knowledge of the baptism liturgy. Spectators are grouped around him. Drabšasstand on his right and left, as do two kintas (ritual clay receptacles).Holding myrtle (asa) in one hand and the closed book of the part of the Prayerbookcalled “The Book of Souls,” the baptism liturgy, in the other, the young man recitesprayers 1–103 from memory. If successful, he joins the other priests in the andiruna.They pray, and soon the other priests leave, and only the novice and his rba are leftinside. Before night falls, the other priests, helped by laypeople, construct another reedhut, a škinta, to the north of the andiruna.8 This hut, named like the heavenly habita-tions, symbolizes the Lightworld, and it receives a white cloth roof, in obvious colorcontrast to the blue roof of the other hut, blue being Ruha’s hue.The novice and his rba spend the night in the andiruna, and the hatchling priestmust not fall asleep. Outside, the laypeople keep up a din of festivities; inside, theteacher instructs his ward. Neither man must leave the hut during the night, but atdawn they emerge, and the hut is taken down. Now the novice stands between thetwo huts—suspended, as it were, between earth and Lightworld—and recites the bap-tism liturgy again. He is watched by his rba and the other priests, who stand insidethe škinta, waiting to receive him into their company. Two laymen witnesses, whohave already given the postulant a piece of silver and one of gold to put on his stole(naƒifa) bring him inside.Baptism and CrowningThe priests in the škinta have been praying and consuming a meal of pihta and mambuha.Now they greet the novice with the word Asuta! (health). He sits down. The others addressa prayer to him, in which he is praised as a pure mirror, an enlightener, and an \u0001utra.9At the line “Rise up, thou great \u0001uthra, to thy feet,” the novice stands up, and “the\u0001uthras and kings who sit in this škinta,” the priests, welcome him as one of their own.For the third time, but now inside the škinta, the novice recites the baptism prayers.10He has already given the chief ganzibra (a man other than his rba) “The Book of Souls”and has also kissed his head. A brief antiphonal scene ensues, for prayer 324 is spokenby the priests, prayer 325 by the laymen witnesses, and prayer 326 by all in unison.Together with the already recited prayer 323, these coronation prayers praise the novice’snew status as king (malka).11 A myrtle-smelling segment follows, during which the rbatakes the myrtle from his pupil’s hand and utters prayer 327, which praises the primor-dial myrtle. All inhale the scent of the plant. Then the novice kisses the heads of bothhis teacher and the senior ganzibra.After he has twisted the myrtle into a tiny klila, the rba asks the other priests forpermission to baptize his pupil. Having obtained consent, the rba and his charge gooutside, and during the baptism the teacher takes care to remember the zhara, the nameinsertion for the candidate, at designated points in the accompanying prayers, for thewhole baptism must be with zharas. For instance, there are zharas in three places: inprayer 18,12 “Behold this soul (N.), who quits destruction for construction, (goes) from"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"100Ritualserror to truth and (leaves) the abode of fear”; in prayer 35; and in prayer 77, “Makevictorious and raise up this soul of N.”After the baptism, kušta is exchanged among all the celebrants, and several prayersare recited before the utterance of two conjoined prayers, numbers 71 and 72. Thesetwo almost always appear together, and they usually conclude a ritual segment. It isimportant to keep track of their appearances throughout the initiation because of spe-cial features in these prayers. Prayer 71 promises that “a wreath from the vine Ruaz”will be placed on the head of the soul of the person for whom the prayer is uttered, andalso for the souls of “our fathers, our teachers, our brothers and our sisters, of thosewho have departed the body and those who are yet in the body.”13 The clause “of ourfathers” should more correctly be rendered “our Parents,” as the phrase is d-abahatan.From Drower, Mandaeans. Used by permission of Brill Academic Publishers."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Initiation of the Tarmida101This inclusive term is used for all Mandaeans, past and present. It occurs in many prayersand is sometimes (though not at this moment) avoided if a zhara occurs in the sameprayer.Prayer 72 is recited with bent knees, a gesture indicating that the prayer focuses onthe Lightworld and not on the particular person indicated by the zhara. In fact, at thispoint the rba is instructed to substitute the phrase d-abahatan for the otherwise expectedzhara in the slot where the prayer pleads, “[F]orgive him his sins, trespasses, follies,stumblings and mistakes.”14 This changes the focus of the prayer from a concern witha specific person to an emphasis on the ancestors in the upper world. Such tailoring ofprayers is required in specific ritual segments.As noted, these two prayers, numbers 71 and 72, when recited in sequence, alwaysconclude a ritual segment, and they are followed by a meal of pihta and mambuha. Themeal completes the circle of events beginning with the postulant’s entry into the škinta.Honoring his crown by removing it from his head, lifting it from his lips to his eyes,and mumbling mqaimitun (be raised up!) sixty-one times, the rba next recites the requi-site prayer 178 for his taga. The text Coronation utters a dire warning against recitingthe wrong prayers at this moment. Should the rba forget himself and mistakenly reciteprayers 2, 4, or 6, which are širiatas (loosening prayers), these prayers would annihilatewhat has been created, deconsecrate what has been consecrated.15 Even if a segmenthas now been concluded, a complete break, which a deconsecration would signify, isout of place. One might say that events are simply going into another round, for onegroup of building blocks is now in place, and another set will follow.A veil is held over the postulant as his baptism dress is removed. He obtains a brand-new garment, and his rba recites the main Mandaean prayer formula over him:My Lord be praised! In the name of the Great First Other-Worldly Life! From far-offworlds of light that are above all works may there be healing, victory, soundness, speechand a hearing, joy of heart and forgiving of sins for me [zhara insertion], through thestrength of Yawar Ziwa and Simat Hiia!16At the rubric for the zhara in prayer 1, the rba inserts both his own and his pupil’sname, making two zharas. This is the first indication of a significant point in the initia-tion: that the ritual affects the teacher, too, not just his novice. While he recites theformula, the rba holds his hand to his head, a gesture that emphasizes his taga.Two women appear, each to wash one of the novice’s legs.17 A banner prayer, #345, comes next, and, in precise parallel to the prayer’s content, the priest in chargemoves the drabša into the hut. He also brings in the Ginza, and all celebrants reenterthe škinta. A series of prayers called kd azil bhira dakia (When the proven, pure onewent) follow.18 These twenty-four prayers describe and praise the new priest, who isnow included among his fellow \u0001utras. He is invited to take his seat among them (prayer246), kuštas are exchanged, and, according to prayer 253, the priests admonish the noviceto remove himself from passions and to achieve identity with the priests.19Eighteen prayers for the drabša ensue (# 330–47), and the priests and the rba ex-change kisses. Each of the others receives a sprig of myrtle (asa) from the rba. Prayers 1,3, 5, and 19, which constitute a recurring sequence, are recited by all. In the first ofthese four prayers, at the words “Then that Lord of Lofty Greatness took a circlet ofradiance, light and glory and set it on my head,”20 the priests crown the novice with the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"102Ritualssilk taga and place their hands on his head. After a number of prayers from both thebaptism and the masiqta liturgies, the priests end with the sealing (hatamta) prayers,numbers 25–28.Marriage and InsigniaPouring a quantity of hamra, water mixed with macerated dates and raisins, into a bowl,the postulant prepares to “marry” a Lightworld spouse. He does this by drinking from thebowl seven times, at the end of each of seven prayers: 181–87. 21 The other priests—thenovice himself is not included here—recite these prayers, which describe Manda d-Hiia,who was consecrated as priest at the beginning of time. Drinking the hamra unites thenovice with his nitupta, his “cloud,” the designation for a female spouse in the worldabove. Because he will now become a citizen of that world, he needs a wife from thatrealm, even if he may already have one (or more) on earth. Like all priests, the new onewill belong to both worlds. The novice is enthroned, invested with his priestly regalia,and joined to the Lightworld beings.A series of antiphonal coronation prayers follow, numbers 305–18, which are ex-changed between the rba and the other full-fledged priests. The rba starts with prayer305, the other priests respond with prayer 312, which is answered by the rba utteringprayer 306, the priests continue with prayer 313, and so on.22 Then the priests placetheir hands on the novice’s priestly golden seal ring, the Šum Yawar Ziwa, as they reciteprayer 319, which bestows Lightworld strength on the novice.The priests distribute additional crowns to the novice, an act accompanied and de-scribed by prayers # 320–21. The novice arranges his ritual tray, the kinta, which holdsthe paraphernalia for burning incense. Putting his hand on his own head, touching hiscrown, he recites the salutation prayer, Asiet Malkia,23 which asks for health and victoryfor a great number of Mandaean Lightworld beings (including some female ones), Johnthe Baptist, and the reciter himself. After finishing the devotional prayers, the rahmas106–109, the novice removes his hand from his head, indicating that he now stops pray-ing expressly for himself. He throws incense into the fire at the incense prayers 8 and 34.Another set of rahmas follow, prayers 113–17, then the very long prayer 77, andfinally a repetition of the prayer sequence at the crowning ceremony, the prayers 9, 35,15–18 (a frequently recurring series from the baptismal liturgy), and 25–28, the sealingprayers. At prayer 35,24 the postulant again puts his hand to his head and keeps it thereuntil he has finished the sealing series. It is worth recalling that at the first recital of thisseries, at the crowning, the priests put their own hands on the novice’s head. But nowthat the novice possesses a crown of his own, he uses his own hand, having achievedanother level in the step-by-step work of becoming a priest.Having “sealed” himself, the postulant rises up, praises the First Life, throws incense,and utters number 65, a masiqta prayer. At this point in her translation of Coronation,Drower makes a confusing decision. She introduces a parenthetical “not,” with a ques-tion mark, into her translation, so that it reads, “(but) without the ‘of our fore-fathers’because these rahmia of the škinta are (not?) with zharas.”25 It makes sense to leave outDrower’s inserted “(not?)” in the text’s instruction, for the point is precisely that inclu-sion of zhara(s) precludes d-abahatan. The first part of this prayer reads, “Ye are set up"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Initiation of the Tarmida103and raised up into the Place where the good are established amongst manas26 of light,the souls called upon and raised up and signed by this masiqta and (the souls of) ourfathers, our teachers, our brothers and our sisters.”27 Leaving out d-abahatan, the reciterinstead emphasizes the ascent, which refers to the masiqta in the strict sense of the word,of his own soul. Just as his prayers and incense rise upward, so, too, shall his soul.A series of rahmas ensue, and the postulant ends this round with prayers 71 and 72,the second concurrence of these prayers so far. In prayer 71, he is exhorted to leave outd-abahatan. Why? In my interpretation this is a conscious parallel to the lacking oilsigns in the second part of the masiqta, the part for the six fatiras, as noted in chap-ter 8. Recall that in the initiation’s first concurrence of prayers 71 and 72, the phrasewas included, but not now. In parallel, the masiqta of the sixty fatiras had oil signs atspecific points in prayers 49–54, but not in the masiqta for the six. Lest this sort ofcorrelation seems utterly far-fetched, I must emphasize that the esoteric commentary textsthemselves support such an interpretation.For the moment, it is important to keep in mind the open-ended acts, the lack of oilsigns in the masiqta for the six fatiras, a lack that now, at prayer 65, correlates with theomission of the phrase d-abahatan in the present ritual of priest initiation. Still, prayer 65is a masiqta prayer, and the priest initiation implies a sort of death, a movement fromearth to Lightworld. As in the masiqta, one might expect the open ends in the priest ini-tiation to be tied up. Indeed, the immediately ensuing prayer 72 marks a certain closure,for here d- abahatan is included, and the prayer is uttered with bent knees, a gesture thatstresses the ancestors and the Lightworld rather than the praying individual.As in the first instance of prayers 71 and 72, these prayers are now, in their secondround, followed by a pihta and mambuha meal. Rising to his feet, the novice utters theappropriate prayers for the water and bread, numbers 36–45, eats and drinks, and concludeswith numbers 59 and 60, prayers for the food. Now the sequence follows roughly the samepattern as after the baptism of the novice, with the mqaimitun formula sixty-one times, andprayer 80, in which the novice calls upon a number of Lightworld beings. Kušta with therba follows, and the novice keeps his hand on his head during the rahmas afterward.At this point the other priests leave the hut; only the rba and his charge remain.They will stay there for seven days in all, without sleep. Outside, the laypeople keep uptheir joyful noise to help the men stay awake. Each day the novice obtains a new dress,prays the rahmas at the three designated prayer times (the seven days of the week re-quire different sets of rahmas), and receives pihta and mambuha.28 While he is stillpraying the rahmas for the last of the seven days—the novice is now probably in anexhausted state—other priests accompanied by laymen enter the hut. The laymen attendedthe beginnings of the ceremonies in the škinta, and now they witness the end of theškinta period. The novice prays the loosening prayers, the širiatas 2, 4, and 6,29 whichseparate the priestly insignia from their ritual uses. Laying aside his crown and wreathuntil the next day, the novice has finished another level in the creation of his new self.Baptism of Rba and Zidqa BrikhaIt is Sunday morning. Priests are praying the rahmas outside the hut, and the novice ispreparing to baptize his rba. Coronation says that this baptism must be without zharas"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"104Ritualsin prayers 35, 18, 168, and 169, “because the baptism ‘of the sixty’ is that of the pos-tulant, but the baptism of the rba is d-abahata.”30 Moreover, Coronation continues toassociate the baptism and the fatiras of the masiqta, for the foodstuffs (ginzas: “trea-sures”) in both sections of the masiqta symbolize spirit and soul, elements that cannotbe separated from one another.Coronation’s cryptic and esoteric statements may need explication. To begin, the textlinks maƒbuta with masiqta, for both are rituals that connect the believers with theLightworld. As noted, flowing water (yardna) is how the Lightworld manifests itself onearth, and therefore baptism marks a temporary immersion into that world. This con-stitutes a correlate to the final, eternal immersion in it when a dead person’s spirit andsoul are conveyed upward by a masiqta. One could call a baptism a repeatedly performedforerunner of the masiqta. The two rituals express the same goal, and the verb SQL(raise up) is used for both.Second, Coronation virtually identifies the masiqta for the sixty fatiras with the al-ready performed baptism of the novice (as seen earlier in this chapter). The number offatiras, sixty, causes Coronation to interpret this fact as a clue to the baptism of the nov-ice. In addition, to these two correlates is supplied a third, the spirit, so that all threeitems belong in one category, according to the esoteric exegetical system of Coronation.These three are the sixty fatiras, the baptism of the novice, and the spirit. All are corre-lated to their higher parallels, which signify a more elevated level of creative work: themasiqta of the Parents. As described in the previous chapter, in that ritual, six fatirasare all signed with oil, and Coronation now associates these six with the baptism of therba and with the soul.31The reason for Coronation’s mystifying aside (apart from sheer delight in esotericcorrelations) appears to be a pressing need to explain why the impending baptism ofthe rba must not contain zharas—while the baptism of the novice did contain them. Myinterpretation is this: the rba functions as a personification of the ancestors, the par-ents, and therefore the baptism does not, strictly speaking, concern the rba personallybut emphasizes the Lightworld parents. A zhara, then, will be substituted by the for-mula d-abahatan.After the baptism, a “blessed oblation” (zidqa brikha) meal follows, and, in contrastto the baptism just performed, this is eaten in the name of the rba, who does not takepart in the meal. The food furthers the laufa, the life force between the earth and theLightworld, and among beings in both realms. The ƒa, a rolled-up piece of flat breadcontaining nuts and raisins (an obviously phallic emblem), takes central stage in thezidqa brikha.32 Eating the ƒa in the name of the rba and asking forgiveness of sins forhim, the other priests and the postulant invoke the power of Yawar Ziwa and SimatHiia, the prototypical Lightworld couple.A šganda appears and recites prayer 348, a prayer that mentions primordial šgandas.To this the ganzibra responds with prayer 349, “Come, come, lofty messenger. . . .”33and takes a bottle of hamra and a sprig of myrtle out of the šganda’s hand. One noteshere that the acolyte plays the role of a Lightworld emissary, bearing life-giving symbolsof that upper world. The zidqa brikha ends with the sealing prayers and the priests’blessing of the novice by placing their hands on his head.The next day, Monday, the novice must include d-abahatan in prayers 58, 65, and71,34 because these prayers belong to the škinta and to the sixty fatiras, while the rahmas"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Initiation of the Tarmida105of the sixy days connect with the parents.35 This does not contradict what was saidpreviously, for the mention of the sixty days point forward to the sixty-day seclusionperiod now imminent for the novice. Here it is important to avoid making a connectionbetween the number sixty concerning the fatiras and the sixty days, for Coronation wishes,instead, to emphasize an opposition. To clarify: the present rahmas, those of the škinta,are of a preliminary nature when compared with those of the sixty-day period, for inthose sixty days, the rahmas take on the nature “of the Parents.” Prayed during the sevendays in the škinta, the first set of rahmas can be compared to a temporary wall or scaf-folding, not the final construction. Only the rahmas prayed during the upcoming sixtydays will complete the edifice.Again, let me sum up: the rahmas of the sixty fatiras correspond to the baptism ofthe sixty, the baptism of the postulant. Zharas are omitted in the prayers for these tworituals. In contrast, the baptism of the rba is a ritual focusing on the ancestors, a focuscharacterized by the rahmas of the sixty days, too. One might say that the baptism of therba eases the transition into the sixty days, for the attention will now increasingly dwellon the Parents.The Sixty Days: Masiqta for the RbaReturning to his own home, the novice stays secluded from his wife and his family forsixty days. He cooks his own food, keeps strict purity, prays a total of 180 rahmas, andexchanges kušta with a šganda who arrives every day for that very purpose. Impersonatinga Lightworld being, the šganda is the only person allowed to come into contact with thenovice during these days. Coronation, reveling in esoteric computations, explains the 180prayers during the sixty days as three evenly distributed sets of 60 each for soul, spirit, andbody.36 Essentially, the task of the novice during these days is to pray his own new selfinto being. According to Coronation’s previous statement, these rahmas would included-abahatan, and not the zhara, despite the focus on self-creation. However, that self can-not be constructed without the strength and evoked presence of the ancestors.The first seclusion period, the seven škinta days, culminated in the novice baptizinghis rba. Now, after sixty days’ isolation, the new priest emerges and performs a masiqtafor his rba. The most striking feature is that this masiqta is read for someone still alive.In the part of this masiqta treating the six fatiras, the novice includes both the zhara forhis rba and the clause d-abahatan. No one is excluded. Toward the end, the prayers inthis masiqta follow partly the pattern of the two segments of the regular masiqta of thesixty plus six fatiras, the Mother masiqta. But the sequence also follows part of theTabahata masiqta. For this reason, one might see the masiqta for the rba as compress-ing and combining the goals of the two masiqtas.After kušta with the šganda, the postulant puts his hand to his head and recitesprayers 3, 35, 58, 99, and 71 in his own, not the rba’s, name. But at prayer 72, whichfollows 71, he bends his knees and inserts d-abahatan. In this third, and last, occur-rence of prayers 71 and 72, d-abahatan is present in both prayers, securing and sealingall who are implied in that clause.Having arrived at the end of his initiation, the novice drinks mambuha and eatspihta, closing the circle begun by the priests eating and drinking at the very start of the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"106Ritualsnovice’s initiation.37 He deconsecrates himself, gives the šganda the handshake, andleaves the škinta where he performed the masiqta. Separated from the other priests, thenovice eats the zidqa brikha in the name of his teacher, while the other priests consumethe meal in his, the new priest’s, name. Reading the very long blessings, prayers 374–79, the new priest is allowed to use the book. He removes his taga, an act accompaniedby the requisite prayer 178. His final act is to baptize his rba, and only then is he “au-thorized to (celebrate) all rites.”38 The sixty-eight days have come to an end.Concluding RemarksMoving and being moved through the clusters of rituals and ritual segments, the novicehas become a new priest, qualified to serve his community. He travels from the publiclayman space to the Lightworld environment, from the “female” earthly realm to theupper, “male” one. The varying emphases on him, on his rba, and on the ancestralParents demonstrate a construction and reinforcement of harmonious interdependencies.On the “female” side belongs earth, laypeople, the left, silver, myrtle, and the andiruna;on the “male,” Lightworld, priests, the right, gold, crown, and škinta. The rba seems tobe the most “movable” actor in the proceedings, for he alternately is himself, imperson-ates the ancestors, and exhibits the envisioned status of the novice. In the masiqta readfor him, he in a sense “plays dead.” but he also acts as the father making possible thenovice’s rebirth.The šganda plays the role as Lightworld emissary, despite his status as acolyte; he isnot a priest. But in his Lightworld aspect, he paradoxically inhabits a level higher thanthe novice. The laymen who come into the škinta at the beginning and the end of thenovice’s week in the hut function as representatives of the “female” world that the noviceis leaving. And yet, as long as he remains on earth, the new priest of course partakes inthat world, while still occupying a role as \u0001utra impersonator.The inclusions and exclusions of zharas or the phrase d-abahatan, the instructionsregarding bent knees, kisses, whose hand(s) on whose head, kuštas with whom, meals,specific prayer series, the symbolism of numbers, and so on, all segments possess theirown logic. In some prayers, both zharas and d-abahatan may be present. But regardingothers, admonitions grow adamant against including one or the other. Rahmas, inparticular, are regarded as construction prayers, for the verbs used for them convey themeanings “construct,” “build,” and “establish,”39 rather than “speak” or “recite.” Rahmasbuild a mental universe. Obviously, it would be detrimental to build with unsuitablephrases, with wrong materials and tools.Gradually, the initiation constructs a new priest through a ritual that reinforces themythological universe already envisioned. The thrice-recurring conjunction of prayers71 and 72 has a special significance, comparable to the oil-signs (and lack of such) ofthe fatiras at prayers 49–54 in a masiqta. The first time prayers 71 and 72 occur in thetarmida ritual is after the novice’s baptism, before he enters the škinta. D-abahatan occursin both prayers. This I take as a parallel to the sealings of the fatiras in the masiqtaprayers (where only the last one of the treated sixty biscuits remains unsealed). As thenovice is about to leave the škinta for the sixty days of isolation, prayers 71 and 72appear again, but now with the exhortation to leave out d-abahatan in prayer 71. This"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Initiation of the Tarmida107corresponds to the lack of seals in the first treatment of the six fatiras. But in the thirdconcurrence of prayers 71 and 72, at the end of his initiation, d-abahatan occurs inboth prayers. This correlates with the act of securing and sealing all fatiras in the an-nual Tabahata masiqta. Recall also that toward the end of the priest initiation, the novice’sprayer sequence intermingles the Tabahata masiqta prayer sequence and that of the firsttreatment of the six fatiras.Little breads (fatiras) symbolize ancestors in the masiqta, and the tarmida initiationcorrelates the phrase d-abahatan with these. “Tabahata,” in the sense of “the masiqta ofthe Parents,” should be kept separate from the phrase d-abahatan (of our Parents), thoughboth certainly point to the same entity. Calling the baptism of the rba “d-abahatan,”Coronation juxtaposes this ritual to the baptism of the novice, which is called “of thesixty,” and which includes zharas. For the novice’s baptism belongs to “the Mother,”the “female” realm—like “the masiqta of the Mother,” the two first parts of the masiqta.40But the rba belongs to the Parents, and his baptism is linked with the Lightworld andwith the Tabahata masiqta. His baptism by the new priest falls quite outside of thispattern, for this act can be seen as a first “test case” for the new priest. It thereforesymbolically moves the rba, who earlier played “ritually dead” in the masiqta performedfor him, back to earth, so to speak.For this treatment of the tarmida initiation, I have not used Exalted Kingship, an-other text that deals with this ritual. This text pays much more detailed attention tosections of the tarmida initiation than does Coronation. The latter looks like a list, offer-ing a virtual “telephone book” format with respect to the proceedings, whereas ExaltedKingship considerably expands on the treatment of certain parts of the initiation. Ex-alted Kingship soars in seemingly extravagant loops of esoteric exegeses. Later, in chap-ter 12, I will give a sample of this text’s dizzying interpretive style by showing how itunderstands the effects of the novice’s recital of the liturgy when he sits in the škinta,watched by the priests. In the figure I offer in parallel columns the sequence of prayersfor the tarmida initiation, according to Coronation and to Exalted Kingship.Prayer sequence in the tarmida initiation.CoronationExalted Kingship323413231–103 (novice’s recital in škinta)1–103324–27 (coronation prayers)324–273, 5, 193, 5, 1979, 814279, 80, 81preparation for baptizing novice1, 3, 5, 191, 3, 5, 1932328, 34 (incense prayers)8, 3475–774375–7735 (with zharas)35baptism of novice begins10–1318414"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"108Rituals19first kušta8220–24second kušta36–45 (pihta and mambuha)third kušta25–28 (sealing prayers)29, 30, 83–86, 88, 9071–72 (first concurrence)fourth kušta4418, 109 (rahmas)58 (with zhara)586565168–69168–6971–7271–72 (second concurrence)36–45 (pihta and mambuha)59–6059–6031, 831, 87272171mqaimitun (sixty-one times)mqaimitun8080kušta with šgandafifth kušta63 (masiqta oil)631781781, 3, 9, 15344–45233–56 (kd azil)233–56330–47 (drabša prayers)novice crowned1, 3, 5, 191, 3, 5, 1935, 935, 915–1715–1725–28 (hatamtas)25–28hamra ceremony180–99180–9945305–21 (antiphons)305–21škinta period begins72, 31, 8, 94, 63, kd azil46106–8106–81, 3, 5, 191, 3, 5, 198, 348165–69113 (a Sunday prayer)113114–17114–1677, 9, 3577, 9, 3515–1715–1725–2825–2858, 6558, 65"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Initiation of the Tarmida109119–22165–6916571–7271–72 (third concurrence)36–4536–4559–6059–6072721718080kuštakušta"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"PART IIINATIVE HERMENEUTICS"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"10The Ducks That Came to the MarshesNew York113Voices of the PresentThe jewelry store on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan looks like many others, shiningwith bright lights and glass, and gleaming merchandise displayed everywhere. TwoMandaeans work here. One of them, a younger man named Saeed Moradi, greets mewarmly after I am buzzed inside (this is in 1995). He says he thinks he remembers mefrom 1973, when I visited his father’s jewelry store in Iran. The other Mandaean isNasser Sobbi, a seventy-year-old man with a thin white mustache in a broad face undershort, sparse, white hair. He is square and compact of body, which he moves with sur-prising speed as we leave the store and set off toward the subway that will take us toFlushing. Mr. Sobbi hails from Khorramshahr, where he still owns property. He hasbeen in the United States since 1970, and he is one of the few Mandaeans on thiscontinent who speaks, reads, and writes Mandaic. Lamea in San Diego had put me incontact with him.On July 16, 1989, Mr. Sobbi finished copying an entire Ginza at his home in Flush-ing. At the end of the work he has written a message in Farsi, Arabic, and English. Hetells who the owner of the original is, says for whom it was copied, gives his own maƒbutaname, and thanks the owner “for giving me the opportunity to rewrite, by lending methe holy book - sidra and pray for all Sobis (Mandaei) the good health, prosperity andhave patience when facing difficulties.

Mr. Sobbi’s wife, Shukrieh, tall, black-haired and striking, witha drabša around her neck, tells me that when the copying work was going on, for fourmonths, the apartment had to be quiet. I wonder about the enormous gray parrot, squawk-ing and fixing me, one eye at a time, a bird approachable only by the family’s son, Issa,who alone is exempt from his bites. Was the parrot quiet, too, during those four months?I see Mr. Sobbi’s books and scrolls, stashed away in drawers and cupboards in theliving room. He has Lady Drower’s works, too.

It is news to Mr. Sobbi that Macuch died in the summer of 1993. The twonever met, but when Mr. Sobbi was a boy, he did see Lady Drower once when shecame to Iran.One evening Mr. Sobbi and I sit side by side in the sofa, each with our Book of John,he with his Mandaic one, I with my tattered copy of Lidzbarski’s translation. After somesearching, we correlate our texts to the tractate I have asked him to read aloud on tape.The text is “Hibil’s Lament.” I want to hear how the Mandaic sounds. Across from us,alert and perched on another sofa and on chairs, sit the others. They are all Mandaeans:Mrs. Sobbi and one or two of her daughters; Mamoon Aldulaimi, a fiftyish engineeroriginally from Baghdad; his wife, Shafia, pretty and delicate; and Shafia’s mother, BibiUm Aduan, who arrived from Iraq only ten days ago, a black-clad woman with a broad,wise face and a large gold pendant bearing the image of her deceased husband.“Ready?” I ask.“OK,” says Mr. Sobbi.He reads. We all listen. Throughout the reading, Mr. Sobbi hesitates only at a fewwords that he does not understand. I follow the Mandaic text, nodding, humming, andclucking a few sounds of sympathy to the sections where Hibil Ziwa complains bitterlyabout his tasks.1 I am so entranced that I forget to look at the others across the table.How did they react? Later, I ask Mamoon, who says that they were happy to listen butwished that they could understand the language. At the end, there is applause forMr. Sobbi, and soon my tape is awash in a mayhem of intermingled voices: Mandaic,Arabic, English. When the doorbell rings, I turn the tape off. But Mr. Sobbi ponderswhat he has just read. “It is very deep,” he remarks. “I want to read it again, study it.”He does not recall having read this story earlier.On my previous visit, in October 1994, Mr. Sobbi and his wife engaged in a smallconversation in Mandaic for my benefit. Many Iranian Mandaeans, especially of theolder generation, speak Mandaic, while the Iraqi ones, in general, do not. Now he talksto his wife about getting his flu shot at the hospital recently. With us are Mamoon andone of his friends, another Mandaean engineer, Zuhair Jenab. I strain my ear and rec-ognize only three or four words of the conversation in Mandaic. I look at the engineers.“Did you understand?” “Not a word,” says Mamoon emphatically, “not a single word!”I am surprised.I first met Mamoon and Zuhair when they joined Mr. Sobbi and me for dinner inan Afghan restaurant in Flushing. On the way there, we stop to play the lottery. Mr. Sobbiplays every day, and he initiates me, a complete novice, into the mysteries of filling outthe form. (Do I still have an unchecked ticket?) The two of us head down the streetenveloped in international aromas and populations: Korean groceries, Indian sari shops,vendors with tablefuls of crystals and incense. We repeat this trip four months later,but this time we dip into a liquor store for a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label.Mr. Sobbi tries to fit this into his inner jacket pocket but the bottle is too large. “Letme,” I suggest, opening my purse. I manage to force the bottle down into it. The Ko-rean girls behind the counter laugh and say, innuendo heavy in their singing voices,“Have a good evening!” Out on the street, Mr. Sobbi mutters, “Let them think whatthey want.”"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Ducks That Came to the Marshes: New York115Mr. Nasser Sobbi.

Gradually, a whole table fills with Mandaeans.Mamoon, smiling, passes around copies of the first issue of his newsletter, Almandi,which he has produced in his basement office at home on Long Island. His parentsarrive, as well as his wife and mother-in-law plus two couples. Food appears. Bibi eatsonly a little yogurt and some vegetables. Shafia explains to me, “She is very religious.She cannot eat restaurant meat.” I understand; in fact, I think that she is brave to eat ina restaurant at all.Even before we eat, the conversation turns to religion, especially to the questions oforigins and identity. Afifa, a vivacious redhead, and Fawzia, Mamoon’s stepmother—awoman with an intense, alert expression and a square face framed in dark hair—arelistening to Mr. Sobbi expound on one of his favorite topics, John the Baptist. Fawziafollows him step by logical step and concludes, “OK. If John’s mother was Jewish, andJohn’s father was Jewish, doesn’t that make John Jewish and not Mandaean?” Mr. Sobbi,however, waves this aside. But Fawziah has not forgotten, for she brings it up againwith Afifa and me a few days later.In the restaurant, I have a conversation with the two women about the eternal prob-lems of how to deal with the “Jewish origins” question and with the Mandaean mythol-ogy and traditions versus the scholars’ views and modern, scientific notions. “What istrue? What are we to do, to think?” asks Fawzia, widening her immense eyes and throw-ing up her hands. For Afifa, too, these are difficult subjects. I decide to use an approachI sometimes try with students. Divide your brain into two compartments, I suggest, onedealing with the scientific views, the other with the religious traditions, the stories. Donot worry about the truth being only of one kind. Respect the traditions, the stories,because they are yours; they are true for you. Accept the rationalistic explanations, too,but realize that these have no monopoly on truth; they are another kind of “stories.”One can operate with different areas of truth, I conclude. The women listen to this,attentively, and appear content that there may be some way to deal with these intrac-table questions.Mr. Sobbi wants to leave. The Johnnie Walker is all gone, distributed into glassesof water for the men (and for me). We all repair to Mr. Sobbi’s apartment, where weare served fruit, liquor, coffee, and tea. A beautiful color photo, taken in 1992, hangson the wall. Three Iranian Mandaean priests, father and two sons, stand side by side inritual action, praying and handling their white tagas. They are Sheikh Jabbar Tawoosie,the ganzibra, and Sheikh Najah and Sheikh Salah, both tarmidas. The youngest son isin the middle. All three are stunningly handsome, of unquestioned dignity, and seemutterly unperturbed by the photographic moment.2Pretty soon, the voices of two (I think) of these priests boom on the sound system,a tape made by Mr. Sobbi’s brother, who took the photo, too, and whom I will meetlater. I try to find out where the reciters are in their prayers, but I cannot. Mr. Sobbileaves through his book of prayers, the \u0001nianas, also without luck. After a while, theprayers stop. I take out my Book of John and show Mr. Sobbi the Mandaic writing inthe back, Lidzbarski’s own calligraphy. This is not typeset Mandaic. “Wow!” saysMr. Sobbi. “I should become as good as he is!” As we handle this and other bookswhile we talk, I sense Bibi contemplating us. I know she must wonder, particularlyabout my handling these holy books as though they were ordinary ones. Still, her ex-pression is warm, accepting."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Ducks That Came to the Marshes: New York117Suddenly, while we are all talking at once, in three languages, the sound system eruptswithout warning, and Mandaic prayers fill the room. How did the tape suddenly comeback on? All laugh and wonder aloud, but I point silently to the ceiling and look atBibi. The voice of the Lightworld! She laughs happily, understanding my gesture.The Elders“That wasn’t a very kosher lunch you had,” I gently reprimand Mamoon one day as weexit a restaurant. He has eaten clam chowder. “I know. My mother-in-law says, ‘Howcan you?’ when she sees me eating shellfish,” Mamoon admits. He has taken goodcare of her, however, for he went to a neighborhood farm on Long Island to get achicken, and he cut its throat with the ritual iron knife, the one I have seen in hisbasement. I shake Mamoon’s hand when he tells me about the correct slaughter. “Welldone! Congratulations!”Respect for the elders shows in many ways. I sense that Mamoon considers Mr. Sobbialmost to be a spiritual father. On my first evening in Mr. Sobbi’s apartment, I noticethat the two engineers, Mamoon and Zuhair, called the older man by a name I did notrecognize. I decide to ask Mr. Sobbi about this later on. Right now, however, he insistson riding with me all the way on the Long Island Railroad back to Penn Station inManhattan and walking with me from there to the entrance of General TheologicalSeminary, where I am staying with friends. As we argue about the necessity of thischaperoning, both of us stubborn, I find myself naturally imitating his gestures ofhunched-up shoulders, elbows to the side, hands flitting in the air, raised brows. Westand flapping at each other, and of course Mr. Sobbi wins.On the train, I bring up my question about his “other” name. “Yes,” he explains,”itis a form of honorary address; that is how you speak to an older person. I am Abu Issa,Father of Issa, because Issa is my son. If I had more than one son, men younger thanme would address me by using the name of my oldest son. This form of address holdsfor women, too, so that Lamea in San Diego, for example, might be called Mother ofZaki, as he is her oldest son.”Another elder I meet among the New York Mandaeans is Mr. Sobbi’s brother, DakhilShooshtary. He is ten years his brother’s junior, also a goldsmith, but an entirely differ-ent type physically: tall, with a powerful brow over deep-set eyes and a prominent mouthin a square face. A stunning photo hangs over the sofa in his living room. It showsMr. Shooshtary and his wife, Noona, who now sits next to him on the sofa. A distanceof about four feet separates the image above, taken thirty-seven years earlier, and thecouple beneath. Noona is a striking beauty, and her husband sports a mass of blackhair. My gaze travels up and down. As in the photo, he sits at her left.I have already noticed Mr. Shooshtary’s belt loop. A double-sided drabša, made ofwhite gold and diamonds, hangs from it. Mr. Shooshtary made the drabša himself. Heslips the piece off, and I turn the drabša carefully in my hands. I have never seen any-thing like it.Soon we descend—Mamoon, Mr. Shooshtary, and I—to his office in the basement.A real Mandaean workplace!

The two have different last names, I am told later, in order to confound themilitary. A drabša the size of a table flag stands on the desk. It is knitted, made of pure,white wool. Behind the desk are shelves of books and papers.On the wall hangs a picture that I recognize as a larger print of one in Mr. Sobbi’sapartment, an old, brown-and-white photo taken in Iran in the early 1930s. OnlyMandaean men—and one boy, Mr. Shooshtary himself! All are in local garb, unrecog-nizable as Mandaeans; and that is the point. The Mandaeans were forced to look “ge-neric,” for Khuzistan had just been ceded to Iran from Iraq, and the authorities de-manded that the Mandaeans dress like everyone else. This is the proof. The leader wearsa large cap; there are no priests in the photo. Mr. Shooshtary can name every man init. The impressively dignified men gaze directly, even defiantly, at the photographer, asif to say: no matter the garb, our identity is still our own.There are two sticks in the corner by the desk. They are margnas (priestly staffs), cutoff from olive trees in Arizona and sent by Mamoon’s brother via mail. These stickscaused a certain stir in the post office, with the mailman who delivered them askingMr. Shooshtary, “Excuse me, what exactly are these?” “As you can see, sticks.”Mr. Shooshtary carefully lays out a white cotton garment on his desk. It is the rastathat was made in Iran, the one I saw on Majid’s video in San Diego. The very samerasta! In the video, the men sat along the walls in a room and watched raptly as thepriest cut the fabric with scissors and explained each step in the proceedings. It wasMr. Shooshtary’s video, for he took a trip back home and there obtained the rasta,which he took halfway around the world back to New York. I admire the fabric, verysoft and delicate to the touch. Mr. Shooshtary speaks about the rasta’s features: thestitched-on pocket (daša), where the “passport” will be put, and the places near the clavicle,where the gold will be fastened to the right, the silver to the left, when the shirt is usedfor a dead person. He points out the naƒifa (stole), which is separate from the shirt.Flipping the shirt at the shoulders, he shows me that it is correct, without seams. Hefolds the garment and reverently puts it away.3I receive many gifts in Mr. Shooshtary’s office: a Mandaean calendar that he hasmade; a copy of a primer in modern Mandaic, made by Sheikh Salem Choheili;4 aphotocopy of a sheet showing a Mandaean magical bowl, with its customary, outwardlyspiraling script. I tell Mr. Shooshtary and Mamoon about a particular letter that I have,one that the young scholar Cyrus H. Gordon, who was studying such bowls, sent toLady Drower in 1938. Professor Gordon typed on one side of the paper, then turned itaround and continued upside down on the back. Having realized what he just did, headded, in black ink, “I notice that I inverted the page in starting this page. Perhaps thecause is to be found in the bowls that I have been turning around and around of late.”Mamoon and I return to Mr. Shooshtary a series of color photographs, which hetook in Iran of Mandaean ceremonies in 1992. Mr. Shooshtary himself, ready for bap-tism, appears in at least one of the pictures. Mamoon and I have already made colorphotocopies, of surprisingly good quality, on sheets of paper. We enlarge one photo ofthe three priests at prayer, tagas in hand, and we also make a copy of the picture hang-ing in Mr. Sobbi’s living room in Flushing.No one has said anything, but I have a strong sense that the rasta and the margnas arethere to be used. Maybe a priest will come to New York, someday. People do die, and,according to their traditions, Mandaeans need a priest to perform the rituals for the dead."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Ducks That Came to the Marshes: New York119The LaufaDeath is a difficult issue. I have asked Mamoon, carefully, whether it is possible for meto see a Mandaean grave. So far, four Mandaeans have passed away in New York andhave been buried in local, non-Mandaean cemeteries. Mamoon calls his cousin Kareem,whose father died ten years ago in an accident. Now the three of us drive in some hurryto the cemetery, hoping that it will not close early this afternoon. Kareem—fortyish, se-rious, and of a mystical bent (he tells me of visions and dreams)—drives, with me in thepassenger seat, and Mamoon in the back with a large bouquet of flowers and a bottle ofwater. We speed along, and our fears have been justified, for the cemetery is about toclose. But we drive inside, Kareem calling urgently to an official, “I have to! I have guestsfrom overseas!”Flat grave markers lie on the ground (to facilitate lawn mowers, I suspect). We standat the grave, and Mamoon informs me about the burial, “It is done correctly, facingnorth.” I nod. Kareem flips up the metal vase, fills it with the carried water, and putsthe flowers in it. With the rest of the water he washes the marker and kisses it. I readaloud the dead man’s name and the years of his life, “Jalal Jawdat 1928–1985,” em-bossed on the marker. I am overwhelmed by the feeling that any Mandaean who dieshere perilously diminishes the group’s number, that the deaths point mercilessly to whatthe Mandaeans fear: that they will not be able to continue as a religion, that they willdie out—plants cut down, on a foreign soil.I thank Kareem for letting me come here. Mamoon sniffles behind me, I am on theverge of tears myself, while Kareem sighs deeply and weeps very quietly. Mamoon andI embrace Kareem without words. We step into the car and drive away; only after a longsilence does Kareem ask me why I wanted to see the grave. “Did you want to writeabout it?” “No,” I say,” I only wanted to see the grave of a Mandaean buried here inthis country.” But now I have written about it, too.5Three weeks earlier, a Mandaean died in Iraq. New York Mandaeans will have aceremony (fateha)6 in Flushing, a gathering of many Mandaeans, to sit together, to eat,to pay their respects to the mourning family. A couple of the sons live here, with theirfamilies. Do I want to come? Of course.We dress up, those of us who are women in black. Fine jewelry flashes on theMandaeans. In the car, on our way from Long Island to Flushing, Mamoon tells methe story of the ducks that came to the marshes of Iraq earlier in this century. Bands onthe ducks’ feet showed that they came from America. The ducks stayed; they did not flyon but became residents. Hunters trapped them and sold them to the Mandaeans forfood. Even now, Mamoon tells me, these ducks are eaten only by Mandaeans. It is astrangely poignant story, I feel, almost prophetic, for by traveling to America the peopleclosed the circle that the ducks began.The first Mandaeans came to the World Exposition in New York in 1939, to showtheir silver and gold art. There were five, Lamea’s father among them. They stayed,some for a long time, and the war intervened, too. Mamoon has a photo of these fivemen standing by a river in Queens, which they found suitable for their ritual ablutions.Now, stories told, we enter a street lined by two-story apartments. Shafia and Mamoonare a bit distressed when they realize that the men and the women are separated—thereason given is lack of space. But this is, in fact, the old-time, traditional arrangement."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"120Native HermeneuticsTogether, we decide that I will go with Shafia and Bibi, briefly, to meet the women,who are in an apartment diagonally across from where the men sit. Afterward, I willbecome a kind of “honorary man” and be with the men. This sometimes becomes myrole as a scholar, a position between the male and the female spheres.We go upstairs. Food activities rule in the kitchen, and in the living room abouttwelve or fifteen women line the walls. I know only Fawziah and Afifa from before. Ishake hands with everyone. One of the mourners is a desolate-looking young womanwith dazed eyes and a limp handshake. Some of the women look hardy and robust;others seem decidedly urban and could fit into any cosmopolitan setting. I sit for awhile, contemplating the womens’ faces. Bibi is greeted with special warmth, the mostrecent breath from “the old country.”Shafia takes me across the street to the men in a similar apartment, with food prepa-rations made by men and women in the kitchen. About forty men sit along the walls,and I shake hands all around. Ghazi is there, and I meet Majid’s brother Raad, largerthan his sibling in San Diego. I sit by the window, between Mamoon and his father. Ayoung man comes around with coffee, and I take a small amount in the bottom of thetiny cup. Cigarettes lie fanned out from open packages on napkins. Six or seven menare working their strings of beads. Subdued, mumbling conversations, greetings, hand-shakes and embraces. A couple of little boys run to and fro throughout the afternoon,orbiting to their affectionate fathers.Discreetly, I watch the men, who are of all types. The day before, Afifa has askedme, “How come we Mandaeans have so many different looks? Some of us are light,others darker, I’m a redhead”—here she lifts her hand to her hair—“some are shorter,some taller. And some have blue eyes, too!” She turned to Mr. Aldulaimi, who hasblue eyes. I said, “I don’t know, but an old theory held that the blue eyes hinted at aCaspian Sea influence.” Around 1930 the American anthropologist Henry Field andhis researchers measured Mandaeans’ heads in Iraq, finding nothing conclusive to sup-port that era’s theories of physical anthropology.Now, at the fateha, I watch. On and off, Mamoon and his father converse quietlywith me. We sit. Aldulaimi senior says that there probably will not be a lofani, thespecial meal for the dead man, because no one is clean enough, there is no priest present.But I have heard that there will be such a meal, and indeed, soon enough, Mr. Sobbiascends the stairs in his dark suit and strides purposefully, most likely in the role ofritual official, into the kitchen. Things begin to be moved from the kitchen to the bed-room of one of the children. I sit conveniently positioned, observing these activities.Young men and one young woman hurry back and forth carrying food and white clothsinto the room in the back, it seems according to Mr. Sobbi’s directions. Something isabout to happen.Mr. Sobbi says to me, “We will do the lofani; do you want to see?” Yes. I enter theroom and sit down on the edge of the bed, with one of the young women perchedbehind me. Mr. Sobbi, holding one large and one very small piece of paper, sits at theother end of the bed. In the doorway stand a couple of young men and some children,riveted by the scene in front of them on the bedroom floor. A white sheet arranged toform a large, shallow pure area on the floor holds many items for the lofani: a bowl ofwater; a filleted, broiled fish; a lemon; an orange; an apple; a banana; an onion; shavedcoconut in a heap; scallions; pita breads. In front of this arrangement sits a small, slen-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Ducks That Came to the Marshes: New York121der man, with a white cloth napkin on his head. This is the most pure man in theassembly, baptized three times, with enough priests in his family to make him the bestsuited for the hallali (pure layman) task. He will be the conduit to the deceased man.Watched by all in the room, the man on the floor tears off a piece of pita bread andputs fragments of each kind of food on a piece of bread first, and then in his mouth,one kind of food at a time. This is not as easy at is sounds, for the man uses only hishands, no knife. He tears open the lemon and the orange with his hands, and a pieceof onion is sent flying as he squeezes the translucent meat under the thin skin. NowMr. Sobbi looks at his large piece of paper, which has the requisite prayer in Mandaicon one side and Farsi on the other. He reads, pausing after each word, and the hallalirepeats each word separately. When the place for the zhara appears, Mr. Sobbi glancesat the small piece of paper that bears the dead man’s maƒbuta name. Next the hallalieats the pita with the food on it. He speaks no word except for the prayer. The prayerends. “Now he can eat what he wants,” says Mr. Sobbi, mostly to me, as a commen-tary. And Mr. Sobbi rises up and leaves the room. The attentive, mourning family inthe doorway immediately move to join the hallali at the sheet, and with an air of intenseconcentration they sit down and eat with him. I have no place here now, and quicklyfollow Mr. Sobbi out of the room. This is strictly family business.I take my former seat in the living room, where tables are set up end to end, by theyoung men. Trays of food materialize as if out of thin air: fish, olives, dates, parsley, pick-les, hot green peppers, scallions, huge mounds of saffroned rice with raisins and nuts,and a delicious, salty mango pickle. The food is arranged in such a way that no one needsto stretch to obtain anything. “Stand next to me,” instructs Mamoon, sotto voce. I havenever eaten like this. We stand shoulder to shoulder around the table eating, with verylittle talk, without knives or forks, fingers only. (The man across from me does give me aplastic utensil, probably because of my culture’s well-known clumsiness in matters of eat-ing.) We eat quite fast, with great intensity and concentration, for the dead man, for our-selves. It feels more like a communion than any meal I have ever consumed.Only Mr. Sobbi (with his bad knees) and a couple of other older men, after a while,take their paper plates and sit down on chairs. Toward the end of the meal, Mr. Sobbicomes by and decides to test my Mandaic. “What is that?” he points to the dates.“Sindirka.” He beams to his neighbor. “See?” Some of the men have apparently ex-pressed doubt whether I know the language. But I fail on the “bread” question posedby the man next to me.A more relaxed mood sets in as we sit down. The food-laden dining tables vanish asspeedily as they materialized. Men come around with coffee and tea. Platters of fruitappear on side tables. Some men smoke, and strings of beads dangle. There is a debateabout collecting money for needy Mandaeans in Iraq. I watch, understanding very little.After the discussion, Mr. Sobbi comes and sits down next to me and explains thehallali. “Many of the others are not baptized, not clean enough.” He looks around. “I’llask,” he says, for my benefit, and turns to a younger, brown-haired man next to him.“How many times have you been baptized?” “Three.” Mr. Sobbi does not ask anyoneelse. Things are not that bad, I think to myself.Then Mr. Sobbi tells me about his mysterious spiritual experiences and dreams. Inone dream, he posed some questions to Muhammed, who was sitting inside a 1954Buick in the desert. Muhammed shook his head at Mr. Sobbi’s questions. Widening"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"122Native Hermeneuticshis eyes, Mr. Sobbi assures me, “ I believe in all of them—Buddha, Jesus, Muhammed.”Earlier, in October, he told me how on his visit to India he was completely overwhelmedby the poverty, the life, and the pervasive religiousness in Bombay. “They are so reli-gious!” he marveled.Before we leave the fateha (which will go on for hours still), I shake hands with themen again. We descend to the street, and as we wait for the women in the gatheringdusk, Mr. Sobbi clarifies for me the issue of the lacking knife in the lofani. “Not good;it is used to cut meat, you know.” I had already guessed that a knife, an instrument ofdeath, would be out of place in a situation that emphasizes feeding and laufa. But I hadalso wondered whether the hallali was not to use his teeth, but to swallow the foodfragments whole. “No, no, he can chew,” says Mr. Sobbi.In the car, Bibi offers us refreshing cardamom seeds from her cloth wallet. We re-turn to Long Island, and Mamoon sighs, “Ya, Hibil Ziwa” as he turns off the ignitionin his driveway. We mutter assent.Politics of ReligionOn another day, Mamoon tells me how he called on Manda d-Hiia and Hibil Ziwa ina specific case. The \u0001utras stepped in to help in an otherwise impossible situation, en-abling Mamoon to maneuver his car on an ice-covered driveway. I am reminded of Issam,too, who told me how he invokes Hibil Ziwa when a task requires extra strength. OnceIssam was cutting wood with an American friend. Each heaved his axe, drew his breath,and with all his might brought the axe down on the wood. Issam called on Hibil Ziwato give him strength. Hearing this, the American friend, who was soon to go to Viet-nam to fight in the war, thought it might be a good idea to try the Mandaean spirit. Hebegan to call on Hibil Ziwa, too, but Issam put a stop to that, protesting that non-Mandaeans had no right to do this. I imagine these two men in the Swedish woods,Issam defending his religious boundary.It is a few years since I have been invited to Iraq by the Highest Spiritual Council ofMandaeans in Baghdad. The invitation still stands, but I keep postponing the trip. (Bythis time, early 1995, I have also been invited by Sheikh Salem Choheili in Ahwaz, tovisit the Mandaeans of Iran.) If I travel to Iraq, I will have to go to Jordan and thenoverland, unless air travel is reinstated to Baghdad. Will it be safe? It seems so, at leastas long as I stay in government-controlled areas. “Right now, it is not dangerous, butnot comfortable,” I am told. Mr. Aldulaimi was part of a delegation from the UnitedStates to Baghdad, one week before the Gulf War began, to try to prevent that war.We talk about these things as we sit down to dinner in Mr. Aldulaimi’s house. Weeat delicious fish, eggplant morga, vegetables, shrimps, the usual mound of yellow rice,scallions, watercress, and another, quite spicy leaf available in Chinese stores. As weare about to eat, Afifa turns to me, alarm in her voice and demeanor, “We don’t knowhow to pray! Teach us!” I am bewildered and do not feel like taking over in this particu-lar matter. Shafia rescues the situation by nodding towards her daughter Hind next toher. “She knows,” says Shafia to Afifa, who now seems satisfied because Hind pos-sesses this knowledge. Almost everyone is eating anyway, and no one waits for the prayer.However, the formula is not lost.7"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Ducks That Came to the Marshes: New York123After dinner, cognac appears, and dates from Baghdad, plus an impressive, artisti-cally arranged pyramid of fruit. I am assuming that Ghazi will address me, for he calledMamoon in advance to tell him that he disagrees with something I wrote in ExaltedKingship. I have brought the book to confront the trouble head-on. But we settle it,Ghazi and I, for it turns out to have been a result of a misunderstanding of terms.Ghazi is a retired accountant for Scandinavian Airlines Systems. Offhandedly, he says,“I read in the paper today that the library in Kristiansand (my hometown in Norway)had to close.” “Oh, how come?” I reply, playing along. “A book was stolen.” At this, Igesture to Exalted Kingship resting on the back of the couch. “Probably a red one, eh?”Ghazi laughs appreciatively.He turns his beads in his hands. Each bead carries one of Allah’s names. Ghazistarts to read them out loud, one after another, translating some of them for my benefit.“Oh wow, beautiful,” says Afifa, his wife. We all listen to the names. Pretty soon,Mr. Aldulaimi gets up to bring Qur’ans. One is large, encased in a red carton. Thebook is a work of art, with stunning blue pages and golden script. “A special gift,” re-marks the owner, “not to be bought in stores.” The book is handed around reverently,much admired.We are on to holy books now. Discussion turns to last night’s debate in whichMr. Sobbi insisted that there is a reference to the Mandaeans in the Bible, in 2 Samuel14:47. Among his other enemies, king Saul fights “the kings of Zobah.” Mr. Sobbithinks this is “Subbi.”8 Mr. Aldulaimi gets up again, this time to fetch Arabic Bibles.They scour the taurah (Torah), and Ghazi reads a part from the Book of Esther. Welose track of the kings of Zobah.This is getting positively interreligious, I think, and I catch myself before I make atasteless joke about how the Mandaeans are now above any reproach, engrossed, justminutes ago, in the Qur\u0002an. But Ghazi has evidently pondered along similar lines, forhe remarks, “Well, we were Muslims, reading the Qur’an. Now we’re Jewish, readingthe Bible!”He asks me a question that is on the minds of many Mandaeans: How are theygoing to deal with current and prospective spouses who are not Mandaeans but whowish to convert? Mandaeans prohibit conversion. I suggest that the priests may at somepoint have to change the regulations, to make new rules. This is greeted with doubt andhead shaking. But Mamoon agrees with me and imagines that the priests will say somewords to purify the non-Mandaean spouses in order to let them into the religion. Hemakes up a word based on the Arabic nadhif, “pure” for “to purify.” I recognize thisword, which I learned in San Diego. Mamoon says “to nadhifize,” which meets withgeneral amusement.However, this sets off a serious, animated debate about what can and what cannotbe “nadhifized.” How? By deeds, or by sheer words? Voices mingle, hands flutter,and shoulders rise up to earlobes as arguments are exchanged. They remember theice. The ice? Blocks of ice delivered to Mandaean houses. Priests wash the ice and“say some words over it to make it clean,” Mamoon tells me. Does this work? Do thewords work, alone? General disagreement and confusion. Ghazi shakes his large head.Fauzia widens her eyes and throws in an additional problem: What about the waterused to make the ice? Is is clean? These are impossible problems. Impurity lurkswherever you look."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"124Native HermeneuticsGhazi asks whether they, the Mandaeans, can baptize me 360 times to make me aMandaean. I say that I don’t think so. Months before, Mr. Sobbi had phoned me fromNew York, asking my opinion on virtually the same issue.“We’re sitting here, discussing religion,” he begins.Hearing eager voices in the background, I can well believe it.He continues, “Is it possible to make a Jew a Mandaean by baptizing him 360 times?”“You mean, to undo the circumcision?”“Yes!”I think hard, hem and haw, and then reply, “No, I don’t think so. I have neverencountered this in any text. That number of baptisms is required for certain seriousritual errors, but you can’t use that ritual to convert somebody.”Mr. Sobbi is pleased, for this has been his opinion, too. “See?” I hear him exclaimto his fellow debaters. “That’s what I said!”Mr. Sobbi enjoys it when I appeal to texts to deal with thorny issues in the religion.The first time I meet with the Mandaeans in New York, Mr. Sobbi and I have dinnerat Mamoon’s. Mamoon’s father is there, too. The religious discussion intensifies to-ward the end of the meal. The women clear the table and repair to the kitchen, and thethree men and I are left at the table. Mr. Sobbi, who has long since finished his meal,wipes his mouth, clears his throat, sets his face, folds his hands on the table in front ofhim, fixes me with his brown eyes, and says, “Now, Professor Buckley, let me ask yousomething.” And the questions come rolling one by one, piled up in a heap, as if thisis Mr. Sobbi’s single chance to put them to me.John the Baptist, Noah, Abraham, the “origins” question, the Dead Sea Scrolls, thedifferences between the religions—all the enduring questions are here. Mr. Sobbi haswritten down (in Farsi, I assume) the most puzzling queries. “What is this secret littlebook you have in your pocket?” I inquire, half in jest. But it is no joke. In the tatteredlittle notebook are Mr. Sobbi’s questions, those he ponders endlessly. I answer as bestI can. When he gives me a quote, I say, “Well, that is in text x, and because it is incontext y, it probably means z.” To this, Mr. Sobbi lights up, throws his hands in theair, and looks at Mamoon and his father, “See? She knows! She knows!”Mr. Sobbi and I have in common our knowledge of the texts, for the others do notknow them, not in the same way as we do. At times, Mr. Sobbi becomes impatient withthe questions of the other men, and he tries to steer the attention back to himself and tothe topics in his little book. I tell him the pun about yahta (miscarriage) and yahutaiia(Jews).9 This wordplay is news to him, and he becomes quiet, buries his head in his hands,and thinks for a while. Then he lifts his head and smiles, “I like that. I like that a lot.” “Seek and Find; Ask and Be Heard . . .”10I ask about the Ašuriyah, the mysterious annual Mandaean commemoration of the Egyp-tians who drowned when the sea closed on them in the wake of the fleeing Jews. TheMandaeans side with the Egyptians. Mr. Sobbi says that the festival has to do with Noah,while the Aldulaimis insist that it is a lofani for the drowned, who were Mandaeans.11 Iknow of no textual evidence for any of this. Mr. Sobbi is keenly aware of the problemswith the incongruities between what one could call “folk Mandaeism,” the oral, folkloric"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Ducks That Came to the Marshes: New York125traditions, and the written texts. He would like to be able to combine these into a coher-ent system, but it is difficult. To his attempts, I repeatedly emphasize, “But it is not in thetexts!” without intending a denigration of the oral traditions. The written texts do carrygreater weight, and Mr. Sobbi shrugs his shoulders and waves his hands as he agreeswith me, though still eager to systematize them all.Seeming a bit pained, Mamoon asks a serious question: “Do we worship directly orindirectly?” I decide to take a risk:Mamoon, this question comes from the outside; it is a loaded question, and impossibleto answer. I bet this is leveled at you, Mandaeans, by others, for it is about the status ofintermediaries, whether they exist, whether they are human or divine. If the person whoasks you this is a Catholic (or, in a more remote historical perspective, a Harranian Sabean,say), it is different than if it is a Protestant or a Muslim who asks. These two groups tendto show disdain for intermediaries, and if you say “indirectly,” they will have a negativeview of your religion.Mamoon and the others are all ears, and they understand my point. I feel relieved tobe safe enough in their company to answer in this way. Four months later, I notice thatMamoon twice declares, “We worship directly” in conversation with others. His state-ment is not aimed at me but is an attempt to reassure fellow Mandaeans, to “legitimize”his religion vis-à-vis skeptical or competing views.At one point Mamoon reads through the letter of invitation (in Arabic) that I havereceived from the Highest Spiritual Council of Mandaeans in Baghdad. He smiles butlooks a little embarrassed. “There is something funny at the end.” It is about the mbattaldays, the inauspicious days of the calendar when my presence among the Mandaeanswould not be possible. I should avoid visiting during such days. I already know thisand say so to Mamoon, without implying that astrology should be considered to beoutdated or unworthy of being taken seriously.After dinner, Mamoon and I descend into his basement office to look at his booksrelating to Mandaeism and to Arabic history. He has many documents, and there is alarge plaque with a medal on blue velveteen, a grateful recognition given to him byIraqi Mandaeans. Mamoon is building a whole research center containing information,from Arabic and Western sources, on Mandaeans and their history.Later, the two older men, who have remained upstairs, come down the steps to sayfarewell. Mr. Sobbi looks around. I think that he must be reminded of his own houseand its library, now gone, blown to smithereens during the war, in Khorramshahr. Thetwo men leave. Mamoon says to me, “Now they will talk until midnight.”“Really?”“Yes.”The two are good friends and spend much time together. I have already sensed this,yet I am also struck by their differences. The Iraqi, Mr. Aldulaimi, is taller and blue-eyed, a dignified lawyer with a degree from Columbia University in New York, a manof the world, and quite secular in many ways. The Iranian, Mr. Sobbi, short and stillmuscular from his wrestling and boxing days, is pondering and brooding, a speakerand reader of Mandaic, knowledgeable about the tradition and deeply steeped in it.That same night I ask about the fire in front of Majid in the video I saw in SanDiego. What is that all about? A Zoroastrian intrusion? I do not recall it from Drower’s"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"126Native HermeneuticsMandaeans. “No, no,” Mamoon says. The fire is there because it is cold; in fact, theshivering, dripping Majid crouches right by it. And the black-clad woman hovering about,hands clasped on her back? Who is that? This is not in the book, either. She is theganzibra’s wife. She blesses Majid, says Mamoon, and this is a Mandaean adoption ofa Muslim custom, a protection of the newly born. I think of Exalted Kingship’s insis-tence that the ganzibra’s wife in priest initiations has a symbolic share with her hus-band in the initiand. But here she is at the baptism, too.To my knowledge, no in-depth study of the ganzibra initiation exists, only Drower’sdescription in Mandaeans.12 The ritual remains mysterious to me. Why must the postu-lant perform a marriage ceremony for a priest colleague (who already has at least onewife) as part of his initiation? No one knows. There is agreement among the three men—Mamoon, Mr. Aldulaimi, and Mr. Sobbi—that this question should be posed to SheikhAbdullah in Baghdad.A few months later, in Mr. Sobbi’s living room, we discuss the ganzibra initiationagain. Drower did not quite explain (maybe did not comprehend) why another priesttakes a second wife for the sake of his colleague, who would otherwise be stuck in limboas a sort of unborn fetus caught between the status of tarmida and ganzibra. Also, theremust be a reason for the rule that the initiation can only take place when a pious, priest–family member of the community is close to death. I think the new ganzibra becomes akind of conduit for a special connection between the “outgoing” soul and the additionalwife of the other priest. What Drower does not mention, but the Mandaeans here inNew York tell me, is that the imminent death is that of a woman. I want to know: Whya woman? The question hangs in the air. Our conversation shifts to another topic.Surreptitiously, right behind my elbow, Mr. Sobbi is on the phone. To Iran! To askthe priest in Ahwaz! I am floored. It is six or seven in the morning there. Pause.“No one home. In the river, washing,” explains Mr. Sobbi, cupping his hand overthe mouthpiece. Then he speaks Mandaic. The right person has arrived at the otherend. Mr. Sobbi turns to me, “What shall I ask?”What indeed? I am taken by complete surprise. “Ask if they take converts.” Immedi-ately, I regret this, for Mr. Sobbi, again with his hand over the mouthpiece, looks atme with quiet disapproval, as at an unreasonable child, and says, “I cannot ask that.”Of course not. I feel stupid. Still, he does ask, and the answer is: no, no converts,because it would mean influence from the outside. Mr. Sobbi then asks about the natureof the death in the ganzibra initiation, and he receives the answer that the requireddeath before a ganzibra initiation is that of a woman. I am assured that in Mandaeanhistory so far, this has always been the case, though the death could, theoretically, be aman’s. I am suspicious about the theoretical part, and I am almost willing to bet that adead woman’s soul, for the sake of gender symmetry, is necessary for the ganzibra’sinitiation and his colleague’s taking of a second wife.On one occasion the dying woman designated to enable a ganzibra initiation did notdie but revived. The ritual was called off, ruling out that particular priest’s possibility ofbecoming a ganzibra—ever. Word of the approaching death got around to the Muslimauthorities, and the case came to court, for it was said that the Mandaeans had strangledthe woman, tried to kill one of their own. The incident supplied fuel to the fire of anti-Mandaean feelings, and the case reached the newspapers. “Very bad,” says Mamoon,shaking his head."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Ducks That Came to the Marshes: New York127Shafia Aldulami.

Thetwo men ate together; all was well. After the meal, Mr. Sobbi fetched a Qur’an andgave it to the man, who immediately kissed it and lifted it up to his forehead. “Hah! NoZardusht!” says Mr. Sobbi with relish, as he relates this to me. By his action, the manhad shown that he was, indeed, a Muslim and not a Zoroastrian (“Zardusht,” inMr. Sobbi’s expression).Shafia emphasizes her children’s interest in and commitment to their religion. Shetook her daughter Hind, who had suffered a cut, to the hospital. Filling in the form,she put “Baptist” in the religion rubric (Mandaeans very often do this on official docu-ments—with full right). But Hind protested afterwards, “Ma! Why did you do that? Weare Mandai!”“Have you seen your son’s picture?” I ask Mamoon. He is not sure what I am talk-ing about.

It shows heaven,with a globe floating in blue space, and a confluence of two golden rivers, like branches,above the globe. A glowing, light-filled sanctuary stands where the waters meet, andunderneath a comet zooms by. At the bottom is Hani’s poem, defiantly stating thatheaven exists, despite what his friends say. The Gnostic tradition seems to continue inthe younger people, giving hope for future life and generations.Watching a video taken just a few years earlier during Mr. Shooshtary’s visit in Ahwaz,I notice that canned music plays as background to the filmed ceremonies.

The bank of the Karun River is muddy, clayey,and slippery, and the lower parts of the priest’s garments are wet and stained by thereddish water. Next the priest stands in the water, fishing bottles out of the pocket ofhis rasta and filling them for each person who is to be baptized. On this occasion, it isa bridal couple. The bride wears a coarse, yellowish cloak. Three or four older, black-clad women stand by her, and one of them helps her into the river. Just as Drowerdescribes it in her Mandaeans, the bridal couple, later, sit back-to-back with a thin clothbetween them, their heads knocked together, softly, three times. Mandaean life seemsto go on.

Mandaean priestly esoteric literature, the category intowhich this text fits, is hardly studied these days. A number of other illustrations appearin the part of the scroll “The Great ‘First World,’” but the identity of the depicted figureis not specified. Depicted in the same style as other Mandaean Lightworld beings andpriestly prototypes in illustrated documents, the figure is nameless. Drower, the trans-lator, hazards no guess.A reader may consult the original scroll’s facsimile, which is rolled up in the cartoncylinder that accompanies the book. On the figure’s head appear some of the letters ofthe alphabet, though the letters are not in alphabetical sequence, as Drower observes.Read together, the four letters under his eyes—two under each—spell the word shad: “hetestified.” The figure’s body seems separated by a sort of spinal column that divides itinto a right and a left side.

Pondering the inscription and Drower’s relative silence on it, I noticed, in theinscription on the top of the trunk, that each letter appears with its alphabetical neigh-bor—except for D and A. However, these two are the last and the first letters of thealphabet, and so nicely loop the list together in the middle, making a pleasing circle.The only missing letter is H, the final third person pronoun suffix, which in a sense isnot a “real” letter. Leaving out H and including the G twice, at each of the figure’s clavicles,the list succeeds in reaching the correct number of letters of the alphabet: twenty-four.By including the T twice and giving it a different alphabetic neighbor in the two sets oftext, The Great “First World” avoids the H.Convinced that the words on the left must be found in a prayer in the Prayerbook, Ileafed through it and soon halted at the translation of prayer 79.4 After I had consultedthe facsimile text in the back of the prayerbook, things suddenly became clearer.5 Ex-cept for the well-known formula “In the Name of the Great Life!,” all the words on thefigure’s chest occur in prayer 79, but the prayer is totally scrambled. Prayer 79 reads:In the Name of the Great Life!When the myrtle, the myrtle, flourishedIn the gardens of Hibil;When the wild marjoram grew in the precinct of the mandaThey gave me two twigs of myrtleFrom which they twisted a wreath for the jordanFor it is wondrous and fragrant is its perfume!6The “deconstruction” of prayer 79 in The Great “First World” appears to be an ex-ample of those word games for which the Mandaeans are famous. But it still remains amystery why the depicted figure wears the words of this particular prayer, which be-longs to the category of “response” (\u0001niana) prayers. Every Mandaean priest must reciteprayer 79 as he twists a wreath of myrtle for his staff in preparation for conducting abaptism.So, as the priest prepares for the baptism, he might conjure up the image of theprototypical priest, who is Hibil Ziwa. The figure may be just this mythological person,despite the lack of an expected priestly staff. Support for the idea that Hibil is depictedcan be found in the first part of the inscription, on the lower side of the trunk. Thewords in this textual segment, too, give the impression of being those of a scrambledprayer. Indeed, they are. “In the beginnings: waters, fountains of life,” and so forth arethe words of prayer 82, which also belongs among the \u0003nianas. The text is:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"An Inscribed Mandaean Body133In the name of the Great Life!I went out to the waters;at the source of the springs I went (there).I founded three škintas, and set over them guardians as rulers.The guardians I appointed to rule over them are Sublime, blessed, and trusty,for ever and ever.7As with the other text inscribed on the figure’s body, the words have been renderedhaphazardly, though every word of prayer 82 is present.In his introduction to GR 4, Lidzbarski notes the presence of liturgical material in itand concludes that the text has been used in rituals.8 Among the liturgical pieces inGR 4 is prayer 82, which is quoted in its entirety, and in GR 4’s story, Hibil Ziwautters it. He declaims this prayer after he, along with a number of other Lightworlddenizens, has been baptized in the heavenly Jordan. Mythologically superior to HibilZiwa, the Lord of Greatness (mara d-rabuta) is present, and Hibil Ziwa will soon be sentout to the lower world, the world of creation.It makes sense, therefore, to suggest that the depicted figure in “The Great ‘FirstWorld’” might be Hibil Ziwa, and that the speaker in GR 4’s quoting of prayer 82 isthis very figure. Unsettled remains the curious fact of two sets of text, one facing thefigure, as if he might look down on his chest, and one set facing the reader. Perceptivereaders familiar with Mandaean mythology might think of GR 6’s mysterious Dinanukht,the half book, half man who sits by the waters, reading in himself.9 Perhaps the enig-matic figure in The Great “First World” intentionally invites both interpretations: boththe priestly prototype Hibil Ziwa and the mystic sage Dinanukht."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"134Native Hermeneutics12Interpretive Strategies inThe Scroll of Exalted Kingship134Along with texts such as Coronation, The Great “First World,” and 1012, Exalted King-ship belongs to a category of Mandaean texts one might call esoteric priestly documents.1Exalted Kingship is a large scroll, consists of 1,363 lines, contains drawings (with addi-tional text inside the illustrated panels), and in rather elliptical fashion describes theinitiation of the tarmida (this ritual was the subject of chapter 9). Coronation, a shorttext on the priest initiation, tends to march ahead at a brisk pace, while Exalted King-ship proceeds much more slowly. It pauses and delves into lengthy dissertations on topicsit deems suitable. In this chapter, I will limit myself to dealing with selected sequentialpassages from among the beginning of Exalted Kingship, lines 7–225.2 In this sectionthe text plumbs the mysteries of the effects of the novice’s words while he sits inside theškinta on the second day of the initiation. My presentation of lines 7–227 in this textmay be correlated to the relevant parts of chapter 9.According to Exalted Kingship, while the postulant is in the škinta on the secondday, he utters the first 103 prayers of the Mandaean liturgy—not just the baptism lit-urgy, as Coronation and and Drower’s Mandaeans seem to imply. The prayers comprisethe baptism and masiqta liturgies (1–31 and 32–72, respectively), the two \u0001ngirta prayers(73 and 74), three prayers of praise (75–77), and the \u0001nianas (78–103).What makes this recital special is that all these prayers are uttered without theirexpected ritual contexts, for there are no baptisms, death masses, or call-and-responsesettings. Still, Exalted Kingship comments on the effect of every one of the 103 recitedprayers. In doing so, the text interprets not only the inner meanings in those prayersbut also the novice’s words. The interpretations appear to follow unstated exegeticalprinciples evidently taken for granted as embedded in an esoteric scheme. The text ac-counts neither for any such scheme nor for any underlying, native theory about ritual.Nevertheless, this chapter tries to offer a glimpse into both. Five themes running throughthe limited piece of text under consideration are:1. an attention to the mythological figure Ruha as contrasted with the spirit ruha inthe novice’s body2. the text’s focus on evoked time—past, present, and future—in the novice’s recital"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Interpretive Strategies in The Scroll of Exalted Kingship1353. a characteristic strategy of “tailoring” prayer contents from the Prayerbook to ExaltedKingship’s specific interests4. the relationship of the novice’s soul to his spirit5. the connection between the novice and his rbaTo begin, we need to think back to chapter 9 and halt at the point at which the twolaymen accompany the postulant into the hut. These two men give strength to his body,says Exalted Kingship.3 He will need it, for it is not just the novice’s soul and his spiritthat are involved in the present enterprise; his entire body will be re-created. This is thetext’s primary concern. The novice’s old layman self will have to yield to a new, priestlyself, and this replacement, understood as a new creation, begins to take place alreadyduring his recital of prayers 1–103. He is like a moth developing within a cocoon, achick maturing in its egg.Mandaeism usually understands soul and spirit as female, as sisters, elements thatneed to be merged at the death of the body. In the present case of priest initiation, thedeath is of course symbolic, for the ritual includes no human death. But, peculiarly,Exalted Kingship lets the soul present herself as “male” vis-à-vis the female spirit. This isa far from typical Mandaean view, but it makes a certain sense in this case, where thefemale, layman world must be overridden by and subjected to the male, priestly one.Even without a death the initiation can be said to emphasize salvation insofar as a pre-dominance of the “male” world marks a redemption from the “female” one. A chastizingsoul, assuming a male role, will lord it over her spirit companion, whose gender re-mains female but who ideally should change to become male.Like all human beings, the new priest will have a body and an independent spirit, inaddition to his soul. But because of his enhanced soul element, his Lightworld citizen-ship will be stronger than that of laypeople. The entire initiation ritual can be seen asan effort to secure a balance in the new priest’s life between his “female” inclinationsand his emotions and passions, which are ruled by body and spirit, to his Lightworldsoul. Lay status is consistently coded as “female” over against priests, who belong to the“male” domain. As we shall see, even in this limited section of Exalted Kingship, thetext’s vertiginously detailed description of prayers and actions in the ritual emphasizesthe necessity and ramifications of the priest’s double citizenship. Being simultaneously“here” and “there,” the priest must know how to play on this dynamic, to move be-tween the realms, to symbolize and to live the laufa.I now turn to lines 7–225 in the text and deal with the prayers in sequence. In ashort, third section, I will focus on the text’s mental universe.Lines 7–225When the priests in the škinta offer the novice their greeting “Asuta!” (Healing!), itseffect is immediate, for all knots and seals of mandaiuta (lay status) are loosened in him.4This “exorcism” from the constrictions of lay status opens up the conditions for thepossibility of the Naƒoraean, priestly level of the religion. As seen in chapter 9, thepriests then recite a long prayer over the seated novice, who rises, kisses one of the chiefpriests on his head, and, after certain formulas, is ready to recite prayers 1–103."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"136Native HermeneuticsWhen the novice speaks the formula right before prayer 1, his own soul, whose armoris the crown (taga), rejoices in its anticipation of that priestly emblem. Crowning liesfurther ahead in the proceedings (as noted in chapter 9), but the novice’s soul alreadylooks forward to the event. Soul and crown dominate as preeminently priestly features.Parallel to the crown soon to encircle the top of his head, the priest’s soul shall reignover his spirit and body. Exalted Kingship presents the soul as a sort of independent,internal knower attuned to the future event of the crowning.In a jarring contrast to the soul’s just-expressed, jubilant expectation of coronation,prayer 1 points out a lurking danger, according to Exalted Kingship’s interpretation. Thereason is the following section of prayer 1:At that time there was no solid earth and no inhabitants in the black waters. From them,from those black waters, Evil was formed and emerged, One from whom a thousandthousand mysteries proceeded and a myriad myriad planets with their own mysteries.5As anyone checking prayer 1 will see, the mythological figure Ruha is not explicitly named,but she belongs to the dark forces just evoked. It is she who stirs up at the novice’srecital of this prayer, says Exalted Kingship. Her awakening clearly threatens the novice.This is the kind of trick liturgies may play on reciters, for mere mention of the darkforces immediately evokes them. Ruha is the most dangerous enemy the new priest willhave to contend with, and her presence is regularly summoned in the prayers, either asa teasing device or manifesting real danger. Battles with evil are pointless if evil is notmade present. Liturgies conjuring up dark powers do so in order to contend with them.Moreover, the pernicious ones understand the prayers, for they hear when called upon,especially Ruha, who originally belonged to the Lightworld and is contentious andhomesick (as seen in chapter 4). The apparently naive question of how evil rears itsugly head as it does during prayer 1 is logically answered: through the reciter’s ownwords!Next, prayer 2, as a step up from prayer 1’s stirring of the soul and its anticipationof the taga, awakens the “inner” crown, a sort of “Platonic” image of the crown that thenovice will obtain later on. Texts such as Exalted Kingship assume this kind of dualistictypology because a material item is inextricably tied to its dmuta, the upper Lightworldimage that vivifies the concrete item. The “inner,” that is, Lightworld, image is put onalert, readied for action in the near future. “Inner” in this case equals “upper.” Whiledwelling on prayer 2, Exalted Kingship launches into a little lesson on companionship,a further elaboration on the typology just noted. Everything is part of a pair, for theexternal, concrete crown has its inner counterpart, and the two relate to one another ashusband with wife. Neither part can do without the other.6The mystery of the “Father” (as opposed to the lay status symbol, the “Mother”),awakens at the novice’s recital of prayer 3, a prayer for the burzinqa (priest’s turban).The text’s association is suitable, for the prayer praises “the Great Mystery of Radiance”in the Lightworld. At the utterance of prayer 5, whose title is “Let there be light!,” “thesprings of living waters awaken, from which he wishes to receive a sign.”7 Activated byprayer 5, this sign belongs to the baptism awaiting the candidate after the present roundof recitals.Prayer 8 awakens the incense that belongs in another baptismal segment later on;this time it is the baptism for the rba. These two examples, prayers 5 and 8, show a"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Interpretive Strategies in The Scroll of Exalted Kingship137concern with calling on items that belong to specified, future strata, to two differentbaptisms. Two of the “tools of the trade,” water and incense, awaken to their futuretasks, not the performer reminding himself of what he will need later on. That the toolstake precedence over the worker here shows Exalted Kingship’s inclination to stress humanhumility in a work context. The ritual implements are “alive.”At prayer 14, “that adhesive which supports him and his whole body palpitates, standsup, and sunders the mysteries of mandaiuta from their inner protective cover.”8 The text’sexegesis relates directly to the contents of the prayer, but one must note the lack of a bap-tism context in the present situation. Prayer 14 directs itself to the priestly olive-wood staff,the margna, stuck into the muddy river bottom as the officiant descends into the water upto above his knees. The dramatic “sprouting,” the palpitation taking place in the novice’sbody, according to Exalted Kingship, seems related to the olive-wood staff. The staff’s workis to raise up souls to the Light, as the prayer states. Notice how the candidate literallysheds his lay status, like a plant reaching a new stage in its development.The seven walls of iron evoked in the protective prayer 15 surround the novice atthe moment of his recital, and the seven magical sounds in this prayer—ma, ya, baz,aziz, as, asin, and as9—obviously parallel or name the walls. The novice departs fromthe mystery of mandaiuta at prayer 18, which ends in the bestowal of numerous pro-tective Lightworld names on the novice. Prayer 19, next, evokes time in a way that isdifferent than in prayers 5 and 8. These were future directed. But now, at prayer 19,the novice’s recital awakens the water sign of his own first baptism as an infant.Retroactive, in a sense, prayer 19 calls up an action long past, one that neverthelessremains in effect.Prayer 26’s clause “Bound (together) and sealed are these souls that went down to thejordan . . . secured with bonds of righteousness and with the bonds of kušta,10 andwith the bonds of Zhir, the great light of Life!” produces this interpretation in ExaltedKingship: “the spirit is secured in the fetter of the soul.”11 This is the first example of aspecific strategy that Exalted Kingship applies to its exegesis of the Prayerbook, namely,Exalted Kingship’s liberty in transferring roles given in the Prayerbook to actors that con-cern Exalted Kingship at a given moment. So, the souls bound to righteousness, truth,and Zhir in the Prayerbook become the spirit bound to the soul in Exalted Kingship. Ican find no particular pattern to this kind of exegetical play (perhaps it is typical ofreligious intellectuals). In the present case, the text clearly tries to link the spirit to thesoul in a manner that does not unduly weaken the spirit but that places it under thepower and tutelage of the new priest’s soul.Prayer 31 begins, “Radiance goeth up to its place and Light to the Everlasting Abode.On the day that Light ariseth, Darkness returns to its place.”12 According to ExaltedKingship, Ruha (who is unmentioned in prayer 31) reacts to this recital by weeping,complaining that the soul has ascended and that she, Ruha, is turned back to dwell inher place.13 Unable to ascend, she has lost a human companion. One might say thatthis prayer, or baptism in general, hints at what is in store for Ruha at the end of theworld: loss of Mandaeans under her sway. When no Mandaeans are left in the world,it will end.The association between soul ascent and the conclusion of the baptism, reached withprayer 31, depends, as already noted, on the equation of baptismal water with light, forbaptism becomes a temporary access into the Lightworld. Final entry comes only at the"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"138Native Hermeneuticsend of human life. At the novice’s initiation, his very utterance of prayer 31, without abaptismal context but still able to conjure it up, causes Ruha to grieve over lost territory.Finished with the baptism prayers, the postulant launches into the masiqta liturgy.Prayer 33, a mambuha prayer, is addressed to the waters of Life, which refreshes thegood but causes the evil ones to express anxiety about their eligibility for salvation. ExaltedKingship is interested in a liquid more directly related to the novice’s body, however, forat this recital, the text says, the postulant’s semen “awakens and multiplies into 360streams (or: “veins”) and expels from the purity the pollutions that dwell in them.”14Semen is a correlate to mambuha, according to the text, and it acts as a cleansing “medi-cine” in his body. But if the seed is impure, that impurity will rule out any righteous-ness in the veins of the novice, says Exalted Kingship. In prayer 33 the wicked ask whetherthere is no room for them in the place of Light, and the answer is obvious no. “Aswater when poured out falleth on the earth, so (too) doth evil fall abased before good,”says the prayer.15 But Exalted Kingship takes liberties with the prayer contents and shiftsthe emphasis onto the reciter’s own body.At the uttering of prayer 35 (“good for all occasions”), Ruha and her seven planetarysons sit in lamentation, curling their lips in disappointment and disdain at the prospectof the soul and the spirit leaving the body, according to Exalted Kingship. One of theexpressed promises in prayer 31 is “(Though) spirits and souls sit (here) as guilty, (yet)by thy name they shall rise as innocent, (thy name of) Yuzataq-Manda-d-Hiia.”16 Here, aselsewhere, Exalted Kingship makes a sharp distinction between the spirit ruha in thehuman being, which is eligible for ascent, and the mythological mother of the planets,who is left behind with her sons. This emphasis, again, suits the specific interest ofExalted Kingship, namely, the priest initiation, which, to the greatest extent possible,must free the postulant from the clutches of Ruha.During prayer 49 the celebrants of the masiqta would, at another stage of the ritual,begin the complex work of joining spirit and soul as they prepare to depart from thedead body (see chapter 8). But at the moment, mere recital is in order. The intonedprayer affects the planets, who at the sight of the ascending soul, clench their fists,beat their breasts, and exclaim, “Woe on (us) planets! for they (we) are powerless, butthe works of Their [i.e., the priests’ \u0001utras’] hands are victorious!”17 According to Ex-alted Kingship, Ruha and her sons react in a similar way, but they also add, “Why didwe plan to have a company (for ourselves) in this world? He has been saved frombeneath our hands and it (or: ‘he’) will be our downfall.”18 In the text’s interpreta-tion, the salvation does not mark a path out of this world, but from layman to prieststatus. Already at this early stage of the initiation, the planets’ influence over thepostulant is waning.Prayer 51 states:I beheld Life, and the Life beheld meAnd in the Life I put my trust.When this, the soul of N., casteth off her bodily garmentShe putteth on the dress of lifeAnd becometh like unto the Great Life in light.19According to Exalted Kingship, the effect of the first quoted sentence in prayer 51 isthat the soul accuses the spirit of having persecuted her. The soul specifies, “See, (you)"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Interpretive Strategies in The Scroll of Exalted Kingship139spirit, that I am a master whose mistress takes off her female dress and puts on a malegarment.”20This is the first time Exalted Kingship portrays the soul casting herself in a male role.She insists that her “mistress”—the spirit, subjected to the male soul and master—mustalso don the male garment. Such a garment is required for the move from “female” laylevel to “male” priest level. Note that the Prayerbook’s ungendered “dress of Life” and“bodily garment” turn gendered in Exalted Kingship ‘s exegesis. Because the soul haschanged her clothes in prayer 51, the spirit must do so, too. The switch also implies acontinued gender consistency, for now both soul and spirit ought to be male, whereasusually, both are female. Again, we see that Exalted Kingship freely interprets a prayer’scontent to suit the specific purpose of priest initiation.Ideally, a new priest should possess a male soul and a male spirit. This is a view thatopposes more common exegeses not only in Mandaean literature in general but also inother parts of Exalted Kingship. In a masiqta, for instance, the elements remain sisters,female. But Exalted Kingship has a different agenda, a need to press for a movementfrom female to male, while the text nevertheless must concede that the new priest, bydint of also being human, still remains subject to “female” forces.Prayers 49–53 form the nucleus of the masiqta. It is only natural, perhaps, that theeffects on soul and spirit—by means of the artifacts of the fatira ritual—would be reflectedat the recital of these same prayers now, in a quite different setting. Alluding to thehandling of soul symbols in the masiqta, Exalted Kingship warns the novice against thedanger of making a mistake further on in the priest initiation, when the same prayersare used. At the present moment, during his recital of prayer 53, the initiate is warnednot to fail in a future, repeated segment of the ritual. Regardless of what mistakes hemight commit later on while reciting the same words in that future context, he will still,at the present moment of prayer 53, “create, call forth, vivify, heal and establish”21 hisown body.Exalted Kingship offers a peculiar combination of anxiety provocation and consola-tion, it seems. The warning constitutes an explicit command to associate the use of thesame prayer in two different contexts. Present, nascent fear is rapidly consoled, and ourtext issues a warning to be alert in the future recital of prayer 53. Creative activity nowwill not be annulled retroactively by ritual mistakes later on, the text says. But evenraising this question acutely demonstrates a keen sense of acts and their effects. If thecandidate now creates his own body, and then, about two months hence, makes a mis-take in his rba’s masiqta—which will create a new body for the teacher—will the novice’sown body, as he has created it so far, be destroyed? The answer is no. But he may ruinhis teacher’s body and his own in the future ritual if he does not at that later point payclose attention to his work.What map can we obtain of a religious mentality expending energy on such notionsof mistakes and their results? What is the understanding of cause and effect, of time, oftools and their employment? What is the precise relationship between the novice’s andthe teacher’s body? Answers to these questions would demand separate studies, and Ican only make the issues explicit here. Clearly, the dangers of Mandaean priestcraft areoverwhelming.22The two-line prayer 55, “The Great Life spoke and revealed (opened) with His mouth,in His own radiance, light and glory,”23 has the pleasant effect of raising the curtain"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"140Native Hermeneuticsthat separates spirit and soul, according to Exalted Kingship.24 The opening of the mouth,then, becomes interpreted as a raised barrier in the second text.At prayer 68, which depicts the ascending soul being questioned by the tollhousewatchers about its heritage, Exalted Kingship launches into an invective against Ruha.She is described in the following words: “She lives in horrid darkness, sits in the com-pany of devouring fire, and drinks red waters. She wears garments of many colors.”25The text goes on to laud priests, who in contrast to Ruha dress in white silk, enjoyliving waters, and are delivered from “horrid darkness.” Prayer 68 makes no directmention of Ruha herself. Neither was this the case in prayer 1, as seen earlier, for sheerassociation evidently suffices. Ruha may be loosely linked to the soul’s interrogators. Inany case, the context of priest initiation makes it imperative to emphasize dissociationfrom Ruha. Exalted Kingship stresses that the soul’s father is the yardna, but that hernourishing mother is Ruha, the earth, from whom the soul has now escaped. Here is aconscious effort to distance a “real” birth—that of a human being into the material world,from and into material bodies—from the present “birth” of a priest, who must try tocurb a material, Ruha-ruled life.The long prayer 75 celebrates Life as it manifests itself in the lower worlds.26 ExaltedKingship briefly states the recital’s effect as follows: “Ruha and the Seven run away fromhis [the novice’s] presence and take to the depths.”27 The prayer’s contents support thisinterpretation, but the prayer is also one of the few instances in which Mandaean lit-urgy gives voice to Ruha’s pitiful complaint:Spirit (Ruha) lifted up her voiceShe cried aloud and said, “My Father, My FatherWhy didst thou create me? My God, My God,My Allah, why hast thou set me afar offAnd cut me off and left me in the depths of the earthAnd in the nether glooms of darknessSo that I have no strength to rise up thither?”28This segment of the prayer portrays Ruha in need of salvation, a topic not in ExaltedKingship’s interest. For in the present context of priest initiation only the element ruhacan be saved, not the mythological figure Ruha, whom Exalted Kingship summarily rele-gates to the depths.The myrtle in the candidate’s hand wakes up during his recitation of the myrtle prayer,number 79. Now the plant begins to anticipate its future use, when the same prayer willbe recited during the new priest’s baptism of his teacher.29 Another kind of plant imag-ery emerges in prayer 83, which begins, “How lovely are the plants which the jordanhath planted / And raised up!”30 “Plants” (šitlia) is a common metaphor for people,Mandaeans. Turning against Ruha, Exalted Kingship interprets the effect of prayer 83by insisting that she sowed the seed, but that the resulting fruit was not at all what sheplanned, for the fruit “went and became the portion of others.”31 Here is a connectionwith prayer 68, in which the souls stated that their nurturing mother was Ruha, fromwhom they are now emancipated. Despite the polemics, it seems daring to let the of-fended mother be heard on her own terms, as Exalted Kingship does.In explicit, polemical contrast to the Jewish Sabbath (šapta), Habšaba, the Mandaean,personified female Sunday, is evoked twice in the prayers toward the end of the recital,"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Interpretive Strategies in The Scroll of Exalted Kingship141in prayers 81 and 95. According to Exalted Kingship, Sunday blesses the candidate inresponse to his recitals of both prayers. In the latter one, Sunday promises the soul thata guardian shall conceal it from the tollhouse interrogators when the ascending soul is“delivered from evil deeds.”32 Just a bit earlier, in line 209, the soul reacted to the novice’srecital of prayer 94 with happiness at being split away from the “stinking body.”In response to prayer 96, the soul boasts to the spirit that it, the soul, is now pro-vided with “pure fruit and sublime blossom.”33 The two-line prayer 97 reads, “He roseand took me with him / And did not leave me in the perishable dwelling.”34 This canbe interpreted in two ways, depending on whether one reads “he” as the savior or asthe soul. Either the soul has been taken away by the savior, or the spirit has been savedby and with the soul. The prayer probably tends toward the first interpretation. ButExalted Kingship does not consider the matter settled, for it lets the spirit react to therecital by imploring the soul, “By your life, by your life, soul! When you ascend to theHouse of Life, take me with you! If I inflicted persecution on you, do remember me inkindness, for I did not know you and did not understand you.”35 The text still under-stands the spirit’s salvation to be pending.The final prayer in this ritual round is prayer 103, which states that darkness is pushedback and Light established in its place. In response to this recital, the earth’s founda-tions shake and the monster-dragon \u0001Ur (Ruha’s nonplanetary son) “moans like a dove.”36For the time being, then, the dark forces are kept in check. But the ritual is only in itssecond day; sixty-six days remain, and much can go wrong.What Does It All Mean?The preceding section has shown examples of how words produce actions according toa pattern roughly like this: “When you say word/sentence A in prayer B, the result is Cwith respect to D.” Exalted Kingship demonstrates a strikingly wide range of what I call“activated fields” responding to the novice’s recital. These fields include the candidate’sown soul, spirit and body; his teacher; ritual implements or formulas to be used lateron in the initiation; Lightworld emblems; Ruha and the evil forces. Energies and enti-ties are moved around, strengthened, weakened, or otherwise changed. Future and pastevents come into play, and the novice’s transition from lay level to priesthood affectsand effects forces on the most minute and the most cosmic of scales.Two points deserve emphasis. First, the activated fields include past, present, and futureones, which makes for a dizzying philosophy of time in Exalted Kingship. It is worth notingwhen and how a specific time segment is invoked, for there is a modicum of optimismregarding errors committed in the present (e.g., regarding prayers 52 and 53), but direwarnings emerge against future mistakes. One might call this a “so far, so good” attitude.Second, lines 7–255 treat a segment of prayers recited by heart, without any of theaccompanying actions or created environments normally associated with the prayers.The novice handles no priestly implements, is not immersed in water, eats nothing, isnot being prayed over by someone else, and so on. The novice’s superiors monitor hiswords—but the postulant himself performs no actions aside from speaking. His utter-ances are invested with great power and consequences. The supremacy of the word inthis ritual segment testifies to a necessary, early round in the edifice of priest-building."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"142Native HermeneuticsBy sheer words the novice creates parts of the person he is about to become. It is nota matter of thrusting himself back into the ideal condition of the \u0001utras at the time ofthe world creation. Neither is he projecting himself forward onto \u0001utra status entirelyoutside of the earthly world. Slowly and methodically, he becomes both an \u0001utra and apriest, set squarely in this world as a servant to his community. But specifically when hewill officiate at rituals, he belongs to the Lightworld. As a human being, he is subject toRuha’s attacks, but as a priest, his own spirit, ruha, seems to have been joined to hissoul in a way that otherwise holds only for dead Mandaeans whose masiqta has beensuccessfully performed. “Father” and “Mother” aspect in the novice are both active, butthe former dominates.A Mandaean priest continually shifts roles, alternating between opposite slots where“human” marks one end, “divine” the other. But “divine” and “human” would hardlybe relevant terms in Mandaeism, I think, because a priest is an \u0001utra on earth, and ahuman being made priest can leap above the earth into Lightworld geography. As anobjectified status, the priestly office is unthinkable without the prescribed dynamicenterings into and exits out of \u0001utra-hood. When he consecrates himself and his insig-nia for specific rituals, the priest activates his \u0001utra status. In the opposed move, he exitsfrom that level by deconsecrating himself and his accoutrements. Only priests can “enter”and “exit” in this way.37The various “markers” for priests entering or exiting \u0001utra-hood are a so far unstud-ied area in the interpretation of Mandaean rituals. But prayers, formulas, gestures, andthe eating of certain foods seem to be primary signals for being “on the job” or “takinga break.” Watching part of a video of a Mandaean priest initiation that took place inKhuzistan, Iran, in 1991, I was struck by the rhythm in segments of the ritual. At times,the priests took a break, laughed, relaxed, and talked with spectators who entered theritual space. After eating particular foods and at gestures such as honoring their crowns,the priests went back to work. Spectators knew when the priests were on or off the job,that is, when it was appropriate for them to approach the priests or to withdraw to theedges of the arena, respectfully resuming their role as witnesses to the priestly activities.The conditions for making and marking ritual space and time can be glimpsed inthe text’s lines 7–225. The novice begins to learn how to create himself and his ownworking conditions and to be alert to his own, new self as it evolves. What he does atthe moment has repercussions for the future. When Exalted Kingship focuses on certainfuture parts of the ritual, for instance, the awakening of a ritual item or prayer for uselater on, the priest learns to look ahead, to make the relevant associations between whathappens in the present with another creative round further on. A tool or an associationthat is needed days hence must be kept in mind now; otherwise, the work space may beinsufficiently prepared.No ritual context is a “given”—performers create it.38 The full-fledged priests con-struct a temporal and spatial “laboratory” for priest-making, while the novice is respon-sible for his part of self-work. The relative passivity of the officials is worth noting. Inthe segment under treatment, the novice starts to create himself, for it is his spokenprayers that create and affect the elements in the laboratory. Speech arises in the samebody as that affected by the speech. Assuming that the power inheres in neither novicenor words as such, but in the dynamic between them, one may see the novice’s knowl-edgeable activation of the words as resulting in the desired creation."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Interpretive Strategies in The Scroll of Exalted Kingship143The priests watch and listen. One might have expected a more stereotypical scene witha priest of superior rank uttering prayers over a passive, perhaps kneeling or prostratecandidate. Not so here. The novice is creating himself, guarded by his teacher and otherpriests, plus the two laymen. The latter know that the proceedings are profoundly beyondtheir capacity and ken; they act simply as witnesses. But the required presence of laymenis important, for it signifies nothing less than the abiding existence of “the Left,” the flankassociated with Ruha. It is precisely her influence that the novice is trying to escape. Still,the two men’s attendance reminds the novice of his human standing, that his spirit willlive with his soul in his body, that his constituency is the laypeople, “the Left.”If rituals take control by cutting what is united and, conversely, by binding togetherwhat is severed, and if ritual practice aims to facilitate passages and/or authorize en-counters between opposed orders,39 let me conclude this chapter by loosely tying theseideas to the priest initiation. A consistent theme regarding the effects of the treated re-citals is the banishment of the mythological Ruha to the depths, while her elementalspirit counterpart in the novice’s body must be joined with, yet subordinated, to hissoul. Here is an implicit mapping of a macrocosm, for Ruha needs to be enclosed, ifpossible, in a territory safely removed from the Lightworld. The analogue in the humanbody, the microcosm, is ruha, whose existence is both too close for comfort and neces-sary, and who may be manipulated and controlled in the body. She will live there, andthe priest’s continuous task is to police her influence over him. It is vitally important toacquire control over the body-residing ruha because she not only is the soul’s compan-ion but also at the end of the body’s life must merge with the soul.Matters seem a bit different with respect to the quite autonomous mythological Ruha,who may not submit to being “geographically” hemmed in by means of sheer words. Inno part of Exalted Kingship do any material items control Ruha—in contrast to the spiritelement ruha. Perhaps one might say that the microcosmic ruha falls within practical,ritual reach, while her mythological, macrocosmic counterpart remains at large as longas the material world stands.The priest initiation can be seen as a strategic “inoculation” against the vicissitudes ofearthly/bodily life. Priestly spirit and soul are joined in a way that for laypeople requiresa real, bodily death. In a sense, priests have reaped the rewards of bodily death while theyexist on earth. The switch from “Mother’”to “Father” domination works in an analogousmanner, for both domains are effective in the novice’s body, but the “Father” side pre-dominates. The ritual makes possible the passage from one to the other and enables thedeveloping/developed priest to handle the opposing forces within himself. Only the deadare fully citizens of the “Father” side. When the novice’s new body starts to emerge like aplant out of his old body during prayer 14, that body does not really die, but continues,subdued. Collectively and symbolically, this body is also present in the laypeople.This chapter has shown how words create realities. Sitting in the škinta with watch-ful priests, the novice inhabits a ritual space, one that makes his words effective. Hisstatus approximates that of an \u0001utra-in-the-making. And \u0001utras/priests are capable ofcreating realities on a vastly different scale than the merely human laypeople can. Thenext chapter will also deal with creative words, but it centers more on play and puns.When words are allowed to take charge and be creative on their own, Mandaeism comesclose to accepting a potentially dangerous autonomy of letters, sounds, and words. Thequestion is to what extent human or \u0001utra agency may be able to rein in that power."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"144Native Hermeneutics13Mandaean Language Games and Obstacles144A B G D H U Z H T I K L M N S \u0001 P 9 Q R Š T D AThis is the Mandaean alphabet, the abagada, consisting of twenty-four letters and sonamed because of its first four letters. One of them is not a real letter, for the D, therelative particle “of,” is added on as the penultimate letter of the alphabet. The firstletter, A, is repeated at the very end of the abagada in order to make the auspiciousnumber, twenty-four.1 The abagada comes from the female, primordial Wellspring, theaina (often paired with its corresponding male principal, the Datepalm). Created priorto the universe and human beings, the letters are the Wellspring’s children. One maysay that no universe could have been made prior to the letters, because neither speechnor writing were possible until the abagada came into being.Ayar (Ether), cosmic breath, speaks in the abagada, but he himself did not emanatefrom it.2 Imitating Ether, human beings utter the letters and, in combining them, createtheir lives. But the Mandaeans accord a somewhat disturbing autonomy to the abagada,and it is a question how much power human beings have in their use of it. Who is incharge, the letters or the people? To explore this problem, this chapter will focus onerrors, subversive word games, jokes, double entendres, and polemics; in short, theyare the kinds of language games that people play on the alphabet—or that it plays onthem. If we assume that Mandaeism sides with the letters, and therefore in a senseagainst itself, the religion is playing a joke on itself.The LettersAccording to 1012, Book I, II,3 the B emanates from the A,4 and the B then turns to theA and praises it. The G, coming into existence next, turns to its predecessor, B, and praisesit, and so on through the alphabet. “Each king (malka) praised and worshipped him whowas anterior to himself, until a structure was built up, composed of twenty-four kings whoheld themselves together so that their edifice might not be destroyed.”5 Notice here theconcern for the completeness of the alphabet, the emphasis on harmony and co-work."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Mandaean Language Games and Obstacles145Because Mandaeism is, after all, a form of Gnosticism, we should already be pre-pared for signs of disharmony, for things going awry. Indeed, the abagada is threatenedbecause “the construction became swollen with pride and no consolidation took placewithin that Wellspring, and it became deprived, fell, and was abortive.”6 This informa-tion recalls a central creation myth in which the world creator Ptahil stands in the pri-meval waters and speaks what he thinks are creative words (he is imitating Yahweh inthe Bible’s Old Testament).7 But no solidification of the waters occurs, for Ptahil hasnot been sufficiently instructed by his father/predecessor in how to create the world.He becomes despondent and has to give up his attempt, at least for the time being.Ptahil is not accused of pride—the sin of the letters in 1012—but merely of being igno-rant. His father, Abatur, has failed to instruct his son. Comparing this story with themyth about the letters, we see a common theme: something is amiss in the relation-ship between the actors. The lesson seems to be that incorrect use of language pro-duces no world, and, in Ptahil’s and Abatur’s case, the predecessor must instruct thenext creator.According to 1012, no solidarity could take place between the letters when prideand individualism entered the picture, sabotaging the collective. 1012 says that the Lmarks the middle of the abagada, and that twelve letters now assemble on the right,twelve on the left, the groups facing one another like hostile armies.8 Abhorring thisstalemate, the text tries to determine exactly where in the succession of emanations thingswent awry. It assumes that when they reached H, the letters expressed themselves defec-tively, but they encouraged themselves, saying:If we separate ourselves and place ourselves at a distance from one another, the buildingwill not hold together. (But) if we approach one another and merge together we shallconstruct the building soundly and lay it in an orderly fashion . . . [If] we do not joinwith one another, the Right will be useless, the Left ruined, and the mouth (mouthing?)of every one of the mysteries will be spoiled.9That the H, appearing one-third into the abagada, marks the spot where defective-ness came about is a significant piece of information. For the H links up with theMandaean anthropological theory regarding body, spirit, and soul. The spirit as thetrouble spot in the human being parallels the status of the H, for Exalted Kingship, in itsdissertation on the alphabet, states that the H signifies the spirit, while the two othernonletters, the \u0001 (ayin) and the d, symbolize body and soul, respectively.10 Therefore, inthe layout of both the alphabet and the human being, structure and cohesiveness areemphasized, but so are difference and discord. No human being can exist without theinteraction of its three components—body, spirit, and soul—just as no language can arisefrom an alphabet of staunchly individualistic letters.In 1012, the letters encouraged themselves, calling for co-operation. “The mouthof every one of the mysteries will be spoiled”11 if discord continued. “Mysteries,” razas,among many other things, mean “rituals” or “sacraments.”12 If no work can be donewithout collective effort, creative words are of no account, and, worse than nonsense,result in the ruin of language. To counter such threats, the letters take each other’shands. In what follows, 1012 shows a very characteristic interest not only in the prag-matics of language building but also in the pragmatic language of construction. Realconstruction is intended—in this case, masonry. Along with other kinds of construc-"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"146Native Hermeneuticstion and artisan work, masonry for centuries remained one of the traditional occupa-tions of Mandaeans.At the spot where the letters grasp one another’s hands, 1012 gives a simple draw-ing of a rectangle.13 This is building material, a brick (libna). The stunningly concreteimage may seem strange in an utterly esoteric dissertation on the alphabet, but it dem-onstrates very well the Mandaean love of practical thinking and down-to-earth meta-phors. The letters grab each other’s hands at the corners of each brick. So, buildinglanguage and reality is like building a house, for the letters must join in the correctrelation to one another, corners to corners. Otherwise, house/language/world will falldown.The letter L gives the first illustration, says 1012, for the Š watches the L workingand asks, “This that thou makest, what is its name?” The L answers—as we might ex-pect—“libna,” L for libna!14 1012 says that all buildings have four corners, and all thingsare constructed out of four mysteries: cosmic Father and Mother, soul and spirit. Every-thing depends on these four: all creations, all natural phenomena, and all Mandaeanrituals and prayers. “[A]nything which is not constructed of four mysteries will not rise”[i.e., to the Lightworld], but will be spoilt and unworthy.”15Correct SpeechHow does this “anthropomorphic” alphabet philosophy work in practice? If the abagada,both collectively and in terms of its individual letters, is relatively autonomous, what arethe implications for language use? Which kinds of tricks does language play on per-formers—or do they, the performers, play on it? What sorts of strategies are at work?Who uses the abagada, rightly or wrongly? It is worth looking at puns, polemics, double(even triple) entendres, errors in language and ritual, and silences.Exalted Kingship contains a surprising admission of error by the Lord of Greatness,a primordial creator and Lightbeing. At a crucial point in his creating activities, he spoke—or thought of—a word that carries at least two meanings. The Lord committed this errorwhen he created the male human being. He concedes:I clothed the body with a suitable armor and I performed the marriage ceremony and themysteries slept together. And from that moment it was called “sin,” because I made amistake and was doubly foolish and divided it. Behold the date-pit of a date!—its seedwhich issues from its loins! Its name is seedling-palm and it cleaves the ground! Beholdthe human being—his seed stands in the middle of his body, its name is seedling-palm,and they call it virility because it brings virility to the body! The seedling-palm is theedifice and the seal of the king.16The Lord ends his speech by extolling marriage. Still, he did make a mistake byusing the word htit, which means “suitable” and “sin” (and, also, “wheat”) as he cre-ated the male. As a result, ambiguity is attached to the male organ for ever after, andwhat has been said and done cannot be erased. The Lord’s employment of that freightedword, “htit,” continues to play its joke on human beings, sexuality being both suitableand sinful. Trying to rescue the situation by stressing the suitability and necessity ofmarriage, the Lord must deflect attention away from his error by saying, in effect, that"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Mandaean Language Games and Obstacles147The Wellspring, the origin of the Mandaean alphabet.

Because Mandaeans are antiascetic and pro-marriage, his reassurance makes good sense. Still, the word htit played a game on theLord, and if he had paid closer attention and not used that word, it would not havebeen awakened to grasp its own power.The idea that words cannot be undone appears in the rules for copying Mandaeanmanuscripts. Those who peruse such original texts will find that words wrongly copied,letters gone astray, or whole sentences written in the wrong place are rarely erased. Thecommon way of indicating errors in manuscripts is to place a line of dots under theaffected letters. This suggests a profound understanding of the impossibility of undoingerrors, for what was written must remain so, even if it is wrong. Like male sexuality, aswe saw in Exalted Kingship, errors and ambiguities are here to stay.However, some acts and words can be corrected, but they require meticulous work,sometimes of staggering proportions. Sections of 1012, especially, and to a lesser extentof Exalted Kingship, pay detailed attention to words or gestures that are performed wronglyor that are out of place in rituals.17 Pages of instructions are devoted to the rectificationof a variety of mishaps, such as if the officiating priest during a baptism or a death masswere to make an error in a prayer, or to utter a prayer at the wrong moment, or to forgeta specific ritual gesture. These types of listed errors reflect experienced realities and areneither merely hypothetical nor figments of a quarrelsome imagination.Originally, prayers and rituals were created in the Lightworld by the beings there,which were sent down to earth in order to be returned, conveyed upward by humanperformers. Wrong words and acts are not accepted by the Lightworld, which vigilantlywatches every ritual ascending from the earth. What can a priest caught in error do torectify his mistake? The previously mentioned parts of 1012 and Exalted Kingship con-tain what appear to be manuals on these matters. For example, if a priest omits prayers31, 57, 59, or 60 in a baptism ritual, that baptism is void. The priest must stop what heis doing and go back to prayer 18 to put things right again,18 for that is the prayer thatopens the river, making it ready for baptism.If, during a masiqta, the priest forgets to sign any of the fifty-nine fatiras in the firstsequence of the ritual during the recital of prayer 52, there will be deafness in the rightear of the priest and of the soul of the dead person.19 This calamity can be remediedonly by stopping the proceedings, where the priest himself undergoes baptism by sevenpriests for his own cleansing, which renews his fitness for office. Only after this longhiatus—a stopping of time, a parenthesis—is the deafness lifted from both priest andsoul, and the priest may start up the ritual where he left off.Should the priest, in the first round of the masiqta, mistakenly sign the sixtieth fatiraat prayer 52, “he is like unto a datepalm which fire hath consumed; the right eye of thepriest and the left eye of the soul will have incurred injury thereby and that priest ispolluted.”20 And, if he forgets to recite prayer 53, removes his pandama, or detachesthe klila from the pihta at the wrong moment, “all rites (celebrated) for that soul areblackened, and blemish hath been caused to its right hand.”21 These kinds of errorsnecessitate 360 baptisms of the offending priest, a time-consuming remedy speeded upby the presence of eight fellow priests who must gather to spring immediately into ac-tion, like workers by a conveyor belt laboring to purify their colleague.Natural mishaps, such as a tooth that suddenly falls out of a priest’s mouth duringritual proceedings, are not serious. “Trouble not thyself about that tooth; it is, as it"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Mandaean Language Games and Obstacles149were, a letter that droppeth off the tongue,” reassures 1012.22 The tooth is, in fact, likea finished letter, in a finished word, an item that has served its natural purpose and hasarrived at its natural end. Accidentally severed fingers or toes are another matter, bar-ring a priest from office for life.The interpretations and rectifications of errors are based on real experiences. Somemistakes can be made right, others not. Rituals aim to perform satisfying, correct work.Spacing and timing, with their rhythms, starts, stops, and resting periods, are vitallyimportant and modeled on practical activities. Ritual work builds imagined houses anduniverses. Speech and gestures function as the building blocks, comparable to buildingmaterials, for more concrete habitations. In chapter 8, I noted that prayers, especiallyrahmas, are considered as built, not recited or uttered. As in the abagada speculations,the use of construction language shows the religion’s comfort with concrete imagery.At the end of Exalted Kingship, the text states why, at the conclusion of the priestinitiation, the novice priest must celebrate a death mass for his rba:For the novice is a builder who constructs a beautiful palace; if he did not put a brick in its(proper) place, all that he built is spoilt. If he does not read the masiqta for his teacher, thatbuilding and palace is not beautiful. For the masiqta is the roof of that palace, and all therahmas hold together the garment, so that Pure Ether takes them before the Lofty King.23The masiqta—in this case for his teacher, who is still alive—marks not only the newpriest’s “test case” but also the completion of his own initiation. Now the new priesttakes the lead as official, and his teacher submits to the position of “object.” The roleswitch is complete, because the teacher conveyed his novice from lay status, which ischaracterized by babbling speech, to the fully grown, eloquent priestly state. In thedeath mass the teacher remains silent, playing dead, while the new, fully hatched priestspeaks creative, transforming words over his teacher. Earlier in the ritual, identifica-tion between the two actors was stressed by the use of the favorite Mandaean idiom“garment.” “Both stand in a single garment just as spirit and soul (are both covered bya body),” says 1012.24Should the rba die during the škinta period, his brother must step in and completethe priest initiation. If there is no brother, one of the rba’s former pupils may substi-tute. Should the postulant die during the seven days, the same rule holds, but with aswitch: the rba’s brother or former pupil will now take the place of the dead novice. Atthe very end of the priest initiation, however, both rba and initiand substitute mustundergo the “Great Baptism”—360 baptisms—to rectify the impurity incurred.25Drower gives a list of the different kinds of masiqtas for accidental deaths.26 How todeal with such deaths is a subscience unto itself and shall not be treated here. But it seemsthat “inner zharas,” that is, whispered name insertions, are required in masiqtas for thosewho die under impure circumstances.27 In all instances of accidental deaths and in theuses of substitutes, the logic seems to be that work takes precedence over actors.A man impersonating a dead coreligionist is silent, projecting himself toward theend of his life, in a sense, as he envisions his own future self. Impersonators of thedead do not speak, and the speech of those in transitional states is carefully guided. AMandaean infant dying during or before its own baptism at the age of forty-five days issubstituted by a baby-sized bread dough.28 The dough, of course, ensures total silence.Baptism interrupted by death is open-ended and therefore intolerable, like a half-built"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"150Native Hermeneuticshouse. The ritual must take its course, with actors and gestures, but who the speakeris—or who keeps silent—is subject to rules.Excessive speech can be disconcerting, too, as shown in the haunting story ofDinanukht in GR 6 (see chapter 4). Dinanukht (from the Persian: “the one who speaksin accordance with the religion”) is the hybrid half man, half book who sits by the waters,reading in himself. Another half man, half book, Diƒai, comes along and speaks dis-turbing words: “There is death, there is life, there is darkness, there is light; there iserror, there is truth.”29 Dinanukht thinks Diƒai is too loquacious and tries to burn anddrown him, but to no avail. Exhausted, Dinanukht falls into a trance, and Ruha ap-pears to him, declaring herself to be the dichotomies (and others, too) stated by Diƒai,thus proving his message. Dinanukht goes on a tour of the heavenly worlds, sees andhears marvelous things, including the dichotomies already encountered twice. He wantsto stay on in the upper worlds, but his wish is not granted, for he must return to earthand preach his revelation. He tries to convince his listeners, but his words are so strangethat he is considered quite mad.This story can be seen as Mandaeism’s own cautionary tale to itself, for Gnosticsoverly interested in esoteric knowledge may find what they cannot handle. Such self-critical messages are not unusual in religious traditions. One could press the issue hereand investigate further how a religion like Mandaeism plays jokes or tricks on itself.We have seen an example in the htit incident. Also, in sections of 1012 and of ExaltedKingship where an inquirer presents a high-ranking \u0001utra with a long list of questionsabout ritual errors and their rectifications and about specific Lightworld secrets, thequestioner often begs that the answers be furnished “without priestly circumlocutions.”This is a form of tongue-in-cheek self-criticism, an admission that obscurantism oftenplays a role in lofty discourses, that too many words are often simply just that: too much.A different form of critique, directed away from Mandaeism itself, is polemics, con-cerned with those “others” who are too similar to the Mandaeans, too close for com-fort. Mandaean polemics might admit that they themselves once were, but no longerare, those others, though Mandaeans may still fear that they resemble their neighborstoo much. Those too close for comfort include the Jews, who can be taunted becausethe Mandaeans are no longer Jews. But the relationship remains close, and the proxim-ity breeds polemical battles. We have seen, elsewhere, the relished pun on the word forJews (iahutaiia) by the word meaning “miscarriage:” iahta.Mandaeism’s relationship to Christianity is more like sibling rivalry than an inter-generational conflict. Jesus comes to John the Baptist at the river Jordan, demandingbaptism, according to John. 30 John the Baptist suspects Jesus, a “fallen” Mandaean, ofimpure motives. Disturbed by what he perceives to be Jesus’ hypocrisy, John hesitatesand asks the Lightworld for advice, but the Lightworld commands John to perform thebaptism. Evil omens occur during it, for the water turns into many colors, and Ruhaappears as a dove making the sign of the cross over the river.When the baptism is completed, it looks like Mandaeism has suffered a defeat. Butthe text plays its cards close to the chest until the end, for only then does the baptismturn out to have been counterfeit! It was not the Mandaean baptism at all but the Christianone. Surreptitiously, Jesus has been treated to his own baptism, leaving the Mandaeanritual unscathed. At the last minute, the Lightworld magically switched the rituals andturned the tables, and Jesus got what he deserved."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Mandaean Language Games and Obstacles151Such playing with polemical fire can only work when a religion is secure enough inits own position and victory is guaranteed. Also in John, Jesus and the \u0001utra Anuš (whois a competitor to Jesus) engage in arguments and bickering.31 Anuš appears in Jerusalem,heals the sick, gives the blind sight, and so forth. He even claims that he will destroyhis (own?) temple and rebuild it.32 Jesus occupies a very subordinate position, as hehumbly asks about Anuš’s identity and testifies to Anuš’s miracles—which, from aChristian perspective of course are Jesus’ own. But when Jesus speaks, he twists histongue, changing the color and tone of his speech. He literally utters contorted, incor-rect words, which demonstrate his affinity with the Jews, who are devious babblers in-capable of straightforward speech. Jesus asks Anuš for Mandaean salvation, but we donot learn whether Anuš agrees to this request. John’s story might demonstrate Mandaeanarrogance vis-à-vis Christianity. But it is a matter of who speaks, whose words are effec-tive, and perhaps less a question of origins, ownership, and legitimacy.A religion can afford to challenge itself if the risks are not so high as to be unman-ageable. Again, it is a question of whose voice predominates. Chapter 12 already pointedout that at a particular spot in the priest initiation, prayer 1, in Exalted Kingship’s inter-pretation, stirs up Ruha at the mere mention of the primordial black waters and the evilforces. The power of association alone suffices. Also, in chapter 5, I noted how Mandaeanpriests have recited prayers 149 and 159 every Friday and every Saturday morning forabout 1,800 years now, prayers that conjure up and mock the Jewish Sabbath. Everyweek, the threat of the Jewishness of those days rears up, but just as inexorably,Mandaeism wins as Sunday, Habšabba, comes around. For the moment, the dangerhas passed, although it is sure to return next week.The Punning Goes OnThere is no end to the combinations of hand-holding among the letters of the abagada.Once the bricks have been made, all kinds of language houses may be constructed.Some of the most intriguing ones result in seemingly unintended habitations, as in thehtit incident, which demonstrates the autonomy of the letters, not of the users of lan-guage. But the unplanned can also result in errors uncontainable as puns, and suchmistakes must be redressed, when possible. Erring, unwary performers may wreak havocnot only on themselves but also on those for whom they perform rituals. In contrast, amore self-assured, combative mood invites polemics and internal critique. Self-directedjokes show the extent of Mandaeism’s secure identity and generous psycho-economy,demonstrating that the religion can afford internally directed humor.One pointed example comes from the present day, not from an esoteric text, andillustrates the powers of Mandaean evocation, subversion, and control. Mandaeans runa disco club named Ginza in Madrid, Spain. To most people, this is the name of theentertainment district in Tokyo, Japan. But Mandaeans know—and the reader, now,does too—that this is a true Gnostic pun, for the name really refers to the Mandaeanholy scripture, the Ginza (treasure).In Mandaean manuscripts, their colophons, that is, the lists of names of copyists atthe end of each document, often include a special curse on the Arabs. A copyist of atext ends his work with a set formula, which includes a precise date on which the copy-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"152Native Hermeneuticsing task was completed. Right after giving the date according to the Arab calendar, thecopyist adds the formula “according to the computation of the Arabs—may the worldfounder upon them!” This pun and curse take advantage of the word arbaiia (Arabs)and its similarity to the verb “to fall,” verbal root: ARB.33 Sometimes the formula ismissing in a manuscript, an omission that may indicate times of persecution, times whenit is more prudent not to engage in polemics of this kind. How unlikely is it that aMandaean document, in Mandaean script, would fall into the hands of a comprehend-ing Muslim?In the last chapter, I shall deal with some aspects of the colophons, including thepostscripts, which are called tariks.34 Colophons form family trees because they list namesand thereby show the vital threads of scribal lineages through the centuries. They arelike woven lengths of fabric, offering yet another facet of the central concept of laufa.The names of a great number of copyist priests, the colophons present nothing lessthan an unbroken Mandaean history."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"14Thousands of Names, Hundreds of Lineages153History and TribulationsMany years after I had met Sheikh Abdullah Khaffagi in Ahwaz, I started studyingMandaean colophons (tariks) and found that he was the sixteenth in an unbrokenlineage of priests. Calculating one generation to equal approximately thirty years, onemay place the first priest in his lineage to a time around the year 1300. The manu-script-copying activities of Sheikh Abdullah’s grandfather Ram Zihrun, son of SamBihram, are well attested and can be traced to 1802 and 1843, among other years.Since the late 1980s, I have been unraveling skeins of the history of the transmissionof Mandaean documents, seeking a clearer view of Mandaean history. In order tosystematize this kind of study, I continually add to a card catalog containing thou-sands of names and hundreds of lineages. But mainly, I create long charts of “familytrees” of the names in priestly copyist lineages. These sheets of paper stand rolled upin a corner of my study space, and they are easy to spread out across a floor surfaceor a large table. It is often necessary to compare a sequence of lineages with that ofanother scroll. A computer screen would not be large enough for such a task, but awide film screen would do.Except for certain exorcisms and talismans, nearly every Mandaean original textualdocument contains one or more tariks. After completing a copying task, the scribe willwrite out the traditional formula in which he stresses his own inferiority and humilityin comparison to his priest colleagues. He gives his own name, specifies where andwhen he completed the copying task, and offers information about Muslim rulers. Some-times a scribe may add descriptions about the state of affairs in the Mandaean commu-nities and in the province where he lives. There may also be heartrending words aboutpersecutions and sufferings. The curse on the Arabs (as seen in chapter 13) is usuallyincluded, and formulaic petitions to the Lightworld for protection are always present.It is a meritorious task to copy a manuscript. A priest may do it for his own benefitas an aid toward the forgiveness of his sins, or he may be hired to do the work for thegood of someone else. If he copies for a member of his own immediate family, he is inall likelihood not paid. Whenever the text calls for a name insertion (zhara), the copyist"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"154Native Hermeneuticswrites the name of the person for whom the manuscript is copied. A priest may spenda considerable amount of time on a copying task, taking care to avoid errors, to add orsubtract nothing, and to keep his penmanship up to standards. Some manuscripts areastoundingly beautiful, written in clear, unblemished script—tiny or large, according tothe size of the paper. Lines must be kept straight, margins even. Should errors occur,the affected letters or words are dotted underneath (as seen in chapter 13), while for-gotten words or sentences may be added between the lines or creep out into and alongthe margin, despite the standard of keeping even margins. The most common form ofa Mandaean text is the scroll (šapta), but a codex format occurs in certain texts.The Portuguese began to bring back Mandaean manuscripts to Europe in the seven-teenth century. From the 1930s on, Lady Drower bought some fifty-odd texts that be-came the Drower Collection in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. OtherMandaean manuscripts rest, in the main, completely undisturbed in European univer-sity collections or other research libraries. Inscribed pottery bowls and talismans writ-ten on lead strips also exist in research collections or in private ownership.1 Mostly,Mandaeans resist selling their texts to outsiders, and the great majority of documentsremain in Iraq and Iran, in Mandaean hands, many of them texts whose titles andcontents are unknown to us. This is as it should be, I feel, for nowadays there are veryfew researchers on Mandaeism to work on what is already available in the West.In 1889–91, J. de Morgan went to Persia and acquired a few Mandaean texts.2 Heencountered great difficulties in doing so and was assured that this was illegal, to thepoint of threat of death for his informers, middlemen, and sellers. Atrocious persecu-tions had occurred in Persia in 1782. Less than a hundred years later, there was, asalready noted, a massacre in Šuštar.3 In 1782, de Morgan is told, Persian authoritiestried to lay violent hands on any Mandaean manuscript, and recalcitrant Mandaeanswere arrested, tortured, and killed (eyes burned with red-hot irons, body parts cut off,decapitation and impalement being among the usual assortment of atrocities). A ganzibranamed Adam, having lost his right hand to torture, fled to Turkey. He had tucked awaya copy of the response prayers (the \u0001nianas)4 and managed to make his own copy ofthese prayers with his left hand. This manuscript, which forms the basis for one of deMorgan’s published manuscripts, found its way to Amara, in Iraq. De Morgan did notknow Mandaic and had no idea precisely which text he had on his hands. The incom-plete and less than perfect document (perhaps due to the difficulties of the one-handedcopyist) derives from 1833 (A.H. 1249) by the scribe Yahia Yuhana, son of Sam.This date, 1833, is only two years after the calamitous mutana (cholera) of 1831.Polluted river water kills the whole priesthood, and a very few yalufas and sons of priests—no more than three or four men—create new priests from their own ranks. Because nopriests had survived, these few men know that they cannot initiate priests in the correctway. Therefore, they suffer enormous pangs of conscience. Still, if they do not act,Mandaeism will perish.5On this background, one may appreciate the usual Mandaic formula invoked by YahiaYuhana, son of Sam, who, while copying prayer 5 in the Prayerbook, veers off from histext and exclaims:Turn away and expel from me—Yahia Yuhana, son of Maliha,6 and from these souls whowent down to the yardna and were baptised—from fright and fear and trembling and demons"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Thousands of Names, Hundreds of Lineages155and evil spirits and devils and incubi and spirits and amulet spirits and female demonsand false gods and angels and temple spirits and shrine goblins.7Later in his copying work, Yahia Yuhana yearns plaintively for Manda d-Hiia, who, hesays, has been driven off. He ends with the common formula, “Everything is fleetingand lacking, except for prayer and praise! Life is victorious over all (created) works!”8During those same traumatic years another scribe, one of the yalufas who rescuesthe Mandaean religion, is busily at work: he is Yahia Bihram, son of Adam Yuhana.Almost fifty years earlier, in the terrible year 1782 -the time of the Persian persecutions-Yahia Bihram’s father, Adam Yuhana, son of Sam, copies Pašar Haršia (The Exorcismof Wizards).9 But this does not repel or prevent the persecutions in Persia that year.Much later, Adam Yuhana succumbs to the cholera. Yahia Bihram himself copies anumber of texts in the aftermath of the epidemic, and he writes wrenching words aboutthe attempts to rescue the remnants of the Mandaean community and to create priestsfrom the ranks of the yalufas—to which he himself belongs.In the tiniest script I have yet seen in any Mandaean manuscript, Yahia Bihram in1833 copies The Scroll of Parwanaia, the text for the five-day Panja festival. Much later,in 1864, when he is about fifty-four years old,10 Yahia Bihram copies Šarh d-MaƒbutaRabia, a scroll describing the ritual of 360 baptisms for a polluted priest.11 In the post-script to his tarik, Yahia Bihram writes that long ago, before the cholera, he and hisfather, Adam Yuhana, traveled together to Baghdad (Babil) “to remove the Ginza fromthe Muslims of error.”12 Evidently, local authorities had confiscated the Ginza, but wedo not learn whether Yahia Bihram and his father succeed in retrieving the holy book.Yahia Bihram copies many other texts, such as A Phylactery for Rue and The Scroll ofthe Great Overthrower. Together with another scribe he is the copyist of Exorcism of “ISought to Lift My Eyes.”13 In the postscript to The Poor Priest’s Treasury, from 1853, YahiaBihram tells of starvation, persecutions, and killings. He takes his donkey and fleesfrom Iran with his two wives and six children. One of the children seems to have beenborn during the flight, and Yahia Bihram is robbed of all his belongings.14“Cleanse us from the sons of Krun!”15 he implores Manda d-Hiia, and continues, “May Hibil Ziwa and his brothers help us and our root [i.e., ‘our tribe’]! Rescue us intothe world of the Great Alien Life! Oh, our brothers who are coming after us, seek notthe blow of the Khalif on us, [the blow] of the sons of the Seven [i.e. the planets] and theTwelve [i.e. the zodiac spirits]!”16 At the very end, Yahia Bihram does not add the usualcurse on the Arabs, perhaps because times are too dangerous for that.Peaceful periods are rarely documented in Mandaean tariks, but they do exist. Thefirst European edition of the Ginza, by H. Petermann in 1867,17 depends on the fourGinza manuscripts in Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. Unlike Lidzbarski later on,Petermann wrote out all the colophons in Mandaic. Because there are seven colophonsin each Ginza and we, in this case, have four manuscripts (dubbed A, B, C, and D),twenty-eight colophons in all can be studied and correlated with each another.18The scribe of manuscript A is Ram Baktiar, son of Bihram Šadan, who copies theGinza in the year 1560 C.E. (A.H. 968) in the village of Maqdam, which belongs to thegreater town of Huwaiza, in Khuzistan. After GR 18, which marks the end of GR, RamBaktiar adds a voluminous tarik, in fact, among the longest I have seen in any manu-script. It is unusual, in part because of its optimistic tone. Ram Baktiar asks “the Pre-"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"156Native Hermeneuticscious Light” to bless the local ruler, Sultan Sušad, for “we had access to him and sup-port and respect, and we had a permitted religion, and we dwelt (there), and he did notoverpower us.”19There seems to have been no curfew for the Mandaeans. The governor Salman (SayyidSajjad)—likened to his namesake, Solomon, son of David—is credited with having chasedaway certain rebels who threaten the stability of the region and, implicitly, the Mandaeans.Extremist Shi\u0001ites, the Musha\u0001sha\u0001 dynasty, rule in Khuzistan at that time and permitthe Mandaeans to prosper.20 They and their priestly leaders are allowed to instruct theirchildren in the religion, and they even hope to build a mandi soon.This idyllic picture is shattered in manuscript B, seventy-two years after Ram Baktiar’sactivities, when Baktiar Bulbul (nightingale), son of Ram Ziwa, finishes his copying inMaqdam (though the task was begun in the harbor city of Basra). Sa\u0001dan, son of Baktiar,is the man for whose salvific benefit Baktiar Bulbul copies the Ginza. The scribe atsome point asks Manda d-Hiia to forgive Sa\u0001dan his sins—a set formula in texts. How-ever, right after this expressed hope, Baktiar Bulbul mentions the Sultan of Basra andtersely adds, “May his sins not be forgiven!”ConnectionsOn August 19, 1988, the very day that the war ends between Iraq and Iran, I ring abuzzer and am admitted into the goldsmith shop of Mr. Neshet Hermes in what isthen West Berlin. I have not met him before, and he does not know of me, but he isthe uncle of my friend Issam Hermiz. I have come from England, where I have sortedthrough cartons of correspondence and papers of Lady Drower. Lady Drower’s daugh-ter, Mrs. Margaret (“Peggy”) Hackforth-Jones—a woman then in her seventies and aformer Near Eastern archaeologist—had asked me to do so. Peggy has given me an oldpostcard depicting her mother’s primary informant in Iraq, the famous goldsmith Hirmizbar Anhar, and two of his seven sons at work in the father’s shop. I say that I will givethe postcard to one of the seven sons, Mr. Hermes in Berlin, Maybe he is in the photo(he turns out not to be).Admitting me into his store, Mr. Hermes peers at me, thinking me a regular cus-tomer, and inquires, “Und die junge Dame . . . ?” I smile and say that I have greetingsto him from his nephew, Issam, and I tell him who I am. As I put the postcard downon the glass counter, Mr. Hermes exclaims, “Yi-yi-yi-yi-yiiii!” and then throws up hishands and laughs. He disappears into the back room and returns with the exact samepicture, but in a much larger print.21 As I give him the postcard, he says he will send itto Baghdad, so it can go home again. As far as I know, the return is made, butMr. Hermes’s own Baghdad house, recently bought with an eye to retirement there, isbombed in the subsequent war, the Gulf War. Where Mr. Hermes is now I do notknow.The old goldsmith in Baghdad during Lady Drower’s time in Iraq, Hirmiz bar Anhar,is a layman of great knowledge and spirit. Another one of Lady Drower’s main helpers inIraq is the priest Sheikh Negm. He plays the role of middleman in Lady Drower’s nego-tiations to purchase Mandaean texts, and the two remain close friends for many years.Without Sheikh Negm, the Drower Collection in the Bodleian Library would not exist."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Thousands of Names, Hundreds of Lineages157During the 1930s, especially, correspondence between Lady Drower and the priest reflectsthe ups and downs of a friendship tested by difficult business transactions. Using localscribes with a reasonable knowledge of English to write his letters for him, Sheikh Negmkeeps Lady Drower informed of texts that may be purchased (mainly from Persia), of prices,and of the conditions of the texts. Money must be relayed between England and Iraq,books and scrolls copied and sent, but then the Second World War intervenes. Some-times Sheikh Negm sends a package of dates to England. Lady Drower gives money giftsto the sheikh and his community in Litlata for the rest of her life.22Sheikh Negm’s grandfather is initiated into priesthood by the grandfather of SheikhAbdullah Khaffagi, the old priest I meet in Ahwaz in 1973. The two men, SheikhNegm and Sheikh Abdullah, are cousins, and the latter initiates the former into priest-hood, says Macuch.23 While there is nothing unorthodox about this, it may be morecommon to be initiated by a priest in the older generation, often a father or an uncle.Sheikh Negm’s and Sheikh Abdullah’s fathers are brothers, sons of Ram Zihrun, thepriest mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Together with his cousin and brother-in-law, Yahia Bihram, Ram Zihrun becomes a priest in the aftermath of the 1831cholera.24Ram Zihrun copies the Ginza that Sheikh Negm procures more than a hundred yearslater for Lady Drower, in 1936. This book (DC 22) dates to the year of the cholera.Anyone leafing through this beautifully written, large codex in the Bodleian Library maystill find the two flies squashed between two pages, just before the beginning of GL. Iimagine the book accidentally snapping shut during a ritual many years ago, the fliesever since an inextricable part of the tome. Unlike the insects, the dry snakeskin thatused to lie hidden elsewhere in the volume has disappeared.A ColophonSo far in my colophon studies, I have correlated eleven different GL colophons, andthey all cohere at the end,25 going back beyond the man who is usually thought to bethe most ancient scribe: Zazai of Gawazta, who is datable to around the year 270.26Four Prayerbook colophons go back to him,27 So do a manuscript of 1012, Exalted King-ship, and Šarh d-Qabin. Aside from the GL colophon, which extends beyond Zazai andwhich lists clearly human (not Lightworld) scribal predecessors, other colophons pro-vide names of \u0001utras as scribal ancestors. Such Lightworld scribes function to secure theLightworld provenance of the text but provide no historical names beyond Zazai.However, GL’s most ancient names appear to be human ones. Zazai himself is notindicated as one of the scribes, though his pupil, Tabia (gazelle), appears as the son,that is, initiate, of Zazai. To give the reader an impression of an entire colophon, I pro-vide my translation of the GL colophon from MS. A (from the year 1560) in Petermann’sGinza.28These are the teachings on the souls that I copied for myself—I am poor and a child,small among my brethren tarmidas and a slave of naƒuraiia.

There are, in fact, a great number of female names in manyMandaean colophons. As copyists, women are not only owners of books and of librar-ies but also priests.41In the quoted GL colophon, a number of illustrious Mandaeans appear. I will singleout just a few. First, there is Anuš, son of Danqa, who set out at the head of a delegationof Mandaeans to the Muslim rulers to obtain protection as “people of the Book” in themid–seventh century. Second, Anuš Mai\u0001lia, son of Anuš Bihdad, is an ubiquitous copyistand one of the great leaders mentioned by name and blessed in prayer 170, in the Prayerbook.This prayer is Tabahatan (Our Ancestors).42 Third, Bayan Hibil, the initiator of Šaiar andSam Ziwa and at least two additional initiates, is another prolific copyist. An importantcoordinator of texts, Bayan Hibil lived in early Islamic times and strove to establish coher-ent, orthodox copies of prayers. Regarding his work, Bayan Hibil says that he has traveledon foot to many Mandaean communities to compare liturgies. He compiles a canonicalversion, so to speak, and instructs his fellow religionists to be faithful to this canon.43Life Is VictoriousIn 1936, during the time of the British mandate in Iraq, two talismans (qmahas)—DC26—are copied for Lady Drower’s daughter, Peggy (the later Mrs. Hackforth-Jones).

The copy-ist of the qmaha identifies the rulership in this manner, “in the governance of the Arabsand the Nglizia [i.e. the English]. “ The two rulers are king Aduar (Edward), son of kingŠurš (George), and the Iraqi king Gazia, son of king Faiƒil.Mandaean texts not only travel to Europe from the seventeenth century on but also,in more recent years, move with Mandaeans in emigration.

The “host” document, The Exorcism of Wizards, belongs in the repository of Mandaeantexts known as the Drower Collection (DC) in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The document isDC 12, and the old, narrower tarik is glued onto its end.17.

The topic of the cholera and the life of Yahia Bihram are developed inmy ongoing works on Mandaean colophons.19. The last, firm copyist activity date I have for Yahia Bihram is 1867. Lupieri’s TheMandaeans (117–118, nn. 121–28), depends on information in The Baptism of Hibil Ziwa andin M. N.

Theories on the age of the various Ginza tractates—and of many other Mandaean docu-ments—belong to a separate study of mine still in progress and cannot be treated in detail here.For brief statements of my research on this topic so far, see chapter 14.34. This observation was first made by Richard Reitzenstein in his Das mandäische Buch desHerrn der Grösse und die Evangelienüberlieferung (Heidelberg: Sitzungsberichte der HeidelbergerAkademie der Wissenschaften, 1919).35. This is the meaning of his name in Iranian; see Lidzbarski, Ginza, 205.36.

I use the terms prayer and hymn more or less interchangeably, although Mandaean prayersare not, strictly speaking, sung, but recited (sometimes very rapidly) in a form in between speechand song.43. This prayer has proved useful for my colophon research (in progress) in order to recon-struct strands of Mandaean history.44.

In this regard, one might notice Lady Drower’s respect for—among other priests in Amara—Sheikh Jawdat, Lamea’s grandfather. In Mandaeans, 54, Drower mentions nothing about thesheikh’s reticence about her, but she admires “a Subbiyah mother and child that looked like aMadonna and her holy babe.” These are Lamea’s grandmother and aunt.5. These traditions have been waning in recent times.6. This second view accords with Drower’s in Mandaeans, 85–86.7. However, the Detroit Mandaeans now have a mandi, and they have also succeeded inbringing a priest to their community.Chapter 31. A. F. J.

This looks like Jesus’second coming.2.

A Mandaean friend assures me that Jesus was originally a Mandaean, but he fell from hisfaith. Cunningly, he asked John the Baptist to baptize him first, so that his soul would be saved,despite his apostasy and his impending Christian ministry. See also Lidzbarski, John, for thetraditions about John the Baptist and Jesus, 70, 103–9.5. Drower, Haran Gawaita, 5.6. Lidzbarski, John, 126–38.7. See Drower, Mandaeans, 282–88, for the modern Mandaean legend of Miriai as Nebuchad-nezzar’s daughter. Both Miriai and her father convert to Mandaeism.8. There may be faint references here to one of the Christian Infancy gospels, the “Protevan-gelium Jacobi”; see Edgar Hennecke, “The Protevangelium of James,” in The New TestamentApocrypha, vol. 1, ed. E. Hennecke and Wilhelm Schneemelcher (Philadelphia: WestminsterPress, 1959), 378–80.9. Lidzbarski, John, 127.10. Ibid., 129.11. Hennecke and Schneemelcher, New Testament Apocrypha, 2:355.12.

The word for the food, which Lidzbarski reads as zirqa (in John, 130 n. 2 [132, line 6in the Mandaean text]) is an otherwise undocumented noun (see ZRQ in Drower and Macuch,Mandaic Dictionary, 171b); it may very well be an error for zidqa, the chief oblation or offeringin Mandaean rituals.14. Encountered in chapter 4, where Ruha was identified with her.15. For historical evidence, see my “The Evidence for Women Priests in Mandaeism,” Jour-nal of Near Eastern Studies 59, no. 2, 2000 (93–106).16. This recalls the awaited shekinah, the kabbalistic female presence of God, or the personi-fied, female sabbath. For echoes of information from the Christian apocryphal “Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew” regarding Jesus’ mother, see, e.g., David R. Cartlidge and David L. Dungan, eds.,Documents for the Study of the Gospels (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1980), 99, section 12.17. This is my translation. It differs somewhat from Lidzbarski’s, which is a bit broken (John,136). See Lidzbarski’s rendering of the text, ibid. 140.18. Compare with Anuš’s actions, in chapter 4, on Ruha.19.

Here, Miriai is the daughter of the Jewish priest Eleazar. She converts toMandaeism and receives instruction from its priests. The father tries to kill his daughter andher fellow believers, but they escape. A falcon (Anuš) appears, and Miriai wishes to follow himto the Lightworld, but she is told that her time has not yet come. In terms of gender, this legendis much tamer than the one in John.21. Lidzbarski, John, 85–90.22. Ibid., 85.23. This story may be a Mandaean version of some of the information found in Hippolytos’saccount of the Naassenes (see A. Roberts and J. Donaldson, “The Refutation of All Heresies,”in The Ante-Nicene Fathers, vol. 5, ed. A. Roberts and J. Donaldson [New York: Scribner’s,1926], book 5, chap. 3, 52b). “The beauteous seed of Benjamin” appears here, and there is aninteresting parallel between Miriai speaking to the men, in John, and Mariamne as the recipientof certain of the Lord’s teachings, via Jacob, in Hippolytos (ibid., chapter 2, 48a and b).24. In the story in Drower, Mandaeans, Miriai and the Mandaeans depart for the hills ofMedia (see reference in note 7).25. Lidzbarski, GR 15, 11, 341.26. Ibid.27.

Keeping in mind that Sunday is also a Christian holiday, one might wonder about theunavoidable conflicts in terms of the Mandaean choice of a holiday. Drower, Prayerbook, no.113 (109–10) states that the Sunday has committed sins that need atonement. It is unclear whichsins are meant, and Schou-Pedersen, pondering this, suggests that the Sunday has sinned byletting itself be worshiped by the Christians (Bidrag, 187).30. Drower, Prayerbook, 140. As so often in descriptions of Manda d-Hiia and other \u0001utras,this looks like an appropriation of Jesus’ miracles.31.

Mr. Askari’s father, Sheikh Bandar, was a Mandaean community leader in Khorramshahr.2. Three suras in the Qur\u0002an deal with this issue, 2:62, 5:69, and 22:17. Only the last onementions the Zoroastrians. Traditionally, three religious groups have enjoyed protection underIslam, and while the Jews and Christians seem to remain safely within the perimeters of protec-tion, the situation wavers with regard to the third category, for legislation tends to allow only oneslot for Sabeans and Zoroastrians. Evidently, both cannot be covered simultaneously.3. See my “A Study of the Two Liturgical Collections.”4. He reigned from 1848 to 1896.Notes to Pages 52–61179"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"5.

Two other, shorter, forms of ablutions, the tamaša and the rišama, do not require a priest,and a person may perform them virtually anytime, but especially after bodily or emotional pol-lutions, for instance, after sexual activity or after subsiding from anger at somebody.10. During Panja (parwaniia), the intercalary period, the doors to the Lightworld are wideopen, and it is a particularly auspicious occasion for baptism.11. Rahmas (establishing prayers) are one among several types of prayer in Mandaeism.There are different rahmas for the seven days of the week (see Drower, Prayerbook, 106–70 forthese prayers).12.

In the main, I will correlate Drower’s three texts Coronation, Prayerbook, and Mandaeans.Eric Segelberg’s “Traƒa d-taga d-Šišlam Rabba: Studies in the Rite Called the Coronation of ŠišlamRabba,” in Zur Sprache und Literatur, ed.

There are stories about youngmen who wish to become priests but are ineligible because of a lost part of a finger or similaraccidents.

What Drower translates as “circlet” is klila in the facsimile of the text.21. Ibid., 163–66. In the ganzibra initiation, a “real” marriage takes place, though not forthe postulant.22. The set for each consists of seven prayers, possibly correlating with the seven drafts ofhamra.23. Drower, Prayerbook, no. 105, 104–6 (Drower also gives it in her, Mandaeans, 245–47).24. Drower, Prayerbook, 36. As noted earlier, prayer 35 is “good for all occasions.”25. Drower, Coronation, 21–22 (Drower’s footnote 1, 22, is thus misguided).26. For mana, see Drower and Macuch, Mandaic Dictionary, 246b-247a, mana 1 and 2.Translations range from “implement” and “vessel” to “garment,” “soul,” and “intelligence.” Theword merits a study of its own.27. Drower, Prayerbook, 52.28. See Drower, Mandaeans, 154–55.29. At an earlier stage in the ritual, the rba was warned not to utter these prayers (see note 15).30. Drower, Coronation, 23.31. Consult the chapter on the masiqta. What seems to be missing from the current specu-lation is any attention to the second part of the masiqta, the first treatment of the six biscuits.32. For theƒa at a marriage ceremony, see Drower, Mandaeans, 67–68.33. Drower, Coronation, 25.34. Here these three prayers are called “rahmas,” although, according to Drower, this is notstrictly their correct appellation (see contents, Prayerbook).35. Ibid.36. Ibid.37. Ibid., 4–5.38. Ibid., 36.39. Drower, Mandaeans, 215; Segelberg, Maƒbuta, 19–21. The roots are QUM, QRA, andTR9.40. Again, only the second treatment of the six biscuits is called the “Father masiqta,” whilethe combination of all three sections makes up the “masiqta of the Parents” performed exclu-sively at Panja.41. Drower, Coronation, has actually started its prayer sequence before prayer 323.42. Both texts add a prayer here that is not in the prayerbook.43. Drower, Coronation, 9, seems to indicate that prayer 57 occurs here; I consider this anerror.44. End of novice’s baptism. Note that the other text has been silent on the entire precedingsegment, except for one sentence; Drower, Coronation, 9.45. The second text leaves out any mention of prayer 191. While the coronation text em-phasizes marriage, Exalted Kingship stresses the investiture.46. These are not really in sequence, for Exalted Kingship here refers back to an earlier sec-tion, which is a technique characteristic of this text (as we shall see in chapter 12).Chapter 101. This text, in Lidzbarski’s John, 196–200, is a curious one. I had asked Mr. Sobbi to readthis particular tractate because I was working on it at that time (see my “Professional Fatigue”).2. I did not know that I would travel to Iran a little more than a year later and that I wouldmeet these three priests. Then, Sheikh Salah had become a ganzibra.184Notes to Pages 101–116"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"3. See Drower, Mandaeans, 30–31, for a description of the ritual dress.4. See chapter 6 for Sheikh Choheili. This is the man who made possible R. Macuch’s Neuman-däische Texte im Dialekt von Ahwaz, one of the few books to contain a large number of stories, anec-dotes, and events told in modern Mandaic (another one is Macuch’s Neumandäische Chrestomathie).5. In Ahwaz, Iran, I visited a walled-in Mandaean cemetery.6. This comes from the Muslim custom of reading the first sura of the Qur’an at funerals.The sura is titled “Fateha” (beginning).7. Lamea taught me that before food, the formula is “In the name of the Life and in thename of Manda d-Hiia!” After food, one says, “Thank you, O my Lord!”8. Later I checked this with my friends at General Theological Seminary. We consulted thecomputer and looked at maps. The answer, though debated, is negative: “Zobah” seems to referto a region near Damascus, not to a people.9. See chapter 12.10. A phrase from the initial formula of the Prayerbook.11. Compare this with Lamea’s explanation, chapter 2.12. Drower, Mandaeans, 169–77.Chapter 111. Like the other illustrations in the text, the figure appears only in the facsimile part ofDrower, The Great “First World” and The Lesser “First World.” The translation of the text on thefigure is in The Great “First World,” 8–9.2. Drower accidentally leaves out this third line.3. Drower, The Great “First World,” 9 n. 2.4. Drower, Prayerbook, 89.5. Ibid., 122.6. Ibid., 89.7. This is my translation (Drower’s is in her Prayerbook, 90). Instead of Drower’s phrase “Atthe fountainhead I came forth,” Macuch has very helpfully supplied the correction, “I went outto the waters,” which is a Persian idiom (personal communication to me from Macuch).8. Lidzbarski, Ginza, 142.9. For Dinanukht, see chapter 4, on Ruha. Other scholars have recently taken an interest inDinanukht, especially in his Persian roots; see Ezio Albrile, “L’estasi di Dinanukht,” Rivista delTeologia, Asprenas 46 (1999): 195–224. One looks forward to Dan Shapira’s so far unpublishedessay “Anuš and Uthra” and current research by Sinasçi Gündüz (personal communications).Chapter 121. As noted in chapter 9 , two of these, The Great “First World” and Exalted Kingship, mustbe present in the škinta during the tarmida initiation.2. See my Exalted Kingship. Lines 1–7 give the set initial formula for most Mandaean texts—as found at the beginning of prayer 1—with the requisite petition for forgiveness of sins for thecopyist and his family members.3. Ibid., line 15, 24. Ibid., lines 16–17, 2.5. Drower, Prayerbook, 1.6. In another, longer section on mystical companionship, the text states that “there is aninner and an outer in all things” (Exalted Kingship, line 733, 42, with commentary, 91–92).7.Exalted Kingship, lines 35–36, 3.8.

For a report on two of de Morgan’s acquired texts, see my “A Study of the Two Liturgi-cal Collections.”3. See chapter 6.4. This title is a misnomer in the context, as I have shown in “A Study of the Two LiturgicalCollections.”5. Noting the unorthodox creation of priests right after the cholera, some scholars have tendedto belittle the Mandaean religion as having become degraded and corrupt since the epidemic.This is, in my view, an unjust denigration.6. In zharas, the person’s baptismal (maƒbuta) name is used. The name designates the per-son in relationship to the person’s mother, not to the father.7.

Evidently, scholars of thistime and region have not been aware that Mandaean tariks provide sources for Islamic history.21. A similar photograph is in Drower, Mandaeans, plate 1b.22. For an account of the letters between the two, see my “A Mandaean Correspondence.”23. See Rudolf Macuch, “Zur Grammatik und zum Wörterbuch des Mandäischen,” inZur Sprache und Literatur der Mandäer, Studia Mandaica I, ed. R. Macuch (Berlin: de Gruyter,1976), 75.24.

Because of the time difference, this man cannot be identical with his namesake, whowent in the mid–seventh century with a delegation as the head of the Mandaeans to ask theMuslims for protection.31. The term is kiniana, which means “father’s family line.” In Drower and Macuch, MandaicDictionary, 214a, this is not clearly indicated.32. The term is laqab. Here, too, ibid., 228a, simply says “tribal or family name.”33. This should probably be “he,” i.e., Manƒur \u0001Ubadia (= Anuš, son of Zihrun).34. Notice that the two brothers have the same initiator, Adam Bayan.35. The two different “fathers” or initiators given for the two brothers seem garbled: Šadanis not the father of Bayan Hibil, but a fellow initiate of three other men: Bayan Hibil, BananBihram, and Bihram; see Petermann, Sidra Rabba, 232, for GL’s MS.
