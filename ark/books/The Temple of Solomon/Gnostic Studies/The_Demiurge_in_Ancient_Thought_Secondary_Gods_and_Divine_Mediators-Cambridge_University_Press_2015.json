[{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE DEMIURGE IN ANCIENT THOUGHTHow was the world generated and how does matter continue to beordered so that the world can continue functioning? Questions likethese have existed as long as humanity has been capable of rationalthought. In antiquity, Plato’sTimaeusintroduced the concept of theDemiurge, or Craftsman-god, to answer them. This lucid and wide-ranging book argues that the concept of the Demiurge was highlyinfluential on the many discussions operating in Middle Platonist,Gnostic, Hermetic and Christian contexts in the first three centuriesad. It explores key metaphysical problems such as the origin of evil, therelationship between matter and the First Principle and the deploy-ment of ever-increasing numbers of secondary deities to insulate theFirst Principle from the sensible world. It also focuses on the decreas-ing importance of demiurgy in Neoplatonism, with its postulation ofprocession and return.carl s ́ean o’brienis Alexander von Humboldt Fellow in theDepartment of Philosophy at Ruprecht-Karls-Universit ̈at Heidelbergand Research Associate, Centre for the Study of the Platonic Tradition,Trinity College, Dublin."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE DEMIURGE INANCIENT THOUGHTSecondary Gods and Divine MediatorsCARL S ́EAN O’BRIEN"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"University Printing House, Cambridgecb28bs, United KingdomCambridge University Press is part of the University of Cambridge.It furthers the University’s mission by disseminating knowledge in the pursuit ofeducation, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence.www.cambridge.orgInformation on this title:www.cambridge.org/9781107075368©Carl S ́ean O’Brien2015This publication is in copyright.

Indeed, if one considers the existence of variouscosmological myths spanning different cultures, it precedes the existenceof any sort of ‘scientific methodology’. The search for an explanation ofthe generation of the world can be found both at the beginning of Greekscience and philosophy in the speculations of the pre-Socratics, and in earlyGreek literature, exemplified by Hesiod’sTheogony. The present studyexamines the distinctly Platonic concept of demiurgy and its influencefive to seven centuries after the dialogue in which it first appeared wascomposed. My main approach is diachronic: I firstly analyse Plato’s conceptof the Demiurge as expressed in theTimaeus, and the interpretation ofthe dialogue by Aristotle, the Old Academy and modern commentators(Chapter 2). I also consider the principal philosophical problems whichPlato bequeathed to his successors, before turning to the chief period underdiscussion, the first to third centuries ad (Chapters 3–9). This allows theprincipal metaphysical challenges posed by theTimaeusto be identifiedbefore considering the responses of subsequent interpreters. My policythroughout has been to structure the discussion around individual texts,rather than an intra-traditional organisation adopting a more thematicapproach. This allows greater consideration of the aims of the text andthe context in which it was composed than would otherwise be possible.A thematic approach might have a potentially distorting effect by notadequately evaluating the reliability of textual transmission (Numenius’fragments and Origen’sPeri Archˆonare good examples) or obscuring thenature of a work. (In the case of theDe Iside et Osiride, for example, it isimportant to note that Plutarch’s comments are made in the context of anexegesis of Egyptian myth.)1"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2Demiurgy and other approaches to world-generationIt is fitting, though, firstly to elaborate the theoretical framework of thestudy here. In spite of Baltes’Die Weltentstehung des platonischen Timaiosnach den antiken Interpreten(1976)1and the research of Jan Opsomer andFranco Ferrari, there is an issue of whether demiurgy can be said to exist as aconcept or whether we are simply dealing with unrelated and independentspeculations relating to the generation of the cosmos, particularly sincethe Demiurge disappears from view under Plato’s successors. The first taskfacing us is to demonstrate that it is possible to trace the influence of theTimaeusupon concepts of world-generation, and to suggest the reasonsunderlying its return to popularity during the first to third centuriesad.Demiurgy can be described as world-generation via the ordering ofpre-existent matter by an entity, sometimes represented as endowed withonly limited abilities, according to some sort of model, so that the activ-ity is generally regarded as intellective, as opposed to thecreatio ex nihiloenvisaged in the Judaeo–Christian concept of creation, where God createssimply by willing it to happen. There are naturally some complexities inattempting to delineate both approaches to world-generation, which shallbe dealt with later. I further contend that there are a range of subdivisionsof demiurgy, depending on the sect by which, and the period in which,they were applied, even if historically dependent upon each other and allultimately stemming from Plato’s myth in theTimaeus. So, for example,Neoplatonic demiurgy differs from its Middle Platonist counterpart inpositing multiple demiurges, which function within triads. These demi-urges are assigned a highly circumscribed role, such as responsibility forpartial or universal demiurgy at the encosmic or hypercosmic level. Evenif this can be viewed as simply the development of already existent trends,it differs from what is found in Middle Platonist philosophers, since thesystem of world-generation posited by Plotinus is one of ‘procession’ and‘return’. So the One does not generate as the result of conscious activity,in the same way that the Demiurge does, but rather overflows, produc-ing the next ontological level, which orders itself in response to the Oneabove. Similarly, the Gnostic conception differs in regarding the Demi-urge as either evil or ignorant and placing him in opposition to the FirstPrinciple. In Numenius, by contrast, the Demiurge collaborates with theFirst Principle. Admittedly, the Gnostic version is in many ways the ulti-mate development of Numenius’ insistence on a distinction between the1Baltes and D ̈orrie also collected and commented upon relevant Bausteine: especially relevant in thiscontext are Bausteine125–35on the Theory of Forms, Bausteine136–45(the generation of the world)and Bausteine146–50(the elements) in D ̈orrie and Baltes1998and Baustein159(the generation ofsoul) in D ̈orrie and Baltes2002."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The theoretical background3First God, who is the First Principle and the Second God, who is theDemiurge.The situation is further complicated by the appropriation of aspects ofdemiurgy by members of the Judaeo–Christian tradition as a mechanismfor providing a ‘scientific’ exegesis of the creational account ofGenesis.Thetwo most notable proponents are Philo and Origen, although St Basil isalso influenced by demiurgy in hisHexaemeronand he, like Calcidius inhis great commentary on theTimaeus, is more heavily influenced by theMiddle Platonist variant, rather than by Neoplatonism.2Since a dichotomyeven between Judaeo–Christian creation and Platonic demiurgy has notbeen observed, how then do we set about defining the concept?The first question is the issue of terminology. The noundemiourgos,‘craftsman’, and the verbdemiourgein, ‘to labour like a craftsman’, are bothfrequently used by thinkers influenced by this concept. St Basil describes theworld asdemiourgiaor craftsmanship. Since this term before Plato wouldhave been somewhat strange to use in reference to God, we can identifyin such terminology the influence of theTimaeus. This does not helpwith our definition, since it could be argued that Plato’s influence merelyhelped to develop a common language, without necessarily referring toan identical concept, and furthermore that this had simply become partof the philosophical heritage of the period, rather than as the result ofany more extensive legacy. Indeed not all accounts which are influencedby demiurgy refer to their instrumental cause as a Demiurge. Numeniusclearly posits a demiurgic figure, even though he refers to him as a SecondGod. Philo’s demiurgic entity is called theLogosand Origen’s instrumentalcause is the Son-Logos(although he applies the title of ‘Demiurge’ to theFather and describes the Son as the ‘immediate Demiurge’). Calcidius alsonever uses the Latin loan-worddemiurgusto translate the Greekdemiourgosand in both his translation and his commentary prefers to use words likeopifexorfabricator. Using the imagery of craftsmanship to represent adivine entity when describing world-generation might seem like a morepromising definition. That runs into difficulties when one considers thatGod in the creation accounts ofGenesis(Gen.1:1–2:4aandGen.2:4bff)isdescribed as a potter or builder and clearly we are not dealing with eitherthe ordering of pre-existent matter or a text influenced by theTimaeus.In spite of this, analysis of the texts reveals a shared heritage, notjust amongst Middle Platonist thinkers, but even in the Christian and2St Basil uses the demiurgic image to highlight God’s sympathy for artisans, since He is one too andpresents the Son as the demiurgic power, while the Father is the final cause, much like Origen, evenif elsewhere in theHexaemeronhe adopts an anti-philosophical stance. See O’Brien, C. S.:2011."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"4Demiurgy and other approaches to world-generationGnostic traditions. However, beyond stating that the Demiurge performsthe intellective activity of ordering matter, which is pre-existent, accordingto a model which is also pre-existent and that this ordering takes placeon rational lines, i.e. according to geometric or mathematical principles,there is no coherent system of demiurgy. What can be demonstrated isthat the thinkers surveyed here are influenced by theTimaeus, rather thanpresenting unrelated speculations on world-generation. Clearly Philo andOrigen’s understanding of the Creation does not derive entirely from thespontaneous sort of activity described in the Biblical accounts, and theirattempt to integrate a noetic realm with theGenesisaccount can only havearisen under Platonic influence.Demiurgy cannot be reduced to a single, coherent pattern, since themotif was exploited by such a range of thinkers. Even within Platonism,Plutarch and Atticus do not demote the Demiurge to a second-rank figureas Numenius does. However, the unity of my thesis is that while thereare different representations of demiurgy, this is as a result of divergentreadings of theTimaeus.Therefore, the present study is justified, not justbecause it examines theNachlebenof one of Western philosophy’s mostinfluential works, but because it reveals the use made of Plato to solvean important question: how did the world as we know it come to be?3However, that does not mean a range of atomised opinions. Certain trendsemerge. Frequently, for example, the Demiurge produces the world as theresult of his goodness. He desires that the world should be as good aspossible, and achieves this by bringing order to the disordered elements.The Demiurge may also function as an intermediary between the higher,noetic world and the sublunar, material realm.4However, any attempt at adefinition does not exhaust the complexity of the demiurgic notion or trulyaccount for the various ways in which it is exploited. It is also misleadingto represent those who exploit the motif as conceiving demiurgy as part ofa coherent system; rather they respond differently to the questions raisedand the intellectual challenges posed by theTimaeus. Modern exegeses ofthe dialogue have similarly failed to reach a consensus.Influence of the StoicLogosHaving attempted to define demiurgy and having at least managed todelineate some of its most pervasive features, the next step is to consider3TheTimaeusalso raises the subsidiary question: why was it designed that way?4O’Brien, C. S.:2007b,60"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The theoretical background5why such an approach to world-generation should prove inconsequentialin the Old Academy, only to re-emerge again in the first centuryad.Demiurgy ceased to be of interest within the Old Academy, since it nolonger favoured the Theory of Forms, without which there is not muchneed for a Demiurge to instantiate Forms in the material realm. TheDemiurge’s return to prominence, on the other hand, may be traced tothe fact that he proved useful in the academic climate of the first to thirdcenturies, as a means of accommodating dualistic systems which werepopular during this period.In any case, the Demiurge did not simply disappear, but persisted inthe Stoic concept of theLogos, as a rational divine element which assistedwith the better ordering of the world. This Stoic contribution to the inter-pretation of theTimaeushas been conclusively demonstrated by GretchenReydams-Schils’1999studyDemiurge and Providence.It might appearcounterintuitive to suggest that the Stoics played an important role incosmological theory, since they displayed such limited interest in the areain the period following Posidonius. However, this is mainly due to theirreliance on the doxographical codification of their viewpoints, and, asLapidge points out, the resultant lack of an adequate expertise in cosmol-ogy to respond to the criticisms of figures like Plutarch leaves us with ahighly biased account of the technical level of Stoic cosmology.5The Stoicswere also less interested in cosmology once it seemed to be less importantfor achieving their ethical objectives. Cosmology could be justified if thetelosof life was to bring oneself into harmony with the cosmos, but asthe Stoics began to adopt an increasingly more realistic understanding ofthe minor role which man played in the cosmos as a whole, interest in thisdiscipline waned. The Stoics, though, are an important intermediary stagein the development and transmission of demiurgy.Plato in theTimaeuspresents world-generation in two different ways,the more famous of which is the account of a Craftsman-god toiling atfashioning the universe, and the description of Reason and Necessity canbe regarded as complementary to this. The second, less celebrated image isa biological one – the Receptacle is described as the mother and nurse of all.The Stoics use the language of the technological image, but ultimately rejectit in favour of the biological one, which is enriched with appropriationsfrom Aristotle’s theory of sexual generation. In his important article ‘Natureas Craftsman in Greek Thought’, Friedrich Solmsen demonstrates thatboth images of world-generation, that of craftsmanship and procreation,5Lapidge:1973,240"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"6Demiurgy and other approaches to world-generationactually precede Plato, but the primary model in Greek cosmogony isthe biological one. This is illustrated by the marriages of various deitiesin the earliest Greek cosmogony which we possess: Hesiod’sTheogony.However, it should be noted that both there and in theWorks and Days,Hephaestus fashions the first woman, meaning that both technical andbiological concepts co-exist from the beginning of Greek speculations inthis area.Empedocles too uses an image that can be regarded as demiurgic inhis description of earth ‘receiving in broad melting pots two portions ofwater and four of fire’.6Plato’s Demiurge echoes elements of Anaxagoras’Nousto the extent that they are both ordering Intellects. As Anaxagorascomments ‘mind also devised this orderly revolution in which now thestars, the sun and the moon revolve’.7Despite this, Solmsen concludesthat ‘the Demiurge of Plato’sTimaeus is a conception much too original tobe explained as a synthesis of earlier thinkers’ ideas’.8It is not that Plato’sDemiurge is merely a Mind that orders, rather he is capable of deliberatelypursuing rational choices in order to further his objectives. For example,he chooses a skull constructed of bone, rather than flesh, as this will endowhumans with greater rational capacity, thereby furthering his objective ofa cosmos with increased order and intelligibility (Tim.75b).The Stoics distinguish between an active and a passive principle, whichcan be described in various ways – as God orLogosand matter or as fire andmoisture. Despite this, the Stoics adopt a monistic approach, similar tothat of the pre-Socratics. Their two principles do not exist independentlyof each other and the distinction is essentially just one which is madein thought, rather than observable in actuality. While it may seem evidentthat that which acts could not possibly have much of a role to play withoutthat which is acted upon, such an argument provides another weapon inthe arsenal of those engaged in polemical attacks against the Stoics, who arealready vulnerable as a result of what appears to be a failure to differentiateproperly between principles, such as God and matter, and elements, suchas fire and water.In any case, the Stoics account for two of the principles of theTimaeus,but positively reject its third principle, the Forms. In their version, God isimmanent:The Stoics also criticise Plato for having said that since the models of allthings exist in a venerable, pre-existent and ancient substance, the sensible6Fr.31b Diels-Kranz, trans. Solmsen.7Fr.59b12Diels-Kranz, trans. Solmsen.8Solmsen:1963,480"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The theoretical background7world was made by God according to an immortal model. For, in fact,there is no need for an immortal model, according to them, since theseminal reason, which pervades another nature, which takes hold of it andapprehends it, has brought forth the whole world and everything which isin it. (Calcidius,In Tim.,294,p.296,11–162)The Stoic model is a different one: there is no separation between Godand his product, since Reason works from within Matter. Once Matter isregarded as passive, it detracts somewhat from God’s accomplishment. Heno longer has to labour at world-generation and it becomes an effortlessactivity. This immanence can be regarded as a failure to distinguish betweenGod and Matter: ‘The Stoics believed that God is either matter or is evenan inseparable quality of matter and that he passes through matter justas semen through the genitals’ (Calcidius,In. Tim.294,p.296,19–297.3(=SVF1.87)). The terminology does, however, reveal the influence of thePlatonist demiurgic image. One has to only consider passages such as ‘fire,functioning as a craftsman [technikˆos] proceeds on a course towards genera-tion’ (SVF1.171=DL7.156;cf.SVF2.1027), fire referring to God or nature.Similarly, God is described as ‘producing like a craftsman (δημιουργεῖν)every single thing throughout all matter’ (DL7.134). As Zeno comments:‘whatever in the execution of our craftsmanship is carried out by hand,Nature accomplishes much more skilfully, by the crafting fire, so to speak,the teacher of the remaining crafts’ (SVF1.171=Cicero,NDii.57).The parallel in the Stoic mind between cosmogony and procreation isevident: ‘just as the sperm is contained in the engendering fluid, in such amanner does God, as the generativelogos(reason/forming principle) of thecosmos, remain behind in the moisture making matter easy to work forHim for the subsequent generation’ (DL7.136). An important mediatorbetween the technological and biological images is Aristotle, who referredto the sperm as a craftsman atGA1.22.730b5–32.9He also comparesthe seed to a moving tool which can bring form to matter through itsmotion (though by this Aristotle means the actualisation of a potentiality).Aristotle notes ‘it does not make a difference to say “engendering fluid” or“movement responsible for the growth of each of the parts”. For thelogos(formative principle) of the movement is the same’ (GA4.3.767b18–20).Despite Aristotle’s criticism of the demiurgic model, he everywhere betraysits influence. He distinguishes between Reason and Necessity, as Plato does,and numerous details, such as the diaphragm serving as a partition betweenthe exalted and more degraded parts of the body are clearly drawn from9Todd:1978,144;Hahm:1977,73."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"8Demiurgy and other approaches to world-generationtheTimaeus.10Aristotle comparespneumato a multifunctional instrument(polychreston organon)inGA5, where it is also described as a hammer oranvil.11As Solmsen notes, even in his disagreements with Plato, Aristotlebetrays his influence: Plato asserts atTim.74a7–d2that flesh was producedas a protective covering for bone, whereas Aristotle atPA2.9inverts thisby claiming that bone was designed as a support for flesh.12For Aristotle, there was no need to posit a craftsman who worked uponnature, but rather nature itself was capable of directing itself towards ateleological function: ‘wherever there is an end (telos), the preceeding andsubsequent steps are undertaken for the sake of this end. For just as in(human) undertakings, so too in nature, and as it is in nature, so it is in(human) undertakings, if nothing prevents it. And (human) undertakingsaim at an end and nature too aims at an end’ (Arist.Phys.2.8.199a8ff).Even though there is no need for the image of a Demiurge, nature itself inAristotle’s account is envisaged as working like a craftsman, with analogiesdrawn from a variety of occupations. As Solmsen notes, each of theseanalogies tends to be self-contained; there is no attempt to assemble themwithin a coherent overarching scheme, as Plato does with the Demiurge.To be more accurate, it is not that nature works like a craftsman, but thatcraftsmen imitate nature (as stated atPhys.2.8.199a15ff.)13andalsoatPhys.2.8.199a12ff.: ‘if a house were made by nature, it would come into being asnow it does by craftsmanship and if those things which nature produceswere not generated only by nature, but also by craftsmanship, they wouldbe generated just as they are by nature.’ This does not imply that natureconsiders the ‘end’ of its productions, as Plato’s Demiurge does; the spiderdoes not do so when it weaves a web or the swallow when it builds its nest.14Solmsen sees a further trace of Aristotle’s Academic heritage in his choiceof the termὕληto mean matter, although the term literally means wood,but this is an obvious choice for the material of a craftsman, particularly ifone envisages him as a carpenter fabricating a bed, as Plato does atRep.x.Aristotle applied this conception of nature to his theory of sexual genera-tion. The father does not supply any material content to his offspring; thatis supplied by the mother. The father’s contribution is to shape this material‘just as from the carpenter nothing passes into the timber, his material, andno physical part of the art of carpentry is present in the product, what is10Solmsen:1963cites numerous examples of these similarities: On the distinction between Reasonand Necessity, ‘Nature is in the class of purpose clauses’, Arist.Phys.2.198b10ff.11GA5.8.789b6–1312Solmsen:1963,48613As Solmsen points out (Solmsen:1963,488) a similar attitude is expressed in Democritus68B154.14Solmsen:1963,488"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The theoretical background9due to the carpenter is the shape and form...’ (GA1.22.730b9–15, trans.Solmsen).By using this biological theory, the Stoics can present world-generationin terms of sexual intercourse:Zeus, mindful of Aphrodite and genesis, grew softer and having arrived atthis point and having extinguished much of his light, he turned himselfinto fiery air of a milder fire. And having engaged in intercourse withHera...he ejected the complete engendering fluid of the universe. Andhe made the substance (ousia) wet, a single seed of the universe, runningthrough it himself, just like the moulding and demiurgic breath (pneuma)in the engendering fluid. At this point, he is composed so as to resemblemost closely the other living beings, since he might be accurately said tobe composed of soul and body. He then easily shaped and moulded theremaining things, having poured the smooth and soft substance aroundhimself. (SVF2.622=Dio Chrysost.Or.xxxvi§55)So the Stoics drew not just upon Aristotelian biological theory and thebiological theory of theTimaeus, but also upon the Greek cosmogonicaltradition, to form their cosmobiology. After all, the idea of equating firewithLogoscan be found in Heraclitus. While they reject a demiurgicmodel, the imprint of theTimaeuscan easily be observed. Plato too regardsthe cosmos as a living being. Like Plato, the Stoics also drew a distinctionbetween two cosmic levels. Again, it is problematic to see how one mightdraw such a divide in a pantheistic system, if God is meant to be immanentin all of matter, although the Stoics are able to explain it through parallelismwith the human soul: ‘mind pervades every part of it, just as the soulpervades our bodies. But some parts it pervades to a greater extent andothers less. Some parts it passes through as a ‘hexis’ or bond, just like thebones and sinews and through other parts like mind, just like the commandcentre’ (SVF2.634=DL7.138).This command centre orh ̄egemonikonis the Stoic equivalent of thePlatonic intellect, wherepneuma, used as an equivalent of God orLogosincertain contexts, occurs in such a concentration that it provides the abilityto think.15It therefore exists in the human soul (SVF2.458), meaning thatfor the Stoics, as for Plato, the human soul is a microcosm of the world.The idea of the world being regulated by apneumais clearly influenced bythe notion of the Platonic World-Soul, which is the metaphysical systemPlato posits in theTimaeus, if one decides to demythologise the Demiurge.Zeno drew a distinction between heavenly fire, where he located God (SVF15Lapidge:1973,171"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"10Demiurgy and other approaches to world-generation1.154) and the sublunar realm, and Chrysippus too observed a distinction,even if his pronouncements are a little confusing, locating God both in theaether(SVF2.579) and in the purest part of theaether(SVF2.644), thoughnaturally both of these statements can be regarded as consistent.So the basic Stoic position is that aπῦρ τεχνικόν, a crafting-fire, trans-forms part of itself into water or matter and that subsequently acting uponthis it produces the four elements, and at the end of the cosmic cycle theuniverse dissolves back again into aπῦρ τεχνικόνwhich consumes it. Itis easy to see that such a position creates numerous problems: (1)Howcan fire and water be regarded as principles and subsequently as elements?(2) The Stoic concept ofekpyrosisresolves an issue that Plato had left livein theTimaeus, namely why God should spontaneously decide to generatethe world, by contextualising it as an event within a cosmic cycle, but itdoes not manage to escape from related weaknesses. What does God doin the period betweenekpyrosisand world-generation? (3) From a Platonistperspective, there is a difficulty with God’s immanence in the world andhis operation directly upon matter, without mediation.To be fair, the Stoic system does have the advantage of ensuring that ifProvidence is immanent in the world, the way the cosmos is ordered is thebest sort of arrangement,16(or if one wishes to be pessimistic, it is a matterof indifference, but any other arrangement would equally be a matter ofindifference). Plato, admittedly, regards the Demiurge as producing thebest possible world, but it is a world where the Demiurge is constrained byfactors outside of his control. As Cicero’s Epicurean atDe Natura Deorumi.19comments in a mocking reference to the Platonists, it does appearto be beneath God’s dignity to have to labour at world-generation. TheDemiurge seems to be a particularly unfortunate image, when one of theadvantages of positing a Demiurge in the first place is that it can be usedto avoid placing the First Principle in parts of the cosmos which might beregarded as beneath its dignity to go:For you yourselves are accustomed to say that there is nothing which isimpossible for a god to achieve, and without any labour, just as the limbs ofa man are moved without a struggle by his mind and desire, in this way yousay that the power of the gods can shape and move and change things. Andyou do not say this as a superstition or old wives’ tale, but as a scientific andconsistent account; for the matter of things, from which and in which allthings are, is entirely flexible and changeable, so that there is nothing whichcannot, however suddenly, be formed and changed out of it and the shaper16Long:2010,47"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Christian aspect11and the regulator of this universal material is divine providence, thereforewherever Providence moves it is able to achieve whatever it wishes. (Cicero,ND3.92)The influence of the StoicLogoscan be clearly seen in Philo, Plutarch andOrigen’s conception of the Demiurge (even if in the case of Plutarch it canbe conceived of as a reaction against the Stoics).Additionally, the Demiurge in the first to third centuries is represented asan intermediate entity, midway between matter and the Forms. For Plato,the Demiurge is a paradigm himself, even though he looks to a model.He fashions the cosmos like himself (Tim.29e), and in the procession ofsoulsinthePhaedrus(252d), each soul follows the god who is its paradigm.As Doherty points out, though, there is an ambiguity in Plato concerningwhether the paradigm exists in the mind of the artisan or whether it is anexternal model.17For example, atRep.vi.501b, the legislator uses natureand just men as his models, yet at561e, the democratic man has themodels of different sorts of constitutions within himself. The issue seemsto become more of a problem under Aristotelian influence. For Aristotle,the paradigm referred to theLogosimmanent in the mind of the artisanatPhysics(194b24)andMetaphysics(1013a27).18So irrespective of whetherthe Forms are considered as a separate noetic world, or as the thoughts ofGod (as the Middle Platonists would have it), the Demiurge ‘must possessthem intentionally in order to act efficiently’.19So only once these Formsenter into the mind of the Demiurge can he function as a Demiurge.This aspect of the Demiurge’s activity is illustrated by his contemplationof the Forms, as found, for example, in Numenius. This intermediaterole is relevant in accounting both for the Demiurge’s original activity ofworld-generation (if one posits a temporal creation) and the mechanics ofdemiurgy (the manner in which the Demiurge engages in the continuousordering of matter to ensure the functioning of the world). It is particularlyproblematic for Christian thinkers, who adopt the Demiurge, to explainthe Demiurge’s intermediate status, before the exact position of Christwithin the Trinity had been defined.The Christian aspectAlongside the twin models of demiurgy and biology, Stoicism and Platon-ism both display the attempt to grapple with the issues of God’s transcen-dence or immanence.

This problem perplexed not just Greek philoso-phers, but caused even greater difficulty for Christian thinkers, who arefaced with the Incarnation as a radical divine intervention in the materialrealm. It has still proved difficult to explain Christ’s involvement in creationto the present day: the term ‘cosmic Christ’, which can refer to Christ as an‘instrument in God’s creative activity’ (amongst other meanings), only goesback to the1960s and its antecedents to the1830s.20This belies a historyof attempts to reconcile God’s creative activity with ‘scientific’ theories; theendeavours of Origen to explain it in terms of Greek cosmology can beregarded as the antecedent for the work of the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhardde Chardin, who similarly sought to develop a Christology which wouldtake account of contemporary cosmological views.21(The comparison ismade more poignant by the hostility which they both faced within theChurch, as well as the attempts to suppress their work.)The Christians are further forced to explain Jesus’ relationship to God.Did he remain God, but simply appear human (Docetism), in whichcase he never suffered, but only appeared to, undermining the nature of hissacrifice and denying his humanity? Perhaps he was just a man (Ebionitism),although one can claim that he was adopted by God during his baptismat the Jordan?22Here one either denies Christ’s divinity or if one regardshis divinity as accorded by God through Adoptionism, it means that Jesuswas not divine by nature. If there is an advantage to asserting that Jesusis either a man or God (but not both), it is that it allows his nature to beexplained without having recourse to metaphysics.23It is easy to see why Christians might not be keen to embrace eitherposition. Jesus’ humanity and divinity are both core Christian beliefs,stressed in the New Testament writers, and to emphasise either one at theexpense of the other seems to undermine Biblical authority. If Jesus is trulyregarded as the Son of God (rather than interpreting this as a title), the Sonmust have existed before the Incarnation (since Christians, amongst others,20Lyons:1982,121Lyons:1982,522By regarding Jesus as adopted as lord of the angels, the Ebionites clearly regard Jesus as more thanan ordinary man, although the term Ebionitism is probably applied in Christological discourse inan historically inaccurate sense, which also implies that they had no metaphysical ideas.Cf.Spence:2008,11–12.23Spence:2008,12"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Christian aspect13believe in the immutability of God).24This difficulty explains the appealof a figure such as the Demiurge, particularly once Justin Martyr identifiedthe Son with theLogosof God, a concept already existing in Jewish thought.Such an identification has numerous advantages. TheLogos, according toJustin, had revealed the nature of God to pagan thinkers (to a limitedextent) in the past and by becoming Incarnate, had made him known tothose who embraced Christianity. It explained both the pre-existence ofthe Son and how the Son could be related to the godhead and yet preservemonotheism. Just as when someone utters a word, it can be viewed ashaving a separate existence and yet remaining part of him, the same is thecase with the Word of God. The Hebrew term isdabar, meaning both‘word’ and ‘deed’ – this allows both concepts to be more firmly united:25God revealed himself through his Word, but also his act (the Incarnation).However, such an identification can be regarded as creating problemsof its own: ‘it gave metaphysical significance to an historical faith, it drewinto the domain of cosmology and religious philosophy a person who hadappearedintimeandspace...Mostofusregardthisidentificationasinad-missible, because the way in which we perceive the world and ethics doesnot point to the existence of anylogosat all.’26Spence essentially refers to asimilar problem when he comments in reference to Christians worshippingboth one God and an historical figure that ‘most Jews and Muslims regardsuch devotion to an historical person as both absurd and impious, if notblasphemous. Christians seem generally far less conscious of just how oddor paradoxical their religion looks from the outside.’27(Christians can, ofcourse, turn this to their advantage. TheLogoswas involved in the materialrealm during creation and in making God known, to a limited extent, tothe Jews and pagans before Christ. The Incarnation becomes just a con-tinuation of this divine activity, rather than a manifestation of the divinenature’s alteration.)Once such an identification is made, theories concerning Christ need toexplore metaphysical options. It also means that the figure of the Demiurgewas of interest to those attempting to explain Christ’s interaction on theworld. Since Philo had already posited theLogosas a mediating instru-ment, drawing upon Jewish thought, as well as the Stoic concept of thelogos spermatikosand the Platonic Demiurge, there was already a basis forexplaining Christ’s activity in terms of a secondary, mediating entity, oncethe Son andLogoshad been identified (as in Origen’s Son-Logos). This24Actually Tertullian avoids this when he states ‘God can change into all things and still remain as heis’ (De Carne Christi3.4–6).25Smulders:1968,826von Harnack:1900,12827Spence:2008,3"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"14Demiurgy and other approaches to world-generationalso allowed Christian thinkers to draw upon Platonic formulations forpreserving God’s transcendence, while explaining his interaction on theworld (through the form of divine mediators).There is of course an overlap in methodology between the approachesof those operating within a Biblical tradition, such as Philo and Origen,and pagans such as Numenius. Philo with his theories concerning Godand theLogos, Origen with hisepinoiaiand Numenius in his doctrineof three gods posit modes of divinity; the positing of hypostases was animportant technique during the first to third centuries.28In many ways, it isa natural mechanism for preserving divine transcendence while explainingdemiurgic activity upon matter. This modalistic approach allows greatercohesion: as Numenius puts it ‘all is in all, but in each appropriately toits nature.’29As Kenny notes, this ‘telescoping’ of metaphysical levels intoeach other, coupled with the connections posited between them helps tomaintain the relationship between them.30This technique has obviousutilty for those committed to a monotheistic world-view and explains itspopularity amongst those of a Jewish or Christian background. Ratherthan each mode representing a separate god, it can be used as a mechanismto distinguish between degrees of divinity.31Obviously, in Gnosticism, theopposite tendency prevails and the Demiurge is completely separated fromthe godhead.Thinkers investigated and criteria for selectionIn tracing the development of this concept, my aim has been to considerthinkers from a range of traditions who taken as a group illustrate the varietyof speculations on world-generation underpinned by theTimaeus.Thisexplains the perhaps surprising inclusion of Maximus of Tyre. Althoughhe deals with the topic in a superficial manner, he does provide goodevidence for the understanding of demiurgy in Middle Platonism. TheChaldean Oracles, though replete with a satisfying, complex system ofdivine mediators, such as Teletarchs, Connectors and Iynges, have notbeen included, precisely because, although figures such as Porphyry orDamascius regarded them as carrying the same authority as Plato’sTimaeus,their significance is felt to a greater extent on these later Neoplatoniststhan upon the period in question, contrasting with the situation regardingGnosticism.28Kenny:1991,58ff.29Fr.41, trans.

Secondly, while the tortuousontological scheme parallels the same phenomenon in Gnosticism, thesedivine mediators are evocative of the Platonic world of the Forms. Forexample, the Iynges resemble the thoughts of God. Despite the pointsof Middle Platonist re-evaluation of Plato’s metaphysics illustrated by theChaldean Oracles, it has seemed preferable to focus rather on the Gnosticand Hermetic traditions.A further investigation on the influence of theTimaeusupon Philoafter Runia’s magisterial monograph might seem to require justification.However, an analysis of the development of the demiurgic concept inMiddle Platonism could not be said to be complete without an analysisof the originality (or lack thereof ) of Philo’s contribution. This is moreevidently the case in a study of demiurgy in the Christian, Gnostic andHermetic traditions, since Philo can to a certain extent be viewed as a linkbetween these ‘Biblical’ or ‘pseudo-Biblical’ traditions and mainstreamGreek philosophy. Philo is treated in his chronological position, whichhas resulted in him being somewhat separated from other interpreters ofGenesis, but also helps to highlight his somewhat unusual position and therather strange circumstance that the first witness to the notion of demiurgyin later Platonism is not, strictly speaking, a Platonist at all.It might be felt (and with a certain degree of reason, I might add) that notenough attention has been paid to the role of soul in world-generation andits interaction with the sensible realm.32Such a topic would be extensiveenough to form the basis for a monograph in its own right. Although theDemiurge does produce (or distills) soul and then inserts it into matter(assuming that one accepts the demiurgic myth), Plato never concernshimself excessively with the interaction of soul upon matter. Although soulis assigned a central role inLawsx, a detailed account of the manner inwhich it fulfilfs its functions is not supplied. It has also been less of concernamongst the thinkers assembled here, though Origen does consider thematter and Plutarch in theDe Iside et Osirideappears to touch upon it.In my defence, I have focused upon the issues which most exercised theinterest of ‘the heirs of Plato’, to borrow Dillon’s phrase, which I examinehere: issues such as the causality of the Demiurge and the functioning ofsecondary gods and divine mediators within their metaphysical systems.32For the development of the doctrine of soul in the Platonic tradition, see Dillon and El-Kaisy-Friemuth:2009, Deuse:1985and D ̈orrie and Baltes:1998."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"16Demiurgy and other approaches to world-generationOn the issue of soul, Plato was more concerned with the role it played inrelation to Time and Eternity than upon matter, but this issue is largelyignored by the Middle Platonist period, although it did influence theNeoplatonic theory of soul.I have identified the following main areas where the influence of theDemiurge of theTimaeusmay be most strongly discerned: (1) the relationof the Demiurge to the First Principle, (2) the actual causality of theDemiurge and his interaction with matter, (3) the ontological status of theForms, (4) the question of the origin of evil and (5) other factors whichlimit the influence of the Demiurge (such as Providence, Necessity orother entities). However, it is not always practical to deal with each of theseaspects in the precise order outlined above.Indeed, this schema is perhaps somewhat misleading since it implies adegree of systematisation in theorising about the Demiurge, which couldnot be said to be present in each of the instances examined. Most notablein this regard are the Gnostic and Hermetic traditions, inclusion of whichrequires some justification, since it would seem to stray beyond the bound-aries of philosophy or classical philology into the realm of heresiology orcomparative religion. However, the increase of our knowledge of Gnosti-cism and Hermetism has been one of the most exciting twentieth-centurydevelopments in this area. While the Nag Hammadi Library was discov-ered in1945, it was only as recently as1977that publication commenced.EventhegreatworksofFestugi`ere (1950) and Jonas (1958and1963)wereunable to wholly take into account the Nag Hammadi corpus, and it hasfallen to a new generation of Gnostic scholars to consider the full impactof these works. Indeed, academic prejudice and a quasi-religious disdainfor ‘heretical’ texts considerably undermined research into this area andthe only thoroughly ‘modern’ studies of Gnosticism with implicationsfor Platonism have been P ́etrement’sA Separate God(1991)33and the1997study edited by Van den Broek and Hanagraaf:Gnosis and Hermetism–From Antiquity until Modern Times.Bentley Layton and John Turnerhave not only been important commentators, contextualising the Gnosticphenomenon within its intellectual milieu, but have also played a majorrole in making these texts available; one has only to think of Layton’sThe Gnostic Scriptures(1987) or Turner’s valuable translations and com-mentaries forThe Nag Hammadi Library in English(1977)orThe CopticGnostic Library(1990).3433The original French study was published in1984.34Turner’s translations and commentaries includeThe Book of Thomas the Contender, the Interpretationof Knowledge, A Valentinian Exposition, Allogenes, HypsiphroneandThe Trimorphic Protennoia,in"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Thinkers investigated and criteria for selection17The same phenomenon can be observed with theCorpus Hermeticum,which dropped out of the ambit of classical scholarship after Casaubondiscovered that it was not as old as it claimed to be.

To a certainextent, justifying the Gnostic and Hermetic traditions as a serious subjectof academic study would appear to be a moot point after John Dillon’sTheMiddle Platonists(1977), which rehabilitated the ‘Platonic Underworld’,the intellectual milieu of several Gnostic thinkers, as a legitimate subjectfor research.

Not only can one observe an attempt in subsequentthinkers to explain or to resolve the philosophical issues raised by thedialogue, which can occasionally sit uncomfortably with the desire toreconcile it with a particular tradition or allegiance; one also observes theemergence of certain trends throughout its progression. The separation ofthe demiurgic function from the role of the highest principle, beginningwith Numenius (although it can be traced right back to the Young Godsof theTimaeus), leads to the emergence of an increasingly elaborate chainof entities insulating the highest principle from the Demiurge. In a sense,both the Christian tradition and Platonism bring this development to anend. For Christianity, multiple creators could easily be accommodated bythe framework of the Trinity (although careless formulations can seem toundermine the role of the Father as final cause), while the Neoplatonistnotion of automatic emanation by the One effectively broke away fromthe concept of the Demiurge as the primary agent of world-generationaltogether.The Nag Hammadi Library in English;third completely revised edition, ed.

This anecdote illustrates the regard in which theTimaeuswasheldinantiquity−although non-Platonists regarded it as ‘worthless’,they still saw it as important enough to attack). Even at the height of theRenaissance, Raphael could envisage Plato inThe School of Athens, carryingthe ‘Timeo’ under his arm and pointing with his upraised index-finger tothe sky, indicating his contribution to metaphysics.To a certain extent, theTimaeushad a disproportionate influence uponsubsequent Platonism, partly due to the perception that it was Plato’s only‘physical’ dialogue, but more importantly because in the medieval period(until the thirteenth century) the tenets of Plato were known, mainly froma Latin version of the first two-thirds of the dialogue by Calcidius and theConsolatioof Boethius, as well as an exegesis of Cicero’sSomnium Scipi-onisby Macrobius, both of which drew heavily upon theTimaeus.TheNeoplatonists regarded it as one of only two perfect dialogues:1perfectbecause it dealt with the highest aspects of metaphysics. Perhaps the onlyindividual of note to dispute the authenticity of the work was the Germanphilosopher Schelling, inPhilosophie und Religion(Werke v. 36), because hedisliked its dualism. However, Schelling later recanted his ‘heresy’ (Werkevii 37i) in deference to Boeckh.2In spite of this, comparatively little waspublished on theTimaeusin the early twentieth century. The most notableexceptions were the commentaries by A. E. Taylor (1928) and F. M.

At Athens, the craftsman was either a slave or iffree, one who acquired a certain stigma as a result of his proximity toslaves. Plato himself excludes thedˆemiourgosfrom political participation(Republic) and citizenship (Laws) as does Aristotle (Politics). Vlastos rightlycalls this terminology the ‘triumph of the philosophical imagination overingrained social prejudice’.4He views thedˆemiourgosas the stereotypicalPlatonic artist imposing pre-existing form on matter, not inventing newform.The dialogue first uses the termdˆemiourgos(‘Craftsman’) at28a6,although there it seems to me that it does not signify ‘the Demiurge’in a specialised sense, but rather a generic craftsman, or as Cornford soaccurately translates ‘the maker of anything’. Admittedly, Plato has previ-ously useddˆemiourgosto represent the God (Rep.vii.530aandSoph.265b),but there the context was different.

Other key components of theTimaeuswhichbecame important subsequently in delineating the concept of the Demiurgeare the arrangement of the four elements in the cosmos by the Demiurge(32d), the guarantee of an everlasting world (41b), the Demiurge’s del-egation of responsibility to the Young Gods at42d and the secondaryproduction on the part of the Young Gods at43a. Also important for sub-sequent Platonists is the discussion of Necessity (47e–53c),aswellasthePlatonic notion of space (the Receptacle) at49b. The relevant section oftheTimaeusends at57c–e with the generation of unmixed and primarybodies, while the dialogue then turns to deal with other physical matters,most notably the mechanisms by which the senses function.There are two principal issues concerning any discussion of the Demi-urge: the activity which is attributed to him by Plato on a literal reading andif the literal reading is denied, how the myth can be interpreted allegorically.Even a literal account of the Demiurge’s activity is relatively complex. Facedwith precosmic chaos, the Demiurge harmonises the four elements, usingwater and air as intermediate terms between fire and earth.6This harmon-ising by proportion (δι’ἀναλογίας ὁμολογῆσαν) is what brings the cosmosinto existence, and the Demiurge shapes the cosmos into a sphere7and givesit circular motion.8To construct the soul (a prior activity, but recountedsubsequently and with due apologies by Timaeus), the Demiurge producesthree essences – Being, Sameness and Otherness.9The Demiurge cuts off5‘But, as I said a little while ago, a single explanation remains, that the cosmos is conducted by anexternal and divine cause and obtaining life once again, it receives from the Demiurge (παρὰ τοῦδημιουργοῦ) restored immortality and it remains by itself at another times and it moves by itself andduring the period when it has been left to itself, it travels back again through a countless number ofrevolutions, because although it is extensive it revolves in a most balanced manner upon a very smallaxis.’6Tim.32c7Tim.33c8Tim.34c9Tim.35b.

These portions are laid into two strips, the circles of the Same andthe Different, which are bent into a cross, and then inserted or wrappedaround the body of the world, woven throughout the entire heaven.10TheDemiurge then organises the orbit of the planets and produces the YoungGods, to whom he delegates responsibility for the generation of the mortalgeneraand the lower soul. The mathematical aspect of the account, with itsemphasis on intervals of3:2;4:3and9:8, which have to be filled with stripsof soul-stuff, and its correspondence with a musical scale of four octavesand a major ‘sixth’ makes even a literal reading elaborate.In contrast to the Empedoclean entities, Love and Strife, which areresponsible for the production of the world, or the ordering, divine mindof Anaxagoras, Plato introduces a different type of cosmology. It is notas if the Demiurge can claim credit for all order, since even some sort oforder (ἴχνη, traces) existed in the precosmos. The Demiurge only ordersin a manner which furthers his objective: increased intelligibility, seen, forexample, in his formation of the elements, ordered on geometric principles.The Demiurge’s ordering activity is founded on a basis of rationality, whichthe sporadic traces of order in the precosmic state lacked.AtTim.48e, Plato turns to an examination of cosmology from below,and introduces Necessity (Plato’s erratic cause,ἡ πλανωμένη αἰτία). Healso introduces the Receptacle (ὑποδοχή) which he calls mother (μήτηρ)or nurse and additionally refers to it as space (χώρα)orplace(τόπος).Plato’s errant cause is a thorn in the side of the Demiurge; for example,he would prefer that humans could live longer and be intelligent, butwhen presented with a choice, he opts for intelligence over longevity.11This positing of Necessity helps to explain the imperfections of the cosmosand can be seen as an attempt to address the problem of evil, as well asa forerunner of the subsequent notion of the recalcitrance of matter. Asfor Plato’s Receptacle, it becomes interpreted asὕλη‘matter’, with thebeginning of a distinction between matter and space.What is the precise nature of the relationship between the Demiurge andthe Forms? Furthermore of what types of things do Forms exist? From theTimaeus, it would appear that the noetic realm contains (περιέχον31a4,10Τim.36a–e11At75b, the Demiurge is forced to choose between giving man a head composed of dense bone or alighter skull.

Ostenfeld suggests that the Demiurgemay be an all-embracing Form containing the various sub-Forms.12Isthis sufficient to identify the Demiurge with the Form of the Good (as aSupreme Principle)?13I think not, although in defence of this position, onemight citeTim.37a1: ‘(the Demiurge) is the best of the intelligible andeternal things’ orTim.29e: ‘He was good and...he wanted everythingto be most like himself’ or the reference to the Forms as gods at37c6.Plato, though, is quite specific in referring to the Demiurge as good, buthe does not call him ‘the Good’. Furthermore, as Ostenfeld points out,Plato never mentions the Form of the Good in theTimaeus,althoughhe acknowledges the possibility at46c8.14In addition, the Good of theRepublicis not a creative intelligence, so would it really be legitimate toequate the Demiurge with it?15In any case, if the Demiurge is to be regardedas an Intellect and the Forms are contemplated by Intellect, it would seemto be an unlikely conclusion.Ostenfeld rejects the notion that the Forms in theTimaeusshould beequated with the thoughts of God.16This to my mind is quite right, sincethis doctrine is most likely a Middle Platonist refinement. The Forms arenot in anything else (Tim.52a) and they are apart from sense-perception(Crat.386e). This leads to the problem of how they can interact uponmatter and suggests that they function as some sort of mathematical ratio.The introduction of the concept that the Forms were the thoughts ofGod not only resolved this problem, it reduced the number of principlesfrom three to two. For Plato, the Form-sensible interaction is resolved by a‘model–copy’ relationship, though he does acknowledge the difficulty whenhe states that sensibles ‘partake’ in some very puzzling way (ἀπορώτατὰπῃ) of the intelligible and are very difficult to apprehend (Tim.51a7–b1).The alternative explanation is that the Demiurge is only an allegoricalfigure. Plato’s account illustrates the importance of a rational element inthe continual ordering of the universe and the myth can be deconstructedto produce a number of important philosophical insights: (1) The createdrealm is dependent upon a higher one, which it instantiates in a limitedand approximate way. (2) The higher realm contains ‘the beautiful model’according to which the world has been ordered. (3) The world is imperfect,not as the result of any malevolent, supernatural or divine being, but12Ostenfeld:1997,17013As was done by Wilamowitz and De Vogel.

It does not even exist, but is always in a state of‘coming-to-be’. The changes and vicissitudes are due to the errant cause(Necessity), which has to be eternally ordered by Reason.This leaves two main problems. Firstly, how are the Forms to be inter-preted in this demythologised scheme? Secondly, there would then be noexplanation for how the Forms come to affect matter. (One could arguethat Plato does not achieve this on the metaphysical level, though he maydo so on the mythological one.) Clearly, if there is no temporal creation,then there can never have been a stage when the Demiurge engaged in theactivity envisaged in theTimaeus. The standard interpretation has been toassert that Plato is merely presenting an image of what the cosmos wouldbe like if it were devoid of the influence of Reason. What is important isthat it is not a mere mechanistic principle; Plato is reacting against earlierphilosophers, whom he had criticised for not explaining the causality of thephysical processes which they posited to explain world-generation (Phaedo96aff.).How, then, can the Demiurge be interpreted? He is envisaged as theartificer of the World-Soul, but since this stage hardly took place andthe functions which would be left for the Demiurge to engage in, if thegenerative process is discounted, are those of the World-Soul, one canenvisage a situation where Plato’s metaphysics could, in fact, have norequirement for a Demiurge and the task of functioning as a conduitbetween the suprasensible and material realms is effectively carried out bythe World-Soul. In thePhaedrus, the soul is the source of all motion and inBookxof theLaws, regulation of the cosmos is carried out by the rationalWorld-Soul, therefore this would appear to be a logical interpretation (ifnotthelogical interpretation) of theTimaeusmyth. The Demiurge is nomore than the ‘Cause of the Mixture’ (Phileb.23dff.).The dramatic setting of the dialogue the day after a discussion similarto that of theRepublictook place, a discussion which dealt with the searchfor justice in the city and individual soul and which is summarised in theopening of theTimaeus(17a–20c) helps to reinforce the notion that thework deals with the continued regulation and governance of the cosmos,rather than with once-off generation. This political notion is enhancedby Plato’s choice of the title ‘Demiurge’, which denotes not merely aCraftsman, but in certain Peloponnesian contexts means ‘magistrate’.1717As used at Thuc.5.47,Epist.

The Greeks did not mention the idea ofcreatio exnihilo, even satirically. The Demiurge moulds the world using geometricpatterns; with the isosceles triangle he forms a cube, which becomes theatom of earth and out of the scalene triangle, he fashions the tetrahedron(fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and he also produces thedodecahedron used to adorn the universe (Tim.55c4–6), which is lateridentified asaetherby Xenocrates.19This positing of a fifth element mayresult from the non-interchangeability of the triangles used to form thedodecahedron with those which compose fire, water and air, and is justone of a number of problems which Plato, in the myth of the Demiurge,bequeaths to his successors.Aristotle and the Old AcademyThe bulk of Plato’s immediate successors, whom we might imagine tobe in a better position to know the views of the master, saw the mythas allegorical and as a feature of Plato’s paideutic method. In fact, theprincipal philosopher in the generation after Plato to argue for a literalinterpretation was Aristotle, and he does this primarily for the purposes ofpolemic, exploiting what he feels to be one of Plato’s less readily defensi-ble positions.

Most notably in thisregard, one may citeDe Caeloi.10.279b.17–31, where Aristotle, criticisingPlato’s position that the universe can be both ‘generated’ and everlasting,completely ignores the Demiurge. Aristotle also accuses Plato of not recog-nising the efficient cause, which would be one possible interpretation of theDemiurge.21Aristotle criticises Plato for suggesting that Forms (consideredas Numbers) could be responsible for perceptible objects.22AtMetaphysics1091b, Aristotle criticises the view expressed throughout theTimaeus,thatmathematical structure is necessary to make anything good.Plato’s other students do not seem to have much use for the Demiurgeeither. Philip of Opus (in theEpinomis) and Polemon seem to have inter-preted him as a rational World-Soul. The second head of the Academy,Plato’s nephew, Speusippus and his successor as scholarch, Xenocrates,proceeded to deconstruct the myth of the Demiurge, when faced withAristotelian criticism. A good deal of Speusippus’ doctrines can be gleanedfrom Aristotle’s criticism of them as well as from (possible) fragments pre-served by Iamblichus inDe Communi Mathematica Scientia.23Speusippusregarded everything as the derivation of two principles: a One and anIndefinite Dyad (which he called multiplicity,plˆethos).24He gets himselfinto considerable trouble, however, in his attempt to explain the existenceof the variety of created being from only two principles. To counter this, heclaims that the One imposes form on the Dyad in order to produce Num-ber, which then, acting as a principle itself, imposes its own form on matterto produce the next level of being, and so on. Speusippus’ situation wasnot helped by his decision to jettison or ‘modify’ the Theory of Forms.25The great difficulty with this theory lies in defining the sorts of things ofwhich Forms exist. For Speusippus, Forms were only capable of manifest-ing themselves in the World-Soul, but not at any higher level.26Essentially,as a result of his attempts to break down this mythological framework, all20The doctrine of temporal creation is notoriously difficult to defend within the context of Greekphilosophy. The idea that God would suddenly create at a point in time raises the question of whathe has been doing previously.21AtMetaphysicsi.6.988a8–16, Aristotle claims that Plato only recognises the formal and the materialcauses.22E.g. atMetaphysics I.9(991b9ff.). Johansen:2010treats this issue in detail.23This is based on a suggestion by Philip Merlan concerning the origin of chapter4of Iamblichus,though the view is opposed by Tar ́an:1982.24Dillon:2003a,4025Aristotle testifies to this atMet.M9,1085b36ff.(=Fr.35Ta r ́an).

He may havebeen reacting in response to Speusippus’ innovations, as well as Aristotle’sattacks, and attempting to return to what he viewed as the ‘original’ doctrineof Plato. Essentially, he too regarded the myth of the Demiurge as merelyintroduced ‘for the purposes of exposition’ and regarded the World-Soul asthe product of his two principles: a Monad and Dyad. He also modified theTheory of Forms, equating them with Numbers. Unfortunately, the loss ofall his works limits our knowledge of his doctrines, although informationcan be gleaned from Aristotle (particularly hisMetaphysics), as well as fromtheMetaphysics of Theophrastus and the writings of Plutarch.The need to demarcate more strongly the First Principle from the demi-urgic one was influenced by the Aristotelian concept of an Intellect (Nous)as the First Principle, but characterised as a self-thinking unmoved mover,whose sole ‘inner life’ consists of contemplating itself, which prevents itfrom intervening in the world. Speusippus, to be sure, resisted this. How-ever, Xenocrates did adopt such a conception and he, unlike Speusippus,had much greater influence upon the course of Middle Platonism. Aristotlecriticised the description of the rotational movement of the heavens atDeAnima407a.22–34; since he interprets this revolution to be identical withMind (407a.19–22) the same revolution reoccurring implies that Mind iscontinuously thinking the same thing (and thought has a purpose, so itshould not be circular). Furthermore, thought is more similar to a state ofcoming to rest than movement (cf. Physics247b.10–11).27Since Xenocrates regarded the First Principle as an Intellect, this couldbe combined with the Aristotelian notion of a more ‘passive’ intellect.28Xenocrates envisages Intellect as actively concerned with the world ashe regards it as containing the form-numbers. Evidence for this can beadduced from the comments of the Sicilian Alcimus: ‘Each of the Forms iseternal and intelligible and not susceptible to change.’29This testimony canbe taken as accurate; Alcimus was a contemporary and had no particularreason to distort the truth in this case. The only intellect which could thinkForms in an unchanging and eternal manner is that of God. These Formsare then projected onto the World-Soul. One might cite in this context27Cherniss:1944,39428Imeanpassivehere in the sense of not engaging in discursive thinking or becoming involved withthe cosmos.29ἔστι δὲ τῶν εἰδῶν ἓν ἕκαστον ἀίδιόν τε καὶ νόημα καὶ πρὸς τούτοις ἀπαθές, ap.

This entity ‘has the ontologicalcapacity of creating individuals, of separating them from one another, andof grouping them in genera and species, as well as the epistemologicalcapacity of identifying them and distinguishing between them.’30Evidently, this is a deconstruction of the myth of the Demiurge, with theMonad and Dyad producing Number and Soul, and with Soul carrying outthe Demiurge’s activities with regard to the physical realm. By conceding(to some extent) to the Aristotelian conception of Intellect, Xenocratescan be viewed as beginning the trend observable in Middle Platonism toassign demiurgic functions to a sub-noetic level, a stance which led to theconvergence in later Platonism of the First Principle with the UnmovedMover of Aristotle’sMetaphysicsxii.Interpretations of theTimaeus: first to third centuriesADPerhaps surprisingly, despite the heated debate amongst Platonists in gen-eral concerning the status of the demiurgic myth, this does not seem tohave been an issue with the philosophers and traditions investigated herefrom the first to third centuriesad. Plutarch, for example, was prepared toaccept that a literal interpretation had been intended by Plato, a position headopts principally for his own purposes. After all, he viewed the myths ofother cultures as revealing the truths of Greek philosophy; an interest whichprompted hisDe Iside et Osiride. Philo and Origen were less concerned withexposing the Demiurge as a myth than with drawing upon the imagery itpresented as a means for expounding Biblical truth and reconciling it withGreek philosophy (or Greek philosophy with it, depending upon one’sposition). Gnosticism and Hermetism both regarded the Demiurge as areal figure and, given what we know of both these traditions, were unlikelyto be perplexed by the mythological context in which he is introduced.The same could be said for Numenius, for whom the Demiurge formsan important component of his metaphysics. Maximus of Tyre, for hispart, seems to have seen no pressing need to investigate the matter in whatwas intended as an introductory series of lectures to Plato. If the status ofthe demiurgic myth could be shelved by Plato’s less immediate interpreters,30Dillon:2003a,122"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"28The original concept of the Demiurgethe same did not apply for the status of the Demiurge himself. ThoughJonas31has warned against the ‘conveyor-belt’ approach to Gnosticism, theDemiurge’s status could be viewed as one of continual ontological decline(although to a certain degree such a view is rather na ̈ıve and simplistic:Philo, after all, did raise the status of the Creator by making him anarchitect, rather than a craftsman).If the demiurgic myth was accepted as literal by thinkers from a widerange of traditions by the first century, the Demiurge himself took onan existence autonomous to that of theTimaeus, although several of themodifications envisaged subsequently can be traced to comments madeby Plato in that dialogue. While the exact process used by the Demiurgedoes not seem to have been particularly important to some of Plato’sheirs (Maximus of Tyre in particular springs to mind), two elements ofthis account were. Firstly, the notion that the world is generated alongrational (i.e. mathematical) lines and secondly the Demiurge’s delegationto the Young Gods of the production of the mortal elements and the lowersoul leads to the development of various intermediary demiurgic figuresin subsequent traditions, or even more strikingly the actual demotion ofthe Demiurge himself. The antagonism between the Demiurge and theFirst Principle in Gnosticism can be seen to result, in part, from Plato’sdistinction between the Form of Good and the Demiurge, or perhapsmore accurately expressed, it was the possibility of using material from theTimaeusto expound (whether metaphysically or mythologically) dualistictendencies that underpinned the widespread use of the demiurgic figure.What in theTimaeus, if anything, suggests a hierarchy of levels of being?What is primarily suggested are two worlds, or metaphysical realms, thatof Being and of Becoming. A hierarchy amongst suprasensible entities issuggested by the distinction between the Demiurge and the Young Gods;he is immortal, while they are merely everlasting at his pleasure. What heproduces will not be dissolved, unlike the Young Gods, who produce themortal component of man. This further suggests that world-generationis the result of collaboration between entities at various ontological lev-els, with very strictly delineated roles, an interpretation drawn upon byGnosticism, but also by the PhilonicLogos-Cutter. The distinction in thequality of the production of the Demiurge and the Young Gods stresses thehierarchy, as well as the ambivalent nature of man as an intermediary beingcontaining elements with two ontological ranks (soul and body). ThoughPlato does not envisage it in these terms, it can be seen as the ancestor of31Jonas:1963and1967"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Interpretations of theTimaeus29the belief in a higher divine element in man, which has become entrappedin matter.Another important passage for subsequent philosophers is27d4–28b2,where Plato outlines the fundamental principles which underpin theTimaeus,while28b2–29a3applies them to the cosmos.32This results inthree conclusions: (1) the cosmos has been produced, (2)ithasacause,theprecise nature of which is difficult to explain and (3) the maker modelled itfollowing an eternal model. The gaze of the Demiurge is fixed on the Eter-nal (29a4), but he himself does not appear to produce this model, leadingto the ambiguity concerning his relationship to the Forms. Such ambiguityprovided fertile ground for Middle Platonist speculations regarding Godand the Forms. The Middle Platonist response, positing the Forms as thecontents of the divine Mind is the most economical clarification of theirrelationship (as it reduces the number of Principles posited). Numenius alsoattempts to resolve this situation by effectively expanding the suprasensiblerealm, explaining the Demiurge’s ancestry.When Timaeus states at28c that to find the father and maker of all menis difficult and, when he is found, that to reveal him to all is impossible, heis referring to the limits of human knowledge and Plato’s awareness thatthis is just a ‘likely story’, to account for appearances, the most up-to-datescientific research of the day, though Plato himself knows that this will besuperseded at some point in the future. This was adopted by Plutarch andMaximus of Tyre as a convenient response to evade a detailed discussionof certain (technical) aspects of demiurgy, when it no longer suited them.It is worth pointing out, in this context, the philosophical tradition ofexpressing an awareness of the limits of human knowledge; it suffices tocite Alcmaeon DK24B1(=DLviii83): ‘Concerning what is unclear andconcerning what is mortal, the gods have clarity, but it is necessary forhumans to make educated guesses’ and Metrodorus of Chios DK70B1(=Cic.Acad.2.73): ‘none of us knows anything, not even whether we knowor do not know, nor even what it is not to know or to know, or indeedwhether anything is or is not.’33It is well known that Plato’s myth regards the Demiurge as imposingorder upon disorder, a position shared by Maximus and Plutarch, thoughdisputed by the Gnostic and Hermetic traditions. But what exactly is thisorder and how might it be viewed as an improvement? The Demiurge’swork can be seen in terms of an improvement of the world’s intelligibility;32Runia:1997,10233nego, inquit, scire nos sciamusne aliquid an nihil sciamus, ne id ipsum quidem nescire (aut scire),scire nos, nec omnino sitne aliquid an nihil sit."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"30The original concept of the Demiurgecreating immanent standards (39e3–4) as a reflection of the standards of thephenomenal realm.

This is the real reason why (forPlato), the Demiurge improves matter, since it has heightened intelligibility(by being ordered as the sensible realm), rather than by imposing order.Reale counters the view that the Demiurge replicates irrelevant featuresof his model in his ordering of only one cosmos, and regards this as anactualisation of ‘true measure’.35For Reale, producing only one universeand generating time as an image of the unit of eternity are both mechanismsby which the Demiurge unifies reality.However, this is a feature not seized upon by the thinkers consid-ered here – all of them tend to view creation or demiurgy in terms ofthis order/disorder framework. While Middle Platonists (including in thisinstance Philo under this label) tend to regard the Demiurge as responsiblefor order; the main objection that Gnostics tend to have against him is thathe is responsible in some way for the breakdown of the natural ontologicalorder by either entrapping Man (as a fragmented and enmattered part ofthe godhead) or through his ignorance of this order in his assumption thathe is the highest principle.Another hangover from Plato’sTimaeusis the hierarchy of divinities. Isthe Demiurge identical with the Idea of the Good? The Demiurge of theTimaeusnever creates the Forms; rather the soul and theκόσμος αἰσθητός.In theRepublic, for example, God is the creator (φυτουργός)oftheIdeaof the Bed, meaning that the Demiurge could in no way be identical withthe principle of the One and the Good, although thisRepublicreferenceis not particularly helpful in determining the precise ontological statusof the Demiurge, since the metaphysical value of the Idea of the Bedmust surely differ from abstract ideas such as Justice or Beauty (or moreimportantly the Good).36Halfwassen points out that since the Demiurgeis Mind atTim.36d8, and the highest principle must be beyond Mind(on account of its transcendence), this indicates that a Craftsman-godcould not be identical with a First Principle, which is above both Beingand Mind. Halfwassen also raises the point that the Demiurge could beidentical with the totality of the Forms; if these are the thoughts of God in34Mohr:1989,30135Reale:1997,16136Halfwassen:2000,49"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Interpretations of theTimaeus31Middle Platonism, then this would certainly be the case.

This perception forms the basis of thedualistic attitudes of Middle Platonism exemplified by Plutarch (especiallywith the disappearance of the Forms as a principle in their own right).A further contribution of theTimaeushas been to our conceptualisa-tion of Time. Plato regards Time as coming into being with the universe,although since he dismissed precosmic events, this indicates that he neverenvisaged a period when the generated world did not exist (although evi-dently Plato never claims that the Demiurge introduced temporal succes-sion to the world). Time for Plato refers to the celestial motions by which wecan measure time. I introduce this point here because it raises the questionof why the Demiurge should choose to create at a particular point. Platocommentsκαὶ ὁ μὲν δὴ ἅπαντα ταῦτα διατάξας ἔμενεν ἐν τῷ ἑαυτοῦκατὰ τρόπον ἤθει‘and having arranged all these things he duly remainedin his habitual state’ (Tim.42e), which makes world-generation appear alittle arbitrary. One can sidestep the issue if, like Proclus, one claims thatfor the Demiurge to always maintain a constant state in relation to theworld, he must always generate.This is precisely the position adopted by subsequent philosophers; exem-plified equally by Philo and Origen’s views concerning continual temporalcreation and Origen’s location of the Ideal realm of the Forms within theSon-Logos, as well as Plutarch’s assertion that the Demiurge is continuallyengaged in geometry. In the Gnostic and Hermetic traditions, the situa-tion is reversed. God is not involved in continual demiurgic activity, ratherthe generated world is spawned by the Demiurge (who is not immutableand so there is no metaphysical reason why he cannot create on anadhocbasis) and man, who represents the pinnacle of creation, is a once-off production, generated inadvertently as the result of a flaw within thegodhead itself. Indeed, there the divine is continually attempting to undoworld-generation, rather than to further it. Numenius falls in between bothextremes.

However, thiswould not solve the problem of why God would allow precosmic chaos toexist before rectifying the situation (since it implies a change in God’sἦθος).(Again, this problem could be rectified by simply viewing the demiurgicmyth as expository.)Modern approaches to theTimaeusThe division between the literalists and those seeking to deconstruct themyth has persisted in modern scholarship, fuelled in part by the supportwhich an allegorical interpretation of theTimaeuscould have for theexistence of ‘unwritten doctrines’ of Plato (such as the content of his lecture‘On the Good’). If the dispute has not been particularly acrimonious, thenthis is because theTimaeuswas largely marginalised during the last century.The surge in recent publications on theTimaeus, though, indicates thatthe importance of the dialogue is being reassessed.37The case for an allegorical interpretation has been persuasively arguedby Tar ́an. Most forcible is Plato’s own statement that the account which hepresents is no more than a ‘likely story’. Tar ́an mentions that the mannerof telling the myth is systematic, rather than chronological, although Ifind this to be a particularly weak argument.38It seems to be rather likeasserting that because a historian chooses to focus on events in relation totheir significance, rather than chronologically, that these events could nothave taken place.The second argument advanced by Tar ́an appears more persuasive. Hecontends that the very structure of the myth is implausible. Plato choosesto dwell on the body of the universe, prior to dealing with the soul, eventhough soul is both ontologically superior and temporally prior. However,atTim.35a, Plato declares that soul is intermediate between Forms andbody. If soul is an intermediary, this would imply that it must have beenbrought into existence later than the two extremes for which it functionsas an intermediary. Conversely, if soul is prior to bodies, it cannot becomposed of an element that is ‘divided about bodies’.For Tar ́an, it is legitimate for Plato to alter the presentation of thedemiurgic myth in a temporal sense, provided that it is not used to mask37For example, Af H ̈allstr ̈om:2009and Mohr and Sattler:201038Ta r ́an :1972,373"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Modern approaches to theTimaeus33contradictions which would occur if he was forced to follow the chrono-logical order. Otherwise, this would indicate that he never intended themyth of the Demiurge to be taken literally.Tim.31b–35a indicates thatsoul and body are contemporaneous and that the use of the terms ‘prior’and ‘older’ to refer to the relationship of soul to body is ontological andnot chronological.39Against this could be advanced the view that Platotends to be vague concerning the role of soul in administering the body.In thePhaedo(80a), where he discusses the rule of the body by the soul, orLawsx, where it is the source of all physical motion, he avoids explainingthe underlying mechanism.40If soul is intermediate between the Formsand precosmic chaos, this would imply that the soul is the cause of thedisorderly motion. If we take the myth literally, it implies that the Demi-urge must also be a soul, according to Tar ́an (why not a Mind?), since it isprior to body and intermediate between the Sensibles and the Forms. TheDemiurge cannot also be ‘prior’ to the precosmic chaos, since this wouldimply that he had produced it.Once again, the problem which arises here could be solved by drawingattention to Plato’s view that the world, formed as it was, in his opinion,from a variety of triangles, does not constitute a ‘solid’ in the true sense ofthe word, and so there should be no problem in terms of the relation of soulupon body, although this does not really resolve the situation regardingwhy the Demiurge suddenly decided to order the precosmic chaos. Tosome extent, this could be viewed as a fallacious argument – accordingto Tar ́an’s view, the contradictions are deliberately placed there by Plato,not because he found it difficult to reveal the father and maker of theuniverse to all men, but because he did not wish the concept of a temporalgeneration on the part of his mythical Demiurge to be taken literally. Tar ́anidentifies a further problem with the view that the Demiurge generatedthe self-motion of soul (which seems to be contradictory, since souls areby their very nature self-moving). This leads to the problem of whetherthe Demiurge started the self-motion of the World-Soul or else attachedit to the body of the cosmos, produced subsequently, and that after thisinsertion the soul commenced its self-motion. Tar ́an rejects Hackforth’sargument that the mythology ofTim.27d5–28c3was deliberately arrangedin order to deceive the reader; for Tar ́an, it is rather the case that Platochose the form of a myth, rather than that of a causal analysis.Ta r ́an also points out that Plato does not openly claim in theTimaeusthat soul is the cause of all motion (as self-motion) so there is no attempt39Ta r ́an:1972,37540Dillon:2009,349"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"34The original concept of the Demiurgeto contradict the reader in Plato’s assertion of precosmic chaos; for Tar ́an,this precosmic chaos exemplifies the ‘necessary cause’, just as the Demiurgerepresents the intelligent cause; further evidence that the myth should notbe taken literally.41Ta r ́an bolsters his case by pointing to two indicationsthat theTimaeusshould be viewed as a myth; firstly Plato’s statement thatno account of the material world can ever be regarded as unchanging truth,and secondly his adoption of the form of a cosmology.42This locates Plato’smyth of the Demiurge within the context of evolutionary cosmologieson the one hand and the mechanistic and haphazard explanation of theatomists. Plato, the argument goes, is attempting to propound the image ofrational design; the precosmic chaos of the Receptacle is simply an accountof what the universe would be like without the rational order representedby the Demiurge. Solmsen suggests that Plato himself warns us not totake the myth literally when he writesτὸν εἰκότα μῦθον ἀποδεχομένουςπρέπει τούτου μηδὲν ἔτι πέρα ζητεῖν, ‘it is fitting that we accept the likelystory concerning these things and not inquire even further’ (29d2–3).43Furthermore, Plato does not use any of the techniques which he employs inother works to indicate an expository nature, according to Vlastos.44Themyth itself is preceded by another mythical narrative (the war betweenAthens and Atlantis), so one is already preconditioned to approach themyth of the Demiurge in an allegorical context.Arguments in favour of a literal interpretation have been staunchlyadvanced by Vallejo. Against Tar ́an’s position that soul must be the causeof motion in the precosmic chaos, he alludes to the role played byheterogeneity.45In the Receptacle, like is attracted to like and this accountsfor precosmic motion (in addition to the winnowing motion of the Recep-tacle). Plato does not actually state in theTimaeusthat either soul ordemiurgic activity is the ultimate cause of motion and the explanationin terms of physical heterogeneity here seems to downplay any difficultyconcerning soul’s role in the motion of the universe; if it were theἀρχήofmotion, it would have to be coeval with the universe.46A refutation of the argument that a literal generation of the worldcould not have taken place on account of the immutability of God isto be found in Timaeus’ statement at42eἔμενεν ἐν τῷ ἑαυτοῦ κατὰτρόπον ἤθει, ‘he duly remained in his habitual state’.

It is a matter of utmost concern as it can shed consid-erable light on his account of world-generation and his adoption of themyth of the Demiurge to delineate what is effectively a Judaeo–Christianform ofcreation. Philo can be referred to as a Middle Platonist, thoughthis is somewhat misleading. Philo did not belong to a Middle Platonistinstitution or even owe his primary allegiance to Plato. It seems that heregarded theαἵρεσιςto which he belonged as that of Mosaic philosophy(even if he does not express it in these terms with the same frequency asJosephus). To assert, however, as does Radice,1that Philo was the lead-ing light in a Hellenistic–Jewish variant of Platonism, which subsequentlymerged with its mainstream counterpart, with Philo first positing thenotion of the Forms as the thoughts of God, and therefore the most philo-sophically important component of Middle Platonism, is surely to go toofar.Philo can be considered a Platonising expositor, even if one has diffi-culties with considering him a Platonist.De Opificio Mundican be readtogether with Plutarch’sDe Iside et Osirideas realisations on the part ofintellectuals that philosophical truths could be found in other traditions.To paraphrase Sterling, if Moses offered a definitive statement concerningcreation, this does not mean to say that it was an exclusive one.2It mustbe noted that Philo is operating within a different framework and with adifferent set of considerations in mind than the other Middle Platonistswith which we are familiar. He does not seek to convert his readers to Pla-tonism; rather he is using the structures of Greek philosophy to expoundsacred Scripture.1Radice:1989,passim2Sterling:1993,10336"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Introduction37As will be seen and as would naturally be expected, Philo forms animportant link between the later Christian Platonism of Origen and thePlatonic tradition. He is an important contributor to the concept of thehypostasis, and therefore an important exemplar of the trend of increasingseparation between the First Principle and the demiurgic one. His greatestcontribution could possibly be the notion of the Forms as God’s thoughts(though this is vehemently disputed). In any case, he does write exten-sively concerning the noetic cosmos. In this postulation of theLogosas adivine creational aid, he prefigures Origen’s system, without its Christianmodifications.An important question to address regarding Philo is whether he canbe regarded as working within the framework of the demiurgic concept,rather than just expoundingGenesisin language that by this stage hadbecome common currency. After all, while Philo may compare God to anarchitect,Gen.2:4bff. refers to God as a potter or builder. One responseis to discern the obvious legacy of theTimaeusin Philo’s account. TheLogosis clearly the counterpart of the Young Gods in its role as a mediatingentity (although when described allegorically as a sword, it also parallels theDemiurge’s mixing-bowl in the originalTimaeus‘myth’, and in its assis-tance in God’s continual governance of the cosmos, it fulfils the function ofthe World-Soul). The beautiful model of theTimaeusfinds its counterpartin Philo’s speculations on the noetic realm (though here a Jewish parallelmay also exist). While ‘creation’ may take the Judaeo–Christian form ofproduction by an omnipotent divine being, it is evidently an orderingprocess, like demiurgy, evinced by the continual division of theLogos.Furthermore, it seems unlikely that an exegete of Platonic leanings shouldremain completely uninfluenced by theTimaeus.This does, however, underline the importance of paying attention to theinfluences under which Philo operated in order to understand the history ofideas of the period. There are a number of indisputable facts: Philo is one ofour major sources for Middle Platonism, irrespective of how he is classified.Given his role in supplying a philosophical interpretation ofGenesis,thismeans that he investigated thoroughly the nature of demiurgic causality,although he tends to obscure this with what can be termed ‘creation’. Inthis respect, he could be hailed, as he sometimes is, as a proto-Gnostic.Although certain modern scholars have cast doubt on whether Philowas a ‘Middle Platonist’ (due in part to the emergence of a more nuancedunderstanding of what this might mean), in antiquity his zeal for Plato waswell-attested. Eusebius claims that he surpassed his contemporaries in hisenthusiasm forκατὰ Πλατῶνα καὶ Πυθαγόραν ἄγῶγη(‘the school of Plato"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"38Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of Alexandriaand Pythagoras’).3Jerome cites the proverbἢ Πλατῶν φιλωνίζει ἢ Φιλῶνπλατωνίζει, (‘either Plato philonises or Philo platonises’).4One of the firstmodern scholars to recognise the debt that Philo owed to Plato, rather thanjust the Judaeo–Christian tradition, Johannes Albertus Fabricius, wrote inhis important1693studyExercitatio de Platonismo Philonis Iudaeiwithreference to Philo’s views on theκόσμος νοητόςatConf.172:‘HewhoreadstheTimaeusof Plato will not in the least doubt that at this point Philogoes back to and is influenced by Platonic doctrine. Philo himself in thebook concerning the incorruptible world steals the words of Plato and letno one doubt it.’5To a very great extent, Philo can be regarded as a bridge between thevarious traditions surveyed in this study. In his doctrine of theLogosasan intermediary creative entity, which effectively allowed him to jettisonthe more Platonic scheme involving a World-Soul, he can be viewed as aforerunner of Origen. He also certainly owes a great deal to the StoicisingPlatonism of figures such as Antiochus of Ascalon and Eudorus of Alexan-dria. Stoic, Aristotelian and Neopythagorean terminology is acquired asa means of modernising Plato, as was common in Middle Platonism. AsH. D ̈orrie puts it, Philo inherited his ‘savoir s’exprimer’ from the Stoics,which helps in part to account for the Stoic elements found, particularlyin his exposition of theLogos-Cutter.6Philo has also been regarded by some scholars (notably Jonas and Har-vey) as a Gnostic, although, at the1966Messina colloquium, Jonas pointedout that one cannot regard Gnosticism in terms of a factory conveyor-belt.7ThereasonforregardingPhiloastheCro-MagnonManofGnosticismisthat by linking Biblical exegesis with Platonism, he created the intellectualconditions responsible for the rise of (Christian) Gnosticism. This is a fal-lacious assumption for a number of reasons. Firstly, the assistant demiurgesofOpif.are not in opposition to the supreme God. Secondly, Philo usesthe refrain ofGenesis‘and God saw that it was good’ to refer to the createdworld, whereas Gnosticism views the sensible realm in very negative terms.8Philo also refers to the cosmos as the younger Son of God (Spec.1.96)9andatDeus31–2refers to the intelligible realm as God’s older son.3Runia:1986,27;Hist.

TheTimaeusand thePhaedruswere the dialogues most oftenutilised by Philo. However, in the entirecorpus Philonicum, Philo onlyquotes, paraphrases or refers directly to theTimaeusapproximately twentytimes, twelve in the philosophical treatises and seven in the exegeticalgroup.10It might appear that these occurrences are relatively infrequent,but Philo quotes theTimaeusmore often than the rest of Plato’s otherdialogues combined.Rather than adopt Runia’s method, which has been to analyse the corre-spondences between theTimaeusand the works of Philo and then synthesisethe results, an undertaking which is clearly beyond the scope of this study, Iwish to concentrate on the works most relevant for analysing Philo’s viewson the generation and (in)destructibility of the cosmos:De Opificio MundiandDe Aeternitate Mundi. In any case, Runia’s research has found thatDeOpificio Mundicontains the greatest usage of theTimaeus(followed by theAllegorical Commentary).Influence of theTimaeusis not uniform. Apart from use made of thetravels of Solon and the Atlantis myth (17a–27d), which is irrelevant to thematter in hand, Philo draws mainly upon Timaeus’ introductory speech(27d,29d) and the section outlining the works of reason. In addition,Philo draws upon Plato’s doctrines concerning Man’s psychology (69a–72d) and theτέλοςof Man (89d–92c). Even within these areas usage is notuniform. The most important sections are those outlining fundamentalphilosophical principles (27d–29d), the account of world-generation (29e–31b), Time (37c–38b), the Demiurge’s address to the Young Gods (41a–d),the creation of human reason (41b–44c) and the theory of vision (47a–e).11The FormsThere was some dispute in antiquity on the issue of whether Plato hadposited two principles (as claimed by Theophrastus: matter and the sourceof movement; basically the One and the Indefinite Dyad being responsible10Runia:1986,367, which also contains a complete list of these occurrences.11Runia:1986,372"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"40Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of Alexandriafor the generation of Forms),12three principles: a Demiurge, the Formsand matter (as claimed by Alexander of Aphrodisias) or a sort of twoand a half principle position, with the Forms regarded as the thoughtsof God and therefore derivative, rather than an independent principle.(Simplicius’ view that Plato posited six principles, three in a strict sense:the maker, the paradigm and the end and three auxiliary causes: matter, theform (in the sense of the Aristotelian immanent form) and the instrument,can be left aside for present purposes).13As Sharples notes, the Forms arethe Demiurge’s thoughts in theTimaeusin the sense that he is aware ofthem; the issue could be better phrased in terms of whether the Formshave an existence independent of the divine mind.14It has been suggestedthat the three principle theory developed from the theory of two and ahalf principles;15Tarrant demonstrates that it is characteristic of the secondcenturyad; while Runia dates the three principle theory to the first centuryad.16In any case, Philo never refers to the Forms as ungenerated, since thatwould imply that they are independent of God. That does not automaticallymean that they are generated in time.17The noetic realm, contained in theLogos, undergoes two phases. As the noetic realm, it exists eternally. Asa physical instantiation, it becomes immanent in the world, but both ofthese phases occur simultaneously.One issue dominating recent Platonist scholarship concerns the extent ofPhilo’s contribution to the Middle Platonist theory of the Forms. Accordingto Wolfson, Philo is the first to apply the termκόσμος νοητός(‘intelligibleworld’) to the ensemble of the Forms.18The notion of a ‘noetic cosmos’may have been inspired by the opening ofRepublicx, where Socrates drawsa distinction between three types of bed: a particular bed constructed bya carpenter, the image of a bed produced by a painter and the idea of thebed, produced by God. Plato had previously used the expressionνοητὸςτόπος(‘intelligible place’,Rep.vi.504d,vii.517b) orὑπερουράνιος τόπος(‘supercelestial place’) atPhaedrus247c, to refer to the place of the Forms.Wolfson sees Philo as altering these terms to refer to a noetic cosmos whichdoes not exist eternally in the mind of God, but which only comes intobeing when He decides to create.19I would not be as prepared as Wolfsonto regard Philo as father of the termκόσμος νοητός. I think in any case that12Sharples:1995,7013Simplicius,Commentary on Aristotles’ Physics1.214Sharples:1995,74. Sharples also notes a passage in Varro (Varro ap. St. Augustine,De civitate Dei7.28=VarroAnt. Rer. Div.xv,fr.206in Cardauns:1976, in which these three principles areidentified with the Capitoline triad (Jupiter, Juno and Minerva), but since Minerva sprang fromthe head of Jupiter, it accommodates the two and a half principle theory also.15Sharples:1995,7516Tarrant:1985,116;Runia:1993,13517Wo l f s o n :1968,20818Wo l f s o n :1968,22719Wo l f s o n :1968,228"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Forms41there is a distinction in Philo between an eternally existingLogosand thenoetic realm which it contains, which emerges simultaneously when Godturns to demiurgy. (This is apparent from the famous image of the architectdesigning a city inOpif.; see my discussion below. The envisaged city isonly created when the architect considers what he wishes to construct; itdoes not exist otherwise.)This notion that the noetic realm is the cosmos when God turns tocreate, means that it functions as the ‘idea of ideas’.20AtextfromtheStoicphilosopher Arius Didymus proves illuminating in this regard:Therefore the particular archetypes, as it were, precede the sense-perceptiblebodies, so that the Form containing all the Forms itself, being the mostbeautiful and the most perfect, exists as the paradigm of this cosmos, for ithas been made similar to it by the Demiurge and produced in accordancewith divine Providence out of the whole essence.21This passage is adapted by Alcinous atDidasc.12.1, where he claims thatGod generates the cosmos by looking towards the idea of one.22This notionof the Forms as the contents of the divine mind may owe something tothe Jewish tradition, where God is said to have used the Torah as a model,though this notion may in turn be derived from Platonic influence onJudaism.23This is instructive, since if God constructs the cosmos accordingto the Forms which are his thoughts, it leaves open the possibility that Godhas created according to (from our perspective) His own whims. However,since, in reality, the world is constructed on rational principles to allow itto attain the greatest degree of excellence of which it is capable, it is notthat far removed from the production of the Platonic Demiurge.It is true to state that the termκόσμος νοητόςoccurs in Philo for the firsttime in extant Greek literature. However, terms which express a similarconcept are used elsewhere. Timaeus Locrus §30mentionsὁἰδανικὸςκόσμος(‘the ideal cosmos’), a phrase used also by A ̈etius atPs.-PlutarchPlac.1.7and2.6.24Unfortunately, none of this proves that Philo couldnot have invented the doctrine. Plato himself, at times, comes close to20Opif.2521Eusebius,Praep. Ev.xi.23.622Runia:2001,15123This notion comes across in the exegesis of Rabbi Hoshai’a of Caesarea, a friend of Origen: ‘TheTorah declares: “I am the working tool of the Holy One, blessed be He.” In human practice, whena mortal king builds a palace he builds it not with his own skill but with the skill of an architect.The architect moreover does not build it out of his head, but employs plans and diagrams to knowhow to arrange the chambers and the wicket doors. Thus God consulted the Torah, and createdthe world while the Torah declares “in the beginning God created (1:1) ‘beginning’ referring to theTorah . . . ”’ (GenesisRabbah1.1, Midrash Rabbah, trans. H. Freedman and M. Simon, The SocinoPress, London,1951).

AtRep.vi.508c, he refers to ‘noetic place’, in thePhaedrusmyth andat247c1–2to ‘things outside the cosmos’.25Radice goes further; for him Philo was the catalyst of the doctrine thatthe Forms are the thoughts of God. Clearly, the concept is not expressesedon a literal reading of theTimaeus, where the Demiurge is subordinate tothe Forms, whereas for Philo, God produces the blueprint according towhich he wishes to create the world. (If we accept a non-literal reading,it becomes rather a different matter. The Forms have to be interpretedin some way, and the view that they are the thoughts of God, or therational World-Soul, would seem to be the most logical one.) For Radice,Philo considers God as the ‘foundational’ creator; that is the creator ofthe ‘positive foundations’ of the world.26This is because He only createstrue being (the physical instantiation of the Forms) and not the nega-tive components (matter and evil) which are non-existent and thereforecould not be created. This is a break with the ‘semi-creationalism’ of Plato(what I refer to as true demiurgy; ordering matter in conformity with theForms).I agree that this distinction can be drawn regarding the function ofthe Demiurge in Plato and Philo. However, as Radice himself admits,attributing the origin of the doctrine that the Forms are the thoughts ofGod to Philo would create three main problems.27Firstly, Philo adopts thistheory as part of his allegorical reading of the Bible, and no trace of thisBiblical exegesis can be observed in Platonism subsequently. Secondly, itwould imply that Philo was capable of exerting significant influence uponthe subsequent Platonic tradition. Indeed, Radice even envisages a situationin which two co-existing Platonic traditions, the mainstream Greek one anda Hellenist–Jewish variant, merge after Philo, thereby explaining the meansby which this Philonic theory could enter the mainstream tradition.28Thethird difficulty lies in Philonic interpretation; many scholars would viewPhilo as incapable of inventing a theory of this significance.Radice adopts three responses. Philo never indicates a source for thisdoctrine inDe Opificio Mundi.This is hardly reliable evidence, though,since he frequently avoids attributing specific doctrines even to Plato.Secondly, and more cogently,De Opificio Mundipresents a more originalaccount of creation thanDe Aeternitate Mundi(a dual exegesis of theBible and theTimaeus) and so can be seen as closer to Philo’s own beliefs,25Runia:2001,13626Radice:1991,12727Radice:1991,12928Radice:1991,130"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"TheLogosand theLogos-Cutter43whileDe Aeternitate Mundipresents a more traditional Greek account.AdditionallyDe Natura Mundifrom Timaeus Locrus, which is regarded asa standard exegesis of theTimaeusat this period, is close toDe AeternitateMundiand never claims that the Forms are the thoughts of God. I do notfeel, however, that the evidence is sufficient to postulate both that Philo wasthe first to use the termκόσμος νοητόςand that he invented (as opposed todeveloped) the notion of the Forms as God’s thoughts. Given his positionclose to the beginnings of Middle Platonism, we must be careful not tofoist originality upon Philo in our enthusiasm to arrive at a more detailedunderstanding of how this particular phase of Platonism began. That said,however, Philo probably displays originality in his utilisation of theLogosofGod and in his location of the noetic realm in thisLogos.TheLogos-Cutteris, in all probability, a Philonic contribution, given the fact, that in theabsence of these notions in his philosophical predecessors, such conceptscould easily have commended themselves to him from Scripture.TheLogosand theLogos-CutterThe image of theLogosas a tool is one of the predominant images pre-sented by Philo in order to cast light on its functioning in the creationof the world.

All.1.15orOpif.100. Obviously, Ganymede isnot alluded to by name, though we could hardly expect Philo to do that,and indeed he avoids mentioning Athena by name in his equation of herwith theLogos. On closer reflection, the equation of Ganymede need not29‘To his chief and most honoured messenger, hisLogos, the Father who engendered everything hasbestowed a remarkable fiefdom, to stand on the frontier and separate the creator from his product.TheLogosis both continuously the suppliant of stressed mortality to the immortal and the ruler’sambassador to his subject.

In the second instance,he contemplates the possibility that God dispenses benefits directly uponcreated matter without any mediation, without coming down in favour ofone of his models of divine Providence. What is going on here?The notion that benefits (as well as evils) are dispensed by angels, ratherthan by God directly, is found elsewhere in the Philonic corpus, as wellas the understanding that God is capable of intervening directly upon thematerial world; He has no need of any entities to insulate Him from thephenomenal realm. In any case, it seems strange that Philo should attempt32Cher.3and35,Mut.87,Fug.5,Deus18233Billings:1919,4534Somn.II.185–7"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"TheLogosand theLogos-Cutter45to portray the relationship between God and hisLogosin (covert) homo-erotic terms. Dillon notes the lack of surviving testimony to this allegoryelsewhere, although he notes the possibility that it was conceived sometime previously and so was more acceptable by the stage that Philo cameto use it.35A further indication of speculation in this regard is the identifi-cation of Ganymede with the Water-Carrier by Hellenistic times; leadingone to believe that it was beginning to be regarded as a cosmic power.36In this context, Dillon mentions the demiurgic imagery of the Avestantradition, in which Haoma, a spirit who inhabits alcohol, is responsiblefor the blessings of humanity. This is similar to the second equation of theLogosas Ganymede atSpec.i.303, as the fountain from which God poursforth the virtues.This reveals the complex nature of Philo’s conception of theLogos.Itis more than a mere tool or knife used by God during creation. It is amediating entity, which functions as a co-Creator and plays an active rolein the universe after genesis, although it does not compromise God’s unity.The conceptions of theLogosas a knife and as the wine-pourer of Godcan be regarded as related. As wine-pourer, theLogosis responsible forconveying divine benefits upon mankind; as cutter, it provides the greatestof benefits in terms of the ordering division of the created realm.The idea of theLogosas a continual outpouring from God evokes thelater Plotinian notion of a creative flow from the One. Furthermore, itunderpins the role which it plays in a continual creation. Philo uses thetermLogosto refer toνοῦς, quite possibly because he wished to drawa distinction between the divine Intellect and the human mind. In thissense, it can be regarded as containing the Forms. It is also referred to asthe oldest and the most generic of created things (Leg. All.iii.175), as wellas ‘the first-born son of God’ (Agr.51). This seems to have paved the wayfor the later identification of the divineLogoswith Christ in subsequentChristian thinking. Additionally, theLogoscan resemble a proto-GnosticDemiurge in so far as ‘it is called a god by those with imperfect knowledgeof the real god’.37This positing of theLogosdoes not undermine the unity of the godhead,which remains indivisible for Philo:ὁ γὰρ θεοῦ λόγος φιλέρημος καὶ μονωτικός,ἐν ὄχλῳ τῷ τῶν γεγονότωνκαὶ φθαρησομένων οὐχὶ φυρόμενος,ἀλλ’ἄνω φοιτᾶν εἰθισμένος ἀεὶ καὶ ἑνὶ35Dillon:1979,3936Homiliae Clementis5.17,Ampelius2.11, Ps.-Erathosthenes,Catast.26,30, as mentioned by Dillon:1979,39.37Leg.

(Her.234)This is reiterated atHer.236, where Philo indicates that not only is theFather indivisible, but that this characteristic is possessed by theLogosalso.38It is particularly interesting that Philo should attempt to preservethis sort of ‘unity in the second degree’, since it indicates that theLogosisnot based on the Platonic Dyad. (Indeed, it is a masculine entity and hasmore in common with the World-Soul; it is Sophia that corresponds mostclosely with the Dyad.) One of the advantages in numerous metaphysicalsystems for postulating secondary gods is that it allows postulation offurther hypostases, but Philo, as a monotheist, is very keen on preservinga united godhead, even as regards secondary divine entities. In spite ofPhilo’s claim that theLogosis a second god, he does not use the phrase inthe same manner as Numenius. Numenius’ Second God, as we shall see, isdivided by matter, whereas although the PhilonicLogosisthesolecauseofthe division of matter, Philo is at pains to point out that it is not dividedby it.On two occasions, Philo refers to theLogosas an instrument used byGod in the creation of the world. AtLeg. All.iii.96, we are told that God‘used it like an instrument when He was making the world (ἐκοσμοποίει)’and ‘when He was fashioning the world (ἐκοσμόπλάστει), He used it as aninstrument, so that the arrangement of all the things He was completingmight be faultless’ (Migr.6). On three occasions, the role of theLogosasan instrument is implied. It is that ‘through which’ (δι ̓ οὗ)theworldwasproduced (ἐδημιουργεῖτο)atSacr.8,(andSpec.i.81) or that ‘by which’38τοῦτο δὲ συμβαίνει διὰ τὴν πρὸς τὸν ποιητὴν καὶ πατέρα τῶν ὅλων ἐμφέρειαν.τὸ γὰρ θεῖον ἀμιγές,ἄκρατον,ἀμερέστατον ὑπάρχον ἅπαντι τῷ κόσμῳ γέγονεν αἴτιον μίξεως,κράσεως,διαιρέσεως,πολυμερείας·ὥστε εἰκότως καὶ τὰ ὁμοιωθέντα,νοῦς τε ὁ ἐν ἡμῖν καὶ ὁ ὑπὲρ ἡμᾶς,ἀμερεῖς καὶἄτμητοι ὑπάρχοντες διαιρεῖν καὶ διακρίνειν ἕκαστα τῶν ὄντων ἐρρωμένως δυνήσονται.‘And this comes about as the result of its resemblance to the Maker and Father of all. For thegodhead is pure, unmixed and without subordinate parts and has become for the entire cosmos thecause of mixture, blending, divisibility and multiplicity of parts. So that it is fitting that what issimilar to God, the Intellect in us and the Intellect above us, should subsist as pure and indivisibleand still be robust and capable of distinguishing everything that is.’"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"TheLogosand theLogos-Cutter47GodmadetheworldatCher.127. This is similar to the role played byWisdom during creation. InThe Wisdom of Solomon, the author treatsWisdom as equivalent to theLogosof God, although he refers to it as ‘God’sdaughter’. Wisdom is equally that ‘through which (δι ̓ ἧς) the world cameinto existence’39or ‘was brought to completion’.40Wisdom additionally isthe title given to what seems to be the Philonic equivalent of the ReceptacleatEbr.31, where it is called the ‘mother and nurse (τιθήνη) of the all’.TheLogosfunctions in the typical role of a divine mediator, insulatingGod from the disorder (in Philo’s case, evil might be a little too strong)inherent in matter:ἐξ ἐκείνης γὰρ πάντ’ἐγέννησεν ὁ θεός,οὐκ ἐφαπτόμενος αὐτός–οὐ γὰρ ἦνθέμις ἀπείρου καὶ πεφυρμένης ὕλης ψαύειν τὸν εὐδαίμονα καὶ μακάριον–ἀλλὰ ταῖς ἀσωμάτοις δυνάμεσιν,ὧν ἔτυμον ὄνομα αἱ ἰδέαι,κατεχρήσατοπρὸς τὸ γένος ἕκαστον τὴν ἁρμόττουσαν λαβεῖν μορφήν.For God generated everything out of that [matter] without touching ithimself – for it was not right for his happy and blessed nature to touchunlimited and jumbled matter – but he employed incorporeal powers, aptlycalled Forms, so that each genus might be able to take its appropriateshape. (Spec.i.329)This mode of creation is echoed when God calls upon his powers to aidHim in the forming of man. These incorporeal powers which allow matterto take a shape do not themselves become enmattered (unlike the manof thePoimandres: see below). Although it may not be ‘lawful’ for Godto act directly upon matter, this does not prevent Him from dispensingbenefits directly to mortals (Leg. All.iii.178). While Philo compares theseincorporeal powers which assist in creation to the [Platonic] Forms, theyalso reflect the influence of the Stoic doctrine of efficient causes.The image of theLogosas a cutter might well have suggested itself toPhilo from the flaming sword of the Cherubim atGen.3:24, once Philo hadequated this with theLogos.41Among the Nag Hammadi texts, accordingtoThe Testimony of Truth9.3,itistheWord(logos) which separates usfrom the error of the angels, where it is associated with the incarnate Sonof Man.42InThe Teaching of Silvanus,theLogosis also regarded as acutting-agent, and an identification with the incarnate Christ is made39Fug.1040Det.5441This is suggested by Harl:1966–Quis rerum divinarum heres sit(PM15).42‘But the saw is the Word of the Son of Man which separates us from the error of the angels. But noone knows the God of the truth except the man alone, this one who will forsake all the things ofthe world since he has renounced the whole place having grasped the fringe of his garment’ (trans.Birger Pearson, as furnished by Hay:1973,18)."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"48Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of Alexandriaexplicit.43The Gospel of Truthcompares theLogosto a drawn sword.44However, just as inThe Teaching of Silvanus, this cutting-action has asoteriological, rather than ademiurgicsignificance, evoking the Johannineconception of Incarnation, with the Word condemning some and savingothers. The three Nag Hammadi texts quoted above date from the secondcenturyad.This portrayal of theLogosas a saw or sword may either be influenced insome way (directly or indirectly) by Philo, or indicate a current in Judaeo–Christian philosophical thought, which Philo himself adopted. Philo mayhave drawn upon the Jewish tradition’s view of the divine word as a swordused for protection of the faithful and punishment of the wicked,45andconflated this with the cosmological elements of the StoicLogos.TheLogos-Cutter can be viewed as a Jewish response within the current ofGreek philosophy, which attempted to explain the imposition of orderupon a disordered universe using figures such as Hermes or Osiris as apersonification of divine wisdom. As a divine mediator, theLogosappearsatPoimandres10–11and at Plutarch’sDe Iside et Osiride(53–4,372e–373c).Eudorus (of Alexandria) may also have expressed the combination of theMonad and Dyad as the thought orλόγοςof a supreme One.46Tobinsuggests that theLogosin Philo may reflect an element from the early stagesof Alexandrian Middle Platonism, ignored by subsequent thinkers.47A useful source for Philo’s doctrine of theLogos-Tomeusis his commen-taryQuis Rerum Divinarum Heres Sit(‘Who is the Heir of Divine Things?’),an exegesis ofGen.15:2–18, concerning Abraham’s sacrifice of the heifer,ram and birds. Although the concept of theLogos-Cutter is only fully devel-oped inHer.,atFug.194–6, it is mentioned as a Divider. In an interestingphilosophical insight, Philo portrays Yahweh as the inventor of Platonicdiairesisby which he differentiates the various levels of the created realm.AtHer.132, Philo refers to Abraham’s division of his sacrifice as symbolicof theLogos’ division of our consciousness into rational and irrational soul,true and false speech and cognitive and non-cognitive impressions. Philohas no qualms here about adopting a twofold division of the soul, despitethe more Platonic tripartite division, in favour of Stoic tendencies. AtHer.43‘Knock on yourself that the Word (Logos) may open for you. For he is the Ruler of Faith and theSharp Sword, having become all for everyone because he wishes to have mercy on everyone’ (trans.Peel and Zandee, quoted by Hay:1973,19). Teach.

The Arti-ficer (ὁτεχνίτης) creates by dividing our soul and limbs in the middle, thetechnique he uses for creation of the world itself, which is equated withdivision into equal parts and the division of opposites.This notion of theLogosengaged in division is central to Philo’s notionof world-creation. It is hardly surprising that it is theLogoswhich is engagedin this sort of activity, as the human mind, which Philo also describes as aLogos, is occupied with much the same function on a smaller scale, whenit is engaged indiairesis.48Her.134continues this concept of a creativedivision on the part of theLogos, based around the four main elements.λαβὼν γὰρ αὐτὴν ἤρξατο διαιρεῖν ὧδε·δύο τὸ πρῶτον ἐποίει τμήματα,τό τε βαρὺ καὶ κοῦφον,τὸ παχυμερὲς ἀπὸ τοῦ λεπτομεροῦς διακρίνων·εἶθ’ἑκάτερον πάλιν διαιρεῖ,τὸ μὲν λεπτομερὲς εἰς ἀέρα καὶ πῦρ,τὸ δὲπαχυμερὲς εἰς ὕδωρ καὶ γῆν,ἃ καὶ στοιχεῖα αἰσθητὰ αἰσθητοῦ κόσμου,ὡσανεὶ θεμελίους,προκατεβάλετο.For taking this, he began to divide it in the following manner. First hemade two sections, one heavy and the other light, distinguishing the coarseparticles from the fine ones. And then he divides each of these again, therare particles into air and fire and the dense ones into water and earth,which as the sensible elements of the sensible realm, he established as thefoundations.The first task of theLogos-Cutter is division based on the elements. Theactivity of theLogoshere parallels very closely the ordering through differ-entiation engaged in by the Demiurge of theTimaeus.49It is interesting thatin spite of a certain adoption of Stoic elements, a great deal of Philo’s expo-sition of theLogos-Cutter is expressed in terms generic to all the schools.Certainly Stoic, however, is the division of fire into two kinds at §136;theuseful variety and what amounts to the Stoicpyr technikon, set aside topreserve the heavens.5048This parallel is made more explicit atHer.235:ὅ τε γὰρ θεῖος λόγος τὰ ἐν τῇ φύσει διεῖλε καὶδιένειμε πάντα,ὅ τε ἡμέτερος νοῦς,ἅττ’ἂν παραλάβῃ νοητῶς πράγματά τε καὶ σώματα,εἰςἀπειράκις ἄπειρα διαιρεῖ μέρη καὶ τέμνων οὐδέποτε λήγει.‘The divineLogosseparated and distributed everything that is in nature, and our mind dealing withthe material and immaterial things grasped by intellection, divides them into an infinity of infinitiesandat no point does it stop cutting them.’49This notion is developed atHer.135:πάλιν δὲ τὸ βαρὺ καὶ κοῦφον καθ’ἑτέρας ἔτεμνεν ἰδέας,τὸ μὲνκοῦφον εἰς ψυχρόν τε καὶ θερμόν–ἐπεφήμισε δὲ τὸ μὲν ψυχρὸν ἀέρα,τὸ δὲ θερμὸν φύσει πῦρ–,τὸ δὲ βαρὺ εἰς ὑγρόν τε αὖ καὶ ξηρόν·ἐκάλεσε δὲ τὸ μὲν ξηρὸν γῆν,τὸ δὲ ὑγρὸν ὕδωρ.‘Once again he divided heavy from light according to a different method of classification. Hedivided the light into cold and hot and he called the cold “air”, and that which is hot by nature,“fire”, and the heavy into wet and dry; and he called the dry “earth” and the wet “water”.’50Cf.SVF1.120"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"50Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of AlexandriaAtHer.140, Philo makes it quite clear that God is the true Demiurgeand theLogosis merely the means or tool by which He creates, rather thansome kind of independently-operating agent.οὕτως ὁ θεὸς ἀκονησάμενος τὸν τομέα τῶν συμπάντων αὑτοῦ λόγον διῄρειτήν τε ἄμορφον καὶ ἄποιον τῶν ὅλων οὐσίαν καὶ τὰ ἐξ αὐτῆς ἀποκριθέντατέτταρα τοῦ κόσμου στοιχεῖα καὶ τὰ διὰ τούτων παγέντα ζῷά τε αὖ καὶφυτά.And so God sharpened the blade of his all-cuttingLogosand he divided uni-versal being, previously formless and without quality and the four elementsof the cosmos set apart from it and the animals and plants solidified fromthem.The Being which God divides here isousiaor the Stoic conception ofmatter, although God is envisaged as ordering, rather than creating. Thecontinual division of matter by theLogoscanbeviewedasPhilo’sversionof the continual geometry engaged in by the Demiurge atQuaest. Conviv.1002e., stressed atHer.235(quotedatn48), where theLogosis said tonever cease to cleave matter. The passage describes theLogosas dividingmatter into an infinity of infinities; for Philo, there was no such thing asan atom in the philosophical sense – it was always possible, even if onlyfor theLogos, to subdivide matter eternally. Theοὐδέποτεhere, I wouldsuggest, could be taken as ‘at no point’ as well as ‘never’; theLogosneverceases to divide matter in the temporal sense, but equally in its continualcare for the phenomenal realm, it is capable of infinite division, or atleast to a point beyond that which can be comprehended by the humanmind.This notion of theLogosas a tool is echoed in a similar passage at §167:‘these tables too were cut by the Divine Legislator and by Him only’. Thisnotion of cutting suggests that the thought of God can be equated withtheτομεύς. The passage helps to reinforce the notion of theLogos-Cutteras an instrument of the Demiurge, since the identification of a legislatorwith a Demiurge is an old one, etymologically and conceptually, as bothcan be regarded as imposing order upon disorder. Although Philo’s imageof theLogos-Cutter appears to be a unique contribution,Her.146revealshow much he owes to the Demiurge of theTimaeus:τούτων προϋποτυπωθέντων ἴδε πῶς μέσα διελὼν ἴσα διεῖλε κατὰ πάσαςτὰς ἰσότητος ἰδέας ἐν τῇ τοῦ παντὸς οὐρανοῦ γενέσει.ἀριθμῷ μὲν οὖν ἴσατὰ βαρέα τοῖς κούφοις ἔτεμνε,δύο δυσί,γῆν καὶ ὕδωρ,τὰ βάρος ἔχοντα,τοῖς φύσει κούφοις,ἀέρι καὶ πυρί,καὶ πάλιν ἓν ἑνί,τὸ μὲν ξηρότατον τῷὑγροτάτῳ,γῆν ὕδατι,τὸ δὲ ψυχρότατον τῷ θερμοτάτῳ,πυρὶ ἀέρα,τὸν"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"TheLogosand theLogos-Cutter51αὐτὸν δὲ τρόπον καὶ σκότος φωτὶ καὶ ἡμέραν νυκτὶ καὶ χειμῶνι θέρος καὶἔαρι μετόπωρον καὶ ὅσα τούτων συγγενῆ.Having sketched this in outline, note how God in ‘dividing in the middle’when creating the universe divided according to all principles of equality.For with respect to equality of number, he cut heavy parts equal in numberto the light parts, two parts corresponding to two parts, earth and water,being heavy, corresponding to air and fire, the parts which are light bynature. And in this way again one corresponds to one, the driest to thewettest, earth to water and the coldest to the hottest, fire to air, and in thesame way darkness corresponds to light and day to night and summer towinter and spring to autumn and there are many other examples of the samekind.This activity is similar to the separating action of the Receptacle (underthe guidance of the Demiurge). The stress on division based on equality(i.e. rational principles) echoes the mixing together of the Same and theDifferent; Philo points to the rationality visible in the cosmos, as evidencethat it must have been created by a rational principle.This is echoed in the description of the equitable construction of theheavens atHer.147, which is very similar to the construction of the heavensand the insertion of the World-Soul atTim.35. The Demiurge createsparallel circles in heaven: the spring and autumn equinoxes and the summerand winter solstices. He further observes equality in his creation of twouninhabited zones adjoining the poles and two habitable and temperatezones. The description here is very similar to the construction of the heavensand the insertion of the World-Soul atTim.35. Although Philo dispenseswith the World-Soul, which becomes largely replaced by theLogos,heis prepared to adopt the imagery of theTimaeusfor his own purposes.51Dillon suggests that Philo may be using a Stoic handbook in delineating hisconcept of theLogos. In this context, he cites the presentation of Antiochusof Ascalon in Cicero’sAcademica Posteriora, where mention is made of aninfinite ‘cutting’ and ‘dividing’ of matter.52However, Cicero does not gointo details of how this division contributes to the organisation of matter,or indeed any details at all.51Her.153develops the notion that man is a compound generated by an equitable mixture of hiscomponents by theLogos:...καὶ τὰ περὶ ἡμᾶς μέντοι τέτταρα,ξηρόν,ὑγρόν,ψυχρόν τε αὖ καὶθερμόν,τὴν δι’ἀναλογίας ἰσότητα κερασαμένην ἁρμόσασθαι,καὶ μηδὲν ἄλλο<ἡμᾶς>ἢ κρᾶσινεἶναι τῶν τεσσάρων δυνάμεων ἀναλογίας ἰσότητι κραθεισῶν.‘ . . . and they tell us that the four components: dry, wet, cold and hot have been mixed andharmonised according to equal mathematical proportion and we are nothing other than the mixtureof the four constituents blended together on the basis of mathematical proportion.’52‘infinite secari atque dividi’, ap.

Post.27."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"52Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of AlexandriaJust like his Platonic predecessor, the Philonic Demiurge constructs theworld based on significant numbers, which reveals the perfection of thecosmos (Her.156).53It is this that allows Philo to explain in philosophicalterms creation in six/seven days; obviously there is no reason why anomnipotent deity should require a week to create the cosmos, since hewould be capable, as Philo asserts, of creating it simultaneously. However,the importance of six and seven underline the perfection of what wascreated. This perfection of the created world is evoked by the menorah.54This importance of six and seven is stressed subsequently atHer.215.55It is evident that the cosmos as a whole is good. God ‘judged equallyabout the little and the great, according to Moses’ (Her.157). There can beno question of the recalcitrance of matter as an explanation of the exist-ence of evil in the created realm: God, like the Platonic Demiurge, madethe best kind of world possible, but unlike him, was in no way limitedby the materials which He used.56The prejudicial Platonic view of matterdoes come across atHer.158, although not as a limitation on God’s bounty.Rather, matter is not responsible for the beauty of the cosmos, which mustbe attributed to the superior science of the Demiurge.57For Philo, in spite53ταῦτα δ’οὐκ ἀπὸ σκοποῦ διδάσκουσιν,ἀλλ’ἔγνωσαν ὅτι ἡ τοῦ θεοῦ τέχνη,καθ’ἣν ἐδημιούργειτὰ σύμπαντα,οὔτε ἐπίτασιν οὔτε ἄνεσιν δεχομένη,μένουσα δὲ ἡ αὐτὴ κατὰ τὴν ἐν ὑπερβολαῖςἀκρότητα τελείως ἕκαστον τῶν ὄντων δεδημιούργηκε,πᾶσιν ἀριθμοῖς καὶ πάσαις ταῖς πρὸςτελειότητα ἰδέαις καταχρησαμένου τοῦ πεποιηκότος.‘And in teaching this they are not short of the mark, but they know that the art of God, accordingto which He produced everything, does not accept either tightening and slackening, but remainsthe same and through its transcendent superiority it has perfectly framed all things that are, allnumbers and all forms that orient towards perfection are fully employed by the Maker.’54Her.225:ἐπίγειον οὖν βουληθεὶς ἀρχετύπου τῆς κατ’οὐρανὸν σφαίρας ἑπταφεγγοῦς μίμημα παρ’ἡμῖν ὁ τεχνίτης γενέσθαι πάγκαλον ἔργον προσέταξε,τὴν λυχνίαν,δημιουργηθῆναι.δέδεικται δὲκαὶ ἡ πρὸς ψυχὴν ἐμφέρεια αὐτῆς·‘Therefore the Craftsman wishing that we might possess an imitation of the archetypal heavenlysphere with its seven lights ordered this most beautiful work, the candlestick, to be made.

And on accountof this he endowed them all with the same art and in equal proportion. Andso in the holy Scriptures it says ‘God saw all things that He had made andbehold they were good’ (Gen.1:31) and those things which receive the samepraise are equal in honour according to the one who praises.This passage seems to indicate the existence of different types of matter. ButPhilo perhaps usesὕληto refer to material in general, rather than ‘matter’in the technical sense. I think that Philo is influenced here by theGenesisaccount, in which man is created from a mixture of materials, such as mudandpneuma. The account finds an echo in Plotinus’ comment atEnn.iii2[47]11.6that a craftsman could not make an animal only with eyes, even ifthese are its finest feature. The beauty of the cosmos lies in its instantiationof all possibilities, and even though some of these possibilities may appearbetter than others, God has applied the same skill in making everything.This point is picked up atDe Prov.2.59when Philo states that thecreation of reptiles has not come into being by a direct act of Providence(κατὰ πρόνοιαν), but as an attendant circumstance (κατ’ἐπακολούθησιν)Philo adopts the response also favoured by the Christians in explaining whyGod has created wild animals (they encourage bravery) atDe Prov.2.56–8.Philo’s response is more systematic, however. Worms and lice cannot beblamed on the Demiurge, but occur for scientific reasons (putrefactionin food and perspiration).58Just as Plato asserts that only what is goodcan be attributed to God, Providence is only responsible for that which iscreated ‘from its proper material by a generative and foremost process ofnature’ (ἐξ οἰκείας ὕλης κατὰ φύσιν σπερματικὴν καὶ προηγουμένην ἔχειγένεσιν).59Philo also adopts the Stoic approach that apparent evils, uponcloser inspection, turn out to be beneficial, when he points out the utilityof many venomous animals in medicinal processes atDe Prov.2.60f.TheLogosgoes on to allocate various portions to humanity atHer.180.There are two distinct categories of good: a superior kind marked by acheaper than the expensive substances: for they had an even greater love of beauty and by relyingupon additional technique, they wished to make deficient material equal.’58De Prov.2.5959De Prov.2.59"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"54Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of Alexandriastamp (ἐπίσημα) is given to the lover of learning and a formless version(τὰ ἀτύπωτα καὶ ἄσημα) is bestowed upon the ignorant.

Therefore it seemsthat theLogosdistributes to men of ignorance that which is purely material.Philo has a Stoicised reading of theTimaeusin mind atHer.187–9,where he refers to theLogosas a bond holding together creation, thoughhe uses the termsκόλλαandδεσμὸς, rather than the more Stoicἕξις:...μονὰς δὲ οὔτε προσθήκην οὔτε ἀφαίρεσιν δέχεσθαι πέφυκεν,εἰκὼνοὖσα τοῦ μόνου πλήρους θεοῦ.χαῦνα γὰρ τά γε ἄλλα ἐξ ἑαυτῶν,εἰ δέπου καὶ πυκνωθείη,λόγῳ σφίγγεται θείῳ.κόλλα γὰρ καὶ δεσμὸς οὗτοςπάντα τῆς οὐσίας ἐκπεπληρωκώς·ὁδ’εἴρας καὶ συνυφήνας ἕκαστα πλήρηςαὐτὸς ἑαυτοῦ κυρίως ἐστίν,οὐ δεηθεὶς ἑτέρου τὸ παράπαν....and a unit does not accept either addition or subtraction, being theimage of the sole God, who also has plenitude. For other things are porousin themselves and if the pores are closed, it is because they are bound tight bythe divineLogos. For theLogosis a glue and a bond and fills up all things withHis essence. But He, fasting and weaving together each individual thing, isin a true sense filled with Himself and He requires absolutely nothing else.This echoes the portrayal of theLogosatDe Plantatione7–10,asabondholding together opposites. There is an interesting parallel in the pseudo-AristotelianDe Mundo, where Nature is regarded as responsible for theharmony of opposites. As in Philo, Heraclitus is regarded as the originatorof this concept. Although no exact parallel of the PhilonicLogos-Cutter (ina demiurgic sense) prior to Philo can be found, Heraclitus does mentiona spiritual principle which he callslogos(the origin of the Stoic doctrine),and which contributes to world-order by combining opposites rather likePhilo’sLogosdoes atHer.199–200:60τὴν δὲ τούτων ἐμμελ ῆσύνθεσίν τε καὶ κρᾶσιν τὸ πρεσβύτατον καὶ τελειό-τατον ἔργον ἅγιον ὡς ἀληθῶς εἶναι συμβέβηκε,τὸν κόσμον,ὃν διὰ συμ-βόλου τοῦ θυμιάματος οἴεται δεῖν εὐχαριστεῖν τῷ πεποιηκότι,ἵνα λόγῳμὲν ἡ μυρεψικῇ τέχνῃ κατασκευασθεῖσα σύνθεσις ἐκθυμιᾶται,ἔργῳ δὲὁ θείᾳ σοφίᾳ δημιουργηθεὶς κόσμος ἅπας ἀναφέρηται πρωὶ καὶ δειλινῆςὁλοκαυτούμενος.60Fr.1ap.

However, Philo stresses that this mixture is harmonious,which is clearly not the case in theTimaeus, compounded as it is of thepassive and the recalcitrant (Sameness and Difference). Indeed, atHer.214and QG.iii.5, Philo points out that Heraclitus’ cosmology sharessimilarities with that of Moses. In the Hermetic tradition there is alsoaLogos-Cutter of sorts; Poimandres, who produces the cosmos throughdifferentiation, and Hermes who is a combined Truth andLogosfigure.Philo’s mention of Heraclitus does not indicate that he was father ofa doctrine involving theLogos-Cutter. One can only conclude that theLogos-CutterisanoriginalcontributionofPhilo’sorheacquireditfromaHellenistic Jewish source. One can seen how he could have arrived at theidea, through considering the creative activity of the Demiurge in termsof the Platonic procedure ofdiairesisand stimulated by the division of theanimals atGen.15:10.The division of theLogos-Cutter should not be viewed as a crude cre-ational mechanism. As Radice has shown, theLogosengages in a verycomplex process.61(1) It engages in actual division (Her.133–40). (2)Itengages in a secondary, equalising division (Her.141–200). (3) Mediation(Her.201–6) is followed by (4) the placing of the divided components(Her.207–29) and finally (5) the non-division of noetic reality (Her.230–6). This creation is part of a whole sequence of the ordered and proportionalconstruction of subordinate structures. For example, the heavy cosmic sub-stance becomes separated into earth (dry) and water (wet), while the lightforms air (cold) and fire (hot). Earth is divided into continents and islands,while water is drinkable and undrinkable. This reveals not just a continualdivision of cosmic substance, but a logical division that itself is responsiblefor cosmic structure.62In this sense, theLogosis a mediator, not just between the First Principleand the rest of creation, but an equaliser in terms of size (§§147–50; nightand day, the equinoxes, both poles etc.) as well as in terms of proportion(§§152f.; between the four elements in the cosmos or between the four61Radice:1989,6762Radice:1989,70presents a schema detailing the symmetrical structure inherent in this division bytheLogos."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"56Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of Alexandriaconstituent factors, dry, wet, cold and hot, in Man). This can, naturally,be viewed as a development of the notion of creation as a transition fromdisorder to order expressed atTim.30a(cf.Her.133) and unity based uponthe harmony of proportions reflected atTim.31a–32a. To a great extentthis notion of division is also echoed atSoph.253d–e, in the distinction ofdifferent classes of things through the practice of dialectic.This structured approach to creation by division is a metaphysical neces-sity in Philo’s scheme. Although Philo does not recognise an atom, in thesense of a particle which cannot be further divided, he does recognise theabsurdity of an infinite division on the part of theLogos. For this reasonintellects and noetic reality are not divided by theLogos.63Philo finds Bibli-cal justification for this approach in the comment on Abraham’s sacrifice atGen.15:10: ‘but the birds he did not divide’. I think that this is what Philomeans when he states that theLogos‘never ceases to divide, for when it hasgone through all sensible objects down to the atoms and what are calledindivisibles, it begins from them again to divide those things contemplatedby reason into inexpressible and indescribable parts’ (Her.26). By thingscontemplated by reason, Philo is not referring to the noetic realm, ratherparticles which although they may not be humanly divisible can still bereduced by theLogos.This system of creation is complemented by agricultural imagery atDe Plantatione.64This is drawn from the notion of God as a cultivatoratRep.x.597c–d8. The cosmos can be considered like a living creatureor farm which requires continual tending on the part of God. However,this image is not a model for an alternative type of creation, but only analternative explanation of creation: it is still essentially an account detailingtransition from disorder to order (εἰς τάξιν ἐξ ἀταξίας,Plant.3). If the earthis composed of the heavier elements (water and earth) at the centre, andthe lighter ones (water and fire) at the exterior, this leads to the questionof how these elements do not neutralise one another through their closeproximity.65This is the effect of the mediating presence of theLogos.6663Radice:1989,7564Plant.2–3:ὁ μὲν τοίνυν τῶν φυτουργῶν μέγιστος καὶ τὴν τέχνην τελειότατος ὁ τῶν ὅλων ἡγεμώνἐστι,φυτὸν δὲ αὖ περιέχον ἐν ἑαυτῷ τὰ ἐν μέρει φυτὰ ἅμα παμμυρία καθάπερ κληματίδας ἐκ μιᾶςἀναβλαστάνοντα ῥίζης ὅδε ὁ κόσμος...‘The greatest of all cultivators and the most perfect in his craftsmanship is the ruler of the universeand his plant does not only consist within itself of individual plants, but rather myriads of them,shooting forth like vine-shoots from a single root, that is the cosmos’.65Plant.4–966Plant.8:...λόγος δὲ ὁ ἀίδιος θεοῦ τοῦ αἰωνίου τὸ ὀχυρώτατον καὶ βεβαιότατον ἔρεισμα τῶνὅλων ἐστίν.‘ . . . and it is the eternalLogosof the eternal God, the most solid and the firmest support of thewhole’."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"TheLogosand theLogos-Cutter57De Opificio MundiTheDe Opificio Mundiis Philo’s most detailed account of creation. Essen-tially, this treatise can be viewed as attempting to rewrite theTimaeusinterms of the cosmology ofGenesis. Philo attempts to show how the originalgreat cosmological account was compiled by Moses, superior to that of thephilosophers, not only on account of its antiquity,67but also because itwas based upon divine revelation. Runia suggests that the philosophical (asopposed to thematic) influence of theTimaeusis weaker than that of otherdialogues (such as theRepublic,theSymposiumand thePhaedrus).68Thisis evident from the system expounded here which does not envisage anyrole for the Platonic World-Soul. Part of this eclipse of theTimaeusmaystem from Philo’s aversion to the use of myth when discussing God, whichhe shares with other Hellenistic–Jewish writers.69Philo is also opposedto what he regards as a Chaldean view of the cosmos (cosmos-worship),which is also to be found in Platonists such as Numenius.70The main problem which Philo faces is trying to reconcile temporalcreatio ex nihilowith Greek philosophy which could not countenance sucha position. AtGen.3:9, it does not seem that Man has come into beingfrom nothing: ‘for dust thou art, and into dust shalt thou return’ and againatGen.2: ‘And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life.’ However, at2Macc.7:3and7:8creatio ex nihilois envisaged; the majority of modern scholars interpretGen.1as referring tocreatio ex nihiloalso.71O’Neill argues that Philobelieved increatio ex nihilobased upon his comments atDe Deo7–8,where it is clear that God produces matter, all of which he transforms intothe various elements.7267It is a well-known observation that in antiquity the older a belief, the greater the authority whichit commanded.Cf. Boys-Stones:2001.68Runia:1986,3369Spec.i.28–31where Philo rejects the gods whom the makers of myth have deceived people with.Cf.Aristobulus frg.2,(10.2), JosephusAnt.i.14.70Abr.69–70Χαλδαῖοι γὰρ...τὴν ὁρατὴν οὐσίαν ἐσέμνυνον τῆς ἀοράτου καὶ νοητῆς οὐ λαβόντεςἔννοιαν,ἀλλὰ τὴν ἐν ἐκείνοις τάξιν διερευνώμενοι...καὶ κατὰ τὴν τῶν οὐρανίων πρὸς τὰ ἐπίγειασυμπάθειαν τὸν κόσμον αὐτὸν ὑπέλαβον εἶναι θεόν,οὐκ εὐαγῶς τὸ γενόμενον ἐξομοιώσαντες τῷπεποιηκότι.‘the Chaldeans magnified visible being and they did not consider what is unseen and intelligible,but in investigating the arrangment of numbers . . . and the sympathy between heaven and earth,they assumed that the cosmos was a god and impiously assimilated what had been generated to theone who generated.’71O’Neill:2002,45372O’ Neill:2002,462, goes on to argue thatcreatio ex nihilohad already been established as a credalstatement by the time of the New Testament. e.g.John1:3‘All things were made by [theLogos]andwithout him was not even one of the things that exist made.’"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"58Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of AlexandriaPhilo resolves this tension betweencreatio ex nihiloand Greek phi-losophy by putting forward a defence akin to that initially advanced bySpeusippus and Xenocrates, that God generated (from eternity) the intel-ligible archetypes,73which are the contents of His Intellect (Logos), whichare then projected onto matter. This is atemporal ‘for we must think ofGod as doing all things simultaneously’.74The sequence is a logical one,with heaven listed first because it ranks first in degree of excellence. Philoclaims that on the first day theκόσμος νοητόςwas created. Being allotted anentire day merely to create the intelligible world helps to stress a degree ofseparation from the visible cosmos (it seems that this is the underlying rea-son behind the semantic debate concerning the first day and day one). Toa great extent, Philo is absolved from the necessity of presenting the mech-anism of God’s creative activity; merely His Will suffices (which cannot beunderstood by man). However, this does not prevent Philo from providinga detailed analysis in order to render this creative activity comprehensibleto the faithful.It is no coincidence, however, that God should be said to have createdthe cosmos in six days.ἕξ δὲ ἡμέραις δημιουργηθῆναί φησι τὸν κόσμον,οὐκ ἐπειδὴ προσεδεῖτοχρόνων μήκους ὁ ποιῶν–ἅμα γὰρ πάντα δρᾶν εἰκὸς θεόν,οὐ προστάτ-τοντα μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ διανοούμενον–,ἀλλ’ἐπειδὴ τοῖς γινομένοις ἔδειτάξεως.τάξει δὲ ἀριθμὸς οἰκεῖον,ἀριθμῶν δὲ φύσεως νόμοις γεννητικώτα-τος ὁ ἕξ·He says that the cosmos was generated in six days, not because the makerrequired a duration of time – for it is reasonable that God did everythingsimultaneously, not only in commanding but also in intelligising, – butbecause order was necessary for the things being generated. Number isnative to order and according to the laws of nature, six is the most generativenumber. (Opif.13).Moses’ indication that the cosmos was created in six days underpinsthe rational structure which underlies it. Philo draws upon Pythagoreannumerology to illustrate that it is the first perfect number, since it is theproduct of its factors (1×2×3=6), as well as their sum (1+2+3=6). It is also the sum of its half, its third and its sixth (3+2+1=6).75Itis a combination of the odd (3was considered the first odd number) andthe even (2), as well as of male (3) and female (2). In this way6indicatesthe bountiful nature of the cosmos, since the male and the female are nec-essary for its perpetuation. The fact that the world was created in six days73Dillon:2003a,1074Opif.1375Opif.13"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"TheLogosand theLogos-Cutter59indicates its perfection and that it consists of all possibilities. Just as Platodoes, Philo views the cosmos as a wondrous production emanating fromGod’s goodness.76It is worth noting that the Judaic cosmogony is the onlyone in the ancient world which envisaged creation as taking place in sixdays. In this context, it is possible that comments such as that expressed atTheol. Arith.50.8–10: ‘Because the perfection of the cosmos falls under thesix, the excellence of the demiurgic god is rightly thought to be hexadic’,or indeed the Pseudo-Iamblichean tradition concerning the six may owesomething to Philo.While the creation in six days is Judaic, the work processes of Philo’sdivine creator are Platonic:προλαβὼν γὰρ ὁ θεὸς ἅτε θεὸς ὅτι μίμημα καλὸν οὐκ ἄν ποτε γένοιτο δίχακαλοῦ παραδείγματος οὐδέ τι τῶν αἰσθητῶν ἀνυπαίτιον,ὃ μὴ πρὸς ἀρχέ-τυπον καὶ νοητὴν ἰδέαν ἀπεικονίσθη,βουληθεὶς τὸν ὁρατὸν κόσμον του-τονὶ δημιουργῆσαι προεξετύπου τὸν νοητόν,ἵνα χρώμενος ἀσωμάτῳ καὶθεοειδεστάτῳ παραδείγματι τὸν σωματικὸν ἀπεργάσηται,πρεσβυτέρουνεώτερον ἀπεικόνισμα,τοσαῦτα περιέξοντα αἰσθητὰ γένη ὅσαπερ ἐνἐκείνῳ νοητά.For God, since he is God, anticipated that a beautiful copy would not comeabout without a beautiful model and that none of the sense-perceptiblethings would be blameless, if it was not modelled upon the archetypaland intelligible form and having decided to fabricate the invisible cos-mos beforehand, in order that he might employ it as an incorporealparadigm, most similar to God, and bring to perfection the corporealworld, a younger representation of an older exemplar, which encompassesas many sense-perceptible kinds as there are intelligible kinds in the othercosmos. (Opif.16).Even though it is a central tenet of Platonic philosophy that a noeticrealm exists, Philo here regards it as something which his all-powerfulcreator cannot do without.77Of course, the Demiurge’s dependence upon76σπείρει μὲν οὖν οὗτος,τὸ δὲ γέννημα τὸ ἴδιον,ὃἔσπειρε,δωρεῖται·γεννᾷ γὰρ ὁ θεὸς οὐδὲν αὑτῷ,χρεῖος ἅτε ὢν οὐδενός,πάντα δὲ τῷ λαβεῖν δεομένῳ.‘Therefore God sows, but what is generated, He gives as a gift, for God does not generate anythingon his own account, for He does not require anything, but everything is for the sake of the oneneeding to receive it.’Cher.44(cf.Leg.

It is noteworthy that Philo, as a Jewishphilosopher, adopts this notion, since such a model is not found inGenesis(though the Torah in the rabbinic tradition is sometimes portrayed asGod’s model). This illustrates that we really are discussing demiurgy here,as opposed to merely parallel speculations regarding the origin of the world.Furthermore, Philo does break away from the imagery frequently found inPlatonism which assigns a specific location (supra- and sublunar) to eachof the two realms. This leads Philo to introduce his famous comparison ofthe Demiurge with a king founding a city atOpif.17. Once the king hasdecided upon construction, the architect mentally draws up the plans. Themeans by which he replicates this mental conception in the material realmechoes what the Demiurge accomplishes.78TheLogos, then, contains thenoetic realm, as the mind of the Demiurge, but it is not true to state thatit has a physical place.79This is the world of Forms as God is actuallyengaged in creation, but as Philo considers God as continually engaging inthe process of creation, no fine distinction need be made concerning thispoint.80Philo blurs the distinction between the king and the architect. This maybe an attempt to preserve God’s transcendence. Another reason may bethat he did not wish to open speculation concerning an ontological chainof demiurgic intermediaries. It indicates that the function of Demiurgedoes not exhaust God’s being; it is only one of his roles. Philo drew adistinction between God asθεόςand asκύριος.81Secondly, Philo presentsthe architect as envisaging the future city mentally, when in point of fact he78Opif.18:εἶθ’ὥσπερ ἐν κηρῷ τῇ ἑαυτοῦ ψυχῇ τοὺς ἑκάστων δεξάμενος τύπους ἀγαλματοφορεῖνοητὴν πόλιν,ἧς ἀνακινήσας τὰ εἴδωλα μνήμῃ τῇ συμφύτῳ καὶ τοὺς χαρακτῆρας ἔτι μᾶλλονἐνσφραγισάμενος,οἷα δημιουργὸς ἀγαθός,ἀποβλέπων εἰς τὸ παράδειγμα τὴν ἐκ λίθων καὶ ξύλωνἄρχεται κατασκευάζειν,ἑκάστῃ τῶν ἀσωμάτων ἰδεῶν τὰς σωματικὰς ἐξομοιῶν οὐσίας.‘Then taking up in his own soul the impressions of each object, just as if in wax, he carries thenoetic city as an image. Stirring up the images by means of his ingrained memory and stampingtheir features (in his soul) to a still greater extent, just like a good craftsman Demiurge, lookingat the model, he begins to build from stone and wood, making sure that the corporeal substancescorrespond to each of the incorporeal Forms.’79Opif.2080Opif.24:...τὸν νοητὸν κόσμον εἶναι ἢ θεοῦ λόγον ἤδη κοσμοποιοῦντος·οὐδὲ γὰρ ἡ νοητὴ πόλιςἕτερόν τί ἐστιν ἢ ὁ τοῦ ἀρχιτέκτονος λογισμὸς ἤδη τὴν[νοητὴν]πόλιν κτίζειν διανοουμένου.‘ . . . the noetic cosmos is simply theLogosofGodasheisengagedintheprocessofmakingthecosmos; for the noetic city is nothing other than the architect’s calculation, as he is contemplatingthe foundation of the [noetic] city.’81Runia:1986discusses Philo’s notion ofκατάχρησις– misuse of language, usually applied in relationto God.

However, this would not suit Philo’s contentionthat the noetic realm does not occupy physical space. Philo’s Demiurge isupwardly mobile with this promotion to architect, perhaps in response tosniping comments passed by other philosophical groups.82The reason for creation is God’s beneficence. The explanation for theapparently uneven distribution of goods is that God confers them in pro-portion to the capacity of the recipient.83Knowledge of God’s essence wasnot even granted to Moses: ‘You shall see what is behind me but my faceyou shall not see’ (Ex.33:18–23).

(Opif.23)This is similar to the situation regarding matter, which has to partakeof God’s goodness in order to sustain the weight of creation. Philo usesPlato’s argument that the cosmos can only be beautiful if the Demiurgefollows an immutable model. There is an important distinction, however,between Philo’s ‘noetic cosmos’ and Plato’s Forms. Plato’s model seemsonly to consist ofgeneraandspecies(but not the totality of creation, whichappears to be the case with Philo). Although the question of the Formshas already been dealt with above, here I wish to revisit the relationshipbetween the ideal world and the Demiurge. It is clear, given the image ofthe architect, that Philo’s Demiurge is actually involved in the design ofthe cosmos, though it is unclear whether this is the case with the Demiurgein theTimaeus(most probably not, since the model is pre-existent). The82For example the Epicurean at CiceroND.19mockingly states ‘By what insight of the soul was yourPlato able to imagine such a great process of craftsmanship, by means of which God constructedthe world? What contrivances, what iron implements, what levers and cranes and what attendantswere used for such great walls?’83Opif.23"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"62Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of Alexandriaimage of the seal imprinting itself upon matter as upon wax introducedat §16reinforces the image of matter as a passive recipient of the Forms,rather than as a principle in its own right.The theme of the inexhaustibility of God suggests that Philo envisageddivine infinitude. This is clearly not the case with the limited but well-intentioned Demiurge of theTimaeusor the god of Aristotle. Divineinfinitude first emerges in developed form in Gregory of Nyssa, who washeavily influenced by Philo (though Plotinus would recognise the infinitudeof divine potency).84This is related to the ‘overdose of being’ suggested atSpec.i.43–4in relation to Moses’ desire to see God.85The mechanism of creationPhilo reserves the right to interpret the Biblical account of creation in anon-literal fashion. ‘Beginning’ does not have a temporal sense. His viewsatOpif.26are compatible with bothcreatio simultaneaandcreatio aeterna.86In favour ofcreatio simultanea, one can point to §§7–12which makes muchbetter sense in terms of a simultaneous temporal beginning of the cosmosand of time itself. Secondly, atAet.14, Philo is opposed to a non-literalinterpretive tradition of theTimaeus. As Radice comments, this type ofcreation is a necessary postulate in order to remove anthropomorphismfrom the image of God, as well as quashing the possibility of an idle84For divine infinitude in Gregory of Nyssa, seeCE1.167–71. Kees-Geijon:2005,152points outthat in the Greek philosophical tradition infinity (which by its very nature is undetermined andtherefore imperfect) is not predicated of the highest being. For further discussion on this topic,cf.M ̈uhlenberg:1966.85χαρίζομαι δ’ἐγὼ τὰ οἰκεῖα τῷ ληψομένῳ·οὐ γὰρ ὅσα μοι δοῦναι ῥᾴδιον καὶ ἀνθρώπῳ λαβεῖνδυνατόν·ὅθεν ὀρέγω τῷ χάριτος ἀξίῳ πάσας ὅσας ἂν οἷός τε ᾖ δέξασθαι δωρεάς.τὴν δ’ἐμὴνκατάληψιν οὐχ οἷον ἀνθρώπου φύσις ἀλλ’οὐδ’ὁ σύμπας οὐρανός τε καὶ κόσμος δυνήσεταιχωρῆσαι.‘I graciously give what is in accordance with the one who receives.

God mightcontinually have a demiurgic role to fulfil, but creation is also simultaneous‘for we must think of God as doing all things simultaneously’.89The creation which God engages in throughoutOpif.evokes the divisionof theLogos-Cutter delineated inHer. The primary division is betweenheaven and earth, followed by air and void and then water, spirit and light.90A subsequent division between light and darkness produces day and night.91Light and darkness appear to be physically confined to particular regionsof the cosmos. By void here, Philo implies (following Plato and Aristotle)that the cosmos occupies all available physical space.92Philo opposes theStoic notion of extra-cosmic void (to accommodate for fluctuations inthe size of the cosmos) atHer.228. The seven items listed in the initialcreation include the four elements (heaven=fire). Void is the PlatonicReceptacle; Philo clarifies that it is created by God, unlike Plato who leavesthis point vague. Since the Forms and the void into which these Formsare instantiated are both created by God, matter must also be a product ofGod. Philo, however, does not actually explicitly identify the Receptaclewith the void.God then creates the firmament, a situation which proves problematicfor Philo since he is unable to reconcile his Hellenised cosmology with theMosaic version. AtHer.283–4, Philo considers the nature of the materialwhich forms the heavens:τὰ μὲν σωματικὰ ταῦτα,τὸ δὲ νοερὸν καὶ οὐράνιον τῆς ψυχῆς γένοςπρὸς αἰθέρα τὸν καθαρώτατον ὡς πατέρα ἀφίξεται.πέμπτη γάρ,ὡςὁ τῶν ἀρχαίων λόγος,ἔστω τις οὐσία κυκλοφορητική,τῶν τεττάρωνκατὰ τὸ κρεῖττον διαφέρουσα,ἐξ ἧς οἵ τε ἀστέρες καὶ ὁ σύμπας οὐρανὸςἔδοξε γεγενῆσθαι,ἧς κατ’ἀκόλουθον θετέον καὶ τὴν ἀνθρωπίνην ψυχὴνἀπόσπασμα.93These belong to the body, but the nature of the soul, which is noetic andcelestial, will seek a father in the purest aether.

More interesting ishis assertion that the soul is a fragment of heaven; this is a rather weakerform of the Gnostic view that the soul was a trapped fragment of thegodhead.Again atOpif.36, Philo runs into difficulties in trying to make theMosaic account compatible with a hellenised cosmology.95Philo cannotfit waters above and below the firmament into a hellenised version and sosimply ignores this aspect of the Biblical account. There is no place forsupracosmic waters, since this region is already occupied by the heavenlybodies. However, Philo mentions water subsequently (atOpif.38) portray-ing it as a sort of cosmic ‘glue’ (κόλλα), which is able to bind togetheropposed elements. This is the nearest that Philo gets to positing moisturethat lies beneath the cosmos.The Demiurge creates by apportioning everything in due measure.Philo’s description of the sweet water here, which has been separated fromits salty counterpart and which goes on to form the sea, echoes this divisionof water into sweet and salty elsewhere (e.g. atHer.136orSomn.i.18). Thenotion of the moisture retained by earth as a binding element was commonin Greek philosophy e.g. Aristotle,Meteor.4.4.382b (citing Empedocles) orPlotinus,Enn.ii1[40]6. It is, however, missing fromGenesis. Philo drawsupon Greek philosophy as a means of ‘modernising’ the Mosaic account. Asimilar parallel can be found atDeus35–6, where cohesion (ἕξις, the mostbasic kind of Stoic cohesion) is only one mechanism by which God holds94None of this is particularly original. Heraclides of Pontus in the Old Academy had declared soulsto be composed of aether, the substance of the stars, while Xenocrates also accepted aether as a fifthsubstance.95ὁ μὲν οὖν ἀσώματος κόσμος ἤδη πέρας εἶχεν ἱδρυθεὶς ἐν τῷ θείῳ λόγῳ,ὁδ’αἰσθητὸς πρὸςπαράδειγμα τούτου ἐτελειογονεῖτο.καὶ πρῶτον αὐτοῦ τῶν μερῶν,ὃ δὴ καὶ πάντων ἄριστον,ἐποίει τὸν οὐρανὸν ὁ δημιουργός,ὃν ἐτύμως στερέωμα προσηγόρευσεν ἅτε σωματικὸν ὄντα·τὸγὰρ σῶμα φύσει στερεόν,ὅτιπερ καὶ τριχ ῆδιαστατόν·‘For the incorporeal cosmos had been formed and settled in the divineLogos, but the perceptiblecosmos was being perfected according to the incorporeal model.

This could be theLogos, since Philo refers to it as‘the glue and the bond’ (Her.188) or the ‘unbreakable bond of the universe’(Plant.9).The creation of plants and animals is treated atOpif.42–3. God createsthese merely by ordering it. Philo, in keeping with theGenesisaccount,posits the creation of animals prior to that of Man, rather than viewing itas a secondary creation to provide Man with what is necessary for survival.This later forces him to justify the location of the creation of Man in hisaccount.ὁ μὲν δὴ προστάττει τῇ γῇ ταῦτα γεννῆσαι·ἡδ’ὥσπερ ἐκ πολλοῦ κυο-φοροῦσα καὶ ὠδίνουσα,τίκτει πάσας μὲν τὰς σπαρτῶν,πάσας δὲ τὰςδένδρων,ἔτι δὲ καρπῶν ἀμυθήτους ἰδέας.ἀλλ’οὐ μόνον ἦσαν οἱ καρποὶτροφαὶ ζῴοις,ἀλλὰ καὶ παρασκευαὶ πρὸς τὴν τῶν ὁμοίων ἀεὶ γένεσιν,τὰςσπερματικὰς οὐσίας περιέχοντες,ἐν αἷς ἄδηλοι καὶ ἀφανεῖς οἱ λόγοι τῶνὅλων εἰσί,δῆλοι καὶ φανεροὶ γινόμενοι καιρῶν περιόδοις.He commanded the earth to generate these things and just as if it had beenpregnant for a long time and was in labour, it gave birth to all sown plants,and to every sort of tree and to unspeakable types of fruit. But the fruit wasnot only food for living animals, but it was prepared for the continuousgeneration of its kind and it contained substances in the form of a seed, inwhich the invisible and unseen ordering principles of the whole living thingis found, and they become visible and manifest as the seasons progress.The earth appears to be like a machine which can just keep functioning onceit has been installed without too much direct intervention by God. Thespermatikoi logoimentioned by Philo are a Stoic innovation. They regardedthe seed as containing the generic pattern necessary for the continuedreproduction of the organism, although it could not be seen and hadto be logically inferred. Philo mentions this theory elsewhere atLeg. All.iii.150andDe Animalibus20and96.96τῶν γὰρ σωμάτων τὰ μὲν ἐνεδήσατο ἕξει,τὰ δὲ φύσει,τὰ δὲ ψυχῇ,τὰ δὲ λογικῇ ψυχῇ.λίθωνμὲν οὖν καὶ ξύλων,ἃ δὴ τῆς συμφυΐας ἀπέσπασται,δεσμὸν κραταιότατον ἕξιν εἰργάζετο·ἡδέἐστι πνεῦμα ἀναστρέφον ἐφ’ἑαυτό·ἄρχεται μὲν γὰρ ἀπὸ τῶν μέσων ἐπὶ τὰ πέρατα τείνεσθαι,ψαῦσαν δὲ ἄκρας ἐπιφανείας ἀνακάμπτει πάλιν,ἄχρις ἂν ἐπὶ τὸν αὐτὸν ἀφίκηται τόπον,ἀφ’οὗτὸ πρῶτον ὡρμήθη·‘For He bound some of the bodies by means of cohesion, and others by the principle of growth,and still others by soul or rational soul.

The creation of heavenon the fourth day has considerable metaphysical significance, especiallysince it can be equated with the nature of the solid (Opif.49). It is this orderwhich reveals the beauty inherent in creation. The importance of four in theGreek philosophical tradition is illustrated by the comment of Alexander ofAphrodisias (Comm. in. Met.38.10–16)thatδικαιοσύνη(usually ‘justice’,but here probably ‘fairness’) could be found in numbers, and four was thefirst number equal to the multiplication of itself.97Therefore, four can beidentified with equality (as it was by the Pythagoreans) and, by extension,it indicates the fair distribution God engaged in during creation. Philomentions the mathematical properties of the four atOpif.51, and althoughhe does not explicitly identify it withδικαιοσύνη, the tradition seems tohave been too well known for him not to have been conscious of it whenhe introduced it in this context. At §89–128, this numerical symbolism isexpanded further, when Philo begins to discuss the merits of the numberseven. At §97, he comments that it represents the right-angled triangle thatis theἀρχή(‘starting-point’) of the (Timaean) universe. The significanceof the number seven is stressed by the fact that it ‘neither begets noris begotten’ (§100). Philo means that seven is a prime number which isincapable of generating any philosophically important number.There are seven zones of heaven (§112). The῎Α ρ κ τ ο ςthe most importantconstellation for navigation, is composed of seven stars (§114). Like six,seven contains the universe because it is composed of three (irregularity)and four (disorder) (§97). There are seven parts of the visible body andseven viscera (§118). There are seven parts of the head and seven entrancesandexitsfromthebody(§119; an allusion toTim.75d).Thisissomewhatexpedient, though, since the mouth is the source of three: entrance forfood and drink and the exit for words. Following theTimaeus, there areseven motions. The Latin word for seven,septem, is etymologised by Philoas a derivation ofσεμνός(reverend) andσεβασμός(reverence).This is a combination of Philo’s attempt to illustrate rational designin the cosmos, along with the importance of the number seven in Jewishculture. Plato glimpsed the truth in assessing numerical importance, butPhilo utilises Judaic ‘wisdom-figures’ in addition to Plato’s Pythagoreanones. Seven is important because it symbolises theLogosof God.98AsRunia notes, although Philo introduces theτόποςof the rational order ofcreation, this remains subordinate to the theme of God’s beneficence.99For97Runia:1986,19498Dillon:1977,16099Runia:1986,199"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The creation of man67example, atOpif.53, he introduces the Timaean motif of the creation ofthe heavenly bodies in order to encourage mankind to engage in the studyof philosophy.On day five, Philo alters the Biblical version of the creation of landanimals, ignoring the division into two days. He prefers to allocate day sixto the creation of the cosmos in its entirety, rather than to completion of thecreation of land animals. It is not immediately apparent what would remainfor God to create on day six, since everything by this stage would appear tohave already approached completion. Runia regards Philo’s anthropocentricemphasis as responsible for this alteration, since it allows him to set thehuman creation apart from that of other land animals.100It is worth notingthat Philo regards animals as having been designed to fit the environmentin which they live and the first generation enters the world at the periodof reproductive maturity.His creational sequence has a different structure to Plato’s, which is oneof continual ontological descent (Young Gods, humans, creatures of thesky, land and finally sea). Philo is very vague concerning the actual beingscreated on the fifth and sixth days. AtQG1.19, he responds to the difficultyconcerning the double creation of days five and six. He is unwilling tocommit himself (his response begins with ‘perhaps’), but proposes thatduring the preceding six days, only incorporeal, generic images (ἰδέαι)ofanimals were created, and on the final day, the sensible likeness is produced.The creation of manMan, as he is physically created, is inferior to the blueprint from which hehas been made. Man is made not ‘in the image of God’, but after this image.The similarity which man shares with God is not one of the body, sinceGod should not be envisaged as adopting a physical form.101Rather, thenotion that man is made in the ‘image of God’ means that he is modelledon the mind or intellect of God.102It is unclear what sort of creation Philoregards as taking place. Is man created in one fell swoop, or is only theintellect created and then inserted from outside (similar to the insertionof the soul into the heavenly bodies posited later by Origen)? This doublecreation would parallel that posited by Philo in the case of animals. Mostprobably, the difficulty in understanding Philo’s account stems from thesource text, with the double account of creation atGen.1:26–7and againat2:7.100Runia:1986,211101Opif.69102Her.231"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"68Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of AlexandriaPhiloconsidersthequestionofwhyGoddidnotmakemanonhisownatOpif.72. The problem is introduced by the Septuagint passage ‘Let us makeman (ποιήσωμεν ἄνθρωπον)’.103Evidently, God does not actually requirehelp to create man. He has, after all, already single-handedly constructedthe entire cosmos. Philo solves this problem by pointing out that there arethree categories of created beings (§73): plants and animals which partakeneither of goodness or evil, other creatures, such as the heavenly beings,which are good only, and humanity, which possesses a mixed nature. Onaccount of this, it is not completely appropriate that God should makeman.This differs from the generation of man in theTimaeus.Thereissomesimilarity withTim.42d where the Demiurge does not produce mansingle-handedly because otherwise man would be immortal, and becausethe Demiurge does not wish to be responsible for man’s immorality. How-ever, the Platonic Demiurge profits from the opportunity to announce hisretirement (Tim.42e5–6). God, on the other hand, calls upon unnamedassistants, but does not sub-contract the task. Plato’s Demiurge is onlyresponsible for the rational soul, while the irrational soul and the body areproduced by the Young Gods. In Philo, there is no clear division of labour.Indeed, God could conceivably play a role in the creation of the humanbody, though Winston argues that God is not responsible for anythingcorporeal.104Yet God (through the agency of hisLogos) still creates the mortal generaof the fifth and sixth days and he is responsible for the human body atGen.2:7. If it is not beneath God’s dignity to create animals, then thereis no reason why He might not create the human body. (Philo’s statementconcerning morality appears unsatisfactory, since God can claim completecredit for a lower order of life, but only partial praise for a higher one,although this is a highly ‘speciesist’ argument.) Philo does not go intographic detail of which body part was created by which entity, as can befound in certain Gnostic texts. From the context, though, it would not beforcing the issue to conclude that the element in man which is capable ofengaging in evil activities cannot be the product of God. The assistants oftheTimaeusare the planetary gods; in Philo they are unnamed. There isno reason for assuming that Philo is following Plato here.

For example,Fossum thought that attributing a portion of the creation of the humanbody to angels indicates that they are a source of evil.106It is true that theactual human co-created by God and the angels is inferior to the archetypalone envisaged by God himself, but it is important to note that this is a partof the divine plan, not the result of some sort of conspiracy on the partof the angels. Unfortunately, God’s reason for not realising the superiordesign (the provision of something which can be blamed for the morallyincorrect choices which humans engage in) does not seem to be particularlypraiseworthy.107Philo provides a detailed outline of the creation of earthly man:μετὰ δὲ ταῦτά φησιν ὅτι‘ἔπλασεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον χοῦν λαβὼν ἀπὸτῆς γῆς,καὶ ἐνεφύσησεν εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πνοὴν ζωῆς’(Gen.2:7).ἐναργέστατα καὶ διὰ τούτου παρίστησιν ὅτι διαφορὰ παμμεγέθης ἐστὶ τοῦτε νῦν πλασθέντος ἀνθρώπου καὶ τοῦ κατὰ τὴν εἰκόνα θεοῦ γεγονότοςπρότερον·ὁ μὲν γὰρ διαπλασθεὶς αἰσθητὸς ἤδη μετέχων ποιότητος,ἐκσώματος καὶ ψυχῆς συνεστώς,ἀνὴρ ἢ γυνή,φύσει θνητός·ὁ δὲ κατὰ τὴνεἰκόνα ἰδέα τις ἢ γένος ἢ σφραγίς,νοητός,ἀσώματος,οὔτ’ἄρρεν οὔτεθῆλυ,ἄφθαρτος φύσει.He says that after this ‘God moulded a human taking mud from the earthand He breathed the breath of life into his face’ (Gen.2:7). By this, heillustrates most clearly that there is an immense difference between thehuman moulded at this stage and the one previously generated in the imageof God. For the one who has been moulded as sense-perceptible, shares inquality and has been composed of body and soul, is man or woman, andis mortal by nature. But the one produced according to the image is a sortof idea or genus or seal; it is apprehended by intellect and is without body,neither male or female, by nature immortal. (Opif.134).105There is a Judaeo–Christian association of the angels with the planets, seen in the beliefin seven archangels, a view related to the fact that there were seven known planets at thetime.106Runia:1986,238.Cf.

The distinction here is notbetween a rational and irrational component in man, but rather betweenthe archetype and the prototype. AtConf.179, Philo avoids interpretingthis collaboration in terms of the production of parts of the soul, althoughatFug.69, he regards God as responsible for creating the rational part,while the powers make the (presumably irrational) subordinate part.Conf.171–4also mentions three possible collaborators with God; his powers, theheavenly bodies or the angels.Philo lists four possible explanations for mankind’s late creation. Thefirst is that all the necessities of life might already be available (Opif.76–8).Secondly, an ethical lesson is provided, since when Man is in a state ofinnocence, there is an abundance of food. It is only once he falls from thisstate that he has to engage in agriculture (Opif.79–81). The third reasonis that creation is framed by the construction of heaven and of the humanbeing, who can be viewed as a miniature heaven. The final reason is thatMan is the king of creation and his sudden appearance at the final momentmight overawe the beasts. For Philo, the entire cosmos has been createdprincipally for the benefit of humanity (for example, he even suggeststhat the heavenly bodies were created earlier than mankind, so that theywould be available for mankind to contemplate when it was created). Inthis respect, he resembles Origen. Even though they accept the Hellenicsuperiority of the heavenly beings, Philo refers to the heavenly gods as God’sἔκγονοι, although here he is only following Plato’s lead atTim.41a–42d,but they still both regard the heavenly bodies as being created primarily inorder to serve humanity.Philo digresses into an excursus on the hebdomad atOpif.89–128,pro-vided with this opportunity by his account of the seventh day of creation.In fact, here again Philo diverges from the Biblical account. God does notcreate the world in seven days, but in six (and rests on the seventh,Gen.2:2–3), a situation ignored by Philo here (though not atLeg.All.i.5–7,16).108Instead, Philo posits the peculiar notion of the birthday of the cos-mos, which is inspired byGen.2:3(God blesses the cosmos) and whichmay be unique to him.109The Hebrew Bible differs from theSeptuagint,since atGen.2:2, it indicates that God only finished creating on the seventhday. As Runia notes, the Samaritan Pentateuch,Jubilees2.16,Vetus Latina108Runia:1986,257109The concept of a seven day week was unique to Judaism at this period and was only officiallyinstituted by the Emperor Constantine in321ad, though the third-century writer Censorinuscomposed a text concerning time entitledOn the Birthday."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The creation of man71and thePeshittahave the same reading as theSeptuagint.110This passage isparallel to the Demiurge’s retirement atTim.42e when he appears to abdi-cate responsibility to the Young Gods. AtLeg. All.1.5–7, Philo commentsthat Moses does not useἔπαυσατο(middle voice) which would imply thatGod is the one who rests, butκατέπαυσεν ᾧ ἤρξατο(active voice): ‘Hecaused to rest those (creatures) which He had begun.’111The seventh daywas given as a day of rest by God to His creatures, not something that Herequired Himself. Philo is influenced by the Aristotelian view that Godcan engage in endless activity and complete his tasks effortlessly. It is thisceaseless but effortlessἐνέργειαthat is God’s rest. Philo believes that whileGod’s creatorship does not exhaust His being, it is continuous.AtOpif.135, there is no mention of the anonymous collaborators assistingin the creation of the soul:τοῦ δ’αἰσθητοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ μέρους ἀνθρώπου τὴν κατασκευὴν σύνθετον εἶναίφησιν ἔκ τε γεώδους οὐσίας καὶ πνεύματος θείου·γεγενῆσθαι γὰρ τὸμὲν σῶμα,χοῦν τοῦ τεχνίτου λαβόντος καὶ μορφὴν ἀνθρωπίνην ἐξ αὐτοῦδιαπλάσαντος,τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν ἀπ’οὐδενὸς γενητοῦ τὸ παράπαν,ἀλλ’ἐκτοῦ πατρὸς καὶ ἡγεμόνος τῶν πάντων·ὃ γὰρ ἐνεφύσησεν,οὐδὲν ἦν ἕτερονἢ πνεῦμα θεῖον ἀπὸ τῆς μακαρίας καὶ εὐδαίμονος φύσεως ἐκείνης ἀποικίαντὴν ἐνθάδε στειλάμενον ἐπ’ὠφελείᾳ τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν,ἵν’εἰ καὶ θνητόνἐστι κατὰ τὴν ὁρατὴν μερίδα,κατὰ γοῦν τὴν ἀόρατον ἀθανατίζηται.He says that the sense-perceptible and differentiated human is constructedout of earthly substance and divine spirit; for the body was generated whenthe Craftsman took mud and shaped the human form from it, but thesoul was formed not from something that had been generated, but fromthe Father and leader of all things. For he breathed in nothing other thanthe divine breath, having moved its abode from that happy and prosperousnature in order to benefit our species, so that if its visible part is mortal, atleast the part which is unseen might be made immortal.Here again Philo is vague concerning the details of distribution of labourbetween God and his powers in the creation of the soul. Philo also breakswith Plato’s account, since it is evident that God plays a role in the creationof the human body, unlike the Demiurge of theTimaeus. Philo positsa dual creation; rather like the situation he envisages with the universeas a whole; hardly surprising given his Platonic conviction that Man is aminiature cosmos. This ‘double creation’ had a long career in the Platonic‘underworld’.112For example, the HermeticPoimandres(12–15) recountsthe creation first of Essential Man, before that of ordinary man. There110Runia:1986,267111trans. Runia:1986,257112Dillon:1977,176"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"72Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of Alexandriaare five main differences between the human created at this point and theone created earlier. One is created after the image of God (Gen.1:27), theother is moulded (Gen.2:7). The archetypal human is an object of thoughtwhile the other is an object of sense-perception. The first evidently is anarchetype as one of the Forms, while the second is an instantiation of theForm. The archetypal human is without sexual differentiation. Obviously,this is not the case for its younger counterpart. The archetype is immortal,while the later human, as a compound of body and soul, has only beenallotted a certain lifespan.113Whatever significance this set of contrasts mayhave meant to Philo, he does not elaborate.Another difficulty with interpreting this passage is identifying how manyhumans Philo envisages here. Some scholars posit a distinction between a‘plasmatic’ human at134and a ‘pneumatic’ one at135. For example, Baerposited three separate entities: generic heavenly man (the man after theimage), generic earthly man (the man moulded at134) and the first empir-ical man (emerges at135).114Radice identifies only two figures; ‘plasmatic’man who is the sense-perceptible counterpart of the heavenly archetypeand ‘pneumatic’ man, who is the individualisation of the generic Form.115Philo addresses this issue atQG4, where he draws a distinction betweensense-perceptible (‘moulded’) man and incorporeal man, made after theimage and a copy of the original seal, which he identifies with theLogos.God is said to have inbreathedπνεῦμα(135). The wordπνεῦμαwhichPhilo uses is a more scientific term thanπνοῆ. In Stoicism,πνεῦμαwasthe active divine principle which played a role in the structuring of matterand for Aristotle, it was a substance which allowed the soul to act upon thebody. It really is not a technical Platonic term at all. (When it is used inPlatonic circles, it is usually as a result of external influence.) Origen pickedup on this distinction atHom.Gen.i.13, where he claims that the humanmade after the image is not corporeal, since the shape of the body does not113This comes out in the context of man’s composite nature atHer.282–3:καθάπερ γὰρ ὀνόματα καὶῥήματα καὶ τὰ λόγου μέρη πάντα συνέστηκε μὲν ἐκ τῶν τῆς γραμματικῆς στοιχείων,ἀναλύεταιδὲ πάλιν εἰς ἔσχατα ἐκεῖνα,τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον ἕκαστος ἡμῶν συγκριθεὶς ἐκ τῶν τεττάρωνκαὶ δανεισάμενος ἀφ’ἑκάστης οὐσίας μικρὰ μόρια,καθ’ὡρισμένας περιόδους καιρῶν ἐκτίνει τὸδάνειον,εἰ μέν τι ξηρὸν εἴη,ἀποδιδοὺς γῇ,εἰ δέ τι ὑγρόν,ὕδατι,εἰ δὲ ψυχρόν,ἀέρι,εἰ δ’ἔνθερμον,πυρί.‘For in the same way that nouns and verbs and all parts of speech composed of the grammaticalelement once again are dissolved into the most primary of these, in the same way each of us iscompounded of the four primary elements and borrows a small portion of the substance fromeach one, and he pays this debt back in full at the end of the revolutions of time, that part of himthat is dry, he returns to earth, what is wet to water, what is cold to air and what is warm to fire.’114Baer:1970, especially Ch.2115Radice:1989"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The creation of man73contain the image of God, and the human is described as moulded, notmade.The soul enters man as a result of this inbreathing. However, atGig.6–18, in the case of subsequent generations, souls (which Philo identifieswith the angels of Moses and thedaimonesof the philosophers) can chose toeither remain in heaven, become sanctified and assist God in his governingof men, or to descend. Of these, the philosophers finally learn to releasethemselves from bodily concerns.116The original human being was superior to subsequent generations.117Philo supplies three reasons: (1) materialistic: since the earth had just beennewly separated from the sea, the material used to create man was thepurest possible. (2) teleological (Opif.137): God would not have taken thefirst piece of earth that came to hand, but would have located the bestpart ‘taking from pure matter the purest and utmost refined part whichwas especially suited for the construction’.118(3) theological (Opif.138):Philo regards this reason as being the most important. God constructedthe first man with the most perfect proportions, so that everything shouldform a symmetrical and harmonious whole. The soul is also excellent,since it is modelled on the divineLogos(Opif.139). Subsequent generationsare inferior, not in the Gnostic sense of having become corrupted by theArchons, but rather because a copy of a copy will always be inferior.Philo makes this point explicitly atQG2.62. The Father of the universedoes not serve as the model for anything mortal; it is the Second God,whom Philo equates with theLogos. Philo’s mention of a Second God, ofcourse, evokes the Numenian Second God, since the First God in bothcases remains absolutely transcendent. Furthermore, the Second God Philomentions here seems to have a demiurgic function, since it is the creatorof the rational element in the human soul. It is quite rare in Philo to findan explicit declaration of which particular component of humankind wascreated by which power, but it seems that the rational part of the soul musthave been created by a power, rather than the Father. When God says ‘letus make man’, the exhortation would be most obviously addressed to theLogos.116This certainly has connotations of a fall:ἐκεῖναι δ’ὥσπερ εἰς ποταμὸν τὸ σῶμα καταβᾶσαι ποτὲμὲν ὑπὸ συρμοῦ δίνης βιαιοτάτης ἁρπασθεῖσαι κατεπόθησαν,ποτὲ δὲ πρὸς τὴν φορὰν ἀντισχεῖνδυνηθεῖσαι τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἀνενήξαντο,εἶτα ὅθεν ὥρμησαν,ἐκεῖσε πάλιν ἀνέπτησαν.‘Those who descend, into the body, just as if into a river, are snatched away at times and gulpeddown by the suction of an extremely violent eddy, but when they are able to resist the stream, atfirst they swim upwards, and then they fly back up to that place from which they set out.’(Gig.13–14).117Opif.136118trans.

Following the Mosaicaccount leads to a more logical sequence than that of theTimaeus,sinceboth sexes are present in the first generation. AtOpif.151,Philopointsout that man would have resembled God more closely, if it had not beenfor the subsequent ‘moulding’ of woman. However, atOpif.152, Philo,using the imagery of Aristophanes’ speech atSym.191a–193, adopts a morebalanced stance, recognising the value of procreation for the perpetuationof the species.119Philo differs from most of the other traditions studied, which tendto view mankind as capable of living an immoral life without the helpof women, as must have been the case with some members of the firstgeneration of Plato’sTimaeus. Woman is not responsible for the fall of soulsin Origen, although the fall of Man in thePoimandresor the error of Sophiain the Gnostic tradition would seem to be caused by female error. Thefemale responsibility for the fall of man in Philo appears disproportionatein view of the Mosaic account he is following, where it is the serpentwho is the cause of all the trouble (§157). For Philo, the serpent representspleasure: he is sunk prone on his belly, consumes earth with his food andby nature he destroys those whom he has bitten.The creation of woman is based onGen2:21–5, but from this point on,Philo strays away from the Biblical account of creation. In fact, he engagesin an excursus upon the moral decline of mankind. Interestingly, he makesno attempt to explain the creation of woman from Adam’s rib (he neveractually mentions Adam by name inOpif.), although he allegorises theserpent. Philo believes that the creation of woman from the side of man isan indication that she is inferior in both age and in honour to him.120Healso views it as a sign that man is bound to protect woman since she is anecessary part of him, but that she is bound to serve him as a whole.Philo’s main problem regarding the creation of woman appears to be thatonce she is created, man can no longer imitate God’s solitary existence.121Clearly, this is not a particularly persuasive argument, but it does recall the119...ἔρως δ’ἐπιγενόμενος καθάπερ ἑνὸς ζῴου διττὰ τμήματα διεστηκότα συναγαγὼν εἰς ταὐτὸνἁρμόττεται,πόθον ἐνιδρυσάμενος ἑκατέρῳ τῆς πρὸς θάτερον κοινωνίας εἰς τὴν τοῦ ὁμοίουγένεσιν·ὁ δὲ πόθος οὗτος καὶ τὴν τῶν σωμάτων ἡδονὴν ἐγέννησεν,ἥτις ἐστὶν ἀδικημάτων καὶπαρανομημάτων ἀρχή,δι’ἣν ὑπαλλάττονται τὸν θνητὸν καὶ κακοδαίμονα βίον ἀντ’ἀθανάτουκαὶ εὐδαίμονος.‘And the love which results is exactly like drawing together two separate parts of a living being andjoining them together, and in this way sets in place in each desire for sexual intercourse for theother with the aim of generating what is similar to them.

Philo regards this schemaas applying to all of humanity; in the context of his moral allegory, Adamand Eve represent respectively archetypal male and female characteristics.Soul, as a female element, is influenced to a greater extent by the physicalthan the male element (mind). In concluding his account, Philo comparesdemiurgy to a political system, attacking polytheism, since he views itas a form of divine ochlocracy.123AtOpif.171, he argues that since Godwould only create something like himself, He must have only created onecosmos. Clearly, in light of Philo’s comments concerning the creation ofman, this would seem to be a particularly weak argument, since despite thesimilarity between man and God, God still created multiple humans. Inkeeping with theTimaeus, Philo argues that God’s beneficence is adequateguarantee that he would never allow the cosmos to be destroyed.Reproduction occurs atTim.91a–d, but Philo does not deal with thisaspect subsequent to the creation of man atOpif.Parents are the mortalcounterparts of the Young Gods ofTim.41c, e4and42d4. They imitateGod by creating something new. Like the Young Gods, they receive theimmortal part ‘from outside’ (Opif.6,Her.184) and only ‘mimic God inframing life’ (ἐν τῷ ζῳοπλαστεῖν,Decal.120). The Demiurge’s speech isequated to God’s exhortation on reproduction atGen.1:11–13,20–3,28–30.Parents as ‘visible Gods’ (Decal.120) are accessory causes of creation, whileGod is the true cause.MatterThe question of Philo’s views on the status of matter is an interesting one;according to Philo it cannot be regarded as a principle in its own right.124122Opif.165123Opif.171124Cf.Opif.8:Μωυσῆς δέ...ἔγνω δὴ,ὅτι ἀναγκαιότατόν ἐστιν ἐν τοῖς οὖσι τὸ μὲν εἶναι δραστήριον αἴτιον,τὸ δὲ παθητόν,καὶ ὅτι τὸ μὲν δραστήριον ὁ τῶν ὅλων νοῦς ἐστιν εἱλικρινέστατος καὶἀκραιφνέστατος,κρείττων ἢ ἀρετὴ καὶ κρείττων ἢ ἐπιστήμη καὶ κρείττων ἢ αὐτὸ τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶαὐτὸ τὸ καλόν·τὸ δὲ παθητὸν ἄψυχον καὶ ἀκίνητον ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ...‘Moses . . . realised that it was most necessary amongst the things that exist that there is an activecause and a passive counterpart and that the active cause is the mind of the all, most pure andunmixed, beyond excellence and knowledge and the Good and Beautiful itself, but that which ispassive is without soul and has no motion from itself . . . ’"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"76Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of AlexandriaPhilo is not influenced solely by Platonism;Opif.8–9is important interms of illustrating Philo’s debt to the Stoa, which attributes everythingto God (though naturally Philo as a pious Jew would subscribe to thisview). Philo also uses Stoic terminology, even referring to matter asτὸπαθητόν, emphasising its lack of causality.125He tends to use terms whichemphasise matter’s passivity:ἄμορφος(shapeless),126though at the sametime mentioning its disorder; it isἀνείδεος(formless) atMut.135,andἀσχημάτιστος(figureless) atSomn. II.45.127Matter is defined negatively through the use of alpha-privatives (ἄτακ-τος,ἄποιος,ἄψυχος,Opif.22). It lacks the positive characteristics ofthe Platonic Receptacle (οὐχ ἡσυχίαν ἄγον ἀλλὰ κινούμενον πλημμελῶς,Tim.30a). Philo’s characterisation of matter asἄψυχοςcontrasts with theMiddle Platonist tradition which based its view onTim.30a.128Philonicmatter lacks disorderly motion, although it does contain potentiality, anAristotelian feature (δυναμένῃ δὲ πάντα γίνεσθαι). Matter is capable of‘changing for the best’, though this is due to God allowing it to share inhis nature.129AtOpif.8–9, Moses recognises that reality consists both ofτὸ δραστήριον αἴτιον(Nous)andτὸ παθὴτον. Philo adopts the Timaeanaccount, but he is not in favour of the level of dualism often found inPlatonism, since this would place God and matter on the same level.One problem here is whether Philo regarded God as creating matter.Philo does not explicitly say that God made the world out of nothing. Sincethis would be a new concept to Greek philosophy, one might be forgivenfor expecting him to. Philo faces two problems if he is going to suggest thatGod created matter. Firstly, if God is the source of order, He would hardlycreate matter that is disorderly and then order it.130Secondly, it wouldimply that God is responsible for evil, explained by Philo’s predecessorsas due to the recalcitrance of matter. Philo emphasises the material (ἐξοὗ) aspect of the Timaean Receptacle, without really accounting for thespatial (ἐν ᾤ) aspect, and that seems to be responsible for some of thedifficulty in the interpretation. The Receptacle in which creation takesplace is not identical to the matter ‘out of which’ creation takes place AtSomn.i.76, the implication is that matter is created (οὐ δημιουργὸς μόνονἀλλὰ καὶ κτιστής, not only the Demiurge [of matter] but its maker), aview strengthened by the declaration that matter is a ‘perfect substance’,but this is contradicted by other passages (Opif.9,QG1.55,Somn.ii.45,Spec.I.329).125Opif.8–9126Her.140,Spec.i.328127Wo l f s o n :1968,309128Runia:1986,143129Opif.22130Runia:1986,289"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Matter77Philo explains that God calculated the precise quantity of matter requiredfor creation, since even a human craftsman is able to work out the amountof material which he requires for a given task.131This draws upon Plato’sassertion that all matter was used up in the act of creation.Περὶ δὲ τοῦ ποσοῦ τῆς οὐσίας,εἰ δὴ γέγονεν ὄντως,ἐκεῖνο λεκτέον.ἐστο-χάσατο πρὸς τὴν τοῦ κόσμου γένεσιν ὁ Θεὸς αὐταρκεστάτης ὕλης ὡς μήτ’ἐνδέοι μήθ’ὑπερβάλλοι.καὶγὰρ ἄτοπον ἦν τοῖς μὲν κατὰ μέρος τεχνίταις,ὁπότε τι δημιουργοῖεν,καὶ μάλιστα τῶν πολυτελῶν,τὸ ἐν ὕλαις αὔταρκεςσταθμήσασθαι,τὸν δ’ἀριθμοὺς καὶ μέτρα καὶ τὰς ἐν τούτοις ἰσότηταςἀνευρηκότα μὴ φροντίσαι τοῦ ἱκανοῦ.λέξω δὴ μετὰ παρρησίας,ὅτι οὔτ’ἐλάττονος οὔτε πλείονος οὐσίας ἔδει τῷ κόσμῳ πρὸς κατασκευήν,ἐπεὶ οὐκἂν ἐγένετο τέλειος,οὐδ’ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς μέρεσιν ὁλόκληρος·εὖ δὲ δεδημιουργη-μένος ἐκ τελείας οὐσίας ἀπετελέσθη·πανσόφου γὰρ τὴν τέχνην ἴδιον,πρὶνἄρξασθαί τινος κατασκευῆς,τὴν ἱκανὴν ἰδεῖν ὕλην.It is necessary to say the following concerning the quantity of substance, ifthis was really created: God had regard for the adequate amount of matterfor the creation of the world so that the quantity should neither be lackingnor excessive. For it would be out of place that craftsmen, when they areconstructing something and most especially something expensive, allow fora sufficient amount of material, but that the one who invented numbersand measures and the equality in them did not consider what was sufficient.I will say openly that there was no need of either more or less substancefor the construction of the world, since otherwise it would not have beenperfect or complete with regard to all of its parts. But it was brought tocompletion, having been well-constructed from a perfect substance. For itis proper for one who is most clever to see that the material is sufficient,before he begins to construct anything. (Prov.i.1–15)Philo here is responding to the argument that if God created the world,why did He use a given quantity of matter and only four elements. PerhapsPhilo is here conceding for the purposes of argument that God may nothave created matter, but that this would not prevent it from being ruledor ordered by divine Providence.132(This would of course differ from theapproach of Origen who regards matter as unsuitable to be ordered bydivine Providence, if it has not been created by divine wisdom.)The term that Philo uses for matter here isοὐσία, rather thanὕλη. Zellerviews this as indicative that Philo has adopted a more Stoic view of matter,regarding it as identical to body.133This does not really help matters, sincePlato did believe in a material substratum; it is just that he did not use thetermοὐσίαto refer to matter.

I do not think that Philo’s adoptionof this term can be interpreted as a Stoicising move.De Aeternitate MundiOne must proceed with caution when usingDe Aeternitate Mundias a coretext for analysing some of Philo’s views. There has been some dispute asto its authenticity. It is not mentioned in Eusebius’ list of Philo’s works,although it has always been included in thecorpus Philonicum. It expressesviewpoints that would prove problematic if attributed to Philo. He isusually hostile to the view that the world is uncreated and indestructible:a thesis that this work appears to propound. It contains other curiosities,such as breaking away from Philo’s usual practice of citing the doctrinesof Greek philosophers anonymously. Here the author mentions them byname. The second half of theDe Aeternitate Mundicontradicts Philo’sbelief in God’s creation of the cosmos. The treatise also appears incompleteor at least seems to require a sequel.Scholars have been divided over the work’s authenticity. Bernays (1863,1876,1882) viewed the work as unPhilonic, while Cumont (1891) assertedthat linguistically the treatise was unmistakably Philonic.134He concludedthat theDe Aeternitate Mundiwas an early work, while Bousset (1915)claimed that it was a school exercise.135The treatise may, in fact, haveother parallels.De Plantatione, an adaption of a Greek philosophical trea-tise, dealing with the drunkenness of Noah atGen.9:20–1, has a similarstructure. It consists of an introduction recounting the main opinions heldon the issue, a section containing arguments in favour of the propositionand the third section arguing against the proposition. Another parallel isConcerning which is more Useful: Water or Firefrom the corpus of Plutarch’sMoralia, which exhibits this structure also.Runia argues thatDe Aeternitate Mundi, like these other two works, isaθέσις/quaestio infinita.136What makesAet. difficult to interpret is that itdiscusses the merits of three viewpoints, not two (§7). The cosmos is eitherungenerated and indestructible, generated and destructible or generatedand indestructible. The second position was propounded by Democritusand Epicurus and by the Stoics (§8–9). For Philo, the Stoic doctrine ison a higher level than that of the mechanistic atomists. They, at least,regard God as the creator of the cosmos. Theirekpyrosisis followed by134Runia:1981,107135Runia:1981,108136Runia:1981,116"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Matter79rebirth, which indicates belief in Divine Providence, although Philo doesnot suggest that God is responsible forekpyrosis.At §§83–4, Philo, like Boethus of Sidon, asks what God is doing duringthe period ofekpyrosis, when it is the Stoics themselves who claim thathe is in perpetual activity. Philo regardsekpyrosisas illogical. If the uni-verse is resolved into fire, nothing will remain from which to reconstructthe universe (§§85–8). Earlier Stoics may have regarded God as the firedestroying the universe atekpyrosis, but for Philo this would be blasphe-mous.Ekpyrosisis contrary to belief in equality of reciprocation of theelements (§§107–12).137For Philo, Aristotle is superior to the Stoics since he appreciated theorder of the cosmos. In advocating the second proposal, that the cosmosisγένητος καὶ ἄφθαρτος, Philo draws heavily uponTim.41a7–b6. Platoreached a higher level of truth than Aristotle, since he recognised that thecosmos is not autonomous, but was created due to God’s goodness. Platoalso recognised that the cosmos is not eternal in an absolute sense, but itgains its eternity from God’s will. At §14, Philo expresses his preference forthe literal interpretation of theTimaeus.§17even goes so far as to assert thatHesiod is the father of Plato’s doctrine. This is not because Philo wishes todenigrate Plato; rather, in antiquity, the older a belief, the more reputableit was.138Plato’s doctrine is therefore portrayed not as a radical innovation,but rather as an aspect of the truth which was imbued with the authorityof even older thinkers.At §19, Philo ascends to the highest level by dealing with the views ofMoses. This introduces the motif of the ‘theft of the philosophers’, a com-mon Jewish apologetic device. The doctrine that the cosmos is generatedand indestructible ultimately came from Moses and this in turn ensures itsaccuracy. This also helps to explain why it appears that part of theθέσιςis missing. Philo, instead of developing two positions as is standard in aθέσις, expounds three, refuting the first with the second and the secondwith the third.139Philo makes the debt he owes to theTimaeusclear at the outset ofDeAeternitate Mundi.He invokes God in a manner reminiscent ofTim.27c,where Timaeus invokes the gods before speaking on such a great matter aswhether the cosmos is created or uncreated. At §25Philo quotesTim.32cand §38quotesTim.33c concerning the autarchy of the earth. But not allof Philo’s use of theTimaeusis to be commended. His version at §74of thedescription of the intestinal tract atTim.73a is particularly unfortunate.137Colson:1941,181138Runia:1981,127139Runia:1981,138"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"80Logosinto Demiurge: Philo of AlexandriaHis use atAet.146–50of the myth of the periodic destructions of humanpopulations, described atLawsiii.676andTim.22a, is merely superficial,although this may be composed under the influence of Stoicekpyrosisandthe Jewishdies irae. Overall,De Aeternitate Mundireveals more about theintellectual environment in which the author was working than it doesabout Philo’s conception of the Demiurge.ConclusionPhilo’s vision of the Demiurge is undoubtedly a complex one, leading himto adopt nuanced or highly-qualified positions on a number of issues. Hisindependence of mind (to a large extent due to his Jewish background,which would render some of the assumptions of Greek philosophy unpalat-able to him) has led to difficulties in attempting to classify him. On thecreation of the world, his view is, in general terms, that ofGenesis,thoughaGenesisilluminated more by the Demiurge of Plato’sTimaeusand thequestions of Middle Platonism than those of Jewish wisdom.This is illustrated by his investigation into the origin of the world. Hementions three possibilities: the Aristotelian position (the world is uncre-ated and indestructible),140the Stoic (the world is created and destructible,but this world is only one of a series)141and the ‘Platonic’ one (created andnot destructible).142The Aristotelian notion of uncreatedness is rejected(what does it leave for God to do?),143although Philo only challengesthe grounds for Aristotelian cosmic indestructibility (a corollary of itsuncreatedness).144Philo rejects the Stoic position (Aet.20–51) in favour ofthe Platonic one (Aet.19).Although Philo follows the Biblical account of creation, he draws heavilyupon demiurgic imagery. He most frequently refers to God asδημιουργός,τεχνίτης,ποιητής,κοσμοπλάστης, or uses a compound withπλάσσω.God is frequently portrayed as engaged in demiurgic activity: he divides(Her.133–43), shapes and sculpts (Her.156,Prov.2.48–50) and builds(Cher.126–7).145Philo upgrades the demiurgic imagery by portrayingGod as an architect. This is related to his social upgrading of the termδημιουργός, referring to its meaning as a magistrate in certain Greek states(Somn.ii.187). More importantly, this alteration of God from craftsman to140Aet.7,10–12;Opif.2–7,Conf.23,114;Somn.ii.283141Aet.8–9142Aet.13–16.

Since for Philo, the Forms are the thoughts ofGod, He designs the pattern that He brings to creation, rather than follow-ing independently existing Forms, like the Platonic Demiurge. However,although Philo refers to God as both a Demiurge and a Creator (κτίστης),this does not seem to necessarily imply that God created matter, ratherthat He created the noetic realm.However, the notion of a Demiurge is only one model of creation andPhilo regards others as compatible. This is chiefly due to his notion that hisexegesis or indeed any particular exegesis cannot do justice to the richnessof Scripture or explain it fully. God is also a planter (φυτουργός,Conf.196). Indeed, so important is this model of creation in Philo that Radice inPlatonismo e Creationismodevotes a whole chapter to it. This agriculturalmodel of creation is related to the creation of plants and trees in theDeOpificio Mundi. They are created at the period of sexual maturity, not justthat everything might be ready in advance of the coming of Man, but moreimportantly as a visible symbol that all fertility is attributable to God asprimary cause. The biological image of creation is also drawn upon. God isthe Parent (γεννητής,Spec.i.209), Father (πατήρ,Opif.74) and also Cause(αἴτιος,Somn.i.147). This paternal notion enters Philo from Scripture.146God’s intercourse with Sophia (His Wisdom and daughter, rather than theyoungest Aeon) produces His younger son; the visible cosmos.147The co-existence of these various creational mechanisms is complemen-tary; there is no contradiction between a demiurgic God and one who isactually the parent of what He creates. Indeed, Wolfson notes that onecannot draw a distinction between Philo’s use of the terms ‘Creator’ or‘Craftsman’, pointing out that certain medieval Jewish philosophers see nocontradiction between the Biblical account of creation and a pre-existent,uncreated matter.148This makes a definitive statement on Philo’s views onacreatio ex nihilodifficult. Still, it would seem that Philo does envisageGod as a ‘creator’, rather than a Demiurge, since He does create the noeticrealm, rather than merely using a pre-existent model.Finally, the concept of theLogos-Cutter is Philo’s major contributionto metaphysical speculations concerning creation. TheLogosthat Philoenvisages appears to incorporate numerous functions, from being a toolused by God to produce the world to His cup-bearer (figuratively speaking).These multitudinous functions might seem at first glance to indicate the146Deut.32:6:πατὴρ ἐποίησε σε’;Gen.2.8:‘ἐφύτευσεν ὁ θεὸς’, butcf.Tim.25.147Runia:1986,422.

However, this can be viewed as a direct corollary,both of the multiple models of creational and demiurgic activity to befound in Philo, as well as the breadth of functions attributed to theLogosby Scripture, where it is viewed as a mechanism for creating or governingthe world as well as facilitating prophecy. This allowed Philo to use it inorder to refer to the demiurgic mind, rather than using the termνοῦς.Philo possesses an elaborate concept of demiurgy, in spite of, or perhapsbecause of, being a Platonising expositor rather than a Platonist, due to hisself-appointed mission to do justice to the richness of scriptural thought.

ThisleavesDe Animae Procreatione in Timaeo,andQuaestiones Platonicaeas theonly extant exegetical works of Plutarch.

In this sense, it isrelated both to the myth of the Demiurge in theTimaeusand the Valentinanmyth of Sophia. In recounting the myth of Isis and Osiris, the philosophicaldoctrines are expounded, at times, in a confusing manner, as various detailsof the myth have to be included. One might compare Plutarch’s situationto that of Philo, who also has to deal with a creative religious myth (thatof thePentateuch). There is, however, an important distinction betweenthe cases. Plutarch was under no compulsion to use this myth in order toexpound philosophy; he does so, because it evidently interests him, and he1Dillon:1977,1852Hershbell:1992,2353Kenny:1991,4483"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"84Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologypresumably viewed it as containing philosophical truth (to some degree).Philo attempts to expound another generational account, thePentateuch,in philosophical language; as a pious Jew, it represents the core of his beliefand he could not simply ignore it, as Plutarch could with the Isis myth.Plutarch’s work fits within the context of an increasing interest in cross-cultural projects amongst first and second century philosophers; Cornutus’Theologia Graecaalso investigated the philosophical truth behind the Isisand Osiris myth.4It is important to remember that Plutarch as an exegete works on theassumption that Plato’s works express parts of the same system (as opposedto a ‘developmental’ theory) and that passages and specific phraseologyin Plato should be taken literally.5Therefore, his attempts to manipulatethe text, an allegation made by Cherniss,6can also be regarded as render-ing certain passages in terms consistent with what Plato states elsewhere.Plutarch takes the demiurgic myth literally, as opposed to attempts by oth-ers within Platonism (such as Xenocrates) to deconstruct the myth to itsconstituent activities. Certain aspects of the myth are particularly impor-tant, especially the concept that the Demiurge is not in any way responsiblefor evil. Plutarch draws distinctions between the Demiurge and the FirstPrinciple in theDe Iside et Osiride, where immanent Osiris can be seen asapproximating aLogos-type figure (ironic in terms of Plutarch’s oppositionto the Stoics). In the history of the demiurgic concept, Plutarch represents(unlike the other philosophers I consider) less an attempt to develop it,than to resolve some of the problems bequeathed by Plato.Plutarch’s religious developmentPlutarch is typical of the Middle Platonist movement, according to whichthe goal of life is assimilation to God, rather than to nature. For Anti-ochus of Ascalon, the Supreme Good was represented not just by virtue,but also the primary needs of nature, in the absence of which (he felt)virtue itself could not exist. By the time of Eudorus, theτέλοςhas cometo mean assimilation to God, with virtue alone considered important.7This is the justification for Plutarch’s attempts to understand the essenceof God and becomes apparent fromDe Sera550dff., where the great-est blessing which Man can derive is to imitate God’s goodness, whichhe can observe in the order of the cosmos. Plutarch’s later works were4Schott:2008,215Opsomer:2004,1386Cherniss:1976, XIII.1,999c–1032f,137–87See Dillon:1977,71and122for discussion of this topic."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s religious development85viewed by nineteenth-century German academics as a return to his youth-ful scepticism.8Plutarch’s religious ideas are also characterised by his reac-tion against Stoicism, by his dualism and by his Pythagorean leanings.

Zieglerproposed that his Pythagorean sympathies were inherited from his father,while Dillon argues that he was influenced by a Pythagoreanised Platonismimported by his teacher, Ammonius, from Alexandria.For Dillon, Plutarch is ‘orthodox’, as exhibited by Ammonius’ speech (DeE391e–394c),De Iside and OsirisandDe Genio Socratis, whereby Plutarch’sview that theτέλοςof life was assimilation to God can be viewed as theculmination of Middle Platonic thought, post-Eudorus.9Certain scholars(such as D ̈orrie) viewed Plutarch’s doctrines as a departure from their ownconception ofSchulplatonismus; specifically the idea that God created thesoul as part of himself and out of himself (Quaestiones Platonicae1009b–c),which vitiates the role of three principles (God, Forms, Matter), though theDreiprinzipienlehreis more a popular doxographical doctrine than a litmustest of Platonic orthodoxy.10D ̈orrie further objects to Plutarch’s positingof God asparadeigma(De Sera550d), to his placing of God among theIntelligibles (Quaestiones Platonicae1002b) and the posthumous ascent ofthe soul, which separates the psyche and thenous (De Facie944e).In reaction to D ̈orrie’s view,De Sera550d only serves to strengthenDillon’s position, since it emphasises theτέλοςas assimilation to God.Furthermore, God is theparadigmofπάντα καλὰin Plato’sTheaet.176e.AtRep.x.613a–b, humanareteis described as assimilation (ἔξομοίωσις)toGod. Plutarch also avoids use of the termsτὸ καλόνandτὸ ἀγαθόν, whichwould explicitly locate Plato’s main Forms in God. Instead he prefers to useplurals. He does, however, identify God with the Form of the Good andBeautiful (De Facie944e), an identification which emerges very early on inPlatonism. In fact, on a literal level, Plutarch maintained the distinctionbetween the Forms,νοῦςand the Demiurge and resisted the prevailing8Brenk:1987,2569‘Orthodoxy’ obviously does not have an absolute sense in a Platonist context, in the absence of any‘certifying’ body.10Brenk:1987,258"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"86Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologyintellectual trend to unite these elements. Admittedly, at certain times,Plutarch fuses God and the Forms.11In this sense, it seems that Plutarchmay be closer to the true Platonic interpretation than many other ‘orthodox’Platonists.The Demiurge and the FormsAs R. M. Jones commented ‘Plutarch usually treats the Forms and Godas independent entities and never calls the Forms the thoughts of God.’12Jones points out that this misinterpretation of Plato’s thought alreadyexisted by the time of theDidaskalikosof Alcinous (Ch.9.1):13Form considered in reference to God is his intellection, in reference to usthe first object of thought, in reference to matter, the measure, in relation tothe sensible cosmos, the model, and with reference to itself, essence . . . Forif God is a mind (νοῦς)orhasamind(νοέρον), he has thoughts and theseare eternal and unchanging.However, the notion can certainly be found in Philo of Alexandria,although he was probably not the inventor, but may have borrowed theconcept from Eudorus of Alexandria, and the original idea may go backto Plato’s pupils, in particular Xenocrates. It seems that this interpretationmay have crept into Platonic thought under the influence of the Aris-totelian concept that God only engages in thought and he himself is theobject of his own thought along with theνοητόν.The same can also be posited for one of Plutarch’s other great ‘heresies’against ‘orthodox’ Platonism; his positing of temporal world-generation.Some scholars, such as Whittaker, have suggested that Plato, in fact,believed in a literal creation of the world in theTimaeus, but that, influ-enced by Aristotle’s criticisms, Platonists such as Xenocrates reinterpretedthe more embarrassing passages in favour of atemporal creation.14In thiscase, it would seem that Plutarch is closer to Plato’s original thought,although he is frequently criticised for attempting to distort Plato’s wordsin order to enlist the philosopher’s support for his own ideas. InDe Facie,itis apparent that the Demiurge and the Forms are not identical. The Formsare theparadigmwhich he imitates (1023d). At1026e–f, Plutarch adaptstheStatesmanmyth, postulating that at certain periods the world is rolledbackward by the World-Soul and that by contemplating the intelligible11Jones:1926,325.

The Intelligibles are therefore not justabstract concepts, but the principles which underpin visible reality.Plutarch’s response to Stoic physicsAmongst the Middle Platonists, Plutarch in particular displays a height-ened level of bitter hostility to the Stoics, although at the same time hismetaphysical views are influenced by his reaction against this philosophi-cal school. One might expect Plutarch to adopt an open-minded attitudetowards the Stoa. He is, after all, an ‘intellectual magpie’, to borrow Dil-lon’s phrase. HisDe Iside et Osiridecan be seen as a cross-cultural project,reading the Egyptian myth of Isis and Osiris in terms of Plato’sTimaeus.Although Plutarch feels that Platonic philosophy attained greater claritythan Egyptian wisdom, this does not mean that the Platonists have amonopoly on the truth. Such tolerant pluralism is absent from Plutarch’sattitude to the Stoics, however. Unfortunately, in this regard, six out of thenine polemics against the Stoics mentioned by the Lamprias Catalogue areno longer extant:Against Chrysippus on Justice,Against the Stoics on Com-mon Experience,Selections and Refutations of Stoics and Epicureans,ReasonsWhy the Stoics Vacillate, Against Chrysippus on the First ConsequentandAgainst the Stoics on What is in our Control.ThisleavesjustOn Stoic Self-Contradictions,Against the Stoics on Common Conceptionsand aσυνοψιςofThat the Stoics Talk More Paradoxically than the Poets.As Hershbell notes, since the nineteenth century, Plutarch’s interactionwith the Stoics has been read in three different ways: as a determinedopponent, as an eclectic borrowing from both the Stoa and the Academy,or as a Stoic despite his own better judgement.15To understand Plutarch’srelationship with the Stoa, it is necessary to consider the influence ofStoic concepts of world-generation upon Platonism. Although the initialinterpretative controversy regarding theTimaeushad been between thePlatonists and the Aristotelians, by the first to third centuries, however,Platonist speculations on the issue were heavily influenced by Stoic physics.For example, the Stoics identify two principles: God and matter, as opposedto the original Platonic three of God or the Demiurge, matter and Forms.1615Hershbell:1992,334216This is illustrated by Diogenes Laertius’ exposition of their position: ‘According to them there aretwo principles of everything: that which acts and that which is acted upon. The passive one ismatter, the essence which is without qualitiy, and the active is the divinelogos. For being eternal, itfabricates each individual through all of the matter. This position is advanced by Zeno of CitiuminOn Substance, by Cleanthes inOn the Atoms, by Chrysippus towards the end of the first book of"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"88Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologyThe Middle Platonists also argue for two principles, using the sameterms, God and matter, to denote them, creating this reduction inthe original three elements through using the claim that the Forms arethe thoughts of God. These principles are represented differently in themore dualistic of the Middle Platonists than amongst their Stoic counter-parts. Whereas the Stoics regard matter as completely passive, the MiddlePlatonists see it as recalcitrant. It might appear that the Middle Platonistsare modifying their position under Stoic influence. However, it is possibleto see a trace of a two-principle theory in theTimaeus. David Sedley hassuggested this doctrine goes back to the fashion in the Old Academy forregarding the Monad and the Indefinite Dyad as the original two principlesof Plato’s unwritten teaching, although perhaps the notion of the world asthe result of the collaboration of two principles is more forcefully expressedin theTimaeusas a result of the tension between Reason and Necessity.The Stoic conception of God differs in a very important respect fromthe Platonic one. The Stoic active principle or god is all-pervasive andis therefore present in all matter. Zeno and Chrysippus identified thesubstance of god with ‘the whole cosmos and the heaven’ (DL7.148=F20E–K), a position in which they were followed by the first centurybcStoic, Posidonius.17A second passage from A ̈etius elaborates this conceptof god with a triple identification of god with productive fire,pneumaandthe cosmos:The Stoics declare that god is (1) crafting fire, which proceeds method-ically to the generation of the cosmos and encompasses all thelogoi sper-matikoi, according to which everything happens in accordance with fate and(2) pneuma, pervading the whole cosmos, taking names as it partakes inalternation throughout all of the matter in which it is divided and (3)thecosmos and the stars and the earth are gods and the mind is the highest ofall in the aether.

(Alexander,De Mixtionep.226,24–9=SVF2.1048)Alexander outlines several of the challenges typically levelled at the Stoics.There are two grounds on which the Stoic conception of God is typicallycriticised. The first is the notion of his industriousness: the idea that heis continually concerned with even the most minor matters, the idea thathe was a craftsman of grubs and gnats: a position which was especiallyattacked by the Epicureans and the Platonists.19However, the Stoics are particularly attacked by the Platonists on anothermajor issue. The Stoic account of world-generation, like the version of theTimaeus, posits a temporal production on the part of God: ‘and beingby himself in the beginning, [God] transformed all substance through airinto water’ (SVF1.102=DL7.136) and again ‘the cosmos is generatedwhen substance is transformed from fire through air into moisture’ (SVF1.102=DL7.142). The Stoics use the language and imagery of Plato’sTimaeusin referring to God in his capacity as generator of the sensiblerealm as a Demiurge: God produces ‘everything throughout all matter likea craftsman (δημιουργεῖν)’ (SVF493=DL7.134). However, in contrastto the transcendent Demiurge of Platonism, the Stoic god is immanent18Salles:2009,319Cf.

Though the most famous image of theTimaeusassociated with world-generation is the technological one, thatof God as a craftsman, the dialogue also relies on a biological image.The world at30b is, after all, a living being and the Receptacle, thespace in which world-generation takes place and which, under Aristotelianinfluence, becomes equated with matter, is described as a ‘mother’.Although the Stoics draw on this technological language, their usageof it is no more than metaphorical. The Stoics reject the technologicalimage of Plato’sTimaeus. They reject too crude a comparison betweenGod and a craftsman. Artistic products, they claim, do not come to bein the same way as the things of nature. The image which they prefer touse is the biological one. God’s working on the cosmos could be moreaccurately compared to the activity of semen. Just as the semen can workfrom within an organism to influence its development in accordance withthe information it contains, so too god works from inside matter.This influence of theTimaeusshould not come as a surprise. ZenostudiedattheAcademywheretheTimaeusplayed a prominent role in aPlatonic education. Stoicism can be viewed originally as an attempt to mod-ernise Socratic thought and early Stoics even went by the title ‘Socratics’.20This allows us to consider the Stoic rejection of the technological image,the rejection of the use of the Forms as a paradigm and the avoidance ofmathematical terms to express the rational underpinning of the cosmos asa rejection of the Pythagorean elements of Plato’s cosmology in favour ofits Socratic features.21The Stoics, like the Platonists and Aristotelians, draw a distinctionbetween the heavens and the sublunar world. The following distinctionbetween a world of order and one of chaos, expressed by the Stoic, Balbus,would not appear out of character if expressed by a Platonist:Therefore in the heavens there is neither chance nor accidence nor errornor absence of purpose, but on the contrary the order of everything, truth,reason and immutability and whatever lacks these and is false, erroneousand full of error, belongs to the area around the earth and below the moon,which is the last of all (the celestial bodies) and to the earth.

The Stoics after all, regard god as active in all matter.Possibly this could be read as a defence of Stoic theology composed as areaction to Platonism, accepting the Platonic hierarchy of the universe.This is indicated also by DL7.138–9, which points out that god is activethroughout the universe, but has a greater presence in the aether or heaven,which functions as the command centre of the universe. God regulatesthe universe from heaven, acting on matter just as soul on body. Onceagain the technological image of theTimaeus, God acting on matter like acraftsman, is rejected in favour of the biological one.In his anti-Stoic writings, Plutarch’s strong dualistic tendencies may beobserved coming into conflict with the monistic causality of the Stoics. InDe Stoicorum Repugnantiis, Plutarch sets out to undermine Stoic thinkers,particularly Chrysippus, his main method of attack being, as the title sug-gests, to point out what he perceives as the gross inconsistencies in theirphilosophy. Plutarch tries to show that Chrysippus was the sort of man‘who says absolutely anything that may come into his head’ (1047b). Thereason for Plutarch’s concentrated attack on Chrysippus is no doubt thestatus which he held within the Stoic school; he was one of the princi-pal authorities amongst the Stoics and, according to Epictetus, educationmeant knowledge of the older Stoics.22At §30, Plutarch attacks Chrysippus on his doctrine of ‘promoted indif-ferents’, items such as health, status and material possessions which arebeneath virtue to concern itself with. These ‘promoted indifferents’ areshown not to be good, since they can be put to evil use. Virtue alone isbeneficial, though it is bestowed not by god, but is the object of free choice.This means that god cannot benefit man in the only matter that counts(1048d). For Plutarch, this has the effect of making the Stoic god essen-tially powerless. While this criticism appears to be in the realm of ethics,the Stoics intrinsically link ethics and metaphysics, due to their equation ofGod and Providence. Chrysippus also argues for the notion of the divinechoice of the best (§31); a position also advocated in Platonism, but then,as Plutarch points out, this divine choice from the Stoic point of view wasnot particularly fortunate, since they view humanity as in a wretched andmiserable state.Plutarch is opposed to the view that God can be responsible for evil andattacks what he views as the lack of sophistication in Chrysippus’ stance22Epictetus,Discourses.I.iv.28–32"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"92Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologyon this matter: ‘you’ve made the easiest plea, to blame the gods’.23Plutarchis hostile to the idea that the Demiurge could be responsible for evil, incontrast to the Chrysippean position that evils are dispersed according tothe will of Zeus, either for the purpose of punishment, or in the courseof other arrangements, as is the case in cities (De Stoic. Repug.1051).In the same passage, he attacks Chrysippus’ insensitivity for comparingthe evil things which happen to the virtuous man to a few husks whichget lost in a well-run household. Plutarch here favours a more inclusiveform of divine Providence. Chrysippus’ reasoning is based on the roleof Necessity in the sensible world. Even Plato (Tim.47e5–48a2)andtheauthor ofDe Placitisat885a recognise the limits placed on the Demiurge byNecessity. However, for Plutarch, if Necessity controls events to such a largedegree, than many events lie beyond the control of the Demiurge and theworld is not completely ordered in conformity with his reason. This wouldabsolve him from guilt for the existence of evil in the world, although, asPlutarch illustrates, Chrysippus vitiates this by claiming that even vice isthe creation of the Demiurge, ‘since nothing, neither small nor great, iscontrary to the reason of Zeus or his law or justice or Providence’.24AtDe Stoic. Repug.1050e–1051a, Plutarch attacks this statement and respondswith a spirited defence of the Demiurge. Zeus, according to Plutarch’spolemical interpretation of Chrysippus, is to be blamed if he is responsiblefor the creation of useless vice (ἄχρηστον...τὴν κακίαν) or having created(πεποίηκεν) it, attempts to punish it.Plutarch also attacks the Chrysippean notion that God is cruel andresponsible in some way for the sufferings of man. If even humans killunwanted puppies when they are just born, it seems unlikely that Zeuswould have produced men and allowed them to attain maturity, before hestarts contriving ways to torture them. It would have been more logicalto simply prevent human generation. Zeus, in Greek mythology, despitehis title as father of gods and men, is not actually responsible for theirgeneration, so it is quite clear that Plutarch is treating Zeus as somethingof a philosophical principle here.Of course, Plutarch is being polemical. It is clear, though, that part ofPlutarch’s hostility to Stoicism stems from its view that everything in theuniverse takes place in accordance with universal reason; i.e. God. Theresult is to make God responsible for the existence of evil. Plutarch atDe Stoic. Rep.1051d continues his opposition to this line of thought andnotes that declaring that the Demiurge is responsible for the appointment23De Stoic. Repugn.1049f24De Stoic. Repugn.1050d"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s response to Stoic physics93of evil men to positions of power is tantamount to accusing a king ofhaving appointed evil officials and turning a blind eye to the abuse of hisvirtuous subjects. Given this context, it seems apparent that a dualisticphilosophy was the obvious means for Plutarch to extract himself fromthe difficulty created by the problem of evil. In defence of the Stoics, theircomparison of the suffering virtuous to a few husks of grain is not a callousstatement. Rather God, for Chrysippus and also the Stoic Balbus in Cicero’saccount, is justified in ignoring minor matters to concentrate on greatercosmic problems. That is essentially the position which Plato adopts intheTimaeus,25in his view of the Demiurge who concerns himself with theordering of the whole and is never depicted as being especially concernedwith the welfare of the individual. Indeed, his obligation to comply withthe dictates of Necessity would seem to be incompatible with a theodicyof this sort.Certain aspects of the problem of evil are touched upon inDe Commu-nibus Notitiis adversus Stoicos. But first, the use of this text perhaps requiresa brief justification. Its Plutarchean pedigree has been challenged, but thearguments against its authenticity have long been refuted. In any case,many of the arguments overlap with those used inDe Stoicorum Repug-nantiis.At1065e–1066a, Plutarch again levels at the Stoics the charge ofmaking the Demiurge responsible for evil:And the paternal and supreme and righteous Zeus, the best of artificersaccording to Pindar, did not craft the cosmos as a great, embroidered andmanifold play, but as a town shared by gods and men, who should beassociates in accordance with justice and virtue, blissfully in agreement andfor this most beautiful and most holy goal, he did not need pirates andslayers of men and parricides and tyrants. For what is bad has not beengenerated as an intermezzo that is pleasurable to the divinity, and it is notfor the sake of liveliness and laughter and as a joke that injustice has comeinto contact with concrete matters, so that is not possible to glimpse eventhe phantom of the harmony which they celebrate.Here again, Plutarch views the Demiurge as essentially good, having gener-ated the world with the best aim in mind. He even goes further, regardingvice as unessential to the Demiurge’s plan (in contrast to the Stoics, as theyare presented inDe Stoic. Repugn., who regard vice as necessary for theexistence of evil): ‘For matter has not of itself brought forth what is evil’(1076c). Plutarch then goes on to argue here that matter isἄποιος(‘withoutquality’), its motions coming directly from the moving principle. This is25Plato adopts a similar position atLawsx.903–5."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"94Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologynot very far from the view of matter outlined in Plato’sTimaeus, but it isa long way from the attempts to insulate God from matter exhibited byPhilo.However at1085b–c, he does touch on the relationship of this Demi-urge to matter.26Plutarch’s problem here is with the Stoic concept of theDemiurge, as rationality permeating matter. For Plutarch, the Demiurge,as a principle, should be pure (καθαρός) and incomposite (ἀσύνθετος).If matter is without quality and incomposite, it fulfils the criteria to beregarded as a principle. According to Plutarch’s reading of the Stoic posi-tion, however, the assumptions which the Stoics make concerning God areinappropriate for a principle. For example, at1085c Plutarch points out thatsince, according to the Stoic position, the Demiurge is not pure Reason,but only has reason on deposit as a kind of trustee (ταμίας), he wouldthen be neither Reason nor matter. He becomes, according to Plutarch’spolemic reading of the Stoic account, not a principle, but a participantin two opposed principles, and hence a compound. This would make theDemiurge or God a second-order construct. Compounds are, of course,less perfect than principles, since they always run the risk of being reducedto their constituent elements. Worst of all, Plutarch claims that the Stoicshave attributed corporeality to God.Plutarch here presents a serious criticism of the Stoic position, andthough he is engaged in polemics, the passage can be viewed within thebroader context of the Platonist preoccupation with insulating the Demi-urge from matter, but simultaneously attempting to explain his interaction26Στοιχείου γε μὴν ἀρχῆς καὶ ἔννοια κοινὴ πᾶσιν ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν ἀνθρώποις ἐμπέφυκεν,ὡς ἁπλοῦνκαὶ ἄκρατον εἶναι καὶ ἀσύνθετον·οὐ γὰρ στοιχεῖον οὐδ’ἀρχὴ τὸ μεμιγμένον ἀλλ’ἐξ ὧν μέμικται.καὶ μὴν οὗτοι τὸν θεὸν ἀρχὴν ὄντα σῶμα νοερὸν καὶ νοῦν ἐν ὕλῃ ποιοῦντες οὐ καθαρὸν οὐδὲἁπλοῦν οὐδ’ἀσύνθετον ἀλλ’ἐξ ἑτέρου καὶ δι’ἕτερον ἀποφαίνουσιν·ἡδ’ὕλη καθ’αὑτὴν ἄλογοςοὖσα καὶ ἄποιος τὸ ἁπλοῦν ἔχει καὶ τὸ ἀρχοειδές·ὁθεὸςδέ,εἴπερ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀσώματος οὐδ’ἄυλος,ὡς ἀρχῆς μετέσχηκε τῆς ὕλης.εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἓν καὶ ταὐτὸν ἡ ὕλη καὶ ὁ λόγος,οὐκ εὖ τὴν ὕληνἄλογον ἀποδεδώκασιν·εἰ δ’ἕτερα,καὶ ἀμφοτέρων ταμίας ἄν τις ὁ θεὸς εἴη καὶ οὐχ ἁπλοῦν ἀλλὰσύνθετον πρᾶγμα τῷ νοερῷ τὸ σωματικὸν ἐκ τῆς ὕλης προσειληφώς.‘But a common conception of what an element or principle is, is innate in all men, as it were;it is simple and unmixed and uncompounded. For the element or principle is not what has beenmixed but that out of which it is mixed, but these people [the Stoics], by making God, who is aprinciple, an intellectual body and enmattered mind, proclaim that He is neither pure nor simple,nor uncompounded, but from something else and on account of something else. But matter, beingitself irrational and without quality, has simplicity and is of the nature of a principle, but God, ifHe really is not incorporeal and not immaterial, partakes in matter as one sharing in a principle.For if matter and reason are one and the same thing, they have not done well in conceding thatmatter is irrational and if they are different, God has both as a kind of trustee and is not simple buta composite thing with material corporeality added to intellectuality.’ (De Communibus Notitiis,1085b–c)"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s response to Stoic physics95on it. Polemics aside, the Stoics actually have a major problem. They typ-ically identify God with one of the elements, either fire or air, or with acompound (pneumaor breath). Once God is regarded as a compound,he becomes ontologically inferior to the elements, since a compound canalways be dissolved into its constituent parts and indeed presupposes theirexistence. The Stoics must therefore face the charge of being both mate-rialists and of circular argumentation, if they derive everything includingGod from matter and then argue that God is responsible for the orderingof the material realm.Plutarch’s writings against the Stoics also contain some interestinginsights on the longevity of the Demiurge. Chrysippus argues that onlyZeus and the universe are not subject to destruction, but the other godsare, also denying the other gods self-sufficiency. Cherniss regards the name‘Zeus’ atDe Stoic. Rep.1052b–c to be a synonym for the universe, thoughstrictly speaking it is probably really the divine reason active within it:27τροφῇ τε οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι θεοὶ χρῶνται παραπλησίως,συνεχόμενοι δι’αὐτήν·ὁδὲΖεὺςκαὶὁκόσμοςκαθ’ἕτερον τρόπον***ἀναλισκομένων καὶ ἐκ πυρὸςγινομένων.The other gods use nourishment similarly and they are held together by it.But Zeus and the cosmos ‘maintain themselves’ in a different manner ‘fromthose who’ perish and come into existence from fire.AtDe Stoic. Rep.1052c, Plutarch quotes from the first book of Chrysippus’On Providence, pointing out that Zeus continues growing until everythinghas been consumed in his growth. This is a reference, of course, toekpy-rosis, the periodic conflagration during which the universe is consumedby fire. Sambursky claims that ‘here the Stoics hit upon an importantphysical law which applies to closed systems that are not subject to anyinterference’.28Perhaps Sambursky was unaware that Chrysippus’ was imi-tatingTim.33c8–d3.29The destructibility of the ‘lesser gods’ is, in fact,justifiable in Platonic terms, although Plutarch here expresses oppositionto it (possibly for the purposes of polemic). After all, the Young Gods oftheTimaeusare not immortal, merely everlasting at the pleasure of theDemiurge. The Stoics, though, only believe in one God: the ‘lesser gods’are to be regarded as examples of specific powers of Zeus. In this respect,they diverge from the ontological systems advanced by Platonism (andalso by Gnosticism, though they did not engage with this tradition) and27Cherniss:1976,39228Sambursky:1959quoted by Cherniss:1976,567.29Cherniss argues that Sambursky was unaware of Br ́ehier’s discovery of this imitation."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"96Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologyare not able to attribute evil or the imperfection of the universe to lesserintermediaries.At1052d, Plutarch counters the Stoic doctrine of the self-sufficiencyof the universe, justified on the basis that nourishment is provided by theinterchange of different parts with each other.30Plutarch is not as impressedas Sambursky, arguing that since the universe is nourished by its owndecay, while the gods are nourished by the universe, they expand while theuniverse contracts. This is interesting; Plutarch refutes a Stoicised Platonictheory by using an argument fromTim.33c7–8, the passage immediatelypreceding that utilised by Chrysippus. TheTimaeuspassage runs ‘αὐτὸ γὰρἑαυτῷ τροφὴν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ φθίσιν παρέχον’ (‘for it [the cosmos] suppliednourishment for itself from its own decay’) and Plutarch’s argument is‘μόνον μὴ αὔξεσθαι τὴν αὐτοῦ φθίσιν ἔχοντα τροφὴν’ (‘only it does notgrow, having its decay as its nourishment’). It seems here that demiurgicactivity is not solely noetic action to regulate pre-existent matter, but, infact, the energy required by this activity eventually uses up the availablestore of matter, as if only a limited supply is available and the Demiurge isincapable of producing any more.Essentially, Plutarch’s objection to the Stoic conception of divinity canbe reduced, as has been done by Babut, to three main problems.31Firstly,the Stoic divinity is perishable as he is constrained by the destiny of thecosmos. In the second place, he is confused with material realities. Finally,he is deprived of all power of initiative, whereas for Plutarch, as a Platonist,these problems can be solved if the Demiurge is located in the suprasensibleworld and separated from matter. The Stoics, because of their notion ofinert and insensible matter, are forced to posit that a benevolent divinity isthe sole cause of evil.32Plutarch saw that the Stoics needed to posit a thirdterm between God and matter to justify their position and his denial ofdivine responsibility for evil is clearly a major factor in his dualism.33De Iside et OsirideIn theDe Iside et Osiride, Plutarch attempts to resolve this problem andoutlines his conception of demiurgic causality under the guise of an exe-gesis of Egyptian mythology, with Osiris representing the Demiurge. TheIsis myth is well-known: Isis’ husband, Osiris, is killed and dismembered30As expressed atSVF2.604.31Babut:1969,45432De. Stoic. Repug.104833Cf.De Iside369d: ‘If, as is the case, it is impossible that something comes to be without cause andif the good is not able to give birth to evil, it is necessary that there is in nature a separate originand principle for evil as there is for good.’"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s response to Stoic physics97by Seth-Typhon and Isis assembles the scattered pieces in order to resurrecthim, subsequently bearing him Horus. Plutarch’s treatise is a cross-culturalproduct; he sees this foreign myth as containing the same sort of meta-physical truth which had been discovered by the Greeks. To this extent,Plutarch’s exposition resembles Philo’s and Origen’s exegeses ofGenesis.The important difference is that Plutarch is examining a foreign tradition;he has much greater freedom in his interpretation than is possible for aJew or Christian examining his own tradition. The difficulty in examiningsuch a text in order to understand Plutarch’s conception of demiurgy isthat it is recounted not directly, but as an exegesis of two separate ‘origin’myths: the Isis myth as well as that of theTimaeus.The work reveals a belief in a universal providence, within the contextof which the conflict between good (represented by Isis, Osiris in variousguises and Horus) and evil (represented by Seth-Typhon) takes place; aconflict in which the Demiurge himself adopts a rather passive role. Thethird term that Plutarch requires between matter and the Demiurge here aredaimones. Isis and Osiris are themselves greatdaimones, but perfectly good,by virtue of which they become gods. Thus, the dualism of Plutarch is aconflict between two principles, not between two gods. At369d, Plutarchexcludes the idea of a god of evil:καὶ δοκεῖ τοῦτο τοῖς πλείστοις καὶ σοφωτάτοις·νομίζουσι γὰρ οἱμὲν θεοὺς εἶναι δύο καθάπερ ἀντιτέχνους,τὸν μὲν ἀγαθῶν,τὸν δὲφαύλων δημιουργόν·οἱ δὲ τὸν μὲν ἀμείνονα θεόν,τὸν δ’ἕτερον δαίμονακαλοῦσιν...And this seems to be the case to the greatest and wisest (thinkers). For somebelieve that there are two antagonistic gods, one the Demiurge of Good andthe other theDemiurgeof what is bad. And they call the better one Godand the other one thedaimon.In practice, Plutarch links the concept of a god of evil with Iranian thought(369d), while he himself prefers to shun this idea. At369c–d, strong Zoroas-trian echoes can be observed:Life and the cosmos, if not all of the cosmos at least the sublunar part whichis diverse, and variegated and subject to all kinds of change are formed fromtwo antagonistic causes, and if the good does not furnish the cause of evil, it isnecessary that Nature has the source and principle of evil, as well as of good.Interestingly here, Plutarch considers the possibility that the evil principleonly has jurisdiction ‘below the moon’, rather like the sublunar ValentinianDemiurge.

The greatdaimonesserve as intermediaries between thesupremeLogosand the ‘Powers’ or between the ‘Powers’ and men.34These‘Powers’ are lesser entities, which, on the ontological scale, rank just abovemen. This positing ofdaimones, rather like Plato’s positing of the YoungGods, helps to free the Demiurge from bearing any responsibility for theexistence of evil. However, inDe Defectu,thedaimonesassist the Demiurgeby preserving cosmic order as an additional regulatory power.35However, the problem with this aspect of the demonology is vitiatedby the active role of Isis, who also regulates the disorder of the sublunarworld and attempts to preserve it. The role played by Isis is essential inPlutarch’s understanding of the Demiurge, since she plays a much moreactive part in the preservation of the world than her husband. As Frankfortcomments: ‘Isis, the devoted, but subservient consort of Osiris, becamethe vehicle of Plutarch’s philosophy, his peculiar amalgam of Platonic andStoic views’ (though Frankfort’s study is not the most nuanced).36Addi-tionally, the demonology helps to regulate theological problems, such as theexistence of cults. However, these are relatively minor matters when com-pared to the attempt to solve the problem of evil and need not concern ushere.Incomplete matter brings forth the first creation (a product not yetordered by theLogosor divine reason). This first creation is merely the‘wraith and phantasm’ of the created world that is generated later. As Dilloncomments, it seems indicative of Isis’ desire for the order of the world, ratherthan a production of Seth-Typhon, whom Plutarch uses to represent Plato’s‘errant cause’, Necessity.37Read in terms of Plato’sTimaeus, we seem tohave an equivalent here of the limited attempt at order that took placedue to the winnowing-motion of the Receptacle. Since it is produced bymatter, it indicates that while Plutarchean matter may be, in itself, inertbefore the creation of the world, a (maleficent) soul already exists; perhapsillustrated here by the conception of the elder Horus in the womb.34Illustrated also in theDe Defectu Oraculorum,wheredaimonesconvey oracles from the gods to men.35Cherniss:1976,10036Frankfort:1951,2237Dillon:1977,204"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s response to Stoic physics99Isis is a highly symbolic figure for Plutarch’s account of demiurgy: ‘Isisis the female principle of nature,τὸ τῆς φύσεως θῆλυ, that which receivesall generation, from which arise the names ‘nurse’(τιθήνη)and‘universalreceptacle’(πανδεχής), which Plato gives here and also ‘myrionym’ (‘witha thousand names’), because under the influence of reason she under-goes change and adopts every sort of form and appearance’ (De Iside372e).As is evident here, Isis is the equivalent of the Receptacle of theTimaeus,although she also adopts the role of matter to some extent, as can be seenfrom372eff., where she is explicitly identified with matter. This is a ratherradical shift fromTim.49a–b and51a, where the Receptacle is defined asthe placein whichcreation occurs, rather than the materialoutofwhichitoccurs. However, Plutarch is not the first Platonist to equate the PlatonicReceptacle with Aristotelian matter.38While the Receptacle is more usuallyregarded as place or space, support can be found for Plutarch’s perceptionof it as matter. Plato uses terms such asἐκμαγεῖον(impression),κινούμενον(moving),διασχηματιζόμενον(shaping),τυπωθέντα(being struck), whichare difficult to reconcile with the notion of space and seem to allude to afeature such as plasticity.Another problem is that Isis is neither passive receptacle nor inert matter,but she is capable of choosing between good and evil, though naturallyinclining to what is best. Far from being recalcitrant, she actively seeksordering by the Demiurge (evidently Osiris), although she also assists indemiurgy by sowing effluxes in herself. All this suggests an active receptacle;perhaps overactive, since it is difficult to see what remains for the Demiurgeto do, other than perhaps communicating theparadeigmato Isis, who thenplays a role in ordering herself (not actually a question of creation, similarto the situation in theTimaeus).In a more implicit manner, Isis serves a role somewhat similar to Philo’sLogos-Cutter. As Plutarch comments at352d ‘it is not lawful, as Plato says,38For example compare Alcinous’Handbook of Platonism, where in Chapter8.2on matter, Alcinousmisreads theTimaeus: ‘Plato calls this [matter] a “mould” (Tim.50c), “receiver of everything”(51a), “nurse” (49a,52d,88d), “mother” (50d,51a) and “space” (52a–d) and a substrate “tangible bynon-sensation” and apprehensible only “by a sort of bastard reasoning” and he states that it hasthis characteristic, that it receives all of generation and plays the role of a nurse in sustaining it andreceiving the Forms, but it remains shapeless and qualityless and formless itself. For nothing wouldbe easily adapted for receiving a variety of imprints and shapes, unless it itself was qualityless anddid not participate in those forms which it necessarily receives itself ’ (trans. after Dillon). AlthoughAlcinous himself is later than Plutarch, it is probable that he is preserving earlier doctrines, forexample from Arius."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"100Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologyfor the pure to touch the impure’.39This would help to elucidate thepassivity of the Demiurge, as part of an increasing tendency after Plato tomove to a more transcendent First Principle. This tendency is motivatedby a variety of factors including the desire to insulate the First Principlefrom matter/responsibility for the existence of evil or attempts to clarifythe nature of the relationship between the First Principle, the demiurgicone and the Forms. Another explanation is the attempt to explain themovement from unity to multiplicity by positing an increasing number ofintermediary stages.Isis also contains elements shared by Philonic/Gnostic Sophia. At351e,Plutarch refers to her as divine wisdom, although the words he choosesareeidˆesisandphronˆesis, not Sophia.40Dillon views her as a fusion ofthe positive aspect of matter with the World-Soul, connected with thePythagorean/Old Academic Dyad and the Philonian Sophia.41I think thatthe origin of Plutarchean Isis can be found somewhere in this syncretisticmix.Isis certainly comes across as an imperfect (irrational) entity requiringcompletion by the divineLogos, and in this context Isis and the YoungerHorus neatly parallel the Gnostic pairing of Sophia and the Demiurge.Froidefond argues that Isis is not actually the incomplete Gnostic entity,but rather the Aristotelianˆetre en puissance.42He further claims that Isiscannot be identified with a disorderly World-Soul. It seems to me that Isis’search for Osiris indicates the World-Soul’s awareness of its own imperfectnature and its desire to be guided by God towards the model of the Good,even if, in fact, it is difficult to see any justification within the framework ofthe myth for Isis’ portrayal as a fallen entity. The identification of World-Soul/active Receptacle seems most plausible, given Isis’ management ofmatter. Isis’ search for Osiris can also be read in terms of theStatesmanmyth, in which God periodically rolls back the world to a vision of theGood.At372e–f, Plutarch explains how his view of demiurgic causalityworks:ἔχει δὲ σύμφυτον ἔρωτα τοῦ πρώτου καὶ κυριωτάτου πάντων,ὃ τἀγαθῷταὐτόν ἐστι,κἀκεῖνο ποθεῖ καὶ διώκει·τὴν δ’ἐκ τοῦ κακοῦ φεύγει καὶδιωθεῖται μοῖραν,ἀμφοῖν μὲν οὖσα χώρα καὶ ὕλη,ῥέπουσα δ’ἀεὶ πρὸςτὸ βέλτιον ἐξ ἑαυτῆς καὶ παρέχουσα γεννᾶν ἐκείνῳ καὶ κατασπείρειν εἰς39καθαροῦ γάρ’ᾗ φησιν ὁ Πλάτων(Phaedo67b)οὐ θεμιτὸν ἅπτεσθαι μὴ καθαρῷ·(Cf.Phaedo67b).Admittedly, there Plutarch is discussing the rationale behind the abstinence of Egyptian priests, butgiven its location, I feel that it sheds some light on the situation here.40Dillon:1977,20441Dillon:1977,20442Froidefond:1987,119"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s response to Stoic physics101ἑαυτὴν ἀπορροὰας καὶ ὁμοιότητς,αἷς χαίρει καὶ γέγηθε κυισκομένη καὶὑποπιμπλαμένη τῶν γενέσεων·εἰκὼν γάρ ἐστιν οὐσίας<ἡ>ἐν ὕλῃ γένεσιςκαὶ μίμημα τοῦ ὄντος τὸ γινόμενον.And she [Isis] has an innate love of the First Principle and the lord of all,who is the Good itself, and she desires and pursues him, but she flees andpushes away from evil and being the receptacle and matter of both shecontinuously inclines towards the Good and hands herself over to him sothat he might generate from her and sow in her emanations in his ownlikeness, she rejoices and is glad that she is impregnated with these and filledwith generation. For this generation in matter is an image of the essenceand a copy of that which really is.This text seems to posit generation from below. Matter desires form andso the Demiurge obliges, rather than the Forms becoming enmatteredor order being imposed on matter from above. Matter or Isis desires tobe ordered according to the Forms, so that she herself can participate inthe Intelligible.43Although Isis’ functions are in part identical to those ofTimaeus’ Receptacle as an active recipient, her role goes beyond that: shenot only receives and nourishes the seeds of generation, but she strengthensthem (συνίστησι375c). She divides this seminal reason (διανέμουσαν377b)and rehabilitates cosmic harmony (συναρμόττειν πάλιν373a), whenever itis threatened by disorder and destruction (φθορά).44Isis, in this context, differs from Aristotelian matter. As373b–c makesclear, sensible matter to every degree is penetrated and ordered by theForms; this development of the ‘mat ́erialisme de l’id ́ee’ishailedbyFroide-fond as the ‘phase ultime de l’ ́evolution de la pens ́ee de Platon’.45In spite ofthis management of the sensible world, Froidefond is unhappy with iden-tifying Isis with the World-Soul of theTimaeus, because by relaying to thesensibleλόγοι σπερματικοί(‘generative principles’) in a sort of continuousaction, she takes over the role of the Demiurge. However, I think thatwhile Isis cannot be exclusively identified with the Timaean World-Soul,she does act as its replacement in Plutarch, as he regards the World-Soulas present in matter. Froidefond outlines the mediating powers that existbetween transcendentLogosand theσπερματικός: immanentLogos,the43Cf. the description atDe Iside373b–c:γένεσις ̓Απόλλωνος αἰνίττεται τὸ πρὶν ἐκφαν ῆγενέσθαιτόνδε τὸν κόσμον καὶ συντελεσθῆναι τῷ λόγῳ τὴν ὕλην φύσει ἐλεγχομένην ἀφ’αὐτὴς ἀτελ ῆτὴνπρώτην γένεσιν ἐξενεγκεῖν·‘The birth of Apollo (from Isis and Osiris) hints that before the cosmos appeared and was broughtabout by reason, matter, striving to produce, imperfectly brought forth from itself this first genera-tion.’44Froidefond:1987,11645Froidefond:1987,116"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"102Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologydemiurgic World-Soul and the regulatory World-Soul.46Part of the prob-lem in interpreting Isis’ role is that she combines elements of all three.The description at373b–c, quoted above, describes the ordering of Isisin terms of physical insemination. In reality, the imagery is contradicted bypassages of theDe Iside et Osiridewhich reveal the weakness and passivityof the Osirian Demiurge. This emerges in the description of Osiris’ deadbody, in the loss of his phallus (358b) and in the weakness of Harpocrates(358e).At373a, Plutarch elaborates on the role played by the Good in theordering of matter:τὸ γὰρ ὂν καὶ νοητὸν καὶ ἀγαθὸν φθορᾶς καὶ μεταβολῆς κρεῖττόν ἐστιν·ἃςδ’ἀπ’αὐτοῦ τὸ αἰσθητὸν καὶ σωματικὸν εἰκόνας ἐκμάττεται καὶ λόγουςκαὶ εἴδη καὶ ὁμοιότητας ἀναλαμβάνει,καθάπερ ἐν κηρῷ σφραγῖδες οὐκἀεὶ διαμένουσιν,ἀλλὰ καταλαμβάνει τὸ ἄτακτον αὐτὰς καὶ ταραχῶδεςἐνταῦθα τῆς ἄνω χώρας ἀπεληλαμένον καὶ μαχόμενον πρὸς τὸν ῟\u0002ρον...For Being and the Intelligible and the Good are superior to decay and change;but the images moulded under its impression in the sensible and corporeal,the ordering-principles, the Forms and the likenesses which matter takes upjust like a seal in wax, do not persist forever, but are overtaken by disorderand disturbances which the Good, fighting agains Horus, has expelled herefrom the places above.Here the same dualistic attitude is expressed. But the Demiurge is givena much more active role than is frequently the case in Plutarch; he isinvolved in the continual creation of the world of Becoming, which wouldsoon collapse under the power of the forces of disorder were it not forhis benevolence and continual care. Isis also adopts a much more pas-sive role, since she is compared to wax which is merely stamped with animpression: no mention is made of her capacity to respond to the Goodin a manner that prompts creation. The dualism is weaker too; there isno question of the Demiurge being overcome by disorder, although inthe myth, Osiris is overcome by Seth-Typhon and indeed would have noprospect of triumphing were it not for Isis.In this passage, Osiris is beyond the reach of disorder; it is only hisproductions which can be subjected to it. One possible explanation for thechange in focus is that Plutarch here ceases to use myth and explains Isisand Osiris in philosophical terms. However, I think that what Plutarch isdescribing is the becoming world in a state of flux and the reason that the46Froidefond:1987,11"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s response to Stoic physics103Demiurge has a more active role is because he must continually transmitimages from the intelligible world to matter (the Plutarchean version ofworld-generation) in order to prevent cosmic collapse in the face of thePrinciple of Disorder.The Demiurge and the Receptacle-matter give birth to the sensible world(373a–b):...τὸν ῟\u0002ρον,ὃν ἡ ῏Ισις εἰκόνα τοῦ νοητοῦ κόσμου αἰσθητὸν ὄντα γεννᾷ·διὸ καὶ δίκην φεύγειν λέγεται νοθείας ὑπὸ Τυφῶνος,ὡς οὐκ ὢν καθαρὸςοὐδ’εἰλικρινὴς οἷος ὁ πατήρ,λόγος αὐτὸς καθ’ἑαυτὸν ἀμιγὴς καὶ ἀπαθής,ἀλλὰ νενοθευμένος τῇ ὕλῃ διὰ τὸ σωματικόν.περιγίγνεται δὲ καὶ νικᾷ τοῦ ̔Ερμοῦ,τουτέστι τοῦ λόγου,μαρτυροῦντος καὶ δεικνύοντος ὅτι πρὸς τὸνοητὸν ἡ φύσις μετασχηματιζομένη τὸν κόσμον ἀποδίδωσιν.Horus is the sensible world, which Isis has borne as an image of the noeticcosmos. It is for this reason that it is said that he is indicted because ofhis illegitimacy by Typhon, since he does not have the purity or unmixednature of his father, Reason itself which is unmixed and impassible, but he isbastardised by matter on account of his corporeality. And he gets the upperhand and obtains his victory since Hermes, that is to say Reason, comesforward as a witness and demonstrates that nature, having been altered inform in accordance with the Intelligible, produces the cosmos.From Plutarch’s interpretation here, it seems that he does not regard thesensible world as produced by the Demiurge out of matter in the Recepta-cle, but as a co-production between the Demiurge and Receptacle-matter,existing as an independent entity. Also confusing is the double mentionofΛόγος, but presumably the distinction here is between transcendentΛόγοςrepresented by Osiris and immanent reason (Hermes). Plutarch, atthis point, also has recourse to the Platonic conception of the inherent evilof matter.Horus is then forced to engage in combat with Typhon (Disorder)in a battle for survival. This, in fact, has been previously revealed byPlutarch at373a (quoted above), without the aid of an allegory. This battlebetween Horus and Seth-Typhon is Plutarch’s mechanism for harmonisinghis dualism. Typhon is revealed as essential for cosmic order at367a, whereit is claimed that a perfect world would be impossible without the igneouselement, and at371a:μεμιγμένη γὰρ ἡ τοῦδε τοῦ κόσμου γένεσις καὶ σύστασις ἐξ ἐναντίων οὐμὴν ἰσοσθενῶν δυνάμεων,ἀλλὰ τῆς βελτίονος τὸ κράτος ἐστίν·ἀπολέσ-θαι δὲ τὴν φαύλην παντάπασιν ἀδύνατον,πολλὴν μὲν ἐμπεφυκυῖαν τῷ"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"104Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologyσώματι,πολλὴν δὲ τῇ ψυχῇ τοῦ παντὸς καὶ πρὸς τὴν βελτίονα ἀεὶ δυσ-μαχοῦσαν.For the generation and composition of this cosmos comes about from themixture of opposing, but inequal, powers; the superior force is that of good,but it is impossible that the evil power would altogether disappear, since itis firmly implanted in the body, and particularly in the soul of the universeand it is continuously fighting in vain against the good.This idea echoes Hesiod’s description of the ‘mixed’ life of the humanrace.47Here Plutarch assigns Typhon a role, not merely in ensuring cosmicorder, but actually a part in demiurgy. Typhon at371b is an errant cause:...Τυφὼν δὲ τῆς ψυχῆς τὸ παθητικὸν καὶ τιτανικὸν καὶ ἄλογον καὶἔμπληκτον,τοῦ δὲ σωματικοῦ τὸ ἐπίκηρον καὶ νοσῶδες καὶ ταρακτικὸνἀωρίαις καὶ δυσκρασίαις,καὶ κρύψεσιν ἡλίου καὶ ἀφανισμοῖς σελήνης,οἷονἐκδρομαὶ καὶ ἀφηνιασμοὶ[καὶ]Τυφῶνος·And Typhon is the receptive, titanic, irrational and impulsive component ofthe [World] Soul and in the [World] body that which is subject to death andailing and disturbed and seasonal disorder and bad temperament, and solareclipses and lunar occultations, all of these are the skirmishes and seditionsof Typhon.At373c–d, Plutarch outlines another myth to explain Typhon’s role incosmic harmony, in which Hermes uses the nerves of Typhon to make thecords of the lyre:...διδάσκοντες ὡς τὸ πᾶν ὁ λόγος διαρμοσάμενος σύμφωνον ἐξ ἀσυμ-φώνων μερῶν ἐποίησε καὶ τὴν φθαρτικὴν οὐκ ἀπώλεσεν ἀλλ’ἀνεπήρωσεδύναμιν.ὅθεν ἐκείνη μὲν ἀσθενὴς καὶ ἀδρανὴς ἐνταῦθα φυρομένη καὶ προσ-πλεκομένη τοῖς παθητικοῖς καὶ μεταβολικοῖς μέρεσι.. . . teaching that Reason regulated the universe and generated harmonyfrom dissonant components and it did not destroy them utterly but onlyincapacitated their destructive power, so that they are here weak and withoutstrength, and they jumble together and attack those parts which are receptiveand subject to change.It is for this reason that, although Horus acts as a check on Typhon, he isnot permitted by Isis to kill him because she did not wish that the elementopposed to humidity should completely disappear, but she preferred thatthe mixture should subsist (367a). In any case, the existence of an ‘errantcause’, Necessity, in theTimaeusopens the way for this sort of dualistic47Froidefond:1987,117"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s response to Stoic physics105opposition. Bianchi views this as radical dualism, with a split betweenBeing and Becoming existing prior to the beginning of the world.48Bianchi also sees Seth as combining destructive aggressivity withunavoidable sterility. However, I feel that perhaps one more naturallyassociates sterility with the Plutarchean Demiurge, symbolised by loss ofthe phallus. This stresses that Osiris cannot create, but merely regulate,though taken in conjunction with the attitude expressed in theQuaestionesConvivales, it may be a rejection of the biological image of theTimaeus,which was developed by the Stoics, in favour of the technological one. Acomparison with biology is inevitable given Isis’ representation as nurseand universal receptacle, while her husband Osiris is presented as theLogosand together they have a son. This grotesque detail concerning the missingphallus seems to be provided in case we might be tempted to interpretPlutarch’s Isis allegory as a reference toLogosworking inside matter in amanner similar to procreation. Bianchi also characterises Isis in terms of‘passive receptivity’ and Seth as ‘violent reactivity’. This distorts the pic-ture; Isis as Receptacle-matter is much more active than her counterparts inother mythological systems and characterising Seth in terms of ‘reactivity’masks the fact that he is ultimately regulated to some extent by demiur-gic reasoning and owes his very existence to Isis; perhaps a Plutarcheanecho of the recalcitrance of matter, which is essentially responsible for theerrant cause. Bianchi also raises the interesting point that in Seth we havea typical example of the Demiurge-trickster found in the Gnostic systems.However, Bianchi links this identification with his view of the sterility ofSeth, whereas I feel that this is a trait more associated with Osiris (giventhe loss of his phallus).Plutarch is playing a complicated game here in his account of the Isismyth since it is a dual exegesis of an aspect of Egyptian mythology, as well asof theTimaeus. Plutarch’s interpretation of theTimaeusshapes his reactionto the Isis myth. Despite the fluidity of the allegory, Plutarch distinguishesthe Platonic triad of First Principles: Matter (Isis), Forms (transcendentOsiris) and a sort of World-Soul (immanent Osiris).49Quaestiones ConvivalesQuaestiones Convivalesis a work that has curiously been largely ignoredin terms of the background which it can provide on demiurgic causality48Bianchi:1987b,35449This same distinction is drawn also atQuaestiones Convivales720b, quoted below, where Plutarchrefers to the three principles which Plato posits in theTimaeus."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"106Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythology(though it has been analysed by Ferrari).50Admittedly, theQuaestionesare records of dinner conversations, rather than technical, philosophicaldiscussions, and are not actually cited in theCatalogue of Lamprias,buttheycontain interesting insights on certain specific details of world-generation.Booki,615f–616a, contains an allusion toTim.30a–b. Plutarch stressesthe fact that the Demiurge orders rather than produces: ‘by a generalarrangement that the great God substituted order for disorder’. He arranges,rather than creates, for it is ‘without taking away anything from that whichexisted and without adding anything and that it is in placing each thing inthe most suitable location that he generated from extreme confusion themost beautiful form for nature’.In Bookii, Plutarch raises the question of which existed first; the chickenor the egg. Though this might appear frivolous, the discussion is related toAristotle’s problem, concerning the priority of the actual or the potential.Matter is initially slow to submit itself to the weak impulsions of nature andso can only produce ‘shapeless and indefinite images’ (τύπους ἀμόρφους καὶἀορίστους) such as eggs which then produce (ἔνδημιουργρεῖσθαι) livingcreatures.51Here we have an echo of theDe Iside’s‘phantom’ of the world,spontaneously produced by matter, with the interesting use of the verbδημιουργέωto describe this action.52This is rationalised at636c–d; inevery transformation the original form must precede the resultant one. At636d, Plutarch draws an allusion to the Orphic myth which claims thatthe egg must precede all generation, because, as636e makes clear, the eggrepresents the being who generated the universe (i.e. the Demiurge) andwho contains it in himself.So far these points only add some further details to the tenets expoundedinDe Iside. The second question of Bookviiiis more enlightening. It askswhy the Demiurge continually engages in geometry. Plutarch, like hisStoic opponents, believes in the continual activity of God (even if Plutarchenvisages God as less industrious than the Stoic version). The first exegesisproposed by Tyndarus is that it underlines the role played by geometry inthe intellectual ascent towards the Forms. Florus proposes that humans,rather than the Demiurge, have need of geometry. Lycurgus raises an inter-esting point on arithmetical proportion (719b): ‘For he teaches that justiceis equal (for all) but it is not necessary to consider equality justice.’53ForLycurgus, the Demiurge preserves a sort of meritocracy by determiningthe principle of law by the principle of proportion (γεωμετρικῶς,719c).50Ferrari:1995b51Quaestiones Convivales636c52De Iside373c53This is a further way in which the activity of the Demiurge is comparable with the activity of alegislator."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Plutarch’s response to Stoic physics107Autobulus’ response is the most valuable, as he claims that without geome-try the Demiurge would have no other means of regulating the universe (apoint touched on above within the context of the sexual sterility of Osiris.)The Stoics, of course, do not posit recalcitrant matter, regarding itas completely passive. Their God, though, operates from within mattercontinuously; both the comparison of Zeus’ activity on the world to thatof soul and body expounded by Cotta at Cicero,ND3.92, and the imageof his activity within matter being similar to that of semen, imply that hisresponsibility for the world is not limited solely to the generation of thecosmos. While Plutarch conceives demiurgic activity in geometrical terms,the Stoics, in defending themselves against the Epicurean charges of anover-industrious God, claim that this interaction is effortless, like soul’sinfluence over the limbs. The most vivid image to illustrate this effortlessactivity comes from the Platonist Galen of a bird which does not appearto move in air, but, in fact, is engaged in activity to preserve its position.54The Stoics regard God as engaged in such continuous activity to preservethe cosmos.There is a major difference between both accounts of regulatory activ-ity: in Plutarch’s case, the Demiurge is continuously combating matter’snatural tendency towards disorder. In the case of the Stoics, the world iscontinuously in decline: in a passage quoted by Plutarch we learn that ‘Zeuscontinues to grow until he has used up everything on himself.’55DespiteGod’s interaction within matter, the Stoic position is that the cosmos isin continual decline. This leaves the Stoics with the problem of divineinactivity: what is God actually doing during the conflagration? If Godis to be identified with fire, we might suggest that he is still active andinvolved in cosmic dissolution. Such a claim would be unthinkable froma Platonic position: the Demiurge does not allow the dissolution of whathas been well put together. Seneca, however, claims that divine activity issuspended duringekpyrosis.56According to Philo of Alexandria, Boethusand Panaetius abandoned belief inekpyrosison such grounds and attributesthe following argument to ‘Boethus and his school’:And if, as they say, everything will be burnt up, what will God do during thisperiod? Will he do absolutely nothing?

(Philo,Aet.83)Plato’s account of the Demiurge’s geometry is not just a comment onhis continuous activity, but a reaffirmation of the technological image oftheTimaeusin opposition to the Stoics’ preference for the biological one,suggested by Autoboulus’ comment that geometry is God’s only mecha-nism for regulating the universe. Plutarch rejects the biological image ofworld-generation elsewhere. At718a, just preceding Autoboulus’ comment,Plutarch, while outlining his opposition to the notion of divine filiation,refers explicitly to the generative account of theTimaeus:ἀναθαρρῶ δὲ πάλιν αὐτοῦ Πλάτωνος(Tim.28c)ἀκούων πατέρα καὶ ποι-ητὴν τοῦ τε κόσμου καὶ τῶν ἄλλων γεννητῶν τὸν ἀγέννητον καὶ ἀίδιονθεὸν ὀνομάζοντος,οὐ διὰ σπέρματος δήπου γενομένων,ἄλλῃ δὲ δυνάμειτοῦ θεοῦ τῇ ὕλῃ γόνιμον ἀρχήν,ὑφ’ἧς ἔπαθεν καὶ μετέβαλεν,ἐντεκόν-τος...καὶ οὐδὲν οἴομαι δεινόν,εἰ μὴ πλησιάζων ὁ θεὸς ὥσπερ ἄνθρωπος,ἀλλ’ἑτέραις τισὶν ἁφαῖς δι’ἑτέρων καὶ ψαύσεσι τρέπει καὶ ὑποπίμπλησιθειοτέρας γονῆς τὸ θνητόν.And once again I find this confirmed by Plato himself, hearing him call theungenerated and eternal God the father and maker of the cosmos and of allother generated things, not at all being generated through insemination, butthe generative principle was inserted into matter by means ofanother power,rendering it passible and changeable...andIdonotthinkitstrangeifGoddoes not have sexual intercourse like a man but employsother contacts andattachments, so that he might alter mortal nature in a different manner andengender more divine offspring.At theLife of Numaiv.3, Plutarch points out that the link between manand God is not physical (one of substance), but intellectual (man is relatedto God by his desire to pursue the Good). There he rejects the notion of ahuman–divine union that is even partly physical, although here he seemsprepared to consider the strange idea that a god can impregnate a woman,although a man cannot impregnate a goddess.57However, this is expressedas an Egyptian belief, not as the view of Plutarch’s spokesman, Tyndarus.ForPlutarchonlythesoulcanberegardedasὅμοιος θεῷ.

Indeed, in hisdiscussion of the nature of divine filiation at717e–f (Quaestiones Convivalesviii, question1), Plutarch does not regard incorruptibility as compatiblewith physical insemination.This raises the question of what exactly the other contacts and attach-ments are, by which the Demiurge regulates the phenomenal realm. FromQuaestiones Convivalesviii.2it would appear that by engaging in geometry,the Demiurge inculcates the generative principle in matter, but should heever cease from geometric activity, matter would return to disorder. In theDe Iside, the quasi-material principle represented in the person of Isis by itsorientation towards the Good, appears to play a role in regulating itself. AtQuaestiones Convivales718a–b, Plutarch claims that Apis was created by thecontact of the moon.58From these divergent comments, it is possible thatPlutarch uses the phrase ‘other contacts and attachments’ as a sort of escaperoute, but is himself not very clear on the exact nature of the demiurgicimage which he is propounding.However, perhaps it is not stretching the bounds of possibility to suggestthat Plutarch is here questioning the entire demiurgic imagery, aware of itsvalue for exposition, but equally aware that God does not toil at creationlike a craftsman. If Plutarch regards the Demiurge’s geometry as these‘other contacts and attachments’, he is again rejecting the biological imageadopted by the Stoics in favour of a technological one (though representingGod as a geometrician may be more acceptable than God as an artisan). Thiswould be a neater solution, as it would take into consideration Plutarch’srejection of a biological model of world-generation elsewhere (illustratedmost graphically in the stress he lays on the loss of Osiris’ phallus). It is as ifPlutarch is drawing attention to both models, technological and biological,with the ambiguous phraseεἰ μὴ πλησιάζων ὁ θεὸς ὥσπερ ἄνθρωπος,which might be interpreted more loosely as ‘God does not fabricate like aman’, although of courseπλησιάζωis used of sexual relations.Autobulus’ Demiurge sets to work in a manner similar to Timaeus’;he first introduces numbers and proportions, then lines and contours,followed by surfaces and volumes (octahedrons, icosahedrons, pyramids58...ἀλλ’Αἰγύπτιοι τόν τ’῏Απιν οὕτως λοχεύεσθαί φασιν ἐπαφῇ τῆς σελήνης,‘...ButtheEgyptianssay that Apis is born by contact of the moon’.

This could perhaps beexplained as Osiris’ continual conflict with Typhon, but this cannot maskthe shift in the portrayal of the quasi-material principle (Isis) here. In theDe Isideit is attracted to the good, but here it has a predisposition towardsevil, or at least disorder. I think that the answer to this problem can befound in the response of Plutarch which follows (720b):...ἡ μὲν οὖν ὕλη τῶν ὑποκειμένων ἀτακτότατόν ἐστιν,ἡδ’ἰδέα τῶνπαραδειγμάτων κάλλιστον,ὁ δὲ θεὸς τῶν αἰτίων ἄριστον.ἐβούλετ’οὖνμηθέν,ὡς ἀνυστὸν ἦν,ὑπολιπεῖν ἄχρηστον καὶ ἀόριστον,ἀλλὰ κοσμῆσαιλόγῳ καὶ μέτρῳ καὶ ἀριθμῷ τὴν φύσιν,ἕν τι ποιῶν ἐκ πάντων ὁμοῦτῶν ὑποκειμένων,οἷον<ἡ>ἰδέα καὶ ὅσον ἡ ὕλη γενόμενον.διὸ τοῦτοπρόβλημα δοὺς αὑτῷ,δυεῖν ὄντων τρίτον ἐποίησε καὶ ποιεῖ καὶ φυλάττειδιὰ παντὸς τὸ ἴσον τῇ ὕλῃ καὶ ὅμοιον τῇ ἰδέᾳ τὸν κόσμον·Therefore matter is the most disorderly substrate, Form is the most beautifulparadigm and God is the best cause.

Having been given this problem, from these two, he made, and hemakes a third, the cosmos, and he continually preserves it and it is equal tomatter and it approximates to the Form.Here the Demiurge is ordering, but by virtue of doing that, it appears thathe is creating a new product.

(In any case, it expresses a Middle Platonist viewpoint). Destinyis the action of the World-Soul, divided into three parts, corresponding tothe three Moirai – the highest is Clotho, followed by Atropos and Lachesis,who receives the more celestial activities of her sisters and transmits themto men.59They can be viewed either as a stable element, an errant elementand a terrestrial/sublunar element or a Supreme Providence (volition of thefirst God), a second Providence (that of the heavenly Gods) and the thirdthat of thedaimones(573a). The cosmos is governed by divine law, whichhas an existence outside the Demiurge, not existing as his thoughts; inthe same way that he regulates the world by mathematical principles thathe does not produce. This destiny still preserves independence of action(throughTycheand Free-Will), but has the advantage of not making theDemiurge responsible for the existence of evil.Other textsTheQuaestiones Convivalesyield more information on demiurgy than themore technicalQuaestiones Platonicae. Here, the most relevant point raisedis at1002e–3a:τί δήποτε,τὴν ψυχὴν ἀεὶ πρεσβυτέραν ἀποφαίνων τοῦ σώματος αἰτίαν τετῆς ἐκείνου γενέσεως καὶ ἀρχήν,πάλιν φησὶν(Tim.30b)οὐκ ἂν γενέσθαιψυχὴν ἄνευ σώματος οὐδὲ νοῦν ἄνευ ψυχῆς ἀλλὰ ψυχὴν μὲν ἐν σώματινοῦν δ’ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ;δόξει γὰρ τὸ σῶμα καὶ εἶναι καὶ μὴ εἶναι,συνυπάρχονἅμα τῇ ψυχῇ καὶ γεννώμενον ὑπὸ τῆς ψυχῆς.Why then does he announce that the soul is always older than the bodyand the cause and starting-point of its generation and again he says (Tim.30b) that the soul could not have been generated without body, nor mindwithout soul, but soul in body and mind in soul? For it seems that the bodyboth is and is not, if it is coexistent with soul and generated by soul.This passage is modelled uponTim.30b3–5.60Plutarch answers the ques-tion at1003, pointing out that the soul does not fabricate (ἐδημιούργει)59Echoing Plato’sLaws960c, Arist.,De Mundo40b14.60...νοῦν δ’αὖ χωρὶς ψυχῆς ἀδύνατον παραγενέσθαι τῳ.διὰ δὴ τὸν λογισμὸν τόνδε νοῦν μὲν ἐνψυχῇ,ψυχὴν δ’ἐν σώματι συνιστὰς τὸ πᾶν συνετεκταίνετο,ὅπως ὅτι κάλλιστον εἴη κατὰ φύσινἄριστόν τε ἔργον ἀπειργασμένος.‘ . . . and it is not possible that mind belongs to anything except soul.

For Plutarch, this helps toexplain how amorphous and indefinite matter (ἡ ἄμορφος ὕλη καὶ ἀόρισ-τος,1003b) acquires form and a specific disposition (διάθεσις) through theinteraction of soul upon it. Plutarch may infer this from the description ofthe Demiurge putting the soul into the body of the cosmos.Some further light can be thrown on the issue of demiurgic causality byturning toDe E. Of the seven possible interpretations of the symbolismbehind the E at Delphi, only the response of Ammonius, since it deals withthe most elevated issues, need concern us here (De E392a–b):ἡμῖν μὲν γὰρ ὄντως τοῦ εἶναι μέτεστιν οὐδέν,ἀλλὰ πᾶσα θνητὴ φύσις ἐνμέσῳ γενέσεως καὶ φθορᾶς γενομένη φάσμα παρέχει καὶ δόκησιν ἀμυδρὰνκαὶ ἀβέβαιον αὑτῆς·We do not participate in Real Being, but all mortal nature, being rankedbetween generation and destruction, supplies itself an obscure and incon-stant appearance and apparition.Ammonius draws the Platonic distinction between Being and Becoming,before going on to expound the continual temporal generation at392d.61This, likeQuaestiones Convivales719d, posits a continually active Demi-urge, similar to Plato, and at odds with the passivity of Osiris. Ammoniusdescribes Real Being at392e:τί οὖν ὄντως ὄν ἐστι;τὸ ἀίδιον καὶ ἀγένητον καὶ ἄφθαρτον,ᾧ χρόνοςμεταβολὴν οὐδὲ εἷς ἐπάγει.κινητὸν γάρ τι καὶ κινουμένῃ συμφανταζόμενονὕλῃ καὶ ῥέον ἀεὶ καὶ μὴ στέγον,ὥσπερ ἀγγεῖον φθορᾶς καὶ γενέσεως,ὁχρόνος·What is Real Being? The eternal and ungenerated and indestructible, whichdo not undergo change in time. For time is in motion and is to be imaginedalong with matter and it is in constant flux and unrestrained, so that it islike the vessel of generation and destruction.Plutarch here places the Demiurge beyond the reach of the evil principle. Ashas previously been illustrated, the evil principle is not equal in power to theDemiurge. By Real Being, Plutarch must be referring to the transcendentLogosrepresented in theDe Isideby the soul of Osiris, rather than theimmanentΛόγοςrepresented by his body, which is subject to Time.61μένει δ’οὐδεὶς οὐδ’ἔστιν εἷς,ἀλλὰ γιγνόμεθα πολλοί,περὶ ἕν τι φάντασμα καὶ κοινὸν ἐκμαγεῖονὕλης περιελαυνομένης καὶ ὀλισθανούσης.‘No one continues or stays the same, but we are many beings, and around us is a common appearanceand an impression of matter moves around and glides along.’"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Other texts113De Animae Procreatione in TimaeoSome interesting points can be gleaned fromDe Animae Procreatione, whichalong withQuaestiones Platonicae, is the only surviving exegetical treatise ofPlutarch. However, as Cherniss comments on Plutarch’s supposedly literalinterpretation of theTimaeus: ‘his motive was not strict fidelity to Plato’swords, but concern to enlist Plato’s authority for the proposition that theuniverse was brought into being by God’.62As Cherniss also points out,there is little in the treatise that is original and it is interesting mainly dueto information which it provides on earlier treatments of theTimaeus.63AlthoughDe. An.

At1012b–c, PlutarchadaptsStat.273b4–6, but omits the precedingτὸ σωματοειδὲς τῆς συγ-κράσεωςwhich would undermine his interpretation.66At1024cPlutarchequatesχώρα(Receptacle) withὕλη(matter). At1014b–c and1016d–1017a,he identifiesχώραwith ‘precosmic’ chaos. At1015d–e, Plutarch inverts thesituation, equatingὕληwithχώρα:ὁ γὰρ Πλάτων μητέρα μὲν καὶ τιθήνηνκαλεῖ τὴν ὕλην,αἰτίαν δὲ κακοῦ τὴν κινητικὴν τῆς ὕλης. (‘For Plato callsmatter the mother and nurse and he calls the motion of matter the cause ofevil’), ignoring the fact that Plato actually calls the Receptacle Mother andNurse. Cherniss and Hershbell both censure Plutarch for this wilful dis-tortion of Plato’s thought. Yet Plutarch synthesisedὕληandχώραinto theReceptacle-matter represented by Isis and so for him they both representthe same thing (as they did for other Platonists, as a result of Aristotelianinfluence). Indeed, identification between the two is justifiable in terms oftheTimaeustext, as has been noted above.Plutarch has been severely criticised for his reading of theTimaeusatDe An. Proc.1012b–c.

This implies that for sameness and for difference,the divisible and indivisible kinds are mixed together. Plutarch’s reading is‘and as far as concerns the nature of sameness and that of difference, hecompounded it in this manner, in the middle, out of the indivisible andwhat is divisible among bodies’.Opsomer provides an extensive analysis of the matter, which I shall justtrace over briefly.67Essentially, Plutarch interprets the soul as the mixtureof sameness, difference and the blend of divisible and indivisible being.As indivisible being for Plutarch represents the intelligible, the realm ofthe Demiurge, this is how Plutarch is led to claim that something of theDemiurge is imparted to soul (cf. Quaest. Plat.ii.1001c). At1014–17,itis clear that Plutarch’s idea of world-generation is different from that ofcreatio ex nihilo. The Demiurge creates the cosmos fromἀρχαί(precosmicprinciples consisting of disorganised corporeality (τὸ σωματικόν) and irra-tional motivity (τὸ κινητικόν)). This principle combines the ‘infinitude’(ἀπειρία)ofthePhilebus, the ‘Necessity’ (ἀναγκή)ofTim.52d, with thedisorderly soul ofLawsx. Although the Demiurge of theTimaeuscreatessoul (even though he regulates matter), and Plutarch is generally thoughtof as favouring a literal reading of theTimaeus, Plutarch’s Demiurge onlyregulates soul by combining it withνοῦς.At1014d–e and1015e, Plutarch disregards the fact that in theLaws,Plato does not refer to the evil aspect of soul as precosmic to beneficialsoul, but describes it as coeval with good souls. Given Plutarch’s markeddualistic tendencies, this might appear to be an acceptable manoeuvre. Butat1023c, Plutarch argues that the Demiurge’s relationship to soul is that ofproducer to product. Since the Demiurge introducesνοῦς, which is a partof the Demiurge, the soul is akin to God, rather than his finished product.This makes the indivisible being of theTimaeuspractically identical tothe Demiurge.68If the ungenerated universe is coeval with soul (1013e–f ),this neither provides strong evidence that God exists or any reason forhis existence, when the Demiurge’s existence requires that the soul of the67Opsomer:2004,passim68Cherniss:1976,142"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Conclusion115universe has its beginning prior to that of the corporeal cosmos.69He doesalso refer, atQuaest. Plat.,1001c, to the soul as not just the product, but apart of God (οὐκ ἔργον ἐστὶ τοῦ θεοῦ μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ μέρος).This is all in accordance with Plutarch’s views that soul exists and iscapable of causing motion, prior to the addition of harmony and orderby the Demiurge (clearly an attitude taken directly from the pages of theTimaeus), but the motion that it caused was disorderly. To this extent itis a cause of evil (cf.1027a). The Demiurge’s great contribution is to bindsameness and difference by means of the intermediate terms of indivisibleand divisible and to use this ordered soul to transmit harmony lower downthe ontological scale.ConclusionPlutarch’s most distinctive doctrines, his dualism and his belief in tem-poral world-generation contrary to the majority of Platonic interpreters,such as Speusippus, Xenocrates and Crantor, shapes his understanding ofthe mechanics of demiurgy, as can be seen fromDe Iside et Osiride.Whilesome other passages of Plutarch indicate less originality, the fact that theDe Isidecontains his essential thoughts on this matter is illustrated bythe confirmation provided by certain other texts.Plutarch’s demiurgic system owes a great deal to his attempts to extricatehimself from many of the problems he saw encountered by Stoicism: aprocedure which has earned him censure as an eclectic. As Dillon com-ments: ‘In fact there is nothing at all wrong with being “eclectic” if thatmeans simply that one is prepared to adopt a good formulation, or avalid line of argument, from a rival school or individual and adjust one’sphilosophical position accordingly. In this sense, most of the great philoso-phers are eclectics, and eclecticism is a mark of acuteness and originality asopposed to narrow-minded sectarianism.’70Plutarch should be viewed asan original ‘thinker’ (although perhaps ‘philosopher’ would be stretchingthe point), who adapted ideas from rival schools and was even preparedto distort Plato’s thought to produce a modified version of demiurgiccausality, which resolved the problem of evil. His skill in doing this, aswell as the open-mindedness he displayed in his cross-cultural project,DeIside, which investigated two traditions, Egyptian and Greek, in order toidentify a universal truth, has not perhaps been adequately appreciated.69Cherniss:1976,14870Dillon:1988b,103"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"116Plutarch and the Demiurge of Egyptian mythologyPlutarch was very much in the vanguard of attempts to use the Timaeusas the philosophical subtext which could unlock the meaning of thegenerational/creational accounts of other religious/intellectual traditions,such as can be observed in Philo, as well as the Gnostic, Hermetic andChristian traditions.Plutarch’s opposition to the Stoics appears to be not just philosophical,but also religious. He is typical of the objection to Stoic theological belieffound amongst the Platonists and Peripatetics. The Stoics degrade God,from Plutarch’s point of view, in their representation of him as immanent.They lay themselves open to the charge of failing to distinguish betweenboth of their metaphysical principles: if God is active within matter, wheredoes God end and matter begin? The Stoics are frequently representedas materialists. This is not entirely accurate. If God works on matter ina manner similar to semen than the Stoics are vitalists, not materialists.While this biological image can claim a Timaean pedigree, Plutarch rejectsit in favour of the technological image of demiurgy. From a Platonic per-spective, their logic also appears weak and attacking it is one of Plutarch’sfavoured polemical techniques.

Maximus’ forty-one orations tend to focus on practical morality,although some have a bearing on theology. Unfortunately, Maximus treatsthe problem of demiurgy (and indeed practically every other philosophicalproblem that he encounters) in a superficial way. Modern scholarship onMaximus has tended to focus on emendation of the text (notably by Trappand Renehan), or on attempts to locate Maximus within the current ofMiddle Platonism. Puiggali’s magisterial study provides a comprehensivesurvey of Maximus’ orations themselves and reveals how fruitful a detailedinvestigation of the writings of thisHalbphilosophcan be.As a result of the nature of his philosophicaloeuvre(introductory lec-tures to students of philosophy), he does not provide a detailed analysisof the problems of theTimaeus, but only some standardised interpreta-tions of certain points of Platonist metaphysics.

Maximus also concerns himself equally with how the Demiurgecontinually cares for or administers the cosmos, as well as the generativeact itself. Perhaps because of his personal religious views, he stresses divinetranscendence (through his articulation of the power of Zeus’ ‘nod’ ordivine assent). Maximus, in general, does not consider how the mechan-ics of demiurgy function, although he does consider how a continuousontological link can be formed from the Demiurge to mankind throughthedaimones. One of his most interesting insights is the deeply-allusivereference to Anaximander’s philosophy through the medium of the mar-riage of Zeus and Chthonie as a metaphor for the principle of harmony.(Thestoryitself,asitappearsinMaximus,derivesfromPherecydes.)ForMaximus, the Demiurge is the supreme god, though he stresses the unityof the divine, regarding various deities as functioning in association withone another, while they may have their own alloted spheres. Though Max-imus speculates regarding the limits which Necessity imposes upon theDemiurge during world-generation, as well as during his continual gover-nance of the cosmos, he mainly expounds the metaphysics of theTimaeusin an engaging literary fashion, rather than developing the philosophicalissues involved.Oration 11Oration11:τίς ὁ θεὸς κατὰ Πλάτωνα, ‘What is God according to Plato?’ isan account of the opinions which Maximus believed that Plato held con-cerning the divinity. God is portrayed as a supreme, transcendent intellect.One cannot really hope for a critical analysis of the Platonic Demiurgefrom Maximus’ opening statement, where he asserts that only a fool wouldadvance an opinion when even Plato, despite his eloquence, was unable tocompose a convincing account of God. §5expresses a belief in a demiur-gic God who rules assisted by subordinates.

Both Heinsius and the corrector of Harl(possibly Janus Lascarius) observed a problem here with the readingsκαὶ<νοεῖ καὶ>πέφυκεν(Heinsius, ‘both actually thinks and has the naturalcapacity’) andκαὶ πέφυκεν<καὶ νοεῖ>(Harl.5760)post corr.(‘both hasthe natural capacity and actually thinks’).Trapp observed that light can be shed on the problem by a similarpassage,Chapter10of theDidaskalikosof Alcinous (itself probably deriv-ing from the doxographic work of Arius Didymus:ἐπεὶ δὲ ψυχῆς νοῦςἀμείνων,νοῦ δὲ τοῦ ἐν δυνάμει ὀ κατ’ἐνέργειαν πάντα νοῶν καὶ ἅμα καὶἀεί: ‘Since intellect is superior to soul and superior to potential intellectthere is actualised Intellect which cognises everything simultaneously andeternally’ (Didasc.10.2, trans. Dillon). The distinction between a potentialand actualised Intellect was ultimately Aristotelian, but is a standard partof Middle Platonist theology, which Trapp observes is likely to be foundhere, as the passage evinces a ‘more than usual dependance upon scholasticmaterial’.1As Trapp’s reading actually develops a pointed statement, it isthe one which I follow here. The passage highlights the Platonic perceptionof demiurgy as noetic activity. Maximus draws a further distinction: ‘Yet1Trapp:1991,569"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"120A simplified understanding of God: Maximus of Tyreeven this latter does not yet rank as perfect intellect, unless you add toit the further properties of thinking eternally and thinking all things andnot thinking differently at different times. Thus the most perfect form ofintellect is that which thinks all things for ever and at the same time.’Maximus here seems to be close to Berkeley’s view that all objects havea continuous existence in the mind of God. God thinking eternally thesame things seems to posit a continual noetic creation. This may be seenas straining the text, but in the introduction to this section, Maximusquestions ‘For what being can be stable, if God does not touch it lightly?’(11.8.165–7), which seems to indicate his belief in the Demiurge’s orderingof the cosmos in this manner.Conflicting concepts of the Demiurge in MaximusA much more promising oration for present purposes isOration41:τοῦθεοῦ τὰ ὰγαθὰ ποιοῦντος,πόθεν τὰ κακά, ‘Good being the work ofGod, from where does evil come?’ In this attempt to solve the problemof evil, Maximus expresses certain interesting comments concerning themechanics of demiurgy. He adopts a Stoicising attitude – after absolvingthe gods from responsibility for evil, he claims that evil either results fromalterations to matter or from human freedom of choice. This echoes hisstance atOration2, in which he elegantly expresses a platitude concerningthe manner in which the demiurgic intellect pervades the universe. Thedemiurgic intellect is like the sun’s light simultaneously embracing all partsof the earth and ordering it. Human intelligence, by contrast, resemblesthe daily passage of the sun; it gradually passes over each individual pointof the earth in turn.InOration41, Maximus then draws the commonplace Platonic dis-tinction between the suprasensible and sublunar realms. In an argu-ment familiar from theTimaeus, Maximus states that the suprasensiblerealm is insulated from evil, while the sublunar realm possesses good,whichflowsdowntoitfromabove,althoughitalsopossessesevilsasa result of its own inherent imperfections (ἐξ αὐτοφυοῦς μοχθηρίας).2Maximus distinguishes between two kinds of imperfections: the modi-fication of physical matter (ὕλης πάθος) and the freedom of the soul(ψυχῆς ἐξουσία). Maximus combines both of the traditional explanationsfor the existence of evil: the inherent evil of matter and human free will.2Oration41.4.109–13"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Conflicting concepts of the Demiurge in Maximus121There appears to be a process of emanation by which the lower realmreceives necessary goods, indicating that the Demiurge continues to carefor the sublunar realm, though it is not stated expressly here.3The notionthat the earth is a blend of good and evil echoes Plato’s portrayal of thecosmos as a blend of Reason and Necessity. Maximus’ view of the inherentimperfections of the cosmos still parallels Plato’s view that the cosmos is thebest type that can exist. But what is particularly noteworthy is Maximus’explanation of physical evil:ὕλης πάθος. It was common for second-centuryPlatonists to oppose God, the source of Good, and recalcitrant matter, thesource of evil. As Simone P ́etrement comments ‘Au second si`ecle apr`es J ́esus-Christ, les platoniciens sont nettement dualistes: Plutarque, Maxime de Tyr,Atticus,Hermog`ene, Celse, Num ́enius d’ Apam ́ee, Cronius, Harpocrationopposent profond ́ement Dieu`a la mati`ere au point que la plupart d’entre euxfont de celle-ci le principe du mal.’4The problem is that Maximus here does not speak of matter as beingresponsible for evil, but rather the modifications which matter undergoesto create the cosmos; a Stoic turn of phrase. Maximus is not dualist inthe same sense as certain other Platonists, who view world-generation asan ongoing conflict between the Demiurge and matter; or indeed in themanner of Plutarch and Numenius, who posit an evil or an irrationalsoul as a third principle. Maximus is only dualist in the sense that like allPlatonists, he draws a sharp distinction between the intelligible world andthe realm of phenomena.5The difficulty with Maximus’ Stoic formulation here is that he is stillpreserving the Platonic transcendent divinity, while the Stoic explanationof evil operates in the context of a monistic system, with God and matterperpetually united. Admittedly, other Platonists during this period alsoadopted the Stoic formulation. Regarding the existence of evil as a by-product of the creation of the cosmos still makes the Demiurge responsiblefor evil, although Maximus does not seem to think that this is the case.After all, an industrialist is still responsible for harmful by-products, eventhough the end product of the process may be valuable:ὕλην ὁρᾷς ὑποβεβλημένην δημιουργῷ ἀγαθῷ,ἧς τὸ μὲν κοσμηθὲν ἥκειπαρὰ τῆς τέχνης,εἰ δέ τι ἀκρατῶς ἑαυτῶν τὰ ἐν γῇ ἔχοντα πάσχειπλημμελές,ἀναίτιόν μοι τὴν τέχνην τίθει·βούλησις γὰρ οὐδεμία τεχνί-του ἄτεχνος,οὐδὲ γὰρ νομοθέτου ἄδικος·ὁ δὲ θεῖος νοῦς ἀνθρωπίνης3ἧ τὰ μὲν ἀγαθὰ ἐπίρρυτα ἐκ τῆς ἑτέρας.

For no craftsman has a desire that is contrary to his craft, for alawgiver does not desire what is unjust, and the divine mind has a steadieraim than the art of man. Just as in practising the crafts, the craft producessome things directly, striving after its goals and other things follow itspractice, not as the word of the craft, but as affectations of matter, justlike sparks from an anvil or clouds of sooty smoke from the furnace andother affectations from other things, which necessarily arise from the work,but which the craftsman does not directly produce. No different are theaffectations on the earth, which we call attacks of human evil. Here it isnecessary that we suppose that the craft is without blame and are naturaland necessary consequences of the demiurgy of the whole. What we call eviland destruction and what we cry over, the craftsman calls the conservationof the whole. (41.4.114–31)I have quoted this passage at length as it is one of Maximus’ most detaileddiscussions of demiurgic causality. Maximus is evidently alluding to theAristotelian concept of accidental causation.6Here the demiurgic imageis developed at the expense of philosophical coherence; if the Demiurgereally creates the cosmos in the same manner as a blacksmith works, hewould cease to be a transcendent divinity. The comparison of the Demiurgewith the lawmaker is perhaps more apt, placing him in the position of aregulator, rather than a creator, although it is a Platonic commonplace.Maximus indicates that there are restrictions on the Demiurge when hecreates the universe, although unlike many other philosophers, he is reticentas to what exactly these are.Fortunately, Maximus elaborates on why exactly the Demiurge is not tobe blamed for the production (albeit indirect) of evil (§4) by regarding itas preservation of the whole: ‘for he is concerned for the whole and it isnecessary that the part suffers for the benefit of the whole’. For Maximus,6Cf. ps.-Alex.,Mantissap.17ff."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Conflicting concepts of the Demiurge in Maximus123evil does not exist on the physical plane; its existence is merely a humanperception. In fact, these so-called evils are useful, necessary as they arefor the preservation of the cosmos as a whole. This is a typically Platoniststance; God orders on a macrocosmic level, but there is no real belief intheodicy for the individual (though see the discussion below). Physicalevil is a human conception, because men are unable to comprehend theintentions of the divinity. This idea of minor unpleasantness resulting fromgenerative activity had been previously adopted by other Platonists7andcan be justified by reference to Plato (Lawsx.903b), but it is ultimatelyStoic.8The demiurgic image above contrasts sharply with a parallel accountof demiurgic causality, which exists in the same sermon, in which theuniverse takes form in response to Zeus’νεῦμα(nod or divine assent).9ForMaximus, the Demiurge’sνεῦμαis a sign of his power. World-generationtakes place merely by his assenting to it. This also helps to preserve his statusas a transcendent deity and to insulate him from matter. Incidentally,matter in Maximus’ conception here must be inert or actually desire tobe ordered. Here also, no mention is made of any force opposing theDemiurge during the act of world-generation. Unfortunately, one cannotavoid reading this passage without the same feeling of disappointment thatone experienced upon encountering Plutarch’s view that the Demiurgegenerates the universe ‘by other contacts and attachments’. In both cases itseems to provide an escape route that is a little too convenient. Maximus’description of Zeus’ nod allows him to preserve the dignity of his chiefdivinity, but it also absolves him from having to engage in any seriousphilosophical enquiry on how the Demiurge operates on matter or ordersit.Apart from seeming to abandon the (Stoicising) Platonist conception ofmatter as an independent or quasi-independent principle here, Maximusalso makes no mention of the World-Soul or how he perceives that itshould operate within his system; it seems that the divine intelligence ofZeus’νεῦμαis enough to pervade the cosmos.10This image of Zeus’νεῦμαis used also inOration4, when Maximus isconsidering the accounts of the gods produced by poets and philosophers.7Phil.,Prov.(Armenian tr.)100,102,104,Aurelius,6.36,7.758E.g.SVF2.11709Oration41.2.51–410The importance of the divineνεῦμαas an illustration of the authority of Zeus is exhibited also byAtticus at Eusebius,Pr.

The revolution of theheavens, the birth of the animals and the growth of trees are likewiseaspects of world-generation examined in theTimaeus. Zeus’νεῦμαalsoregulates human interaction: ‘human virtue and human happiness arelikewise products of Zeus’ nod of assent’.Here again, though the Demiurge is not really involved in creating orindeed in ordering; all he has to do is assent to world-generation andmatters, or rather matter, takes care of itself. This is underlined by thereference to human virtue as equally the product of Zeus’ nod of assent.AtOration5.8.193–5, Maximus considers Socrates prayer to the gods in thecontext of human virtue as a divine gift. Socrates’ virtue and blameless lifemight beτὰ θαυμαστὰ δῶρα,τὰ θεοῖς δοτά, ‘amazing divine gifts’, but hereceives them from the gods, not on account of his prayer, but on his ownaccount (παρ’ἑαυτοῦ). It is as if Socrates appeals to God to allow himto be virtuous, but promises himself to take care of it. In Maximus’ view,everything appears to regulate itself to some degree, although perhaps theνεῦμαof Zeus is more than just an assent, but rather the initial impetusrequired to start the process of world-generation, followed by a less activerole where the Demiurge engages in continual production ‘by thinking thesame things’.Limits imposed upon the DemiurgeMaximus frequently alludes to the limits placed upon demiurgy by externalfactors. For example atOration13(8.163–7), he considers the principleof Necessity. Maximus finds it difficult to define (or name:ὀνομάσαι)this principle and considers whether it should be equated with destiny,although this does not help to clarify its nature (φύσις) or essence (οὐσία).Unfortunately, Maximus shies away from any attempt to investigate theprinciple of Necessity and indulges instead in Homeric quotation andmoralising. People, like Elpenor, who claim to have been led astray by thegods are simply trying to evade their moral responsibility.11Maximus does, however, engage in a somewhat more ‘scientific’ studyof other factors that affect the Demiurge’s relationship with the world inOration 5:εἰ δεῖ εὔχεσθαι, ’Whether One Ought to Pray’. Maximus hereconsiders God’s relationship with the world. Four factors, other than the11Oration13.8.167–79"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Limits imposed upon the Demiurge125Demiurge, play a role in causality: Providence, Destiny, Fortune/Chanceand Science. A demarcation dispute exists between these factors and it isunclear what distinction Maximus intends between them. LikeOration41,this provides another opportunity to absolve the Demiurge from responsi-bility for the existence of evil, although in that sermon also Maximus tendsto rely more on moralising assertion than upon reasoned philosophicalargument. ‘God does not distribute evils; they are rather the gift of chancecoming blindly from their unreasoning source like the cheery greetingsof drunkards.’12Here, though, Maximus gives a brief outline of the roleplayed by each of these factors:καὶ ἡ μὲν πρόνοια θεοῦ ἔργον,ἡ δὲ εἱμαρμένη ἀνάγκης,ἡδὲτέχνηἀνθρώπου,ἡ δὲ τύχη τοῦ αὐτομάτου·διακεκλήρωνται δὲ τούτων ἑκάστῳαἱ ὗλαι τοῦ βίου·ἃ τοίνυν εὐχόμεθα,ἢ εἰς πρόνοιαν συντελεῖ θεοῦ ἢ εἰςεἱμαρμένης ἀνάγκην ἢ εἰς ἀνθρώπου τέχνην ἢ εἰς τύχης φοράν.Providence is the work of God, Destiny that of Necessity, craftsmanship thework of man and Fortune the work of random spontaneity and the materialof life is allocated to one of these. What we pray for must be completed bythe Providence of God or by fated Necessity or by the craft of man or bythe act of Fortune. (5.4.83–7)Maximus adheres to the Platonist opposition to Destiny as the sole factor incausality, as opposed to the Stoic unification of Providence and Destiny andtheir denial of the existence of Chance.13Platonist accounts can be found atDe Fato,Didasc.26andDe Plat.1.12. Trapp states ‘Quite what distinctionMaximus himself intends here and in §§4–5between Providence andDestiny remains obscure’.14However at §4, Maximus refers to Providenceas that exercised by God on behalf of the generated world as a whole; soI believe that it represents demiurgic Reason. This fits with the generalPlatonic view that nature or Providence is only secondary to the causalityof the Demiurge, caused as it is by the agents which he has created.15Since Destiny is explicitly said to be the work ofἀνάγκη,itmustbeMaximus’ equivalent of the Necessity which Plato’s Demiurge has to con-front in theTimaeus, despite his hesitance to equate the two at13.8.163–71.Perhaps, the real problem here is not the distinction between Providenceand Destiny, but rather how Fortune and Science play a role in the act of12Oration5.1.22–5;Cf.Tim.30a.13Trapp:1997,4514Tr a p p :1997,4515For example, the Young Gods of theTimaeusplay a role in cosmic order and might all be referredto under the general heading of Providence. They are, obviously, in no way a limitation on theactivity of the Demiurge, since they owe their existence to him.

Maximus’ lack of interest in the more technicalaspects of metaphysics appears in the statement that the raw material(αἱ ὕλαιcould equally be applied to matter, although the use of the pluralcreates a certain degree of ambivalence) is allocated to one of the four fac-tors, but Maximus is not overly interested in which one. Furthermore, whoor what exactly does the allocating? Another problem exists concerning theprecise nature ofεἰμαρμένης ἀνάγκη. How exactly is Necessity destined?Presumably in the same sense as in Plato’sTimaeus; certain features can-not of necessity be combined by the Demiurge in the production of thephenomenal realm and so in this mannerἀνάγκηis preordained.Maximus, like Plato, stresses that the Demiurge, not just in the actof world-generation, but even in his theodicy, is bound by Necessity,discussing the famous example of Zeus being forced to consent to thedeath of his son, Sarpedon, at the hands of Patroclus (Il.16.433–4). In fact,in the parallel that Maximus uses, Zeus was capable of overruling Fate,but chose not to do so, as the other gods would have disapproved. I thinkthat Maximus’ suppression of this aspect is deliberate, not an oversight,since introducing this point would vitiate the efficacy of this allegory; theDemiurge cannot go against the dictates of Necessity. In Maximus’ secondexample, fromIl.18.54, when Thetis laments the impending death of herson, she is suffering as the result of Achilles’ free choice (to die a gloriousdeath). Admittedly, in both cases Maximus is discussing Providence withinthe context of its influence over human lives, rather than any role it mayplay in world-generation. However, the example of Zeus is indicative ofhow Maximus conceptualises the interrelation between God/the Demiurgeand factors which limit his activity.Maximus goes on to describe Fortune, but in a manner that is particularlyvague and so it is difficult to work out what kind of restriction this couldimpose upon the Demiurge:ἀλλ’οὐδὲ ἐν τοῖς κατὰ τὴν τύχην εὐκτέον,καὶ πολὺ μᾶλλον ἐνταῦθα οὐκεὐκτέον·οὐδὲ γὰρ ἀνοήτῳ δυνάστῃ διαλεκτέον,ἔνθα οὐ βούλευμα οὐδὲκρίσις οὐδὲ ὁρμὴ σώφρων οἰκονομεῖ τὴν ἀρχήν,ἀλλὰ ὀργὴ καὶ φορὰ καὶἄλογοι ὀρέξεις καὶ ἔμπληκτοι ὁρμαὶ καὶ ἐπιθυμιῶν διαδοχαί.τοιοῦτον ἡτύχη,ἄλογον,ἔμπληκτον,ἀπροόρατον,ἀνήκοον,ἀμάντευτον,Εὐρίπουδίκην μεταρρέον,περιφερόμενον,καὶ οὐδεμιᾶς ἀνεχόμενον κυβερνήτουτέχνης.τί ἂν οὖν τις εὔξαιτο ἀστάτῳ χρήματι καὶ ἀνοήτῳ καὶ ἀσταθμήτῳκαὶ ἀμίκτῳ;But it is not possible to pray about matters governed by Fortune and it is nomore possible to pray in this case (than in other cases).

Therefore whatprayer might one make to something so unstable and irrational and unsteadyand disharmonious? (5.6.135–44)This description is very loosely modelled on the description of the tyrantatRep.571aff., but it is difficult to read this passage as anything more thanan elaborate literary flourish. It also seems that in a world produced by arational Demiurge, admittedly under the constraints of Necessity, there isno room for an additional irrational force. Necessity already accounts forthe irrational substratum that persists in the sublunar realm. The situationbecomes even more confusing in the subsequent passage:λοιπὸν δὴ μετὰ τὴν τύχην ἡ τέχνη.καὶ τίς τέκτων εὔξεται περὶ κάλλουςἀρότρου,τὴντέχνηνἔχων;ἢ τίς ὑφάντης περὶ κάλλους χλανίδος,τὴντέχνην ἔχων;ἢ τίς χαλκεὺς περὶ κάλλους ἀσπίδος,τὴν τέχνην ἔχων;ἢτίςἀριστεὺς περὶ εὐτολμίας,τὴν ἀνδρείαν ἔχων;ἢ τίς ἀγαθὸς περὶ εὐδιαμονίας,τὴν ἀρετὴν ἔχων;And after Fortune, craftsmanship remains and what carpenter, whenhe possesses craftsmanship, prays for a good plough?

What brave man prays forcourage, when he possesses daring? What virtuous man prays for happiness,when he possesses virtue? (5.6.145–50)Trapp states that this passage underlines ‘the proper provinces of humanenterprise and divine assistance’.16What is unclear is how human sciencecan be regarded as a causal factor (in our lives) comparable to the Demiurge,Necessity and Fortune. Perhaps Maximus envisages that in some sensehumanity is capable of becoming a co-producer with the Demiurge ina manner akin to the Christian notion of procreation. However, in theabsence of any detailed comment from Maximus, who breaks his promise,by claiming that it only remains to speak of science and then failing toexpound the topic, it is idle to speculate.Evidently, here Maximus is dealing with two separate problems: thelimitations imposed upon the Demiurge during the actual process of world-generation, and the limitations that emerge in relation to his governance of16Trapp:1997,48"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"128A simplified understanding of God: Maximus of Tyrethe world in order to allow room for human free will. Even though it is clearthat atOration5Maximus intends to deal with the latter problem, once hestarts to investigate the limits imposed on the Demiurge by Necessity, heimmediately opens up the related question of the limits to the Demiurge’spowers during world-generation. Both problems were related by the Stoicsin their theory that humans should become artisans of their lives, and Ithink that this is what Maximus is getting at here.Maximus seems to be aware that all four factors play a role in demiurgiccausality, but he does not appear to have worked out a coherent system andhe avoids elaborating on the manner of their interaction during the processof world-generation.Πρόνοια, often translated as ‘Providence’, is perhapssomething more akin to ‘forethought’, and is possibly intended to play arole similar to῎Εννοιαin Philo’s system; an emanation of the transcendentalGod, which engages in demiurgic activity and helps to insulate Him frommatter. AtOration5, Maximus again points out that apparent evils onlyappear to be so: ‘You may call such breakings-up “destruction” but thetrue doctor knows their cause; he disregards the prayers of the parts andpreserves the universe for his concern is of the whole’ (trans. after Trapp,modified).17Maximus here adopts the Stoic formulation of God’s concernfor the good of the whole. He does acknowledge some theodicy on a moreindividual level (κατὰ μέρος, on the level of particulars). Maximus reiteratesthe points made concerning Socrates’ prayer: ‘...God’sProvidencedoesinfact extend to particulars as well. But prayer is out of place there too, beinglike a patient asking his doctor for food or medicine on his own initiative:if it is efficacious, the doctor will give it unasked; if it is dangerous, he willwithhold it, even when asked.’ It is unclear what restrictions Fortune andNecessity could possibly place upon the Demiurge, since these ‘breakings-up’ are in fact not evil at all and here they are even attributed to hisπρονοία.Oration13:εἰ μαντικῆς οὔσης,ἔστιν τι ἐφ’ἡμῖν, ‘Whether given the real-ity of prophecy, there is free will’, also investigates the nature of causality,demiurgic and otherwise, although Maximus concentrates more on thecompatibility of prophecy with human intelligence, rather than with freewill. This is linked with the ideas expressed inOration5, since here alsoMaximus regards events in the cosmos as caused by (and therefore pre-dictable by) multiple factors. Maximus expresses some rather interestingcomments on the nature of divine intellect:17Oration5.103–9"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Limits imposed upon the Demiurge129τὸ δὲ θεῖον δοκεῖ σοι γινώσκειν πάντα ἑξῆς,καὶ τὰ καλὰ καὶ τὰ αἰσχρά,καὶ τὰ τίμια καὶ τὰ ἄτιμα;φείδομαι τῶν ῥημάτων καὶ αἰδώς με τοῦ θείουἔχει·σεμνὸν γάρ τι τὸ πάντα εἰδέναι,καὶ ἀριθμὸν ψάμμων καὶ θαλάττηςμέτρα,καὶ ξυνιέναι ἀτόπου λέβητος ἑψομένου ἐν Λυδοῖς·Does it seem to you that the divine knows everything in order, both thebeautiful and the ugly, both the honourable and the shameful? I am sparingof words and have awe of the divine. It is venerable to know everything,both the number of the sands and the measure of the sea and to be aware ofa strange cauldron boiling in Lydia. (13.3.43–7)Evidently, Maximus is being rather sarcastic here. I think that what under-lines this statement is the Stoicised notion that God or Providence focuseson the entire cosmos, only considering smaller parts insofar as they con-tribute to the whole. Yet here, Maximus appears to contradict his owncomments atOration11that the divine intellect thinks all things simul-taneously and eternally. It is, however, in keeping with his conception ofthe demiurgicνεῦμαas responsible for world-generation. If the Demiurgeactively generated or ordered, he should have some idea of the number ofgrains of sand. It is as if by giving hisνεῦμα, he stands back and allowsmatter to order itself, rather than adopting a more active role. However,this stance allows Maximus to preserve the transcendent nature of thedeity, highlighting God’s separation from the world. God is not ‘a terriblymeddlesome busybody’.18He cares for the world as a whole, rather thanbeing excessively concerned with its parts.There then follows a description of demiurgic causality, which is effec-tively a summary of theTimaeus. God’s craftsmanship is to cause harmonyto spread from himself through the cosmos, like the harmony of a musicalactivity. Maximus compares his activity to that of the leader of a choirbringing an end to the discord that exists amongst the choristers.19Theharmony mentioned alludes to the harmonic ratios according to which thesoul is divided in theTimaeus. The notion of a direct descent of the divineis to be found atDe Mund.399b15and400b8, although Maximus developsit in a Platonic direction by hinting at world-generation through ordering.Maximus then provides a more explicit statement concerning themechanics of divine causality:τίς δὲ ὁ τρόπος τῆς θείας τέχνης,ὀνόματι μὲν εἰπεῖν οὐκ ἔχω,εἴσῃ δὲαὐτῆς τὴν δύναμιν ἐξ εἰκόνος†ἣ οἵα δήποτε†ἐθεάσω νεῶν ἐρύσεις ἐκθαλάττης ἄνω καὶ λίθων ἀγωγὰς ὑπερφυῶν κατὰ μέγεθος παντοδαποῖςἑλιγμοῖς καὶ ἀναστροφαῖς ὀργάνων·ὧν ἕκαστον πρὸς τὸ πλησίον τὴν18Oration13.3.50–3; trans.

Each part dispensesforce to the next and one part receives the impetus from another and thewhole (machine) moves. The whole has responsibility for the task, but theindividual parts partake in it. (13.4.71–9)Finally, it appears that Maximus is ready to explain the manner in whichthe Demiurge collaborates with Necessity and Fortune in the generation ofthe cosmos. These separate elements are co-responsible with the Demiurgefor the generation of the sublunar realm. This image is similar to that ofDe Mund.398b11–17, but here Maximus is straying away from the questionthat he had previously set out to discuss, exploring how the Demiurgecauses events, rather than the manner in which God foresees them. Unfor-tunately, as is so frequently the case with Maximus, he appears to be on thepoint of providing a detailed account of demiurgic causality, before dealingwith the matter in a superficial manner. The Demiurge is merely a part ofthe machine involved in world-generation. The image of the machine issimilar to Aristotle’s view of causality in terms of contact between bodies;the efficient cause has to touch bodies lower down the chain in order tooperate on them. This is what is going on here, although Maximus neverelaborates on the sort of twistings or rotations that he imagines to benecessary for a component to transmit its impetus to the next.A more detailed account of how the Demiurge interacts with Fate thenfollows:κάλει τοίνυν τεχνίτην μὲν τὸν θεόν,ὄργανα δὲ τοὺς λογισμοὺς τοὺς ἀνθρ-ωπίνους,τέχνην δὲ τὴν μαντικὴν σπῶσαν ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ τὴν ἀγωγὴν τῆς εἱμαρ-μένης.εἰ δέ σοι καὶ σαφεστέρας εἰκόνος δεῖ,νόει μοι στρατηγὸν μὲν τὸνθεόν,στρατείαν δὲ τὴν ζωήν,ὁπλίτην δὲ τὸν ἄνθρωπον,σύνθημα δὲ τὴνεἱμαρμένην,ὅπλα δὲ τὰς εὐπορίας,πολεμίους δὲ τὰς συμφοράς,σύμμαχονδὲ τὸν λογισμόν ἀριστείαν δὲ τὴν ἀρετήν,ἧτταν δὲ τὴν μοχθηρίαν,μαν-τικὴν δὲ τὴν τέχνην αὐτὴν τὴν ἐκ τῆς παρασκευῆς ἐπισταμένην τὸ μέλλον.καὶ γὰρ κυβερνήτης ναῦν ἔχων καὶ εἰδὼς τὰ ὄργανα καὶ τὴν θάλαττανὁρῶν καὶ αἰσθανόμενος τῶν πνευμάτων,οἶδεν τὸ ἀποβησόμενον·Call the craftsman God, and the machinery human reasoning, and crafts-manship the prophetic art which draws us towards the necessity of Destiny."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Limits imposed upon the Demiurge131And if a clearer image is necessary for you, envisage God as the general, life asan expedition, man as a hoplite, Destiny as the cipher, supplies as weapons,Reason as an ally, virtue as the prize of valour, depravity as a defeat and theprophetic art as that which can predict future events from armaments. Fora helmsman too, in command of his ship and familiar with his equipmentand with an eye on the sea, and observing the winds, knows what willhappen. (13.4.79–90)The Demiurge is also compared to a doctor, who, relying on his art, canforesee the probable result of an illness. Here again, Necessity or Fate isportrayed as an external factor, which is not subject to the authority of theDemiurge, but his knowledge of the art of demiurgy allows him to predictthe probable result of the dictates of Necessity. Maximus then moves awayfrom the topic of demiurgic causality to consider whether there is any placefor human free will or autonomy, concluding that it is inextricably boundup with Necessity/Fate (§4), but the regular operations of Fate make itpredictable, even by human intellect (§5).The wording here is particularly ambivalent. Maximus tries to demon-strate that human free will is ultimately autonomous, but expresses himselfin such a way as to make it appear that it is actually one aspect of anoverarching ‘Stoic’ Fate; although Maximus exhibits a classic Middle Pla-tonist difficulty in trying to combine universal divine control with humanautonomy; exhibited also atDidasc.26andDe Fato569ff.,whereuseismade of a comparison between Fate and law.20Alcinous’ theory, whichseems to be the basic Platonic one during this period, is as follows:(1) All things are within the sphere of Fate, but not all things are fated.(2) Fate has the status of a law, but it does not make specific statements,since that would result in an infinity of possibilities.(3) If all things are fated, the concept of what is in our power (τὸ ἐφ’ἡμῖν)would disappear.(4) The soul is autonomous; it is not compelled to act, but once it makes aspecific choice, a particular chain of causality results, which is fulfilledaccording to Fate.

(This is illustrated by the example which he provides of Laius:it was fated that Laius would be killed by his son, although Laius couldalways have abstained from sexual activity. Once he sired Oedipus, thecausal chain which resulted in his death commenced. The Laius/Oedipusexample was a popular one in Middle Platonist discussions of Fate). How-ever, another Middle Platonist, Apuleius of Madaura, attempted to workout more specifically the interaction between Fate and the actions of theDemiurge, with a triadic division of Providence (which recalls the threespheres administered by the Moirai in pseudo-Plutarch). AtDe Plat.1.12,he distinguishes between a primary providence – that of the supremegod (Demiurge), a secondary providence entrusted to secondary gods (theYoung Gods of theTimaeus) and a tertiary providence, (although he doesnot refer to it as such), which is administered by thedaimones.21A similarsystem can be found inDe Fato572f., Calcidius (ch.155) and Nemesius(ch.34p.287Matthaei).22In general, these theories seem to be part of a Middle Platonist attempt towork out how demiurgic Providence can enclose Fate which then enclosesFree Will and to place all elements in a coherent system. The comparisonwith other Middle Platonists is instructive, since it illustrates the lack ofrefinements and subtleties inherent in Maximus’ account, where very littleattempt is made to define the four elements of causality, which he identifies,in anything approaching a coherent system.Maximus then quotes Plato’sLaws709b–c to summarise the Platonicview concerning the manner in which Fate, Science, Chance and theDemiurge all contribute to causality:...ὡς θεὸς μὲν πάντα,καὶ μετὰ θεοῦ τύχη καὶ καιρὸς τὰ ἀνθρώπινακυβερνῶσιν τὰ ξύμπαντα·ἡμερώτερόν γε μὴν τρίτον ἐπὶ τούτοις προσ-θεῖναι δεῖν ἕπεσθαι τὴν τέχνην.καιρῷ γὰρ χειμῶνος συλλαβέσθαι κυβερν-ητικὴν ἢ μή,μέγα πλεονέκτημα ἔγωγ’ἂν θείην....so God directs all human affairs and Fortune and opportunity alongwith God. More benignly it is necessary for a third factor to follow these,craftsmanship. For during a storm, the helmsman might seize a favourableopportunity or not, but it would be advantageous, I would say, if he didso. (13.7.151–5)From the echo of this text at Plut.,Quaest. Conv.740c, it seems to havebeen used as a proof text in Middle Platonist discussions of the topic.23The oration closes with a Stoicising comment that humanity confronted21Dillon:1977,32522Dillon:1977,32323Tr a p p :1997,122"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Limits imposed upon the Demiurge133by Necessity has the autonomy of a man in chains who follows his captorsof his own free will (a variant of Zeno’s example of a small dog tied toa cart) and an assertion that nothing that is evil can be the work of theDemiurge.24An alternative explanation of the functioning of demiurgic causalitycan be found inOration4:τίνες ἄμεινον περὶ θεῶν διέλαβον· ποιηταὶἢ φιλόσοφοι; ‘Who produced the better account of the gods, poets orphilosophers?’. In the course of the sermon, Maximus makes allusion tothe work of the Presocratic, Pherecydes of Syros, entitled, according to theSuda,ἑπτάμυχος ἤτοι θεοκρασία ἤ θεογονία(The Seven Sanctuaries orDivine Mingling or Genealogy of the Gods). This work begins with thelinesΖὰς μὲν καὶ Χρόνος ἦσαν ἀεὶ καὶ Χθονίη.Χθονίῃ δὲ ὄνομα ἐγενέτο Γῆ,ἐπειδὴ αὐτῇ Ζᾶς γῆν γέρας διδοῖ(‘There was always Zeus and Chronosand Chthonie. And the name earth was given to Chthonie since Zeus,on the occasion of his marriage with Chthonie, offered her the earth as apresent’).25Fr.7B3elaborates: Zeus ‘μέλλοντα δημιουργεῖν’ (Zeus ‘being about toorder the world’), transformed himself into Eros andτὸν κόσμον ἐκ τῶνἐναντίων συνιστὰς εἰς όμολογίαν καὶ φιλίαν ἤγαγε(‘bringing togetherthe cosmos out of opposites he led it to order and attraction’). Chronosproduces the various elements, but Zeus, having transformed himself intoEros (the principle of harmony) orders in this manner the unified world.Zeus is clearly similar to the Platonic Demiurge, ordering pre-existentand recalcitrant matter. Chronos, I think, is not pre-cosmic chaos, butrather something akin to the winnowing motion of theTimaeus, which isresponsible for the initial creative impulse.Further light is shed on this matter by Proclus’Commentaryon the Timaeus(ii.54Diehl):τὴν γὰρ ̓Αφροδίτην παρήγαγεν ὁδημιουργός...῎Εχει δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν ἑαυτῷ τὴν τοῦ ῎Ερωτος αἰτίαν,‘Forthe Demiurge leads Aphrodite along . . . And he contains within himselfthe cause of Eros’. The Demiurge harmonises the cosmos through theintroduction of the Principle of Love and attraction. Maximus’ allusionto this seems to have largely gone unnoticed by commentators, with theexception of Puiggali:ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦ Συρίου τὴν ποίησιν σκόπει,τὸν Ζῆνα καὶ τὴν Χθονίην καὶτὸν ἐν τούτοις ἔρωτα καὶ τὴν ̓Οφιονέως γένεσιν καὶ τὴν θεῶν μάχην καὶ τὸ24This reminds us of the strong interaction between Stoicism and Platonism in the second centuryad.25Fr.7B1–Vorsokr.Diels-Kranz"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"134A simplified understanding of God: Maximus of Tyreδένδρον καὶ τὸν πέπλον·σκόπει καὶ τὸ ̔Ηρακλείτου,θεοὶ θνητοί,ἄνθρωποιἀθάνατοι.But examine the poetry of the man from Syros and his Zeus and Chthonieand their love and the birth of Ophioneus and the battle of the gods andthe tree and the dress; and examine this remark of Heraclitus ‘mortal gods,immortal men’.

W ̈ust’s opinion was that Maximus confounds the two,27whilePuiggali feels that Maximus only refers to Ophion (1). If Ophion (1)isreferred to, Maximus is alluding to an additional ordering principle (theadversary of Chronos) or if (2) is referred to, he is alluding to Necessityor an evil World-Soul, a disordered principle, which is in conflict with theDemiurge.Theπέπλος(robe) is theφάρος(dowry) which Zeus offers Chthonieas a wedding present:τότε Ζὰς ποιεῖ φάρος μέγα τε καὶ καλὸν καὶ ἐναὐτῷ ποικίλλει τὴν καὶ ῎\u0002γηνου δώματα(‘Then Zeus made a great andbeautiful dowry and enrobed in itself the house of Ogenos’, Fr.

Diels explains the allusion to the tree by refer-ring to Anaximander’s representation of the earth. Anaximander comparedthe earth to the trunk of a tree and the sky which surrounds it to bark.28The garment which Zeus offers Chthonie must therefore be the surfaceof the earth. Taken together, then, the Demiurge offers Chthonie (thegenerative female principle) the earth at the moment of world-generation,when both engage in the demiurgic act by simultaneously transformingthemselves into the principle of harmony.Here we have an allegory of demiurgic causality far removed from Max-imus’ usual superficial treatment of this (and practically every other) matter.26Puiggali:198127W ̈ust:1939a,1939band1939c28Puiggali:1983,79"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Unity of the divine135In the passage immediately following, Maximus expresses his approval ofthe use of myth to expound philosophical truth (although as a sophist hedoes not really have views on such matters and just presents variations onatheme):πάντα μεστὰ αἰνιγμάτων καὶ παρὰ ποιηταῖς καὶ παρὰ φιλοσόφοις,ὧνἐγὼ τὴν πρὸς τὸ ἀληθὲς αἰδῶ ἀγαπῶ μᾶλλον ἢ τὴν παρρησίαν τῶννεωτέρων·πραγμάτων γὰρ ὑπ’ἀνθρωπίνης ἀσθενείας οὐ καθορωμένωνσαφῶς εὐσχημονέστερος ἑρμηνεὺς ὁ μῦθος...τί γὰρ ἂν ἄλλο εἴη μύθουχρεία<ἢ>λόγος περισκεπὴς ἑτέρῳ κόσμῳ,καθάπερ τὰ ἱδρύματα οἷςπεριέβαλλον οἱ τελεσταὶ χρυσὸν καὶ ἄργυρον καὶ πέπλους,{τὰ}ἀποσεμ-νύνοντες αὐτῶν τὴν προσδοκίαν;Among poets and philosophers allegory is common, so that I have greateradmiration for these writers’ love of the truth, more than the outspokennessof the younger writers.

There Maximus claimsthat the gods share customs, life and character. All rule, all are of the sameage and are the saviours of mankind. They only have one nature, althoughthey have many names and it is through ignorance that the gifts which theybestow collectively are attributed to individual divine names. This conceptof the unity of the divine is essentially Stoic, rather than Platonic, althoughMaximus tends to develop it in a Platonising direction.30For example inOration4, Maximus refers to Zeus as ‘the supreme andvenerable Mind’ (νοῦν πρεσβύτατον καὶ ἀρχικώτατον), Athena as Intel-ligence (φρόνησις) and Poseidon as the cosmic breath (πνεῦμα) pervadingland and sea.31Maximus portrays the traditional Olympian pantheon asmerely aspects and extensions of the Demiurge and his activity. All thingsfollow and obey Zeus; this seems to place the Demiurge above the dictatesof Necessity. Maximus has located him in the suprasensible realm, provid-ing contact with the sublunar realm by means of theπνεῦμαrepresentedby Poseidon. This is an interesting development, as in Stoic accounts,Poseidon pervades the seas, not both land and sea as here.32For Maximus,πνεῦμαhas become an immanent World-Soul, the coun-terpart of the PhilonicLogos, allowing the Demiurge to interact with thesensible realm. Maximus further elaborates on the Demiurge’s interactionwith the cosmos inOrations8and9–τί τὸ δαιμόνιον Σωκράτους, ‘Whatwas Socrates’ divine sign?’, which points out thatdaimonesare necessaryin the hierarchy of entities in order to prevent the cosmos splitting in twobetween the suprasensible and sublunar realms.

AtOration8.8.186–9,thedaimonesplay a role in demiurgy as a result of the harmonising effectwhich they have on the cosmos as a whole.InOration9, Maximus goes on to argue that the existence ofdaimonesis necessary in providing a link between the Demiurge and man, due to thedependence of continuity upon shared terms, a concept owing its originto Arist.,Met.10.1069a5ff., but first applied to the intermediate status ofdaimonesby Xenocrates.Interestingly, unlike Plutarch, Maximus never uses his daimonology asa mechanism for resolving the problem of evil. For him, thedaimonesarethe assistants of the Demiurge in the act of world-generation and in theadministration of the cosmos. Even in their terrifying aspect (8.8.207), theyare beneficial, since they punish the wicked, although Maximus merely saysὁ μὲν φοβερόςand does not elaborate on this point. However, Maximusprobably avoids makingdaimonesresponsible for the existence of evil, notjust because such a notion was unpalatable to him, but because he had noneed for such an explanation, as he attempts to regulate the problem bymeans of the Stoic formulation that evils only appear to be such, but infact occur for the good of the whole.ConclusionMaximus never really elaborates on the causality of the Demiurge – forhim the world is created merely by theνεῦμαof Zeus. Yet in spite ofthis, his orations are rich in imagery and insights on this topic, whichdue to his lack of originality reveal the preoccupations of Middle Platonistspeculations concerning world-generation.

Nume-nius forms a bridge between Philo and the Gnostic and Hermetic tradi-tions, as well as ranking as an important predecessor of Plotinus, to suchan extent that the latter philosopher was actually accused of plagiarisinghim. Numenius composed a treatiseOn the Unfaithfulness of the Academyto Platoand oneOn The Goodin (at least) six books. Many of the fragmentshave been gleaned from Eusebius’Praeparatio Evangelica, with some sup-plementary material from Calcidius’Commentary on the Timaeus,Origenand certain Neoplatonic sources. There is a great difference in the qualityof the fragments which we possess from Eusebius (actual quotations) andthose obtained from other sources (Numenian texts altered by the writer)and one of the drawbacks of Des Places’1973edition is that it tends to treatboth sets of fragments with an unjustified level of equality.1My practicehere has been to use the actual fragments, taken from Eusebius, to build upmy case for each sub-topic and then to turn to thetestimonia, using themfor evidence that might help to confirm or deny my theses, but not givingthem excessive weight and also noting very clearly the original source-text.This discrepancy in the quality of fragments is not the only reason whythe study of Numenius is problematic. Another is the unjustified prejudicewith which he has been viewed on account of his syncretistic tendencies.This is exemplified by Dodds: ‘The main fabric of Numenius’ thought is nodoubt derived from Neopythagorean tradition . . . But because he was, asMacrobius says,occultiorum curiosior(F39), he welcomed the superstitionsof his time, whatever their origin and thereby contributed to the eventual1Despite this criticism, I am indebted to him for his edition and have found his French translationinvaluable in preparing my own English version.139"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"140Numenius and his doctrine of three godsdegradation of Greek philosophical thought.’2A more accurate observa-tion (on account of its greater balance) is that of Dillon, which illustratesan alternative approach to the fragments: ‘In Numenius, we have a fasci-nating figure about whom we know all too little but who plainly combinesin his doctrine various strands; Platonic and Neopythagorean, Hermeticand Gnostic, Zoroastrian and Jewish. In his person, the “underworld” ofPlatonic-influenced theorizing . . . attains some modicum of philosophicalrespectability.’3In the ancient philosophical tradition, there was tension between thePlatonic–Pythagorean perception of the First Principle as Unity (theOne/Monad) and the Anaxagorean/Aristotelian view of it as an intellectwhich thought itself. While both perceptions are not actually mutuallyincompatible, a tension between these opposing views can be observed inMiddle Platonism,4exemplified by the views of Numenius (and indeedin his subsequent influence upon Plotinus). While the Platonic supremeprinciple is the Good ofRepublicvi–vii, it is less clear how this principle isactually responsible for demiurgic causality. While some Platonic philoso-phers stripped away the mythology of the Timaean Demiurge, equatinghim to the StoicLogos, Numenius adopted the alternative approach ofpositing the Demiurge as a second intermediate god between the SupremePrinciple and the World-Soul, who creates the sublunar world from pre-existent Matter.5Numenius, in many ways, appears as an important precursor of Gnos-ticism (although it is difficult to prove conclusively in which direction theinfluence was travelling), with his sharp distinction between three divineentities, and explicitly according the Demiurge only second rank. To thisextent, he can be regarded as intermediate between theTimaeusand Gnos-ticism: for him, the Demiurge is clearly less than entirely good. The FirstGod remains relatively inert and transcendent. The continuity of the onto-logical descent posited by Numenius is stressed through the familial lineageof Grandfather, Father and Grandson, as well as the assertion of the same-ness of the Second and Third Gods. Numenius prefigures the ignorantDemiurge of Gnosticism by stressing his divisibility and negligence of theupper-tending part of his own nature. In this sense too, he is part of theintellectual current which led to the supposition of decreased unity (andtherefore less perfect entities) as one descends the ontological scale.A further point of interest is the role of the Third God, who takes onthe functions of the World-Soul, an entity without a very great level of2Dodds:1960,113Dillon:1977,3794Dillon:1992b,1925Dillon:1992b,195"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The First Principle141activity in the Numenian system. Numenius also details very clearly themechanics of the interaction between the First Principle and the Demiurge.As a result of the cooperation he posits between both entities, he is, inthis regard, more reminiscent of Judaeo–Christian thinkers, such as Philoand Origen. However, while they both regard God as a Demiurge byextension, Numenius stresses that the First God should not be regardedas a Demiurge, though he does appear to be a conduit, ensuring that theForms are communicated to the Demiurge. As a result of the cooperationbetween both entities he is an interesting pagan comparison to the modelof world-generation assumed in the Judaeo–Christian tradition.Numenius also represents an important attempt to reconcile two aspectsof the divine: the immanent and the transcendent. While the First Godcontemplates the Intelligibles, there is no suggestion (in the extant frag-ments) that they are actually his thoughts. The Second God is not to becompletely identified with demiurgic activity, as he also has a separate‘inner life’ comprising contemplation of the Forms; in this sense he couldbe said to ‘retire’, like his counterpart in theTimaeus. While Numeniusfollows theTimaeusquite closely in certain respects, explaining demiurgyin terms of Intellect’s attempt to smooth out the recalcitrance of matter,he extends the concept, examining the origin of the Demiurge himself. Allthis renders all the more regrettable the fragmentary remains of his work,as he played a central role in the demiurgic debate.The First PrincipleBeing (τὸ ὄν) resembles Plato’s realm of the same name. It is perfectlystable.6It never existed (οὔτε ποτὲ ἤν), it never has the chance to be (οὔτεποτὲ μὴ γένηται), but it is constantly in a fixed time (in) the presentonly (ἀλλ’ἔστιν ἀεὶ ἐν χρόνῳ ὁρισμένῳ τῷ ἐνεστῶτι μόνῳ). It is eternal(ἀΐδίον), constantly stable (βέβαιόν), immutable and identical (τέ ἐστιν ἀεὶκατὰ ταὐτὸν καὶ ταὐτόν). It does not increase or decrease and it does notmove (οὐδὲ γὰρ θέμις αὐτῷ κινηθῆναι).This is a fairly standard Platonic division between the realms of Beingand Becoming. The lack of motion of Being evokes Plato’s description ofthe motion of the cosmos in theTimaeus. Numenius even goes one stepfurther. He not only denies Being all irrational movement, but also theonly rational movement: rotation around a fixed point. It seems evidenthere that Being is not actually described in terms appropriate to a realm;6Fr.5(14L.)=Eus.,Praep.

I would contend that Being is, in fact,equivalent to the Numenian First God, as is indicated at Fr.17.7This is notindisputable, however, as Numenius struggles with the idea that his FirstGod is beyond Being: ‘it rides upon Being’ (Fr.2) and Numenius is almostforced into this position because of his Second God being equated withtrue Being and Intellect.8However, he never breaks with the traditionalGreek philosophical identification of God with Being and Intellect.9Thisis in spite of the postulation of his Pythagorean predecessor, Moderatus ofGades, of a ‘One above Being and all essence’.10In Fragment11(20L.=Eus.,Praep. Ev.xi.17,11–18,5), the investigationof divinity is formally introduced. Numenius opens his account of divinitywith a prayer to the God, just like Timaeus, before investigating the natureof the relationship between the First and Second Gods. From this fragment,it would seem that he was rather more interested in demiurgic causalitythan in the nature of his First Principle, which he glosses over very rapidly.The First God here seems rather inert; since he is alive he must have motionof some sort, but Numenius seems to be caught in a bind, since to attributemotion to him would be to deny his stability.Fr.8(17L.=Eus.,Praep. Ev.xi.10,12–14) elaborates further:εἰ μὲν δὴ τὸ ὂν πάντως πάντῃ ἀΐδιόν τέ ἐστι καὶ ἄτρεπτον καὶ οὐδαμῶςοὐδαμῇ ἐξιστάμενον ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ,μένει δὲ κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ καὶ ὡσαύτως ἕστηκε,τοῦτο δήπου ἂν εἴη τὸ τῇ‘νοήσει μετὰ λόγου περιληπτόν’.Εἰ δὲ τὸ σῶμαῥεῖ καὶ φέρεται ὑπὸ τῆς εὐθὺ μεταβολῆς,ἀποδιδράσκει καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν.῞Οθενοὐ πολλὴ μανία μὴ οὐ τοῦτο εἶναι ἀόριστον,δόξῃ δὲ μόνῃ δοξαστὸν καί,ὥς φησι Πλάτων,‘γιγνόμενον καὶ ἀπολλύμενον,ὄντως δὲ οὐδέποτε ὄν’;If then Being is absolutely and everywhere eternal, immutable, if in nomanner and in no place it does not issue forth from itself, but stays withinthe same parameters and maintains itself completely stable, then it is withoutdoubt what is graspable by intellection with the help of reason. And if body isfluid, if it is removed by an immediate change, it runs away and has no stableexistence. In consequence, is it not great folly not to call it indeterminate, theobject of opinion only, and which, as Plato says, ‘comes to be and perishes,but never really exists’?Again, Numenius stresses the stability of Being. It cannot issue forth fromitself, which underlines the (limited) role which it is capable of playing in7...πρῶτον νοῦν,ὅστις καλεῖται αὐτοόν. . . , ‘the First Intellect which bears the name of Being initself’, see discussion below.8For a detailed treatment of these matters, see Dillon:2007,397ff.9Dillon:2007,398, cites several examples where he comes close to doing this.10Dillon:2007,398"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The First Principle143world-generation; it requires another conduit by which it can inform thesensible world, since it is confined to certain defined parameters. Being ischaracterised by eternal identity in essence (ἀεὶ κατὰ ταὐτὸν).11Numenius’First God resembles the Pythagorean Monad, which in multiplicationcannot bring about self-change or alter another number. This situationcreates a need for the Second God who can actually engage in the motioninvolved in world-generation.This Second God is not in any way evil, but as he does not possess theunity of the First (since he is divisible, though this is a once-off occurence)it is true to say that he is less good. As Plotinus points out, the ontologicallyprior entity must be superior: ‘For being perfect it was necessary for it togenerate, and not be without a product since it was such a great power.But what it produced could not be better than it (this is not the case hereeither), but it was necessary for it to be a lesser image, and in a like manner,indefinite, but defined by what generated it and provided with a form, asit were.’12Admittedly, this text comes from Plotinus, but since it outlines hisresponse to a problem similar to that which confronted Numenius, it isvalid to cite it here. However, Plotinus’ One is not Intellect and does notintentionally generate anything: the question here is whether this is trueof Numenius’ First God. I think not. Since Numenius’ First Principlehas a kind of demiurgic role, in terms of the production of soul, it isnot equivalent to Plotinus’ One. Since it continually contemplates theIntelligibles, then it can also be regarded as Intellect. Though Plotinus’ Oneengages in this activity, it can best be regarded as a sort of super-Intellect orbeyond Intellect, while for Numenius it is not actually clear whether it canbe considered in the same way. However, since the Numenian Demiurgecan be regarded also as an Intellect, to which the First God transmitsaspects of the Forms which it contemplates, it must contain an intellectiveelement.It is clear that as a dualist, Numenius did not regard the First God asresponsible for the production of matter. It must always have been thereas part of a duality of causes. One can compare the explanation of Proclusregarding the relationship between Monad and Dyad: ‘for the One precedesall opposition, as the Pythagoreans say. But when the second cause appears(ἡ δυὰς τῶν ἀρχῶν ἀνεφάνη), after the first cause, among these too theMonad is superior to the Dyad.’13Numenius attributes the same doctrine11O’Meara:1976,120–912Plotinus,Enn.v1[10]7.37–42.

However,the Second and Third Gods are in fact one, but coming into contact withmatter, which is the Dyad, even though he unifies it, he is divided by it,having a character that is without concupiscence and that is fluid. Not beingattached to the intelligible (for in this case he would be concentrated uponhimself ), because he is looking at matter he is preoccupied with it and heis forgetful of himself; he enters into contact with the sensible and raises itup to his own proper character, because he has directed his desire towardsmatter.Here it seems that the Demiurge is turned in two directions during theact of world-generation, contemplating the Forms, while he transmitsthe Intelligibles to the sensible realm. Part of the problem is why exactlythe Demiurge should be split in two by the Dyad. I do not think it is thecase that the upper-tending part of the divinity returns to contemplatethe Forms, while the lower part engages in the production and continualgeneration of the sensible world. It is possible that the Third God is merely14‘Sed non nullos Pythagoreos vim sententiae non recte adsecutos putasse dici etiam indeterminatumet immensam divinitatem ad unica singularitate institutam, recedente a natura sua singularitateet in divinitatis habitum migrante’, ‘But some Pythagoreans, who have not correctly understoodthis theory, thought that this indeterminate and unlimited Dyad was also produced by this singleMonad, when this Monad withdraws from its nature and adopts the aspect of a Dyad.’ Calcidius,In Timaeum,295Wa s z i n k .15Rist:1965,337"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Demiurge’s relationship with the First God145a lower aspect of the Second. Clearly the Demiurge creates as the resultof an act of lust ororexis, which is not particularly praiseworthy, since itprevents him from contemplating the Intelligibles and even leads him tobecome forgetful of his own nature. This guilty element could be regardedas being expelled from the Second God, in the same manner that a lowerSophia is expelled from the Pleroma in the Gnostic systems.However, I do not feel that it is necessary to posit a lower aspect ofthe Second God. Theorexisof the Demiurge can be viewed in a morefavourable light, as part of a natural desire to produce, observable alsoin Plotinus’ One, and which is presumably the reason why the First Godproduced the Second God (if that is in fact what he did). It is quite possiblethat the First God merely split a pre-existent entity into the Second andThird Gods, who then share the functions of the Demiurge. However,this would make it difficult to explain the terminology of Grandfather,Son and Grandson, relayed by Proclus, and would also deny the evidenceof Fr.12(which is reliable, since it comes from Eusebius). The SecondGod can only produce something less perfect than himself (since to repli-cate himself would be to accomplish nothing), and so he produces theWorld-Soul which is less perfect, since it is further removed from the FirstGod, although the World-Soul is an entity downplayed by Numenius. Inthe act of world-generation, the Demiurge is forced to give somethingof himself to matter in order to regulate it and to produce the sensibleworld.This giving of himself to produce the World-Soul is the Demiurge’smechanism for generating the phenomenal realm. I think that this is themeaning of the expression that the Demiurge raises matter to his owncharacter, but because he has to provide his substance to generate, hebecomes divided by matter. It would also neatly explain why the Second andThird Gods are in fact one, since they share the same substance. The ThirdGod, as World-Soul, has actually become enmattered, and is in a sense,dragged down by matter, which prevents him from fully contemplatingthe Intelligibles, while after the process of world-generation, presumablythe Demiurge is capable of doing this.The Second and Third Gods must then be substantially the same, whilethe First God is of a different substance (because he does not know how tobe divisible, for if he was, it would compromise his unity, a necessary traitin the Numenian First Principle).This elucidates why Numenius posited agod whose soleraison d’ˆetreis to produce another Demiurge.

And so while the God watches and is oriented towards each of us, thebodies participate in life and are animated by the radiations of the God towhich they unite, but if the God returns to his own contemplation, theseare extinguished, while Mind partakes of a happy existence.I think that these radiations by which the Second God animates are com-parable to the manner in which he is said to be split by matter.Fr.13(22L.=Eus.,Praep. Ev.xi.18.13–14), though short, outlines a viewof demiurgic causality which has been the source of much difficulty:῎\u0002σπερ δὲ πάλιν λόγος ἐστὶ γεωργῷ πρὸς τὸν φυτεύοντα,ἀνὰ τὸν αὐτὸνλόγον μάλιστά ἐστιν ὁ πρῶτος θεὸς πρὸς τὸν δημιουργόν. ̔Ο μέν γε ὢνσπέρμα πάσης ψυχῆς σπείρει εἰς τὰ μεταλαγχάνοντα αὐτοῦ χρήματασύμπαντα·ὁ νομοθέτης δὲ φυτεύει καὶ διανέμει καὶ μεταφυτεύει εἰς ἡμᾶςἑκάστους τὰ ἐκεῖθεν προκαταβεβλημένα.And even as is the relation between the farmer and the planter; such is thatwhich relates the First God to the Demiurge.The one who is sows the seeds ofevery soulinto the things which partake of it, while the Lawgiver plants anddistributes and transplants what has been sown from that source into eachone of us.16This notion of sowing again evokes theTimaeus. Much speculation hasbeen expended on the precise use of the wordγεωργός, who is generally feltto be the proprietor of a garden or or a farmer who directs operations froma distance, while theφυτεύωνis regarded as a labourer who works under16trans.

The phrase ̔Ο μέν γε ὢνis interpreted variouslyas a biblism or Hebraism, which is felt to be out of place in Numenius.Scott reads ̔Ο μέν[γὰρ ἕν]σπέρμα πάσῃς ψυχῆς σπείρει εἰς τὰ μετα-λαγχάνοντα[αὐτῆς]χρήματα σύμπαντα.

For someoneeven without experience might care for the land, but the farmer is not a layperson but one with experience and he is trusted on account of his name,which is derived from the craft of farming, which he is named after.This termγεωργόςis not to be found in theTimaeus(although the imageof cultivation as part of the process of world-generation already existsthere), but it was used to refer to divinities during the imperial age.22Philodraws a distinction between the farmer and the labourer, which results from22In this context, one might cite the cult ofΖεὺς γεωργός. This element can further be traced inpopular Stoicism: ‘Deus ad homines venit immo quod est proprius in homines venit; nulla sinedeo mens bona est. semina in corporibus humanis divina dispersa sunt, quae si bonus cultor excipitsimilia origini prodeant et paria iis, ex quibus orta sunt, surgunt.’ etc. ‘God comes to men, in fact hecomes more closely, he comes into men.

Numeniusobserves this same distinction, but brings it into sharper focus by positingtwo separate Gods. It is probable that Numenius had read Philo, butdifficult to prove. For Andron,ὁὤνor Being is the name of the First God,taken fromExodus3:14, just as the Second God is called the Demiurge.23The supposed Hebraism is not the only difficulty:24the fragment canbe taken to mean that the First God is the seed of all souls, a positionresisted by the majority of interpreters, since the First God is also the onedoing the sowing and ‘a sower does not sow himself ’.25Edwards prefers toread ‘the one who is the seed of all souls sows into those who partake ofit all things together’. There is the question of what ‘all things together’means. Edwards explains this by citing Fr.41(Des Places, preserved inIamblichus’De Anima) where Iamblichus claims that Numenius locatedthe entire intelligible universe (gods,daimonesand the Good) in the soul.26However, this interpretation is problematic since it leads Edwards to iden-tify Numenius’ First God with the Demiurge and the Second God with theYounger Gods. (From a careful reading of Numenius’ fragments, however,it is clear that the Demiurge can rank no higher than the Second God.)27Furthermore, it seems that Iamblichus’ comment here is really a referencetomonopsychism(individual souls, when removed from the sensible world,share an identity with the World-Soul) rather than a description of howsouls are composed.28The Platonist Alcinous outlined a method of soul construction fromindivisible and divisible substance, allowing the soul to perceive bothof these substances; either on the principle that like is known by like(the Pythagorean position) or that unlike is known by unlike (Heracli-tus’ position). He cites an alternative means of constructing soul.29As aPythagorean, one would expect Numenius to subscribe to the doctrinethat like is known by like. This would suggest that the soul and the FirstGod share some properties. This is suggested by the text following Fr.42(Iamblichus,Περὶ Ψυχῆςap. Stob.,Anth.i.49.67), where there is somesupport for the opinion that the soul is an emanation from the First God:ἕνωσιν μὲν οὖν καὶ ταὐτότητα ἀδιάκριτον τῆς ψυχῆς πρὸς τὰς ἑαυτῆςἀρχὰς πρεσβεύειν φαίνεται Νουμήνιος,σύμφυσιν δὲ καθ’ἑτέραν οὐσίανοἱ πρεσβύτεροι διασῳζουσι.καὶ ἀναλύσει μὲν ἐκεῖνοι,συντάξει δὲ οὕτοιπροσεικάζουσι·καὶ οἳ μὲν ἀδιορίστῳ συναφῇ,οἳ δὲ διωρισμένῂ χρῶνται.23Andron:2001,2024In actual fact, this need only imply familiarity with the Septuagint: Edwards:1989b,47925Scott:1925,vol.ii,79,n.326Edwards:1989b,48127Edwards:1989b,48128Andron:2001,3429Didaskalikosxiv"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"150Numenius and his doctrine of three godsΟἱ μέντοι κρατεῖται ὁ διορισμὸς αὐτῶν ὑπὸ τοῦ κόσμου ἢ κατέχετα ὑπὸτῆς φύσεως,ὥσπερ τινὲς τῶν Πλατωνικῶν ὑπειλήφασιν·ἀνεῖται δὲ πάντῃἀφ’ὅλων,ὥσπερ ἐπὶ τῶν χωριστῶν οὐσιῶν τουτὶ νοοῦμεν.Numenius appears to prefer a unity and undiffentiated sameness of the soulwith its principles, whereas the ancients maintain a natural junction with adifferent substance.

However, their individuation is notgovernedbythecosmosorcontrolledbynature,ashasbeensupposedbysome of the Platonists, but has been completely released from the universe,just as we conceive to be the case with separated substances. (trans. afterFinamore-Dillon ed. §50,p.72–3)Part of the problem with using this fragment is that it may not refer tothe generation of soul, but rather to the rewards given to good souls aftertheir death, since this is the subject-matter of the text preceding, Fr.42.30Furthermore, Fr.42comesfromIamblichusand,assuch,itprovidesusonly with very weak evidence for Numenius’ thought.31Here the Demiurge is regarded as responsible for the construction of soul,which is not necessarily a contradiction of Fr.13; there too the Demiurgedistributes soul, even though he does not actually produce it. Here also, theDemiurge is not said to produce either essence, he merely mixes them like abartender making a cocktail. Numenius then goes on to expound the viewthat even if the Demiurge has to provide some of his own substance to ini-tiate world-generation and even if he is split by matter, he is not weakenedby this process. The divine gift of knowledge differs from material gifts:just like a lamp which lights up a second one without being extinguished,God is not impoverished as a result of this divine benefaction.This image of a lamp transmitting its flame without being diminishedprobably goes back to Posidonius.32The idea that the Demiurge illumi-nates us by the transmission of knowledge is noteworthy. I think that forNumenius it emphasises the notion that the basic principle of cosmic orderis number, which is transmitted by the self-contemplating intellect to theDemiurge. It is possible for humanity to possess the number-principle(possibly soul) in a manner that is identical with the God who suppliedit, because the Numenian Demiurge is only the producer of Becoming,not the producer of true Being. In this way, the difference between theDemiurge and the First God is more than just one of an intellect at restand one in motion. They must be substantially different, since it is not30Finamore and Dillon:2002,§5072–331Finamore and Dillon:2002,§5072–332Witt:1931,200n.8"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Demiurge’s relationship with the First God151possible that the generator of Being can exist in the same sense as generatedBeing. Clearly the Second and Third Gods are in fact one, but soul mustbe of a different order, since it is supposed to come from the First God. Inthis case, the Numenian Demiurge also takes over the role of the YoungGods of theTimaeus. This is hardly surprising and is part of the ten-dency to assign less important activities to the Demiurge, accompanyinghis declining ontological rank.At Fr.15(24L.=Eus.,Praep. Ev.xi.18.20–1) Numenius reiterates theposition of the Second God as the generator of the world of Becoming:εἰσὶ δ’οὗτοι βίοι ὁ μὲν πρώτου,ὁ δὲ δευτέρου θεοῦ.Δηλονότι ὁ μὲνπρῶτος θεὸς ἔσται ἑστώς,ὁ δὲ δεύτερος ἔμπαλίν ἐστι κινούμενος·ὁμὲνοὖν πρῶτος περὶ τὰ νοητά,ὁδὲδεύτεροςπερὶτὰνοητὰκαὶαἰσθητά.Μὴθαυμάσῃς δ’εἰ τοῦτ’ἔφην·πολὺ γὰρ ἔτι θαυμαστότερον ἀκούσῃ. ̓Α ν τ ὶ γ ὰ ρτῆς προσούσης τῷ δευτέρῳ κινήσεως τὴν προσοῦσαν τῷ πρώτῳ στάσινφημὶ εἶναι κίνησιν σύμφυτον,ἀφ’ἧς ἥ τε τάξις τοῦ κόσμου καὶ ἡ μονὴ ἡἀΐδιος καὶ ἡ σωτηρία ἀναχεῖται εἰς τὰ ὅλα.Such are the lives of the First and Second Gods. The First God remains stable,the second remains in motion, while the First God occupies himself withintelligibles, the Second occupies himself with intelligibles and sensibles.And do not be surprised if I have spoken in this manner; because you willhear something that is even more surprising. Corresponding to the inherentmovement of the Second God, I declare that the inherent stability of theFirst God is an innate movement from which proceeds the order of theworld and its eternal stability, and from which salvation spreads out over allbeings.Here the Second God seems to play a role akin to God’sLogosin thePhilonic and Christian traditions, going into those parts of the cosmoswhere it would be beneath God’s dignity to go.It is worth considering this inherent motion at rest of the First God.Since he is a living being, he needs to have a motion of some sort. This isprovided by his contemplation of the Intelligibles. At the same time, theFirst God here appears to play a role in demiurgic causality, beyond merelyspawning the Demiurge. He is responsible for world-order and its stability.Des Places interpreted the situation as follows: the First God appears tocontemplate the Intelligibles with the assistance of the Second, so thatthe Second God also corresponds to intellect and states that the Secondproduces in his turn using the Third God, so that the Third God alsocorresponds to an intellect which uses discursive intelligence.33Ithinkit33Des Places:1973,109"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"152Numenius and his doctrine of three godsis justifiable to cast an eye on Plotinus at this point; the Neoplatonist washeavily influenced by Numenius and there are certain issues concerningNumenius that he can help to illuminate. As Dillon points out, the Platonistconcept of ‘the First God as intellect was under strain when Plotinus came toexamine it’.34The First God is required to think himself. As Plotinus remarks duringthe latter part ofEnn.v3[49]10–17, self-intellection requires duality;a subjective, thinking element and an objective, thought element, whichcomprises the unity and simplicity of the Monad. This difficulty is illus-trated by Nicomachus’ highly-strained definition of the First Principle asνοῦς τε εἴη,εἶτα καὶ ἀρσενόθηλυς καὶ θεὸς καὶ ὕλη δέ πως, ‘therefore aMind and Androgyne and god and somehow matter’.35Numenius’ FirstGod is clearly an intellect, although one can see here the beginning ofa move to regard intellection as the domain of the second principle; theDemiurge is specifically identified by Numenius as an intellect. The influ-ence of this can be seen in Plotinus, as he claims that the One is superior toIntellect.The nature of the ‘inner life’ of the First God is of vital importance forunderstanding demiurgic causality. Since he is the ultimate source of life,he cannot be regarded as inert (a problem faced also by Plotinus) and Ithink that Numenius is attempting to deal with this by postulating somekind of motion, (here intellectual motion). The exact nature of the FirstGod also has important implications: if his nature transcends that of theDemiurge to such an extent, how exactly does the Second God interactwith him?In Fr.15, the First God seems akin to the Demiurge of theTimaeusinpermitting the Young Gods to exist forever; the stability of the Demiurge’sproduction is guaranteed by the First God and not by the Demiurge him-self. At this point, another passage of Plotinus might prove enlightening:The noetic object (contemplated by Mind) remains by itself and it is notdeficient, just like what it sees and thinks – for I say that what thinks isdeficient in comparison to the Intelligible – but it is not without sense; buteverything belongs to it and is in it and with it. It is able to distinguish itselfin every way (πάντη διακριτικὸν ἑαυτοῦ); there is life in it and everythingis in it and its observation of itself occurs by means of a kind of consciousawareness (οἱονεὶ συναισθήσει) in an everlasting state of rest and accord-ing to a form of noetic activity which differs from the noetic activity ofMind.

He might not be involvedin the practicalities of demiurgy, but he appears to regulate things in thesame manner that the chairman of a board of directors might regulatea multinational. He has some limited role in world-production, since itis from him thatσωτηρίαspreads to all beings, but I am unclear as towhat exactly Numenius means by this (although it is perhaps just a basicpresentation in existence). It is difficult to see how exactly the First Godcan be responsible for universal salvation, even though he seems to generatethe soul-principle, although perhaps this is merely an allusion to the factthat he prevents cosmic collapse. If this inherent stability is really an ‘innatemovement’, perhaps it is even possible to postulate that the First God isinvolved in a sort of continual demiurgy: by constantly remaining stable,he prevents the destruction of the world.At Fr.16(25L.=Eus.,Praep.

Well, ifindeed the Demiurge of Becoming is good, without doubt also the Demiurgeof Being will be the Good itself, as connatural to Being; because the Second,who is double, produces from himself his own idea and the universe, asa Demiurge, after which he devotes himself entirely to contemplation.

The doubleοὐσίαshared by theFirst and Second Gods does not seem to add a new reality to either.36These four seem to be composed of two gods and twoousiai, but it is anodd way of calculating. Kr ̈amer points out that since the Demiurge canbe confounded with the good World-Soul,37the Second and Third Godsonly count as one (Frs.1,4,11), which leaves us with only two divinities:an ultimate reality and a generative entity. However, I feel that all fourentities can best be understood in terms of demiurgic causality: there aretwo causal principles, since, as has been stated before, the First God alsoplays a limited role in world-production and the result is the Third God.It is difficult to explain the third entity – the doubleοὐσία. I thinkthat Numenius wishes to point out that the Second God is in some wayconsubstantial with the First, just as has previously been illustrated, theSecond and Third are substantially the same. This would be necessaryif the Demiurge also has to deal with the Intelligibles. The Demiurge isreferred to as the imitator of the First God; he imitates him, not onlyin his contemplation of the Intelligibles but also in his need to generate.Numenius tries to assign some kind of demiurgic role to the First God,referring to him as ‘the Demiurge of essence’. Numenius here regardsthe Good, not as a Form which contains all the other Forms, but ratherplaying a role similar to that played by the Second God in the realm ofBecoming. The First God is the Demiurge of the realm of Being, althoughit is unclear here whether he is contemplating the Intelligibles or whetherthe Intelligibles only exist because he contemplates them.Des Places’ position was that the First God is all contemplation; andI think that this contemplation must be equivalent to the ‘inner life’ ofthe First God.38Dodds suggests that it is only with the assistance of theSecond God that the first can contemplate (νοεῖν).39I also agree with hiscontention that the Second only generates as a first step, after which hereturns to contemplation, in which he serves as a model for the philosopher(Rep.vi.496d,498b–c,501a–c).

The idea that the Second Godundergoes a conversion seems to imply that world-generation is the resultof some kind of ‘moral fall’, and that the Numenian Demiurge is similar tohis ignorant or fundamentally flawed Gnostic counterpart, which is clearlynot the case here.Numenius boldly attempts to use theTimaeusto justify the existence ofan intellect superior to the Demiurge.42He claims that Plato drafted theTimaeusaccount in the way that he did, because he was aware that onlythe Demiurge was generally known, although he was aware of the existenceof an older and more divine intellect (νοῦς πρεσβύτερος καὶ θειότερος).Numenius is alluding toTim.28c, which he interprets as referring totwo distinct gods, the ‘father’ and the ‘maker’ being different. Plutarchdraws a similar distinction atQuaest. Plat.iiand it is seen subsequently inNeoplatonism. Plutarch distinguishes between the activity of a builder orweaver, whose product is separated from him and that of a parent, wherea principle emanating from the parent inhabits the child (1001a), ‘for,Chrysippus says, he who provided seed is not called father of the placenta,though it is a product of the seed’ (Quaest. Plat.1000f.). As God sowsfrom himself into matter, he can be regarded as both ‘father and maker’.Incidentally, this position is mentioned and rejected by Proclus atIn Tim.ip.319,15–20[Diehl]. Plutarch, however, justifies his position by pointingout that Plato regards the Demiurge as producer of both the body and soulof the universe. The former is composed from matter (1001b), while soul,as a partaker in intelligence, reason and concord, is both a work, but alsoa part of God, as it is produced not just by him, but from him.40Dodds:1960,15–1641Des Places:1973,10942Fr.17(26L=Eus.,Praep.

That said, it is possible toobserve echoes of the Gnostic current in the reference to a superior godwho remains unknown.Fr.18(27L.=Eus.,Praep.

The First God’s role in demiurgic causality seems to bethat of generating or transmitting a coherent scheme for organising matterto the Demiurge, who then proceeds to carry out, if not his instructions,then at least his intentions. Clearly, the idea of a subsequent ‘conversion’to philosophy on the part of the Demiurge propounded by certain com-mentators is out of place; he is ‘philosophising’ even at the moment ofworld-generation.

Numenius is clearly attempting to resolvethe problem bequeathed by Plato of how the Demiurge actually relates tothe Forms. His solution differs from the Middle Platonist refinement ofrepresenting the Forms as the thoughts of God. In Numenius’ version, byrepresenting the First God as the Form of the Second, he highlights theseparation between both gods and he lowers the status of the Second God,though he seems to be following Plato’sTimaeusmore closely than theMiddle Platonist development which makes the Demiurge the producerof the Forms.At Fr.21(Test.24L. fr.36=Proclus,In Timaeumi.303.27–304),Numenius is presented by Proclus as outlining the hierarchy of his threegods:Νουμήνιος μὲν γὰρ τρεῖς ἀνυμνήσας θεοὺς πατέρα μὲν καλεῖ τὸν πρῶτον,ποιητὴν δὲ τὸν δεύτερον,ποίημα δὲ τὸν τρίτον·ὁ γὰρ κόσμος κατ’αὐτὸνὁ τρίτος ἐστὶ θεός·ὥστε ὁ κατ’αὐτὸν δημιουργὸς διττός,ὅ τε πρῶτοςθεὸς καὶ ὁ δεύτερος,τὸ δὲ δημιουργούμενον ὁ τρίτος.῎Αμεινον γὰρ οὕτωλέγειν ἢ ὡς ἐκεῖνος λέγει προστραγῳδῶν,πάππον,ἔγγονον,ἀπόγονον. ̔Ο δὴ ταῦτα λέγων πρῶτον μὲν οὐκ ὀρθῶς τἀγαθὸν συναριθμεῖ τοῖσδετοῖς αἰτίοις·οὐ γὰρ πέφυκεν ἐκεῖνο συζεύγνυσθαί τισιν οὐδὲ δευτέρανἔχειν ἄλλου τάξιν.Numenius proclaims that there are three gods and calls the first ‘Father’,the second ‘maker’ and the third ‘product’, because the cosmos for himis the Third God; while the Demiurge is double, the First God and theSecond, and that which has been generated is the Third God. It is much43Des Places, Fr.20(29L.=Eus.,Praep.

But he whosays this first of all is not correct in numbering the Good with these causes:for it is not in its nature to be linked to anything nor to hold a rank secondto anything else.The hierarchy here is not that of Fragment11(20L), where the First Goddoes not play a role in world-generation, while the Second and Third can beregarded as the same entity. Here the Demiurge is listed as comprising theFirst and Second Gods, while the Third plays no role in the regulation ofmatter. Des Places points out that the equivalence God-Father is admittedimplicitly by Numenius, in contradiction toTim.28e3;whereποιητήςprecedesπατήρ,44while Numenius relegates the role ofποιητήςto secondplace. However, this fragment is a paraphrase by Proclus whereas Fragment11, as a verbatim citation (by Eusebius) has greater value. One must assumethat Proclus has here deliberately distorted theDreig ̈otterlehreof Numeniusor suffered a lapse of memory, but in a way the First God can be regardedas demiurgic, acting in collaboration with the Second God.MatterIn considering Numenius’ doctrine of demiurgy, it is necessary also toinvestigate his conception of matter. For Numenius, matter is not createdby the divine triad and it is involved in some sort of opposition to it,although the nature of this opposition remains to be seen. Fortunately, inthis regard, we possess some fragments quoted by Eusebius on the subject,but further information may also be obtained from Calcidius’Commentaryon the Timaeus, which used Numenius as a source, although a difficultyhere is that even though Calcidus refers to his predecessors, he does nottend to acknowledge his sources and we cannot always conclude definitiveuse of a specific text.45Numenius characterises matter as in a state of flux and uses the recalci-trance traditionally associated with it, at least from a Platonic perspective,to deny a connection with Being. His argument is that if matter is infinite(ἄπειρος), it is indeterminate (ἀοριστος), therefore irrational (ἄλογος),and if irrational, unknowable (ἄγνωστος). If matter is unknowable, thereasonwhyitisunknowablemustbethatitiswithoutorder(ἄτακτος).None of these attributes, according to Numenius, can be applied to Being.It requires an incorporeal power, which Numenius identifies with Zeus the44Des Places:1973,11345Va n W i n d e n :1959,13"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Matter159Saviour, ‘to separate corruption from these mixtures and to maintain them’(τὴν φθορὰν ἀμύνειν δύνηται καὶ κατέχῃ).46Numenius attributes motion in matter to a recalcitrant principle, whichrenders bodies incapable of remaining in a fixed position. The Second Godis clearly involved in continual temporal generation, rather than a once-offevent, since deprived of the principle that he injects into matter, it willno longer retain its position. This raises the question: what is the natureof this principle? I think that it is quite possibly soul (which itself is aprinciple of number). Just like the Demiurge in numerous metaphysicalsystems, including Plato’s own, the Second God orders, rather than creates,although the situation here is rather more complicated, since the SecondGod orders pre-existent matter using a principle which he himself has notcreated. While Plato’s Demiurge may order according to the Forms, heis still an autonomous Demiurge, rather than simply an ‘instrument’ of asuperior God, as is the case with Numenius’ Second God.Numenius explicitly states that soul is responsible for holding togethermatter and providing it with cohesion, although he indicates that there isa second principle, which maintains soul in its turn, but he is less clearabout what that is.47It is probable that the principle supporting soul isthe Second God, who implants it in the cosmos. Numenius regards soul asthe basis of movement. This must mean that soul is only the cause of allorderly motion, since, as has previously been illustrated, matter is regardedas subject to an irrational motion which does not partake of Being.Numenius has a problem here: how can he explain the action of anincorporeal (soul) upon a corporeal (matter). He is forced to concede thatsoul is three-dimensional, which allows it to permeate the ‘host-body’of matter. On soul’s tridimensionality, he claims ‘it is not such by itself,butκατὰ συμβεβηκός’, that is because of the body in which it is: . . .τῇψυχῇ καθ’ἑαυτὴν μὲν πρόσεστι τὸ ἀδιάστατον,κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς δὲ τῷἐν ᾧ ἐστι τριχῇ διαστατῷ ὄντι συνθεωρεῖται καὶ αὐτὴ τριχῇ διαστατή,‘and the soul by itself is without extension, but has it accidentally, since itresides in what has a threefold dimension, it appears to have a threefolddimension’.48Numenius is caught between the tendency to make mattercorporeal and the opposing tendency to make soul corporeal.49This sameproblem is evident in Calcidius, who uses Numenius as his main source46Fr.4a(13L.=Eus.,Praep. Ev.xv.17.3–8)47Fr.4b (Test.29L.=Nemesius,Περὶ φύσεως ἀνθρώπου,2,8–14). Despite coming from Nemesius,this passage can be regarded as reliable, since it is supported from Fr.4a, a citation by Eusebius.48Fr.4b (Test.29L.=Nemesius,Περὶ φύσεως ἀνθρώπου2.18).49Va n W i n d e n :1959,160"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"160Numenius and his doctrine of three godshere. Calcidius, in a similar position, believes that matter isinpetibilis,butbelieves that one may state ‘silva patibilis est’.50Plotinus radically breakswith this in his statementὕλη ἀπαθής ἐστι, ‘matter is impassible’. It is clearthat Calcidius is inspired by Numenius here. For Chrysippus matter wasindifferent due to its lack of quality:οὐ γὰρ ἥ γ’ὕλη τὸ κακὸν ἐξ ἑαυτῆςπαρέσχηκεν·ἄποιος γάρ ἐστι καὶ πάσας ὅσας δέχεται διαφορὰς ὑπὸ τοῦκινοῦντος αὑτὴν καὶ σχηματίζοντος ἔσχε, ‘for matter has not out of itselfbrought evil forth. For it is devoid of quality and all the variations whichit receives it has got from that which moves and moulds it’.51Van Windenraises the possibility that Numenius reacts against these words.52This hypothesis is rendered more credible by the distinction betweenessence and matter present in Numenius, which must come from Stoicsources. Essence for the Stoics wasfundamentum operis, ‘that out of whichsomething is made’ while matter was ‘the means by which the Makeroperates’.53I think that we can see the influence of this distinction uponNumenius in his attempts to posit a second principle supporting soulwhich also works upon matter. In this context, it is worth citing CalcidiusIn Timaeum293:Therefore, according to the Stoics, the body of the world is limited and oneand the whole and a substance: it is a whole, since no single part is missing;one, because its parts are inseparable and cohere together, an essence becauseit is the first matter of all bodies, through which – they say – stabilising anduniversal reason passes, just like seed passes through the genitals. Thereforethey suppose that this reason is a craftsman, and a coherent and qualitylessbody, completely passive and changeable, is matter or substance.This passage is interesting for the light that it sheds upon Stoic demiurgiccausality, but it can help us to better understand the fragments of Nume-nius. Clearly, he is opposed to the notion of passive matter.54Matter cannotbe without quality in his dualistic system. However, the Stoic speculation50Cf.Ad. Par.309,14851Plut.,De Comm. Notit.10765c–d52Va n W i n d e n :1959,100following a suggestion originally made by Leemans. Leemans adds: ‘Mate-riam fontem esse malorum iam veteres Pythagorei adserunt (Dox.Gr.302), quibus consentiuntomnes Platonici et Pythagorici recentiores’, ‘The ancient Pythagoreans claim now that the originof evil is matter; all the more recent Platonists and Pythagoreans agree with this position.’)53Va n W i n d e n :1959,9754Calcidius goes on to say (in Tim.295) ‘Numenius ex Pythagorae magisterio Stoicorum hoc de initiisdogma refellens Pythagorae dogmate’ (‘Numenius, who placed himself amongst the Pythagoreans,refutes this Stoic theory of principles with the help of a doctrine of Pythagoras’; as Van Windensuccessfully demonstrates (p.103–4), Calcidius is dependent upon Numenius for these sections onAristotle and the Stoics, a dependence betrayed by Calcidius’ statement ‘ut in Timaeo loquiturPlato’ (327,3), which stands out in a commentary on theTimaeus, and indicates that Calcidius ishere either following closely or merely translating Numenius."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Matter161on essence has left its mark, even on the limited fragments that we possess.The penetration of the Demiurge into matter uses a sexual metaphor andthis also cannot be Numenius’ view (although it can be seen as part of theStoic’s preference for the biological, rather than technological, image oftheTimaeus).55For Numenius, matter is not generated; he distinguishesbetween two states: one ordered and the other unarranged, and states thatthis unarranged state isaequaeva deo. This unarranged matter (chaos) oftheTimaeusis actually something concrete.In Timaeum296contradicts somewhat this image we have constructedof Numenian matter:Numenius says that Pythagoras also thinks that matter is fluid and withoutqualities. However, he did not suppose, unlike the Stoics, an intermedi-ate nature, between good and evil, which they classify as ‘indifferent’, butwhich, on the contray, is completely malevolent. However, for Pythagoras –and for Plato as well – God is the principle and cause of the good but thatwhich proceeds out of form and matter is indifferent. As a consequence,it is not matter, but the world which as a mix of Form’s goodness andthe evilness of matter, is indifferent. Finally, the world has been gener-ated out of Providence and Necessity, according to the doctrine of the oldtheologians.Numenius’ view that Pythagoras would regard matter as without qualitiesappears problematic in light of his view that it is also evil; this reminds oneof Plotinus’ attempts to reconcile both aspects of matter. Numenius breaksaway from the Platonic supposition that the world is good, regarding itas merely indifferent. The Demiurge in the process of world-generationorders by allowing form to become enmattered, but he cannot neutralisecompletely its inherent evil. Matter is improved as a result of this mixture,though the evilness inherent in its nature could not be removed throughout.Calcidius refers to the Stoic view that evil is caused by the malign influenceof the stars. Since Numenius too regarded stars as consisting of matter,he was not particularly open to this attempt to blame evil on malevolentastral influence. Sidereal motion, after all, is caused by the instability ofmatter, so even this explanation of evil regards matter as its cause.56TheDemiurge produces order out of disorder, but there must exist a secondprinciple which is the cause of disorderly motion. As Calcidius remarksanima silvae neque sine ulla substantia est, ‘the soul of matter is not without55Numenius uses the image of seed in an agricultural and not a sexual sense;cf.Fr.13.56Va n W i n d e n :1959,115"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"162Numenius and his doctrine of three godsany substance.’57Thismalitiafor Numenius is more than mere disorder;rather it is due to a ‘volition’ existing in the soul of matter.58And so God adorned matter with his miraculous power and he correctedits faults in every way, without destroying them completely, so that materialnature might not be completely destroyed, but not allowing them to extendand to spread out everywhere, but maintaining its nature, able to changeits condition from a troublesome into a desirable state, he transformedit completely, adorning and decorating it by joining together order withdisorder, measure with lack of measure and beauty with ugliness. Finally,Numenius says – and with good reason – that what comes into being freefrom defects can not be found anywhere, not in the crafts of man or innature, not in the bodies of animals, nor in trees, plants or fruits, not in thethread of air, nor in the current of water, nor in heaven itself, for everywherea lower order of nature mixes with Providence as a kind of contamination.And when, then, he wishes to show, and as it were bring to light a bare imageof matter, he says that all bodies which in the bosom (of matter), changeand cause change, should be removed one by one and we should consider inour mind that which has been emptied by this removal; this he calls ‘matter’and ‘necessity’. The work which is the world is from this matter and fromGod; God uses persuasion and Necessity obeys. This is Pythagoras’ assertionabout the origin of things. (Calcidius,In Timaeum299)Here the God attempts to improve matter during the process of world-generation in order to make it as good as possible, but defects remain,through no fault of the Demiurge, but rather in spite of his best efforts. Theimage of demiurgic causality ascribed to Numenius here is similar to that oftheTimaeus: Reason moulding Necessity as far as is possible through the useof persuasion. However, while Plato posits recalcitrant, pre-existent matter,to my knowledge, he never equates it explicitly with Necessity. Numeniusposits animated matter, which is more than an Aristotelianδύναμις.59To apprehend matter it is necessary to ‘think away all bodies’. Numeniusclearly envisages the essence of matter as non-corporeal. In reference to pre-cosmic chaos, he states that the bodies of matter are continually changingfrom [one form] to another in the womb of thesilva. This would meanthat matter is now being identified with the Receptacle; a modificationobservable also in Plutarch, but there the situation is somewhat different,as he regards Receptacle-matter as either passive or inclining towards thegood.

Perhaps itis under the influence of the Stoic distinction between matter and essence,although here again Plato’s use of ‘spatial’ terms (such asἐκμαγεῖον)torefer to material concepts makes such an interpretation justifiable.Clearly for Numenius, the principle opposed to the Demiurge in thesensible world is more than just matter. There is an echo of the maleficientsoul in precosmic matter posited by Plutarch. The Demiurge appears toproduce, not by adding anything to matter, but by removing its recalci-trance. Even if Calcidius is not a completely reliable source for Numenius,we can follow his statement here since it agrees with fragments we possessfrom Eusebius, such as Fr.4bandFr.49. In any case, Calcidius at thispoint does not try to mask the fact that Numenius stresses recalcitrance,while he, due to his attempt to free matter from evil, focuses more on itspliability.60Matter is also linked to Numenius’ daemonology, as illustrated by Fr.37(Test.59L.=Proclus,In Timaeum,i.76.30–77.23Diehl):Οἱ δ’εἰς δαιμόνων τινῶν ἐναντίωσιν,ὡς τῶν μὲν ἀμεινόνων,τῶν δὲχειρόνων,καὶ τῶν μὲν πλήθει,τῶν δὲ δυνάμει κρειττόνων,καὶ τῶν μὲν κρα-τούντων,τῶν δὲ κρατουμένων,ὥσπερ ̓Ωριγένης ὑπέλαβεν.Οἱ δ’εἰς ψυχῶνδιάστασιν καλλιόνων καὶ τῆς ̓Αθηνᾶς τροφίμων καὶ γενεσιουργῶν ἄλλων,αἳ καὶ τῷ τῆς γενέσεως ἐφόρῳ θεῷ προσήκουσι.Καὶ ἔστι τῆς ἐξηγήσεωςταύτης προστάτης Νουμήνιος.Οἱ δὲ καὶ μίξαντες τὴν ̓Ωριγένους,ὥσπεροἴονται,καὶ Νουμηνίου δόξαν ψυχῶν πρὸς δαίμονας ναντίωσιν εἶπον,τῶν μὲν δαιμόνων καταγωγῶν ὄντων,τῶν δὲ ψυχῶν ἀναγομένων...καὶἅπερ οἱ παλαιοί,φασι,θεολόγοι εἰς ῎Οσιριν καὶ Τυφῶνα ἀνήγαγον ἢεἰς Διόνυσον καὶ Τιτᾶνας,ταῦτα ὁ Πλάτων εἰς ̓Αθηναίους καὶ ̓Ατλαντί-νους ἀναπέμπει δι’εὐσέβειαν·πρὶν δ’εἰς τὰ στερεὰ σώματα κατελθεῖν,<ἐναντίωσιν>παραδίδωσι τῶν ψυχῶν πρὸς τοὺς ὑλικοὺς δαίμονας,οὓςτῇ δύσει παρῳκείωσεν...ἐπὶ δὲ ταύτης ἐστὶ τῆς οἰήσεως ὁ φιλόσοφος Πορ-φύριος,ὃν καὶ θαυμάσειεν ἄν τις εἰ ἕτερα λέγοι τῆς Νουμηνίου παραδόσεως.Some explain [the fable of Atlantis] as representing the opposition betweenthe two parties ofdaimones, a better and a worse, one superior in numbers,the other in power, one victorious, the other defeated: this was Origen’stheory. Others speak of an opposition of souls, the fairer ones who arenurslings of Athena against others who are attached to generation, and whobelong to the god who oversees generation. The champion of this doctrineis Numenius. Others combine the opinions of Origen and Numenius toproduce a conflict between the souls and thedaimones,thedaimonescausinga downward motion, while the souls are led aloft . . .

The nursling of Athena is Odysseus, who is protectedby her against Poseidon, the god of generation. Poseidon is not actuallymentioned here, but clearly the plot of theOdysseyis the basis for thisallegory. The sea is frequently used as an image of the generated universein Numenius (e.g. Frs.2and18), and Plato refers to Poseidon as the patrongod of Atlantis (Critias113c).61If Poseidon is meant to be the god of generation here, it is difficultto see how he could represent the same entity as the Demiurge, in spiteof his title. Athena is evidently intellect, and as such must be identifiablewith the First God. In this case, Poseidon cannot be the Second God,since he works in collaboration with the First, not in opposition to him.I do not see how he can even be identified with the Third God; he mustrather represent an irrational World-Soul like Seth-Typhon; the counter-motion ascribed by Numenius to matter. Numenius probably borrowedthis image from Pherecydes of Samos, who represented the conflict betweenthe gods and the giants as an allegory for the tension between the Demiurgeand the Errant Cause.62This acts as further evidence strengthening theinterpretation of Fr.37as an excursus on demiurgic causality in terms ofthe ordering of disorder. The pagan Celsus even saw the presentation of thepeplos to Athena at the Panathenaic procession as a representation ofdemiurgic triumph over disorder: ‘For he says that this depicts the rule ofthe motherless and immaculatedaimonover the arrogance of the giants.’63Celsus attributes this allegory to Pherecydes:61Edwards:1990,25862‘And [Celsus] says that Pherecydes composed a myth of two armies engaged in battle, Cronus ledone and the other was led by Ophioneus . . . and they agreed that whichever of them should sinkinto the Ocean (Og ̄enos) would be defeated, and the one which had driven them out and defeatedthem would possess heaven. [Celsus] says that these mysteries concerning the war waged by theTitans and giants against the gods and the Egyptian stories concerning Typhon, Horus and Osirissignify the same thing.’ (CCels.vi.42=Vo l .ii.P.iii.13Koetschau=Pherecydes Fr.

And he says that Pherecydesinterpreted Homer in this way when he said ‘the region of Tartarus is belowthe region . . . where Zeus casts down any of the gods who are insolent’.64Here we are dealing with a model of demiurgic causality to which Nume-nius owes a certain debt, since he borrowed material for his image of theCave of the Nymphs.65The Cave itself represents matter or the generatedworld, which is seen as home to evil forces, while the road to it is thedescent of the soul to the sensible world. This reveals a negative view ofthe generated world also observable in Numenius.66Porphyry’s interpre-tation of the Cave of the Nymphs can probably be regarded as the sameas that of Numenius, since Celsus is never mentioned by Platonists as anoriginal philosopher and since Porphyry admits that some of his knowl-edge of Pherecydes comes from Numenius. It is probable that Numeniusis responsible for the interpretation of this allegory as a metaphor for thedescent of the soul and the generation of the sensible world.67Numenius attempts to explain the nature of soul.68For Numenius, soulwas a mathematical entity, serving as an intermediary between physicaland suprasensible realities which partakes of the Monad in so far as it isindivisible and of the Indefinite Dyad, in so far as it is divisible. Des Placesnotes that the indivisible Monad is God, the Indefinite Dyad is matter.69There is nothing particularly unusual about regarding soul as a numberprinciple. Numenius, according to the testimony of Proclus at any rate,views it also as a principle intermediate between the suprasensible andsublunar worlds. Again the stress here is on the geometric nature of soul.Just as Plutarch stresses the fact that the Demiurge continually engagesin geometry, Numenius seems to regard ordering matter as some form ofmathematical activity. However, it would appear that Proclus has distortedsomewhat Numenius’ actual theory. He cannot have regarded soul or eventhe soul-principle as a mixture between matter and the Monad, since soul isexplicitly said to come from the First God. I think that Proclus, for whateverreason, glosses over the fact that Numenius posited a lower, irrational soul,64CCels.vi.42=p.112.20ff.Koetschau=Pherecydes Fr. B5DK65‘Pherecydes of Syros talks about recesses, and trenches and caves and grotto entrances and throughthese alludes to the generation and return of souls’ (p.77.18Nauck=Pherecydes Fr.B6DK.).

Numenius is supposed to have held the view thatthe incorporeal essence (ἀσώματον οὐσίαν) was homogenous (ὁμοιομερής)and that the totality could be found in the parts (ὡς καὶ ἐν ὁτῳοῦν αὐτῆςμέρει εἶναι τὰ ὅλα). Numenius, according to this fragment, located thesensible world, gods,daimones, the Good and the superior species (πάντατὰ πρεσβύτερα) in the soul, following the line of reasoning according towhich the soul does not differ from any of these in its essence. Each ofthese is instantiated in the world differently, based on the role which it isto fulfil (οἰκείως μέντοι κατὰ τὴν αὐτῶν οὐσίαν ἐν ἑκάστοις).The fragment comes from Iamblichus’Περὶ Ψυχῆς, and appears tocontradict the fragment taken from Proclus quoted above, which allegesthat Numenius regarded soul as a mixture between Monad and Dyad.According to Fr.41, soul is equivalent to Intellect, which in Numenianterms would make it identical to the First God. However, it is stressedseveral times in the fragment that what we are discussing is not necessarilysoul, but rather its essence. While Fragments39and41may not illuminatethe issue of demiurgy considerably, taken together they can be useful forcautioning one not to place excessive credence on fragments which do notcome from Eusebius, since they (may) have been distorted.Proclus offers another interesting comment on the mixture of divinitywith matter. After mentioning the Stoic claim that sublunar gods do nothave their essence mixed with matter, Proclus mentions Numenius’ formu-lation that it is the powers and activities (τὰς δὲ δυνάμεις καὶ τὰς ἐνεργείας)of the sublunar gods which are mixed with matter.70This fragment indi-cates that Numenius did not view either the Demiurge or the Third God asbeing enmattered, although their activities are mixed with it; a clear indi-cation that Numenius did not envisage the need for additional hypostasesor an equivalent of Philo’sLogos-Cutter in order to insulate the deities thatwere engaged in sublunar activity from matter; probably because his FirstPrinciple is already separated from matter by the two lower gods.70Fr.50(Test.26L.) Des Places=Proclus,In Tim.iii.196.12–19,Diehl"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Conclusion167The only other fragment of interest concerning matter is Fr.51(Test.28L.): ‘Numenius thought that all the elements are mixed and that not oneof them is in a pure state.’71Clearly, the Demiurge must then generate (ororder) the world by mixing the various elements in due proportion. In anycase, in the Platonic system, the world is constructed from a mixture ofelements, since unlike its Aristotelian counterpart, there is no room for theprimacy of any one element.ConclusionNumenius, a Neopythagoreanising Platonist, attempted to combine ele-ments from the great world religions with which he was familiar. In doingso, as far as can be observed from the surviving fragments, he producesan original account of demiurgic causality, while still claiming a Platonicprovenance. He cites the Second Platonic Letter (312e) as evidence that theconcept of three gods was actually the doctrine of Socrates and that Platowas the only one of his pupils astute enough to follow it. Valentinus andJustin Martyr both used this Epistle to advocate a similar view, but it isunclear who first devised this manoeuvre.72Evil enters Numenius’ system not through any fault of the Demiurge,but due to an opposed evil principle. However, it does seem that Numeniusbelieved in the existence of superlunary evil. Just as the Hermetists arguethat the rational soul acquires accretions during its passage through theplanetary sphere (e.g.CHi.25f.), Numenius argues that evil enters thesoul asἀπὸ τῶν ἔξωθεν προσφυομένων(‘beings attached from outside’).Calcidius states that Numenius located evil in the heavens, which Proclusregarded as an absurd opinion. It is unhellenic to believe in superlunaryevil, and it has been suggested that this may stem from Iranian influence,where the sun and moon are the only beneficent planets.73However, such aproblem can be resolved by considering Numenius’ view of demiurgy. Thesuperlunary evil he posits arises not due to the intention of the Demiurgeas in the Gnostic systems, but rather as a result of matter, which he viewedas composing the stars.In any case, such astral speculations lower Numenius’ standing inDodds’ eyes.74Yet leading Neoplatonic philosophers are not in the habit ofplagiarising from charlatans. Numenius propounded two postulates whichbecame fundamental to Neoplatonism, both of which are linked to his71Νουμήνιος μὲν οὖν πάντα μεμῖχθαι οἰόμενος οὐδὲν οἴεται εἶναι ἁπλοῦν.72Frede, M.:1987,105673Dodds:1960,5474Dodds:1960,11(quoted above, pp.139–40)"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"168Numenius and his doctrine of three godsview of demiurgy. Firstly, the notion that by participation in the intelli-gible world each thing possesses all things, though modified by its specialcharacteristics, as expressed by Proclus’Elements of Theology,prop.103orPlotinus’ἐξέχει δ’ἐν ἐκάστῳ ἄλλο,ἐμφαίνει δὲ καὶ πάντα, ‘in each of thema being of a different kind stands out, but in each one all are manifest’(v8[31]4.10). This argument was used by later Platonists to bridge gapsin their system.The second postulate was that of ‘undiminished giving’, whereby thetransmission of divine goods does not impoverish the giver, just as firetransmits light without being diminished. Plotinus uses the example ofcommunicated knowledge (iv9[8]5.4–9). It is this Numenian postu-late which prevents Neoplatonism becoming pantheism and ensures thatNumenius’ status as a philosopher is much greater than that with whichDodds credits him.Numenius represents a major development in terms of the doctrineof the Demiurge. While Philo’sLogosand Plutarch’s Osiris both havedemiurgic functions, neither is a fully-fledged secondary demiurgic deitycomparable with the Second God. Philo’sLogosis certainly a mediator,but Numenius’ demiurgic entity is more than a tool in the hands of God.Numenius emphasises the separation between the Demiurge and the FirstPrinciple, portrays world-generation in negative terms (as the result of anact of lust) and sees the Demiurge as negatively affected by matter in theprocess of cosmic structuring (if we interpret the division between theSecond and Third Gods as some fragmentation of the godhead). These areall of importance in the Gnostic and Hermetic systems."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"chapter 7On the fringes of philosophySpeculations in HermetismIntroductionThe revelations of Hermes Trismegistus to his son Tat form part of thesame intellectual current from which Gnosticism emanates. The fourteentreatises of theCorpus Hermeticumwere attributed by the Greeks to the godHermes. They were rediscovered in Western Europe when the manuscriptcontaining them was brought to Florence in1460by Leonardo of Pistoia.Cosimo de’ Medici ordered Marsilio Ficino to suspend his project on thedialogues of Plato to translate them and it was via this translation thatthese texts became the basis of the speculations in astrology and alchemythat were at the core of Renaissance Hermeticism, a fact which reducedscholarly interest in Hermetism until recently by stripping it of intellectualrespectability.The influence of Hermetism was weakened in1614by the discoveryof the Genevan Calvinist, Casaubon, that theCorpus Hermeticumshouldbe dated to after the beginning of the Christian era, thus denuding it ofthe lustre of its perceived antiquity. However, certain Hermetic doctrinescould be significantly older than the corpus in which they are contained.For example, the view that the world emanates as an overflow from Godcould be an ancient Egyptian one.1The ‘Throne Mysticism’ of esotericJudaism is another case in point; the seven initiated palaces of Heavenbehold the ‘Kabod’ (the glory of God in the guise of Man).2In addition,Jewish mysticism contains numerous speculations about Adam Qadmon(archetypal Man). In this light, Casaubon’s views become less cogent.The most striking appropriation of Hermetism from the Platonic tradi-tion is the equation ofNouswith the demiurgic entity. As with Gnosticism,it is an interesting tradition to study, due to its reliance upon an alternative‘creation myth’, which at points takes on a character of its own. While the1Salamanet al.:1999,122Copenhaver:1992169"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"170Speculations in Hermetismmain Hermetic texts do not appropriate specific passages or episodes oftheTimaeus, as is the case with, for example, Philo or Plutarch, they doborrow the synthesised mass of Platonising interpretations of the dialogue.For example, theNous(Mind) of thePoimandreswhich produces a seconddemiurgicNous, is reminiscent of Numenius’ theory. This secondaryNousgenerates the world on behalf of the FirstNous. The Governors can beassociated with the planetary gods of theTimaeus. Like Gnosticism, Her-metism has a heritage which lies outside the realm of Greek philosophy,and this explains why the correspondences between this tradition and thePlatonist one are not as strong as in other branches which drew inspirationfrom theTimaeus. However, in the rest of thePoimandresmyth, the Demi-urge appears largely redundant. Though he does produce the world, thefocus is on the descent of Man, in order to explain the high point of world-generation (the birth of mankind or more specifically the entrapment ofthat part of the godhead which goes on to become the human soul).Of particular interest in Hermetism is the manner in which various fea-tures of the demiurgic myth could be incorporated. There is a considerabledifference in perspective between the Hermetic myths and philosophicalinterpretations. Firstly, Hermetism is devoid of the notion of a Demiurgewho is continually active in the sense of continually ordering matter toprevent some kind of cosmic collapse. World-generation occurs as theresult of an error leading to division within the godhead, resulting in aless desirable state within thesupralunarrealm, and Hermetism envisages,indeed aspires to, a return to this state. Unlike the philosophical tradi-tions, the interaction of immaterial entities upon material ones does notrequire explanation, and, in fact, the position they occupy within the mythcan provide an impetus for altering their metaphysical function. Examplesinclude the redundant Demiurge or the position ofLogosbetween thelighter and heavier elements in thePoimandres(although this could also beinterpreted in terms of a mediating entity). Again, theLogosis redundantdue to the existence of the SecondNous.Hermetism welcomes Platonic elements into a structure developed outof the Egyptian religious tradition. Rather than developing the metaphys-ical aspect of the demiurgic concept, this tradition marshals the entities ofphilosophical discussions on the topic and uses them to people its myths.Hermetism welcomes such familiar features, as the concept that the cosmosis the Son of God (CHiv.8), who aids God in world-generation (CHx.1.9),the role of Necessity in theAsclepius, or envisages demiurgy as the differ-entiation of unordered nature. What makes it particularly noteworthy isthat it is the only tradition here analysed that posits a Demiurge, who is"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"ThePoimandres171largely irrelevant to its structure (the Gnostic Demiurge at least occupies acentral position in the myth of Sophia), and testifies to how pervasive theconcept was at this period with regard to speculations on the origin of thecosmos.Hermetism differs from Gnosticism in the use to which salvationalknowledge can be put. It is possible for God to be revealed to the Hermetistthrough contemplation during life, rather than for this ‘knowledge’ to beonly of real benefit after death, as is the case with Gnosticism. Rather thanstressing that the nature of man is alien to the world, the Hermetist expresseshis oneness with God, which tends to lead to a less severe anti-cosmicstance than is found in Gnosticism. Finally, Hermetism is not an elaboratemetaphysical system, but a mechanism for achieving spiritual progress,which is rather sparse on technical metaphysical elements. Gnosticism, orat least certain systems thereof, had certain quasi-philosophical pretensionsand this explains the greater emphasis on theoretical speculations.TheHermeticahave traditionally been divided into two classes: thephilosophicalHermeticaand the ‘popular’, or perhaps more correctly, thetechnicalHermetica. Although I am not in principle in favour of drawingsuch a sharp distinction between the two, as has been done by earlierscholars working in this area, such as Festugi`ere, nevertheless only thephilosophical texts need concern us here. As Fowden has shown, sincethe Hermetic texts cater for initiates at different levels of spiritual growth,attempts to categorise various sections of the corpus are doomed to fail.3Ye tfor the purposes of analysing demiurgic causality in the Hermetic tradition,it is, I feel, justifiable to focus on the more technical treatises.ThePoimandresOf particular interest for understanding the issue of demiurgic causalityis thePoimandres; actually only the first tract of theCorpus Hermeticum,although when theCorpuswas rediscovered in Western Europe, MarsilioFicino was mistakenly led to believe that the title referred to the entirecorpus. This is perfectly understandable.Poimandresnot only plays a piv-otal role in the first Hermetic treatise, but is referred to implicitly in theeleventh and is mentioned twice (by name) inCH.xiii.AsKingsleynotes,it appears that the figure ofPoimandreswas much better known in antiq-uity than emerges from the surviving remnants of Hermetic literature.4Itis important to bear in mind that Hermetism is not ‘serious philosophy’,3Fowden:1986, especially97–1044Kingsley:1993,1"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"172Speculations in Hermetismbut a spiritual conviction, which contains philosophical elements. In thePoimandres, then, we have an example of revelation literature, in whichPoimandres, the world-generator, reveals the truth concerning the struc-ture of the universe to Hermes; rather than a heavyweight metaphysicalanalysis.The role of the figure of Poimandres is key, not merely to understandingthe tractate, but also other elements of the Hermetic corpus, is evinced bythe concentrated efforts, not only during antiquity, but also in more recentscholarship, to discover the etymology of the name. In the thirteenthtreatise,Nousis portrayed in the role of a shepherd (poimainein), whileZosimus provides an etymology, revealing Poimandres to be theποιμήν(shepherd) of men (ἄνδρες).5However, an accusativePoimenandrawouldimply a nominativePoimenˆanerand following the normal evolution ofGreek etymology, we needPoimandros,Poim ̄anororPoimenan ̄or.Itisclear, then, that the Greek etymologies of the name are folk, or secondary,etymologies, and to understand the name, Poimandres, we need to lookfor an Egyptian origin.6‘P’ is the masculine singular definite article, which has been constructedusing the name of a divinity. Res is probably a Greek transcription ofRe.7It is proposed that Poimandres is actually a corruption ofP-eime n-r ̄e– ‘The intelligence of Re’. Parallels for a shift in Coptic ‘ei’ to Greek‘oi’ (which were both pronounced ‘ ̄ı’ by this time) exist and the genitive-nter ̄ecould easily have been altered to-ndresin Greek. This would makePoimandres a philosophical abstraction. When he identifies himself: ‘I amPoimandres, the intelligence of the supreme authority’, his name and titleare equivalent. In this sense, he parallelsPi-nous nte-pˆıot, ‘the intelligence ofthe father’, found in theGospel of Truth,orT-Pronoia n-t-authenteia,‘theforeknowledge of the Supreme’, found in theApocryphon of John.8It is usu-ally considered a Greek trait to personify abstract philosophical ideas, butthere are also Egyptian parallels, such asSia‘Intelligence’ andHu‘Word’.These two figures can, in a sense, be viewed as responsible for demiurgiccausality in thePoimandres,whereNousandLogosare responsible for world-generation. During the Graeco-Roman period, Sia was often equated withThoth, who is usually identified with Hermes Trismegistus, or else viewedas the initial revealer of Hermetism, while Hermes was its translator intoGreek. One of Thoth’s titles was ’ib nRa, ‘the heart of Ra’, which made himthe First Principle’s generative Intelligence. Poimandres must be another5Berthelot and Ruelle,1887–88, ii.

Theetymology of the name is important in terms of understanding who exactlyPoimandres is, helping to clarify certain strange elements which make nosense in terms of the Greek philosophical tradition.Initially, one is struck by the differences between thePoimandresandother Gnostic/Hermetic texts. The Demiurge may be separate from thesupreme principle, but there is no indication that he is in any way opposedto it. Indeed, the division of the godhead, which can be seen as a fall,since it makes the godhead less perfect, can be blamed on the supremeprinciple itself, since it seems to be partially responsible for it. It is alsodifficult to be sure how radically dualist one should consider the treatise.It is not entirely clear whether matter is the product of the First Principle,which of necessity would be less radically dualist than treatises which positpre-existent matter. However, in thePoimandresmatter is actually real, asopposed to theGospel of Truthwhere it is only real as long as one deemsit real; a more dualistic stance. In thePoimandres, the material world isonly inferior to the immaterial one; it is not actually described as evil. Itcould be argued that world-generation in thePoimandresactually fulfilsa positive role, allowing the improvement of the godhead, as each of theparts of divinity trapped in the material world finally return to compose amore united godhead. However, it could equally be argued that with therestoration of the godhead, we return to the stage before world-generation;and therefore the production of the world, in fact, accomplishes nothing.ThePoimandresis rich in material which helps to elucidate the natureof demiurgic causality, especially the cosmological section of the treatise(4–11). Poimandres first of all identifies himself as light, Mind, the shin-ing reason-principle (emanated) from Intellect and the son of God. Thisprimordial light gives way to darkness, and has often been interpreted indualist terms as can be observed by the subsequent comment at §4:εἶταβοὴ ἐξ αὐτῆς ἀσυνάρθρως ἐξεπέμπετο,ὡς εἰκάσαι φωνῇ πυρός(‘Thenhe uttered a cry of appeal, without articulation, such as I would com-pare to a voice of fire’). Festugi`ere regards this as the mark of oppositionbetween a brutal elemental character, as evinced by the cry, and the sanc-tity ofLogos, which he regards as speech denoting Reason. This plaintivecry, rather than denoting opposition, may be a sign of some sort of priorattachment between Light and Darkness; existing in the dramatic timebefore the opening of the treatise, as this generation myth commencesin medias res. Darkness must therefore have existed prior to its appearanceand the agitation it experiences seems to be a kind of primordial chaos.This attachment could explain why the Light becomes involved in the"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"174Speculations in Hermetismmaterial realm; perhaps producing the world by ordering matter as somekind of compassionate response.9The Light is the First Principle which then gives way to Darkness, theirrational, disorderly element, matter. Matter is not created by the Light,since it arises separately and there is no indication that it actually arisesout of the Light. A dualism is set up through the opposing states of Lightand Darkness, or the Nature it becomes. Light is serene (εὔδιος) and happy(ἱλαρός), while Darkness is indescribably agitated (ἀφάτως τεταραγμένον)and fearful and gloomy (φοβερόν τε καὶ στυγνόν). Light produces thehypostasis,Logos, by means of which it orders matter to produce theelements. It appears to be a compassionate response on the part of the Lightto the agitation experienced by Darkness.Logosenables Nature to releasefire and air, while earth and water remain behind intermingled, though itis unclear whetherLogosacts as a mate or a midwife. In any case, their birthis equivalent to their differentiation from unordered Nature and soLogosisthe mechanism of God’s world-generation. In this sense, it is equivalent toPhilo’sLogos-Cutter. However, the author of thePoimandresdid not needto postulate such an entity in order to insulate God from matter, sincehe later postulates the existence of a separate Demiurge. It seems that headopts the terminology and personified abstractions of Greek philosophy,in order to adapt them to his mythological framework, but without actuallyunderstanding the reason for their introduction in the first place. Thesepassages make very little sense in terms of Greek philosophy, and should,I feel, be read in terms of the Egyptian religious tradition. There is nostrife between light and darkness; in fact the light turns into darknessand the fire (again a form of light) arises out of the darkness. This canbe explained in terms of the Egyptian notion of cosmology paralleling thedaily appearance of the sun, where darkness is not just the opposite of light,but also its primeval form. Since God is equated with the light and light iseverything, God and the world are one: God is not actually a transcendentdeity.10Fire and air, the lighter elements, attempt to reach the Light, and eventhough they fail in their attempt, they ascend above theLogos. This appearslike a precursor to the entrapment of Man. TheLogosis produced out of theLight and by the Light alone, while fire and air are produced out of Natureand so theLogosshould occupy a position closer to God than they do. TheLogoscan be viewed as mating with Nature, just as subsequently Man does.9Plotinus also uses light imagery (in relation to the Soul’s descent to Matter e.g.Enn.i1[53]12.24–30).10R. A. Segal:1986,24"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"ThePoimandres175TheLogosis, in a sense, entrapped in matter, since even though fire and airform the supralunar realm, this is still a material realm. Earth and water, asthe heavier elements, sink to form the sublunar realm.11This leavesLogosas a separative element between the supra- and sublunar worlds.Earth and water, for the moment, however, remain undifferentiated,their intermingling is only ended later (§11). In terms of Stoic cosmology,which shares numerous parallels with the generative account of thePoiman-dres, this is incomprehensible, but the same situation occurs inGen.1.Indeed, thePoimandresaccount reflects in many ways the structure of theGenesisaccount (and it must be the case that thePoimandresis influencedbyGenesis, rather then the case that similarities are simply due to bothnarratives outlining world-generation; elements from other comogonicalmyths, such as a primeval monster or a cosmic egg, are here absent.)12Theorder of generative events in both accounts is similar: inPoimandres,theworld is generated in five stages: (1) the separation of light and darkness,(2) the separation of upper elements from lower, (3) the production ofheavenly bodies, (4) production of birds and fish and (5) land animals.This differs only slighty from the arrangement of the six days inGenesis:(1) separation of light and darkness, (2) the separation of the waters abovefrom those below, (3) generation of land, water and plants, (4) heavenlybodies, (5)birdsandfish,(6) land animals. It will be noticed that the maindifference is that thePoimandressimply assumes the production of landand water, but does not describe it. Dodds has also analysed the latterpart of thePoimandrestractate, which does not deal with the generationof the world, but rather consists of a sort of ‘Gospel of Poimandres’. Hedemonstrates that the ethical vocabulary overlaps to a considerable extent11A similar creation myth is mentioned by Copenhaver:1992,97–8which he finds in the first partofPapyri Graecae Magicaexiii(‘Eighth Book of Moses’): ‘When the god laughed, seven godswere born (who encompass the cosmos . . . ). When he laughed first, Ph ̄os-Aug ̄e [Light-Radiance]appeared and irradiated everything and became god over the cosmos and fire . . . Then he laughed asecond time. All was water. Earth, hearing the sound, cried out and heaved, and the water came tobe divided into three parts.

ThePoimandresis alsosimilar to Jewish apocalyptic literature, especially2Enoch, as outlined byPearson.14In thePoimandres, Hermes is almost asleep when he receivesa vision, he is called by name by a large being and God then reveals acosmology to him. In2Enoch, Enoch is at first asleep and then awakesto receive a vision; he is called by name by two very large men and Godthen reveals a cosmology to him. In both, the making of man is sevenfold(Poimandres§§12–19;2Enoch30:8–9).The separation of Word from God by fire and air, which rise up tooccupy the position between God and hisLogos, is strange in the contextof §6: ‘This is what you must know: that in you which sees and hears is theWord of the Lord, but your mind is God the Father;they are not dividedfrom one another, for their union is life.’ Here Word and Mind are portrayedas united, but perhaps this refers to the union within the individual. Yet,since man is the microcosm of the universe, if Word and Mind are unitedwithin him, they should also be united in the overall metaphysical scheme,which is clearly not the case.CHi.7presents the role of fire during world-generation: ‘But when heraised his head, I saw in my mind the light of powers beyond number anda boundless cosmos that had come to be. The fire, encompassed by greatpower and subdued, kept its place fixed.’ The countless powers in the lightmust be the Forms. The relationship between the Forms and the Fire isunclear. It is also unclear what exactly the great power which subdues thefire is. The Demiurge is subsequently presented as lord over the fire andso he is one candidate. Unfortunately, he does not exist at this stage. Aselsewhere in thePoimandres, the interaction of an immaterial entity upona material one is not properly explained.Poimandres responds to the issue ofcreatio ex nihiloclaiming that theelements of nature have arisen ‘from the will of God, which having takentheLogosand having seen the beautiful cosmos, copied it, having beenmade into a cosmos by means of its own elements and its production ofsouls’.15It is implied that the Demiurge does not produce the archetype ofthe sensible world, but it does seem that he actually makes the elements13Dodd:1935,173–514Pearson:1990,138–915CHi.8. This raises the question of where the Word came from."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"ThePoimandres177(though he may accomplish this merely by ordering pre-existent matter,like the Demiurge of theTimaeus), since it is claimed that they arise fromthe desire of God. The question here is whetherβουλήcan be regardedas a hypostasis of God. It may actually have the force of ‘Will’. In anycase, it is clearly a female generative principle, perhaps part of the Sophiafigure in Philonic terms. It may be another term for Nature, which isalso female.16Like Nature, Will receives the Word of God. However, itis not clear that Nature actually arose out of God, while the Will musthave. The Will and the Word cannot be identical; aside from the factthat Word is masculine and Will is feminine, they are described as matingwith each other. Will must be an entity that already exists, rather thanan unmentioned entity which arises along with Word, and so this leavesNature as the only suitable candidate. The highest principle then proceedsto produce a second demiurgicNous(ἕτερον Νοῦν δημιουργόν), ratherlike the system found in Numenius. The androgynous Mind, identifiedwith life and light, produces this Demiurge by speaking. The second Nousproduces the planetary entities, referred to here as Governors (διοικητάς).The Governors’ rule of the world constitutes Fate. The termἡ διοίκησιςτοῦ κόσμουis a standard Stoic expression for the ‘government’ of theworld’. It is the Demiurge who produces the planets (‘governors/heavenlygods’), although it is not explicitly stated who generates the sensible world.I think that we must assume that it is the Demiurge, since the Governorsonly seem to encircle or take control of what was already there. In any case,the situation is clarified further on in the text:ἐπήδησεν εὐθὺς ἐκ τῶν κατωφερῶν στοιχείων[τοῦ θεοῦ]ὁ τοῦ θεοῦΛόγος εἰς τὸ καθαρὸν τῆς φύσεως δημιούργημα,καὶ ἡνώθη τῷ δημιουργῷΝῷ(ὁμοούσιος γὰρ ἦν),καὶ κατελείφθη[τὰ]ἄλογα τὰ κατωφερ ῆτ ῆςφύσεως στοιχεῖα,ὡς εἶναι ὕλην μόνην.ὁ δὲ δημιουργὸς Νοῦς σὺν τῷΛόγῳ,ὁ περιίσχων τοὺς κύκλους καὶ δινῶν ῥοίζῳ,ἔστρεψε τὰ ἑαυτοῦδημιουργήματα καὶ εἴασε στρέφεσθαι ἀπ’ἀρχῆς ἀορίστου εἰς ἀπέραντοντέλος·ἄρχεται γάρ,οὗ λήγει·ἡ δὲ τούτων περιφορά,καθὼς ἠθέλησεν ὁΝοῦς,ἐκ τῶν κατωφερῶν στοιχείων ζῷα ἤνεγκεν ἄλογα(οὐ γὰρ ἐπεῖχετὸν Λόγον),ἀὴρ δὲ πετεινὰ ἤνεγκε,καὶτὸὕδωρνηκτά·διακεχώρισται δὲἀπ’ἀλλήλων ἥ τε γ ῆκαὶ τὸ ὕδωρ,καθὼς ἠθέλησεν ὁ Νοῦς,καὶ<ἡγῆ>ἐξήνεγκεν ἀπ’αὐτῆς ἃ εἶχε ζῷα τετράποδα<καὶ>ἑρπετά,θηρία ἄγριακαὶ ἥμερα.From the downward-tending elements, the Word of God immediately leaptup to the pure demiurgy of Nature and united with the demiurgic Mind (forit was of the same substance) and the downward-tending elements of Nature16Segal:1986,30"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"178Speculations in Hermetismwere left behind so that they were only matter. But the demiurgic Mind,together with the Word, encompassing the circles and rotating them in arushing motion, turned around his own demiurgy and permitted them toturn from a beginning without an end to an end without limit. For it beginswhere it terminates. And revolving exactly as Mind wished, they broughtforth from the downward-tending elements living things devoid of reason,(for they did not retain the Word/Reason), and the air produced wingedcreatures and the water swimming ones. And earth and water were separatedfrom each other, exactly as Mind desired, and ‘earth’ brought forth fromitself the four-footed and crawling creatures, wild and tame animals, whichshe held within herself, (CHi.10–11)According to this, the FirstNousremains the sovereign cause of world-generation, even though he acts via his son, theNousDemiurge.17This isseen in the constant emphasis on everything occurring according to thedesire of Mind. The Word seems to be another hypostasis of the FirstMind, which is closely associated with the Demiurge. The collaborationbetween Word and the Demiurge in world-generation is perhaps to beexplained as a remnant of the role played in creation by Sia (Intelligenceof the First Principle) and Hu (Word of the First Principle), rather thanin Greek metaphysical terms. It seems that the author may have perhapshad enough knowledge of Greek philosophy to posit a divineLogostoseparate his First Principle from matter, but then goes on to posit a seconddemiurgicNouswhich renders this principle redundant.ThePoimandresis attempting to integrate two rival cosmological tra-ditions and that is the reason for two separate demiurgic figures. Sincethe Demiurge is described asἕτερος νοῦς, he functions as the mind of thematerial world, much as God acts as the mind of the immaterial one. TheDemiurge is more of an independent entity than the Word, which is reallyjust a tool of God. Unlike Word, although the Demiurge descends, he doesnot sink below the realm of fire. The manner in which Word leaps out ofearth to unite with him echoes the manner in which fire and air escapedfrom Nature.It also implies that Word was trapped in matter and needed to berescued. Such a reading would at least have the benefit of providing agood reason for the generation of the Demiurge; though it is still unclearhow an instrument of God could become entrapped. Yet it seems that theDemiurge arises to generate the material world out of the elements released17Nock and Festugi`ere:1946,21n.33.cf.§12:παρέδωκε τὰ ἑαυτοῦ πάντα δημιουργήματα,‘andheentrusted him with all his demiurgic productions’."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"ThePoimandres179by Word, and Word utilises this opportunity to escape, rather than thatthe Demiurge was generated in order to release the Word.The Demiurge also appears morally better than Man since he neversinks into the material world. The evilness of his production cannot bereconciled with his presentation here. He never appears as evil or evenignorant in thePoimandres. If he is merely following God’s orders, thenthe evilness of the material world has to be blamed on God, rather thanon him. By setting the planets in rotation, the Demiurge impels Earth andWater to separate and bring forth living beings. This mode of productionis only indirect.ὁ δὲ πάντων πατὴρ ὁ Νοῦς,ὢν ζωὴ καὶ φῶς,ἀπεκύησεν ῎Ανθρωπον αὐτῷἴσον,οὗ ἠράσθη ὡς ἰδίου τόκου·περικαλλὴς γάρ,τὴν τοῦ πατρὸς εἰκόναἔχων·ὄντως γὰρ καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἠράσθη τῆς ἰδίας μορφῆς,παρέδωκε τὰ ἑαυ-τοῦ πάντα δημιουργήματα,καὶ κατανοήσας δὲ τὴν τοῦ Δημιουργοῦ κτίσινἐν τῷ πυρί,ἠβουλήθη καὶ αὐτὸς δημιουργεῖν,καὶ συνεχωρήθη ἀπὸ τοῦπατρός·γενόμενος ἐν τῇ δημιουργικῇ σφαίρᾳ,ἕξων τὴν πᾶσαν ἐξουσίαν,κατενόησε τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τὰ δημιουργήματα,οἱ δὲ ἠράσθησαν αὐτοῦ,ἕκασ-τος δὲ μετεδίδου τῆς ἰδίας τάξεως·καὶ καταμαθὼν τὴν τούτων οὐσίαν καὶμεταλαβὼν τῆς αὐτῶν φύσεως ἠβουλήθη ἀναρρῆξαι τὴν περιφέρειαν τῶνκύκλων,καὶ τὸ κράτος τοῦ ἐπικειμένου ἐπὶ τοῦ πυρὸς κατανοῆσαι.Mind, the Father of everything, light and life, produced Man; similar tohimself, whom he loved as his own child. For he was most beautiful, and hadthe appearance of his father. For God was really in love with his own image,and he entrusted him with his demiurgic productions. And Man, havingobserved the productions of the Demiurge in the fire, himself wished toengage in demiurgy, and this was agreed to by the father and entering intothe demiurgic sphere, having been awarded complete authority, he observedthe demiurgic productions of his brother, and the Governors loved him andeach gave him something of his own order and learning completely theiressence and partaking of their nature, the man wished to burst through thecircumference of the circles and to inspect the power of the one placed overthe fire. (CHi.12–13)Perhaps surprisingly, the highest principle is here identified asNous(inGnosticism,Nousis normally only the highest aeon). Outside thePoiman-dresthe only other parallel, to my knowledge, is the Naasseneνόμος ἤνγενικὸς τοῦ παντὸς ὁ πρωτότοκος νοῦς.18However, there are stronger con-nections within Greek philosophy. Anaxagoras positedNousas the highestGod:καὶ ὅσα γε ψυχὴν ἔχει καὶ τὰ μείζω καὶ τὰ ἐλάσσω,πάντων νοῦςκρατεῖ, ‘and Mind has power over all things, both greater and lesser, which18‘The generative principle of everything was the First-born Mind’, Ps.-Hipp.Ref.v.10;102,23W."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"180Speculations in Hermetismhave soul’.19Plato expresses the same idea atPhileb.28c6:πάντες γὰρ συμ-φωνοῦσιν οἱ σοφοί,ἑαυτοὺς ὄντως σεμνύνοντες,ὡς νοῦς ἐστι βασιλεὺςἡμῖν οὐρανοῦ τε καὶ γῆς, ‘for all the wise men are in agreement – feelingawe in this – that Mind is king of heaven and of earth’. The identificationis also found in Middle Platonism (cf. Alcinous10.2and Numenius Fr.17Des Places). The tendency is also observable in the Church Fathers,Clement of Alexandria atStrom.4.25(317.11St ̈ahlin) states:Πλάτων τὸντῶν ἰδεῶν θεωρητικὸν θεὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποις ζήσεσθαί φησι·νοῦς δὲ χώραἰδεῶν,νοῦς δὲ ὁ θεός, ‘Plato says that the God able to perceive the Formslives in man, and Mind is the place of the Forms and Mind is God.’This passage is problematic, since unlike in other systems which posit afall which occurs within the godhead itself, such as Valentinianism, wherea lower entity is responsible, here the FirstNousis responsible for the fallas the result of an act of narcissism. God falls in love with Man, becausehe sees in Man the reflection of his own beauty. God has to make Man,since if he was produced by the Demiurge, he could only be his equal, notbetter than him. Word and the Demiurge are both subordinate to God.The Demiurge is another Mind. However, Man is God’s equal (ἴσος§12).Even though God brings forth (ἀποκυέω) both the Demiurge and Man, itis only Man who bears the image of his father and whom God loves as hisson. Since God is perfect, it is acceptable for him to love Man, althoughthe sense here is sexual (ἐράω§12). What is wrong is that in his love ofMan, God forgets that Man is only a part of God, not a separate entity,and it is this that allows God to grant Man permission to separate from thegodhead, which necessarily results in a less perfect order than that whichexisted before.Man here is clearly the ancestor of archetypal man. If the Demiurge hasalready generated the material world, it is unclear what remains for Manto produce. Furthermore, there seems to be an element of rivalry in Man’sdesire to engage in demiurgy in order to emulate the Demiurge. It seemsrather as if he is to oversee his brother, since he was to have all authority inthe craftsman’s sphere. It is not apparent why God should hand over thegenerated world to Man and dispossess the Demiurge from a philosophicalperspective; this can only be explained, I think, as a result of God’s love forMan.Another problem concerns the gifts of the Governors. Normally, in theGnostic tradition this is negative; the mechanism by which the Governorstrap Man. But that is quite clearly not the case here. The Governors act19Anaxagoras, Fr.12"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"ThePoimandres181out of love and since they are the productions of the Demiurge, I thinkthat they must do this with his consent. This problem is linked to whyGod lets Man engage in demiurgy in the first place. If Man is ensnared bythe machinations of the Governors, then the First Principle cannot be heldcompletely responsible for the fall of Man. From §13, it seems that the errormay not have been Man’s initial descent, but his second descent into therealm of fire, which I interpret to mean the sublunar realm, since he doesnot do this with the permission of the First Principle, and it seems to bemotivated by nothing other than idle curiosity. In trying to trace the pointat which the error that involved world-generation, or the generation ofMan at any rate, occurred, it is useful to turn to the eschatological sectionof thePoimandres:καὶ οὕτως ὁρμᾷ λοιπὸν ἄνω διὰ τῆς ἁρμονίας,καὶ τῇ πρώτῃ ζώνῃ δίδωσιτὴν αὐξητικὴν ἐνέργειαν καὶ τὴν μειωτικήν,καὶ τῇ δευτέρᾳ τὴν μηχανὴντῶν κακῶν,δόλον ἀνενέργητον,καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ τὴν ἐπιθυμητικὴν ἀπάτηνἀνενέργητον,καὶ τῇ τετάρτῃ τὴν ἀρχοντικὴν προφανίαν ἀπλεονέκτητον,καὶτῇπέμπτῃτὸθράσοςτὸἀνόσιονκαὶτῆςτόλμηςτὴνπροπέτειαν,καὶτῇ ἕκτῃ τὰς ἀφορμὰς τὰς κακὰς τοῦ πλούτου ἀνενεργήτους,καὶ τῇ ἑβδόμῃζώνῃ τὸ ἐνεδρεῦον ψεῦδος.And then the human rushes up through the framework (of the universe) andhe surrenders the activity of increase and decrease at the first zone and at thesecond the contrivance of evils, now a device no longer actualised and at thethird the now inactive deceit of longing and at the fourth the eminence ofthe Archon, now devoid of excess and at the fifth impious courage and theheadlong rush of daring and at the sixth the now inactive wicked impulsesof wealth and at the seventh zone ensnaring falsehood. (CHi.25)The shedding of the ‘gifts’ of the Governors as the soul ascends towardssalvation, as well as the description of what the ‘gifts’ actually are indicatesthat they are evil. The gifts comprise ‘the energy of increase and decrease’,‘machination’, ‘arrogance’, ‘unholy presumption’, ‘daring recklessness’, ‘theevil impulses that come from wealth’ and ‘deceit’. These impulses becomeinactive as the soul ascends. This contrasts with §13describing the bestowalof the gifts. If Man’s fall began with his descent into the sublunar realm,then to be saved he only needs to return to the supralunar realm; he doesnot need to shed the gifts of the Governors. The fact that he does indicatesthat these played a role in his fall. In order to enter the (region of ) theOgdoad, the human soul has to be stripped of the effects of the cosmicframework. They are then transformed into ‘powers’ before they can enterinto the godhead."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"182Speculations in HermetismThe First Principle is transcendent, since he is described as locatedbeyond the ogdoadic region. The return of the human soul to the godheadis the restoration of Man to his rightful place in the cosmic scheme. Certainscholars, such as Segal, have been tempted to see in this a denial of thevalidity of world-generation, since it marks a return to the position beforeit occured. But surely, the material world would continue to exist; it is justthat humanity would no longer possess a material form. All that wouldbe undone would be the fall of Man, which was not foreseen or intendedby the First Principle. This indicates that the descent of Man in order toengage in demiurgy was a mistake, and along with the fact that he casts offthe gifts of the Governors in order to return to God, reveals that his falloccurred with his desire to participate in world-generation, not with hisentry into the sublunar region.This is in keeping with the treatise’s denunciation of the material world,since it means that Man’s desire to engage in demiurgic activity (not just thejealousy that motivates this desire) is evil. Segal goes a step further, claimingthat Man’s fall may, in fact, begin with his separation from God,20that isto say with his birth, in which case the First Principle is actually culpableon two accounts: for the generation of Man, which seems to be utterlypointless in terms of demiurgic causality and motivated by nothing otherthan narcissism, and secondly, for consenting to Man’s desire to create.Perhaps this scheme was meant to be along the lines of the Numenianone, with the First Principle handing over all of creation to Man, in orderto retire and contemplate the Intelligibles. However, there is no evidencefor this in the text, and there is no reason why God should hand over thematerial world to Man, rather than to the Demiurge. It seems, then, thatno justification can be found for the generation of Man.καὶ ὁ τοῦ τῶν θνητῶν κόσμου καὶ τῶν ἀλόγων ζῴων ἔχων πᾶσαν ἐξουσίανδιὰ τῆς ἁρμονίας παρέκυψεν,ἀναρρήξας τὸ κύτος,καὶ ἔδειξε τῇ κατωφερεῖφύσει τὴν καλὴν τοῦ θεοῦ μορφὴν,ὃν ἰδοῦσα ἀκόρεστον κάλλος<καὶ>πᾶσαν ἐνέργειαν ἐν ἑαυτῷ ἔχοντα τῶν διοικητόρων τήν τε μορφὴν τοῦθεοῦ ἐμειδίασεν ἔρωτι,ὡς ἅτε τῆς καλλίστης μορφῆς τοῦ ̓Ανθρώπου τὸεἶδος ἐν τῷ ὕδατι ἰδοῦσα καὶ τὸ σκίασμα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.ὁ δὲ ἰδὼν τὴν ὁμοίαναὐτῷ μορφὴν ἐν αὐτῇ οὖσαν ἐν τῷ ὕδατι,ἐφίλησε καὶ ἠβουλήθη αὐτοῦοἰκεῖν·ἅμα δὲ τῇ βουλῇ ἐγένετο ἐνέργεια,καὶ ᾤκησε τὴν ἄλογον μορφήν·ἡ δὲ φύσις λαβοῦσα τὸν ἐρώμενον περιεπλάκη ὅλη καὶ ἐμίγησαν·ἐρώμενοιγὰρ ἦσαν.And Man, having complete authority over the cosmos of mortals and overirrational animals, when he had burst out of the vault, he peered out of20Segal:1986,37"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"ThePoimandres183the framework (of the cosmos) and he exhibited to the downward-tendingnature the beautiful form of God, and Nature, seeing the one whose beautyis insatiate and who contains within himself all the activity of the governorsand the form of God, she smiled with love, since she saw the appearance ofthe most beautiful form of Man upon the water and his shadow upon theearth. And Man, seeing a shape similar to himself upon the water, as it wasin Nature itself, he fell in love and he wished to inhabit it. And the desireand the activity occurred simultaneously and he dwelt in the irrational form.And Nature, seizing her beloved, embraced him completely and mingledwith him. For they were lovers. (CHi.14)Nature’s love is understandable – she is drawn to a superior entity, as Manis the final emanation of the supreme principle, who resembles it in form.It seems that what we have here is some attempt by the inferior world toorder itself in response to what is above. This union between Man andNature symbolises the descent of the most perfect creature of the First Godinto matter.However,Man’sloveislessnoblethanthatofφύσις. He initially falls inlove not with Nature, but with his own reflection. In this sense, he parallelsthe Father of All,Nous, who falls in love with Man, as the reflection ofhis own image. In thePoimandres, this marriage of Man with matter canbe viewed in cosmological terms; explaining the manner in which thehuman form became enmattered; although here it is through no fault ofthe Demiurge’s. In later accounts of the myth, the focus tends to be moreon anthropological aspects; thePoimandresis viewed as an explanation ofthe dual nature of humanity (immortal and mortal elements). This waspossibly borrowed from Persian speculation.Bousset21records a treatise of the Emperor Julian,The Hymn to theMother of the Gods, which deals with the Attis myth.22Here a similar situ-ation is observable. Attis lusts after the Nymph and sinks into matter as a21Bousset:1907,184–522Sallustius,De deis et mundo4.8–9draws heavily upon the treatise of his friend, the Emperor JulianΕἰς τὴν Μητέρα τῶν θεῶν: ̔Η μὲν οὖν Μήτηρ τῶν Θεῶν ζωογόνος ἐστὶ Θεά,καὶ διὰ τοῦτο Μήτηρκαλεῖται·ὁ δὲ ῎Αττις τῶν γινομένων καὶ φθειρομένων δημιουργός,καὶ διὰ τοῦτο παρὰ τῷ Γάλλῳλέγεται εὑρεθῆναι ποταμῷ·ὁ γὰρ Γάλλος τὸν γαλαξίαν αἰνίττεται κύκλον... ̓Ερᾷ δὲ ὁ ῎Αττις τῆςΝύμφης·αἱ δὲ Νύμφαι γενέσεως ἔφοροι...ἐπεὶ δὲ ἔδει στῆναι τὴν γένεσιν καὶ μὴ τῶν ἐσχάτωνγενέσθαι τι χεῖρον,ὁ ταῦτα ποιῶν δημιουργὸς δυνάμεις γονίμους ἀφεὶς εἰς τὴν γένεσιν πάλινσυνάπτεται τοῖς Θεοῖς.‘For the Mother of the gods is the life-producing divinity and for this reason she is called “Mother”;and Attis is the Demiurge of what is generated and of what decays and on account of this he is saidto be found beside the river Gallus; for Gallus represents the galaxy (Milky Way) . . . Attis loves anymph and the nymphs are the overseers of generation . . . but since it is necessary that generationbe stopped at some point and that it does not generate something lower than what is worst, theDemiurge, having made these things, casts off his generative powers into generation and is joinedto the gods once again.’"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"184Speculations in Hermetismresult of this love. This sets into motion the generation of the world. Thedivine Mother is angry at this and Attis has to abandon the Nymph andreturn to her. This parallels thePoimandresin its postulation of a returnof the divine part of Man to the godhead, and can be interpreted as thedesire of Primeval Man to escape from Matter. Again, this postulates ananthropological interpretation, even though the myth also has a cosmo-logical role, explaining as it does the events that set world-gemeration inmotion.23The actual mating of Man with Nature is problematic. Nature is attractedto Man, not just because of his beauty, but also because of his power(ἐνέργεια§14). Segal claims that Man sees Nature himself, not his projec-tion of himself onto her. Upon the sight, he then spontaneously projectsthis image onto her, which then becomes enmattered in Nature. Segalregards this as the moment of Man’s entrapment.24However, I think thatMan sees a projection of himself (his reflection in the water) and falls inlove with it. Once he formulates this desire, he becomes spontaneouslyembedded in Nature, since his wish and action are simultaneous.This descent into Nature is motivated by Man’s sexuality. However,Man’s initial descent is motivated by his desire for power; to either emu-late or replace his brother, the Demiurge. Man is the ‘Son of God’ andNature is female. Since the result of this union is archetypal Man, whois androgynous, Man must surely be an androgyne. This means that heshould not really experience sexual desire (in the sense of the ‘desire forthe missing half’ illustrated by Aristophanes’ speech in theSymposium). Inany case, as an immaterial entity, he should be asexual (unless sexual desireis interpreted as some sort of spiritual lust; Sophia’s desire to know theFather in the Valentinian myth has strong sexual overtones). Furthermore,it is not clear how he could appease the sexual desire of a material entityor actually mate with her.The gifts of the ‘Governors’ (subordinate Archons headed by the Demi-urge, each of whom resides within a planetary sphere) cannot, I think, be23Julian himself explains the situation as follows atHymn to the Mother of the Gods8:Οὐκ ἄτοπονοὖν[εἰ]καὶ τὸν ῎Αττιν τοῦτον ἡμίθεόν τινα εἶναι,βούλεται γὰρ δὴ καὶ ὁ μῦθος τοῦτο,μᾶλλονδὲ θεὸν μὲν τῷ παντί·πρόεισί τε γὰρ ἐκ τοῦ τρίτου δημιουργοῦ(as Bousset notes at this point‘das klingt bereits ganz gnostisch’)καὶ ἐπισυνάγεται πάλιν ἐπὶ τὴν Μητέρα τῶν θεῶν μετὰ τὴνἐκτομήν·ἐπεὶ δὲ ὅλως ῥέπειν καὶ νεύειν εἰς τὴν ὕλην δοκεῖ,θεῶν μὲν ἔσχατον,ἔξαρχον δὲ τῶνθείων γενῶν ἁπάντων οὐκ ἂν ἁμάρτοι τις αὐτὸν ὑπολαβών.‘It is not surprising that Attis is a certain demigod, for this is what the myth means, or rather he isin fact a god, because he proceeds from the third demiurge and he is called back to the mother ofthe gods after his castration.

There is no indication that they implant sexual desire inMan, and, in fact, he falls in love with the image of his material self. Natureis not responsible for what seems to be a pre-existent sexual desire in Man,though there is no indication how it came to be there. In any case, if Natureis guilty of having tempted Man, it is equally clear that Man is only toohappy to be tempted (ἐρώμενοι γὰρ ἤσαν). I think that Nature is the meansby which Man brings to fulfilment his own narcissistic desires, a repetitionin some sense of the role that Man plays for the First Principle. The matingof Man with Nature creates more philosophical difficulties than it solves.Ironically, it means that the highest point of world-generation, humanity,was not actually envisaged either by the Demiurge or by the First Principle.I think that the whole episode can best be explained in terms of the mythicframework of thePoimandres, where Man has a complete persona and ismore than just an abstract philosophical entity.The mechanics of demiurgyAtCHi.17, we are provided with a description of the manner in which theelements interact during the generation of the world. Earth is the femaleelement, water does the fertilising (and is therefore the male component),Fire allows what has been generated to mature, while Nature works asan efficient cause, taking spirit from aether and producing bodies in theform of Man. Nature confusingly takes spirit from the aether, when shealready has an immaterial element in the form of enmattered Man. Inmost Gnostic texts, the body of Man is the product either of the Demiurgeor the Archons/Governors (identified with the planetary gods), but herethe human body is the product of Nature. Nature’s borrowing of spiritfrom the aether reminds one of the relationship which Aristotle envisagesbetweenpneumaand aether. Pneuma appears similar to Aristotle’s fifthelement, although its activity focuses more in the sublunar domain.25TheDemiurge of thePoimandres plays a relatively unimportant role in thecosmogonical myth. Once he has produced the Governors, he retires intoa passive obscurity.CHi.18outlines the mechanism of world-generation by division adoptedby the supreme god:τῆς περιόδου πεπληρωμένης ἐλύθη ὁ πάντων σύνδεσμος ἐκ βουλῆς θεοῦ·πάντα γὰρ ζῷα ἀρρενοθήλεα ὄντα διελύετο ἅμα τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ καὶ ἐγένετο25For more on this, see Edel:1982,53–4and412n.22; Aristotle,GAandMA;Solmsen:1957;Solmsen:1961, especially169–78."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"186Speculations in Hermetismτὰ μὲν ἀρρενικὰ ἐν μέρει,τὰ δὲ θηλυκὰ ὁμοίως.ὁ δὲ θεὸς εὐθὺς εἶπενἁγίῳ λόγῳ,Αὐξάνεσθε ἐν αὐξήσει καὶ πληθύνεσθε ἐν πλήθει πάντα τὰκτίσματα καὶ δημιουργήματα,καὶ ἀναγνωρισάτω<ὁ>ἔννους ἑαυτὸνὄντα ἀθάνατον,καὶ τὸν αἴτιον τοῦ θανάτου ἔρωτα,καὶ πάντα τὰ ὄντα.Upon the completion of the cycle, the bond of all things was dissolved by thecounsel of God. For all living creatures, being androgenous, were divided,including humans, and part became male and in a similar manner, partbecame female. But God immediately delivered a holy oration: ‘increase inincrements and become numerous in numbers, all you generated things anddemiurgic productions and let the one who is thoughtful recognise that heis immortal and that love is the cause of death and let him recognise all thatis in being’.There is no reason why the First Principle should suddenly introduce thedivision of the sexes at this point. Humans are already in existence as a resultof the fall of Man, and there seems to be no reason why the First Principleshould split them. All living beings, according to this, were originallyandrogynous. In the case of Man, this is easily explained as the result of thefall of his archetypal ancestor, but why should this be the case with otherliving beings? If it was the case, as the result of the design of the Demiurge,there seems to be no point in changing it at this stage. In the Gnostic andHermetic traditions, reproduction is often presented as a source of eviland it is unclear why the First Principle should be the one to divide theandrogynes, and advocate sexual reproduction. Equally strange is the factthat just after doing this, he then delivers a tirade against it. I think thatit is likely that it is only sexual intercourse among humans that is actuallycondemned. In any case, the idea of a primordial androgynous ancestor isnot uncommon. It occurs in the Gnostic creation myth mentioned in theRefutationof Pseudo-Hippolytus during his discussion of the Naassenes:‘For man is androgyne, they say...Attis was castrated...and has passedover to the eternal substance above, where there is neither male nor femalebut a new creation, a new man, who is androgyne’ (5.7.14–15). The samenotion can also be found in biblical texts.26Under the influence ofGen.1:27, Philo thought that humans were created in a divine image that waseither bisexual or sexually undetermined.The mechanism of reproduction by sexual intercourse is then establishedby Providence, through the instrument of Fate and ‘through the cosmicframework’ (ἁρμονία).27As in theAsclepius, it is apparent that Providenceand Fate are only instruments of the supreme god, not independent entities26Cf.Gal.3.28,6.15;Eph.2:15,4:2427CHI.19"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The mechanics of demiurgy187existing outside his control. Providence only acts after God has spoken.The allusion to Fate and the cosmic framework echoes again theAsclepius:the Demiurge or higher powers influence the world through the revolutionof the stars.It is difficult to understand the explanation of demiurgy presented in thePoimandresin terms of Greek philosophy. God appears to be both omnipo-tent and omniscient. He wilfully produces a world, which he then decidesto oppose. ThePoimandresnever explains or resolves this paradox. To acertain extent, world-generation is presented as afait accompli. However, asSegal points out, once thePoimandresis read in terms of myth, it becomespossible to find a solution. The god of thePoimandresmay be omnipotentand omniscient, but he is still capable of acting contrary to his knowledge,as in myth even the chief god may act under the influence of emotion.ThePoimandresdoes not attempt to conceal this paradox, but neither doesthe author seem to perceive the need to resolve it. As Jonas notes: ‘ThePlotinian descensus of Being, in some respects an analogy to the Gnosticone, proceeds through the autonomous movement of impersonal conceptby an internal necessity that is its own justification. The Gnostic descen-sus cannot do without the contingency of subjective affect and will.’28InthePoimandres, we have a perfect example of the flaws which Plotinusperceived in Gnosticism, not merely their radical dualism, but also theemphasis on revelatory assertion, rather than rational argumentation.The myth of thePoimandresis so problematic in philosophical terms asan explanation of demiurgy that there are those who prefer to read it in psy-chological terms. Jung regarded Gnosticism as the predecessor of alchemy.Just as alchemy sought to turn a base metal into gold, Gnosticism soughtto liberate the soul from the baseness of matter. He mistakenly equatedthe Demiurge with Anthropos.29For Jung, thePoimandresexplains notworld-generation, but the development of man’s psyche. The interrelationof the immaterial godhead and unordered matter represents the emergenceof the ego out of the consciousness. As he comments: ‘Gnosticism longago projected this state of affairs into the heavens in the form of a meta-physical drama: ego-consciousness appearing as the vain Demiurge, whofancies himself the sole creator of the world and the self as the highest28Jonas:1967,19329‘The primordial figure of the quaternity coalesces for the Gnostics with the figure of the Demiurgeor Anthropos. He is, as it were, the victim of his own creative act, for, when he descended intoPhysis, he was caught in her embrace. The image of theanima mundior Original Man latent in thedark of matter expresses the presence of a transconscious centre, which because of its quaternarycharacter and its roundness, must be regarded as a symbol of wholeness.’ (Jung:1969,197–8.9)"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"188Speculations in Hermetismunknowable God, whose emanation the Demiurge is.’ Jung radically altersthe meaning of thePoimandresbecause he reads it in psychological, ratherthan metaphysical terms. Whatever the merits of Jung’s theory, it doesshow that thePoimandreslends itself more easily to being read in termsother than metaphysical and should be treated more as a myth than as‘serious’ philosophy.Other textsCHiiattempts to discover whether God is an essence or not. AtCHii.6,the author denies that God exists as a spatial area (τόπος), but rather as aform of energy (ἐνέργεια), which is responsible for motion in the cosmos,although he himself remains motionless. At §12, this point is reiterated,butitappearsthattheReceptacleoftheTimaeushas somehow becomeequated with Aristotle’s Unmoved Mover:τὸν οὖν τόπον τὸν ἐν ᾧ κινεῖται τὸ πᾶν,τί εἴπομεν;...Νοῦς ὅλος ἐξὅλου ἑαυτὸν ἐμπεριέχων,ἐλεύθερος σώματος παντός,ἀπλανής,ἀπαθής,ἀναφής,αὐτὸς ἐν ἑαυτῷ ἑστώς,χωρητικὸς τῶν πάντων καὶ σωτήριοςτῶν ὄντων,οὗ ὥσπερ ἀκτῖνές εἰσι τὸ ἀγαθόν,ἡ ἀλήθεια,τὸ ἀρχέτυπονπνεύματος,τὸ ἀρχέτυπον ψυχῆς.What have we said concerning that place in which the universe ismoved? . . . For the entire Mind encloses itself entirely, free from all body,unwandering, free from affectation, untouched, being at rest in itself, ableto contain all things and preserving everything in being, so that the good,the truth and the archetype of spirit, as well as the archetype of soul are itsrays.In the Hermetic texts,τόποςhas three separate functions. It is (1) the spaceoccupied by a body, (2) the divineLogoswith which God fills the universewith incorporeal powers and (3) God, as that which contains all things andwhich is his own place (αὐτός ἐστι χώρα ἑαυτοῦ,κεχωρηκὼς ἑαυτόν).30This Intellect,τόπος, is a god, but he is not the First God. This shift frompassive Receptacle to an independent divine entity is as interesting as it isunnecessary. It does, however, help to explain the interaction between thesupreme transcendent God, and the cosmos. It is evident that the First Goddoes not occupy a place in this world, and that He is above all Intellect, aswell as all essence (§5).The same idea can be found atCHv.10where there is no space aroundGod because He embraces everything:οὐ τόπος ἐστὶ περὶ σέ,‘thereisno30Nock and Festugi`ere:1946,39n.14"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Other texts189space around you’.31Atxi.18, there is the comment that if all things arecontained in God, they are not contained in the same manner as in a spatialarea. Finally, as Festugi`ere points out, in theExcerpta ex Theodoto34,37,38ss,τόποςis used as a name for God.AtCHiiiwe have an account of world-generation which parallels that ofthePoimandres; the light elements separate themselves from the others byrising, and the heavy ones sink down, and all this division is accomplishedby fire. However, here world-generation is performed by a number ofsubordinate Demiurges:ἀνῆκε δὲ ἕκαστος θεὸς διὰ τῆς ἰδίας δυνάμεως τὸ προσταχθὲν αὐτῷ,καὶἐγένετο θηρία τετράποδα καὶ ἑρπετὰ καὶ ἔνυδρα καὶ πτηνὰ καὶ πᾶσασπορὰ ἔνσπορος καὶ χόρτος καὶ ἄνθους παντὸς χλόη·τὸ σπέρμα τῆςπαλιγγενεσίας ἐν†ἑαυτοῖς ἐσπερμολόγουν†Each god sent forth by his own power that which had been assigned to him,and the four-footed and crawling beasts were generated and the aquatic andthe winged and every productive seed and grass and all flowering plants.They all acquired in themselves the seeds of rebirth. (§3)The Demiurge makes the cosmos not by hand, but by speech and throughhis will.32It is clear that this passage is modelled afterGenesis1.AtCHiv.1, we have a further discussion of the manner of world-generation:ἐπειδὴ τὸν πάντα κόσμον ἐποίησεν ὁ δημιουργός,οὐ χερσὶν ἀλλὰ λόγῳ,ὥστε οὕτως ὑπολάμβανε ὡς τοῦ παρόντος καὶ ἀεὶ ὄντος καὶ πάνταποιήσαντος καὶ ἑνὸς μόνου,τῇ δὲ αὐτοῦ θελήσει δημιουργήσαντος τὰὄντα·τοῦτο γάρ ἐστι τὸ σῶμα ἐκείνου,οὐχ ἁπτόν,οὐδὲ ὁρατόν,οὐδὲμετρητόν,οὐδὲ διαστατόν,οὐδὲ ἄλλῳ τινὶ σώματι ὅμοιον·οὔτε γὰρ πῦρἐστιν οὔτε ὕδωρ οὔτε ἀὴρ οὔτε πνεῦμα,ἀλλὰ πάντα ἀπ’αὐτοῦ.ἀγα-θὸς γὰρ ὢν,<οὐ>μόνῳ ἑαυτῷ τοῦτο ἀναθεῖναι ἠθέλησε καὶ τὴν γῆνκοσμῆσαι...Since the Demiurge made the entire cosmos not by hand, but by rea-son/speech, so that at present you might understand him as always existingand as having made everything and as one alone, and as having crafted thatwhich is by means of his will. For this is his body, intangible, invisible,immeasurable, unextended, dissimilar to any other body. For it is neitherfire nor water nor air nor spirit, but everything comes from it. For beinggood, he did not wish to set this up as a votive gift for himself alone and toordertheearth...31Parallels to this can be found in PhiloLeg.

The Demiurge’s body isnot the visible cosmos (as it is not sense-perceptible), but it is the source ofthe physical world. The cosmos can be said to be the body of the Demiurge,in so far as he is the Reason pervading the universe. As the Demiurge’s bodyis immaterial (illustrated by the comment that it is not one of the elements)all things only come from his body in so far as he transmits the powers ofthe suprasensible world to the sublunar realm and orders matter. The stresson the fact that God does not create like a craftsman is noteworthy, since itechoes the comments of Plutarch that the Demiurge does not produce likea man, but through the use of mathematical principles. It seems here thatthe Demiurge merely has to command and matter obeys him. This is statedagain atCHv.4, where Hermes acknowledges that matter is deficient butnevertheless it obeys the Maker.Imperfection in the world occurs when bodies are no longer able tocontain the Monad (CHiv.11). This same idea occurs throughout thecorpus. AtCHvi.2, there is no place in that which has come to be forthe Good. The world is not good since it is in motion, but it is notbad since it is immortal. AtCHvi.3, the world is only good in relativeterms; absolute goodness in the material realm is impossible. This sameidea is also expressed atCHx.10: even if the world is beautiful, it is notgood since it is constructed from matter. CHxi.3is more optimistic – thecosmos is ordered by Eternity, which is a constitutent of God’s wisdom,by introducing immortality and permanence into matter.CHviiiandixCHviiipresents the Stoic idea that there is no such thing as absolute death,merely the dissolution of elements. God generated the world because Hewanted to adorn the beings lower down on the ontological scale with everyquality (§3). He made the world in the form of a sphere which is immortal.The only point worthy of note is the manner in which God constructs theworld modelled on the intelligible archetypes implanting ‘in the sphere thequalities of forms, shutting them up as in a cave’.33This comment is madeagainst the background of the usual platitudes concerning the disorderof matter and its retention of this quality even after it has been ordered.The reference appears to indicate that the images of the Forms becomeenmattered against their will, but this line is probably a sophisticatedliterary allusion.

It relates the three terms:Man (§1–2), World (§6–8)andGod(§9) in the same manner. God is thefather of the world, just as the world is the father (surely mother wouldbe more appropriate) of the beings which it contains.36The treatise alsorefutes the notion that God is unthinking and without thought (§3–6)since being all things and in all things, He is necessarily intellective. §3outlines the influence of God on individuals:ὁ γὰρ νοῦς κύει πάντα τὰ νοήματα,ἀγαθὰ μέν,ὅταν ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ τὰσπέρματα λάβῃ,ἐναντία δέ,ὅταν ὑπό τινος τῶν δαιμονίων,μηδενὸς μέρουςτοῦ κόσμου κενοῦ ὄντος δαίμονος†τῷ ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ πεφωτισμένῳ δαίμονι†ὅστις ὑπεισελθὼν ἔσπειρε τῆς ἰδίας ἐνεργείας τὸ σπέρμα,καὶ ἐκύησενὁνοῦςτὸσπαρέν,μοιχείας,φόνους,πατροτυπίας,ἱεροσυλίας,ἀσεβείας,ἀγχόνας,κατὰ κρημνῶν καταφοράς,καὶ ἄλλα πάντα ὅσα δαιμόνων ἔργα.For Mind conceives every thought: the good, when Mind receives seedsfrom God and the opposite, when they are received from somedaimonandthere is no part of the cosmos which is without adaimon, which enteringimperceptibly sows the seed of its own activity and Mind conceives what hasbeen sown, adulteries, murders, beating one’s own father, temple-robberies,ungodliness, suicide by hanging or jumping off a cliff and other works ofdaimonessimilar in kind.Here Mind is clearly not the First Principle, as in thePoimandres.Thepositing of evildaimoneshelps to protect God from responsibility for theexistence of evil. The author then adopts the Socratic stance that God isthe cause only of a few things, i.e. of the Good: ‘Few seeds come fromGod, but they are potent and beautiful and good.’The author ofCHixbelieves firmly in the goodness of the cosmos, andtherefore in the goodness of the Demiurge.37It is only the sublunar regionwhich is evil. The products of the Demiurge are originally good, but themotion of the cosmos soils some with vice (ῥυπαίνουσα τῇ κακίᾳ,CHix.5). This account echoes that of theTimaeus, God, being good, fashionseverything for the best, but it is Necessity which is responsible for evil.This cosmic motion is rather vague and could indicate either recalcitrantmatter or malign astral influence.34Porphyry is only building on previous exegeses, such as that of Cronius.35Copenhaver:1992,14936Nock and Festugi`ere:1946,9237CHix.4"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"192Speculations in HermetismAll matter is used in world-generation. The cosmos is a closed sys-tem in which the matter that it contains is continually reused, as cosmicmotion renews and dissolves everything. God uses the cosmos as an instru-ment (ὂργανον),38which makes everything itself (ἵνα πάντα παρ’ἑαυτῷ)through preserving (φυλάττων) the seeds which it has received from God.After God has set everything in order, the cosmos is capable of functioningon its own to maintain the life contained within it as a sort of secondDemiurge; it is explicitly referred to as a craftsman of life (δημιουργὸςζωῆς). Just as in thePoimandres, cosmic motion was the means by whichthe Demiurge produces, so here too it is the mechanism by which thecosmos ensures the preservation of life; engaging in a sort of continualtemporal world-generation, as it were, through its motion.39The motion of the cosmos produces various kinds of bodies from differ-ent combinations of the elements; heavier bodies are more composite andlighter bodies are simpler.40God transmits the Forms to the cosmos, whichis only responsible for producing the individual instantiations. The cosmosdoes not produce the type, but by its revolutions it modifies each type toproduce new individuals, and by this process ensures that each kind is pre-served, since it is continually replenished. This partnership between Godand the cosmos is stressed in the presentation of a father–son relationshipbetween the two; the cosmos’ role as a secondary Demiurge is representedby the claim that the cosmos is the father of the things within it.41This text seems to do no more than reproduce Platonic platitudes, butit is precisely this fact which renders it noteworthy. Unlike most Gnosticor Hermetic texts, there is no separation here between the First Principleand the Demiurge. Were it not for the fact that this text was attributed toHermes Trismegistus, one would have difficulty claiming that it belongsto the same tradition as thePoimandres.EvenCHviii, with whichCHixshares so many correspondences, draws a distinction between a First andSecond God.

In this context, I prefer Festugi`ere’s translation ofἀγαθόν ἐστιτὸ ποιητικόν‘leBien...leprinciple efficient’, which stresses the demiurgicrole of the First Principle. The boundary between God the Father and theGood is blurred: ‘and God the Father is the Good in that he “wills” allthings to be’.43The First Principle is even described as the one managingthe universe like a statesman and through the use of Intellect: ‘And this isthe regulation of the universe, dependent upon the nature of the one andextending through the one mind.’44AtCHxi.2, God generates the world with the assistance of another agent:‘God makes Eternity, and Eternity makes the cosmos; the cosmos makesTime and Time makes generation.’45Eternity is described as a power of god(δύναμις δὲ τοῦ θεοῦ(§3)) and Eternity is not only its creator, but also theguarantor of survival, because Eternity is imperishable. Eternity here retainsthe same signification as philosophical Eternity, as the immaterial modelfrom which cosmic time was formed. However, it has been transformedinto a hypostasis of God, and functions as a co-Demiurge. It is a kindof Hermetic hybrid between divine wisdom and the World-Soul, since itis Eternity which sets the world in order by introducing immortality andduration (τὴν ἀθανασίαν καὶ διαμονὴν(§3)) to matter. Eternity, however,is not an independent agent, but is completely dependent upon God (§4).Using Providence, Necessity, and Nature, Eternity is able to preserve theworld.

For it is not possible to maintain a single orderamongst many. For envy of the better is the consequence of multiplicity.The text adopts a classic Aristotelian formulation against the existence ofmultiple Demiurges; if there is one order, there can only be one Maker,established at Arist.Metaphysicsl.10,46(though naturally this applies tocoordinate, rather than subordinate demiurges). The text argues againstthe possibility of a Demiurge of immortal entities and a Demiurge ofmortal ones; a position which in fact runs counter to that adopted by theTimaeus. Since matter is one and soul is one, the treatise cannot envisagethe possibility of two Demiurges. The One God is the sole producer ofsoul and all living beings provided with it (CHxi.11). In fact, giving lifeto all living things and providing them with movement takes the place ofmotion and life for God (§17).CHxii.14adopts the same position. The entire succession of entitiessometimes seen as exercising an influence on causality independent of theDemiurge are placed firmly under his control. Necessity, Providence andNature are the instruments of the organisation of matter. God energisesmatter by permeating it (§22–3).

However, thecontinued existence of generation makes it degenerate, on account of whichGod made change for the repurification of generation.The Demiurge combats evil by eternal temporal generation in order tomaintain thestatus quo. It is as if matter is continually attempting tobreak its bonds and the Demiurge has to continually order it. This passagealso counters the belief of some Gnostics that extending divine unity intocreative diversity would taint the supreme god, leading to the standardGnostic postulation of the Demiurge.AsclepiusTheAsclepiusis the Latin translation of the Greek treatiseLogos teleios(Perfect Discourse). Lydus and Lactantius both reproduce passages from itin Greek.47Theterminus ante quemfor the Greek text, then, is the earlyfourth century, but a Latin version of thesermo perfectuscorrespondingto our version ofAsclepiuscan first be found in Augustine‘sCity of God(413–26). Due to the number of early references to this text which comefrom North African Christians, the Latin version may have been producedthere. In any case, the treatise covers a great many topics, leading somescholars to suggest that theAsclepiusis a synthesis of other works.At §2–3the text outlines the composition of the world from the fourelements.As elsewhere in the Hermetic corpus, it is fire that is represented as thelife-giving element. Most interesting of all is the reference to ‘one matter,47Copenhaver:1992,214–Divine Institutes2.14.6;4.6.4;7.18.4(cf.Asclep.28,8,26);De mens.4.7.149(cf.Asclep.19,39,28)."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"196Speculations in Hermetismone soul and one god’; theAsclepiusexhibits monotheistic tendencies; eventhough it does refer to numerous gods; as elsewhere in the Hermetic corpus,these seem to be understood as merely instantiations of the supreme God.AtAsclepius§8, the author outlines the manner of world-generation:When the master and framer of everything, whom we rightly call God, madea second after himself, who is able to be seen and perceived . . . this secondafter himself seemed beautiful to him, since it was most full of the goodnessof all things and he loved it as the offspring of his divinity. Therefore, he wasso great and good, that he wished that there might be another who might beable to gaze upon him, whom he had made from himself and immediatelyhe made Man, the imitator of his reason and diligence.This passage outlines a different method of generation from that containedin thePoimandres. The First God is evidently the Demiurge, since heis the shaper of all things and the text goes on to state that God’s good-ness is the reason for his production. The Second God seems to adoptsomewhat the role of Man in thePoimandres; God falls in love with himas a reflection of his own beauty. In any case, this passage was misreadby Christian interpreters such as Lactantius, who cites it as evidence thatHermes Trismegistus was aware that the supreme God had a son.48TheSecond God here is obviously the cosmos, as is explicitly stated at §10.Scott viewed this passage as modelled onTim.29e–31b,37c,92c and it iseasy to observe numerous correspondences between both texts, particularlythe emphasis given to the concept of Plenitude.The passage then goes on to outline the manner in which God mademan:And so when he ‘had made’ manous ̄ıodesand observed that he was not ableto take care for all things, unless he covered him with an earthly shelter,he covered him with a bodily home and he directed that humans be ofsuch a kind, combining and mixing both natures in one to the extent thatwas appropriate. And so he formed man from the nature of soul and body,that is from the eternal and mortal, in order that the animal so formedmight prove satisfactory to both his origins and might admire and adore thecelestial things and might care for and govern earthly things.Again here, it is the First Principle who functions as the Demiurge. Thedescription of the mingling of two substances of a separate order recallsPlato’s account of the blending of soul substance out of Sameness andDifference in theTimaeus.TheAsclepiusseems to take a more positive48Lactantius cites fromLogos teleios–Divine Institutes4.6.4– Copenhaver:1992,222"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Other texts197stance regarding the cosmos than is usual in Hermetism. Here mankind’sphysical incarnation is not the result of some kind of fall (as it is in thePoimandres), but rather part of the rational design of a demiurgic FirstPrinciple. The material wrapping (mundano integimento)isnotregardedasa prison, but rather as a mechanism allowing Man to fulfil his designatedrole in the ontological scheme.The conflict between Reason and Necessity found in Plato’sTimaeus,which left its mark on many other Platonic metaphysical schemes with morepronounced dualistic tendencies, is opposed by the author of theAsclepius(§8): ‘Necessity follows God’s pleasure; result attends upon his will. Thatanything agreed by God should become disagreeable to him is incrediblesince he would have known long before that he would agree and that it wasto be’. Here there is no question of any entity being capable of opposingthe supreme God. The passage, unfortunately, does not really explain themechanism of demiurgic causality: the will of God is itself sufficient toproduce the end result. God generates Man as a ‘well-ordered world’.49This is clearly modelled on Plato’s description of man as a microcosm ofthe well-ordered world in theTimaeus.A more detailed description of demiurgy is provided at §14.Thetwostandard Platonic principles are posited: God and a pre-existent matter,which contains some kind of motion of its own. (The text refers to aspirit existing within it.) The account is garbled at this point: ‘spirit was inmatter, but it was not in matter, as it was in God’.50It is difficult to find aphilosophical explanation for this and perhaps the best solution is to regardthis as an attempt to create the illusion of a religious mystery, especiallysince the text goes on to make further statements in a similar vein: ‘Buthyl ̄e(or the nature of matter) and spirit, though from the beginning they seemnot to have come to be, nonetheless possess in themselves the power andnature of their coming to be and procreating. For the beginning of fertilityis in the quality of nature, which possesses in itself the power and thematerial for conceiving and giving birth.’ This statement is problematic. Itnot only makes matter a co-Demiurge with God, but it states that natureis capable of production itself. In thePoimandres, Nature is incapable ofworld-generation herself, but requires Man. The Demiurge must not bethe producer of soul, if that is what the author means by spirit here. Sincematter possesses spirit, there may be some kind of idea of matter attemptingto order itself by responding to the upper world and attempting to imitateit.49Asclepius1050trans.

Scott modified the schema toproduce the following pairings of intelligible and sensible gods: (Panto-morphos, Decans), (Heimarmen ̄e, Spheres), (ZeusNeatos (probably Hadesruling the air), sublunar atmosphere), (Zeus Chthonios, Earth and Water).Scott compared this to similar structures in the Stoic Posidonius and thePlatonist Xenocrates, although Festugi`ere did not accept either Scott’sposition thatousiawas Stoic corporeal substance or Murray’s that it wasPlatonic intelligible essence.53Festugi`ere comparedousiahere to its usage inIamblichus, designating secondary deities, and I think that this is probablythe case.

For example, the lightproduced by the planets is radiated into the air, and transmitted by the airto the earth.Theousiarchaior ‘Departmental Rulers’ have specifically delineatedfunctions. The uppermostousiarchtransmits the generic forms of the idealworld to theousiarchbelow him, to be modified by individual differencesbefore being implanted in matter to form individual bodies. The passagecan equally be read in terms of Stoic doctrine: that the outermostousiarchemits fire, which passes through the chain of lower-rankingousiarchai,before combining with air to formπνεῦμα.TheAsclepiusattempts tocombine elements from different philosophical schools, but they are notalways completely harmonised and the details do not seem to have beenfully worked out, as is the case here.54The individual forms are bestowed by theousiarchof the fixed stars. Hedoes this through the revolution of his sphere which modifies the form-type, since each individual is born under a different aspect of the Decans.Heimarmen ̄e,theousiarchof the planets, governs the alterations that theform will undergo during its existence. Air receives all these influences andthen redistributes them. Theousiarchof earth and sea supplies nutrimentto the material bodies.The reason Scott attributed this scheme to a Stoic source was that thenearest analogies can be found in Stoic systems.55Zeus is named here as thegod who governs the cosmos, which is more characteristic of Stoicism56than Hermetism, where Zeus normally only occurs as the name of theplanet Jupiter.57The scheme is vaguely reminiscent of the myth of thePhaedrus, and Scott suggests that Xenocrates (c.330bc) may have beeninspired to produce his version under the influence of Orphic theology.58(Xenocrates’ system in which the World-Soul receives the Forms and54Scott:1968,10955Scott:1968,11056For example DL.7.88:ὁ νόμος ὁ κοινός,ὅσπερ ἐστὶν ὁ ὀρθὸς λόγος,διὰ πάντων ἐρχόμενος,ὁαὐτὸς ὢν τῷ Διί, ‘the common law which is correct reason, pervading everything, is identical withthis Zeus.’57Kore Kosmou2858Xenocrates,Testimonia, doctrina et fragmenta216:ᾗ καὶ ενοκράτης Δία τὸν ἐν μὲν τοῖς κατὰταὐτὰ καὶ ὡσαύτως ἔχουσιν ὕπατον καλεῖ νέατον δὲ τὸν ὑπὸ σελήνην, ‘and Xenocrates calls theuppermost Zeus . . . and the lowest that below the moon’.

Firstly, the Stoics did not positthe existence of incorporeal beings, while the author of our treatise postu-lates two classes of gods, with theousiarchsasνοητοὶ θεοί. The Hermeticscheme also postulates a supracosmic god in addition to the cosmic godfound in Stoicism.TheDe Mysteriis 8.2contains a summary of a theological system whichhas pretensions to be from Egyptian sacred writings, but which is morelikely from a more recent Neoplatonist interpretation of the ‘Books ofThoth’.60The author calls the First God of the system (theἓνof Plotinus)νοητάρχης,astheἀρχήofτὰ νοητάand the Second God (Plotinianνοῦς),αὐτάρχηςas the cause of himself, as well asοὐσιοπάτωρin his role asἀρχὴ τῆς οὐσίας, the Demiurge of the sensible world. The system of theDe Mysteriiscontains sufficient significant differences from that of theAsclepiusfor it to be unlikely that either system was derived from the other.However, the similarity of terminology leads one to believe that they weremodelled on an earlier system using the termousiarch.61Scott’s hypothesis concerning the origin of this system is that Posido-nius’ list of departmental gods (first centurybc) was reproduced, withmodifications, by the Egyptian Stoic Chaeremon (c.50ad), who may haveintroduced the Decani and the termοὐσιάρχης. In Stoic terminology, andthat of Posidonius,οὐσίαis synonymous withὕλη. It seems, therefore, thattheousiarchsof theAsclepiusare the overseers of material substance: fire,air, earth and water.All the various entities in the ontological system are interconnected intoa harmonious whole: ‘mortals are attached to immortals and sensibles tosensibles’.62The contradiction between the monotheistic stance adoptedat the commencement of the treatise and the postulated existence of manygods is reconciled: ‘the whole of it complies with the supreme governor, theγῆς φυτοσπόρον Δήμητρα.ταῦτα δὲ χορηγήσας τοῖς Στωικοῖς κ.τ.λ., ‘and he expresses the opinionthat there are divine powers and that they are pervaded by material elements. And of these he callsthe formless power active in the air Hera, and that active in moisture Poseidon and that active inthe plant-bearing earth Demeter; and, in this, he followed the lead of the Stoics.’ The Orphic versesthat may have influenced Xenocrates can be found in Stob.i.I.23,vol.I,p.29W. :Ζεὺς πρῶτοςγένετο,Ζεὺς ὕστατος ἀργικέραυνος,Ζεὺς κεφαλή,Ζεὺς μέσσα,Διὸς δ’ἐκ πάντα τέτυκται·,‘Zeuswas born first, Zeus the last with vivid lightning, Zeus the head, Zeus the middle, and from Zeusall things are born.’ Dillon suggests that Aetius was attempting ‘to make sense of an already garbledtext’.

All the lesser deities are reallyjust the result of the volition of the supreme god.Having examined the hierarchy of deities, it now remains to considerspirit, as the mechanism by which these deities act upon matter (§16–17):Spirit supplies and animates everything in the world, just like an instrumentor mechanism, it is subjected to the will of the highest god. This is a sufficientlevel of understanding for us for the present. Understood by mind alone,the god who is called the highest is the ruler and governor of that sensiblegod, who embraces within himself all place, all substance of things and thewhole matter of things that generates and creates and every sort of qualityand quantity. Indeed Spirit rouses and governs all kinds in the world, andeach in accordance with the nature which has been allotted to it by God.Hyl ̄e or matter is the Receptacle of all things and agitates and concetratesthem and God is their governor. And he apportions to all things in theworld as much as is necessary for each one of them. He fills everything withhis spirit, breathing into each one in accordance with its natural quality.Spirit is the mechanism by which the First Principle acts on matter. §17reit-erates Plato’s standpoint in theTimaeusthat the sensible cosmos occupiesthe Receptacle and uses up all available matter.Agitatio atque frequentatio,‘agitation and concentration’ denotes a much more active agent than matterwhich passively, as areceptaculum, ‘receives’ the Forms. Spirit plays somerole in the nourishment of soul – perhaps by allowing it to communicatewith entities higher up on the ontological scale, since it is the instrumentof the supreme God.64After making the gods, God uses a mixture of ‘the more corrupt part ofmatter’ and of the divine to make man. The account of the generation ofMan parallels thePoimandres, where even though Man is produced afterthe heavenly gods, he is the one whom God loves most. Just as there heis better than the Governors, the same situation is observable here: ‘foramong all living things God recognized mankind by the unique reason andlearning through which humans could banish and spurn the vices of bodiesand he made them reach for immortality as the hope and intention’.65However, what is most interesting here is the description of Necessity asthe generation of the First Principle in order to control the lesser deities. Itis described as an order framed in law to prevent the gods from becomingdetached from learning and understanding and plays no role in limitingthe scope of the Demiurge’s production. However, it seems that in the63Asclepius1964Asclepius1865Asclepius19"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"202Speculations in HermetismAsclepius, the role played by Necessity in theTimaeusis taken over byHeimarmen ̄e.66This is defined as ‘the necessity in all events’ and it collab-orates with Necessity.Heimarmen ̄ebegins everything and Necessity forcesthese productions into activity, thereby producing order.67Interestingly,Heimarmen ̄eis a creation of the Demiurge, not an opposed evil or recal-citrant principle.Heimarmen ̄emust be equivalent to the Fate regarded asoriginating from the circles of the Governors elsewhere in the Hermeticcorpus, though the author of theAsclepiusis not so specific. It seemssomewhat akin to a separate entity which assists the Demiurge in world-generation, using order and necessity. These three principlesHeimarmen ̄e,Necessity and Order, resemble Xenocrates’ triad of Fates.68Heimarmen ̄eand Necessity are agents of the Demiurge who assist him in the generationof the cosmos and are completely under his control.Heimarmen ̄eseems tobe the entity that acts on matter, sowing the seed of generation (perhapseven soul) into it. Necessity is the divine plan which seems to compelmatter into subjection. This vitiates the image hinted at early on, wherematter seemed to respond itself to the generative impulse. Their activity iscircular, so that it is impossible to observe the beginning of their activity,which hints at continual temporal generation – just as in theStatesmanmyth disorder creeps into the world at regular intervals and God has tointervene.In fact, §26outlines this possibility, during the old age of the world, when‘the god whose power is primary and governor of the First God’willrestorethe world to its original state, destroying vice by flood, fire or disease. Theitalicised quote is problematic. The Latin readsdeus primipotens et uniusgubernator dei.Gubernatoris the Latin translation of the Greekδημιουργός.The problem is that the text does not explain what the Demiurge is firstin relation to.

Otherwise, the text must be corrupt.The general sense of this passage at first reading appears to be one ofcontinual temporal generation. The Demiurge has to re-order the worldas disorder starts to creep in over the course of time. However, I thinkthat this is one occasion when the text has to be read both with an eye tothe Hermetic tradition and to that of Greek philosophy. In the Hermeticcorpus there are frequent references to the coming neglect of the ancientEgyptian religion and the subsequent desertion of Egypt by the traditionalgods. This was interpreted by Christian readers as a pagan prediction ofthe future fall of their religion, but is probably due to tension felt byEgyptians of the period when confronted with Hellenic culture, which wasincreasingly becoming dominant in the region. A hint that this is whatthe author had in mind can be found in the reference to irreverence anddisregard of the good which will soon take over the world.PlacingHeimarmen ̄eand Necessity under the authority of the supremeGod leaves the author of theAsclepiuswith a problem: how to account forevil in the world. At §40, he notes that accident and chance are mixed inwith everything material. However, theAsclepiusadopts the response of amanual for spiritual progress and not that of a metaphysical treatise. Theauthor makes little effort to explain the origin of evil, instead stressing thefact that the Demiurge did what he could to protect humanity against evilby endowing it with enough intelligence to avoid its effects.70Clearly, it is problematic to state that nothing in the world can come intobeing that is not pleasing to God and then subsequently to state that evilis an inherent part of the world, but God cannot really be held responsiblefor its existence. Evil must originate from somewhere and quite clearly atthis point it is useful to place the blame on the philosopher’s favouritescapegoat, matter: ‘Just as there is a fertile quality in the nature of matter,so also is the same matter equally fertile in malice’ (§15). Here the standardanti-materialistic stance of Hermetic literature creeps in. Since matter isnot the production of the Demiurge, as is explicitly stated in §15andelsewhere in theAsclepius, this absolves him neatly from responsibility forthe existence of evil. In spite of the anti-material strain observable here, theauthor’s attitude remains somewhat ambivalent: matter is still fertile andproductive.69Copenhaver:1992,243–470Asclepius16"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"204Speculations in HermetismConclusionApart from thePoimandresand theAsclepius,theCorpus Hermeticumcan,in general, be viewed as a sort of ‘school-level’ philosophy. It does notprovide a particularly sophisticated account of demiurgy. However, it doesoffer interesting insights into the perceptions of the Platonically-influencedunderworld. The texts are often contradictory, since they cater to initiates atdifferent stages of their spiritual progress. One can distinguish two separatetrends, although I am reluctant to divide the texts into separate categories.Firstly, there are texts such as thePoimandresand theAsclepiuswith a muchmore sophisticated version of demiurgic causality, which see the need fora generative entity distinct from, even if dependent upon, the supremeprinciple. The other texts tend to stress the unity of world-generation andregard all the other generative entities merely as agents, or better yet, astools of the supreme God.The more pro-cosmic treatises can probably be regarded as intendedfor earlier on in the initiate’s career. The basic version that emerges fromtheir more sophisticated counterparts is of a First Principle, which mustbe regarded as the efficient cause of world-generation. He does not alwaysemploy a Demiurge (his son) to generate on his behalf, and in such cases herelies on a team of secondary, generative entities formed from all the usualsuspects: Providence, Necessity, Fate and Eternity. There is no notion thatthese act independently of his volition and so they must accomplish theirtasks with his approbation.Indeed, world-generation itself is not really a mistake; the problem isthat Man became enmattered, and texts such as thePoimandresdo notfully explain why the omniscient and omnipotent First Principle shouldallow the fall of a hypostasis. By submitting Necessity and the Demiurge tothe control of the First Principle, one is left only with the recalcitrance ofmatter as an explanation for the existence of evil in the material world. Thisis not utilised very much by the Hermetic authors, and in thePoimandresit is clear that the dissolution of the godhead begins with the emanationof Man, for which God would have to bear full responsibility. In theHermetic corpus, we are no longer dealing with the abstract entities ofGreek philosophy, but with emotional characters in the drama of world-generation; a transformation which affects even the supreme god. This hasto be the favoured explanation for elucidating demiurgic causality in theHermetic tradition, rather than a philosophical one."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"chapter 8The ignorant DemiurgeValentinus and the GnosticsIntroductionI am aware of the current trend, particularly in North American schol-arship, to question the utility of a term such as Gnosticism. Gnosticism,after all, consisted of numerous divergent sects, which could also claimto belong to the Christian church. Such sects should therefore not beregarded as heretical, but rather heterodox. In any case, heterodox beliefwas widespread and also tolerated in early Christianity. Indeed, it was quitenormal for divergent beliefs to exist amongst early Christian groups andonly became problematic with the attempt to develop an ‘orthodox’ fate.1These are all valid points, but an analysis of this phenomenon in termsof religious history falls outside the scope of my study. ‘Gnosticism’ isstill a convenient ‘label’ to represent an anti-cosmic tradition in which thePlatonic Demiurge undergoes a radical transformation and in which theseparation between the First Principle and the demiurgic one appears toreach its most extreme. Admittedly, it is difficult to see anything in theTimaeustext which could have led to the ignorant Gnostic Demiurge.Since the Timaean Demiurge cannot overcome Necessity completely, inorder to produce a more rationally ordered cosmos, this may have led to aless positive appraisal of his role. The Gnostic Demiurge, though, proba-bly owes more to the prevailing intellectual-religious trend among certaingroups receiving the text than it does to anything indicated in the dialogueitself.One might argue that the term ‘Demiurge’ has been applied to a dif-ferent sort of entity from the generative one of theTimaeusand its onlyPlatonic legacy is that of titular appropriation. Against this, one can setthe following considerations: (1) The recalcitrance of matter, as mentionedin theTimaeus, has developed into a claim that the entire material world1For discussions of how Gnosticism should be categorised, see Turner:1992, or Brakke:2010, esp.4–5.Smith:1980and King:2005resist the use of Gnosticism as a category.205"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"206Valentinus and the Gnosticsis fundamentally evil. (2) The Demiurge, in some versions of the Gnosticmyth, actually does produce a world in imitation of the higher realities ofwhich he is ignorant (due to the intervention of Sophia). I would contendthat this has originated to some extent from the notion of the Demiurgemodelling the world upon the Forms. (3) The Young Gods of theTimaeusare paralleled in the host of entities (such as Archons) which assist theDemiurge during the act of world-generation (although the original jus-tification, that they produce the mortal element in humanity, finds noplace in this myth, where the Demiurge himself is responsible for what isblameworthy in the material realm). (4) The descending ontological rankof the demiurgic principle can be observed even in monotheistic thinkers,such as Philo and Origen. The low-ranking Gnostic Demiurge is part ofthis tradition.Gnosticism can be seen as an extreme evolution of the concept of theDemiurge. The attempt to insulate him from the contamination of mat-ter and responsibility for the production of evil leads, via the distinctionbetween two complementary powers championed by Numenius, to theview that these two entities are antagonistic, in order to account for theinherent imperfection of the world. This may be observed in the paralleldevelopment in mainstream philosophy, whereby terms such as ‘begottenof himself ’ were applied increasingly by pagan philosophers to a divinemediator, rather than the supreme principle.2Porphyry refers toNous,the Neoplatonic second principle asautogennˆetosandautopatˆor.3In thesethinkers, we have the notion that it is somehow beneath the dignity of theFirst Principle to move or beget (perhaps related to Epicurean criticismof Plato,cf.Cicero,ND1). P ́etrement observes this idea in Numenius,although Logan claims that this cannot be proved to have existed in phi-losophy prior to its adoption by the Barbelognostics. Even in Philo, weencounter the position that the universe is inherently evil; for example atSomn.ii.253, although he generally advances the view that the world, asthe creation of a beneficent and omnipotent God, is good.Many elements of Gnosticism are explained by Christian hostility toJudaism, and hence this distinction between the true God (the Father ofChrist) and the Demiurge (Yahweh), influenced by philosophical specula-tion emphasising the separation between the First Principle and a secondary2Logan:1996,803Porphyry,Historia PhilosophiaeFrag.223Smith:προῆλθε δὲ προαιώνιος ἀπ’αἰτίου τοῦ θεοῦὡρμημένος.αὐτογέννητος ὢν καὶ αὐτοπάτωρ, ‘it proceeds before time, rushing forth from God,its cause, since it is self-generated and self-engendered’."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Introduction207demiurgic figure. However, it is possible to trace its origins as a develop-ment of dissident Judaism.The Tripartite Treatise(112,33–113,1) claims thatGod did not create alone, but with the assistance or through the agencyof angels. This is not heretical and is found in Rabbinical doctrine. Theview found justification in the Septuagint’s statementποιήσωμεν ἄνθρω-πον: ‘Let us make Man.’ Philo maintained this position, although he mayhave been regarded as heterodox (Christians preserved his works). Philoregarded this as referring to the planetary gods (pure souls/angels). Thedoctrine is related to an attitude that denigrated the value of the humanbody. According to Justin, heretical Jews claimed that the human body wascreated by angels (Dialogue62).4This view, as well as the attendant beliefthat the human body was unworthy of creation by God, can be traced backto Plato’s position on the demiurgic role of the Young Gods atTim.41.A major problem in studying Gnosticism is the biased nature of thesources. When Irenaeus refers to their ‘wisdom’, he adds ‘falsely so-called’.He attacks their unity: their opinions are inconsistent (Adv. Haer.i.11),they dispute amongst themselves (Adv. Haer.i.12), they are inspired byevil spirits (Adv. Haer.i.9.5) and their Biblical exegesis is described as akinto breaking up a mosaic of a king to construct one of a fox or dog (Adv.Haer.i.8.1).5Nor does Irenaeus stop there; he attacks the morality of theGnostics: they not only associate with idolators and attend gladiatorialshows, but are even sexually promiscuous (Adv. Haer.i.6.3f.).6Irenaeusparodies the tendency of Gnosticism to multiply the chain of Being throughthe postulation of entities, Aeons, syzygies and angels with names such as‘Abyss’, ‘Silence’ and ‘Limit’. AtAdv. Haeri.11.14, in a satire of the Gnosticcreation myth, he describes the emanation of Valentinian melons from theprimeval beings, Gourd and Utter-Emptiness.Hostility to the Gnostics was not limited to the Church Fathers andheresiologists. Plotinus comments on acquaintances who ‘chanced to comeupon this way of thinking before becoming our friends and I do not knowhow they manage to continue upon it’.7Plotinus composed a treatiseAgainst the Gnostics(Enn.ii9[33]) and frequently criticised Gnostic view-points.8Plotinus’ main objection seems to be the number of levels ofBeing in the Gnostic systems, as well as their world-negating stance.9Hehimself posited only three levels of Being: the One, Nous and Soul. Such4Petr ́ement:1991,415Perkins:1976,1966Perkins:1976,1957Enn.ii9[33]108According to Porphyry,Vita Plotini16.9‘And through naming a multitude of intelligibles, they suppose that they have found the very truth,but by means of this multiplicity, they turn intelligible nature into the likeness of the sensible andinferior world.’ (Plotinus,Enn.ii9[33]6.29–31)."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"208Valentinus and the Gnosticsphilosophical opposition to Gnosticism is illustrated by Van den Broek’scomment that ‘Gnosticism is not even a depraved form of philosophy. Itis something quite different, though the Gnostic writers often make use ofphilosophical ideas.’10As Filoramo comments, the Gnostic Demiurge is always problematic andnever a venerable figure.11This difficulty can mask some of the obviousdifferences in his role in various sects. He is central to Valentinian andSethian systems, but possibly absent in the systems of Menander andSaturninus. He lacks a primary role in the triadic systems, of which ourevidence derives from Pseudo-Hippolytus.12For Ptolemy, the Demiurgewas merely the ignorant creator of the seven heavens:They say that the Demiurge thought that he had constructed all of thishimself, but he had made it as a result of Acham ̄oth directing his course. Forhe made heaven without knowing Heaven and he moulded man althoughignorant of Man and without knowing the Earth, he brought it to light.And they say that in each case he did not know the Forms (of the things)which he made, or even his own mother, and he thought that he alone waseverything. (Adv. Haer.i.5.3)However, this neutral position becomes more ambivalent and even overtlyhostile in other sects.The origins of Valentinian GnosticismGnostic motifs can be traced in mainstream philosophy, particularly in thelanguage and imagery of Stoicism. For example, Zeno claims:God and Mind and Destiny and Zeus are one and he was also called by manyother names. Therefore, in the beginning, being by himself, he transformedall substance through air into water, and just as sperm is contained in theengendering fluid, so too was thespermatikos logosof the cosmos and thisremains behind in the moisture and makes matter serviceable to himself,for the generation of the remaining things. And first he generated the fourelements. (SVF1.102f=DLvii.135)We also have a further metaphor from the Stoics, portraying world-generation in sexual terms:Zeus, remembering Aphrodite and genesis, softened himself and havingquenched much of his light, transformed (it) into fiery air of less intensivefire. Then, having had intercourse with Hera he ejected the entire seminal10Va n d e n Br o e k :1998a,411Filoramo:1990,218n.2012Filoramo:1990,77"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The origins of Valentinian Gnosticism209fluid of the All. Thus he made the whole substance wet, one seed of the All;he himself running through it, just like the forming and fashioning spirit inseminal fluid. (SVF2.622)Imagery exploited by the Gnostics is clearly exhibited by this passage – notjust the sexual imagery but also the role played by moisture in creation.Here, Hera does not actually provide anything towards the creation; shemerely causes the fluid to be released.The Stoic doctrine of natural place with the various elements separatingof their own accord also echoes the transgression of Sophia:They fled and turned away from each other and they endured unusual andstubborn impulses since they were in a state in which, according to Plato(Tim.53b), all things which do not have God are, just like bodies that donot have mind and soul, until what was longed for came to nature outof Providence, when affection and Aphrodite and Eros were generated, asEmpedocles and Parmenides and Hesiod say. (Plut.,De facie in orbe lunae926f–927a)This is similar to the imagery of the Sophia myth, and in a way it is Sophia’sinability or rather unwillingness to accept her natural place that is the causeof all the trouble. It should be noted that any similarity between Stoicismand Gnosticism is unlikely to be the result of any direct connection betweenthe two, since apart from Basilides, Gnostic thinkers’ contact with Greekphilosophy was limited to either Pythagoreanism or Platonism.The Stoics’ viewpoint is shared to a certain degree by Philo, anotherimportant figure in tracing the development of Valentinian gnosis. Eventhough Plato had envisaged God as dealing with the world through inter-mediaries, illustrated by the Demiurge’s relationship to the created realmthrough the Young Gods of theTimaeus, it was Philo who managed toharmonise such a conception with a staunch monotheistic viewpoint. ForPhilo such intermediaries could be equated with the angels. However, Godcouldalsodealwiththeworldthroughapredominanthypostasis,suchastheLogos, who could also be personified as a Servant of God (or the Son,as exemplified in the Christian tradition by Origen).Another hypostasis, Ruach Jahweh, is not easily translated from Hebrewinto Greek byπνεῦμα.SinceLogosand Sophia do not share the same genderin Greek, it is difficult for Philo to present them as synonymous. Philo’sLogosis to some extent the ancestor of Valentinus’ Horos. AtAbr.143,itisnot God but his subordinates who punish Sodom, and create human freewill;13just as it is theLogos-Cutter which handles matter (Spec.i.329).

Similarly, Horos maintains discipline within the Pleromaand separates the primary Dyad from the lesser Aeons, which it wouldbe beneath the dignity of the First Principle to do. The name Horos is asuitable one, since it also refers to the boundary separating the Pleromafrom Sophia and the generated world.As Stead points out, various traces of Philo’s conceptions of Sophia couldhave given rise to Gnostic themes, particularly the notion of Sophia as themother of all, as well as the idea of a fallen Sophia.14The interesting ques-tion to pose is why these two elements should have entered the Valentiniantradition, rather than others. Sophia is generally thought to be the originalrepresentation of God’s primary agency, with theLogosbeing posited subse-quently. This is because of the obvious advantage that if Sophia is posited asGod’s consort, it explains where theLogoscame from, if it is claimed as theson of these two, whereas if theLogosemerges first, as a masculine entity,it cannot be claimed to be the consort of the Father, and the relationshipbetween the three entities cannot be explained in human terms. Even Philorefers to Sophia as God’s consort.15It is this sort of concept that Irenaeusattacks ati.30.2ff, when he comments on the notion that the Father is theFirst Man, the Son the Second Man, and the Holy Spirit the First Womanwith whom both have intercourse to generate the created universe. Such aconsideration explains the pivotal role Sophia plays in the creation mythof Valentinianism, despite her significant ontological demotion.The notion of an Oriental mother-goddess, such as Isis, has been graftedonto Sophia, as have Pythagorean speculations concerning the Dyad as thefirst ‘feminine’ number and therefore as the mother of plurality. Xenocratesdescribes this concept at Heinze Fr.15, describing the Dyad as the motherof the gods and the soul of the universe. Armstrong proposes that theorigins of Gnosticism may be found amongst those forcibly Judaised byJohn Hyrcanus and Aristobulus during the second centurybc,suchastheIdumaeans, Ituraeans or Peraeans, although he notes that this is merelyspeculation.16There is no need to go to such exotic lengths to find theorigins of an anti-Judaic Gnosticism, since it could have originated within14Stead:1969,9715ἦν γὰρ ἀναγκαῖον τῆς μητρὸς καὶ τιθήνης τῶν ὅλων πάνθ’ὅσα εἰς γένεσιν ἦλθεν εἶναι νεώτερα.‘For it was necessary that all the things which pertain to generation are younger than the motherand nurse of the whole’,Ebr.31.16Armstrong:1978,92n.7"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The life and works of Valentinus211Christianity and Pythagorean or Platonic accounts of demiurgy conve-niently provided the framework for the Gnostic myth.The life and works of ValentinusValentinus (adc.100–175) was born at Phrebonis in the Egyptian Delta.He received a Greek education at Alexandria, where he may have methis contemporary, Basilides. This helps to explain the curious amalgam ofPlatonic philosophy and Gnostic mythology that he exhibits in his writings.He later taught at Rome, but is said to have left the city after Anicetus (154–165) was elected bishop instead of him. This reveals the extent to which hecould have claimed to be part of the mother church. One theological workOn the Three Natureshas been attributed to him, which deals with thethree hypostases and persons (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) of the Trinity.TheTripartite Tractate(NHC15) is unrelated, although it probably hasa Valentinian (c.150–180) provenance. Additionally, theGospel of Truth(NHC13) has been attributed to Valentinus, though without adequatejustification. In spite of the name, this ‘gospel’ is really a homily. Otherattributed texts include theGospel of Philipand theLetter to Rheginos(NHC113,1,4, xi,2).It is difficult to distinguish an ‘original’ Valentinian doctrine. In anycase, much useful work in this area has been accomplished by Stead andQuispel.17Each disciple seems to have made his own alterations; an accept-able procedure within the liberal environment of Valentinianism. A greatpreoccupation of research in this area has been a comparative study of thevarious Valentinian ‘schools’, with the admittedly logical view that the low-est common denominator must be Valentinus’ original teaching. For thepurposes of my examination, I shall treat Valentinianism as a single unit,incorporating all the various strands, as well as whatever may have originallybeen the position of Valentinus himself, but concentrating more on thesystem in its entirety, than on the contributions of any single individual.Valentinus’ followers claimed that he had an apostolic accreditation forteaching, since it was asserted that he had been instructed by Theudas, adisciple of St Paul.18LaytonvFr.

And the babeanswered him saying that it was the Word. Thereupon, he adds to this acertain pompous tale, intended to derive from this his attempt at a “sect”.’17Quispel:195118Layton:1987,21719vFr.

Whatever the reality of the situation, it does stress that the Valen-tinians did not see themselves as a schismatic group, however they may havebeen viewed by others, and expressly attempted to legitimise themselves interms of the mother church.What P ́etrement refers to as the Valentinian turning-point,20the attemptby Valentinians to reduce the distance between Christianity and Gnosti-cism, is also an attempt by some Christians to raise their own theology tothe same academic level as that of pagan philosophical systems with whichthey were familiar. The Valentinians originally seem to have been a sectwithin the church, rather than a separate group (heterodox rather thanheretic), although in692ad, we learn from Canon95passed at the Trul-lan Synod which dealt with the treatment repentant Valentinians shouldreceive from the Catholic Church, that the sect still persisted.The Valentinians consciously attempted to link themselves with the‘mother church’, as well as mainstream Greek philosophy, as can be seenfrom this fragment, fortuitously preserved by Clement of Alexandria,Mis-cellanies(Stromateis)6.52–3(vol.2,458,11–16St ̈ahlin):Much of what has been written in the books available to the public isfound in the writings in the Church of God.

G=OnFriends – V ̈olker Frag6)The publicly available books are the non-Christian works of Greek philoso-phers. Like Philo and others before them, the Valentinians sought to rec-oncile the truth they perceived in mainstream philosophy with their ownreligious beliefs by claiming that earlier intellectuals whose beliefs agreedin whole or in part with their own were inspired by God.Given the fragmentary remains of writings that may be attributable toValentinus, it can be easy to underestimate the extent of their influence onthe Christian intellectual tradition, a fact attested by the hostility whichthey managed to evoke in the Church Fathers. In229, for example, Origentravelled to Athens to debate with Candidus, an influential Valentinian.21There is evidence of their survival into the fourth century, as we hear offeuds between the Arians and Valentinians of Syrian Edessa during thereign of the Emperor Julian (361–363), while during that of Theodosiusi(379–395), a Valentinian Church was destroyed by monks at Callinicum20P ́etrement:1991,370–821Rudolph:1983,325"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The life and works of Valentinus213on the upper Euphrates.22Interestingly, this is one of the few references wehave for specifically Valentinian worship and indicates their relationshipto the ‘mother church’ of the period. Unfortunately, no archaeological sitehas been definitively identified as a Valentinian building. Layton raises thepossibility that the sect survived into the fifth century, with its membersin hiding; although Valentinus’ disciples come towards the end of theinnovative period of western Gnosticism. They may have seen themselvesnot as a religion in competition with Christianity, but rather a sect offeringa particular interpretation of its teaching.23The Valentinians’ most distinctive doctrine was their myth of Sophia.Their teachings can be grouped into two branches: Italic and Oriental,both of which varied the myth. The main source is IrenaeusAdv. Haer.i.11.1, although Irenaeus is not concerned with producing a comprehen-sive account, but with merely highlighting some differences between theposition of Valentinus and that of the main body of the Gnostics. Laytonbreaks the entire saga down into four ‘acts’, which are the sections relat-ing to the Demiurge proper: the generation of the spiritual and materialrealms, the production of humans, which Irenaeus does not include in hisaccount, and the Christian-soteriological section outlining the role of theHoly Spirit and Jesus.Despite the lack of acceptance by many scholars of P ́etrement’s Valen-tinian ‘turning-point’, it does point to the problems surrounding Valenti-nus’ position within Gnosticism. Irenaeus is deliberately confusing in hisapplication of the term ‘Gnostic’ and the Western Church Fathers tendedto follow him in his inexactitude. Secondly, in the Eastern Church, theterm had more favourable connotations than in its Western counterpart.The Valentinians, however, are the first sect to be mentioned by Irenaeusin connection with the term ‘Gnostic’.24That the term ‘Gnostic’ was con-ventionally used is indicated by Irenaeus’ use ofλεγομένης,althoughheprovides no evidence for when or by whom this name was first utilised.Irenaeus associates Valentinus with the Gnostics here for his own par-ticular reasons. He accuses the Valentinians of plagiarism with the lineλεγομένης γνωστικῆς αἱρέσεως, but at the same time claims that they havebeen excessively original:ἴδιος χαρακτήρ. The Gnostics lack originality;22Rudolph:1983,32523This is in spite of the fact that according to theGospel of Philip, they celebrated additional sacraments.24ὁ μὲν γὰρ πρῶτος,ἀπὸ τῆς λεγομένης Γνωστικῆς αἱρέσεως τὰς ἀρχὰς εἰς ἴδιον χαρακτῆραδιδασκαλείου μεθαρμόσας Οὐαλεντῖνος. . . ‘For Valentinus was first of the so-called Gnostic sectto correct the principles of his own school’(Adv.

Irenaeus was aware that Valentinuscould differ from mainstream Gnostic thought on important matters. Forexample:De ea autem quae est ex his, secunda emissione Hominis et Eccle-siae, ipsi patres eorum, falso cognominati Gnostici, pugnant adversusinvicem . . . aptabile esse magis emissioni dicentes, uti verisimile, ex HomineVerbum, sed non ex Verbo Hominem emissum . . .Once again, concerning the second (generation) which is emitted from these[Aeons], that of Man and Church, their fathers themselves, falsely called theGnostics(i.e.theknowingones),fightamongstthemselves...,sayingthatit is more suitable to the theory of emission, as being similar to the truth,that the Word was emitted out of Man, and not Man out of the Word. (Adv.Haer.ii.13.10)‘Gnostic’ for Irenaeus denotes a group of diverse heterodox beliefs, con-nected by their claim of a falsegn ̄osis.26Valentinus himself seems to haveavoided use of the term ‘Gnostic’. The epithets they applied to themselveswere traditionally used by members of the early Church; for example ‘peo-ple endowed with spirit’, ‘spirituals’ (=πνευματικοί,iCo2:15)and‘theperfect’ (=τέλειοι).27The term ‘Valentinians’ emerges c.160ad, coinedby opponents in critical pamphlets, in order to imply that this group werefollowers of Valentinus, rather than of Christ. According to Epiphanius,the Valentinians referred to themselves as ‘Gnostics’.28However, Epipha-nius cannot be viewed as a reliable authority in this case, given his need tomaintain eighty sectarian titles in order to allude to the eighty concubinesin theSong of Songs.Although Gnosticism seems to be generally presented in classical scholar-ship, or for that matter in philosophy and theology, as a ‘fringe movement’,Valentinianism was too important to ignore for figures such as Clement ofAlexandria or Origen. In this we are fortunate, since it provides us with asource of information; as opposed to the situation regarding Gnosticismwithin Judaism. The rabbis had a much more effective way of dealingwith heretics; by simply ignoring them, the details of the heresy would notspread−quite correctly, as it turns out.25...ἀριστερὸν ῍Αρχοντα ἐδογμάτισεν ὁμοίως τοῖς ῥηθησομένοις ὑφ’ἡμῶν ψευδωνύμοις Γνωστικοῖς,‘And he [i.e. Valentinus] had a doctrine of a left-sided Archon; in this he agreed with the falsely-calledGnostics about whom we have been speaking.’(Adv.

The original Greek version for the first part of Bookiwas preservedby Epiphanius’Haer.31, although the complete Latin version survives.The work also survives in Armenian and Syriac. It is generally thought toexpound the doctrines of the founder of the Italian branch, Ptolemaeus. Itwas composed over a lengthy period; Rudolph suggests during the reign ofthe Emperor Commodus (180–192).29It seems to have been written to combat the Gnostic heresy, which fromthe second half of the second century, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius,having originated in Asia Minor, began to spread towards Lyons, whereIrenaeus was consecrated bishop in177–178. It was also reported that he diedduring a persecution c.200. The ostensible motive for composing the workwas to satisfy a friend’s request for information concerning Valentiniandoctrine. Irenaeus deals with a variety of sects that fall under the termGnostic.

Irenaeus is the main source for A, while Pseudo-Hippolytusis the main source for B. However, it should be noted that elements ofversion B can be identified in Irenaeus – inii.3andii.4.31The Valentiniansystem posits a plethora of entities between the First Principle and theDemiurge (seeFig.8.1), although in comparison with the Basilidean system,where the material realm is fabricated by the three hundred and sixty-fifth generation of angels, it could be viewed as rather restrained. Thesehypostases, which represent modes of God, are paired into syzygies and thengrouped together into larger formations, which could be viewed as families.First comes the Primal Ogdoad32(Abyss=Silence/Thought, Intellect=Tr u t h , t h e Wo r d=Life, Human Being=Church).33Word and Life thenemanate a second group of ten Aeons (the Deep-Sunken=Intercourse,the Unaging=Union, the Self-Produced=Pleasure, the Motionless=Mixture, the only-Begotten=Blessed). The Twelve Aeons are emanatedfrom Human Being and the Church (the Intercessor=Faith, the Fatherly=Hope, the Motherly=Love, the Ever-Flowing=Intelligence, theEcclesiastical=Blessedness, Theletos (the Desired)=Sophia).Such a system can be seen as an attempt to convey the various concep-tions of God without compromising the simplicity of the First Principle.However, unlike Origen who locates them all within his Christ-Logosandthereby dispenses with the need for numerous hypostases, the Valentiniansare able to adopt this approach since a fragmented godhead is one of thecornerstones of their theology. Even though they posit such an elaboratesystem, it fails to work even within the terms which the Valentinians setthemselves, or perhaps it would be fairer to say that while it is possible thatsuch a system might function within a mythic framework, when testedwith the touchstone of metaphysics, it feels as though the entire structurebegins to break down.30The so-calledSummer Harvest.31Stead:1969,78outlines the extent of the influence of version B on Irenaeus’ account.32I use the equals sign to indicate the consort of the male hypostasis which appears on the left.33This is only in version A (Irenaeus); in version B (Pseudo-Hippolytus), there is no primal octet."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Valentinian myth of Sophia217Primal OgdoadFig.8.1The Valentinian myth of Sophia"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"218Valentinus and the GnosticsFig.8.1(cont.)Leaving aside the question of whether the First Principle should be abovethe law of the syzygy, there is the question of how these various groupsrelate to one another.

However, he"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Valentinian myth of Sophia219can only be the third-highest ranking aeon, since Silence and Abyss comefirst. Indeed Abyss is referred to as prior source.This is perhaps a throwback to the persistent attempts within philosophyto outdo Plato by going back further than him in attempting to uncoverthe origin of the universe, and describing the First Principle as Forefatheror Pre-First Principle. Abyss is described as prior source. It is problematicin a ‘Christian’ document for Christ to not be emanated directly from theFirst Principle. It is also unclear how the Holy Spirit is generated, thoughit seems to be floating around in the Pleroma, and given Origen’s system,it does not seem to have been unusual to have assigned it no metaphysicalrole at all. It is also unclear how, when or by whom Horos is produced,although since he separates the primary Dyad from Intellect, there aregood grounds for assuming that it is emanated fairly early on. In analysingthis system, the hypostases which are actually of importance are the FirstPrinciple and Sophia.The Valentinian First Principle is described in negative terms – it islocated ‘within indivisible and unnameable heights, where there was –they say – a pre-existent, perfect eternity; this they call also prior source,ancestor and Abyss. And it existed uncontained, invisible, everlastingand unengendered. Within infinite eternal realms, it was in great still-ness and rest: And with it coexisted thought, which they also call lovelinessand silence.’(i.1.1)This thought is the consort of the First Principle; together they emanatethe next principle:And at some point the Abyss thought to emit from himself the Beginningof everything, and he placed this emanation, which he had decided to issueforth, just like sperm, in the womb of Silence, which existed together withhim. And she received the sperm and conceived and brought forth Mind,which was of a similar nature and equal to the one who had emitted itand which alone understood the magnitude of his father. And they call thisMind the only-begotten and Father and principle of everything. (Iren.,Adv.Haer.i.1.1)This primary divine couple is an allegory for a Dyad as the First Principle,rather than a single First Principle or two antagonistic principles. This isindicated by the statement: ‘For sometimes they claim that the father iswith a consort, Silence, and at other times that it is beyond male and female’(Iren.,Adv Haer.i.2.4). I think the Valentinian group which suggested thisformulation were attempting to adopt a more monistic stance.

For Irenaeus, however,the First Principle isὑπέραῥῥεν καὶ ὑπέρθηλυ, ‘beyond male and female’,(Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.1.3.17). In the version where the parent has no femalecounterpart, he emits a boundary which purifies Sophia and reunites herwith Theletos, but expels her unlawful passion.They say that the forefather was only known by the only-begotten, whichwas generated from him, that is by Mind and to the others he remainsinvisible and unreachable. According to them, Mind alone delighted incontemplating the father and glorified in comprehending its immeasurablemagnitude, And he decided to communicate to the other Aeons the magni-tude of the father and how great he was and that he was without a beginningand uncontained and impossible to see. But by the will of the father, Silencerestrained him on account of the father’s wish to lead them up to thoughtand to the desire to seek the aforementioned forefather. (Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.2.1)This is similar to Origen’s view that only the Son knows the Father.34TheGospel of Truthexplains how the First Principle actually emanates theseentities:All the ways are his emanations. They know that they have emanated fromhim like children who were within a mature man, but knew that they hadnot yet received form nor had been given name. It is when they receive theimpulse towards acquaintance with the Father that he gives birth to each.Otherwise, although they are within him, they do not recognise him. TheFather himself is perfect and acquainted with every way that is in him. Ifhe wills, what he wills appears, as he gives it form and name. And he givesit name and causes it to make them come into existence. (GT27;trans.Layton)There is some difference in terminology between theGospel of Truthandthe version of Irenaeus, with the Aeons being referred to as ways. Bothversions also differ in the details that lead to the fall of Sophia:But Wisdom (Sophia) – the last and youngest Aeon of the twelve whichhad been emitted by the Human Being and the Church – surged forwardand underwent a passion without the union of her consort, the Desired(Theletos). The passion began in the region of Mind and Truth, but it34This parallel is brought out more forcefully at theGospel of Truth16‘that they might learn to knowhim through the power of the Word that emanated from the fullness that is in the Father’s thoughtand intellect – the Word who is spoken of as “saviour”.’ (trans.

The passion wasthe quest for the father. For, they say that she desired to comprehend hismagnitude. Then, since she was not able, since she had thrown herself intoan impossible matter, she became embroiled in great distress on account ofthe magnitude of the Deep, and the inscrutability of the father and her lovefor him. (Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.2.2)35Here it is as a result of her unacceptable desire to know the First Principlethat she transgresses (the Limit) and falls. In Pseudo-Hippolytus’ version,she attempts to imitate the Creator by producing an offspring without herconsort. Sophia is less culpable in version A, where even if she acts outof ignorance, she also acts out of love. Version B reveals her as hubristic;assuming that she is capable of emulating the creative power of the Father,and in acting above the law of the syzygy (she produces without herconsort). There is no element of jealousy in Sophia’s attempt to emulatethe Creator; similar divine beneficence can be observed in Plato’sTim.28e–29a (although there evidently in a less antagonistic or culpable context) andreminds one of the descent of Man in thePoimandresto emulate the activityof his brother, the Demiurge.Sophia is then kept out of the ineffable magnitude and turns back toherself. In version A only the guilty intention of Sophia is expelled, notSophia herself. This lower entity is forced outside the outer boundary ofthe Pleroma. (In a sense, this is the first time that the outer boundaryof the Pleroma acquires any importance, since it is the first moment inthe cosmology that an entity exists outside the fullness of the Pleroma).This lower Sophia is also known as Acham ̄oth (a garbled form of theHebrewHokhma, meaning wisdom or Sophia); a spiritual essence since itresults from the natural impulse of an aeon, but on account of her lackof comprehension, she is without form and imageless and is described asa weak and female fruit.36It is expelled from the Pleroma, like an abortedfoetus.35InThe Gospel of Truth17, the error is that of the whole Pleroma: ‘Inasmuch as the entiretyhad searched for the one from whom they had emanated, and the entirety was inside of him –the inconceivable uncontained, who is superior to all thought – ignorance of the Father causedagitation and fear. And the agitation grew dense like fog, so that no one could see. Thus error foundstrength and laboured at her matter in emptiness. Without having learned to know the truth, shetook up residence in a modelled form, preparing by means of the power, in beauty, a substitute fortruth.’ (trans. Layton)36Adv.

As a result of this equalisation all of the Aeons become intellects,Words, human beings and Christs; in other words they become ‘equal inform and intention’ (1.2.6), which indicates some sort of unification of thegodhead. It is interesting to find a demiurgical role attributed to the HolySpirit in the Christian tradition or rather quasi-Christian tradition, since inOrigenian thought it has no such function and is not even a metaphysicalprinciple. However, for Origen, it does have a soteriological role, and ifone was to be exact that is just what it is engaged upon here.TheAeonChristdescendsoutofthePleromainordertostabiliseSophia.There should really be no need for this action, as it seems to be merely aduplication of the activity of the Holy Spirit. It seems to be part of thedevelopment of the elaborate Gnostic systems, which appear to containredundant entities (perhaps as the result of the combination of Christianand philosophical entities):Then the (higher) Christ pitied her and extended himself through the crossand by means of his own power he shaped it into a form, only according toessence, but not according to knowledge (gnosis). And having accomplishedthis, he ran back up, and withdrew his power and he abandoned ‘her’so that she might perceive the passions around her, in which she was strug-gling, on account of her separation from the Pleroma and desire somethingdifferent, for she possessed a certain perfume of immortality, which hadbeen left behind for her by Christ and the Holy Spirit. (Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.4.1)The emergence of these Aeons is significant in numerous ways. Firstly,Christ and the Holy Spirit need to be written into the Gnostic myth, soto speak, in order to explain the emergence of the Christian Trinity. Itwould seem, then, that in spite of their age, they must be promoted toa senior rank in the Pleroma, just below the Father (who himself, as wehave already seen, may be only the second-ranking principle). If this event37Hypostasis of the Archons(NHCii.4,94(142),5–13: ‘Sophia (Wisdom) which is called “Pistis” wishedto create a work alone without a consort. And her work became an image of heaven, (so that) acurtain exists between the heavenly and lower regions (Aeons). And a shadow came into beingbeneath the curtain, and that shadow became matter.’ (trans. Rudolph)"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Valentinian myth of Sophia223takes place in version A, it means that the number of Aeons totals thirty-two. If one includes Jesus, that provides thirty-three Aeons; significantlythe age at which the Saviour died.38The Valentinians are displaying thesame evidence of rationality in their account of creation as Plato does intheTimaeus. However, here we are discussing the godhead, which shoulddisplay rationality; whereas the entire act of creation within Valentinianismis irrational. The role played by Christ was a Valentinian development andwas seen as a prefiguration of the soteriological role which he plays later onwhen dealing with humanity.The Pleroma’s structure also displays Pythagorean influence in bothversions. The primary Ogdoad can either be divided into two tetrads orfour pairs, both of which reveal the significance of the numbers two andfour, although all numbers up to ten in Pythagorean numerology have somesignificance. The pairing of male and female through the entire structureof the Pleroma, including the First Principle, reflects the importance ofσυζυγία(sexual union) within the Valentinian system, illustrated by theletter of Epiphanius.39Version B traces Being to a Monad which producesa Dyad. Even though this Dyad (NousandAletheia) is composed of maleand female, it is collectively female.40Version A, as Stead notes, is lessacceptable to the Jewish or Christian reader, who would raise no objectionsto claiming an ultimate Monad, but could not really agree with the claimof an ultimate Dyad.41Sophia is conscious of the wrong that she has committed and attemptsto turn around. In Pseudo-Hippolytus’ version, all of the Aeons are throwninto confusion by the transgression of Sophia. Acham ̄oth undergoes man-ifold passions because she is cut off from the Pleroma. It is these emotionsthat become matter.42This is important, since it indicates that the materialrealm is created not merely as the result of a split within the godhead, ratherthan due to the divine plan, but also as the result of a mistake perpetratedby this fragmented section of the godhead.They say that this is how the composition and essence of the matter cameabout, from which the world was assembled. For from this reversion, thewhole World-Soul and the Demiurge arose, and other things had their originfrom her fear and from her grief. For all moist essences were generated fromher tears, and bright ones from her laughter, and from her grief and shock38This total, however, disagrees with the account ati.3.oriii.1, although this may come from versionB.39Pythagoreanism also contained a series of pairs of syzygies.40κυρία καὶ ἀρχὴ καὶ μήτηρ, ‘power and principle and mother’ (Ps.-Hipp.29.6).41Stead:1969,8042Adv.

(Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.4.2)43However, every thought in the divine world, even a guilty one or one notauthorised by the supreme principle, becomes a hypostasis. As a result,expelling the thought is only the second-best option, because even theAeon Christ is unable to remove it completely:He separated (the passions) from her, but did not ignore them, for it wasimpossible to obliterate them like those of the first (Sophia), since theywere already consitituted and powerful, but instead he separated them andmixed them and stabilised them and from incorporeal passions, he changedthem into incorporeal matter. Then he supplied them with appropriatecharacteristics and with a nature, so that they might enter into compoundsand bodies, from which two essences came about, an evil one from thepassions and a passionate one from the reversion. It is on account of thisthat they say that the saviour acted with the power of a demiurge. (Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.4.5)Here Christ can be regarded as a sort of Demiurge within the divineworld, given his attempt to stabilise it and impose order upon disorder;the reference to compounds and essences reminds one of theTimaeus.Yet,strictly speaking, there should be no need for this type of ordering activitynot just within the divine world, but within the very godhead. It is anexample of the extent to which a rather commonplace philosophical motifhas been seized upon by the Gnostics and used in an unsuitable context,which quite frankly produces bizarre consequences.Jesus is the joint emanation of the entire Pleroma, their ‘commonfruit’, produced from the fullness of the Aeons, each contributing thebest that it has within itself and simultaneously producing the angels asHis bodyguard.44It seems that he supersedes Christ and Word, since heassumes these titles, despite the pre-existence of these entities. This agrees43Cf.Gospel of Truth26: ‘All the ways moved and were disturbed, for they had neither basis norstability and Error became excited, not knowing what to do [she] was troubled, mourned and criedout that she understood nothing inasmuch as acquaintance which meant the destruction of her andall the emanations had drawn near to her’ (trans. Layton). Interestingly, the author does not referto the fallen Aeon by the contradictory name of Sophia –Wisdom, but rather Error, which moreaccurately reflects her situation.44Iren.,Adv.

Jesus is seen by Sophia (σύν ὅλῃ τῇ καρποφορίᾳ αὐτου,‘withthe whole of his fruit-bearing nature’) and marries her.46It is difficult tounderstand why such a marriage is necessary, unless to ensure that she hasa consort and to parallel the restoration of the first Sophia to Theletos. Inthis context of duplication, Jesus may not be intended to supersede Christ,but to act as a second Christ, replicating the saving work of the first Christin the physical realm.Sophia then initiates world-creation:Of these three (essences) which, according to them, existed at this point,one derived from her passions, which was matter, another from her rever-sion, which was the psychic and that which she had borne, which was thepneumatic and she turned to the shaping of these essences. But she was notable to shape the pneumatic, since it was of the same sort of essence as shewas. (Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.5.1)This is important for Gnostic eschatology, since it explains the three classesof soul. Evidently, this differs greatly from Origen, who regards souls asthe same in their essence. For the Gnostics, then, individual salvationseems predetermined, having been fixed at the moment of creation. Sophiaprodues a god who is both a Demiurge and parent; drawing on the Timaeandistinction between ‘maker and father’. He is the ‘mother-father’ of the‘animates’ (i.e. Gnostics) referred to as ‘those on the right’ and craftsmanof the ‘materials’ (i.e. non-Gnostics).47This reference to the right and left seems to be an attempt to incorporatethe notion of the Cosmocrator or the left-sided ruler. In this version, thereis no real need for him, since the Demiurge is the creator of the materialrealm. The Cosmocrator is depicted as the brother of the Demiurge;48he is more evil with a ‘spiritalis malitia’, but he is also superior since heknows more concerning the higher powers than the Demiurge. In systemswhich acknowledge the Cosmocrator, the Demiurge is usually envisagedas ruling on the right-hand side; though here he appears to have jurisdic-tion on both sides: he is described as king of all (i.e. both ‘animates’ and‘materials’). The Cosmocrator seems to be a later addition to the system,only included when Valentinianism began to propound the doctrine that45Iren., Adv. Haer.i.2.646Iren.,Adv.

This subjected Man to the rule ofthe angels,50and may lie in the background of the emergence of a figure(Demiurge or Cosmocrator) ruling the world in opposition to the supremeGod.51Strangely, the Saviour acts through Acham ̄oth to make images in honourof the Aeons. She keeps the image of the invisible parent with which theDemiurge is not acquainted, while he keeps an image of the only-begottenchild and the archangels and angels retain images of other Aeons.52Thereseems to be an element of parallelism common in Gnostic myths in thispassage. The Saviour acts through Acham ̄oth, just as she acts through theDemiurge to mitigate the effects of creation. One must ask what are theimages of the Aeons that she is creating here. It would appear to be asecond Pleroma (but inferior because it is merely an image of the first).The images must be an equivalent to the Platonic Forms, so it would seemthat she is transmitting the Forms to the Demiurge to ensure that some ofthe goodness of the Pleroma is replicated in created reality.This is not unusual in Gnostic myth; what is not so commonplace is adescription of how she transmitted those images, such as we have here. It isnot the case that Acham ̄oth communicates these forms to the Demiurge inan attempt to repent of what she has done (nothing, in fact, since the faultis that of the older Sophia). Rather she performs this activity under theorders, as it were, of the Saviour. Each entity’s retention of an image seemsrelated to its ontological rank. The Demiurge’s retention of an image of theonly-begotten child (i.e. intellect) echoes his original characterisation as anintellective entity (even if in the Gnostic myths this is not so immediatelyapparent). A variant of the myth suggests that Acham ̄oth has intercoursewith the angels: ‘But Acham ̄oth (i.e. the lower Sophia), having been freedfrom her passions, took pleasure in the sight of the lights, that is the angelswho were with him (the Sot ̄er), was impregnated by them and bore fruitafter their image.’53As Acham ̄oth has been freed from passions, perhapsno sexual fault is implied here.49Romans1:2050Gal.4:3: ‘So with us, when we were children, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe.’Cf.Gal.4:9–1151P ́etrement:1991,62–3.52Iren.,Adv.

Hetends to be identified with titles given to God in the Old Testament,most frequently Ialdabaoth (probably from a Semitic rootialad‘child’ andbaoth‘chaos’, hence ‘child of chaos’).54He is also referred to as Esaldaios(=El Shaddai), Elohim, Iao, Sabaoth. As Ialdabaoth (an Ophite/Sethianappellation), he is frequently identified with Saturn and depicted as a lion.Since Yahweh’s day, the Sabbath, is celebrated on Saturn’s day, Saturday,this helps to explain how the identification took place.Ialdabaoth is the ‘father of the powers’. In some sects, he fathers sevensons, the Archons, the eldest of whom, Sabaoth, the ‘god of the powers’ isactually the Demiurge. It makes little sense, however, to have a Demiurgewhose sole metaphysical purpose is to emanate another Demiurge. In someversions Pistis Sophia and her daughter Zoe intervene to allow Sabaoth totake his father’s place. This is because he does penance when he realises hisfather’s delusion; he becomes a Christian in advance of Christianity. Thisdivision may stem from the Gnostic perception that Yahweh, God of theLaw, was the least acceptable aspect of the Old Testament God, while theGod of the prophets after Moses or the Creator (the Demiurge proper) wasmore satisfactory. The Demiurge generates the physical universe as follows:So they say he became a father and god of things outside the Pleroma,being the maker of all psychic and material things. For he separated the twocompounded essences and he made bodies out of the incorporeal and hewrought as a craftsman the heavenly and earthly and caused the material andthe psychic to come into being, Demiurge of the right and left, of the lightand the heavy, of the upward- and downward-tending. For he fabricatedseven heavens, above which is – they say – the Demiurge. On account ofthis they call him the Hebdomad (the seventh) and they call Acham ̄oth themother the Ogdoad (the eight) and she preserves the number of the primaland the first Ogdoad of the Pleroma. (Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.5.2)The reference to the seven heavens was by now standard. Each contained itsown ruling Archon (an adaptation of the Jewish archangels). However, theimportance of Sophia in terms of creation is such that in certain accountsit is she who is envisaged as physically moulding matter.55These sevenheavens are described as intellectual and as angels, while the Demiurge isan angel resembling God. Paradise is located above the third heaven andAdam is described as having ‘got something from it when he passed timewithin it’.5654P ́etrement:1991,4355Cf.Gospel of Truth17quoted above (note35).56Iren.,Adv Haer.i.5.2.Cf.i.71."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"228Valentinus and the GnosticsWhat could Adam have gotten from the fourth heaven if not some kindof gift, similar to that bestowed upon Man in thePoimandres? Clearlythis motif has remained on in the Valentinian myth, but not much is saidconcerning it because it has become redundant, since Sophia is now theentity whose fall is responsible for creation, and not Man. The Demiurgeconstructs the physical world ‘through Acham ̄oth’s act of emission’, thoughhe believes that he is generating of his own accord and he remains ignorantof his mother’s existence.57This ignorance is characteristic of the GnosticDemiurge: ‘For he made heaven without knowing Heaven and he mouldedman although ignorant of Man and without knowing the Earth, he broughtit to light.’58It is because the Demiurge is not acquainted with the ‘idealForms’ that the physical world is deficient. However, in this version theDemiurge is not to blame for his ignorance, but rather Acham ̄oth, sinceshe conspires to keep him in this state. This contrasts with the usual viewthat Sophia conspires when the Demiurge is creating Man to place a sparkof spirit in him so that Adam becomes superior to creation and a son ofthe true God. This text has been influenced by an alternative strand of thetradition, in which the spark implanted in mankind is something negative(a spark of the female sex), and so Acham ̄oth can be viewed as an almostmalevolent entity.The Valentinian Demiurge is the unconscious instrument of divine will.He is directed in the act of creation by theLogosof God. In systemsinfluenced by Valentinianism, he is ignorant, rather than evil. Yet in theApocryphon of John, Ialdabaoth’s position is motivated by jealousy of thehigher God. He safeguards his status by cheating the other Archons inwhat he apportions:He apportioned to them some of his fire, which is his own attribute andof his power, but of the pure Light of the power which he had inheritedfrom his Mother, he gave them none. For this reason he held sway overthem, because of the glory that was in him from the power of the Lightof the Mother. Therefore he let himself be called ‘the God’ renouncing thesubstance from which he had issued. And he contemplated the creationbeneath him and the angels under him, which had sprung from him, and hesaid to them ‘I am a jealous god, besides me there is none’ – thereby alreadyindicating to the angels beneath him, that there is another God: for if therewere none, of whom should he be jealous?

The term arises from the view that since God created Man inhis own image, then God can be referred to as Man. ReadingGenesisfrom aGnostic viewpoint, however, suggests that Man is the Demiurge. Saturniluschanged the Biblical text so that the Archons say ‘Let us make man in theimage and likeness’ rather than ‘in our image and likeness’. Man is createdin the image of God (Gen.1:26–7), rather than of his creator, the GnosticDemiurge. This is because Sophia or the true God tricks the Demiurge intocreating a being greater than himself by supplying the pneumatic element.It is this that is ‘alien’ to the world. Man’s superiority to the Archons whomade him is stressed also at LaytonvFr. C=V ̈olker Frag1=Clem.,Strom.2.36.2–4(133.6–16St ̈ahlin):And just as panic overcame the angels on account of the moulded form,since it uttered what was greater than its moulding on account of the one,who unseen, deposited in it a seed of the essence from above and who spokeopenly, in this way too in the races of earthly men the works of men becomeobjects of terror to the ones who made them, such as statues and images andeverything which hands make as a pretence of God. For Adam, having beenmoulded as a pretence of Man, rendered them fearful of the pre-existentMan, since this stood in him and being terrified, they quickly spoilt thework.Despite this superiority, Man is still inferior to the ‘pre-existent humanbeing’ envisaged by God and the actual production, a theme one can alsoobserve in Philo. However, in this case the Archons can be blamed for theinferiority of Man, just as in theTimaeusthe work of the Young Godswas responsible for Man’s mortality. Man is still formed according to thedivine image and the God rectifies his inadequacy, since he improves uponwhat has been modelled (LaytonvFr. D=V ̈olker Frag5=Clem.,Strom.4.89.6–4.90.1(vol.2.287.21–7St ̈ahlin)):Just as much as an image is inferior to the living face, to this extent toois the comos inferior to living eternity. What, then, is the cause of theportrait? It is the greatness of the face that has provided the impression tothe painter, so that it might be honoured under his name.

The story of Man is a prefigurement of the fate ofChrist and the myth is probably inspired by it.The end of creationThe Valentinian concept of creation also envisages what will occur at theend of the world, when the Demiurge and the souls of the just will move tothe midpoint, occupied by Sophia, but will remain outside the fullness.61Philosophically, this is particularly interesting. Many metaphysical systemshave a cyclical concept; for example, Stoicekpyrosisor Platonic metempsy-chosis. Here the goal of Valentinianism is the negation of creation. UnlikeOrigen, a second fall is not envisaged or at least never made explicit. Cre-ation is totally pointless, although at least Valentinus envisages some hopeof salvation for the creator. Unlike other Gnostic sects, he also recognises thepossibility of some (albeit limited) salvation for the just (non-Gnostics).Still, unlike in Plato’s system, they never get a second chance. Once allhuman souls have escaped, the material fabric of created reality will bedestroyed by fire and matter will enter into ‘definitive non-existence’.62It is an indictment of creation when the entire goal of the Valentiniansystem is to seek to undo it. In the Valentinian system, no doubt as partof itsrapprochementwith the Jewish tradition, the Demiurge is allowedto repent at the arrival of the Saviour and be rewarded by a place at themidpoint.63The Demiurge is not an antagonistic power, but it seems that a particulardivine role has been allotted to him; he is something like the caretaker of theCratylus.WhilethismaynotproveP ́etrement’s ‘Valentinian turning-point’,the notion of the Jewish Yahweh acting as a protector for the ChristianChurch certainly indicates a change in outlook that has taken place sincethe emergence of Christian Gnosticism. The spirits of the Gnostics becomedetached from their souls and enter the Pleroma with Acham ̄oth; and arebestowed as brides on the angels around the saviour.

As Stead has illustrated, it islikely that it is neither, but that both are sophisticated versions of a muchsimpler original doctrine held by Valentinus himself.65Stead advancesseveral cogent arguments in favour of such a view. Firstly, both versions areorganised in two phases (events within the Pleroma and activity subsequentto the fall). Secondly, the myth employs formal parallelism at several points.The First Sophia and the other Aeons do not know their origin, which isknown by Monogenes (Adv. Haer.i.3.13), in order that they may long to seethe Father. Likewise, the younger Sophia is not informed about her originby Christ so that she may long for better things (Adv. Haer.iv.1.33–4).The First Sophia acts without her consort (Adv. Haer.i.2.2), while theyounger Sophia is without a consort (Adv. Haer.i.4.1). Indeed, it might besaid that she is below the law of the syzygy. Thirdly, there is the parallelismbetween Sophia’s attempt to know the Father, which is stopped by Horos,and Acham ̄oth’s attempt to re-enter the Pleroma to find the Aeon whohas left her, until she is stopped by outer Horos (who must clearly be aduplication). Fourthly, there is the parallelism between the expulsion ofSophia’s guilty thought from the Pleroma, which creates younger Sophiaor Acham ̄oth and the expulsion of Acham ̄oth’s passions which then gotowards the creation of the material realm. Finally, when younger Sophiais expelled she appeals to Christ to expel her passions and he sends theParaclete or Soter. This indicates that the versions which we have are adevelopment of a much simpler original involving only one Sophia, oneHoros and a single expulsion of passions.Sagnardpropoundedatheoryof‘lesloisdelagnose’.66This is the notionthat in the Gnostic myths there is a tendency to draw a correspondencebetween both the upper and lower worlds. However, in this myth, there isonly duplication in the events relating to Sophia. There is no equivalentto the Pleroma functioning at a lower level, and the Demiurge has nocounterpart within the Pleroma. This leaves one to draw the conclusionthat the myth of Sophia is a deliberate reconstruction. This may have beento cater for inconsistencies between the various traditions. It is possible, forexample, that some versions regard the guilty intention of the first Sophiaas expelled from the Pleroma, while others may have regarded her passionsas being expelled. One tradition claims that Sophia had four passions;65Stead:1969,8166Sagnard:1947,255–65"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"232Valentinus and the Gnosticsanother that she had three (and repentance). This all seems to indicate thatthe passions were those of the First Sophia, but have been assigned to theyounger Sophia in the versions which we have.According to Irenaeus, Valentinus believed in an ultimate Dyad andthirty Aeons, which is closer to the system subsequently advocated byPtolemaeus. Valentinus does posit two Horoi, one between the other Aeonsand Bythos and another between the Mother and the Pleroma....καὶ τὸν Χριστὸν δὲ οὐκ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν τῷ Πληρώματι Αἰώνων προβεβλῆσ-θαι,ἀλλὰ ὑπὸ τῆς μητρὸς,ἔξω[suppl.δὲ]γενομένης,κατὰ τὴν γνώμηντῶν κρειττόνων ἀποκεκυῆσθαι μετὰ σκιᾶς τινος....and Christ was sent forth not in the Pleroma of the Aeons, but by themother outside, and due to the judgement of the powers, she was put awaywith a certain shadow. (Iren.,Adv. Haer.i.5.1.19–22)In this version, Christ is the son of Sophia (and therefore the youngerbrother of the Demiurge), and is not the product of the Pleroma. Sophiahas been expelled from the Pleroma, indicating that in this version, we areonly dealing with a single Sophia. If one turns to theExcerptaof Clement,the situation becomes more complex. In one passage, Christ is emanatedfrom the Ennoia (Thought) of Sophia.67Stead suggests that this mightindicate that the Ennoia is to be distinguished as a separate entity fromSophia and that the resemblance between the two passages suggests thatthe Mother and Sophia can be equated.68If this is the case, then perhapsin the Ennoia we have the origin of the younger Sophia. AtExcerpta39,the Mother produces Christ.69Christ ascends to become the adopted sonof the Pleroma. This version is problematic, since Christ’s origin would beinferior to that of the other Aeons, and would seem to make him incapableof fulfilling the role which he has to play.All of this reveals that a creative approach towards Gnostic mythologywas adopted by Valentinus and his successors, rather like the approachtowards Plato’s dialogues that was adopted by Platonists. In the myth ofSophia, we have the ultimate indictment that the world is bad from itsbeginning. It results, not as part of the divine plan, but as the productof fragmentation within the godhead, which ultimately leaves part of thegodhead trapped, as in Hermetism.

On top of this, the world is created bythe Demiurge, who lacks the better aspects of Acham ̄oth, so that what weare left with in the created world is a cosmos that reveals some aspects of adivine, ordering power (such as the images of the Forms), but which wasunperceived by the entity who actually moulded the world.Sophia can be interpreted not just as a failed emanation which has tobe expelled from the godhead, but also as a divine mediator. The lowerSophia/Acham ̄oth (that is the substance which is emanated from the higherSophia is described as a ‘heavenly Jerusalem’, and ‘the good land flowingwith milk and honey’.71Indeed, as a divine mediator and creative agent, sheeclipses the Demiurge in the Valentinian creation myth. Sophia containsnumerous concepts. The term Mother is often allocated to her and it seemsthat she may have been conflated with the consort of the Father. She alsois a failed female entity. As theGospel of Philip6o:10–14states: ‘Echamoth isone thing and ech-moth another. Echamoth is simply Sophia, but Echmothis the Sophia of Death – that is the Sophia who is acquainted with Death,and who is called the little Sophia’ (trans. after Layton, slightly modified).72The perfect consort may have been altered into this Sophia of Death basedon the view that, since the most powerful principle after Good is Evil, itmust originate from the second most powerful cosmic power.73It wouldhave been quite natural to make this second power female, since the secondprinciple was traditionally regarded as a Dyad (which is female).Since Sophia connects the world of matter and the Gnostic equivalentof the world of the Forms, she can be regarded as the last of the Aeons.In attempting to interpret this myth, Platonists assigned various roles toSophia. She can be viewed as the Receptacle of theTimaeus, hence the useof the term ‘mother’ to refer to her. Because of her fall, she can be regarded70ἄγνοια,Iren.,Adv.

Steadalso adds that she can be identified with the World-Soul; just like thehuman soul she falls due to her attachment to matter.74Plutarch, too,regards the Receptacle as a disorderly soul.It is tempting to discern Philonic influence on the Valentinian myth.Philo uses ‘God’s shadow’ to denote either theLogosor the worldvis-`a-vistheLogos(Leg. All.iii.96,100). In Philo, the world is God’s youngerson, while the eldest isLogos(Deus31), God’s four offspring beingLogos,Shadow, Demiurge and Prince. The Valentinian myth is composed withinthe context of an interest in the origin of evil and within the frameworkof the temptation of Eve. For example, Eve’s celestial counterpart is Zoe,who is connected with Sophia in Gnostic texts. In theHypostasis of theArchonsandOn the Origin of the World, she is generally represented as thedaughter of Sophia, though on occasion inOn the Origin of the World,Sophia is called Sophia Zoe. Another indication of the similarity is that inboth cases a female figure initiates the sin, and the guilt is transmitted to ahusband/consort. Ultimately, both myths try to explain the emergence ofdisorder. For the Gnostics the fall of Man becomes simply a copy of the fallwhich occurred within the Pleroma, and both myths connect the Pleromaand the material world.75Sophia also owes something to the Holy Spirit, which Simon and Menan-der both regarded as the Mother of all beings.76Christ inThe Gospel of theHebrewsrefers to ‘my mother the Holy Spirit’. Aphraates, a fourth centurywriter, claims that God is man’s father, but the Holy Spirit is his mother.77The conception of the Holy Spirit as the Mother is a natural one, sincerˆuah(spirit) is feminine in Hebrew. Sincepneumain Greek is neuter,rˆuahcan be rendered in Greek by Ennoia or Sophia, which helps to preservethe female aspect. Theophilus of Antioch and Irenaeus’Apostolic Demon-strationlist Wisdom as the third person of the Trinity.78The Holy Spiritis equivalent to creative Wisdom. Once the act of creation was devalued,a distinction was drawn between the supreme Mother as first emanationand a second divine Mother inferior to the first.79It is only oncepneumais translated by the masculine Latinspiritusthat the concept of the Spiritas a female divine principle disappears.74Stead:1969,10075Macrae:1970,9976P ́etrement:1991,75gives references:Apocryphon of John(BG p.117and parallels);Gospel of Philip107.18–27;118.24–5;119.16–28;Apocryphal Epistle of James6.20–1.77Aphrahat,Homilien, ̈ubers.

The Christian concept of Mary containselements of the Mediterranean mother-goddess.An element of this occurs in the Barbelo, the second entity in the onto-logical scheme of the Barbelo-Gnostics. Although sometimes described asa male virgin, it is essentially a female generative principle. TheApocr.Joh.5.56describes it as ‘mother–father’, ‘a womb for the Pleroma’ and the‘thrice-androgynous name’ which indicates a dyadic nature.80FromvFr.B Layton (=Frag9V ̈olker=Marcellus of Ancyra,On the Holy Church,9),it would seem that Valentinus was quite close to the Barbelognostics’ three-fold division. InOn the Three Natures, Valentinus is supposed to have pro-pounded a belief in three subsistent entities (hypostases) and three persons.This might even be a version of the triad: Being, Life, Intellect. The sourcefor the text is Marcellus of Ancyra, a fourth-century theologian. The titleis all that survives ofOn the Three Natures. While it is possible that thiswork refers to the Trinity, it may also have dealt with the earlier tripartitedivision of this Barbelo Aeon, which does not correspond to either thepersons of the Trinity or to the Platonic triad.81Sophia is also an indefinitefemale dyad and this is how she comes to represent a cause of instability,thereby suggesting the myth of her fall.Letter to FloraAnother major witness to the Platonising element within Gnosticism wasPtolemy (floruitc.136–180ad). Previously regarded as one of Valentinus’most important disciples and as the founder of its Italic version, his preciserelationship to Valentinus has been cast into doubt by the recent researchof Christoph Markschies.82Markschies suggests that when Irenaeus refersto ‘the people around Ptolemy’ (οἱ περὶ Πτολεματῖν) he is differentiatengthem from the Valentian school (ἡ τοῦ Οὐαλεντίνου σχολή)atAdv. Haer.ipraef.2, not suggesting that Ptolemey was the founder of a branchof Valentinianism.

Despiteits name, it reads more like a treatise. The text was preserved in a quotation80Dillon:1999,70n.281Cf.e.g.Gr.

The addressee of the letter appears tobe a mainstream Christian, to whom Ptolemy is expounding the detailsof Valentinianism. The language is non-technical and rather frustratinglyalludes to a sequel, which will concentrate more heavily on metaphysics,but which does not seem to have survived (if it was composed at all).Ptolemy raises the question of whether the law and the world are thecreation of God or if the devil is ‘the father and maker of the universe’, aclear allusion to Plato’s terminology atTim.28e.84Ptolemy alludes to thebelief advocated by certain Gnostic sects, most notably the Cathars andBogomils,thattheworldissoimperfectthatitmusthavebeencreatedbythe devil, usually in this context known as the Cosmocrator. The majorityof Gnostic sects, including the Valentinians, would reject this claim, seeingthe Demiurge as a separate entity. Ptolemy defends the Demiurge, whom heequates with Yahweh. The law is regarded as the product of the Demiurgeor Old Testament God.85ThetrueDemiurge,however,isthefatherofChrist, who allows Yahweh to create the world:And the apostle says that his is the demiurgy of the cosmos and that ‘allthings were generated by him and nothing was generated apart from him’,and in this way undermined in advance the wisdom of these liars whichis without sure foundation and the demiurgy is not of a god who causesdestruction, but of one who is just and who hates wickedness. But theseunthinking people do not take account of the forethought of the Demiurgeand so they are incapacitated, not only in the eyes of the soul, but also thoseof the body. (33.3.6)It is of particular interest that the father of Christ can be regarded asthe true Demiurge. In the more fundamentalist Gnostic tradition, theDemiurge’s malevolence (or sometimes ignorance) is responsible for theinherent imperfection of the universe. The Valentinians, as part of theirattempt to bridge the gap between the Christian heritage of Judaism,Gnosticism and Greek philosophy, sought to reconcile the concept ofan imperfect world formed by an ignorant Demiurge and the Platonicnotion that the design of the world revealed the existence of the rationalintelligence which had created it.

Ptolemy is also more favourable to Yahweh than is typical for theGnostics, not referring to him as ignorant, but as just (although not good).While an element of ignorance is conveyed in Ptolemy’s description of theDemiurge as administering the cosmos according to the sort of ‘justicethat is his’,86he does display therapprochementtowards Judaism that ledP ́etrement to refer to this as the Valentinian turning-point.Although positioning the Demiurge between the devil and the trueGod is to be found in Gnostic systems that do not posit a Cosmocrator,Ptolemy is heavily influenced by the Platonic myth of world-generation inthis description of three essences:For the essence of the opponent is destruction and darkness (for he is materialand split into many parts) and the essence of the ungenerated father of the allis both incorruptible and self-existent light and the essence of this produceda triple power, and he is an image of the better god. (37.7.7)It seems that Ptolemy has been influenced here by the three elementsof Sameness and Difference, and the mixture intermediate between thetwo atTimaeus35aff.in his explanation for the variance between theseentities here. Ptolemy then tantalisingly alludes to an esoteric Valentinianmetaphysics concerning which he will inform Flora in the next instalment.He is on the verge of explaining the origin of evil and how corruptibleand intermediate essences can come to be from a First Principle which is‘ungenerated and indestructible and good’.87The main value of theLetter to Florais the information it provides on therelationship between the Demiurge and the First Principle. It is of particularinterest since it is a document created by the Gnostics themselves, ratherthan information relayed via the hostility of the Church Fathers. In it,Ptolemy adopts a stance which differs from the dualistic type of approachthat one might expect from a Gnostic, identifying three separate entities:God, Devil and Demiurge, rather than the more usual two of God andDemiurge. It is never quite clear how there is space in the Gnostic schemefor both Devil and Demiurge, but it is a product of Ptolemy’s attemptto rectify the harsh dichotomy between Yahweh and the highest principlemore usually found in Gnosticism.86Ptolemy,Letter to Flora33.3.58733.7.8"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"238Valentinus and the GnosticsSummer Harvest<αἰ>θέρος πάντα κρεμάμενα{πνεύματι}βλέπω,πάντα δ’ὀχούμενα πνεύματι νοῶ·σάρκα μὲν ἐκ ψυχῆς κρεμαμένην,ψυχὴν δὲ ἀέρος ἐξεχομένην,ἀέρα δὲ ἐξ αἴθρης κρεμάμενον,ἐκ δὲ βυθοῦ καρποὺς φερομένους,ἐκ μήτρας δὲ βρέφος φερόμενον.By means of my spirit I see all that are hanging,By means of my spirit I know all that are being carried,For flesh hangs from soul,And then soul clings to air,And air hangs from aether,And fruits rush forth from the deep,And a foetus rushes forth from its mother.This text (LaytonvHr88=V ̈olker Frag8) is a cosmological poemin which the writer, whom it has been suggested is Valentinus himself,describes the generation of the universe.89It actually has nothing to do witha summer harvest and Layton plausibly suggests that it may have been atune to which this poem was intended to be sung, although noting thatthis school frequently makes use of agricultural metaphors when consider-ing emanations.90The text itself has been preserved by Pseudo-Hippolytus,who quotes itRefutation of allinHeresiesvi.37.7, and it forms a useful com-parison to the theme of the Demiurge presented in the myth of Sophia.The text differs from traditional Gnostic material, being written in reg-ular verse, and the speaker claims a personal authority for his knowledge(‘I see in spirit’), rather than resorting to pseudepigraphy, which wouldbe more common among the Gnostic sects.

This would suit what we know ofthe Valentinian sect, which is more heavily Platonised than other Gnosticgroups.

However, it is an alternative example of ChristianGnosis, although it does not seem to have attracted the same hostility asValentinianism from the ‘mother church’, probably because it was not asinfluential, exemplified by the limited records or references to it in theancient sources, in comparison to the Valentinians.In theParaphrase of Shem(NHCvii.1) Derdekeas, the son of the highestentity (Pleromatic Light) is allowed by his father to grant a revelation toShem. In this system there are three principles: Light and Darkness withintermediate Spirit. Darkness wants to retain theNousrevealed to Shem,while Light attempts to recapture it. This produces the conflict whichleads to creation. After the first clash, sky and earth are created and subse-quent clashes produce living beings. This is reminiscent of Mandean dual-ism. Perates (the Self-Generated), intermediate between Supreme Goodand Matter, descends to impress his father’s seals upon matter,92echoingMan’s descent in order to create in thePoimandres. Perates recovers theformal principles and returns. Here creation is allegorised as a circularself-generating process.Basilides adopts elements of this, expressed in a less dualistic form.He depicts the non-existent God creating the world by hurling his seedinto the immaterial substratum.

This Third Son-ship allows creation to take place and it is also the one which becomesincarnate in Jesus: in the Sethian system, man is created by the demon-angels, who divide up the task amongst themselves.NHCii.1.15.29–17.6provides the details: ‘The first one began to create the head: EteraphaopeAbron created his head; Meniggestroeth created the brain; Asterechme theright eye; Thaspamocha the left eye; Yerormos the right ear; Bissoum theleft ear; Akioreim the nose . . . ’ The text goes on to outline the creationof each segment of the human body by a demon in a similar mannerright down to the toe-nails. It contains a detailed section on the creationof the genitals. Each demon controls that part which it created. Theirmother, Onortocrasi, is pure matter, while the four chief demons are Efe-memphi (Pleasure), Iocho (Greed), Nenentophni (Pain), and Blaomen(Fear).94According to theApocryphon of John, the Mother tricks the Demiurge byinforming him through the five luminaries that to give Adam life, he shouldbreathe his spirit into Adam’s face.95The Mother’s power leaves Ialdabaothand passes to Adam. Realising their mistake the Archons imprison Adamin the material world. The Demiurge or Ialdabaoth or the chief Archon –the terminology refers to the same entity – extracts Adam’s rib in hisattempt to seize the Epinoia of Light, which flees. As a compromise theDemiurge makes a copy of the Epinoia: terrestrial Eve.Ialdabaoth and Eve mate and produce Elohim (Cain, the bear-faced justgod) and Jahweh (Abel, the cat-faced unjust god). Elohim and Jahweh aretwo Old Testament names for God. It is understandable that as God of theLaw Jahweh should represent the unjust god, since that was the aspect ofthe Jewish God most objectionable to the Gnostics. But why is Abel unjust,when the Biblical Cain is the unjust brother? Perhaps this is a deliberateinversion. Cain presides over the higher elements (fire and wind), Abel overthe lower ones (earth and water). It is difficult to see, though, how Caincan be just when he unites with Abel to deceive humanity.Epinoia-Zoe returns to Eve, who produces a child, Seth, with Adam.In other similar variants, carnal Eve produces Cain and Abel and spiritual93Filoramo:1990,8594Filoramo:1990,9295BG51.1ff."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"The Sethians241Eve bears Seth.

Eve is somehow possessed ofgnosis, whichshe communicates to Adam. The Demiurge retaliates by splitting theandrogynous Aeon. This has the effect of making Adam and Eve obliviousofgnosis.97Three angels (these appear to be different to the Archons or demon-angels) announcegnosisto Adam and the future destiny of Seth’s descen-dants. This is clearly a duplication as exhibited so frequently in Gnosticism;in the original version, Adam must have learntgnosisfrom Eve and thenrevealed it to Seth. Where does Eve derive gnosisfrom?

Noah is either warned of the flood by Light or elsereassures the Demiurge and is allowed to survive. Noah’s sons serve theDemiurge, but four thousand of the descendants of Shem and Japhet joinwith the people ofgnosis.

Firstly,the Valentinian system itself was relatively liberal, allowing scope for sub-sequent thinkers to develop or reinterpret the teachings of the master.Irenaeus complains that ‘every day one of them [the Valentinians] inventssomething new and none of them is considered perfect unless he is pro-ductive in this way’ (i.18.15). Here we have evidence of the similar type ofphenomenon that was occurring in contemporary Platonism and whichhelps to account for the divergent traditions. In spite of the state of theevidence and the evident hostility of Irenaeus, through whom much ofour information is conveyed, it is still possible to draw a number of firmconclusions concerning the Valentinian view.Firstly, while we may be dealing with a heterodox sect, what we arediscussing here is creation in the Judaeo-Christian sense and not meredemiurgy. The Valentinians were after all ‘wolves in sheep’s clothing’, verymuch a part of the mother-church in their original incarnation. This, Iwould suggest, is one of the reasons why the Demiurge is a less importantagent in the generation of the world than Sophia or Acham ̄oth. It is Sophiawho initiates the sequence of events that leads to creation; one cannotreally expect the Demiurge to accomplish more than he does. Since he wasconceived by Sophia without the will of her consort or the consent of thesupreme principle, he is destined to be defective. He is forced to constructthe world without any knowledge of the Forms since he was either expelledfrom the Pleroma at birth or was born outside it. The material from whichhe constructs the world is drawn from the negative emotions of Acham ̄oth.It is not the case that the Demiurge is malevolent; rather he is an entitywith limited resources.The Demiurge’s role is undermined by his relationship to other figures.In variants which posit the Cosmocrator, both entities appear to be on alevel of equality, although the Cosmocrator has the advantage of greaterknowledge. This would seem to leave him incapable of combating evilwithin the material realm, which since he is described as good, one wouldpresume that he would wish to do. He is also not the sole creator of thematerial realm, since Sophia is responsible for instilling spirit in man, whichis the only positive aspect of creation. Christ is the true Demiurge in thesuprasensible realm, since in his stabilisation of the Pleroma he performs thestandard demiurgic action of imposing order upon disorder.

Still, in fulfilling that role, he is unsatisfactory as a divine mediator;a role which is fulfilled jointly by Christ in the soteriological sense, and bySophia metaphysically. This helps to account for his role in the Valentiniancreation myth, where he is certainly not a central character, and where heemerges on the scene in what can only be described as an epilogue, afterthe main events within the Pleroma have already taken place. Perhaps oneshould expect nothing less from a system which undermines the very valueof the creative act. The sole result of creation duringEndzeitwill be a moreunited Godhead, since presumably Sophia will have repented adequatelyfor her transgression.

Origen’s predecessorClement had, it is true, drawn heavily upon Greek philosophical motifs,but was unwilling to engage in a systematic exposition of Christian theol-ogy, due to the dangers of allowing the general public access to an accountof divine mysteries.1Origen was not so inhibited, though his Christian Pla-tonism made his works ‘suspect’ to some. The perceived heresy of Origen’sworks accounts for the loss of large sections, and these heretical elementsthemselves owe a great deal to his attempts to unite Platonic philosophyand Christianity, or to put it another way, to give Christianity a philosoph-ical pedigree, which culminated most famously in his portrayal of Christas the ‘creature’ of the Father. Whatever doubts one might have about hisorthodoxy, one cannot question Origen’s intellectual ability; unlike withPlutarch, or Maximus, here we have a ‘serious’ philosopher, prepared toresolve the most perplexing questions relating to demiurgy in a unique andoriginal way.This Christian interpretation of the Bible in philosophical terms waspart of a struggle for credibility and legitimacy. The Bible was a majoradvantage in the drive to convert: as Origen comments, the Church’sprincipal mechanism for conversion was reading the Bible and explainingthese readings.2The contradictions between the Bible and Greek philos-ophy could also at times be something of an Achilles heel, exposing theChristians to ridicule or hostility, when trying to win converts from the1The earliest Christian thinker whom we know to have enjoyed a philosophical education in the Greektradition, Justin Martyr, was influenced by the Timaean scheme of world-generation, though unlikehis successor, Tatian, he does not seem to have recognised the problems it posed for a Christian, interms of its positing of co-existent matter.2CCels.3.50244"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Introduction245upper-classes. The Christians were also involved in scriptural debates withthe Jews. Christians like Origen were trying to win over pagan convertsthrough unlocking the universal philosophy contained in the Bible, whileclaiming to be worthier heirs of Judaic wisdom than the Jews themselves.Origen himself famously compiled theHexapla, containing multiple ver-sions of the Bible, to ensure the accuracy of his scriptural references. Onethinks of Yohanan ben Zakkai’s comment that ‘a heathen who studies theTorah deserves death’ (Sanhedrin59a), since his actions are comparable toone who violates a bethrothed maiden.3Despite Origen’s heavy dependenceon theoeuvreof the hellenised Philo, and naturally on the Old Testamentitself, he refers to Jewish teaching itself asμύθοι καὶ λήροι, ‘myths andrubbish’.4His main exposition of the Judaeo–Christian creation account isoutlined inPeri Archˆon, although he discusses related issues in other works,most notably in theCommentary on JohnandContra Celsum.It seems to me that Origen’s interpretation of Scripture can best beunderstood against a Platonist background, although this is not univer-sally agreed. Edwards and Tzamalikos, in particular, downplay the Platonicinfluence upon Origen, although they do not deny the significant roleplayed by philosophy (or indeed Platonic language) in his thought. Tza-malikos also questions the extent to which Philo’sLogosserved as a directinfluence on Origen, rather than theGospel According to John.The maincontribution of the position adopted by Edwards and Tzamalikos has beento stress the extent to which Origen’s views have been misrepresented by hisopponents,5as well as to highlight passages where Origen does not adhereto a Platonist view; however it is clear that Origen as a Christian mustnecessarily disagree with Platonist views which contradict the Bible. Ori-gen used Platonist language and concepts to expound Scripture in muchthe same way that a modern Jesuit (one thinks of Teilhard de Chardinhere) might explain the Bible in a manner which takes account of scientifictheories, in order to attract educated followers. Edwards and Tzamalikosdo, however, concede that Origen’s thought has been radically influencedby Platonism.One of the major arguments which Tzamalikos relies upon to supporthis position that Origen is an anti-Platonist is the claim that for Origencreation comes about from non-Being:3Rabbi Yohanan clearly did not mean this literally; rather he seems to have been concerned thatGentiles could use Jewish law against the Jews.4CCels2.55For example, Methodius of Olympus’ claim that Origen espoused the doctrine of transmigration.Cf. Edwards:2002,2."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"246Origen, the Demiurge and Christian theologyThis is one more point on which Origen dissents from the Platonic mode ofthought. To Plato it was an axiom that ‘everything that has a beginning hasalso an end’. Against the background of that proposition, Origen affirmscreation out of non-being (an unPlatonic concept) and explicates that,although this creation had a beginning, it will have no end. The notions of‘beginning’ and ‘end’ related to creation are expanded in a context dissimilarto the Platonic mindset.6Tzamalikos relies on Origen’s statementselPs138;PG12:1661to supportthis position: ‘He is Creator because He brought creatures into being outof non-being’. Since the Greek readsκαὶ δημιουργός μὲν διά τὰ γεγονόταἀπό τοῦ μὴ ὄντος εἰς τὸ εἶναι, it would sound far more Platonic if simplytranslated ‘He is the Demiurge, since he has brought generated things to beout of non-Being’. In any case, to call Origen an anti-Platonist on this basisdoes not seem to my mind to accurately reflect the Platonic tradition. In theTimaeus(on a literal reading) the world comes into being from non-being(i.e from pre-cosmic chaos). Even if the majority of Platonists rejected thisreading, Plutarch and Atticus did not. Thus Tzamalikos’ point actuallydemonstrates that Origen adhered to a view that was held by a minorityof Platonists, but which could be justified based on a literal reading of aparticularly influential dialogue of Plato’s. This method of proceeding alsohighlights the difficulty in evaluating Origen’s cosmology: Origen can referto the world being generated out of non-being in the generally-understoodsense of the term (i.e. nothing, socreatio ex nihilo) or in the Platonic sense(i.e. non-being in the sense of lacking a definite structure).Similarly, Edwards notes that ‘it is dangerous to count Plato as amonotheist or a theist of any kind, when he did not, in any sense thatthe Bible knows, believe in God’.7However, it is clear that Plato exhibitsstrong monotheistic tendencies (he reinterprets the traditional gods ofGreek religion as manifestations of a supreme rational principle) and it iscertainly possible to be a theist without believing in an anthropomorphicdeity.Peri ArchˆonOrigen’s main discussion of creation is found inPeri Archˆon;ofhisHomilieson Genesis,onlyHomily1is really concerned with creation (and it does notaddress philosophical concerns, but rather expoundsGenesisas an aid tomorality, as St Basil would later do in theHexaemeron). For example, the6Tzamalikos:2007,3317Edwards:2002,48"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Peri Archˆon247‘great whales’ ofGenesis1:21are interpreted as thoughts which are againstGod. Some comments inHomily3are relevant, such as the declaration thatGod is incorporeal and omnipotent and ‘that he cares about mortal affairsand that nothing happens in heaven or earth apart from his providence’,8but the homily deals with the circumcision of Abraham). The title ofPeriArchˆonis itself a reference to matters of philosophical debate. Rufinustranslated it asvel de Principiis vel de Principatibus.Herewehaveanallusion to the two possible interpretations of the title: the principles ofthe Christian faith, or the metaphysical principles necessary for existenceand knowledge. The Platonists recognised three ungenerated principles:God, Matter and the Forms. However, as Eusebius comments, Origen hasretained the plural, even though he only recognises one principle necessaryfor existence: God, since he regards matter and the intelligible world as thecreation of the Father.That the principles of Christianity are really intended is suggested bythe contents of the work. The preface of the treatise deals with mattersof faith which are studied in the second part. The treatise itself also dealswith matters essential to the Christian faith, such as the Church, and theredemption mentioned by Christ.9Despite the plural, there is never anydoubt that we are dealing with thearcheof the cosmos: God. In fact,thearchehere is not to be confused with the Trinity, since for Origenit is only the Father and the Son, which he identifies with theLogos,which play a metaphysical role. The Holy Spirit is an entity which explainsthe workings of divine soteriology in the world through the influenceof the Saints, but Origen does not attempt to assign it a metaphysicalfunction.Origen reveals his awareness of the multiple senses of the termarcheatComm. Jn.i.(x) v90, where he points out that it is not only among theGreeks that it has multiple significations.Peri Archˆonaims at creating asystem which can explain God’s working in the world, in terms of Greekphilosophy, while at the same time remaining loyal to Christian thinking.For Marcellus of Ancyra, thearchaiwere evidently the Platonist ones: God,Matter and the Forms.10The Aristotelians and the Stoics also had theirarchai. Although Origen only recognised God as a principle, he is awareof the numerous interpretations ofarche, as emerges from his discussion atComm. Jn.i.90–105. It is clear, then, that the title is deliberately ambiguous,evoking both metaphysics and Christianity. Additionally, Origen is playing8Homily3.29Crouzel and Simonetti:1978,1410Crouzel and Simonetti:1978,13"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"248Origen, the Demiurge and Christian theologyon a third sense of the term, although in this case it has to be taken in thesingular: the beginning of creation.11The use of the term ‘principle’ is a technique on Origen’s part to locate hiswork within a specific tradition. The fragments of aΠερὶ ἀρχαν, composedin Doric Greek and falsely attributed to Archytas, is preserved in Stobaeus.Porphyry’sLife of Plotinusalso attributes aPeri Archˆonto the NeoplatonistLonginus. Since Origen regards matter as uncreated and the intelligibleworld as created atemporally by the Son-Logos, contained in the Fatherwho generated him, it would seem strange that Origen speaks of severalprinciples when he clearly only posits one. However, he does use the term‘principle’ to refer to matter and the Forms on the grounds that they areconsidered principles by others.The work appears to be written without a plan. However, once the con-fusion of the book divisions is removed, the actual structure emerges. Inany case, the book divisions are subsequent, probably from the fourth cen-tury, if the reception of thePeri Archˆonfollowed the pattern of other worksof Origen, such as theApology.ThePeri Archˆondoes have an overarchingeditorial structure, however, with two main sections – a general exposition,followed by a focus on particular questions, in this case echoing Pseudo-Aristotle’sDe Mundo, or more closely paralleling Salustios’Concerning theGods and the World. Given this context, thePeri Archˆonis particularly suit-able for a study of demiurgic causality, as after having outlined the mainconcepts of his system, Origen then proceeds to resolve specific objections.ThePeri Archˆonconsists of a number of relatively autonomous tractswhich are arranged in the inverse order of the subject-matter of the sixbooks of Plotinus’Enneads. (Plotinus’ treatment consists of (1) Ethics, (2)–(3) the World, (4) Soul, (5) Intelligence and the Forms which it contains,(6) Being, One or Good.)The reliability of Rufinus’ translationThe next question which needs to be addressed before turning to thePeriArchˆonis the reliability of Rufinus’ Latin translation, the only complete(but not necessarily completely unabridged) version of the treatise that wehave. Rufinus began a translation of theApologyat the end of397and thenstarted on thePeri Archˆonin398. This detail is important, since Rufinusinserted into thePeri Archˆoncertain passages taken from his translation oftheApology.12Rufinus himself claims greater accuracy than Jerome, whom11Comm. Jn.i.9512Crouzel and Simonetti:1978,23"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"The reliability of Rufinus’ translation249he asserts in his version aspires to be more ‘the father of the discourse thanits translator’.13Fortunately, it is possible to assess Rufinus’ reliability independently.The discussion of free will atPrinc.iiiis also found atPhilocaliaxxi.A comparison with Rufinus’ version reveals the suppression of passagesthat would have been imprudent to reproduce doctrinally. He also ignorespassages which contradict more orthodox selections of Origen concerningthe Trinity; these passages, however, are probably heretical interpolationsin any case and so need not concern us. At points where Origen is obscure,Rufinus adds explanations, although this is unproblematic, since he tendsto glean them from Origen’s corpus itself. He acknowledges this techniquein thePraefatio.14The main problem with Rufinus from our perspective ishis treatment of Greek philosophical terms, which lose their precision whentranslated. Although he sometimes retains the Greek or latinises it, he oftentranslates it with a Latin paraphrase. This leads to a lack of consistency,since the same term is not always translated in the same manner.More generally, however, Rufinus’ version is reliable as an overall accountwhich paraphrases Origen’s work, rather than a faithful translation. In anycase, it is generally more reliable than Jerome’s version. Jerome claims tohave produced a literal version of thePeri Archˆon, but a comparison betweenthePhilocaliapassage and his and Rufinus’ version would not be in supportof this viewpoint. Rufinus is substantially faithful to his Greek original atiii.1.22, while Jerome makes an explicit allusion to the pre-existence ofsouls only hinted at in the Greek. Jerome seems to alter the treatise in orderto make it sound more strongly heretical. Ativ.3.10Rufinus is again morefaithful than Jerome, although Jerome contains some items omitted byRufinus.15For all its shortcomings, then, Rufinus’ version is still the mostimportant and useful version that we possess. Attempts have been made toproduce a more reliable version. Examples include Merlin (1512), Erasmus(1515), C. Delarue (1733) reprinted byPatrologia Graeca, Volume XI(1857),and E. Redepenning (1836).16The most thoroughgoing attempt to providea reliable text was that of Paul Koetschau (Berlin1913), which attempted areconstitution of the original text, weaving in all sorts of citations to fill inthe lacunae left by Rufinus. Although all modern editions owe somethingto Koetschau, his radical method has been somewhat discredited. The bestmodern editions are those of G ̈orgemanns and Karpp (1976) and of Crouzeland Simonetti (1978), the edition which I have principally relied upon.13IPraef.1.16–1814Princ.i.59–6415Crouzel and Simonetti:1978,28–3416Harlet al.:1976,15"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"250Origen, the Demiurge and Christian theologyCreation inDe Principiisorigen opens with a programmatic statement, positioning himself withinthe metaphysical debate on the Demiurge.17He refers to God as ‘the Godof all the Just: Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Enoch, Noah, Shem, Abraham,Isaac, Jacob, of the twelve patriarchs, of Moses, and of the prophets’. TheseJudaic references hint at the technique Origen utilises. He relies on Biblicalrevelation to provide himself with the authority he needs, but in fact histoolkit is inherited from philosophy, using reason and logic to expand thisrevelation in metaphysical terms and to go further than other Christianthinkers, although in practice Origen tends to point out that philosophyalone can only bring one so far. For example atHomilies on Genesisvi:1–2,Origen interprets the Biblical account (Genesis20) of Abraham, Sara andAbimelech allegorically. It will be remembered that Abimelech, king ofthe Philistines, takes Sara as his wife, since Abraham had claimed thatshe was his sister, but God ‘would not let him touch her’. Sara representsvirtue and Abraham did not wish her to be called his wife, since otherwiseshe could not be shared. Abimelech represents philosophers who ‘do notreach the complete and perfect rule of piety’ but ‘nevertheless perceivethat God is the father and king of all things’.18God has compassion forAbimelech – he does after all cure his handmaidens after making thembarren, but he still does not let the king of the Philistines attain virtue.Origen’s own work is ‘a philosophy towards Christianity’ (φιλοσοφία πρὸςΧριστιανισμόν).19Creation is difficult to understand ‘even by those whoare trained in philosophy, unless by means of divine inspiration’20becauseit is hidden in scripture.21Origen, indeed, is concerned about discussing itopenly since it is similar to giving holy things to dogs or casting pearls beforeswine.22He was clearly concerned about his views being misrepresented,as, in fact, occurred.Origen chiefly employs two techniques in his use of philosophy (princi-pally Platonism) to better understand the Trinity and Christian creation.By avoiding the identification of the Christian and Platonic divine triads,he is able to accommodate Platonic principles within a Christian theologi-cal system and by drawing on Philo’s concept of the instrumentality of theLogos, he is able to explainGenesiswith the aid of philosophy.Origen also moves against Gnosticism by stressing the goodness of theCreator and outlining that he is also the Father of Jesus as well as the17Princ.i,Praef.418Homilies on Genesisvi.2, trans.

Origen portrays the Father as the creator ofthe world, even though he goes on to state that everything else, includingthe Holy Spirit, is created by the Son. Since the Father is the principle of theSon, the Father can be viewed as both creator by extension, as well as thehighest transcendent principle. The Son adopts the role of a metaphysicalmediator and is a co-creator with the Father: ‘He helped the Father in thecreation of all things, because everything was created by Him.’23In anycase, the Father creating all things by means of his Word is found in theNew Testament (Cf.John1:304;Hebrews1:2).Here the First Principle creates a second, demiurgic god in a patternfamiliar from theDreig ̈otterlehrerof Numenius.24The Son aids the Fatherduring the act of creation: a common contention in pre-Nicene writers,which one finds even during the Arian crisis. What is particularly interestinghere is the question of the manner in which the Son is created. In paganmetaphysics, subordinating the Demiurge to the First Principle is a standardapproach. However, for a Christian, such a stance has significant doctrinalimplications. As Jerome comments ‘and at once in the first book Christ,the Son of God, is not born but made’.25What is the manner of this creation? It seems that Origen might beaddressing two themes – that of corporeal generation (Valentinus) or thatof the creation of the Sonex nihilo(the Arian theory). Origen posits anincorporeal, transcendent God, but at the same time, he needs to protectHis unity. The Son is for Origen, in a sense, similar to divine sons inPlutarch, not produced by sexual relations or by a normal emanation – asif theοὐσίαof the Father is simply divided.26He is born by27or from28the will of the Father or else is this will itself.29The Son is produced by the Father without causing any change in Hisnature or weakening Him.30Although both the Son and the NumenianSecond God are created atemporally, this creation has to be different,as the Son is not the result of a split in the godhead, as is the case inthe Numenian and Gnostic systems. God’s nature is immutable and soit would not undergo the sort of change undergone to produce the Son-Logos.

This Son is equated with theWord; the influence of Philo’sLogostheology is evident here. While thestatus of this Son-Logosas an independent entity is not denied, he remainswithin the Father. He is actually contained within Him, in his breast (τὸνκόλπον,Comm. Jn.vi.14.17–18). It is because the Son has this specialrelationship with the Father as First-born (but not as actually created) thatonly the Son can know the Father, since they have both existed since thebeginning.31He is to be regarded as the Wisdom of the Father. In thisway, Origen avoids positing two separate gods, which would be closer toGnosticism, since it would be another formulation of the two-powers-in-heaven theory, and according to Rabbinic documents this notion oftwo complementary powers is actually older than that of two antagonisticones.32After this preliminary section, the first treatise,De Deo, investigates thenature of the Trinity. Initially, it points out that God is incorporeal:. . . uti ne maius aliquid et inferius in se habere credatur, sed ut sit ex omniparteμονάς,etutitadicamἑνάςet mens ac fons, ex quo initium totiusintellectualis naturae vel mentis est.

(i.1.6.151–8)God here isνοῦς(like the Numenian First God), although this itselfis problematic, since atCCels.vii.38, Origen states that he is above bothνοῦςandοὐσία. This was an issue on which speculation amongst both theMiddle Platonist and early Christian writers was unresolved and goes backto Plato’s comments atRep.509b6ff.33AtExh.

The point Origenwishes to make is not whether God can be identified with Mind or shouldrank above it, but rather that God as the First Principle must be incor-poreal, since if He was composed of elements, the elements from whichhe was composed would be anterior to Him (i.1.6.190–3). In any case,Origen envisages God as light,35and seems to play upon the contemporaryPlatonist doctrine that it was incorporeal.36Origen compares God’s working on the world to vision: ‘But Mind doesnot require physical magnitude in order to achieve something or to bemore itself just as is the case with the eye which dilates in order to observelarge bodies, but to observe smaller ones contracts and closes itself. In thesame way, the mind requires intelligible magnitude, so that it grows notcorporally, but intelligibly’ (i.1.6.194–9). The Origenian Demiurge actson matter by expanding and contracting to set events in motion by itsoscillation. The description implies that the Demiurge must encompassthat which it wishes to act on intelligibly, whatever Origen might meanby that, but it is clear that the Will of God alone is powerful enough tostimulate creation. This is, after all, how He gives birth to the Son.Once the Son is regarded as a secondary divine mediator, the unusualnature of Origen’s metaphysical system becomes clear. This divine mediatorhas no beginning, not just temporally, but even conceptually:In hac ipsa ergo sapientiae subsistentia quia omnis virtus ac deformatio futu-rae inerat creaturae, vel eorum quae principaliter exsistunt vel eorum quaeaccidunt consequenter, virtute praescientiae praeformata atque disposita:pro his ipsis, quae in ipsa sapientia velut descriptae ac praefiguratae fuer-ant, creaturis se ipsam per Salomonem dicit creatam esse sapientia initiumviarum dei, continens scilicet in semet ipsa universae creaturae vel initia velrationes vel species.It is necessary to believe that Wisdom was engendered without any beginningwhich one can affirm or conceive. In this subsistent being of Wisdom, allof future creation was virtually present and formed both the beings whichexisted in the first place, as well as the accidental and accessory realities. As aresult of these creatures, which were in it like descriptions and prefigurations,35‘God is light as John says in his Gospel (1John1:5), and in Him is no darkness.’ See Dillon:1988a,218ff.36Not a notion derived from the presentation of light in either theTimaeusor theRepublic.

Origen modifies the traditionalPlatonist view that the Forms are the thoughts of God, since he locates it inHis Wisdom, which he identifies with the Son, rather like the position inPhilo. Origen is attempting to harmonise several strands of Greek philos-ophy with Christian thinking. Therationesthat Origen locates in the Sonare a Stoic borrowing corresponding to the seeds of the beings who willemerge at the creation of the world.37There is no contradiction betweenthe identification of the Son withLogosand then subsequently with Wis-dom. Origen collects the different names given to the Son in Scripture anduses them as the basis for his Christology; applying the different namesto differentἐπίνοιαι, each of which denotes a particular activity of Christ,usually either demiurgic or soteriological.Origen mentions God’s Wisdom here, partly because it is what heperceives to be the centralepinoiato which the others are subordinate, butalso because it relates so strongly to the creation of the demiurgic Son. Sincethere could never have been a time when God existed without His Wisdom,the Son must always have existed. Origen is perhaps also attempting to scorea hit here against the Valentinian Gnostics, who posit Sophia (Wisdom)as the last of the Aeons, while he places it first (although the notion is alsoPhilonic). The notion of a pre-temporal noetic image of creation containedin the Son also allows Origen to avoid the illogicality of positing a suddendivine temporal creation (and here we really are discussing creation in aJudaeo–Christian sense, rather than simply Platonic demiurgy), while atthe same time permitting him to remain loyal to the account ofGenesis.Origen regards theLogosas subordinate to Wisdom, since atProv.8.22,Wisdom is said to be the mainἀρχήof God’s Will andJn.1.1reads ‘in theWisdom (the Principle) was the Word’ (discussed by Origen atComm. Jn.i.90–4).38Origen explains that theLogosrefers to its function as interpreterof the secrets of Wisdom.39While God the Father parallels the absolutesimplicity of the Platonic Monad or the Plotinian One, the Son containsthe binary nature of the Dyad; a single hypostasis with multiple aspects:Wisdom, Truth,Logosand Resurrection. This multiplicity of nature wouldseem to make him inferior in many respects to the Father, although his37Crouzel and Simonetti:1978,3138Crouzel and Simonetti:1978,30–139Princ.i.2.3.59–67"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Creation inDe Principiis255unity is not compromised by these multiple aspects (Comm.

Thisinferiority appears to be supported by the New Testament.The role of Wisdom in creation is outlined ati.2.3.59–67:Quali autem modo intelleximus sapientiam initium viarum dei esse, et quo-modo creata esse dicitur, species scilicet in se et rationes totius praeformanset continens creaturae: hoc modo etiam verbum dei eam esse intellegendumest per hoc, quod ipsa ceteris omnibus, id est universae creaturae, mysterio-rum et arcanorum rationem, quae utique intra dei sapientiam continentur,aperiat; et per hoc verbum dicitur, quia sit tamquam arcanorum mentisinterpres.We have therefore understood how Wisdom is the principle of the paths ofGod and how it is said to be created; in so far as it performs and containsin it the species and the reasons of all creation. It is necessary to understandthat it is also the Word of God by the fact that it opens to all other beings,that is to say all creation, the reason of the mysteries and of all the secrets, allcontained without exception in the Wisdom of God, and by that it is calledLogos(Word), since it is like the interpreter of the secrets of intelligence.The Forms do not exist in an autonomous manner; they are containedwithin the oldestἐπίνοια(ii.118). There is a distinction betweeninitiaandrationes, a contrast between the Platonic Forms and the Stoic germs ofbeing. Therationescontained in Wisdom are a pattern of creation moredetailed than that of the Forms; they are theλόγοι σπερματικοίof theindividual beings which will be created.41AtProv.8.22, Wisdom is saidto be produced (κτίζειν). Origen reservesποιεῖνto denote creation, butin spite of this, Arius seized upon this passage to prove that Christ isa creature of the Father. What interests me here are not the intricacies ofChristian theology, but precisely what form of creation is intended. Rufinustranslatedcreata esse dicitur, a doctrinally safe option. In this context theSon is created, but only in the sense that He is a prefiguration of thecreated world to come, not in any other way, since He has always existedin the bosom of the Father (i.2.3.72–7). For the Father to exist withoutthe Son would be to deny Him absolute perfection.

The Son is Son, not as the result of adoption by theHoly Spirit, but by nature, since He is generated eternally and perpetually(aeterna ac sempiterna generatio), just as a ray is generated by a sourceof light. AtComm. Jn.ii.2–18, this continual generation of the Son bythe Father is compared to His unceasing contemplation of the Father;the Son has moved to occupy a role similar to that of the NumenianSecond God. In this case, the Son must be ordering Himself in responseto the Father and it explains how the Father can still be regarded as theDemiurge since He is involved in the continual creation of the world ofthe Forms contained in the Son. Origen has demoted the Forms, whichin the Numenian system were located above his Second God,43but bydoing this, he has given the Father a much more active role in generationthan that of having merely produced a Demiurge, although the leitmotifof generation in contemplation can be found elsewhere: in Plato (Phaedrus249c), Alcinous (Didasc.14.1) and Plotinus.Ati.2.6.161–8, Origen outlines the manner in which the Father and theSon collaborate during creation:Si enim omnia quae facit pater, haec et filius, facit similiter in eo quodomnia ita facit filius sicut pater, imago patris deformatur in filio, qui utiquenatus ex eo est velut quaedam voluntas eius ex mente procedens. Et ideo egoarbitror quod sufficere debeat voluntas patrisad subsistendum hoc, quod vultpater.

It is why, I think,that the will of the Fathermust suffice in order to create what the Father wants. In His desire, He doesnot use a means other than the Will which He brings forth in His counsel.It is in this way that the subsistent being of the Son is engendered by Him.(my italics)The Father can create merely by wishing it. The Son accomplishes thesame actions as He does.

Origen cleverly combinesGreek philosophy and Christian thought by linking the demiurgic rolewith God’s fatherhood. Origen also moves against the Gnostic notion thatthe production of the phenomenal realm was the result of an attempt bythe Demiurge to imitate the production of the suprasensible world by theFather [i.2.12.432–8]:Ea sane quae secundum similitudinem vel imitationem discipuli ad mag-istrum a quibusdam dicta sunt, vel quod in materia corporali ea a filiofiant, quae a patre in substantiis spiritalibus prius fuerint deformata con-venire quomodo possunt,cum in evangelio filius dicatur non similia facere,sed eadem similiter facere?Some speak of the similarity in the imitation of the master by the discipleor say that the Son accomplished in corporeal matter what the Father hadalready shaped in spiritual substances. How could this be imaginedsince theScripture does not say that the Son makes similar works, but that He similarlymakes the same works?(my italics)The Son is not a Demiurge in imitation of the Father, nor even involvedin carrying out the instructions of the Father, as the italicised lines reveal.He is the instrument through which the Father creates (as is found inthe New Testament). In a sense, the Son, asLogos, has adopted the role ofPhilo’sLogos-Cutter. Creation is produced through the collaboration of theFather and the Son, perhaps akin to Numenius’ principle ofπρόσχρησις.This is an anti-Gnostic move, since the Gnostics envisaged demiurgy asthe application to the psychic realm of the principles which created thehylic one.45This blurs to some extent the traditional Platonist distinctionbetween the noetic realm and the sensible one, since here the sublunarworld is produced as a continuation of its suprasensible counterpart, notin opposition to it.Origen revisits this notion of the demiurgic instrumentality of the SoninCommentary on John.46Christ as Wisdom is generated by the Father45Iren.,Adv.

Even though everything might receive God’s spirit (Princ.i.3.68), this does not suggest any sort of material pantheism.49As Lymanpoints out, Origen stresses participation, not to claim that the cosmos isconsubstantial with God, but to prove that all creation intentionally resultsfrom God the Father and sustains its existence from Him in a dynamicrelationship.50Origen identifies the Son with the Numenian Second God; this isimplied ati.3.1–4where he mentions that other philosophers have regardedcreation as the work of God’sLogos,andatHomGenxiv.3,thoughitisobvious that he has this in mind, since he would have encountered it via thePlatonic Letterii.312e–313a, which is quoted by Celsus and to which pointOrigen responds atCCels.vi.8. Some of the difficulty in understandingOrigen’s hypostatic triad comes from the merging of two ‘Ones’, whichowes something to the first two hypostases of theParmenides. The entiremoment of creation can be viewed in terms of a tried and tested Platonicformula, with a merging of a Mind that thinks the world and a Mindwhich is the Demiurge who actually created it.The Holy SpiritMany Platonists, including Numenius, interpreted the three kings of thepseudo-platonicEpistulaii.312e as referring to a divine triad: ‘All thingsστερέωμα’.Δημιουργὸς δὲ ὁ Χριστὸς ὡς ἀρχή,καθ’ὃσοφίαἐστί,τῷ σοφία εἶναι καλούμενοςἀρχή.‘However, it is possible that he is “He by whom”, that is to say He who creates, because “Godcommanded and it was created”.

It is as a principle that Christ is the Demiurge,in so far as he is Wisdom, because it is because He is Wisdom that he is called a principle.’Comm.Jn.i.110–11.47Blanc:1966,252–348Blanc:1966,252–349Denied atCCels.6.71(SC147.356–60).50Lyman:1993,48"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Holy Spirit259are related to the King of all things and the all are on account of him andhe is responsible for all good things. And the second things are relatedto the Second and the third things to the Third.’51In Christian literatureprior to Origen, we can find evidence of similar speculations. For example,Justin Martyr claims that Plato obtained the idea of the Trinity fromMoses, suggesting an equation between Platonist and Christian triads ofhypostases. After quotingEpistulaii, Clement goes on to comment ‘I atleast do not understand it any other way than that the Trinity is disclosed;for the Holy Spirit is third and the Son is second, through whom ‘everythingwas made’ [John1:3] in accordance with the will of the Father’ (Stromateisv.102.3–103.1).Origen’s response differs from his Christian predecessors in his opposi-tion to a simple identification of both triads.52Despite repeatedly admittingPlato’s stylistic superiority over scripture,53he is able to regard Christiandoctrine as superior, since it alone has knowledge of the Holy Spirit.54Pagan philosophers were unaware of its existence because it has no demi-urgic function; its activity is soteriological and confined to the saints.55Origen’s influence on the Christian tradition ensured that, due to the dif-fering Third Hypostasis, the Platonic and Christian triads are not equated.By not identifying the Third King with the Holy Spirit, Origen can retaina version of the Platonic principles which does not conflict with Christiantheology and claim superiority for Christianity in that it alone knew ofthe existence of the Holy Spirit. Origen is clearly drawing on the triadicthinking of Numenius of Apamea, whose theology speculates on thesethree kings. While Origen rarely mentions his sources in his extant works,we do know that he consulted Numenius as he is mentioned second toonly Plato in theContra Celsum.Numenius’ combination of an intellect at rest, which can be regardedas possessing a demiurgic function insofar as it generates the Demiurge,influenced Origen in positing a Father who is a creator insofar as he uses51Kritikos:2007:περὶ τὸν πάντων βασιλέα πάντ’ἐστὶ καὶ ἐκείνου ἕνεκα πάντα,καὶ ἐκεῖνοαἴτιονἁπάντων τῶν καλῶν·δεύτερον δὲ πέρι τὰ δεύτερα,καὶ τρίτονπέρι τὰ τρίτα.52Tzamalikos:2007,17, bases some of his oppostion to the claim that Origen exhibits strong Platonictendencies by pointing out the ‘hackneyed assertion that his Trinity was a Plotinian triad’ which isoften made. He has a point here, in that Origen does not attempt to incorporate the Holy Spiritinto a metaphysical system.53CCels.vi.1ff.54Princ.i.3.155The subordinate nature of the Holy Spirit comes across atComm. Jnii.10.76: ‘And perhaps this isthe reason why he himself does not bear the name Son of God, for only the only-begotten is Sonby nature from the beginning, and it seems that the Holy Spirit has need of him to minister to himhis substance.’ (trans.

Origen links the unity of the Father with themultiplicity of Creation through theepinoiaiwhich he posits in Christ.Theseepinoiai(Greek=thoughts, purposes) are denominations of Christwhich correspond to an aspect of his activity. The first two of these, Wisdomand Word, betray the influence of Numenius’ Second and Third God inthat Wisdom is the Son’s creative potential, whereas the Word is actuallyinvolved in the act of creation. Word is then the lower aspect of Wisdom,just as the Third God is the lower aspect of the second. In positing theWo rd o rLogosas the instrument through which a transcendent God creates,Origen additionally reveals the debt which he owes to Philo.56There is another reason why Origen may have wished to avoid associatingthe Holy Spirit with the third hypostasis of the Platonist triad (the World-Soul) and why he may have viewed a simple equation between the Trinityand the Platonist triads as inadequate for his metaphysics. The only possibleparallel to the World-Soul in Origen is the human soul of Christ. I thinkthat since the Platonist World-Soul contains individual human souls (Plato,Tim.34b; picked up later by Plotinus atEnn.iv9[8]), Origen would notrelish the prospect of making the Holy Spirit substantially the same asindividual human souls, whereas for the human soul of Christ, this presentsno problem. The Holy Spirit does represent, however, the beginning ofcreation, since it is the first entity co-produced by the Father and Son.Origen makes it quite clear that the Holy Spirit only owes its existence tothe continual mediation of the Son.The Son participates in the divinity of the Father and is not merely oneof the created, though the Holy Spirit appears to be one. The Father andSon share a substratum (or lack of a material substrate), denoted by thetermsὑποκείμενον,ὑπόστασιςandοὐσία, although it is unclear whetherthe Son is actually generated from theοὐσίαof the Father.57In fact, Origendid not believe that the Son could be createdex nihilo: ‘we do not thereforesay, as the heretics think, that a part of the substance of God changes itselfinto a Son, or that the Son was created by the Father from nothing’ (Princ.iv.4.1.(28).3–19). Even though it is clear that the Father does not producethe Son from outside His substance, Origen does not actually say that Hewas produced from the substance of the Father. This idea of the generationof theLogosfrom nothing was an Arian notion, frequently linked with thenon-eternity of the Son.56Clearly theLogosis to be found in the Fourth Gospel also, but Philo, I think, can rightly be viewedastheinnovatorofatheoryoftheLogoswithin a Biblical context.57Lyman:1993,69"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"God’s activity prior to creation261Origen rules out the idea of pre-existent matter ati.3.2.56–62, relyingon reference to Scripture to refute belief in a matter which is co-eternalwith God. Origen moves against the traditional Platonist perception ofdemiurgy (ordering something pre-existent) in preference to his belief increatio ex nihilo, a prudent move for a monistic system. This is stressed byOrigen, who does not wish for fragmentation to creep into the godhead,stressing the unity of purpose shared by the Trinity. However, despite thisradical shift, Origen’s system is influenced by the concept of demiurgy,rather than an entirely independent creational model: he refers to theTrinity ati.4.3.46–50asεὐεργετικὴ δύναμιςetδημιουργική, ‘a beneficialand demiurgic power’. Rufinus uses the Greek terms in his Latin text,indicating that they originate with Origen himself. It is of note that Origenapplies the term to the whole Trinity, as well as to the Father. Even thoughthe Father and Son are co-Demiurges, Origen can apply the term to theTrinity as a whole, since they are one.God’s activity prior to creationOrigen then deals with one of the vital issues facing all those who positcreation at a given point in time: what was God doing beforehand. ForOrigen, it is impious to think that God was actually idle.58Origen has toview the Demiurge as active for all eternity since, as he points out further onin the same passage, to say otherwise would lead one to suppose that he hadbeen prevented from creating by external powers, which would go againstbelief in His omnipotence. The other alternative, that God had simplynot wished to create until a given moment in time, would go against Hisimmutability. To claim that God is active for all eternity, as Origen doeshere (an excellent philosophical choice), would be to claim that creation isco-eternal with God; a claim contrary to the Christian faith.Origen manages to evade this problem by means of a solution alreadyhinted at in sectioni.2.10. Creation is co-eternal with God, but onlyinsofar as this refers to the intelligible world, containing the blueprintof creation, which itself is contained within the Son, who is producedby continual generation. Origen also points out that temporal vocabularycannot be applied to the Trinity.59We are fortunate that Rufinus leavesseveral of the terms of this section in the original Greek, which reveals thenumerous influences which lie behind the composition of this section –that of Philo (in the reference to God as aποιητικήandβασιλικήpower),58Princ.i.4.359Princ.iv.4.1"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"262Origen, the Demiurge and Christian theologyand of the Platonic tradition (Tim.29), in the description of the worldas an emanation from divine goodness.

The conclusion to this argument advanced with somecaution ati.4.5.100–5is that if the noetic realm always existed, then the‘genera’ and ‘species’ must also have done so. This raises the question ofwhether individualities (singula) could possibly have always existed. Origenonly mentions the issue, but does not attempt to provide a solution; he ishere in an area where the Church of his day had not yet produced a dogmaticresponse. Tzamalikos does not regard the question of what God was doingbefore creation as one which Origen takes seriously, referring to it as a‘pseudo-question’60and a ‘fake question’.61This seems to me to be undulydismissive – the claim that the world had been created at a point in time wasa difficult one to defend within the Greek philosophical tradition (probablya reason why the literal reading of theTimaeushad been abandoned bythe Old Academy). It is true that Origen is not unduly worried abouthaving to interpret the creation accounts ofGenesisas literally referringto a temporal creation: ‘Scripture does not speak here of a beginning intime, but states that the heaven and earth and everything which was made,was made, “in the beginning”, that is in the Saviour’ (Homilies on Genesis1.1).62Tzamalikos is, however, right to point out that Origen separatesthe conception of God from his will to create; in other words God doesnot need to create to be God.63By contrast, it is hardly possible for theDemiurge not to generate the world and still be the Demiurge.However, perhaps the Origenian system itself provides the answer. ForOrigen, the world is created through the free choice of individual soulswho fall; some to become angels or stars and others still further to becomemen or demons.64Therefore it is possible that all individuals existed beforethe creation of this world, since the end of the cosmos will represent areturn to the state of the beginning, as individual souls chose the path ofrighteousness, although as free will shall remain, thepossibilityof a futurefall and further worlds is preserved, though theprobabilityof this occurringis disputed (see my discussion below). This fall is contested by Edwards and60Tzamalikos:2006,14761Tzamalikos:2006,15362non ego hic temporale aliquid principium dicit, sed ‘in principio’, id est in Salvatore, factum essedicitcaelumetterrametomniaquaefactasunt.63Tzamalikos:2006,15364It is uncertain whether Origen envisages the souls of all angels as remaining in the initial state ofblessedness or whether this applies only to their higher orders."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"God’s activity prior to creation263Tzamalikos on the grounds that the texts supporting a fall have largely beendrawn from opponents of Origen and that this belief in a fall was largelysustained by the anathemas which were decreed by the second Councilof Constantinople.65An example of this is the second anathema againstOrigen, which appears in Koetschau’s edition as Fragment23a.66The production of all rational creatures consisted of incorporeal and imma-terial minds without any number or name, so that they all formed a unity onaccount of the identity of their essence and power and activity and by theirunion with and knowledge of God the Word; . . . they took bodies, eitherconsisting of finer or grosser particles, and become possessed of a name,which accounts for the differences of names, as well as of bodies among thehigher powers; and thus the cherubim, with the reigns and authorities, thelordships, thrones and angels and all the other heavenly orders came intobeing and received their names.67Even if we must bear in mind that this passage is not a literal citation,it must reflect Origen’s views (otherwise there would not have been muchpoint in decreeing these anathemas against him).68According to Tzama-likos, the souls are originally ‘in God’; the soul of Christ comes out, sinceit is sent from the Father ‘but other souls came out of God in a dissimilarmanner, neither being sent or escorted by the divine will’.69For Tzamalikosargues that any reference to the fall of souls really refers to the emergenceof souls out of God and is not a fall, but rather an expression of divineeconomy, since ‘before’ the fall or ‘after’ the end of this aeon, there is only adivine reality.70This is clear also from Origen’s argument: ‘Therefore in thisWisdom, which was always with the Father, creation was always present inoutline and form and there was never a moment when the prefiguration ofthose things which were to come to be was not in Wisdom.’71Creation iscontinuous, since it reflects the eternal Wisdom of God, where theLogosalways is.72‘The God who made the universe did not require time in orderto make such a great heaven and earth...for even if it might seem thatthese things were made in six days, there is need of intellect to understandin what way “in six days” is meant.’73A related topic has been the cause for one of the major disputes inrecent Origen scholarship.

I said before that it is difficult for us to explain this world here, lestperhaps it might supply to some people the occasion to suppose that we areasserting the existence of certain images which the Greeks call ‘ideas’. For itis completely foreign to our mode of reasoning to speak of an incorporealworld, which exists solely in the fantasy of the mind and in the fluidity ofthought, and I do not see how they could assert that the Saviour came fromthere or that the saints will go there.

This problematic passage atPrinc.ii.3.6can be reconciledwith the noetic world posited atPrinc.ithen, since Origen elsewherefrequently refers to the world as consisting of spaces on different levels –celestial and supercelestial ones atPrinc.ii.3.6, or placed above the aetheratCCels.iii.4.2;v.4.Another passage which Tzamalikos uses to support an anti-Platonicreading isCCels.v.21‘Furthermore the followers of Pythagoras and orPlato assert that the cosmos is indestructible, but they trip up in a similarmanner.’74This passage refers to the succession of identical worlds in whichthe same events are fated to occur: Socrates will once again be accused byAnytus and Meletus, and will once again be condemned.

It is also that case that Origen continually represents Christianwisdom as being superior to, or as surpassing Greek thought, while at thesame time being profoundly influenced by Greek philosophy.The question of evilAtPrinc.i.5.374–88, Origen asks whether God designates some of hiscreatures as virtuous and others malicious. Clearly, he replies, it cannot bethe case that some souls were evil from the very moment of their creation,since this would make God ultimately responsible for evil. There is nonecessity for them to be evil; rather they fall as a result of making thewrong choices; the Creator is not responsible for this; He has merely giventhem free will.75Ati.5.3.129–37, Origen points out that there is nothing inthe nature of the Trinity which would lead them to produce beings whichare evil by nature. Saints were not saints since the beginning, rather theywere souls which fell further than the angels, but not so far as the rest ofmankind.This idea is clearly inspired by Plato’sPhaedrus246b–d and an echo ofthe same thought is expressed atCCels.iv.40. This fall is what motivatesGod to produce the material world, thus vitiating the claim that it wouldbe illogical for Him to arbitrarily create it at a given point in time (thoughOrigen could have simply used Plato’s point that it was produced alongwith Time, not in Time). He could similarly have availed himself of Philo’sresponse that the events ofGenesisare depicted in a hierarchical, rather thana temporal order. Metaphysically, Origen is still faced with the problemof having his First Principle intervene directly in the material world. Ofcourse, God intervening directly in the sublunar realm is precisely whatoccurs during the Incarnation, but this would not deter Origen fromattempting to harmonise Christianity and a philosophical view of creation.This intervention is not problematic for Origen. The creative interventiondoes not posit a change in God’s nature and is not the result of Godchanging His mind. After all, God’s decision to create is as as the result ofHis mercy, which is part of His nature. Nor should Origen’s view be seen75AtCCels.iii.69.1–11, blame is placed squarely on Man, when Origen asserts that no soul was createdevil, but they became so as a result of habituation or perversion, and even for such individuals, thedivineLogoshas a purificatory function, actually nourishing the human soul (CCels.iv.18.12–26).In this passage, Origen plays upon the nurse imagery of the Receptacle, although it is theLogoswho is the nurse of creation, nourishing individual human souls, just as a nurse provides milk toan infant."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"266Origen, the Demiurge and Christian theologyas particularly unusual; the same idea occurs for example in tenth-centuryArabic philosophy. The Incarnation is not an aberration, but rather it ispart of God’s divine plan, intended all along to take place when the timewas right. (In this way, it is similar to Teilhard de Chardin’s ‘Omega Point’as the goal of history.) Christ is furthermore never in time, but stretchedout alongside (συμπαρεκτεινόμενος)time.76As a result of their fall, the pre-existing intelligences are placed in bodies:the angels have the lightest, followed by men and demons. It would seemthat the weight of the material body should be linked to the distance ofthe fall from God in the first book ofPeri Archˆon.77However, elsewhereOrigen refers to demons as having a lighter body than ours.In this sense, Origen does not differ from the Gnostics in regarding thematerial world as essentially evil, since it is under the power of the devil.78The devil is evil through his own free choice. As Origen later affirms, thedevil can be regarded as the creature of God, as a being, but not in hisrole as the devil.79He owes his existence to God, but not his choice, andso God is not responsible for the existence of evil in the sublunar realm.80Origen makes this point more forcefully atPrinc.i.5.5.283–6: ‘it is onlythe Father, the Son and Holy Spirit who are pure in a substantial manner,but the holinessof every creatureis an accidental reality and that which isaccidental can fall.’ The italicised phrase has often been overlooked, whenOrigen has been attacked for claiming that the Son is a creature of theFather. Clearly from this section everything other than the Father, Son andHoly Spirit are created. They are the only entities capable of possessinggoodness substantially, because goodness depends on the correct exerciseof free will and only the Trinity is capable of always making the correct76Johni.26,Comm.

Inthis sense, even though God is not responsible for the existence of evil, it plays a role in the divinescheme.

In this way, Origen does away with the Necessity which dogs thePlatonic Demiurge’s attempts at creation.Origen’s other argument to protect God from responsibility for theexistence of evil is simply to argue that it does not exist, on the groundsthat ‘whatever has not received its constitution from God or from HisLogosis nothing’.81Plotinus was strenuously opposed to this non-existenceof evil, since, as he argued, if evil did not truly exist, then neither did good,although Aristotle did not posit evil as one of his principles. Origen mayhave adopted this formulation, which essentially regards evil as an errantcause, as a response to Gnostic dualism.Creation,apokatastasisand the material realmOrigen has his own version of Stoicekpyrosis, with the possibility of aninfinite number of worlds being created and destroyed, although theydo not exist simultaneously. (Origen vacillates between this view and theposition that there is only a single fall and a single creation).Finis ergo mundi et consummatio dabitur, cum unusquisque pro merito pec-catorum etiam poenis subicietur; quod tempus deus solus agnoscit, quandounusquisque quod meretur expendet. In unum sane finem putamus quodbonitas dei per Christum suum universam revocet creaturam, subactis acsubditis etiam inimicis.There will be an end and a consummation of the world, at a time whichGod alone knows, during which each shall be submitted to the punishmentsmerited by his sins. We think that the bounty of God will assemble by HisChrist all creation in a single end, after having reduced and subjected evenHis enemies. (i.6.1.20–5)I think that here we have a democratic version of Gnosticism. In Origen,just as in Valentinus, the soul does not belong in the material realm, buthas entered it as the result of a fall. Just as in Gnosticism, creation is ina sense pointless, since the aim is to undo it, and for the soul to escapeback to the noetic realm from which it came. However, there are importantdifferences. Creation in Origen is not created by a split within the godheaditself and the need for the godhead to reunite does not motivate Christiansoteriology. Creation is worthwhile; if at the end, intelligible creatures,including presumably demons based on the passage quoted above, learn tomake the morally correct choices.81Comm.

As this single end is that of numerous beings, in this way startingfrom a unique beginning, there are many differences and varieties, whichagain, by the bounty of God, the submission of Christ and the unity ofthe Holy Spirit, are called back to a single end similar to the beginning. . . .(i.6.2.46–52)At the end of creation, all intelligences are united. What does Origenmean by this? If the end is similar to the beginning, this would indicate thatthe souls exist in the noetic realm within the Son-Logos. It would indicate,just as in Gnosticism, that they would be absorbed back into the godhead,However, this cannot be the case, since the souls were not produced bythe splitting of the godhead and are its creatures, and secondly, if theyexisted in the Son-Logos, they would be ontologically superior to the HolySpirit. Ati.6.4.164–7, Origen states that this is not his view: ‘if the exteriorform of the world passes away, it will not be a complete destruction,nor a loss of material substance, but a certain change of quality and atransformation of the outward appearance.’82Clearly if some aspect of thematerial world is to be retained at the end, this cannot be reintegrated in theSon-Logos. The Origenian creation cycle can be viewed as the distribution ofpre-existent intelligences into corporeal bodies, which culminates in theirreintegration into the supralunar realm. But if Origen is not concernedwith the absorption of individual souls into the godhead (and I think that82. . . si habitus huius mundi transit, non omnimodis exterminatio vel perditio substantiae materialisostenditur, sed inmutatio quaedam fit qualitatis atque habitus transformatio."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Creation,apokatastasisand the material realm269he is not), then does he regard the individual entities as merged at the end?Under such a reading, at the commencement, individual souls would notbe distinguished, and we have already seen that they are, even in the noeticrealm of the Son-Logos.A related point is the consideration of what happens to the materialrealm after the end. In Gnosticism it seems to keep ticking away underthe Demiurge, since it exists in opposition to God the Father and notbecause of Him. The passage quoted above is clearly inspired by St Paul’scomment that the external form of the world will pass away and Godwill be all in all.83Yet, material substance will continue to exist, in thesense that corporeal bodies will become more refined, like the bodies ofangels. It is not the case, as in Gnosticism, that the material world shallcontinue to exist in conflict with the noetic one, even when the pneumaticsare saved, but that the entire material world shall be reintegrated, notinto the noetic realm contained in the Son-Logos, but into the supralunarrealm.Origen is quite clear on the necessity of the continued existence ofmaterial nature, even at the end of the world. That only the Trinity couldbe incorporeal is a commonplace concept in Origen and he does not seehow it is possible for a great number of substantial beings to survive withoutbody.84He suggests that the ‘corporeal substance will be so pure and puri-fied that it can be envisaged in the manner of aether’, but notes that ‘onlyGod knows with certainty what will occur’.85It has been the opinion ofnumerous scholars that Origen regarded the end of the world as the finalincorporeality of rational creatures.86This has the merit of making theend of the world the same as before the initial creation. Yet it is disprovedby Origen’s speculations regarding aethereal corporality. Ultimately thequestion of corporality is left somewhat open. The end cannot be thesame as the beginning, since the intelligences do not exist at the beginning(except perhaps in the noetic realm of the Son-Logos); they are created byGod the Father through the medium of the Christ.Secondly, these aethereal bodies must have been created at some point,but this raises the question of whether souls can ever have existed withoutsome element of corporality. Based on Origen’s view that only the Trinitycan exist without corporeality, it would seem that this could never be thecase. The end, on this reading then, is only like the beginning of thatspecific world, but not like the initial commencement of cosmic creation.Matter becomes refined to the point of becoming aether.

Mattercannot be ungenerated, since it would be coeval with God and outsideHis control. In any case, everything has been created by God (i.7.2.41–6etpassim), including soul.87What Origen seems to have in mind, on a literal reading, is that Godcreates matter initially, but at the end of each successive world, it becomesaether, only to become matter again during a subsequent fall. In such acase, we cannot strictly speak of a soul becoming enmattered, rather thesoul is already in an aethereal body, which then transforms into matter. Ifwe envisage, as Origen sometimes does, only a single creation followed bya singleapokatastasis(abolition of evil after the judgement and purificationof souls), there would be no question of God continuously convertingmatter to aether and vice-versa.Bookiiof thePeri Archˆonis also useful for the question of demiurgy,since it is concerned with the world and matter:Quamvis ergo in diversis sit officiis ordinatus, non tamen dissonans atque ase discrepans mundi totius intellegendus est status; sed sicut corpus nostrumunum ex multis membris aptatum est et ab una continetur ita et universummundum velut animal quoddam inmensum atque inmane opinandum puto,quod quasi ab una anima virtute dei ac ratione teneatur.Even though the state of the universe is composed of diverse functions, itis however not necessary to believe that it would be in disaccord and indisharmony with itself, but as our body formed from numerous limbs is oneand maintained by a single soul, in the same way, it is necessary to regardthe universe as an immense and enormous animal governed by the powerand reason of God as by a single soul. (ii.1.3.58–64)This idea of a harmonious cosmos owes much to Stoic thought, althoughevidently the concepts of a World-Soul and the cosmos as a Living Ani-mal are drawn fromTim.30b. Origen also treats the World-Soul here assomething allegorical, cleverly drawing on Platonic imagery and not con-tradicting it, even though evidently he did not believe in a World-Soul.Crouzel and Simonetti argue that the Son as the Power and Reason ofGod constitutes the Origenian World-Soul, since this is the mechanismthrough which God governs the world.88Thismaywellbetrueasregardsfunction, but as regards an exact parallel, it is the human soul of Christ87Princ.i.7.1.10–11.

For Origen, the Son is really atranscendent, personalisedLogos.89Origen, rather conveniently for our purposes, then supplies us with adefinition of matter: a substrate of the body, i.e. that which exists withthe insertion of qualities. Origen mentions four qualities: heat, cold, dryand wet, and notes that although matter itself is without qualities, it neverexists without them.90In reality, it has to always be informed by qualities;the intellect can only grasp thissimulata quodammodo cogitatione.This view of matter is in line with standard Middle Platonist teaching.Matter is an amorphous substrate which has to be informed by a specificquality: it can be arranged as an instantiation of any particular Form,without being engendered by it.91Since matter has been created by God,it cannot be responsible for evil. Origen criticises the standard Platonicnotion of an uncreated matter as well as the view that it is unregulated: ‘Ido not know how so many great men thought that it was uncreated, thatis to say, that it was not made by God, Creator of the universe, and howthey thought that its nature and its activity were the products of chance.’92Origen drew on the Stoic view of matter as uncreated but amorphous,while its qualities are created by God. This allows him to defend Christian-ity in terms which are also acceptable to those trained in Greek philosophy,which regards matter as uncreated. He argues that once his opponents areforced to concede that matter is nothing other than an assemblage of qual-ities, one dispenses with the substrate; if matter only consists of qualities,then these qualities are created by God. Therefore, matter is created byGod.93However, Origen’s claim that one can dispense with the substratediffers from his usual view of matter and is clearly adopted here for thepurposes of polemic.94Origen has to tackle also the notion of an idle Demiurge, a problemknown more famously from theAd Theopompumin which his student,Gregory the Thaumaturge, attacks a figure called Isocrates, who is accusedof holding this position.95The argument, refuted atPrinc.ii.1.4.125–56,is that God is incapable ofcreatio ex nihiloandsoifHehadnotbeen89Princ.ii.11.6,Comm.

Origen responds by suggesting that matter would not be suitableto be ordered by God’s Wisdom, if it had not been created by divine Prov-idence. He sides with the Platonists and the Stoics against the Epicureansand their denial of a divine Providence which regulates the world. However,he is also undermining the Platonic/Stoic position, since it is contradictoryto posit both Providence and an uncreated matter which limits its actions.For Origen, matter has to have a divine origin, since it is all used up increation, as no other worlds exist [i.3.1]; therefore its quantity has beenprecisely calculated.It could be argued that the Demiurge merely uses up all matter increation, but the quantity of matter used to make each body is directlylinked to the depth of the fall of the soul, therefore only God would becapable of calculating the precise quantity of matter necessary for creation.ii.3.3.130–42elaborates:Sed videamus quid eis occurrat, qui haec ita asserunt. Videbitur enimesse necessarium ut, si exterminata fuerit natura corporea, secundo iterumreparanda sit et creanda; possibile enim videtur ut rationabiles naturae, aquibus numquam auferetur liberi facultas arbitrii, possint iterum aliquibusmotibus subiacere, indulgente hoc ipsum deo, ne forte, si inmobilem sem-per teneant statum, ignorent se dei gratia et non sua virtute in illo finebeatitudinis constituisse; quos motus sine dubio rursum varietas corporumet diversitas prosequetur, ex qua mundus semper adornatur, nec umquampoterit mundus nisi ex varietate ac diversitate constare; quod effici nullogenere potest extra materiam corporalem.But we see the difficulties which are presented to the one who reasons inthis manner. If corporeal nature is completely destroyed, it would seemnecessary to restore it and to create it a second time, for it seems possiblethat rational natures, which are never denied the faculty of free will, couldagain be submitted to certain movements and God would allow this, lest, ifthey would remain always in a state of immobility, they would lose sight ofthe fact that their continuation in this final state of bliss depends on Godand not on their own proper virtue: these movements will involve onceagain without any doubt the variety and diversity of bodies, which alwaysdecorate this world, because a world can never consist of anything otherthan variety and diversity, and that cannot be generated out of anythingother than corporeal matter.Here the importance of matter in the creation of the sensible world isstressed, but it is only an element in the divine plan, not an independently-existing entity. Origen successfully adapts the Stoic notion of a successionof worlds to a Christian and Platonist context. In place of the strict Stoic"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Creation,apokatastasisand the material realm273determinism, Origen has greater spiritual dynamism. All that has beendetermined is the precise number of rational creatures created by God atthe beginning. Each successive world cannot be the same given the existenceof free will. AtPrinc.ii.3.4, Origen compares this to throwing wheat andexpecting the grains at each successive throw to form exactly the samepattern. The final state will be an assimilation to the state of the Trinity,with the important caveat that for creatures this state is not one of nature,but of character. Just as Origen modifies the Stoic notion of successiveworlds for his own purpose, so he combats the trend of increasing theseparation between the sensible and suprasensible worlds, which found itsfullest expression in the Pleroma and Kenoma of the Gnostics.Origen seems to have these Gnostic realms in mind when he points outthat such an incorporeal world is ‘strange to our manner of speaking’ andhe opposes the view that the Saviour comes from it or that the Saints returnto it.96This, at first sight, appears to break with the Platonic distinctionbetween two realms, but discussions of such realms can be traced backto misunderstanding Greek statements concerning the Forms. However,it is clear from the Origenian conception of the noetic cosmos that itwould be untenable for the Saints to return to the realm of the Forms,when this is contained within the Son-Logos, which in turn is containedin the Father. For Origen, the world of which the Saviour speaks is thesuprasensible one and is evidently different from its material counterpart,but this does not preclude a clearly-defined relationship between the two,‘suggesting to us that the whole universe of that which is and exists, ofcelestial and supracelestial, terrestrial and infernal, forms in a general sensea single perfect world, in which and by which the others, if these exist, arecontained’.97Here Origen again raises the possibility of other worlds, this time existingsimultaneously. I do not think that he is seriously prepared to countenancethis view, although it is possible that there are other worlds into whichman cannot cross ([ii.3.6] where he cites Clement as his authority), butthese cannot properly be regarded as independentcosmoi. It is essential forOrigen’s conception of the Demiurge that the entire cosmos can be viewedas a logical system.This raises the question of the longevity of the world:Sane hoc quod dicunt quidam de hoc mundo, quoniam corruptibilis quidemest ex eo quod factus est, nec tamen corrumpitur, quia corruptione fortior96Princ.ii.3.697Princ.ii.3.6.262–7"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"274Origen, the Demiurge and Christian theologyac validior est voluntas dei, qui fecit eum et continet illum, ne ei corruptiodominetur, rectius ista sentire possunt de eo mundo, quamἀπλανῆspheramsupra diximus, quia ex voluntate dei nequaquam corruptioni subiaceat,pro eo quod nec causas corruptionis accepit.

In effect, thisworld belongs to the saints, to those who have been completely purified andnot to the impious, like our world. (ii.3.6.295–304)Origen borrows the distinction of theTimaeusbetween what is immortaland what is merely everlasting at the pleasure of the Demiurge. Here, ofcourse, the world cannot be, strictly speaking, everlasting, since it willultimately give way to a superior sort of world, but it is capable of fallinginto disorder, although it is unclear how exactly it is maintained by theWill of God. There is no hint that God’s Will has to engage in geometryor in continual temporal creation, intervening in favour of order, as is thecase with the Plutarchean Demiurge, rather, it seems that the Will of Godsimply forbids decay to set in and protects the world by His continualcare.Atiii.5.3.59–66, Origen raises the question of what God was doing beforethe creation of the world.98Although Origen suggests that He is involved inthe construction of successive worlds, he does not consistently maintain thisview.99Origen follows in the Platonist tradition (and himself set the agenda98Sed solent nobis obicere dicentes: Si coepit mundus ex tempore, quid ante faciebat deus quammundus inciperet? Otiosam etiam et immobilem dicere naturam dei impium est simul et absur-dum, vel putare quod bonitas aliquando bene non fecerit et omnipotentia aliquando non egeritpotentatum.

One constantly makes this objection to us when we saythat the world began at a certain time and when we consider the years and the duration accordingto the accounts of Scripture. (cf.Princ.i.4.5)99Cum visibilem istum mundum fecit deus, coepit operari, sed sicut post corruptionem huius eritalius mundus, ita et antequam hic esset, fuisse alios credimus.‘It is not when God created this visible world that He began to work, but just as after the destructionof this world there will be another, even so before this world existed, there were, we believe, others.’(iii.5.3.70–3)."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Creation,apokatastasisand the material realm275for the Cappadocian Fathers) as regards his distinction between Time andEternity. The Trinity is eternal, so Origen points out that his claim that‘there never was a time when the Son never existed must be understoodwith indulgence’ (‘cum venia’). Like Plato, he laments the difficulty ofdescribing the divine with inadequate language; here temporal vocabulary‘temporalis vocabuli’.100God, like Plato’s Demiurge, exists outside time andlanguage can only refer to him in a tenseless kind of way, which in itself isimpossible for language. Before Aquinas, Origen expresses the same notionwith reference to the God of the Christians; it is not appropriate to say thatHe is everlasting, rather He exists outside time. Time itself only came intobeing with the creation of the cosmos.Scholars are divided on the issue of whether Origen really envisages thepossibility of successive worlds as the result of further falls.101His own worksare contradictory and he even adopts opposed positions within the samework.102Stefan Svendsen has extensively analysed the reasons which con-tribute to Origen’s vacillation.103If free will continues after theapokatastasis(which Origen has to believe in order to avoid strict determinism), thenthere could always be the possibility of a future fall.104However, Svendsenobserves, if future falls take place, God would be guilty of unnecessarysuffering in allowing humans to lead ‘painful lives’ in the material realm,which could only be justified on the grounds that they would be purifiedfrom sin, while all along He would have known that this response on Hispart would not prevent this.105If there are repeated falls, it seems to me thatit would make creation pointless, rather like the situation in Gnosticism,since the whole point of creation becomes the attempt to undo it.In order to avoid the determinism that the alternative theory wouldnecessitate, Svendsen suggests that Jesus’ ‘perfection of love’, whichprevented Him from falling, will characterise the other souls afterapokatastasis.106This would ensure that free will remains, but ensures that100Princ.iv.4.1.34–43101For example Bigg, Dani ́elou and Crouzel are opposed to successive falls, but their view is by nomeans unanimous.102Svendsen points toPrinc.ii.66andiii.66as well as CCels.vi.20withiv.69.103I am grateful to Dr Stefan Svendsen for raising this issue with me during the course of a seminarat the University of Copenhagen, which has led me to reconsider views on this issue expressedelsewhere (O’Brien:2007a,174), as well as for providing me with a copy of his research data‘Origen and the Possibility of Future Falls’.104Svendsen’s argument places Origen’s views within the context of ancient speculations concerningfate and human autonomy.105Svendsen, S.

Origen is not actually the inventor of the Christianisedversion ofapokatastasis: it is found in Clement and the Greek-EthiopicApocalypse of Peter, although Origen developed the concept.109Since Ori-gen posits a temporal beginning to the cosmos, he also accounts for theend; unlike Plato he does not envisage an everlasting cosmos. Origen’s vac-illation on the issue, though, indicates discontentment with the solutionwhich he had proposed.Origen uses the termκαταβολήto refer to creation, which he etymolo-gises as a ‘throwing down towards the lower regions’. This passage, thoughevidently referring to the fall of souls, makes God a much more active agentthan the idea of a fall would normally suggest. It seems less that the soulsfell, than that they were cast out, but this might also refer to the mannerin which the Son-Logosinforms the substrate with Forms from the noeticrealm by a sort of ‘throwing down’. This ‘throwing down’ produces twonatures (iii.6.6.222–36), the invisible, that of rational creatures, and thecorporeal, that of animals.Origen regards the stars (amongst which he includes the planets) as ratio-nal living beings, since they are capable of receiving the commandments ofGod, which Origen bases on the Biblical phrase ‘I ordered all the stars’.110For Origen, the stars have to be rational, since they exhibit order in theirmovements. He regards them as animate because the notion that soul isthe source of all motion had by this stage become commonplace. Whatis interesting is Origen’s focus on the rational design behind the rotationof the stars and planets. He breaks with Plato’s idea that the stars are thehabitations of human souls, while the planets are the heavenly gods, forobvious reasons. However, he still needs them to be ensouled, if he stillwishes to believe that they are alive, in order for the mechanics of thesituation to work. This leads him to argue that stars are a separate orderof living being, which accept some sort of material body in order to beof service to men. For Origen, the stars are intermediate beings betweenangels and men.1071Cor.13:8108Comm. Jn.x.42; trans. Tzamalikos.109Cf.

God made two great lights, a larger one to govern the day and a smallerone to govern the night, as well as the stars. So then God did not create thesoul together with the bodies, nor did he insert it from the outside, once thebody was created. I myself suspect that the soul is inserted from the outside,but it seems a worthy task to demonstrate this from Scripture.I find this account fascinating, but the whole notion proved to beproblematic for Origen, since the Church condemned the notion that thestars were alive. The above passage points out that the soul is older thanthe body as in theTimaeus, and both are constructed separately. The ideaof the insertion from outside is particularly interesting, since the stars seemto exist at some point without corporeality. However, it is necessary to becautious, since Rufinus may usespiritushere to translateνοῦςrather thanπνεῦμα(although he usually translatesνοῦςbymensoranimus), so thiscannot be taken as a conclusive affirmation of the pre-existence of souls.The stars are material, although their bodies are composed of aether.111Whereas in conventional Platonic thought the variety of rational beingscomes about through the instantiation of all possibilities (irrespective ofwhether or not these possibilities are also produced by the Demiurge), forOrigen the devil, demons, man, the saints, the stars and the angels all havethe same divine origin; it is only as a result of the choices that they makethat they become enmattered in a specific way.Animals, however, are the result of a secondary creation; they are dis-tinguished from the reasonable natures which possess free will and soul.112They merely possess visible nature, and no invisible element; being nothingmore than a modification of matter, not the insertion of a soul into a mate-rial form. Origen was opposed to the Platonic notion of metempsychosis.No matter how far a soul falls, it will still be implanted into a rationalanimal (although this includes demons), but it will not be implanted intoanimals for the sake of punishment. According toselPs.1(PG12,1081orPhiloc.ii.51), it is not possible to understand why there are so many fero-cious animals.

Since this part of creationis completely under his control, it would seem that it should be perfect.Though other thinkers such as Justinian see in them a positive value, sincethey inculcate virtues such as courage, Origen does not trouble himselfwith the question.It seems that matter is capable of preventing union in the godhead,since God is incorporeal, but Christ takes a material form, and it seemsthat the godhead must remain in what is to some extent a state of disunity,until the suppression of Christ’s human body. However, just like Plato andunlike the Gnostics, who also see in matter a threat to the unity of thegodhead, Origen is positive concerning the human body.Even though the material world is not ideal, Origen still admires thephysical instantiation of Man since it is capable of becoming somethingmuch greater: ‘a very subtle, very pure and very resplendent body’ (quali-tatem sublatissimi et purissimi ac splendidissimi corporis).113Indeed, Ori-gen stresses that the substrate is capable of being informed by God withall possibilities from the noetic realm and seems almost to regret the lossin diversity that the dissolution of the world will entail.114The referenceto matter ‘delivering itself ’ to the Father ‘in complete readiness to thedifferent aspects and kinds of things which He accomplished on it, sinceHe is its lord and creator, in order that He could draw from it the diverseforms of celestial and terrestrial beings’ echoes a Middle Platonist notionobservable in Plutarch (and picked up by the Neoplatonists also); that ofworld-generation from below, since matter wants to be ordered and mayeven play a role in demiurgy by ordering itself in response to the inherentorder of the One.115The soul of ChristAtPrinc.ii.6.3.106–14, Origen expresses the relationship between bothrealms in terms which suggest the influence of Plato’sTim.35a:Hac ergo substantia animae inter deum carnemque mediante (non enimpossibile erat dei naturam corpori sine mediatore misceri) nascitur, ut dix-imus, deus-homo, illa substantia media existente, cui utique contra nat-uram non erat corpus assumere.

If the final absorp-tion of the human nature into the divine one in which God is all in allcould be accused of monophysitism, then this section could be accused ofNestorianism, (which propounded the view that Christ had two separatenatures, one human and the other divine). Origen commences a discussionon the soul, but goes on to discuss the nature of Christ. Origen seems tostray away from divine mediation and on to considering how the soul ofChrist could reconcile both human and divine elements. The problem isthat he actually could be construed as positing two Christs.116It seems that the substance of the soul is in some way akin to God,since it was capable of containing God. There is a parallel between theinterrelation of Christ and His human soul in Origen and the assumptionof the psychic Christ by the Valentinians. However, while psychic Christis abandoned by the Saviour prior to his death (Excerpta ex. Theodoto615),Christ’s human soul for Origen remains connected to theLogos.Thisisinteresting metaphysically, since the human soul of Christ, which is to acertain extent the Origenian World-Soul, is actually an integral part ofGod’s Word. Unfortunately, it does not shed any further light on how thehuman soul first came to be. However, the question of God’s soul is not sosimple and needs to be interpreted allegorically. Just as His arms, legs andeyes actually are allegorical references [ii.8.5.204ff.], so too is His soul: ‘justas the soul inserted in all of the body makes everything move and worksand accomplishes all things, even so the only Son of God, His Word andHis Wisdom, reaches and brings to all the power of God, because He isinserted.’117For Origen, then, God is not soul. He does not even have one (or to bemore precise, the Father does not have one, although theLogosdoes). Byplacing the Son in the same relation to the Father as soul to Man, Origenprovides a hint of his conception of how the Father–Son relationship workson a demiurgic level. Just as the soul mediates between the mind and the116A charge from which he was defended by Pamphiluscf.Apol.vi.5,TPG1.7.586,Exc.ex Theod.58,Iren.,Adv Haer.i.6.1.117Princ.ii.8.5"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"280Origen, the Demiurge and Christian theologybody (being inferior to Mind), the Son mediates between God and theworld (but is beneath the Father). The parallel works outside the realm ofOrigen’s metaphysics, applying also to his soteriology; the descent of theSon to earth parallels to some extent the fall of the soul.The limits of demiurgic knowledgeAtPrinc.ii.9.1, it seems that Origen recommences a rambling view ofcreation, summarising points that he has already raised, although he isnow concerned with the extent of demiurgic wisdom. Since for Origen,that which is infinite is by nature unknowable and since God in orderto create everything must know it, then, from the beginning, there mustonly be a finite number of creatures, all of which owe their existence toGod. This argument seems perfectly reasonable, with its focus not only ondemiurgic limitations, but equally on the manner in which, for creation tobe understood, even by God, it must be embraced within these limits. Thenotion was attacked in Justinian’sLetter to Menas:118‘And he (Origen) addsto his blasphemies that which follows in the first volume on the followingprinciples.’ What is this first book of which Justinian speaks? We are alreadyin the second book, but Justinian must have made an error, since he goeson to say: ‘The power of God the Father is limited according to the secondvolume of the same book.’ Justinian then provides a quotation of the textin Greek, which, for the sake of comparison, I include in the footnotesalongside Rufinus’ translation.119118Mansi:1758–98,489–525119Justinian’s quotation:Just.

For if the power of God were unlimited, it would necessarily be unable to intelligiseitself. For the unlimited is by nature uncircumscribed.

In the first instance, the Greek citation may notbe completely trustworthy. The phraseἐὰν γὰρ...ἑαυτὴν νοεῖνis notcontained in the fragment of theflorilegia, although its omission is perhapsindicated by the phraseκαὶ μετ’ὀλίγα.120According to Koetschau, theRufinian text runs as far asincompraehensibile erit.In any case, the evidence of both passages reveals that creation is not infi-nite: Origen is frequently accused of asserting that the infinite is unknow-able, even by God, and that his power is finite, since otherwise he cannotunderstand it.121God cannot control an infinite number of beings.122Undersuch a system, the quantity of matter would in a sense be pre-determined,since God can only control a certain defined quantity and there is in anycase need only for a sufficient amount to enmatter all the souls which willbe created. This would make God the Father akin to James Clerk-Maxwell’scalculating demon – read in this light, he would be a mathematician, ratherthan a divinity. If matter is created by God, there seems to be no reasonwhy He cannot control it, no matter how great the quantity. Secondly,the fact that God cannot control an infinite quantity of matter ultimatelyappellandae sunt quas mentes superius diximus, fecisse deum, quantum sufficere posse prospexit.Certum est enim quod praedefinito aliquo apud se numero eas fecit: non enim, ut quidam vol-unt, finem putandum est non habere creaturas, quia ibi finis non esti, nec conpraehensio ulla velcircumscriptio esse potest.

In this beginning, must one suppose that there was such a number of rationalor intellectual creatures or whatever they are to be called, which we called minds above, createdby God as He saw to be sufficient. It is certain that they were made in accordance with a fixednumber, which he himself prescribed. For one must not suppose, as some have, that there wasan unlimited number of creatures, since this could be neither understood nor delineated. Forif it was (infinite), what has been made could be neither encompassed nor regulated by God.For whatever is infinite by nature is incomprehensible. Furthermore, Scripture also says thatGod has organised the universe in accordance with number and measure and for this reason;Number will be applied appropriately to both rational creatures or minds, in order that theymight be so many, that they might be arranged and ruled and contained by the providence ofGod.’120Crouzel and Simonetti:1978,211121iii.5.2.48–58122Princ.ii.9.1"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"282Origen, the Demiurge and Christian theologymakes it the source of evil, even though it is envisaged as unintelligible anddisorderly, and places blame for its creation upon God.The claim that Origen believed that divine knowledge was finite is partlybased upon the Justinian passage quoted above which Koetschau inserted atPrinc.ii.9.1(=Koetschau Fr.24), a reason advanced by Koetschau for dis-missing it. However, at the very point where this fragment was inserted byKoetschau, Origen comments that what is infinite is beyond comprehen-sion. Rufinus’ translation (quoted in note119, along with the passage fromJustinian) downplays the blasphemous overtones of the Greek version. Theissue of God not comprehending what is infinite does not appear so prob-lematic, as Rufinus’ translation goes on to state: ‘it is necessary to believethat everything was created by God in such a quantity that He knew wouldbe sufficient for ordering the world. Therefore it is necessary to imaginethat all of this was created by God at the beginning, that is to say beforeeverything.’123Origen argues that this is hinted at in the Biblical referenceto the creation of heaven and sky. Fortunately, the Rufinian text managesto allay some of the worries that one might have after reading Justinian’sversion, and this might reflect a deliberate alteration. Justinian’s accountruns contrary to Origen’s statement atCCels.iii.77that God is ‘infinite’.The world is finite since it was generated and it is directed towards an end,therefore divine knowledge is of what is finite, since only the Trinity isinfinite and its knowledge is without limit.124I agree also that the quantity of matter must be finite, but only becausea finite quantity is needed, since it will all be used up in demiurgy, withnothing to spare. The argument that Origen posits in the Greek versionseems to be one of the weakest which he could have fielded to make thisparticular point. It seems that Origen, in light of views expressed elsewhere,had been unduly influenced by the negative view of matter expressed withinthe Platonic tradition.125Not only are rational creatures created by God, but they also havea beginning [ii.9.2.31–6]. Again this differs from conventional wisdomconcerning the Demiurge, since having a temporal beginning rules out thepossibility of continued temporal creation, although of course this couldstill be the case in the noetic realm. Origen adopts a much more Platonist123Princ.ii.9.1.21–5: . . . quam utique tantam a deo creatam esse credendum est, quantam sibi sciretad ornatum mundi posse sufficere. Haec ergo sunt, quae in initio, id est ante omnia, a deo creataesse aestimandum est.124selPs,144,PG12.673125Plato,Tim.49; Aristotle,Physicsiii.6.206b.25ff., Plutarch (regarding exhaustion of materialresources)QC718a, Numenius as quoted by EusebiusPraep.

Thecause of the diversity amongst reasonable natures results from their ownchoice, which drags them down as a result of their own negligence.Aside from Origen’s typical stress on the damning effects of free will,which in his philosophy takes the place of the recalcitrance of matter as theroot of all evil, of note here is the stress on God’s goodness as the reason forthe creation of the world, just as is the case atTim.29e. Origen does not havethe Platonic insistence on God’s desire to enact His goodness in materialcreation. Rather, the material realm is a second-best option, after createdsouls exercising their free will reject the superior kind of existence whichHe has provided. God then creates the world as a result of compassiondue to the fall of the soul, rather like the case in the creation-account ofthe tenth-century Islamic philosopher, Muhammad ibn Zakariy ̄aal-R ̄az ̄ı.(Al-R ̄az ̄ı propounds the belief that the soul became so enamoured withmatter, it sought unity with it in order to indulge in bodily pleasures. Godthen is compelled to come to the aid of the soul by creating the materialworld.)127However, God’s creation is not limited in any way, by matteror by any other factor; it is exactly as he envisages through his divineforeknowledge.Here God creates everything in His likeness, which is why all entitiesare equal at the outset. Yet if some creatures fall further than others due tothe choices made according to their character, then surely God could beheld responsible for giving some a nature more susceptible to corruptionthan others. However, atii.9.6.198–212, Origen attempts to rebut a possiblecharge of divine favouritism by adopting the Stoic view of the cosmos asa house for human and divine inhabitants, which not only contains goldand silver vases, but also those of wood or earth. God governs all of thesecreatures according to their merits. Therefore God cannot be blamed forany injustice in the lot that falls to individuals, while at the same time,the treatise constitutes an anti-Gnostic attack by showing how, in spite ofa combination of positive and negative elements, God has still created aharmonious world. As Origen points out atiii.1.21.699–706,avaseofahumbler material can ultimately turn into one of gold; it is not created inthis way by God, but merely becomes so as the result of its own choices.126Princ.ii.9.6.183–98127Fakhry:1968,18.Cf.

Thetreatise was composed, as it seems, at the request of Ambrosius, in responseto Celsus’True Logos, an attack on Christianity. It seems strange thatOrigen should have composed such a defence: Celsus was dead by thisstage, asTrue Logoshad been composed seventy to eighty years previously,but the fact that it was still in circulation may have worried Christians likeAmbrosius. Origen uses the opportunity not only to defend Christianityfrom Celsus’ portrayal of it as a threat to Graeco-Roman values (includingthe belief that religion should be open to rational examination), but alsoto criticise the opinions of other (less sophisticated) Christians.Perhaps one of the most striking comments ofContra Celsumis thereference ati.19.1–9to the fact that the world is less than ten thousandyears old, according to the account of Moses, which leaves one wonder-ing how Origen was capable of such great precision in determining thedate of creation.128Ati.23.16–24, Origen affirms the unity of the creator,on the grounds that the world enjoys good order (κατὰ τὴν εὐταξίαντοῦ κόσμου) and harmony, and this could not be the work of multipleDemiurges.129This helps to stress the unity of purpose of the persons inthe Trinity. Ati.23.24–30, Origen further stresses the unity of God, thistime drawing upon a Stoic argument; the totality of God is not reducibleto the sum of his parts,130while His existence is proved by the existence oforder in the created world.TheContra Celsumcontinues theDe Principiis’ portrayal of Christ aseffectively a second God, and the unnamed assistant of God in the creationof man, described atGenesis:ἐγκαλοῦμεν οὖν ̓Ιουδαίοις τοῦτον μὴ νομίσασι θεόν,ὑπὸ τῶν προφητῶνπολλαχοῦ μεμαρτυρημένον ὡς μεγάλην ὄντα δύναμιν καὶ θεὸν κατὰ τὸντῶν ὅλων θεὸν καὶ πατέρα.Τούτῳ γάρ φαμεν ἐν τῇ κατὰ Μωϋσέα κοσ-μοποιΐᾳ προστάττοντα τὸν πατέρα εἰρηκέναι τό·‘Γενηθήτω φῶς’καὶ‘Γενηθήτω στερέωμα’καὶ τὰ λοιπά,ὅσα προσέταξεν ὁ θεὸς γενέσθαι,καὶ τούτῳ εἰρηκέναι τό·‘Ποιήσωμεν ἄνθρωπον κατ’εἰκόνα καὶ ὁμοίωσινἡμετέραν’.128One is reminded of Archbishop James Ussher’s attempt inAnnales veteris testamenti a prima mundiorigine deducti(‘Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world’,1650),to calculate the date of creation, which he fixed at the night before Sunday23October4004bc.129CCels.i.23.16–24130Cf.Sext.Emp.,Adv.

To Him, He said ‘Let us makeMan in our image and likeness’. (ii.9.29–36)The translation ‘a god beneath God’ is problematic, and is not acceptedby all scholars as it creates a problem of subordination. Other possibleinterpretations are ‘gem ̈ass’ [Koetschau], ‘like’ [Chadwick], ‘par l’order de’[Bouh ́ereau] and ‘secundo loco post’ [Thuillier]. I am grateful for Dillon’ssuggestion of ‘in the train of ’ or ‘coordinated with’, since the Son is God’sunnamed assistant during creation: ‘To him, He said “let us make Manin our image and likeness”.’ In any case, it is clear that Origen viewsChrist, as a production of the Father, as in some way beneath Him, andno particular interpretation of this passage can avoid addressing that fact,just as in theDe Principiis, Christ, as theLogos, is God’s instrument duringcreation.131Origen explicitly affirms the superiority of the Father: ‘the Sonis not more powerful than the Father, but He is inferior to Him’ (τὸν υἱὸνοὐκ ἰσχυρότερον τοῦ πατρὸς ἀλλ’ὑποδεέστερον). This is based on thestatement that ‘the Father who sent me is greater than I’.132In general terms, there is little point in discussing at length all passagesrelating to demiurgy inContra Celsum. To a great extent, they merely echosentiments expressed much more fully in thePeri Archˆon. However, thereare some exceptions.

Itis not worthy of God to not stop the diffusion of vice by a renewal of things.The Greeks themselves know that the earth is periodically purified by floodand by fire, as Plato says: ‘Whenever the gods, in order to purify the earth,submerged it under water, those in the mountains’ etc. Is it then necessaryto say that, while the Greeks affirm it, it merits respect and consideration,but when we ourselves establish some of these doctrines, which the Greeksapprove, they lose all their value? (iv.20.11–22)As Origen states ativ.21.24–38, the example of Sodom and Gomor-rah reveals the partial destruction of the cosmos. However, here we arestraying away from metaphysics, since Origen expressesekpyrosisin escha-tological terms. This is because of the context in which theContra Celsumwas composed. Origen represents Christianity as prefigured within theGraeco-Roman intellectual tradition, rather than as a religion which isalien. Interestingly, partial destruction is caused by sin, while completedestruction (in the sense of the dissolution of the created world) occursdue to the final salvation of all rational creatures. For Origen, this destruc-tion is due to a continual law of retribution inherent in the nature of things,not a temporary loss of emotional control on the part of the Demiurge.This comes across when he attacks Celsus’ misreading of the prologue tothe Flood, when God is said to repent of His creation.133Origen also defends the account of creation atGenesisagainst Celsusativ.37. Celsus ridicules the description of man’s creation, where he ispresented as modelled by the hands of God, and the notion that Godbreathed into Man. Origen counters by pointing out that Celsus does133CCels.iv.72"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Conclusion287not understand the symbolic sense of the passage, since God should notbe envisaged as possessing a form similar to our own. The descriptionof God breathing into his creation is also symbolic; God passing on theincorruptible spirit to Man. For Origen, as for Plato, God is the creatoronly of what is immortal (including the soul), whereas what is mortal hasbeen created by secondary, immortal creators.134From what is said here,it appears that animals are the work of the angels. Origen elsewhere seesthem as the result of a secondary creation.135The mortal creatures thatOrigen is referring to here in any case seem to be corporeal bodies, ratherthan animals. Origen may be hinting at Rabbinic doctrine that the bodyof man was made by the angels. He is certainly drawing upon Platonicthought.136However, it seems that he is getting carried away with the forceof his own polemic, since ativ.54.23–45he again affirms his general viewthat there cannot be multiple Demiurges, but everything must have beencreated by a single one, who created the distinctions between the differentvarieties of created being. They are all composed from the same matterwhich continues to underlie (ὑποκειμένη,iv.56.10) the created world.TheContra Celsumalso expresses some remarks concerning divine Prov-idence. It is responsible for everything that is good, but not for anythingevil [CCels.vii.68.31–7]. Origen presents it as a hypostasis of God theFather: it is ‘like a divine power which embraces everything which it con-tains’ (ἀλλ’ὡς δύναμις θεία καὶ περιειληφυῖα τὰ περιεχόμενα).137DivineProvidence regulates the entire universe by permeating it. It is responsiblefor the creation of individuals who turn to evil (rather than evil individuals)so that it can subsequently save them (vi.56.1–24). This may appear to bea thoroughly pointless exercise, but it is all part of the divine plan, sinceby doing this God is purifying souls, and possibly preventing them frommaking immoral choices in the future.ConclusionOrigen stands at the juncture of the Platonic and Christian traditions,a fact which is reflected in his account of demiurgy. He presents a realalternative to the Middle Platonist tradition, although at the same time134CCels.iv.52.11–12:...ὁ θεὸς οὐδὲν θνητὸν ἐποίησεν:ἀλλα θεοῦ μὲν ἔργα ὅσα ἀθάνατα,θνητὰδ’ἐκεινων, . . . ‘God made nothing that is mortal, but all the immortal beings are the works ofGod, and the mortal beings are their works’.135Princ.iii.6.7136E.g.Tim.69c–d; Alcinous,Didask.8, Atticus ap.

HisLogoscollaborates with the Father in a much more effectiveand dynamic way, for the purposes of demiurgy, than the Numenian FirstGod collaborates with the Second, making both principles truly creators.However, understanding Origen’s thought is problematic, since it has beensubjected to varying degrees of misrepresentation by his opponents.In spite of his opposition to the Gnostics, his motivation of creationleaves it as inherently evil for creatures, rather than merely pointless. AsSt Thomas observed, under this system corporeal creatures have no goalother than to atone for the consequences of sin; they were not createdto participate in the bounty of the Lord.141Such an interpretation maybe rather harsh on Origen and may unduly strain his meaning. (Onecould refute this claim by pointing out that God creates non-corporealintelligences for no reason other than Himself and his own goodness.142Creation has a point if the end will be such a perfection of love that rationalintelligences will not turn to sin again). After all, God does place Man atthe centre of the universe, since the current cosmos will be dissolved onceall rational creatures will be saved; although logically it would indicate thatthe devil has the power to dissolve the created universe, since presumablyhe will be the last to be saved. Origen attempts to avoid the extremeconsequences of his doctrine, as presented by St Thomas. This is evincedby his interpretation of St Paul’s words: ‘Creation has been subjected tovanity, not of its own desire, but by the wish of him who submitted it, inthehopethatitwillbesaved.’143This line was one of the great Biblicalbastions of the Valentinians. Yet creation has greater purpose for Origenthan for Valentinus; it results from the gift of free will, not from a splitwithin the godhead itself.138As he says atCCels.vii.45.6(in relation to Celsus’ use of the image of the Sun and Line of theRepublic): ‘We are careful not to raise objections to good teaching, even if the authors are outsidethe faith.’139‘He (Christ) is the image of his goodness and a ray, not of God, but of his glory and of his eternallight and a breath, not of the Father but of his power, an unsullied emanation of his almightyglory, and an untarnished mirror of his activity (energeia). The mirror through which Peter andPaul and their like see God.’ (Comm. Jn.13.251–31Preuschen)140Dunamisis the middle term in the Chaldean version of an intelligible triad.

(Stockhausen wasinfluenced by Gnosticism, which he encountered viaThe Urantia Book).1However, its importance as a philosophical concept declined with theemergence of Neoplatonism, which propounded an alternative model forgenerating the physical cosmos, while still remaining loyal to the essentialelements of Platonism in drawing a distinction between the suprasensibleand phenomenal realms.Essentially one can claim that the Plotinian model is midway betweenDarwinianism and Deism, or as Dillon puts it in terms of an ancient per-spective, between that of an atomistic generation, such as that advancedby Democritus, and the model of the Demiurge that we find in Plato’sTimaeus.2The concept of the Demiurge effectively reached its postscriptwith the emergence of this new generational model propounded by Ploti-nus. However, Plotinus still shares sufficient similarities with Numenius tohave been accused of having plagiarised his predecessor, a situation which1This text is supposed to have been received in a series of trances from1934–5by Wilfred C.

While theclassic response of Middle Platonism had been to propose some sort ofduality, Plotinus responded in terms of radical monism. Just as the Mid-dle Platonists reduced the principles from three to two, he reduced themfurther. Everything owed its existence to the One. While the Demiurgepresumably needs to produce in order to be regarded as a Demiurge (andthere is evidence to this effect in theTimaeus, where he has to ensure thatevery aspect of the intelligible realm is instantiated in its physical coun-terpart, or in Plutarch’sQuaestiones Convivales, where he must continuallyengage in geometry), the One does not require his productions.Plotinus describes this generative process in terms of the radiation oflight in diminishing degrees. This has often been referred to inaccuratelyas emanation. In fact, this implies that the process is one way, whereas inreality it consists of two stages: ‘procession’ and ‘creative contemplation’.Plotinus is under no obligation to insulate his First Principle from what itproduces since it remains in its transcendent state, even when producing;although he acknowledges that the generated is always inferior to thegenerator (cf.v.4.[7]2.19;v5[32]5.1–7;vi9[9]3.45–9;vi9[9]9.1–7).4The One differs from the Demiurge in that it does not order; it sponta-neously produces a power which then orders itself in contemplation of theOne.5This is illustrated in the case ofNous; the One generates what canbest be described as intelligible matter, but in a formless state, althoughit shapes itself as a result of itsepistrophˆe, this becomes Intellect, whichin Plotinus’ system contains the world of the Forms.Enn.ii9[33]2.1–18highlights the unchangeability of this Intellect and connects it with theconstancy of soul, which, for Plotinus, has an undescended part ‘alwaysdirected to the intelligible realities’ and links it to the constancy of thecontemplative power.6(The intelligible matter which forms Intellect isdifferent from the sensible matter which is ordered to form the world).Proclus would later comment that (sensible) matter was not brought intoexistence by the Demiurge, based on his interpretation of PlatoTim.53d3–5and is perhaps ‘derived from another order of [causes], the one positioned3Vita Plotini174Dillon:2005b,2665Plotinus,Enn.v2[11]1.6,cf.v2[11]1.1–186Narbonne:2011,126–7"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"292Plotinus and the demise of the Demiurgeabove the Demiurge, whom he compares to a mother and father’,7addingthat ‘according to Plato, matter proceeds both from the One and fromthe Unlimitedness which is prior also to the One Being’,8a view whichNarbonne takes to be close to its Plotinian model.9Although this idea of anindeterminate production ordering itself under the influence of a superiorentity is alien to theTimaeus, where Necessity dominates the account ofworld-generation from below, it can be found in Plutarch’s account of Isisor indeed the Numenian Second God’s continual contemplation of theFirst.While the Demiurge’s production owes itself to his inherent goodnessand ungrudging nature, this is not the case with the One: ‘And all thingsproduce upon attaining perfection, and the One is always perfect and iteverlastingly produces and it produces what is less than itself ’ (v1[10]6.37–9). The One produces in the following manner: (1) everlastingly, (2)from inexhaustible reality (vi9[9]9.3–4), (3) without undergoing change(iii8[30]8.46–8), (4) without deliberation or desire to generate (v1[10]6.25–7,v3[49]12.28–33,cf.v5[32]12.43–9)and(5) without knowledgeof products (vi7[38]39.19–33). The One has generated all possibilities: ‘itis not possible now for anything to be generated. For since all things havebeen generated, there is nothing else which might come into being’ (v5[32]12.46–7).The subordinate hypostases are not produced from the substance ofthe First Principle, since it does not flow to them, rather from its power.Nousthen produces its own matter which, turning back to contemplateit, is generated as soul. At the extremity of this procession, the soul of theuniverse (which for Plotinus representsphysisor nature) generates sensiblematter.10Because of its distance ontologically from the One, it is unable tocontemplate nature and from its attempt to turn back the sensible realm isproduced.The Plotinian model, in a sense, stands midway between the twoextremes of demiurgy. It envisages no role for the element of planningprior to embarking on the world-production undertaken by the Demi-urge of Plato or of Philo, even though the portrayal of world-generationundertaken by the Intellectual-Principle in accordance with its vision ofthe Good might seem to resemble the production of the Demiurge inaccordance with the Forms.11Conversely, although the sensible world is7Proclus,In Tim.i384,19–385,13.

Rather, sensible matter isethically neutral (although Plotinus acknowledges that the soul’s obsessionwith the material world can be the cause of evil).Plotinus makes explicit the ontological status of his generative principle,unlike Plato. It is true that theTimaeusnever mentions any god superiorto the Demiurge, but equally it never identifies him with the Good oftheRepublic. Plotinus makes this identification explicit, referring to hissupreme principle as either the Good or the One depending upon thecontext. Although Plotinus denied the existence of demiurgy above thelevel ofNous, here I consider the One from the perspective of a generativeprinciple, as it is thefather of the cause(v1[10]8.5). While the Gnosticsprovide a detailed account of the Demiurge’s ancestry, and Plato nevertroubles to explain where he came from (a moot point, if he was onlyintroduced for ‘the purposes of exposition’), Plotinus specifies the originof the One: ‘(the Good) must not be classified as made, but as the makerand we must consider that his making is unconstrained’ (vi8[39]20.4–6), or ‘the One is the cause of itself’ (vi8[39]13.55,14.41;16.13–15).12Unlike the Demiurge, who even in Plato’sTimaeuswas of rather limitedresources, the One possesses infinite power to generate the suprasensiblerealm (v4[7]1.23–6,v5[32]10.18–23,vi9[9]6.10–12,ii4[12]15.17–20,cf.v5[32]11.1–2). However, Plotinus acknowledges that the analogiesused in his account of world-generation are inaccurate: ‘To say that it isthe cause is not to assert something accidental of it, but of us’ (vi9[9]3.49–50).The predominant trend of the negative association of matter was con-tinued by Plotinus, who regards matter as ‘evil itself ’ (i8[51]8.37–44,i8[51]13.21–5) and as responsible for evil in soul (i8[51]14). Although herefers to it as ‘non-being’ (II4[12]16.3,ii5[25]4–5), this is not a denialof its existence, but an assertion of how lowly on the ontological scale itranks (and it is therefore comparatively evil). While Numenius declaredthat matter was not derived from the supreme principle (Fr.52Des Places),Plotinus could not accept that since it would posit more than one FirstPrinciple and the relationship between the two would result from chance(i4[46]2.9–20). Matter is evil, for Plotinus, not because it is recalcitrant,but because of its lack of Form (i8[51]10,ii4[12]16.16–25,iii6[26]11.15–45), although this evil can be seen in terms of deficiency, rather thanas a positive principle (cf.i8[51]3.16,ii4[12]16.10–24,iii6[26]14.5–15).12Bussanich:1996,44"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"294Plotinus and the demise of the DemiurgeFor Plotinus, matter never really takes on Form; rather its relation to theForm it adopts is comparable to that between an object and its reflection(iii6[26]7.23–43,9.16–19,13.18–55). Plotinus does state that each soulis dependent upon an individual archetype (iv3[27]5,vi4[22]4.35–46), which is an easier transition for him to make than for Plato, sincehe regards the Forms as God’s thoughts, but he does note that it wouldbe ridiculous to postulate a separate Form of fire for each individual fire(vi5[23]8.39–46), though his position in this regard is ambivalent, sinceatv7[18], he entertains the possibility of Forms of individuals of somesort.13Plotinus moves away from the dualism of the preceding period; sincein his model of procession Form is adopted by the lower ranking entity inresponse to the One, it reflects poorly on matter that it should be unableto order itself, rather than on the One because he cannot order it. TheMiddle Platonist doctrine of the Forms as the thoughts of God has beenrehabilitated by Plotinus. He identifies the noetic realm with the LivingAnimal ofTimaeus30cff.(v9[5]9.3–8,vi2[43]21.53–9,vi6[34]7.14–19,vi7[38]8.27–32). For Plotinus, Forms are living intelligences (vi7[38]9.20) which do not require to be thought in order to exist (v9[5]7.11–18,vi6[34]6cf.Parm.132b–c). While Origen was at pains to maintain thatthe intelligible world had to be finite, since otherwise it would be unknowneven to God (De. Princ.Frs.24,38), Plotinus similarly does not posit aninfinite number of Forms, since he denies the existence of infinite number(vi6[34]2.1) and although Intelligence has no external limitations, onceit adopts Form, it imposes limitation upon itself (vi6[34]18,vi7[38]17.14–26,33.7–12).Plotinus’ model breaks with the traditional one of demiurgy, since heno longer views the generative principle as partaking in Being, as hadbeen the case with the Demiurge of theTimaeus. This had to some extentbeen anticipated by Numenius in his identification of Being with theFirst Principle, rather than with the Demiurge, or in the position of theDemiurge in the Gnostic and Hermetic traditions. However, in thesesystems the modification has the opposite effect; the creative principle isdemoted. Plotinus, by moving away from the demiurgic model and linking13The problem is that if there is no Form of an individual, it excludes the individual from theintelligible world and prevents him having knowledge of it. The Forms here, though partly intendedto be Forms of individual souls, are embodied in an infinite series of particular physical individuals(v7[18]1.13–18). To avoid positing an infinity of ideas, the same model can function for an infinityof individuals, each of which is reincarnated (according to the doctrine of metempsychosis) at adifferent period."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The disappearance of the Demiurge295the supreme power with the demiurgic principle, raises the status of world-generation. Simultaneously, he elevates the ontological status of his FirstPrinciple by placing it beyond Being (iii8[30]10.26–35). The realm of theOne is not a mere blueprint for the intelligible world, in the manner inwhich it serves as the paradigm for the phenomenal realm; rather it is itssource.Such an exalted principle can still be responsible for generating every-thing else in Plotinus’ system, since the product is always less than theproducer.14For Plotinus, there is no need to posit an instrument whichthe One requires to order to produce (iii8[30]2.1–15;v9[5]6.20–4). However, Plotinus does posit a succession of Hypostases, which aregenerated before sensible matter is reached. Additionally, the One nevercontemplates the lower entities, but concentrates its attention upon itself.Generation is a spontaneous process caused when the energy generated bythis contemplation overflows (iii8[30]3–4).Plotinus is opposed to the notion of demiurgy, since regarding world-generation as having been preceded by deliberation would imply hesitation,which would lead one to locate doubt and ignorance in the godhead. ForPlotinus, every aspect of the generative process occurs in the only possibleway, because it is the best possible way (iv4[28]12,v7[18]1.21–5). Plotinusvocalises his opposition to demiurgy atEnn.iv3[27]10.13–19andiv4[28]11, where he points out that the activity of the divine hypostases ismore akin to the spontaneous processes of nature than the deliberations ofhuman craftsmen.15He does, however, make a concession to theTimaeusby acknowledgingthat the world is as good as if it had been planned with the best divinereasoning (iii2[47]14.1–6;vi2[43]21.32–8;vi7[38]1.28–32;vi8[39]17.1–12), although he argues, like the majority of Platonists, that fixinga temporal origin to the world should not be taken literally (iii2[47]1.20–6,iv3[27]9.16–20,vi7[38]3.1–9). This Plotinian generation iscontinual and it does not terminate with intelligence, but must continueto matter (iv8[6]6,v2[11]2.1–5), just as the sensible cosmos mustcontain all possible living creatures (Tim.30c–d,39e). This leads Plotinusto postulate the Principle of Plenitude: as many beings as possible and everykind of being, even though not all beings are equally good (ii9[33]13.1–5,25–33;iii3[48]3–4), but if they were, the universe itself would be lessperfect, just as with a work of art, which for the beauty of the whole may14One is reminded of the maxim later expressed by St. Thomas Aquinas as bonum diffusivum sui(‘The good diffuses itself ’).15Wallis:1972,62"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"296Plotinus and the demise of the Demiurgerequire elements that are less beautiful when considered in isolation (iii2[47]11).Interestingly, although Plotinus criticises the demiurgic model, the forceof it is such that he considers the generation of the cosmos in terms ofthe production of a work of art. While Christians or Platonists do nothave much choice about whether they are created or not, all entities inthe Plotinian system demonstrate some sort of creative volition; orderingthemselves in response to their contemplation of the One to the best oftheir ability. This leads Plotinus to conclude that every being seeks toreturn to its cause (iii8[30]7.15–18). Yet the metaphysical contemplationrequired to achieve this is not based upon looking upwards to the heavens,but contemplating oneself in order to revert to the cause (vi9[9]2.33–45,cf.ibid.7.29–33). This leads to the two phases of Neoplatonist generation:procession (prohodos) and reversion (epistroph ̄e).Plotinus also adapts theLogosto his system. However, he is influencedmore by the Stoic conception of theLogosas an entity regulating thesoul’s governance of the phenomenal realm, than the Platonic or Orige-nian sense in which it is a separate Hypostasis that aids in creation. TheLogos, for Plotinus, is a rational formative principle which proceeds fromIntellect.Now Mind, having given to matter something of itself wrought all thingscalmly and quietly. And it was thelogos(ordering principle) which flowedfrom Mind. For thelogosflows out from Mind and it always flows out as longas Mind is always present in the things that are . . . For the noetic is onlylogosand there could not be another one which is notlogos. If somethingelse were to come into being, it would be necessary that it is inferior tothe noetic cosmos and less thanlogosand not a type of matter. For that isdisorderly. So it is a mixture and the points at which it terminates are matterandlogosand it starts from soul presiding over the mixture, which we mustnot suppose to suffer evil as it administers this universe easily by means of asort of presence. (Enn.iii2[47]2.15–42)The notion of continual flowing here is reminiscent of Philo’s comparisonof theLogoswith the cupbearer of Zeus. TheLogos, despite the wide range ofmeanings which Plotinus bestows on the word, often refers to the relationof the Hypostasis to its source, products or both (iii2[47]2.15–42). Theterm is also used to refer to the causal principles in the divine mind; thesame sense in which Origen uses it (spermatikoi logoi,iii2[47]2.15–17;v9[5]6.20–4)."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Proclus297Another interpretationAccording to Anton, the decline in the importance of the Demiurge canto a certain extent be linked to the rise of theurgy in Platonic circles; therole of the artist-demiurge as the revealer of divine beauty is replaced bythe theurgist.16According to such a reading, Gnosticism would be responsi-ble for the decline of the Demiurge, since it was accompanied by an increasein the significance of theurgy. As Damascius states in hisCommentary onthe Phaedo:῞Οτι οἱ μὲν τὴν φιλοσοφίαν προτιμῶσιν,ὡς Πορφύριος καὶ Πλωτῖνος καὶἄλλοι πολλοὶ φιλόσοφοι·οἱ δὲ τὴν ἱερατικήν,ὡς ̓Ιάμβλιχος καὶ Συριανὸςκαὶ Πρόκλος καὶ οἱ ἱερατικοὶ πάντες.Some put philosophy first, such as Porphyry, Plotinus etc; others the priestlyart, as Iamblichus, Syrianus, Proclus and all the priestly school. (Damascius,In Platonis Phaedonem1, sect.172, trans. Dodds1963, xxii)Olympiodorus identified two stages in the development of Neoplatonictheurgy. In the first phase they began to conceptualise the demiurgic prin-ciple differently, exploring it dialectically.17Furthermore, since the Gnosticsdisassociated God from the sensible world, knowledge of him could notbe reached by contemplating the heavens, as it could for a Platonist. In theNeoplatonist concept of the world, the soul could only know thelogoiofthe World-Soul, but not any higher entity.The attraction of Anton’s theory lies in the charge that Gnosticism wasresponsible for the decline of the Demiurge. While he proposes that itis because of the increase of theurgy that Gnosticism promoted (as wellas the decline in the social importance of the artist), that demiurgy as aconcept fell from favour, by demoting the Demiurge’s ontological rank inthe first place, Gnosticism was further responsible for the decline of thedemiurgic concept. The social importance of the artist presumably playedless of a role, since it was not particularly elevated when Plato chose to usehis image.ProclusNumenius’ attempts to distinguish between a supreme principle and ademiurgic intelligence (Fr.16Des Places) is echoed by his Neoplaton-ist successors. Numenius (in his surviving work) leaves the Third God as16Anton:1992,1217Anton:1992,14"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"298Plotinus and the demise of the Demiurgesomething of a mystery; it appears to be a last vestige of the Platonic World-Soul, although since the Numenian Demiurge interacts with the phenome-nal realm in a more immediate fashion than his ancestors, the World-Soul’srole has disappeared.18Proclus identifies it with the cosmos, althoughNumenius himself regarded it as ‘generated’ (ποιήμα,δημιουργούμενον).19It would be wrong, however, to imply that Plotinus or his successorssimply did away with the Demiurge. He survives, though occupying a rolewithin a derivational, rather than demiurgic, model of world-generation.Additionally, the Neoplatonic systems tend to be more specific in delin-eating his ontological rank, not only identifying him withνοῦς,butinProclus’ case, equating each subdivision of demiurgy with a precise formof intelligence. Indeed, much was made in the period ofTim.39e:ᾗπερ οὖν νοῦς ἐνούσας ἰδέας τῷ ὃ ἔστιν ζῷον,οἷαί τε ἔνεισι καὶ ὅσαι,καθορᾷ,τοιαύτας καὶ τοσαύτας διενοήθη δεῖν καὶ τόδε σχεῖν.According, then, as Mind perceives forms existing in the living being, hethought it necessary that this world should contain these, as many as existthere.According to Proclus,In. Tim.ip.3061ff., Amelius read this as referringto a demiurgic triad: ‘he who is, he who possesses, and he who sees’ (ὁὤν,ὁἑχων,ὁρῶν,basedonὁ ἐστι ζῷον,ἐχούσαςandκαθορᾷ). Thisidea of a demiurgic triad is incorporated by Proclus into his metaphysi-cal system (although it was previously used by Iamblichus –In. Tim.1.p.308.18ff.). Proclus outlines his views on demiurgy in hisCommentary onthe Timaeus. He adopts the distinction drawn between the suprasensibleand phenomenal realms atTim.27d–28a ‘that which always is and whichdoes not have becoming and that which is always becoming but never is’,positing an increasing level of multiplicity as ontological levels becomemore remote from the One. When Plato prefaces his remarks on causa-tion byὑπ’αἰτίου τινός(Tim.28a4–6), Proclus takes this to mean that thedemiurgic cause is only one amongst several efficient causes (efficient isillustrated by the prepositionὑπό).20As the Demiurge is identified with Intellect, this places it third in theprimary Neoplatonist triad of Being, Life and Intellect. This accords, inci-dentally, with the function of the Demiurge. As he is the conduit betweenthe higher and sublunar realms, he requires proximity (ontologically) tothe physical world. Demiurgic activity needs to be mediated if the Intellect18On the basis ofIn. Tim.iiip.10.3.28ff., where it seems to represent the lower ‘dianoetic’ aspect ofthe Demiurge.Cf.

Proclus saw in Plato’s comments atTim.29a6,that the Demiurge is the best of causes, an assertion that it is superior tothe other forms of demiurgic causes. Opsomer has analysed in-depth thestructure of the intellective hebdomad,21which can be subdivided into twotriads and an entity that functions as a membrane separating the hebdomadfrom the other realms and providing internal divisions within its own heb-domad. (This echoes theὑπεζωκώςof theChaldean Oracles). The secondtriad duplicates the activity of the first, but at a less exalted level, therebyinsulating it from matter. As the first member of a Proclean triad is usuallyconcerned with inner activity and the Demiurge’s activity by its very natureneeds to be external, he cannot occupy this position. The second memberof a triad is typically associated with Life, though in theTimaeusaccount,the Demiurge is not principally associated with this, since he resorts to themixing-bowl to produce soul at41d4–5, but is able to impart intellect to theuniverse (30b4) by himself, so he logically occupies the third (intellective)position as intellective intellect.22Proclus draws upon thePhilebus’statement that royal soul and royalintellect pre-exist in Zeus to posit two separate roles for the intellectivetriad as the fatherly cause of eternal beings, but as the demiurgic cause ofmortal beings, with various distinctions drawn between the intermediaryentities, which have combined titles. The ‘father and maker’, therefore,(in which the fatherly element dominates) ranks above the ‘maker andfather’.Another distinction drawn by Proclus amongst the entities of his intel-lective hebdomad is amongst the four forms of demiurgic causes (TP5.13;in. Tim.i.310.18–24). It is the ‘one demiurge’ who produces universal beingsin a universal way (τῶν ὅλων ὁλικῶς δημιουργικοὶ αἲτιον), while the demi-urgic triad produces partial beings in a partial way (τῶν μερῶν ὅλικῶς), aMonad (Dionysos) produces universal beings in a partial way (τῶν ὅλωνμερικῶς), and the lower triad (the Titans) produces partial beings in apartial way (τῶν μερῶν μερικῶς)[in Tim.i.310.15–18]. Opsomer concludesthat the main distinction being drawn is not in terms of what is actuallybeing created, but between a universal and partial mode of creation.23Ashas been observed, the triads dealing with universal and partial demiurgy21Opsomer:2000,117ff.22Opsomer:2000,117. Dillon:1969discusses the four principal Neoplatonist theories concerning theontological rank of the Demiurge (those of Amelius Gentilianus, Porphyry, Iamblichus and Proclus,arising from open-ended interpretations of Plotinus,Enn.iii9[13]1, which itself was stimulatedby Plato,Tim.39e (and alsoTim.28c).23Opsomer:2000,119"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"300Plotinus and the demise of the Demiurgeexhibit the same internal structure. Unfortunately, the section of thePlatonic Theologywhich would have dealt with encosmic demiurgy (ifthis was actually composed) has been lost.The hypercosmic demiurgic triad (that responsible for the productionof parts in a universal way) finds Platonic authority in theGorgiasmythwith the division of Cronos’ kingdom between Zeus, Poseidon and Hades(523a3–5). Zeus is more than just one of the three rulers, who dividesthe world, but in his role as the sovereign ruler, he is also the universalDemiurge. The second Zeus is a lower Demiurge, but still part of thechain originating with the first Zeus. The hypercosmic-demiurgic triad isresponsible for existence, life and intellective reversion (the process wherebybeings turn towards the ontological level which precedes them), activitieswhich all exist causally in the universal Demiurge.24The problem Pro-clus faces in advocating such intermediary levels of demiurgy is not oneof ‘contaminating’ his Demiurge through proximity to matter, but oneof ‘declension’ (ὕφεσις), the decline of unity down through the ontolog-ical scale, which is why this hypercosmic triad is only responsible ‘forparts’.The first triad at the hypercosmic-encosmic level consists of the thirdZeus, second Poseidon and Hephaistos, who are ‘drawn into multiplicityby the Young Gods’ (TP6.15p.73.17–19), and who separate the uppertwo levels of Proclus’ four levels of demiurgy from the lower ones. Theyform an intermediate realm between the hypercosmic and encosmicdiakos-moi. Next follows the encosmic demiurgic gods, headed by Dionysus (aMonad), who ensures the unity of the cosmos at the ‘inner-worldly’ level.Dionysus represents the indivisible (held together by a totality) and divis-ible (a multitude of separable parts) nature of the universe. The encosmicDemiurges are Proclus’ equivalent of the Young Gods of theTimaeus.Dionysus is followed by a triad of Titans, who engage in partial demi-urgy. Dionysus himself, as noted above, produces universal beings in apartial way while the Titans produce partial beings in a partial way. Thepartial Demiurges also delegate some of their tasks to a plethora of lesserentities (such as heroes anddaimones). The main distinction betweenuniversal and partial demiurgy is that the universal Demiurge can pro-duce while remaining motionless (‘he remained in his own accustomednature’,Tim.42e5–6), while the encosmic demiurges produce through theiractivity.24Opsomer:2000,120"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Proclus301The identification of the first god of the hypercosmic-encosmic triadwith Dionysus has Orphic associations. It draws upon a tale in Orphicmythology, whereby the young Dionysus, placed upon his father’s throne,is torn to shreds by the Titans. The Titans are struck down by Zeus’thunderbolt in revenge, and the human race is reborn from their ashes,while Dionysus is reborn to Semele. This was interpreted as symbolisingDionysus’ divisible and indivisible nature (and by extension, as outlinedabove, the divisible and indivisible nature of the universe). His rebirthsymbolises the regeneration of the universe, while the birth of mankindfrom the ashes of the Titans represents the demiurgy of man. Proclus regardsthe Titans as identifiable with the celestial, aquatic and chthonic aspectsof Dionysus, paralleling these three divisions observable elsewhere. It isbeyond the scope of our analysis to comment in detail on these Procleanrefinements, beyond observing that in his attempts at job demarcation, thelesser Demiurges have their activities confined to a particular division of thecosmos. Such a tripartite division of demiurgy raises questions concerningits interrelation with the fourfold division which Proclus suggests elsewhere.For all its complexity, the essential distinction being drawn is that made byPlato himself atTim.41a, between the Demiurge and the Young Gods.As Opsomer notes, Proclus’ scheme displays the tension inherent intwo separate generative models; demiurgy and derivation.25Plotinus didnot draw such sharp distinctions between the primary hypostases, thoughequating the Demiurge with intellect, but transferring his activities to soul.Porphyry finalises this process in his system, where matter is ordered bysoul. The numerous intermediaries, then, inserted in Proclus’ demiurgicscheme are not solely insulation against the evil of matter, but preserve theimage of continuous transition.Proclus explains atPTv13p.42.14–22why he ranks the demiurgicfunction so comparatively humbly on the ontological scale:Then where are we to place it? For all the partial entities arising subsequentto the intellective realm are more partial than the single and whole demi-urgy, for the division of the whole into three and the leaders of the partialfabrication manifest themselves at this level of cosmic order. However, thebeings which are superior to the intellective realm are marked off by theproper characteristics of the gods, as has been demonstrated before, andgenerally, they have been conceived according to unity and they are superiorto the distinctiveness of the Forms of the intellective realm. Therefore, itonly remains that the single Demiurge of everything is stationed in theintellective realm.25Opsomer:2000,273"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"302Plotinus and the demise of the DemiurgePleroma and noetic cosmosThe ordering model of demiurgy and the creative Judaeo–Christian modelstart to coalesce to some extent. This is not solely due to the activities ofPlatonising members of the Judaeo–Christian tradition, such as Philo andOrigen, but also due to the emergence of Christian Gnosticism. Originallyin Jewish or Christian thought, there was no notion of God creating accord-ing to a pre-existent model; the concept which we find in Philo and Origenhas been imported from Platonism. This model, theautozo ̄on(EssentialLiving Being), becomes highly speculative as one descends through thePlatonic tradition, with hierarchies of genera and species, leading Plotinusto describe it as a ‘globe or a thing all faces, radiant with living faces’ (Enn.vi7[38]15.25–6). This concept of the paradigm, according to which theworld is constructed as the contents of the divine mind, can be traced backto Xenocrates’ assertion that the supreme principle is an Intellect (which isnecessarily engaged in thinking) and the Forms which Xenocrates equateswith numbers (Fr.34Heinze) could be regarded, perhaps, as the contentsof this Intellect.26Though I have suggested above that Philo may be the first to haveused the term ‘noetic cosmos’, I do not believe he was the first to developthis concept, as the identification of Forms with thelogoi spermatikoiofStoicism would easily have given rise to this theory. A comparable theoryexists in Valentinianism with the view that the Aeons are the ‘thoughts ofthe Father’. The difference here is that the Aeons can be deficient in varyingdegrees, whereas this notion is never articulated in Middle Platonism. Arelated point is the rank accorded to the various Aeons, whereas the Formsare all on the same level (although subordinate to the Form of the Good).The imagery applied to the concept is similar in both cases – God is the‘place’ of the Aeons (cf. Philo,Opif.20) and he is an undiminished spring(Trip. Treatise;Philo.Opif.2,Leg. All.ii.87,Cher.86,Post.136; Plotinus,Enn.iii8[30]10.5;vi7[38]12.24–5).27From theGospel of the Egyptians, we learn that there are a mass of ‘thrones,powers and glories’ which have not been characterized (54). The version ofthe Pleroma expressed atZostrianos48shares some correspondences withthe Platonic noetic realm:26Dillon:1982,101. It must be noted that based on the extant evidence, Xenocrates himself does notactually draw this conclusion.27Dillon:1982,102"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Pleroma and noetic cosmos303Corresponding to each of the Aeons, I saw a living earth and a living waterand (air) made of light and fire that cannot burn . . . all being simple andimmutable with trees that do not perish in many ways and tares . . . thisway and all these and imperishable fruit and living men and every form andimmortal souls and every shape and form of mind, and gods of truth andmessengers who exist in great glory and indissoluble bodies and an unbornbegetting and an immovable perception. (trans. J. N. Sieber)In thePoimandres8,thekalos kosmosfunctions as a noetic archetypewhich God contemplates prior to producing the world. A major differencebetween the Pleroma and the noetic realm, however, is that the Pleromais not meant to serve as a model upon which the world is based, since theworld results from an error in the godhead.28However, even here thereis evidence of the traditions coalescing. Man serves as the archetype ofmankind. In theSecond Treatise of the Great Seth(NHC53–4), Adam is theimage of ‘the Father of Truth, the Man of the Greatness’. In theApocryphonof John(NHCii,1,2,5–14), ‘the perfect man’, the Barbelo, is the archetypefor Adam. In the Sethian system additional archetypes of all the pneumaticsexist in the Pleroma.

Once the Demiurge re-emerges in the first to third centuries,though, he is taken as a literal figure and the discussion concerns theprecise nature of his activity, rather than whether he existed or not. ViaStoicism and its speculations regarding theLogos, the motif of the Demiurgebecame of importance for Philo of Alexandria, as well as those who canmore unequivocally be described as Middle Platonists. The mythologicalaccount of an anthropomorphised, generative intelligence had an obviousutility for Christian intellectuals. Faced with attacks on their religion’slack of philosophical sophistication, it provided a mechanism whereby theaccount ofGenesiscould be reconciled with Greek philosophy, with someof the foundations of this line of approach having already been laid byPhilo.Gnostic (and Hermetic) usage of the demiurgic motif simply revealsthe ultimate evolution of the concept that the Demiurge was a secondarygod or divine mediator, who was in some way less good than the FirstPrinciple (a means of accounting for the imperfections of the generatedrealm and of accommodating dualistic beliefs). The trend of placing thedemiurgic power lower on the ontological scheme as a means of insulatingthe First Principle from matter finally led to the point where both entitieswere placed in a state of antagonism. Neoplatonism did not really requirea Demiurge in its alternative generational model, but it still found a minorposition in its ontological scheme which could be occupied by demiurgicfigures.It is clear that we are dealing with the same motif, rather than simplyalternative accounts concerning the origin of the universe. These systemsinvolve a generative entity using some sort of model (which may be thecontents of his mind or something external) to produce the world and often304"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Concluding remarks305involves some sort of ordering activity in which the world is constructedon geometrical principles and frequently the Demiurge does not create thematter out of which he generates the cosmos. Usually the desire to produceis the result of the goodness of the Demiurge and the aim is to producethe best kind of world possible. While Gnosticism is an obvious exception,even there, in several accounts, the true God conspires to ensure that Man’sposition is somehow better than that envisioned by the Demiurge. Theaccounts also frequently make use of artisanal imagery or language whichdescribed the secondary god as a craftsman or fabricator.The intense debate generated during more recent times between pro-ponents of Darwinianism and rational design can perhaps be paralleledin terms of the rival creational or demiurgic models of the first to thirdcenturiesad. That there clearly is a difference between creation (whetheror not one wants to insist oncreatio ex nihilo) in a Judaeo–Christian senseand demiurgy is beyond question. In a similar manner, the biochemistMichael Behe has attempted to demonstrate that Darwinianism and ratio-nal design are not necessarily incompatible; the same may perhaps be saidfor creation and demiurgy.1Behe argues for intelligent design as the bestpossible means of explaining ‘irreducible complex systems’, systems such asthe bacterial f lagellum. According to Behe, such systems are only capable offunctioning in their entirety and because of this he claims that Darwinismcannot adequately explain how they came about.2For him, this suggestsa designer who knew in advance the outline of the completed system.Indeed we could see the conflict of Darwinianism versus rational designas represented in the ancient world by the difference of opinion betweenDemocritus and Plato.3Origen and Philo, to take the case of the ‘creationalists’, were preparedto incorporate elements of demiurgy. Most notable in this regard is thenotion that God should create from a model, clearly not a Jewish orChristian concept. Conversely, Maximus of Tyre asserts that Zeus’ nod isenough for demiurgy to occur – a notion closer to Origen than to Plato.Additionally, the notion that God requires ‘tools’ to create is not to befound in the Biblical account (although there he seems to require time).Since these ‘tools’ are for the most part insulating hypostases, their origincan be traced back to the Young Gods of theTimaeus, but also to thewinnowing-fan (πλόκανον)atTim.52e, which is used to separate outthe different atoms, similar to Philo’s division of atoms on the part of the1Behe:19962Behe’s claims have been contested within the scientific community, e.g. by Ussery:1998.3Dillon:2005b,263"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"306Concluding remarksLogos-Cutter. Thisπλόκανονis perhaps a reaction to the sieve (κόσκινον)which Democritus uses as an analogy to explain world-generation.Creation and demiurgy, then, seem to differ more in the nature ofthe mechanism they posit (a necessity when one proposes an omnipotentcreator and the other a less exalted entity), rather than in terms of theiroriginal causality. Both are propositions along deistic lines, differing fromthe mindless ‘evolution’ propounded by atomism or indeed the repeatedgeneration of the cosmos found in Stoicism. In a sense, the Plotinian modelcan be viewed as midway between atomism and the deism advanced in dif-ferent ways by creationalism and ‘demiurgism’ (if one can indeed posit sucha term, since the existence of the Demiurge was not a doctrine that evenmany Platonists believed in) – for Neoplatonists the universe was producedaccording to rational principles, but this had occurred spontaneously, notthanks to the zealous concern of a Demiurge.The metaphysical systems exhibited by those traditions which posita Demiurge appear to become increasingly elaborate and in the case ofsome of the Gnostic sects, almost tortuous. This can be viewed as partof an increasing tendency of various traditions to either insulate the FirstPrinciple from the phenomenal realm or as part of a growing anxiety toincrease his transcendence, as well as part of a drive for ‘one-upmanship’,claiming to accept, for example, the entities of a preceding intellectual figureand then going further back in tracing the cause of the universe. Plato mayhave had difficulty in finding the Father of the universe, but Numeniusseems to have had no trouble in discovering its Grandfather! Additionally,Numenius’ tampering with the Platonic ‘trinity’ of the Demiurge, theYoung Gods and the World-Soul, did not form a particularly satisfactorydivision, with the Third God a metaphysical hybrid formed from a lowerdemiurgic aspect, a World-Soul and a generated cosmos.A related problem emerges in Plutarch’s attempts to express his view oftheTimaeusin terms of Egyptian mythology; the correspondences do notquite work consistently, given his combination of the Receptacle and mat-ter in the form of Isis. His double-Demiurge is indicative of the tendencyto strive for a greater degree of sophistication (or unnecessary complex-ity) than that of Plato’sTimaeus. With the Valentinian desire to maketheir Platonic inheritance compatible with Christianity, the incentive fordeveloping Plato’s triad into something outrageously complex is easy toobserve.All cultures (presumably) speculate on the origin of the cosmos. Thereis nothing inherently ‘Greek’ in that, nor does one require Plato in orderto observe rationality and order in the created world. If God in the Old"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Concluding remarks307Testament can be regarded as a builder, then perhaps the thesis that thethinkers assembled here are part of the development of the demiurgic con-cept (rather than merely speculation on creation) requires some defence.Against this I would contend that they are all attempting to various extentsto respond to the nature of demiurgy, as advocated in theTimaeus.Ona superficial level, all these systems make use of the entities (or modifiedversion of them) drawn from the demiurgic myth. More importantly, thenature of demiurgy is similar in broad outline – ordering of disorderlymatter by an entity of limited powers in accordance with rationality, or ‘abeautiful model’. The nature of this limitation varies, from the negativeinfluence of Necessity in theTimaeus, to the ignorant Gnostic Demiurge.Even in systems which envisage an omnipotent creator (such as the Judaeo–Christian one), the work of demiurgy is assigned to a lower-ranking entityor hypostasis, such as theLogosor Son-Logos, (even if the title is appliedto God the Father). Although the entities of Gnosticism can be viewed ascaricatured or distorted versions of their Platonic originals, their ancestryfrom theTimaeus(or the subsequent philosophical tradition) cannot bedisputed. The Middle Platonist or Gnostic Demiurge might be an imper-fect creator, but to a lesser degree so is his counterpart in theTimaeus,whois limited by Necessity. TheLogosof thePoimandresmay not be found intheTimaeus, but it does occupy a mediating role between the elements,though it evidently lacks the sophistication of its counterpart in Philo. TheGnostic Pleroma adopts the language used to describe the Platonic realmof the Forms.This point can be made to a lesser degree regarding other interpretationsof theTimaeus. It is clear that the Numenian account of the generation ofthe soul, enmattered as it is by the Second God, but with production super-vised at some level by the First God, is influenced by the co-production ofthe Demiurge and the Young Gods. The mixing-bowl used by the Demi-urge of theTimaeusis, in some sense, the ancestor of the elaborate systemof hypostases, which are often envisaged as tools, from the representationof theLogosas a saw in Philo, to the mechanical imagery used by Maximus.The trend could also find justification in the description of the YoungGods, which led to positing various associates who aid the Demiurge dur-ing the process of world-generation. Such a trend was no doubt reinforcedas it coincides perfectly with the unnamed associates who aid God in theBiblical account.The pervasiveness of the demiurgic concept lies evidently in Plato’sphilosophical importance and the esteem in which theTimaeuswas heldamongst the Platonic dialogues as a source for Plato’s metaphysics. In"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"308Concluding remarksdeveloping such powerful philosophical imagery to recount ‘a likely story’which ‘accounted for appearances’, Plato produced a myth which couldeasily be adapted by other thinkers for their own ends (who could stillhave a legitimate claim for producing the more accurate story thatTimaeusmentions as possible at some stage in the future). Plato’s own ambivalenceon certain points (especially the precise ontological status of the Demi-urge), raised interest amongst those keen on systematising his thought,but also meant that the imagery was flexible enough to be welcomed byother traditions and manipulated to suit their particular interpretations.Even Christianity, with its radically different heritage and fundamentallydifferent vision of ‘creation’, was able to accommodate and indeed con-tribute to the debate on demiurgy (though this is largely indebted tothe Jewish philosopher Philo’s attempt to rewriteGenesisin philosophicallanguage).Of course, Platonism, Gnosticism, Hermetism and Christianity are sep-arate intellectual traditions, but this does not mean that they should be con-ceived of as hermetically-sealed units. They responded to each other (evenif the direction of the influence is sometimes difficult to discern). Analysingall four traditions allows the complex nature of the demiurgic concept tobe revealed, from its more strict metaphysical usage through to variousmythological permutations. Between all four traditions, a clear develop-ment can be observed, primarily centering on the Demiurge’s decliningontological status and the functioning of lesser entities in various ancillaryor insulating roles, such asdaimonesor the Archons of Gnosticism.Another question concerning demiurgy is whether it should be viewedas a continual, or a once-off event. While Plato was vague concerning this,Plutarch clearly views the Demiurge as continually ordering. Not enoughof Numenius survives to make a definitive assessment, and the division ofthe Second and Third Gods may be a single occurrence. Still, one couldargue that the Second God is continually instantiating the Intelligibles,as received from the First God. There is no doubt that Philo envisagestheLogosas continually dividing (although much of the influence whichthis exterted on Christianity was mediated via the New Testament conceptof theLogos). For Gnosticism and Hermetism, this can evidently not bethe case. Since the world is generated in these systems by a cataclysmicevent, namely the fragmentation of the godhead itself, it has to be asingle occurrence. This does not mean that both traditions have merelyappropriated the language of demiurgy to describe a different process.Rather, they have accommodated certain elements of the Demiurge intotheir overall structure.

This is evidentlymore acute for those who regard the Demiurge as the First Principle; theGnostics have no such concern. Theνεῦμα(nod of Zeus necessary forworld-generation to occur) proposed by Maximus of Tyre or the ‘othercontacts and attachments’ which Plutarch is so vague about, helps to pre-serve this transcendence. However, it is not necessary to conceal aspects ofthe Demiurge’s causality merely to preserve his transcendence. Philo andOrigen have more pressing demands to maintain divine transcendence andstill develop a detailed model of how creation actually works, in spite ofOrigen’s claim that the will of God is sufficient. Indeed, they are addition-ally forced to posit the unity of the godhead, which can be compromisedwhen positing numerous hypostases. As the Demiurge is by definitionresponsible for transmitting the Forms to the sensible world, he has tobe placed quite close to it. This helps to explain his comparatively lowontological rank.Perhaps the success of the demiurgic concept, and its impact even in ourown time on popular culture (although in an extremely limited way) liesin Timaeus’ assertion that what he was expounding was only ‘a likely story’designed to account for appearances, and his admission that it would besuperseded at some stage by a more accurate version, which would equallyshow that the world had been fashioned by a rational intelligence. Ulti-mately that is what occurred and ‘the likely story’ became one influencedby Judaism, Christianity or a more modern version of Platonism. That itlapsed from the forefront of even Platonist (or Neoplatonist) systems islargely because it had no response to the cogent argumentation of Plotinusthat the world’s generation could not be the result of deliberation, but mustbe spontaneous."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"BibliographyANCIENT SOURCES: EDITIONS, TRANSLATIONS,COMMENTARIESAlcinous,The Handbook of Platonism, trans. and comm.
