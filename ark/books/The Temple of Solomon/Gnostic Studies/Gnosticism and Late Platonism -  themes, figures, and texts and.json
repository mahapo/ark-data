John D. Turner was responsible fororganizing the Seminar and bringing together a steering committee thatincluded himself, Robert M. Berchman, Jay Bregman, John P. Kenney,Michael A. Williams, and Ruth Majercik. Ruth Majercik served as Chair ofthe Seminar during its six-year term.In organizing the Seminar, a main objective was to bring together agroup of well-known scholars with expertise in the areas of Gnosticismand/or later Platonism (i.e., Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism) from avariety of disciplines and methodologies who could bring a diversity ofviews and approaches to the general problematic of the Seminar. This wasaccomplished by attracting scholars from within the AAR and SBL as wellas reaching out to newcomers who have now become members of thesesocieties. The core group of active participants each year consisted ofapproximately sixteen members with an average of twenty auditors attend-ing each session. In structuring our sessions, we initially decided that weshould have two papers presented each year on a single topic with tworespondents. The purpose was to have each presenter analyze a giventopic from the perspective of his or her expertise in Gnosticism or Platon-ism; the respondents would reply in a similar manner. In addition, eachpresenter was also asked to incorporate the other perspective to the degreethat he or she could, with the understanding that we did not expect ourparticipants to be equally knowledgeable in both areas. In some years thisroutine was varied by having a single presenter and two respondents sothat certain issues could be explored in more detail. This method resultedin a great deal of creative thinking and discussion on the part of our par-ticipants. During the course of the Seminar, most of the presenters also hadan opportunity to act as a respondent. Additional respondents were John"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Sieber, Birger Pearson, and Ruth Majercik. Due to the length of the volumeand other considerations, we were not able to include the remarks (somequite extensive) of the respondents; however, many of their critical com-ments have been addressed in the final versions of papers.The topic for each session was mutually decided upon during ourannual business meetings, with the various topics generally reflecting thecurrent research interests of our presenters. The topics include: Platonicand gnostic doctrines of matter (Einar Thomassen and Kevin Corrigan);gnostic ritual and Neoplatonic theurgy (John D. Turner and GregoryShaw); the case for a pre-Plotinian Middle Platonic setting for the Anony-mous Commentary on the Parmenidesand the Nag Hammadi Sethian trea-tises Zostrianosand Allogenes(Kevin Corrigan and John D. Turner); therelationship between the metaphysics of Iamblichus and the PlatonizingSethian treatises, especially Marsanes(John Finamore); Platonic and gnos-tic uses of negative theology (John P. Kenney and Michael A. Williams);and the nature of Providence in Plotinus and Sethian Gnosticism (FredericM. Schroeder).In preparing the volume for publication, John D. Turner and RuthMajercik were responsible for editing the papers in cooperation with theauthors. They also compiled the bibliography. An earlier version of Gregory Shaw’s paper originally appeared in The Journal of NeoplatonicStudies,whose publisher has authorized its appearance here in revisedform. The editors wish to thank the Society of Biblical Literature for spon-soring our Seminar and the SBL Symposium Series, initially under thedirection of Gail O’Day and now Christopher R.

He concludes that “thetheology of the Tripartite Tractateis closest in its philosophical design tothe sort of Middle Platonism represented by Albinus (Alkinoos) or Nume-nius.”1This conclusion is based on the following elements of comparison:(1) in Tripartite Tractate, the aeons are represented as the thoughts ofa self-thinking Father, in the same way that the ideas are the thoughts of anoetic First God in these Platonists;(2) in both systems this god and the way he generates (i.e., by self-contemplation) are distinct from a second, demiurgic figure who shapesthe cosmos;(3) the Logos, as the fallen aeon, is restored though contemplationin the same way that lower hypostases are united with the higher inPlatonism.The pertinence of these rapprochementsis, I think, beyond doubt. Butonce they have been established, further questions arise. Granted thatthose similarities exist, how are we to account for the no less real dissim-ilaritiesbetween these Middle Platonists and the Valentinian system of Tri-partite Tractate?It is one of these dissimilarities that forms the topic of thispaper: the position of Matter. Albinus/Alkinoos treats Matter as a principle(Did. 163.11 Hermann; th'\" prwvth\" u{lh\"171.43 H.). The same is the casewith Numenius, for whom Matter is the same as the Dyad, and is sine ortuet generatione(frg. 52.10 des Places = Calcidius, In Tim.295). TripartiteTractate, however, denies explicitly that there can be any u{lhexistingalong with the Father from the beginning (53,31–32). Instead, the tractate’sprotological myth offers a theory that explains Matter as deriving fromsomething that exists prior to it: Matter is brought into existence by the“presumptuous thought” of that aeon that Tripartite Tractatecalls “the1J. P. Kenney, “The Platonism of the Tripartite Tractate(NHC I,5),” in Neopla-tonism and Gnosticism(ed. Richard T. Wallis and Jay Bregman; Albany: SUNYPress, 1992), 200."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Logos.” This “thought” gives rise to numerous chaotic powers(75,17–80,11). Upon seeing this, the Logos repents, and his repentanceproduces a new set of powers, superior to the first, which they combat(80,11–85,15). As a result of the struggle between the two kinds of pow-ers, those of presumption and those of repentance, “matters of varioussorts”2(85,10) are produced.A theory about the origin of Matter forms part of all the attested vari-ants of the Valentinian system. According to the Valentinian model systemoffered by Irenaeus, the material substance from which the world was cre-ated originated in the passions of Sophia, specified as sorrow, fear, andperplexity: tauvthn suvntaxin kai; oujsivan th'\" u{lh\" gegenh'sqai levgousin, ejxh|\" o{de oJ kovsmo\" sunevsthken(Irenaeus Haer.1.4.2).3This is not a theory that is specific to Valentinianism. As Hans Jonashas put it, the theory “that no original world of darkness or of matter isassumed to oppose the primal being, but that the dualism of existing real-ity is derived from an inner process within the one divinity itself” is “a dis-tinctive feature of the Syrian and Alexandrian gnosisand its majordifference from the Iranian type of gnostic speculation, which starts froma dualism of pre-existent principles.”4An explicit assertion of this kind oftheory can be found in NHC II,5(somewhat misnamed by some moderneditors as On the Origin of the World):Seeing that everybody, gods of the world and mankind, says that nothingexisted prior to chaos, I in distinction shall demonstrate that they are all mis-taken, because they are not acquainted with the origin of chaos, nor with itsroot. Here is the demonstration. How well it suits all men, on the subject ofchaos, to say that it is a kind of darkness! But in fact it comes from a shadow,which has been called by the name darkness. And the shadow comes froma product that has existed since the beginning. It is, moreover, clear that it2HNnHulh euS@bbiaeit, probably < *poikivlai u{lai; this has Platonist connota-tions, going back to Tim.50d5 (cf. Chald. Or.frg. 34 des Places; Clement of Alexan-dria Exc.50.1; Irenaeus Haer. 1.4.1).3Cf. Haer.1.2.3: ejnteu'qen levgousi prwvthn ajrch;n ejschkevnai th;n oujsivan th'\" u{lh\", ejkth'\" ajgnoiva\" kai; th'\" luvph\" kai; tou' fovbou kai; th'\" ejkplhvxew\"(this is an interpolationcoming from a different source than the one used by Irenaeus for his main account);1.8.4 (parable of the lost sheep): plavnhn de; th;n ejkto;\" plhrwvmato\" ejn toi'\" pavqesi dia-tribh;n, ejx w|n gegonevnai th;n u{lhn uJpotivqentai; Clement of Alexandria Exc.67.4 th'\"a[nw qhleiva\"...h|\" ta; pavqh ktivsi\" gevgonen, th'\" kai; ta;\" ajmovrfou\" oujsiva\" proballouv-sh\". Irenaeus returns to this doctrine when he seeks to refute the Valentinian theoriesin Book 2: a praedictis passionibus emisit tantam conditionis materiam(Haer.2.10.3;cf. the whole of 10.3–4); materiae emissio et reliquae mundi fabricatio . . . ex passioneet ignorantia volunt substantiam habere(2.13.7; also cf. 2.18.7; 2.19.4; 2.20.5).4H. Jonas, The Gnostic Religion(Boston: Beacon, 1963), 105.2Einar Thomassen"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"(viz., the product) existed before chaos came into being, and that the latteris posterior to the first product. (97,24–98,7; trans. Bethge et al. in NHLE)It is then explained that this first product arose as a likeness resembling theprimeval light, out of the volition of Pistis Sophia (98,13–16). NHC II,5is notValentinian, and the general theory about the nonoriginality of Matter was notinvented by the Valentinians. But we shall argue that it was the Valentinians,more than any other group of gnostics, who made use of a specific set ofconcepts derived from the philosophical schools to express the theory.The Valentinian doctrine that Matter, and subsequently the world, orig-inates from the passions of Achamoth struck the polemical mind of Ter-tullian, who ridiculed the Valentinians for this fantastic innovation. Hereindeed, he says, was something new to be learned for both Pythagoreansand Stoics, and even for Plato.5Tertullian doubtless assumes that all theschools of philosophy regard Matter as an unoriginate first principle. In thisview Tertullian is, generally speaking, correct. The Pythagoreans were tra-ditionally known to propound a dualism between the Monad and theDyad-a[peiron, the Peripatetics opposed Form and Matter, and the Stoa sim-ilarly Logos and a[poio\" u{lh. The Platonists, of course, taught a tripartitionof God, the Ideas, and Matter. This is the model to which Albinus/Alkinoosand Numenius adhere as well.However, Numenius also informs us that certain Pythagoreans take adifferent view:But certain Pythagoreans have not properly grasped the force of this the-ory. For them, this indeterminate and unlimited Dyad is itself broughtforth from the single Monad, when the Monad withdraws from its natureand wanders into the condition of the Dyad [etiam illam indeterminatamet immensam duitatem ab unica singularitate institutam recedente anatura sua singularitate et in duitatis habitum migrante]. (frg. 52.15–19des Places = Calcidius In Tim.295)Numenius has only scorn for this doctrine, which has the Monad unac-countably disappear and turn into the Dyad, thus transforming God intoMatter. Numenius’s testimony, however, is only one of several that attest tothe existence in Pythagorean circles of monistic theories attempting a der-ivation of the Dyad-Matter from the Monad.6These testimonies begin withThe Derivation of Matter35Age nunc discant Pythagorici, agnoscant Stoici, Plato ipse, unde materia,quam innatam uolunt, et originem et sustantiam traxerit in omnem hanc struemmundi; quod nec Mercurius ille Trismegistus, magister omnium physicorum, recog-itauit(Tertullian Val.15.1).6Cf. A.-J.

B.C.E.),8Mod-eratus of Gades (end of first century C.E.),9the report in Sextus Empiricus10.248ff., and other Neopythagoreans such as Nicomachus of Gerasa. (Thisdossier is not exhaustive.) This monistic type of Pythagoreanism thusshares with Valentinianism, as well as with Neoplatonism, the view thatmatter has secondary, or derived, existence.According to this Neopythagorean theory, matter, in the sense of thematerial from which the sensible bodies of the cosmos are made, is notderived directly from the first principle (called the Monad, or the One) butfrom the principle, or idea of matter, the (Indefinite) Dyad, which in turnoriginates in the first principle. The Indefinite Dyad (ajovristo\" duav\") is ofcourse the principle of plurality, extension, formlessness, movement, etc.,which Plato took over from the old Pythagoreans and developed into amajor feature of his oral teaching and which continued to play an impor-tant role in the subsequent Platonist tradition. But whereas Plato and theOld Academy considered the Dyad an independent principle, the Neopy-thagorean trends with which we are dealing here inserted it into a monis-tic system of derivation.In Valentinianism as well, cosmogonic matter only comes into being atthe end of a process. The main feature of this process is the passion ofSophia. Is it possible, then, that the passion of Sophia here serves toexpress the same idea as the Dyad in monistic Pythagoreanism? In my viewthere exists conclusive evidence that these Neopythagorean theories aboutthe derivation of matter were known to the Valentinian theologians andthat they formed a source from which Valentinian systems were persist-ently built. This evidence consists in a series of Neopythagorean technicalterms that occur in these systems and that can be shown to express thesame ontological notions.104Einar ThomassenH. J.

It is well known thattovlmh, which qualifies the passion of Sophia in Irenaeus Haer.1.2.2, alsooccurs in Plotinus, who uses it generally (in the form tovlma) to describe theself-positing of a lower hypostasis as distinct from a higher one.11Plotinustook over this term from the Neopythagoreans, who employed it as an epithetof the Dyad. It refers to the breaking loose of the Dyad from the Monad.12Plotinus used it as a way of expressing that all emanation has a dyadic aspect.In Valentinianism the idea, if not perhaps the term itself, is also found in Tri.Trac.76,19–20, “he acted highmindedly” (aFeire HNoumNtnoG Mmeue), aswell as in the references to the ejnquvmhsi\"or e[nnoiaof Sophia in other sources.The Valentinians undoubtedly drew on the same sort of sources as Plotinus inusing the term. But, as we shall try to show in what follows, this is not an iso-lated example nor a case of merely coincidentally shared vocabulary.2. “Extension” (e[ktasi\")To characterize the Dyad the term “extension” (ejkteivvvnein/e[ktasi\") isused in Sextus EmpiricusMath.10.277: The One is always delimiting,whereas the Dyad becomes two and extends the numbers into an unlim-ited multitude (tou' me;n eJno;\" ajei; peratou'nto\" th'\" de; ajorivstou duavdo\" duvogennwvsh\" kai; eij\" a[peiron plh'qo\" tou;\" ajriqmou;\" ejkteinouvsh\"). The sameterm occurs in Moderatus of Gades, when he describes the entity he calls“Quantity,” which in fact is his name for the Dyad. “Quantity” is charac-terized by “privation, breaking loose, extension and severance” (stevrhsinkai; paravlusin kai; e[ktasin kai; diaspasmovn, Simplicius In phys.230.19–20Diels).13In later sources the word occurs not infrequently.14The term e[ktasi\"can also be used to describe the movement of theMonad itself from oneness to plurality, as in the Pseudo-Clementine The Derivation of Matter511A presentation of the entire philosophy of Plotinus has been built around thisconcept by N. Baladi, La pensée de Plotin(Initiation philosophique 92; Paris: Lespresses des universités de France, 1970).12Cf. Krämer, 321 n. 483; Henry’s and Schwyzer’s note on Enn.5.1 [10].1.4 in P. Henry and H.-R. Schwyzer, eds., Plotini Opera(3 vols.; Scriptorum classicorumbibliotheca Oxoniensis; Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964–1982).13Moderatus makes a distinction between Quantity as such (posovth\") and Quantity(posovn) as the matter (u{lh) of bodies, the first serving as the paradigm of the latter. Itis more precisely to this last Quantity-as-Matter that the description quoted refers, butit is apparently intended to be equally applicable to the more original concept.14Iamblichus In Nicom.

In Christ-ian trinitarian theology the Sabellians and Marcellus of Ancyra took up theterm in order to explain how God by extension and spreading out (platuvnein) is a Triad as well as a Monad.15It is this precise term, we believe, that is put to use in Irenaeus’s Valen-tinian model system to describe the effect of the passion of Sophia. Onaccount of her unfulfillable desire for the Father, it is said, Sophia “extendedherself indefinitely” (ejkteinovmenon ajei; ejpi; to; provsqen, Irenaeus Haer.1.2.2;ejkteinomevnh\" aujth'\" kai; eij\" a[peiron rJeouvsh\" th'\" oujsiva\", 1.3.3). In the latterpassage we note also the presence of two other Pythagorean terms as well:a[peironis of course the traditional Pythagorean word describing the indefi-niteness of the Dyad. rJeu'si\", “flowing,” is a word used to express how thedyadic line issues from the monadic point.16Thus, by describing the passionof Sophia as producing an extension into indefiniteness the Valentinians castinto the form of a tragic myth the Neopythagorean theory of the derivationof plurality from the Monad through the Indefinite Dyad.3. “Passion”An objection that might be raised against this interpretation is that inthe Valentinian systems Sophia does not originate directly from the Fatherand that her generation therefore is not comparable to the way that theDyad derives from the Monad/One in Neopythagoreanism. Instead, Sophiais only one among a multitude of aeons that have already been projectedfrom the Father. She is not herself the cause of this multiplicity, only one ofits products. The initial plurality comes into being with the generation of theSon (= Monogenes, Nous, etc.), according to most sources,17and there isnothing negative about this, the primal projective act.186Einar Thomassen15Cf.

Armstrong, who therein sees a fun-damental difference between Plotinus and the Valentinians: “In the system ofValentinus the Pleroma . . . was fully constituted before there was any question ofany sort of tolma.. . . In no Gnostic system is the Pleroma . . . the result of tolma."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"At this point it is important, however, not to be deluded by the mytho-logical form of the Valentinian system. In fact, it can be plausibly arguedthat the account of the passion of Sophia, in its basic idea in Valentinian-ism, is just an exposition in mythological form of the general theoreticalproblem of how plurality can be derived from unity. Her passion is thenecessary consequence and epitomization of the difficulties inherent in thenotion of projection/emanation as such and is not a mere accident arisingin the course of this process.That this is so is shown by the fact that the same terms that describethe passion of Sophia may also be used for the generation of the Son. InTripartite Tractateit is explained that while the Father remains unaf-fected in his transcendence (64,28ff.), the Son is “the one who extendedhimself and spread himself” (paei de aFsa[u]tN MmaF abal MminMm[aF] auw pentaFpareS@F ab[al], 65,4–6). Behind the Coptic termssautN abaland pwr!S abalit is possible to recognize the Greek ejkteivneinand platuvnein.19The use of this terminology for the Son indi-cates that his function is conceived along the lines of the Neopy-thagorean Dyad: Through him the All as a plurality comes into beingfrom the Father.The same terminology can be recognized in Irenaeus Haer.1.4.1,where Christ is said to extend himself beyond the Limit/Cross: dia; tou' stau-rou' ejpektaqevnta. This refers, of course, to an extension into the unlimited.Finally, the term “spreading out” (pwrS[abal] < *platuvnein) occurs inVal. Exp.23,27–31: “He brought [him]self forth, and in the second [he] man-ifested his will, [and] in the fourth he spread himself [out].” Here the termseems to be related to the generation of the Pythagorean tetraktys.If this argument is correct, we should be entitled to expect that eventhe idea of passion itself, the most characteristic feature of the “fall” ofThe Derivation of Matter7There is always in the Gnostic systems a break in the middle of the procession ofall things from the first principle, a radical disorder and discontinuity between thespiritual world and the ignorant and inferior power which makes the materialworld” (The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval History[ed. A. H.Armstrong; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967], 243–44). Similarly, Dil-lon, The Middle Platonists,386–87: “For Valentinus . . . there is nothing evil aboutEnnoia. She is simply the condition for the generation of everything after the Fore-father. Evil only arises at a much lower level, with the most junior of the aeons.”Also H. Jonas (Gnosis und spätantiker Geist,vol. 1: Die mythologische Gnosis[3ded.; FRLANT NS 33; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1934], 333–34) sees thepassion of Sophia as a willful act of will by a character in a mythological narrative,rather than as the allegorization of a philosophically necessary implication. In myview these scholars have misjudged the philosophical intentions of Valentinian sys-tematic exposition.19The combination of the two terms is in itself significant, of course."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Sophia, would not be restricted to her only, but that passion is impliedeven at the point of the first duality when the Father projects and man-ifests himself as and in the Son. That this is really the case is confirmedby Irenaeus Haer.1.2.2, where it is explicitly stated that “this (passion)in fact began among those associated with Nous and Truth, but burstforth in this erring aeon” (o}[sc.pavqo\"]ejnhvrxato me;n ejn toi'\" peri; to;nNou'n kai; th;n !Alhvqeian, ajpevskhye de; eij\" tou'ton to;n paratrapevnta).Also in Hipp. El.6.31.1 the Pleroma as a whole is strongly affected bythe passion of Sophia. And in Clement of Alexandria Exc.30 it is saidthat the rest of the Pleroma “suffered together with” (sunepavqhsen)Sophia. In all these passages it is implied that the passion experiencedby Sophia is inherent in the notion of projection itself, in the cominginto being of duality, of that which in the Pythagorean-Platonist traditionis referred to as the Dyad. The basis for this is the view that the Monadrepresents impassibility and rationality, and the Dyad passion. As JohnLydus says, “The rational comes from the Monad, . . . the passible andpassion from the Dyad.”20Thus oJrmhvis frequently referred to as anattribute of the Dyad.21(I have not, however, been able to find pavqo\"used in this context.)The Valentinian notion of projection is fundamentally ambiguous. Onthe one hand it has a negative aspect, in so far as duality implies infinitemultiplicity and thus, in line with the nature of the Pythagorean-PlatonistDyad, inevitably produces passion and Matter. On the other hand, pro-jection also has the positive aspect of divine manifestation; the Father gra-ciously allows himself to be known by others through his begetting ofaeonic offspring. It is this ambiguity that expresses itself in the fact that“extension” may be used, as we saw, bothto describe the fall of Sophiaandthe subsequent salvation from the fall, when the Savior is “stretchedupon” the Cross, i.e., he extends himself beyond the Limit in order toredeem Sophia on the outside.The same ambiguity applies to the notion of the passion. So as if tocondense it in one expression, the Valentinians used the word “compas-sion” to describe an act that is at the same time tragic and salvific. Afterdescribing the extension and spreading out of the Son quoted above, Tri-partite Tractategoes on to state that this was done “because of his endur-ing suffering for them (sc. the All)” (abal NteFm[nt]Sop Hise arauetSoop, 65,11–12). This may be compared with Clement of Alexandria,who in Exc.30.1 records with indignation that the Valentinians say that theFather “suffered,” because he showed compassion towards Silence who8Einar Thomassen20Mens.1.11:to; me;n ga;r . . . logiko;n ejk th'\" monavdo\" . . . to; de; qumiko;n kai;ejpiqumiko;n ejk th'\" duavdo\".21Cf. Krämer, Der Ursprung der Geistmetaphysik,322 n. 488."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"desired to know him.22Thus the notion of compassion retains an elementof passion, while at the same time signifying an act of grace. The systemsexpress this ambiguity by means of horizontal and vertical distinctions:Sophia represents the negative aspect of projection, the Son is positiveaspect. Or, the Father remains impassible (Tri. Trac.64,38), while the Sonis the one who suffers compassion. But the systems never really solve thisinitial ambiguity in theoretical terms—only the ritually mediated unificationof the syzygoiin the Bridal Chamber offers what is, in the final analysis, areligious solution to this ontological dilemma.4. “Otherness” (eJterovth\")This is another term that belongs to the traditional vocabulary of theDyad.23In Valentinian literature this term probably lies behind the descrip-tion of the generation of the Son in Val. Exp.22,35–36 “he conceived athought of otherness” (a@FJi noumeue NSMmo).On this point there is a very interesting remark in Irenaeus Haer.1.4.1(end), where the passion of the lower Sophia (Achamoth), who hasremained outside the Pleroma, is contrasted with that of the first Sophia,who was brought back to the Pleroma: “Her sufferings did not have thenature of otherness, as was the case with her mother, the first Sophia, whowas an aeon, but of contrariness” (kai; ouj kaqavper hJ mhvthr aujth'\", hJ prwvthSofiva aijwvn, eJteroivwsin ejn toi'\" pavqesin ei\\cen, ajlla; ejnantiovthta). This dis-tinction between otherness and contrariness seems very likely to go backto the system of diaeresis that Plato developed in his oral teaching,reported by Hermodorus and quoted by Simplicius (In phys.247.30ff.Diels). Here, Plato distinguished between the categories of the absolute(kaq! auJtav) and the relative (pro;\" e{tera), and subdivided the latter into thecontrary (pro;\" ejnantiva) and the undetermined relative (prov\" ti).A version of this theory appears in Sextus Empiricus’s report onPythagorean doctrine in Math.10.261ff. According to Sextus, the Monad isdescribed as self-identity (aujtovth\") and as creating otherness by being addedto itself, and from this eJterovth\"the Indefinite Dyad comes into being. Relatedto this theory is a system of categories distinguishing between the absolute(kata; diaforavn), the contrary (kat! ejnantivwsin) and the relative (prov\" ti).

In what sense can the logical categoryof the contrary describe passions? And how can a system of logical classifi-cation be used in a theory of cosmological derivation, where these passionsdescribed as contrariness subsequently give rise to matter? However, the factthat the system of diaeresis does appear in a Neopythagorean context, andthat Neopythagoreans were concerned with the derivation of matter from theDyad, defined as eJterovth\", suggests that the distinction eJteroivwsi\"/ejnantiovth\"in the Valentinian text does depend on Neopythagorean mod-els making use of Old Academic diaeresis in a physical context.245. “Movement” (kivnhsi\")“Movement” is closely associated with the notions of passion and oth-erness as a description of the Dyad.25In Valentinianism movement is a char-acteristic of the passion of Sophia: th;n fovbou kivnhsin, Irenaeus Haer.1.5.4.26In Tripartite Tractate“the Logos which had moved” (plogos entaHkim) isa fixed expression referring to the fallen aeon (85,16–17, etc.). However, aswith “extension” and “passion,” “movement” can also be found in connec-tion with the very first projection, that of the Son: According to ValentinianExpositionthe Father is characterized by silence (22,21.24–26; 23,22) andtranquillity (22,22, psGraH@t< *hJsuciva), whereas the Son is described as“the God who has gone forth” (22,30–31) and “who has moved” (entaHkim,22,38). Here we discern a distinction between an immovable Monad and amoving Dyad.6. “Formlessness”Formlessness is of course an essential characteristic of the sufferingSophia as well as of the Dyad and its cosmological specialization, Matter.The common and traditional terminology here is easily recognizable; e.g.,oujsivan a[morfon, Irenaeus Haer.1.2.3; a[morfon de; kai; ajneivdeon, 1.2.4 (cf.4.1); eij\" a[peiron rJeouvsh\" th'\" oujsiva\", 1.3.3; polumerou'\" kai; polupoikivlou,1.4.1; oujsivan a[morfon kai; ajkataskeuvasto\", Hipp. El.6.30.8.

Truth26,15–19: “All the spaces were moved (kim) and troubled.... Error was anguished.”"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"one example: Moderatus portrays his “Quantity” as a[morfon kai; ajdiaivretonkai; ajschmavtiston(Simplicius In phys.231.10–11 Diels). This terminologyis obviously derived from Plato’s description of the Receptacle in Tim.51a7ajnovraton ei\\dov\" ti kai; a[morfon.7. “Division” and “Separation.”The notion of “division,” or “separation,” often occurs in the Pytha-gorean sources describing the coming into being of the Dyad. Thus theTheologumena Arithmeticae,an edition of a work by Iamblichus incorpo-rating materials from Nicomachus of Gerasa, states that “the first Dyad sep-arated itself from the Monad” (prwvth ga;r hJ dua;\" diecwvrisen auJth;n ejk th'\"monavdo\", 9.5–6 de Falco).27Iamblichus uses the idea in Myst.8.3, wherehe says that God produced Matter after having cut off the principle of mat-ter from the principle of substance (u{lhn de; parhvgagen oJ qeo;\" ajpo; th'\" ouj-siovthto\" uJposcisqeivsh\" uJlovthto\"). It is the same theory which appears inModeratus, who explains that the “Unitary Logos” separated from itselfQuantity by a process of self-privation, depriving it of all its own rationalconstituents and ideas (oJ eJniai'o\" lovgo\" . . . kata; stevrhsin aujtou' ejcwvrise[ejcwvrhseMSS; emended by Zeller, Festugière] th;n posovthta pavntwn aujth;nsterhvsa\" tw'n aujtou' lovgwn kai; eijdw'n, Simplicius In phys.231.7–10 Diels).Finally, Numenius exploits the idea of the schismatic nature of the Dyad,though within a dualistic framework, in his description of how the thirdgod is separated from the second: The second god, by coming into con-tact with Matter, the Dyad, unifies Matter but is itself divided by it becausethe Dyad has a concupiscent and flowing nature (scivzetai de; uJp! aujth'\"ejpiqumhtiko;n h|qo\" ejcouvsh\" kai; rJeouvsh\", frg. 11 des Places).It is this idea that in all probability lies behind the notion of the divi-sion or separation of Sophia, which is a constant and characteristic featureof the Valentinian systems. Her unlimited outward movement provokes theappearance of the Limit (o{ro\"), who separates from her the irrational partof her passion (cwrisqeivsh\" ga;r th'\" ejnqunhvsew\" ajp! aujth'\" su;n tw/'ejpigenomevnw/ pavqei, Irenaeus Haer.1.2.4; ajforisqh'nai, ibid., cf. 1.4.1;diaivresi\", Hipp. El.6.31.2; ajpocwrivzein, ibid., 6.31.4). In ValentinianExpositionSophia is said to be “cut off” (asSaat@s abal) from hersuvzugo\"(34,38), and in Tripartite Tractatethe Logos “suffered a divisionand a turning” (oupwSe pe NtaFNkaH M[ma]F mNn ourike, 77,21–22).The perfect part of the Logos hastens back to the Pleroma (77,37ff., cf. Val.Exp.33,36), whereas the part that remains outside is emptied of masculin-ity (77,12–13), rationality (lovgo\") and light (78,34–35). This is, I believe, essentially the same process as the one described by Moderatus, who letsThe Derivation of Matter1127Cf. also Krämer, Der Ursprung der Geistmetaphysik,320 n. 479."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Quantity come into being from the Unitary Logos through an act of depri-vation of rationality (kata; stevrhsin). The widespread application of thistheory in Valentinianism is further attested by Irenaeus Haer.1.11.1, whereSophia gives birth to Christ “with a certain shadow,” which he then cuts off(ajpokovyanta) from himself before he ascends to the Pleroma, as well as byClement of Alexandria Exc.33.4, where the term ajpotomivaapplied to theDemiurge serves to indicate his essentially defective origin and nature.The ambiguity we noted vis-à-vis the first projection also manifestsitself with regard to the notion of separation. The purpose of this notionis to safeguard unity while at the same time explaining plurality. On theone hand plurality is cut away from the oneness; on the other hand plu-rality thereby asserts itself as a separate reality. Through their separationfrom one another, the two can only be conceived, however, in a mutualrelationship. The principle of plurality now exists as pure negativity, akevnwma(Irenaeus Haer.1.4.1; Clement of Alexandria Exc.31.4), oppositea unity which after the restoration to it of the rational part of the suffer-ing aeon is now also a multiplicity, a plhvrwma: As a result of the restora-tion of Sophia the aeons form a perfect unity—each individual, whileretaining its individuality, is at the same time all the others—and as anexpression of this new phase of harmonious unity Jesus is brought forth,being at the same time one and many (Irenaeus Haer.1.2.5–6; etc.). Thuswe here seem to have a model according to which the Father, who is atranscendent oneness on the supreme level, gives rise to an oppositionbetween a unity-in-multiplicity and pure negativity on a second level. Thiscorresponds to what we find in authors such as Eudorus, Moderatus, andNumenius, where there is a first absolutely singular One above a secondOne, which contains the ideas and exists in opposition to the Dyad. Thus,for instance, the second One of Moderatus is the Unitary Logos, whichexists relatively to Quantity in the sense that Quantity comes into beingby privation, whereas the Unitary Logos on the contrary contains withinitself all the forms (Simplicius In phys.231.16–17 Diels). This stevrhsi\"thus corresponds to the Valentinian kevnwma, just as the eJniai'o\" lovgo\"isthe counterpart of the plhvrwma.It may be added here that this is one point, perhaps the most impor-tant one, where the Valentinian system of derivation differs from Plotinus’snotion of emanation. For the Valentinians an element of rupture seemedinevitable in their account of the relationship between the primal unityand the world. Plotinus thought he could do without such a notion.Indeed, he insists that there is no break in the flow of emanation. Thisinsistence appears to be deliberately directed against the kind of theorieswe have been discussing here. On this point, then, the Valentinians arecloser to the Neopythagorean sources common to them and Plotinus, thanis Plotinus.12Einar Thomassen"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Derivation of Matter138. “Shadow”A brief note may be inserted here on another terminological parallel,which illustrates further the kinship of thought. “Shadow(s)” (skiav) is afavorite image with the Valentinians (and other gnostics28) in their descrip-tions of the derived, purely negative, and only seemingly real, existence ofthe material principle that has been cut off from the Pleroma (e.g., Clementof Alexandria Exc.31.4; Irenaeus Haer.1.4.1; 1.11.1; Tri. Trac.77,16–17).Precisely the same image is employed by Moderatus: Matter is “a shadow(skivasma) cast by the primary non-being existing in quantity and havingdescended still further and being derived from it” (Simplicius In phys.231.4–5 Diels).9. “Limit”From the preceding discussion it should be clear that the Limit (o{ro\")which separates Sophia from the Pleroma fits neatly into the Neo-pythagorean framework. The Pythagoreans too, of course, spoke of a pevra\"delimiting the a[peironof the Dyad. The difference in vocabulary here maynot be taken as more than evidence that the Valentinians, as Christian the-ologians, made creative use of Pythagorean ideas, expressing them partly interminology invented by themselves. Nevertheless a significant verbal affin-ity is found in Moderatus, who describes how Matter is being kept in checkby the Good and is not permitted to overstep its “boundaries” (katalam-bavnetai uJp! aujtou' kai; ejxelqei'n tw'n o{rwn ouj sugcwrei'tai, Simplicius In phys.231.21–22 Diels). Also Plotinus often speaks about how the ajovristonof theDyad is delimited by an oJrismov\".29The idea of privation implied in theLimit is expressed, moreover, in Tri. Trac.76,30–34: “For the Father and theAll withdrew from him [ausakou neu sabol MmoF], in order that theboundary [pHoros] which the Father had fixed might become firm.” This,again, parallels how the Unitary Logos in Moderatus detaches from itself thematerial principle by depriving it of rational content.The functions of delimiting the unlimited and giving form to the form-less are expressed in various ways in Valentinianism. In Valentinian Expo-sitionthe Limit is said to have four powers: separation, consolidation,formation, and the giving of substance (26,31ff., 27,30ff.). In Irenaeus Haer.1.3.5 only the first two of these powers are attributed to the Limit. In thissystem, however, as well as in that of Hipp. El.6.29ff., the function of theLimit is doubled by that of Christ and the Holy Spirit (cf. Irenaeus Haer.1.2.5, Hipp. El.7.31.2). This duplication seems rather redundant and is28Cf. Poimandres14; Hyp. Arch.95,5–9; Orig. World98,17–27.29Krämer, Der Ursprung der Geistmetaphysik,312ff."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"perhaps to be explained as caused by a combination of different sources.In all these systems, however, the dyadic nature of Sophia is controlled bythe operation of one or two distinct power hypostases, the Limit and/orChrist-Holy Spirit.In the case of Tripartite Tractate, however, we find that the Son com-bines in himself both of these opposite functions. On the one hand theprojection of the Son represents, as we have seen, the dyadic function ofextension and spreading out. On the other hand it is also the Son whogives the All “firmness and a place and a dwelling-place” (65,7–8); that is,he provides the consolidation that in other texts is attributed to the opera-tion of the Limit and/or Christ-Holy Spirit. The outcome of this doubleoperation is an All, or a Pleroma, which is a multiplicity as well as a unity:The “dwelling-place” of the All is said to be a Name (65,9), which at thesame time consists of many names (65,35–67,34). Thus by attributing bothfunctions to the same hypostasis the ontologically ambiguous character ofthe Pleroma as both plurality and unity is accentuated.The combination of both functions within one hypostasis is what wefind in Plotinus as well, where the dyadic nature of the provodo\"of Mindfrom the One is complemented by the limiting act of ejpistrofhv, whenMind directs its attention to its source. By this process Mind is constitutedas a unity-in-multiplicity. It is not inconceivable that Plotinus was influ-enced by gnostic precursors on this point, but it is prima faciemore prob-able that the model of going forth and return as complementary aspectsof the process of emanation already existed in the Neopythagoreansources common to both. An indication that this is the case is providedby the remark in the Pseudo-Clementine Homiliesquoted above, that theDyad is considered to arise from the Monad by a double process ofe[ktasi\"and sustolhv(224.34 Rehm: kata; ga;r e[ktasin kai; sustolh;n hJmona;\" dua;\" ei\\nai nomivzetai).To repeat: The Valentinian structureFatherSon = nou'\"= Pleroma Sophiacorresponds to the Neopythagorean one ofFirst OneSecond One = Ideas Dyad.Sophia, just like the Dyad, is derived from, but subsequently cut off fromits noetic counterpart and deprived of rational content, so as to becomethe principle of Matter. The inner logic of the connection between the14Einar Thomassen"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Derivation of Matter15three terms is, however, to give form to the relationship between thefirst and the second. The dyadic nature of the Son, viz. the Second One,implicit in its being a first alterity is, as it were, removed from it and rel-egated to the third term. Thus, by the action of the limiting power, thesecond hypostasis remains a unity, while at the same time representingplurality. But the ambiguously double nature of the first projection mayalso be expressed (in a way more similar to Plotinus) by placing boththe dyadic extension and the limiting consolidation within one and thesame hypostasis.The subsequent phases of derivation in the Valentinian system repeatthe pattern of the initial separation—a repetition entailed by the stillunsolved ambiguity of that separation: Unity acts on formlessness, pro-ducing form through division. The following phases may be distinguished:9.1. Distinction of Spirit and SoulThis phase contains two subphases: (a) The pure negativity of the sep-arated and formless lower Sophia is first turned into receptivity for forma-tion (this is called the formation according to substance) by Christ, who issent out from the Pleroma. He extends himself beyond the Cross (= theLimit) (dia; tou' staurou' ejpektaqevnta). In physical terms this translates as amovement into the unlimited; in soteriological terms it implies that Christsubjects himself to “suffering” for the sake of Sophia by “extending him-self” on the “Cross.” Having completed his formative purpose he “with-draws” (ajnadramei'n, susteivlanta aujtou' th;n duvnamin). Here we meet againthe same Pythagorean pair of concepts that we discussed above.30In Tri-partite Tractatethis point in the process is represented by the intercessory“help” (bohvqeia) given to the abandoned aeon by the aeons in the Pleroma(81,10–82,9). It is connected with the ejpistrofhvof the fallen aeon—a termwhich here seems to refer not only to a psychological-religious metavnoiabut also to physical notions akin to the Plotinian term (cf. above).31Thusthe conversion of Sophia is also described as a phase in the derivation ofmatter, in terms of a delimitation of the dyadic extension, involving sus-tolhv, or ejpistrofhv.30Already K. Müller, “Beiträge zum Verständnis der valentinianischen Gnosis,” inNachrichten von der Königlichen: Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen(Philologisch-historische Klasse; Göttingen: Dieterichschen Buchhandlung, 1920),232, related this terminology to the platuvnesqaiand sustevllesqaiof God in Mar-cellus of Ancyra. Müller was undoubtedly on the right track here, because, as wehave pointed out above, the trinitarian doctrine of Marcellus was inspired byPythagoreanism.31The conversion, ejpistrofhv, of the fallen aeon is a constant feature of the sys-tems, cf., e.g., G. C. Stead, “The Valentinian Myth of Sophia,” JTSNS 20 (1969): 83."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"This ejpistrofhvcan also be described as an awakening of a rationalelement in the fallen aeon, and as becoming receptive of illumination bya turning upwards. This corresponds in fact to the description of the “slum-bering World Soul” in such Middle Platonists as Plutarch and Albinus/Alki-noos.32This World Soul, which is conceived by these writers according totraditions about the Dyad, is in fact aroused by the noetic God, who turnsit towards himself.33(b) In the second subphase the Savior-Jesus is sent out from the Pleromato the fallen aeon. Unlike Christ, who seems to represent a still unsettledrelation of Monad and Dyad, the Savior represents the Pleroma as a media-tion of unity and multiplicity (he is accompanied by a retinue of angels). Heforms Sophia by separating her from her passions (the formation accordingto gnosis).34As a result a division is established between the passionless,rational, and spiritual on the one side, and the passions on the other.9.2. Distinction of Soul and Matter.The same process is repeated with the passions: (a) The passions arestill incorporeal, and the Savior transforms them into a substance (eij\" oujsi-van h[gagen aujtav, Clement of Alexandria Exc.45.2); that is, he turns theminto an incorporeal Matter capable of becoming bodies (kai; ejx ajswmavtoupavqou\" eij\" ajswvmaton u{lhn metabalei'n aujta;: ei\\q! ou{tw\" ejpithdeiovthta kai;fuvsin ejmpepoihkevnai aujtoi'\", w{ste eij\" sugkrivmata kai; swvmata ejlqei'n, Ire-naeus Haer.1.4.5). This preparatory role of the Savior seems to correspondstructurally to that of Christ vis-à-vis Sophia.(b) To an inferior power, the Demiurge, is delegated the task of han-dling this substance and turning it into actual bodies. (He is, to be sure,invisibly moved by his mother Sophia). He too works essentially throughdivision and limitation, as his primary task is to separate Matter and Soul.3516Einar Thomassen32Cf.

This account of demi-urgic division is based on late Hellenistic diavkrisi\"-cosmogonies,36thedivision between the psychic and the hylic substances being conceivedalong the lines of the division between the lighter and heavier elements inthose cosmogonies. But it also fits excellently into the framework of theNeopythagorean physical theory employed by the Valentinians, as the finalstage in the derivation of Matter after a series of successive delimitations ofthe unlimited Dyad.ConclusionWe have attempted here to show that Valentinian systematic exposi-tion contains and represents a theory of physics that in its details as wellas in its underlying conception is Neopythagorean. This means that theValentinian theologians have a legitimate place in the history of ancientphilosophy—as part of the “paradigm shift” (to use, for once, this hack-neyed expression) in late antiquity from two- or three-principles theoriesto one-principle ones.Neopythagorean theories of derivation is thus an essential key to theunderstanding of the Valentinian systems. This does not imply, however,that these systems are just philosophy. They are not. They are also the ver-bal statements of the hopes and aspirations of a religion of salvation. Inthis context the tale of the fallen aeon is also an account of the fall of thesoul from its divine home. And on the collective level it is the story of theexile of a superior race of people from the divine assembly to which theybelong, and about their reintegration into it. The presence of these com-plementary, and necessary, components, does not, however, reduce thegenuine philosophical interests that also lie behind the construction of theValentinian systems.The Derivation of Matter1735,30–34 it is the Savior himself who acts in the role as dividing demiurge.

Most of what I have to say arises out of an attempt to think through somedifficult problems in the Enneads,and I must confess that until the prepara-tion for this paper I had not really appreciated the importance of gnosticthought either in itself or for an understanding of Neoplatonism. I offer myremarks here, then, as an attempt to work out the importance of Gnosticismfor an understanding of what philosophy really was for Plotinus and Porphyry.My first question is simple, but I think far-reaching. In the context ofancient thought, from Plato to Moderatus, Plutarch, Atticus, and the ChaldeanOracles(and even in Aristotle and the Stoics), space, matter, or the ultimatesubstratum of physical things is invariably described in positive, negative, orneutral (often all three) terms. What then distinguishes Plotinus’s doctrine?How are Plotinus’s views of matter really “new,” and how do we distinguishthem from gnostic views? What I shall try to show as part of an answer to thesequestions is how Plotinus develops an inner, hidden dialogue with Aristotleon the question of matter, and then later how in certain passages there is afurther level of dialogue still, and one that clearly addresses the gnostics.A similar problem is associated with the generation of matter. The der-ivation of matter from the first principle was quite common Pythagoreandoctrine in the second and first centuries B.C.E. It is also found in Modera-tus of Gades (first century C.E.) and in the Chaldean Oracles.1Now if soul’sgeneration of matter as a good, not an evil act, most separates Plotinusfrom the gnostics,2why is Plotinus so thoroughly obscure on this point that1See Diogenes Laertius 8.25 and Simplicius In phys.181.33–34 Diels.

This is a complex question,4but what I propose is simply this. Is 2.9alone intended to be the critique, or should 3.8; 5.8; and 5.5 be included(which have been shown by Harder to constitute one work, aGroßschrift)?5And if the latter, how does the whole work function as acomplex critique? If we can reach a workable conclusion on this part ofthe question, then we can compare the results with Plotinus’s analysis ofmatter to determine the context and spirit of Plotinus’s polemic.Finally, I want to turn briefly to some of the major texts of SethianGnosticism to look at the whole question of influence.

Positive and Negative Matter in PlatonismIf we examine the history of the notion of matter starting with Plato’sReceptacle, it becomes difficult to see what is so distinctive in Plotinus’s the-ory. On the one hand, Plato’s Receptacle, or cwvra, is nurse and principle ofbecoming, “that in which” things come to be, “of which” and “out of which”they are fashioned (Tim.52d). On the other hand, it is also a principle ofprecosmic disorder (30a2–6; 53b) and of active resistance to order (48a; 56c;cf. Pol.269c–270a). How the irrational disorders of this substratum are tobe related to the soul is a problem not only of the late Laws(896e–897d;904a–c) and Epinomis(988d–e), but also of the whole middle Platonic tra-dition,9which results in the evil, demiurgic world soul of Plutarch and Atti-cus,10and by contrast an evil, ungenerated matter in Numenius.11Even forAristotle, although form is contrasted with privation rather than matter withform,12the notion of matter itself ranges in meaning from positive Positive and Negative Matter216For Sethian Gnosticism see H.-M.

Thus, as has long been recognized,15the Plotinian schema of hypostases and two forms of matter are to be foundalready in Moderatus of Gades (if not in Plato himself, according to Simpli-cius). Following upon the three Ones (The One “beyond being,” the sec-ond One “truly existent,” and the third “psychic” One), Simplicius relates,“the lowest nature . . . that of the sense-realm, does not even participate, butreceives order by reflection from those others, Matter in the sense-realmbeing a shadow cast by Not-Being as it manifests itself primally in Quantity,and which is of a degree inferior even to that.”16In this general line of inter-pretation are also the Chaldean Oraclesand certain gnostic texts, as well asPlotinus and Porphyry. In the Oraclesmatter springs from the “Source ofSources” (frg. 34), is of various kinds, sometimes positive (frgs. 216; 173),and yet is also evil, even “bitter” (frg. 129).17A similar view can be foundin the Corpus hermeticum.The “downward bearing elements of nature areleft bereft of reason so as to be matter alone,” but at the same time God isthe source of “mind, nature, and matter.”18In gnostic writings, while thesource of evil is identified with entities of the spiritual world,19and while22Kevin Corrigan13For positive potentiality cf.

In the Sententiae,matter is an active principle ofevil,22and absolute nonbeing, but in the Commentary on the Timaeus,Por-phyry seems to adopt a different position, according to which matter is gen-erated from the One. Porphyry distinguishes the Father and the Demiurge.The Father generates “the whole” from himself, and the Demiurge receivesmatter from the Father. In the later history of Neoplatonism, of course, Plot-inus’s view that matter is the ultimate source of evil is rejected. For Syrianus,Proclus, and Pseudo-Dionysius, evil springs from privation or nonbeing asan accidental consequence of being.23In such a context, therefore, Ploti-nus’s theory looks rather unremarkable, a recognizable interpretative devel-opment of some difficult passages in Plato. It seems close to the doctrine ofthe Chaldean Oraclesand to certain elements in gnostic thought, particu-larly the idea of an evil matter or a darkness that “makes” other things darkPositive and Negative Matter2320On this see Hans-Martin Schenke, “The Phenomenon and Significance ofGnostic Sethianism” (note 6), 614–15.21Cf.

The Ancient Philosophy and the Inner Level of Argumentation in Enn.2.4 [12]The beginning of an answer can be found, I believe, in the Vita Plo-tini,chapter 16, where Porphyry tells us that there were at that time inRome many Christians “as well as sectarians [haeretikoi] who had aban-doned the ancient philosophy . . . and produced revelations by Zoroasterand Zostrianos and Nicotheos and Allogenes and Messos and other peopleof the kind.” Porphyry refers apparently to some of the Sethian texts of theNag Hammadi library. What is not clear, however, is his attitude to thesegnostics. The phrase aiJretikoi; de; ejk th'\" palaia'\" filosofiva\" ajnhgmevnoi(2–3) has received two mutually exclusive translations: Ficino’s ex antiquaphilosophia egressi(sc. orti) and Bouillet’s “qui s’écartaient de la philoso-phie antique” (cf. A. H. Armstrong’s translation above).24In accord with thefirst translation, and with Plotinus’s reference to the gnostics as “friends”(2.9 [33].10.3–4), H.-C. Puech held that Plotinus regarded the gnostics asbelonging to his own group and as devotees of the mysteries of Plato.25Igal, on the other hand, taking into account the obvious incompatibilitybetween the claim that the gnostics were devotees of Plato and their dis-paragement of Plato and subversion of the cosmology of the Timaeus(Vit.Plot.16.8–9; 2.9 [33].6ff.), has argued that the force of the criticism shouldbe understood in the following way: while the gnostics derive their thoughtfrom “the ancient philosophy” they go on to develop an idia hairesisthatsubverts rather than complements Platonic thought.262.9 [33].6.10–13 drawsa distinction between two groups of gnostics, those whose doctrines havebeen taken from Plato and those who have “innovated” in order to estab-lish an ijdiva filosofiva. On the basis of this, Igal concludes that with theexception of the un-Greek doctrines that Plotinus attacks at 2.9 [33].6.57–62,Plotinus is “overly eager to trace back the Gnostic doctrines to Plato,”27somuch so that he oversimplifies and comes dangerously close to treating thegnostics as kleyilovgoi. I too favor Ficino’s translation of ajnhgmevnoi. Gnos-tic doctrine is, according to Plotinus, at least, in part, derived from Plato,and one of Plotinus’s major criticisms is that the gnostics develop their own24Kevin Corrigan24See J.

However,it is plain from Plotinus’s remarks in 2.9 [33].6.10–13 and 10.3–4 that manygnostics, if not actually part of the circle of Plotinus, were indeed consid-ered to be friends and fellow philosophers. Thus, the context of Plotinus’scritique, I suggest, is not simply a polemic but rather the establishment ofa basis for rational discussion and, indeed, philosophical conversation.Hence, I take a broader, more positive view than Igal of what Plotinus isdoing in the Großschrift.I propose that Plotinus establishes an implicitbasis for rational understanding in the earlier treatises (3.8 [30]; 5.8 [31]; and5.5 [32]) and only then singles out the ijdiva ai{resi\"in 2.9.28This is consis-tent with his normal practice. He rarely cites authorities explicitly (evenPlato) but proceeds indirectly either in a hidden dialogue form or by set-ting up an argument with reference to an implicit subtext. First, then, I shalloutline this interpretation in the light of what I take to be the meaning ofthe phrase “the ancient philosophy” and with the purpose of determiningwhat is distinctive in Plotinus’s doctrine of matter-evil. Second, I shallexamine the generation of matter and the descent of the soul, and, finally,I shall give a brief analysis of what I take to be the overall context of theGroßschrift.What is “the ancient philosophy” for our understanding of the contextof Plotinus’s writings? Its most conspicuous source is Plato, but in Por-phyry’s famous estimate, Plotinus’s writings are full of hidden Stoic andPeripatetic doctrines. Aristotle’s Metaphysics,in particular, “is condensed inthem” (Vit. Plot.14.6–8), and Middle Platonic (Severus, Gaius, Atticus) aswell as Neopythagorean (Cronius and Numenius) and Peripatetic com-mentaries (Aspasius, Adrastus, Alexander) were read in the school meet-ings. While these obviously helped to form a context for Plotinus’s ownwritings, Plotinus’s thinking itself took “a distinctive personal line” in itscontemplative scrutiny (i[dio\"...kai; ejxhllagmevno\" ejn th/' qewriva), Porphyrystresses, and brought “the mind of Ammonius” (about which we know lit-tle or nothing)29to bear on the investigation at hand.30Plotinus’s charac-teristic approach, then, was not to speak directly out of a textbook but totake his own creative line of argumentation derived from the context ofancient philosophy, with Stoic and Aristotelian dogmataconcentrated in ahidden, implicit way in its subtext. This is, at least, what Porphyry claims,and if true, it may well help to distinguish Plotinian and gnostic writings.Positive and Negative Matter2528See especially 2.9 [33].6.2–12; cf. 9.26–31, 45–51, 74–83.29On Ammonius Saccas, see F.

However, 3.6 [26], which is arguably the most Platonic of thethree treatises, contains a central argument that stems from Aristotle. If matter isimpassible, in what sense is this to be understood? Only formal, specific contrariescan produce affections. For example, the hot and the cold work upon each other,and so too the red or not red, or blue, but not the red and the cold. But if matterunderlies contraries, then it cannot be affected like compound subjects. Therefore,the affection that matter undergoes requires a different manner of speaking (3.6 [26]chs. 8–10, especially 11.24–25).34On “agreement” between Plato and Aristotle, see A. H.

In this latter portionof the work, his starting point is an orthodox statement of Aristotelian-Peripatetic doctrine.35Matter plays a positive role in the composition anddissolution of compounds (2.4 [12].6), and Plotinus even takes a chapterto point out the cogency of Aristotelian thought against earlier pre-Socraticviews (7). In the following chapters he explores the meaning of the indef-initeness of matter, namely, that it is not quantity, quality, or any of theother categories, and he even provides a compelling view of what itmeans to say that we experience indefiniteness (10–11). He argues sub-sequently that while privation does relate to form, it also surely charac-terizes the very lack of nature in matter too:If then it is non-existent because it is not being, but some other existingthing different from being, the definitions are two, one comprising thesubstrate, and that of privation making clear its relationship to the otherexisting things. (2.4 [12].14.22–24)Plotinus is sensitive to Aristotle’s insistence that form is opposed to privation, not matter, and therefore that the definitions of matter and pri-vation should differ. However, he thinks that Aristotle does not go nearlyfar enough:Or perhaps the definition of matter shows its relationship to other thingsand that of the substrate also shows its relationship to other things, butthat of privation, if it shows the indefiniteness of matter, might actuallytouch upon it itself; but in this case they are both one in substratum, buttwo in rational definition. But if privation, by being indefinite and unlim-ited and without qualities, is the same thing as matter, how do the defi-nitions still remain two? (10.24–30)Plotinus starts with a tentative suggestion (tavca) and concludes with aquestion! Why does he do this, particularly at such a critical juncture of hisargument, namely, the ultimate reference of privation that “might actuallytouch upon” indefiniteness and matter? The answer, I propose, is that with-out ever mentioning Aristotle, Alexander, Aspasius, or any Peripatetic byname, Plotinus has constructed an inner dialogue with Peripatetic philoso-phy on the nature of matter at the level of indefiniteness and this is basedPositive and Negative Matter2735See the assessment of E. Bréhier in his Notice to 2.4 [12] in Les Ennéades dePlotin(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1924–1938), 49–50. 2.4 [12] 6 and 7 are a faithfulcommentary of Metaph.12.2, in Bréhier’s view, probably Peripatetic in origin."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"on the text of Aristotle. Thus, the introduction of avpeivrw/at line 29 (themeaning of which he will explore in the next chapter) is an implicit appealto the reader of Aristotle’s Physics:the “infinite” is not the container, butthe contained, and it is a cause as matter whose being is privation (to; me;nei\\nai aujtw/' stevrhsi\"in 207b35–208a2). Indeed, more than an echo of Aris-totle’s sophisticated notion of infinity pervades the final chapter (16) of 2.4.According to Aristotle, it is characteristic of the infinite that “one thing isalways being taken after another” (Phys.206a27–28). For Plotinus, matteris always “other” (2.4 [12].16.26), not in the sense of Platonic “otherness”from the Sophist(16.1–3), for “what it is it becomes still more” (16.15–16).36Thus, Plotinus concludes against Aristotle’s criticism that the Platonistsmake matter desire its own extinction (Phys.192a16–25), that on the con-trary, matter’s desire for form “brings what it is naturally to actuality andperfection, like the unsown field when it is sown” (16.11–16).37Thisremarkable conclusion indicates the hidden, revolutionary nature of histransformation of the notion of matter. Matter’s negative, “misformed,” evilnature is a direct function of its positive role in generation. When the com-pound physical thing becomes formed or limited, matter is the recipient ofform, and the coming-to-be of the compound would be impossible with-out that recipient. Hence, in the light of form, matter is positive, for itbecomes shaped in compounds and possesses a natural potentiality in thisshaping. In its own nature, however, a nature necessarily devoid of all thecategories of being, matter is revealed as absence or privation by the verypresence of form itself. For Plotinus, therefore, the negative, evil nature ofmatter is a necessary development of Aristotle’s own thought, whichstopped short at the name of “indefiniteness” and did not pursue the analy-sis, as he implicitly thinks it should have done, into the privative nature ofthe indefinite substratum itself.2.4 [12], then, provides us with a perfect example of Plotinus’s method.First, since the topic is matter, the question of Aristotle’s opposition to thePlatonic view has to be confronted. The object, I suggest, is not to reconcile28Kevin Corrigan36Cf. 2.5 [25].5.3–7.37See also the words immediately following this: “and as when the female con-ceives by the male, and does not lose its femaleness but becomes still more female”(13–15). Most probably this reflects Aristotle Phys.192a22–25. There is no spacehere for an examination of the role of the feminine in Plotinus’s accounts of mat-ter. Any treatment would, however, have to take account of Plotinus’s treatment ofPenia(Plato’s Symposium) especially in III, 5 [50] and I, 8 [51] 14. For a fascinatingaccount of part of this topic in gnostic thought, see Birger A. Pearson, “The Figureof Norea in Gnostic Literature,” in Proceedings of the International Colloquium onGnosticism, Stockholm, August 20–25, 1973(ed. G.

Second, if thisis “the ancient philosophy,” then what Plotinus practices is not the citingof authority (though he sometimes does that too) but the development ofan inner conversation (in the reflection of Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, etc.)that is based upon shared discovery rather than private revelation. All inall, then, it is a mistake to suppose either that Plotinus gets more pes-simistic about matter as he gets older or, conversely, that it is only in theearlier writings that he thinks about matter in a dualistic way and that in“combating the Gnostics he came to more optimistic thoughts.”38Plotinus’smature view is already implicit in 2.4 [12] but, of course, it is not yet fullydeveloped. What we can say at this stage is that if the positive and nega-tive functions of matter are so interrelated, then there has to be a positiveview of matter and of the cosmos in the light of form or lovgo\". Further-more, the cause of evil cannot simply be located in the lovgo\"or in an igno-rant demiurge, since whatever privation there might be in the soul, itsultimate cause has to be traced to matter in the sense of final deficiency.On the other hand, to locate evil simply and solely in an apparently inde-pendent and ungenerated matter, as Numenius appears to do, is not pos-sible on the terms of Plotinus’s theory, because then one leaves thecorrelative, but predominant, positive function of matter out of account.3. The Generation of Matter and Some Difficult Passages in the Enneads:A Hidden Dialogue with the Gnostics?It is at least in part this subtle analysis of matter with its inner level ofhidden conversation that, I believe, is responsible for one of the majormysteries of the Enneads,namely, the problem of the generation of mat-ter. Schwyzer holds that it is not generated, O’Brien and others (myselfincluded) that it is.39But why should Plotinus be so cagey on the issue?O’Brien recently suggested (in an as yet unpublished paper) that this Positive and Negative Matter2938See H.-C.

The Critical Background: 3.4 [15].1; 4.8 [6].6; 2.9 [33].3O’Brien has recently devoted an entire book to the criticism of a smallarticle I published in 1986 on the generation of matter.43There I tried toshow that certain difficult passages in the Enneadsconstrain us to acceptthat Plotinus views the generation of matter in several, rather differentways and consequently that a rigid two-tier theory of matter, Intelligibleand Sensible matter, is not entirely adequate to the subtlety and richnessof all Plotinus’s analyses. I argued, in particular, that only one passage inthe Enneads,3.4 [15].1, yields conclusive proof (without need of any fur-ther “argument”) that matter is generated by the partial soul, but that otherpassages trace this generation to soul in its integrity and that lower mattermay even be said to be an implicit consequence of the emergence of Oth-erness from the One, disclosed only as lowermatter by its remaining eter-nally “unlit.”44I further argued (against O’Brien) that lower matter doesparticipate in the good precisely and only to the degree it is formed, andI also tried to show that when Plotinus talks hypothetically in a later trea-tise about soul generating matter in undergoing an affection (paqou'sa, 1.8[51].14.51), this is a position that he can also assimilate, and I establishedparallels for this in other treatises.45I still hold to this overall view, and O’Brien’s two recent books on thistopic fail to persuade me otherwise.

Of course, he rejects mypositive view of lower matter, but despite his excessive criticism of my arti-cle, he is now prepared to trace the generation of matter to soul in itsintegrity and to accept the “affection” of soul as Plotinus’s own view in hismost recent work.46As far as I can tell, these were not features of his ear-lier articles.47Let this serve as a preface and context for the approach Ishall take here on the generation of matter.Surely it is remarkable that only one passage in the Enneadsshouldyield conclusive proof (without need of any further argument) that matteris generated by the partial, but pure soul (in this case the soul as a powerof growth).48“What is generated,” Plotinus states at 3.4 [15].1.10–12, “is nolonger a form of soul, but absolute indefiniteness” (ajoristivan...pantelh').“Absolute indefiniteness” can signify nothing else but matter. Plotinus con-tinues: “When it is perfected it becomes a body, receiving the form appro-priate to its potentiality” (14–15). This conspicuous statement should refutethe widely held view that matter as such has no positive potentiality forPlotinus. In fact, it echoes the conclusion of 2.4 [12].16: even “misformed”matter or ultimate evil is “preserved in being” and “brought to ejnevrgeiaand teleivwsi\"” by form (11–13). The positive-negative doctrine of matteris, therefore, connected with Plotinus’s view of its generation. Unfortu-nately, however, all other passages relating to its generation are ambigu-ous (5.2 [11].1.18–27; 5.1 [10].7.46–48; 2.3 [52].18.10–13; 4.3 [27].9.20–26; 3.9[13].3; 1.8 [51].14.51–54).49Plotinus may be referring to body or matter, orthe view expressed may be only hypothetical, and so on. Yet Plotinus’sposition is relatively clear. The partial soul generates matter not by any sin-ful inclination (as Plotinus makes clear also in his critique of the gnosticsin 2.9),50but as a function of its being soul.The situation is, however, much more complex than this initial state-ment might lead us to believe. What seems characteristic of these and otherambiguous passages is how far Plotinus seems to leave the question openPositive and Negative Matter3146D.

For analysis, see the works cited in note 39.50See 2.9 [33].8.39–43: Do souls descend by compulsion or voluntarily? Plotinusasks of the Gnostics. These two alternatives do not exclude one another: the soul’sdescent is both voluntary (without being chosen) and necessary (without compul-sion). Cf. 4.3.13.17–20 and also the fine analysis of O’Brien, Théodicée plotiniènne,théodicée gnostique(note 2), 5–18, which points out the (Aristotelian) distinctionbetween “will” and “choice.”"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"or to allow the reader to form his or her own view. Thus in 4.8.6, two pos-sibilities are presented, but on both, Plotinus argues, matter must be takento participate in good:The nature of matter, then, either existed for ever, and it was impossiblefor it, since it existed, not to participate in that which grants all things asmuch good as each one of them can take; or else its coming into beingwas a necessary consequence of the causes before it, and not even so wasit required to be separate because that which gave it existence as a kindof gracious gift became stationary through lack of power before it cameto it. (18–23)But if one adopts the first alternative, there is little reason not to adopt thesecond, because if an independent matter participates in some way in thegood, why should one continue to think of it as originally independent? Ofcourse, to the degree that matter is not a cause, but an accidental nature(as Aristotle might define this in Phys.2), the viewpoint that it alwaysexisted as independent still perhaps makes some sense as an initial posi-tion. O’Brien holds that the first of these alternatives must concern intelli-gible matter, since sensible matter cannot participate. But surely Plotinus isarguing with a hidden interlocutor here, quite possibly a gnostic, and hewants to make the point that whichever point of view one takes—the ulti-mate abandonment of matter or its consequential connectedness withbeing—one is effectively compelled to the same conclusion.A more direct dialogue and similar alternative theories about matterare to be found in the explicit critique of the gnostics in 2.9.3, where Plot-inus insists on the eternal dependence of the physical world on intelligibleillumination. If “anyone says” (ti\"...levgoi) that generated things will becorrupted into matter, then why, Plotinus argues, “should he not also say”that the matter will be corrupted? But if “he is going to say” (fhvsei) that, what necessity was there, “we will say” (fhvsomen), for it tocome into being?51Plotinus then takes up the two alternatives, the aban-donment of matter or its connectedness with being (here recognizablygnostic), which he had presented in 4.8 [6].6:But if they will say [fhvsousi] that it was necessary for it to come into beingas a consequence of the existence of higher principles [parakolouqei'n],the necessity is there now as well. But if matter is going to remain alone,the divine principles will not be everywhere . . . they will be, so to speak,walled off from matter; but if this is impossible, matter will be illuminatedby them.

This gives us a clear insight into onepurpose of ambiguity in the Enneads.Ambiguity is a rational means ofrespecting the presence of an explicit or implicit interlocutor and of pro-viding sufficient openness for an inner dialogue to be effective. Finally,since the “aloneness” of lower matter is a recognizably gnostic viewpointthat Plotinus rejects in 2.9 [33].3, and since there is a precise sense in which“lower” matter may be said to participate (namely, to the degree that mat-ter is formed), then I conclude that both alternatives in 4.8 [6].6 refer tolower matter.3.2. 2.5 [25].5 and 2.4 [12].5: Lower Matter and Intelligible MatterLet us take another curious passage about matter from 2.5 [25].5.Although to the best of my knowledge no one has yet proposed this, thereare echoes of a gnosticizing mythology in this chapter. Matter is, “so tospeak, cast out and utterly separated” from the Intelligible (2.5 [25].11–12),just as the intention or desire of the higher Sophia becomes “cast out intothe spaces of the Shadow and the Void” in the form of the lower Sophiain Valentinian Gnosticism.52Matter has “walked out of true being” (28),like a gnostic personification of passion giving rise to matter.It was not anything actually from the beginning, since it stood apart fromall realities, and it did not become anything; it has not been able to takeeven a touch of colour from the things which wanted to plunge into it, butremaining directed to something else it exists potentially to what comesnext; when the realities of the intelligible world had already come to an endit appeared and was caught by the things that came into being after it andtook its place as the last after these two. So, being caught [kataleifqei'sa]by both, it could belong to neither class of realities; it is only left for it tobe potentially a sort of weak and dim phantasm unable to receive a shape.So it is actually a phantasm [ei[dwlon] . . . a falsity. (12–23)The negative side is emphasized here, but the positive function is implicit,if puzzling, for matter has come out of the Intelligible and therefore mustbe traced back to the first outpouring of otherness from the One, as alsoin 2.4 [12].5.28–37. But what can it mean to be “cast out” of the Intelligi-ble? Is it, perhaps, that matter is included in the first emanation from theOne as a result of Otherness? Is it then only disclosed as matter because itremains unillumined in its own nature and, therefore, escapes the realm ofPositive and Negative Matter3352Cf. Jonas, The Gnostic Religion(note 4), 62–65, 182–196. See also the Ap.

Iam not sure if this is the correct interpretation, but it certainly seems to fitat least two difficult passages in the Enneads(2.4 [12].5 and 2.5 [25].5).Please observe that this interpretation does not deny that the partial soulgenerates matter, but rather puts this in the context of the integral emana-tion of the two lower hypostases, Intellect and Soul. The whole content ofsoul, and matter too, is implicitly contained within the first movement fromthe One, but since the partial soul, or the lowest creative part of the WorldSoul, is higher than the whole of physical existence, it is still the partialsoul—a pure, partial soul—which generates and informs matter.At any rate, this is how I interpret 2.4 [12].5.28–37:For Otherness There . . . makes (intelligible) matter; for this is the princi-ple of matter, this and the primary Movement. For this reason Movementtoo was called otherness....The Movement and Otherness which camefrom the First are undefined, and need the First to define them; and theyare defined when they turn to it. But before the turning, matter, too, wasundefined and the Other and not yet good, but unilluminated from theFirst. For if light comes from the First, then that which receives the light,before it receives it has everlastingly [ajeiv] no light; but it has light as otherthan itself, since the light comes to it from something else.First, the matter of the Intelligible World is generated by Otherness (per-haps a significant difference from the Chaldean Oracles,frg. 34, wherematter is generated directly from the “Source”), but in its conversionbecomes a fully formed oujsiva. Plotinus refers to this as “the dark,” but itsdarkness is different from that of lower matter, which is an “outcast” dark-ness—or at least so Plotinus tells us in 2.5 [25].5. Here in 2.4 [12].5 heremarks: “the depth [bavqo\"] of each thing is matter” (quite probably areflection of frg. 163 in the Chaldean Oracles).53Whatever intelligibledarkness is in 2.4 [12].5, then, it is related to the intelligible substratum thatis formed substance.54Thus, the Infinite or “dark other” of later Neopla-tonism that is “the principle of life, fecundity and creative expansion”5534Kevin Corrigan53Chald.

How canintelligible matter everlastingly have no light? Is this simply a way of say-ing that all intelligible moments must effectively be eternal? I suggested inmy Phronesisarticle that lower matter is implicitly contained in thisdescription, for only lower matter is truly in itself a recipient eternally inthe state of being before receiving.I do not deny that Plotinus is talking pri-marily about intelligible matter (though, of course, bothmatters have beenincluded in the discussion of the chapter up to this point), but since intel-ligible matter is defined in its oujsivaby the intelligible form that shapes it,while lower matter remains “other,” indeed “alien” to the form that appearsin it, I think it most likely that Plotinus implicitly includes lower matter inhis thinking about the integral emanation of everything from the Onethrough the First Otherness and First Movement.In sum, the two forms of darkness, Intelligible and Sensible, are to bedistinguished only by the form that renders them different, as Plotinusstates very clearly in 2.4 [12].5.59Since distinction between the two is nota question of easy resolution within a single phrase or one description, Isuggest that the whole of these two treatises, 2.4 [12] and 2.5 [25], are sys-tematic rational attempts to explore this fundamental ambiguity of darknesseither in relation to, or by contrast with, the form that shapes it.Positive and Negative Matter3556Proclus In Tim.I [24d–e], 176 Diehl; In Parm.6.1119.4–11, 23–31; Elem.

Consequences: The Development of a Pathology of Evil in 1.8 [51]: AGenuine Comparison and Dialogue with Gnostic ThoughtNonetheless, Plotinus’s language in 2.4 [12].5 and, even more so, hisgnostic description of an exiled matter in 2.5 [25].5 (effectively a descrip-tion of the fall of matter) remain puzzling (particularly in the latter case,at the end of a discussion of potential and actual existence). Angels orsouls or mental attributes may fall in gnostic or Platonic myths, but it ismuch more difficult to see how matter as nonbeing or privation canundergo such a fall. Can Plotinus actually be interpretingtheir own mythsfor the gnostics themselves, but along the lines of his own thought? If thisis so, there is a price to be paid, for if Plotinus conducts such a hiddenconversation in argument, description, or phrase, then the gnostics cer-tainly have the right to ask whether his notion of matter is any more com-pelling or consistent than their own. If one refuses to anthropomorphizeor personify ultimate evil, but nonetheless continues to employ anthro-pomorphic language, then the question how evil can actually have realnegative effects becomes pressing. How can an absolutely indeterminatematter cause evil? The very notion seems unthinkable. And how couldsuch nothingness be related to the soul? Can the soul or lovgo\"reallyremain pure in generating matter, and what really happens when the soulbecomes evil?These questions, indeed, Plotinus confronts right at the end of hislife, in his fifty-first treatise (1.8), and I propose that this is partly becauseof his continued implicit conversation with the gnostics, as well asbecause of his explicit critique that we will examine separately below. Atany rate, despite Heinemann and Thedinga’s reservations about this latework,60Plotinus actually succeeds in creating an effective pathology ofevil in 1.8 [51] by means of the notion of matter as antisubstance, whichis surely made possible by Aristotle’s language in Gen. corr.3 and alsoby Alexander of Aphrodisias’s notion of holistic fields of the virtues andvices opposed by their contrary natures.61Matter, Plotinus argues, can benonsubstance or antisubstance, not as the negation of individual sub-stance, but rather as the universal negation of all beings, by virtue of itsuniversal opposition to form. Other contraries are either in the samespecies or genus and, therefore, have generic or quasi-generic “matter”to unite them (1.8 [51].6.36–38, 56–59; Aristotle Metaph.1.1054b27–30).36Kevin Corrigan60F.

There is, therefore, no “way between them” and,thus, he cites Aristotle’s Metaph.1.4 in the closing lines of the chapter toindicate clearly that these two opposed groups form “the greatest differ-ence.”63And in the following chapters he develops a theory of the com-plements of these opposed wholes.64Here, again, we uncover a hidden dialogue with Aristotle and the Peri-patetics behind a text that looks primarily Platonic. Again, there is a subtleinterweaving of latent strands from the thought of “ancient philosophy”into the development of a new and distinctive line of inquiry. I shall showthat there is still another level of dialogue present even in this complexsubtext, a dialogue—however indirect—with the gnostics. I shall cite onlytwo examples that I think bear comparison.3.4. The Affection of Soul and the Fall of Nous: 1.8 [51] and Gnostic ThoughtIt is sometimes remarked that there is nothing in Plotinus like the fail-ure, weakness, ignorance, and sickness of the Logosin gnostic thought.65This may be true, but Plotinus nonetheless develops his own version ofthis at different levels of descent. Parallel to the curiosity of the Demi-urge or the boldness and self-determination of the fall in gnosticthought,66are, of course, the tovlmaand self-determination (aujtexouvsio\")Positive and Negative Matter3762Cf.

In 1.8 [51] Plotinus develops two variations on thefall of the lovgo\", the first in relation to soul:That which does not stay like this (soul in perfect intentness upon Intel-lect) but goes out from itself because it is not perfect or primary but is asort of ghost [i[ndalma] of the first soul, because of its deficiency, as far asit extends, is filled with indefiniteness and sees darkness, and has matterby looking at that which it does not look at (as we say that we see dark-ness as well as the things we actually see). (1.8 [51].4.28–32)69The second variation in relation to Intellect is even more pertinent:So this intellect which sees matter is another intellect which is not intel-lect, since it presumes [tolmhvsa\"] to see what is not its own . . . so intel-lect leaving its own light in itself and as it were going outside itself andcoming to what is not its own, by not bringing its own light with it expe-riences [e[paqe] something contrary to itself that it may see its contrary. (1.8[51].9.18–26)In the early Enneadswe hear of partial soul “as it were, walking on air andbecoming more indefinite” (3.9 [13].3.11–12), and the problem of the cog-nition of nonbeing or darkness is part of Plotinus’s thinking from 2.4 [12].10onwards. Nonetheless, the idea that nou'\"has the tovlmato undergo theaffection of its opposite is a genuine development in Plotinus’s thinking. Itis equivalent to intellect de-intelligizing itself, and it seems to me that Plot-inus is talking—perhaps indirectly—to gnostics in these passages. I pro-pose that Plotinus may have in mind a strikingly parallel passage fromZostrianos(or one rather like it) which describes the scattering and returnof man in remarkably similar terms:If he withdraws to himself alone many times, and if he comes into beingwith reference to the knowledge of the others, Mind and the immortal[Origin] will not understand. Then it has a shortage,...for he turns, has38Kevin Corrigan675.1 [10].1.3–5: “The beginning of evil for them was the tovlmaand gevnesi\"andthe first Otherness and the wish to belong to themselves.”683.7 [45].11.15–17: “But since there was a restlessly active nature [fuvsew\"...polupravgmono\"] which wanted to control itself and be on its own, this moved, andtime moved with it.”69Cf. 5.2 [11].1.18–27."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"nothing and separates from it and stands . . . and comes into being by analien [impulse. . . ], instead of becoming one. Therefore, he bears manyforms. When he turns aside, he comes into being seeking these things thatdo not exist.

Thus he comes down to birth becauseof it and is speechless because of the pains and infiniteness of matter.Although he possesses an eternal and immortal power he is bound withinthe [movement] of the body. He is [made] alive and is bound [always]within cruel, cutting bonds by every evil breath, until he [acts] again andbegins again to come to his senses. (Zost.VIII 45,12–46,15)This passage70is, of course, much influenced by Plato’s Timaeus,andthere is also a hint in the phrase “infiniteness of matter” of the “bottomlesssea of unlikeness” (Pol.273d6–e1), which Plotinus cites in his descriptionof the fall and eventual awakening of the soul in the “mud of Hades” in1.8 [51].13. The focus of the passage, however, is different from Plotinus (ifnot Plato), for it appears to describe birth as a fall (whether literal ormetaphorical one cannot tell), whereas Plotinus is concerned to show hownou'\"can experience that which nullifies and even transforms it. Nonethe-less, there appear to be important points of agreement between Zostrianosand 1.8 [51]. In both, there is a first “fall” in thought and then a knowing“in another way.” In addition, the “ultimate” cause of the fall in Zostrianosis perhaps nature, but more probably “the pains and infiniteness of mat-ter,” whereas the first cause seems to reside in the soul or lovgo\", whichresults in ignorance and weakness.But how precisely is the relation between matter and soul to be con-ceived, and where is the responsibility for any fall to be located? Theseproblems Plotinus takes up directly in 1.8 [51].14. The pure soul, which isPositive and Negative Matter3970[Sieber-Layton’s translation should be modified: VIII 45 12“When (this type)repeatedly withdraws 13into itself alone 14and is occupied with 15the knowledgeof other things, 16since the intellect and immortal [soul] do [not] 17intelligize, itthereupon 18experiences deficiency, 19for it too turns, has nothing, and 20sepa-rates from it (the intellect) and 21stands [apart] and experiences 22an alien[impulse] 23instead of becoming a unity. 24So that (type of person) resemblesmany forms. 25And when it turns aside, it 26comes into being seeking those thingsthat 27do not exist.

But the presence of matter obscures the illumi-nation and darkens soul’s vision (38–43). This is not ajfaviresi\", but thepresence of something alien (avllovtrion) (33–34). Thus, all of the soul’spowers are prevented from operation:matter hinders them from coming by occupying the place which soulholds and producing a kind of cramped condition, and making evil whatit has got hold of by a sort of theft—until soul manages to escape backto its higher state. (1.8 [51].14.46–49)72But at the conclusion of the chapter, Plotinus offers a slightly differentanswer to an implicit interlocutor:For even if soul herself had produced matter having undergone someaffection, and if she had communicated with it and become evil, matterwould have been the cause by its presence; for soul would not have cometo it unless its presence had given soul the occasion of coming to birth.(51–54)What sort of view does the hidden interlocutor hold? Certainly, as in theZostrianospassage, he seems to take birth and the moral fall of soul to beequivalent, yet he also distinguishes between an original pathosof somesort and a subsequent fall. Perhaps too he holds that soul is primarilyresponsible for evil as well as for the generation of what comes after it. Atthe same time, however, he seems ready to acknowledge that matter also40Kevin Corrigan71Cf. Alexander of Aphrodisias Quaestiones17.8–19.15.72The final conversion of soul, a pronounced Platonic motif, is to be foundboth here and in Zostrianos.Note too the emphasis on the “alien” (ajllovtrion) in1.8 [51].14.24 (cf. 3.36) and in Zostrianos.At 1.8 [51].15, in the unsettling of soulas it “touches upon” a lower nature, fantasivais a plhgh; ajlovgou e[xwqenwhich isreceived by the soul because of its multiplicity (cf. Zostrianos,“bearing [“resem-bles” JDT] many forms,” evidently influenced by the Republic) whereas “theimpulse to nousis different” (cf. Zostrianos“eternal and immortal power,” 1.8[51].15.12–21). The “cruel [“strong” JDT] cutting bonds” of the latter become forPlotinus, in the final words of 1.8, “beautiful fetters” by which evil is hidden (1.8[51].15.24–28). For almost the same conception as in Plotinus, however, see theApocryphon of John,esp. II 10,14–19: “And she surrounded it [the consequencesof her desire] with a luminous cloud [a hint of the Nephele story which gives birthto the centaurs?] and she placed a throne in the middle of the cloud so that noone might see it except the holy Spirit, who is called the mother of the living.And she called his name Yaltabaoth.” For the bonds upon evil see also Trim. Prot.XIII 41,18."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"plays a definite, if subordinate role. If this is a correct reading of the sub-text, then the hidden interlocutor exactly matches the Zostrianostext. Plot-inus, then, argues a similar case here in 1.8 [51].14 as he had done in 4.8[6].6. Either the soul is pure, but the illumination becomes darkened by thepresence of matter which begs like an exclusus amatorfor entry (1–50); oreven if the soul does undergo some affection in generating matter, thuscoming to birth, and subsequently still by a different kind of act or know-ing becomes evil, still matter is the cause of its descent and fall. AlthoughPlotinus does not express his meaning clearly, we might say that matter isthe deficient cause ex parte privationis,soul the formal cause ex parte boni.The two go together, but even in the case of an evil soul the privation hasto be traced to the matter. The conditional clause beginning with kai; ga;reij aujth; hJ yuch;is not unreal.73Plotinus can hold both of the above alter-natives from different points of view: according to the first alternative, soulremains undescended; according to the second, soul proceeds from itsabiding nature and does undergo an affection, but the affection itself is nota sinful fall. There are, indeed, examples of such an “affection” in theEnneads.74Plotinus’s point, therefore, would seem to be this: whicheverview of matter and evil the gnostics take (darkened illumination or psy-chic-noetic entity subject to affection or both), the cause of weakness andprivation in the soul must be traced to the matter. The ambiguities of thispassage and of others like it in the Enneads,then, are not due to Plotinusstating his own point of view or failing to do so, but rather to the fact thatthere is a hidden dialogue inside a dialogue, which sets out alternativestrands of reasoning so that the hidden interlocutors can enter into theargument and make it their own.First, then, I propose that the correlative positive-negative functions ofmatter analyzed in 2.4 [12].1–16 are also important for understanding howPlotinus approaches the tricky question of the derivation, generation, andyet abandonment of matter. Here we seem to be presented prima faciewith apparently mutually exclusive positions. Both, however, come fromdifferent viewpoints and can therefore be embraced by a more compre-hensive position. For Plotinus, in fact, they seem to form part of a persua-sive argument against a variety of possible opponents, gnostics, Numenius,Plutarch, or Atticus. Second, I want to suggest that 1.8 [51] as a projectarose out of a peculiarly gnostic challenge. Yaltabaoth, the personificationof aggressive, demonic evil, is a much more likely evil champion thanPositive and Negative Matter4173On this, see the works cited in note 39.74 See Corrigan “Is There More Than One Generation of Matter in the Enneads?”(note 39), 174–75 and notes 21, 22, 23.

The challenge for Plotinus, therefore, was to estab-lish the foundations for a morphology and pathology of evil (that is, howdoes evil “make” anything?). This he does, typically on developed Aris-totelian terms, but with a clear eye for the central gnostic-character of thewhole project. Finally, if I am right so far in this, then the context forunderstanding Plotinus’s explicit critique of the gnostics becomes a littleclearer. A rational framework, established on the basis of a dialogue withthe thought of some of the major ancient philosophers, is the occasion inwhich a further dialogue, be it with the gnostics or Numenius, etc., canbegin to emerge. Or, in other words, a dialogue within a dialogue forms aconversation in which criticisms can be immediately located in a compre-hensible context and, therefore, have more force. If I am right, then thisform should characterize the nature of the Großschriftas a whole. And ifthis is so, then I propose that we should be alive to the real possibility thatall of the treatises after the Großschrift,especially those with cognate inter-ests such as 6.7 [38] and 6.8 [39], will bear similar traces of such a dialogue.In which case, and in the sense we have specified, Plotinus is certainlyinfluenced by the gnostics, for some of his most mature thought is shapedby an implicit conversation with them.4. The Großschrift:Ancient Philosophy (Aristotle), Productive Contemplation, and the Dialogue with the GnosticsWhat then of 2.9 [33] and its relation to other treatises of theGroßschrift? Is the whole work or only 2. 9 [33] itself a critique of the gnos-tics? With the majority of recent critics75I support the first alternative. Even42Kevin Corrigan75V. Cilento, Plotino.

Plot.5.33) to “Against those who say that theUniverse and its Maker are evil,” but returns in his edition to the original title.Cilento and Henry (Études plotiniennes,vol. 1: Les états du texte de Plotin(2d ed.;Museum Lessianum, Section philosophique 21; Paris: Desclée de Brouwer; Brus-sels: L’Édition universelle, 1948), held that the second title was more in the style of"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Positive and Negative Matter43the positive exposition of the first three treatises is somehow a part of thewhole critique. But if so, in what sense? I have suggested above that Plot-inus establishes a rational context where conversation can take place andpoints of similarity or difference can be examined. Is this “dialogue withina dialogue” a fruitful (and demonstrable) way of understanding the wholework? Further, does the work tell us anything more about Plotinus’s theoryof matter-evil?One brief question before we try to give an answer to the above: ArePlotinus’s opponents Sethian gnostics or Valentinian, perhaps Ptolemaeangnostics?76I do not think that the scope of Plotinus’s argument can be cur-tailed, for this argument has clear application to many groups. JohnTurner’s comparison of Sethian texts and Plotinus is, to my mind,absolutely convincing.77Plotinus, then, is addressing a wider group, but hePlotinus himself. Goulet-Cazé has recently suggested that Porphyry probablyadopted the title to fit the subject matter of the second Ennead(L. Brisson et al.,Porphyre: La Vie de Plotin,vol. 1: Travaux préliminaires et index grec complet[His-toire des doctrines de l’antiquité classique 16. Paris: J. Vrin, 1992], 302 n. 1).76Igal (“The Gnostics and ‘The Ancient Philosophy’ in Plotinus,” [note 8]) arguesthat Plotinus’s oversimplification and reinterpretation of gnostic doctrine has thefollowing significant features: (1) It is a four-storied system consisting of four mainAeons. (2) The first three recall Numenius’s three Gods. (3) The fourth, which Plot-inus names Soul, has Sophiain its orbit. (4) The Aeon Sophiais to be distinguishedfrom her image in the nether world. (5) For Plotinus (2.9 [33].6.15–19, 55–56) thesystem derives for the most part from Tim.39e but is impaired by misunderstand-ings (2.9 [33].6.19)—four, not three, Hypostases and inconvenient additions (super-fluous growth of Aeons, cf. 2.9 [33].6.28–31, 56–57). Plotinus keeps the Pleromadoctrine separate from the cosmological theses (Igal, 142 and notes). This system,he goes on to argue, is different from anything in Zostrianos, Allogenes,or Hyp-siphrone,being much closer to the Ptolemaean Pleromaof (1) The Ogdoad— “par-ent, root, and basis of all” (Irenaeus Haer.1.1.1), (2) The Ogdoadnamed by fournames: Bythos, Nous, Logos,and Anthropos,(3) Sophiaas the youngest Aeon,belonging to the sphere of the fourth syzygy (Irenaeus Haer.1.1.3), and (4) a dou-ble Sophia,an apparent innovation of Ptolemaeus (Igal, n. 43). In Ptolemaeus, thefirst Aeon is a Pre-Principle (Proarche), the second is Nous,the third Logos,and thefourth Anthropos-Ekklesia.Igal suggests that Plotinus’s equation of the fourth Aeonwith Soul was because of his own identification of man with soul and his own con-ception of soul as one and many at all levels (Igal, 143–44).77The arguments of Igal and Turner are not, in fact, incompatible. Turner(“Gnosticism and Platonism” [n. 6]), independent of Igal, argues by contrast that thetreatises of the Allogenesgroup themselves derive the ontological structure of theirtranscendent world and of the visionary ascent through it, as well as their negativetheology, from sources “at home in Platonism” (451). While Plotinus does not seemto attack the Sethian scheme of the unfolding of the divine world, nonetheless he accepts and rejects different elements in Sethian Gnosticism. He accepts the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44Kevin Corriganis also, and perhaps primarily in certain places, thinking of Sethian texts,and I hope to be able to support this thesis from my own amateur readingof those texts in the Nag Hammadi library.Plotinus himself gives us a small key to understanding the whole workat the end of 2.9 [33]. “Even if the Gnostics say that they alone can con-template, that does not make them any more contemplative,” he says invirtually the closing paragraph of the work (2.9 [33].18.35–36). In his view,the gnostics claim contemplation as their own in their private revelations,Allogenes’notion of learned ignorance (Enn.3.8 [30].9–10; NHC XI 59,30–32; 60,8–12; 61,2–3; 61,17–19; cf. Porphyry Sent.25–26 Lambertz; Parmenides com-mentary, frgs. 2, 4), the notion that spiritual beings are simultaneously present intheir entirety as “all together” in the Intellect (Enn.5.8.7–9; NHC VIII 21; 87;115–16), and the idea of the traversal of Life from the One into the Intellect (Enn.3.8 [30].11; NHC XI 49,5–21). On the other hand, Plotinus rejects (1) the strong par-titioning of the Intellect (Enn.2.9 [33], cf. 3.9), (2) the idea that Sophiais deriva-tive and alien (Zost.VIII 9,6–11,9; cf. Enn.5.8 [31].5) or that Soul or Sophiadeclinedand put on human bodies or that Sophiaillumined the darkness, producing animage in matter, which in turn produces an image of the image, (3) the idea of ademiurge revolting from its matter and whose activity gives rise to “repentances,”“copies” (ajntivtupoi, i.e., the demiurge’s counterfeit aeons) and “transmigrations”(Enn.2.9 [33].6; the “alien earth,” 2.9 [33].11; cf. Zost.VIII 5,10–29; 8,9–16; 12,4–21),(4) the unnecessary multiplication of hypostases, (5) the conception of a second-ary knowledge that is the knowledge of yet a higher knowledge (Enn.2.9 [33].1;cf. Zost.VIII 82,1–13), and (6) their magical incantations (Enn.2.9 [33].4; cf. VIII,52; 85–88; 127; XI 53,32–55,11; VII 126,1–17; X 25,17–32,5). Turner concludes thatPlotinus’s encounter with the gnostics may have caused him to tighten up his owninterpretation of Plato’s Timaeus(esp. 39e) and even provided “sources of doctrine,insofar as these treatises built their systems upon those of previous Platonists andNeopythagoreans” (457). Turner stresses the importance of the Allogenes’contri-bution of the triads Being-Life-Mind and Existence-Vitality-Mentality to the devel-opment of the Middle Platonic exegesis of Tim.39e and Soph.248c–e on therelation and mutual inclusion of intelligence and life. “Sources of doctrine” may begoing too far, though Turner’s precise qualification of this is important and attrac-tive. I am, therefore, very much in sympathy with Turner’s views. My own argu-ment here (certainly compatible with Turner) is that the first three treatises of theGroßschriftprepare for, and contextualize the critique (2.9). Thus, even where Plot-inus rejects certain ideas, he does so already in a philosophical context in whichhis “opponents” might well agree with him. For example, the strong partitioning ofIntellect and the reduplication of knowledge are already “prefigured” in the dou-bleness of intellect argument of 3.8.11 (even in elements of a shared philosophicallanguage): e[fesi\" ga;r kai; ejn touvtw/ kai; suvnneusi\" pro;\" to; ei\\do\" aujtou'. Again, thecriticism of the “image of an image” (2.9.10–11) has its earlier philosophical echoat 3.8.2.22–34.

Furthermore, unlike the action ofan ignorant, fallen Sophia (cf. 2.9 [33].8.36–39; cf. 43–46; 1.19–33), whichmakes piece-meal, all artistic and natural objects contain within themselvesthe seeds of their own whole-formed making according to a physicalsofiva(5.8 [31].5.1–8), and this has to be traced back internally to Nousso thatone can appreciate the beauty of both worlds, and especially the intelligi-ble beautyof the aesthetic star-gods (cf. 5.8 [31].3.20–36), which the gnos-tics, in Plotinus’s view, disparage (2.9 [33].16.1–2). Thus, finally in 5.5 [32]Plotinus explores what it means to locate nature, soul, and nous“within”the truth (5.5 [32].1.32–36, 59–67; 2.1–20; 3.1–2, 16–24, esp. “the king theredoes not rule over aliens,but has the most just, naturalpower and truekingdom, since he is king of truthand the naturallord of his gathered[ajqrovo\", i.e., nonscattered] product”).79External revelation and alienationfrom divinity are, in fact, for Plotinus, far from the natural, inner presenceof the Good, which is themost familiar, themost natural and fundamentalpresence in us:One must perceive each thing by the appropriate organ....And we mustconsider that men have forgotten that which from the beginning until nowthey want and long for. For all things reach out to that and long for it bynecessity of nature [fuvsew\" ajnvagkh/] as if divining by instinct [ajpomeman-teumevna] that they cannot exist without it. The grasp of the beautiful andthe wonder and the waking of love for it come to those who, in a way,already know it and are awake to it. But the Good, since it was there longbefore to arouse an innate [suvmfuton] desire, is present even to thoseasleep and does not astonish those who at any time see it, because it isalways there . . . but people do not see it, because it is present to them intheir sleep. (5.5 [32].12.5–14)Thus, even cosmic slumber is already pervaded by the presence of thedivine, “unknowable” one, and we are given a reasonwhy He is unknownin terms of the unconscious or preconscious.

Therefore, I propose that Plotinusdevelops a theory of natural wisdom and contemplation, shows how theseare to be traced to the beauty and inner unity of Intellect, and finally groundsthem in the natural, familiar presence of the Good. He does this clearly incontrast to elements in gnostic thought,80but also as an implicit and indirectdialogue with gnostics on matters with which they might well agree. Afterall, not all of them are solipsistic innovators (2.9 [33].6.10–12)! The abilityeven of the “innovators” to recognize the truth even in the investigation oftheir own doctrines is what Plotinus insists on when he attacks them directly:“For their ‘illumination of the darkness,’ if it is investigated,” he states at 2.9[33].12.30–32, “will make them admit the true causes of the universe.”But how does Plotinus go about his task? I want to take one exampleof this and then point out some hidden parallels with Sethian Gnosticism.As in the case of matter, so in that of nature and contemplation Plotinusstarts with a reflection on Aristotle: if the final goal of all human desire iscontemplation, as Aristotle indicates in the Ethics,and if this includes irra-tional animals, the power of growth in plants, and the earth itself, as Aris-totle reports that Eudoxus thought (Eth. nic.1072b10), and as Aristotlehimself might hold, if the Good is final cause of allmotion, how are weto conceive of this internal productive contemplation at all levels of theuniverse? Plotinus goes on to argue that the formal-final cause complex inany organism is not only a part of its substance, but internally productiveof that substance.81Nature is a lovgo\", he states, “which makes anotherlogos, its own product, which gives something to the substrate, but staysunmoved itself.” The lovgo\"that is viewed in relation to the visible shapeis “last, and a corpse, and no longer able to make another, but that whichhas life is the brother of that which makes the shape, and has the samepower itself and makes in that which comes to be” (3.8 [30].2.28–34). SoPlotinus distinguishes between the shape, the lovgo\"or ei\\do\"proper (whatwe might call the substantial form, in later terminology), and finally Natureherself, which cannot simply be identical with the productive lovgo\"of aparticular nature. On recognizable Aristotelian grounds (the unifiedejnevrgeiaof agent and product, and the principle that motion takes placein the thing moved),82Plotinus can thus conclude that what comes to be46Kevin Corrigan80Apart from the comparisons discussed above in note 76, Plotinus’s attempt toengage in the philosophical interpretation of myth (see especially 5.8 [31].12–13;5.5 [32].3) is significant for its evident subtext. Myth is common ground for Platon-ists, Platonist gnostics, and innovators. Lack of space here precludes any furtherdevelopment of this either in the Großschriftor in the rest of the Enneads.81For a different development of this notion, see the later treatise, thirty-eight inthe chronological order, 6.7 [38].1–3.82Phys.3.3; Metaph.1050a23–b2."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"is made both by an external cause and by its own internal finality, whichis embodied insight or contemplation.83Therefore, if the lovgo\"is contem-plation in the sense of already possessing and being what it is and,thereby, making simply by being itself, then making, being, and contem-plation are coextensive,84and everything, it follows, will be either con-templation or a product of contemplation.85In his fine essay on this treatise, John Deck has argued that Plotinusalters Aristotle’s doctrine drastically by extending contemplation to bruteanimals and by contradicting Aristotle’s explicit statement that contempla-tion is not productive (Eth. nic.1178b20–21).86Plotinus develops, in Deck’sview, a curious kind of causality, not formal or final, but a “real efficientcausality” (Deck, 107–9). I think Deck is wrong. True it is that Plotinus iswell aware of the seeming paradoxical nature of the thesis he advances,87but poivhsi\"and pra'xi\"still remain distinct from qewrivaeven if a new con-text transforms our view of them.88I suggest instead that Plotinus is con-sciously developing a line of thought implicit and even important inAristotle, but one that Aristotle did not himself develop. If the divine life ofcontemplation is the goal of all natural organisms, then how this finalityactually operates in all of nature becomes a problem. Besides, contempla-tion is conspicuously productive for Aristotle. The productive nou'\"of Dean.3.5 must be a contemplative power, and sofiva, in Eth. nic.7, whosefunction is essentially and comprehensively contemplative, is said to makein an internal way (1144a1–6). Whether this “making” is a form of efficientor formal-final causality is the subject of contemporary debate.89I proposethat Plotinus adopts and develops the latter alternative and indicates that heis developing Aristotle’s own thought by citing Aristotle at major stages ofhis conclusion. 3.8 [30].7.15–18 is just such a stage: “it was necessary, sincethe first principles were engaged in contemplation, for all other things toaspire to this state, granted that their originative principle is, for all things,Positive and Negative Matter4783From a different viewpoint, this is also the goal of the argument in 6.7[38].1–13.843.8 [30].3.14–23.853.8 [30].7.1–15.86John Deck, Nature, Contemplation, and the One(Toronto: University ofToronto Press, 1967), 107.87See, for example, 3.8 [30].1.88So in 5.8 [31].1–6 the Aristotelian triad, making-doing-seeing, is retained (asalso in a different way in 3.8 [30].1–4: making in different senses; 6–8: doing as aprelude to seeing; 7–9: seeing).89For a full discussion see R.

However, the major drift of Plotinus’s interpretation and developmentof Aristotelian qewrivais clear. The sensible world is unfolded from withinnou'\". Thus, one can explain why things are so, but one should not supposethat things are so because of the reason one gives, Plotinus argues later in5.8 [31].7. Nou'\"is like the conclusion before the syllogism (36–41), beforepurposive thought (epivnoia, 41–43). As in Aristotle implicitly (cf. Phys.2.8),so in Plotinus in a much more developed form, finality is an external prin-ciple in and beyond the cosmos, but it is also included in the form of phys-ical things in a way that is not mere conceptual transference oranthropomorphic mind-projection (this Plotinus spends a lot of time argu-ing against) or again vague spiritual strivings in nature (Plotinus devotes 3.8[30]; 5.8 [31]; 5.5 [32]; 6.7 [38] and a part of 6.8 [39] to dispelling this view).92Thus, in 5.8.7 Plotinus is again thinking of Aristotle’s doctrine of the unityof “reason” and “fact” in intelligible perception (cf. An. post.2.19 and 5.8[31].7.36–44; Phys.188a27–30 and 5.8 [31].7.45) when he concludes that“what is ajrchvand tevlo\"is the whole altogether and without deficiency”(5.8 [31].7.47). And, of course, this goes right to the heart of his critique ofthe gnostics, for they want to ask “why Soul made the world” or “why thereis a soul” or “why the maker makes” (2.9 [33].8.1–2) and then explain thisin anthropomorphic terms either in terms of change or some kind of dis-cursive thought (2.9 [33].8.2ff.).I, therefore, propose that if we superimpose these two pictures of theGroßschrift,one gnostic and one Aristotelian (not to mention the muchmore evident Platonic dimension), we uncover precisely the form of aninner, implicit dialogue within a hidden dialogue as a kind of pervasivesubtext to the free, creative line of argumentation that plays out, so tospeak, the major melody.

Take, for example, the following pas-sage from 5.8 [31].5, where Plotinus traces all(the emphatic first word ofthe chapter) products of art or nature back to the wisdom of Intellect: “thecraftsman goes back to the physical wisdom [sofivan fusikhvn] according towhich he has come into existence, a wisdom which is no longer composedof theorems, but is one thing as a whole [o{lhn e{n ti], not the wisdom madeinto one out of many components, but rather resolved into multiplicityfrom one” (4–8). Why should Plotinus write fusikhnv? Well, for Aristotle,sofivais the ajrethvof tevcnh(Eth. nic.6.7),93and yet at the same time it isnot piece-meal wisdom or a wisdom parcelled up into various species-interests.94Rather, it presides over the whole of reality and provides for thecoming-to-be of practical wisdom and skill.95Plotinus, in the above pas-sage, implicitly emphasizes that this recognizably traditional view concernsphysicalwisdom (not manipulative or artificial thinking), evidently with thepurpose of excluding anyfallen, demiurgic Sophiawho seeks to contractor reconstruct the world in a discursive manner. For the world is made,Plotinus states, “in every way after the manner of nature [fusikwvteron...pavntw\"], rather than as the arts make; for the arts are later than nature andthe world” (2.9 [33].12.17–18). If everything that comes to be is guided bythis physical sophia,then there is no need for an ignorant, fallen Sophia.At the same time, Plotinus’s theory of contemplation and the unconscioustakes the problem of ignorance very seriously, but shows that the appar-ent gnostic view can be given a much more subtle interpretation thangnostic mythologists or at least than that segment of “innovative solipsists”give it.This positive appeal to the wider group of gnostics is, in my view, rein-forced by Plotinus’s use of important images or ideas that are clearlyshared by the gnostics. The visionary description of the “true earth” and“true heaven” in 5.8 [31].3–4, while of course deriving from Phaed.109dff.and Phaedr.247ff., is conspicuously parallel to Zost.VIII 48–55. Even morenoteworthy is the famous image of the One as a spring in which all rivershave their source or as the life of a great plant, giving and yet self-stand-ing (3.8 [30].10). To be sure, this is common enough. Similar images arefound in Macrobius and the Corpus hermeticum.96Is it merely accidental,however, that the Tripartite Tractatehas both images? “The Father broughtPositive and Negative Matter4993Eth. nic.1141a12.94Cf.

In both passages, the emergence of multiplicityfrom the One is under discussion, and the intimate relation between prod-uct and Source, which permits the product to know the Source but whichleaves the Source “undivided” (3.8 [30].10.17–19) or “incomparable” (Tri.Trac.63,15–16), is developed at some length (Tri. Trac.60–64; 3.8[30].10.12–35). Or again, is it accidental that Plotinus constantly uses theanalogy of perception for understanding the nature of intellection both initself and in relation to the One? This tends to ground the analysis in ashared “objective correlate” rather than a private apocalypse but at thesame time would be readily comprehensible to readers of the Sethian texts,with their emphasis on light and vision. Indeed, a passage in 5.5 [32].7 thatI have always found a little puzzling comes into a new focus because ofthis comparison with Sethian texts. After a prolonged analysis of percep-tion, in which Plotinus effectively distinguishes four cognate moments oflight,97Plotinus concludes:“Just so Intellect, veiling itself from other things [ajpo; tw'n a[llwn kaluvya\"]and drawing itself inward, when it is not looking at anything will see alight, not a distinct light in something different from itself, but alone byitself in independent purity [aujto; kaq! eJauto] suddenly appearing [ejxaivfnh\" fanevn], so that Intellect is at a loss to know whence it appeared,from outside or within....” (31–34)I had thought that ejxaivfnh\" fanevnwas a distant echo of the daughters of thesun pulling back the veils (kaluvptra\") from their faces in Parmenides’Proem(Diels-Krantz frg. 1.10; cf. Plato Symp.210e4; cf. 212c6, 213c). How-ever, I now cannot help thinking that Plotinus includes within his empiricallybased image an indirect reference to the gnostic triad Autogenes-Proto-phanes-Kalyptos, just as he unites being-having-seeing in one unifieddescription of Intellect in dialogue with Numenius or Amelius.98Thus, Intel-lect’s vision is no longer that of Allogenes (“one thing in another”) but ratherthat of Kalyptos (veiling itself from others), a seeing of Autogenes (“itself initself alone, pure”) as Protophanes (i.e., self-generated and first appearing:ejx! auJtou'... fanevn). Instead of a triad of distinct personified hypostases,there is one unified description of a dynamic multiplicity. This may seem50Kevin Corrigan97Cf. the four aeons or lights of Zost.126–28; Gos.

It is itself “also an ultimate form; sothis universe is all form, and all the things in it are forms” (22–23). Thismay sound inconsistent, but Plotinus’s positive-negative view developedfrom Aristotle permits him to speak of matter in this sense as a kind of“proximate” or “ultimate” form.99Perhaps even more remarkable is thethought-experiment Plotinus devises two chapters later (after reprovingthose who censure the visible world, 8.22–23):Let us then take in our thought [diavnoia] this universe, each of its partsremaining what it is without confusion, gathering all of them together intoone as far as we can, so that when any one part appears first, for instance,the outside heavenly sphere, the imagination of the sun and, with it, theother heavenly bodies follows immediately, and the earth and sea and allthe living creatures are seen, as they could all be seen . . . inside a trans-parent sphere. Let there be, then, in the soul a shining imagination of asphere, having everything within it.... Keep this, and apprehend in your-self another, taking away the mass: take away also the places, and themental picture of matter in you, and do not try to apprehend anothersphere smaller in mass . . . but calling on the god who made that of whichyou have a mental picture, pray him to come. And may he come, bring-ing his own universe with him....(5.8 [31].9.1–15)Since Plotinus mentions this sphere again at the end of 2.9 (ch. 17.4–19), Itake this to be the proposal of a direct contrast to the gnostic private revela-tion that comes directly from above and that ignores or despises the cosmos.Instead of the many spheres of Valentinian cosmology, for instance, and thesubsequent separation from God, Plotinus presents the single sphere of tra-ditional Greek cosmology as the immediate phenomenological space of indi-vidual consciousness.100Nothing is bracketed, but everything has to beincluded in consciousness: a unifying grasp of perception, discursive reason,appearance, imagination, and apperception. In Zostrianosthere is an ambigu-ous but analogous insistence upon “going through everything,” a phrase thatPositive and Negative Matter5199Metaph.1045b18: hJ ejscavth u{lh kai; hJ morfh; taujtov.100Cf. the spherical shape of soul in Marsanespp. 25–26."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"is repeated at least three times.101At the same time 5.8 [31].9 echoes certainelements in the Sethian texts and transposes them into an empirically basedmodel: for example, seeking the Father of all in thought and perception (Zost.2,13; 44,2–3), the use of productive imagination (10,10–14), or thought insilence (24,10–17), or “in accordance with the pattern that indwells you,know likewise [that] it is in this way in [all such matters] after this very pat-tern” (Allogenes59,37–60,2), or especially prayer (Zost.63; Tri. Trac.66),102which neatly indicates in terms clearly acceptable to the Sethian gnostics thatascent, understanding, or production is not one’s own private doing, but ashared endeavor in which one’s own activity calls forth to a cognate but supe-rior power. However, Plotinus does not tell us to take away the matter, onlythe “phantom of matter in you.” Can it be that matter itself here is genuinelypart of form, even part of the intelligible? Plotinus, of course, cannot acceptgnostic ajpokatavstasi\"or even the view that finally “the entire defilement”will be saved (Marsanes5,15), but he is surely sympathetic with the world-affirming side of the Sethian texts: “<I have come to know> when <I> wasdeliberating that in every respect the sense-perceptible world is [worthy] ofbeing saved entirely” (Marsanes5,24–26). Thus far, all this seems compatiblewith Plotinus’s view of the generation of matter and matter’s positive functionin genesis.But without the gnostics, would we really have been able to seethis side of Plotinus’s thought so clearly in the Enneads?At any rate, this pos-itive view is generally characteristic of subsequent treatises in the chronolog-ical order from 34 up to 50.103Plotinus’s critique of the gnostics might wellhave helped to make possible, for all I know, one of the strangest statementsin the whole of the Enneadsin 6.2 [43].21, to the effect that since bodies arein the intelligible, matter and qualities must be there too (52–53). What weare to make of this I am not entirely sure. In the light of the criticism of Aris-totelian-Peripatetic philosophy that comes both before and after this treatise,however, 6.2 [43] is concerned to demonstrate how a Platonic intelligible view of reality is more capable of explaining the rich, teeming, even sensual 52Kevin Corrigan101Zost.4,26–6,2; 44,5–22.102For the importance of prayer in connection with the Three Steles of Seth,seethe assessment of Hans-Martin Schenke, “The Phenomenon and Significance ofGnostic Sethianism” (note 6), 602: “In short I cannot help seeing the Three Steles—as a typical liturgical text. And the passage 127:6–21 . . . is something like a rubric,in which it is expressed how the three prayer formulas are to be used and whatresults from performance of the ritual. Our text does not represent the pure for-mula, as it were, but has been stylized and framed as an etiology of the ritual.”103Of the treatises in this chronological section, 3.5 [50] requires proper, sepa-rate attention, which it is not possible to give it here.

The latter view, I believe, is less characteristic of Aristotlethan of the subsequent history of interpretation.104All in all, however, theinterpretation of the “living creature” of the Timaeusthat Plotinus offers inchapter 21 of 6.2 [43] is not dissimilar from Neopythagorean, Chaldean, orgnostic views of the unfolding of intelligible reality down to the ultimate sed-iment that is, in this perspective, a pretty desiccated “physical universe”(because the soul has been for whatever reasons subtracted from it).105Given this general assessment, however, it is most probable that Plot-inus develops his final analysis of the negative pathology of matter in con-tinuing opposition to gnostics (among others) and even as a response tognostic-related demands to create a coherent philosophical theory of theactionof evil (on the basis of the “ancient philosophy”) to replace theirown more immediately plausible mythology of aggressive, demonic forces.In 1.8 [51], in particular, Plotinus clearly responds to the gnostic challengeof a fault, split, or “affection” in the spiritual world and argues that even ifone grants some affection (which he does) of soul, his philosophical the-ory of matter-evil can still account for generation and, subsequently, for theemergence of evil in the world.5. ConclusionThe results of this investigation, then, might be stated as follows. Apositive-negative matter theory is characteristic of many schools andthinkers before Plotinus. What distinguishes Plotinus is the distinctive lineof thinking he creates within the context of ancient Platonic philosophy. Inmuch of Plotinus’s thinking about the sensible world, but particularly in hisworks on matter, there is a hidden conversation with Aristotelian philoso-phy, whose object appears not to be procrustean reconciliation so muchas the development of an inner dialogue in which latent possibilities in“the ancient philosophy” and in the subject of investigation itself can bescrutinized in a relatively open fashion. If this “dialogue within a dialogue”form is in the tradition of the “School of Gaius” and of Ammonius Saccas,then our analysis here will help to show that Plotinus’s implicit readerswere much more sophisticated than we have commonly supposed.On the question of matter, I have argued that Plotinus’s positive-negative analysis in 2.4 [12] is a Platonic development of latent-elements inPositive and Negative Matter53104To demonstrate this would require a separate treatment. For a similar view,however, see S. Strange, “Plotinus’ Treatise ‘On the Genera of Being,’” Ph.D. diss.,University of Texas at Austin, 1981.105Cf. 6.3 [44].1.19–31."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Aristotle by means of an inner dialogue with Aristotelian philosophy. Mostof the features of Plotinus’s later works are already there in nuce,but cer-tainly not in developed form. This reciprocal positive-negative view of mat-ter accounts for matter’s “participation” in form, to the degree it is formed,and also for the thoroughly positive treatment of matter in the Großschrift(treatises 30–33) and most of the works of Plotinus’s middle period, whileit also accounts for the negative view developed further in 3.6 [26] and 1.8[51]. This simultaneous positive-negative view according to different per-spectives provides a context for understanding lower matter’s generationby the partial soul and its implicit appearance as a consequence of primalOtherness in 2.4 [12].5 and its “banishment” in 2.5 [25].5. And if the dark-ness of the Intelligible is to be related to the infinite formlessness in Nousthat springs immediately from the formlessness of the One’s unrestrictedBeauty as beauty-making power, then the later Proclan doctrine of the“dark other” or Intelligible infinite is presaged here in Plotinus.In many of the passages relating to the generation of matter one alsobegins to uncover a critical, indirect dialogue with the gnostics or at leastwith those friends of the Plotinian circle influenced by Gnosticism. Ploti-nus’s elaboration of alternative possibilities in 4.8 [6] and 2.9 [33] (matter’sultimate abandonment or its consequential connectedness with being) andhis gnostic description of the “exile” of matter in 2.5 [25] are evidence of asubtextual critical reflection upon gnostic thought and even an implicit,indirect dialogue. The most conspicuous example of such a subtextual cur-rent is in the late work 1.8 [51], where a comparison with Zostrianoshelpsus to realize the extent and importance of this dialogue. Clearly Plotinushas developed his own thinking in order to show how the intelligible“affection” of soul is susceptible of philosophical explanation without mak-ing intelligible reality the cause of evil. At the same time, I proposed thatPlotinus develops a subtle pathology of evil (again in subtextual dialoguewith Aristotle and Alexander of Aphrodisias) as a direct philosophicalresponse to an evident gnostic-type problem, namely, how an indetermi-nate indefiniteness can “do” anything or have any effects whatsoever. Herewe come closest to uncovering a dialogue with the gnostics, within a dia-logue with Aristotle, in the subtext of the work itself. I believe that this isof fundamental importance for understanding the place of the explicit cri-tique of the gnostics within the Großschrift,for if I am right in this, then theimplicit gnostic-influenced interlocutors capable of understanding whatPlotinus is talking about (and clearly to be distinguished from mere “inno-vative solipsists”) are highly sophisticated thinkers who must have formedpart of the collegial circle of Plotinus’s house in Rome.In my treatment of the Großschrift,therefore, I have emphasized thatthe first three treatises—3.8 [30]; 5.8 [31]; and 5.5 [32]—establish a philo-sophical conversation with the gnostics, a conversation that we have seen54Kevin Corrigan"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"here to be characteristic of Plotinus’s method, a method that is ultimatelyinclusive just like his Intelligible Universe. This conversation is the frame-work for understanding the force of the explicit critique in 2.9 [33], and Ihave pointed out several comparisons with Sethian texts that serve to illus-trate the positive, philosophical meeting ground that Plotinus may well beseeking to establish as the real basis for dialogue. I have argued in partic-ular that the whole development of thought in the three earlier treatisesoccurs in the context of this gnostic project. If we ask ourselves what “doc-trine” might mean for Plotinus, I think we have to answer that “doctrines”are not fixed epitomes of developed Platonic, Aristotelian, or Stoic insightsbut rather lines of thinking which take on their own organic form andreveal the many layers of their inception and development in the treatisesof the Enneads.If this is so (even if it is only part of the truth), then gnos-tic thought (and particularly Sethian Gnosticism) is a genuine motive forcefor the critical development of Plotinus’s own thinking, since clearly it is atleast in part because of the gnostics that Plotinus is compelled to rethink,not only the interpretation of Plato’s Timaeus,but also the central questionof what divine creativity or creative making in general really is. Again trueto “the ancient philosophy,” he does this partly by means of an inner dia-logue with Aristotle (and, of course, always Plato). Nonetheless, the gnos-tics, and Sethian gnostics, in particular, are at least implicit interlocutors inthe development of one of the most distinctive lines of thinking in theEnneads,namely, the doctrine of internal, contemplative making, whichPlotinus returns to over and over again in some of his greatest works. Forexample, the first chapter of the next treatise after the Großschrift,6.6[34].1, “On Numbers,” might well begin with “a traditional Neo-Pythagorean view of evil,” but the treatise’s principal concern to provide“a more positive evaluation of multiplicity and number”106is very defi-nitely related to the gnostic-project of the Großschrift.Even more con-spicuous is Plotinus’s major development of the thought of the Großschriftin 6.7 [38] and 6.8 [39]. I suggest that these two works are written directlyas a response to colleagues and opponents (gnostic and others) whowanted to know after reading the Großschrift,first, how Plato’s languagein the Timaeuscould properly be reconciled with Plotinus’s doctrine ofinternal productive making107and, second, how Plotinus’s One could inPositive and Negative Matter55106A.

Finally, after discussing Iamblichus’s rationale for a Platonic theurgy, I will consider hissoteriology in contrast to Plotinian and gnostic views of the soul’s salvation.1. The Platonic BackgroundThe evidence of Plato’s dialogues suggests that the “ignorance” ofSocrates was the result of a profound moral and intellectual effort and thathis aporiawas—as Socrates himself says—a state of mind available to allhuman beings, but only reluctantly accepted. The simplicity of it, realizingthat one’s wisdom is entirely worthless, remains as terrifying for us todayas it was in the fifth century B.C.E., and because it terrifies us we tend todiminish its importance or think that it applies to everyone but ourselves.Socrates is Plato’s example of the soul no longer beguiled by fantasies ofsecurity or self-importance. He is the soul cleansed of self-deception, andthroughout the first, or “cathartic,” dialogues in the curriculum of the laterPlatonists: the Alcibiades I,the Gorgias,and the Phaedo,Socrates’ probingquestions cause his interlocutors, and Plato’s readers, to recognize theirown self-deceptions and experience the shock of aporia.258Gregory Shaw2Westerink, who discussed the curriculum of the later Platonists based on theanonymous Prolegomena26, writes: “After the (introductory) Alcibiades,the Gor-giasdeals with the civic virtues, then the Phaedowith the purificatory virtues, fol-lowed by seven others which contain, in systematic arrangement, the subject-matterfor speculation (contemplative virtues): Cratylusand Theaetetus(epistemology),"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"As exemplified in Socrates, rational thinking for Plato has a purelycathartic function. Its purpose was to prune away deceptions, not to affirmor discover what is of the greatest importance for the soul. For the highestand most valuable subjects Plato says there can be no rational discourse,and in the Seventh Letter(341c–d) he writes:I certainly have composed no work in regard to it, nor shall I ever do soin the future, for there is no way of putting it in words like other studies.Acquaintance with it must come rather after a long period of attendanceon instruction in the subject itself when, suddenly, like a blaze kindled bya leaping spark, it is generated in the soul and at once becomes self-sustaining.After pointing out the inadequacies of the rational method to describe thesubject to which he is most devoted, Plato portrays the soul’s experienceof it with a poetic image: “suddenly . . . a blaze kindled by a leapingspark”; it is an evocation, not an explanation. Plato’s evocative use ofmyths and images, seen, for example, in the Phaedrusand the Timaeus,were studied later in the Platonic curriculum and were the necessary com-plement to Socrates’ cathartic cross-examinations prominent in the earlydialogues. Cleansing, then awakening, was the way of Platonic paideia,and while a well-exercised skill in rational analysis was necessary to stripthe soul of false beliefs, it could never awaken it to its innate dignity. Forthis, something more fundamental was needed, and again Plato hasSocrates show the way.Despite his profession of ignorance on virtually all matters, there wasone thing, the only thing, that Socrates claimed to understand: ta erotika,the mysteries of love and desire.3In the Symposiumand the PhaedrusPlatolays out the fundamental importance of erosfor the soul in reestablishingits contact with the divine. Eroswas a more than human force, a divinemagnetism that pulsed through the cosmos, and to the degree that humansouls were carried by its higher currents, they experienced a heavenly rap-ture that was superior to all forms of knowledge and human wisdom.4ForPlato, eroswas more fundamental than reason, and even in the most“rational” of souls, erossecretly determined the goal and direction of itsTheurgy in Later Platonism59Sophistand Statesman(physical world), Phaedrusand Symposium(theology),with the Philebus(on the Good) as the end of the series.” This was followed bythe perfect dialogues: the Timaeusand the Parmenides.See L.

Anterior to rational reflection, erosslowly awakens in the human form, and when guided up the ladder ofbeauties described in the Symposium(241b–c), it reaches Absolute Beautywhere the soul is fulfilled and rides again in the heavens with the gods.6Plato warns his readers that such images cannot be taken as truedescriptions of the soul’s destiny, for such matters fall outside the certaintyand artifice that the abstract sciences allow. The origins of the universe andthe nature of the soul are matters that “only a god could tell,”7and Platoadmits that his myths are but “likely stories” passed on by the wise.8Insum, I would characterize Plato’s myth of the soul as follows: Createdimmortal and imbued with the generosity and creativity of its Maker, thehuman soul is coordinated perfectly with all the divinities and powers ofthe cosmos. In the trauma of human birth, however, the soul loses itsinnate coordination and becomes estranged from its original and divinenature. In the words of the Phaedrus,the soul “loses its wings” and iden-tifies with its mortal body. Yet, through paideiathe soul can reorient itself,see through its false identity, and regain the harmony that it lost at birth.Prior to paideia,the human soul is estranged both from itself and from thecosmos. Its thinking moves counter to divine thought, as Plato puts it, likea man walking backwards and turned upside down.9This is why paideiamust arrest the soul’s thinking with the shock of aporia.Only then can itbegin to reorient itself to the thoughts and movement of the divine. In this,the visible cosmos plays an essential role, as Plato says:And the motions which are naturally akin to the divine principle in us arethe thoughts and revolutions of the universe; these each man should fol-low, and by learning the harmonies and revolutions of the universeshould correct the courses of the head which were corrupted at our birth,and should assimilate the thinking being to the thought.10The assimilation of the soul to the harmonies of the universe required intel-lectual disciplines to purify the soul’s erosfor its lost divinity.

Yet from their conscious aporia,such souls began to follow a moreancient way, revealed in the stars, the seasons, and the lives of pious soulswho preserved the myths of the wise.12The evocative imagery of Plato’s myths were not intended to informbut to awaken and guide the soul’s erosto its original nature. But whatthen? If Plato’s soteriology may be described poetically as an ascent to thegods, what follows was just as important. The divinized soul had to returnto mortality and fulfill the ancient pattern initiated by the Demiurge andportrayed suggestively throughout the dialogues. In the act of creation theDemiurge extends himself into the world in order to share his generosity.13The guardians who ascend from the cave imitate this benevolence byreturning to the darkness.14Eros,the agent of the soul’s deification, isdescribed as moving up and down between the gods and men.15AndSocrates, the exemplary soul and avatar of eros,is simultaneously attractedby, yet even more attractive to, his interlocutors.16While being constantlydrawn upward to divine beauty, Socrates communicates that same divinityto his listeners, and not as a man—who would credit himself for it—but assomething Alcibiades described as more than human.17Finally, the dialec-tic itself, after ascending to the first principle, is completed only when itdescends into the many without losing touch with the Forms.18In Platonicpaideiathe soul’s ascent to the gods was confirmed only when itdescended and communicated that divinity to the mortal world.Plato’s paideiaprovided a rich legacy for his students, and while itcontinued to stimulate and sustain philosophic communities, it neces-sarily left many questions unanswered. The driving force of paideiawasthe soul’s eros,not logos,so the metaphysical framework of Plato’sthought was left fluid, allowing it to be shaped to meet the needs ofTheurgy in Later Platonism6111Rep.516d.12Plato suggests that this was more an intuitive than an intellectual attainment;see, e.g., Phaedr.275b–c.13Tim.29e.14Rep.519d–520a15Symp.202e–203a.16Symp.216d–217a.17Symp.221c–222a.18Rep.511b–e."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"other generations. The “likely stories” that provided the imaginativeframework for eroswere left to be worked out by later Platonists in dif-ferent contexts. Yet the needs of the soul remained the same regardlessof changes in culture, and Platonic paideiacontinued to follow atwofold process: (1) to purify the soul with the shock of aporia,and (2)to nurture the soul’s erosfor the divine, which united it with the gen-erosity of the Demiurge.2. The Puzzle of PlotinusI am puzzled how I could, even now, descend, and how my soul hascome to be in the body.— PlotinusPerhaps no one in the history of Platonism better exemplifies the ful-fillment of paideiathan Plotinus, the designated founder of Neoplatonism.He recognized the soul’s aporiain our efforts to know the One andexplained how we paint the One in the colors of our personal experience.He says:we run round it [the One] outside, in a way, and want to explain ourown experiences [pavqh] of it, sometimes near it and sometimes fallingaway in our perplexities [ajporivai] about it. The ajporivaarises especiallybecause our awareness of that One is not by way of reasoned knowl-edge or of intellectual perception, as with other intelligible things, butby way of a presence superior to knowledge. (Enn.6.9.3.53–4.4 trans.Armstrong)This presence superior to knowledge was the Platonic eros,and Plotinusemployed Plato’s likely stories to convey the depths of his own eroticexperience of the One. Following the imagery of the Phaedrusand theSymposium,Plotinus said that the soul’s desire for the One was a morethan human force bestowed on the soul by the One (and Good) that putthe soul in a state of elevated passion. Describing this he says:Then the soul, receiving into itself an outflow from thence [the Good], ismoved and dances wildly and is all stung with longing and becomesdesire [e[rw\"]. (Enn.6.7.22.8–10)This god-given eros,Plotinus says, was implanted in souls “from the begin-ning,”19and he maintained that in its ascent to the One, the soul goes “out19Enn.6.7.31.18–19.62Gregory Shaw"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"of its mind,”20is lifted on the wings of eros“above knowing,” and returnsto the “giver of its love.”21Thanks to Porphyry we have a glimpse of how Plotinus communicatedthese experiences to others. In his seminars we see the image of a beatificsage. Porphyry writes:When he spoke, his intellect illuminated even his face. Of pleasing aspect,he was then even more beautiful to see. Sweating slightly, his gentlenessshowed as did his kindness while being questioned and his rigor.22In addition to holding seminars devoted to philosophic matters, Plotinuslived with others where he attended to the daily needs of orphaned boysand girls given to his care.23He was the exemplar of the Platonic sageunited to the Good while extending this beneficence to others. Yet, despitethe power of his reveries on the ascent to the One or the example in hisown life of the “return to the cave,” Plotinus’s doctrines on the soul and itsplace in the cosmos proved to be a stumbling block to later generations ofPlatonists. Iamblichus, in particular, who in most respects espoused a Plo-tinian Platonism, had significant differences with Plotinus’s teachings onthe soul as passed on to him by Porphyry.The philosophic challenge that Plotinus faced as regards the soul wasto account for the soul’s union with the One as well as to explain the soul’sidentity with the divine Nous.The former problem was solved poeticallyby following Plato’s notion of an a priori erosimplanted in the soul “fromthe beginning.” But the soul’s identity with the Nouswas a problem thatPlato did not need to address, for it was not part of his philosophic lan-guage. Plotinus inherited a Platonism that had already been shaped by thethinking and terminology of Aristotle. Most significantly, Plotinus inheritedAristotle’s two conceptions of intellect: metaphysically, a divine intellectthat was the first cause of the universe,24and psychologically, an activeintellect (nous poietikos) that either was or was not the property of thehuman soul.25Prior to Plotinus, Alexander of Aphrodisias had equated thetwo intellects and argued that the soul’s ordinarily passive intellect (nouspathetikos) was able to habituate itself to the active intellect and share inTheurgy in Later Platonism6320Enn.6.7.35.24.21Enn.6.7.22.19.22Life of Plotinus13; translation (modified) by Dominic J.

Or, more to the point, if the nouspoietikoswas always in activity and the soul, in its highest degree, wasidentical to it, how does it happen that the soul falls away from the activeintellect and into body-bound passivity? This is the question that Plotinusasked himself in his treatise on the Descent of the Soul.He says:Many times, awakened to myself away from the body . . . believing myselfthen especially to be part of the higher realm, in act as the best life, hav-ing become one with the divine and based in it advancing to that activ-ity, establishing myself above all intelligible beings, then going down fromthis position in the divine from Nous down to discursive reasoning, I ampuzzled how I could, even now, descend, and how my soul has come tobe in the body.29In an effort to resolve this question Plotinus reviews the evidence ofPlato’s dialogues—which he rightly describes as ambiguous—and thenformulated his own explanation for the soul’s descent into a body. It wasPlotinus’s answer and its consequences to which Iamblichus and the laterPlatonists objected.64Gregory Shaw26See Philip Merlan’s discussion, Monopsychism Mysticism Metaconsciousness(The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1963), 47–50; and F.

Plotinus wasaware of the eccentricity of this position from a Platonic point of view,and yet he writes:And, if one ought to dare to express one’s own view more clearly, con-tradicting the opinion of others, even our soul does not altogether comedown,but there is always something of it in the intelligible; but if the partwhich is in the world of sense-perception gets control, or rather if it isbrought under control and thrown into confusion [by the body], it pre-vents us from perceiving the things which the upper part of the soul con-templates. (Enn.4.8.8.1–6 Armstrong)According to Plotinus, the soul’s experience of the Nousdepended onwhether or not it could free itself from the “world of sense perception”; ifsuccessful, the soul-as-Nousrealized that it had never really “come down,”that it was never truly embodied.In a different context, however, discussing self-knowledge, Plotinusadmits that “the Nousis ours andnot ours,”31and he draws careful dis-tinctions between the soul and the Nousthat is present to it.32Yet Plotinuscontinued to assert the notion of an undescended soul, which he describedin evocative terms. Although souls are enticed into bodies by sensateimages, he says, “their heads are firmly set above in heaven,”33and in oneof his last writings, Plotinus described the soul’s descent as an illumination(ellampsis). He writes:If the inclination [to the body] is an illumination [e[llamyi\"] to what isbelow it is not a sin; what is illuminated is responsible, for if it did notexist the soul would have nowhere to illuminate. The soul is said to godown or decline in the sense that the thing which receives the light fromit lives with it.

This portrayal of the soul’s “descent” bears a strik-ing resemblance to Plotinus’s portrayal of the fall of Sophia, which he hadcondemned in his treatise Against the Gnostics.According to the gnostics,he says, the World Soul (i.e., Sophia)did not come down itself, did not decline, but only illuminated [ejllavmyai]the darkness and so an image from it came into existence in matter. (Enn.2.9.10.25–27)Plotinus had faulted the gnostics for attributing the personal drama andcharacteristics of the particular soul to the World Soul and thus confusingontological levels.34Yet his doctrine of the undescended soul seems tohave done the same but from the other direction. Rather than attributingpersonal characteristics to the World Soul, Plotinus gave universal qualitiesto the particular soul. In effect, both the gnostics and Plotinus treat the par-ticular soul and World Soul as functional equivalents. The undescendedsoul of Plotinus exhibits the same traits and is described with the samemetaphors as the gnostic Sophia.Is it possible that Plotinus’s doctrine of the undescended soul was influ-enced by the gnostics against whom he so vigorously argued? Was the dual-istic soteriology and acosmicism implied in this doctrine a reflection ofgnostic belief or perhaps the influence of dualist Middle Platonists such asNumenius? Was the doctrine of the undescended soul an aberration rightlycondemned by later Platonists? Before seeking supposed “influences” orsources for Plotinus’s doctrine, I think we first need to understand its func-tion. My view is that Plotinus’s attempts to communicate his mystical expe-riences in the philosophic language of Plato and Aristotle should not beread as explanations, but as evocations offered to his students. Within theconfines of Plotinus’ s seminars, his descriptions of the soul with its “headin heaven” and “illuminating” the body from above would have evoked inhis listeners an inkling of the transcendence that he had experienced. Hisbeautiful face, then even more beautiful to see, and voice, resonant with hissoul’s depth, carried his listeners into verbal images of transcendence. Ineffect, Plotinus’s explanations were erotic enchantments in the form ofphilosophic discourse, yet taken out of the context of his seminars his“explanations” were likely to have been misunderstood by a Porphyry, anIamblichus, or even by Plotinus himself. So, while Plotinus’s doctrine of theundescended soul was criticized for philosophic reasons by Iamblichus, wemust remember that it was the “doctrine” of an undescended soul that wascriticized and not the legitimacy of Plotinus’s experience.66Gregory Shaw34Enn.2.9.7.5–9."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"One problem of the undescended soul doctrine is that Socratic apo-riacomes into play only at the highest level—when the Nousapproachesthe One. It is then that the soul-as-Nousreaches an utter aporiaand mustbe carried by its god-given erosto the Good. Prior to that, however, sincethe soul has been encumbered only by the camouflage of embodiment, itis able to recover its divinely noetic status through its own efforts. Thiswould afford the human soul far more power than traditional Platonicpaideiahad given to it. While this difference may seen inconsequentialand merely reflect Plotinus’s use of Aristotle’s terminology, the resultswere significant as regards the Plotinian philosopher’s self-understandingand his view of the world. In this context, let us now turn to Iamblichusto examine his objections to this doctrine and to see how the introductionof theurgy to Platonic paideiawas consistent with his understanding ofthe soul and the cosmos.3. Iamblichean Paideia: Aporia to TheourgiaWhen compared to divine action, even the perfect soul is imperfect.— IamblichusIn his philosophic doxography, the De anima,35Iamblichus criticizesthe opinion of those who blur distinctions among the incorporeals. Hewrites:There are some who maintain that all parts of this incorporeal substanceare alike and one and the same, so that the whole exists in any part of it.They even place in the individual soul the Intelligible World, the Gods,the Daimons, the Good, and all Races superior to the soul....Accordingto this view, the soul, considering its entire essence is in no way differentfrom the Nous,the Gods, or the Superior Races. (Stobaeus Anth.1.365.7–21)Iamblichus says that Numenius clearly held this view, as did Plotinus—though not entirely—as well as Plotinus’s students: Porphyry, who some-times rejected and sometimes revered it, and Amelius, who leaned towardit.36Iamblichus here was implicitly criticizing Plotinus’s doctrine of theundescended soul, and in his Commentary on the Phaedrushe explicitlyrejects the notion that the soul’s highest element remains unfallen andunchanged. He writes:Theurgy in Later Platonism6735De anima,in Stobaeus Anthologium(ed. C. Wachsmuth and O. Hense; Berlin:Weidmanns, 1884–1912).36Stobaeus Anth.1.365.7–21."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"And if the charioteer is the highest element in us, and he, as is said in thePhaedrus,sometimes is carried aloft and raises “his head into the regionsoutside,” while at other times he descends and (fills his pair) with lame-ness and moulting, it plainly follows that the highest element in us expe-riences different states at different times.37According to Iamblichus, when the human soul enters a body it descendsentirely and does not leave its “head in heaven.” In the De animaIamblichus explained that the soul is generated from the Nousas a subor-dinate and separate level of reality,38and he defined the soul’s essence as[1] the mean between divisible and indivisible,corporeal and incorporeal beings;[2] the totality of the universal logoi;[3] that which, after the Forms, is at the serviceof the work of creation, or[4] that Life which has Life of itself, whichproceeds from the Nous,or[5] again, the procession of the classes of RealBeing as a whole to an inferior status.39For anyone who has studied the Timaeus,these definitions should soundfamiliar, a point that Iamblichus himself made with a polemical retort:“Indeed, he says, “Plato himself, Pythagoras, Aristotle and all of theAncients whose great names are praised for wisdom were absolutely con-vinced of these doctrines . . . as anyone would discover if he were to studytheir teachings with care!”40The Timaeussupports Iamblichus’s position. In the creation of humansouls, each is coordinated with all the numerical logoiof the World Souland, as soul, each functions as an intermediary between the irreconcilableextremes of same and different, indivisible and divisible, and immortal andmortal, which allows the intelligible world to appear as sensible (Tim.35a–36e). In the case of human souls, however, due to the dilution of theiressence, their mathematical logoiare broken apart and twisted when theyenter bodies (Tim.43d–e). Human souls suffer a discontinuity in theirmediation not experienced by the Superior Races. It was this dividednessand suffering that the doctrine of the undescended soul denied, yet todeny the divisible in favor of the indivisible was to deny to the soul its68Gregory Shaw37In Tim.frg. 87.28–32; in Iamblichi Chalcidensis (ed. with trans. and com-mentary by John Dillon; Leiden: Brill, 1973).38Stobaeus Anth.1.365.22–25.39Stobaeus Anth.1.365.25–366.5.40Stobaeus Anth.1.366.6–11."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"function as a mean between extremes. According to Iamblichus, all soulshad to mediate, and in the case of human souls their mediation includedthe experience of suffering, dividedness, and mortality. Since the soul’soriginal nature was immortal and coordinate with the gods it meant that—as human—the soul was alienated not only from the divinity of the godsbut from its own divinity as well. And this alienation was not an accidentor a temporary condition that could be rectified when the soul correctedthe “error” of identifying with the body: the experience of self-alienationconstituted the soul’s very essence as human.Yet the soul still contained the logoiof the World Soul, and by align-ing its own logoiwith the logoiof the visible world it could gradually trans-form its alienation. In order to regain its divinity the soul had to reshapeits human identity into the rhythms and ratios of the visible world, as Platoput it: “the motions which are naturally akin to the divine principle inus...” (Tim.90c). This was traditional paideia,and Plotinus himselfencouraged it in his treatise Against the Gnostics,41but an undescendedsoul would have required no knowledge of the cosmos except the real-ization that it had never really fallen into it. The doctrine of the unde-scended soul, in effect, short-circuited traditional Platonic paideiabecauseit no longer required the soul to realign itself with the cosmos. Theunfallen soul needed only to return to a Self that Porphyry claimed was“the same as the Nous.”42While this, admittedly, exaggerates the intent ofPlotinus’s position, such distortions were perhaps inevitable. It would bedifficult, for example, to imagine Socrates saying, with Porphyry, that “thephilosopher is the savior of himself,”43but not so difficult if Socratesbelieved that his “self” was a god. When Plotinus’s metaphor of the unde-scended soul was taken outside his seminars and was transformed into ametaphysical “doctrine,” it became an invitation for rationalistic hubris.This, in particular, is what Iamblichus sensed in Porphyry’s Platonism andin the questions posed in Porphyry’s Letter to Anebo.It was simply too easyfor the empirical self to misappropriate Plotinus’s images and assume thatone’s ascent to the gods did not require passage through the humiliationand darkness of Socratic aporia.Iamblichus’s understanding of the soulguaranteed that it did.Thanks to the careful analysis of Carlos Steel in The Changing Self,44we can now appreciate the complexity and originality of Iamblichus’s Theurgy in Later Platonism6941Enn.2.9.18.31–35.42Porphyry Abst.1.29.4; in Porphyre: De l’abstinence(text, translation, and intro-duction by J.

Iamblichus seems to havetaken Plato’s description of the embodied soul in the Timaeus—walkingbackward and turned upside down—and explained its limitations in Aris-totelian terms. Most notably, Iamblichus denied that the active intellect(nous poietikos) was the property of the soul. Iamblichus followed Aristo-tle’s more restrictive noetic terminology and believed that the Nousmustenter the soul from without (thurathen),45and in the De mysteriishe con-sistently maintained that the gods come to us from without (exothen),which was one rationale for performing rituals given by the gods.Iamblichus also employed the Aristotelian formula that essences (ousiai)are revealed by their activities (energeiai) and used it to identify the incor-poreal classes, including the human soul.46This formula led Iamblichus toa conclusion especially difficult for a Platonist: because the energeiaiofhuman souls are mortal and subject to change, so their ousiaimust some-how be mortal and subject to change!Steel cites Priscianus’s Commentary on the De Anima,where he refersto Iamblichus’s application of this formula. Priscianus writes:If, however, as Iamblichus thinks, a perverse and imperfect activity wouldnot proceed from an essence which is impassive and perfect, the soulwould be, even in its essence, somehow subject to passion. For in thisview, the soul is a mean, not only between the divided and undivided,the remaining and proceeding, the noetic and irrational, but also betweenthe ungenerated and generated....47Thus, that which is immortal in thesoul is filled completely with mortality and no longer remains immor-tal....48To think that part of “us” remains untouched by embodiment is, in Christ-ian terms, a docetic form of Platonism. Iamblichus was clearly more Chal-cedonian. Indeed, the paradox of the Chalcedonian Christ, being fully manand fully god, applies equally to the Iamblichean soul. As Priscianus70Gregory Shaw45Gen. an.236b.28.46The Aristotelian dictum that essences are known by their activities (De an.2.4.415a16–20) had precedents in the Platonic dialogues (Rep.477c; Soph.247e).47In de anima89.33–37 (Berlin: Reimeri, 1882). For attributing this commentaryto Priscianus rather than to Simplicius, see F. Bossier and C.

He says:According to Iamblichus, the individual soul embraces permanency andchange equally, so that in this way its intermediate position is again pre-served; for higher beings are stable, mortal ones are completely change-able. The individual soul, however, as middle, is undivided and multipliedtogether with mundane beings, and it does not only remain permanentbut also changes because it lives through so many divisible lives. And notonly in its habits, but also in its substance.49There was no part of the Iamblichean soul unaffected by embodiment asPlotinus and Porphyry had maintained.50Even Proclus, who otherwise fol-lowed Iamblichus’s teachings on the soul, could not accept that its highestpart, the ousia,was changed in embodiment.51Damascius, however, sup-ported Iamblichus’s view by referring to Plato’s definition of the soul asself-moved,52meaning, he says in his Parmenidescommentary, “that bothmoved and mover are the same being.”53“The soul,” Damascius contin-ues, “both changes itself and is always being changed, and thus it pos-sesses its being by always changing itself through the transformation of itsown essence.”54The soul endured such paradox because of its cosmogonic function asthe mean between extremes. The loss of the soul’s unity and stabilitycaused it to suffer, but this was the only way for the human soul to imitatethe Demiurge. To deny diversity and mortality to the soul would negate itsrole in cosmogenesis, yet because it was weakened by the dilution of itssubstance (Tim.41d–e), the soul performed its demiurgy through a kind ofself-alienation and shattering of its essence. In embodiment the soulbecame “other” to itself.55Thus Iamblichus:Theurgy in Later Platonism7149Translation (modified) by Steel, “Priscianus Lydus,” 57.50Enn.1.1.7.1–7.51Proclus Elem.

No matter how exalted or brilliant the human soul, as humanit was confined to a single form of consciousness58which made it “otherto itself” and cut off from the Nous.To recognize this was the first and per-haps most difficult task of Platonic paideia,particularly for the discursivelybrilliant. To accept with Socrates the “worthlessness of our wisdom” wouldmean remaining an “inferior companion” and accepting our existence as“lowest, deficient, and imperfect” compared to all other immortal beings(Myst.21.2). Iamblichus acknowledges our inferior status when he says:“. . . compared to divine activity, even the perfect soul is imperfect” (Myst.149.111–12).It is now almost commonplace to say that Iamblichus had a more pes-simistic view of the soul and its capacities than did Plotinus. I think thismisses the point. The deification of the soul was as important toIamblichus as it was to Plotinus, but its description by Porphyry—whoclaimed that Plotinus achieved it “four” times and himself “once”59—risked making a caricature of the soul’s henosisand deification. An enu-meration of henosismakes no sense. By definition, a henosisthat can beclaimed, numbered, or known cannot be a true henosis,and it was thisdiscursive counterfeit that Iamblichus attempted to overcome by distin-guishing the human activity of philosophy from the divineactivity of72Gregory Shaw56DA223.28–32. Yet, as a mean, the soul “could never become entirely self-alienated or it would cease to be soul” (DA241.10–11).57According to Plutarch, Isis and Osiris(nos. 53–54), Osiris represents the Pla-tonic Forms; Isis, the pure material receptacle; and Horus, the “perceptible imageof the intelligible world.” The embodied soul, born “crippled” like the elder Horus,seeks with Isis to recover the hidden parts of Osiris, dismembered and buried bythe titanic Seth/Typhon.58Myst.148.12–14.

Forwhen discursive language and terms such as “knowing,” “seeing,” or“grasping” are used to describe experiences that transcend all forms ofknowing, seeing, or grasping, then one must take care not to confuse thecontent of the discursive statement with its evocative power.61To do sowould reduce henosisto a discursive experience. For Porphyry to have“counted” henadic events suggests that he failed to make this distinctionand mistook Plotinus’s poetry for prose.Iamblichus was careful to avoid this confusion, and his psychologyhelped to buttress the distinction between the divine and human orders.For if the human soul does not merely seem to be embodied but truly is,and if its individual consciousness alienates it from divinity, then the soul—as human—cannot reach the divine of its own power. If it has contact withthe gods this must be initiated by the gods themselves, from outside thesoul. These restrictions need not reflect Iamblichus’s pessimism about thesoul or, as some would have it, his diminished capacity for mystical expe-rience, but rather his concern that transcendent experiences be receivedproperly and not confused with discursive fantasies. Iamblichus’s promo-tion of theurgy, therefore, may be seen as a consequence of his philo-sophic precision about the limits of the discursive mind, limits that Plotinusdid not always make explicit.62To oppose philosophy to theurgy or to seethem as alternate routes to salvation is to misunderstand the role of phi-losophy for Iamblichus.This misunderstanding is reflected in Porphyry’s Letter to Anebo,whereIamblichus’s former teacher presumes that theurgic rituals attempted tomanipulate the gods. Although Porphyry himself had once practiced theurgyfor the purpose of cleansing his “lower” soul, he felt that his “higher,” unde-scended soul could be reached only by philosophic contemplation.63ForTheurgy in Later Platonism7360J. Trouillard dismissed the portrayal of henosisas a “state” subject to enumer-ation. According to Trouillard, Porphyry was a “disciple souvent exotérique” whomisunderstood much of Plotinus’s more profound teachings (J. Trouillard, Lapurification plotinienne[Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1955], 98).61For example, when Iamblichus refers to the charioteer’s “vision” of the Formsin his journey with the gods, he explains that the term is a metaphor for the soul’sunion with the intelligibles (In Phaedr.frg. 6, J. Dillon, Iamblichi Chalcidensis,97).Plotinus makes the same point in Enn.5.8.11.62J. N. P.

It ismore Porphyry’s attitude than the content of his questions that seems to haveirked Iamblichus, for to Porphyry’s seemingly innocuous remark that thegods exist, Iamblichus replies:You say first that you grant that the Gods exist, but speaking in this wayis not right. For the innate knowledge [e[mfuto\" gnw'si\"] of the Gods pre-exists in our very essence; it is superior to all judgment and choice andexists prior to reason and demonstration. From the beginning it is estab-lished with the soul’s essential desire [ejfevsei] for the Good. (Myst.7.12–8.1)Iamblichus does not allow that gods may or may not be “granted” exis-tence for the purpose of discussion. The gods are the vitality that allowssuch discussions to take place. They precede and sustain all forms of life,including cognitive states. As such, divinities cannot be “known” as onemay know objects of thought. Porphyry should certainly have known thisas Plotinus’s student, but Iamblichus continues:If one must speak the truth, contact with the divine is not knowledge. Forknowledge is separated from its object by a kind of otherness. But priorto this knowledge which understands the other as “other,” there exists aself-generated . . . uniform embrace, suspended from the Gods. One mustnot suppose that one has the power to recognize or not to recognize thiscontact, nor represent it as ambiguous (for it is always uniformly estab-lished in activity). (Myst.8.3–9)In these citations Iamblichus makes two points that reflect the principlesof traditional Platonic paideia:(1) when it comes to knowing the gods weface an utter aporia;we are constitutionally unable to know them, and (2)the gods are alreadypresent to us, embedded in the very activity of ourthinking and breathing, but especially revealed in our erotic yearning (eph-esis) for the Good. As in traditional paideia,if the soul cannot first acceptits aporia,it cannot engage its innate gnosis of the gods.The closest Iamblichus comes to describing what attitude the soul mustadopt to trigger the activity of the god is in his discussion of prayer. Inresponse to Porphyry’s remark that man’s prayers are impure and unfit tobe offered to the Nous,Iamblichus retorts:Not at all! For it is due to this very fact, that we are far inferior to the Godsin power, purity, and everything else, that it is of all things most criticalthat we do pray to them to the utmost. For the awareness of our own noth-ingness[oujdeneiva\"], when we compare ourselves to the Gods, makes us turn74Gregory Shaw"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"spontaneously[aujtofuw'\"] to prayer.And from our supplication, in a shorttime we are led up to that one to whom we pray, and from our continualintercourse with it we obtain a likeness to it, and from imperfection we aregradually embraced by divine perfection. (Myst.47.13–48.4).Iamblichus’s awareness of our nothingness, like the worthlessness ofSocrates’ wisdom, or Plotinus’s insight that all efforts to increase the souldiminish it, point to the need for the soul to accept and inhabit aporiabefore engaging the gods.64I would suggest that the spontaneous prayerthat arises from this “nothingness” was the awakening of the soul’s “essen-tial desire” for the Good. When engaged in this way, prayers were them-selves the active presence of the gods. Iamblichus says:At the moment of prayer, the divine itself is quite literally joined withitself, and it is not like one entity speaking with another that it is unitedwith the spiritual conceptions in prayers.65As in Socratic paideia,the purpose of discursive thinking was to revealthe soul’s utter helplessness and aporiawith respect to knowledge of thegods. By contrast, Porphyry’s questions suggested that our connection tothe gods was capable of being solved intellectually, and Iamblichus criti-cizes Porphyry for his excessive rationalism. Thus Iamblichus:You seem to think that knowledge of divine things and of anything elseis the same, and that each step is derived from oppositions, as is usualwith dialectical propositions; but it is nothing like that at all, for theknowledge of divine things is entirely different and is separated from allcontradiction. (Myst.10.1–7)Of course, if Porphyry believed that his true self was the Noushe mightalso think himself capable of understanding divine mysteries. This kind ofhubris,Iamblichus argued, was the cause for our failing to contact thegods. He says:For being unable to lay hold of the knowledge of the Gods through rea-soning, but believing they are able to do so, men are entirely carried awayby their own human passions and make assertions about divine thingsdrawn from personal feelings. (Myst.65.16–66.2)Theurgy in Later Platonism7564In another context, Iamblichus says that when the soul becomes aware of its“ugliness” apart from the gods it is drawn to divine beauty (Myst.39.3–13).65Myst.47.9–11. Compare with Myst.48.5–11 where Iamblichus says that theurgicprayers do not derive from human beings. These prayers, he says, are sent by the godsand are the tokens (sunthemata) of the gods and therefore possess divine power."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"We have seen that Plotinus had the same caution with respect to the Oneand said that our awareness of it comes not through reasoning but by a“presence superior to knowledge” (Enn.6.9.4.3–4). Iamblichus followedPlotinus in this reserve but extended the soul’s aporiato exclude knowl-edge of all divinities, not just of the One. For a completely descended soul,aporiawas necessarily more significant and extensive.But how was the soul to engage its innate yearning for the Good? Howwas it to awaken the presence superior to all reasoning? While Plato leavesthis unexplained and portrays the engagement through erotic images,Iamblichus discovers this erotic power in theurgic rituals, that is, in tradi-tional forms of worship: rites of sacrifice, divination, and invocations of thegods. While Iamblichus was probably introduced to the term theourgiabyPorphyry, he refashioned its meaning to suit his understanding of paideia.The function of theurgic rites for Iamblichus was to awaken the soul’sinnate yearning for the divine, and since the soul was divided and scat-tered into the sensate world, this innate gnosiscould be awakened onlythrough a complexity of rites that corresponded to the complexity andintensity of the soul’s alienation.Iamblichus believed that embodiment was essential to the soul’s iden-tity and served a cosmogonic function. The soul’s inversion as well as itsreturn expressed the will of the Demiurge (Myst.272.2–12). As invertedand self-alienated, however, the soul could recover its immortality only byrecovering the traces of its divinity in the generated world. Iamblichusbelieved that these traces had been deposited by the Demiurge through-out the world (Myst.65.6) and that pious races like the Egyptians had pre-served them in rites that allowed souls to reenter their immortality (Myst.249.14–250.7).The integration of traditional religious practices into paideiawasclearly not a goal of Plotinus.66In addition to negating the soul’s cos-mogonic function as a mean between extremes, the doctrine of the unde-scended soul necessarily diminished the value of the sensible cosmos andthe rites that venerated its powers. For if the soul’s purpose was to escapefrom the illusion of embodiment, then the body and material world wouldbe obstacles to the soul. From this perspective, it is not surprising that Plot-inus referred to matter as “evil itself” (Enn.1.8.3.39–40) or that Porphyrycharacterized the soul’s salvation as a permanent escape from the cosmos“never again to find itself held and polluted by the contagion of theworld.”67In light of Platonic paideia’semphasis both on the soul’s return76Gregory Shaw66This is perhaps best exemplified in Plotinus’s remark to Amelius after he wasasked to join him in worshiping the gods: “They ought to come to me, not I tothem” (Life of Plotinus10.35–36).67Porphyry De regressu an.40*.15–16 Bidez (1964)."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"to the world after its ascent and on the complementary descent of erosfrom the gods to humanity, there is something new and unplatonic in Por-phyry’s remark. He is speaking from a dualist and anticosmic standpoint,so he was necessarily opposed to rituals that aligned the soul with cosmicpowers. Yet this was precisely the function of theurgic rituals. Iamblichusheld that it was only through these rites that the soul’s innate erosfor thegods could be awakened.If Iamblichus’s understanding of the soul provides a rationale for theimportance of aporiain Platonic paideia,then his explanation of theurgymay be seen as an effort to secure more effectively the soul’s erosfor theGood by aligning it with traditional religious rituals. For Iamblichus, theold ways, the ancient forms of worship, were concrete expressions of adivine erosfor the gods, and in terms of the individual soul, this erosplayed an essential role. The Chaldean Oraclesspeak of a “deep eros”implanted in souls by the Creator to stir their desire for him.68Like thegod-given erosof Plotinus or the “soul’s essential desire for the Good” ofIamblichus, this deep eroswas prior to all knowledge and conceptualiza-tion, so whether it was conveyed through the medium of intellectual dis-course (e.g., Plotinus) or through ritual acts, its presence was ineffable, andI believe that Iamblichus favored ritual in order to protect the soul fromintellectual self-deception in these matters.69According to Iamblichus:The Intelligible is held before the mind, not as knowable [wJ\" gnwstovn],but as desirable [wJ\" ejfetovn], and the mind is filled by this, not with knowl-edge, but with being and every intelligible perfection.70Iamblichus referred to this divine presence in the soul in a variety of ways.He says it is the “first principle in us” (Myst.10.10), provides us with an“innate knowledge of the gods” (Myst.7.14), and is the soul’s “essentialTheurgy in Later Platonism7768Chaldean Oracles,frgs. 43, 44 Majercik.69In one sense, Iamblichus might be understood as attempting to preserve theintuitions of Plotinus against the more analytical approach of Porphyry. L. G. Wes-terink noted: “Iamblichus’ purpose is to make Plotinus’ belief of the superiority ofintuition to reason the guiding principle of a new systematic approach to Plato.Intuition, which is a superior form of sight, does not proceed from point to point,but has a unified vision of the structure of all reality” (Westerink, The Greek Com-mentaries on Plato’s Phaedo I[Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing, 1976], 15). J. M. P. Lowry, Logical Principles,21ff., similarly remarks: “What Iamblichus did wasto develop this mystical side of Plotinus more systematically than Plotinus himselfhad done.”70 Cited by Damascius Dub. et Sol.1.154.9–11 Ruelle = Westerink-Combès,2.104.20–23."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"desire for the Good” (Myst.8.1–2). Although Iamblichus was somewhat laxabout what he called it, referring to it as the “divine, intelligible, and onein us” awakened in prayer (Myst.46.13–15), or more simply as “the one inthe soul,”71he was adamant in maintaining that this principle was notaproperty of the soul. As arche,this divine presence was not considered ahigher part of the soul even in a Plotinian sense, for it transcended theorder that it established.72Iamblichus claimed that this anterior principle,and not the soul, was the cause of every theurgic divination. It was, hesays, “a certain divine good which is pre-established as more ancient [pres-buteran] than our nature,”73and it was this presence that was awakenedin theurgic rites.74In the context of Platonic paideiaI believe that theurgy may be bestunderstood as Iamblichus’s elaboration and ritualization of Platonic erotics.For just as different kinds of souls were attracted to different kinds of ero-menoidepending on their position on the ladder to Absolute Beauty,75soin theurgy, different souls employed different forms of theurgic ritualdepending on their degree of intimacy with the gods. Plato’s Beauty, theonly Form that entered the sensible world to arouse our eros,was trans-formed by Iamblichus into the magnetic will of the Demiurge, drawingsouls back to their divinity. And just as the erotic madness of the Phaedrusappealed to the wise but not the learned,76so theurgy was honored by thepious but not by intellectuals like Porphyry!Before summarizing theurgy’s place in Platonic paideia,I would liketo reconsider the two paths of Platonism as represented by Plotinus andIamblichus. I believe that one reason Plotinus has been favored by recent78Gregory Shaw71In Phaedr.frg. 6 Dillon.72A generally accepted Pythagorean principle discussed by Iamblichus in DeCommuni Mathematica Scientia15.10–15 (ed.

Stobaeus Anth.2.174.9–16 where the archethat frees thesoul from fate is described as presbuteran.74Damascius, who claims to follow Iamblichus in these matters, refers to thisprinciple as the soul’s huparxis,which he describes as “the One itself, which pre-exists beyond all things and is the cause of every ousiabut is not yet itself ousia.”See Pierre Hadot, “L’être et l’étant dans le Néoplatonisme,” Revue de théologie et dephilosophie1 (1972): 110–11.

Plotinus, then, is more like us! And Iamblichus, by contrast, is anoriental: an irrational Syrian priest and occultist who claims to possess“supernatural” power to control the gods! While the image of Iamblichusis obviously a caricature, the picture we have made of Plotinus is no lessdistorted. Both Platonists sought to communicate the depths of their expe-riences, and both were misunderstood. Plotinus’s statements, for example,that the soul goes “alone to the Alone” or that the soul’s “head remainsabove” were taken out of the context of his seminars as positive state-ments about the soul’s relation with the divine rather than as invitationsto experience it.77The consequences were an anticosmism and escapistdualism hardly reflected in Plotinus’s own life. Iamblichus’s theurgicaldoctrines suffered perhaps even more distortion, for by laying excessiveemphasis on the power of the ritual act and forgetting Iamblichus’s cau-tions about first purifying the soul, scholars have assumed that theurgywas the attempt to animate statues or manipulate gods,78and they havetaken rogues like Maximus to be representative of Iamblichean theurgy.Both caricatures are false, and both are characterized by an unplatonicgrandiosity and separateness of soul: the overly spiritualized Plotiniansoul isolated and removed from the contagion of the world, and theIamblichean theurgist-as-sorcerer who controls the spirits and threatensthe gods. It is not surprising that both Plotinus and Iamblichus directedtheir harshest criticisms toward gnostics and sorcerers respectively, for thegnostic dualist (Plotinus) and the sorcerer (Iamblichus) were their owndistorted reflections.77For a correction to these distortions see A. H. Armstrong, “The Apprehensionof Divinity in the Self and the Cosmos in Plotinus,” in The Significance of Neopla-tonism(ed. R. B. Harris; Norfolk, Va.: International Society for Neoplatonic Studies,1976), 195ff.78This despite Iamblichus’s explicit condemnation of the practices of statue-makers (Myst.160.15) and his repeated statements that theurgy in no way manip-ulates the gods, e.g., Myst.42.2–5. E. R. Dodds, not Iamblichus, seems to be oursource for this view. Dodds reported the polemical remarks of the Christian JohnPhiloponus that Iamblichus tried to prove that “statues are divine” and then citedexamples of this “theurgy” in the case of Maximus and others.

ConclusionAs a theurgist, Iamblichus believed the hieratic practices he performedwere revealed by the gods and that no amount of human intelligence pos-sessed the same degree of soteriological power. As a Platonist, he alsoknew this divine revelation was not limited to a particular time, place, orculture, but was revealed continually in all times and in all places as thecosmogenesis described in the Timaeus.The revelation of the gods wasthe ceaseless unfolding of numbers from the One into the Many, descend-ing into the mathematical bases of the physical world. For the Platonictheurgist, nature was the material expression of the gods calling souls backto their role as cocreators with the Demiurge.79In Iamblichus’s monisticvision, even sensible matter, the medium of creation, was believed to berooted in the One and was necessary for our salvation.The most complex and perhaps most original aspect of Iamblichus’s Pla-tonism was his doctrine of the soul. Based on Plato’s description of the soulas a mean term made up of numerical logoi,Iamblichus found a uniqueplace for human souls as the mean between the immortality of the gods andthe mortality of created life. To recover one’s immortality within the contextand medium of mortal life—as theurgy required—meant that the soul’s deifi-cation assumed the shape of a ritually embodied world. For the theurgist,therefore, this ritualization of cosmogenesis could be described as equallyascending or descending depending on one’s perspective. From the per-spective of the embodied soul, theurgy enflamed its god-given erosand liftedit to the gods. Yet once elevated, and having ritually taken on the shape ofthe gods, the soul joined their cosmogony and descended demiurgically intothe world. Theurgic rituals were designed according to the soul’s capacity toreceive the gods, so the rites varied, reflecting the variety of human souls.Yet all theurgies, from the densely material to the spiritually refined, requiredthat the soul recognize its own “nothingness” before it was able to receivethe god and take on another life. This, in sum, was Iamblichus’s vision of aPlatonic theurgy, but was it unique?Iamblichus’s explanation of nomina barbaraand asema onomataintheurgy, and the use of the same material in gnostic and magical texts, sug-gest that gnostics and magicians may have used the same techniques andmaterials as theurgists. Birger Pearson’s suggestion that Iamblichus’s theory80Gregory Shaw79Christian (Dionysian) theurgy fails to be “theurgic” in a Platonic sense becauseits revelation was limited to a unique historical “event” and was essentially opposedto nature. James Miller has argued that the elimination of nature achieved greaterclarity for Christian theurgy and enhanced the authority of the church. In effect, theekklesiaof Christian theurgy replaced the physical cosmos of pagan theurgy.

Surely, thegreater the number of parallels and shared terms that one finds betweengnostic, magic, or Hermetic literature and that of Platonic theurgists sug-gests at least a cross-fertilization of ideas and possibly of ritual practices.Yet without more evidence it is not possible to know if these rituals hadthe same function.In the case of Iamblichean theurgy, the ritual act could never bedivorced from the proper preparation and purification of the soul. The evi-dence from Iamblichus suggests that the function of theurgic rites was toarouse the erotic presence of the One in the soul (the ascent) in a ritualmimesis of creation (the descent). While even these theurgical criteriamight be found in gnostic material, what I don’t find is an emphasis on theineffability of the gods andits correlate: the aporiaof the soul. In Platonicterms, without a clearly defined psychology to anchor our “titanic” impulseto discursive knowing, the soul can easily be led to think that it has fath-omed divine mysteries and attained a heavenly status. Iamblichus’s psy-chology ensured that the soul remained human and that divine acts,although performed by the soul, were attributed to the gods. His apparentdiminishment of the soul and separation of ontological orders may wellhave been a pedagogical strategy to protect the soul’s contact with thegods from discursive habits of self-interest. To be genuine, this contact hadto change the soul utterly. As Plotinus puts it: “it is as if he [the seer] hadbecome someone else and is not himself and does not count as his own80Birger Pearson, “Theurgic Tendencies in Gnosticism and Iamblichus’ Con-ception of Theurgy,” in Neoplatonism and Gnosticism(ed.

Patricia Cox Miller has recentlystudied the nomina barbaraand asema onomatain the context of Platonic andStoic theories of language and grammar. While she does not discuss theurgy, herstudy, like Pearson’s, reveals the complexity of thought that was hidden in “unin-telligible” spells. See Miller, “In Praise of Nonsense,” in Classical MediterraneanSpirituality(ed. A. H.

Iamblichus,similarly, says that in theurgy the soul “exchanges one life for another andgives itself to another order, having entirely abandoned its former exis-tence” (Myst.270.18–19). The separation of ontological levels and the lim-its given to the soul ensured that it genuinely experienced this exchange.83There is in Iamblichus’s Platonism a willingness to identifywith thehumiliation of the human condition that I am not aware of in gnostic ormagical literature. Damascius’s companion Isidore once remarked, aftermeeting a pretentious philosopher: “Those who would be Gods must firstbecome human!”84For the hieratic Platonists the limits of our humanitymust be fully realized in order to recover our lost divinity. The Socraticaporiaand oudeneiacentral to Platonic paideia,seem somehow missingfrom the rarefied literature of the gnostics and even from the writings ofcertain Platonists. Yet it was the mystery of mortality and its nothingnessthat lay hidden at the heart of Iamblichus’s Platonism. For, according toIamblichus, the soul’s immortality was recovered only through our mortal-ity and the experience of nothingness (oudeneia) that terrifies us all.82Gregory Shaw83Cf. Enn.1.2.7.25–28: “He will leave that [human] life behind, and chooseanother, the life of the gods: for it is to them, not to good men, that we are to bemade like.” What Plotinus came to identify with as his own undescended soul,Iamblichus left entirely as the property of the gods to be received—in exchange forhuman life—in the context of theurgic ritual.84Damascius: Vitae Isidori Reliquiae (ed.

TurnerUniversity Of Nebraska-LincolnAn action divorced from its primary practical context, ritual bears asymbolic or semiotic character. It usually serves to promote group forma-tion and social solidarity and to negotiate understanding among membersof the species. Such actions are religious when they signal a turningtowards something extra-human or super-human; indeed the very act ofturning away from the human context has an eminently social function.Usually this something is described as the sacred, something experiencedas powerful, overwhelming, majestic, solemn, enchanting. This experienceis portrayed symbolically by the juxtaposition of things threatening andalluring (pain, entrapment, exclusion, death, and sterility on the one hand,and nourishment, liberation, inclusion, life, and sexuality on the other); bygestures of submissiveness alongside displays of power; and by suddenalterations of darkness and light, covering and uncovering, stability andmovement, sound and silence. This quasi-language signals and creates sit-uations of anxiety in order to overcome them and leads from isolation andfear of abandonment to the establishment of solidarity and the reinforce-ment of status. Ritual helps to overcome situations of crisis by replacing theapathy of ordinary everyday experience with focused activity. Althoughreligious ritual borders on magic (in the sense of the nonsalvific coercionof a particular outcome apart from divine sanction), particularly when con-sciously practiced by an individual, its primary character is social and col-lective, a way of participating in the often traditional framework of socialcommunication, and its strongest motive is the fear of isolation from thegreater whole.1Although both gnostics and Platonists seemed to have sought thissense of integration and well-being primarily through conceptual means—the interpretation of texts and traditions, the use of analogy, argumenta-tion, speculation, and mythical narrative—they also engaged in ritualactivity, repeated patterns of behavior, both as individuals and groups.1I have here paraphrased the admirably succinct definition of ritual given by W.Burkert, Greek Religion(trans.

Raffan; Cambridge, Mass: Harvard UniversityPress, 1985), 54–55."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Gnostics share with Platonists the notion that salvation is the ultimateextrication of the soul or inner person from the bodily realm coupled withan ascent to its point of origin in the divine world. After the example ofPlato, many Platonists until the time of Plotinus and Porphyry could usevisionary terminology associated with the mystery religions to characterizethis ascent, but there is no evidence from this period that it was to beeffected by ritual means. After the time of Plotinus, however, many Pla-tonists adopted a form of ritual known as theurgy, in which embodiedsouls were brought into a sympathetic resonance with the divine lovgoithatinformed the natural world; divine powers were invoked to enter the phe-nomenal world in the form of purified souls intended to reveal their divinesource in the body and other physical objects, so as to assist the ascent ofthe practitioner’s soul during this life as well as its final ascent.2In appar-ent contrast to this late Platonic theurgical ritual, the salvific rites offered ingnostic sources of the same period continue to appear as symbolic enact-ments of the more typically Neopythagorean and Plotinian goal of extri-cating every soul from the physical world altogether, even when one candetect in these sources a quite positive valorization of the psychic and spir-itual cosmos.This paper surveys ritual acts described or alluded to in various gnos-tic sources, original and heresiological, and where appropriate, to com-ment upon their relation to Platonic doctrine and ritual. These will includerites of lustration, investiture, chrismation, the sacral meal, sacral marriage,sexual sacramentalism, ritual verbal performances, and ascensional andcontemplative practices in both individual and group endeavor. The paperwill concentrate mostly on Sethian and Valentinian sources, adducing othermaterial when appropriate.The rituals practiced by the gnostics, most of which they share with—and sometimes derived from—Christians, are the result of transferringrather simple, everyday acts, such as washing, applying salves and balms,changing clothes, eating and sharing a meal, arising upon awakening, andengaging in sexual intercourse, into a symbolic setting and discourse. Themain preoccupation of the gnostics seems to have been the overcoming ofan experience of alienation, and isolation, and disenchantment with thestatus quo,and they developed a number of elaborate myths in whichthey, like other groups, elevated these otherwise rather common acts intorites that had the power to overcome this alienation, and achieve a sense2Of course the ultimate goal of theurgists was the soul’s return to its stellar ori-gin (Proclus Hymn3). Iamblichus (Myst.5.26.9–18) describes the stages of prayer,whose efficacy lies entirely with the gods: initial contact and acquaintance with thedivine, establishing a common noetic bond, petition for divine gifts, and finally the“sealing” of the ineffable union.84John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"of solidarity and authenticity by realistic enactments of personal transfor-mation and integration into a larger whole. Compared with nongnostic Pla-tonists, they subjected a wider range of these ordinary acts to symbolicenactment, no doubt because they inherited many such enactments fromother religious movements known to them, such as Judaism, Christianity,and the mysteries, or simply because many gnostics were already adher-ents of those movements and were merely applying a gnostic twist to themby an innovative exploration of their symbolic resources.For gnostics as well as Jews and Christians of various stripes, the lossand recovery of a sense of integration and solidarity—personal, social, andcosmic—were expressed in two basic myths. One was the myth of a ver-tiginous fall from the heights, in which the human soul, like a bird havinglost its wings, had plummeted to earth, losing direct contact with its nativeelement; its only hope of return was the acquisition of a new set of wings,a task hindered by the beguiling conditions of its new environment, whichled to a gradual forgetfulness of its homing instinct. The other basic mythwas that of the primal androgyne, the supposed ultimate, bisexual progen-itor of all of humanity, who underwent the primeval experience of beingsundered in two, into male and female, thus creating an elementary crisisof estrangement and loss of the divine image and the need to heal this splitby the reunion of the two sexes. This myth was extremely widespread. Pla-tonists possessed a version of it in Aristophanes’ famous encomium on Erosin Plato’s Symposium,portraying Zeus’s sundering and weakening of theoriginal humans, creating their urge to reunite.3Jews and Christians readGen 1:26–27 as portraying a masculofeminine Adam, made in the trueimage of the God who transcended gender altogether, an image that waslost in the fateful division into a separate male and female (Gen 2:21–22).These myths of division and alienation underlie many of the traces of gnos-tic ritual known to us, in particular the rites of baptism, investiture, chris-mation, and sacral marriage. These rites serve to reverse that alienation:when the soul regains its wings and homing instinct, it is no longer a Ritual in Gnosticism853Symp.189d–191a: “For in the beginning there were three races of men, not thetwo of male and female as now, but also a third sharing the nature of both, whosename is extant but the creature not. For at that time there was an androgyne, a sin-gle species and name shared by both male and female ....their strength and vigorwas awesome and their arrogance was great....taking thought, Zeus said, ‘Itseems to me that there is a strategy by which these humans might both survive andcease from their intemperance by becoming weaker; I propose to split them in half,and therewith they will be weaker.’ . . . having said this, he split the humans in two. . . since their nature was bisected, each yearned to unite with its other half.” Thethemes of original androgynous unity and its superiority, the divine jealousy, thesplit, the attendant weakness, and the urge to reunite all return in gnostic thought."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"captive. When the primal image of God is restored, man is no longerdivided—not even by the most fundamental division of all, male and female.4Of these four fundamental rites, baptism, though its origins lie in thesphere of repeatable acts of lustration and purification, seems to be aninitiatory rite generally—but not necessarily always—practiced only onceas the initial break with one’s flawed past and an entrance into a newstate of reunification, while the other three seem to be repeatable acts ofcelebration and intensification of one’s awareness of that reunification.Closely associated with baptism are the act of chrismation and investi-ture, which early Christian texts often treat as a postlude to baptism;indeed baptism and chrismation were both called “seals,” marking one asreborn and belonging to God. While these rites mostly appear to be unre-peatable acts of initiation, the sacral meal, the Eucharist, though often fol-lowing baptism, was repeatable. The sacral marriage known as the“bridal chamber,” though its origins lie in biblical metaphor, seems to bea peculiarly gnostic ritual; although it usually had an eschatological ref-erence, it could become repeatable, particularly when enacted as anexplicitly sexual sacrament.Besides these major rituals, gnostics share with all groups the ritual useof speech, especially prayer formulas (doxologies, aretalogies, petitions,etc.), hymns, aretalogies, recognition formulas, and ecstatic utterances(chants, syllables of power, glossalalia, etc.). Particularly intriguing is therite of contemplative, visionary ascension; although one tends to think ofthis as the practice of isolated individuals, it acquired the status of a rite,not only among the devotees of Hermes Trismegistus, but especiallyamong the Sethian gnostics, probably because it was originally developedin a baptismal context. Other forms of ritual behavior not easily character-ized as specific rites may include certain explicit life-styles clearly separat-ing an individual or community from the norm, mostly of an encratitic sort,which include fasting, eremitic withdrawal, celibacy, or the erection ofimages, statues, and cultic buildings.86John D.

Baptism1.1. Sethian BaptismThe Sethian gnostic treatises from the Nag Hammadi library containnot only numerous accounts of visions of the transcendental world andits contents, but also numerous references to baptisms, washings,anointings, and sealings, and numerous instances of various prayers,doxologies, and hymns mentioning or directed to a rather fixed set ofdivine beings. Such references generally occur in stanzaic, even hymnic,passages to be found especially in the Gospel of the Egyptians, Apoca-lypse of Adam, Melchizedek, Zostrianos, Apocryphon of John,and Tri-morphic Protennoia.They apparently refer to a sequence of ritual actsinvolving a kind of baptism, which the texts often designate by the term“the Five Seals.” The Sethian texts providing the most detail about theFive Seals are the Gospel of the Egyptiansand the Trimorphic Proten-noia,but they do not reveal the precise ritual character of these FiveSeals, with the result that the rite must be reconstructed from their ratherallusive allusions to it. The texts contain no liturgical rubrics. Baptism isan extremely well attested rite in the early Christian world, where it andthe various symbolic acts that comprise this rite are commonly called“seals.” So the basic puzzle is the meaning of the term “five”: does itrefer to a single act performed five times, e.g., a quintuple immersion incontrast to the typically triple immersion of Christian baptism, or does itrefer to five ritual acts comprising the rite, or to some mysterious tran-scendental Pentad of names (Trimorphic ProtennoiaNHC XIII 49,28–32)or aeons (Apocryphon of JohnNHC II 6,2–10)?5The texts do not tell us.Ritual in Gnosticism875The main passages are: Gos.

NHCVIII,15,11–7,22; 15,1–21; 47,1–63,9); the Pronoia hymn of Ap. John(II,130,11–31,25); Trim.

Prot.XIII,148,31; 49,27–28; 47,29; 50,9–10)."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"By way of comparison, the normal Christian baptismal rite contained atleast four procedures: removal of outer garments and renunciation of thedevil, removal of all garments and anointing with oil, baptismal immer-sion, and reclothing in white garments; often this was supplemented bya fifth, the chrismation.688John D. TurnerThe fundamental study of these remains that of J.-M. Sevrin, Le dossier baptismalSéthien(BCNHE 2; Québec: Presses de l’Université Laval, 1986). The Sethian rite ofthe Five Seals (investiture, baptism in the Living Water, enthronement, glorification,and enlightenment in Trim. Prot.48,15–35; 45,12–20), appears to have been com-plete in itself and effective of salvation. It includes acts similar to those in 2 En. 22(stripping of earthly garments, anointing, investing, enlightening) and in T. Levi8:2–10 (investing as priest and king, anointing, washing, feeding, drinking, furtherinvesting, and crowning). In T. Levi18:6–7 at the advent of the eschatologicalpriest, a star arises, emitting the light of knowledge, the Father’s Voice issues fromthe heavenly temple, and the spirit of understanding rests upon him in the water.The similarity of these motifs to those of the synoptic accounts of Jesus’ baptism isobvious. Similar baptismal motifs occur in the Odes of Solomon(11:7–16: drinkingLiving Water, stripping away of folly, investing with radiance and enlightenment;24:1–5: the Voice of the dove above the Messiah and the opening of the abysses).The sequence of acts in the Sethian Five Seals is also nearly duplicated in the Man-daean Maßbutaas summarized by Kurt Rudolph, Die Mandäer,vol 2: Der Kult(FRLANT NS 57; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1961), 88–89: investiture,entrance into the “jordan,” triple self-immersion, triple immersion by the priest,triple signation with water, triple drink, crowning or wreathing, invocation of divinenames, ritual handshake (kuSta), and ascent from the “jordan.” Like many of thesebaptismal materials, the Sethian baptismal materials seem consistently to link thedescent of the savior (Seth or Christ as the Logos) into the world with the descentof the baptizand into the water or world of chaos, and the visionary ascent of thebaptizand out of the water or world into the light with a sort of royal enthrone-ment of the baptizand. The similar pattern of various of the NT christologicalhymns may also be seen against such a baptismal environment (e.g., Phil 2:6–11;Col 2:9–15; John 1:1–16).6By mid-second century, the Christian baptismal ritual comprised (with regionalvariations) approximately the following sequence of acts (in certain regions pre-ceded by a two-day fast and an all-night vigil culminating with the rite performedin darkness): (1) renunciation of sin and Satan (later spoken with outstretched armsand facing westwards), sometimes coupled with removal of the outer garments,standing in penance on sackcloth or goatskin, and a prebaptismal anointing witholive oil (a gesture of healing) and cruciform signation on the forehead (either asa kind of exorcism or as an epiclesisof the Holy Spirit); (2) an optional signationwith oil on the forehead, after which the postulant strips naked (reminding the pos-tulant of the primal nudity of Adam and Eve in the garden; in cases where therewas a baptistery, stripping occurred after entrance into the inner chamber, calledby Cyril the holy of holies); (3) an optional complete prebaptismal anointing withoil; (4) water baptism by immersion accompanied by invocation of “the Names”"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Sethian texts are unusual in that, perhaps to a greater degree thanis the case with the corpora of other gnostic groups, they conceive the bap-tismal rite as a series of visionary experiences resulting in complete enlight-enment and therefore total salvation. In spite of the allusions to ritual actsthat could indeed be enacted by ordinary human beings, the importanceof the rite lay primarily in the spiritual plane, an emphasis characteristic ofChristian and probably non-Christian baptizing circles throughout the firstcentury. The Sethian baptismal water was understood to be of a celestialnature, a Living Water identical with light or enlightenment. Although inearlier Sethian treatises this rite is usually said to be “received,” later trea-tises portray a self-performable contemplative technique that could beenacted either by means of—or independently of—outward ritual actions.Terms that ordinarily refer to ritual acts, such as “baptism,” “immersion,”“disrobing,” “enrobing,” “stripping off,” “putting on,” “sealing,” and thelike, also designate acts of mental transformation, conceptual refinementand abstraction from the world of psychic and sensible experience, absten-tion from previous behavioral dispositions, “unlearning” of older andRitual in Gnosticism89(usually threefold and including affirmations of creedal interrogations, later spokeneastward); (5) emergence from the water (in which the baptizand is to imaginehimself or herself as clothed in a radiant garment); (6) an optional postbaptismalanointing of various parts of the body with oil or myrrh (absent in the Syrian rite,and thus likely a secondary addition); (7) investiture (usually in white clothing, sig-nifying receipt of the light of immortality, supplemented in Egypt much later witha crowning); (8) in the Western church, a postbaptismal anointing (chrismation) ofthe head by the priest or bishop with oil or myrrh; and (9) an imposition of hands,usually by the bishop, which may include a further anointing and “sealing” on theforehead. Any one of these acts, the anointings (prior to baptism conceived asapotropaic, after baptism as confirmation), the imposition of hands or the baptismitself might be called a “seal.” To judge from Acts Thom.26–27, the ascent from thewater (Syriac version) or the chrismation (Greek version) may also involve lumi-nous appearances of the Savior; Justin Martyr (1 Apol.61.11–12) characterizes thebaptismal washing as “enlightenment” (fwtismov\").

It is natural to assume that such a mental transfor-mation arose out of the individual experience of actual cultic and ritualpraxis of a sort that could be taught and enacted either while participatingin the physical setting and associated gestures of the rite or quite apartfrom them.7We do not know whether this rite was a once-for-all initiation,as it appears to be in earlier Sethian treatises, or was administered repeat-edly; later treatises witness what seems to be a gradual extraction of theclearly repeatable visionary component from the baptismal setting.In the earlier Sethian texts that portray the advent of salvation as coin-cident with the third and final manifestation in this world (the first twooccur in primordial times)8of the divine mother Barbelo, she confers the90John D.

At this point, theinitiate or the visionary is “neither this nor that, and yet is both” (V. W. Turner,“Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites of Passage” in Forest of Symbols[Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1967], 98), neither enlightened nor unen-lightened, but inhabiting a liminal state of literal or figurative nakedness, humility,and passivity, with no claim to status or possession of knowledge. The third phaseof the initiatory “rite of passage,” aggregation, means incorporation not only into anew state of awareness and into the elect group that inhabits this state, but also theadvent of a new cosmic situation, such as the defeat of the hostile cosmic powersand the dissolution of chaos. In the Sethian treatises, typical metaphors for aggre-gation are Pronoia’s gathering of all her members, or in the contemplative ascent,“standing,” and being assimilated to increasingly higher levels of reality. As Ploti-nus observed, such transformed persons thought themselves superior in rank to thevery stars, even to the gods themselves (Enn.2.9 [33].9.43–60).8The Sethian scheme of salvation is centered around the supreme trinity of theFather, Mother, and Son: the Invisible Spirit, the male virgin Barbelo who is theInvisible Spirit’s First Thought (Ennoia, Protennoia), and their offspring, the divineAutogenes (identified as Christ in the Christian Sethian treatises; in an unpublishedpaper, “The Virgin Became Male: The Feminine Principle in Platonic and GnosticMetaphysics,” I have tried to show that the Father-Mother-Son nomenclature islikely to be an adaptation of the Father, Mother, Child triad developed by Plato inTim.48–52, representing respectively the transcendent Forms as father, the recep-tacle and nurse of becoming as mother, and the images comprising the phenome-nal world as child or offspring). The main agent of salvation is the Mother Barbelo,who in various guises descends into the world to rescue the spiritual substance that had been captured in human bodies through the ignorant act of the ArchonYaldabaoth, the aborted offspring of Barbelo’s lower double, Sophia. Typically,Barbelo descends thrice into the world. First she projects the image of Adamas, thearchetypal human, which the Archon undiscerningly incorporated into a psycho-somatic human copy.

According to the Trimorphic Protennoia,Protennoia (Barbelo) descends for the third time as the Logos, confers theFive Seals, and finally puts on Jesus, removes him from the cross, andbears him and her seed aloft into the holy light. Similarly, the Pronoia are-talogy concluding the longer version of the Apocryphon of John(NHC II30,11–31,25) depicts the figure of Pronoia (Barbelo) as conferring the FiveSeals on her third and final descent. The primary actor behind the scenesis the divine Mother Barbelo, who appears to be a higher, unfallen dou-ble of Sophia, the divine wisdom. The imagery of water, light, ascent, anddescent found in the Pronoia hymn and in the Trimorphic Protennoiaseems heavily indebted to the hellenized Jewish wisdom tradition.9Thesetwo works appear to be old, likely contemporaneous with the Johannineprologue with which they share a common vocabulary and mythologicalstructure, suggesting an early date for these works, perhaps the early sec-ond century C.E.The Sethian text most replete with data for the reconstruction of theritual acts that comprise Sethian baptism is the Gospel of the EgyptiansRitual in Gnosticism91causing them to eat of the tree of knowledge and enabling them to produce theirson Seth in the true image of God. Seth becomes the father of an “immovable race”of potentially enlightened people destined to live a perilous life among the massof immoral humanity descended from Cain, the illegitimate son of the physical Eveby the Archon. Her third and final salvational act is her descent to the contempo-rary members of that race, the contemporary Sethian gnostics, taking on the formof the divine Logos, or Christ, or of Seth himself.9According to it, the exalted Sophia is the fountain or spring (cf. Sir 15:3; 24:30;Philo, Fug.195) from which flows the Word like a river (Philo, Somn.2.242; cf.Fug.97). She is also equated with the living water of which God is the source (cf.Prov 16:22; 14:27; Cant 4:15 and Bar 3:12 with Jer 2:13; 17:13 [LXX]; John 4:10; 7:38;and Odes Sol.11:5–9; 30:1–6). She is the Mother of the Word through whom theuniverse came to be (Philo, Fug.109), the mother of all creatures (Philo, Det.115–16). To be baptized in her water is to receive true Gnosis. Her Voice is the rev-elation of the truth. The same sort of myth of descent applied to Barbelo or theFirst Thought in the Sethian treatises figures also in the story of Sophia in 1 En.42and other sources—such as the Johannine prologue—where Wisdom (or theLogos) descends to find a place to dwell among men, but meeting with initial fail-ure, reascends or tries again."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"(NHC III,2and IV,1). In it, this baptism involves the begetting of the saintsthrough invisible secret symbols, the “killing” (Coptic Hw!tb, IV 75,3–4; III63,3–12 has Hw!tp, “reconciliation”) and renunciation of both the worldand the “god of the thirteen aeons,” and the invoked (ejpivklhtoi) presenceof certain holy, ineffable beings along with the light of the Father. AlthoughSeth is said to have appeared in the primeval world to deliver his race fromthe Archon’s destructive acts (the flood and conflagration), the Mother nowsends him for a third time. At his appearance along with certain divinebeings or angels who are to guard the incorruptible race until the con-summation of the age, the “great men of the great Seth” receive a vision ofvarious spiritual beings whose names occur repeatedly in the baptismalsections of the Sethian treatises.10Evidence of ritual activity abounds in this text. In NHC III 65,26–66,8it is said that through the incorruptible man Poimael, those “who are wor-thy of (the) invocation [ejpivklhto\"], the renunciations [ajpotavxei\"] of theFive Seals11in the spring-baptism will know their receivers [paralhvmp-tore\"] as they are instructed about them.” In III 66,9–68,1 there follows along prayer in which the baptizand praises the Living Water “YesseusMazareus Yessedekeus” as the eternal Jesus who truly is, the glorious namethat is now upon and within him, granting him immutability and the armorof light. Stretching out his hands while yet folded, the baptizand apparentlysymbolically portrays the containment of the inner light or the circle of allthose who have received enlightenment, and praises the man (Seth?) whoraises up the man (Jesus?) in whose name the baptizand will be purified.Having received the incense of life (the Holy Spirit?), the baptizand hasmixed it with “water after the model of the archons” (presumably theearthly water of his baptism), now to live with the Savior in the peace ofthe saints.Here one has a series of references to certain gestures and verbal per-formances capable of ritual enactment: renunciation, invocation, naming ofholy powers, doxological prayer to the living water, receipt of incense,manual gestures, as well as baptismal immersion itself. Whether any ofthese acts, and if so, which ones, comprise the Five Seals is difficult to tell;92John D. Turner10They include: Yesseus Mazareus Yessedekeus the living water, Micheus,Michar and Mnesinous, who preside over the “spring of truth” or “the gate of thewaters,” Seldao and Elainos, who preside over the “mountain” (perhaps Charaxiô[III,268,13], “mountain [Heb. rh'] of the worthy [Gk. ajxiw'n]”), the Four Lights Har-mozel, Oroiael, Davithe, and Eleleth along with their “ministers” Gamaliel, Gabriel,Samblo, and Abrasax, and finally Yoel, who presides over the divine name withwhich one is baptized.11Here one might interpret the Five Seals as five renunciations, but it seems tome unlikely."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"certainly renunciation, invocation, and the extension of the arms were fre-quently part of the baptismal rite in the wider church.12Throughout, theuse of the passive voice for ritual actions and the use of plural referencesto the saints begotten “through instruction” suggests a community ritual inwhich there were initiates and officiants, as well as a tradition of prescribedactions and declarations.What is more, it may be that the entire Gospel of the Egyptiansand notjust its conclusion has a ritual or liturgical function. There are five doxolo-gies (IV 59,13–29; III 49,22–50,17; 53,12–54,11; 55,16–56,3; 61,23–62,13)punctuating the completion of various stages of its cosmology, whichinvoke a fixed set of beings.13This doxological inventory has the fixity ofa liturgical formula. If the term “Five Seals” originally designated a fivefoldor five-stage baptismal procedure, it may be that the Gospel of the Egyp-tianswas read aloud during the administration of each phase of the ritual:after the reading of each of the five sections of the cosmology, the bapti-zand might have repeated this doxology as a way of affirming the receiptof each of the Five Seals. A similar correlation between baptismal sealingsand depictions of the structure and deployment of the transcendent worldoccurs also in Zostrianos,although there the sealings are clearly given acelestial, rather than earthly, setting.Furthermore, in both the Gospel of the Egyptiansand the TrimorphicProtennoia,the final act of salvation is the descent of Seth in the form ofthe Logos or of the Logos in the form of Christ, who “puts on,” that is,appears in the form of, Jesus. The salvation of Jesus implied in these twotexts certainly reflects Christian influence, but of an extremely polemicalsort, since rather than being the Savior, Jesus becomes the one saved. Inview of this Sethian christological reinterpretation, one would characterizethe present form of these two texts as reacting to rather than merely sub-mitting to Christian influence.The Apocalypse of Adamcontains a dream vision revealed to Adam bythree glorious men who narrate a third saving mission conducted by anilluminator whose origin is unknown to the evil powers. Thirteen opinionsof his origins are rejected; in reality he comes from a great aeon toenlighten his elect. The illuminator experiences neither birth nor genera-tion, nor does he receive nourishment, glory, and power in the beyondRitual in Gnosticism9312The components are similar to those found in early Christian baptismal litur-gies; see above, note 6.13They include the Invisible Spirit, Barbelo, the thrice-male Child, the male vir-gin Youel, Esephech the Child of the Child, and the Doxomedon aeon. A similarset of beings are invoked in the doxologies of Melchizedek(IX,15,17–6,10;14,16–18,7), there revealed by Gamaliel and pronounced by Melchizedek as he isbaptized."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"and then “come (down) to the water.” The Illuminator is not first born intothe world and then baptized in the waters of the Jordan, which the authoror redactor regards as polluted and chaotic.14Instead, the Illuminatorremains above in the light where he resides with the three imperishableilluminators Yesseus, Mazareus, Yessedekeus, the Living Water, and firstappears in the world not at his own “birth” or baptism, but at the time hebaptizes his “seed,” who receive his name on the water.15At some point,angelic beings will bring the truth to the earthly Sethians in a way inde-pendent of the written word of the evil creator, a truth that is communi-cated by a holy baptism through a logos-begotten illuminator whodescends to the water during baptism. Thus there is a distinction betweenthe holy baptism with Living Water and a baptism ordained by the creatorand practiced by his servants who have polluted the water of life.Using nomenclature reminiscent of that found in the Apocryphon ofJohn,the Trimorphic Protennoiaidentifies the initiator and bringer of sal-vation, conferred on her third descent in the form of the Five Seals, as Pro-tennoia or Barbelo, the First Thought of the Invisible Spirit.16At variouspoints throughout the Trimorphic Protennoia,the triple descent of Pro-tennoia and the various forms in which she appears, namely as Voice,Speech, and Word, are interpreted by means of concepts that are drawn94John D. Turner14In the Sethian theogony and cosmogony, a similar distinction is maintainedbetween the transcendent luminous living water in which Barbelo emerges as afaithful reflection of the Invisible Spirit’s thought (cf. Ap. JohnNHC II,14,18–28)and the dark and chaotic waters below produced by the downward inclination ofSophia, from which the demiurge produces the physical cosmos as merely a paleand inauthentic reflection of the divine aeons (e.g., Zost.NHC VIII,19,16–10,18;Hyp. Arch.NHC II,487,11–20 and parallels). See Hippolytus, Ref.5.19.21, andbelow on Justin’s Baruch.15Clearly these thirteen “birth stories” about the Illuminator are being reinter-preted in the light of earlier traditions about the descent of the spirit upon Jesus athis baptism. See below on the Basilideans, and J. M. Robinson, “On the Gattungof Mark (and John),” in Jesus and Man’s Hope(175th Anniversary Festival on theGospels at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary) Perspective11.2 (1970): 99–129, espe-cially 119–29.16She appears in three successive forms: First, as Father, she is the divine but asyet inarticulate Voice of the First Thought of the Invisible Spirit who presides overthe establishing of the heavenly dwellings for her members and descends to chaosto loosen their bonds. Second, as Mother, she is the articulate Speech of theThought who overthrows the old aeon ruled by the evil powers and announces thedawn of the new age. Third, as the Son, she is the fully articulate Logos who adoptsthe guise of successively lower powers, descends to and enters the “tents” of hermembers, puts on Jesus, thus rescuing him from the cross, and leads her membersback to the light by means of the celestial ascent ritual of the Five Seals."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Ritual in Gnosticism95from the Sethian baptismal terminology: the Voice is said to be the unpol-luted spring from which flows Living Water, characterized as radiant light.17Rather than designating a fivefold immersion in the Living Water, theFive Seals are interpreted as a five-stage ritual of ascension, which servesto strip the inner spirit of its chaotic psychic and material garments andreclothe it with shining light. The spirit is invested with the robes of light,enthroned, baptized by Micheus, Michar, and Mnesinous in the spring ofLiving Water, glorified with the Fatherhood, and raptured into the light(perhaps the Four Lights) by the servants of the Four Lights Kamaliel,[. . . ]anen, and Samblo (XIII 48,15–35). Clearly the rapture into the light isthe equivalent of the baptismal fwtismov\"spoke of by Justin, Cyril, andother patristic authors. The five stages of this ascensional rite do not seemto follow in an intuitively obvious sequence (e.g., in 45,13–20 one has thefollowing sequence: glorification, enthronement, investiture, baptism, andbecoming Light). Indeed, since most cults practiced naked baptism, onemight expect the order: baptism, investiture, enthronement, glorification,and final rapture (see above, note 6).In the concluding section of the Trimorphic Protennoia,the Five Sealsare equated with the “ineffable ordinances of the Father,” taught by Pro-tennoia to her “members,” “the brethren.” The Five Seals are said to be“complete by means of Nous.” Whoever possesses the Five Seals “of theseparticular names”18has stripped away all ignorance and darkness and hasput on a shining light, permanently free from ignorance and the power ofthe hostile archontic forces, and experiencing a mutual indwelling with17Gnosis, or perhaps the seed of Seth; cf. Gos. Eg.III,256,4–13. Cf. the radiantlight with which the Invisible Spirit is surrounded in Ap. JohnII,14,18–26, as wellas the important place given to the Four Lights. The Word, bearing Living Fruit,pays the tribute of this Fruit to the Living Water, which it pours out upon Proten-noia’s “Spirit” (i.e., her gnostic “members” who share affinity with her), which orig-inated from the Living Water but is now trapped in the soul (i.e., the psychic realm)below. The baptismal rite of the Five Seals is the celestial ascent by which onestrips off the psychic and somatic garments of ignorance (cf. Col 2:11–15). It trans-forms and purifies Protennoia’s members within those aeons from which Proten-noia initially revealed her masculine likeness (XIII 43,20–25; probably in the formof the Autogenes who established the Four Lights), and it clothes them with radi-ant light (48,7–14).18NHC XIII,149,29–30: TTe \\nsfragis \\nte neeiran ete naI ne. The use of theCoptic relative clause ete naI nein the absolute seems odd; perhaps it once had apredicate, now lost, providing a more specific gloss on the Five Seals. As it stands,its antecedent is “these names,” presumably the names of the beings named in48,15–35. The effect of this phrase is to identify the Five Seals with a (ritual) invo-cation of the names of these spiritual beings, the baptizers, guardians, investitors,rapturers, glorifiers, enthroners, and others associated with the baptismal rite."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Protennoia until the time when she gathers all her members into her eter-nal kingdom. Here the Five Seals are connected with communicable doc-trine and the ability to name and experience the presence of certainspiritual beings, a doctrine that entails the stripping away of the ignoranceof common perception and the adoption (putting on) of an appropriateway of seeing things. The rite is the dramatization of this process, and theSethian myth its narratization. The fact that this text refers to the recipientsof the baptismal ascent ritual in the first person plural and as “brethren”suggests a (Sethian) community with a well-established tradition of waterbaptism that has been conceived as a mystery of celestial ascent, andwhich brings Gnosis (NHC XIII 48,33–34) and total salvation.In many ways, the Sethian text that most abounds with baptismalimagery is Zostrianos,although the extant remains do not mention the FiveSeals, and the imagery has been divorced from any actual water rite.Throughout the first sixty or so pages, it seems that Zostrianos is baptizedat least twenty times in the course of his ascent, once at the airy earth (theatmosphere below the moon), seven times in the copies of the aeons (theplanetary spheres), once in the Transmigration (paroivkhsi\", probably thesphere of the fixed stars), and six times in the Repentance, for a subtotalof fifteen. At the level of the Self-begotten Ones he is baptized four timesby the traditional Sethian baptizers and purifiers, each time standing as anangel upon the level of each of the Four Lights, and again for a fifth timeat the level of Autogenes, where he becomes divine and enters the Aeonof Barbelo. In a further baptism at the level of the Triple Male Child, hebecomes truly existing, and lastly, it seems that he is baptized once againat the level of Protophanes, where he becomes perfect, for a subtotal ofseven, and a grand total of some twenty-two baptisms, washings, and seal-ings. Although the fragmentary state of the text precludes certainty on thetotal number of baptisms or their precise significance, here baptism hasbecome interpreted as a metaphor for the process by which a visionarybecomes assimilated to the being and nature of each level of the tran-scendent realm to which he ascends.Zostrianosportrays a visionary and auditory experience that has noexplicit ritual setting. Terms which may once have had a ritual referencenow serve only as means to articulate the various stages of a visionaryascent. Celestial baptisms denote stages of increasing spiritual enlighten-ment, while the earthly experience of the nonspiritual mass of humanity isregarded as a “baptism with death” (NHC VIII 131,2). Perhaps Zostrianoslies at the terminus of a process of development in which a traditionalpractice of visionary ascent that originally arose in the context of Sethianbaptismal practice as it is reflected in the Apocryphon of John,the Trimor-phic Protennoia,and the Gospel of the Egyptianswas subsequently trans-formed from an original practice of water baptism into a self-contained and96John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Ritual in Gnosticism97self-performable contemplative practice engaged in either by lone individ-uals or by groups (as the Three Steles of Seth,NHC VII 126,31–127,22 makesclear). Perhaps it is merely a later expression of an original but alternativetrajectory of visionary practices that developed alongside but independ-ently of the Sethian communal water rites. Knowledge of the nature of theSethian encounter with both Platonism and Christian forms of gnosticSethianism would certainly help to resolve this puzzle.As an immersion in water, baptism may also have a negative connota-tion, especially when it signifies immersion in materiality, symbolized bythe chaotic waters underlying the natural cosmos. Gnostics applied thisnegative connotation to what they considered to be the lower baptismundergone by nongnostic Christians. Like the Apocalypse of Adam(NHC V84,4–85,30) and Zostrianos(NHC VIII 131,2–5), the Paraphrase of Shem(NHC VII 30,21–27; 37,19–38,6) speaks also of an impure baptism in a darkwater that enslaves, evidently a polemic against ordinary water baptism.The Archontics, whom Epiphanius (Pan.40.2.6–8) presents as an offshootof the Sethians, reject completely the baptism and sacraments of the churchas deriving from the inferior law-giver Sabaoth; to shun baptism is toenhance the prospect of acquiring of the gnosis enabling their return to theMother-Father of the All.1.2. Valentinian BaptismThe patristic accounts of the Valentinian baptismal practices agree onthree basic features of Valentinian baptismal practice.19The first is thepresence of two separate baptisms among the Valentinians. The “psychics”had access to the “normal” Christian one, while the “pneumatics” couldgain closer contact with the divine by a second rite, which Irenaeus andHippolytus called the “redemption.” Rather than devaluing the standard,psychic baptism, as Irenaeus thinks, both the Nag Hammadi sources andpatristic sources, such as Clement of Alexandria’s Excerpta ex Theodoto,demonstrate great concern for the psychics. Secondly, patristic accounts allagree that these rituals were salvific sacraments, and thirdly, they associatebaptism (perhaps both baptisms) with the remission of sins. The Excerptaex Theodoto(76–86) characterize the first, water baptism as a “sealing”done in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which givespsychic Christians power over sin, allowing them to be reborn, control theimpure spirits, and gain entry to the marriage feast in the end times. Bap-tism affords access to saving knowledge, as Exc.78 states:19According to the detailed analysis of M. R. Desjardins, “Baptism in Valentini-anism,” a paper delivered at the 1987 Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Lit-erature."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Until baptism, they say, Fate is effective, but after it the astrologers nolonger speak the truth. It is not the washing alone that makes us free, butalso the knowledge of who we were, what we have we become, wherewe were, into what place we have we been cast, whither we are hasten-ing, from what we are delivered, what birth is, and what rebirth.According to Hippolytus, (Ref.6.41), Marcus taught that a secondwashing or baptism, called the “redemption” (ajpoluvtrwsi\"), was availableto Christians through him. It normally required special and extensiveinstructions beforehand, but a bishop could also administer it to those whowere on their deathbed. Anyone undergoing the rite of redemptionbelonged to “the perfect power and inconceivable authority” and was nolonger affected by sin. According to Irenaeus (Haer.1.21.2), psychic bap-tism is said to have been inaugurated by John the Baptist with a view torepentance and instituted by the visible Jesus for the remission of sins.Redemption, on the other hand, was brought by Christ descending onJesus, with a view to perfection; this is another instance of the widespreadgnostic adoption of the traditions about Jesus’ inaugural baptism, in whichhe sees the heavens opened and receives both the Spirit and adoption asSon of God. Hippolytus (Ref.6.35.5) attests that the Italian Valentiniansconsidered Jesus’ body to be psychic, but made pneumatic and raised fromthe dead at his baptism by the Spirit, said to be the Logos of his motherSophia. As in the Sethian treatises, traditions about the descent of the Spiritupon Jesus at his baptism justify the distinction; indeed Irenaeus speaks ofthe Valentinian tendency to gather Gospel allusions (e.g., Luke 12:50; Matt20:20) to support the necessity of another baptism. The remission of sinsis linked to baptism, and thence to repentance, the psychics, and the min-istries of John and the visible Jesus. Redemption, on the other hand, islinked to pneumatics, perfection, and Christ descending on Jesus.According to Clement of Alexandria’s Excerpta ex Theodoto(22.1), themale angelic counterparts of Valentinian Christians are themselves baptizedthrough the redemption of the same name that descended to redeem Jesusat his own baptism. These angels are baptized “for the dead,” that is, forthe earthly Valentinians, imparting to them the name of the son by whichthey are enabled to pass through the Limit into the Pleroma. The imposi-tion of hands, apparently in connection with the baptismal rite, confers theangelic redemption, tantamount to being baptized in the same name aswas one’s angelic counterpart.For the Tripartite Tractate(NHC I 127,25), Valentinian baptism isequivalent to the redemption, the second baptism (the baptism “in thefullest sense” as opposed to “the baptism which we previously men-tioned”). Redemption occurs when one confesses faith in the names of theTrinity and is equivalent to entering a state of tranquillity, enlightenment,98John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"and immortality; it is the bridal chamber. It is the ritual that above all oth-ers that functioned as the seal of the union between the author’s commu-nity and the Father, who grants knowledge of himself in exchange for thebeliever’s confession of faith.According to the Gospel of Philip,becoming perfect by acquiring thespiritual resurrection while yet on earth enables Christians to bypass post-mortem suffering in the Middle (mesovth\") and proceed directly to the Fatherand his rest. Such perfection is enabled by no less than five sacraments.20Inbaptism, one strips off the old self and puts on a spiritual body; the chrismconfers the Holy Spirit, creating the spiritual or pneumatic person; theEucharist does the same, except using the symbols of bread and a cup ofwine mixed with water, probably on a repeated basis. The redemptionseems to be an oil rite, perhaps a sort of confession or extreme unction (likethe Mandaean Masiqta), or perhaps a post-baptismal chrismation as was cus-tomary in the Western (but not Syrian) church. The bridal chamber seems tobe a proleptic enactment of one’s final entrance into the Pleroma, perhapssymbolized by a ritual kiss (cf. the kiss of peace in the Apostolic Constitu-tionsand the ritual handshake [kuSta] in the Mandaean Maßbuta).The Gospel of Philip(NHC II 67,28–30) names these five sacraments,evidently in order of importance, although their distinctiveness is oftenblurred, perhaps because they are understood as being all interdependent.As Meeks observes, it illustrates the tendency of motifs originally con-nected with baptism to become distinct rituals, as the mythical context ofthese motifs also becomes more elaborate.21Thus, while the receiving ofRitual in Gnosticism9920For sacraments in the Gospel of Philip,see R.

Christ’s own participation in baptism and Eucharist (by institutingthe Last Supper) of course renders these sacraments of particular impor-tance. These rites are arranged in an ascending order (69,14–29), e.g., thechrism is superior to the baptism (74,12–13), yet baptism can includeredemption (69,25–26), and chrism the Eucharist (74,36–75,11), althoughthe supreme rite is the bridal chamber (64,31–70,22).22Because of thisoverlapping, it is really impossible to tell whether these were enacted sep-arately or in combination.It seems likely that the first three rites (baptism, chrism, and Eucharist,perhaps unrepeatable) were included in same initiation ceremony, whilethe redemption and bridal chamber constituted a sort of second baptism(cf. 75,1–2) and were capable of repetition. According to Desjardins,23Baptism, reinforced by chrism (the “second baptism” done with oliveoil—73,17–18), actually provides immortality. In these two rites, purifica-tion occurs visibly through water and invisibly through fire and light(57,22–28). Jesus has purified and perfected the water at baptism (77,7–9)and God has “dyed it” (63,25–30), yet it is still possible for someone toemerge from the water baptism without having received the Holy Spirit64,22–31). So, “it is fitting to baptize in the two, in the light and the water.Now the light is the chrism” (69,11–13). This dual baptism provides theresurrection (69,25–26) and perfection: “He who has been anointed pos-sesses everything. He possesses the resurrection, the light, the cross, theHoly Spirit; the Father gave him this in the bridal chamber” (74,18–22). Inturn, this resurrection requires a spiritual flesh, which the eucharist pro-vides (56,26–57,22; cf. also 75,14–24).According to 69,14–70,4, just as the Jerusalem temple supposedly consistedof a succession of enclosing chambers, the holy enclosing the holy of theholy, which in turn encloses the holy of the holies, so also baptismincludes the resurrection and the redemption, which latter occurs in thebridal chamber. In turn, this resurrection requires a spiritual flesh, whichthe Eucharist provides (56,26–57,22; cf. 75,14–24). Both resurrection andbaptism must be received while one is still alive (73,1–7); likewise, if one100John D. Turner22So M. R.

Phil.II 61,12–20; 64,22–31; 69,4–14; 73,1–8; and 75,21–25 belongs to an early stratum ofthis work in contrast with other material that deprecates baptism in favor of chrismand especially the bridal chamber.23Sin in Valentinianism,95–96; “Baptism in Valentinianism,” 18."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Ritual in Gnosticism101does not actualize the resurrection by receiving the bridal chamber here inthis realm, one will not be able to receive it in the other place (86,5–7).Truth does not appear naked but in sacramental types and images(67,9–11). Each sacrament effects union by overcoming separation; bymeans of baptism, Eucharist, or resurrection, Christ’s soteriological functionis to overcome the original separation of woman from man, whose sepa-ration results in death (70,11–16), but whose reunification is effected onlythrough enacting sacraments in this world. To receive a sacrament trans-forms one from a Christian into a Christ (67,27–27; cf. Augustine, Homilyon John21.8: non solum nos christianos factos esse, sed Christum).In agreement with the Gospel of Philip,the liturgical supplements to AValentinian Exposition(esp. 41,21–38) clearly distinguish a second baptismdiffering from the ordinary Christian baptism, though it does not describeit. Like the Gospel of Philip, A Valentinian Expositionunderstands the firstbaptism as the forgiveness of sins, but whose effect seems to be the sameas the “redemption” or second baptism described in patristic sources: itelevates the recipient out of the world into the aeon. In both treatises thefirst baptism seems to be connected with an anointing and a Eucharist,although the significance of the latter seems to be attenuated. In the Gospelof Philip,which seems to refer to the rites of redemption and bridal cham-ber as a sort of second baptism, the chrism becomes the central part of thebaptismal rite, overshadowing the eucharist altogether.Just as the treatise Zostrianosportrays Sethian practice of visionaryascent as a series of baptisms, washings, and sealings, the Gospel of Philip(69,4–14) draws an explicit connection not only between vision and bap-tism, but also vision and the chrism, and further associates both withrebirth and the restoration to the condition of the primal androgyne:“Through the holy spirit we are indeed begotten again, but we are begot-ten through Christ in the two. We are anointed through the spirit. Whenwe were begotten we were united. None can see himself either in wateror in a mirror without light. Nor again can you see in light without wateror mirror. For this reason it is fitting to baptize in the two, in the light andthe water. Now the light is the chrism.” For the Gospel of Philip,sacramentsoccasion an assimilation of the participant to the nature of the participated:61 20It is not possible 21for anyone to see anything of the things thatactually exist 22unless he becomes like 23them. This is not the way withman 24in the world: he sees the sun without being a sun; 25and he seesthe heaven and the earth and 26all other things, but he is not thesethings. 27This is quite in keeping with the truth. But you (sg.) saw 28something of that place, and you became 29those things. You saw thespirit, you 30became spirit. You saw Christ, you became 31Christ.

Other Testimony concerning Gnostic BaptismMany other gnostic groups practiced baptism. According to Irenaeus(Haer.1.23.5), Menander’s disciples were baptized into his own name,receiving resurrection in the form of agelessness and physical immortality.According to Clement of Alexandria (Strom.1.21.146.1–4), the disciples ofBasilides calculated the date of Jesus’ baptism, which they celebrated on thefifteenth of Tybi (January 6) by spending the previous night in Scripturereadings; it is possible that this sect witnesses the first known instance of a365-day lectionary year that began with the Epiphany celebration of Jesus’baptismal enlightenment (fwtismov\") at the Jordan.24The Naasenes (Hip-polytus, Ref.5.7.19; 5.7.40; 5.9.18) understood baptism as a spiritual birth(“from water and the spirit,” John 3:5) and entrance into immortalitythrough Jesus the “true gate” (cf. John 10:9); it included washing in “livingwater” (the water above the firmament) and an anointing from a horn “atthe third gate.”25The gnostic Justin’s book of Baruch(apud Hippolytus Ref.5.27.1–4) distinguishes between the water below the firmament belongingto the evil creation and the springing well of living water above the firma-ment belonging to the Good one; only pneumatic persons drink of—that iswash in—the latter, while the psychic and material wash in the former. Herethe sapiential metaphor of drinking from the water of wisdom is interpretedas baptism,26yet one notes again the strong distinction between ordinaryChristian baptism and pneumatic baptism as expressed in the dual baptismof the Valentinians and the harsh polemic against water baptism in theApocalypse of Adam(NHC V 84,4–85,30; cf. Zost.NHC VIII 131,2–5). In the102John D. Turner24See D. Vigne, “Enquête sur Basilide,” in Recherches et Tradition: Mélangespatistriques offerts à Henri Crouzel, S.J.(ed. A. Dupleix; ThH 88, Paris: Beauchesne,1992), 285–313. Basilidean Christology is based, not on the passion, but the bap-tism of Jesus; according to Hippolytus (Ref.7.26.8–10), the third Sonship receivesthe light from the Holy Spirit descending with a fragrant ointment like a bird fromthe Ogdoad at the time of his baptism, which Hippolytus misinterprets as the com-ing of the Spirit on Mary at the time of Jesus’ birth (a similar confusion appears inthe Apocalypse of Adam).25Perhaps an allusion to the eastern gate of the heavenly temple through whichthe glory of the Lord entered, as envisioned in Ezek 43:1–5.26The Hermetica (Corp. herm.4.3–6, “The Cup”) interprets the receipt of Gno-sis as a baptism in the “cup” of intellect (nou'\") reserved only for a few, who byimmersing themselves become perfect men, able to see the Good, despise thebody, and hasten upward to the One."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"second Book of Jeu(chs. 45–52) one finds a most elaborate baptismal ritethat affords entry into the Treasury of Light. In a ritual setting featuring atable set with bread, pitchers of wine and water, herbs, and incense, the dis-ciples of Jesus don linen robes and myrtle crowns to receive a sequence ofthree baptisms (in living water, fire, and the Holy Spirit) in which theyacquire certain ciphers and names as “seals” allowing them to ascendthrough the aeons. Unfortunately, the manuscript ends before Jesus revealsthe great “mystery of the forgiveness of sins” required for ultimate entranceinto the Treasury of Light.Simonian Gnosticism illustrates the central role of the ritual recoveryof the androgynous image (here called the undifferentiated “root” power,Hippolytus, Ref.6.18.2; 6.18.4). The separation and reunion of the maleand female elements in humankind underlies the legend of Simon and hisconsort Helen, which was already known before the time of Justin Mar-tyr.27The later Apophasis Megalequoted by Hippolytus (Ref.6.17.1) sug-gests that it may have taken the form of a baptismal ritual:According to Simon, then, that blessed and incorruptible being lies hid-den in every being potentially [duvnamei], not actually [ejnergeiva/]; that is hewho stands, took his stand, and will stand [oJ eJstwv\", stav\", sthsovmeno\"]:who stands on high in the unbegotten power, who took his stand belowin the chaos of waters when he was begotten in an image [eijkwvn], whowill stand on high with the blessed infinite power if he be fully formed[ejxeikonivsqh/]. For, he says, there are three that stand, and without therebeing three that stand, the [un]originate being, who (they say) hovers overthe water [cf. 6.14.4], is not set in order, the perfect heavenly being whois recreated according to the likeness, who becomes in no respect infe-rior to the unoriginate power. This is the meaning of their saying, “I andthou are one, thou art before me, and I am after thee.” This, he says, isone power, divided as being above (as infinite) and below [as lovgo\"?],self-generating,...its own mother, its own father, its own sister, its ownconsort, its own daughter, its own son,...unity, the root of all things.Being (re)-formed in the image, equated with “being begotten” and occur-ring “in the stream of waters,” suggests a cultic act like baptism, as in Exc.68: “As long as we were children of the female only, as of a dishonorableunion, we were incomplete, childish, without understanding, weak, andwithout form, brought forth like abortions, in short, we were children ofRitual in Gnosticism10327See E. Haenchen, “Gab es eine vorchristliche Gnosis?” in Gott und Mensch:Gesammelte Aufsätze(Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1965), 289–91, 297–98; contra K.Beyschlag, “Zur Simon-Magus-Frage,” ZTK68 (1971): 395–426; and R.

But having been given form (morfwqevnta\") bythe Savior, we are the children of the man (husband) and of the bride-chamber.”28 In fact, Hippolytus (Ref.6.19.5) says the Simonians called a riteof apparent sexual promiscuity in imitation of Simon (and Helen) “the holyof holies,” the same metaphor used for the rite of the bridal chamber inGos. Phil.69,14–70,4. It therefore likely that the Simonians possessed ritu-als analogous to the Valentinian baptism and bridal chamber, which mightaccount for the report in Pseudo-Clement (Homilies2.23–24) that Simonwas a disciple of John the Baptist.A striking parallel to the Simonian legend is the myth of the soul’sabuse, transformation, and joining to her heavenly “bridegroom” found inthe Nag Hammadi treatise the Exegesis on the Soul,which seems to haveSimonian affinities. It regards what seems to be the vehicle of the soul asits womb, surrounding it as a dirty and polluted garment (cf. esp. NHC II131,13–132,2). The restoration of the soul’s former nature, which it pos-sessed before it had fallen into the body and prostituted itself to the mate-rialistic life, is called the baptism of the soul; the “womb of the soul” is onthe outside like male genitals until purified by baptism, when it is “turnedinward” to regain the freshness of its former nature.29Among the Sethians, Simonians, and especially the Valentinians, thesacramental means of restoring the androgynous wholeness of the innerperson through ritual acts centered on baptism presupposes a cultic com-munity with a strong sense of corporate identity. In other gnostic circles,however, the same quest and its mythical justification could be focused104John D. Turner28According to Meeks, “The Image of the Androgyne,” 191–93, the primary allu-sion is the anthropogony of Gen 1, but in the clause, “if he be fully formed [eja;nejxeikonivsqai],” the verb (ejx)eikonivzesqai(be “iconized”) appears to be a technicalterm in the Megale Apophasis,equivalent to “to become perfect” (genovmeno\" tevle-sio\", Ref.6.18.1).29Meeks, “The Image of the Androgyne,” 193–94, connects this peculiar similewith the metaphor of making “the inner like the outer” in Gos. Thom.22: “Whenyou make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and theouter like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male andfemale into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female befemale, when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a footin place of a foot, an image in place of an image, then you will enter [the king-dom].” Variant forms of this saying occur in Clement of Alexandria Strom.3.13.92(citing the Gospel of the Egyptiansand Julius Cassianus), 2 Clem.12.2, and, withoutmention of male and female, Acts Pet.38 and Acts Phil.140. Meeks also cites logion106, “When you make the two one, you shall become sons of man”; logion 11, “Onthe day when you were one, you became two. But when you have become two,what will you do?” and logion 4, “Many who are first shall become last and theyshall become a single one.”"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"exclusively upon a subjective transformation of consciousness leadingaway from sect-formation and toward a radical isolation of the individual.Within Sethianism, the exclusive concentration on the singular experienceof an individual visionary like Allogenes or Zostrianos or Marsanes in thePlatonizing Sethian treatises might lend itself to such a development,although the Three Steles of Seth,apart from Seth’s initial praise of his fatherGeradamas, is explicitly cast in the first person plural as a communal exer-cise in contemplative ascent.The trend towards individual isolation is evident in the Gospel ofThomasand in the encratite Christianity of eastern Syria, where most schol-ars locate the Thomas tradition. The theme of “making the two one” in theGospel of Thomaslikely derives from baptismal liturgies, particularly Syrianones.30But its ideal of “singleness,” expressed in the Coptic oua ouwtor the Greek monacov\", signifies celibacy and isolation from society. Indeed,the Nag Hammadi Testimony of Truth(esp. IX 69,8–24) specifies that truebaptism is the renunciation of the world, rather than a ritual sealing of oneentering the faith administered by the (defiled!) fathers of the world: theSon of Man baptized no disciples.1.4. Jesus’ Inaugural Baptism As a Paradigm for Visionary EnlightenmentThe baptismal lore of many of the foregoing groups, especially theSethians and those associated with Valentinus and Basilides, make a gooddeal out of the traditions of Jesus’ inaugural baptism.31Within the NT,Ritual in Gnosticism10530J. Z. Smith, “The Garments of Shame,” HR5 (1965): 217–38, shows that themain elements of logion 37, undressing, being naked without shame, treadingupon the garments, and being as little children, all point to an origin of this saying“within archaic Christian baptismal practices and attendant interpretation of Gene-sis 1–3” (218).31In Mark 1 par. Jesus is baptized in the Jordan by John, and, coming out of thewater, he sees the heavens opened and the spirit of God descending upon him andhears the heavenly voice pronounce him as Son of God. The parallel in Matthewagrees but has reservations about Jesus’ submission to John’s baptism. The FourthGospel, like Luke, suppresses Jesus’ explicit baptism by John and furthermoredemotes John to a mere voice of one crying in the wilderness, whose only subse-quent function is to bear witness to the descent of the Spirit upon Jesus (cf. Hera-cleon frg. 5, apud Origen Comm. Jo.6.20–21). Rather than being the subject ofJohn’s water baptism, the Fourth Gospel (John 4:7–15) understands Jesus as thesource of Living Water, which to drink means eternal life; although he has baptizedJudean people in water (3:22; 4:1), there will be a time when he will baptize withthe Holy Spirit, which the author identifies with living water (John 7:37–39). In John3:3–5, rebirth as a condition of seeing the kingdom is equated with being born ofwater and spirit; one thus reborn through baptism is uniquely empowered to “see”the Kingdom. While the obvious reference seems to be to Johannine Christians, the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"visionary experience is connected not only with heavenly ascensions butalso with baptism, especially the inaugural baptism of Jesus; outside theNT, it is also connected with the manifestation of light (e.g., frg. 4 of theGospel of the Ebionites;Epiphanius Pan.30.13.7; Justin Dial.88.3 [fire]).The widespread attestation of this phenomenon suggests that the feast ofEpiphany originally celebrated the incarnation in context of Jesus’ baptismrather than his virginal birth; unlike the passion, this was an event thatcould be shared by almost all Christians, including gnostic Christians.As we have seen, with its awesome associations with death and rebirth,baptism becomes a principal occasion for visionary experience. A notableinstance is the baptismal vision of King Gundaphorus in the Acts of Thomas.According to the Syriac version (20), when the baptismal party enters thebathhouse, Jesus appears, but only his voice was heard “since they had notyet been baptized.” After the initial anointing, the invocation of the Nameand the Spirit, and baptism proper, as the participants were emerging fromthe water, there appeared a luminous youth carrying a blazing torch whoselight overpowers the illumination afforded by the many oil lamps illuminat-ing the proceedings. The Greek version (26–27) does not explicitly mentionthe baptism proper: during the night, before the anointing and baptism ofGundaphorus, the participants received an audition from the Lord, but not avision, “not having received the added sealing of the seal.” When Gun-daphorus receives the chrism in oil, Christ, the Holy Spirit, Wisdom, and thefive rational faculties are invoked, whereupon the Lord appears briefly as aluminous youth with a burning torch. In both versions, upon daybreak, afterthe candidate was again clothed, the apostle celebrated the Eucharist. TheSyriac version makes it clear that the occasion was the nocturnal baptism ofGundaphorus and that the audition came prior to baptism, while the visionof the Lord occurred immediately upon their emergence from the water.32106John D. TurnerFourth Gospel’s lack of explicit accounts of Jesus’ birth and baptism on the earthlyplane combine with this conception of being born from above as an additional ref-erence to the untraceable—and thus divine—origin of the Savior who brings lightinto the world. The parallel with the explanation of the origins of the Illuminatorin the Apocalypse of Adamis obvious. Like the Johannine Gospel’s conception ofJesus as the one who will provide living water, the Trimorphic Protennoiaregardsthe Logos who descends with the Five Seals as the one who pours forth LivingWater upon the Spirit below out of its source, which is the Father/Voice aspect ofProtennoia, called the unpolluted spring of Living Water. Perhaps it would not begoing too far to suppose that Johannine and Sethian conceptions of baptism had acommon origin.32E. Peterson, “Einige Bemerkungen zum Hamburger Papyrus-Fragment derActa Pauli,” in Frühkirche, Judentum und Gnosis(Rome: Herder, 1959), 194–96,collects numerous texts recounting epiphanies of Jesus at baptism in the form of apaidivon, neanivsko\", or the like."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"2. InvestitureInvestiture typically follows upon naked baptism. The metaphor ofreplacing an old garment with a new one, which occurs repeatedly in gnos-tic baptismal contexts, can signify several religious acts: a shift from a life ofvice to one of virtue, religious conversion, a change of life-style, and initia-tion, where it signifies the death and rebirth of the initiate and assimilationof divine power.33In baptismal contexts, the garment that is discarded (cf.the “garments of skin,” Gen 3:21) signifies the physical body, while donningthe “robe of light” signifies the restoration of the lost image of God.34The“Paraphrase of Seth,” which Hippolytus (Ref.5.19.22) attributes to the Sethi-ans, understands baptism as washing in and drinking from a cup of living,springing water by which the believer, like the Savior, puts on the form of aservant, escapes earthy ties, and is reclothed with a heavenly garment.The Trimorphic Protennoiaalso applies the motif of putting on gar-ments to the Savior’s salvific descent. On her third descent as the divineLogos, when Protennoia reveals herself to her members in human likeness(“in their tents,” NHC XIII 47,13–25; cf. John 1:9–14), she makes herselfinvisible to and unrecognized by all the celestial powers by wearing their“garments” until she reveals herself to her brethren by conferring the FiveSeals. Similarly in the Gospel of the Egyptians(NHC III 63,23–64,3), Pronoiacauses Seth to establish the holy baptism of the Five Seals through a “logos-begotten” body, Jesus the living one, whom Seth put on. To be comparedis the depiction of the descent of the initially unrecognized Logos in theJohannine prologue, which may have arisen in a baptismal context.Likewise, in the Second Treatise of the Great Seth(NHC VII 56,20–59,18), the revealer undergoes an incognito descent (changing his likenessRitual in Gnosticism10733Meeks (“Image of the Androgyne,” 184) cites examples; behavioral change:Col 3:8; Eph 4:17–24; Philo Somn.1.224–25; Acts Thom.58; Teachings of Silvanus(NHC VII,4105,13–17), T.

Smith, “The Gar-ments of Shame,” 224–30."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"at each cosmic level), his “third baptism in a revealed image,” in whichhe appears in the form of Jesus in order to defeat the cosmic powersthrough their ignorant attempt to crucify him. The Docetics (according toHippolytus Ref.8.10.6–8) considered Jesus to have two bodies, his fleshlybody acquired through his human parent Mary, and another body,received at his baptism in the Jordan as the type of the former; the for-mer body was nailed to the cross, deceiving the archons and powers, yethis nakedness was covered by his baptismal body, perhaps to be under-stood as an ethereal garment or subtle body rather like the vehicle(o[chma) of the soul. Even the Gospel of Truth(NHC I 20,28–28), whichproclaims that Jesus, although clothed with eternal life, died on the cross,states that he nevertheless stripped himself of the “perishable rags,” puton imperishability, and ascended to heaven, invulnerable to the powersstripped naked by forgetfulness.Putting on clothes appropriate to the cosmic level one occupies so asto make one invulnerable or invisible to the powers applies not only to thedescending revealer, but also to an enlightened being as it ascends into theaeonic world. A fine example is the royal garment sent to the revealer inthe “Hymn of the Pearl” (Acts Thom.108–13). The new garment is often soluminous and brilliant that it blinds the cosmic powers that oppose thesoul’s ascent (Pistis Sophiach. 59 [p. 74 Schmidt]). According to the Gospelof Philip(NHC II 58,15–16; 70,5–9; 76,22–28), in the union of the bridalchamber, one sacramentally acquires a garment of light that makes oneinvisible to the hostile powers; unlike earthly garments, such heavenly gar-ments put on “by water and fire” (baptism and chrism) are better than thosewho put them on (57,19–23). In Allogenes(NHC XI 50,10–34; 58,26–37), themetaphor of changing clothes is applied to Allogenes’ ecstatic removal fromthe fleshly (and psychic?) garment of ignorance and investiture with a “greatpower,” enabling him to know things unknown to the multitude and obtaina vision of the Luminaries of the Aeon of Barbelo. A non-Sethian exampleof stripping and reclothing in the context of an ascent is offered by theAuthoritative Teaching(NHC VI 31,24–64,3), where the soul, come to hersenses, strips off this world, replacing it with her true garment, her bridalclothing, in which she enters the fold and unites with her true shepherd.Alongside the metaphor of being invested with a new garment, onesometimes finds the royal image of being crowned. In Zostrianos(NHCVIII 129,12–16; cf. 57,13–24), when Zostrianos descends from the Kalyptosthe Protophanes level in the Aeon of Barbelo, he joins “those who are uni-fied,” blesses the higher powers, becomes pantevleio\", is written in glory,sealed, and receives a perfect crown. In chapters 11 and 12 of the untitledtext of the Bruce Codex, Setheus, by means of a lovgo\" dhmiourgikov\"(i.e.,Christ), sends forth ray-emitting crowns, which are awarded to believers;they are crowned with a seal of glory on the right and a triple-powered108John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"fount (phghv) in their midst. In a nonritual context, the royal image ofinvestiture, coronation, and enthronement occur side-by-side in the Teach-ings of Silvanus(NHC VII 87,11–13; 89,10–34; 112,10–27), where one isurged to put on the shining robe of wisdom and holy teaching, the crownof Paideia, and sit on the throne of perception; those who contend wellwill gain dominion, unlike the fools, who are invested with folly, crownedwith ignorance, and sit on the throne of nescience.3. Chrismation3.1. The SethiansAlthough the Sethians do not appear to have had a ritual of chrisma-tion, they used the term as a metaphor in two basic contexts. The first isthat of the anointing of the third member of the Sethian Trinity of Father,Mother, and Son with the “goodness” (crhstiva, a pun on cristov\"andcrivsma) of the Father, the Invisible Spirit immediately after his conceptionby the Mother Barbelo, found in the Apocryphon of John(NHC II 6,23–26and parallels), the Gospel of the Egyptians(NHC III 44,22–24), and the Tri-morphic Protennoia(NHC XIII 37,30–35). This is probably based on aninterpretation of the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ baptism, when he is estab-lished as Son of God. The second occurs in the conclusion of Eleleth’s rev-elation to Norea, wife-sister of Seth in the Hypostasis of the Archons(NHCII 97,1–5), where it is promised that the Father will send the “true man,”probably Seth, within three generations to anoint the souls of his progeny,the undominated generation, with the unction of eternal life.3.2. Valentinian ChrismationThe relation of the Valentinian chrism to the baptismal rite has beendiscussed above. The Gospel of Philip(NHC II 57,22–28; 67,2–9; 69,5–14;78,1–10; 85,21–86,18) understands the chrism as fire, in the sense ofintense light that gives form and beauty. One is begotten again (reborn) bybaptism in water and anointing with the chrism through the Holy Spirit asa sort of “baptism” in light. It seems that this is the same light that is kin-dled in the bridal chamber. The doxology appended to A ValentinianExposition(NHC XI,2a40,1–29) refers to the Valentinian rite of anointing,which was performed either before the first baptism or simultaneously withit, enabling the recipient to overcome the power of the devil, who domi-nates the flesh and struggles against God.Marcus (Irenaeus Haer.1.21.5) also practiced a rite of unction by pour-ing ointment or a mixture of water and oil of balsam upon the heads ofhis flock, which had the effect of making one invulnerable to the powersand authorities, allowing the inner person to ascend to the invisible bysloughing off the soul (to be delivered to the Demiurge) and the body (toRitual in Gnosticism109"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"be left behind on earth). Evidently some Valentinians perform the unctionin connection with baptism, while others claim that going to the water isunnecessary. Irenaeus calls this casting away of the chain of the soul theredemption. Epiphanius (Pan.36.2.4–8) adds that the followers of Hera-cleon perform this unction upon the dying so that the “inner man” of thosewho receive it will become invisible to and untouchable by the principal-ities and authorities on high as they ascend, leaving the body on earth andconsigning the soul to the Demiurge. The inner man, a son of the preexis-tent Father, appeals to the motherless mother Sophia, the mother ofAchamoth, as its source, while the inferior powers and the Demiurge knownothing higher than Achamoth, a female created from a female.4. Sacral Meal4.1. The Valentinian EucharistIn the Gospel of Philip(NHC II 75,15–24), it is said that the eucharisticcup of water and wine contains the Holy Spirit; to drink it conveys the per-fect man; in 53,21–24, the Eucharist is identified with the crucified Jesus(who brought bread from heaven, II 55,6–15), which may explain why thisrite seems underplayed in the Gospel of Philip(e.g., II 74,1–2). In the actof baptism, the living water is a body that replaces the body stripped offin the act of prebaptismal disrobing.The Valentinian Marcus (Irenaeus Haer.1.13.1–5) celebrated a Eucharistwith a cup mixed with a wine that was understood to be the purple and redblood of Grace and was repeatedly administered in large doses to wealthywomen, making them deranged. Moreover, Marcus is said to have proclaimedhimself to be this Grace as well as the bridegroom whose luminous seed awoman, as bride, is to receive “in her bridal chamber” in order to entertogether with him into the One. Women are induced to acts of prophecy bybeing allowed to babble nonsense spontaneously, supposedly repaying thisgift of prophecy by granting their possessions and bodies to Marcus.4.2. Other Instances of the Eucharist: Ophites, Carpocratians, and BorboritesEpiphanius (Pan.37.5.6–7) describes a curious ritual meal practiced bythe Ophites in which they worship a snake (Irenaeus says they identifiedthe paradisical snake with the devil!) as a royal source of knowledge byoffering it bread:For they have an actual snake, and keep it in a sort of basket. When it istime for their mysteries they bring it out of the den, spread loaves aroundon a table, and call the snake to come; and when the den is opened itcomes out. And then the snake . . . crawls onto the table and coils up onthe loaves. And this is what they call a perfect sacrifice. And so, someonehas told me, not only do they break the loaves the snake has coiled on110John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"and distribute them to the recipients, but they each kiss the snake besides. . . and they offer a hymn to the Father on high-again, as they say,through the snake—and so conclude their mysteries.Finally, Clement of Alexandria (Strom.3.2.10.1) reports that the Car-pocratians celebrate an apparently nocturnal common meal that he callsa “love feast,” after which they extinguish the lamps and command thewomen present to engage in sexual intercourse as a divine duty. Epipha-nius reports similar activity on the part of the Borborites, whom he con-nects with the Sethians (see below on sexual sacramentalism); inparticular, he mentions two communal meals of theirs: a Eucharist con-sisting of offering up and consuming menstrual blood and spent semenwithheld from intercourse as the blood and body of Christ, and a Passovermeal devoted to the consumption of a mangled fetus extracted from anywoman who accidentally happens to become pregnant during such sex-ual exchange (Pan.26.4.5–5.6).5. Sacral MarriageThe metaphor of marriage and the bridal chamber in gnostic usage canrefer both to the experience of spiritual reunification as well as to overtlysexual union. In either case, the underlying myth is that of the re-creationof the primal androgyne through the union of male and female, whetherthat be taken as man and woman, intellect and soul, or the earthly seed andits angelic counterpart. As enlightened beings, the gnostics generally con-sidered themselves alone capable of understanding the true significance ofsexual union, considering the nongnostic as worldly and animalistic, expe-riencing not love, but only lust: “A bridal chamber is not for the animals,nor is it for the slaves, nor for defiled women; but it is for free men and vir-gins” (Gospel of PhilipNHC II 69,1–3; cf. Irenaeus Haer. 1.6.3; Clement ofAlexandrai Exc.68). While the question of gnostic sexual practices will bediscussed under the heading of sexual sacramentalism, here I want to com-ment on its use as a metaphor for spiritual unification.35The application of the concept of human marriage to the achievementof unity with a transcendent reality is frequent in classical Judaism, whereGod is the husband of his bride Israel; the metaphor of marriage alsoappears in the NT, not only where Jesus refers to himself as the bride-groom, but especially in the Pauline corpus (1 Cor 6:15–17; 2 Cor 11:1–2;Eph 5:22–23) as a symbol for the relation of Christ and the church.Although Christian gnostics likewise draw on these biblical concepts,Ritual in Gnosticism11135See especially J.-M. Sevrin, “Les noces spiritualles dans l’Evangile selonPhilippe,” Museon87 (1974): 143–93."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"uppermost in their minds as well as those of Jewish gnostics was thenotion of the primordial unity of humankind as expressed in Gen 1:26–27,according to which Adam was created as a single masculo-feminine beingin the image of God.The primordial sin or fault underlying human existence that had to beovercome was the creator’s ignorant act of separating this originallyandrogynous into separate male and female persons. In the act of physi-cal union, the offspring was thought to receive the human form from themale, while its physical and emotional essence was provided by thefemale. The same held for the spiritual world as well; spiritual perfectionlay in androgyny, so when a spiritual being such as Sophia undertakes toproduce offspring without a male consort, the result is defective, a form-less abortion lacking the male element of form. This being the characterof her offspring, both her son, creator of the natural world, and his cos-mic product are likewise defective. The rectification of the creationdepends on introducing into it a potential source of its reunification.The Sethian myth conceives this to be accomplished when the imageof God (Adamas), the original human androgyne, is primordially projectedas the archetype upon which the creator unwittingly bases his own humancopy. Once he realizes that his androgynous copy is superior to him, hesplits it into male and female, but it is too late. In spite of the creator’sattempts to subvert the primal couple, by reuniting themselves they cannow re-create their original androgyny, which they do in the birth of Seth,the “other seed.” Like the divine Adamas, he is a true (“triple,” i.e., androg-ynous) male Child, as is the “immovable race” he engenders.While a few gnostic groups such as the late Sethian Borborites soughtto replicate this primeval union through nonreproductive sexual union,most, like the earlier Sethians, eschewed sexual union, which they consid-ered to typify the adulterous race of Cain. One might therefore effect asymbolic union on the transcendent plane through ritual means, the Sethi-ans through baptismal ascension, and the Valentinians by an eschatologi-cal sacred marriage, the bridal chamber.36In the latter act, recourse washad not only to the myth of the primal androgyne and the NT notions ofthe marriage of Christ and the church, but also to Neopythagorean specu-lation on the properties of unity.37112John D. Turner36The Sethians effected the return to androgyny by stripping away the “psychicand corporeal thought” in the acts of baptism and contemplative ascent, by whichthey could “flee from the madness and the bondage of femaleness and choose thesalvation of maleness” (Zost.NHC VIII,1131,5–8).37Even quantities could always be divided in such a way as to leave a space inthe middle capable of receiving an extra member (x x), while the division of oddquantities always left over precisely such a single member in the middle (x x x)."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"In the Valentinian view, having abandoned her male consort, Sophia’sultimate human offspring from Adam and Eve onward, both males andfemales, were regarded as weak female seed lacking the element of form,which could only be restored by an ascent to the Pleroma and marriagewith the male angels that the savior had prepared for them. In this waythey could eternally enjoy the harmonious syzygetic union experienced byall the undescended aeons there. As in the metaphysics of the Platonic psy-chology of the individual, every human was a split personality. One’shigher rational, active—and thus masculine—aspect of the self had beenprimordially sundered from one’s emotional, passional, receptive, and thusessentially feminine aspect of the self. The natural link with the divineworld, the intellect or highest part of the soul was still resident in the tran-scendent world, although cut off from the soul and body now that formedone’s link with the everyday physical world. The goal of life was thereforeto recover this lost unity, which would involve detaching a soul overlyenamored of its bodily vehicle from the body, or detaching the rationalpart of the soul from its irrational and impassioned psychic vehicle, so asto effect its reunion with the higher intelligence.For the gnostics who appropriated such views, the reunion of the psychewith one’s intellect was thus tantamount to coming together in an act of mar-riage, whether enacted through contemplative union, symbolic rites, or actualphysical union. The following Valentinian citations make the point clear:As long as we were children of the female only, as of a dishonorable union,we were incomplete, childish, without understanding, weak, and withoutform, brought forth like abortions, in short, we were children of the woman.But having been given form by the Savior, we are the children of the man(husband) and of the bride-chamber. (Clement of Alexandria Exc.68)If the woman had not separated from the man, she would not die withthe man. His separation became the beginning of death. Because of thisChrist came to repair the separation which was from the beginning andagain unite the two, and to give life to those who died as a result of theseparation and unite them. But the woman is united to her husband inthe bridal chamber. Indeed those who have united in the bridal chamberwill no longer be separated. Thus Eve separated from Adam because itwas not in the bridal chamber that she united with him. (Gospel of PhilipNHC II 70,9–22)Ritual in Gnosticism113The number one, being indivisible, was thought to embrace both these propertiesand thus was androgynous, while even quantities were female and odd quantitieswere male. Thus the unity of the One could best be approximated by the union ofmale and female. In the ideal realm of the Pleroma, all spiritual beings dwelt in theform of syzygetic pairs."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"In the Exegesis on the Soul(NHC II 132,2–133,9), which seems to have cer-tain Simonian affinities, the restoration of the helpless female soul wallow-ing apart from her spiritual home in the brothels of materiality is effected bythe advent of the marriage of the female soul with her intellectual masculinecounterpart, her true husband. The reunification of the irrational, passionateaspect of the soul with her celestial, intellectual component as her true hus-band and master, from whom physical embodiment has separated her, isinterpreted as a reversal of the primordial separation of Eve from Adam inthe garden of Eden: “They will become a single flesh” (Gen 2:24; 3:16; cf. 1 Cor 6:15; 11:1; Eph 5:23). The Testimony of Truth(NHC IX 31,24–32,16;34,32–35,23), which also seems to have certain Simonian affinities, likewiseuses the imagery of the soul as the bride who strips off this world and learnsfrom the evangelists about the inscrutable One, adorning herself for this hertrue shepherd with her bridal clothing “in beauty of mind,” whereupon:She found her rising. She came to rest in him who is at rest. She reclinedin the bride-chamber. She ate of the banquet for which she had hungered.She partook of the immortal food. She found what she had sought after.She received rest from her labors. (NHC IX 35,8–16)The image of entrance into the bridal chamber and receipt of the new,imperishable wedding robe occurs also in the Second Treatise of the GreatSeth(NHC VII 57,7–58,4) as a metaphor for the soul’s receipt of Intellectand entry into the heavens. It is called a “mystery” effected by therevealer’s incognito descent (changing his likeness at each cosmic level),his “third baptism in a revealed image,” to defeat the cosmic powersthrough the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus.5.1. The Valentinian Mystery of the Bridal ChamberOf course, it was the Valentinians who made the most extensive useof the metaphor of marriage as a designation for the eschatological reunionof the Savior Jesus with Sophia and of her spiritual seed with the maleangels of the Savior:38When the whole seed is perfected, then, they say, will the mother,Achamoth leave the place of the Middle, enter into the Pleroma, andreceive her bridegroom, the Savior, who came into being from all (theaeons), with the result that the Savior and Sophia, who is Achamoth, forma pair (syzygy). These then are said to be bridegroom and bride, but thebridal chamber is the entire Pleroma. The spiritual beings will divestthemselves of their souls and become intelligent spirits, and, without114John D. Turner38See R. M. Grant, “The Mystery of Marriage in the Gospel of Philip,” VC15(1969): 129–40."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"being hindered or seen, they will enter into the Pleroma, and will bebestowed as brides on the angels around the Savior. The Demiurge passesinto the place of his mother Sophia, that is, into the Middle. The souls ofthe righteous will also repose in the place of the Middle, for nothing psy-chic enters the Pleroma. When this has taken place, then (they assert) thefire that is hidden in the world will blaze forth and burn: when it has con-sumed all matter it will be consumed with it and pass into non-existence.According to them the Demiurge knew none of these things before theadvent of the Savior. (Ptolemaeus apud Irenaeus Haer.1.1.7.1; cf. Clementof Alexandria Exc.63–65)The Savior and Sophia are interpreted as the bridegroom and bride, andthe place of their union is the “bridal chamber,” the divine realm of thePleroma of spiritual aeons. Thus the Pauline metaphors of the church asbride and Christ as bridegroom are combined with the story of the fall andrestoration of Wisdom, the cosmic soul, and the restoration of the individ-ual psychic beings created by her. As Christians, the Valentinians main-tained the Christian rites of baptism, Eucharist, and the chrism but seem tohave developed their own ritual enactment of their expected eschatologi-cal marriage to their celestial angelic counterparts.In Haer.1.13.1–21.5, Irenaeus describes some of the Valentinian ritu-als known to him. In so doing he polemically contrasts the disagreementamong the gnostics with the supposed unified practice of his own church.They include a mystic rite with certain invocations designed to effect aspiritual marriage, mirroring the syzygetic union of the pleromatic aeons,in a bridal chamber prepared beforehand. Others perform a water baptismin the name of the Father of All, Truth the Mother of All, and the Christwho descended on Jesus. Some utilize Hebrew invocations of Achamothto effect redemption as a communion with the pleromatic powers, and oth-ers replace this with a “redemption” in which a mixture of oil and water ispoured on the head with certain invocations. Some boast an angelicredemption or restitution (ajpokatavstasi\") featuring an anointing with bal-sam oil in the names of Iao (Yahu) and Jesus of Nazareth that frees one’ssoul from the powers of this age. Still others, he says, reject all such tan-gible symbolic acts involving the body or soul which derive from defi-ciency, claiming that the true redemption occurs only through inner,spiritual man’s knowledge of the ineffable Greatness.In the Nag Hammadi corpus, the Tripartite Tractate(NHC I 122,12)portrays the Pleroma as the bridal chamber in which the elect spiritualbeings will experience ultimate restoration as the bride of the Savior, whilethose “called” psychic humans, the “men of the church,” will serve as atten-dants outside the Pleroma in the aeon of “images,” until they receiveinstruction, upon which all will receive the restoration together; in Ire-naeus’s account of the Ptolemaic theology (Haer.1.7.1), the lower Sophia,Ritual in Gnosticism115"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Achamoth, enters the Pleroma or bridal chamber as the bride of the Sav-ior, while the spiritual ones put off their souls, enter the Pleroma and unitewith the Savior’s angels. In the Tripartite Tractate(NHC I 128,30), thebridal chamber is also identified with baptism, as another expression of theagreement and indivisible union of the knower (the Valentinian gnostic)with the known (the Savior).In the Gospel of Philip,the sacral marriage has multiple symbolic refer-ents. The fundamental mythical motif of the restoration of the broken unityof Adam is still present (NHC II 68,22–26; 70,9–22), but, as in the introduc-tory quote from Irenaeus, the biblical legend is now overshadowed bytheogonic myths of the Valentinian school. The sacramental union in thebridal chamber has its archetype in the union of the Savior with the previ-ously barren Sophia. According to II 71,3–15, the body of Jesus the Saviorwas produced in the pleromatic bridal chamber from the union of theFather of the All with the “virgin who came down,” presumably the higherSophia before her fall from the Pleroma; from this origin, it descended toestablish this union of bride and bridegroom as the way for his true disci-ples to enter into his pleromatic rest.39This union is perhaps representedon another level by the legends of Christ’s association with Mary Magda-lene40and its fulfillment in the eschatological union of the gnostic’s true self(the female bride, or “seed,” or eijkwvn) with its corresponding male “angel”as bridegroom (II 58,10–14; 65,23–25). According to the Gospel of Philip(II86,1–18), becoming a son of the bridal chamber is the only means to receivethe light. Although in this world it is present only as an image of the truth,this light grants absolute imperturbability throughout the rest of this life asthough he were already living in the Pleroma. The theme of restoration ofman’s primeval unity is thereby projected onto the macrocosmic plane,where it symbolizes the reintegration of the Pleroma to its precosmic state.116John D. Turner39Gos. Phil.63,30–32; cf. Irenaeus Haer.1.1–8; Clement of Alexandria Exc.43–65; H.-M. Schenke [and Johannes Leipoldt], “Koptisch-gnostiche Schriften ausden Papyrus-Codices von Nag-Hammadi,” 35–38.40This is a typical example of the favored or “beloved” disciple theme found inMatt 16, throughout the Fourth Gospel, and in the Thomas literature (Gos. Thom.14, the Book of Thomas the Contender). Meeks, “The Image of the Androgyne,” 190n. 111, refers to Gos. Phil.63,30–32: “[Sophia], called the barren, is the mother ofthe angels, and the consort [koinwnov\"] of [Christ] is Mary Magdalene.” In Gos. Phil.61,10–11, koinwnivameans sexual intercourse, though perhaps not physical; in63,30–36 Christ is said to love Mary and to have kissed her often, presumablyimpregnating her (as the Savior, in the Valentinian scheme, made the barren lowerSophia pregnant), since “it is by a kiss that the perfect conceive and give birth. Forthis reason we also kiss one another. We receive conception from the grace [cavri\"]which is in one another” (59,1–6)."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Gospel of Philip(II 84,14–85,21) represents the bridal chamber orPleroma, Christ, and the spiritual elect with the imagery of the heavenlytemple and high priesthood similar to that found in the NT letter to theHebrews (6:19–20; 9:2–5). The reality of the Pleroma, symbolized as theholy of holies, has been concealed from those inhabiting the outer courtsof the cosmos from the time that the inferior creator fashioned the world,available to those outside only in types and images. But now the veil sep-arating the holy of holies from the outer courts of the cosmos has been rent,and these outer courts of the templelike cosmos will be destroyed. Theircreator, the demiurge, will not enter the holy of holies, but will ascend tothe Hebdomad below Horos, the lower boundary of the Pleroma. When theouter precincts of the cosmic temple are destroyed, the merely psychicmembers of the Valentinian community will be saved by the church, sym-bolized by the ark, while the truly pneumatic members, those belonging tothe priesthood, will be able to go through the veil into the Pleroma in thecompany of the high priest, the Savior.The actual ritual involved in the sacred marriage of the Valentinianscannot be determined with certainty. Given its eschatological reference,Gaffron considers it to have been the believer’s last sacrament, a “deathsacrament” rather like the Mandaean Masiqta.41As one might expect ofany mystery rite, the Gospel of Philip(NHC II 82,7–26) makes it clear thatthe mystery of the bride chamber is reserved for the pneumatic membersof the Valentinian community alone. The intercourse of bride and bride-groom is private, pure, and undefiled; the pneumatic bride may revealher true nature only to those who may enter the bridal chamber everyday: her father, mother, and the friend and sons of the bridegroom. TheGospel of Philip(II 69,1–5) specifies that “a bridal chamber is not for theanimals, nor is it for the slaves, nor is it for defiled women; but it is forfree men and virgins.” Meeks notes the parallel in Gos. Thom.75: “Themonacoivare the [only] ones who will enter the bridal chamber,” but herethe bridal chamber seems only a metaphor, rather than a cultic anticipa-tion, of “the kingdom.”42Although no cultic acts are described in theGospel of Thomas,baptism is presumably presupposed. “Male andfemale” are to be made “one,” but it is an unequal union, since thefemale must become male if she is to become a “living spirit” (logionRitual in Gnosticism11741Gaffron, “Studien zum koptischen Philippusevangelium,” 191–222.42Meeks, “The Image of the Androgyne,” 193–96, citing also the parallel inlogion 49. “Blessed are the solitary [monacoiv] and elect [or, “blessed and elect arethe solitary”] for you shall find the Kingdom. . . because you come from it (and) youshall go there again” (trans. Guillaumont et al.). The gnostic conception of “the king-dom” here is reinforced by the following logion, “We have come from the Light, wherethe Light has originated through itself. It [stood] and it revealed itself in their image.”"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"114).43As Meeks notes, the monacov\"in the Gospel of Thomasis beyondsexuality, “like a little child” (Gos. Thom.22), whose innocence of sexu-ality is portrayed in the removal of clothing without shame—like Adambefore the fall (logion 37, cf. logion 21).44The heresiologists, most of whose information about ritual details waslikely inferred from reading gnostic treatises, concluded, sometimes cor-rectly, that the rite of the bride chamber involved physical sex relations.45The Gospel of Philipdisparages actual cohabitation, even though it is an“image” of the true union “in the Aion.”46As early as 1959, H.-M. Schenkespeculated that the outward symbol of the Valentinian rite of the bridalchamber was the “holy kiss,” on the basis of the Gospel of PhilipNHC II59,2–6 (“For it is by a kiss that the perfect conceive and give birth. For thisreason we also kiss one another. We receive conception from the gracewhich is in one another”) and 63,30–64,2 naming Mary Magdalene asChrist’s most beloved disciple, whom he often used to kiss.47The popularpractice of the wider church tends to confirm that the kiss did have animportant place.48As Meeks concludes, “whatever the Gnostics did in themarriage sacrament, it clearly distinguished them, in their opinion, fromthose who were merely baptized and anointed. It was the sacrament of theelite, the teleoi.”49118John D. Turner43The phrase “become a living spirit” is perhaps an allusion to Gen 2:7, possi-bly even a pun on “Eve.” In Clement of Alexandria Exc.79 the female “seed”becomes male when it is “formed” (morfwqevn).44“The Image of the Androgyne,” 194, referring to J. Z. Smith’s “The Garmentsof Shame,” comparings the homilies of Theodore of Mopsuestia, who contrastsnudity at baptism, when shame is still felt, with an eschatological nudity withoutshame. Meeks also adduces logion 21, where clothing represents the physical bodyby which one is connected temporarily to the world, “the field.”45Grant thinks this likely (“The Mystery of Marriage in the Gospel of Philip,”139). Gos. Phil.61,5–12 redefines adultery as “koinwnivabetween those who are notalike,” i.e., between gnostics and nongnostics (cf. 78,25–79,12). See below undersexual sacramentalism.4664,30–65,1; 76,6–9; 85,29–86,4. Clement of Alexandria Strom.3.29 describesthe Valentinian “marriage” as “spiritual.”47Schenke, “Das Evangelium nach Philippus,” TLZ84 (1959): 1–26, and “Kop-tisch-gnostiche Schriften aus den Papyrus-Codices von Nag-Hammadi,” 38, contraGrant, “The Mystery of Marriage in the Gospel of Philip,” 139.48Cf. 58,30–59,6. According to the Apostolic Traditionof Hippolytus, only thoseare admitted to the kiss of peace who have received both baptism and chrismation.The catholic rite, however, keeps men and women separate for the kiss (18.3–4;22.3.6).49Meeks, “The Image of the Androgyne,” 191."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"6. Sexual Sacramentalism6.1. The Simonians and ValentiniansWhile many gnostic groups of the second and third century advocatedand practiced a sexual and dietary encratism approaching a true demo-nization of sexuality, other groups rejected such a practice as ineffectiveand deceptive, transforming the moral indifference typical of its libertineopposite, free sexual exchange, into sacred ritual. According to Irenaeus(Haer.1.23.4), the Simonians worship images of Simon Magus and Helen,as well as engage in various occult practices, including exorcisms, incan-tations, philters, and erotic magic. Hippolytus (Ref.6.19.5) specifies furtherthat this erotic magic took the form of sexual intercourse as a means ofexperiencing spiritual union. In Haer.1.13.1–5, Irenaeus indicates that theValentinian Marcus interpreted the rite of the bride-chamber in a sexuallyexplicit way, claiming himself to be the Grace whose luminous seedshould be deposited “in her bridal chamber” as a way of imitating thepleromatic syzygetic union of male and female aeons, thus entering intothe One together with him.6.2. A Sethian Offshoot: The BorboritesAccording to Epiphanius (Pan.26.3–12), the later Sethians, whom hecalls Borborites, Barbelites, Phibionites, Stratiotici, and Coddians, engagedin a thoroughgoing sexual sacramentalism. Their symbolic actions includeda ritual handshake (featuring tickling beneath the palms of joined hands),a love feast in which spouses were exchanged, homosexual intercourse onthe part of a special class called Levites, naked prayer featuring the eleva-tion to the 365 Archons (e.g., Iao, Saklas, Seth, Daveithai, Eloaeus, Yald-abaoth, Sabaoth, Barbelo, the Autogenes Christ, and the supremeAutopater) of hands smeared with semen and menstrual blood (apparentlysymbolizing the elevation of the host and wine commemorating the “pas-sion” of Christ), and consumption of the same as a form of Eucharist. Ifone of the women accidentally conceived, the fetus was extracted andsacramentally consumed to prevent the further dispersal of the divine spiritin another human body.According to Stephen Gero,50the central, distinguishing feature of the sect, its devotion to the so-calledspermacult, described by [Epiphanius] in vivid detail, can hardly be dis-missed as a prurient invention. In the simplest of terms it involved theRitual in Gnosticism11950S. Gero, “With Walter Bauer on the Tigris: Encratite Orthodoxy and LibertineHeresy in Syro-Mesopotamian Christianity,” in Nag Hammadi, Gnosticism, andEarly Christianity(ed. C. W. Hedrick and R.

In these fluids isconcentrated the spiritual element, found scattered in the world, in par-ticular in food-stuffs (including meat!), of which the initiates can andshould partake. The mythology proper is a version of the Barbelo-gnos-tic myth, as known from Irenaeus and the Apocryphon of John.Although Epiphanius does not say that they called this rather unrestrainedritual sex a “mystery” or rite of the bridal chamber, it seems clear that itsintent was the same, effecting a restoration of the lost primordial unity byphysical coupling and attempting to reverse the natural course of the prop-agation of the species.7. Verbal PerformancesA large and varied class of ritual expression can be loosely gatheredunder the head of ritual speech, which can include glossalalia, traditionalverbal formulas, spells, oaths, conjuration, invocations, evocations, vocesmysticae,sunqhvmata, and prayers of various sorts addressed to transcen-dent powers, good and evil alike.The Basilideans (Irenaeus Haer.1.24.4) are said to engage in magic,conjuring of the dead, spells, calling up of spirits, and the invocation byname of each of the angelic beings belonging to the 365 heavens: “The per-son who has learnt these things, and knows all the angels and their origins,becomes invisible and incomprehensible to all the angels and powers.” Inhis Contra Celsum(6.31), Origen describes numerous verbal formulasemployed by the Ophites as passwords used by the ascending soul to mol-lify the hostility of the heavenly rulers blocking their entrance into thedivine world. These formulas bear a striking resemblance to the first personself-predicatory recognition formulas attributed to the gnostic revealer wholikewise used them in the course of his own descent and reascent to dis-arm the hostile cosmic powers. As the ascending soul traverses the spheresof the powers (the solitary king, Yaldabaoth/Saturn, Iao, Sabaoth,Astaphaios, Ailoaios, Horaios), it announces to the respective rulers its spe-cial status as purified and freed from the archontic powers, possessing thedivine light and life, imbued with the power of the Mother. Thus:But you, archon Yaldabaoth, to whom power belongs as first and seventh,I go with confidence as a ruling Logos of pure Nous, as a perfect workfor the Son and the Father, bearing by the imprint of a stamp the symbolof life, having opened for the world the gate which you had by your aeonclosed; as a free man I go past your power. Grace be with me, yes, Father,be it with me. (Cels.6.31)120John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Irenaeus (Haer.1.21.5) also attributes similar formulas to Valentinians who,in the context of a death-bed anointing, are provided with recognition for-mulas by which they identify themselves to the demiurge as a son of thepreexistent Father who invokes the higher Sophia as the supreme Mother,whose power greatly transcends that of the demiurge’s mother, the lowerSophia Achamoth.The ultimate ancestor of this genre of passwords seems to be foundeither in the dialogues of the Egyptian Book of the Deador, more likely, inthe Orphic-Bacchic gold leaves inscribed with hexameter instructions tothe dead about the path to be followed in the other world, such as this onefrom Hipponion:51In the house of Hades there is a spring [i.e. Lethe, of forgetfulness] to theright; by it stands a white cypress. Here the souls, descending, are cooled.Do not approach this spring! Further you will find cool water flowingfrom the lake of recollection. Guardians stand over it who will ask you intheir sensible mind why you are wandering through the darkness of cor-ruptible Hades. Answer: “I am a son of the earth and of the starry sky, butI am desiccated with thirst and am perishing; therefore quickly give mecool water flowing from the lake of recollection.” And then the subjectsof the Chthonic King (?) will have pity and will give you to drink from thelake of recollection.... And indeed you are going a long, sacred waywhich also other mystaiand bacchoigloriously walk.In gnostic literature, one finds verbal formulas, often in the context ofecstatic prayer and praise, that are clearly intended as syllables of power.Sometimes these syllables are enigmatic abbreviations for articulate utter-ances, sometimes they have nearly the character of Hindu mantras, as inthe chanting of strings of vowels in seminumerical groupings, where theemphasis seems to lie in the sonority and repetitiveness of the verbal per-formance. In this regard, the following passage from the Gospel of the Egyp-tians(NHC III,266,9–68,1) is exemplary:ih ieus hw ou hw wua!

The prayer also contains an apparent ref-erence to water baptism, in which ordinary physical water (“in the type ofthe archons”) is converted into living water by mixing it with the spirit(“incense of life”) possessed by the baptizand; rather than being purifiedprior to baptism by invocation of the Spirit or by holy oil, the baptismalwater is here purified by the one undergoing baptism, since he has alreadyreceived the light.In the gnostic treatises one finds also extended doxologies in praise ofthe aeonic powers. In the Sethian treatises, there are the four particularlystriking parallel doxologies in Allogenes(XI 53,32–54,37), the Three Stelesof Seth(VII 126,5–13), and Zostrianos(VIII 51,6–52,25 and 88,9–25). Theyrecite a traditional list of nomina barbaradesignating divine beingsinvoked in the course of the mystical ascent through the Aeon of Bar-belo.53In fact the entire Three Steles of Sethis essentially an extended dox-ology in praise of the Sethian Father, Mother, and Son triad, praising the122John D.

In theNag Hammadi library, the Prayer of Thanksgiving(NHC VI,7), whichoccurs also in Greek (Papyrus Mimaut) and at the end of the Latin Ascle-pius,is a combination of petitions with doxological praise, which is con-cluded by a mutual embrace (ajspavzesqai, cf. the “kiss of peace) and acommunal meal of “sacred food that has no blood in it” (VI 65,3–7). Thisprayer follows the Hermetic treatise The Discourse on the Eighth and theNinth,which itself contains the extended prayer of an unnamed initiate tohis spiritual father Hermes Trismegistus. Having attained the Hebdomad,Hermes guides the initiate towards the Ogdoad and Ennead, where he seesthat his guide is Intellect itself and, along with other angels and souls, hesings a hymn of praise to the Father in silence. The prayer seems to beregarded as a “spiritual sacrifice” (cf. Rom 12:1) and contains petition, are-talogical doxology, and ecstatic chanting of vowels spoken in the first per-son plural; it is followed later by a hymn with a similar chant in the firstperson singular (NHC VI 55,23–61,18). Taken with other Hermetic prayers(Corp. herm.1.31–32; 13.16–20; Asclepius41), these prayers indicate anestablished community ritual in which visionary experience is expressed inprayers of praise, thanksgiving and ecstatic formulas, and celebrated in ameal. There is also the very similar doxological Prayer of the Apostle Paulincluded in the front of the Jung Codex (NHC I,1).54Three of the five supplements to A Valentinian Exposition(NHCXI,2a; XI,2d;and XI,2e) are prayers, separated by two short catacheses onthe nature of baptism. The first is a prebaptismal invocation of Christ toanoint baptismal candidates with the power to “trample on the heads ofsnakes and scorpions and all the power of the Devil” (Luke 10:19; cf.Clement of Alexandria Exc.76); this is very similar to the prebaptismalpractice of exorcising the devil through the acts of anointing with oil andpenitence by standing on sackcloth or goatskin.55The other two prayersare pre-eucharistic thanksgivings. Although not part of a ritual setting, twoother prayers might be mentioned, which are petitions for release from thetroubles of this life, one at the conclusion of the Book of Thomas the Con-tender(NHC II 145,8–16), and James’s prayer for a speedy death at theconclusion of the Second Apocalypse of James(NHC V 62,13–63,29).Ritual in Gnosticism12354On prayer in gnostic sources, see E.

So as far as you can,O King—and you can do all things—keep this our discourse from trans-lation, in order that such mighty mysteries may not come to the Greeks,and the disdainful speech of Greece with all its looseness and its surfacebeauty, so to speak, take all the strength out of the solemn and thestrong—the energetic speech of Names. The Greeks, O King, have novelwords, effecting demonstration only; and thus is the philosophizing of theGreeks—the noise of words. But we do not use words; we rather usesounds filled full with deeds.As Socrates says in the Cratylus(439a; 424bc), “names rightly given are thelikenesses and images of the things they name.” He who would imitate theessence of things in speech must give them a name; to analyze them, onemust “separate” the syllables and letters, “first the vowels, and then the con-sonants and mutes, into classes according to the traditional distinctions ofthe learned, also the semivowels, which are neither vowels nor yet mutes,and distinguish into classes the vowels themselves.” Of course, more desir-able is a kind of knowledge that grasps reality directly, without names.The most striking instance of gnostic texts containing words and sym-bols of power is the Books of Jeuin the Bruce Codex. Nearly every pageportrays tables and lists of divine names, powers, and attributes in the formof voces mysticae et barbaraintended to be pronounced, as well as numer-ous graphic images that were perhaps intended to be gazed upon until atrancelike state resulted. The graphic sunqhvmata(tokens), appearing asthey do on the pages of a codex, seem to presuppose private appropria-tion on the part of the reader rather than communal recitation and thusapproach the phenomenon of the “reading mystery” (Lesemysterium), aterm coined by Reitzenstein to characterize the gradated reading of theCorpus hermeticum.Although apparently independent of ritual contexts, the alphabet mys-ticism and magic scattered throughout the pages of gnostic literature are tobe used as words of power.56It consists of mysterious combinations of 124John D. Turner56See F. Dornseiff, Das Alphabet in Mystik und Magie(2d ed.; Berlin: Teubner,1925); and A.

Partic-ularly important is the use of names, especially the Tetragrammaton andother Semitic formations such as Sabaoth and Abrasax, names for the daiv-mone\"of the planetary Hebdomad, as well as a multitude of frikta; ojnovmataand ojnovmata a[shma kai; bavrbara, whose significance is hard to ascertain.57The primary example of these is of course the Greek magical papyri.Although space and complexity forbids treating these phenomena inany detail, perhaps the most extensive gnostic examples are Irenaeus’saccount (Haer.1.13–22) of the alphabetic and numerical speculations of theValentinian Marcus and the unfortunately very fragmentary phonological,arithmological, and astral speculations on the shape of the soul in theSethian treatise Marsanes(NHC X,1). The Valentinian Marcus “the Magician”reports a “decree of the Tetrad” concerning the highest divine principles:Understand the twenty-four letters that you have as symbolic emanationsof the three powers that contain the entire number of elements on high.The nine mute consonants belong to the Father and Truth because theyare voiceless, that is, inexpressible and unutterable. The eight semi-vowels belong to Logos and Life, since they occupy as it were the inter-mediate position between the unvoiced and the voiced, and they receivethe effusion of those above them and elevate those beneath them. Thevowels, seven in number, belong to Man and Church, since a voice wentforth from Man and formed all things, for the echo of the voice gave themform. (Irenaeus Haer.1.14.5)The theurgical intent of this alphabetic speculation is nicely summed up byNicomachus of Gerasa, who makes clear the relation between the elementsof the alphabet (letters, vowels, and consonants), the elements of numberand geometrical shape, and both musical and spoken sounds:For indeed the sounds of each sphere of the seven, each sphere naturallyproducing one certain kind of sound, are called “vowels.” They are inef-fable in and of themselves, but are recalled by the wise with respect toeverything made up of them. Wherefore also here (i.e., on earth) thissound has power, which in arithmetic is a monad, in geometry a point, ingrammar a letter (of the alphabet).

Wherefore when especially the theurgists are worshipping such (adivine being), they invoke it symbolically with hissing sounds and cluck-ing, with inarticulate and foreign sounds.58In Marsanes,this symbolic power of the letters applies not only to thepowers of the zodiacal signs, but also to various “configurations” (schv-mata) of the soul.59The rather better preserved section (NHC X 18,14b–39,17) on the alphabet and its relation to the configurations or shapes ofthe soul seems to reflect portions of Plato’s discussion of the structure ofthe world soul and the embodiment of soul into body in Tim.35A–44D.Of particular importance seem to be three fundamental (“first,” “second,”“third”) and two minor (“fourth,” and “fifth”) configurations of the soul inrelation to various components of the alphabet: the seven “simple” vowels(aehiouw) and their combination into diphthongs; the seventeen conso-nants and their various subcategories (the semivowels—liquids [lmnrs]plus double consonants [zxy]—and the mutes—aspirate [qfc], inaspirate[kpt] and “intermediate” [bgd]); and the combination of all of them into syl-lables. In addition to these five “configurations” of the soul, the author alsoseems to think in terms of two “nomenclatures” (ojnomasiva): one for the“gods and angels” (X 27,13–14; cf. 30,3–9) that has to do with naturalphonological combinations, and an “ignorant” nomenclature (X30,28b–31,4) which apparently has to so with certain unnatural combina-tions of the seven vowels and seventeen consonants.Apparently, the vowels and diphthongs symbolize the three highestconditions of the soul—cosmic as well as individual—apart from somaticembodiment, while the syllabic combinations of the consonants—perhapssymbolizing corporeality—with the vowels seem to symbolize the “fourth”and “fifth” configurations of the soul, perhaps as an embodied entity. Justas the vowels are “influenced” by consonants, so also are souls influencedby the body, just as both souls and bodies are influenced by the “angelic”58Nicomachus apud C.

But since the powers of these astral objects are also regarded assomehow present in the fundamental “elements” of reality in much thesame way as the soul is present in the body, knowledge of how their sym-bolic counterparts—the letters (as stoicei'a)—combine and mutually influ-ence one another at the levels of syllable and word apparently gives theknower some measure of control over the apparently external powers ofthe zodiac, stars, and planets, and the gods and angels embodied in them.These five configurations of the soul involving vowels alone might be sum-marized as follows:1. first outer (spherical?) configuration = aehiouw= only begotten soul—unitary, androgynous soul2. second spherical configuration = ehiou“from diphthongs” = self-begotten soul—dyadic, feminine soul3. third spherical configuration = <aaa>, eee, <hhh>, iii, ooo, uuu, www—triadic, male soul4. fourth (spherical?) configuration = combinations of vowels = visible,perceptible soul5. fifth (spherical?) configuration = combinations of vowels = visible,perceptible soulThis lengthy passage seems to constitute an alphanumeric interpretation ofthe psychogonia of Plato’s Tim.35A–44D. The first three configurations ofthe soul would represent the cosmic soul in terms either of its three basicingredients (Being, Difference, and Sameness) or, more likely, in terms ofthe spherical or circular configurations into which the demiurge divided it(36C2): an outer spherical envelope signifying the motion that revolvesinvariantly in the same place (the sphere of the fixed stars), containing twoinner circles, that of the same (the celestial equator defining the plane ofthis revolution), and the circle of the different (the ecliptic or zodiacal beltwithin which the movements of the sun and other planets is confined),which is subsequently subdivided into the individual orbits of the sevenplanets. If so, then the fourth and fifth configurations would represent the“second and third” portions (41D5) remaining in the mixing bowl fromwhich individual souls were made and sown into each star, thus becom-ing visible (not the souls themselves, but their “bodies,” Plato, Laws898DE;Proclus In Tim.3.255.10–16) and “revealing” visible things (X 29,2–6). Atthis point, the younger gods are assigned the task of incarnating thesesouls into mortal bodies—which Marsanesseems to symbolize by the con-sonants—crafted from the four elements (42E–44C).

Incarnation results in the ini-tial loss of the soul’s natural or innate “nomenclature” (the one for godsand angels) and its replacement by an unnatural (ignorant) “nomencla-ture.” In this way, Marsanesestablishes direct relationships between, onthe one hand, the various conditions of the soul and its relative knowledgeand ignorance, and on the other, the ability to understand the appropriatecombination of the letters of the alphabet.8. Ascensional and Contemplative Practices8.1. The Sethian Platonizing TreatisesIn the treatises Allogenes, Three Steles of Seth, Zostrianos,and Marsanes,salvation is not brought from above to below by divine visitations but ratheroccurs through the gnostic’s contemplative ascent through ever higher lev-els of the divine realm. Here one finds an exemplary visionary, Allogenes orMarsanes (probably alternative designations for Seth), utilizing a self-per-formable technique of successive stages of mental detachment from theworld of multiplicity and a corresponding assimilation of the self to the evermore refined levels of being to which one’s contemplation ascends, until oneachieves an absolute stasis and cognitive vacancy characteristic of deifica-tion. The Three Steles of Sethpresupposes a three-stage ascent to the Auto-genes, the Aeon of Barbelo, and the supreme One. Allogenes depicts asimilar three-stage ascent but begins at the Aeon of Barbelo and adds anascent through the supra-intelligible levels of the Triple-Powered One of theInvisible Spirit, culminating in a “primary revelation” of the UnknowableOne. A similar ascent is portrayed in Zostrianos,except that it has been sup-plemented by a series of initial stages within the sense-perceptible realm,and each successive stage of ascent after these is associated with a certainbaptismal sealing. Marsanesmerely comments on certain features of theascent, which its author claims to have already undergone.The text that most warrants the treatment of this contemplative ascentas an established ritual is the Three Steles of Seth,in which the aretalogicaldoxologies of Seth in honor of his father Geradamas, the Aeon of Barbelo,and the ultimate preexistent One are provided for the use of both individ-uals and a community: “Whoever remembers these and always glorifiesshall be perfect among those who are perfect and impassive beyond allthings; for individually and collectively they all praise these: and afterwardthey shall be silent. And just as it has been ordained for them, they willascend. After silence, they will descend from the third, they will bless thesecond, and afterward, the first. The way of ascent is the way of descent”(NHC VII 127,6–21). In the first Stele, Seth praises his father Geradamas ashis intellect, then as the Autogenes (“self-generated”), the “Mirotheid” off-spring of Barbelo (Mirothea is the mother of Adamas in Gos. Eg. NHC III128John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"49,1–12 and Zost.VIII 6,30) who presides over Seth’s “alien” seed, theimmovable race; then both Seth and Geradamas praise the thrice-masculineaeon Barbelo who came forth to the middle to empower and bestowcrowns and perfection upon them. The second stele is directed by the “per-fect individuals” to Barbelo as their three-in-one source, the source of allmultiplicity, the projected image (“shadow”) of the “first pre-existent One,”the bestower of divinity, goodness and blessing; the “individuals” petitionher to save them by uniting them. The third stele is directed to the preex-istent One, the only and living Spirit, the Existence, Life, and Mind of theAll, whom they entreat to present a “command” that they might be saved;at that point, the petitioners recognize that they have been saved and there-fore offer praise and glory. Each stele marks a stage on the contemplativeascent to the One. Just as Seth, spiritual ancestor of the Sethians, praisedand joined his father Adamas in the praise of the Mother Barbelo and of hersource, the preexistent One, so the members of the Sethian community areto follow the same pattern in their own ascent to the Aeon of Barbelo andreceive the revelation of the Invisible Spirit.The treatise that most likely contains the key to the ritual origins of theSethian ascensional rite is Zostrianos,since, as noted above, it marks thevarious stages of Zostrianos’s visionary ascent with certain baptisms, seal-ings, washings in various “waters.” It is perhaps also significant thatMarsanes(NHC X 2,12–4,24) enumerates the entire sequence of the onto-logical levels underlying these treatises as thirteen “seals.”Of these texts, it is Allogenesthat most clearly portrays the method ofthis ascent, so it will form the basis of the following exposition, eventhough it narrates the ascent as that of an individual and enumerates thelevels of ascent slightly differently than the others.The cosmology of these treatises is tripartite but belongs to the four-level ontology of Speusippus, the Neopythagoreans, and Plotinus, whichposits a highest realm beyond even being itself, below which one finds anatemporal, intelligible realm of pure being, followed by a psychic realm,characterized by time and motion, and finally a physical realm at the bot-tom of the scale. The following summary of the ontology of Allogeneswillsuffice to indicate the ontological structure of the entire group.The highest being, corresponding to the Plotinian One, is the Unknow-able One or Invisible Spirit, characterized by nonbeing existence, silence,and stillness; he is not an existing thing and is completely unknowable (XI62,23–64,14; Marsanes[X 2,12–23] adds yet another level, the “unknown,silent One” beyond even the Invisible Spirit).The second major level is that of the Aeon of Barbelo, the FirstThought of the Invisible Spirit, characterized as a nondiscriminating, incor-poreal, [timeless] knowledge (XI 51,10–11). The Barbelo Aeon is subdi-vided into three levels that correspond to aspects of the PlotinianRitual in Gnosticism129"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"hypostases of Intellect and Soul: (1) the domain of “the authentic existents”(ta; o[ntw\" o[nta, the nohtav) presided over by Kalyptos (the Hidden One, asort of nou'\" nohtov\") rather like the Plotinian Intellect; (2) the domain of“those who are unified” (i.e., “exist together,” cf. Enn.4.1.1: ejkei'[ejn tw'/ nw'/]oJmou' me;n pa'\" nou'\"...oJmou' de; pavsai yucaiv) presided over by Protophanes(the First Appearing One, a sort of nou'\" qewrhtikov\"), rather like the Plo-tinian cosmic Soul; and (3) the domain of the “(perfect) individuals” (per-haps individual souls) presided over by Autogenes (the Self-Begotten One,a sort of demiurgic nou'\" dianoouvmeno\"), who operates to rectify the realmof Nature, rather like the Plotinian individuated soul.The third level, Nature, is merely mentioned in passing as a realmwhose defects are continually rectified by Autogenes and appears to holdno interest for the author of Allogenes,although the treatise Marsanes(X5,23–26) regards this realm as “entirely worthy of preservation.”The mediator between the Invisible Spirit and the Aeon of Barbelo isan entity called the Triple-Powered One. This being is mentioned some-times independently and sometimes in conjunction with the InvisibleSpirit.60By a static self-extension, the Invisible Spirit through his Triple-Powered One becomes the Aeon of Barbelo (XI 45,21–30; cf. Zost.VIII76,7–19; 78,10–81,20; Steles SethVII 121,20–122,8; MarsanesX 8,18–9,28).Thus the Triple-Powered One is the potency (duvnami\") of the UnknownOne and/or Invisible Spirit by which he unfolds himself into the world ofBeing and Intellect. It is said to consist of three modalities or phases: That-which-is (Being or Existence), Vitality, and Mentality (XI 49,26–38).In Allogenes,the Triple-Powered One is identical with the InvisibleSpirit in its Existence-phase, discontinuous with the Invisible Spirit butidentical with Barbelo in its Mentality-phase, and in its emanative or Vital-ity-phase, it is simultaneously continuous and discontinuous with both theInvisible Spirit and Barbelo. Allogenesattributes also to the UnknowableOne/Invisible Spirit a similar triad of attributes but characterizes them as130John D. Turner60The Invisible Spirit and the Triple-Powered One are mentioned sometimesseparately (Zost.VIII 15,18; 17,7; 24,9–10; 93,6–9; 124,3–4; AllogenesXI 45,13–30;52,19; 52,30–33; 53,30; 61,1–22; and MarsanesX 4,13–19; 6,19; 8,11; 9,25; 14,22–23;15,1–3), sometimes as identical with or in close conjunction with the Invisible Spirit(Zost.VIII 20,15–18; 24,12–13; 63,7–8; 74,3–16; 79,16–23; 80,11–20; 87,13–14;97,2–3; 118,11–12; 123,19–20; 128,20–21; AllogenesXI 47,8–9; 51,8–9; 58,25;66,33–34; Steles SethVII 121,31–32; MarsanesX 7,16–17 [the “activity” of the Invis-ible Spirit]; 7,27–29; 8,5–7), often as “the Triple-Powered Invisible Spirit” or “theinvisible spiritual Triple-Powered One,” and sometimes in conjunction with Barbelo(Steles SethVII 120,21–22; 121,32–33; 123,18–30; MarsanesX 8,19–20; 9,7–20;10,8–11). As the activity of the Invisible Spirit, the Triple-Powered One is perhapsidentical with all three in MarsanesX 7,1–9,29."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"acts rather than qualities or substances: “he exists, lives and knows with-out mind, life or existence” (XI 61, 32–39).In reality, all three levels are only separate phases of the unfolding ofthe Invisible Spirit by means of its Triple-Powered One into the Aeon ofBarbelo. Rather than being a triad of principles distributed vertically amongdifferent planes of reality, the Existence-Life-Intellect triad is seen as adynamic three-in-one principle in which each phase of the triad, whilecontaining the other two, is named by the phase of the triad that predom-inates at each stage of its unfolding: Unknowable One/Invisible SpiritExistsLivesKnowsTriple-Powered One/Eternal LifeExistenceVitalityMentalityBarbelo/First ThoughtBeing(Life)MindIn the accompanying diagram, the italicized term indicates the relative pre-dominance of one of the three modalities. The first phase coincides withthe Invisible Spirit and the third phase with the Aeon of Barbelo, in effectgiving rise to a median phase in which the Triple-Powered One is discon-tinuous with both the Invisible Spirit and Barbelo, having a quasi-hyposta-tic character of its own.8.2. The Visionary Ascent in AllogenesAllogenes(XI 58,26–61,21) tripartitions the contemplative ascent intoseparate but successive stages in accord with the tripartitioning of its gen-eral ontology, since the object of the ascent is to become assimilated witheach higher level of being through which one passes. Each stage of theascent is prefaced by instruction from a revealer. The technique of the ini-tial ascent through the lowest level of the intelligible realm, the Aeon ofBarbelo is revealed by the “male virgin” Youel (57,29–58,26). The tech-nique of the culminating ascent through the Triple-Powered One isrevealed by the three “luminaries of the Aeon of Barbelo” (58,26–61,22)and is structured in terms of the tripartite nomenclature previously appliedto the Triple-Powered One in 49,26–38. The technique of the final unionwith the Unknowable One, however, cannot be conveyed by a positivedescriptive revelation, but only by a “primary revelation of the Unknow-able One”; this turns out to be the long negative theology in 61,32–64,36,by which one acquires the saving gift of learned ignorance. On comple-tion of the ascent and revelation, Allogenes’ appropriate response will beto record and safeguard the revelation (68,16–23) and entrust its procla-mation to his confidant Messos (68,26–end).Stage 1: The Ascent through the Aeon of Barbelo.The revealer Youelinstructs Allogenes concerning the initial part of the ascent to “the Godwho truly [preexists],” which requires a perfect seeking of the GoodRitual in Gnosticism131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"within oneself, by which one knows oneself as one who exists with thepreexistent God. According to 50,10–36, the wisdom conveyed by Youel’sinitial revelation of the Aeon of Barbelo and of the Triple-Powered Onewill restore Allogenes to his primordial, unfallen condition. It will investAllogenes’ “thought” with the power requisite to distinguish between“immeasurable and unknowable” things, the contents of the Barbelo Aeonand the principles beyond it, causing Allogenes to fear that his learninghas exceeded normal limits. One notes again the metaphor of putting ona garment.In 52,7–21, after Youel’s initial revelation of the contents of the Aeonof Barbelo, Allogenes reports that his soul went slack with disturbance.Turning to himself, he sees the light surrounding him and the Good withinhim and becomes divine, which Youel interprets as a completion of wis-dom sufficient to receive a revelation of the Triple-Powered One.Interpreted in the light of the ontology of the treatise, it seems as ifAllogenes has become successively assimilated to the various levels of theBarbelo Aeon: first, to the level of the “individuals” within Autogenes, andsecond, to the level of “those who are unified” within Protophanes, andthird, to “those who truly exist” in Kalyptos.In her fifth discourse (55,33–57,24), Youel promises Allogenes that,after an incubation period of a “hundred years” (during which he presum-ably is to engage in self-contemplation, experiencing “a great light and ablessed path,” 57,27–58,7), he will receive a revelation from the “luminar-ies of the Aeon of Barbelo.” This revelation will convey only so much asis necessary to know without Allogenes forfeiting his own kind. If Allo-genes is successful in this, he will receive a conception (e[nnoia) of the pre-existent One and know himself as one “who exists with the God who trulypreexists” (56,18–36), which will make him divine and perfect.At the conclusion of the “hundred years” of preparation, Allogenesreports that he saw Autogenes, the Triple Male, Protophanes, Kalyptos, theAeon of Barbelo, and the “primal origin of the One without origin,” that is,the Triple-Powered One of the Invisible Spirit (57,29–58,26). One shouldprobably understand this as Allogenes’ ascent through the various levels ofthe Aeon of Barbelo up to and including the lowest aspect (“blessedness”or Mentality) of the Triple-Powered One, which would be identical withthe entirety of the Aeon of Barbelo itself. Up to this point, Allogenes stillbears his earthly “garment” (58,29–30).This initial vision culminates with Allogenes’ receipt of a luminous gar-ment by which he is taken up to “a pure place” (58,31), where he tran-scends (“stands upon”) his knowledge (characterized by blessedness andself-knowledge) of the individual constituents of the Barbelo-Aeon. He is now ready for “holy powers” revealed to him by the “luminaries of the Aeon of Barbelo” to encourage him to “strive for” an even higher 132John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"knowledge toward which he had already “inclined,” namely “the knowl-edge of the Universal Ones, the Barbelo Aeon” (59,2–3).Stage 2: The Ascent through the Triple-Powered One.The ascent beyondthe Aeon of Barbelo to the Unknowable One is first revealed to Allogenesby holy powers (59,4–60,12) and then actually narrated (60,12–61,22) byAllogenes in a way quite similar to the revelation, yielding what amountsto two accounts of the ascent. Having surpassed his active, earthly knowl-edge and inclining toward the passive knowledge of the Universal Ones(the Triple-Powered One and the Invisible Spirit, 59,2–3), Allogenesattains first the level of blessedness (i.e., Mentality), at which one knowsone’s proper self, sees the good in oneself, and becomes divine (59,9–13;60,14–18). Next, as he “seeks himself,” he ascends (ajnacwrei'n) to the levelof Vitality, characterized by an undivided, eternal, intellectual motion, asupra-eidetic realm where one achieves partial stability (he stands notfirmly but quietly, 59,14–16; 60,19–28). Finally Allogenes achieves thelevel of Existence, characterized by a completely inactive “stillness” and“standing” (59,19–26; 60,28–37). He is filled with a “primary revelationof the unknowable One” that empowers and permanently strengthenshim, enabling him to receive an incognizant knowledge of the Unknow-able One.At this point, having assimilated himself to the primal modality of theTriple-Powered One, Allogenes can no longer ascend to any higher level;only in the case that he becomes afraid can he further withdraw and thatonly “to the rear because of the activities” (59,34–35; cf. Plotinus Enn.3.8.9.29–40; 6.9.3.1–13). He must not “seek incomprehensible matters” butmust avoid any further effort lest he dissipate his inactivity and fall awayfrom the passivity, concentratedness, and instantaneousness of the primaryrevelation to follow (59,26–60,12; cf. 64,14–26; 67,22–38). Allogenes is toldto be “incognizant” (“ignorant” or “nonknowing”) of the Unknowable One,that is, not to exercise any faculties of the active intellect, lest this activityinitiate a movement that would destroy the stability he has achieved. Evento fear this extreme inertness is such a mental activity and necessitates awithdrawal to a previous level of contemplation. Once he receives the pri-mary revelation, he must therefore “still himself” and remain completelyself-concentrated (“do not further dissipate”) and refrain from any exerciseof the active intellect, even if it should be a “luminous e[nnoia,” whichmight replace and therefore destroy the inactivity conveyed to him by theUnknowable One.61In a state of utter passivity, Allogenes receives a “pri-mary revelation of the Unknowable One” (59,28–29; 60,39–61,1) charac-terized as a cognitively vacant knowledge of the Unknowable OneRitual in Gnosticism13361Cf. Plotinus Enn.5.8.11.23–24, 33–34."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"(59,30–32; 60,8–12; 61,1–4). This knowledge can be articulated only by anextensive negative theology (61,32–62,13; supplemented by a more affir-mative theology, 62,14–67,20).The sequence of Allogenes’ mental states therefore moves from rela-tive to permanent stability, and from self-knowledge to mental vacancy: (1)At the level of Mentality, characterized by silent stillness, he “hears” theBlessedness of true self-knowledge. (2) At the level of Vitality, character-ized by the eternal circular (“undivided”) motion of the supra-eidetic realm,and still seeking himself, he achieves partial stability. (3) At the level ofExistence, characterized by total stability and inactivity, he achieves a com-plete stability, permanently strengthened by the indwelling of the Triple-Powered One. (4) Allogenes is filled with the “primary revelation of theUnknowable One,” which allows him to know the Unknowable One andhis Triple-Powered One insofar as he maintains a state of complete incog-nizance and mental vacuity.The sequence of Allogenes’ mental states is also the reverse of thesequence of the dominant phases or ontological modalities in which theTriple-Powered One unfolds into the Aeon of Barbelo. His initial state iscalled Blessedness, a condition associated with a silent (nondiscursive?) self-contemplation characteristic of “Mentality,” which designates also the lowestphase of the Triple-Powered One’s three phases of Mentality, Vitality, andExistence. He is then instructed to move from this state to a less stable state,that of “Vitality,” which is characterized by an eternal circular motion that stillincludes a “seeking of oneself.” Then, in order to gain a state of ultimatestability, he is to move on to the level of Existence, the phase in which theTriple-Powered One is identical with the Invisible Spirit, who is absolutelyat rest and contains all in total silence and inactivity. In each case, the con-templation of entities on ever higher ontological levels is characterized as aform of the contemplator’s self-knowledge, suggesting that the conscious-ness of the knowing subject is actually assimilated to the ontological char-acter of the level that one intelligizes at any given point.Allogenesthus presents two levels of knowing: One is achievable inthe world and is characterized by the actual vision of what was commu-nicated in the auditory revelations imparted by the emissary-revealerYouel; it suffices to have a vision of each of the beings comprising theAeon of Barbelo up to and including the lower aspect of the Triple-Pow-ered One. The other is achievable, not in the world, but only after eleva-tion to a pure place, and is to be imparted by an apophatic “primaryrevelation” from the Luminaries of Barbelo’s Aeon; it enables one to expe-rience directly the realm beyond intellect and even being itself occupiedby the upper levels of the Triple-Powered One and the Unknowable One.The first level of knowing is active and discursive, involving knowledgeof oneself as well as the ability to experience one’s assimilation to the 134John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"variouslevels comprising the intellectual and psychic realm of the BarbeloAeon (58,38–59,3; 59,9–16): from individuated soul to unity with the cos-mic soul to the intellectual domain of the authentic existents. The sec-ond level of knowing is passive; strictly speaking it is not knowledge atall but culminates in a nonknowing, nondiscursive knowledge with noawareness of distinctions, even that between knower and known, anutter vacancy of the cognitive intellect, a “learned ignorance” (59,30–35;60,5–12; 61,1–4) called a “primary revelation of the Unknowable One”(59,28–29; 60,39–61,1).Stage 3: The Primary Revelation.The extensive negative theologyoccupying the last third of Allogenesexhibits a close relationship betweenthe negative ontological (apophatic) predications of the Invisible Spirit andthe noncognitive contemplation of him.62It turns out that the primary rev-elation conveying the ultimate vision of the supreme reality is identicalwith its object: the Invisible Spirit is the very primary revelation by whichhe is known (63,9–19). The Invisible Spirit is so unknowable that he is insome sense his own unknowable knowledge and forms a unity with theignorance that sees him; in fact he seems to be equated with the state ofmental vacancy itself (63,28–64,14). Yet one cannot simply use the equa-tion between the unknowable deity and the primary revelation or incog-nizant knowledge by which he is known as a way of knowing or speakingabout him. To equate him with either knowledge or nonknowledge is tomiss the goal of one’s quest (64,14–36). It is nevertheless clear that Allo-genesassumes that it is possible to achieve a consubstantiality between theknown, the means of knowledge, and the knower: the unknowable deityis united with the ignorance that sees him, which is identical with his ownself-knowledge. By implication, he is also united with the nonknowingvisionary as well. Thus there is an isomorphism, indeed an identity,between both the epistemic and ontic states of the knower, the known,and the means of knowledge at each stage of the ascent.The prototype of this threefold ascent is found in Plato’s Symposium(210a–212a), in the speech where Socrates recounts the path to the visionof absolute beauty into which he had been initiated by the wise Diotima.The method consists of a three-stage qualitative and quantitative purifica-tion or purgation of the soul by a redirection of Eros, the moving force ofthe soul, away from the lower realm to the higher.63The qualitative Ritual in Gnosticism13562See R. T. Wallis, “The Spiritual Importance of Not Knowing,” in ClassicalMediterranean Spirituality: Egyptian, Greek, Roman(ed. A. H. Armstrong; NewYork: Crossroad, 1986), 460–80; as Wallis notes, the knowledge of God as divinesilence in Corp. herm.10 is similar.63See the analysis of E.

The next higher stage is therefore achieved by a purifying and uni-fying synthesis of the experience of the lower stage. As in the Symposium,so also in the Republic(532A–B) the final moment of attainment is con-ceived as a revelation of the supreme form. After long preliminary effort,one’s soul or mind has transcended discursive science, dialectic itself, foran unmediated vision of or direct contact with the object sought. No longerdoes one “know about” the object things that can be predicated of it, butone actually possesses and is possessed by the object of one’s quest.In the first four centuries of our era to which the Barbeloite treatisesbelong, the Platonic tradition regarded metaphysics or theology as thehighest of the three stages of enlightenment or spiritual progress.64It cor-responded to the highest stage of initiation into the mysteries and was infact called ejpopteiva, the supreme vision of the highest reality, tanta-mount to assimilating oneself to God insofar as possible (Theaetetus176B).65This traditional Platonic quest is found not only in Plato but alsolater in Philo of Alexandria (who however shunned the notion of assim-ilation to God), Numenius, Valentinus, Albinus (i.e., Alcinous, the viaeanalogiae, negationis, additionisand eminentiaeof Did.10.5–6; cf.28.1–3), Clement of Alexandria (Strom.5.11.70.8–71.5), Origen (Cels.7.42) and especially Plotinus (Enn.6.7 [38].36). What is generally com-mon to these visionary ascents is initial purification, usually throughsome form of instruction involving the use of analogies, negations, andsuccessive abstraction until the contemplative mind has becomeabsorbed in its single object (the One, the Good, the Beautiful, etc.) at136John D.

Concluding ObservationsBy way of conclusion, it can be seen that the purpose of gnostic ritualwas uniformly salvific, a means to restore the primordial unity of the humanperson. This process might be conceived on a relatively more biblical basis,as uniting the male and female components of an original androgyne thatwrongfully underwent a primeval division. Or, on a more Platonic basis, asthe restoration of the soul to the original psychic substance from which itsungrudging maker extracted and incarnated it; its (metaphorically feminine)irrationality acquired from contact with materiality must be subjected to itshigher, undescended, rational or intellectual (metaphorically masculine)component. The gnostics illustrated the original perfection of the soul bythe pairing and agreement of the pleromatic aeons, and its degradation isillustrated by the lack of cooperation between male and female at themoment of the inception of the physical cosmos and its creator, whichbecome characterized by victimization and oblivion on the one hand, andby presumption and antagonism on the other. The physical bodies intowhich the divine substance was thereby incarnated must be stripped awaylike an old garment and replaced with the luminous garment made of thatsubstance; they must be thoroughly washed away and the inner personimmersed in the living water of wisdom, anointed with the fragrance of thedivine spirit, and wed with its other but higher self.In contrast to gnostic rites of baptism, investiture, chrismation, and thesacral meal—whose effect depends on a combination of divine initiativeand revealed insight (Gnosis)—the practice of ritual speech, sexual sacra-mentalism, and to some extent contemplative ascent come closest to thekind of ritual acts which effect their own work (ex opere operato). Baptism,investiture, chrismation, and even the sacral meal are typically said to bereceived or undergone. Similarly, the rite of sacral marriage is usually por-trayed as an eschatological gift, something to be awaited. On the otherhand, ritual sex, speech, gesture, and contemplative ascent depend muchmore on individual initiative and technique. In this sense, they border ontheurgical rites insofar as they exploit acquired knowledge of certain cos-mic sympathies and/or properties of physical actions that serve to assimi-late oneself to transcendent forces or levels of reality. Simonian,Valentinian, and especially Sethian materials witness both self-actualizedand conferred ritual procedures and portray salvation sometimes as “self-help” and “other help” process. Particularly notable is the distinctionRitual in Gnosticism13766So also Plotinus Enn.6.7.34.8."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"between Sethian texts that portray the advent of salvation as brought fromabove to below by the supreme Mother and those that portray it as theresult of a self-actualized contemplative ascent. To be sure, a divine reve-lation showing the path is required; Allogenes is still dependent on divinepowers like Youel and the luminaries of the Aeon of Barbelo to reveal tohim the way of ascent, yet once he receives the revelation, he makes theascent in an unaided fashion. Of course, in almost all texts that portray anascent to the supreme One, gnostic and Platonic alike, the final vision ofthe One is ultimately vouchsafed. Nevertheless, the salvific goal seems toinvolve the transfer of one’s inner essence from below to above, ratherthan conjuring the manifestation of the divine powers here below. Vividmanifestations of divine beings occur in the gnostic texts, yet they areuninvoked, free manifestations of the divine unrelated to any causal con-nection or affinities innate to the created realm and usually are witnessedby august figures who themselves have a heavenly origin (Seth, Jesus) orby figures who are singled out by divine choice (Zostrianos, Marsanes,Allogenes, Thomas and other disciples of Jesus). Salvation is achieved bythe return of the soul to its original state, not by a rectification of the phys-ical world it has come to inhabit or by a final overthrow of antidivine pow-ers. This is not merely to repeat the old adages about the anticosmicismand antisomaticism often ascribed to the gnostics, many of whom valuedcorporeality as a vehicle of revelation.67138John D. Turner67Cf. the veneration of the visible Jesus in the Valentinian Gospel of TruthandGospel of Philip,in the “Carpocratian” Marcellina’s worship of Christ’s image (Ire-naeus Haer.1.25.6), and Zostrianos’s willing postascensional readoption and invig-oration of his “image” so as to preach the truth (NHC VIII,1130,5–9). Indeed,according to the Gospel of Philip(77,2–6), “the holy person is completely holy, evenincluding his body. Taking up bread, he makes it holy, as also the cup or anythingelse that he takes up and sanctifies. Then how will he not sanctify the body too?”To be sure, one can find anticosmic passages, particularly in the earlier Sethiantexts, yet in this corpus one also finds Marsanes at the conclusion of his ascent say-ing “<I have come to know> in detail the entire realm of incorporeal being, and<I> have come to know the intelligible world. <I have come to know>, while delib-erating, that in every respect the sense-perceptible world is [worthy] of being savedentirely” (NHC X,15,19–26). The demiurgic activity of the divine Autogenes in Allo-genes(NHC XI,351,25–35), by which he rectifies the defects of nature, likewiseaffirms the value of the cosmos without overlooking its problematic nature (whichPlatonists, including theurgists like Iamblichus, also recognized). Late Sethian ritual,such as the sexual rites of the Borborites, is ambiguous: on the one hand, the unre-strained practice of intercourse seems affirmative of bodily existence, yet the prac-tice of coitus interruptusand consuming the aborted and mangled bodies ofaccidentally conceived fetuses is certainly a denial of the value of bodily life. Realcontempt for the body arises mostly in the encratite movement with which"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Ritual in Gnosticism139Because of the wide variation of gnostic attitude and implementation,the relation of gnostic ritual to later Platonic, especially theurgical, ritualcannot be simply characterized. It cannot be said that one is fundamentallybased on biblical motifs and the other on Platonic concepts. Although thetheurgists do not seem to employ the myth of the primal androgyne, evengiven its fundamental significance for gnostic myth and ritual, it cannot besaid that all gnostics employed it. Nor can it be said that one is anticosmicwhile the other is procosmic, or that one is individualistic and noetic whilethe other is communal and dependent on revelation, or that the one is self-actualized while the other is divinely initiated.As stated in the introduction, it may be taken that theurgy is a ritualpractice in which embodied souls were brought into a sympathetic reso-nance with the divine Logoithat informed the natural world and that thesedivine powers were invoked to enter the phenomenal world in order toreveal their divine source. And yet, apart from an appeal to a Posidoniandoctrine of cosmic sumpaqeiva, that seems precisely the intent of the invo-cation of the numerous divine beings, the living water itself, and thosewho preside over it and the Name, and the receivers, guardians, and puri-fiers necessary to effectuate the Sethian baptismal rite. Indeed, it remainsthat ultimate salvation in both outlooks is ultimately a matter of revelationand divine initiative, for at the summit of all ritual and contemplativeeffort, the Supreme “suddenly” manifests itself, as both Plato and thegnostics discovered.Judas the Twin was associated; witness the uncompromising hatred of the bodyand its natural passions in the Book of Thomas the Contender:“Woe to you wholove intimacy with womankind and polluted intercourse with them! Woe to you inthe grip of your bodily faculties, for they will afflict you! Woe to you in the grip ofthe evil demons! Woe to you who beguile your limbs in the fire!” (NHC II,7144,91–94). And yet the underlying core of this text is an epitomeof Plato’s teach-ing on the transmigration of the soul gathered principally from the Phaedo, Phae-drus, Republic,and Timaeusthat has undergone a radical encratite reworking.Persons of this stripe would have no truck with Platonic theurgists who sought toembody the demiurgic powers of nature through ritual means. Any hint of cosmicsympathies and affinities would be attributed by them to demonic forces; theirs wasa dualism of absolute opposition, not mimetic dependence."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"PLATONISM ANDGNOSTICISM. THEANONYMOUSCOMMENTARYON THEPARMENIDES:MIDDLE ORNEOPLATONIC?Kevin CorriganUniversity of SaskatchewanFor the past hundred years and more, scholars have supposed that ananonymous commentary on Plato’s Parmenides,originally published by W.Kroll (1892), must be post-Plotinian. Suggestions for authorship haveranged from Porphyry to Plutarch of Athens and Proclus.1The present1The philosophical sophistication of the Commentaryand some elements of itstechnical vocabulary (particularly the use of the word u{parxi\") suggest that it is at thevery least post-Plotinian. For this reason B. Peyron (“Notizia d’un antico evangeliariobobbiese che in alcuni fogli palimpsesti contiene frammenti d’un greco tratato difilosofia,” Rivista di filologia e di istruzione classica1 [1873]: 53–71) supposed theauthor to be from the school of Alexandria, probably Proclus, while W. Kroll (“Einneuplatonischer Parmenides-kommentar in einem Turiner Palimsest,” RheinischesMuseum für Philosophie48 [1892]: 599–627) argued that the Commentarypresup-poses the thought of Iamblichus and should therefore be traced to the second half ofthe fourth century C.E. Kroll’s thesis was founded on the view that it was Iamblichuswho first introduced the term “life” in between “existence” and “thought” in order toestablish the triadic structure of the intelligible world, both vertically and horizontally.M. Wundt (“Platons Parmenides,” Tübinger Beiträge zur Altertumswissenschaft25[1935]: 24–26), while recognizing that traces of the triad already appear in Plotinusand Porphyry, eliminated Iamblichus and Syrianus as possible authors and suggestedPlutarch of Athens rather than Porphyry, with the proviso that a definitive identifica-tion could not be made, given the little we know. R. Beutler (“Plutarchos vonAthens,” PW 21:974–75), by contrast, directly assigned the authorship to Plutarch onthe grounds that the details of the interpretation of the Parmenidesin the Commen-taryare distinctively Plutarchan, though he admitted the important influence ofAlexander of Aphrodisias, Plotinus, and Porphyry (cf. also Evrard, “Le maître de Plu-tarque d’Athènes et les origines du néoplatonisme athénien,” L’Antiquité classique29 [1960]: 391–406). Later views, including those of D. P.

At the outset several different scenariosseemed possible and plausible: either Porphyry, or a pupil of Porphyry, orsomeone later still, could well have been the author of the Commentary.Nonetheless, it began to dawn upon me that a pre-Porphyrian authorshipwas more plausible than any other hypothesis, but only, of course, if onecould show that Pierre Hadot’s thesis, based as it is upon Plotinus as a ter-minus a quo,could be shown to be ill-founded.2So, among other things, Ihere argue that a pre-Plotinian authorship for the Commentaryshould notonly notbe ruled out, but ought to be taken seriously—and at least as seri-ously as Pierre Hadot’s thesis. However, the present work goes somewhatbeyond this, for it also argues that on the basis of all the positive evidenceit is most plausible to suppose (1) that the Commentarycould nothave beenwritten by Porphyry and that it must be earlier than Plotinus, (2) that theSethian gnostic texts3of the Nag Hammadi library, to which PorphyryCommentari[Firenze: L. S. Olschki, 1995], 63–202), have rejected Beutler’s thesiswhile arguing generally for a late date, in the case of Linguiti, for example, “un neo-platonico posteriore a Porfirio che abbia operate nel pieno del IV secolo” (91). Hadot(Porphyre et Victorinus[2 vols.; Paris: Études augustiniennes, 1968]), by contrast, hasshown that the triad existence-life-thought already plays an important role in Por-phyry’s thought and in his exegesis of the Chaldean Oracles,and he has traced theinfluence of similar ideas to those in the Commentaryin the works of Victorinus. Por-phyry, in fact, was reproached by Damascius for identifying the “Father” of the intel-lectual triad with the First “One,” and the author of the Commentaryhas a similar viewto Porphyry. Furthermore, the moments of the triad are not yet hypostatized as inIamblichus, but form parts of the unified, internal structure of intellect—a view that ismuch closer to Plotinus (see also n. 8 below).2P.

So I shall sim-ply summarize some of the major arguments in each part, adding suchdetail as is necessary.1. The Anonymous Commentaryon the Parmenides1) Hadot’s view is based, in large measure, upon an interpretation ofPlotinus and Porphyry.8For Porphyry, the One is the “Father” of the intel-lectual triad, Father-Power-Intellect, and thus the One becomes in a senseits “idea,” form, preexistence or pure indwelling unrestricted being. Thedoctrine of the Commentarypresupposes the Plotinian One and Intellectbut derives Intellect from the One in a way that is unfamiliar to Plotinus. Iargue that this is not the case. In many different ways—e.g., the doctrineof Intellect, the First One as “idea” of the Second One, the doctrine of “par-ticipation,” the distinction between infinitival and participial being, and theuse of triads—the Commentarycan be seen to be much closer to thethought of Plotinus and Amelius. Let me first take up some major points inthe interpretation of Plotinus by comparison with the Commentary:In Plotinus—as in Middle Platonism—the “One” is sometimes con-ceived as “Absolute Being” (unrestricted being or seeing) or real self, notonly in 6.8 [39], where Plotinus stresses the One’s positive, unrestrictedbeing as pure activity and free creative, selfhood, but also in more ortho-dox passages, against the background of a stricter negative theology. Forexample, 6.8 [39].14.42: kai; ga;r prwvtw\" aujto;\" kai; uJperovntw\" aujtov\"; 6.7[38].40.41: kaqaro;n de; o]n nohvsew\" eijlikrinw'\" ejstin o{ ejstin; 5.5 [32].9.13–15:w{ste e[sti kai; oujk e[sti, tw/' me;n mh; perievcesqai oujk ou\\sa, tw/' d jei\\nai panto;\"ejleuqevra oujdamou' kwluomevnh ei\\nai.9In 5.5 (32).7 (as elsewhere in the144Kevin Corrigan7Enn.5.1 [10].8.8See below Appendix I: “The Theses of Pierre Hadot on the Anonymous Par-menides Commentaryand Porphyry.”96.8 [39].14.42: “for he is primarily self and self beyond being”; 6.7 [38].40.41:“But being clear of thought it is purely what it is”; 5.5 [32].9.13–15: “so it is and is"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Enneads) intellect withdraws into itself and finds pure unalloyed selfhoodthere within, a selfhood that transcends duality and yet is problematic inthat it transcends all forms of determinate signification: “it was outside andagain not outside”; there is no “whence”: “it appears and does notappear.” This veiling of intellect from other things and its simultaneousself-gathering (ajpo; tw'n a[llwn kaluvya\" kai; sunagagw;n eij\" to; ei[sw) is avision of pure light, not “one in another” (i.e., accidental attribution) butaujto; kaq jeJauto; movnon kaqaro;n ejf! auJtou' ejxaivfnh\" fanevn.10Transcendentselfhood is, therefore, the intimate, self-dependent, but indwelling root ofall other selves. In the Commentarythe Second One substantializes itselfby participation in the First One, which is being for it, but the First Oneremains the ground of its being and identity.11On the question of self-substantiation, Plotinus is very close to this view,but that the First One is the ultimate ground of all identity is a fundamental(if ambiguous) part of Plotinus’s thinking. The transcendent One is oftenonly one step of discourse away (e.g., 6.3 [43].8.18–20; 9.3ff.; 11.25–27), theimplicit underpinning of the whole argument who, nevertheless, sometimesshines through explicitly. This is particularly true of significant parts of thegreat work on the omnipresence of being, “one and the same simultane-ously,” 6.4–5 [22–23]. At the beginning of 6.5 [22].1, for instance, Plotinusmakes the startling statement that all human beings spontaneously recognizethat the God in each and every one of us is one and the same. This can helpus, he suggests, to reflect upon the omnipresence of real being.12The prin-ciple upon which he bases this is Aristotle’s law of noncontradiction, whichPlotinus understands to be a law of intelligible identity13and which he holdsis prior to all particulars and even the first postulate of practical reason,which states that all things desire the good; for this latter principle is itselfPlatonism and Gnosticism145not; it is not because it is not in the grasp of anything, but because it is free fromeverything it is not prevented from being anywhere.” All translations of Plotinuswill be taken from the seven-volume Loeb edition by A. H. Armstrong, though theymay occasionally be adapted.105.5 [32].7: “But since Intellect must not see this light as external, we must goback again to the eye; this will itself sometimes know a light which is not the exter-nal, alien light, but it momentarily sees before the external light a light of its own,a brighter one....Just so Intellect, veiling itself from other things and drawing itselfinward,when it is not looking at anything will see a light, not a distinct light insomething different from itself, but suddenly appearing, alone by itself in inde-pendent purity,so that Intellect is at a loss to know whence it has appeared....”11P.

The two sets of fragments in the Commentaryhave a similarframework of reference, but they are also modeled, I suggest, uponanother principle to be found in Plotinus, and one thatmust surely havebeen essential to the pre-Plotinian Platonic tradition. The “First One” or“First God” must for Moderatus, or Numenius for that matter, remainimmobile and transcendent “in its own place.” But if the Second One isgenuinely to come from the First, then the transcendence of the First hasto be jeopardized when one comes to articulate what this derivationmeans. In other words, what is unthinkable in a universe of discoursethat proclaims the utter transcendence of the First One has to becomethinkable if the Second One emerges from the First One and if its beingremains grounded in That One.15The derivation-problems, therefore, inboth the Enneadsand the Commentaryare similar. In other words, Plot-inus’s doctrine of intellect is not unique to him. Plotinus too holds thatthis doctrine is not his own, and according to the testimony of Porphyry,he believed that Amelius sharedhis views.16What we see in Plotinus isnot a new list of innovative doctrines so much as an unusually creativeway of doing philosophy,that is, of thinking out problems of interpreta-tion, and problems of philosophy, by comparing problems andattempted solutions in a whole host of ancient texts (Plato, Aristotle, 146Kevin Corrigan146.5 [22].1.14-19: “For this one, proceeding to the others as far as, and in theway in which it can proceed, would appear as many and even, in a sense, be many;but the ancient nature and the desire of the good, that is of itself, leads to what isreally one, and every nature presses on to this, to itself. For this is the good....”15Cf. K. Corrigan, “Plotinus, Enneads5, 4 (7) 2 and Related Passages. A NewInterpretation of the Status of the Intelligible Object,” Hermes114.2 (1986):195–203; idem, “Amelius, Plotinus and Porphyry,” 989–90.16See Vit. Plot.18.13–14."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Stoics, etc.), but above all by coming up with a creative dialectical wayof thinking through these problems so that all of the underpinnings of areasonable solution become lucid. Plotinus is not a doctrine-maker, buta philosopher.17The logical order of generation too in the Commentaryis similar tothat in Plotinus.18In fragment 12, (1) the One is first utterly transcendent(104.23–25: ejpevkeina oujsiva\" kai; o[nto\"); it is neither determinate being norsubstance nor act (ejnevrgeia); yet (2) it is pure unrestricted activity (25–26:“but rather it acts and is itself pure activity,” ejnergei' de; ma'llon kai; to; ejn-ergei'n kaqarovn), i.e., not determinate act or noun-thing, but pure activity—(to; ei\\naiwith the infinitive form); so that (3) there is implicit dualitybetween infinitive and noun forms of “being” (“so that it is itself beingwhich is before being,” w{ste kai; aujto; to; ei\\nai to; pro; o[nto\"); and (4) thefull consequence is that the Second One by participating in this has fromit derived being (Ou| metasco;n to; <e{>na[llo ejx aujtou' e[cei ejkklinovmenon to;ei\\nai), which is what it means to participate in being (metevcein o[nto\"). Thecommentator then goes on to elaborate on this double meaning: “So thatbeing is double, the one preexists determinate being, while the other isthat which is led out from the One which is transcendent of determinatebeing and which is being in the absolute sense and like the idea of deter-minate being, in which by participating another One has come to be towhich is linked the being borne out from it” (106.29–35: $Wste ditto;n to;ei\\nai, to; me;n prou>pavrcei tou' o[nto\", to; de; o} ejpavgetai ejk tou' o[nto\" to; ajpov-luton kai; w{sper ijdeva tou' o[nto\", ou| metasco;n a[llo ti e}n gevgonen, w/| suvzu-gon to; ajp jaujtou' ejpiferovmenon ei\\nai).First, the idea that being is led out of the One itself to which is linkedanother “one” and the duality of intellect is thereby constituted is a fre-quent feature of Plotinian arguments (even if in these contexts other termsare substituted for mevqexi\"). In 5.3 [49].10 and 11, the state of “not yet beingintellect” is one of “prethinking” (pronoou'sa) and of touching (qig-gavnonto\"); in the development of thinking, it “explicates” (ejxelivttei), “willsplit itself” (dicavsei), so that “it comes out having taken something else initself and made it many” (ejxh'lqe de; a[llo labou'sa ejn aujth/' aujto; polu; poi-hvsasa10.41–11.8).Again in 5.5 [32].5.16-19 primary being “proceeded, so to speak, a lit-tle way from the One, but did not wish to go still further, but turnedinwards and took its stand there [e{sth] and became substance [oujsiva] andhearth [eJstiva] of all things.” Or in 5.6 [24].2, the One appears as an intelligible object not in the sense that it thinks, but rather in that it is Platonism and Gnosticism14717This is the assessment of both Plotinus (5.1 [10]) and Porphyry (Vit. Plot.14).18For the Commentary,see P. Hadot, Porphyre et Victorinus, 2:102–12."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"primarily substantial for something else to think it; but what thinks it can-not thinkit as the purely One; rather it has to reach out to it and “take andhold the intelligible object which it thinks” (2.11) (clearly a form close to“participation”). What characterizes intellect, however, is that the intelligi-ble object “is linked” (sunevzeuktai) inextricably with every intellect (3.8[30].9.8).19Second, the notion of an implicit duality emerging out of pure unity andbecoming established as the linking of a third “one” with a second “one” isclearly present in what appears to be a formulaic argument in Plotinusbased on the mevgista gevnhof Plato’s Sophistand perhaps also on a devel-opment of the concept of kivnhsi\"from Aristotle’s Physics.20The argumentoccurs in 6.7 [38].13.16–21 and runs as follows: “If a simple moves, it holdsthat alone,” Plotinus argues, “and either it is the same and has not pro-ceeded or, if it has proceeded, another remains, so that there are two.” Asfar as I can see, this first series of premises necessarily envisages (1) animmobile motion of super-motion; (2) a moment of identity based on sta-sis;and (3) a moment of burgeoning duality based on motion and other-ness.Plotinus continues: “And if ‘this’ is the same as ‘that,’ it remains andhas not gone forward; but if different, it has gone forth with difference andmade from something same and something different, a third One.” In thesecond part of the argument, Plotinus seems to suppose first a moment ofabidingness (monhv), now internal to the implicit duality uncovered in thefirst series of premises, and coupled with a second moment of subsequentprocession and autoconstitution. If this is correct, the whole argument func-tions as a series of disjuncts by which the total possible configuration of theemergence of a new duality is plotted.21As in the Commentary,Plotinusexplores the ambiguity of the traveling subject in the logic of generation, asubject that specifies itself and its whole structure in the course of the argu-ment. A similar argument appears in 6.2 [43].8: pure self-directed activity orseeing is not oujsiva; for oujsivato arise there has to be a division of itself intoto; ajf! ou|(i.e., The One, but as object for itself) and eij\" o{, and thus it splitsits suprasubstantial identity into “that” and “itself” and joins the two togetherin its movement (cf. 6.7 [38].39.2–9). As in the Commentary,so too in 6.7[38].13 and 6.2 [43].8, there is a highest moment of identity with the First(prior to implicit and then explicit conversion) that remains a necessaryfacet of the self-articulating subject whose fullest development as a second148Kevin Corrigan19Cf. 5.6 [24].2; 5.8 [31].4; etc.20On the importance of major items in Aristotle’s Physicsto Plotinus’s thought,see, for example, A.

Corrigan, “Amelius, Plotinus and Porphyry,” 990."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"principle is unspecified until the conclusion (cf. 5.3 [49].10.21–29). I suggestthat such arguments in Plotinus are quite likely already formulaic in theNeopythagorean tradition of deriving a dyad from a monad and that theyprovide a similar sort of context to compare with the argument in fragments11 to 14 of the Commentary.The context for this sort of reflection about the derivation of intel-lect that the commentator undertakes is familiar to the commentatorquite possibly from Plotinus,22but it is more plausible to suppose thatthe milieu for such reflections is pre-Plotinian, for Plotinus’s languageabout the procession and conversion of being is clearly not his owninvention and the idea that the First is transcendent while intellect’svision of the First as a duality is a function of the coyoking of intellectand intelligible object already has a formulaic ring to it even in Plotinus,as well it might, for the idea is already perfectly current in the ChaldeanOracles(even if the view of the Oraclesis ambiguous). The highestintelligible object, frg. 1 of the Oraclesinforms us, is transcendent andbeyond human thought: “you must not perceive it intently, but keepingthe pure eye of your soul turned away, you should extend an emptymind toward the Intelligible in order to comprehend it, since it existsoutside mind” (ejpei; novou e[xw uJpavrcei). One therefore has to grasp it bya form of nonknowing and by the “flower of mind” (novou a[nqei), that is,by the highest power of the soul akin to the apparently fiery essence ofthe First God. At the same time, according to frg. 20, “intellect does notexist without the intelligible, and the intelligible does not exist apartfrom intellect” (Ouj ga;r a[neu noov\" ejsti nohtou', kai; to; nohto;n ouj nou'cwri;\" uJpavrcei).Either these two fragments contradict each other23or the first refers tohuman cognition and the second to the ontological situation of the Ora-cles’Second Intellect.24The latter seems more plausible: these intelligibles,sown throughout the cosmos, frg. 108 informs us, are “inexpressible beau-ties” (kavllh a[frasta) from the perspective of human cognition; from theperspective of the Second Intellect, intelligible object and subject are nec-essarily linked together.If we now turn to the locus classicusin Plotinus for the derivation ofintellect from the One, we can see at a glance that even here the structureis similar to that of the Commentary.In 5.2 [11].1.7–9, (1) the One is soperfect (2) that it overflows and (3) its superabundance has madePlatonism and Gnosticism14922See ibid., 991–93.23Cf.

Yetthis too is an implicit part of Plotinus’s theory. Ta; o[ntaare the determinateentities that constitute intellect and, from one perspective, to; o[nis the firstdeterminate moment of intellect’s own being (cf. 6.6 [34].8). By contrast,the One is beyond oujsivaor o[n. The One is pure unrestricted, infinitivalbeing: the One’s to; ei\\naiis not a determinate activity but an acting, cre-ative power which comes by and from itself (cf. 6.8 [39].33ff.), in whichwhat it is to be (essence) and pure being (existence) are one.28From thisperspective, the first moment of what intellect will be is coincident withthe infinitival being of the One, but distinct because it will culminate inintellect. Otherwise, as Plotinus quite often claims, there would be no dis-tinction.29I shall return briefly to this question (see items 4 and 5 of part2 below) because it bears upon Hadot’s claim that there is no distinctionbetween essence and existence in Plotinus and that the rudimentary begin-nings of such a distinction are to be found in the Commentary.30This isin fact not true. Here, however, I wish to make a smaller claim, namely,that the background to an infinitive-being and a participial-being distinc-tion is an implicit but necessary part of Plotinus’s theory of derivation.

However, for intellect, it is thehighest defined object that constitutes its intellectual being. Plotinus’s“light-metaphysic” is perhaps the simplest example of this.31Light is dif-ferent from the form and cause of the form’s being seen, but it is seen “in”and “upon” the form (5.5 [32].7.1–6). Even when it is grasped intuitively onits own without an accompanying object, it is seen because it is foundedupon something else (ibid., 8–9). Only when it is alone (mh; pro;\" eJtevrw/)does it escape perception. Light, pure seeing, or transcendental identity ofsubject and object, is pure unity itself. Light “based” (ejpereidovmenon, 5.5[32].7.9) on another is “being.” In itself it is supra-intelligible, but for intel-lect it is substance (5.6 [24].2.8–10). As Plotinus argues in 6.2 [43].8.14–18,purely self-directed activity is not oujsiva, but being (o[n) constitutes the ter-mini, thus constituting the unity in distinctness of the two:For its self-directed activity is not substance, but being is that to which theactivity is directed and from which it comes: for that which is looked at isbeing, not the look [to; ga;r blepovmenon to; o[n, oujc! hJ blevyi\"]; but the looktoo possesses being [to; ei\\nai] because it comes from and is directed tobeing [o[n]. And since it is in act, not in potency, it gathers the two together[sunavptei] and does not separate them, but makes itself that and that itself.Pure light or the unrestricted activity of the One coincides, as it were,with purely self-directed activity, that is, not activity as a determinate actbut pure creative effulgence (as we also find in the Commentary), whichgives rise to an indefinite duality that the power of the One is in ittomake substance (cf. 5.1 [10].6–7).32This purely self-directed activity thatPlatonism and Gnosticism15131See generally R.

This moment,however, as objectof Intellect’s own seeing is determinate being (to; o[n)which embraces the determinate content (ta; o[nta) of Intellect’s plural-izing vision. The roots then of the distinction between determinatebeing or beings and unrestricted being or activity are certainly to befound in Plotinus, and this distinction is not simply between intellectand the One, but there is an indeterminateness like the One at the ori-gin of intellect that is notthe indeterminateness simply of the substrate:intelligible matter.34One further item in the Commentaryis worth picking out: the One asthe “idea of being” and the question of a participation of the intelligibleworld in both the First One and in what is effectively the highest momentof itself. Both of these items are not only Plotinian but recognizably Mid-dle Platonic. In Plotinus, the One appears as the limit (pevra\") of intellec-tual beauty (6.7 (38).32.34), and since the limit of intellect is also the ijdevaejn stavsei(6.2 (43).8.23–25),35the commentator’s w{sper ijdeva tou' o[nto\"—if post-Plotinian—is hardly innovative. In Numenius, the First Intellect oraujtoavgaqonis the “idea” of the Second Intellect or demiurge because thelatter is good by participation in the first. So this apparently Porphyrianinnovation is decidedly Middle Platonic.In other words, Hadot’s thesis is not a necessary or the best interpretationof the evidence. Let me now take up the other major remaining points in turn.2) Nothing prevents the so-called Plotinian Structure—One/Intel-lect/Soul—and the interpretation of the Parmenidesassociated with it frombeing Middle Platonic, as Plotinus tells us it is (in Enn.5.1 [10]).

On balance, itis reasonable to suppose that some form of relatively continuous “meta-physical” interpretation of the Parmenidesand other dialogues (e.g.,Theaetetus) is older still. Surely, for instance, the system of Speusippusrequires such an interpretive foundation.413) The Commentaryespouses a (somewhat obscure) participation ofthe Second One in the First One, which amounts to a participation bydeveloping intelligible reality in the highest idea of itself. Syrianus and Pro-clus make it clear that according to Porphyry there was only onepartici-pation—of aijsqhtavin intelligible reality, whereas in Numenius, Cronius,Amelius, and Plotinus there is also an intellectual participation.42So if theCommentaryholds a similar “Middle” Platonic view, namely, an intellec-tual participation, then it cannotbe by Porphyry.4) In addition, there is one further feature of the Commentarythat, inmy view, necessitates a date earlier than Porphyry.

So the Anonymous Commentarycannothave been written by Porphyry, but the most reasonable interpretation of theevidence is that the fragments of the Commentarywe possess were a com-mon source both for the gnostics and for Plotinus, Amelius, and Porphyry(which does not automatically preclude further “exchanges of ideas” or fur-ther redactions of the gnostic texts we now possess).

Plotinus and the Sethian Gnostic TextsIn part 2 of my original paper, I went on to develop a differentapproach to the problems of these texts in order to determine what rela-tion there might be between the Commentary,Sethian gnostic texts, Mid-dle Platonism, and Neoplatonism. Here I shall give a brief summary of part2. I argued for the plausibility of the following theses: (1) that the Sethiangnostic texts (Allogenesand Zostrianos,in particular) are dependent uponthe Commentaryrather than vice versa; (2) that we need a much widerview of Middle Platonism than has been hitherto supposed; that in MiddlePlatonism, especially Numenius, Albinus, even Amelius, one of the hiddenproblems of Timaeus-interpretation, possibly prompted by gnostic attacksand appropriation of Plato, was the development of a prefigurative intelli-gible biology within which the interpretation of Aristotelian thought in theservice of Plato started to figure more prominently; (3) that this trend, evi-dent in the Commentaryand to a lesser extent in the existence-essence dis-tinctions in the Sethian gnostic texts, led to a new and much moredeveloped distinction between essence and existence in Plotinus; (4) thatthis Plotinian distinction is to be related in the first place (i.e., chronologi-cally) to the Großschriftas a whole and that it most likely presupposes (a)the more rudimentary version of the triadic distinction of the Commentaryand (b) the more varied version of the Sethian gnostic texts; and finally (5)that important elements in the structure of the Großschriftpresuppose sig-nificant motifs, images, and ideas in the Sethian gnostic texts (e.g., qewriva,fuvsi\", the intelligible earth-sky-air motif, etc.). My view of the Großschriftis that the first three treatises prepare for and contextualize the overt cri-tique of 2.9 [33].Let me sum up several of the more important matters in turn:1) First, a comparison between AllogenesXI,348,6–49,37 (and alsoZost.64,7–75,11) and fragments 13–14 of the Commentarydemonstratesthat these texts are dependent upon the Commentaryor its equivalent (for the ultimate provenance of the thought must be Platonic-Pythagorean, given the emergence of a second One as an indefinitemovement that by conversion knows both itself and its principle).156Kevin Corrigan"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"2) Second, in Albinus, Numenius, the Anonymous Commentary,Chaldean Oracles,and Amelius, there appears to be a growing interest inthe problem of how being, life, and thought (from both Platonic and Aris-totelian viewpoints) come to be prefiguratively articulated in an eternallyactual intellect in such a way that the natural compounds of our experi-ence (architects and artisans) bear that intelligible imprint at the very rootof their own creativity.52A similar process is clearly also at work in theNeopythagorean linking of monad and triad to the Aristotelian dynamis-hexis-entelechyprogression.53We find elements of this Aristotelian andPlatonic language in both the Commentaryand the Sethian gnostic texts,but the triadic schemata of the former are relatively simple, set out in serialsuccession, whereas in the latter they are more complex; there are inter-linking moments such as we find in Amelius and a greater variety and pro-liferation of triads, an indication that the Sethian gnostics are workinginnovatively with an earlier Platonic text or texts and with what they taketo be, at least, a shared tradition. In Plotinus again, there is a more devel-oped form of triadization or the linking of duvnami\"and ejnevrgeia, for Plot-inus is not concerned with schemata but with the linking of the generativeprocess and the dynamic nature of a hypostasis by means of a singlethought pattern, which articulates the complexity of the hypostasis.54Platonism and Gnosticism15752See below Appendix V: “Numenius and Amelius.”53The process of Aristotle-interpretation starts long before Plotinus, and therewere presumably many forces at work in its inception, not least, one might hope,open-mindedness. As early as the second century C.E. in the Platonic-Pythagoreantradition, some sort of Aristotle-interpretation is clearly at work (if the terminologyof later testimonies can be trusted) in the equivalence of monav\"to potency/seed/power and trivgwnonor triad to ejntelevceia/fully realized activity. Theon ofSmyrna, a Platonist of the early second century, argues that the monad is said tobe triangular not kata; ejntelevceiabut kata; duvnamin, for as the seed (spevrma) of allnumbers, the monad possesses a triaform power (trigwnoeidh' duvnamin) (Exp.37.15–18 Hiller). His contemporary, Nichomachus of Gerasa, expresses a similarview: i{na kai; trivgwno\" dunavmei faivnhtai hJ monav\", ejnergeiva/ de; prw'to\" oJ gæ(Arith.Intro. 2.8, p. 88, 9–10 Hoche).546.7 [38].17 argues that intellect’s life is the trace of the giver, which “shinesout” from the One as “manifold and unbounded” (17.20–21: pollh'\" kai; ajpeivrouou[sh\", wJ\" a]n para; toiauvth\" fuvsew\" ejklamyavsh\"). It was (h\\n) indefinite in so far asit lookedto That (blevpousa), but in so far as it had looked(blevyasa) it became lim-ited in itself without implying any limit in the One. The tenses, imperfect, present,and aorist, are an interesting and typical feature of Plotinian discourse (e.g. 6.7[38].16.31–35; 4.8 [6].1.1–11, etc.), which tends to distinguish phases or moments inthe complex generation of intellect by use of different tenses (often within a sin-gle, interlacing sentence) rather than by serial representation (such as we find inthe Commentary). The effect is a sort of stereoscopic picture rather than a serial,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"3) Third, in 6.7 [38].1–42, Plotinus develops a new and highly subtledistinction between essence and existence (or determinate and unrestrictedbeing), one that will surely help to determine and shape all subsequentthought on this question, but one that links together over the course ofsome forty chapters (a) the Aristotelian Nous with dynamis-entelechythe-ory,55(b) a prefigurative intelligible biology in relation to the Timaeusandgnostic claims about the making of the world,56(c) the hyper-intelligiblesignificance of ordinary things (e.g., breathing, existing, desiring, loving,living, etc.),57and (d) the different extensions of being, life, and thought.58This distinctive Plotinian view about existence and life forms an integralpart of Proclus’s approach in his own Commentary on the Parmenides59but is conspicuously lacking from the anonymous Commentary.Had thiscommentary been written by Porphyry, it is impossible to believe that sucha theory would have been absent.4) Fourth, this later essence-existence distinction is foreshadowed sig-nificantly (and for the first time in the Enneads) in 3.8 [30].9 and 5.5 [32].12of the Großschrift,and in both cases there is a certain resonance withgnostic thought. For Plotinus—at least in part by contrast with some158Kevin Corriganplanispheric representation. A particularly good example is 6.7 [38].16.20–21:plhrwqei;\" mevn, i{n je[ch/, o} o[yetai. It is worth noting that this technique, particularlythat of the single interlacing sentence, runs right through the Enneads.The early5.2 [11].1.7–13, effectively a single sentence, unites all the moments of generationin one complex thought process. By contrast, the approach in the anonymousCommentaryis less subtle and more seriatim,which is a further indication that theCommentaryis pre-Plotinian. By and large, Plotinus avoids schematic triads, for heis concerned to link the generative process and the dynamic nature of a hyposta-sis by means of a single thought pattern that articulates the complexity of thehypostasis. For a different reason I date the Platonizing Sethian gnostic texts afterthe Commentary.The triadic schema of the Commentaryis relatively simple, andboth major versions of it (Existence-Life-Thought/Being-Vitality-Mentality) clearlyrelate to Middle Platonic preoccupations as evinced particularly in Albinus, theChaldean Oracles,and the Neopythagoreans. In the Sethian gnostic texts, there issome evidence of the same sort of linking of moments we have found in Amelius(see especially Zost.VIII 15,1–20; 17,1–5; cf. Chald. Or.frg. 4), and in addition thereis much more variety and proliferation of triads, an indication that the Sethian gnos-tics are working innovatively, and according to the already established gnosticmanner, with an earlier Platonic tradition.55See 6.7 [38].40 and generally K.

In other words,Plotinus wants to repudiate the view that there is an essentially intelligibleform orsource of ignorance (at least in this content) (cf. 5.2 [11].1; 6.2 [43].8; 6.7 [38].16)but at the same time to provide a plausible explanation for anyone who can under-stand why people have supposed that an ignorant Demiurge or fallen Sophiaarein some sense responsible for the ugliness of this world. This betrays a deeper andmore comprehensive form of dialogue. Polemic is only a small part of this deepercritique, which wishes to show to the potential or implicit participant what the sup-posed meaning of his apparent philosophical beliefs and motives actually is. Thegnostics might well be a group with whom one cannot have any sort of genuineconversation, and yet if they could be brought to question their own views, theywould see why their present beliefs are inadequate yet at the same time plausible.To grasp the inadequacy of what one thinks and yet simultaneously to understandhow one could have held such views is to have developed a more subtle and com-prehensive view of reality and to be capable of living in a “bigger” world. In thissense, I think, while Plotinus’s direct address in the first three treatises of theGroßschriftexcludes the gnostics, the wider scope of the subtext itself implicitlyincludes them."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"160Kevin Corriganinter aliaa whole range of gnostic doctrines in mind here, and amongthem some of the Sethian gnostic texts mentioned by Porphyry.5) Fifth, is this too subtle an interpretation of Plotinus? Not accordingto Hadot’s own view of Plotinus’s condensed, allusive interpretation of theTheogony myth, for example.66Furthermore, the levels of direct and indi-rect addressee are plainly to be uncovered in the text, and Plotinus’s cre-ative use of Aristotle at important moments (how he thinks through anAristotelian problem in his own creative way) is perfectly demonstrable.67So which comes first?—Sethian gnostic texts or the Großschrift?In myview, comparisons of the descriptions of the “living earth” in ZostrianosandAllogenesand Enn.5.8.3–4, and of the “three-men” theories in the gnostictexts and in Enn.6.7 [38].6–7, show as closely as one is going to get thatthe gnostic versions are not based on Plotinus, for nothing of Plotinus’s realthought appears in those texts.68In other words, I suggest that in theseworks Plotinus—with the gnostics (and other Platonists) in mind—wants toshow that even if we accept Platonic world-renunciation, the shadow-beingof sensible things, and the call to ascend from things here, this does notcommit us to the dead ranks of the unsaved, lost in the abyss of the sensi-ble world, or to a spectacular, but external-Hollywood landscape of theelite, liberated, psychic human being. Liberation has to start from where oneactually is situated, and the intrinsic connectedness of the physical humanbeing with the higher levels of one’s being, and even with the totality ofintellect, must be a function, first, of the way one has been made, second,of one’s proper definition, and, third, of one’s present being.So, I see the Großschriftas, in part, reacting to details in one or moreof the Sethian texts (among other forms of Gnosticism) rather than theother way round, and I suggest that were it not for the challenge of Gnos-ticism to be an authentic interpreter of Plato and Aristotle, as well as of themyths that are so profound a part of the Dialogues,we might not have hadthe spectacular course of philosophical inventiveness we in fact do havein the middle to late Enneads,at least not in the form we now have them,showing as they do the simplicity and beauty of even the most ordinaryand taken-for-granted, physical things.My conclusion then is (1) that the Anonymous Commentarycan-not be ascribed to Porphyry but must be pre-Plotinian, probably of66P.

According to Hadot, Porphyry initiated the attempt to interpretand harmonize the teaching of Plotinus with the “divine revelation” of theChaldean Oracles.1Like Numenius later, the Oraclesrecognize the existence of twointellects: a contemplative First Intellect or Father and a dyadic Second Intellect,both contemplative and demiurgic.2The Oraclesdescribe these intellects in Stoi-cizing Middle Platonic terms as “fiery” in nature and situated in a transcendentempyreanrealm (Chald. Or.frgs. 3, 5, 6, and 10 Majercik). There is also a thirdprinciple, a feminine Power (duvnami\") that links the Father Intellect and the Intel-lect fully actualized that emerges from him: “For power is with him [su;n ejkeivnw/],but Intellect is from him [ajp! ejkeivnou]” (Chald. Or.frg. 4).On the basis of this oracle, the later Neoplatonists—beginning with Por-phyry3—found in the Oraclesa primal triad of Father-Power-Intellect in accordancewith the three-in-one principle or triadic monad operative in every ordering (frg.27: “For in every world shines a triad, ruled by a monad”; cf. frg. 22) and in the tri-adic ordering of the Platonic ideas (frg. 22: “For the Intellect of the Father said forall things to separate into three. . . ”). The triad, existence (u{parxi\")-power-intellectdoes not occur explicitly in the extant fragments, although Damascius frequentlyattributes such a triad to the Oracles(Dub. et sol.2.3.5–6; 2.36.2–6; 2.71.1–6 West-erink and Combès). Consequently, Hadot suggests the strong possibility that theword u{parxi\"was already a substitute for pathvrin the Oracles.4Although the exis-tential use of u{parxi\"and uJpavrceinoccurs in Stoic, Epicurean, and Middle PlatonicPlatonism and Gnosticism1611Hadot, Porphyre et Victorinus,1:482–85.2Numenius frg. 18 des Places (Numénius: Fragments[Collection des Universitésde France; Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1973]); Chaldean Oracles,frg. 7 Majercik (TheChaldean Oracles: Text, Translation, and Commentary[Studies in Greek andRoman Religion 5; Leiden: Brill, 1989]).3De regressu an.36.15–19; 38.7–10 Bidez; Hadot, Porphyre et Victorinus,2:96 n. 2.4Hadot, Porphyre et Victorinus,1:267 n. 7."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"162Kevin Corriganusage as well as in Plotinus, the technical usage is to be attributed to Porphyry,who uses the term in the Parmenides Commentaryto signify the idea of pure,unrestricted being prior to substance or oujsiva, i.e, determinate, substantial being.5This usage is also to be found in Marius Victorinus, where it is translated by theLatin word exsistentiato distinguish it from substantia.6Since exsistentiais notattested in Latin before Victorinus, then it is most likely to be attributed to Por-phyry’s philosophical usage. For Porphyry, then, u{parxi\"as pure unrestricted beingwas equivalent both to the Plotinian One and the Chaldean Father, and the resultwas a coordination of the two triads at the level of the First Hypostasis: Father-Power-Intellect and Existence-Life-Intellect.7So according to frg. 9.1–8 of the Com-mentary,Porphyry interprets frg. 3 of the oracles (“the Father snatched himselfaway and did not enclose his own fire in his intellectual power”) to mean thatalthough the One “has snatched himself away from all that is within him, never-theless his power and intellect remain co-unified in his simplicity.” This Porphyr-ian solution results in a conception of the Chaldean First God as a three-in-onedeity and was very congenial later to both Synesius and Marius Victorinus, but itwas rejected by all later Neoplatonists who located the Chaldean triad beneath anutterly transcendent One.8According to Proclus, Porphyry was the first to givethese triads a formal structure on the basis—at least in part—of his reflection uponthe Oracles(In Tim.3.64.8–65.8).This provides an overview of the context of Hadot’s view. On what principlesprecisely is his assessment of Porphyry’s authorship of the Commentaryfounded?As we have seen in part, the fragments of the Commentaryexpress, for Hadot, adoctrine more in line with Porphyrian than Plotinian metaphysics. According toPorphyry, the One is the “Father” of the intellectual triad, Father-Power-Intellect,and thus the One becomes in a sense its “idea” form, preexistence, or pureindwelling unrestricted being. This dual nature of the One—transcendent and yetimmanent—is to be found in the earlier fragments of the Commentaryin which,while there is an emphasis upon the One’s transcendence and the superiority ofnegative theology over positive affirmations about God, the One is also “the onlytrue being” (to; movnon o[ntw\" o[n) and everything apart from the One is unreal.9TheOne is even “really itself” (o[ntw\" eJautov\") (Abst.3.27.226.16; 1.29.107.7, 8 Nauck).5Ibid., 1:112–13; 267ff.6Ar.3.7.9 in ibid., 2:29, text 40; cf. also Calcidius In Tim.289.3 and C.

The One-Being is said to be inone sense identical with the One, in another not. For as a product and image ofthe One it has something of the One’s nature; but as a One-Being it is no longerpurely “One.”10A particularly difficult statement from Plato’s Parm.142b, “if theOne is, it participates in Being [oujsiva],” is interpreted to mean that the One in itspure activity is itself Being (to; ei\\nai) prior to determinate being (pro; tou' o[nto\").Here the commentator introduces the celebrated distinction between unrestricted,infinitival being (to; ei\\nai), that is, the article with the infinitive of the Greek verb,and determinate, participial being (to; o[n), that is, the article with the neuter par-ticipial form of the verb to express being as a determinate or dependent entity.11In this relation, the One becomes the idea of the Second One; in Hadot’s words, itbecomes “sa pré-existance, son être et, puisque le second Un est l’Étant, le premierUn devient l’Être absolu, conçu comme un pur agir qui engendre la Forme.”12AsHadot sees it, this new development, so foreign to Plotinus, helps to reconcile theabsolutely simple Plotinian First Principle with the First God of the Oracles,whocontains within Him a preexistent Power and Intellect (see above on Oraclesfrg.3), and this development is supplemented by a distinction between two states ofintellect (a rudimentary form of which we find already in Numenius), one in whichintellect is perfectly unified and another in which it is explicitly deployed as theintellectual triad, existence/u{parxi\"–life/zwhv–thought/novhsi\".13As we haveobserved above, the first of these states is beyond the subject-object distinction andis identical with the First One. The second is no longer one and simple except inits first moment, pure existence, in which it is identical with the One itself.14Nowwhile both Plotinus and Porphyry posit two states of intellect, corresponding toNumenius’s First and Second Intellect-Gods, the difference, according to Hadot, isthat in Plotinus these states are never intended to explain the generation of intel-lect, whereas in Porphyry “il s’agit de montrer que l’Intelligence pré-existe dansl’Un avant de se distinguer de lui.”15Hadot even goes so far as to claim that Por-phyry did not understand Plotinian doctrine or that he took the impression thatPlotinus and the Oracleswere teaching the same thing under different formulas.16For Hadot, moreover, the distinction between to; ei\\naiand to; o[ninvolves twotranspositions that are altogether characteristic of Porphyry: first, a transposition ofthe Stoic relation between u{parxi\"and uJpovstasi\", and second, a transposition of theAristotelian distinction between the being of a thing and the thing itself. Accordingto the former, the Stoic understanding of u{parxi\"as belonging to the incorporeal,10Hadot, Porphyre et Victorinus,vol. 2, frg. 9.98.7–9)11Ibid., frgs. 9–12, 98–108.12Ibid., 1:484.13Ibid., vol. 2, frgs. 13–14.14Ibid., vol. 2, frg. 14.110.5–111.3415Ibid., 1:484.16Ibid., 1:482–83."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"predicative order, and dependent upon the ontological fullness of substance, is trans-posed into the transcendent preexistence that u{parxi\"now signifies. According to thelatter, the opposition in Aristotle is one between the concept of a thing and its con-crete reality. This is now transposed into a new Platonic understanding in which theconcept becomes the existential predicate defining the essence of the thing.17Con-sequently, in Hadot’s assessment, the distinction between to; ei\\naiand to; o[nin Por-phyry does not yet signify a full distinction between essence and existence so muchas a new step on the road to such a distinction, and one that points to the discoveryof Being “comme actualité transcendante.”18Porphyry, therefore, according to this account, seems to be the only candidatefor authorship of the Commentary.But why does the Commentaryhave to be post-Plotinian? There are several fundamental reasons why Hadot thinks that this is theonly reasonable interpretation of the evidence. First, it must be post-Plotinianbecause it presupposes the Plotinian doctrine of the One. The principle that guidesthe exegesis of the Parmenidesis in accord with Plotinian thought. In particular,the correspondence between the first hypostasis (The One) and the first hypothe-sis (of the Parmenides), and the second hypostasis (Intellect) and the secondhypothesis is characteristic of Plotinian Parmenides-interpretation.19Second, theCommentary’sdoctrine of intellect presupposes that of Plotinus insofar as the com-mentator seems to paraphrase a passage on pure thought from Enn.6.9 [9].6 aswell as to depend on hints in Plotinus of a state of intelligence in which this tran-scends itself and coincides with the One;20but at the same time Porphyry goesmuch further than this and tends to distinguish “two intelligences”: “Il semble bienque Porphyre ait voulu, par cette doctrine, rendre compte de la procession de l’In-telligence, en faisant coincider avec l’Un l’Intelligence ‘qui ne peut rentrer en elle-même,’ pour marquer ensuite fortement la continuité entre cette Intelligenceoriginelle et l’Intelligence en acte, qui s’engendre elle-même comme Intelli-gence.”21Third, while Plotinus in Enn.6.9 [9].6 does not affirm that the One is purethought, Porphyry supposes an absolute, simple, transcendent knowing that has noobject and which is identical to the One itself.22Fourth, the commentator uses thebeing-life-thought triad to describe the dynamic process of Intellect’s “autoposition”in a way that is clearly post-Plotinian insofar as this derives from Plotinus’s doctrineof the internal identity of subject and object, a unity-in-duality, which springs fromintellect’s contemplation of the One itself.23For these fundamental reasons, there-fore, Hadot places the date of the Commentarybetween 270 C.E. and the first halfof the fifth century: the Commentarypresupposes the Plotinian doctrine of the One164Kevin Corrigan17Ibid., 1:487–90.18Ibid., 1:493.19Ibid., 1:104.20Ibid., 1:122–24, 134; cf.

At the top of Porphyry’smetaphysical system there was an ennead or three triads, each designated u{parxi\"-duvnami\"-nou'\", expressing the transition from the One to Intellect. In the first triad,equated with the One, u{parxi\"predominates, while duvnami\"and nou'\"are implicitor virtual. In the second triad, which represents the moment of unlimited move-ment away from the One, duvnami\"predominates, and in the third triad there is thereturn and definition of nou'\"as such. According to Hadot, the members of thisEnneadwere also identified with various entities from the Chaldean Oracles.25Appendix IIIntellectual Participation in the Anonymous Parmenides Commentary,Plotinus (and Numenius and Amelius), but Not in PorphyryOn this question, what Syrianus (In Metaph.109.21ff. Kroll) and Proclus (InTim.248e–249b = 3.33.31ff.) appear to deny to Porphyry is not a participation ofintellect in the One but a participation of the intelligibles in the ideas. At first sight,the Commentarywould seem only to espouse a participation in the First One, nota participation of intelligible reality in itself. Closer inspection, however, yields adifferent picture. True it is, as Hadot indicates, that the commentator offers two dif-ferent explanations of participation without attempting to reconcile them (some-thing characteristic of Porphyry), namely, that the phrase “the one participates insubstance” means, first, that the One is mingled (sunhlloivwtai) with substance and,second, that the second One participates in being which is the First One.1Nonethe-less, according to the latter interpretation, the Second One receives being from theidea of being which is the First One, which is to say that participation in the FirstOne is simultaneously participation in the generative idea of intellect which is thefirst moment of intellect’s own being; and this is surely to make the equivalentclaim that determinate being or beings participate in the highest object of their ownvision, i.e., the ideas quaunified in the Good. Thus, the commentator tells us thatsuch participation is not participation in a “one,” but in a one “participating inbeing (to; o[n), not because the first was being [o[n], but because an otherness fromthe One has turned it around to this whole one-being” (104.17–20). Thus, by par-ticipating in the idea of itself “another one has come to be to which is yoked toPlatonism and Gnosticism16524Cf. ibid., 1:124ff., 482–83.25Ibid., 1:361–75.1Hadot, Porphyre et Victorinus,vol. 2, frgs. 11–12, 98–106."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"the being borne out from it” (106.33–35). All of this is not very clear—which is avery good reason for supposing that it is more primitive than Plotinus, who despiteconsiderable obscurities is generally far less oracular; but it seems much closer toNumenius’s notion of participation or even that of Amelius, both of whom intro-duce participation into the intelligible world (Numenius frg. 16 [metousiva/] desPlaces). The second Intellect “participates” in the First or, according to Syrianus, theintelligible participates in the highest ideas.However, elements in Plotinus’s thought suggest a similar participation. At 6.5[23].4.17–24 to; metevconparticipates both in the One and in to; met! aujtov. That Plot-inus is thinking of intelligible reality is confirmed by the “first, seconds, and thirds”(ta; o[nta) “in the intelligible” in the line immediately following and by the circleanalogy of chapter 5, in which each radius is an extension of its center in all thecenters (6.5 [23].4.17–24: “For even if we may be talking about something else afterthe One itself, this again will be together with the One itself and what is after it [to;met! aujtou'] will be around that One and directed to that One and like somethinggenerated from it in close touch with it, so that what participates in what comesafter it has also participated in that One [to; metevcon tou' met jaujto; kajkeivnou meteilh-fevnai]. For, since there are many things in the intelligible, firsts and seconds andthirds, and they are linked like one sphere to its one center, not disparted by dis-tances, but all existing together with themselves, wherever the thirds are present,the seconds and firsts are present as well” (cf. 6.5 [23].5 passim). Similarly in 6.6[34].10.13–15, the sentence “when number already existed the things which cameto be participated in the ‘so many’” (metevsce ta; genovmena tou' tosau'ta) is difficult,but ta; genovmenain this context must refer to all beings, sensible and intelligible,for the focus of the discussion has been upon the movement of essential numberfrom unity to multiplicity among real beings (and so tosau'taat lines 10, 12, 13 isspecified by ta; o[ntaat line 9 and ai[tio\" prowvnat line 13): “If then they are not asmany as they are just casually, number is a cause which preexists their being somany: that is, it was when number already existed that the things which came tobe participated in the ‘so many’ [metevsce ta; genovmena tou' tosau'ta], and each ofthem participated in the ‘one’ so that it might be one” (e\\kaston me;n tou' e}n metevs-cen, i{na e}n h/\\). Again, in 6.7 [38].32.30ff., intellect is specifically to; metevcon, and inparticipating in Beauty, it participates not only in the shapeless Beauty of the Onebut in the unshaped beauty of the product of One itself (i.e., intellect), whichbeauty is not “in” intellect (as in a substrate) but strictly speaking in itself: “There-fore, the productive power of all is the flower of beauty, a beauty which makesbeauty. For it generates beauty and makes it more beautiful by the excess of beautywhich comes from it.... But since it is the principle of beauty it makes that beau-tiful of which it is the principle, and makes it beautiful not in shape; but it makesthe very beauty which comes to be from it to be shapeless, but in shape in anotherway; for what is called this very thing [shape] is shape in another, but by itselfshapeless. Therefore, that which participates in beauty [to;...metevcon] is shaped,not the beauty.” Thus the participant intellect participates in the highest moment ofitself, which would be identical with the One were it not pro;\" eJtevrw/(to use thelanguage of 5.5 [32].7): “but when there is nothing there but the medium, the eyesees [the light] by an instantaneous immediate perception [ajqrova/ prosbolh/'], thougheven then it sees it based upon something different, but if it is alone and not 166Kevin Corrigan"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"resting on something else [movnon de; aujto; genovmenon, mh; pro;\" eJtevrw/], the sense isnot able to grasp it.”It would seem, therefore, that there is a similar theory of intellectual partici-pation to be found in Numenius, Amelius, Plotinus, and the Commentary,but notin Porphyry.Appendix IIIDid the Existence-Life-Mind Triad Originate with Porphyry?On the basis of Damascius, Hadot tentatively suggests that u{parxi\"mayalready have been substituted for pathvrin the Oracles,as we have seen above,but traces the technical usage of u{parxi\"to Porphyry.1Nonetheless, the positiveevidence of Damascius is surely crucial in this issue (in the absence of anything tothe contrary), whereas the argument that the technical sense originates in Porphyryis inconclusive, to say the least, and fraught with serious difficulties, at best. In theSententiaePorphyry distinguishes the hypostases clearly (e.g., Sent.10.4.8–10;12.5.7–8; 25.15.1–2) and in a fragment of the Historia Phil.he refuses any kind ofcoordination (sunariqmei'sqai...sunkatatavttesqai) between the One and intel-lect (frg. 18.15.8–12 Nauck). In his commentary on the Oracles,however, he seemsto have identified the One and intellect. As Damascius tells us, “the principle of allthings” (the One) is identified with the “father of the noetic triad” (intellect) (Princ.1.86.9ff. Ruelle). As if to complicate matters further, Proclus tells us that intellect,according to Porphyry, is eternal, but possesses something preeternal in it (proai-wvnion) which links it (sunavptein) to the One (Plat. Theol.1.11.51.4–11 Saffrey-Westerink), and in the fragment of the Historia Phil.cited above there is also a ref-erence to a preeternal phase of intellect (frg. 18, 15, 1–3 Nauck). Hadot links thesewith Victorinus and the anonymous Commentary,and on the basis of Lydus’s tes-timony that Porphyry put an ennead at the top of his metaphysics in dealing withthe Chaldean Oracles(Mens.157.5–8) attempts to reconstruct Porphyry’s meta-physical system.2If we add to this the work being done on Arabic sources that con-tain several doctrines apparently similar to those in Hadot’s Porphyry-Victorinuscomparison (e.g., the first cause is to; ei\\naiand is the cause of the being of thingsand of their form, whereas intellect is cause only of form), then Hadot’s argumentfor Porphyry seems quite strong.But is this necessarily so? The question is: Did Porphyry bring this interpretationto his study of the Oraclesalone, or did he then apply it to his own metaphysicalsystem? As Andrew Smith has pointed out,3we may also ask whether our evidencederives from Porphyry’s Commentary on the Chaldean Oraclesor “also from casualcitations (with interpretation) of the Oraclesin otherwise straight Platonism and Gnosticism1671Hadot, Porphyre et Victorinus,1:267–68, 112–13.2Cf. A. Smith, “Porphyrian Studies Since 1913,” ANRW2.36.2:739–40.3Ibid., 740."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"168Kevin Corriganmetaphysical expositions.” Furthermore, did Porphyry’s enneadic interpretation ofthe Oraclesarise out of a solution to the “purely metaphysical problem of transcen-dence,” or was this complex structure prompted by the Oraclesin the first place, ordid some cross-fertilization of ideas take place? Given the present state of our evi-dence, we shall probably never be able to give a definite answer to these questions,but I suggest that in his own metaphysical system Porphyry followed a recognizablyPlotinian view of the relation between the One and intellect according to which therewas a preeternal, transcendent phase of intellect from which intellect in the propersense derived. It is not necessary to suppose that the evidence about a preeternalphase necessarily relates to Porphyry’s Commentary on the Chaldean Oracles,for itis clearly Plotinian. Sunavpteinis a verb Plotinus commonly employs in similar con-texts. Although Plotinus does not use the word proaiwvnio\", and although he rejectsa rigid dichotomy of intellect in 2.9 [33].1, a prenoetic, pre-eternal phase in the uni-fied totality of intellect’s generation from the One is a part of his thinking. On theother hand, Damascius’s vexation with Porphyry’s Chaldeanism might easily heexplained by the sources Damascius had available to him or by allusions to the Ora-cles(with interpretation) “in otherwise straight metaphysical expositions.”4Conse-quently, on the basis of the positive evidence before us, there seems little reason tosuppose that the technical sense of u{parxi\"and the triads, u{parxi\"-zwhv-novhsi\"/u{parxi\"-duvnami\"-nou'\", should have originated with Porphyry. All the positiveevidence indicates that they are most probably pre-Plotinian.Appendix IVThe Pre-Plotinian Character of the Gnostic TriadsThe explicit gnostic triads are much more plausibly pre-Plotinian Platonic elab-orations in the Chaldean tradition, of the type, for instance, that Amelius developsin a Neopythagorean manner.1Second, all the positive evidence, as we have arguedabove, points to the pre-Plotinian origin of some variant of the u{parxi\"-duvnami\"-nou'\"triad. Third, the method of paronyms that seems to give rise to the ojntovvth\"-zwovth\"-noovth\"triad is surely also familiar in Middle Platonism. Aujtovth\"and eJterovth\"areattested to in “Pythagorean” thought by Sextus Empiricus (Math.2.248–84), and inAlbinus (Did.10.164), in a section on God, there occurs a triad of adjectival epithets(aujtotelhv\"-aujtotelhv\"-pantelhv\") followed by five substantial ones: divinity(qeiovth\"), substantiality (oujsiovth\"), Truth (ajlhvqeia), Symmetry (summetriva), Good(ajgaqovn). Qeiovth\"and oujsiovth\"also occur in the Corp. herm.12.1. So the methodof paronyms is also conspicuously Middle Platonic and so too are the principles ofpredominance and implication, an admittedly rudimentary version of which we findin the passage immediately following in the Didaskalikos:the primary god is the1On the impossibility of effectively distinguishing “Neopythagorean” and “MiddlePlatonic,” see J. M. Dillon, The Middle Platonists,341ff.4Ibid."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Platonism and Gnosticism169Good because he benefits all things according to their capacities, the Beautiful inso-far as he is in his own nature perfect and commensurable, and Truth because he isthe origin of truth (164.32–40). There follows a passage that looks not unlike thethree principles of the Oracles,on the one hand, and that, on the other, also seemsto be involved in the same sort of demiurgic considerations that might have ledAmelius later to derive the triad, oJ boulhqeiv\"-oJ logizovmeno\"-oJ paralabwvn, from Tim.30a (apud Proclus In Tim.1.398.15ff.): he is Father [pathvr] through being the cause of all things and bestowingorder on the heavenly Intellect and the soul of the world in accordancewith himself and his own thoughts. By his own will [bouvlhsin] he hasfilled [ejmpevplhke] all things with himself, rousing up [ejgeivra\"] the soul ofthe world and turning it towards himself [eij\" eJauto;n ejpistrevya\"], as beingthe cause of its intellect [ai[tio\" uJparcw'n]. It is this latter that, set in orderby the Father [kosmhteiv\"], itself imposes order [diakosmei'] on all of naturein this world. (Did.10.3.164.40–165.4)God is “Father” by virtue of his being and his thought; by virtue of his will all thingsare filled; and by virtue of his power to convert the soul of the world, soul is finallylinked back through intellect to the Father. This compares quite strikingly with theview of Amelius, presumably shaped by Chaldean and Numenian influences, asreported by Proclus In Tim.1.362.2–4: oujkou'n kaqo; me;n nou'\" oJ dhmiourgov\", paravgeita; pavnta tai'\" eJautou' nohvsesi, kaqo; de; nohtovn ejstin aujtw/' tw/' ei\\nai poiei', kaqo; de;qeov\", tw/' bouvlesqai movnon(cf. also Proclus In Tim.1.361.26–362.9). One might alsoremark incidentally that in this relatively early passage in Albinus it is not overfan-ciful to see rudimentary possibilities of triadic, even enneadic structures that are laterimportant, perhaps even controversial in Amelius, Plotinus, and others. Here, forinstance, the “Father” by his very being(ai[tio\" uJpavrcwn) orders everything (intel-lect and the soul of the kovsmo\"), i.e., at the level of transcendent order. On the levelof will,however, the transcendent operation reaches into the content of everything,wakes it up, and turns it back to the Father as its intelligibility. Finally, as a result ofthe ejpistrofhv, the soul of the world is rendered intellectual (Did.165.2–30) and,being properly ordered, herself sets the world in order (kosmhqeiv\"...diakovsmei).Each movement is demiurgic, not entirely unlike the three demiurgic intellects inAmelius later. Of course, they are not really distinguished in Albinus and, in addi-tion, Amelius like Plotinus will emphasize the single primacy of existence and willtogether. Nonetheless, the comparative similarity is worth remarking.However this might be, if we can find important paronyms and rudimentaryversions of later triadic schemata, as well as of the principle of predominance, inAlbinus, not to mention Moderatus, Theon of Smyrna (Exp.37.15–18 Hiller), Nico-machus of Gerasa (Arith. Intro.2.8, p. 88, 9–10 Hoche), the Chaldean Oracles(frgs.27, 26, 28, 29, 31; cf. frgs. 12, 23), Numenius, as well as the Stoics, and especiallyPhilo (Abr.11.62–63),2which are related—according to admittedly later testimony—2See also P. Hadot (“Être, vie, pensée chez Plotin et avant Plotin,” in Les sources dePlotin[Entretiens sur l’antiquité classique 5; Vandoeuvres-Genéve: Fondation Hardt,1960], 126–28): Physics-Logic-Ethics/Nature-Doctrine-Practice/being-intelligence-life."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"to triads in and enneadic interpretations of the Chaldean Oracles,there is less rea-son still to suppose that variant triadic terms in the Sethian gnostic texts must bepost-Plotinian. Finally, therefore, the supposition that we have only later philo-sophical versions of earlier primitive revelations, revised in the light of Porphyry’scriticisms, becomes much less plausible. And indeed it should perhaps be noted,again in relation to the Commentary,that the enneadic structure of Porphyry’s inter-pretation of the Oraclesdoes not, in fact, appear there.Appendix VNumenius and AmeliusNumenius evidently thinks of divine intellectuality as analogous to the devel-opment and operation not only of human intellectuality, but also to the internaloperative functioning of the whole organism. In other words, at least one of theproblems that must have exercised Numenius was the problem of how mind, soul,and body are prefiguratively distinguished, but also unified in the divine thinking—a problem of no small philosophical and theological significance: How are we tothink of the total prefigurative unity of the living, sensible world in terms of theintelligible world and its origin? And how are we to make this concrete and philo-sophically accessible in terms of the complex unity of what it means to be a humanbeing, and of what it means to be both other-knower and self-knower, after themanner of the Alcibiades1, while avoiding simple-minded anthropomorphism? InAlbinus this question is already tackled in relation to the tripartite prefiguration ofthe tripartite embodied soul (Did.178.40–45 Hermann; kritikovn, oJrmhtikovn, oijkei-otikovn). The first two of these parts even characterize aspects of the soul of theSecond God in Numenius (frg. 18 des Places). In the tradition of Albinus, thisbecomes the problem of seeing the concrete relation between two or three intel-lectual activities and their implementation in the order of the physical universe.Such a concern in Numenius is effectively the problem already of how to conceivea primordial, intelligible biology in such a way that physical zoology and taxonomyflow from it, since the world of the divine already pre-includes in its own way thevarious articulations of the physical universe (cf. frg. 15.1; eijsi; d jou|toi bivoi oJ me;nprwvtou, oJ de; deutevrou qeou....9–10, ajf j h|\" h{ te tavxi\" tou' kovsmou kai; hJ monh; hJaji?dio\" kai; hJ swthriva ajnacei'tai eij\" ta; o{la). Compare the striking down-to-earth(Platonic) analogies for understanding the divine life: frg. 14, the giver and the gift;frg. 13, the farmer and the planter; frg. 12, the spontaneous creation of life and theanimation of bodies from the glance of the divine (cf. the myth of Plato’s Politi-cus); frg. 18, the demiurge as pilot at sea (from the Republicand Laws,etc.). A strik-ingly similar conception of this prefigurative intelligible biology (very much inaccord with the passages on divine demiurgic activity in Albinus’s Didaskalikos) isalso to be found in the Chaldean Oracles(see especially frg. 8 Majercik). In Nume-nius, then, we find, in a rudimentary way, an intelligible, explanatory schema ofthe origin of life that takes account of all the major activities (thinking, deciding,170Kevin Corrigan"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Platonism and Gnosticism171impulse, action, etc.) in the physical world and that attempts to reveal the divinein the simplest and most ordinary of physical activities.According to a rather indirect testimony of Proclus, Amelius placed his threeintellects or demiurges immediately after the One (unlike Theodore of Asine, whoplaced three distinct triads, intelligible, intellective, and demiurgic respectively,after the One; In Tim.1.309.14–16). The testimonies of Proclus and Damascius donot provide very much evidence for any systematic reconstruction of Amelius’sthought, and several different interpretations have prevailed at various times; forexample, either that the demiurges are the three hypostases (King, Intellect, andSoul), each containing a triadic structure within itself and constructed according towill, contemplation, and demiurgic action in the strict sense;1or that there are threedistinct noetic hypostases that Amelius multiplied because he could not understandthe subtlety of Plotinian intellectual theory;2or that in Amelius we find instead ofa tripartition of intellect, “fresh logical distinctions within each hypostasis,” muchlike the logical realism of later Neoplatonism;3or finally that in Amelius’s positingof three intellects there are really three different levels of a single hypostasis thatbetrays a unity in diversity very reminiscent of the Plotinian Intellect.4For a vari-ety of reasons, this final interpretation almost certainly makes the best sense of adifficult issue. Amelius’s “triad of demiurgic intellects” (Proclus In Tim3.103.18–23)looks back to Numenius (on whom Amelius was theexpert) but also bears a strongaffinity to Plotinus’s theory that intellect is a diversity-in-unity and betrays alsosome similar philosophical preoccupations to the thought of Plotinus, who was,after all, the close and valued colleague of Amelius.Amelius divided intellect into three phases: “he who is,” “he who has,” and “hewho sees.” His theory was, in part, an interpretation of Tim.39e, for Proclus tellsus that he termed the first intellect “he who is” from the “really existing Living Crea-ture,” the second “he who has” from the phrases “dwelling in” (ejnouvsa\") and third“he who sees” from the word kaqora'n(In Tim.3.103.18ff.; Plato Tim.39e: “Accord-ing then as intellect sees forms dwelling in the really existing Living Creature, suchand so many as exist therein did he think that this world should also have”).Iamblichus criticized Amelius on the grounds that the “really existing Living Crea-1Cf.

At any rate, a certainsimilarity with the three gods of Numenius must have been sufficiently clearbecause Proclus goes on immediately to summarize the Numenian account accord-ing to which the first god functions as the really existing paradigm, the second actsby provscrhsi\"as intellect (kata; to;n nou'n), and the third, again, by provscrhsi\"ofthe second with the third, as demiurgic and reflective, strictly speaking (kata; to;ndianoouvmenon) (ibid., 28–32).In another passage (In Tim.1.431.26–28) Proclus tells us that Amelius effec-tively identified the first of these demiurgic intellects with the intelligible object (to;nohtovn) and saw the second and third as receiving definition within the sphere ofbeing. A more detailed explanation appears at In Tim.1.306.1ff.:The first intellect is really what he is, the second is the object of thoughtin him but he has the object which is before him and participates alto-gether in that and for this reason is second; and the third is also the objectof thought in him—for every intellect is the same as the object of thoughtlinked to it [pa'\" ga;r nou'\" tw/' suzugou'nti nohtw/' oJ aujtov\" ejstin] but he hasthe object of thought in the second intellect and sees the first [e[cei de; to;ejn tw/' deutevrw/ kai; oJra/' to; prw'ton].What is striking about Amelius’s view of the three intellects (to; o[nta, to;n e[conta,to;n oJrw'nta) that Amelius identified with the three Kings of Plato’s Second Letter(312e) and also with the Orphic triad, Phanes-Ouranos-Kronos (In Tim.1.306.2,10–14), of whom Phanes is demiurgic in the fullest sense (ibid., 13–14), is that fromthe outset intellect is not an objectas such, but first and foremost a subject.Thismay well be a reflection upon Numenius’s “Mosaic” notion of being (while beingis not characterized in the fragments as “I am who am,” Numenius refers to Platoas nothing other than Mwsh'\" ajttikivzwn, frg. 8 des Places), but it also seemsdesigned to avoid an abstract or artificial, purely objective moment in the unfold-ing of intellect as a demiurgic whole, for Amelius is clearly concerned to interlacethe respective functions of the three intellects so that they represent a functionaltotality, but one that remains grounded in the first instance upon a subject that inturn is an object to be “held” by the second and third intellects, and to be seen asfully expressed thinking only in the third. In other words, Amelius would appearto have held the view (not unlike Plotinus), first, that intellect must be a travelingsubject,not simply an apparently independent objectof thought; second, that sub-ject and object cannot be linked retrospectively unless they are linked together inidentity from the beginning and in a subject that unfolds as a persistent but devel-oping identity. The principle, that every intellect is identical with the object ofthought linked to it, makes this persistent identity clear. Third, it would also appearthat Amelius seeks to express (despite his reputation for long-windedness) in thesimplest and most accessible manner (being, having, and seeing) the necessary logical and biological steps involved in the development of anythingthat possessesmore than minimal or rudimentary organization. In general, “to be” or “to exist” is the most universal characteristic of all things, whereas “to have” is already to172Kevin Corrigan"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"possess in some measure a determinate constitution or potentiality for future determinate complexity; and “to see” or “to discern,” in turn, is the fully realizedactivity of the earlier potentialities of “being’ and “having.”It is therefore quite plausible to suppose that in Amelius (apart from exegesisof the relevant Platonic texts or of Neopythagorean doctrine and Platonic commen-taries) there is also the remnant of a deeper philosophical reflection upon the Stoictriad, fuvsi\"–e{xi\"–yuchv, and even more so upon the Aristotelian triad,duvnami\"–e{xi\"–ejnevrgeia, in so far as this is to be understood in relation to intellectitself. Implicit again behind this is a further hidden, and now lost, reflection uponthe character of Aristotle’s or Alexander of Aphrodisias’s Nou'\". Unlike Aristotle orAlexander, Amelius omits all mention of potentiality, passivity, or materiality in thecontext of intellect (at least as far as Proclus reports), but clearly behind the debatethat prompts such a theory there must somewhere have been a concern to interpretthe process or movement language in regard to intellect in Aristotle himself; as forexample, at Metaph.1072b13–20 in which: (a) intellect thinks itself kata; metavlhyintou' nohtou';(b) becomesintelligible and identical with the intelligible in virtue ofbeing the recipientof substance and intelligible object, and thus acts in havingthem(to; ga;r dektiko;n tou' nohtou' kai; th'\" oujsiva\" nou'\", ejnergei' de; e[cwn); and (c) the activ-ity is “seeing” (qewriva). As so often later in Plotinus and probably in Amelius, so alsoin Aristotle human mind and Divine Mind converge implicitly into one discourse.5At any rate, what we seem to see in Amelius is, first, some sort of interpretationofthe being-having-seeing language (and attendant vocabulary) that Aristotle employsconspicuously (if somewhat strangely) of his own Nou'\", and second, some concernto take into account the basic components that go to make up a fully realizedejnevrgeiaor ejntelevceia, but now transposed or prefigured on the intellectual plane.If I am right, this is an important indication of a philosophical trend already rootedin Albinus’s identification of God with the Aristotelian intellect and implicit perhapsin the double intellect or ejnevrgeiatheory (i.e., “standing” and “moving”) in Nume-nius (frg. 15 des Places). In Middle Platonic thought up to and including Ameliusand Plotinus, the interpretive transposition of Aristotelian (and presumably Stoic)doctrines is a signal feature of basic philosophical practice, and of course the anony-mous Commentaryfits well into this milieu, for the interpretation of the structure ofintellect is simultaneously Platonic and Aristotelian.6Is this interpretation borne out by the rest of what we know about Amelius?There is no further confirmation regarding the interpretation of or reflection uponAristotle, but that Amelius had in mind the intelligible prefiguration of later formaland material compound totalities is corroborated by other features of his thoughtpreserved in Proclus. The first intellect is demiurgic by his very existenceand by hiswill(as also in Plotinus’s great work on Divine creativity and freedom, Enn.6.8 [39]):in so far as the demiurge is intellect he brings all things forward by histhoughts [paravgei ta; pavnta tai'\" eJautou' nohvsesi]; in so far as he is an intel-ligible object, he makes by his very existence [aujtw/' tw/' ei\\nai poiei]; in sofar as he is god, he makes by his own will alone. (In Tim.1.362.2–4).Platonism and Gnosticism1735Cf. K.

SVF2:43.18; 74.4;Phaedr.276a); which is to say that at the highest level, willed intention is equiva-lent to creation, whereas at the second level the expressed word becomes andmakes reality. At this level, then, the second intellect is ranged in the category ofthe architect (kata; to;n ajrcitevkton, In Tim.1.361.30–362.1).At the third level, which, Proclus tells us, is the “truly demiurgic intellect” (InTim.1.309.24–25), the “intellect which sees” is the “source of souls” (phghv yucw'n,1.309.18) in the sense that it has “made its division right into the particulars”(1.309.19–20: to;n de; kai; th;n eij\" ta; kaq je\\kasta diaivresin pepoihmevnon). (It shouldbe noted that 1.309.14–20 appears to refer to Theodore, not Amelius directly.) Whatthis means is unclear, although a comparison with Enn.6.2 [43].21–22, and othertreatises by Plotinus, might reasonably suggest that anything whatsoever that is inany way conformable to a lovgo\"(a reasonable “account” or “definition”) could beregarded as intelligible in principle or as part of the prefigurative power of the thirdstrictly demiurgic intellect. This intellect, then, is “that which has taken over” thephysical world (In Tim. 1.398.23: oJ paralabwvn) in the sense apparently that itenfolds that world inside soul and inside itself and in this way “fashions in cooper-ation the universe” (1.398.25–26: tivqhsi me;n ga;r nou'n ejn yuch/', yuch;n de; ejn swvmatikai; ou\\tw suntektaivnetai to; pa'n) “by the work of his hand” (metaceirivsei)(1.398.25) and so is to be ranged in the category of work for himself” (kata; to;n auj-tourgo;n tecnivthn) (1.361.29–30). Amelius then is clearly concerned to develop anintelligible biology that reaches right down into the heart and content even of par-ticular existences and prefigures the work of productive tevcnhor craft (in somethingof the way that Pseudo-Dionysius will later say that the more dissimilar an epithetfrom the life of God the more appropriate may be its attribution to divinity).Amelius’s view of Phanes seems to confirm this interpretation. Zeller thinksPhanes is the highest level of intellect; Massagli argues cogently that he is the low-est.7Whatever view one adopts, it seems clear from Proclus’s accounts thatAmelius sees intellect as including from within all that follows it, namely soul, thephysical world, and all its content. Consequently, our interpretation of the intelli-gible prefiguration of the physical formal-material compound totality (by means ofthe Platonic notion of tevcnh) seems to be confirmed by other passages in Proclus.Furthermore, the view of Massagli that Amelius’s three intellects are really three dif-ferent perspectives of a single hypostasis is also confirmed by the evidence beforeus.8Despite Amelius’s identification of these intellects with Plato’s three Kings,174Kevin Corrigan7For the former, see K. Corrigan, “Amelius, Plotinus and Porphyry,” 983; on thelatter, M. Massagli, “Amelio Neoplatonico,” 233–37.8M.

Amelius, we may reasonably conclude, is con-cerned with the problem of how being, life, and thought (both from Platonic andAristotelian viewpoints) come to be prefiguratively articulated in an eternally actualintellect in such a way that the natural compounds of our experiences (architectsand artisans) bear that intelligible imprint at the very root of their own creativity.This is not a notion which starts with Amelius. It is present already in Albinus,Numenius, the anonymous Commentary,not to mention the Chaldean Oracleswhere the “flower of intellect” plays an archetypal role for the whole subsequenttradition (and the language of life and growth, if not the term zwhvitself, assumesa new intelligible significance; Chaldean Oracles,frgs. 37; 39.4; 16; 17; 33; 68Majercik). Again, in the Hermetic and gnostic systems “life” assumes the role of adivine principle.9What we see by contrast in “late Middle Platonism” is a newattention to the prefigurative power of the Intelligible Universe and to its philo-sophical meaning. As a consequence, Aristotelian (and Stoic) thought clearly startsto assume greater significance.Appendix VIPlotinus’s Independence from Zostrianosand AllogenesFirst, AllogenesXI 59,10–61,32 furnishes indirect but strong support that Ploti-nus in 3.8 [30], and later, has this or a similar passage in mind, for the verbal paral-lels in Plotinus have a significantly different philosophical import than in Allogenes(“withdrawing to the rear,” repeated three times; “placing oneself,” “silently abiding”;“enlightened ignorance,” etc.). Consequently, it makes no sense to suppose that thewriter of Allogenesmodeled himself on the Enneads,for almost nothing of the real,inner thought of the treatises we have been considering is contained in Allogenes,and if the writer had so modeled himself upon the Enneadswe should haveexpected at least some reflection of this. It makes a lot more sense, therefore, tosuppose that Plotinus’s adaptation of philosophical motifs in Allogenes(themselvesprobably influenced by Middle Platonic thought: the Chaldean Oracles,for instance:retreat, looking both ways, etc.) is part of the creation of a complex, subtle appealto people who, like him, were already familiar with these works.Second, additional confirmation can be supplied by a comparison betweenZost.VIII 48,3–26 and 3.8 [30].1–8 and 5.8 [31].3–4, from the descriptions of the “liv-ing earth.” The Zostrianospassage runs as follows:9Corp. herm.1.9, 12; 13.9; Myst.267.4; E.

JDT]What we appear to have here, as John Dillon points out, is a comprehensive arche-type of the physical world, right down to the tares among the wheat. There are alsonoetic archetypes of body, begetting (both of which Plotinus himself includes inthe second of his great logical works, 6.2 (43).21–22, when he describes the teem-ing vitality and fecundity of the intelligible world—see especially 21.52–59), andperception (which forms part of the subject matter of 6.7 (38).1–7: ai[sqhsi\" is adim form of novhsi\"). Some of the details of this description are repeated at Zost.55,15–25 and 113–17. The former passage (55,15–25) includes animals (which isagain the subject of 6.7 [38].1–13, especially the problem how irrational animals areto be conceived as part of the content of intellect; 6.7 [38].9–10), and the latter (113–17) appears to describe the whole world contained within the Aeon, down to the“simple elements of simple origins” (cf. Plotinus’s analysis of the simple elementskata; lovgonin 6.7 [38].11–12), and appearing quite remarkably similar to Plotinus’sintelligible world: “All of them exist in one, dwelling together and perfected indi-vidually in fellowship and filled with the aeon which really exists” (Zost.VIII116,7). What are we to make of this?Let us compare the following passage from 5.8 [31].3–4, bearing in mind thatmuch of the early chapters of 6.7 [38] might also profitably be compared withZostrianos.. . . but the gods in that higher heaven, all those who dwell upon it and init, contemplate through their abiding in the whole of that heaven. For allthings there are heaven, and earth and sea and plants and animals and menare heaven, everything which belongs to that higher heaven is heavenly . . .for it is “the easy life” [cf. Homer, e.g., Il. 6.138] there, and truth is theirmother and nurse and substance and nourishment—and they see all things,not those to which coming to be, but those to which real being belongs, andthey see themselves in other things; for all things there are transparent, andthere is nothing dark or opaque; everything and all things are clear to theinmost part to everything; for light is transparent to light.

But beyond a striking general similarity, the two passagesare really quite different. Zostrianosdescribes a remarkable edifying spectacleinwhich the subject ecstatically perceivesan object of vision. Plotinus, on the otherhand, reverses the mistake that Plato asserts people habitually make (i.e., “just as ifsomeone seeing the sun and the stars through the water, should think the sun wasthe sky”; Phaed.109c); we do make this mistake, but we make it in a sense becauseof the perfect transparency of the intelligible medium in which every intelligibleobject is manifested in and through every other. Plotinus, therefore, represents aphilosophicalpicture, developed carefully as we have seen above throughout thesetreatises, in which subject and object are mutually transformed so that “they seethemselves in others” (eJautou;\" ejn a[lloi\"): “everything there isheaven.” Now it isstriking that not one direct reflection of Plotinus’s view of this sort of mutual trans-formation is to be found in any of the three Zostrianospassages. The idea of allthings existing in one fellowship and filled with the aeon is perfectly Middle Pla-tonic and gnostic. Consequently, if Zostrianosis modeled on Plotinus or evendependent in some minimal fashion, it is a resounding failure. Yet we have no rea-son to suppose that the author of Zostrianoswas philosophically unsophisticated orincapable of recognizing a major philosophical difference, had he or she seen it. Wemust conclude, therefore, either that the resemblance between the EnneadsandZostrianosis purely coincidental or that Plotinus had read Zostrianos,wished toindicate sotto vocethat this so-called vision is fundamentally Greek (which is at leastpartly why, I suggest, he quotes Homer, after his similar treatment of Hesiod’sTheogony), and that there is more involved in such a vision than just a special kindof “intelligible” perception. If perception is at root intelligible and intellection aes-thetic, this will have to be analyzed out in a different way in relation to the makingof the physical universe and the nature of the intelligible universe, an analysis thatPlotinus undertakes later in 6.7 [38]. However, it is also not plausible to suppose thatthere is only a coincidental resemblance between Zostrianosand the Enneads,because, for one thing, we have external, independent confirmation that Plotinusknew directly of this treatise. A reasonable conclusion is therefore that, 5.8 (31).3–4is a subtle indirect critique and philosophical correction of Zostrianos.Platonism and Gnosticism177"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THESETTING OF THEPLATONIZINGSETHIANTREATISES INMIDDLEPLATONISMJohn D. TurnerUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln1. The Position of the Platonizing Treatises within SethianismOver the last decade, I have attempted to develop a hypothesis con-cerning the origins of Sethian Gnosticism on the basis of the topologicaland prosopographical similarities and differences exhibited by the varioustexts that are commonly agreed to form the Sethian corpus. It appears thatthe Sethianism of the Nag Hammadi treatises are the product of two dis-tinct but not entirely unrelated speculative movements within or on thefringe of Hellenistic Judaism: (1) that segment of the wisdom tradition thatwas in conversation with contemporary Platonism, which I take to be theoriginating milieu of the “Barbeloite” speculation on the divine Wisdomand Name, and (2) the rather more eschatologically oriented form of spec-ulation on the traditions concerning the primordial figures of Adam andSeth that gave rise to the sacred history of the Sethians. The name “Barbe-loite” is inspired by Irenaeus’s ascription of the theogonical and cosmogo-nical doctrine he describes in Haer.1.29 to a group he calls “Barbeloites,”a doctrine recognized by contemporary scholars as being nearly identicalwith that found in the four versions of the foundational statement ofSethian mythology, the Apocryphon of John.The first movement conceived the receipt of revelation as a kind of bap-tism in wisdom, conceived as light or knowledge conferred on the recipientby the Logos or Voice or First Thought (Barbelo) of the supreme deity, whowas conceived as a divine trinity, the supreme Invisible Spirit as Father, hisFirst Thought Barbelo as divine Mother, and the divine Autogenes as her self-generated Child. Sometime in the first century this movement was influencedby Christian baptizing groups, causing these “Barbeloites” to identify thisAutogenes Child with the preexistent Logos or Christ and construe him as themediator of this saving baptism. The second group, which I call “Sethites” (indistinction from “gnostic” Sethians), conceived of revelation as deriving fromcertain ancient records containing the sacred history of the enlightenment oftheir primordial ancestors, Adam and Seth, records of which had been"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"brought to light by a recent reappearance of Seth, the original and chief recip-ient of this revelation. The fusion of this group with the former group of pre-viously Christianized “Barbeloites” resulted in an identification between Sethand Jesus found in several of the Sethian gnostic treatises.It seems as if the baptismal rite was originally foreign to the pre-Sethian-gnostic Sethites and was adopted by them in the course of theircontact with other baptismal movements, probably Christian or Christian-influenced, especially the “Barbeloites” responsible for the production ofthe theogonies featuring the figure of Barbelo as found in the TrimorphicProtennoiaand the Apocryphon of John.At that point, the baptismal rite,called the “Five Seals,” and its associated mythologumena became centralto the self-definition of the Christian Sethianism reflected in treatises suchas the Trimorphic Protennoia,the Apocryphon of John, Melchizedek,andespecially the Gospel of the Egyptians.A central feature of the baptismalexperience was the receipt of divine wisdom revealed in the course ofimmersion in ordinary water that also symbolized receipt of its celestialcounterpart, the “living water” of divine illumination; it enabled an experi-ence of transcendental vision resulting in total salvation.1There are, however, certain Sethian treatises like Allogenesand theThree Steles of Seththat, although centered on the figure of Barbelo, notonly lack Christian features typical of other Sethian treatises, but alsodefine Sethian religious praxis in terms of a rite of contemplative ascent inwhich there appears to be no reference to an actual earthly baptismal rite.A median position in this spectrum of ritual practice is represented by thelikewise non-Christian treatise Zostrianos,which conceives the stages ofthis visionary ascent as marked by nonearthly, celestial baptisms in thename of various transcendental beings, which suggests that the baptismalrite was the cultic setting within which the apparently nonbaptismal vision-ary ascension in Sethian treatises like Allogenesand the Three Steles of Setharose. In the latter two texts, it appears that the ascensional rite hasbecome detached from the older baptismal mystery, while in Zostrianos(and perhaps in the closely related treatise Marsanes) it is still associatedwith the baptismal rite, or at least interpreted in terms of it. None of thesetexts, however, mentions the “Five Seals.”180John D. Turner1See J.-M.

Such adeparture would most likely have been occasioned by an “orthodox” Chris-tian rejection of the Sethian identification of Christ with the Autogenes asthe preexistent Son of Barbelo and the Invisible Spirit, and of their notionthat Barbelo had accomplished her third and final saving descent as theLogos—perhaps appearing as the figure of Seth in the guise of Jesus—bear-ing the celestial baptismal rite of the Five Seals. In such a situation, Sethianauthors may have been forced to seek a less Christian and ritual-orientedinterpretation of the transcendental theology of the Barbeloite tradition thanthat offered by baptismal rites or the Sethite speculation on Gen 1–6 typi-cal of such texts as the Apocryphon of John,the Trimorphic Protennoia,andthe Gospel of the Egyptians.The most hospitable environment for such aventure would be certain groups other than Christians who were commit-ted to the philosophical articulation of biblical and other traditional wisdomalong Platonic lines, such as the wing of contemporary NeopythagoreanPlatonism represented by Philo of Alexandria, Numenius, the ChaldeanOracles,and various members of Plotinus’s seminars in Rome.2. The Triadic Metaphysics of the Platonizing Sethian TreatisesThe metaphysics of these Platonizing Sethian treatises is laid out onfour levels, a highest realm beyond even being itself, below which onefinds an atemporal, intelligible realm of pure being, followed by a psychicrealm, characterized by time and motion, and finally a physical realm at thebottom of the scale.The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises181"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The highest being, corresponding to the Plotinian One, is the Unknow-able One or Invisible Spirit, characterized by nonbeing existence, silence,and stillness; it exists (in the Stoic sense of a tiv, an actual entity), yet actswithout mind, life, or existence or nonexistence, superior even to its owncharacter, and is completely unknowable (AllogenesXI 61,32–64,14). It is“a unity of all that which [exists] in it and [outside] it and [remains] after it . . . [the power of] all those [that exist, principle of every principle],fore[thought of] every thought, [power] of every power” (Zost.VIII64,13–65,10).2The second major level is that of the Aeon of Barbelo, the FirstThought of the Invisible Spirit, characterized as a nondiscriminating, incor-poreal, [timeless] knowledge (AllogenesXI 51,10–11). According to Allo-genes,Barbelo is a tripartite Aeon that is subdivided into three levelsresembling the Plotinian hypostases of Intellect and Soul: (1) the domainof “the authentic existents” (ta; o[ntw\" o[nta, thenohtav) presided over byKalyptos, the Hidden One, a sort of nou'\" nohtov\"rather like the PlotinianIntellect; (2) the domain of “those who are unified” (i.e., “exist together,”)3presided over by Protophanes, the First Appearing One, a sort of nou'\"novero\"rather like the Plotinian cosmic Soul; and (3) the domain of the“individuals” (perhaps individual souls) presided over by Autogenes (theSelf-Begotten One, a sort of nou'\" dianoouvmeno\") who operates to rectify therealm of Nature, rather like the Plotinian individuated soul.4182John D. Turner2In Marsanes,there is even a yet higher entity, “the Unknown Silent One,”beyond the Invisible Spirit and his Triple-Powered One, much the same asIamblichus posited an “altogether ineffable” principle beyond even the Plotinian“absolutely One” that, together with a duality of principles (Limit and Unlimited, orthe One and the Many), heads the noetic triad (apud Damascius Princ.1.86.3–6;101.14–15; 103.6–10 Ruelle).3Cf.

Unlike Plotinus’s Nous, Barbelo is not only the aeonic place of the Ideas,but also that of their images. Three such images are named: Kalyptos, Protophanesand Autogenes. Barbelo thus contains (1) the truly existing objects (nh etSoopontws) of intellection, the Ideas, as the image of Kalyptos, (2) “the intellectual prin-ciple [Porphyry defines Nous as an incorporeal noero;\" lovgo\", Sent.42.12] of thesethings (Ideas),” as the image of Protophanes (the domain of those who are “unified,”nh etHiouma), who apparently intelligizes the Ideas in Kalyptos and operates (ejnergei'n) with them on the individuals (nikata oua), which in turn are (3) theimage of Autogenes, who acts successively and step-by-step to master (taHo, “toset straight”) the defects of the realm of fuvsi\", tantamount to taking on the demi-urgic role of the cosmic soul.

In Zostrianosand Marsanes,however,the realm extending from the Aeon of Barbelo to the (sublunar) atmos-pheric realm is articulated into distinct levels, populated with variouskinds of souls and spiritual beings. Directly below the Aeon of Barbelo,presided over by the divine Autogenes, are the Self-Begotten Aeons(apparently consisting of four levels defined by the Four Luminaries ofearlier Sethian mythology and populated respectively by the archetypesof Adam, Seth, Seth’s antediluvian seed, and their progeny), the Repen-tance (containing souls of those who sin yet repent), the Sojourn (con-taining those who are not self-directed but follow the ways of others),and the three lower realms Marsanescalls the “cosmic and material,” butwhich Zostrianosspecifies as the Aeonic Copies (ajntivtupoi) of the pre-ceding three levels (apparently located in the realm between the moonand the fixed stars), the atmospheric realm (“Airy earth,” apparently therealm between the moon and earth’s surface), and finally the earthly, cor-poreal realm with its own thirteen aeons presided over by the Archoncreator of the sensible cosmos. Among the four treatises, it is only Zos-trianosthat traces the origin of the Matter from which the Archon shapesthis corporeal realm to the downward inclination of Sophia (NHC VIII9,2–10,20).2.1. The Invisible SpiritThe highest being, corresponding to the Plotinian One, is the InvisibleSpirit or Unknowable One, characterized by nonbeing existence, silence,and stillness. According to Zostrianos(64,13–66,11), the supreme deity canonly be characterized negatively (the via negativa) and as superlative to allelse (the via eminentiae); this passage has a nearly word-for-word parallelin Marius Victorinus’s Ar.1.49.9–40; clearly both authors are dependent ona common source, quite likely a Middle Platonic commentary on Plato’sParmenides,especially its first hypothesis, 137d–142a.5The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises183a Nous consisting of the contemplated Ideas (nou'\" nohtov\"), the contemplating Mind(nou'\" novero\"or qewrhtikov\"or kinouvmeno\" ajkivnhto\" w[n), and the demiurgic Mind(nou'\" dianoouvmeno\"); cf.

The Aeon of BarbeloThe Aeon of Barbelo is the emanative product of the three-stageunfolding of the inner potency of the supreme Unknowable One or Invis-ible Spirit. According to Allogenes(XI 45,8–46,35), just as the Barbelo aeonitself becomes a substantially existing aeon who can know herself becauseshe knows her source (the Invisible Spirit), so also each level of beingwithin the Aeon of Barbelo comes into being by knowing both itself andits originating principle. Each successively lower being emanates from itsimmediate prior and achieves substantial reality by a contemplative rever-sion upon its suprajacent source:XI 458The 9[Mind], the guardian [I provided], 10[for you] taught you.And it is the power that 11[exists] in you that [extended] 12[itself], since[it] often 13[rejoiced in] the Triple-Powered One, the [one] 14[of] all[those] who [truly] exist 15with the [immeasurable] One, the 16eternal[light of] the knowledge 17that has [appeared], the 18male virginal [glory],19[the first] aeon, the one from 20[a] unique triple-powered [aeon], 21[the] Triple-Powered One who 22[truly exists].

Thusthe individuals resident in the Autogenes may see Protophanes by contem-plating the unified beings over which he presides. The unified beings resi-dent in Protophanes may see the Kalyptos by contemplating those whotruly exist in Kalyptos. Finally to see all the beings hidden within the Aeonof Barbelo is to see the Barbelo Aeon itself, who in turn was completed byknowing her prefigurative self in the Invisible Spirit. The chain of being iscreated and bound together by acts of vision and knowledge.Within the Aeon of Barbelo, the ideal entities are alive and in agree-ment, separate and yet “all together” (Zost.VIII 115,2–13; 117,1–4). Thesimilarity to Plotinus’s description of the condition of the Ideas within theIntellect (ejkei' pavnta oJmou') is obvious. Barbelo also bears characteristicsechoing those of the Receptacle of Plato’s Timaeus.According to the sec-ond stele of the Three Steles of Seth,Barbelo is a Hidden One (Kalyptos),a shadow from the One, who “empowers the shadows which pour fromthe One,” probably the equivalent of Plato’s images of the Forms, includ-ing principal categories (from the Sophistand Parmenides) the “equal”and “unequal,” the “similar” and “dissimilar.” As “begetter of multiplicityaccording to a division of those who really are” (the Forms), she provides“forms in [that which] exists to others,” that they might become perfectindividuals, dwelling in her as a cosmos of knowledge. According to Zos-trianos,Barbelo is a “preexistence of nonbeing” (VIII 79,7–8), eternallymoving from undividedness into active existence, an image that comes tobe in an act of reversion (“turning”; 80,9) upon its source, making herselfstable and at rest, knowing herself and the one who preexists. As such,she serves as an eternal space (cwvrhma, 82,8) in order that those whoindwell her, perhaps the Forms, might have a stable and limited place andthat those who come forth from her, perhaps perceptible entities, mightbecome purely simple individuals at the level of Autogenes (88,16–22;127,7–15).2.3. The Triple-Powered OneThe most distinctive metaphysical feature of these treatises is theTriple-Powered One that mediates between the Invisible Spirit and theAeon of Barbelo. This being is mentioned sometimes independently andsometimes in conjunction with the Invisible Spirit.6In Allogenes,by a self-188John D.

She emerges from her source as the first shadow of lightfrom the light of the Father, as a Hidden One (kaluptov\") who has becomenumerable, that is, measurable, defined Being that can be distinguishedfrom the Monad, her source. Just as the Neopythagorean arithmologicaltreatises consider the Triad to be the first of the defined numbers follow-ing the One and the Dyad, Barbelo is said to become threefold (as Kalyp-tos, Protophanes and Autogenes), while at the same time continuing to beone with her source.

(trans. Layton)As will be noted below (pp. 218–21), a number of concepts in this passageand the preceding one from Zostrianossound similar to what we knowfrom the first-century Neopythagorean Moderatus: privation, projection asa shadow, the origin of defined multiplicity by intellectual limitation ofindefinite enumerability, and the creation of an eternal space or receptacleto contain that multiplicity.Marsanes(NHC X 7,4–9,20) posits an unknown silent One above theInvisible Spirit (the supreme principle of the other treatises) whose silenceis actualized by the Invisible Spirit’s Triple-Powered One. In this process,the first power (apparently uJpovstasi\") of the Triple-Powered One is iden-tical with the Invisible Spirit, and its second power (apparently ejnevrgeia)is identical with its own hypostatic actuality. The Aeon of Barbelo thenemerges as the third power (apparently gnw'si\") of the Triple-Powered Oneas it withdraws from its first two powers. It appears that these three pow-ers, Hypostasis, Activity, and Knowledge, are Marsanes’equivalent for theExistence, Vitality, Mentality triad of the other three treatises:X 71When I had inquired about these things 2I perceived that he (theTriple-Powered One) acted 3from silence. He exists 4prior to those that5truly exist, that belong to the realm of Being. 6He (the Triple-PoweredOne) is a preexistent otherness 7belonging to the one (the Invisible Spirit)that 8actualizes the Silent One. 9And the silence of [that (the Triple-Pow-ered One) which follows] 10him (the Invisible Spirit) acts.

While the initial and final phases ormodes of the Triple-Powered One have hypostatic instantiation as theInvisible Spirit and Barbelo, the hypostatic status of the transitional modebetween the two, Vitality, is less clear. In Zostrianos,the Triple-PoweredOne mostly seems to be a faculty of the Invisible Spirit itself; in the ThreeSteles of Seth,it seems to represent the prefigurative existence of the Bar-belo Aeon within the supreme preexistent One; while AllogenesandMarsanestend to conceive it as a separate, median quasi-hypostasisbetween the two, as if it were the hypostatic instantiation of its medianpower, Vitality. In fact, the last two sometimes coalesce the first of theTriple-Powered One’s three powers with the Invisible Spirit, above whomthey locate an apparently even more transcendent One.194John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Now the closest attested parallel to this sequence of emanative phasesis apparently to be found in the anonymous Turin palimpsest Commentaryon the Parmenidesfirst published by W. Kroll and republished andassigned to Porphyry by P. Hadot.9It appears that this anonymous com-mentator on the Parmenideswished to demonstrate that the “One-Being”of the second hypothesis of the Parmenidesis paradoxically at the sametime discontinuous and continuous with the absolute, unqualifiable One ofthe first hypothesis. The absolute, unqualified, and infinitival being (aujto;to; ei\\nai) of the first One (e{n) somehow declines from its source and is con-ferred upon a second One-which-is (e{n o[n) that thereby acquires its deter-minate being by participating in the transcendent indeterminate being ofthe first One as its idea.It has not been said that Being participates in the One, but that the Oneparticipates in Being [to; o[n], not because the first was Being [to; o[n], butbecause an otherness [eJterovth\"] from the One has turned the Onetowards this whole One-Being [to; e}n ei\\nai]. For from the fact of beingengendered somehow at the second level, being-One [to' e}n ei\\nai] isadded....the One, which is beyond substance and being [to; o[n], is nei-ther being nor substance nor act, but rather acts and is itself pure act,such that it is itself being [ei\\nai] before determinate being [to; o[n]. Byparticipating this being [the ei\\naiof the first One; cf. Parmenides137c–142a], the One [scil. “who is,” i.e., the second One of Parmenides142b–144e] possesses another being [ei\\nai] declined from it [the ei\\naiofthe Supreme One], (106) which is [what is meant by] participating indeterminate being [to; o[n; cf. oujsivain Parmenides142B]. Thus, being[ei\\nai] is double: the one preexists determinate being [to; o[n], while theother [o[n] is derived from the One that transcends determinate being [to;o[n], who is absolute being [ei\\nai] and as it were the idea of determinatebeing [to; o[n] by participation in which [the ei\\naiof the first] some otherOne has come to be to which is linked the being [ei\\nai] carried overfrom it. (In Parm.12.16–35 Hadot)Again, the commentator accounts for the origin of this second “One-Being”by attributing to it three modalities or phases, which he analyzed into thetriad, Existence, Life, and Intellect.

Hadot,Porphyre et Victorinus(2 vols.; Paris: Études augustiniennes, 1968), 2:61–113; cf.idem, “Fragments d’un commentaire de Porphyre sur le Parménide,” Revue desétudes grecques74 (1961): 410–38."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"One in Allogenesand Zostrianos,is meant to refer to the absolute infiniti-val being (aujto; to; ei\\nai) of the One, which is the ijdevaof the derived deter-minate being (to; o[n) proper to the second One now identified as thedivine Intellect.Taken in itself as its own idea it—this power, or whatever term one mightuse to indicate its ineffability and inconceivability [i.e., the potential Intel-lect still identical with the One]—is one and simple. But with respect toexistence (u{parxi\"), life (zwhv) and thought (novhsi\") it is neither one norsimple. With respect to existence (u{parxi\"), thinking is also beingthought. But when Intellect [abandons] existence for intelligizing so as tobe elevated to the rank of an intelligible in order to see itself, intelligizingis life. Therefore thinking is indefinite with respect to life. And all areactivities (ejnergeivai) such that with respect to existence, activity would bestatic; with respect to intelligizing, activity would be turned to itself; andwith respect to life, activity would be inclining away from existence (InParm.14.15–26 Hadot).Here Intellect unfolds from the absolute being of the One in three phasesaccording to which each modality of the Intellect predominates at a givenstage. First, quau{parxi\", Intellect is purely potential Intellect resident inand identical with its idea, the absolute being of the One. Last, quaIntel-lect, it has become identical with the derived being (to; o[n) of Intellectproper, the second hypostasis, as the hypostatic exemplification of its idea,the absolute being of the One. The transitional phase between the first andlast phases of intellect in effect constitutes a median phase of Intellect inwhich it is “indeterminate thinking” or Intellect quaLife.In Allogenesand Marsanes,the Triple-Powered One is identical withthe Invisible Spirit in its first (Existence/Hypostasis) phase, discontinuouswith the Invisible Spirit but identical with Barbelo in its second (Mental-ity/Knowledge) phase, and in its intermediate, emanative (Vitality/Activity)phase, it is simultaneously continuous—but sufficiently discontinuous tobe distinguishable as a separate hypostasis—with both the Invisible Spiritand Barbelo.10In spite of minor differences in nomenclature, the structuraland functional similarity of the triad in the Parmenides Commentaryandin the Platonizing Sethian treatises is clear. However, the Commentary,like196John D. Turner10Its initial mode is that of Existence, a phase of rest or permanence (monhv), inwhich it is identical with its source, the Unknowable Invisible Spirit. In the phaseof emanation (provodo\"), it enters the mode of Vitality (also identified as “EternalLife,” XI 66,33), a boundlessness from which emanates a “shadow” or projectedimage. In a third phase of reversion (ejpistrofhv) upon the Invisible Spirit as itssource, this “shadow” enters the phase of Mentality and achieves substantial real-ity as the Barbelo-Aeon, the self-knowledge of the Invisible Spirit (XI 49,18–21)."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"the Three Steles of Seth,understands the triad as the three phases of Intel-lect’s (Barbelo) self-deployment, while Zostrianostends to conceive it asthe three emanative phases of the (Triple-Powered) Invisible Spirit, andAllogenesand Marsanestend to confer an independent hypostatic statuson the triad in the figure of the Triple-Powered One interposed betweenthe supreme Unknowable One and his separate Intellect, the Aeon of Bar-belo. Hence the Triple-Powered One serves to emphasize the transcen-dence of the Invisible Spirit, but at the same time to prevent any ultimategap in the chain of being.To complicate matters further, Allogenesattributes directly to theUnknowable One or Invisible Spirit a similar-sounding triad of attributes,but characterizes them as acts (i.e., ei\\nai, zh'n, noei'n) rather than qualities(u{parxi\"or ojntovth\"or oujsioth\", zwovth\", noovth\") or substances (o[n, zwhv,nou'\"): he exists, lives, and knows without mind, life, or existence (61,32–39).11This is a classic example of ranking by paronymns.126132Now he is 33an entity insofar as he exists, in that he either 34existsand will become, 35or {acts} <lives> or knows, although he {lives}<acts> 36without Mind 37or Life or Existence 38or Nonexistence, 39incomprehen-sibly.Bearing in mind that the Aeon of Barbelo, called “an Eternal Life” in XI66,30–34, is considered to be the “knowledge” or “first thought” of theInvisible Spirit (51,8–32), to contain the perfect Mind Protophanes, and, inits Kalyptos-level, to contain the realm of pure being (ta; o[ntw\" o[nta), onemight combine the techniques of paronymy, relative predominance andmutual implication by cyclic permutation (see XI 49,26–38 and ProclusElem.

One may argue for thechronological priority of Zostrianosover Allogeneson two principalgrounds: 1) It evinces traditional Sethian baptismal concerns and there-fore maintains greater proximity to earlier Sethian material, and 2) thehostile reception of the Platonically-inspired content of AllogenesandZostrianosamong the members of Plotinus’ seminars in early third-century Rome (Porphyry, Vita Plotini16) seems more directed to Zostri-anosthan to Allogenes.In contrast to the other three treatises of thisgroup, Zostrianoscontains a number of specific features singled out forcriticism and ridicule by Plotinus towards the end (Enn.II, 9 [33]) of hisantignostic Gross-Schrift:the story of the “fall” of Sophia; many instancesof glossalalia; frequent lists of multiple divine beings whose names mayhave seemed to have magical import; and various technical terms denot-ing levels of reality in addition to those of the Invisible Spirit, Triple-Powered One, and the tripartite Barbelo-Aeon, such as the Antitypoi,theParoikeseis,the Metanoiaiand the Ge Aerodios.Since such featureswere criticized by Plotinus himself, and since the late and spurious char-acter of Zostrianoswas pointed out by Porphyry, and since Ameliuscomposed a 40 volume refutation of the same work, one might surmisethat Allogenes, which lacks these features, was composed as a refine-ment of Zostrianosthat would be more acceptable to the circle of Plot-inus by virtue of a clearer and more accurate and technical expositionof the ontology and visionary ascent basic to Zostrianos freed from itsobjectionable excesses.19200John D. Turner17This is the Großschriftrecognized by R. Harder, “Ein neue Schrift Plotins,”Hermes71 (1936): 1–10, repr. in Kleine Schriften(ed. W. Marg; Munich, 1960),257–74. The unpublished paper of R. T. Wallis, “Plotinus and the Gnostics: The NagHammadi Texts” (23 pp.; summarized by me in “Gnosticism and Platonism,”455–56) gives a thorough demonstration of the relation between Zostrianosand thegnostics with whom Plotinus remonstrates.18B. A. Pearson (“Introduction,” 229–50) suggests that the name Marsanes, men-tioned in the Untitled text of the Bruce Codex (235.13–23 Schmidt and MacDermot)in connection with Nicotheos (and Marsianos in Epiphanius’s account of theArchontics, Pan.40.7.6), reflects a Syrian background for its author, and datesMarsanesin the early third century. But one may also argue for dating it to the lastquarter of the third century in that it posits an unknown Silent One above even theInvisible Spirit in much the same way that Iamblichus during this same periodposited an ineffable One beyond even the Plotinian One that heads the noetic triad(apud Damascius Princ.1.86.3–6; 101.14–15; 103.6–10 Ruelle).19R.

In the case of Zostrianos,so many of whose fea-tures are echoed in Plotinus’s critique of the gnostics,20it seems nearly cer-tain that Plotinus’s circle had some earlier Greek version of this Copticdocument in view during the course of his refutations of the gnostics, andthat it is this treatise that Porphyry regarded as late and spurious, andagainst which Amelius composed a forty-book refutation. Of course, sinceboth Allogenesand Zostrianosare extant only in Coptic translation andeach bears traces of redaction and literary dependency, one cannot be cer-tain of the precise version of these treatises available to Plotinus and hiscircle. Assuming Zostrianos is pre-Plotinian or at least predates his anti-gnostic Großschrift,then—aside from some of Plotinus’s early doctrines—one would expect to find the most likely sources of Zostrianos’sphilosophical conceptuality in pre-Plotinian sources such as the Neopy-thagorean technical arithmetical treatises of Nicomachus and Theon, theepitome of Albinus/Alcinoos, and the theological doxographies of Moder-atus, Numenius, Amelius, Cronius, and the Chaldean Oracles,which areequally if not more fragmentary than Zostrianos.And, should it turn out tobe pre-Plotinian and not written by Porphyry, the anonymous ParmenidesCommentarywould also have to be considered as a very likely source.4. The Platonizing Sethian Treatises As Post-Porphyrian: Abramowski and MajercikIn the two decades following my completion of the 1990 editio princepsof Allogenes,I have considered both Allogenesand Zostrianosto be pre-Plotinian works. However, in 1983, Luise Abramowski, and in 1990, RuthMajercik have called this early dating into question.21In 1993, I attemptedto address Majercik’s thesis of a post-Porphyrian date for these treatises:The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises20120Specifically, the idea that Sophiais derivative and alien (Zost.NHC VIII9,65–11, 9; cf. Enn.5.8 [31].5), or that Soul or Sophiadeclined and put on humanbodies, or that Sophiaillumined the darkness, producing an image in matter, whichin turn produces an image of the image (2.9 [33].10; cf. Plotinus’s own version ofthis in 3.9 [13].2!); the idea of a demiurge whose activity gives rise to aeonic copies(antitypoi), “repentances,” and “sojourns” (2.9 [33].6) or an “alien earth” (2.9 [33].11;cf. the “atmospheric realm,” geaerodiosof NHC VIII 5,10–29; 8,9–16; 12,4–21); theunnecessary multiplication of Hypostases; and the conception of secondary knowl-edge of yet a higher knowledge (Enn.2.9 [33].1; cf. NHC VIII 82,1–13).21See L. Abramowski, “Marius Victorinus, Porphyrius und die römischen Gnos-tiker,” ZNW74 (1983): 108–28; and R. Majercik, “The Being-Life-Mind Triad inGnosticism and Neoplatonism,” CQ42 (1992): 475–88."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"R. Majercik has recently argued that these treatises neither predate norare contemporaneous with Plotinus, on the grounds that: the triadicgroupings used in them have an explicit and fixed form uncharacteristicof Plotinus; their technical use of the term u{parxi\"for the first memberof the Existence-Vitality-Mentality triad has no specific significance forPlotinus (who employs the nomenclature Being-Life-Mind); and thenomenclature of these triads on various levels reflects a method ofparonymy and doctrine of predominance and cyclical implication like-wise uncharacteristic of Plotinus. Instead, [Majercik here shares the view-point of L. Abramowski that] all of these features are found in Plotinus’disciple Porphyry, whose lost commentary on the Chaldaean Oracles(and perhaps the anonymous Parmenidescommentary attributed to himby P. Hadot) must have been the Greek source that mediated them notonly to the Sethian treatises, but also to the Christian Neoplatonists Vic-torinus and Synesius.22In the light of such considerations, these Platonizing Sethian treatisescould not have been the same texts known to Plotinus but instead arerevisions of earlier works in the wake of Porphyry’s and Amelius’s attacks(Vit. Plot. 16): “the Gnostics in Rome—in light of this criticism [of thegnostic revelations mentioned in Vit. Plot.16]—revised their revelations(or produced new revelations) to conform more closely to the teachingsof the great Porphyry—a politic way to gain intellectual credibility inRoman philosophical circles.” The gnostics depend on Porphyry, and theterminus a quofor the present form of Allogenes,the Three Steles of Seth,and Zostrianosis at least 268 C.E. (the approximate year of Plotinus’sdeath) and, more reasonably still, since the Nag Hammadi library wasprobably buried in the Egyptian desert circa 350, any time during the firstquarter of the fourth century. But this need not be the case, as I sug-gested in 1993:However, the principle of mutual implication and predominance isclearly present already in Plotinus (e.g., Enn.V.8.4.7–24), Numenius (frg.41 des Places), and perhaps in the Chaldaean Oracles(frgs. 21, 27), andthe dependence of Victorinus on Porphyry does not mean that Porphyryis the ultimate source of the terms triduvnamo\"or ojntovth\"(neither occurin Porphyry’s extant works), u{parxi\"(which occurs also in Plutarch,Philo, Alexander of Aphrodisias, as well as Porphyry), oujsiovth\"(alsooccurring earlier in Albinus/Alcinous, Didask.X.3.7), zwovth\", andnoovth\". The ultimate source of these ideas probably cannot be identifiedas a particular individual, but more than likely they stem from MiddlePlatonic sources referred to in the philosophical exchange within Ploti-nus’ circle in Rome 244–269 CE, which included not only Plotinus, 202John D. Turner22“Typologies of the Sethian Gnostic Treatises from Nag Hammadi,” 205–6."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Porphyry, and Amelius, but also quite likely proponents of these self-same Platonizing Sethian treatises.235. The Platonizing Sethian Treatises Are Middle Platonic: Corrigan contra MajercikIn a much more thoroughgoing way, Kevin Corrigan’s “The Anony-mous Turin Commentary on the Parmenidesand the Distinction betweenEssence and Existence in Middle Platonism, Plotinus’s Circle, and SethianGnostic Texts” (herein cited as “The Anonymous Turin Commentary”; therevised version of this paper in the present volume, “Platonism and Gnos-ticism. The Anonymous Commentary on the Parmenides:Middle or Neo-platonic?” is here cited as “Platonism and Gnosticism”), argues thatZostrianosand Allogenespredate not only Porphyry, but also Plotinus:their metaphysics are Middle Platonic. In response to Majercik’s thesis of apost-Porphyrian date for Allogenesand Zostrianos,Corrigan observes (“Pla-tonism and Gnosticism,” Appendix IV: “The Pre-Plotinian Character of theGnostic Triads,” 168–69; cf. 156 in the main article):The explicit gnostic triads are much more plausibly pre-Plotinian Pla-tonic elaborations in the Chaldean tradition, of the type, for instance,that Amelius develops in a Neopythagorean manner. Second, all thepositive evidence, as we have argued above, points to the pre-Plotinianorigin of some variant of the u{parxi\"-duvnami\"-nou'\"triad. Third, themethod of paronyms that seems to give rise to the ojnotvth\"-zwovth\"-noovth\"triad is surely also familiar in Middle Platonism. Aujtovth\"andeJterovth\"are attested to in “Pythagorean” thought by Sextus Empiricus(Math.2.248–84), and in Albinus (Did.10.164) in a section on God,there occurs a triad of adjectival epithets (aujtotelhv\"-aujtotelhv\"-pan-telhv\") followed by five substantial ones: divinity (qeiovth\"), substantial-ity (oujsiovth\"), Truth (ajlhvqeia), Symmetry (summetriva), Good (ajgaqovn).Qeiovth\"and oujsiovth\"also occur in the Corp. herm.12.1. So the methodof paronyms is also conspicuously Middle Platonic and so too are theprinciples of predominance and implication, an admittedly rudimentaryversion of which we find in the passage immediately following in theDidaskalikos:the primary god is the Good because he benefits all thingsaccording to their capacities, the Beautiful insofar as he is in his ownnature perfect and commensurable, and Truth because he is the originof truth (164.32–40).24The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises20323Ibid., 206.24Corrigan mentions further examples of important paronyms and rudimentaryversions of later triadic schemata, as well as of the principle of predominance, in"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Observing that “these Gnostic writings would not have caused the obviousreaction Porphyry claims they did were they not inherently or (perhapsbetter) overtly philosophical in the first place (and perhaps exhibiting atendency to become even more so, if we were able to date the SethianGnostic treatises in their chronological order), and did they not make thestrong claim, clearly abhorrent to Plotinus, that they were interpreting Platoin some distinctive Platonist fashion” (“The Anonymous Turin Commen-tary,” 30), Corrigan concludes:the texts we possess are (1) most likely to be in nucewhat Plotinus,Amelius, and Porphyry actually read and (2) to have been dependentupon some earlier or contemporary Platonic commentary on the Par-menidessuch as was also available and read in the Plotinian school (Cor-rigan, “Platonism and Gnosticism,” 155)On the other hand, Corrigan agrees with Majercik that the PlatonizingSethian treatises are dependent on the anonymous Commentary:on the basis of all the positive evidence it is most plausible to suppose (1)that the Commentarycould nothave been written by Porphyry and that itmust be earlier than Plotinus, (2) that the ‘Sethian’ Gnostic texts of the NagHammadi library, to which Porphyry appears to refer in the Life of Plotinus(Vit. Plot.) chapter 16, are dependent upon the Commentary,(3) that someversion of these texts (and necessarily a philosophical version) was the sub-ject of Amelius’s refutation in forty volumes (as Porphyry tells us in the Lifeof Plotinus),and (4) that Plotinus “replies” in the four works of theGroßschriftto gnostic doctrine in general and also, probably in part, tosome version of the gnostic texts. I therefore make the CommentaryMid-dle Platonic (of Neopythagorean provenance), put the Sethian gnostic textsafter the Commentary,and place the Großschriftand subsequent treatisesin the Enneadsas in some measure developing innovative philosophicalsolutions in reply to gnostic, and other, challenges and problems. (Corrigan,“Platonism and Gnosticism,” 142–44)Instead, the Commentaryis a pre-Plotinian Middle Platonic work in theNeopythagorean tradition of interpretation “possibly from the ‘school’ of204John D.

Appendix IV: “The Pre-Plotinian Character of theGnostic Triads”).25By contrast with the more or less serial listing used bythe Commentaryand the Sethian treatises to describe the sequence ofphases or moments in the complex generation of intellect, “Plotinus is notconcerned with schemata but with the linking of the generative processand the dynamic nature of a hypostasis by means of a single thought pat-tern, which articulates the complexity of the hypostasis” (Corrigan, “Pla-tonism and Gnosticism,” 157).6. The Parmenides CommentaryIs Anonymous and Middle Platonic:Corrigan contra HadotSince 1980, all discussion of the Platonizing treatises has made referenceto the occurrence of the Existence-Life-Intellect triad as it occurs in theanonymous Parmenides Commentary,under the assumption that Hadot hadcorrectly assigned it to Porphyry. Now in 1995, we return to the question ofthe relative position of the Platonizing Sethian treatises within the spectrumof the Platonism of the first three centuries, but from a new perspective onthe pivotal position of that commentary within the Platonic tradition.Since the views of Majercik and Abramowski depend on P. Hadot’sattribution to Porphyry of both the Existence-Life-Mind triad and the Par-menides Commentaryin which it is found, Corrigan devotes the first sec-tion of his paper to an examination of the principal grounds of Hadot’sthesis, namely that the Commentarypresupposes the Plotinian doctrine ofthe One and Intellect and that it presupposes Plotinus’s groundbreakingtheological interpretation of the Parmenides,but in such a way as to gowell beyond Plotinus’s views; therefore the Commentarywas producedbetween 270 C.E. and the first half of the fifth century, during which periodthe only likely candidate for author was Porphyry. The basic grounds forHadot’s thesis are each open to question (summarizing Corrigan, “Platon-ism and Gnosticism,” Appendix I: “The Theses of Pierre Hadot on theAnonymous Parmenides Commentaryand Porphyry”):1. In response to Hadot’s claim that the Commentarynecessarily presup-poses Plotinus’s doctrine of the One as well as Plotinus’s interpretation ofthe Parmenides,Corrigan points out that on Plotinus’s own testimony hissystem of hypostases, including his doctrine of the One and Intellect, wasshared by other Middle Platonic thinkers.The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises20525On this whole issue, see now G. Bechtle, The Anonymous Commentary onPlato’s «Parmenides»(Berner Reihe philosophischer Studien 22; Bern: Paul Haupt,1999)."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"206John D. Turner2. To Hadot’s claim that the Commentarypresupposes Plotinus’s doctrineof intellect but goes far beyond this in deriving a second act of intellectas an unfolding out of, and original identity with, the primordial unity ofthe first immobile self-standing act, Corrigan argues that all of the so-called innovations in the Commentaryare already to be found in Ploti-nus, and there is a remarkable affinity in thought between Plotinus,Amelius, and the anonymous commentator that stem from a still earliertradition of commentary necessitated by the need for an intelligent read-ing of difficult passages in Plato’s Parmenides.The commentator’s doc-trine of participation, that the Second One receives being from the ideaof being that is the First One, is the sort of participation that both Syri-anus and Proclus specifically deny to Porphyry but attribute to earlierpre-Plotinian Middle Platonic and Neopythagorean thinkers like Nume-nius, Cronius, and Amelius.3. The two states of intellect theory in the Commentary,according to whichin Hadot’s estimation we are virtually dealing with two intellects, one thatcontemplates intelligible objects, and another that engages in an absolute,transcendent, objectless knowing, is much more comparable to MiddlePlatonic doctrine (e.g. Chaldean Oracles,Numenius, or even Amelius) aswell as to early tendencies in Plotinus’s writings to split intellect intotwo—a “standing” and a “moving” intellect, e.g., 3.9 [13].1.4. The commentator’s description of the dynamic process of Intellect’s“autoposition” that Hadot characterizes as clearly post-Plotinian is alreadypresent in Plotinus’s exploration of the ambiguities of the “traveling sub-ject in the logic of generation” in a manner similar to the commentator,though without explicitly invoking the being-life-thought triad used by thecommentator (and, I might add, by the authors of Allogenesand Zostri-anos). In fact, Plotinus’s (Enn.6.7 [38].13.16–21) three-phase process con-sisting of (1) an immobile motion, (2) a moment of static identity, and (3)a moment of burgeoning duality based on motion and otherness are quitelikely already formulaic in the Neopythagorean language of processionand conversion (e.g., Moderatus) and the tradition of deriving a dyad froma monad (e.g., Nicomachus, Theon).Corrigan’s conclusion is clear:There is, therefore, less and less reason to believe that Porphyry is nec-essarily the author of the anonymous Commentary.All the evidence indi-cates that the doctrines of the Commentaryare perfectly compatible withMiddle Platonist thought and also with some important passages in theEnneadswhich themselves in turn relate to earlier Middle Platonic andNeopythagorean doctrines. My preliminary conclusion here, then, is thatwe should take Plotinus’ own word in V, 1 (10) as sufficient assurance thatthe vast majority of his doctrines are not original with him. What we seein Plotinus is a new way of doing philosophy (one of course very muchrelated to the palaia philosophiaof Plato and Aristotle), and not the sortof doxography which might permit us to establish a terminus a quoon"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"this issue. The straightforward evidence then should be given moreweight: the Commentaryis anonymous and there is nothing in it whichcould not be Middle Platonic. Conspicuous doctrines of the Commentaryappear in certain Sethian Gnostic texts which appear to be (very roughly)contemporary with Plotinus. Therefore, it is more reasonable to suppose,if there is nothing to the contrary, that the Commentary is pre-Plotinian.(Corrigan, “The Anonymous Turin Commentary,” 24)7. Plotinus’s Antignostic GroßschriftPresupposes the PlatonizingSethian TreatisesIn part 2 of his paper, Corrigan argues (“Platonism and Gnosticism,”156): (1) that the Sethian gnostic texts are, most probably, dependent uponthe anonymous Commentaryrather than vice versa; (2) that in Middle Pla-tonism and in Amelius one of the hidden problems of Timaeus-interpreta-tion, possibly prompted in part by gnostic attacks and an appropriation ofPlato, was the development of a prefigurative intelligible biology withinwhich the interpretation of Aristotelian thought in the service of Platostarted to figure more prominently; (3) “that this trend evident in the Com-mentaryand to a lesser extent in the existence-essence distinctions in theSethian gnostic texts led to a new and much more developed distinctionbetween essence and existence in Plotinus; (4) that this Plotinian distinc-tion is to be related in the first place (i.e., chronologically) to theGroßschriftas a whole and that it most likely presupposes (a) the morerudimentary version of the triadic distinction of the Commentaryand (b)the more varied versions of the Sethian gnostic texts; and finally (5) thatimportant elements in the structure of the Großschriftpresuppose signifi-cant motifs, images, and ideas in the Sethian gnostic texts” (not necessar-ily, however, in precisely the form we now have them).7.1. The Sethian Treatises Depend upon the Anonymous CommentaryTo a large extent, Corrigan’s case for the dependence of Allogenes’andZostrianos’s “Platonic-Pythagorean” doctrine of “the emergence of a sec-ond One as an indefinite movement which by conversion knows both itselfand its principle” upon the Commentaryor its equivalent rests on the strik-ing—thus noncoincidental—similarity between fragments 12 and 14 of theCommentary(cited above, p. 195) and AllogenesXI 48,6–49,37 and Zost.66,14–75,11 (cited above, pp. 192–94). It seems to me that these parallelsare clearly sufficient to establish this claim.Michel Tardieu has also recently argued that Zostrianoswas circulatedand read in Plotinus’s Roman seminar (Porphyry Vit. Plot.16): “the totalityof Zostrianos—whose content we know through the Coptic version in theNag Hammadi Codices—was already written in 263, at the time of theThe Setting of the Platonizing Treatises207"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"arrival of the Gnostics in the School of Plotinus.”26Moreover, it shares aword-for-word negative theological source with book 1 of Marius Victori-nus’s treatise Against Arius(VIII 64,13–66,11 = Ar.1.49.9-40, cited above,pp. 184–85), which must depend upon a pre-Plotinian interpretation of theParmenidessimilar to but not identical with the Anonymous Commentary.What is more, it appears that the anonymousParmenides commentary thatHadot has attributed to Porphyry contains a statement27that depends uponboth the Chaldean Oracles28and the theological source common to Vic-torinus29and Zostrianos;30thus this common negative theological sourcepredates even the Anonymous Commentary.31 Taken together, these 208John D.

Middle Platonic Adaptations of Aristotle: Albinus, Numenius, Amelius,the Chaldean Oracles,and the Divine IntellectAlbinus, Numenius, and Amelius are three philosophers who pressedAristotle’s doctrine of God as a self-thinking intellect into the service ofMiddle Platonic thought concerning the relation between God, the ideas,and the demiurgic intellect in order to show how the being, life, andthought that characterize our own experience are in fact prefigurativelyarticulated on the transcendent plane in the form of an eternally actualintellect (see Corrigan, “Platonism and Gnosticism,” Appendix IV: “ThePre-Plotinian Character of the Gnostic Triads”).The tripartition of the divine Intellect into a contemplated, a contem-plating, and a demiurgic intellect in these thinkers might be compared withAllogenes(NHC XI 51,12–37), where Kalyptos is associated with theauthentic existents, Protophanes with the reason that intelligizes (novero\"lovgo\") these and acts within particulars with ejpisthvmhand tevcnh, andAutogenes as the one that knows and acts upon the defects of nature in aparticular manner; and finally the divine Triple Male is regarded as the The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises209Père à la fois s’est dérobé (= reste seul) et n’enferme pas dans sa puissance le feuqui lui est propre, il ne reste donc pas seul et se déploie; 3) Porphyre, enfin,affirme, avec les Oracles,que l’Un se dérobe, et, avec l’exposé, que sa puissanceest co-unifiée dans la simplicité.

Implications of the Middle Platonic Prefigurative Intelligible Biology forPlotinus: Intellect As Determinate LifeAlso in part 2 of his original paper (“The Anonymous Turin Com-mentary,” 47–52), Corrigan tried to show that the prefigurative intelligiblebiology based on the application of Aristotelian to Platonic thought evi-dent in the Commentaryand in the existence-essence distinctions in theSethian gnostic texts leads to a new, more developed distinction betweenessence and existence in Plotinus. Specifically, Corrigan argues (1) thatPlotinus, over the course of a long argument in 6.7 [38].18–23, 31–42,makes a highly developed and subtle distinction between what we mightcall essence and existence (that is, determinate being or substance, on theone hand, and unrestricted being or infinitival existence, on the other); (2)that this distinction attempts to show what thinking is and how it origi-nates by means of a single power and activity, itself transcendent of allthought, which nonetheless constitutes the multiplicity of the intelligibleworld and at the same time appears to be the prefigurative model of allsubsequent activities and developmental potencies; (3) that this distinctionis reached by means of a highly creative use of Aristotelian thought—implicitly “entelechy” doctrine (the three moments of basic entelechydevelopment, duvnami\"-e{xi\"-ejnevrgeia); (4) that this development was mostlikely prompted partly by Plotinus’s reflection upon the more rudimentarydistinction between essence and existence to be found in the Commen-tary,the Chaldean Oracles(according to testimony), and especially someof the more philosophical Sethian gnostic texts; (5) that the essence-existence distinction in 6.7 [38] is plausibly related to Plotinus’s gnostic cri-tique in the Großschrift;(6) that the sort of subtlety Plotinus’s analysesdemonstrate is legitimately to be explained as a reflection upon some ofthe major problems Gnosticism poses; and (7) that this casts significantlight upon the interaction between Platonist gnostics and the Platonist Plo-tinian circle.Corrigan observes that this new view in Plotinus is related (eitherdirectly or indirectly) to motifs in the Sethian gnostic texts (particularly theproblem how differences arise in things, how particular properties have atranscendental source, and how diversity springs from unity; e.g., Zost. VIII15–17 (cited below, pp. 222–23), MarsanesX 7–9 (cited above, pp. 191–92),and also to the problem of apparent intelligible individuals in intellect thatare barren and generate nothing, AllogenesXI 49,21–25 (cited above, p.193), and yet it goes far beyond anything we find in those texts.The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises211"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"In tracing out this new Aristotelian-Platonic tendency in Platonicthought, Corrigan compares the Commentaryand some passages of theEnneadson the role of zwhv. In the anonymous Commentary,at the sec-ond moment of the intellectual triad (life), when intellect passes from exis-tence (u{parxi\") to the thinking subject (eij\" to; noou'n) in order to comeback up again to the intelligible object and see itself, the thinking subjectis life, “which is why it is indefinite according to life” (cited above, p. 196),i.e., an indefinite duality. According to Enn.2.4 [12].5.29–34, movementand otherness grew together out of the First and were indefinite (ajovris-ton) as from the First, but defined when they turn back to it. According toEnn.6.7 [38].17 (cited below, n. 33), intellect’s life is the trace of the giver,which shines out from the One as manifold and unbounded: “It was [h\\n]indefinite insofar as it looked to [blevpousa] That, but insofar as it hadlooked” (blevyasa), it became limited in itself without implying any limit inthe One. To distinguish phases or moments in the complex generation ofintellect by careful use of verbal tense and aspect instead of the rathermore simplistic serial representation found in the Commentaryfurther sug-gests the latter’s pre-Plotinian provenance.While the triadic schemata in the Commentaryare relatively simpleand related to Middle Platonic preoccupations as evinced particularly inAlbinus, the Chaldean Oracles,and the Neopythagoreans, the Sethiangnostic texts manifest a more complex linking of moments such as Corri-gan discovers in Amelius. Moreover, the greater variety and proliferation oftriads in the Sethian gnostic texts suggests to Corrigan that their innovativeappropriation of Middle Platonic tradition must postdate the Commentary(“Platonism and Gnosticism,” 157).8. Results for the Historical Setting of the Parmenides Commentary,Zostrianos,and AllogenesIf Corrigan’s conclusions be accepted as sound, the conceptual sphereof Middle Platonic metaphysics is larger and more varied than we oncebelieved. The doctrine of a tripartite divine intellect containing not only thedemiurgic intelligence but also the Platonic ideas as its thoughts have begunto coalesce with various Neopythagorean emanative schemes according towhich the multiplicity of the sensible world is derived from an original uni-tary principle. The principal means of articulating this combination werevarious triadic schemes that attempted to identify the conceptually distinctstages of the unfolding of the divine intelligence from its unitary source.One such triadic scheme at home in the Chaldean tradition—though notexplicitly in the Oracles—was the u{parxi\"-duvnami\"-nou'\"sequence. To avoidthe notion that these entities were a succession of independent products oroffspring, such conceptual devices as the principles of predominance, of212John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"mutual implication through cyclic permutation, and the method ofparonymns were devised to illustrate how being or substance might derivefrom sheer act, or alternatively how actuality in plurality might derive fromsheer unity and potential existence. The principal thinkers involved in thisdevelopment were the likes of Moderatus, Nicomachus, Theon, Numenius,the author(s) of the Chaldean Oracles,Albinus, and Amelius.Corrigan has argued that the emanative metaphysics and the triadicschemes of the Platonizing Sethian treatises are to be interpreted againstsuch a background. Among these texts, Zostrianosand Allogenesare mostlikely to be (at least in nuce) what Plotinus, Amelius, and Porphyry actuallyread and critiqued. They in turn are dependent upon some earlier or con-temporary Platonic commentary on the Parmenidessuch as was also avail-able and read in the Plotinian school, in particular the anonymous Turinpalimpsest Commentary on the Parmenidespublished by Kroll and Hadot.PaceHadot and the generation of scholars (including me) that have builton his work, the Commentaryis not likely to be by Porphyry and does notnecessarily presuppose Plotinus’s philosophical analysis of Plato. Ratherthan being post-Plotinian or even post-Porphyrian, the Sethian Platonizingtexts are contemporary with or slightly prior to Plotinus, who knew theircontent and engaged in a critical dialogue with them and their proponentsin his “antignostic” Großschriftand subsequent works. The PlatonizingSethian treatises are to be placed before the Großschriftbut after the Com-mentary,whose schemata (Existence-Life-Thought/Being-Vitality-Mentality)are relatively simple Middle Platonic constructions in comparison to thegreater variety and number of triads in the Sethian treatises. Moreover, thecomparatively elementary distinction maintained in both the Commentaryand the Sethian treatises between pure, unqualified existence and the realmof determined being prompt Plotinus to devote the Großschriftand subse-quent works to the clarification and extension of various Middle Platonicattempts to explain the Timaeus’s picture of the relation between the intel-ligible and sensible realms by developing an “intelligible biology” derivedfrom Aristotle’s analysis of thinking to show how the vitality of the sensibleworld was already prefigured in the divine intellect.In addition to these conclusions, with which I substantially agree, itseems to me that among the Platonizing Sethian treatises read in Plotinus’scircle, the chronological priority of composition belongs to Zostrianosandthat it is also Zostrianosthat is the primary target of the various antignos-tic critiques of Plotinus and his colleagues, although they also had accessat least to Allogenesas well. By contrast, Allogenesseems remarkably freeof the specific objectionable features singled out by Plotinus in the con-cluding section of the Großschrift(see above, p. 196).It may very well be that Allogeneswas composed partly as a revisionof the triadic metaphysics of Zostrianos.

The doctrine of thethree-phase generation of the Aeon of Barbelo from the unfolding of thethreefold potency of the Invisible Spirit, scattered about through Zostri-anos,is gathered together into the initial revelations of Youel on pages45–49. Instead of limiting the visionary ascent to the Protophanes-level ofthe Barbelo Aeon, Allogenesportrays an additional ascent through the var-ious levels of the Triple-Powered One, which appears to have been pro-moted from a dynamic modalistic process inherent within the InvisibleSpirit to a separately existing, quasi-hypostatic entity between a supremeUnknowable One and the Barbelo Aeon. Rather than interpreting thestages of the ascent as a sequence of baptisms administered by a pluralityof revealers (Authrounios, Ephesech, and Youel), Allogenesstructures theascent into a set of instructions by Youel prior to the ascent through theBarbelo Aeon. By placing the “primary revelation” of the supremeunknown One in the context of Allogenes’ ascent through the levels of theTriple-Powered One, Allogenessupplements the negative-theological reve-lation of the Triple-Powered Invisible Spirit in Zostrianosby means of atechnique of learned ignorance similar to that of fragment 1 of theChaldean Oraclesand fragment 2 (p. 91 verso) of the Parmenides Com-mentary.In short, Allogenesrestructures the metaphysics of Zostrianosintoa tighter, more systematic framework, limits the metaphysical exposition tothe transcendent spheres extending from the intellectual levels of the Bar-belo Aeon to the supreme Invisible Spirit, more clearly articulates theprocess by which the Barbelo Aeon emanates from the Invisible Spirit,omits most instances of ecstatic praise and lists of divine beings, and freesthe whole from a baptismal context. Omission of the role of Sophia andthe Archon as well as the extensive discussion on the various types of soulsentails a shift of attention away from the physical and psychological doc-trine of the Phaedoand Timaeustoward the more specifically theologicalissues of the Parmenides.The result has a remarkable, if not intentional,resemblance to Diotima’s initiation of Socrates into the mysteries of Eros,supplemented by the apophatic approach to the One in the Parmenides.The effect is to produce a work of enhanced acceptability to the criticalconcerns of Plotinus’s circle without abandoning the essential divinebeings of Sethianism and its commitment to the authority of revelation.9. Life: A Prefigurative Intelligible Biology and the Gnostic ContributionIt seems that one of the major accomplishments of Middle Platonismwas the recognition that the chain of the derivation of the pluriform worldfrom an original unity demanded at some point the introduction of theprinciple of Life. Certainly it was a central problem for the Platonic pro-gram and for the “friends of the forms,” confronted by the opposition214John D. Turner"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"between true being apprehensible by mind alone through reason and therealm of becoming apprehensible by body through sensation, to conceivehow thought, as an activity of soul, the principle of change and motion,could have a place in the real world: were the truly real to be devoid oflife and any sort of movement, thought would be impossible (Soph.248e).This clearly calls for an interpretation of the process- or movement-oriented language implied by intellect and thought, as recognized also byAristotle (in Metaph.1072b13–19), to the effect that by participation in theintelligible, intellect thinks itself; becoming the intelligent recipient of sub-stance and intelligible object, it acts in “having” them, and that act is see-ing. Rather than a static state of merely containing the objects ofintellection, in God the activity of thought is life; indeed God isthat activ-ity (See Corrigan, “Platonism and Gnosticism,” Appendix V: “Numeniusand Amelius”).As Corrigan notes, Amelius too (apud Proclus In Tim.3.103.18–104.8)dealt similarly with the theme of transcendental intellectual movement,dividing the activity of the divine intelligence into the three phases ofbeing, having, and seeing, on the basis of Tim.39e. The same passageinvited the early Plotinus (Enn.3.9 [13].1) to distinguish three aspects ofthe divine intellect, a static, contemplated one, an active contemplatingone, and a third, discursive or planning one. On the basis of this mostpregnant passage, Numenius even earlier conceived his second God as adivine intellect generating itself and the sensible cosmos by a contempla-tive “seeing” of the first God, who thinks only insofar as he makes use ofthis second God (frgs. 20–22 des Places), who by preoccupation with mat-ter gives rise to a third planning intellect.Oddly enough, even though the supreme principle of Tim.39e is “thetruly living being,” these Middle Platonic interpretations of the phases of thedivine intellect do not seem to trade specifically in the concept of tran-scendental Life in quite the same way as one finds in the passages just citedfrom the Sophistand the Metaphysics.Yet when one turns to the Platoniz-ing Sethian treatises, the anonymous Parmenides Commentary,and thelater treatises of Plotinus, the term “life” and cognates assumes a central rolein the generation of substantial reality, perhaps owing to the influence ofthose and other passages from Plato and Aristotle. But what, we might ask,was the catalyst that caused this preoccupation with life as a designation forthe median phase in the movement from the apparent static transcendenceof the supreme One to the manifestation of a demiurgic intellect or worldsoul that occupies itself with the physical world of becoming?In his early to middle treatises Plotinus employs a three-stage deploy-ment of defined reality from the One. For instance, in 2.4 [12].5, intellect isthe end product of a movement and otherness that emerge from the First;they were indefinite (ajovriston) as from the First but defined when theyThe Setting of the Platonizing Treatises215"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"turn back to it. Here the median term is an implicit duality “indefinitedyad,” not yet fully formed that emanates from the One to form definedBeing. In 5.2 [11].1.7–9, the superabundant perfection of the One over-flows and makes “another” (a[llo), which product turns back to the One(and, as Corrigan, “Gnosticism and Platonism,” 148, notes, “to itself”emphasis added), is “filled,” and becomes Intellect by looking towards it(or itself). On the other hand, in later treatises, especially those that followthe Großschrift,the term zwhvbegins to appear. Thus in 6.6 [34].9.39–40there is a triadic succession of Being or unified multiplicity, movement ofIntellect unraveling number into pure unities that form the content of theLiving Creature or Life, which includes and unifies them all. In 6.7[38].16.11–23, potential intellect, looking unintellectually at the One, livingtoward it and turning toward it, as a movement “being filled” and “filling,”becomes intellect as the unified totality of all these moments. Again, in 6.7[38].17, intellect’s life is the trace of the One, which “shines out” from theOne as manifold, indefinite, and unbounded (cf. the indefinite duality of5.1 [10].6–7), but became bounded in itself without implying any limit inthe One; indeed, “intellect is bounded life” (26).33Clearly, this boundless life emanating from the One that we find inPlotinus’s later treatises, as well as in the Sethian treatises and in the anony-mous Commentary,play the same role as the indefinite duality inheritedfrom Plato’s unwritten doctrine and that certainly played a role in the216John D. Turner33In Enn.6.7 [38].17.12–43: “Intellect therefore had life and had no need of agiver full of variety, and its life was a trace of that Good and not his life. So whenits life was looking towards that it was unlimited, but after it had looked there itwas limited, though that Good has no limit. For immediately by looking to some-thing which is one the life is limited by it, and has in itself limit and bound andform; and the form was in that which was shaped, but the shaper was shapeless.But the boundary is not from outside, as if it was surrounded by a largeness, butit was a bounding limit of all that life which is manifold and unbounded, as a lifewould be which shines out from a nature of this kind . . . and it was defined asmany because of the multiplicity of its life, but on the other hand as one becauseof the defining limit. What then does ‘it was defined as one’ mean? Intellect: for lifedefined and limited is intellect. And what ‘as many’? Many intellects” (trans. Arm-strong). To distinguish phases of emanation, Plotinus uses a sequence of tenses(imperfect, present, and aorist) here and in 4.8 [6].1.1–11, etc., rather than the lesssophisticated serial listings found in the anonymous Commentaryand in some ofthe Sethian texts. The principle of Multiplicity, called “intelligible matter” in an ear-lier treatise (2.4) is here named “Life” (cf. also 6.5 [23].12.1–11; 2.4 [12].5.15–18).This entity, which is not hypostatized in his system, is characterized as an indefi-nite primary movement and otherness, a certain limitless and multiple trace of theOne that, once emitted, looks back upon its source and thereby becomes definedand limited in the form of Intellect, the second hypostasis."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"arithmological derivation schemes of contemporary Neopythagoreans.Thus in the anonymous Commentary,at the second moment of the intel-lectual triad (life), when intellect passes from existence (u{parxi\") to thethinking “it is indefinite according to life” (frg. 14.110.17–21 Hadot). Thismeans that before the subject turns back to existence and to the One, it isan indefinite duality. As life (kata; th;n zwhvn), it is “an activity moving outof existence” (ejk th'\" uJpavrxew\" ejkneuvsa\" ejnevrgeia).When the initial moment of Intellect as it emerges from the One ischaracterized in terms of indefiniteness, it is the interpretation of Plato’sParmenidesrather than Timaeusthat is in view. Depending upon theabsence or presence of a Unity or One-which-is acting as a Limit or prin-ciple of contrast and definition, the Unlimited Multitude of hypotheses 3(157B–158C) and 7 (164B–D) can be variously understood: in hypothesis2 (142B–145A), (1) in the absence of Unity, as an indefinite multitude withno distinct members, or (2) in the presence of Unity, as an indefinitelynumerous set of uniquely distinct members (thus generating the series ofintegral numbers); in hypothesis 3, as an indefiniteness arising fromabstracting out the Unity (i.e., unifying factor) of a whole with individualparts; and in hypothesis 7, in the absence of Unity, as the indefiniteness ofone multitude with respect to another.From these considerations, later Platonists derived from the firsthypothesis an absolutely unqualified One “beyond (determinate) being” atthe summit of their hierarchy of principles, a second principle of definedbeing and the multiple forms, and between the two as source of definedmultiplicity, an indefinite multiplicity readily identifiable with other fea-tures of Plato’s teaching, e.g., the otherness (qavteron) opposed to same-ness in the Timaeusand Sophist,the limit and unlimited of the Philebus,and the indefinite dyad of Plato’s unwritten teaching. Such speculationcomes into its own in first-century Neopythagoreanism: thus according toSimplicius (In phys.181.10–30 Diels) Eudorus (ca. 25 B.C.E.) posited asupreme One as the supreme God above another pair of principles, alower One, which he calls Monad, and its opposite, the Dyad. Thesupreme One is the cause of Matter and all else, while the Dyad pairedwith the Monad beneath it he calls the Indefinite Dyad. A similar doctrineis also found in the “Pythagorean” report of Sextus Empiricus (Math.10.261, 277):Thence moved, Pythagoras (i.e., Plato) declared that the One is the firstprinciple of existing things by participation in which each of the existingthings is said to be one. And this when conceived in self-identity [i.e.absolutely] is a Monad, but when in its otherness it is added to itself, itcreates the Indefinite Dyad.The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises217"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"218John D. TurnerA second-century elaboration of these metaphysical constructions isoffered by Moderatus, for whom the supreme principle is a first One,beyond being and all essence. According to the account of Simplicius (Inphys.230.34–231.26), this is followed by a second One, who is truebeing, intelligible (nohtovn) and is the forms (ei[dh), called the Monad orunitary Logos containing the ratios (lovgoi) of beings and the paradigmsof bodies.It seems that this opinion concerning Matter was held first among Greeksby the Pythagoreans, and after them by Plato, as indeed Moderatusrelates. For, following the Pythagoreans, [Plato] declares that the first Oneis above being and all essence, while the second One, the truly existentand object of intellection, he says is the Forms. The third, which is thepsychic, participates in the One and the Forms, while the final nature, i.e.the sensible, does not even participate, but is ordered by reflection fromthose [Forms? the first and second Ones?], since Matter in the perceptiblerealm is a shadow of Non-being as it appears primally in quantity, andwhich is inferior in degree even to that. And in the second book of OnMatterPorphyry, citing from Moderatus, has also written that the UnitaryLogos, as Plato somewhere says, intending to produce from itself the ori-gin of beings, by deprivation yielded room for [conj. Zeller, Festugière:“separated from itself”] Quantity, having deprived it of all its (the Logos’)proportions and Forms. He called this Quantity shapeless, undifferenti-ated and formless, but receptive of shape, form, differentiation, qualityetc. It is this Quantity, he says, to which Plato apparently applies variouspredicates, speaking of the “all receiver” and calling it “formless,” even“invisible” and “least capable of participating in the intelligible” and“barely graspable by spurious reasoning” and everything similar to suchpredicates. This Quantity, he says, and this Form [sic] conceived as a pri-vation of the Unitary Logos which contains in itself all proportions ofbeings, are paradigms [sic] of corporeal Matter which itself, he says, wascalled quantity by Pythagoreans and Plato, not in the sense of quantity asa Form, but in the sense of privation, paralysis, extension and disarray,and because of its deviation from that which is—which is why Matterseems to be evil, as it flees from the good. And (this Matter) is caught byit (the Logos) and not permitted to overstep its boundaries, as extensionreceives the proportion of ideal magnitude and is bounded by it, and asdisarray is rendered eidetic by numerical distinction. So, according to thisexposition, Matter is nothing else but a turning away of perceptiblespecies from intelligible ones, as the former turn away from there and areborne downwards towards non-being.Ontogenesis begins, not with the First One, but with the solely existingMonad or second One.

Thisincorporeal primal Quantity (posovth\"), called “all-receiver” like Plato’sReceptacle of becoming—clearly Moderatus’s equivalent of Plato’s indefiniteDyad—is the archetype or paradigm of the corporeal quantity (posovn) thathas been deprived of all traces of unity and form to yield the pure multi-plicity and extension underlying corporeal things, which must be boundedand formed by the ideal magnitude and numerical distinction that now char-acterize the first One. It is as if the Monad were the One-Being (e{n o[n, butcalled here “unitary logos”) of the second hypothesis of Plato’s Parmenidesthat has given up its unity (e{n) to yield the first One (who is the “simply e{n”of the first hypothesis) and thus is now only being (o[n) without its e{ncom-ponent, a kind of indefinite being that Moderatus calls Quantity (posovth\").In an alternative—non-Parmenideanand distinctly more Pythagorean—context, Stobaeus (Anth.1.8.1–9.9) says that Moderatus conceived theMonad or second One as the formal principle that limits primal Quantityin the process of being limited (peraivnousi posovth\"), that is, the Monad iswhat remains (monhv) and is stable after the subtraction of each number inturn from Multiplicity (reminiscent of Speusippus’s principle of “Multi-plicity,” plh'qo\"):In brief, number is a collection of monads, or a progression of multiplic-ity beginning from a monad, and a reversion terminating at the monad.Monads delimit Quantity, which is whatever has been deprived and is leftremaining and stable when multiplicity is diminished by the subtractionof each number. For a monad does not have the power to revert beyondquantity; so that truly a monad is appropriately named from its being sta-ble and remaining unchangeably the same, or from its being divided andbeing completely isolated from multiplicity.This seems to be an adaptation of the Old Pythagorean derivation of thenumber One according to which the Unlimited (ajpeiriva) is drawn orbreathed in and limited by Limit, except here the limiting principle drawsin or contracts itself.35Here the function of Limit is called subtraction.

Thisquantity, however is a not-preexisting stuff, but seems to be emanated(given room) from the Monad by a self-deprivation (or subtraction from orcontraction into itself) of all the proportions and forms (i.e., the multiplicityof subsequent ideal numbers, dyad, triad, etc.) of which it is the source.Thereupon, the numerical distinction of this quantity—perhaps by the firstOne—serves as the origin of “beings,” probably the perceptible bodies ofthe sensible realm.38Thus ideal magnitude seems to have two moments, asystolic and a diastolic, the one contracting ideal multiplicity to its limit inthe Monad to produce unformed quantity, and the other a generation ofideal numbers that increasingly delineate indefinite quantity into the defi-nite mathematical objects (ratios, proportions) that will form the content ofthe cosmic soul.The third One is psychical and participates in the One and the Ideas;it is the equivalent of the World Soul, which would presumably containactual numbers and geometricals. Last comes Matter, conceived as thelower shadow cast by the primal Nonbeing, which seems to be a principleopposed to the unitary Logos, the second One, first manifested as Quan-tity by a privation of the eidetic power of second One.The emergence of Barbelo from the Invisible Spirit as a projection orshadow of the One presented in Zostrianos(NHC VIII 78,7–83,1 cited above,pp. 189–90) and the Three Steles of Seth(VII 122,1–34 cited above, pp.190–91) closely parallels Moderatus’s account of the emergence of Quantity220John D.

HereI would claim Moderatus as an explicit source for these Sethian treatises.However, unlike the Neopythagoreans, the Sethian treatises, the Par-menides Commentary,and eventually also Plotinus utilize the term “Life”to represent this indefinite otherness or boundlessness or pure quantitythat proceeds from the One. What is the proximate cause of the technicaluse of this term for expressing the derivation of pluriform being from orig-inal unity? Among sources traditionally associated with Middle Platonism(e.g., Plutarch Gen. Socr.591b; the Corp. herm.1.9 and 12; 13.9), onethinks especially of the Chaldean Oracles.The Oraclesfeature a feminine principle of life named Hecate, said tobe a sort of diaphragm or membrane, the “center between the twoFathers” (frg. 50 Majercik), which separates the “first and second fires”(frg. 6), i.e., the Father and the immediately subjacent paternal Intellect.39Hecate has a dual position: On the one hand, she is the source of varie-gated matter, generated by the Father as the womb that receives his light-ening (the ideas), “the girdling bloom of fire and the powerful breathbeyond the fiery poles” (frg. 35). On the other hand, she is the life-producing fount (frgs. 30 and 32; cf. frgs. 96, 136 [zwvsh/ dunavmei]) fromwhose right side flows the World Soul (frg. 51), while her left side retainsthe source of virtue. Upon her back, the emblem of the moon (her tradi-tional symbol) represents boundless Nature, and her serpentine hair rep-resents the Father’s winding noetic fire (frgs. 50–55). In her alternatedesignation as Rhea, she is said to be the source of the intellectuals(novera), whose generation she has received in her ineffable womb andupon whom she pours forth the vivifying fire (frgs. 32, 56); as zw/ogovno\"qeav, she is the source of life, a veritable mother of the all. Hecate is alsoconceived as the Womb within which all things are sown and contained,much like Plato’s Receptacle,40and therefore seems to play a role similarto that of Plotinus’s intelligible matter or trace of unbounded Life emittedfrom One to become bounded Intellect, not to mention the SethianMother Barbelo, the “Womb of the All” (Ap. JohnII 5,5; Trim. Prot.XIII38,15; 45,6) who pours forth “Living Water.”The Setting of the Platonizing Treatises22139As the “center between the two Fathers,” she is perhaps the triadic expressionof the supreme Father’s power. The terms “measuring” and “measured” (frgs. 1 and23; in frg. 31 the nohtavare measured by the bond of a first triad “which is not thefirst”) recall the principle of the Unlimited or of the More and Less of Plato’s Phile-bus,which submits to Unity or Measure so as to produce the Forms.40Frgs. 28, 30 (Majercik); cf. the “cosmic hollows” of frg. 34 (and 35), and thepollw'n plhrwvmata kovlpwnof frg. 96."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"In addition to this quasi-philosophical source featuring a supreme prin-ciple of life or vivification, one must consider as proximate sources also theentire spectrum of Sethian gnostic treatises that feature the figure of Barbelo,where she functions not merely as the intellectual aeon, but, somewhat as theChaldaean Hecate, even more as a merciful mother or womb41who grantsher children enlightenment by means of baptism in the “living water” ofenlightenment. The following excerpts demonstrate that Sethian authors con-ceived of the divine Life as pervading the various levels of the transcendentrealm and is made available to the human world as a saving gift. While thesetexts portray a sort of intelligible biology, that “biology” is not always “pre-figurative” in the sense that Corrigan claims to be the case for the Middle andNeoplatonists. In the Apocryphon of John(II 4,3–4; 4,19–21; 5,26; 7,6–15;20,16–18; 23,20–25; 25,23–25), the natural availability of life is restricted to thedivine realm, but since the natural realm is thought to be pervaded by deathrather than life, true life can only be had as a gift from the divine Mother tothe righteous seed of Seth and to those who affiliate with them. On the otherhand, in the Trimorphic Protennoia(XIII 35,12–22; 38,30–33; 41,20–23, 46,13–20; 48,7–11), Protennoia/Barbelo, in the form of the divine Epinoia, becomesa prefigurative source of (the Water of) life at every level of the cosmos fromthe upper light down to material souls. Of course, true life and enlightenmentremain dependent upon the receipt of the water of life in the ritual act of bap-tism, which alone effects the separation of the divine spirit resident in every-one from the corporeal and psychic preoccupations of fleshly existence. Inthe Three Steles of Seth(VII 123,19–21; 125,6 and 25–32), Barbelo is the sourceof both life and intellect, a life whose ultimate source is the supreme One,called a “living Spirit,” source of Existence, Life, and Intellect. Zostrianosembodies this same basic conception; as in the Trimorphic Protennoia,thereceipt of life is again especially connected with baptism of a clearly tran-scendental quality that enables the receipt of true being through self-knowl-edge, a life that is intelligibly prefigured in the triad Being-Mind-Life:VIII 154It is the water of Life that 5belongs to Vitality in which you now6have been baptized in the Autogenes. 7It is the [water] of Blessedness8that [belongs] to Knowledge in which you 9will be [baptized] in the Pro-tophanes. 10It is the water of Existence 11[which] belongs to Divinity,that is, 12to Kalyptos. 13And the water of Life 14[exists with respect to]Power, that of 15[Blessedness] with respect to Essence, 16and that of[Divinity] with respect to 17[Existence].VIII 176Therefore the first perfect water of 7the Triple-Powered One,<that of> Autogenes, 8[is] Life for the perfect souls, 9for it is a rational222John D.

One must ask, could it be that the gnostics themselves were the cata-lyst that precipitated the Middle and Neoplatonic focus upon life and vital-ity as a designation for the median phase in the movement from an originalstatic unity to the manifestation of a demiurgic intellect or world soul thatadministers the physical world of becoming? Could certain gnostic specu-lations on Life have urged Plotinus and his immediate predecessors to con-centrate on developing a prefigurative intelligible biology out of thethought of Aristotle and Plato? Certainly these gnostics, in their quest forsaving enlightenment, stressed the central role of an eternal life madeavailable by a divine mother in the context of a baptismal ritual. In the caseof the Sethians, the doctrine of the divine Mother Barbelo was inspired bythe biblical figure of the divine Wisdom, who was believed to be notmerely the artificer of the physical cosmos (e.g., Prov 8) but also the sourceof living water, the true bread, source of life and light, who sought a per-manent resting place among receptive humans.42Surely this figure, com-bining aspects of both life and intelligence, presented a much more vitalimage for the unfolding of the multiple world of becoming from its originin a supreme One than did the more Neopythagorean and Old Academicnotion of a dyadic principle of indefiniteness. In the gnostic estimation, aThe Setting of the Platonizing Treatises22342In the Jewish wisdom tradition, the exalted Sophia is the fountain or spring(cf. Sir 15:3; 24:30; Philo Fug.195) from which flows the Word like a river (PhiloSomn.2.242; cf. Fug.97). She is also equated with the living water of which Godis the source (cf. Prov 16:22; 14:27; Cant 4:15; and Bar 3:12 with Jer 2:13; 17:13[LXX], John 4:10; 7:38; and Odes Sol.11:5–9; 30:1–6). She is the Mother of the Wordthrough whom the universe came to be (Philo Fug.109), indeed mother of all crea-tures (Philo Det.115–16). To be baptized in her water is to receive true Gnosis. HerVoice is the revelation of the truth. The same sort of myth of descent applied toBarbelo or the First Thought in the Sethian treatises figures also in the story ofSophia in 1 En.42 and other sources such as the Johannine prologue, where Wis-dom (or the Logos) descends to find a place to dwell among humans, but meetingwith initial failure, reascends or tries again."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"feminine principle of Life could be found at most every level of reality,from the divine First Thought, through the errant Sophia, down to the pri-mordial appearance of the spiritual Eve as the “mother of the living.” As amediating term, Life could be considered as both substance and process,as both a potentiality and an actuality, mysteriously present in yet alsoprior to soul as the source of all animation, the hidden potentiality of everyseed to achieve full actuality as a living being, a feminine principle ofpotential indefiniteness containing the power to generate real beings.224John D.

FinamoreUniversity of IowaThe purpose of this paper is to continue the investigation of this sem-inar into the question of a hypothesized interchange of ideas betweengnostics and Neoplatonic philosophers. In particular, I will consider themetaphysical system of the Sethian gnostic text, Marsanes(NHC X,1), andcompare its system to that of the Neoplatonic philosopher, Iamblichus (ca.250–325 C.E.) in order to see whether Marsanesshows the influence ofIamblichean ideas. First, however, in order to understand the Sethian back-ground of Marsanes,I will examine three other Sethian treatises (Allogenes,Zostrianos,and the Three Steles of Seth) in order to uncover their underly-ing metaphysical systems and to see how Marsanesis similar to and/or dif-ferent from them.Let me begin with the dating of Marsanes.The general trend amonggnostic specialists has been to date Marsaneslate. Although Pearson firstbelieved that Marsanes should be included among the gnostic treatisesknown to Plotinus (Vit. Plot.16), he later changed his mind and nowaccepts a later date at the end of the third century C.E.1Turner says that itbelongs “to the last quarter of the third century since it indeed posits anUnknown Silent One above even the Invisible Spirit, in much the sameway as Iamblichus during the same period posited an ‘Ineffable’ beyond1For the earlier date, see B. A. Pearson, “The Tractate Marsanes (NHCX) andthe Platonic Tradition” in Gnosis: Festschrift für Hans Jonas(ed. B. Aland; Göt-tingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1978), 375; his introduction to the MarsanesinNag Hammadi Codices IX and X(ed. B. A. Pearson; Leiden: Brill, 1981), 250; andGnosticism, Judaism, and Egyptian Christianity(Minneapolis: Fortress, 1990),152–53. I will refer to these three texts throughout by the author’s name and“Tractate,” “Marsanes,” and “Gnosticism,” respectively. More recently, in The NagHammadi Library in English(ed. J. M. Robinson; 3d ed.; San Francisco: Harper-Collins, 1988), 461, he has said that “Marsanesrepresents a kind of Platonismwhich coheres well with . . . Iamblichus.” In his response to my paper, Pearsonindicated that he could now accept a date as late as the last quarter of the thirdcentury, agreeing with Turner (see next note). He denies that Marsanesis specif-ically Iamblichean, however."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"even the One of Plotinus.”2Majercik also sees Marsanesas “a reflection per-haps of Iamblichus’s metaphysics, who postulated a similar doctrine of twotranscendent ‘Ones’ uncoordinated with any lower principles.”3The consensus of modern scholars is therefore that Marsanesis rela-tively late and may be Iamblichean in metaphysics because it posits a sep-arate “Silent One” higher than the first principle of the other Sethian texts.Pearson has noted other tenets of Marsanesthat are compatible withIamblichus’s philosophy: a distinction between the intelligible and sensiblerealms, the positing of a realm beyond being, a predilection for triadic struc-ture, and a belief that the soul is spherical and that embodiment is detri-mental to the soul.4All of these, however, are also compatible with otherNeoplatonic and Middle Platonic systems. The concept of a higher, com-pletely ineffable One would certainly be good evidence for Iamblicheaninfluence, since no other Neoplatonic philosopher that we know of exceptDamascius accepted this concept. Before we investigate that line of thought,however, we should investigate the metaphysical systems of earlier Sethiantexts to see if and how Marsanesadapts and alters them, perhaps to bringits own system more into line with that of Iamblichus.5226John F. Finamore2J. D. Turner, “Sethian Gnosticism: A Literary History,” in Nag Hammadi, Gnos-ticism, and Early Christianity(ed. C. W. Hedrick and R. Hodgson; Peabody, Mass:Hendrickson, 1986), 84.

I will refer to this work by Majercik’s name and “Triad”throughout.4Pearson, Marsanes,244–47.5Although there is some question about the exact dates, it is agreed that Zos-trianos, Three Steles of Seth,and Allogenespredate Marsanes.J. D. Turner, “His-tory,” 82, dates Allogenesto “around 200 C.E.,” Zostrianosto “around 225 C.E.,” andthe Three Steles of Sethto the same time period; however, in “The Setting of the Pla-tonizing Sethian Texts in Middle Platonism: The Theses of Kevin Corrigan,” a paperwritten for the 1995 SBL seminar, Turner places Zostrianosbefore Allogenes(p. 19)and says that the date of the Three Stelesis “indeterminate” (p. 17). A. C. Wire inher introduction to the Allogenesin Nag Hammadi Codices XI, XII, and XIII(ed. C.W.

E. Goehring in his introduction to the Three Steles of Sethin NagHammadi Codex VII(ed. B. A. Pearson; Leiden: Brill, 1996), 384, dates this treatiseto “the first half of the third century.” J. H. Sieber, in his introduction to Zostrianosin Nag Hammadi Codex VIII(ed. J. H. Sieber; Leiden: Brill, 1991), 23–25, arguesthat Zostrianosreflects a Middle Platonic worldview and therefore “must have beenwritten either in the last half of the second century C.E. or quite early in the third"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"1. The System of IamblichusIamblichus revamped the old four-level Plotinian system.6He addeda fifth ontological level,7the Intellectual realm between the Intelligibleand Psychic realms, and expanded each of the realms. His methodologyinvolved use of a means of triadization such that the highest member ofeach realm is the unparticipated essence of that realm (ajmevqekto\"), thenext lower member is that essence capable of being participated by alower entity (metecovmeno\"). The lowest member is the essence existingin lower entities (kata; mevqexin). This will be seen most clearly when wereach the realm of the Intellect. Also, further to separate (yet connect)the different realms, the lowest member of one realm was also consid-ered the highest member of the next realm, but the entity quamemberof the higher realm was somehow also differentiated from it quamem-ber of the lower.Our evidence for Iamblichus’s conception of the realm of the Onecomes from Damascius.8He posited a “completely ineffable” One (pan-telw'\" a[rrhton), followed by “the simply One” (oJ aJplw'\" e{n), followed bythe Indefinite Dyad of the Limit and the Unlimited (pevra\",to; a[peiron), andIamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes227century” (25). R. Majercik, “Triad,” 488, thinks that the earliest date for Allogenes, Zos-trianos,and the Three Steles of Sethis 268 C.E. It would help us to date these Sethiantexts if we could finally establish their relationship to the gnostic texts known to Plot-inus (mentioned by Porphyry in Vit. Plot.16). If the “revelations by Zoroaster, Zos-trianos, Nikotheos, Allogenes, Messos” and others are those included in the NagHammadi Sethian texts, then they would have had to have been written before 266C.E. If however the Nag Hammadi texts are revisions of the earlier works, a later datemust be assigned. I myself agree with Majercik that Allogenes, Zostrianos,and theThree Steles of Sethpostdate Plotinus’s writings. I make no claims about the priorityof any one of these to one another, although Turner’s conclusion (reiterated in hisresponse to my paper) that Zostrianospredates both of the others is plausible.6I have laid out the metaphysical systems of Iamblichus and the Sethian texts ina chart attached to the end of this paper (pp. 256–57). I am indebted throughoutthis section to J. M. Dillon, ed. and trans., Iamblichi Chalcidensis in Platonis Dial-ogos Commentariorum Fragmenta(Leiden: Brill, 1973), 26–53.7Proclus (In Tim.1.308.18ff.) alludes to a work, “Concerning the Speech of Zeusin the Timaeus,” in which Iamblichus adds an “Intelligible and Intellectual” realmbetween the Intelligible realm and the Intellectual realm. This is a later develop-ment, dependent on Iamblichus’s study of the Chaldean Oracles.See Dillon,Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 417–19.8Princ.chs. 43, 50, and 51 (2.1.1–13; 2.25.1–17; and 2.28.1–6 in the edition ofWesterink and Combès).

We have then a triad of Ones alongwith a principle of multiplicity.The Intelligible realm was presided over by “the One Existent” seen asthe first member of the triad Being-Life-Mind (o[n-zwhv-nou'\"). This isIamblichus’s interpretation of Soph.248e, whereby Being is unparticipatedExistence, Life is participated Existence, and Intellect is the result of par-ticipation in Existence. (There cannot be Mind without Being and Life.)The Demiurge exists at the level of Intellect, as do the Forms themselves.(These would be the differentiated Forms. They come into existencethroughout the realm, existing in an undifferentiated manner as “Monadsof the Forms” in Being.)9The Intellectual realm also consists of three moments: the unpartici-pated Intellect, the participated Intellect, and the Intellect-in-participation.This last member is also the highest member of the next realm, viz. theHypercosmic Soul (Unparticipated Soul) in the Psychic realm. This soul inturn divides into the World Soul (Participated Soul) and individual souls(Souls-in-participation). Beneath these is the realm of Nature. Notice thatIamblichus stresses the individual soul’s inferiority to Intellect by itsremoval to a lower hypostasis.2. The System of AllogenesAllogenespresents a description of the ascent from this world to thehighest level of the Invisible Spirit. It is given by Allogenes, a savior figure,who has been given divine instruction by Youel, the luminaries of Barbelo,and finally by the Invisible Spirit itself. Turner has studied Allogenescare-fully over the years, and I will be following him closely in what follows.10 The following is an overview of the work’s metaphysical schema.Through Allogenes’ ascent, the reader is introduced to a fourfold Platonicuniverse of One-Intellect-Soul-Nature.11The highest being is the Invisible228John F.

King’s edition and translation, Revelation ofthe Unknowable God with Text, Translation, and Notes to NHC XI,3 Allogenes(SantaRosa, Calif.: Polebridge, 1995). Translations of Allogenesare by Turner.11Turner hesitates over whether to call the system three- or four-tiered.

He exists beyond both eternity and time (63,21–23 and 65,22–23). His placement, therefore, is that of the Neoplatonic One. Beneath himis the second hypostasis Barbelo. Allogenessays little about the next tworealms of Soul and Nature.12Between the levels of the Invisible One andBarbelo is an intermediary level of the Triple-Powered One.13It is thislevel with which we will be most concerned.Allogenes begins his ascent through the Barbelo aeon by means of therevelations of Youel. Barbelo is called an entity separate from the Triple-Powered One, an “incorporeal [eternal] knowledge [gnw'si\"],” and an aeoncontaining “the types [tuvpo\"] and forms [ei\\do\"] of those who truly [o[ntw\"]exist” (51,7–16). Barbelo is an Intellect-figure. Her separate existence fromthe Triple-Powered One places her in a lower realm, and the reference toher as gnw'si\"shows that she is intellectual. The “types and forms” she con-tains are clearly the Forms of Platonism.14All of this is Platonic and inkeeping with what we saw in the Iamblichean universe.Barbelo is subdivided into four parts (45,13–46,16; 51,16–37; and58,12–22), not into a triad.15Allogenes himself, after a hundred years ofIamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes22912See Turner “Threefold Path,” 334; “Ritual,” 172–73.

I cannot agree with Turner that the system of Allogenesdisplays a triadicstructure throughout. The preponderance of the evidence is that the Barbelo sys-tem is tetradic. The movement toward triadization, a movement that we will seeevidenced in Zostrianos,can probably best be seen as caused by the influence ofPlatonism. Cf. Turner, Allogenes,246–47. Pearson in his response to my paper citesthe evidence of King, Revelation,83–84, that the term “Triple Male” in the Allogenesrefers not to a part or aeon of Barbelo but rather to the whole Barbelo aeon.Although it is certainly true that the term “Triple Male” is used in other Sethian textsto refer to the whole Barbelo aeon, the matter is different both here in Allogenesand in Zostrianos.See especially, Zost.24,1–10, where the ascending initiate cansee each of the four members of the Barbelo aeon (Autogenes, Triple Male, Proto-phanes, and Kalyptos) with a different organ of perception (soul, mind, pneu'ma,and the powers of the pneu'maarising from the revelation from the Invisible Spirit,respectively). The Invisible Spirit is known by a fifth, more pure means, viz.,thought or e[nnoia. This kind of hierarchy, which includes the Triple Male as a part,seems to me to be precisely what we find in the Allogenes.Turner in his reply to my paper takes another tack. He states (correctly) that Allo-genesassociates three phases of soul/Forms with the triad Kalyptos-Protophanes-"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"preparation, sees the entire Barbelo aeon, from bottom to top, in thisorder: Autogenes, Triple Male, Protophanes-Harmedon, and Kalyptos(58,12–19).Barbelo first unfolds (downward) into Kalyptos, who contains “thosewhom she [i.e., Barbelo] knows” (45,32–33). Turner identifies these entitieswith “the ‘hidden ones, whom to see is to see the Aeon of Barbelo(46,32–34).”16The “hidden ones” in Kalyptos are further unfolded throughthe aeons that follow and eventually, it seems, become individuatedsouls.17Kalyptos contains the Forms and Protophanes (the next lowestlevel) paradigmatically, i.e., what exists in further differentiation below(“iconically,” kata; eijkovna) exists as a unity and paradigm in Kalyptos(51,12–21).18Although Kalyptos seems unitary and unmoving from a lowerperspective, from above he appears as the activity of Barbelo: Barbelo“became Kalyptos [who] acted [ejnergei'n] in those whom she knows”(45,31–33). The relationship between Kalyptos and Barbelo, then, mirrorsthat between Barbelo and the Triple-Powered One.230John F. FinamoreAutogenes: “authentic existents” (paradigmatic souls/Forms) are in Kalyptos, “thosewho are unified” (undifferentiated souls/Forms) in Protophanes, and “individuals”(differentiated souls/Forms) in Autogenes. The Triple Male, Turner says, does notcontain any such “specific ontological content” and hence is not a separate levelwithin Barbelo but is rather “a sort of transitional or transformational figure whomediates between the aeons of Protophanes and Autogenes.” This is ingenious butstill does not (I believe) commit the author of Allogenesto a triad. A mediatorwithin a triad is unusual, to say the least. Triads are mediators. Each phase (asTurner and I agree) represents an unfolding of Barbelo. The Triple Male plays arole. It is not a large role. It is not even a role with a named subclass ofsouls/Forms. But it is a role. It will help, I think, to imagine a soul becoming moresoul-like in its descent. In Kalyptos, it is more monad than soul; in Protophanes,more a plurality in undifferentiated unity; in Triple Male, less undifferentiated, lessunified, but not yet individual; in Protophanes more individuated yet (but still notcompletely differentiated as souls—souls preexisting in Intellect); and finally intheir own realm souls become fully individual. This is a five-step process, but fourof the levels are in Barbelo. I would be willing to say that there is a kind of ten-sion in Allogenes(as there is in Zostrianos) and that each text is striving toward atriad in its own way. Nonetheless, neither text completely succeeds.16Turner, Allogenes,247.17On the distinction between “perfect individuals,” i.e., individuated souls andForms found in the lowest level of Barbelo (Autogenes) and “those who aretogether,” i.e., these souls and Forms that exist at a higher plane in Protophanes,see Turner, Allogenes,243–44. The “hidden ones” should be seen as their proto-type in Kalyptos.18See Proclus Elem. Theol.65 and In Tim.1.8.13–29, cited by Turner, Allo-genes,254."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The next lower level is that of Protophanes-Harmedon, the “perfectIntellect” (tevleio\" nou'\", 58,17–18).19As Turner explains,20Protophanes “isthe domain of those who are together,” i.e., of Forms and souls before theyare differentiated (46,26–30). At 51,12–24, Protophanes seems to be themiddle point between the Forms and souls that exist paradigmatically inKalyptos and the Forms and souls that exist individually below Proto-phanes. He is the active principle (ejnergei'n, 51,21) of Kalyptos working onthe individuals existing beneath the Protophanic level.The third level is that of the Triple Male.21This entity is closely relatedto the “individuals” (45,36–37), that is, individual Forms and souls thatactually reside in the Autogenes aeon. He is also placed beneath “thosewho exist together,” that is the undifferentiated Forms and souls that residein Protophanes: “[He is] the [Thought (e[nnoia)] of all those who [exist]together” (46,20–22).22Further, just as to see any of the “hidden ones” inKalyptos is to see Barbelo (46,32–34), so too to see the Triple Male is tosee Protophanes (46,22–25). Thus, he occupies the ontological level justbelow Protophanes and acts to bring the undifferentiated beings there intodifferentiated existence in the level of Autogenes. And, conversely, hehelps the differentiated souls in Autogenes to ascend to the higher realms.Thus, at 58,13–15 he is called a savior.The lowest of the four aeons is Autogenes. Whereas the Triple Maleacts on the “individuals” from above, Autogenes is directly involved withthem. He “saw them [all] existing individually [-katav] as [he] is” (46,14–16).Iamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes23119See also 45,34–35, tevleo\"...nou'\", and 51,20.20Turner, Allogenes,248–49.21On one occasion (51,32–37)—as Turner, Allogenes,246 points out—the TripleMale is mentioned fourth, after Autogenes: “He [i.e., Autogenes] is endowed withthe divine Triple Male” (32–33). Turner, Allogenes,254, prefers that the unnamed“he” refer to Barbelo, but the whole passage (12–35) clearly runs in order from thehighest aeon, Kalyptos, to the lowest, the Triple Male, with each higher aeon con-taining the next lower: Kalyptos-Protophanes-Autogenes-Triple Male. There is noreasonable way to “explain away” this anomalous passage. It probably representsan alternate, perhaps earlier, Sethian ontology that has not been harmonized withthe rest of Allogenes.The Triple Male is placed between Protophanes and Auto-genes at 45,28–46,11; 46,11–34; and 58,12–22.22Cf. 58,15–17, where Protophanes is the “goodness” of the Triple Male. Proto-phanes is then the originating cause of the Triple Male as well as the source of hisdivine qualities. See also 56,13–14, where it is said that the “self-begotten ones” arein the Triple Male. On the self-begotten ones, see both Turner, Allogenes,247, who,citing Marsanes3,18–21, identifies them with “individual souls in Platonism,” andSteles Seth126,26–30, where the unbegotten ones appear to be the souls in Auto-genes. In Marsanes,it is the self-begotten ones who are the individual souls in theirhighest stage (3,18–25; see my discussion below)."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Yet there is a distinction in kind between Autogenes and the individuals,for they must become like him in order to see the Triple Male (46,16–18).Thus, in the ascent of the individual soul, the soul must arrive at the Auto-genes level before proceeding to the Triple Male. Autogenes, then, mustbe set at a higher plane than the individuals, and this too is in keeping withPlatonism, where the Intellect (nou'\") is the hypostasis before soul. Auto-genes’ role is to act as Intellect that can descend to the realm of soul andnature: “He acts [ejnergei'n] separately [kata; mevro\"] and individually [-katav],continuing to rectify the failures from nature [fuvsi\"]” (51,28–32).23 UnlikeProtophanes and the Triple Male, Autogenes is individuated and able towork directly upon the lower realms.Thus, in Platonic terms, Allogeneshas divided the realm of Intellectinto four parts. Kalyptos is static and undifferentiated, containing “thehidden ones,” Forms and Souls-in-Unity, completely undifferentiated.They are like the monads of the Forms in Iamblichus’s system (In Phil.frg. 4). Protophanes-Harmedon is an image of Kalyptos. He is undiffer-entiated, yet Forms and souls exist in him “all together,” i.e., with a plu-rality not existing in Kalyptos but without complete differentiationfound in Autogenes. He is best seen as a median between pure unityand individuation into parts. The Triple Male acts as mediary betweenthe lack of differentiation in Protophanes and the individualization ofAutogenes. He has no parallel in the Iamblichean system. In Autogeneswe reach the level of individual Forms and souls. In this aspect he is232John F. Finamore23Turner, Allogenes,254, says that “Autogenes may play here the role of the nevoiqeoivin Plato Tim.41–42.” This is incorrect. The Neoplatonists interpreted theyounger gods as the visible gods, i.e., the stars and planets, who are made of intel-lect, soul, and ethereal body (or “vehicle”). They are above the realm of nature butcontrol it. They exist “individually” in the sense that they are differentiated by theirethereal bodies, but they remain above and have no direct contact with the realmof nature. Autogenes, on the other hand, is said to engage with nature to the extentthat he “rectifies” it. King (above, n. 10), 113–14, interprets the Coptic term asimplying that Autogenes is a member of the transcendent sphere who is in contactwith nature and who “rectifies” the “instability” introduced by the lower realm.Thus, Autogenes is an Intellect-in-participation, the active power of Protophanes atwork in the lower realms. He would therefore precede the visible gods (being anIntellect) but act within their sphere and even beneath it, playing a role similar tothat of Attis in Julian’s Hymn to the Mother of the Gods171a. See my Iamblichusand the Theory of the Vehicle of the Soul(Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1985),140–44. For Julian, however, Attis descends no further than the moon (i.e., he stopsjust short of nature). Autogenes acts immediately on the realm of nature. He wouldbe a holdover of the gnostic descending Demiurge figure but without the overtonesof it being evil or ignorant, more like a saving Sophia. Autogenes, as an Intellectfigure that descends into nature, is not possible in a fully Platonic universe."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"like the Intellect in Iamblichus’s system. Unlike Iamblichus’s Intellect,however, Autogenes also interacts directly with nature. The rationalebehind the entire Barbelo system mirrors that of Iamblichus: it providesgreater distance between the highest level (Invisible Spirit, the One)and nature, while at the same time allowing for step-by-step means ofreascent to the higher principles.If the Barbelo aeon represents the Platonic realm of Intellect with someadded connections from it to the realm of nature, the Triple-Powered Oneis a purely Sethian concept. It represents the means by which the InvisibleSpirit (the static, unitary One of the Platonists) may produce the Barbeloaeon without any activity of its own. The procession is the activity of theTriple-Powered One, not of the Invisible Spirit. Thus, the Triple-PoweredOne can best be seen as the activity of the Invisible Spirit. The Triple-Powered One therefore takes the place of the Indefinite Dyad in Platonicsystems. The Triple-Powered One unfolds itself from the Invisible Spirit inPlatonic fashion by a procession from, a contemplation of, and a knowl-edge of the Invisible Spirit (45,22–27).24The Triple-Powered One thenbecomes the aeon of Barbelo (45,28–30).25The Triple-Powered One is a unity in diversity and has three aspects(49,26–37):26He is Vitality and Mentality and That-Which-Is. For [gavr] then [tovte] That-Which-Is constantly possesses its Vitality and Mentality [nohvth\"], and Vital-ity possesses Being [-oujsiva] and Mentality. Mentality [nohvth\"] possessesLife and That-Which-Is. And the three are one, although individually[-katav] they are three.We have then the triad Being-Life-Intellect of Platonism (derived fromSoph.248e), but in the realm between the highest god and the Intellectrather than in the realm of Intellect itself.Iamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes23324See 49,5–14, where the Triple-Powered One is called the “traverser of theboundlessness of the Invisible Spirit.” On the Platonism of this, see Turner, Allo-genes,251–52.25See 47,7–36, where the Triple-Powered One contains the whole Barbelo aeonin itself (11–14), permeates it (16–18), and is its source (26–27).26On the triad and the passage, see Turner, “Threefold Path,” 334–36; “Ritual,”173; and Allogenes,252–53; King, Revelation,20–29. It is odd that the passage givesthe triad first in the (ascending) order Vitality-Mentality-Being, instead of theIamblichean Mentality-Vitality-Being. The following lines, however, give theIamblichean descending order. There is some hesitancy in the ordering of the triadin Sethian texts. When we turn to Zostrianos,we will see the two orderings again,and so we shall discuss them there."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The relationship between the Triple-Powered One and Barbelo is fur-ther described when Allogenes, after his hundred-year preparation,ascends to its Mentality phase (58,7–59,3). Allogenes sees Autogenes, theTriple Male, Protophanes-Harmedonand the blessedness [-makavrio\"] of the Kalyptos; and the primary origin[ajrchv] of the blessedness [-makavrio\"], the Aeon of Barbelo, full of divin-ity; and the primary origin [ajrchv] of the one without origin [-ajrchv], thespiritual [pneu'ma], invisible [ajovraton] Triple-Powered One, the UniversalOne that is higher than perfect [tevleio\"]. (58,18–26)It is possible that the term “blessedness” is used as a synonym for “Men-tality” in Sethian texts.27If it is used so here, the “blessedness of Kalyptos”is the Mentality phase of the Triple-Powered One immanent in the aeon ofBarbelo, which is itself the origin of the blessedness. That is to say, Bar-belo is herself the fully actualized Mentality phase of the Triple-PoweredOne; the Mentality then emanates from her directly to Kalyptos. As such,Mentality or Intellect pervades the entire Barbelo aeon, as we have alreadyseen. This gradual unfolding of one realm into another is a feature of theanonymous commentary on the Parmenidesand especially of Iamblichusand the later Neoplatonists. It is the Mentality phase of the Triple-PoweredOne that Allogenessees (58,23–26).28Later (58,34–59,3), Allogenes is takeninto the Mentality level and has the knowledge of Barbelo.29Ascent through the Triple-Powered One is first described by the lumi-naries of Barbelo (59,9–60,12) and then narrated by Allogenes himself(60,13–61,22). Allogenes has already attained the level of Blessedness(59,10 and 60,16–18). He moves through Vitality (59,14–18 and 60,19–24)to Existence (59,18–26 and 60,28–37). At this point, Allogenes has attainedthe highest level within the Triple-Powered One. He has moved fromknowledge and activity to pure inactivity, and he becomes like the Triple-Powered One in his lack of mental activity. In this, Allogenes is a likenessof the Triple-Powered One (59,22) and has the inactivity of the Invisible234John F. Finamore27See Turner, Allogenes,259 and 263. For problems in the Three Steles of Seth,see n. 54 below.28As Turner, Allogenes,259 says, the “one without origin” is Barbelo.29Turner, Allogenes,259 and 261, in the phrase “the knowledge [gnw'si\"] [of] theUniversals, the Aeon of Barbelo” (59,2–4) interprets the Universals as Platonicforms. This seems correct. However in “Ritual,” 175, he says that the knowledge ofthe Universals is that “of the Triple-Powered One and the Invisible Spirit.” Thisseems unlikely not only because the word “Barbelo” appears in lines 3–4 but alsobecause Allogenes has not yet received the two revelations from the luminaries ofBarbelo about the Triple-Powered One and the Invisible Spirit."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"One in him (60,7–8) Indeed the realm of Existence is itself “like [katav] animage [eijkwvn]” of the inactivity in Allogenes that he received from theTriple-Powered One and the Invisible Spirit (60,30–37).30There is therefore a continuation of the gradual ontological hierarchythat we have been observing throughout the Allogenes.The movementfrom Mentality to the Triple-Powered One as a whole is one of increasingstillness and inactivity. The summit of the entire system, the Invisible Spirititself, is revealed only through a negative theology (61,25–67,38), the intentof which is to show the complete inactivity of the first principle. Any activ-ity on Allogenes’ part will result in detachment from it. The Invisible Spiritis beyond both time (which comes into being in the Psychic realm in Neo-platonism) and eternity (which comes into being in the realm of Intellect)(63,21–23; 65,22–23), is characterized by nonbeing existence (62,23;65,32)31and by silence and stillness (61,21; 62,24–25; 65,19), and is com-pletely unknowable (61,22; 63,9–11; 63,28–32; 64,10–12; 64,14–23; 66,23).Before concluding our examination of the Allogenes,we should con-sider Turner’s claim to have found an “enneadic structure” in it, wherebythe triad of being-life-mind is located at three levels: Invisible Spirit, Triple-Powered One, and Barbelo.32According to this theory, which is based inIamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes23530The text reads: “by a revelation of the Indivisible One and the One who is atrest” (60,35–37). Although Turner, Allogenes,261, thinks that the two terms are “hen-diadys for the Triple-Powered One,” it makes more sense to see the two terms describ-ing two entities, the Invisible Spirit and Triple-Powered One, respectively. (See67,25–32, where the term “Unknowable One” is substituted for “Indivisible One.”) Forthe two mentioned together, see 61,5–6, where “the One who exists in me” is theInvisible Spirit, 61,8–14, and 53,29–31 (where Turner again argues for hendiadys, Allo-genes,256). At 61,14–22, the Mediator of the Triple-Powered One is the Invisible Spirit.But see Turner, Allogenes,261. In his response to Corrigan, p. 37, Turner goes so faras to say that the Mediator might be Allogenes himself. The term is problematic (howcan the highest principle be a mean?) but probably means no more than that thepower in the Invisible Spirit is channeled through the activity of the Triple-PoweredOne to Barbelo. The Invisible Spirit is a Mediator quaits potentiality, which is medi-ated. [The text “mediator of the Triple Powered One” must be emended to read:“mediator (i.e., the Triple Powered One) of the Unknowable One.” JDT]31At XI 53,31, the Existence level of the Triple-Powered One is itself called “thenon-substantial [-oujsiva] Existence [u{parxi\"].” Lines 23–31 describe, partly inmetaphorical language, Barbelo, Protophanes (both in terms of Mentality), theInvisible Spirit, the Triple-Powered One, and Existence. It is odd that Vitality is omitted here. It appears in a mutilated passage of Youel’s praise of the Triple-Powered One on the next page (54,8).32See Turner, “Threefold Path,” 336; “Ritual,” 173–74; his reply to Corrigan,14–16.

JDT]"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"part on the schema found in the anonymous commentary on the Par-menides, Allogenespresents the triad in three varying ways at the threemain ontological levels. At the level of the Invisible Spirit the triad is foundrepresented by infinitives (ei\\nai, zh'n, noei'n) and considered as acts; at thelevel of the Triple-Powered One represented by abstract nouns (u{parxi\"orojntovth\"or oujsiovth\", zwovth\", noovth\") and considered as qualities; and atthe level of the Barbelo aeon represented by nouns or, in one case, a sub-stantive (to; o[n, zwhv, nou'\") and considered as substances. We thus have atriad in each level. Next, Turner says, since each level is actually just aphase in the unfolding of the Invisible Spirit into Barbelo, each level can beconsidered as the term of the triad that predominates at that level. In otherwords, at the level of the Invisible Spirit existence predominates, at the levelof the Triple-Powered One life, and at the level of Barbelo intellect. Thusthe Triple-Powered One (in its Life phase) is discontinuous with both theInvisible Spirit (in its Being phase) and Barbelo (in its Intellect phase).Turner provides the following chart in explanation:33Unknowable One/Invisible SpiritExistsLivesKnowsTriple-Powered One/Eternal LifeExistenceVitalityMentalityBarbelo/First ThoughtBeing(Life)MindThis is intriguing, but there are problems here. First, as I have stated above,the Barbelo aeon is tetradic not triadic. Moreover, the terms Being-Life-andMind are not applied to it in quite the way that Turner wishes. For the termMind is applied to Kalyptos (the highest phase) and Protophanes (the mid-dle phase), not to Autogenes (the lowest). Indeed, this is crucial becauseKalyptos as Blessedness (= Mentality) is at once the highest phase of Bar-belo (who is herself Blessedness) and the lowest phase of the Triple-Powered One. It is again the gradual unfolding from top to bottom that isbeing stressed. Finally, as Turner admits, the term “Life” is never appliedto Protophanes. Indeed, there is no evidence of the triad being applied tothe Barbelo tetrad.What about the triad at the level of the Invisible Spirit? At first glance,there does seem to be support in the text. At the beginning of their sec-ond revelation, the luminaries of Barbelo say (61,32–39):Now [dev] he is something insofar as he exists in that he either [h[] existsand will become, or [h[] acts [ejnergei'n] or [h[] knows, although he liveswithout Mind [nou'\"] or [ou[te] Life or [ou[te] Existence [u{parxi\"] or [ou[te]Non-Existence [-u{parxi\"], incomprehensibly.236John F. Finamore33Turner, “Ritual,” 174; and his reply to Corrigan, 16."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Iamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes237As it stands the triad is not applied to the Invisible Spirit but is ratherdenied of him. Turner, however, edits the text to yield the following:34Now he is something (in the most general sense) in that he exists, seeingthat he either exists or <lives> or knows, <acting> without mind or life orexistence or non-existence in an incomprehensible way.Turner argues that the phrase “‘exists and will become’ . . . is awkward”and that “will become” is the “translator’s equivalent to uJpavrcein.” Further,he thinks that the word “acts” must be moved, that “lives” should beinserted, and that “Non-Existence” “seems gratuitous.”35Turner’s reasoningis straightforward. With the proposed changes, we have a better parallelbetween the triad of verbs and triad of nouns. But this may not be whatthe author of Allogenesintended.One attribute of the Invisible Spirit that continually arises is that he iswithout being (62,22; 63,9–10; 63,17–18; 65,28–30; 65,32–33; 66,25–28).Nonetheless, he is something, “another thing” (63,18). Thus, although he isstrictly beyond existence, he nonetheless has a kind of existence. This is themeaning of his having “nonbeing existence.” It is, if you will, a preexistingexistence, for Existence will devolve from him. The Existence is in him par-adigmatically.36This, then, is the meaning in our passage as well. He“exists” (in the technical sense just explained) so he “will become,” i.e., willunfold into Existence at a lower stage, just as he will “act” and “know” atlower levels. (His activity is the Triple-Powered One; his knowledge Bar-belo.) And he does all of this without Mind, Life, or Existence, which willnot properly exist until the level of the Triple-Powered One. This is furtherexplained at 62,18–27, where we are told that he does not need Mind orLife or anything. “He is superior to the Universals” (i.e., the Forms), is “non-being existence” and is not “diminished by those who are not diminished.”Thus, we have the Platonic concept of undiminished giving from a powerthat transcends the qualities that he causes to exist at the lower level. Insum, although the triad is of course preexistent in the Invisible Spirit, itwould be incorrect to see the full triad operating at his level. On the 34Turner, Allogenes,261.

Rather, the Exis-tence of the Invisible Spirit is stressed over the others, but in a way thatmakes clear that he surpasses both it and its opposite “incomprehensibly.”37In the end, then, the system of Allogenesis only partly Platonic. It isPlatonic in its positing of a higher principle “beyond being,” of an ema-nation or “undiminished giving” from it to the lower realms, of the sepa-ration of Intellect into its own hypostasis, and of the emanation of souland nature from there. It is unplatonic in its conception of the Triple-Powered One as a separate hypostasis, its placement of the Being-Life-Intellect triad in that hypostasis instead of in Intellect, and its division ofIntellect into a tetrad.3. The System of ZostrianosZostrianospresents the most complete worldview of all four Sethiantexts, since it actually discusses how the upper realms unfold themselvesinto the material world. In Zostrianos,we are presented with a savior fig-ure (Zostrianos) who with the aid of four divinities (Authrounios, Eph-esech, Youel, and Salamex) ascends from the lowest strata of matter to thehighest sphere of the Invisible Spirit and then descends again to bring themessage of salvation to the seed of Seth. The system follows the fourfold Platonic system: the realms of theOne, of the Intellect, of the Soul, and of Nature. Let us concentrate first onthe two highest realms. The highest god is the Invisible Spirit. Immediatelybelow this god is the aeon of Barbelo, which is subdivided further intothree aeons: Kalyptos, Protophanes, and Autogenes.38As in Allogenes, the238John F. Finamore37What is most intriguing about the system of Allogenesis its proximity toIamblichus’s concerning the devolving of strata. This is true not only in the multi-plication of levels within hypostases but also in the way the gradual unfolding takesplace. Existence is the highest level of the Triple-Powered One, yet it preexists inanother form in the next highest entity, the Invisible Spirit. Mentality comes intofull existence in Barbelo, yet preexists in the lowest level of the Triple-PoweredOne. This raises the question of which writings are prior and may help confirmMajercik’s thesis for a late dating of Allogenes.38The three are mentioned together at VIII 20,4–15; 58,12–16; and 129,2–26,with no mention of the Triple Male. At times this fourth aeon is added betweenProtophanes and Autogenes. See 24,1–10; 44,23–31; and 56,15–19. Sieber, however,in the notes to his translation in Nag Hammadi Codex VIII(ed. J. H. Sieber; NHS31; Leiden: Brill, 1991), 129, identifies the Triple Male with the Protophanes aeonin the last mentioned passage. This is possible, since at 61,15–22 the Triple Maleseems to form part of the Protophanes aeon.

The role of theTriple-Powered, however, is different. For the Invisible Spirit itself is iden-tified with the Triple-Powered One (24,12–13; 63,6–8; 87,13–14; 97,1–3;118,9–13; 128,20-22), but it does not become another separate triadichypostasis. Instead, its triple-power overflows into and immediatelybecomes Barbelo and her triad.This occurs, it would seem, in Platonic fashion. Barbelo emanates ordivides from the Invisible Spirit (77,12–15; 83,19–24; 87,10–14), then turnsto contemplate him and thereby becomes a separate hypostasis (78,6–80,18;81,6–20; 87,14–16). Further, since the Barbelo aeon becomes the triad ofKalyptos, Protophanes, and Autogenes, these three are also potentially inthe Invisible Spirit, waiting to become unfolded from him (75,12–14).39It is in the aeon of Barbelo that the Existence-Life-Mind triad comesinto being, but not however in this order. The triad is first mentioned inEphesech’s revelation to Zostrianos and involves the triad emanating fromBarbelo herself (14,1–14). The triad—existence (u{parxi\"), blessedness(makavrio\", i.e., mind or intellect), and life—is termed a first principle(ajrchv) that comes from a single first principle. The text is problematic here,but the single first principle seems to be Barbelo herself. This triad is inte-grated with the Barbelo Aeon’s three members through the imagery of bap-tismal waters (15,4–17), where “the water of life” and Vitality are associatedwith Autogenes, the lowest of the three Barbelo aeons; the water ofblessedness with Protophanes, the middle aeon; the water of existencewith Kalyptos, the highest aeon. Thus, the triad is organized in non-Iamblichean order. Later (66,7–66,18), the triad—this time in the Iambli-chean order, existence, life, blessedness—derives from “the [truly] existentSpirit, the sole One.”40Since the Invisible Spirit is the highest cause, he isthe cause of Barbelo as well as of the Barbelo aeons. Thus, the Barbeloaeons can be said to emanate from either the Invisible Spirit or Barbelo.This is more clearly expressed at 79,9–25, where Barbelo herself is termedthe “first [insubstantial] existence” after the Invisible Spirit. She emanatesfrom the undivided Spirit to the level of Existence. Unlike the Spirit she isan activity (ejnevrgeia), and at the level of Existence she becomes a Triple-Powered One, i.e., “an image of the one that truly exists.”41Thus, Barbelois the moving image and activity of the Invisible Spirit and as such is called39“All [these] were [in the] indivisibility of [the] Spirit.” Translations from Zostri-anosare from Nag Hammadi Codex VIII(ed.

This “Triple Power” is actualized in the triad ofKalyptos (Existence), Protophanes (Blessedness), and Autogenes (Life).42In this way, then, the Invisible Spirit is “Three Powered” only potentially.The actual triadization occurs through Barbelo.It is worth noticing that there are two occasions in Zostrianoswhenthe triad may be given in Iamblichean order. Once, in the lines immedi-ately following 66,7–66,18, discussed just above, where the triad was givenin the order Existence-Blessedness-Life, the author may reverse himselfand give the triad in Iamblichean order:In Existence he (i.e., the Invisible Spirit) exists [as] a simple unity, his own[rational expression] and species. Whoever will find him he brings intoexistence. [And in] Vitality, he is alive....43The triad also appears along with the Barbelo triad at 20,22–24 in thisorder, but the text is again badly damaged. If these two passages do rep-resent a change in the order of the triad (and their mutilated conditionmakes this only a hypothesis), then we have evidence of a tension withinGnosticism itself as to the order of the triad. If anything, however, the posi-tion of Zostrianoscertainly favors the non-Iamblichean formulation. Thus,in Zostrianos,we do not find the second, non-Platonic triad between thefirst and second principles (the Invisible Spirit and the Barbelo aeons) thatwe found in Allogenes,and there is a tendency toward non-Iamblicheanordering of the triad.Before we leave Zostrianos,we should look also at the psychic realm,for it shares vocabulary with Marsanes. Zostrianos27,9–28,30 divides dis-embodied immortal souls into three classes: “the ones who have taken rootamong the Sojourn” (paroivkhsi\"), “those that stand [upon the] Repentance”(metavnoia), and “the souls of the Self-generated ones” (aujtogeniovn).44Theterm metavnoiaoccurs in Marsanes3,15; paroivkhsi\"may represent the verbfor “dwell” in 3,17.45Both terms are associated with the fifth seal, which(as we shall see) is the appropriate place for disembodied souls. Marsanes’240John F. Finamore42The triad is given in this order also at 3,8–11.43The translation is from Turner’s reply to Corrigan, 29. In brackets, he finishesthe sentence thus: “and enters into blessedness and comes to have Mentality.” Thetext is corrupted, but it is fairly certain that the triad occurs in this form.

We shall returnto this point below.4. The System of the Three Steles of SethThe Three Steles of Sethpresents a liturgy intended to be repeated bya group of Sethians in imitation of or perhaps coincident with an ascentritual through the three main figures of Sethianism. According to the intro-duction (118,10–23), Dositheos saw the three steles and preserved whatwas written upon them. The first stele is to Autogenes, the second to Bar-belo, and the third to the Unbegotten.46Autogenes is presented as belonging to a higher realm but as reveal-ing the entities in the higher realm to the Sethians below (119,15–120,6).Like Autogenes in the Allogenes,he is the intermediary between higherand lower realms, and he is active in the lower realms (121,10–11). He isa savior figure (121,11–12). He, not Protophanes, is identified with theTriple Male (120,29; 121,8–9). The Triple Male, therefore, does not exist ina level separate from him.Barbelo is delineated as the intermediary between the UnbegottenOne above and Autogenes below. She is, on the one hand, “the first gloryof the invisible Father” (121,22–23), a monad from a monad (121,33–34),“the first [shadow] of the holy Father” (122,2–3; 124,3–5), “one . . . of theOne” (122,12–13).47On the other hand, just as Barbelo unfolds as ashadow from the Unbegotten, so the other eternal ones are from her(122,6–12; 123,11–14).Although the usual Sethian triad of Kalyptos-Protophanes-Autogenes isnot explicitly drawn, the names of Kalyptos and Protophanes do appear asextensions of her. She is said to be Kalyptos48(122,14; 123,1) and tobecome the nou'\"Protophanes (123,4–5). Her relationship to Autogenes isclear enough from the fact that the stele dedicated to her is between thosededicated to him and the Unbegotten. Thus, there is sufficient reason tosee the triad of aeons existing in Barbelo.49Iamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes24146[For the view that these are three separate entities, see B. Layton, The Gnos-tic Scriptures(New York: Doubleday, 1987), 152–53.

The text reads (122,18–25):For their sake you have empowered the eternal ones in being; you haveempowered divinity in living; you have empowered knowledge in good-ness; in blessedness you have empowered the shadows which pour forthfrom the one.Goehring (402) says that the “influence of the . . . triad is evident here.While Barbelo is the empowering force behind the attributes, the Father ‘is’the attributes.” The first half of this statement is correct.50It is Barbelo, asthe monad in which each member of the triad preexists, who brings thetriad into existence in the aeons beneath her (presumably Kalyptos, Pro-tophanes, and Autogenes). There are problems, however. Whereas Barbelois said to empower the aeons in beingand in living,this parallelism breaksdown when it is said that she empowers knowledge in goodness.Further,it is in the fourth clause where Barbelo empowers the aeons in blessedness(makavrio\"). Now, as we have seen, blessedness may be used as anotherterm for “Intellect.” The text seems to give a tetrad (being, life, goodness,blessedness). It is difficult to explain why, but the reason may again haveto do with alternate Sethian arrangements of the Barbelo aeon.51The pointto note for now is that the three terms of the usual triad (given in theIamblichean order) are preexistent in Barbelo.52Proof for the triad itself in the Three Stelescan be found in two pas-sages from the third stele, which is dedicated to the Unbegotten. One pas-sage (125,28–32) gives the triad straightforwardly as caused by theUnbegotten:For you are the existence [u{parxi\"] of them all. You are the life of themall. You are the mind [nou'\"] of them all.Here the Unbegotten is the source of being, life, and mind in the entitiesbelow him. The second passage (124,26–33) is more difficult. It calls theUnbegotten “the non-being [-oujsiva], existence [u{parxi\"] which is before242John F. Finamore50As we shall see, it cannot be the case that the Father isBeing, Life, and Mind.He must preexist them.51See below for further discussion.52The passage at 123,18–22, where Barbelo is the source of life and mind forlower entities is helpful but not definitive. At 123,23, however, she is called a triplepower, which is at least suggestive of the triad, although the term may refer ratherto the triad of Kalyptos, Protophanes, and Autogenes, since she is immediatelycalled an “aeon of aeons” (123,25–26)."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Iamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes243existences” (u{parxi\") (124,26–27). As in Allogenes,the first principle isbeyond being yet the cause of being in the entities below.53He is(124,28–33):the first being [oujsiva] which is before beings [oujsiva], Father of divinity andlife, creator of mind [nou'\"], giver of good [ajgaqovn], giver of blessedness[-makavrio\"].Here we have the three members of the triad (being, life, and mind) cou-pled, it seems, with two others (goodness and blessedness).54Leaving theproblem of the extra elements aside, it seems clear enough that if theUnbegotten is the source of Being, Life, and Mind, then the triad wouldcome into existence in the aeon of Barbelo.5. Comparison of the Sethian SystemsThe three Sethian texts provide systems that are similar in certain fea-tures but that are also divergent in crucial ways. Although it is true that allthree systems contain realms roughly equivalent to the Platonic realms ofthe One, Intellect, Soul, or Nature, that all three present a single first causethat is beyond being, and that all three contain some formulation of theBeing-Life-Mind triad, nonetheless the differences are more impressivethan these similarities.First, there is the question of the Triple Power. In Allogenesit is con-ceived as distinct from the Invisible Spirit; in Zostrianosit is combined withit as the “Invisible Three-Powered Spirit”; in Three Steles of Seththe term isused of both the Unbegotten and Barbelo but is not used for an entity orrealm distinct from them.5553The Unbegotten is “the really [o[ntw\"] preexistent one” who “really [o[ntw\"]exists” (124,18–21). Cf. 121,25–27, where Barbelo sees that “the one who truly[o[ntw\"] preexists is non-being [-oujsiva].”54For goodness and blessedness, see 122,18–25, cited above. All five elements arein both passages, although knowledge and goodness are combined at 122,22–23. Also,at 124,31–33, mind and blessedness are separated. Indeed, 122,18–25 seems to exhibita tetradic structure: being, life, goodness, and blessedness; while 124,28–33 exhibits apentadic one: being, life, mind, goodness, and blessedness. (Note that “mind” and“blessedness” are listed separately, suggesting that, at least for the Three Steles,the twoare not equivalent.) The two texts suggest that the triad was at one time submerged ina larger set of elements and that attempts were under way to extricate or highlight thetriad. On the face of it, this set of circumstances suggests that the triad preexists gnos-tic literature and indeed moved the gnostics to form the triad in their own metaphysics.If so, this presents further evidence for Platonism as the likely source of the triad.55See Goehring’s note in Nag Hammadi Codex VII,399."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Second, there is the placement and arrangement of the Being-Life-Mind triad. Allogenesplaces the triad (given in Iamblichean order) in theTriple-Powered One, making it a separate hypostasis between the InvisibleSpirit and Barbelo. Zostrianosassociates each element of the triad with amember of the Barbelo aeon: Existence with Kalyptos, Blessedness (=Intellect) with Protophanes, and Vitality with Autogenes. The triad is there-fore given in non-Iamblichean order. The Three Steles of Sethplaces thethree elements of the triad in the Barbelo aeon but associates these threeelements with others so that it is doubtful that we are dealing with a triad.Third, there is the problem of the Triple Male. The Three Steles of Sethassociates this Sethian divinity with Autogenes.56Zostrianosusually associ-ates him with Protophanes but sometimes makes him a separate level in theaeon of Barbelo. Allogenesconsistently presents the Triple Male as a fourthlevel of the Barbelo aeon, usually between Protophanes and Autogenes.These three differences highlight three areas of flux within SethianGnosticism. Sethian writers are concerned with the inclusion and place-ment of divine entities or powers within a system that has already takenon a Middle Platonic or Plotinian slant. What I mean by this is that themetaphysical system is already four-tiered: One-Intellect-Soul-Nature. Whatthe Sethians seem to be arguing over (or, at least, considering individually)is the placement within the Platonic universe of certain Sethian entities.Now, in this they are doing for Sethianism what Iamblichus is doing forpaganism. For Iamblichus is likewise fitting various religious entities intohis universe. Thus, it seems to me that we have, as it were, a religiousenlarging and repopulating of the Plotinian universe. This is how a reli-gious believer inserts his or her own gods, demigods, divine powers, andthe like into a streamlined universe. If this view is correct, then the Sethi-ans are doing what Iamblichus and presumably other Platonists after Plot-inus are doing. The Iamblichean universe is more developed, of course,which proves that Iamblichus’s writings postdate these three Sethian texts.It is time to see how the Marsanesfits into this scheme.6. The System of MarsanesThe treatise Marsanes,like Allogenesand Zostrianos,presents thereader with the exposition of a savior figure about his ascent and subse-quent descent through the universe. The savior here is Marsanes himself,and his tale is intended for a knowledgeable audience of Sethians.57Thetext of Marsanesis riddled with lacunae; especially after the first ten pages,244John F. Finamore56[See note 46. JDT]57Marsaneshas been studied and translated by B. A. Pearson. See the workscited in note 1, above."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"whole pages are unreadable or even missing. Nonetheless, enoughremains for us to examine its metaphysical structure and to make somedecisions about its place in the history of Gnosticism and Platonism.The treatise begins with Marsanes reassuring the Sethians that the“Father” (one of the supreme gods) is benevolent, protects his followers,and cares for them (1,11–27). After a lacuna, Marsanes describes what herefers to as thirteen “seals.” Each seal refers to a step on the metaphysicalladder.58These are presented from the bottom up, but only after Marsaneshas assured his readers that he has “established” (2,13–14) the highest seal,i.e., that he has made the mystical journey through the various levels to thehighest one and has returned safely himself.The thirteen seals are presented at 2,16–4,23. Pearson has shown thatthey form a hierarchy that is consistent with the four-level metaphysics ofPlatonists.59At the bottom of the hierarchy are the first three seals repre-senting “the worldly [kosmikov\"] and the material [uJlikov\"]” realms (2,16–26). These correlate with the Platonic realm of Nature. It should be notedthat Marsanesadds that “in every respect [pavntw\"] the sense-perceptible[aijsqhtov\"] world [kovsmo\"] is [worthy] of being saved entirely” (5,24–26).This is a palpable move away from the pessimism of the gnostics towardthe optimism of the Platonists.60Iamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes24558On the seals, see Pearson, Marsanes,235 and 249; “Tractate,” 377–78; andGnosticism,153–54 (where discussion of the seventh seal seems to have droppedout). Since Zostrianosmarks each successful attempt to move up the ladder with a“baptism” and since the term “seal” is often associated with baptism in Sethiantexts, it may seem tempting to see some connection between Marsanes’use of theterm “seal” and a baptismal rite. See Turner, “Ritual,” 171–72. As Turner says, how-ever, there is no mention of baptism in Marsanes,and so the author’s use of theterm remains mysterious. Pearson, in his article “Theurgic Tendencies in Gnosticismand Iamblichus’ Conception of Theurgy,” in Neoplatonism and Gnosticism(ed. R. T. Wallis and J. Bregman; Albany: SUNY Press, 1992), 264–65, associates the thir-teen seals with “ritual praxis” and says that “the various ‘seals’ are to be understoodas equivalent to what Iamblichus calls the synthemata.” 59Pearson, Gnosticism,155–56.60See Pearson, Gnosticism, 162–64. He believes that this passage, together with41,30–42,6 about the one who gazes at the planets being “blessed,” shows Platonicinfluence. (Cf. Pearson, Marsanes,247–48.) In Gnosticism,163, Pearson cites as evi-dence for this Platonic optimism Taurus’s view that souls descend “for the com-pletion of the universe,” i.e., the descent is voluntary on the soul’s part and positive(for the good of the universe) and not caused by tovlma. The Taurus quotationcomes from Iamblichus’s De Anima,in a passage in which Iamblichus is discussingthe issue of the soul’s descent. Iamblichus adopts Taurus’s view, arguing (againstPlotinus and others) that the descent is necessary and that pure souls descend will-ingly, impure souls unwillingly for punishment for the conduct of their past lives."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Seals four through six (2,26–3,25) are equivalent to the psychic realmof the Platonists. The text contains many lacunae, but the general mean-ing is clear enough. As the first three seals were characterized by what isperceptible (aijsqhthv, 2,22), these next three are characterized by what isincorporeal (ajswvmaton, 3,19; cf. 3,9). Although it is true, as Pearsonsays,61that Platonists use this term of the intelligible, here its domain islower. For the soul too is incorporeal. This is further verified by the useof the term “partially” (kata; mevro\", 3,21), for souls are parts of the Hyper-cosmic Soul and are often termed “partial natures,” whereas intelligibleobjects are not.The fourth seal is the next highest after nature (fuvsi\", 3,1–2).62It “isincorporeal” (-sw'ma) (3,9). Although the precise entities of the fourth sealare lost in a lacuna, the description of the fifth and sixth seals will allowus to make a good guess as to what they were.The fifth seal concerns “conversion [metavnoia] [of] those that are withinme” and includes “those who dwell in that place” (3,15–17). The humansouls are conceived as existing inside Marsanes. This must mean, as Pear-son thinks,63that these are the souls of the true believers in the Sethianfold. Pearson couples the verb for “dwell” with the Greek term paroikei'n,notes that both terms are given by Plotinus (2.9.6.1–3) as examples ofgnostic terminology associated with the soul, and points out that metavnoia“is apparently to be understood as the first step in the return of the gnos-tic soul to its place of origin.”64The two terms also appear in Zostrianos,as Pearson also says.65Before examining the relevant passages in Zostrianos,let’s turn toMarsanes’sixth seal:concerning the self-begotten ones [aujtogevnnhto\"], concerning the incor-poreal [ajswvmaton] being [oujsiva] which exists partially [kata; mevro\"],together with those who exist in the truth of the All [...]for understand-ing [ejpisthvmh] and assurance.246John F. FinamoreSee Finamore, Iamblichus and the Theory of the Vehicle of the Soul(Chico, Calif.:Scholars Press, 1985), 96–101.61Marsanes,256.62The text is marred. Pearson, Marsanes,255, would read, “He exists after the [ ] and the [divine] nature [fuvsi\"].” The reading “divine” is highly conjectural. Itseems better, therefore, to take the subject “he” as some being in the fourth realmor seal who exists (as the seal itself does) directly above the third: “He exists afterthe [world? (kovsmo\")] and nature.”63Marsanes,256.64Pearson, Marsanes,256 and 247; cf. Gnosticism,153 n. 24.65Nag Hammadi Codices IX and X,ad loc."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The term “self-begotten” recalls Autogenes, who will appear in the nextseal in Marsanes.These are the highest “partial,” i.e., individual souls, andprobably are to be identified with purified human souls as well as divinesouls. Hence, they gain insight into the true conception of the universe andthereby attain knowledge, unsullied as they are by material accretions.Thus, Marsanespresents a triad within the realm of the soul. Zostri-anospresents a similar threefold division of souls, which will allow us tounderstand better the triad in Marsanes. After Zostrianos leaves the realmof nature in his ascent and passes through the sphere of the seven planets(5,17–22), he ascends first to the paroivkhsi\"(5,24), then to metavnoia(5,27), then to a third place (the name is lost in a lacuna) where he seesthe “self-begotten [aujtogenhv\"] root” of truth (6,5); he is thereupon baptizedin Autogenes. Later, after discussing embodied souls (26,19–27,9), Zostri-anos differentiates three kinds of immortal souls (27,9–28,30).66There are“the ones that have taken root upon the exile [paroivkhsi\"]” (27,14–15),“those that stand [upon the] repentance [metavnoia]” (27,21–22), and “thesouls [yuchv] of the self-begotten ones [aujtogeniovn]” (28,11–12). Finally, ina third passage (42,10–44,22), Zostrianosidentifies two sorts of embodiedsouls (called “dead” at 42,13, 16, and 20): those who completely identifythemselves with the body and the material world and those who raisethemselves higher but not to the level of the gods. It then differentiatesthese from three types of immortal souls. The first type are “in exile[paroivkhsi\"].” This kind of soul, when it “discovers the truth” is classedhigher than the other, embodied souls (43,13–18). The second type arethose that repent (metavnoia). When this soul turns itself from the things ofthe body (here called “dead things”) and toward true existence, it attainsits proper place in the universe (43,19–30). The highest type are the souls“that can be saved.” These seek and find their intellect and themselves,know things as they really are, withdraw into themselves, and becomedivine (44,1–22).Both Zostrianosand Marsanespresent a threefold division of souls.Whereas Zostrianospresents souls in exile at a level lower than that ofsouls that repent, Marsanesplaces them at the same level but has “repen-tance” precede (i.e., be lower than) “dwelling” in the fifth seal. First comesthe soul’s change, then it can come to dwell in a higher place.67What thenof the lowest seal? Marsanes assures his readers that the entities of this sealare incorporeal (3,9). These are probably, then, souls either still embodiedor newly disembodied that are still in the process of learning the ways ofIamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes24766For discussion of this and the next passage in Zostrianos,see both Sieber’snotes in Nag Hammadi Codex VIIIand Turner, in his reply to Corrigan, 47–48.67The “place” of Marsanes3,17 is almost certainly the uJperouravnio\" tovpo\"ofPhaedr.247c3.

This represents a step intermediate between Zostrianos’shigher kind of “dead” soul and the soul in exile. The “self-begotten” soulsof the sixth seal are equivalent to those in Zostrianos.68The three parts ofthe Psychic realm in Marsanesshow a soul becoming more pure. It shouldbe noted, however, that the Soul-triad in Marsanesis not equivalent toIamblichus’s triad of Hypercosmic, World, and Individual souls.The remaining seals concern the two highest Platonic realms. Sealsseven through ten take us into the realm of the Intellect and reintroduceus to familiar characters. The seventh seal concerns “the self-begotten [auj-togenhv\"] power [duvnami\"],” i.e., Autogenes (3,25–26); the eighth “the Mind[nou'\"] which is [male, which] appeared [in the beginning],” i.e., Proto-phanes (4,2–7);69the ninth, marred by a lacuna, Kalyptos;70and the tenthBarbelo. The realm of the One, as we know it from Allogenes, Zostrianos,and Three Steles of Seth,is given in seals eleven and twelve (4,13–19):the Invisible One [ajovrato\"] who possesses three powers [duvnami\"] and theSpirit [pneu'ma] which does not have being [oujsiva], belonging to the firstUnbegotten (fem.).Finally, the thirteenth seal concerns the Silent One “who was not [known]”(4,19–22).If we compare these two highest realms to the highest realms of theother three Sethian texts, we can discern certain important differences inMarsanes.Working from the top down, the first obvious difference is theaddition of the Silent One. Second, Marsanesagrees with Allogenesagainst the other two texts in dividing the next highest being into two: aninvisible three-powered One and a Spirit. Third, it does not add a third248John F. Finamore68Souls are discussed later in Marsanes.At 25,17–20, there seems to be a “divi-sion” that takes place from a soul at its higher (“self-begotten?”) phase to lower(embodied state). See Pearson’s note in Nag Hammadi Codices IX and X,ad loc.Later at 25,26–26,6 the text distinguishes the soul “that came into existence” from“the self-begotten soul.” This again seems to indicate a fall from a higher to lower(embodied) phase. “Come into existence” would mean “come into bodily exis-tence.” Corresponding to the fall is a loss of the soul’s power, represented by setsof vowels. See Pearson’s note in Nag Hammadi Codices IX and X,ad loc. Finally,at 41,16–22, there is a distinction between embodied souls “that are upon the earth”and “those outside of the body [sw'ma], those in heaven.” The latter class are “morethan the angels,” which Pearson assumes means that there are more human thanangelic souls. Rather, the idea may be that pure human souls in heaven are moredivine (“more” = “higher”?). Compare Chald. Or.frg. 138, where souls of theurgistsexist “in the angelic space.”69On the identification, see Pearson, Gnosticism,154.70See Pearson’s note in Nag Hammadi Codices IX and X,ad loc."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"hypostatic realm between the One and the Intellect, as Allogenesdoes.Fourth, it divides the realm of the Intellect into three members, not four,as Allogenesand (sometimes) Zostrianosdoes. Fifth, it does not mentionthe Being-Life-Mind triad. We must now address the question of whetherthese changes reflect an Iamblichean stance.7. Iamblichus and MarsanesAlthough Marsanesposits a Silent One over and above the InvisibleSpirit/Unbegotten One of the other Sethian texts, the Silent One is notequivalent to Iamblichus’s Completely Ineffable. The defining characteristicof the Ineffable is that it completely transcends the realms beneath it. TheIneffable “is not therefore participated [metevcetai], nor does anything havea share [metadivdwsi] of it” (Damascius Princ.1.25.21–22).71Marsanes’ SilentOne communicates with lower levels of being through the Triple-PoweredOne, which is its agent (7,12–15). Indeed, we are told (6,5–8):That one who exists before all of them reaches [to the divine] Self-engen-dered One [aujtogevnnhto\"].If the Silent One reaches to the lowest level of the Barbelo aeon, it cannotbe Iamblichus’s Completely Ineffable One.Some have thought that Iamblichus’s Myst.8.2 also presents evidencefor the Completely Ineffable.72There Iamblichus distinguishes two Ones(261.9–262.8):Before truly existing beings and universal principles is the One God, prioreven to the First God and King. It remains unmoving in the oneness of itsunity. Neither the intelligible nor anything else is interwoven with it. It issituated as a paradigm of the self-produced, self-engendered god who isthe only Father of the true Good, for he [the One God] is somethinggreater and prior, a source of all things and base of the intelligible primary forms that really exist. And from this One the independent god manifests itself, for which reason he [the first God and King] is both aIamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes24971Cf. Princ.1.21.11–14 and the texts cited by A.

From him[the first God and King] is substantiality and essence, for which reason heis called the Father of Essence. He [the first God and King] is pre-existentBeing, the principle of intelligibles, for which reason he is named Rulerof the Intelligible.Saffrey and Westerink73mistakenly associate the “One God” of this passagewith the Ineffable and the “First God and King” (oJ prw'to\" qeo;\" kai;basileuv\") with the “Monad uncoordinated with the triad” (ou[te...nohto;naujtw/' ejpiplevketai). Iamblichus, however, is clear that this entity is, rather,the One God (qeo;\" ei|\"). The subject of the first sentence (261.9–11) is thisOne God, and the pronoun (aujtw/', 261.12) in the next sentence must there-fore refer to him. Thus the highest of the Ones mentioned by Iamblichusin this passage is described in terms similar to that of the second of histhree Ones in Damascius Princ.2.1.4–8:After this we must examine whether there are two first principles beforethe first intelligible triad, the completely ineffable and the one uncon-nected with the triad [hJ ajsuntavkto\" pro;\" th;n triavda], as the greatIamblichus says in the 28th book of his most perfect Chaldaean Theology.Furthermore, Iamblichus in Myst.8.2 is expounding the Hermetic doctrineon the first cause (tov prw'ton ai[tion, 8.1.260.4). Thus whichever OnesIamblichus discusses in 8.2 will be causalOnes, not a Completely Ineffa-ble One. We must conclude, therefore, that the De Mysteriispassage con-cerns not the highest two (of three) Ones, but the lowest two. The highestOne of Myst.8.2 does, therefore, bear a resemblance to the Silent One ofMarsanes,but neither is equivalent to the Completely Ineffable, whichexists apart from and has no causal effect upon the rest of the universe.In Iamblichus’s realm of the One there were not only three Ones, butalso a principle of diversity, the Indefinite Dyad. Marsanesdiffers not onlyfrom Iamblichus’s system but also from that of other Sethian treatises.Marsanespreserves three ones (none of which is completely ineffable)but maintains the Sethian “Triple Power” as the cause of multiplication inthe lower realms. In Allogenes,there were two first-principles, the Invisi-ble Spirit and Triple-Powered One. The Triple-Powered One, however,became Mind (Barbelo) through the emanation of the Being-Life-Mindtriad inherent in the Triple-Powered One. In other words, the Triple-Powered One truly had three “powers” or levels through which the mul-tiplicity of the aeon of Barbelo could be said to be produced. Marsanes250John F. Finamore73Proclus: Théologie Platonicienne,3:xxxii–xxxiii."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"presents no such triad. Instead, the power of multiplication comes fromthe Triple-Powered One as a median between the Silent One and SpiritWithout Being, above, and Barbelo and her aeon, below. Thus, the Triple-Powered One is called the activity (ejnevrgeia) of the Silent One (7,16–19)74and is also the source of the knowledge that Barbelo becomes (9,1–8).This active One is “triple” in the sense that it is the active nature of theSilent One, exists after the Silent One but before Barbelo, and is theknowledge that Barbelo becomes.If this is correct (and we will deal with an alternate view momentar-ily), then the Marsanesagain differs from Iamblichus’s system in lackingboth an Indefinite Dyad and the Being-Life-Mind triad.Turner has recently attempted to introduce the Being-Life-Mind triadinto the Triple-Powered One in Marsanes.75There are two passages toconsider. In the first (8,18–29) there is an ambiguity in the clause “the thirdpower of the Three-Powered, when it had perceived [noei'n] him,76said tome.” Pearson takes the third power as referring to Autogenes and the pro-noun “me” to Marsanes; Turner thinks the former refers to Mentality andthe latter to Barbelo. Now if Marsaneswere assuming a Being-Life-Mindtriad in the Triple-Powered One, then the third power would be Mentality,if Marsanesadopted the Iamblichean order. On the other hand, ifMarsaneswere assuming that the Triple-Powered One is the immediatesource of the Barbelo aeon (as it is in Zostrianos), then the third powerwould be Autogenes. As Pearson points out,77Autogenes is called a “power”(duvnami\") that is “third [perfect (tevleio\")].”78Further, it is unprecedentedIamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes25174The text does not name him. It reads: “But the energy [ejnevrgeia] of that One<is> the Three-Powered One, the One unbegotten [before] the Aeon [aijwvn], nothaving [being (oujsiva)].” Turner, in his reply to Corrigan (10), thinks that the words“that One” refer not to the Triple-Powered One but to the Invisible One, whichexists between the Silent One and the Triple-Powered One. [The text should read:“But the activity of that One (the Invisible Spirit) <is> the Triple Powered) One.The Unbegotten One (i.e., the Invisible Spirit) is prior to the Aeon, since he is in-[substantial].” JDT]. (There is a similar ambiguity at 7,12.) Turner’s interpretation is,of course, possible, and it provides a role for the Invisible Spirit, about whichMarsanessays little otherwise. Nonetheless, elsewhere the words ejnevrgeia/ejn-ergei'nare used of the Triple-Powered One in its role as the activity of the SilentOne (6,22; 7,1–3; 7,23–24).75Turner in his reply to Corrigan, 10–11.76Or perhaps “me,” see Pearson, Marsanes,272–73.77Pearson, Marsanes,258 and 265.78Interestingly, the Triple-Powered One is called “the first perfect One” at7,27–29 and 8,4–7. This suggests that it is not Autogenes’ position in the aeon ofBarbelo that gains him this epithet, but rather his position as Son in the old Sethian"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"for an abstract concept like “Mentality” to address the Sethian elect,whereas Autogenes, as a descending savior figure, would naturally addressthem. The preponderance of the evidence is on Pearson’s side.The second problematic passage (9,1–28) concerns Barbelo, whodivides herself from the Triple-Powered One and stands apart as Knowl-edge (gnw'si\") of him. After Barbelo is hypostatized outside of the Triple-Powered One, the text continues (9,9–14):79She withdrew [ajnacwrei'n] from [these] two [powers], since she exists [out-side of] the Great One, [seeing what] is above [her, the Perfect One] whois silent.Pearson80remarks that “it is not clear from this passage exactly what Bar-belo is withdrawing from.” Turner believes that the two powers in questionare Existence and Vitality. The only two beings discussed in the twenty-eight-line passage (besides Barbelo herself), however, are the Silent One andthe Triple-Powered One. Furthermore, the clause immediately following thephrase “these two powers” refers to these two beings. The phrase “the GreatOne” is the Triple-Powered One, from which Barbelo emanated and outsideof which she now stands. The “Perfect One who is silent” is clearly the SilentOne, who is above her and the Triple-Powered One, who “is situated as sheis situated” (9,7–8).81It is in Barbelo’s separation from these higher beingsthat she begins the process of the creation of her complete aeon.82252John F. Finamoretriad of Father-Mother-Son. This would make Barbelo the second perfect One. SeePearson, Marsanes,258.79The translation is Turner’s in his reply to Corrigan, 10.80Marsanes,275.81The translation is Turner’s in his reply to Corrigan, 10.82This is, of course, a different meaning of “power” than that of 8,19, where thethree powers seemed to be Father-Mother-Son. It is worth noting that, in Marsanes’description of the twelfth seal (4,11–19), the Invisible Spirit is described as “belong-ing to the first Unbegotten [fem.].” This must be a reference to the Silent One, butthe use of the feminine is puzzling. It is possible that the feminine noun to beunderstood is “power,” from “three powers” that the Triple-Powered One possesses(4,15–16). If so, then the first power of the Triple-Powered One is the phase inwhich it is unified with the Silent One (and this is equivalent to the Invisible Spirit),the third power is Barbelo, the phase at which there is complete differentiationbetween knower and object, and the middle phase will be the Triple-PoweredOne itself, existing separately from the Silent One but not yet differentiated fromthe lower realm. If this were correct, then we may be able to make sense of thetriad knowledge/gnw'si\"–hypostasis/uJpovstasi\"–activity/ejnevrgeiabelonging to theSilent One in 9,16–18. His knowledge is Barbelo, his activity is the Triple-Powered One, and his hypostasis, then, would be what he is in himself qua"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"In the end, one cannot prove with absolute certainty that the authorof Marsanesis not alluding to the Being-Life-Mind triad. One can only saythat there is no overt mention of the triad here, that there is no need tosummon up the triad to explain the text, and that the burden of proof restson those who attempt to find allusions to the triad.Iamblichus had placed the Being-Life-Mind triad in the realm of theIntellect. Marsanesdoes not, although it does establish a triad in the Bar-belo aeon: Kalyptos-Protophanes-Autogenes. Indeed, Marsanesshows atriadic structure within all of its levels, as we have seen. Iamblichus alsocreated such triadic structures in his hypostatic realms, but there are impor-tant differences in Marsanes(viz., no use of the structure Unparticipated-Participated-In Participation, no Being-Life-Mind triad, no separateIntellectual realm).This brings us to a final difference with Iamblichus, the role of Auto-genes. We have seen from the other Sethian texts that Autogenes is a char-acter who does not fit well into the Platonic system because hismovements are unrestricted from the highest realms to the lowest. Thesame is true in Marsanes.Autogenes (“self-begotten”) descends from the“Unbegotten One, who does not have being [oujsiva], who is the Spirit[pneu'ma]” (6,3–5). “That one who exists before all of them reaches [to thedivine] Self-engendered One (aujtogevnnhto\"),” i.e., to Autogenes (6,5–7).83Autogenes is called a savior,84who descended to our realm to savehumanity. Just as in Allogenes,Autogenes is an Intellect figure that candescend into the realm of matter. A descending Intellect is not possible inPlatonism and is specifically denied by Iamblichus himself.85Pearson is wrong therefore when he claims that “Autogenes here playsthe same role as ‘the demiurgic intellect’ in Iamblichus’ discussion ofEgyptian theology.”86At issue between us is the interpretation of Myst.8.3.Iamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes253supreme being. The use of “power” in this instance then is in reference to thethree powers of the Triple-Powered One. If the same conception were used at8,18–29, then the “third power” would be Barbelo, not Autogenes. Even on thisinterpretation there is still no compelling reason to see the Being-Life-Mind triadat work in either passage. [See discussion and translation of Marsanes7,1–9,20 inthe previous paper in this volume, “The Setting of the Platonizing Sethian Trea-tises in Middle Platonism.” JDT]83For the identification, see Pearson, Marsanes,265–66. Whether “the one whoexists before them all” is the Silent One, as Pearson says, or the Invisible Spirit is incon-sequential to the point that Autogenes’ source is higher than the realm of Intellect.846,15–16: “as it is manifest that he saved a multitude.” See Pearson,Marsanes,235.85Myst.1.12. See also above, note 23.86Pearson, Marsanes,264."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"I will summarize this important chapter and explain why I do not think itentails a descending Demiurge.Iamblichus begins by delineating an Egyptian system consisting of atranscendent One (Eikton), an Intellect (Emeph), and various celestial gods(262.14–263.9). He then discusses the demiurgic intellect under variousnames (Amoun, Phtha, Osiris) (263.9–264.4). This intellect “descends togeneration and leads the invisible power of the hidden reason-principlesinto light” (ejrcovmeno\" me;n ejpi; gevnesin, kai; th;n ajfanh' tw'n kekrumevnwnlovgwn duvnamin eij\" fw'\" a[gwn, 263.9–10). The reason principles are, as itwere, enmattered forms that produce in nature what the gods haveplanned out beforehand and separately from nature. The Intellect does notmix with matter but illuminates the reason principles, which thereby pro-duce order in the material realm. Iamblichus goes on to explain that theEgyptians assign one set of rulers in the sun over the celestial bodies andanother set in the moon over material ones, and so on (264.5–14). Theseand not the Demiurge/Intellect mix with matter. Thus, Iamblichus con-cludes (in the passage that Pearson translates) that the Egyptians adopt asingle system from the One to matter. The One produced87matter from theessentiality of divided materiality; the Demiurge created (ejdhmiouvrghse,265.9) the impassive spheres (of the planets); he distributed (diekovsmhsen,265.10) the lowest form of matter among mortal bodies. The point is thatthe Demiurge/Intellect does not descend into and mix with matter.In summary, then, Marsanesdiffers in significant ways from the writ-ings of Iamblichus. In the realm of the One, Marsanes’Silent One is notlike Iamblichus’s Completely Ineffable and Marsanesdoes not make useof the Indefinite Dyad. Marsanesdoes not mention the Being-Life-Mindtriad. The role of Autogenes is unlike that of Iamblichus’s Intellect. Thereis no use of Iamblichus’s metaphysical triad of Unparticipated-Partici-pated-In Participation and no separate Intellectual realm between theIntelligible and Psychic realms. The Iamblichean Psychic triad of Hyper-cosmic Soul, World Soul, and Individual Souls is not equivalent to thetriad in Marsanes.8. ConclusionI began this paper with an examination of the metaphysical systemsof Iamblichus and the three Sethian texts Allogenes, Zostrianos,and theThree Steles of Seth.I tried to show that the three Sethian texts while254John F.

The dissimilarities show their various ways of dealing withSethian tenets (such as the Triple-Powered One, the placement and orderof the Being-Life-Mind triad, the number of entities in the Barbelo aeon,and the role of Autogenes) and with the Platonic system. Marsanesfitswell with these three texts. It shares with them the Sethian divinities andPlatonic structure. It exhibits differences too, such as the lack of theBeing-Life-Mind triad and of the Triple Male, but it clearly belongs withthe other three Sethian texts.The dating of Marsanesremains problematic. Since it bears nomarked similarity to Iamblichean Neoplatonism, it may easily be dated tothe same time period as the other three Sethian treatises. Although its useof a higher “Silent One” does not necessarily mark it as a work later thanthe others, its thoroughgoing use of triadic structure may suggest (but nomore than that) the influence of the kind of Neoplatonism existing in thetime of Porphyry.88If my earlier conjecture is correct that the other threeSethian treatises are to be placed in this same time period, then we havefour Sethian texts each using different methods of adapting Sethianism toPlatonism during a time when Porphyry is publishing the writings of Plot-inus (including those against the gnostics) and (presumably) his own anti-gnostic works.Although Iamblichus composed his works after Marsaneswas written,there is no decisive evidence that he knew either it or any similar Sethiantreatise. In Iamblichus’s only recorded reference to the gnostics (DA375.9),he states that they claim that the reason for the soul’s descent is paravnoiaand parevkbasi\". These two words are not found in Marsanesor any othergnostic text.89His use of the terms certainly does not convey any directknowledge of Marsanes.Thus, Marsanes,like the other Sethian treatises discussed above,seems to belong to a pre-Iamblichean time. Iamblichus, in his turn, seemsunaware of its existence. There is no compelling reason to see any con-nection between the Neoplatonic philosopher and this Sethian treatise. Itseems (again, if my chronology is accepted) that Plotinus and Porphyrysettled once and for all the Neoplatonic arguments against the gnostics.Thereafter the Sethians presented no threat to later Platonic philosopherssuch as Iamblichus.Iamblichus, the Sethians, and Marsanes25588The triadization exists throughout the system, even in the psychic and mate-rial realms. The desire to establish triads in each hypostasis may explain the addi-tion of the Silent One to the realm of the One, for otherwise the Silent One seemsto add very little to Marsanes’system or to the Invisible Spirit/Unbegotten One inthe other three Sethian texts.89See Pearson, Marsanes,267 and 275 n. 80."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Metaphysical Schemata256John F.

Formed in original clusters, they may migrate into distantdomains, where they can lose much of their natural shape and be drawnto novel ends. Few ideas in religious history are more difficult to track thanapophatic theology, the paradoxical claim that the ultimate deity exceedsthe bounds of human discourse. It is a complex notion, relying upon anexus of concepts in order to be intelligible. Its meaning is thus systematicand abstract, nesting in a host of related ideas and providing a second-order commentary upon them. Hence the project of its assessment by his-torians and philosophers of religion is itself difficult and fraught with peril.This paper is but a brief effort at that task, undertaken at the close ofour seminar’s inquiry into the relationship between “Gnosticism” and laterPlatonism. Both are traditions that are reputed to emphasize apophatic theology; both do indeed evince such thinking in varying degrees. Theintention of our session this year is to reflect on these trajectories, whichare often depicted as the twin sources of negative theology in Western reli-gious thought. My efforts will be directed primarily towards the Neopla-tonic side of the discussion, using Plotinus as my principal informant, butI will refer to “Gnosticism” throughout.

Finally, I have written thispiece as a seminar paper, inviting response on the points articulatedbelow. Hence it is framed in a less conclusive fashion than is perhaps cus-tomary, and it offers a number of explicit questions that are intended todirect our discussion. My goal is to connect up with the very fruitfulexchange that we enjoyed at our 1996 meetings in New Orleans.1. Apophasis and TranscendenceWe might begin with the most technical aspect of the apophatic tradi-tion, its role in the articulation of divine transcendence. Ancient meta-physics found the topic irresistible. The denial of predicative ascription tothe first principle was part of a strategy for presenting the ontological sta-tus of such an entity. It is an approach whose roots go back at least as faras Parmenides. It is worth remembering that in the background of Par-menides’ thought lay the early mathematical realism of the Pythagoreans,whose numerology was a first step towards an articulation of a class ofdivine entities removed from the spatio-temporal world. This is an initial,historical clue to the nature of classical apophatic theology, its critical asso-ciation with some form of realism.But realism itself was constitutive of the effort to reconceptualize thedivine world, to offer an alternative to the pantheon, and to discover a dif-ferent mode of articulating the “place” of the divine. We find in Plato aformal and abstract account of a transcendent world, a level of existencenot just invisible or hidden, but also nonspatial and atemporal. The formswere separate from the sensible world because they were predicatively sta-ble, unlike the transients of the visible world. Moreover, forms occupied alevel of reality superior to the things of this world, so that the noetic cos-mos was understood to be divine and perfect in contrast to the ontologi-cal squalor of becoming.Two points should be noted: transcendence in Plato was initiallyunderstood in reference to predication, to the perfect predication thatdefined the nature and status of the ei[dh. The constituents of “being” weresupremely knowable because they were perfect paradigms of the qualitiesthat they defined. The intelligible world transcended the sensible realmprecisely because of its apodictic character. This meant that separationfrom change, time, and space was tied conceptually to the perfection and260John Peter Kenney"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"qualitative stability of the forms. There was, therefore, nothing murkyabout transcendence. An additional upshot of this approach was its non-anthropomorphism. The forms were primarily conceived as being proper-ties, and, although there was considerable discussion about the scope ofbeing in the Academy, there remained a preponderant emphasis on whatmight be called the predicative foundations of transcendence. The othernatural source for a theory of transcendence, psyche, was relegated to asubordinate status. Accounts of the immortality of psyche in the Phaedoand of its origins in the Timaeusassociate animacy with the higher worldof the intelligibles. Hence the roots of the Platonic tradition’s understand-ing of transcendence rested upon a particular, abstract theory about uni-versals, predicates, qualities, and properties.So too did the origins of apophatic ontology. It is with the difficultiesthat Plato identified in his own theory of forms that the impetus forapophatic discourse can be found. However the Parmenidesmight beread, it was a preeminent source for apophatic discourse in subsequentclassical thought. There Plato confronted the conundrum of his realism: itspotentially recessive character, exhibited in the infamous “third-man” argu-ment. Plato may very well have been experimenting with conceptions ofunity that avoid the problems that the Parmenidesidentified as endemicto the theory of self-predicable forms. In that case, such unities might haveserved as replacements for forms, as a new class of intelligibles. But theevidence of Speusippus and the Old Academy indicates that this thinkingwas applied to a final unity beyond the intelligibles. What matters for ourpurposes is this: the transcendence of the forms and the further transcen-dence of a final One were conceptually linked from the beginning withinthe Platonic tradition.Realist ontology was vital, then, to the notion of the apophatic One.As a seminar we need to come to terms with this. The doctrine of the Oneas the transcendent “ground of being” was postulated as an extension ofPlatonic ontology. As Aubenque suggested, it represented “un dépasse-ment de l’ontologie grecque classique.”2This is true of the thought of Plot-inus as well as that of earlier—if poorly attested—figures such asModeratus. The apophatic theology of these authors in the Pythagorean-Platonic trajectory rested on a degree of reality metaphysics. The Onestood in a complex but superior relation to the constituents of “being,”which themselves are preeminent in reference to their ontological clients.The o[ntawere thus conceptually pivotal: they were the standards thatlower entities only approximated, while they were also the level of finiteperfection that the One exceeded.Ancient Apophatic Theology2612Cited in J. P. Kenney, Mystical Monotheism: A Study in Ancient Platonic The-ology(Hanover and London: Brown University Press, 1991), 135."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Apophatic theology might thus be said to have been part of a “double”transcendence theory. The first level of transcendence was the postulationof the intelligibles, which stood outside space, time, qualitative alteration,etc. A second, higher notion of transcendence was then employed in refer-ence to the One, which was understood to exceed even the perfection ofthe o[nta. As has been suggested, the One’s transcendence of being mayhave been required to staunch the explanatory regress identified by the“third-man” argument. If one postulates a hierarchy of perfect unities uponwhich lower entities depend ontologically and by which they are defined,then a problem arises regarding the source and foundation of these unities.A host of related philosophical issues are involved with this line of reflec-tion, prominent among which are the principle of sufficient reason and theparadoxes of self-reference. None can be explored here, but they should beregistered in order to underscore one central point: the apophatic One wasnot a theological notion independent of some very precise claims in meta-physics upon which its conceptual character depended.One critical question now emerges for our consideration of “Gnosti-cism”: do the various sorts of “gnostic” theology indicate a commitment torealist ontology? If so, then we have before us distinct but conceptuallyrelated theologies. If not, then we are faced with at least a partial impasse.There is no doubt that some of the same discourse, the language of clas-sical apophatic theology, was transferred into some “gnostic” theologies.But are the ontological foundations of both trajectories similar? I attemptedto address these questions in a paper on the Tripartite Tractatefor thegreat Oklahoma Gnostic “Roundup” of 1984.3But I remain uncertainwhether the same ontology underlies, for example, both the Platonic intel-ligible world and the Valentinian pleroma, despite some obvious thematicsimilarities. What follows from this is agnosticism regarding the exact com-mensurability of apophatic theology in Platonic and Valentinian thought.This worry could, of course, be generalized further. Notice in particularthat the Platonic tradition had quite exact reasons for its “double transcen-dence” thesis and a precise account of the perfect predication that it for-swore in reference to the One. Apophatic theology did not serve as a“first-order” articulation of divine transcendence. Rather, it constituted ahigher-order support for the transcendent nature of the ei[dh, and it articu-lated by projection the general notion of a final divine unity.The point might be put somewhat differently by asking two related setsof questions. First, what was the “metaphysical location” of those entities inthe “gnostic” texts that seem analogous to “being” and the forms? Were thepleroma, the aeons, the Triple-Powered One, Barbelo, etc. separate from262John Peter Kenney3J. P.

Weare all aware how vexed the question of transcendence was in antiquityand how difficult was the Platonic notion of metaphysical separation. Dothe various “gnostic” texts tell a story about intracosmic entities, aboutpowers within this cosmos? Or do we have the Platonic two-world the-ory—a story about distinct levels of reality—clearly involved? The samequestion applies, as we know, to patristic texts, with the relevant contrastexisting between Stoicizing Christians such as Tertullian and Platonizingauthors such as Clement of Alexandria and Origen. And we might furtherrecall that this very issue—the nature of transcendence—was central toAugustine’s anti-Manichean polemic in the middle books of the Confes-sions.Are we certain that this same Augustinian contrast, between a strongor Platonic theory of divine transcendence and a much weaker one, is notalso to be found between the two traditions that we are analyzing?Here a brief parenthetical remark might be apposite. I take it that weare now quite uncomfortable with the universal attribution of anticosmismto the “gnostics.” Perhaps we might begin to wonder whether we fell intothat mistaken mode of analysis because we also have tended to interpo-late a tacit Platonic ontology into these texts. Have we been culturally dis-posed to supply a “degree of reality” metaphysics where there was no suchsharply articulated understanding of transcendence? Perhaps we have beendisposed to represent the structure of reality along lines subtly differentfrom those that were original to the “gnostic” texts and to see negativeevaluations of the visible cosmos as far more sweeping than the texts por-tray. To denigrate part of an interconnected cosmos is, after all, differentfrom rejecting a separate level of reality. It might then be asked whetheran earlier misreading of the inherent anticosmism of many “gnostic” textswas itself not founded on another misreading, the tendency of several gen-erations of scholars to use Platonic “degree of reality” ontology as a foun-dation for interpreting “gnostic” ontologies?These queries lead to a second set of concerns about the strategy ofapophasisin “Gnosticism.” Does apophatic theology function in “gnostic”texts to establish a further ontological level beyond the threshold of tran-scendence? Or do these accounts articulate the hidden presence of anentity that is vastly greater and more exalted than those that can bedescribed, but that is not clearly understood as marking off or occupyinga status “beyond” the transcendent character of the intelligibles? We know,for example, that Marsanespostulates a silent and unknown One beyondthe Invisible Spirit, itself above the Triple-Powered One, from whichemanates the Aeon of Barbelo. Is the ontological status of this InvisibleSpirit, or of the Triple-Powered One, or the “summit” of the silent One’ssilence (Marsanes7,20–21), analogous to the sharply separate character ofthe Plotinian One?

If not, then we would needto differentiate separate schools of negative theology with distinctivemeanings, though similarity through mutual interaction would be an openhistorical question. I take it that the work of this seminar has advanced thislatter question toward the affirmative. But the former issue remains—in myjudgment—still open.I hasten to add that I agree with the suggestion of Michael Williams thatwe can certainly see the transference of Platonic apophatic language into“gnostic” texts.4John Turner’s papers for this group have also been con-vincing regarding the transfer of discourse between these trajectories ofthought. The Apocryphon of John,the Tripartite Tractate, Marsanes,andAllogenesare obvious examples. But that discourse needs to be understooddifferently, for it has been embedded into another theological grammar andhas lost its original ontological foundations. Our task, then, as historians oftheology is to recover that new context and its adjusted meaning, and per-haps to understand the purpose behind these instances of borrowing.2. Apophatic and Kataphatic TheologyAll apophatic theology requires a first-order religious discourse towhich it takes exception. As A. H. Armstrong put it in one of his laterpapers: “a negative theology needs a positive theology to wrestle with andtranscend.”5This observation might allow us to expand upon the pointmade in the first section: apophatic theology in the Platonic tradition turnedon classical realism; perhaps that much might be granted. But an initial,broader question emerges: Are there some guiding reasons for the effort tocorrect, extend, or reject this initial level of theological discourse? And wemight further inquire whether those reasons are articulated. To approachthese questions I will make a few observations regarding the Platonic tra-dition and invite parallel suggestions regarding the “gnostic” trajectory.The “critical value” of negative theology has been discussed for sometime.6This reading of the ancient Platonic texts suggests that the ascensionof the spiritual intellect—which apophatic theology seems meant to 264John Peter Kenney4M. A. Williams, “Negative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity,”SBL Seminar Papers, 1997(SBLSP 36; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997), 20–46. [See thefollowing paper in this volume.]5A. H.

Otherwise, there would havebeen nothing to negate, nothing for the contemplative soul to exceed andsurpass. An established theology would seem, then, to have been a pre-condition of Platonic apophasis.The critical value of negative theologyshould thus be seen as the result of this exception to a fixed set of theo-logical claims. For Platonists, that meant correcting their metaphysicalaccount of the intelligible world. The great apophatic ascension texts of thePlatonic tradition derive their spiritual drama from the soul’s forced move-ment beyond what was otherwise understood to be perfection as such.Thus “being,” “life,” “mind,” “divinity,” “rest,” “beauty,” “goodness,” and thelike all must be rejected and surpassed by the soul seeking the One. Theenergy of the via negativais directly proportional to the degree to whichthese epithets had been previously understood as descriptive of divinity.There was, within the Platonic tradition, an intricate process by which anormative metaphysical language was first established in regard to theintelligible world and then excerpted to a higher, contemplative end.Apophatic theology among Platonists derived its critical value and its con-templative efficacy from the shock of aphairesis,of conceptual strippingaway from accepted accounts of “being” and the intelligibles.But there was no escaping kataphasis.This was true in several ways.As Michael Williams noted in reference to “gnostic” texts, apophatic theol-ogy was usually connected up with kataphatic claims.7This—we mightnow see—is a conceptual necessity, for they are interrelated. Apophasiswithout kataphasiswould be empty. Moreover, even the most intenselyapophatic theology is guided by a tacit conception of its divine or ultimateprinciple. Otherwise, its process of negation would be nothing but an exer-cise in skepticism. Yet it is clear that the Platonists of late antiquity tookthe reality of the One very seriously and were guided both by their kat-aphatic accounts of intelligible “being” and by their tacit understanding ofthe One.This last point is an important opening for our comparative inquiry.It invites us to look for a moment at this subtle, Platonic conception ofthe One and the grounds for its articulation. We might, on that basis,have grounds to compare it to “gnostic” conceptions. Despite the stren-uousness of Plotinian aphairesis,there is a cluster of notions that lurkbehind Plotinus’s discussion, wrapped in his characteristic oi|onphrases.Even Plotinus uses some privileged language, terms such as “One,”“Good,” “first,” “source,” etc. And it is also clear that, while the Oneresists conceptual specification, some concepts fit better than others.Ancient Apophatic Theology2657M.

Here we need to take particular carewith this sensitive—indeed neuralgic—point for Plotinus, given his con-stant and insistent proscriptions against kataphatic description of theOne. This vague notion of what was, and was not, acceptable in refer-ence to the One was based in part on those philosophical scruples wehave already discussed. But it was also founded upon a theologicalreflection, of what was understood culturally to be proper to the ulti-mate divinity, of what was qeoprephv\". To say that the One was “good”was to rely on some theological representation, however qualified byapophasis.It is admittedly difficult to know quite how to represent thisspiritual understanding. While Plotinus would not allow it to be pre-sented as conceptual or intellective, it was nevertheless either a vectorfor the contemplative soul or perhaps a preconceptual grasp of at leastsome aspect of the One. This suggests that there was a proper waytowards the One, despite the soul’s fears of contemplative ascent (e.g.,Enn.5.1.9.3). Or alternatively, it suggests that there was a preconcep-tual, approximate sense of the One available to the soul, according toPlotinus. Either construal (and they are not exclusive) indicates that Plot-inus was trading upon some general representation of divinity, despitehis commitment to apophasis.The story may be more interesting even than this, and we shall returnto explore the connection of Hellenic theology and apophasisin the nextsection. But we need now to recognize that apophatic theology tradesupon kataphatic theology in a variety of ways. These patterns of semanticinterrelation are determinative of the meaning of any given theological tradition. This binary relationship between kataphatic and apophatic components established the special character of Neoplatonic theology,with (as we have seen) its particular notion of the intelligibles and its clus-ter of “pointer terms” that it diffidently employed in reference to the One.These formed the normative theological foreground against which apopha-siswas employed.This suggests both a general and a specific observation. If kataphatictheology is understood to be central to apophasis,then—as a rule—nega-tive theologies differ in their meaning depending on the theological tradi-tion upon which they are based. While formally related as modes ofnegative discourse, they each establish a different form of theological por-traiture. In the case of Plotinus, this contextualist thesis indicates that hisnegative theology requires a reading that keeps that foreground present.We might turn now to an exploration of that issue."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Ancient Apophatic Theology2673. Hellenic TheologyIf negative theologies are not all alike, but only formally similar, thenkataphatic traditions emerge again as highly significant to the study ofapophatic theology. The kataphatic foundations of the various sorts of“gnostic” thought would be an interesting inquiry, one that might threatento plunge its investigators back into the quest for the origins of “Gnosti-cism,” or at least into the specification of some theological context for each“gnostic” text. But I assume—perhaps wrongly—that the kataphatic fore-ground of the Sethian or Valentinian texts was quite different from that ofPlotinus and the Platonic school. This is another question that might warrant further discussion. Nonetheless, the background of Plotinianthought is itself quite clearly Greco-Roman, and it might be useful now tobring that to bear on our subject.We might consider the religious roots of Neoplatonic apophasis.Thethesis that I have argued elsewhere is that negative theology was a con-stitutive development within Greco-Roman religious thought, a result ofefforts to refine and elaborate the archaic account of sacred reality.8Onthis view, the ancient pantheon of sacrificial polytheism underwent vari-ous strategies of revision in the classical period, among which was thegradual elaboration of a type of Greco-Roman monotheism. Were I acomparativist, it would be tempting to connect this pattern of polytheisticrevision with similar changes in the Vedic pantheon, to which Greco-Roman theology was remotely related historically, and to which it bearsconsiderable resemblance. The willingness to countenance various theo-logical appraisals of a sacrificially based polytheism is a feature, commonto both Hindu and Hellenic thought, worth underscoring as we continueour reflections.What remains to be said about this thesis is perhaps already obvious:the employment of negative theology was an indigenous part of the emer-gence of Greco-Roman monotheism out of archaic polytheism. This transi-tion was a prolonged and complex development. Its basis was the religiousstructure of classical polytheism, which tended to see the gods, includingthe Olympians, as focal manifestations of the more obscure power of divin-ity itself. The gods were the anthropomorphic foreground of the divine, butbehind them was a deeper, primordial reservoir of power. There was alsoa pronounced effort in the classical period, exemplified by Aeschylus, tocollect these anthropomorphic forces into a single power and to associatethis principle with primordial divinity itself. This “Zeus monotheism” was8J. P. Kenney, Mystical Monotheism,32–42, 150ff.; and “Monotheistic and Polythe-istic Elements in Classical Mediterranean Spirituality,” in Classical Mediterranean Spir-ituality(ed. A. H. Armstrong; New York: Crossroad, 1986), 269–92."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"one response to the need to clarify the theology of ancient polytheism.Related to it was the gradual emergence of the divine mind as a distinct the-ological principle separate from the gods. Xenophanes and Empedocleswere examples of this, so too are Aristotle and Xenocrates. The Middle Platonic conception of a supreme mind at the level of transcendent beingwas the direct result of this line of theological development.The theological character of Middle Platonism had several aspects thatwarrant our attention. First is the exaltation of a supreme and transcendentnous,whose primordial status was achieved by emphasizing its remotenessand indifference to the cosmos. An abstraction from earlier “Zeus theism,”this theology presented the divine mind as distant and removed. As aresult, compensatory focus was placed upon secondary or intermediarypowers, whose spiritual accessibility was greater and whose cosmologicalinfluence was more immediate. Chief among these was the second mind,or demiurge, the fashioner of the cosmos. The theologies of Numenius andAlcinous both evince this pattern.9This “demotion of the demiurge” sug-gests a determined effort to clarify the character of the first god such thatit is wholly removed from materiality. Implicit in this model, of course, isa tacit dualism from which Middle Platonism was never free. The details ofthis model varied, but it was common for active agency to be located in asecondary or even tertiary power. Lesser gods, astral powers, and other tra-ditional deities had a place as well.This hierarchical theology, with its ranks of powers culminating in thefirst nous,seems a natural one, consistent as it surely was with the con-ventions of classical piety and with Platonic “degree of reality” ontology.But there remained one problem. To identify the first principle as a divinemind at the head of a chain of powers ran the risk of collapsing that divineentity into the rest of that series. By locating the supreme mind within thehierarchy of being, Middle Platonic theism tended to assimilate it to theoverall systems of reality and to obscure its supremacy.10It was in this context that negative theology came to the fore. It is pos-sible to trace its history, even if our evidence is meager.11We can find itemployed in authors such as Alcinous to help refine the nature of the firstnous.In the well-known Did.10 passage, Alcinous attempted to removethe first nousfrom epithets that would associate it with lower levels of real-ity, while also endorsing its self-sufficiency, perfection, goodness, and paternity. Here negative theology is used as one strategy of divine por-traiture. Yet it was also true that others were articulating a somewhat 268John Peter Kenney9J. P. Kenney, Mystical Monotheism,ch. 2.10Ibid., 88–90.11Ibid., ch. 1."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"different, more abstract conception of a first principle through the use ofnegative theology. As we are all aware, it is difficult to achieve much his-torical precision on this subject. Yet I do think it likely that a more sweep-ing theological use of negative theology was employed prior to Plotinus by monotheistic Neopythagoreans such as Eudorus and Modera-tus. This suggests that apophatic thought was particularly central to thedevelopment of another type of Greco-Roman theism, the theology of thedivine One, a power beyond both nousand being.The pre-Plotinian history of this theology matters for us only to theextent that it furnishes a context for Plotinian apophasis.In Plotinus thisalternative form of Greco-Roman monotheism begins to come very clearlyinto focus, largely through his relentless use of negative theology. His wasa theology of divine simplicity. Negative theology was systematicallydeployed to prevent the One’s assimilation to all other sorts of reality,which were treated as its consequents. The One was the final divine unity,the ultimate source of reality. As such it was necessary to delineate theOne from all finite beings subsequent to it by removing it from the logicof predicative ascription. Apophatic discourse allowed Plotinus to rejectresolutely any conception that might have allowed the One to be drawnback into the structure of reality, whether that reality was transcendent ofthe spatio-temporal world or contained within the cosmos. As noted ear-lier, this “double transcendent” thesis was a hallmark of Plotinian theol-ogy and marked a critical advance in monotheistic theory. What Plotinusachieved, therefore, was the codification, through innovation, of Greco-Roman monotheism.12Negative theology was, on this account, part of the theological gram-mar of Hellenic theism. Its limited use among pre-Plotinian thinkers, suchas Alcinous or Numenius, was nonetheless important to their representa-tion of the first deity. In Plotinus, apophatic discourse became a preemi-nent tool for philosophical theology, the chief method for clarifying thecharacter of the first principle. In each of these cases, negative theologywas deeply interwoven into the tradition, an aspect consistent with Hel-lenic religious thought and piety. Through its use, a long-standing elementof that tradition, its latent theism, came to new conceptual clarity. In thisrespect, negative theology should be seen as a specific strategy within theGreco-Roman tradition, rather than merely a conceptual or philosophicaldevice that was—in its formal character—largely “portable.” Negative the-ology might thus be said to have had its own particular history, tied in withthe emergence of monotheism within Greco-Roman religion.This reading of classical negative theology raises, then, the question ofthe relation between Greco-Roman apophasisand “gnostic” versions. HereAncient Apophatic Theology26912Ibid., ch. 3."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"is a fertile source for renewed discussion. If this reading is generally cor-rect, then Neoplatonic theology was endemically apophatic. Moreover, this“negative theism” was a natural outgrowth of Hellenic spirituality, the resultof the gradual effort to explore the divine unity behind the surface tale ofpolytheism. Several issues then emerge: Can we discover a similar accountto explain “gnostic” apophasis?In the past I have tended to contrast Hel-lenic theism, and its indigenous negative theology, to Abrahamic monothe-ism, which was centered on a single, personalized divine being.13Free fromthe burden of grounding a pantheon in an ultimate divine unity, Abrahamicmonotheism went about the project of articulating its more sharply exclu-sive sort of theism in a different way. Hellenic apophatic theology was animportation into that tradition; Philo or Clement of Alexandria are examples.But these remained two separate traditions of ancient monotheism.Can “gnostic” apophasisbe given a local habitation and a fairly spe-cific reason for its emergence? Was it similarly central to any given form of“gnostic” theology? I take it from Michael Williams’s paper that we have inthe past overemphasized the apophatic component in “gnostic” thought.Again, this may be due to the tendency, noted earlier, to import Platonisminto our hermeneutic of “Gnosticism.” But if we have placed too muchweight on “gnostic” apophasis,then we need to adjust and consider anewits proper value in any given “gnostic” text or school of thought. To do sowe need to decide what conceptual role apophatic theology played ineach case, and whether this represented only a marginal role—perhaps asa culturally based instance of borrowing—or a more significant function,though not an essential one. In this regard I would ask in particularwhether those who study “Gnosticism” might regard it as perhaps an effortto re-envision elements of the Abrahamic tradition using the resources ofHellenic theism, including apophatic discourse. This has been a questionthat has lingered in my own mind over the past few years as we traced thelines of interaction between later Platonism and “Gnosticism.” If that isplausible, at least in some instances, then we would need to reflect on thereasons for that effort to translate and revise a mode of religious thoughtheld by a minority group into the discourse of the culturally dominantpagan world. The present task, then, is to work through specific apophatictexts within the “gnostic” pleroma and to sort out the theological contextfrom which such theology departed. If “gnostic” apophasisfollows patternsthat are rational, then recovery of these kataphatic foundations and theimplicit rules of their negation should be specifiable.A final note on demiurgic theology and apophasis:Michael Williams hassuggested that we might use the category “demiurgical myth” to collect270John Peter Kenney13See J. P. Kenney, “Monotheistic and Polytheistic Elements in Classical Mediter-ranean Spirituality,” 269–92."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"some of the theologies we have been considering. The operative distinctionwould be between a first god and that entity to which active cosmologicalagency was attributed. This is an interesting approach and suggests a fur-ther point that follows from the thesis iterated here. The concept of anactive demiurge, subordinated to first god, would be—on my analysis—afundamental feature of Hellenic theism. Emphasis upon a demiurgic secondpower was part of the project of moving away from the lingering anthro-pomorphism of earlier accounts of a divine mind. This was, in part, theimpetus for thinkers like Numenius and Alcinous. It is interesting that moredualistic philosophers such as Plutarch or Atticus were inclined to retain afirst principle that acts directly as a demiurge.14 As noted, the demotion ofthe demiurge, which was increasingly pronounced in the later Middle Pla-tonic period, was a development driven by the need to secure a clear claimto ultimacy of a first principle. There was a compelling logic to this movewithin the Hellenic theological tradition.We might then consider whether we can offer a similar conclusionregarding “Gnosticism.” There are several alternative ways to get its demi-urgic character. One would be to identify a similar, indigenous reason forthe postulation of a demiurge. Another would be to discover a basis forthe adoption of this demiurgic model within any form of “Gnosticism.”This would be to assume a Hellenic origin for this theology and wouldfocus attention on the basis for its transfer into a different mode of theol-ogy. The latter analysis would suggest once again that Greco-Roman the-ism was drawn upon by “gnosticizing” thinkers intent upon revising anantecedent system of theology. These two approaches clearly have impli-cations regarding the sources of “Gnosticism,” or at least of any given“gnostic” text.Perhaps I might conclude this section with an incautious observation.The real work for future comparative analysis between Greco-Roman and“gnostic” theology lies here, in the study of the complex development ofHellenic theism in late antiquity and the stimulation that this afforded toother religious schools, especially some forms of Judaism and Christian-ity. Just as we have been conditioned to think about “Gnosticism” throughthe lens of Platonic transcendentalism, so too have we been inclined, byhabit and disposition, to treat the theology of the majority tradition of thepre-Theodosian Empire as if it were a minor sideshow, unlikely to havehad the merit to have influenced anyone, except in details. I do not wishto sound crypto-Harnackian, but we will continue to make progress inour comparative work only if we could treat the wide band of later Hel-lenic theism (i.e., the Neopythagoreans, the Middle Platonists, Hermetica,Ancient Apophatic Theology27114J. P. Kenney, Mystical Monotheism,57–84 on Numenius and Alcinous; ibid.,43–53 on Plutarch."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Chaldean Oracles,Plotinian and Iamblichean Neoplatonism, etc.) as apowerful theological tradition, prestigious and authoritative as it was.Then we will begin to imagine better why others might have wished toadopt its ideas and why its closely connected conceptions of an apo-phatic One and a demiurge were adapted by other schools and traditions.If we can make this shift in our dispositions, then we can describe theconnections of “Gnosticism” and Platonism in different, more compre-hensive terms.4. Soteriology and Sacred HierarchyMention has been made in our recent sessions of the “locative”dimension of both “gnostic” and later Platonic theology. I would like toget at this aspect briefly, but without being drawn into terminology basedon agendas from outside our domain. Perhaps we might use the notionof “hierarchy,” that is, the idea that there are levels of divinity and reality.There is an inevitable spatial component to such thinking, one that is dif-ficult to remove. Apophatic theology was related to this hierarchicalaspect of later antique religious thought in ways that invite reflection. Onedominant theme throughout Greco-Roman theism is the idea that the cos-mos is an ordered whole that mirrors the transcendent order. GregoryShaw has done a fine job of articulating this aspect of later Platonism inhis recent book on Iamblichus.15Following J. Z. Smith,16he suggests thatIamblichus was the great restorer of the “locative” religious model,whereby the soul’s salvation is understood to derive from its congruencewith the cosmos, from its inhabitation of its proper place in a fundamen-tally ordered and good universe. On this account, Iamblichus rejected themore pessimistic Numenian-Plotinian line of thought, which culminated inPlotinus’s innovative view “that the soul did not descend entire.” This doc-trine of the undescended soul suggested that the lower reaches of thecosmos were evil, so that the soul’s descent brought it into polluted con-tact with matter. Why else would the soul’s connection with the transcen-dental world be so assiduously retained, by insisting on its continuedontological association with the noetic realm, if its embodiment were notan act of evil defilement?The central contrast would be between Plotinus and the “gnostics” onthe one hand, over against the school of Iamblichus on the other. Toquote Shaw:17272John Peter Kenney15G. Shaw, Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus(UniversityPark: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), 1–17.16J. Z.

Plotinus’ . . . view of the soul, which may have been influenced byGnostic dualists, was unorthodox from a Platonic perspective.Iamblichus emerges on this account as a neoconservative Platonist. Theburden of his efforts was to restore the classical valuation of the physicaluniverse. He did so through his restoration of the “locative” aspect of Pla-tonism, its commitment to the principle of hierarchy, and his adoption oftheurgy, the practice of Hellenic ritual. It is the former that is apposite toour topic.We might now consider apophatic theology in reference to this con-trast within the Platonic tradition. Let’s set aside the question of lateantique pessimism and its attribution to “Gnosticism” or to Plotinus. Whatis interesting about the contrast between Plotinus and Iamblichus is theircommon commitment to apophatic theology and to Hellenic theism. Whatdivides them is their separate understanding of the hierarchy of reality andthe soul’s place within it. Their dispute centers on soteriology. To quoteShaw again:18In theurgy, Iamblichus provided a soteriology that theoretically couldtouch any soul, from the most material to the most spiritual, while pre-serving their communal affiliations. With a more consistent metaphysicsIamblichus succeeded in restructuring Plato’s teachings in a way that pre-served the mystical elements of Plotinus’ soteriology without losing con-tact with the physical cosmos or society.Plotinus and his school are thus committed to what might be called an“autosoteriology.” As Porphyry put it in De Abstinentia(2.49.1): “In everyrespect the philosopher is the savior of himself.”This analysis suggests that apophatic theology could support two dis-tinctive types of theism within Neoplatonism: an Iamblichean theology inwhich the idea of the hidden One reinforced the idea of levels of reality,and a Plotinian theology in which the notion of an ineffable One was con-ducive of greater permeability among these levels. Hierarchy and the “loca-tive” aspect of classical theology would be undercut by the Plotinianmodel, both by the doctrine of the undescended soul and by his under-Ancient Apophatic Theology27318Ibid., 14."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"standing of the omnipresence of the One. Thus Plotinian soteriologywould track the special character of his ontology.But it might also be argued that Plotinian apophatic theology does notundercut the locative dimension of later Platonism. By its predicative resist-ance, the One can be said to be omnipresent to all its consequents in waysconsistent with their nature, for it has no fixed nature of its own to enforceseparation. For Plotinus, that then means that qewrivacan reveal the soul’splace in the structure of reality and its underlying ontological connectionto the One. It is the latter feature that appears to the contemplative soul asits undescended aspect. To admit this is not to deny hierarchy or to rejectthe locative, only to press out the implications of ontological omnipres-ence. Indeed, a proper reading of Plotinian contemplation would begrounded in an enlightened recognition of the soul’s rootedness in all lev-els of reality and in the One.19The late antique Platonic debate over sote-riology may well be the product of Porphyry’s own approach to his masterPlotinus, with his emphasis on the model of psychic flight, and ofIamblichus’s reaction to that approach. Even so, the dispute indicates thatPlatonic negative theology was open to a range of variations.That point raises a final series of comparative questions. Is it possibleto find similar approaches to hierarchy within the various “gnostic” texts?Can these be seen to track along the same lines of ontological representa-tion, and is there any connection of these different ontologies to divergentsoteriologies? Do instances of “gnostic” apophasisunderscore or subvertthe “locative” aspect of such theology? All of these seem to be naturalpoints of comparison.5.

This semi-nar paper was intended in that spirit, in recognition of our place in whatis surely the initial phase in the study of “Gnosticism” and its relation tolate antique Platonic theology. We are still, I believe, at the stage of recon-naissance, as we survey the texts and try out different theories to explaintheir features. There are several modest suggestions embedded in thispaper that I should like now to collect in lieu of a conclusion. They aredesigned to help make the future task of debunking our contributionsmore difficult.As has been suggested, I have come to think that importation of Pla-tonic transcendentalism into the study of “Gnosticism” may be a source ofconfusion. This has been the “tolmeric” basis of my concerns, voiced in274John Peter Kenney19This is argued at some length in my paper, “Mysticism and Contemplation inthe Enneads,” American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly71.3 (Summer 1997) 1–23."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"earlier years, about commensurability. I worry that this may be yet anotheritem that found its way uncritically into the study of “Gnosticism,” a resultof the training of most students in the field. Using Platonism as a templatemay have led to a more radical reading of the hierarchical character of“Gnosticism,” to a more rarefied understanding of its notion of transcen-dence, and perhaps to a heightened sense of its acosmism. Again, allowme to reiterate that this is not meant as a wholesale criticism of the com-parative work that many scholars have done. Rather, it is a plea for con-tinued refinement of the basis of those comparison. Perhaps we havedone the “gnostics” a disservice by too often reading them as mythologi-cally inclined Platonists.The other concern beneath the surface in this paper is our continuingneed—indeed, scholarly obligation—to recover the authentic tradition ofpagan Hellenic theology. It is necessary that we come to understand seri-ously and sympathetically the metaphysics and theology of what was, formuch of the period we study, the most prestigious and culturally authori-tative tradition, and the one subscribed to, at various levels, by the major-ity in the Roman world. Only then will its persuasive force be clear to usand its powerful presence be more certainly recognized within “gnostic,”Jewish, and Christian thought. This is now a great opportunity for progressin comparative study, one to which many of our members have made dis-tinguished contributions. This is surely one of the great desiderata in thestudy of Western religious thought, the need for recovery of the late clas-sical tradition. In this respect, our short-lived seminar has been quite sin-gular, even exemplary. And, nested as it has been in the Society of BiblicalLiterature, who would dare to think that the irony of its presence has failedto excite delight in Elysium?Ancient Apophatic Theology275"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"NEGATIVETHEOLOGIES ANDDEMIURGICALMYTHSINLATEANTIQUITYMichael A. WilliamsUniversity of Washington (Seattle)1. IntroductionAmong the most famous examples of negative theological speculationfrom late antiquity are some of those sources customarily assigned to thecategory “Gnosticism.” In an insightful article surveying various ancientforms of negative theology and their emphases on the unknowability of thehighest God or suprasensible reality, the late Richard Wallis suggested that“it is in Gnosticism . . . that we find the strongest pre-Neoplatonic affirma-tions of divine unknowability.” And yet Wallis also observed that in spite ofour greatly expanded information about such myths, due to the availabilityin the latter part of this century of new sources such as those from NagHammadi Coptic codices or the related Berlin Codex 8502, “the significanceof Gnostic negative theology remains as controversial as ever.”1Drawing on certain pertinent results and implications of scholarlyresearch on Nag Hammadi and related sources over the past several years,I would like in this paper to offer for consideration a set of four proposi-tions: (1) Although “negative theology,” or at least an insistence on theunknowability of the highest God, is often assumed to be one of the essen-tial features of “gnostic” myth, this feature is in fact not ubiquitous amongthe myths normally viewed as “gnostic.” And the number of such sourcesin which one encounters any significant amount of negative theologicaldiscourse is relatively limited. (2) In those sources in which we do findextended passages with negative theological discourse we also tend to findthis language formulated with discernible patterns and structures thatimply some interest in the usefulness of rational argument. Thus, contraryto the notion that “gnostic” revelation typically entailed a despair and abandonment of rationality and that negative theology was the ultimate1R. T. Wallis, “The Spiritual Importance of Not Knowing,” in Classical Mediter-ranean Spirituality: Egyptian, Greek, Roman(ed. A. H. Armstrong; New York:Crossroad, 1986), 468 and 461."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"expression of this, it seems to be precisely in the sources where negativetheology is most exploited that we can make the best case for the adapta-tion of philosophical argument. (3) In the analysis of the role of negativetheology in these mythic sources, it is necessary not to restrict the focustoo narrowly on the negation itself, the insistence on the absoluteunknowability of God. Paradoxically, the exercise of negation is an impor-tant part, but only one part, of what is often a much larger more multifac-eted experience of “knowing God” that is attested in these myths. (4) Inparticular, narrow emphasis on formulas of negation in such myths has fre-quently been one of the key building blocks in the characterization of analleged “gnostic” worldview as so “anticosmic” that it could find no helpfrom the visible cosmos in the quest for knowledge of the divine. By con-trast, I will argue that exactly the sources with the most prominent exam-ples of negative theology turn out also to provide some of the bestevidence for appeals to forms of cosmological argument.Recently I have argued at some length that the very category “Gnosti-cism” is no longer serving us well as a tool for analysis.2In most of its con-structions, it tends to suffer from a vagueness that has prevented realconsensus about its meaning and application (i.e., there are too manycases where we seem not to be able to reach agreement about whether asource is to be classified in this category). And in any event, the categorytends to be constructed out of clichés that too often turn out to be mis-representing many of the supposedly “gnostic” sources. “Anticosmism” isone of the most common of such clichés, and, I have become more andmore certain, it is one of the least enlightening and most problematic. Ihope to have included in what follows some further illustration of why thisverdict is justified.The title of this paper self-consciously avoids the category “Gnosticism”and mentions instead a general classification, “demiurgical myths.” I use theterm “demiurgical myth” to mean simply a myth in which a distinction ismade between the highest God or ultimate principle and the entity or enti-ties to whom are ascribed the initiative and responsibility for the fashioningof the material cosmos. As a matter of fact, this definition would includemost of the myths conventionally classified under “Gnosticism.” But thereare also other writers or traditions, such as philosophers like Numenius orAlcinous, who present at least “demiurgical” doctrines, even if they are notalways framed in the form of more elaborate mythic narratives.3278Michael A.

What do we findout about demiurgical myths and negative theology?2. Absence/Presence of Negative Theological DiscourseThe first thing we note is that not all demiurgical myths seem to havea negative theology. A writing such as the Nag Hammadi Apocalypse ofAdam,for example, contains a demiurgical myth in which Adam and Eveare created by a lesser god,4and the author speaks fairly matter-of-factlyabout the higher, “eternal” or “living God,” or “God of truth.” While knowl-edge of the latter was lost by Adam and Eve (Apoc. Adam65,10–11), it isrestored by means of later revelations all down through history. In this text,the true God is not wrapped in alpha privatives, and the myth is not aboutGod’s unknowability or incomprehensibility. To the contrary, the writingspeaks straightforwardly of the importance of having true knowledge ofthis God.5I mention an example such as this because precisely in discussions ofthe theme of divine transcendence or negative theology in late antiquesources one can encounter generalizations such as: “The doctrine of theunknowability of God represents also a fundamental feature of the theol-ogy of Gnosticism.”6These days, the demiurgical myth in the Apocalypseof Adamis always counted as an important representative of this category“Gnosticism,” and yet it hardly supports the assertion just quoted. Indeed,it would be fairly easy to produce a relatively long list of sources from NagHammadi and heresiological accounts of sectarian mythologies in whichthere is no, or relatively little, actual use of negative theological labels ordiscourse. Admittedly, this absence in many instances may be a mislead-ing silence, more a factor of an author’s specific purposes at the momentthan an indication of no interest at all in such discourse. But it is worthkeeping in mind the fact that there is actually a rather limited number ofNegative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity279trans.,Alcinous: The Handbook of Platonism(Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York:Oxford University Press, 1993).4Apoc. Adam64,17–19, etc.; called “God almighty” (e.g., 69,4), or “Sakla” (e.g.,74,3), or “God of the powers” (e.g., 77,4–5).5Apoc. Adam64,13; 65,10–11; 72,14; 82,21–23; 83,11–21; 84,10; 85,15.6S.

Christian teacher Basilides. This source allegesBasilides to have taught a supreme God who was absolutely beyond anyname or description whatsoever, a “non-existent God” prior to being itself(Hippolytus, Ref.7.20.2–21.4). In his summaries of teachings of ValentinianChristians, Irenaeus of Lyons refers to their use of negative theological lan-guage (e.g., Haer.1.1.1), though certainly not a usage with the panacheencountered in the doctrine ascribed to Basilides.The discoveries of sources such as the Berlin Codex 8502 and the NagHammadi codices have provided a few important new examples of nega-tive theology among demiurgical myths. The texts containing the mostelaborate articulations of negative theology are: the Apocryphon of John;the Letter of Eugnostos(and a text that is likely dependent on it, the Sophiaof Jesus Christ); Allogenes,and probably also the tractate Zostrianos(though the relevant passages in the latter are quite fragmentary); and theTripartite Tractate.There are significant instances of negative theologicaljargon in other tractates as well, though the works just mentioned standout by their inclusion of extended sections devoted to this topic. As Roelofvan den Broek has commented, some of them contain “descriptions of theineffable God which in length and elaborateness surpass all those knownfrom Platonic or orthodox-Christian sources.”73. Negative Theologies: PatternsAmong the demiurgical myths that do contain negative theological dis-course in significant quantity, research has now demonstrated that weshould be cautious not to mistake these instances as merely a kind of hap-hazard potluck of mystical-sounding or “numinous” jargon. Though thereis increasing awareness of this among scholars, it is an important fact thathas not always been appreciated: In an article several years ago, WilliamSchoedel presented a convincing and important argument about monisticimplications underlying the use in certain “gnostic” sources of a specificformula of “topological” theology—God as “containing” while being“uncontained.” In developing his argument, Schoedel at one point justifi-ably contrasted the formula as strictly defined with other uses of the label“uncontained” (ajcwvrhto\"), where it appears without the other half of theformula (“containing”), as one term in a list of negative theological 280Michael A. Williams7R. van den Broek, Studies in Gnosticism and Alexandrian Christianity(NHMS39; Leiden: Brill, 1996), 43–44."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"attributes. Then as an aside he added: “The language of negative theologyin a Gnostic setting is ‘numinous’ language. The wonder of God’s being ismagnified without specific reference to precise theological formulation.”8Now although this generalization probably does express what has been awidely held impression, it can no longer be defended. For contrary to theimplication of such an assertion, we will see that some of the most exten-sive examples of negative theology among these sources actually seem todisplay some care in their employment of negations.I quote one further example illustrating how this has not always beenunderstood, this time from comments by the late Hans Jonas on the veryimportant instance of negative theology in the opening sections of theApocryphon of John:Like all gnostic speculation, the revelation of the Apocryphon (the reve-latory stage first having been set) starts with a dissertation on the ultra-transcendent First Principle; and here we meet with the kind of emphaticand pathetic verbosity which the “ineffable” seems to have incited inmany of its professors: the over four pages of effusive description devotedto the very indescribability of the divine Absolute—expatiating on thetheme of His purity, boundlessness, perfection, etc., being beyond meas-ure, quality, quantity, and time; beyond comprehension, description,name, distinction; beyond life, beatitude, divinity, and even existence—are a typical example of the rising “negative theology,” whose spokesmendid not tire for centuries of the self-defeating nature of their task. Justlymore reticent, the Valentinians contented themselves on this point with afew telling symbols (as “Abyss”, “Silence”).9Now in a section of his forthcoming book on the Apocryphon of John,Michael Waldstein has forcefully demonstrated how inadequate is such a char-acterization of the negative theological discourse in the Apocryphon of Johnasmere “pathetic verbosity” and “effusive description.”10Rather, Waldstein con-tends that the long passage about the Invisible Spirit in Ap. JohnII 2,26–4,18(= BG 22,17–26,14) is “a disciplined piece of writing which develops not onlyNegative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity2818W. R.

I give here only outlines of some of Waldstein’s analysis:12After a brief opening list of attributes of the Invisible Spirit (BG 22,17–23,3 = II 2,26–32) there is a first series of assertions, each followed by asupporting clause introduced by gavr, “for” (BG 23,3–14 = II 2,33–3,7):It is not right to think of him as God. . .for he is more than God,(He is) a principality [ajrchv] over which nothing rules [a[rcei],for there is nothing prior to him;Nor does he need them: he does not need life,for he is eternal;He does not need anything,for he cannot be completed as if he were lacking so as to be completed,but rather he is always entirely complete.After this is a series of seven negations (II 3,7–15 par.), all but one sup-ported by a clause introduced, not by gavr, but by the Coptic ebol JeorJe, “since” (= Greek o{ti?). Rather than a full translation, I provide asomewhat more skeletal rendering that brings into relief the structure:Illimitablesince no one prior to him to limit himUnexaminablesince no one prior to him to examine himImmeasurablesince no one prior to him to measure himInvisiblesince no one has seen himEternalexisting foreverIneffablesince no one comprehended him to speak about himUnnamablesince no one prior to him to name himWaldstein points out that a via negationisargument with a similar structureand “rhythmical application of negation” is found in Aristides.13The next282Michael A.

Andfinally, still a further clear pattern is found in II 4,3–10 par., where severalpositive attributes are applied to the Invisible Spirit, but in such a way asto underscore that the Invisible Spirit is sourceof all such things (onceagain, in a more skeletal rendering):Eternalthe one who supplies eternityLightthe one who supplies lightLifethe one who supplies lifeBlessedthe one who supplies blessednessKnowledgethe one who supplies knowledgeGoodthe one who supplies goodMercythe one who supplies mercyGracethe one who supplies graceThe famous section of negative theology in Alcinous Did.10.3–4 containsthe same kind of argument about attributes of the “First God.” The latter canbe said to be the Good (ajgaqovn) since “he is the source [ai[tio\"] of all good”;he is Truth (ajlhvqeia) since he is the origin (ajrchv) of every truth (10.3).I have outlined only a few key elements of Waldstein’s analysis here,but his discussion presents a splendid case for treating the account of theInvisible Spirit in the Apocryphon of Johnas something much more thanmerely “numinous” language without any very precise theological formu-lation. What might seem at first glance to the reader to be a ramblingstream of “pathetic verbosity” actually does have a structure and a certainlevel of precision in argumentation.Perhaps part of the reason underlying dismissive characterizations suchas that quoted from Jonas is that earlier generations of scholarship had beenmore inclined to view even some of the corresponding passages from more“professional” Middle Platonic figures, like that in Alcinous Did.10, as the-ologically incoherent. For on the one hand, God is described by disallow-ing the validity of any predication whatsoever, while in virtually the nextbreath positive attributes are applied. Jaap Mansfeld has addressed thisproblem of how via negationis, via eminentiae,and via analogiaeargu-mentation can seemingly coexist in a kind of “peaceful jumble.”14He arguesNegative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity28314J. Mansfeld, “Compatible Alternatives: Middle Platonist Theology and theXenophanes Reception,” in Knowledge of God in the Graeco-Roman World(ed. R.van den Broek, T. Baarda and J. Mansfeld; EPRO 112; Leiden: Brill, 1988), 92."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"that such writers viewed these as “alternative modes of cognition, compat-ible albeit of unequal value.” Alcinous, observes Mansfeld, “is most consci-entious in informing us about the three modes of cognition; other survivingMiddle Platonist authors seem to take them for granted and provide us witha clutter of epithets without being very clear about the justification for theirprocedure, although hints are occasionally provided.”15And it is perhapsjust such hints that we find through a close analysis of the structure of thedescription of the Invisible Spirit in the Apocryphon of John.Both Eugnostosand the Tripartite Tractatealso manifest in their sec-tions that describe the highest God features that indicate some amount ofcare in the structure of the argument (EugnostosIII 71,13–73,3; Tri. Trac.51,8–55,26).16Roelof van den Broek17has pointed out that much of therelevant section in Eugnostosmay be analyzed as a series of four argu-ments, each with three parts. EugnostosIII 71,18–72,13:He is immortal, eternal,(1) Having no birth,(2) for everyone who has birth will perish;(3) he is unbegotten;(1) Having no beginning[ajrchv],(2) for everyone who has a beginning has an end;(3) nothing rules [a[rcei] over him.18(1) Having no name,(2) for whoever has a name is the creature of another;(3) he is unnamable;(1) He has no human form,(2) for whoever has human form is the creation of another;(3) he has his own form, not like the form that we havereceived or seen, but a strange form that surpasses all thingsand is better than the totalities. It looks to every side andsees itself from itself.284Michael A.

Negative Theologies and Knowledge of GodI mentioned above that the demiurgical myth in the Apocalypse ofAdamlacks any negative theological discourse and contains straightforwardreferences to the possibility of having knowledge of the God of Truth. Buteven the presence of significant negative theology does not always rule outa strong emphasis on seeking after knowledge of the Unknowable.Some of the most striking examples of this are to be found in forms ofValentinian Christian myth. There is first of all the classic account that Ire-naeus provides of the mythology of the Valentinian teacher Ptolemy (Ire-naeus Haer.1.1.1–8.5). In this myth, the aeon Wisdom longs tocomprehend the incomprehensible Father. This is referred to as “an impos-sible effort” (1.2.2), and of course the passion produced in this futileattempt resulted in the series of events leading to the material creation.However, even though it might be true to say that according to this myth,“[e]vil originates in the desire of Sophia (Wisdom) to comprehend theFather,”24that is not quite the same as saying that the desire to know theFather is evil.Indeed, in Ptolemy’s myth a wish to know the Father seems to beshared by allof the aeons in the realm of Perfection (1.2.1), not just Wis-dom. Among the aeons, Only-Begotten Mind (Nous) alone was actuallyable to behold and know the Father, yet even Mind wishedto share knowl-edge with all the rest of the aeons. Interestingly, the knowledge that Mindwished to share with the others is described as essentially negative knowl-edge: that the Father is without beginning, incomprehensible, and invisi-ble. But by the Father’s will, Mind was constrained by Silence fromconveying any knowledge about the Father, and this left the remainingaeons still wishing for such (1.2.1). In other words, the highest God maybe incomprehensible and ineffable, but seeking afterknowledge of God isportrayed here as the most prominent and “natural” instinct among theaeons in the realm of divine Perfection.Moreover, the course of Ptolemy’s myth as a whole conveys the mes-sage that the Unknowable wishesto be known, though only through aknowledge mediated by Only-Begotten Mind (1.2.1; 1.2.5). The veryrestraint of Mind by Silence seems to lead to Wisdom’s attempt at com-prehension. The latter does eventually have as part of its “fallout” the evilsof the material realm. However, the process as a whole results, by divineprovidence, in the fullest possible distribution and attainment of knowl-edge of God.The Tripartite Tractateis an example of a form of Valentinian myth thatcontains a very elaborate development of negative theological discourse,Negative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity28724Wallis, “Spiritual Importance,” 468."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"and yet somewhat paradoxically stresses that the unknowable Father wantsvery much to be known.

And the remainder of the myth in this text reveals that this isprecisely the Father’s will. But this revelation is a gradual process, since theFather is so great that a sudden revelation would have overloaded the cir-cuits, so to speak (64,28–37). The revelation is also not direct but medi-ated, through the Son, who is the “trace” (i[cno\") of the Father (66,3) andis all of the Father’s names,25the form of the formless,the body of the incorporeal,the face of the invisible, the expression of the ineffable,the mind of the inconceivable....(66,13–17)This self-revelation, we are told, is intended to inspire a constant search-ing after the Father, even though the Father’s primordial essence isunsearchable (71,15–20).26Thus, it is by the will of the Father that theFather is known, because he breathes a spirit into all things that creates inthem the idea of seeking after the Unknowable, so that they are drawn tohim as if by a sweet aroma (71,35–73,8).The Wisdom figure in the Tripartite Tractateis the Logos, and like Wis-dom in Ptolemy’s myth, the Logos here attempts in vain to comprehendthe incomprehensibility of the Father (75,17–19). But once again what Iwant to emphasize here is that the myth portrays this questfor knowledgeas something good or well-intentioned (76,2–4), even though the futility ofthe Logos’s attempt leads to defects and consequences that must bebrought under control through the creation of the cosmos. But even all ofthese consequences, according to the author, happened completely inaccordance with the will of the Father (76,13–77,11). The Logos’s initialeffort is a kind of necessary, programmed failure.Not only is there a paradoxical relationship here between an elabo-rate negative theology that insists that the Father is completely beyond288Michael A. Williams25On this, see Thomassen and Painchaud, Le Traité Tripartite,307–10.26The passage possibly assumes a “distinction between knowledge of theFather’s existence and knowledge of his essence” (Attridge, Nag Hammadi CodexI,2:285)."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"imagining and a message of revelation that declares that the Father wantsall things to seek after knowledge of him. It is also the case that this par-adoxical tension appears to be quite integral to the theology here, andmore specifically, it is integral to the theodicy. For the dynamics of themyth in this form of Valentinian speculation render precisely the highestvalues, love for and knowledge of God, as the unintentional sources ofevil. The very aspiration that triggers the problem is at the same time aquest for that which is most highly valued. To appreciate the uniquedynamic here, we might contrast this with a myth such as that offered byOrigen of Alexandria. In Origen’s theology, the source of evil is traced tothe gradual turning away of rational souls from concentration on God, aversion of the Platonic notion of evil-as-absence. Now the Tripartite Trac-tate(and Ptolemy, according to Irenaeus) handled the same basic Platonicnotion in a different way. The Logos (or Wisdom) does not really turn awayfrom God, but towardGod—in an intense but futile reachingafter God. The “absence” that becomes evil here is the failure of a well-intentioned effort, unlike Origen’s “sinning” souls, who cannot be said tohave been well intentioned.Now the particular dynamic I have just mentioned, where the originsof evil are, ironically, linked as intimately as possible to laudable aspira-tions for divine knowledge, is certainly not present in all demiurgicalmyths, and in fact, it may have been limited to certain forms of Valentin-ian speculation.27A somewhat analogous motif is found in the myth thatHippolytus ascribes to Justin “the pseudo-gnostic,” though this myth asnarrative is entirely different from the myth in the Tripartite TractateorPtolemy. Justin’s myth has evil originate when the creator, Elohim, aspiresto discovery of realities more transcendent than himself and in so doingascends to “the Good,” at the same time abandoning his previously con-tracted marriage relationship to Eden (Hippolytus Ref.5.26.21). Elohim’sactions become paradigmatic for the human initiate, but his ascent is boththe highest good and the cause of evil. Once again, while searching afterknowledge of the highest God is the central value, it is also offered up asthe solution to problems of theodicy. However, Justin’s myth containsnothing like the elaborate negative theology found in the Tripartite Trac-tate,and therefore knowledge of “the Good” is not portrayed in the sameway as epistemologically problematic or paradoxical.Even though sources such as the Apocryphon of Johnor EugnostosorAllogenesdo not seem to capitalize on this theodicy-related potential in theparadoxical relationship between elaborate negative theological assertionsand the search for knowledge of God, their myths do in other waysembody tensions entailed in placing a premium on seeking knowledge ofNegative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity28927Cf. Thomassen and Painchaud, Le Traité Tripartite,329."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"the Unknowable. One dimension of this involves sharply paradoxical for-mulations concerned with the mystical, “peak” experience. Many othershave commented on the way the author of the tractate Allogenes,for exam-ple, distills the ultimate experience of knowledge of the Unknowable inthe terminology of “not-knowing knowledge” or an “ignorance that sees”(e.g., Allogenes59,28–32; 60,8–12; 61,1–2; 64,10–14), and the author mayhave been among the earliest experimenters with this kind of formulationin the history of Western mysticism.28However, there is another type of tension that I am more interested inexploring here, and that is the larger and somewhat more implicit onebetween, on the one hand, the assertion of divine unknowability and, onthe other, the assumption that knowledge about the divine can be gainedfrom the visible cosmos.5. Negative Theologies and Sensibility about the CosmosThe classic study by A.-J. Festugière, La révélation d’Hermès Tris-mégiste,distinguished two broad currents among religious and philosoph-ical traditions in late antiquity, according to how the supreme Being wasimagined: a type in which God’s nature could be known in some measurethrough observation and contemplation of the visible cosmos, and a typein which God was understood to be hyper-cosmic, beyond any analogy inthe visible world—i.e., the sort of God described in the more enthusiasti-cally negative theologies. As Festugière put it, in the latter case knowledgeof God is not aided by the visible world, “because it is a matter of reach-ing a Principle of which nothing here below offers an image, since It is, inessence, different from everything else.”29Thus, the only way for such aGod to be known is by means of revelation.Now it has become commonplace that one of the ways in which “gnos-tic” negative theology is distinguished from “nongnostic” Jewish, Christian,or Platonist negative theologies in antiquity is by asserting that for “gnos-tics” the description-by-negation somehow went hand in hand with a com-plete absence of any faith in rational paths to knowledge or any sensibilityfor the material cosmic realm as revelatory of divine truth. As van den Broekhas put it recently, in an introductory chapter to a collection of his essays:At first sight, the gnostic and hermetic doctrines of God have much incommon, since both start from a theological concept which was wide-290Michael A. Williams28See Turner, “Gnosticism and Platonism,” 448; King, Revelation,19, 148–52,169; Wallis, “Spiritual Importance,” 470.29Festugière, La révélation d’Hermès Trismégiste(4 vols.; Paris: Librairie Lecof-fre, 1949–1954), 4:59."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"spread in the classical world. It is the idea that God is so transcendent thathe can only be described in the terms of what we call “negative theol-ogy:” he is ineffable, invisible, incomprehensible, unbegotten, withoutbeginning and without end, incorruptible, immeasurable, invariable,unnamable, etc. This view is found among pagan philosophers, Christiantheologians, gnostics and hermetists. There is a difference, however, forthe philosophers, and some early Christian theologians as well, said that,though it may be true that God is unknowable in his essence, he can nev-ertheless be comprehended by the human mind (nous), through philo-sophical reasoning and through contemplation of the cosmic order. Thisemphasis on the human nousas a useful, though imperfect, instrumentfor the knowledge of God is also found in the hermetic texts, but neverin those of the gnostics: in their view, the supreme God was inaccessibleto the human mind. However, like the platonic philosophers of their time,the gnostics felt no difficulty in combining this negative theology withpositive qualifications of the ineffable God.30Werner Foerster’s introductory comments in his anthology of “gnostic”texts contain another good illustration of this common perception of theimplications of negative theology in these myths. He notes that God inthese traditions is “the unknown Father” and that frequently there is theattempt “to describe this unknown God with an array of negative expres-sions,” or with the prefix “fore-” (Fore-Father, etc.), so that “all that can besaid is simply this, that it lies before all that is visible and conceivable.”“So,” continues Foester, “God and the world stand apart and in opposi-tion.”31Similarly, in his general treatment of Gnosis: The Nature and His-tory of Gnosticism,Kurt Rudolph includes a section on “the unknownGod,” in which he covers, among others, the negative theologies ofBasilides, the Apocryphon of John, Eugnostos,and the Tripartite Tractate.Rudolph then concludes:These examples, which could be extended without difficulty . . . show thatthe gnostic conception of God is dictated by a contrast to all previouslyexisting conceptions and so has a thoroughly revolutionary character. Cer-tainly the terminology is indebted to contemporary philosophy; also it ispossible to note certain agreements in cosmology (Plotinus knew that verywell), but the underlying world-denying tone cannot be mistaken.32Negative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity29130Van den Broek, Studies,10.31W.

(2) On the other hand, we have also observedthat in most of the sources that do contain extensive negative theologicaldiscourse such language is not being employed haphazardly, but in patternsthat may be understood as forms of rational argumentation. In other words,even though the invocation of via negationisor via eminentiaeargumentsin these demiurgical myths comes in the medium of a revelation, it seemsfair to ask why the possibility of an openness to a role also for human intel-lection should be dismissed in thesecases, any more than when such argu-ments are invoked in authors like, say, Gregory of Nazianzus.33(3) Andfinally, it is noteworthy that just those “gnostic” sources that contain themost remarkable instances of extended negative theological discourse hap-pen also to be among the very sources where arguably the most positive—notmost negative—relationship is depicted between true divinity and thematerial cosmos. This is exactly opposite from the general impressionsometimes conveyed by treatments of “Gnosticism,” to the effect that “gnos-tic” negative theology is simply the ultimate expression of “gnostic” world-denial. I need to elaborate on this latter point.For example, it has long been recognized that the Tripartite Tractateis among the examples of Christian demiurgical myth with the least evi-dence for animosity toward the demiurge or the material cosmos. Thearchon who is assigned the role of “beautifying”34and “working on” thethings below is used “as a hand” by the Logos, to effect the divine pur-poses (Tri. Trac.100,30–36). Because the creative activity of this lowerdemiurge is being guided, without his awareness, by inspiration from thedivine spirit, the things that come into being from this agent are in the292Michael A. Williams33Gregory can speak at great length of the deep mystery of God’s essence thatis impossible for human reason to comprehend and within the same oration alsodiscourse on theological implications humans should see in the marvels of the vis-ible cosmos (Theological Oration2 [Orat.28]).34I follow Attridge (Nag Hammadi Codex I,1:275) in using this translation ofthe Coptic tsaeiw, which could be a translation of some form of the Greek kos-mei'n, which of course has connotations both of ordering and adornment, withorder being a form of beauty.

This notion that the lowerdemiurge is unwittingly operating under divine guidance from above is notunique to this tractate but is found elsewhere in Valentinian myth.35I wishto underscore its presence because the obvious implication is that thephysical creation is understood in such traditions as containing images andsigns of divine realities.Indeed, Irenaeus does apparently indicate that in support of theirviews his Valentinian Christian opponents would often appeal to this cor-respondence between patterns in the pleromatic realm and patterns in thevisible cosmos. He says at one point (Haer.2.15.3) that when he engagedthem in conversation they would question him as though he knew noth-ing about the creation. But when he, in turn, pressed them about detailsconcerning theirnotions about the transcendent realm, or Pleroma, theywould rely either on metaphors involving human emotions or on languagepertaining only to “that harmony that can be observed in creation.” Ire-naeus thinks he has them cornered here, since they must resort to discus-sions of patterns in secondary realities in order to explain their theoriesabout the Pleroma. But for our purposes, the passage is enormously reveal-ing, for what it tells us is that Valentinian Christians appealed to cosmo-logical arguments in support of their transcendental theology.The writing Eugnostosis another familiar example of a myth in whichany anticosmism is less obvious.36I have mentioned earlier some of Roelofvan den Broek’s insightful analyses of patterns in the negative theology inEugnostos.However, the way in which he frames those insights withrespect to the “gnostic” character of Eugnostosillustrates how that categoryhas become encumbered with presuppositions that may often obscurewhat is actually in the text. In the opening section of Eugnostosthe authorstates that:Everyone born since the foundation of the world turns to dust. Thoughthey seek after God—who he is and what he is like—they have not foundhim. Many of the wise among them have made likenesses of the truthNegative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity29335E.g., Irenaeus Haer.1.5.1; and see the numerous parallels cited in the com-mentary sections in Attridige, Nag Hammadi Codex I,and Thomassen and Pain-chaud, Le Traité Tripartite.36So much so that there has been debate as to whether the work should be clas-sified as “gnostic.” See, e.g., D.

For the management is described in three waysby all the philosophers, so that the three accounts are in conflict....(III70,3–16)The author then summarizes and rejects the three different theories: thatthe cosmos simply operates under its own direction, that it is guided byprovidence, or that it is ruled by fate (III 70,16–71,5). In the remainder ofthe work the author claims to be presenting the reader with the truth aboutGod. Now based on the parallels in their negative theological discoursethat I mentioned earlier, van den Broek suggests that both Eugnostosandthe Christian apologist Aristidesmade use of a source which, in the traditional way, inferred from theorderly government of the universe that its Maker and Mover must beGod, but at the same time asserted that, though we can see God’s worksit is impossible to know his nature, and then went on to develop anexplicitly negative theology based on the opposition between the unbe-gotten and the begotten. Their dependence on a common source explainsthe correspondences between Eugnostos and Aristides. The differencesbetween them can be explained by Eugnostos’ gnostic world-view, whichforced him to reject the cosmological proof of God’s existence with argu-ments developed in the Sceptical tradition.37Commenting specifically on the reference to argument from dioivkhsi\"thatI quoted above, van den Broek asserts thatEugnostos starts his argument by referring to and then firmly rejecting theidea that God’s existence and nature can be known from the dioikêsisofthe cosmos. Though he does not explicitly say so, we may assume thathe had to reject this view because, as a gnostic, he ascribed the origin ofthe world to a lower, most probably evil demiurge.38Now the problem here is twofold: First, we really do notknow preciselythe shape of Eugnostos’s teaching about the demiurge. I would agree withvan den Broek that the overall nature of the myth in this writing does makeit probable that the author “ascribed the origin of the world to a lower . . .demiurge” and that therefore we likely have a demiurgical myth. But thereis no justification for assuming that this demiurge is “most probably evil.”Secondly, it is not in fact clear that the author of Eugnostosis rejecting theproposition that the dioivkhsi\"of the cosmos has relevance for discerning294Michael A. Williams37Van den Broek, “Eugnostos and Aristides,” 211.38Ibid., 209."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"the nature of God. What are rejected are three conflicting philosophicalpositions derivedfrom such analogical argumentation. And in fact, later inthe work the author seems to appeal precisely to cosmological argumentin support of the truth of the assertions in the myth. After the negativetheology in III 71,13–73,3 that I have discussed earlier, the author empha-sizes the importance of understanding the distinction between the invisi-ble and the visible, the imperishable and the perishable (III 73,3–74,7).Then the author says that if anyone wishes to trust the information setforth in the myth, that person should “search from what is hidden to thecompletion of what is visible, and this thought [e[nnoia] will teach him howbelief in invisible things has been discovered from what is visible. It [= thebelief] is a source of knowledge” (III 74,14–20). The remainder of Eug-nostosdoes just this. Beginning with the highest God who had beendescribed in the negative theological discourse, the author traces the var-ious levels of emanation down just to the point of the appearance of thevisible cosmos. Thus this author, like the Valentinian traditions discussedabove, assumes a congruence between the ordering of the visible cosmosand the supernal, invisible realities.39The author probably does reject thesufficiency of human reasoning alone in attaining the truth, and the authorcertainly asserts that the true nature of the highest divine source is beyondthe grasp of human intellect. However, that does not rule out any role atall for intellection, as is indicated by the author’s appeal to e[nnoia,“thought.”40Nor in particular does revelation exclude a place for cosmo-logical argument in gaining assurance concerning the truth about theNegative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity29539See also J. Dillon, “Pleromaand Noetic Cosmos: A Comparative Study,” inNeoplatonism and Gnosticism(ed. R. T. Wallis and J. Bregman; Studies in Neopla-tonism: Ancient and Modern 6; Albany: SUNY Press, 1992), 107, who notes thatEugnostos“envisages quite an extensive parallelism between the noetic and phys-ical worlds,” although Dillon wonders “how coherent a theory of archetypes theGnostic writers had.” But, just as with any other writers from antiquity, that ques-tion should be considered on a case-by-case basis. P. Perkins, “Beauty, Number,and Loss of Order in the Gnostic Cosmos,” in ibid., 285, rightly notes that Eugnos-tos“apparently proposes some form of contemplation of heavenly order as a keyto the knowledge of the divine received by the Gnostics.”40Parrott, “Eugnostos,” 161–62, feels compelled to take this “thought” as a ref-erence to an aspect of the highest God who functions essentially as a revelatorybeing, “communicating with those who are open to it,” rather than as a contem-plative exercise in thought invited by the author. But I see nothing that requiressuch a reading of ennoiaas a hypostasized being here. Trakatellis, The Tran-scendent God,37, makes a similar mistake, in my view, in emphasizing that theprologue to Eugnostos“constitutes a radical rejection of the possibility to gaineven a partial knowledge of God, either through the thinking processes orthrough research.”"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"divine realm. In fact, the author seems to view as fundamentally impor-tant that the reader think through the implications of correspondencesbetween visible and invisible realms.Now the Apocryphon of Johnunquestionably presents a much morenegative portrait of the creator, Ialdabaoth. However, even in this work wefind evidence that the material cosmos itself is not understood to be arepulsively grotesque and chaotic environment completely alien to, andunrevealing of, the nature of true divinity. For with respect to the creationof the earth and all the various heavens, the author says that Ialdabaothput everything in order, in the likeness of the first aeons that had comeinto being, so as to create them in an incorruptible pattern—not that hehimself had actually seen the incorruptible things; rather, it was the powerwithin him (that did so), which he had received from his Mother, sinceshe had begotten within him the likeness of the cosmos. (II 12,34–13,5)The short recension does not mention the role of the Mother here, butit does state that the arrangement of the various firmaments, heavens,and aeons in the created realm corresponds to the image and pattern(tuvpo\") of the transcendent, incorruptible aeons (BG 44,5–9).41Theremust be a sensibility here to a level of order in the visible world thatresults from a corresponding beauty and order in the transcendentdivine realm. Something about the structure of divinity can be observedin the visible cosmos, though a full understanding of the nature of therelationship depends on further revelation—as it did for many Jewishand Christian authors.42296Michael A. Williams41Waldstein has noted this passage (Apocryphon of John,169) and rightlystresses the presence in Apocryphon of Johnof what can be called a form of “cos-mic piety” (165–68).42In comparing Platonic notions of an intelligible, paradigmatic realm with“gnostic” notions of the Pleroma, Dillon has commented that “there are elementsin the Pleroma, in both Valentinian and Sethian systems . . . which do seem to serveas paradigms” (“Pleromaand Noetic Cosmos,” 106). However, the similaritiesshould probably be pushed even further than Dillon mentions. For he suggests thatone might object that: “the Pleroma is not really a model on which the physicalworld is based. The physical world is an error and an abortion for the Gnostics,and the Demiurge receives little or no guidance from above in creating it, nor hashe access to the Pleroma as a model to work with” (106). Dillon cites the teach-ings of Marcus (Irenaeus Haer.1.17.2) as an exception to this general rule (109 n.15). Yet certainly the Apocryphon of John,the Tripartite Tractate,and Ptolemy areother examples, and it may well be that this sense of a correspondence betweenorder and beauty in the material cosmos and order and beauty in the aeonic realmwas not uncommon among other demiurgical traditions."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Finally, we may comment about this matter with respect to texts suchas Allogenesand Zostrianosand the opponents of Plotinus whom the lat-ter criticizes in Enn.2.9. As I have mentioned, Allogenescontains somevery striking negative theology, culminating in the affirmation that theUnknowable is so transcendent that it can actually only be “known”through a form of “unknowing.” On the other hand, it is harder to saymuch about the nature of the relation between negative theology and cos-mology in this case, since the writing (at least what survives of it) containsso little direct mention of the material realm. But the few passages that doseem to be pertinent indicate a less dualistic worldview than is oftenassumed for “Gnosticism.”43The Unknowable is the “source” (phghv) foreverything else, being related to things like matter, number, form, andshape only as immaterial matter, numberless number, shapeless shape, etc.(Allogenes48,21–32).44The related tractate Zostrianos,though also frus-tratingly fragmentary, contains more direct allusions to the relationbetween the transcendent realms and the material cosmos. Several pas-sages seem to refer to the presence in certain levels of the transcendentrealm of archetypal patterns for realities in the visible world—not only ofpeople, but of the elements earth, water, air, and fire, and also of animals,trees, fruit, even weeds!45As John Dillon has commented, “What we seemto have portrayed here is a comprehensive archetype of the physicalworld, right down to the tares among the wheat.”46The acquaintances whom Plotinus criticizes in Enn.2.9 seem to haveused writings such as Allogenesand Zostrianos,and we may thus assumethat they had some fondness for the negative theological discourse in suchtexts. The controversy between Plotinus and these opponents is often imag-ined to have involved sharply different positions about the role of cosmicpiety in contemplation of the intelligible and supraintelligible, and certainlyit is true that Plotinus himself understood the difference partly in these terms.Negative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity29743See Schoedel, “‘Topological’ Theology,” 108; King, Revelation,11, 105; B.Pearson, Gnosticism, Judaism, and Egyptian Christianity(SAC 5; Minneapolis:Fortress, 1990), 163.44See King, Revelation,97. K. Corrigan, “The Anonymous Turin Commentary onthe Parmenides,” 57 (seminar paper that appears in this volume in revised form as:“Platonism and Gnosticism. The Anonymous Commentaryon the Parmenides:Middle or Neoplatonic?”) has suggested that both Allogenesand the Tripartite Trac-taterepresent a “Speusippan-Stoic view of the origin of life (although in an ambigu-ous and probably much mitigated form),” so that the “embryonic dynamisof allfuture creation indwells primordially in the depth” of the first principle. 45Zost.48,2–29; 55,15–25; 113,1–117,15.46Dillon, “Pleromaand Noetic Cosmos,” 104; cf.

But though thereclearly were differences between Plotinus and his opponents about the rela-tion between the material cosmic order and supramaterial reality, we shouldbe careful not to conclude too quickly that it was merely a matter of someblunt “gnostic” hatred of all matter and a lack of interest in, and even aninability to see any beauty in, the material realm. In fact, Plotinus himselfseems to admit that his opponents do not deny the beauty in the cosmos;they just refuse to grant it the kind of interpretation and importance that hedeems appropriate. He says that their arrogant sense of superiority is basedprecisely on their claim to have disdain for something they call “beautiful”—i.e., it would not have been so special to claim to despise something “ugly”(2.9.17.30–33). Thus it was not really an argument over whether there wasvisible beauty and order in the cosmos, but rather over the question of divin-ity in that beauty and order of the heavens and stars. Plotinus says that thesepeople assert their own souls to be immortal and divine but reject the notionthat the heavens and stars share that divinity, and they do so even thoughon the one hand they see the order and beautiful form and arrangement inthe heavens, while on the other they especially complain about the disorderhere on earth (2.9.5.8–14). Such an argument would not be so effective if itwere the case that these acquaintances of Plotinus somehow were denyingany beauty or order in the heavens.As a matter of fact, we do find what appears to be a positive exhorta-tion to the contemplation of cosmic order in at least one tractate from NagHammadi, Marsanes,which also happens to be closely related to workssuch as Allogenesand Zostrianos.Birger Pearson has pointed out howMarsanesspeaks of the salvation of the sense-perceptible world (Marsanes5,17–26), and Pearson notes that a positive evaluation is given to cosmiccontemplation on the fragmentary pages 41–42 of Marsanes:“Blessed is . . .whether he is gazing at the two (sun and moon) or is gazing at the sevenplanets or at the twelve signs of the Zodiac or the thirty-six Decans....”47Now Pearson is inclined to view such a passage as a deviation from “theusual gnostic attitude toward the heavenly bodies,” and he explains this asthe result of influence on Marsanesfrom Platonism. The presence of Pla-tonic influence is clear, though that is the case, at some level, with a greatmany “gnostic” sources. I would simply suggest that there may be no needto be labeling instances of openness to contemplation of the implicationsof cosmic order as exceptions or deviations from the “usual attitude” inthese demiurgical myths.298Michael A.

The focus of his opponents’ criti-cism was not on ugliness in the structure of the heavens or what we wouldcall the natural world, but rather on ugliness in the moral and social realm,the realm of motivations, attitudes, and relationships, and the field ofhuman fortunes. When Plotinus is most explicit about the complaints thatthese opponents have about the world, it is not about the ugliness of theheavens, but rather about social inequities such as wealth and poverty, theinjustices that befall individuals in the great sports arena of life where thereare winners and losers (2.9.9.1–28). Why is everyone not good and perfect;why is there evil (2.9.13.22–33)? They were concerned about disease, but inthis area they evidently did not merely complain about human misfortune.They actually cured diseases through exorcisms—experiencing them notmerely as “natural” calamities but as the work of demons with intentions(2.9.14.14–18). We can also see this concern with the issue of motivationsin the fact that, according to Plotinus, they said that the demiurge createdthe cosmos out of a desire to be honored (2.9.4.14; 2.9.11.22).In Enn.2.9.6.30–33, Plotinus remarks that by their introduction of plu-rality (multitude of names, etc.) into the intelligible order, his opponentsbring the intelligible nature into likeness with the perceptible and inferiorrealm. He naturally sees this as a flaw in their argument, since in his viewthis amounts to dragging supernal realities down to the level of inferiormodels. However, what for him is a flawed approach may be read by usas another confirmation that these opponents were using a form of cos-mological argument, extrapolating the nature of the wonderful levels of thetranscendent realm partly from features in the visible cosmos. Of course, ifwe take texts such as Allogenesor Zostrianosas windows on some of theirviews, their negative theology exalted the ultimate Source of all thingsbeyond the reach of such analogy. But the very nature of ascent visionssuch as those in Allogenesor Zostrianosseems to be that the “peak” expe-rience of proximity to the Unknowable is only a fragile moment in thelarger blissful experience of knowing divinity.6. Summary and ConclusionsI have argued here that much of the attention that has been given tothe presence of negative theology in demiurgical myths such as thosefound among Nag Hammadi and related sources has frequently misreadthe timbres, implications, and functions of such language. Most often thismisreading has been a function of larger assumptions about the values andworldviews expressed in such traditions—assumptions that, it seems tome, are becoming ever more difficult for us to entertain in light of the lastfew decades of scholarship on such materials. While relationships haveNegative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity299"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"long been recognized between negative theology encountered in suchdemiurgical myths and forms of negative theological discourse in otherancient sources such as Platonic philosophical literature or Christian the-ologians, these parallels tend to be routinely qualified in such a way thata peculiarly “gnostic” strain of negative theology is successfully isolated.“Gnosticism” has often been imagined as a form of piety that entails radi-cal negative theology virtually by definition. Moreover, “gnostic” negativetheology has been regarded as a key symptom of a general abandonmentof any confidence in rationality, as the unsystematic heaping up of numi-nous attributes. The rather steep elevation in negative theological discoursein some of these sources has typically been understood as an expressionof a singularly fierce sense of opposition between God and the cosmos,alleged to have been a defining characteristic of “Gnosticism.” There hasoften been the assumption that in “gnostic” sources negative theology andcosmological argument must stand in inverse proportion, so that there canhardly have been room left here for any positive sensibility about seeingimages of the divine in the beauty and order of the cosmos.I have argued that an analysis of negative theological discourse amongthe demiurgical myths conventionally classified as “gnostic” suggests thatmost all of the above assumptions are false. Significant use of negative the-ological discourse is limited to a certain selection of these sources. Whereit is found, in writings such as the Apocryphon of John, Eugnostos,the Tri-partite Tractate,or Allogenes,its employment is far from being completelyunsystematic, and in fact we find patterns and structures that reflectattempts to develop organized argument and presentation of theologicalposition. And, ironically, contrary to the notion that negative theology isthe quintessential expression of anticosmism, it would seem that thesources in which are found the most significant instances of negative the-ology are also among those where it is easiest to demonstrate more posi-tive sensibilities with respect to the material cosmos, and even theemployment of forms of cosmological argument.In a paper on “Negative Theology in Gnosticism and Neoplatonism,”Curtis Hancock primarily underscored the similarities between Plotinus and“gnostics” in the deployment of negative theological discourse. But he sug-gested that a notable difference was that “gnostics” often applied negationsomewhat “farther down the hierarchy of realities,” whereas Plotinus lim-ited it to the One.48There may be some validity in this contrast,49but in300Michael A.

The imaging of the divine, therefore, does not simply resultNegative Theologies and Demiurgical Myths in Late Antiquity301“extended much further down the metaphysical scale,” and Proclus imaginesdegrees of unknowability in the hierarchy of the transcendent (Wallis, “SpiritualImportance,” 475–76).50E.

But rather thanfocusing on the twofold typology that Wolfson has sketched out, I ammore interested in how elements of his discussion may help bring intorelief the relation in some of these demiurgical traditions between negativetheology and knowing God. It is a fundamental mistake, in Wolfson’s view,to think of the “real” mystical visionary experience as being some ineffa-ble moment, with all the imagery encountered in descriptions of it beingrelegated to the status of nonessential and replaceable commentary. Heinsists that we pay more attention to how integral the agency of imagina-tion can be even in the experience of what is often claimed by mystics tobe unimaginable.In a similar vein, I would argue that it is a mistake in the case of thesources I have discussed here to place narrow emphasis on negationsstressing the ultimate unknowability of God or to focus only on a sharppolar tension between the abstract affirmation of the true God’s absoluteincomprehensibility and a consequent total dependence on some criticalmoment of divine revelation. It seems to me that an inclination toward thiskind of reading of the significance of negative theology has been especiallycharacteristic when it comes to negative theology in demiurgical mythssuch as those in the examples from Nag Hammadi. What needs to be seenis the far more protracted, more complex experience of knowing God thatseems often implied in these myths—an experience stretched out overimportant and informative stages, levels, and media (e.g., the structure ofthe material cosmos) that are as integral to the total experience of know-ing as is the realization of God’s unknowability.302Michael A.

IntroductionWe may imagine, proceeding from some texts in Plotinus Enn.6.7 and Plato’s Timaeus,the following anachronistic dialogue between Platoand Plotinus:PLATO: The Demiurge and his children ordered all things in the cosmosaccording to a rational plan. Thus you can see that the ox has hornsin order to defend itself.PLOTINUS: Now, my revered Plato, in addition to particular things thatwe behold with our senses, do you not also claim that there areForms or Ideas, known alone to the eye of intellect? And such Formsground the characters of things that we perceive with our senses?PLATO: Indeed I do, Plotinus, as I have said on many occasions.PLOTINUS: Just now, my dear Plato, you were speaking of oxen, wereyou not?PLATO: Indeed I was, Plotinus.PLOTINUS: Now you were saying that the ox has horns in order to defenditself. Yet you would have another reason for its possession of horns.Would you not then say, Plato, that in addition to the sensible oxthere is also an intelligible Ox, a Form of Ox? And would you not saythat the sensible ox has horns through participation in or imitation ofthe Form of Ox?PLATO: Indeed I would, Plotinus.PLOTINUS: Now the sensible ox has horns in order to defend itselfagainst other oxen, or other animals. Is this correct?PLATO: To be sure, Plotinus. But it also has horns by participation in orimitation of the Form of Ox.PLOTINUS: But this Form of Ox, oh divine one, does it have horns inorder to defend itself against other Forms, e.g., the Form of Wolf, orthe Form of Man?PLATO: Such a result would be absurd, oh creature of a day!PLOTINUS: Then the Form of Ox, apart from the particular ox, why doesit have horns?PLATO: Why, to be an ox, of course."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Our imagined dialogue establishes that the sensible ox has two dimen-sions, one horizontal (it has horns in order to defend itself against othercreatures on the same plane of existence) and another vertical (it has hornsby participation in or imitation of the Form of Ox). The Form of Ox, how-ever, seems not to have the horizontal relationship yielded by the themeof self-defense. In the universe of discourse that surrounds the ox quaox,the ox has horns in order to be an ox. The Form of Ox is an expressionof aseity.By “aseity” I mean the state or condition of ontological independence.“Aseity” means a se.As such, it could be taken to mean “dependent uponitself,” a phrase that might introduce an unwanted duality. I take it ratheras a se explicandum,i.e., to be understood from within a universe of dis-course belonging to itself. I do not mean “self-dependent,” but “independ-ent,” i.e., not depending for its existence on other entities. An objectionthat may properly be made to my use of the term “aseity” is that the sen-sible world is dependent upon and explained with reference to the Soul,the Soul bears this relationship to Intellect, and Intellect to the One for itsbeing. Thus Soul and Intellect, as dependent, could not have aseity. Forthe purposes of my discussion, however, I bracket the question of Intel-lect’s dependence upon the One when I discuss the relationship, forexample, between the sensible world and the intelligible world. From thehorizon of the relationship between the intelligible and sensible worlds,the intelligible world possesses aseity in contrast to the sensible world.Now, further enquiry will reveal that the intelligible world is dependentupon the One for its existence, but that is another question.To return to our example, in the particular ox, the quality of havinghorns may share in that aseity through participation. Yet the attribute “hav-ing horns” belongs to its connectedness with other particulars. We may saythe same of “having eyes.” The ox has eyes in order not to bump intothings or to find food. On another plane of discourse, the ox has eyes inorder to be itself.Plotinus teaches that there is also connectedness in the World of Forms.In Intellect, each Form contains all of the others in an internal relationship.To think one is to think all the others at once. Thus to noetic intuition, theForm of Ox is in some way all the other Forms as well. In Intellect, thereis no contradiction between aseity and connectedness, and Intellect is theperfect realization of providence and its eternal model. In the sensibleworld, however, the principles of aseity and connectedness come apart.Thus the sensible ox will be viewed as having horns only from the horizonof its connectedness with other things, i.e., its need to defend itself. Yet thisconnectedness is a vulgar connectedness. As the sensible world, not partic-ular by particular, but as a whole approaches the unity of Intellect, a deeperconnectedness is revealed that preserves the aseity of each thing.304Frederic M. Schroeder"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"We may examine some texts that will support the Platonic-Plotiniandialogue we have constructed. In the Tim.45de Plato describes how themortal body is equipped with vision for the sake of preservation (swthriva,d7). Following this text, Plotinus says that humans and other animals areequipped with sense for preservation (wJ\" ou{tw\" a]n swv/zoito, 6.7.1.1–5).Aristotle, in the An. post.2.8.93a17–21 argues that we must know the“that” or existence of a thing (to; o{ti) before we know its reason for exis-tence (to; diovti). However, he argues further (An post.2.8.93a39–b8) that itis possible to know a thing’s existence and its reason for existence by thesame act: thus the definition of and the reason for an eclipse admit of thesame account: the occultation of the sun by the moon. Plotinus asks, con-cerning the intelligible world, “How then can the alone and the one and thesimple contain explicitly the ‘this that there should not be that,’ and ‘therehad to be this if not that’ and ‘this appeared useful and this preservative[swthvrion] when it came to be’?” (6.7.1.39–42).1Plotinus argues further thatboth the human being and human sight exist in the intelligible world insuch a way that “that” (to; o{ti) and “why” (to; diovti) coalesce. He offers asan illustration of that coalescence Aristotle’s example of the eclipse(6.7.2.1–12). Intellect is everything that it contains so that “that” and “why”are embraced by that unity (6.7.2.10–11). He asks further how horns in theintelligible world could exist for the sake of defense? Surely it is only forcompleteness (pro;\" to; aujtarkev\" tou' zw/vou kai; to; tevleon, 6.7.10.1–2).2From the above discussion, we may see that there are two differentkinds of salvation or preservation (swthriva). In the first, shared by bothPlato and Plotinus, something has a characteristic in order to preserve itselfagainst perils in the sensible world. In the second, in which Plotinuscovertly disagrees with a Platonic statement, while undertaking a legitimateextension of Plato’s views of Form, it has that characteristic, not becauseThe Plotinian Philosophy of Providence3051The translations shall be taken from A.

Hierarchy and ConnectednessThe Greek word that we translate as “providence,” provnoia, is derivedfrom pro-, “before,” and noei'n, “to think.” From this etymology we aretempted to see providence as a taking thought beforehand, so that Goddeliberates like a craftsman when designing the creation. Plotinus warnsagainst this interpretation:And further, [consider it] also like this: we affirm that each and every thingin the All, and this All here itself, is as it would have been if the freechoice [proaivresi\"] of its maker had willed it, and its state is as if thismaker proceeding regularly in his calculations [proi>evmeno\"] with foresight[proi>dw'n] had made it according to his providence [provnoian]. But sincethings here are always like this and always come to be like this, so theirrational principles also always rest among the things which exist alltogether, standing still in a better order; so that the things here transcendprovidence and transcend free choice, and all the things which are in realbeing stand in intellectual stillness. So that if someone calls this disposi-tion of things providence, he must understand it in this way, that Intellectis there standing still before this All [pro; tou'de nou'\" tou' panto;\" eJstwv\"],and this All here is from and according to Intellect. (6.8.17.1–12)Plotinus loves to play with language: we may notice the semantic field ofwords or phrases beginning with the prefix pro- (“before”): proaivresi\",proi>evmeno\", proi>dw'n, provnoia, pro; tou'de. The beforeness or priority ofprovidence then does not belong to foresight as we would understand it,but to the beforeness, firstness, or priority of Intellect.3Now the priority of306Frederic M.

Yet such aspersionsare not merely a failure to observe hierarchy. They are also a refusal toallow each thing to be what it is in its aseity, i.e., as sufficient unto itselfin the absence of hierarchical reference:For one ought not to enquire whether one thing is less than another butwhether it is, as itself, sufficient [wJ\" aujto; aujtavrkw\"]; for all things oughtnot to have been equal. Is this then so, because the creator measuredthem out with the deliberate intention that all things ought not to beequal? Not at all; but it was so according to nature for things to comeabout so. For the rational forming principle of this universe follows uponanother soul, and this soul follows upon Intellect, and Intellect is notsome one of the things here but all things. (3.3.3.17–22)Here Intellect, which initiates a hierarchy, is not what it is by membershipin that hierarchy.The Plotinian Form, apart from its uses in explanation, ontological,epistemological, or ethical, retains aseity and a value independent of itsfunctions as cause. The Form reveals its aseity to those who are open toreceive it, not simply as an explanation, but as an intrinsically valuableobject of intellective vision. The Form is also, in the hypostasis of Intellect,The Plotinian Philosophy of Providence307position between the intelligible and the sensible world: it does not belong to theintelligible world which is “beyond providence” (ejpeivkeina pronoiva\", 6.8.17.7).However, the providence transcended in 6.8.17 is the vulgar providence of fore-sight; as we have seen, in a higher sense providence is founded in the priority ofIntelligence, that nou'\"is prov. Schubert generally sees providence as a mediationbetween intelligible and sensible reality. He sees the following hierarchy (53):Intellect is the origin, the Soul the place, Nature the vehicle, Logos the content,providence the result, and matter the object of formation. Schubert’s treatmentneglects what I am calling “aseity.” He is properly critical of Harder’s translationof Logos as “Weltplan” on the grounds that it implies rational planning and anexercise of discursive thought (115). However, he falls into the trap himself (109):“Plotin geht von der Voraussetzung aus, dass die Welt dem Nous gemäss, alsovernünfitg geordnet ist; diesen Sachverhalt drückt bei ihm der Pronoiabegriff aus.”Yet Intellect is not the locus of discursive thought. Thus that the world imitatesIntellect or unfolds its content in such a way that it would appear orderly to thediscursive mind does not mean that it imitates Intellect and henceis orderly.

Each Form, inbeing what it is, is also and contemplates also the other Forms.It is only in the sensible world that aseity and connectedness arebrought into conflict. To say that something’s existence is justified only byits contribution to the whole is to deny its aseity. On the other hand, to saythat something might exist unto itself, without reference to the whole, is toaffirm aseity at the cost of connectedness. The most basic problem in Plo-tinian providence and theodicy is how to reconcile aseity and connected-ness in the sensible world. If the prefix pro- (“before”) belongs to aseity, then the prefix sun-(“with”) describes connectedness. We may see a semantic field involvingthis prefix at work in On Providence 2,where Plotinus argues that appar-ently chance events are embraced by the universal connectedness of thecosmos. The semantic field sharing the prefix sun- (“with”) is in this pas-sage complemented by a semantic field initiated by the prefix pro-(“before”). The connection of these two semantic fields suggests that ase-ity and connectedness are brought into a dialectical relationship witheach other:Chance circumstances [suntucivai] are not responsible for the good life,but they, too, follow harmoniously [sumfwvnw] on the causes before them,and proceed woven into the chain of causation by so following.

The universe is ordered by the generalship of providence [pronoiva/strathgikh/'] which sees the actions and experiences and what must beready to hand, food and drink, and all weapons and devices as well;everything which results from the interweaving is foreseen [o{sa ejx aujtw'nsumplekomevnwn proewvratai], in order that this result [to; ...sumbaivnon]may have room to be well placed, and all things come in a well-plannedway from the general—though what his enemies planned to do is out ofhis control. But if it was possible for him to command the enemy force aswell, if he was really “the greater leader” to whom all things are subject,what would be unordered [ajsuvntakton], what would not be fitted into[sunhrmosmevnon] his plan? (3.3.2)Plotinus begins with the word suntuciva, “chance circumstance,” a com-pound noun consisting of the prefix sun-, “with, together with” and tuvch,“fortune.” One event happens to occur with another: it is a co-incidence.Now he dwells upon the prefix sun- (“with”), showing how an apparentcoincidence is really embraced in the universal synchronicity of the cosmos.The substantive translated as “result” above, to; sumbaivnon, would normallymean just “something that happened.” But we are now prepared to see how308Frederic M.

Plotinus argues against the view that the world was created byplanning and deliberation:Therefore neither forethought [provnoia] for a living thing nor fore-thought for this universe in general derived from a plan; since there isno planning there at all, but it is called planning to show that all thingsthere are as they would be as a result of planning at a later stage, andforesight [proovrasi\"] because it is as a wise man would foresee[proi?doito] it. For in things which did not come to be before planning[pro; logismou'], planning is useful because of the lack of the powerbefore planning, and foresight, because the one who foresees did nothave the power by which there would be no need for foresight.(6.7.1.28–35)In 6.7.2, a passage that we examined above, Plotinus is showing how “that”(to; o{ti) and “why” (to; divoti) coalesce in Intellect. To understand this, weare to comprehend how the whole transcends the parts. If our perspectiveis simply how one part relates to another (linear causation) we shall neversee how everything is embraced in a transcendent wholeness. Indulging anamplificatio,Plotinus illustrates the connectedness of Intellect from thelesser connectedness of the sensible cosmos.

If there-fore there is a joint existence [sunupovstasi\"] of all things together, of allthings with nothing random about it, and there must be no separation,then the things caused would have their causes in themselves, and eachwould be of such a kind as to possess its cause causelessly. If then theintelligibles have no cause of their being but are self-sufficient and inde-pendent of cause, they would be in possession of their cause in them-selves and with themselves. For again, if nothing there is purposeless,and there are many things in each, you could say that all the thingswhich each individual has are each individual reason why. So there inthe intelligible the reason why was before [proh'n] and with the things[sunh'n] and was not a “why”, but a “that”: but rather both are one.(6.7.2.30–46).In the concluding sentence we may see that, in Intellect, just as “why” and“that” coalesce, so do “before” (pro-) and “with” (sun-). We have seen that“before” belongs to aseity: the intelligible cause is not in its own nature acause nor is it “before” as in “antecedent cause.” “With” belongs to con-nectedness, but not of a kind that may be understood in terms of linearcausation, of one thing causing another. All is embraced in a universal con-nectedness. Intellect models providence, while, strictly speaking, it is notitself providential, i.e., there is no pro- or “before” in it. Its connectednessis organic: the function or contribution of any part may be understood, notwith reference to some other part or parts, but always in relation to organicwholeness and connectedness. The sensible cosmos imperfectly imitatesIntellect, so that here for the first time “before” and “with,” “why” and“that” come apart.The connectedness then of the intelligible world is undone in the sen-sible world as the descended Form is sundered by its relationships to otherthings. Thus aseity is challenged by the kind of connectedness that prevailsin the horizontal dimension of the sensible cosmos. Yet there is also a chal-lenge to aseity in hierarchical connectedness. If we see any link in thehierarchical chain as confined to the role of mediating between the phaseabove and the phase below itself we deny its aseity. That there is a hier-archy and that mediation occurs within it is clear. Yet it is Plotinus’s taskto preserve the aseity of each entity in his universe. The hierarchy is estab-lished, not by some external Demiurge, or by the thought of any philoso-pher, but by each entity within it being itself and realizing the horizontalconnectedness appropriate to itself.310Frederic M.

It should, however, be stipulated that a safeguard of something inthe sensible world is grounded in the thing’s intelligible essence.5On theintelligible plane, a creature has a characteristic both for the sake of itscompleteness and for the sake of the integrity of the whole cosmos. Wemay expect that these distinctions are relevant to Plotinian anthropology.!Adravsteiais the cosmic law by which the sins or good deeds of pastlives are respectively punished or rewarded in future lives.6Thus bad mas-ters in this life are made slaves in the next, intemperate rich men madepoor, etc. (3.2.13). On the horizontal plane of salvation, even unjust suf-fering in this life will eventually be remedied in the next. This karma,asit were, that redresses the wrongs of past lives is deployed in the sensibleworld (certainly it is founded ultimately in the intelligible realm). The oper-ation of this cosmic law, while it may not, as the safeguard of substance inthe sensible world, afford us immediate preservation or salvation from per-ils, works long range in favor of the just upon that plane.The second sense of salvation is realized in the sage’s indifference tofate and his contemplative deliverance from concern with this world. If weare plundered of our identity by the parasitic division of our attributes asthey are deployed in the sensible cosmos, our transcendence of our rela-tionships with the sensible world secures our aseity. That transcendence inturn introduces us to the community and perfect connectedness of theintelligible cosmos.7Plotinus enjoins indifference to the hazards of this world. We shouldobserve murders and the sackings of cities as if they were events on astage (3.2.15.43–47). Our ability to escape the evils of the world dependsupon a fundamental principle: it is not matter that diminishes us or dragsus down: the struggle is between the higher and the lower self (3.3.4.27–The Plotinian Philosophy of Providence31156.7.3.15–22.6The principle of ajdravsteiais borrowed from Plato, Phaedr.248c2; cf. Plotinus3.2.13.16.7V. Schubert, Pronoia und Logos,92–93 (cf. 126), complains that in 3.2.16 Plot-inus tries to establish the same sort of benign opposition between good and evilas is embraced by the opposites such as high and low, white and black, hot andcold. It depends surely upon one’s eschatology. Plotinus sees the sensible cosmosas an imperfect imitation of the intelligible world. On this model, there can be nofinal victory of good over evil: they can only be counterpoised in a cosmic balance."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"34).8 The human soul may escape the cycle of birth and rebirth and standwith the Soul outside becoming (e[xw genevsew\", 3.2.4.6–11).In a previous article, I have argued that Plotinus makes an abundantuse of the ontological term initiated by the sun- (“with”) prefix, sunousiva,and other epistemological vocabulary initiated by the same prefix (suvnesi\"andsunaivsqhsi\").9The word sunousivabears the senses of coherence ofan entity with itself, presence of one superior entity to a lower entity, anddependence of a lower entity upon a higher one. Plotinus prefers sunousivato parousivaas a term to describe presence because, where parousivadescribes only the presence of a higher entity to a lower one, sunousivaandrelated words initiated by the sun- prefix offer an elaborate and elasticinventory of presence and dependence.The uses of the sun- prefix in our present context of providence offera familiar elasticity. Such words describe the coherence (connectedness)of both the sensible and intelligible worlds. The connectedness of the sen-sible world is founded in the greater connectedness of the intelligibleworld. Sunousivamay properly describe both instances of connectedness.Yet the sunousivaof the sensible world has both horizontal and verticaldimensions. It is founded in the priority of Intellect as providence. Yet thatprovidence is before by being with, i.e., with itself, in the greatest senseof connectedness. So the withness of the sensible world, as it is intensi-fied, enters progressively into the prior connectedness of the intelligibleworld, so that the “before” of providence becomes “with” for us and we“with” it.Apart from the question of transcendence, there abides the question offree choice in this world and whether it is compromised by the determi-nations of providence. We have seen how in 6.8.17.3 proaivresi\"as delib-erated choice is excluded from the act of creating the sensible world. It iseliminated together with other words initiated by the pro- prefix, includ-ing providence as a kind of foresight or taking thought beforehand. Wehave also seen how “before” is, in Intellect, absorbed into “with.” Thisscheme is mapped onto Plotinus’s account of free will:Suppose you say: “I have power to choose this or that”? But the thingsthat you will choose [aiJrhvsei] are included in [suntevtaktai] the universalorder, because your part is not a mere causal interlude in the All but youare counted in as the person you are. (3.3.3.1–3)312Frederic M. Schroeder8Cf. Armstrong’s note, which refers us to 1.1.10; 2.9.2; 4.4.18; 6.4.14–15. Thesame point is made in 3.6.5.9F. M. Schroeder, “Presence and Dependence in the Plotinian Philosophy ofConsciousness: Sunousia, Sunaisthêsisand Sunesis,” ANRW2.36.1:677–99."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"The verb translated as “include” (suntavttein) is initiated by the sun-(“with”) prefix. Here what we see as priorities and choices are alreadyenmeshed in a universal connectedness. Notice how this connectednessdoes not negate the aseity of the human person. The human being is notsimply the object, but the subject of providence, insofar as he or she is amicrocosm: “we are each one of us an intelligible universe” (ejsme;ne{kasto\" kovsmo\" nohtov\", 3.4.3.22).10The bad man is responsible for hisevildoing: “For he is not only what he was made but has another free prin-ciple, which is not outside providence or the rational principle of thewhole” (3.3.4.6–8). One could say that his error consists in electing his ownand partial providence, not looking to the whole and its beneficent order.11In the organic All, the part is saved by the whole (e{kaston tw/' o{lw/ sw/vze-tai, 4.4.32.33). Salvation lies in integrity.12That principle of aseity is admirably expressed in the lapidary sen-tence: “Providence ought not to exist in such a way as to make us noth-ing” (Ouj ga;r dh; ou{tw th;n provnoian ei\\nai dei', w{ste mhde;n hJma'\" ei\\nai,3.2.9.1–2). Nothing in the Plotinian universe is ever merely an instrument.It is also the case that human beings, while they may be determined, arealso determinants in universal providence: “men, too, are principles” (ajr-cai; de; kai; a[nqrwpoi, 3.2.10.18).When a seer looks into the future, he does not see the causes that leadto the things he foresees, e.g., he would see visions of war and carnage,but he would not see the causes that led to the Second World War. Hewould see “that” and not “why.” In 3.3.6, the ordinary person is unable todistinguish between providence and the body of cause and effects onwhich it works. Providence is the form, the network of cause and effectthe matter. When the diviner sees a person in the future, he does not workout the network of causes that produced that person. He sees the endtoward which providence has been working. He sees the “that” (to; o{ti),not the “why” (to; divoti). The end of providence is suchness, not the “rea-son why.” The poet and contemplative Angelus Silesius says: “Die Rose istohne warum; Sie blühet, weil sie blühet”13(“The rose has no ‘why’: itblooms because it blooms”). That sense of suchness and aseity is at theheart of the Plotinian doctrine of providence.14The Plotinian Philosophy of Providence31310Cf. Parma, Pronoia und Providentia,102; cf. 106.11Cf.

Plotinus argues (3.2.14) that, while in Intel-lect each is all, in this world “man” is a part and an individual, not all.Yet he continues:But there would certainly not be any grudging by the whole if the partdid gain in beauty and order so as to make it of greater worth; for itmakes the whole more beautiful when it has become of greater value byits gain in beauty and order. For it becomes of this kind by being madelike the whole and, so to speak, being allowed to be like this and givensuch a place that in the region of man, too, something may shine in himas the stars shine in the heaven of the gods; a place from which there maybe a perception of something like a great and beautiful image of a god—whether a living one or one made by the art of Hephaestus—in whichthere are stars flashing on the face, and in the breast others, and a settingof stars placed where it will be clearly seen. (3.2.14.20–30)We are reminded of an astronomical illustration of the unity of Intellect(5.8.4):Each there has everything in itself and sees all things in every other, sothat all are everywhere and each and every one is all and the glory isunbounded; for each of them is great, because even the small is great: thesun there is all the stars, and each star is the sun and all the others.(5.8.4.6–10).In 3.2.14, Plotinus makes clear that the sensible world can never achieve theidentity of each and all that is to be discovered in Intellect. Yet at times thatcompleteness may be approximated, as in the present image of the starryface of the contemplative in which the illumination manifests the wholenessof Intellect. Even as there the stars are all the sun and the sun is all the stars,so this countenance participates in that heavenly noetic unity. At the sametime, the human being who achieves that participation is at the greatest levelof individual perfection and is most human. Thus the aseity of human per-fection is at one with the interconnectedness of all things.15314Frederic M. Schroederhuman inability to sort out what is caused by providence and what is caused bymatter. In this he fails to see the positive character of divining the “that,” asopposed to discovering the “why” of things.15R. Turcan, The Cults of the Roman Empire(trans. A. Nevill; Oxford and Cam-bridge, Mass.: Blackwell, 1996), 152, sees in this passage a reference to an idol ofZeus Heliopolitanus. The god of Baalbek’s statue is distinguished by the fact “thathis idol combines the cuirass with a celestial garment. The compartments of his gar-ment are occupied by busts or symbols of the planetary gods.” (See plate 18 in the"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"4. Some Thoughts about Plotinian Providence and GnosisIn Sethian texts the descent of Sophia results in a further emanationof a Demiurge who fashions the sensible cosmos. The gnostic resists thecreation of the Demiurge in seeking deliverance from the evil world thathe has made. In his treatise Against the Gnostics,2.9.10–12 Plotinusattacks those who present a similar view. His assault upon the gnosticDemiurge is well prepared by his deconstruction of the Platonic Demi-urge. Certainly Plotinus takes the view that the Demiurge of the Timaeusis a device to demonstrate the relationship of imitation that exists betweenthe intelligible and sensible worlds, i.e., the story is to be interpreted, notliterally, but figuratively. What is more, divine making is not to be con-sidered as an exercise in deliberative thought. Now the Demiurge is amediator who mediates between the intelligible and the sensible reality.Plotinus’s insistence on aseity does not dispute a hierarchical ordering ofthe All in which the One stands first, Intellect second, Soul third, and thesensible cosmos last. Yet “first” is not “first” in the sense that it exists eitherto initiate a series or to mediate between one level of reality and another.Hierarchy is an article of suchness rather than a tool of mediation.16Intel-lect is the content of the sensible world.17If we ask, what does the sen-sible world mean, the answer is: Intellect. The approfondissementofsensible connectedness isIntellect.The Plotinian Philosophy of Providence315same volume). Turcan, however, sees 3.2.14 as referring only to the sky and not toa human figure. That it does refer to a human or somewhat anthropomorphic fig-ure only enhances Turcan’s argument that this passage refers to the sculpture inquestion. We may think of Plotinus’s view that the sculptor Pheidias, while employ-ing a sensible model, portrayed Zeus as he would appear if he chose to appearamong us (5.8.1.38–40). In 2.9.18.30–35, Plotinus, censuring the gnostics for theirdespising of the cosmos, urges that we imitate the soul of the All and of the stars.Perhaps this material influences Porphyry to write in the Vit. Plot.13.5–7 that “whenhe [Plotinus] was speaking his intellect visibly lit up his face.”16Cf. Parma, Pronoia und Providentia,59–60, 72. For an example of the otherview, see E. Früchtel, Weltentwurf und Logos: Zur Metaphysik Plotins(Frankfurt amMain: Klostermann, 1970), 41: “Die dritte Hypostase, die Seele, hat die Aufgabe, zwis-chen dem mundus intelligibilis und dem mundus sensibilis zu vermitteln.” In Plotinus,“such” (toiou'ton) refers both to what kind of thing something is and also to some-thing substantial: “I mean ‘of this kind’ [to; toiou'ton] having together with their sub-stance also the cause of their existence [to; su;n aujtw'n th'/ oujsiva/ e[cein kai; th'\"uJpostavsew\" th;n oujsivan], so that the observer afterwards can say why each of its inher-ent parts is there, for instance why there is an eye and why the feet of these particu-lar beings are as they are and the cause which brings into existence together each partof each thing and brings them into existence on account of each other” (6.8.14.20–25).Surely the use of toiou'tonhere expresses what I am calling “aseity” very nicely.17Cf. Parma, Pronoia und Providentia,42ff."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"For Plotinus, the gnostics err in thinking that a hierarchy implies anunredeemed diminution. This is because they misunderstand the verynature of the true hierarchy that preserves the aseity of each phase. For thegnostics “before” destroys “with” and without “with” there is no meaning.Human salvation, in its first and most important sense, depends, not uponthe mediation of a savior figure, but upon an autonomous and codeter-mining role in the cosmos and the deepening of that connectedness untilit debouches upon the noetic unity and connectedness of Intellect.18Finally, Plotinus insists against the gnostics that if, after every argument,one persists in blaming the order of the cosmos, there is no need to act asa citizen of it (politeuvesqai, 2.9.9.17).19We are altogether too accustomedto construe the final words of the Enneadsin Porphyry’s arrangement, the“flight of the alone to the alone” (6.9.11.51), as a statement of contempla-tive individualism at the cost of community. As Gurtler has shown, a senseof community informs all of Plotinus’s thinking.20We may feel entitled tosee in 2.9.9 an ethical rejection of what Plotinus perceives as gnostic exclu-sivity. In Intellect, where the relationship between part and whole is as itshould be, all is friendship (pa'n auJtw'/ fivlon, 3.2.1.32). In the sensible cos-mos, the parts are at war and there is no longer only friendship (filiva). Onepart is at variance with another part at whose cost it is saved (swv/zetai,3.2.2.1–7). Note that we have here a negative version of salvation. Aristotleobserves that the good ruler will promote civic friendship because it pro-duces justice more effectively than constitutional articles.21As friendship316Frederic M.

AsCorrigan points out (35), in the same chapter that describes the “flight of the aloneto the alone,” Plotinus says, “This is the life of gods and godlike and blessed men”(6.9.11.49–51). This statement suggests a sense of community.21Cf. Eth. nic.8.1.1155a22–28 and F. M.
