Thisbook started out as a PhD thesis in the Classics Department at King’sCollege London. My PhD was generously funded by an Arts andHumanities Research Council (AHRC) doctoral studentship, withoutwhich this research would not have been possible; additional confer-ence grants from King’s College London and the Society for thePromotion of Roman Studies enabled me to travel and share myideas. In their early form, many of the arguments expressed in thisbook were presented to audiences in London, Oxford, Exeter, andChicago, and I am grateful for the comments and questions of theaudiences on those occasions.London itself provided a rich and stimulating environment inwhich to study the ancient past. I was able to draw not only on thefacilities of King’s College London but also on the world-leadingresources of the Warburg Institute and the Institute of ClassicalStudies. I wish to thank the staff of all three institutions for theirhelp and interest over several years. The postgraduate communityattached to the Postgraduate Work-in-Progress seminars at the Insti-tute of Classical Studies taught me much about the research processand, just as importantly, provided much-needed laughter and manyopportunities to escape from the library. It was a privilege to workalongside so many dedicated and enthusiastic researchers.Throughout my career, I have been extremely fortunate to benefitfrom the interest and advice of a number of exceptional scholars.In particular, Michael Trapp was a helpful and engaged secondarysupervisor, always happy to point me towards relevant books on Greekdemonology. Fiona Haarer and Nicola Devlin taught me Greek;Valentina Arena provided an important grounding in Roman politicalthought. Aaron Johnson offered valuable suggestions for further read-ing, as well as much insightful conversation on matters Eusebian. Theadvice and encouragement of my PhD examiners, Averil Cameron andJohn North, was invaluable in turning the thesis into a book. I am alsovery grateful to the series editors, Gillian Clark and Andrew Louth, aswell as to the anonymous reader for Oxford University Press, for theirOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 23/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"interest in the manuscript and for their detailed and constructivefeedback, which has done much to improve thefinal book.In particular, my heartfelt thanks go to Sophie Lunn-Rockliffe, whofirst introduced me to the fascinating world of late antiquity as anundergraduate at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and later supervised my PhDwith insight, good humour, and considerable patience. Without herguidance, the thesis—and this book—would have been very much lessthan it is. I would also like to thank Tom Perridge, Karen Raith, CélineLouasli, and the editorial team at Oxford University Press for theirinterest and assistance throughout the publication process.

HisHistoria ecclesiastica(HE) is one of themost important sources for the history of the early Christianchurch1—likewise hisVita Constantini(VC) andDe laudibusConstantini(LC) are invaluable for those studying the reign ofConstantine.2ThePraeparatio Evangelica(PE) contains extensivequotations, preserving lengthy fragments of earlier works thatwould otherwise have been lost.3Alongside these texts, Eusebiusalso left several works of biblical scholarship and exegesis, as well asof theological polemic—all written in a period of dramatic politicaland religious upheaval.4In consequence, it is hardly surprising thathe has long attracted the attention of scholars, or that work onEusebius continues toflourish today.5The reader might thereforebe forgiven for wondering what this present study can add to analready considerable body of scholarship.1T.

This book will highlight the prominent placeoccupied by demons in Eusebius’cosmology. In doing so, it will shedfresh light on Eusebius’ideas about human agency and moral respon-sibility, salvation history, and the role of a Christian emperor. Withthe exception of Eusebius’views on moral responsibility, which, asI will show in Chapter 4, merit rather more attention than they havehitherto received, these are topics that have long been of interest toEusebian scholars. However, by examining these subjects throughthe prism of Eusebius’ideas about demons, this study will offer avery different interpretation of Eusebius from that with which lateantique scholars are familiar. It will present a Eusebius far less atease in his world than is generally assumed and will suggest thatwe need to reconsider the common belief that Eusebius was a com-placent optimist.PREVIOUS SCHOLARSHIPScholarship on Eusebius falls broadly into two main categories—thatwhich uses Eusebius’works as a source of information either aboutthe events they describe or about the emperor Constantine, and thatwhich manifests an interest in Eusebius’ideas in their own right. Thefirst approach has a long history and has frequently been linked toscholars’desire to understand the religious views and motives of theemperor Constantine. This trend in the scholarship can be seen as farback as the work of Jacob Burckhardt,6and arguably reached its peakover a century later in the comprehensive study of Timothy Barnes.7Despite their similar interest in using Eusebius’works to assess thefigure of Constantine, these two scholars held directly opposite viewsof Eusebius himself. For Burckhardt, he was‘thefirst thoroughlydishonest historian of antiquity’,8while Barnes, by contrast, suggestedthat Eusebius’works reveal his‘evident care and honesty’.96J. Burckhardt,The Age of Constantine the Great, trans. M. Hadas (New York:Dorset Press, 1989 [originally published in German, 1853]).7C&E.8Burckhardt,Age of Constantine, 283.9C&E, 141.2The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Unsurprisingly, this led to very different characterizations ofConstantine. According to Burckhardt, Constantine was a cannypolitician, whose attitude towards religious matters was one of‘pol-itical expediency’,10yet Barnes, relying heavily on Eusebius’ownportraits of the emperor, presented Constantine as a committedChristian.11Barnes, of course, was not uncritical of Eusebius—henotes that there are‘serious chronological errors’in Eusebius’HE,12and also points out that Eusebius often paraphrased and shortenedhis quotations in a way that might‘misrepresent’the original mater-ial.13Nevertheless, Barnes attributed such misquotation to scribalerror.14Barnes’primary interest thus lay in the use of Eusebius’works to produce a picture of Constantine, rather than in an exam-ination of Eusebius’rhetorical and literary technique.15This question of Eusebius’‘reliability’recurs frequently as part ofthisfirst strand of Eusebian scholarship. Although it has been shownthat at least one of the contemporary documents Eusebius quotes inhis work was reported accurately,16this cannot, as Averil Cameronhas pointed out, prove the accuracy of all the similar sources which hecites.17At times, Eusebius has received a rather negative assessmentfrom modern historians hoping tofind in his works an approachto historiography similar to their own.18This approach to Eusebius—using his works as more-or-less reliable‘sources’for the reignof Constantine—has, however, been challenged in more recentscholarship.

In particular, scholarly interest in the past has tended tofocus on Eusebius’political thought and his ideas about kingship andempire.23For many scholars, Eusebius’so-called‘Constantinian’writings—theVC,LC, and later books of theHE—can be said tohave laid the foundations of later Byzantine theories of kingship.24(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997), 145–74; A.

Peterson, there has also been a tendency tocharacterize Eusebius as a‘political theologian’, whose theologicalviews were moulded to support an idea of divinely appointedsupreme monarchy.25In many accounts, Eusebius appears as littlemore than a mouthpiece of the emperor Constantine.26More sym-pathetic readings have denied that Eusebius’theology bent tofit hispolitical views and have suggested instead that Eusebius’existingtheological views predisposed him to welcome the Constantinianregime and to justify it in the manner he did.27Recent scholarship has tended to move away from this servilecharacterization of Eusebius and from a preoccupation with hispolitical writings by turning to examine some of his previouslyneglected works.28These include works of exegesis and biblical com-mentary in which references to the empire and emperor occupy a lessprominent place.29This has led scholars more recently to stress theBaynes,‘Eusebius and the Christian Empire’, 168–72; Farina,L’impero, 257;H.

Aaron Johnson, for instance, has established the importanceof ideas of ethnicity in Eusebius’presentation of Christian identity.34In this, Eusebius’apologetic approach can be seen to correspond tothat of other early Christian thinkers.35Further work has exploredEusebius’attitude towards other religious groupings of pagans andJews,36or has looked more closely at his theology and his role in thedoctrinal disputes of his time.37Alongside this, the past two decades30For example: Hollerich,‘Religion and Politics’; Hollerich,Eusebius’Commen-tary on Isaiah.31C&E, 266–7.

However, unlike earlier work on this topic, which has oftentended to focus upon the ideas of kingship and imperial sovereigntypresented in later works like theVCandLC, it will adopt a broaderunderstanding of what may be termed‘political’. Looking beyondthose of Eusebius’works which directly discuss Constantine and thehigh political affairs of the empire, this study will examine Eusebius’views on topics such as human agency and responsibility, and thepurpose and direction of human history. In influencing Eusebius’understanding of how individuals related to each other, society, andeven the wider universe, such views are inherently relevant to‘polit-ical’questions about the best form of government for Christiansand the most suitable style of leadership. Clear connections betweenthese various topics will emerge over the course of this volume. Thisbroad perspective, exploring the complex network of ideas thatunderpinned Eusebius’high political speculation, is one new contri-bution that this study can offer to scholarship on Eusebius’politicalthought.Afurther,moresignificant innovation lies in the decision to approachEusebius’thought through the lens of hisideas about demons. Despiteprolific references to the demonic throughout many—although not all—of his works, dedicated studies of Eusebius’demonology are almostnon-existent.

In particular, Stuart Clark’swork on early modern demonology has shown how intellectuals ofthis period could‘think with’demons, using their ideas on this subjectto develop their views on other, most notably political, topics.43Clark’s approach to ideas about the demonic has, however, been thesubject of some criticism in more recent scholarship. Ellen Muehl-berger, whose work on angels emphasizes the reality of these spiritualbeings for late antique thinkers,44is particularly dismissive of such anapproach, arguing that it implies a‘utilitarian motive’for ideas aboutangels and fails to allow for this strength of belief.45Such concern isjustified.

Whilethis is by no means unprecedented,49Eusebius’output was so largethat scholars, particularly those interested in Eusebius’thought, havetended to limit themselves either to one specific work,50or to anarrow range of his works.51Such an approach, although often veryfruitful, would not have been appropriate in this case. In order to gainas full and accurate a picture as possible of Eusebius’understanding ofthe demonic, it is necessary to adopt a broad perspective. Eusebius’apologetic concerns in works such as thePEmean that such worksoften offer only a partial picture of Eusebius’thinking about demons.Of course, references to demons are more plentiful in some ofEusebius’works than in others; inevitably, it is those which containthe most detailed accounts of demons that appear most frequently inthis study. Works such as thePE,Demonstratio Evangelica(DE),HE,andVChave proved particularly fruitful for my examination ofEusebius’ideas about demons and, for that reason alone, will dom-inate the remaining chapters.Such a broad perspective brings challenges as well as benefits, raisingthe question, for instance, of how far we can generalize about a writer’sthought from works so different in style and form and often written46Clark,Thinking with Demons, viii.

This is a question which I will address more fully inChapter 1. Nevertheless, it is surely the case that, if we are to under-stand Eusebius’thought in all its variety and complexity, we need tohave a combination of both detailed studies of individual works andbroader surveys, since each can reveal different aspects of his thought.This book thus adopts a new approach to an old issue—the natureof Eusebius’political thought. In doing so, it reaches conclusionsabout Eusebius’outlook and attitude towards the events of his life-time that challenge what appears to be one of the most ingrainedassumptions of Eusebian scholarship—namely, that he was a tri-umphal optimist, who viewed the events of his lifetime as the climaxof human history. This view seems to be almost universal, evenamongst the most recent scholarship on Eusebius.52For Barnes,Eusebius’outlook was characterized by‘unrestrained optimism’;53his works represent‘a celebration of the success of Christianity’.54More recently, Johnson has suggested that‘triumphalism is a con-sistent feature of nearly all his works’.55The only question appears to52Exhaustive citation is impossible here; a selection of works which characterizeEusebius as optimistic or triumphalist includes: Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’,63–4; Mor-let,LaDémonstration Évangélique, 13; Hollerich,Eusebius’Commentary on Isaiah,26; W.

Thisbook will therefore argue that this traditional characterization ofEusebius needs to be modified in the light of his views on demons.Recognizing that an understanding of Eusebius’attitude towardsthe demonic can have a dramatic impact on how we read otheraspects of his thought also has implications for the wider study ofChristian demonology in the fourth century. Scholarly interest in thisfeature of early Christian culture has been growing in recent years,particularly following the publication of David Brakke’s monographDemons and the Making of the Monk, which highlighted the role ofideas about demons in the development of the idea of the Christianmonk.57This has since been followed by studies which explore lateantique ideas about the physicality of demons,58or the role of demonsin works of hagiography, such as theVita Antonii, and literaturerelating to the lives of desert saints.59With few exceptions,60however,scholars have appeared reluctant to explore the role of demons in thethought of the educated, intellectual Christians who held positions ofleadership in urban communities. This discrepancy has previouslybeen highlighted by Dayna Kalleres’work on the demonology ofGregory of Nazianzus.61By showing the importance of ideas of thedemonic in Gregory’s work, Kalleres also challenged the traditionalview that the rich and complex demonology of Evagrius Ponticus56Johnson,‘The Ends of Transfiguration’, 196, n.23.57D.

Vos,‘Demons Without and Within: The Representation ofDemons, the Saint and the Soul in Early Christian Lives, Letters and Sayings’,inN. Vos and W.

Discussing theplace of Christian accounts of miracles and exorcisms in encouragingconversion to Christianity, MacMullen suggests that accounts ofdemonic exorcisms such as those found in Athanasius’Vita Antoniiwould have had the most impact‘among the simple folk illuminatedby ascetic experience’.63He implies, by contrast, that such accountswould have had little effect on‘the learned and intellectual’.64Onceagain, we see a divide being created between‘learned’Christianity onthe one hand and‘simple’or‘ascetic’Christianity on the other. ForMacMullen, it appears, beliefs about demons can only be under-stood in the context of this, supposedly uneducated, Christianity. Infocusing on the works of Eusebius, a prominent bishop and leadingscholar of the time,65this study therefore goes some way towardsfilling a gap that presently exists in scholarship on early Christiandemonology. It also demonstrates some of the benefits that canresult from analysing, rather thandismissing, ideas about demonsin the works of educated fourth-century Christian leaders. In doingso, this volume echoes the work of Kalleres in highlighting theimportance of exploring references to demons in the writings ofintellectual Christian elites.Finally, brief mention of questions of translation and terminologymust be made at the outset of this study. I refer throughout to‘demons’rather than the alternative‘daemons’or‘daimons’, whichrepresent more neutral translations of the ancient Greekδαίμων.Scholars working on late antique demonology have differed in theirchoice of the best translation for this word. Sharron Coggan adopted‘demon’when referring to Jewish or Christian uses of the term, and‘daemon’for the more traditional Greek usage. This, she suggested,accurately reflected the different moral connotations which these62Kalleres,‘Demons and Divine Illumination’, 187–8.63MacMullen,Christianizing the Roman Empire, 112.64Kalleres,‘Demons and Divine Illumination’.65Eusebius’prominence is clear from the fact that he delivered speeches onimportant religious and imperial occasions—see, for example,VC1.1.1, 4.33.1–2,4.45.3–46.1. Constantine’s request that Eusebius provide him withfifty copies of theBible for churches in Constantinople suggests that Eusebius’scholarship was highlyregarded at the time—seeVC4.36.1–4.Introduction13OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"different writers attached to the term.66Such an approach, however,has rightly been criticized by Dale Martin on the grounds that itmight convey the false impression that late antique writers werethemselves using different terms.67We therefore need to make achoice between the different English terms and must use the sameterm consistently, regardless of the religious views of the writer underdiscussion. Martin’s own preference for‘daimon’makes perfect sensein the context of a book which is, for the most part, concerned withearlier Greek uses of the word.68It would not be appropriate here,however. Like Brakke, who also studied early Christian ideas aboutdemons, I have therefore opted to use the English‘demon’.69Thismore accurately reflects the negative character of these beings forEusebius than would the more neutral‘daemon’.CHAPTER OUTLINEThis book is divided into six chapters. Thefirst of these gives anoverview of Eusebius’oeuvre, focusing on those works which havemost to contribute to an understanding of his views on demons. Itaddresses, as necessary, any questions of dating or authenticity andattempts to situate Eusebius’various works in the context of thepolitical and religious developments of the time. In the second chap-ter our attention turns to Eusebius’ideas about demons. Benefitingfrom recent work on early Christian demonology, particularly byGregory Smith,70this chapter shows that demons were far morethan merely a useful rhetorical tool for Eusebius. On the contrary, itdemonstrates that Eusebius had a strikingly physical understandingof the demonic and also believedfirmly in demonic power and theability of demons to cause harm. It therefore argues that we need tomove beyond readings of Eusebius’demons simply as metaphors.The third chapter explores the implications of Eusebius’under-standing of demons for his broader cosmology. It shows that Eusebius’66Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’,3.67D. B. Martin,Inventing Superstition: From the Hippocratics to the Christians(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004), xi.68Martin,Inventing Superstition,x.69Brakke,Demons and the Making of the Monk,5.70Smith,‘How Thin?’.14The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"belief in a stark divide between the benevolent Christian God and themalevolent demons was reflected in a series of further polarizeddivisions in his thought. As a result, this chapter asks and answersthe question of whether or not Eusebius’cosmology should be char-acterized as‘dualistic’.From the fourth chapter onwards, we begin to engage with thoseaspects of Eusebius’thought that may be seen as more obviously‘political’. The fourth chapter itself offers an unprecedented study ofthe language of agency and responsibility in Eusebius’works. Itmoves beyond an anachronistic terminology of‘free will’to demon-strate the importance of the concept ofπροαίρεσις(loosely translated,‘choice’)71in Eusebius’understanding of moral responsibility. Inconsequence, we see the great importance which Eusebius attachedto the development of personal virtue in order to resist demonicattacks and achieve salvation. This chapter also sheds new light onEusebius’presentation of the problematicfigure of Licinius.Thefifth chapter addresses the role of demons in Eusebius’view ofsalvation history. Eusebius’understanding of the purpose of historyhas long been regarded as central to his perception of the events of hislifetime,72particularly to his view of the Roman Empire.73Thischapter suggests, however, that Eusebius’outlook was rather less‘sanguine’than scholars have generally believed.74Where scholarshave suggested in the past that Eusebius considered all demonicpower to have effectively ceased with the incarnation, this chapterfinds evidence that Eusebius believed demons still to be active in hisown time. This leads to a reconsideration of Eusebius’presentation ofthe role of the church and the empire in his works.Finally, the sixth chapter turns to those questions of sovereigntyand imperial virtue that have traditionally dominated work on Euse-bius’political thought. Rather than focusing on Eusebius’presenta-tion of Constantine, however, this chapter is primarily concernedwith Eusebius’presentation of tyranny. It shows that Eusebiusbelieved non-Christian rulers to be enslaved to malevolent demons,making them, in his view, incapable of governing. Moreover, it71The nuances of this term, and the difficulty of translating it, will be discussed inChapter 4.72See, for example: Hollerich,Eusebius’Commentary on Isaiah, 67; Wallace-Hadrill,Eusebius of Caesarea, 168–89; Ruhbach,‘Politische Theologie’, 236–58, 242.73Chesnut,First Christian Histories, 91.74Adler,‘Early Christian Historians and Historiography’, 596.Introduction15OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"suggests that, as a result of a multilayered process ofμίμησις(imita-tion), Eusebius believed impious tyranny to be, not merely unpleasantin practical terms, but morally corrupting and therefore damaging tohuman salvation. Lastly, it considers the implications of Eusebius’understanding of tyranny for his presentation of Constantine.Each chapter explores a slightly different aspect of Eusebius’thought, although definite connections between these various elem-ents emerge over the course of the book. Moreover, a clear picture ofEusebius is developed over the following chapters. It is a picture thatis at odds with the present scholarly consensus on Eusebius’optimis-tic outlook. While not wishing by any means to dismiss the positiveelements of Eusebius’thought, or to deny the profound relief withwhich he must surely have greeted Constantine’s patronage of thechurch, I would suggest that this side of Eusebius has been somewhatoveremphasized in the scholarship so far. It is time to rebalance ourcharacterization of Eusebius by recognizing that he also had doubts,fears, and hesitations. In the shifting political and religious climate ofthe early fourth century, such afigure is surely far more credible thanthe‘unreserved optimist’we have been presented with in the past.16The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"1Eusebius’WorksBefore turning to a full examination of Eusebius’ideas about demons,we must give some consideration to the nature of—and challengesposed by—the material in which those ideas were expressed. Eusebiuswas a prolific writer and a large number of his works survive, either infull, or in large parts. We also have extensive fragments of otherworks, and ancient translations of some of his writings which arenow lost in the original Greek. Eusebius’output was as varied as it wasextensive. His earliest works, dating from the last decade of the thirdcentury, andfirst decade of the fourth, were primarily pieces ofbiblical scholarship. Works such as theCanones EvangeliorumandtheChroniconwere innovative tools to aid understanding of thescriptures—theCanonespresented parallel passages of the gospelslaid out in clear tabular form,1while theChroniconsynchronizedvarious earlier dating systems, including those found in the Bible, inparallel columns to produce an overview of the chronology of thehuman past.2This interest in meticulous scholarship was one that1E.

TheOnomasticon(Onom.),3which as an account of biblical place names arranged in alphabeticalorder, was a similar aid to the study of the scriptures, and mostprobably dates from the 320s, or at least no earlier than 313.4Laterstill, Eusebius began to engage in detailed biblical exegesis, producingfrom the late 320s onwards commentaries on the books of Isaiah,5thePsalms,6and—disputedly—Luke.7However, Eusebius’interests also stretched far beyond biblicalscholarship. HisHistoria ecclesiastica(HE), widely regarded as thefirst history of the Christian church, has made him famous as anhistorian. He was also active in the theological disputes of his era. Inthefirst decade of the fourth century, he helped his imprisoned‘Eusebius’Chronicleand its Legacy’, in H. W. Attridge and G.

Orthat even some of those texts which do refer toδαίμονεςcontain onlybrief, passing references. To take only a couple of examples, theCMcontains no uses of the termδαίμων, while theDe eccl. theol.briefly mentionsδαίμονεςonce, and contains one further reference to‘demonic activity’.15Such gaps can be explained as the result of thedifferent purposes and audiences of Eusebius’various works. A textsuch as theOnom.offers little scope for discussion of the demonicand, unsurprisingly, contains only one, passing mention of Christ’shealing of those possessed by demons, in reference to the location ofGergesa in Mark 5:1.16Lengthy discussion of demons would quitesimply have been out of place in such a text.Nevertheless, demons appear in enough of Eusebius’works both todemonstrate that they formed an important part of his understandingof the universe and to provide a sound basis for study. Moreover, theyare not confined to one particular‘genre’of Eusebius’works, butappear throughout a range of writings, composed at various pointsthroughout his life. The works which have proved most useful for thisstudy are thePraeparatio Evangelica(PE),Demonstratio Evangelica(DE),HE, Vita Constantini(VC), andDe laudibus Constantini(LC).These works span thefields of panegyric, apologetic, biography, andhistory and were written over the course of three decades. Theynonetheless present a remarkably consistent picture of the demonicthreat, in spite of the dramatic political and religious changes thataffected the Roman Empire during the same period.This is significant, for some scholars have attempted in the past totie apparent changes in elements of Eusebius’thought, such hiseschatology or his political ideas, to external political and religiousdevelopments.17It has been suggested, for example, that Eusebius’15De eccl. theol.1.12.4.4 and 1.12.10.6 (ἐνεργείᾳδαιμονικῇ).

Moreover, since demons appear in arange of Eusebius’works, spanning a variety of‘genres’,itcannotbeclaimed that they were simply a literaryfeature of a particular type of text.If, however, we are to argue for the significance of demons inEusebius’thought partly on the basis that they appear in a range ofworks of various dates and‘genres’, we must acknowledge that, inmany cases, the date,‘genre’, and even authorship of several ofEusebius’works have been subject to considerable debate.

Eusebius is often regarded as something of a literaryinnovator20—indeed, he claims as much for himself.21If Eusebiuswas attempting to produce new and innovative works, this mightexplain the difficulty of assigning his writings to particular‘genres’.Yet Eusebius’originality should not be overstated. As David DeVorehas noted in the case of theHE, this work did not spring intoexistence from nowhere, independent of any prior literary tradition.22The same could also be said of many of Eusebius’other works.However hard he strove to be original, Eusebius could not help butbe influenced by existing works and the prior expectations of hisaudience. As a result, theVChas been described as‘a literaryhybrid’,23while even DeVore’s attempt to encourage a more con-sidered discussion of the‘genre’of theHEresulted in the conclusionthat this text combines elements of‘heresiology, apology...martyrdrama...[and] national, war, and intellectual historiography’,24demonstrating the difficulty of describing the‘genre’of such workswith any precision.Moreover, for some scholars, Eusebius’works have far too much incommon to allow them to be assigned to separate‘genres’. SharronCoggan, for instance, felt that all of Eusebius’works could be cat-egorized as a form of apologetic.25Michael Frede similarly questionedwhy, on a broad understanding of the term‘apologetic’, a treatisesuch as Eusebius’Quaestiones Evangelicaeshould not be classifiedas an apology.26In large part, this surely reflects more widespreadscholarly uncertainty about where to draw the boundaries of an‘apologetic genre’.27Recent scholarship has come to see the20For example: Cameron and Hall,Life of Constantine, 26; Burgess,Studies inEusebian Chronography, 73; Johnson,‘Introduction’, in Johnson and Schott, eds.,Eusebius: Tradition and Innovations, 11; Verdoner,Narrated Reality, 1, 4; Cameron,‘Rethinking’, 82; Cameron,‘Form and Meaning’, 72.21For example at:HE1.1.3;LC Prol.2;PE1.3.5.22DeVore,‘Genre’, 19.23Cameron and Hall,Life of Constantine, 27.24DeVore,‘Genre’,44–5.25Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’, 17.26M.

Indeed, several scholars have deniedthe existence of a clear-cut‘apologetic genre’altogether.28AverilCameron, for instance, suggested that apologetics represent,‘not agenre but a tone or method of argument’.29Frances Young likewisedistinguished between the‘surface-genre’and the‘apologetic charac-ter’of various works written in defence of the Christian faith duringthe second century, similarly implying that‘apologetics’should notbe seen as afixed genre.30This, indeed, is in line with Eusebius’own use of the termἀπολογία(apology). While Eusebius’use of the term at times appears to refer to anarrow group of works addressed to Roman emperors and governorsin defence of Christianity, in other cases, he adopts a broader under-standing of the term.31For instance, Frede notes that the only one ofEusebius’works which he himself expressly referred to as an‘apology’,theApologia pro Origene,32is‘not an apologetic writing even in anextended sense, since it does not involve a response to an attack onChristianity, or on a Christian on account of his Christianity’.33Thus itappears that, in Eusebius’usage,ἀπολογίαcould refer to a range of textsfar wider than that traditionally classified by scholars as Christianapologetics. We should therefore avoid trying to identify particularfeatures of an‘apologetic genre’, but recognize instead that, for earlyChristian works, a variety of different literary forms could share acommon apologetic purpose.As the validity of the concept of an‘apologetic genre’has beenquestioned, so too has the assumption that the purpose of apologetics28For example: Cameron,‘Apologetics’, 219–27, esp. 223; F. Young,‘GreekApologists of the Second Century’, in Edwards, Goodman, and Price,Apologetics inthe Roman Empire,90–1; M. Edwards, M. Goodman, S. Price, and C.

Cameronsuggested that‘one function of apologetic has clearly to do with thesearch for identity and self-definition’,34arguing that the writing ofapologetic did not cease with the apparent triumph of the church underConstantine, but continued long into the fourth century in the genresof biblical commentary and exegesis.35Aaron Johnson has similarlyargued that early Christian apologetic literature was‘fundamentallyabout the formation of identity’,36and has expertly highlighted the keyrole played by questions of‘ethnic’identity in one of Eusebius’major‘apologetic’writings, thePE.37Thus, apologetics could have in view anaudience as much of‘insiders’as of those hostile either to Christianityor to a particular version of it.38When we adopt this broader under-standing of the nature and purpose of apologetic literature, it becomesclear that Coggan and Frede were right to see much of the Eusebiancorpus as sharing a common apologetic thread.Even so, noting the similarity of purpose between Eusebius’works,whilst valuable, only takes us so far.39To appreciate Eusebius’thought,we need also to recognize that, in order to achieve his apologetic goals,Eusebius produced a variety of very different works. These were oftenapparently aimed at slightly different audiences and make differentpoints, albeit in support of the same overarching goals of shapingChristian identity and promoting the Christian message, as it appearedto Eusebius. These differences could have an effect both on whatEusebius chose to say in each work, and on how he chose to say it.40There are therefore clear differences of emphasis between many of hisworks. We can only begin to appreciate what effect such differencesmight have had on his presentation of his political and demonological34Cameron,‘Apologetics’, 223. See also: A. K.

In some cases, such as that of theVC, these debates have now settled into a broad scholarly consensus.In others, particularly that of theHE, the debate remains very muchalive. It is beyond the scope of this book to offer definitive conclusionson all the debates concerning the composition of Eusebius’works—although my views on a number of questions may be inferred fromthe chronological table at the beginning of this book. I will thereforefocus solely on those questions which are of greatest relevance to thearguments that follow in subsequent chapters.Historia EcclesiasticaTheHEis arguably Eusebius’most famous work;41it is also one of themost challenging for scholars to date, as it appeared in several editions—the exact number is disputed42—over the course of at least a decade.It survives in an edition of ten books,43and covers the history ofthe church from its beginning with Christ to the events of Eusebius’41The edition used here is: Eusebius,Die Kirchengeschichte: Uber die Martyrer inPalestina, ed. E. Schwartz,Eusebius WerkeII: i–iii, GCS 9 (Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs,1903–9).42Barnes, for instance, argues for four distinct editions:C&E,149–50. Tab-bernee suggests three or four editions, thefirst dating fromc.313–14, and thefourth simply removing references to Constantine’s disgraced son Crispus in 326.Tabbernee also suggests afirst, unpublished draft of theHEfrom before 303:Tabbernee,‘Eusebius’“Theology of Persecution”’.Burgessarguesfortwoedi-tions:‘Dates and Editions’.

It is often regarded as a groundbreaking work,44thebeginning of a genre of ecclesiastical history that would be continuedby Eusebius’fifth-century successors.45In his preface to the work,Eusebius emphasized that he was attempting to produce somethingnew, describing himself as‘thefirst to set upon this purpose’.46Thefirst seven books of theHEcover the period up to Eusebius’lifetime,including an extended discussion of the life of Origen in book 6.47Book 8 describes the events of the persecution that began in 303,overlapping significantly in terms of content with another of Eusebius’works, theDe martyribus Palaestinae(Mart. Pal.).48In three of itsmanuscripts, book 8 also contains a section known as theAppendix,49which covers the gruesome deaths of the persecuting emperors. In book9 the work addresses the end of the persecution, the defeat of thepersecutors, and the victory of the Christian emperors Constantineand Licinius. Thefinal book celebrates the success of the churchfollowing this victory and consists in large part of a speech whichEusebius delivered at the dedication of the Church at Tyre in 315,50aswell as a variety of documents showing Constantine’s favour towardsthe church. The later chapters of this book were evidently added afterConstantine’s defeat of Licinius in 324, as they outline the actions whichEusebius suggests had brought Licinius to destruction.51Thefinal, revised edition of theHEwas clearly completed shortlyafter Licinius’defeat in 324;52however, the question of the date, and44G.

The tenth book can only have been added after 315,since it is made up largely of a speech which Eusebius delivered inthat year.63This book was then extended sometime after 324 toaddress the defeat of Licinius.Establishing even a broad outline of the dates of these editions isessential to any assessment of the purpose and character of theHE,asmany of those involved in these debates have recognized.64Giving anearly date to thefirst edition of theHEallowed Barnes to present itas evidence of the church’s position immediately prior to the out-break of the Diocletianic persecution,65revealing‘the optimisticassumptions of a Christian’in this period of comparative peace forthe church.66By contrast, the later date ofc.313, after the persecu-tion, sets the work in a completely different context and forces us,in Burgess’phrase, to look at it‘in the light of...propagandaand apologetic, not of confidence, peace and pure scholarship’.67Burgess is by no means the only scholar to have identified a strongapologetic element in theHE, with A.

The arguments in favour of seeing this work as twodifferent orations have been convincingly set out by H. A.

As one work, Drakesuggests that it is far too long to have been delivered as a singlespeech—a problem which disappears once it is seen as two separateorations.88Drake acknowledges the possibility that the speech mighthave been rewritten and extended for publication, but doubts thatEusebius would have had the time to enlarge the work so substantiallybetween delivering the speech in 336 and his death in 339, given theamount of other work, including theVC, which he was producing atthe same time.89Furthermore, in several of the manuscripts of theorations there is evidence of a gap between chapters 10 and 11,90while some manuscripts only contain thefirst part of the orations.91These two parts are clearly distinct in terms of style and content, witheach part comfortably able to stand alone as an independent work.9285Eusebius,Uber das Leben Constantins, Constantins Rede an die Heilige Ver-sammlung, Tricennatsrede an Constantin, ed.

Thefirst part is theLC, deliveredin celebration of the emperor’stricennalia, most likely in July 336.95The second part has been identified instead as the speech whichEusebius gave at the dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchrein Jerusalem in September 335,96and labelled by Drake theDesepulchro Christi(SC).97As two different speeches, these workswould clearly have had different audiences. The audience of theSCwould surely have consisted in large part of the bishops and other layChristians who might be expected to have attended the dedicationof a new church and Drake suggests a largely clerical audience onthe basis of references atSC17.6 and 17.11.98The possibility thatthe audience might also have contained important pagans cannotbe discounted either.99As Drake has noted, however, the internalsituation within the church in 335 was‘theologically charged’, withthe dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre closely followingthe Council of Tyre, at which Eusebius’opponent Athanasius hadbeen excommunicated.100As a result, even if speaking mainly toChristians or even to clerics, Eusebius need not have been addressingan entirely sympathetic audience.93Barnes,‘Two Speeches’, 342;SC11.2.94VC4.46.1.95Drake and Barnes both reject the traditional dating of July 335 in favour ofdelivery at the closing festivities of the tricennial year, in July 336: Barnes,‘TwoSpeeches’, 343; H. A. Drake,‘When was theDe Laudibus ConstantiniDelivered?’,Historia24 (1975), 345–56. The most compelling reason for opting for the later date isEusebius’reference in theLCto‘four Caesars’(LC3.4). This means that Dalmatiusmust already have been made Caesar at the time when the oration was delivered. SinceDalmatius only became Caesar in September 335, that puts theLC, at the earliest,sometime after then: Drake,‘When was theLCDelivered?’, 347.96Drake,‘Introduction’, 31; Barnes,‘Two Speeches’, 343.

Cam-eron and Hall therefore suggest that the account given in theVCofthe war between Constantine and Licinius should be understood inthis apologetic light.123Consequently, it is unnecessary to see thepresentation of this war as arising from the misunderstanding of alater writer, as Grégoire had imagined.124Moreover, Cameron andHall refute the idea that parts of theVCwere the result of laterinterpolation by pointing to the consistency of the work’s style, notingas well that it is difficult to believe a later writer could have imitatedEusebius’distinctive tone so successfully.125There remains,finally,the fact that in all its manuscripts theVCis consistently attributed toEusebius.126As a result, the Eusebian authorship of this work is nowgenerally accepted,127and discussion has turned instead to questionsabout its‘genre’and purpose.118Grégoire,‘Eusèbe n’est pas l’auteur’, 582.119Grégoire,‘Eusèbe n’est pas l’auteur’.120Grégoire,‘Eusèbe n’est pas l’auteur’, 578.121Cameron and Hall,Life of Constantine, 2.

Smith have identified the influence of theSecond Sophistic in other works by Eusebius, the authenticity ofwhich has never been questioned. Jones notes several parallelsbetween the language of theCHand book 6 of thePE,154whileSmith points to Second Sophistic techniques in the panegyric onthe dedication of the Church at Tyre which is preserved in book 10of theHE.155Moreover, Borzi has drawn attention to the similarity oftheme and expression between chapters 45–7 of theCH, and book 6of thePE.156A further point raised by Hägg is that Eusebius does not quotefrom the Bible in theCH, which Hägg regards as a significantdeparture from Eusebius’usual style.157However, Eusebius did notuse direct biblical quotations in hisLCeither and scholars haveremarked on the largely classical language of that oration.158Asworks like theLCdemonstrate, Eusebius was adept at adjusting hisstyle to suit his audience. The absence of biblical citation in theCHtherefore cannot be taken as proof that the work is not Eusebian.Thirdly, Hägg notes that Eusebius does not refer to theCH, or quotefrom it, in his other works.159It is true that Eusebius tended to referback to his other works where relevant. However, this is by nomeans conclusive—if nothing else, a large number of Eusebius’other works have been lost, meaning that possible cross-referencesto theCHcould also have been lost.

However, its discussion of fate andpersonal freedom means it is of interest in the context of Chapter 4. Inview of the doubts that continue to surround the work’s authorship,I have sought to avoid basing any arguments solely on the evidence oftheCH. However, where appropriate, I have drawn attention tothemes and passages in the work that demonstrate similar concernsto passages in Eusebius’other writings, particularly thePE. As willbecome clear, there is considerable similarity between some of theviews expressed by Eusebius in book 6 of thePEand the discussion offate in thefinal chapters of theCH—a fact that might itself also pointto Eusebian authorship for theCH.METHODOLOGICAL QUESTIONSThis discussion has highlighted, if nothing else, the extraordinaryvariety to be found within the Eusebian corpus. Eusebius’works notonly spanned a remarkably lengthy chronological period, but alsotook a range of forms, addressing different audiences in differentways. This poses an undoubted challenge to anyone seeking tounderstand his thought. There remains a danger that, in trying toextract Eusebius’ideas from a range of texts that may originally havehad very different purposes, we may be tempted to overlook orsmooth over inconsistencies in order to produce a coherent pictureof his views.This challenge is hardly unique to Eusebius. It has already beenraised by scholars in relation to other late antique writers.161PeterBrown noted the importance of terminology when discussing thethought of ancient writers, preferring the term‘attitude’to refer to160Hägg,‘Hierocles the Lover of Truth’, 150.

Again in the caseof Augustine, Brown recognized that a‘historian...must resignhimself, as best he can, to living with this ambivalence’.166Thereare lacunae in Eusebius’thought just as there are in his works, and wemust not try tofill those gaps.Brown also drew an important distinction between seeing a writer’s‘thought as a whole’and trying‘to make it seem consistent’.167Thiswill be a crucial distinction for this study. By surveying the ideas putforward by Eusebius in a range of works composed over a number ofyears, we are attempting to form a full picture of his thought in all itsvariety. That is very different from trying to pull together his differentideas and mould them into an intellectually satisfying‘political phil-osophy’. There are areas of consistency in Eusebius’thought—we162Brown,‘Augustine’s Attitude’, 107.163Dvornik,Political PhilosophyII.164As S.

Eusebius’basic cosmology does notappear to have been altered by the changing situation of the church.However, rather than joining these scholars in seeing Eusebius as aperennial triumphalist,170the conclusions drawn later in this bookwill suggest, to the contrary, that it is time to reassess our assumptionsabout the optimistic mind-set of this, supposedly familiar,figure.The following chapters will reveal instead a more cautiousfigure,arguing that Eusebius continued throughout his lifetime to demon-strate concern about potential challenges to the‘orthodox’teaching ofthe church and about the possibility of Christians straying from thepath of virtue.168On this, see Chapter 5, this volume.169For example,C&E, 164; Johnson,Ethnicity and Argument, 156.170For instance,C&E, 102; Johnson,‘The Blackness of Ethiopians’, 167; Johnson,‘The Ends of Transfiguration’, 196, n.23.42The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"2The Nature of Demonic ThreatsA study that seeks to explore the role played by Eusebius’ideas of thedemonic in his political thought must be based on a reasonablyfirmunderstanding of what those ideas were. However, despite frequentreferences to demons in many of Eusebius’works, there has as yetbeen no thorough study of his discussions of the demonic throughout arange of his works. While Eusebius’evident interest in the subject ofdemons has not entirely escaped the attention of earlier scholars, previ-ous work on the topic is either clearly outdated,1or limited in scope.2In the past, scholarship on Eusebius has tended to treat his ideasabout demons only briefly, if at all.3In such cases, the discussion hasbeen largely restricted to only one or two of Eusebius’works, mostoften thePraeparatio Evangelica(PE) andDemonstratio Evangelica(DE).4This may be understandable, since these works contain by farthe fullest and most detailed of Eusebius’descriptions of demons,5butit is nonetheless unfortunate, for such a heavy focus on these apolo-gies leads to an imbalanced picture of Eusebius’thought in this area.For instance, Jean Sirinelli was led to suggest that the primary pur-pose of Eusebius’discussions of demons was‘to explain pagan error’.61For example: Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’; Chesnut,First Christian Histories,59–60,124–9.2For example: Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’; Johnson,Ethnicity and Argument, 163–70;Sirinelli,Les vues historiques, 312–26, 337–8; Martin,Inventing Superstition, 207–25;Morlet,LaDémonstration Évangélique, 470.3The exception is Coggan’s PhD thesis:‘Pandaemonia’.

Moreover, much of the previous work that touches—however briefly—on Eusebius’views of the demonic predates theimportant work of Gregory Smith. Smith’s work has done muchto improve our understanding of late antique and early Christianthinking on the demonic, and has emphasized in particular the import-ance of acknowledging the physicality of demons in the eyes of lateantique writers.In order to achieve a full and balanced picture of Eusebius’views ofdemons, we need to look beyond the discussions of thePEandDEand to take into account references to demons throughout a range ofhis works. Yet even when adopting a broader perspective whichencompasses a variety of Eusebius’works, it remains a challengingtask to establish with any clarity what Eusebius’view of demons was.Despite the abundance of references to the demonic throughoutEusebius’works, he in fact provides us with little in the way of acoherent or systematic‘demonology’. Heidi Marx-Wolf has describedthe writing of demonology in late antiquity as a process of‘systematiza-tion’, in which intellectuals sought to impose order on the wide range ofpopular beliefs about the demonic.7This idea that demonology wasabout systematizing and classifying the demonic can also be found instudies of later demonologies—for instance, the idea that demonologywas about asserting control through‘astructureofclassification’formsa key part of David Frankfurter’s understanding of the term.8While it is open to question how far any demonological writingswere ever purely systematic explorations of the nature of the demonic,9on this understanding of the term‘demonology’, none of Eusebius’works could accurately be described as purely, or even primarily,‘demonological’.10We must remember that Eusebius’accounts of7H.

Even brief and scatteredreferences to demons can reveal a great deal about Eusebius’under-standing of the demonic. Such references can show some of the waysin which he believed them to act, or highlight details of their relationswith humankind.Overall, when remarks about the demonic throughout a range ofEusebius’works are taken into consideration, a reasonably clearpicture emerges of his views. Of course there are gaps, and even attimes apparent contradictions—this is hardly surprising given thatEusebius’aim was not specifically to elaborate his views of demons.Even so, the frequency of Eusebius’references to the demonic isenough to demonstrate the important role that they occupied in hisunderstanding of the world. This chapter will show that Eusebius sawdemons as an active and dangerous presence in the universe, that hebelieved them to live in close proximity to humankind and to be aforce for evil, seeking to derail human salvation. In the past, somescholars have regarded Eusebius’references to demons as littlemore than a useful literary or rhetorical device.12By contrast,this chapter will suggest that such an approach underestimatesthe significance of the demonic threat for Eusebius. Like many ofhisera,Eusebiusappearstohavebelievedfirmly in demons as anactive, physical presence. It is only by acknowledging this that wecan come to appreciate fully the role which demons played inhis thought. This chapter willfirst explore Eusebius’views onthe physical nature of demons, before moving on to consider hisopinion of their moral character, and his understanding of theirpowers. It will argue that, for Eusebius, demons represented apotent threat, against which all Christians needed to remain con-stantly on their guard.11PE1.5.11–13.12For example: Chesnut,First Christian Histories,59–60, 128.The Nature of Demonic Threats45OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE DEMONOLOGICAL CONTEXTIn speculating about the nature and activities of demons, Eusebiuswas far from alone among late antique and early Christian writers.Demons played a prominent role in the works of many early Chris-tian writers, yet they were by no means an exclusively Christianconcept, and thinking about the demonic had a long history amongGreek and Jewish writers.13The extensive quotations on the subjectof demons in thePEandDE, which have been drawn from a variety ofthinkers,14attest both to the strength of this tradition of thinkingabout demons, and to the range of possible influences on Eusebius’own views about the demonic. Since the surviving ancient literatureon the demonic is so extensive, it will be necessary to confine our-selves here to brief discussion only of those writers whose views ondemons appear to have exercised the greatest influence on Eusebius’own ideas—Porphyry and Origen.Despite the difference in their religious positions, there are somestriking similarities between the views which these two writersexpressed on demons, as indeed there were between the viewsof other Neoplatonist and Christian writers of the period.15From13The bibliography on the development of Jewish and early Christian ideas aboutdemons and the devil is now considerable.

By the third century, however, there had been a markedshift in perceptions of the demonic. By this period, wefind bothChristian and non-Christian philosophers arguing that there wereovertly wicked demons, responsible for much human suffering.18One such philosopher was Porphyry, a Neoplatonist and opponentof Christianity. Given Porphyry’s staunch anti-Christian views—histreatiseContra Christianosis now lost, but was successful enough towarrant a full-length rebuttal from Eusebius19—it may seem surpris-ing that Eusebius cites Porphyry extensively on the subject of demonsin thePE. While Eusebius goes to considerable lengths to refute manyof Porphyry’s arguments, there are nevertheless some striking areas ofagreement. For instance, in thePEEusebius agrees with the rejectionof animal sacrifice advocated in Porphyry’s treatisede Abstinentia.20Although much of Porphyry’s extensiveoeuvreis now either lost orhighly fragmentary, enough remains of his work to permit a reason-ably detailed reconstruction of his views on a range of subjects,including demons.21The most valuable text for understandingPorphyry’s views on demons is the four-volumede Abstinentia.2216For the history and development of Platonic ideas about demons, see:A.

Although both good and bad demons are said tobe imperceptible to humans because they lack a‘firm body’(στερεὸνσῶμα), good demons are said to be‘in symmetry’(ἐν συμμετρίᾳ),while bad demons are not.28Moreover, bad demons, Porphyry sug-gests, take nourishment from animal sacrifices, growing fat (πιαίνεται)on the blood andflesh of the slaughtered animals.29This interest in the physicality of wicked demons was not unique toPorphyry; as Gregory Smith has shown, discussion of the physicalform and bodily needs of demons recurs throughout a number of lateantique texts by Christian as well as non-Christian writers.30It is aninterest wefind reflected in the discussions of Origen. According toOrigen, the bodies of demons are‘naturally delicate, andfine like air’,as a result of which they are often said—mistakenly in Origen’sview—to be‘incorporeal’.31Just like Porphyry, Origen also suggeststhat demons feed on‘the meaty smells and bloods and vapours ofsacrifices’.32They are, moreover, said to be responsible for such evilsas famine, crop failure, and plague.33Nevertheless, while there are some evident similarities between theviews of Origen and Porphyry, there are also some significant areas ofdisagreement, the most striking of which is Origen’s refusal to accept23Porph.Abst.2.37.24Porph.Abst. 2.38.25Porph.Abst.2.38.26Porph.Abst.2.38.27Porph.Abst.2.40.28Porph.Abst.2.39.29Porph.Abst. 2.42.30Smith,‘How Thin?’.31Origen,de Principiis, Praef.8.32Origen,Contra Celsum, 7.35.33Orig.Cels.8.31.48The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"the existence of good demons. For Origen,‘demon’signifies a beingthat has departed from the way of God—these creatures were notoriginally created wicked and thus were not atfirst‘demons’. Rather,they became demons in the process of falling away from God.34Moreover, Origen’s demons occupy a very clearly defined positionwithin a spiritual hierarchy. For Origen, a creature’s wickedness anddistance from God are dependent upon the extent of its initial fall.35For Origen, there are different beings located at various points along acontinuum away from God. According to Origen, demons have fallenthe furthest—further than humans, who in turn have fallen furtherthan angels.36Thus Origen’s demons, although physically similar toPorphyry’s, are nevertheless understood as part of a distinctivelyChristian cosmology.Many of the ideas expressed by both Porphyry and Origen are onesthat wefind reappearing in Eusebius’discussions of demons. In thecase of Origen, this is perhaps not surprising—Eusebius’high regardfor Origen has long been recognized.37In the case of Porphyry,however, it is more remarkable, especially since Eusebius devotesconsiderable energy to refuting many of Porphyry’s ideas in thePE.What such similarities demonstrate is that belief in demons was by nomeans unusual or idiosyncratic in the period when Eusebius waswriting. On the contrary, demons were an entirely acceptable partof high theological and philosophical discussion, and there wereseveral ideas, particularly about the physicality of demons, that wereheld in common by those of different religious views.38It will beimportant to remember, as we examine how Eusebius’politicalviews are intertwined with his ideas about demons, that much ofwhat he wrote about demons in themselves was neither original nor34Orig.Cels.7.69.35Origen,de Princ.1.8.4, 2.9.2.36See Orig.de Princ. 1.5.1–5 and, for discussion of Origen’s cosmology:E.

It is clear from his remarks on this subject that Eusebiusconsidered the realm of the demonic to be closely connected to thehuman world. Demons, in his view, were corporeal, albeit invisible,beings, who participated in events in the earthly realm. Demons werethus not abstract‘personifications’,42or even a distant and obscureelement of the universe for Eusebius. Rather, they were an activepresence in the recognizable everyday world which he and his readersinhabited. In order to understand Eusebius’attitude towards thedemonic, and in particular if we are to appreciate the severity ofthe demonic threat in his eyes, it is necessary to highlight this aspectof his thought on the subject.Although Eusebius did not discuss the nature of demonic bodies tothe same extent as, for instance, Origen had done, it is clear evenfrom his few scattered references to the subject that he shared manyof these assumptions about the physical nature of demons. In theVC, Eusebius refers to sacrifices as‘demonic festivals’(δαιμονικὰς39A problem which Smith highlights:‘How Thin?’, esp. 479–83.40Smith,‘How Thin?’, 496.41Smith,‘How Thin?’, 483.42Chesnut suggested that demons in Eusebius’works were the‘personification’ofφθόνος:First Christian Histories, 128.50The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"ἑορτάς),43and elsewhere describes‘those wicked demons which,lurking in images and sunk into dark corners, covet the libationsand fatty smoke of sacrifices’.44Crucially, Eusebius also believed thesephysical demons to live in places very close to humans. Demons, heasserts,‘are near the earth and subterranean, and wander aboutthe heavy and misty air about the earth and...are fond of inhabitingthe tombs and memorials of the dead’.45Although people cannot seethese demons, Eusebius suggests that‘spreading great error, chthonicand demonic beings, invisible to us, areflying about the air aroundthe earth, unknown and indistinct to men’.46Thus Eusebius’demonseffectively surround human beings, inhabiting the spaces above,below, and among them. The human and demonic realms are envis-aged as existing in close proximity to each other.As well as situating demons within a recognizable human world ofgraves, temples, and sacrificial rituals, Eusebius alsofirmly roots hisdemons within historical time. In his accounts of the human past,Eusebius gives demons an active and intimate role in the events hebelieved to have unfolded. He suggests, for instance, that traditionalGreek and Roman polytheistic worship is to be attributed to themalign influence of demons.47In this, of course, Eusebius was hardlyoriginal among early Christian writers. The idea that the pagan godswere in reality demons appears in the Psalms—in his own discussionof demons, Eusebius quotes the idea found in Psalm 95(96).5 that‘allthe gods of the nations are demons’.48A similar idea recurs in theletters of Paul, who wrote that‘what pagans sacrifice, they sacrifice todemons and not to God’.49Picking up on this scriptural idea, wefindseveral Christian apologists making the same point. Like Eusebius,Origen had earlier drawn attention to Psalm 95(96),50while JustinMartyr wrote that, in the past, people‘not understanding that they43VC3.48.2. Compare:Mart. Pal.[SR] 4.8.44SC13.4.

In theDE, Eusebiussuggests that polytheism had not been the original form of worship,even among people who had not been capable of recognizing thetrue God.52Rather, Eusebius suggests that God had set up some ofhis angels to watch over these people, permitting them a simple formof astral worship instead.53This, Eusebius suggests, was intendedto bring them as close to true worship as was possible for them, byallowing them devotion to the most beautiful elements of God’screation.54However, this early human state was then, in Eusebius’view, undermined by the activity of the devil and his demons, whodrew these people away from the worship of the stars towards a lessmoral and less pious polytheism.55As part of this historical sketch,Eusebius shows humankind as suffering the effects of a higher, cosmicbattle between God and his demonic adversaries: the demons chal-lenge God by undermining his plans for humankind. Their rebellionagainst God takes the form of subjugating humankind to their ownrule, thereby jeopardizing humankind’s salvation.56Likewise, when Eusebius writes of the beginnings of a decline indemonic power in thePE, he again places itfirmly within a recog-nizable historical framework. Describing the end of the practice ofhuman sacrifice, which he considered to be a manifestation of demo-nic influence, he even goes so far as to give it a precise date in thereign of Hadrian.57This date appears to be based on a reference atPorphyry’sde Abstinentia2.56.3, which Eusebius cites atPE4.16.7.58Here Porphyry mentions a statement by the writer Pallas, working inthe reign of Hadrian, who claimed that the practice of human sacrificehad been almost entirely abolished by that time. Eusebius picks up onthis claim, butfinds a new significance in the timing, pointing out that51Justin Martyr,First Apology5.2.

Onceagain, the choice of this date is not Eusebius’own, but is based onreferences to Tiberius within Plutarch’s story.61However, atPE5.17.13, Eusebius does draw particular attention to what he con-sidered the significance of this date to be—the fact that the reign ofTiberius was the time of Christ’s activity on earth. In both cases,Eusebius makes a connection—entirely absent from these earliersources—between the spread of Christianity and the decline ofdemonic influence. Describing both the emergence and the declineof demonic influence, Eusebius therefore places them within a struc-tured, linear historical framework. Eusebius’interweaving of cosmicand human stories is not left in the abstract; rather, hefirmly groundscosmic events in what he considered to be traceable human history.It is further worth noting that the demons in Eusebius’works areconsistently depicted as an external force. This is significant because,while demons were often envisioned in very physical terms, especiallyin later antiquity, this was not the only way in which they might beconceived. As Andrei Timotin has recently shown, speculation on thenature of Socrates’δαίμων, as described by Plato, led Middle Platon-ists like Plutarch and Apuleius to develop the notion that the phil-osopher might be guided in leading a virtuous life by a higher, morespiritual,‘demonic’part of the soul—in effect, a‘guardian’demonlinked to the individual human soul.62Among early Christian andJewish writers of thefirst three centuriesCE, this idea began toencompass the notion of two personal demons, one good and onebad, which were continually vying to control the direction of each59PE4.15.6.60Eusebius quotes Plutarch,De Defectu Oraculorum418E–419F to support hispoint (PE5.17.1–12). For a detailed discussion of Eusebius’treatment of this passageof Plutarch, see: Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’. Coggan’s thesis focuses on the way in whichEusebius used this passage as part of his apologetic attack on traditional paganreligion. Using this passage effectively as a case study, she considers the way inwhich Eusebius altered the meaning of traditionally ambiguous terms such asΠὰνandδαίμωνto make their meaning exclusively negative.61Plut.De Defect.

If there are good thoughts in our heart and righteousnessgrows in our soul, no doubt it is an angel of the Lord who speaks to us.If, indeed, bad thoughts are moving in our heart, it is an angel of thedevil who speaks to us.65In this context, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that writersmight have been using the notion of demons or angels to understandor describe aspects of human psychology. Nor was such a use ofthe concept of the angel or demon incompatible with a more physicalview of the demonic realm as well, for Origen also entertainedstrikingly physical ideas about demons’bodies.66However, this ideaof personal or guardian demons is not one that wefind emphasized inEusebius.This contrasts with the recent suggestion, based on a passage in theDE, that Eusebius did believe all Christians to have a permanent,guardian angel.67In the passage in question, Eusebius writes:‘so thatmen on earth would not be without leaders and inspectors likeirrational creatures, [God] established heavenly angels as their guard-ians and curators, like leaders of a herd and shepherds’.68However,63Timotin,La démonologie platonicienne, 271–2.64Timotin,La démonologie platonicienne, 272–3.

A similar idea is expressed in Porphyry’sCommentary on the Timaeus(fr. 17 Sodano). As there is no direct intertext, we should be cautious about positingdirect influence here. Nevertheless, the appearance of this idea in Porphyry’s work, aswell as in the works of writers like Eusebius and Origen, illustrates the point that therewas much common ground between Christian and non-Christian demonologicaldiscourse.54The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Eusebius does not mention‘Christians’at all here.

Moreimportantly, Eusebius’reference to angels acting like‘shepherds’suggests that he envisaged the angels watching over large groups ofpeople, rather than being assigned to each individual. Finally, thispassage is immediately followed by a quotation of Deuteronomy32:7–9, in which, according to the Septuagint version, it is saidthat God divided the human nations between the‘angels of God’(ἀγγέλων Θεοῦ).69This passage should therefore be read as a refer-ence, not to the notion of‘guardian angels’, but rather to the ideaof the‘angels of the nations’, also found in Origen, according towhich God had arranged for different angels to supervise the varioushuman nations.70Since Eusebius accorded the notion of personal demons such littleattention, despite its appearance in the work of Origen, we shouldbe particularly cautious before attempting to read Eusebius’demonsin any‘psychological’or‘internal’way. Eusebius’emphasis is ondemons as a physical, external presence and, as a result, this is howwe must principally attempt to treat them.WICKED DEMONSFor Eusebius, demons were not simply a physical presence, but adangerous one too. That all demons were a threat to be both fearedand if possible avoided is central to Eusebius’conception of thedemonic. In thePE, the point about demons which Eusebiusmakes most insistently is that there can be no such thing as a gooddemon,71thereby distancing himself from the view of contemporarynon-Christian philosophers like Porphyry.72On this point, he makesit clear that there is no room for doubt, asserting that‘our divinesayings never name any demon at all as good’.73As Coggan has69DE4.7.1.70Blanc,‘L’angelologie d’Origène’,88–92, citing Orig.Cels.5.30;Hom. in Luc.35.8;de Princ.3.2–3.

Thus,in redefining the word as he does, Eusebius is making clear to his74Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’, iii. Coggan’s thesis focuses on the way in whichEusebius transforms the meanings of the wordsΠὰνandδαίμωνas part of hisapologetic approach in thePE.Seealso:A.Mendelson,‘Eusebius and the Posthu-mous Career of Apollonius of Tyana’, in Attridge and Hata, eds.,Eusebius, Chris-tianity and Judaism, 518.75PE4.5.4.76Plato,Cratylus398b. As Riley also noted:‘Demon’, 445. Riley, however, believesthat the‘most likely’etymology of the wordδαίμωνis not that of either Plato orEusebius. Instead, he suggests that it came from the wordδαίω, meaning‘to divide(destinies)’, and thus referred to‘the spirit controlling one’s fate’, 445. Clearly,however, neither Plato nor Eusebius had this in mind, but instead found etymologiesfor the word that best suited their own understanding of the nature of demons.77Eusebius expresses his general admiration for Plato, albeit with some reserva-tions, atPE11.Praef.5, 13.13.66.78Plat.Cra.397c.79Plat.Cra.398b.56The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"readership the distance that lies between the traditional Greek view ofthe demonic and his own, recognizably Christian, view. At the sametime, he is also drawing attention to one of the most significantaspects of his view of the demonic—the idea that they are to be feared.To support his argument about the malevolence of demons in thePE, Eusebius draws, as so often, on the works of earlier writers,exploiting areas of common ground, but also at times using theirown arguments against them. In his discussion of demons in book 4of thePE, Eusebius makes particularly extensive use of some ofPorphyry’s works, most notably thede Abstinentia.80With its con-demnation of the practice of animal sacrifice, thede Abstinentiacontains several areas in which Eusebius might easilyfind himselfin agreement with Porphyry, and Eusebius in fact brings these to thereader’s attention. Introducing his discussion of thede Abstinentia,Eusebius even goes so far as to suggest that Porphyry had been‘movedby correct reason’in his basic argument against sacrifice,81and lateragrees with Porphyry that sacrifice is‘profane, unjust, and hurtful’.82However, having established this area of common ground by usinglengthy quotations from Porphyry’s own text to condemn sacrificialpractices, Eusebius then launches an immediate challenge to the partof Porphyry’s argument with which he disagrees: the suggestion thatsacrifices are offered to‘demons, either good or bad’, rather than tothe gods.83Agreeing that sacrifices are not offered to the true God,but only to demons,84Eusebius then uses Porphyry’s own argumentsabout the unholy nature of animal sacrifice to suggest that no goodbeing would require such a practice.85As such, Eusebius argues,sacrificial cults could never have been demanded by good demons,but only by the wicked.86Rather than condemning Porphyry’s viewsoutright, and thereby perhaps asking his readers to reject entirely theideas about demons which they might have held prior to theirconversion to Christianity,87Eusebius instead uses these views as afoundation on which to build his own arguments. His focus is onhighlighting the key area of difference between the Christian view ofthe demonic and the Neoplatonic view expressed by Porphyry—thatis, the moral character of demons.80As, for example, at:PE4.11.1–12.1, 4.14.1–9, 4.16.1–9, 4.18.1–19.2, 4.22.1–12.81PE4.10.1.82PE4.14.10.83PE4.15.1.84PE4.14.10.85PE4.14.10–4.15.4.86PE4.14.10–4.15.4.87See also on Justin Martyr: Reed,Fallen Angels, 186.The Nature of Demonic Threats57OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Eusebius’uncompromising belief in the malevolent character ofdemons can also be found reflected in a range of his other works, andis particularly evident in his description of the demonic asμισόκαλος(good-hating),88orφιλοπονήρος(evil-loving).89These terms, particu-larlyμισόκαλος, can be found in many early Christian texts, describ-ing not only demons, but also the devil.90Eusebius’use of these termstherefore points to another important feature of the demonic in hiseyes—their relationship with the devil.91Moreover, the description ofdemons asμισόκαλοςsignificantly reinforces the sense that demonsare a force to be feared. Creatures considered to be invariably‘good-hating’would pose a particularly serious and unpredictable threat,since their actions against human interests would require no provo-cation in the form of human transgression.ENVIOUS DEMONSThis sense that demons are universally wicked is further reflected inthe association which Eusebius draws between demons and the char-acteristic of envy. There are three terms which Eusebius uses in thiscontext:φθόνος,92βασκανία,93andζῆλος.94As P. Walcot has shown,there was considerable overlap in meaning between these terms inclassical Greek texts,95and it is clear that this continued in Eusebius’use of them.

Of these terms,ζῆλοςstandsout as being able to convey, on occasion, a positive connotation.Walcot suggests that, for earlier writers like Aristotle and Plutarch,φθόνοςandζῆλοςmight be distinguished in a similar manner to theEnglish‘envy’and‘emulation’, with the latter regarded as a positive,rather than a negative, emotion.98Similarly, among early Christianauthors,ζῆλοςcould be used to refer to the imitation of God byhumankind, or even to describe God himself.99Indeed, even in theworks of Eusebius, wefind forms ofζῆλοςalso applied to a morepositive emulation, such as the attempt to live up to the example ofthe virtuous patriarchs like Abraham and Joseph.100Yetζῆλοςis alsothe term which Eusebius applies least often to the demons.101This issurely connected to the fact that it could, in certain circumstances, be96HE10.4.57.97For example:PG31.380.3–10, where all three terms appear together in quicksuccession in the same passage.

In association with demons,Eusebius preferred to use another word for‘envy’, one which had anunambiguously negative meaning—φθόνος.Their association withφθόνοςwould not only have marked Euse-bius’demons as wicked, but also as distant from true divinity. Plato,in a passage of theTimaeusthat was widely discussed in antiquity,102had stressed that‘in one who is good no envy (φθόνος) is ever possibleregarding anything’.103This claim occurred in the context of a dis-cussion about the nature of the Demiurge, the world’s creator, inwhich the character of Timaeus was made to suggest that the creatorwas so good, and so free from envy that‘he wished very much thateverything might come into being similar to himself’and that‘asmuch as possible all might be good and nothing wicked’.104As such,in Platonic thought, envy was seen as an emotion entirely incompat-ible with the ultimate divinity; in fact, a key characteristic of thisdivine creator was the very absence of envy. This was clearly an ideathat held particular appeal for Eusebius, since he quoted this line fromtheTimaeuson several occasions.105On one occasion in thePE,Eusebius’quotation of Plato’s line occurs in the context of his owndiscussion about‘the essence of the good’,106in which Eusebiusasserts that according to scripture‘the good itself is nothing otherthan God’.107For Eusebius, then, just as for Plato, there is a clearassociation between goodness, divinity, and freedom from envy. Bydescribing the demons as envious, Eusebius is therefore highlightingseveral ways in which they are distant from the true God. A division isestablished between goodness, a lack of envy, and true divinity on theone hand and wickedness, unrestrained envy, and a lack of divinity onthe other.Likewise, in the early Christian tradition,φθόνοςwas seen, notsimply as incompatible with the divine, but even as directlyopposed to it.

According to the apocryphal Book of Wisdom, it was‘by theφθόνοςof the devil’that death hadfirst come into the world.110Thisidea was repeated in thefirst epistle of Clement,111and Eusebius alsocites this passage in thePE.112Clement of Alexandria denied thepossibility that God could feel envy, since God was untouched bythe passions.113Instead, in what appears to be an oblique reference tothe devil, Clement suggests that‘the one who is envious (ὁφθονῶν)isanother, one who has been approached by passion’.114By character-izing the demons as motivated byφθόνος, Eusebius is thereforehinting at a connection between demons and the devil which heelaborated most fully in thePEandDE.115It is striking that Eusebiusdraws such a close link between demons andφθόνος, encouragingus to see this vice as characteristic of the demonic. More than oncein Eusebius’works wefindφθόνοςand a‘wicked demon’working incombination.116Furthermore, Eusebius also characterizesφθόνοςasμισόκαλος, the same designation that he sometimes gives todemons.117This suggests thatφθόνοςis so characteristic of Eusebius’demons that the nounφθόνοςcould even be used in works such as theVCto stand in place of a reference to demons.Since theφθόνοςof the gods was an essential feature of traditionalGreek historiography, some scholars have suggested that the earliestChristian historians, struggling to reconcile this notion with theirbelief in a benevolent God,‘reinterpreted’theφθόνοςof the gods astheφθόνοςof demons.118Although it is true that references to demo-nic envy are more numerous in Eusebius’arguably more‘historical’works, theHEandVC, similar references can also be found elsewhere.In theDE, where there is no historiographical or narrative need for areplacement for the‘jealousy of the gods’, demons are still closely109Rom. 1:29; Gal 5:21; 1 Tim. 6:4; Titus 3:3; 1 Pet. 2:1.

AtDE4.9.1, demons are not simplylinked loosely to envy, but the object of their jealousy—the salvationof humankind—is identified, and given as a reason for their initialfall. This characteristic thus appears to have been integral to Eusebius’understanding of the demonic character, rather than merely fulfillingan historiographical requirement.It is also significant that theφθόνοςof Eusebius’demons is signifi-cantly more serious than the traditional jealousy of the Greek gods.As D. L. Cairns has argued, the traditional divineφθόνος‘presupposesat least a minimal notion of human offence’;119theφθόνοςof Euse-bius’demons, by contrast, required no such provocation. In Eusebius’works, theφθόνοςof the demons is regularly linked to other demonictraits, such as their hatred of the good and their love of evil, as whenEusebius writes of the‘good-hating envy (ὁμισοκάλος φθόνος), eventhe evil-loving demon’resenting the prosperity of the church.120Eusebius is thus able to create a closely linked group of key negativeassociations for the demons. This suggestion that demonic envymight arise simply from a‘hatred of the good’, rather than as aresponse to some form of human transgression served once again tomake the nature of their threat seem far more unpredictable. It alsomade it clear that theφθόνοςof the demons, unlike that of thetraditional gods, did not contain any element of divine justice, butwas itself unjust and indiscriminate in its targeting of humankind.Likeφθόνος, the characteristic ofβασκανίαis unambiguously nega-tive for Eusebius. Traditionally, the verbβασκαίνωhad referred notonly to being jealous, but also, significantly, to the idea of‘casting theevil eye’upon someone.121As Vasiliki Limberis has shown in the caseof Basil of Caesarea, some early Christian writers sought to bringpopular fears about the power of the‘evil eye’(βάσκανοςὀφθαλμός)into the remit of the church, by suggesting that envy and the evil119D.

Although clearly very closelyconnected toφθόνοςfor Eusebius,βασκανίαperhaps representsfor him the active, harmful product of the demonic characteristicofφθόνος.Moreover, the characteristic ofβασκανίαwould further have hintedat the connection between demons and the devil for early Christians,as one of the several possible meanings of the termβάσκανοςwas‘slanderous’.124In older Greek texts, such as Aristophanes and Plato,the word used by Christians for the devil,διάβολος, usually had themeaning simply of‘slanderous’.125It is therefore striking that, atDE4.9.1, where the demons are said to be driven by their‘jealousy of thegood’(βασκανίᾳτῶνἀγαθῶν), this emotion is described as so extremethat they even act‘against the Lord’s lot itself’(αὐτῷτῷτοῦκυρίουκλήρῳ). By‘the Lord’s lot’, Eusebius is doubtless referring those whoare virtuous. Shortly before this passage, Eusebius offers an interpret-ation of Deuteronomy 32:7–9, in which‘the Lord’s part’(μερίςΚυρίου) is named as‘Jacob’.126Glossing this passage, Eusebiusexplains that‘Jacob’refers to that part of humankind who display‘clear-sightedness’(τὸδιορατικὸν) and are‘pious’(θεοσεβής).127Thusthe implication is that piety and insight bring a person closer toGod. More specifically, for Eusebius, these virtues bring peoplecloser to Christ, for he makes it clear in his interpretation of Deu-teronomy that he understands‘Κύριος’to refer to Christ.128Thesevirtues would also draw people away from the demons, standing insharp contrast to the‘jealous’and‘good-hating’character of thedemons. As a result of theirβασκανία, the demons are thus set upin opposition to Christ and the goodness associated with him, andare tied instead to the devil. For Eusebius, envy (φθόνος)andthemalignant jealousy that accompanied it (βασκανία) were essential122Limberis,‘The Eyes Infected’.123HE5.21.2.124LSJ s.v.βασκαίνω.125Riley,‘Devil’, 463, citing Aristophanes,Knights, 45 and Plato,Apology37b.126DE4.7.1–2.127DE4.7.2.128DE4.7.2.The Nature of Demonic Threats63OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"characteristics of demons, which not only helped to reinforce thesense of their malevolence, but also established them as opponentsof God, and allies of the devil.DECEPTIVE DEMONSFor Eusebius, the demonic threat to humankind consisted, notprimarily in coercion or physical danger, but rather in deception.Eusebius frequently characterizes demons in terms ofπλάνηandἀπάτη, both of which meant‘error’or‘deceit’.129In comparison,direct physical attacks by demons on humankind are rare in Eusebius’works.130In one case, even when Eusebius does mention demonscausing human illnesses, this physical attack is linked to the demons’broader strategy of deception. AtPE5.2.1, Eusebius describes howdemons were able to deceive‘foolish souls’in part by seeming to‘cure’illnesses that they had previously caused. This tactic of causingand then resolving illnesses is presented as simply one of a range ofmethods by which demons lead people astray—in the same passage,they are also said to deliver oracles and to cause statues to move, withthe same aim of deceiving people.131Moreover, Eusebius suggeststhat demonic deception was driven by the demons’desire to usurp theplace of the true God and be proclaimed as divine in his place.132ForEusebius, demonic deception is therefore multilayered—the everydaytricks and deceits of the demons are directed towards a larger goalthat is, in itself, fraudulent.This sense that demons were highly deceptive beings recurs inseveral writers—non-Christian as well as Christian—from this period.In theVita Antonii, for instance, Antony dismisses what appear to beprophecies made by demons, explaining that this seeming foreknow-ledge in fact stems from the demons’ability to move at great speedand consequent ability to carry news quickly, rather than from any129See, for example:ἀπάτη:PE4.21.6, 5.2.1, 6.6.3, 6.11.82, 7.10.15, 7.16.10;DE9.14.7;SC13.6;HE7.17.1;CI130.21.πλάνη:PE4.14.10, 4.15.6, 6.6.3, 6.11.82;DE4.9.8,5.4.2, 6.20.12, 9.1.7;SC16.3;CI107.7; 263.6–7; 266.5; 273.10–11;HE7.17.1;Fr.Luc.,PG24.553.25;CPs, PG23.821.6.130Such attacks are, however, mentioned on occasion—for instance in Eusebius’treatise on Easter,De Solemnitate Paschale:PG24.697.20.131PE5.2.1.132PE7.16.10.64The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"real insight into the future.133A similar explanation of demonicprophecies was also given by Augustine.134For Christian writers, ofcourse, there was good reason to downplay the prophetic powerof demons by attributing their predictions to deception, since thisleft the true power of prophecy exclusively with their one, true God. Itis more striking tofind a similar emphasis on the deceptive nature ofmalicious demons in the discussions of the non-Christian writer,Porphyry.In thede Abstinentia, Porphyry describes malevolent demons as‘full of allphantasiaand far enough advanced to deceive throughmarvels’.135In particular, he suggests that, despite being responsiblefor many kinds of human suffering, from plagues and infertility toearthquakes and droughts, malicious demons manage to shift theblame for such events onto the benevolent gods and demons instead.This, for Porphyry, is among the worst of the wicked demons’actions,for it encourages, among those less clear-sighted than himself, theview that the highest gods are changeable and capable of inflictingharm.136Porphyry differs from Eusebius and other Christian writersin suggesting that prophecies—in particular, warnings about thedangers posed by malevolent demons—are sent by beneficentdemons and thus are not part of the wicked demons’deception.Nevertheless, there is a further remarkable parallel between Eusebius’and Porphyry’s explanations of the deception of wicked demons, forPorphyry suggests that demons‘wish to be gods and the power whichstands over them to be seen as the greatest God’.137Despite theirdifferences, both writers see wicked demons as engaged in a grandfraud to impersonate the true divinity.DEMONS AND THE DEVILA further important aspect of Eusebius’understanding of the demo-nic is the relationship between demons and the devil.

For some, such as Justin Martyr, and Eusebius’Latin contemporary Lactantius, demons were not angels, but ratherthe maliciously inclined spirits of the giants, which were themselvesthe deformed and malevolent offspring of a forbidden union betweenfallen angels and human women.140This story was most likely draw-ing on the account found in the EnochicBook of the Watchers,according to which the angels sent to watch over humankind hadfallen from heaven as a result of their lust for human women.141Theiroffspring, the giants, were then said to have spread terror anddestruction on earth until they were destroyed at God’s command.However, while the giants and the fallen angels themselves weresupposed to have been confined by God, the spirits of the giantswere allowed to remain free on earth, continuing to cause trouble asdemons.142Eusebius was no doubt aware of the Enochic story, yet wefind onlyfaint traces of it in thePE—as, for example, when Eusebius tells usthat, while some of the fallen angels were confined in Tartarus, otherswere allowed to remain free on earth.143Similarly in theCommentariiin Isaiam(CI), quoting directly from Genesis 6:2 rather than from its138PE7.16.1.139PE7.16.2, 7.16.9.

In hisde Gigantibus, Philoof Alexandria had suggested that‘demons’,‘angels’, and‘giants’werein fact the same, despite the fact that they were often referred to bydifferent names.145Philo’s discussion of Genesis 6:2 included thesuggestion that different souls had fallen away from the service ofGod to different degrees—a position which had far more in commonwith that of Origen than with theBook of the Watchers.146Thus, evenin his brief reference to Genesis 6:2 and to the giants in theCI,itisentirely possible that Eusebius still had in mind the idea of fallenangels.Nevertheless, Eusebius’evident familiarity with the story of thegiants makes it particularly striking that, in his longer explanation inthePE, he chose to focus on the story of the fallen angels. The hints ofthe story of the giants that appear in thePEmake it clear thatEusebius was already aware of this version when he wrote thiswork; it is not a later discovery made between the composition ofthePEand theCI. Rather, it seems that Eusebius deliberately chose toemphasize the original link between demons and angels, claimingthat the demons have fallen directly from the‘blissful and angelicchoruses’.147This has the effect of drawing a much closer linkbetween the demons and thefigure regarded as their leader, thedevil, for it appears that Eusebius also saw the devil as a fallen angel.144CI95.21–5.145Philo of Alexandria,de Gigantibus, 16.

Sirinelliidentified two main views that were prevalent at the time: thefirst,which he attributed to writers including Tertullian, Athenagoras, andLactantius, placed the devil’s fall after the creation of humans, andconsidered it to stem from the devil’s envy of humankind.155Thesecond view, advocated by Origen, saw the cause of the devil’s fall aspride, arising independently of the creation of humankind.156Previous scholarship has suggested that Eusebius followed Origenin ascribing the devil’s fall to the sin of pride.157This is certainly theimpression conveyed atPE7.16, where Eusebius blames the‘boast-fulness and battle against God’of this diabolicalδράκωνfor his fall.158A quotation from Ezekiel, suggesting that God had told thisfigure148DE4.9.1–8;PE7.16.1–7.

Eusebius envisaged a cosmology in which the supreme Godwas opposed by a hostile‘rebellious power’(ἀποστατικῆςδυνάμεως),162variously described as theδιαβόλος,163and theμεγαλοδαίμων,164identified with the fallen day-star of Isaiah 14:12,165and named asBeelzebul.166The link between thisfigure and the demons is madeexplicit in several places—the supporters of theμεγαλοδαίμωνaredescribed as the‘demons and worse spirits’,167while a clearly diabol-icalfigure is called‘the beginner of their [the demons and wickedspirits’] fall’,168and the‘ruler’(ἄρχων) of the demons.169Not only isthere a clear link, but the relationship is evidently envisaged ashierarchical—the devil leads, and the demons follow.While Eusebius was by no means thefirst Christian writer toconsider demons as subordinates and followers of the devil, thisChristian position did mark a significant departure from that of159Ezek. 28:2, NRSV trans., cited atPE7.16.5. Eusebius also cites Ezek. 28:12–15,28:17, and Isa. 14:13–14 atPE7.16.4–6.160DE4.9.1.161DE4.9.1, 4.9.3.162DE4.9.1.163PE11.26.5.164DE4.9.1.165DE4.9.4;PE7.16.4.166PE4.22.15.

According to Origen’s report, Celsus hadfound the idea that the supreme god might have an adversary to be‘most impious’(ἀσεβέστατα),170and had further considered alldemons to be‘of god’(τοῦθεοῦ).171Even when Plutarch acknow-ledged that some demons might cause harm to humans, the source oftheir misbehaviour was seen as their susceptibility to passion.172There was no suggestion that they might be acting as part of awider hostile force, with an identifiable leader. Thus, the demons wefind in Eusebius’works appear to be considerably more co-ordinatedand deliberate in their threat than the occasional rogue demons ofearlier Greek philosophy.DEMONIC POWERFor Eusebius, then, demons were a hostile force, characterized byenvy and deceit, and opposed both to the benevolent Christian Godand to those virtuous humans who followed him. Alongside this, afirm belief in the power of demons to cause harm was central toEusebius’perception of the demonic threat. Although Eusebiusmakes it clear that the demons’power could not match that of thetruly divine Christian God, he nonetheless allows them a level ofability and knowledge considerably beyond that of humans. This isneatly illustrated in the example from thePEthat we considered inthe section‘Deceptive Demons’, in which demons are said to sendillnesses to afflict people, before deceptively pretending to‘cure’themin order to gain worship.173Here, Eusebius is at the same timegranting demons considerable power—the ability to inflict ill-health—and restricting the scope of that power by arguing that theydo not have the ability truly to cure sickness. In this passage, demonsare placed within a clear hierarchy of power—above humans, butbelow true divinity.170Orig.Cels.6.42.171Orig.Cels.8.24.

Questioning whether the traditional Greek oracles arethe work of demons or of true gods, Eusebius suggests that‘it seemsthat the oracles were of demons, applicable to the detection of a thief,or the destruction of a utensil, or other such things, of which it wasnot improbable that those haunting the air around the earth shouldhave some small knowledge’.174Eusebius does not attempt to denythat the traditional oracles might have revealed information that washidden to humans, attributing the demons’greater knowledge to theirontological superiority.175However, he is at the same time quick tostress the limitations of their power, immediately contrasting thesedemonic oracles with the predictions of the‘Hebrew prophets’, suchas Moses.176While the traditional oracles dealt only with the‘smalland lowly’,177the divinely inspired prophecies of the Jewish andChristian scriptures‘contributed to great things’.178As such, evenwhile accepting some degree of demonic power, Eusebius carefullyplaces it within a wider hierarchy of power and ability, in which theChristian God, as always, is superior.This belief in the existence of some demonic power was clearly ofconsiderable significance for Eusebius, since he deliberately dismissesan alternative explanation for the traditional oracles that would havedownplayed the extent of the demons’power—namely, that theoracles were the result of human fraud. Introducing his discussionof oracles in book 4 of thePE, Eusebius acknowledges that somewriters might choose to argue against the validity of the traditionaloracles by suggesting that‘the whole thing is a deceit and the con-trivances and misdeeds of human sorcerers’.179However, Eusebiusprefers the alternative explanation that the oracles were the result ofdemonic influence,180as the demons attempted to draw peopleaway from the true God, towards a life of immorality.181The furthestEusebius is prepared to go in allowing a role for human fraud in174DE5.Praef.17.175Compare theV.

Eusebius was fully aware that there were alterna-tive explanations for oracular predictions available to him, but hedeliberately chose not to use them. Instead, he downplayed therole of human fraud, and stressed instead the malign influence ofthe demons.In fact, the idea that demonic power was real, but at the same timeconsiderably weaker than that of the truly divine Christian God, wasof central importance to Eusebius’apologetic argument in thePEandDE. Eusebius’defence of the power of Christ in these works dependsin part upon a belief in the power of demons. Eusebius was able tocontrast the extent of the demons’power with that of the power ofChrist, which he considered to be much greater, by suggesting thatthe struggle between Christianity and the polytheistic cults on earthwas simply a manifestation of the more significant cosmic conflicttaking place between the demons on the one hand, and Christ onthe other. Eusebius brings this to the fore by posing to his readers thedirect question of why the supposed‘gods’of paganism have failed tostop the spread of Christian teaching:Indeed, if he is a mortal man, as they may say (perhaps even a deceiver,they may say), but they are saviours and gods, why indeed have they allfled in crowds, even Asclepius himself, their backs towards this mortal,and why have they handed over all humankind in their control, one afteranother, to this one, who, so they say, no longer exists?185Eusebiusfinds‘evidence’for the supposed decline of pagan oracles andthe civic cults in discussions drawn from non-Christian writers likePorphyry and Plutarch about cases of failed or abandoned oracles.186182PE5.2.5.183PE5.2.5.184PE5.2.5.185PE5.1.12.186See, for example:PE5.1.9–10, 5.17.13.72The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"He then contrasts these with the spread of Christian teaching, and thesuccess of the Christian church.187At times, Eusebius makes his casefor the greater power of Christ even more explicitly, remarking that‘our saviour, undertaking his teachings among men, is described ashaving driven out the whole race of demons from the life of men, sothat already some of the demons fell to their knees and supplicated himnot to give them up to the Tartarus that was waiting for them’.188Here,the power of Christ is presented as so far superior to that of the demonsthat they are reduced to the position of mere suppliants, forced toappeal for mercy. Acknowledging the reality of demonic power thusallows Eusebius to argue for the reality of the power of Christ as well.Depicting the Christian God as the strongest of a variety of spiritualpowers provides valuable support to Eusebius’claim in thePEandDEthat the Christians had acted sensibly in turning away from the oldcivic cults towards Christianity. By suggesting that the power of Christhasovercomethepowerofthedemons,EusebiusisimplyingthattheChristians have chosen the protection of a stronger divinity than thosethat oversaw the old pagan civic cults.189If Eusebius had not regardedthe demons as exercising genuine power, albeit of a limited kind, itwould have made Christ’s supposed undermining of that power appearconsiderably less impressive. That Eusebius sought to construct part ofhis defence of Christianity on the basis that demons exercised consid-erable power illustrates not only the depth of his own belief in theirpower, but also his confidence that his audience would share his senseof demons as a strong and powerful presence in their world.CONCLUSIONSOverall, this survey of Eusebius’discussions of the demonic through-out a range of his works has revealed a remarkably consistent picture187See, for example:PE5.1.13–15.188PE5.17.13. See also:DE6.13.8.

It has shown that Eusebius held demons to be an activeand hostile presence in the universe. In league with the devil, demonsranged themselves against God and his virtuous followers. AlthoughEusebius was adamant that their power could not match that of thetrue God, it was nevertheless strong enough to enable demons tointerfere considerably in human existence, partly by causing physicalharm through the infliction of illnesses, but more significantly byinflicting moral harm through the deceptive encouragement of poly-theism and vice. For Eusebius the demonic threat was potent.In consequence, while Eusebius may at times have chosen toemphasize particular features of demonic activity in certain of hisworks for apologetic ends,190we must be careful to avoid readingEusebius’references to the demonic simply as part of a convenientapologetic strategy. Rather, we need to acknowledge his genuineconcern about the danger which demons might pose. The depth ofthis concern can further be seen from the way in which Eusebius’ideaof a stark divide between the good Christian God and the wickeddemons manifested itself in a series of further polarities in Eusebius’thought, expanding into a picture of a universe fundamentally div-ided between hostile spiritual opponents. This, however, will be thesubject of Chapter 3.190Such as, in Johnson’s suggestion, arguing against the power of the oracles inorder to undermine the‘political theology’of the Greekpoleis:Ethnicity and Argu-ment, 163–70.74The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"3A Divided UniversePrevious work on demons in Eusebius has returned repeatedly to theidea that demons were associated above all with polytheistic cults andoracles, and deployed primarily to attack the foundations of trad-itional Greek and Roman religion.1However, this was only one aspectof the demonic presence for Eusebius, albeit the one that emergesmost obviously from a reading of thePraeparatio Evangelica(PE). Toachieve a more rounded picture of his views, we need to recognize theextent to which Eusebius’ideas about demons permeated and helpedto structure his understanding of the universe more generally.Throughout Eusebius’works we repeatedlyfind the fundamentalopposition between God/Christ on the one hand and the devil/demons on the other reflected in a series of extreme polarities,2demonstrating how Eusebius’ideas about demons underpinned histhought more broadly. This chapter will propose a reading of Euse-bius’works that takes full account of the depth and sincerity of hisbelief in demons. It will suggest that Eusebius’understanding ofmalevolent demons as the opponents of the benevolent God ledhim to view the universe as fundamentally divided. This basic div-ision then found expression in a range of other terminological andconceptual extremes.In what follows, I will explore how Eusebius’demons are associatedin his works with a series of further negative concepts. Demons arenot only excluded from goodness, but are set up in direct opposition1See, for example: Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’, 189; Sirinelli,Les vues historiques, 317;Johnson,Ethnicity and Argument, 163–70; and, to a lesser extent, Martin,InventingSuperstition, 209–13.2The extreme polarities in Eusebius’thought have previously been recognized by:Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’, 183–7; Martin,Inventing Superstition, 221.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"to anything which might be presented as good or virtuous. The resultis a universe of hostile, even warring, extremes, in which there is nomiddle ground and, it appears, little room for reconciliation. Thisraises the question of how far Eusebius subscribed to a dualistic viewof the universe. Although at times Eusebius appears to come veryclose to dualism in his suggestion of an absolute cosmic divide, I willnevertheless show that he consistently resists placing the demonicpowers on an equal footing with the divine.DEMONS AND ANGELSThe extent to which Eusebius saw the universe as starkly dividedbetween good and evil is evident from his presentation of anothergroup of spiritual beings, similar to demons in terms of physicality,but fundamentally opposed to them in their moral character—that is,the angels.3Eusebius’benevolent spirits, described as the‘angels ofGod’(οἱἄγγέλοι τοῦθεοῦ), are characterized by light as opposed tothe demons’association with darkness.4Throughout Eusebius’works,darkness is a frequent attribute of the demonic.5At one point, he evendescribes‘the wicked demon’as‘belonging to darkness’,6suggestingthat he saw darkness as fundamental to the demonic character.Moreover, in the course of their fall, demons are said to have‘takendarkness over light’.7This is in clear contrast to Eusebius’angels, whoare described as‘shining’, and likened to the‘stars in heaven’.8Thesecontrasting associations for Eusebius’demons and angels help to tiethese two groups to their respective leaders—the devil and God—byreflecting the language in which these twofigures were also regularlydescribed. Echoing terms common to descriptions of the devil anddemons both in the New Testament, and in works by other earlier3It is surprising that, despite recognizing the extreme polarization of Eusebius’universe, neither Coggan nor Martin displays much interest in his opposition ofdemons and angels: Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’; Martin,Inventing Superstition.4PE11.26.5.

Although, as I will show inthe section‘A“Dualistic”view’, Eusebius avoided attributing equalpower to the wicked powers and to God, we nevertheless sense hereEusebius’discomfort with the idea that God might be responsible forthe creation of evil. Describing this diabolicalδράκωνas aποιητήςinhis own right helps to absolve God of responsibility for the creation ofnegative things. It also highlights the extent to which Eusebius viewedthe universe as starkly divided.By contrast, God and his Logos are, for Eusebius, characteristicallyassociated with light.14Christ, for instance, is described as‘a sun of9For the devil associated with darkness, see, for example: Acts 26:18; Eph. 6:12;Bar. 18.1; Justin Martyr,Dialogue with Trypho76.17; Clem.

As Strutwolf also noted:DieTrinitätstheologie, 214. In this, Eusebius was again echoing biblical language, wherelight is frequently evoked as a characteristic of both God and Christ.

Eusebius’demons are established as the opponentsof benevolent spiritual forces and his universe becomes polarizedbetween two hostile groups. For Eusebius, two opposingfigures inthe universe—God and the devil—are each joined and supportedby their own followers, which are equally opposed to each other.Eusebius makes it very clear that, in his view, these opposing spiritualforces are entirely incompatible when he poses to his readers thequestion:‘how could the bad at any point become a friend to thegood, unless it were to be said that it is possible for light and darknessto become one combination?’17Eusebius’characterization of demonsand angels by the contrasting associations of darkness and lighthighlights the fundamental—and seemingly unbridgeable—divisionwhich he envisaged between the two.Eusebius was not alone among Christian writers of this periodin holding that there was a clear distinction betweenἀγγέλοιandδαίμονες, and in seeking to demonstrate in his works the differencebetween Christian and non-Christian understandings of the terms.18As with the wordδαίμονες, early Christian writers shared the termἀγγέλοιwith their non-Christian contemporaries. Although the wordwas frequently used to refer to ordinary, human messengers, fromthe second century onwards non-Christian authors were also usingἀγγέλοιto describe spiritual messengers, acting as intermediariesbetween the divine and human realms.19However, while pagan andJewish philosophers saw little difference between angels and demons,early Christian writers were insistent on separating the terms.20Philoof Alexandria had considered that‘souls and demons and angels havedifferent names, but on the same one foundation’.21Yet Origen15PE2.5.2.16DE4.3.3.17PE4.17.11. This question echoes that of Paul at 2 Cor. 6:14, where he asks:‘whatpartnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship isthere between light and darkness?’NRSV trans. The incompatibility of light anddarkness was a recurring theme among early Christian writers—for example: Irenaeusof Lyons in hisAdversus Haereses.2.12.5; Clem. Alex.Stro.5.9.57.5 (quoting 2 Cor.6:14).18R.

The complete polarization ofthese two groups would have served to reinforce Eusebius’claim thatthere could not be any good demons. It also illustrates the extent towhich Eusebius’universe was fully split between the cosmic forces ofgood and those of evil.That Eusebius should have considered these two groups of spiritualbeings to be so fundamentally divided is all the more striking becauseof the similar origins which he appears to have envisaged for bothangels and demons. Eusebius suggests in thePEthat demons wereoriginally angels when he informs the reader that the demons andwicked spirits have apostatized from‘the choruses of the better’,23and have in the process‘taken darkness over light’.24Moreover,demons and angels seem to have remained ontologically similarbeings for Eusebius, since, in theTheophania(Theoph.), he groupsboth beneficent and maleficent spiritual beings together as‘incorpor-eal and invisible powers’.25Yet despite this, Eusebius places demonsand angels at different positions on a clear spiritual hierarchy: the‘refined and good powers’are far below‘the unoriginated God, theirown maker’,26but they are also significantly above the‘depraved raceof the demons’,27occupying a position somewhere between the two.Despite their similar origins, it seems that the moral differencesbetween angels and demons were enough to require that they beseen as different kinds of spiritual beings.28Eusebius’categorizationof angels and demons is thus based primarily on moral criteria.At the heart of this distinction between Eusebius’angels anddemons there lies the crucial issue of choice: that is, the originaldecision of the demons to depart from the company of‘the better’.29Explaining why he feels that demons and angels should not be giventhe same name, Eusebius asserts that‘it would be most unreasonableof all that one and the same name should befitting for things which22Cline,Ancient Angels, 6, citing Orig.Cels.8.25.23PE7.16.2.

In this, Eusebius was notalone among early Christian writers. In Tatian’sOratio Ad Graecos,itwasπροαίρεσις, and specifically‘freedom ofπροαίρεσις’(τῇδὲἐλευθερίᾳτῆς προαιρέσεως), that allowed punishments and rewardsto be justly meted out to humankind.31Thus,προαίρεσιςcarried withit, at least among early Christian writers, the sense of responsibilityfor one’s actions. Eusebius’remark about the different‘nature fromtheir [the demons’] behaviour’is also worthy of note, for it suggeststhat their wicked nature is not innate, but is rather the product oftheir behaviour and actions. Since these actions would stem from thedemons’προαίρεσις, this phrase emphasizes once again that demonsare to be held responsible for their own wickedness.This idea that the demons were ultimately responsible for theirown separation from the angels is reflected throughout thePE. Thefall of the demons’diabolical leader is described as‘self-determined’(αὐθεκούσιος),32and, similarly, it is the demons’‘own wickedness’(δι’οἰκείαν φαυλότητα) that leads them to follow him.33It is thisfundamental moral choice—to follow God, or to oppose him—thatultimately separates Eusebius’angels and demons. In his method ofdistinguishing between good and bad spiritual beings, Eusebius there-fore differed significantly even from those earlier Greek writers whohad allowed for the possibility of maliciously inclined demons. WhilePlutarch’s bad demons may have been acting under the influence ofthe passions, there was no sense that they had deliberately chosenevil.34By contrast, Eusebius’demons, having voluntarily embracedevil, appear far more threatening. The line was drawn at the moment30PE4.5.5. For further discussion of this passage, see: H. A. Johannessen,‘TheGenosof Demons and“Ethnic”Identity in Eusebius’Praeparatio Evangelica’,Journalof Ecclesiastical History66 (2015), 1–18.31Tat.Orat.7.32PE7.16.3.33PE7.16.2.34Dillon,Middle Platonists, 217–18. In Dillon’s view, while Plutarch did suggestthat some demons were capable of wicked actions, he did not believe in‘primallyevil[demons], such as onefinds in Zoroastrian or Gnostic systems’, 218. However, Dillonnotes a possible anomaly in Plutarch’sDe Iside et Osiride, which‘tends far moretowards the postulation of inherently evil daemons’than Plutarch’s other works, 218.This, however, appears to be an exception, based perhaps on the fact that Plutarch wasattempting in this work to explain the nature of the giants and Titans, 218.80The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"of the demons’fall between those spiritual beings that chose God, andthose that chose the devil. Again, there is a clear polarization withinEusebius’cosmology between good and bad spiritual beings.FURTHER POLARITIESThis basic opposition between benevolent and malevolent spiritualforces in the universe can be seen to extend into a series of furtherpolar opposites associated with these two groups. One of the mostimportant of these is the distinction which Eusebius makes betweenrationality (λογικός) and intellectual reasoning (νοερός) on the onehand,35and irrationality (ἀλογός) and madness (μανία) on the other.Throughout Eusebius’works, the activity of demons and the devil isfrequently associated with the spread of irrationality—people heconsiders to be in the power of demons are described as mad orirrational,36while at the time of their fall, the wicked powers arethemselves considered to be acting in a way that was mad.37Import-antly, however, despite the irrationality of their behaviour, Eusebiusdoes not present demons as, in essence, irrational beings. Instead hedirectly asserts that‘the demons are rational’(λογικοὶοἱδαίμονες)aspart of his criticism of older Greek philosophical explanations ofdemonic origins.38That Eusebius’demons possessed the capacityfor rational thought but failed to act accordingly is significant,since, as rational beings, they would have been able to exerciseπροαίρεσις, reinforcing the sense that they were responsible for theirown fall and subsequent actions.39This association between demons and irrational behaviour is fur-ther reflected in Eusebius’frequent portrayal of demons, and those in35As Frede has pointed out, there was considerable overlap in ancient textsbetween a variety of words such as these, which might loosely be translated intoEnglish as signifying the concept of‘rationality’or‘reason’. Frede writes of‘a certainwavering in terminology betweenlogos, to logikon, nous, hegemonikon, mens, ratio,and other terms’: M. Frede,‘Introduction’, in M. Frede and G. Striker, eds.,Rationalityin Greek Thought(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), 3.36For example:HE7.31.1, 10.8.9–10;VC1.45.2–3;LC7.7, 9.13;SC13.6;Theoph.1.78, 2.1.37PE7.16.3–4.

The idea that animals lacked rationality was reasonably com-mon in antiquity, although by no means universal.42Aristotle and theStoics had considered that only humans possessed the ability toreason, although their view was challenged by many within thePlatonist tradition.43Even among early Christians there was consi-derable disagreement on this point: Origen had considered animals tolack reason,44yet Eusebius’Latin contemporary Lactantius took theopposite view.45On this topic, it is evident that Eusebius shared Origen’s view.According to Eusebius, animals were most emphatically not rational:in thePEhe states clearly that beasts were‘irrational according tonature’,46and animals or beasts are often referred to asἄλογαthroughout Eusebius’works.47As such, by associating demons andthose he considered to be in their power with wild animals, Eusebiuswas drawing attention to their intellectual shortcomings. Moreover,Eusebius’portrayal of demons as beasts serves as a regular reminder40For example: demons as beasts:PE4.17.9,VC1.49.1;HE10.4.14;DE10.8.73;Theoph.3.13, 3.55; people as beasts:PE7.2.6;DE3.3.7, 4.10.2;LC9.13.41HE10.4.14.

It was a threat that consisted, above all, in drawing peopleaway from the true God and thus away from the better part ofthemselves.In Eusebius’view, God, in contrast to the demons, was pre-eminently associated with the spread of rationality. Eusebius describesChrist as‘intellectual light’(φῶς νοερόν), combining this attribute ofrationality with his common association of the divinity with light.48Eusebius also presents Christ as rescuing people from a prior state ofirrationality by offering them improved understanding through histeaching.49Moreover, for Eusebius, it was the rational human soulthat brought humankind closest to God, since he interpreted thereference in Genesis to God making man in his own image as describ-ing, not the human body, but the soul:50And so it seems to me that, in the nature of man, the rational andimmortal soul and the passionless mind are well said to keep safe anicon and resemblance of God, insofar as in their substance they are bothimmaterial and incorporeal, and intellectual and rational...51Thus, in associating the demons with irrationality, Eusebius was notonly highlighting their opposition to God, but was also suggestingthat they could deprive people of access to the best part of themselves,the part that was nearest to God. It is striking that Eusebius, claimingto follow the teaching of Moses, regards the‘true man’as that locatedin the soul and sharing in‘intellectual, incorporeal, and rationalsubstance’.52Therefore, by drawing people into irrationality, demonswere not only drawing them away from God, but were also robbingthem of their full humanity.In the light of this, it is surely also significant that Eusebiusdescribed those who practised polytheistic or astral worship asbeing‘like children in their souls’,53once again implying that theywere in a less intellectually developed state.

This is reflectedelsewhere in thePE, where recent converts are described as being‘likechildren in their souls’, in contrast to those who have progressedfurther in their understanding of the scriptures.56A similar idea isfound in some of Paul’s epistles, where the metaphor of childhoodcould similarly imply the possibility of progress, particularly progresstowards God.57In Galatians, Paul compared Christians before thecoming of Christ to slaves, who, through Christ’s teaching, have beenconverted from slaves to children,‘and if a child then also an heir,through God’.58In suggesting atPE1.6.3 that the earlier generationsof humans who worshipped the stars rather than the true God were‘like children’, Eusebius perhaps had in mind the idea found inGalatians that such children might, with the coming of Christ, beable to progress to a state of greater knowledge and understanding.This distinction between rationality and irrationality appears tohave been fundamental to Eusebius’understanding of the differencebetween the forces of good and evil in the universe, and it is also apolarity that underpins the whole of the combined apologetic of thePEandDE. It is a central aim of these works to demonstrate thatChristians have chosen their new beliefs, not irrationally and out ofblind faith, but as a result of‘judgement and temperate calculation’.59This was in part a response to accusations previously levelledagainst Christians that their beliefs were based on‘irrationaland unexamined belief’.60As many scholars have noted, Eusebius’54On which, see: Sorabji,Animal Minds, 70, 127; P.

Attimes, Eusebius makes this association between demons and tyrannyperfectly obvious, as when he describes how, in the past,‘the demonsruled all the nations as tyrants’(τῶνἐθνῶνἁπάντων κατετυράννουν οἱδαίμονες).63The use of the verbκατατυραννεύωdraws attention towhat Eusebius evidently considered to be the oppressive nature ofdemonic power. Likewise, atPE4.21.2, Eusebius describes howpeople have been saved by Christ from their‘ancestral slavery’todemons, again showing the demons as oppressive. This associationbetween demons and tyrannical power also permeates Eusebius’works at a less obvious level, reflected in the similar language whichEusebius uses to characterize both tyrants and demons, and in theverbs which he uses to describe their actions.At times, some of thefigures whom Eusebius portrays as tyrants inworks like theHistoria ecclesiastica(HE) are also, like demons,described as‘good-hating’(μισόκαλος);64likewise, both demons andhuman tyrants can be found characterized by madness (μανία).65Significant parallels also occur in the verbs that Eusebius uses todescribe the actions of demons and tyrants. Demons, like tyrants,are said to‘enslave’(δουλόω) their subjects,66and even where Euse-bius does not use exactly the same word to describe the manner inwhich demons and tyrants act, his choice of vocabulary neverthelessrepresents them behaving in similar ways and is generally suggestiveof oppression.

In some cases, this serves tointensify the already negative meaning of the verb, as withτυραννεύω;in others, it turns an otherwise relatively neutral verb likeκρατέω,which could have either a positive or a negative meaning, into anunquestionably negative verb. Either way, the regular use of thisprefix helps to associate demonsfirmly with ideas of tyranny andsubjugation. By drawing such parallels between demons and conceptsthat were already viewed in a negative light by much of his audience,Eusebius was once again reinforcing his argument that demons wereto be viewed as unremittingly negativefigures. In contrast, Eusebiusassociates the Christian God with freedom (ἐλευθερία), presentingChrist as offering people the chance of liberation from the demonictyranny to which they had been subject.69Christ, we are told,‘calledthe entire race of men out from impious and Egyptian idolatry underwicked demons into freedom’.70Thus, once again, wefind God andthe demons associated with contrasting concepts, this time of libertyand tyranny, further reinforcing the sense that Eusebius held thesepowers to be separated by a great gulf.This idea that both non-Christians and people in the pre-Christianera were in some way enslaved was by no means original toEusebius—itfirst occurs in the Pauline notion of‘slavery to sin’,according to which Christian converts, having previously beenenslaved to sin, have, through the teaching of Christ,‘been set freefrom sin, [and] have become slaves of righteousness’.71For Eusebius,Pauline slavery to sin appears to have been replaced by a moretangible form of slavery to demons.72Nevertheless, sin and demonsremained closely connected for Eusebius, since he in turn linked theoppressive influence of the demons to the spread of immorality.7367DE4.10.13;DE6.20.11;PE1.5.1.68HE10.9.3;VC1.12.2.

Human sacrifice had long been used byGreek and Roman writers to define‘the other’, and to distinguishbetween‘civilization’and‘barbarism’.83Indeed, Christians had them-selves been accused by their opponents of practising human sacrifice, andeven cannibalism.84Instead, Eusebius was simply redrawing an existingboundary between‘civilization’and‘barbarism’, such that Christianity,rather than Hellenism, now represented the civilizing force.85This can be seen most clearly from a passage in thefirst book of thePE, in which Eusebius credits the teaching of Christ with bringing toan end the practices of cannibalism and incest which he claims hadbeen common among the traditional enemies of the Roman Empire,such as the Persians:[B]ut, from only his speech and his teaching, which is spread across theentire inhabited world, the customs of all the nations, including thosewhich were previously wild and barbarian, are well laid down, such thatthe Persians who are his pupils do not any longer marry their mothers,nor do the Scythians practise cannibalism on account of the word ofChrist, which has even come as far as them...8681PE4.16.20.

Later in thePE, Eusebius raises the question of why supposedly‘good’demonsdid not intervene to prevent such practices.87By contrast, in thispassage from the very beginning of the work, Eusebius makes it clearthat he considers Christ to have acted where other supposed deitieshad not. Christianity, he suggests, has successfully brought aboutmoral improvement. Eusebius does not allow his audience to losesight of this association between Christianity and morality, more thanonce linking the teaching of Christ and his disciples with the declineof practices like human sacrifice in thePE.88As a result, whileEusebius ties the demons to a range of behaviours that were con-sidered alien and abhorrent, he associates Christianity with the spreadof a moral code that would have been highly valued in Hellenicsociety.However, in order to suggest that Christianity alone representedthe force of civilizing morality, while other religions were connectedwith barbarism, Eusebius effectively had to collapse any distinctionbetween different forms of pagan worship.89The idea that‘paganism’was in any way a monolithic or co-ordinated system of beliefs is, asmodern historians have increasingly come to recognize, highlyinaccurate; rather, the very idea of‘paganism’was a creation ofChristian apologists like Eusebius.90Eusebius presents polytheisticworship in thePEnot merely as inspired by demons, but as beingoriginally alien to Greek society. The myths about the gods and therituals of polytheistic worship, Eusebius suggests, initially came toGreece from the Phoenicians and Egyptians.91It is these nations, hetells us, which‘first began the error’.92This allowed Eusebius topresent all polytheistic worship as being essentially the same andtherefore correspondingly all equallyflawed. Moreover, it suggestedthat polytheistic worship, with its associated myths and rituals, wasnot necessarily to be associated with the‘civilizing’values of Hellenicsociety, since its origins were‘barbarian’.Reflecting this association87PE4.16.21.88As atPE4.15.6, 4.17.4.

Eusebius’demons are unambiguouslywicked, malevolent not by creation, but—far worse—by choice. ThatEusebius’demons should so completely lack any form of redeemingfeature is striking, but hardly unusual among early Christian writers.What is, however, particularly noteworthy about his presentation ofthe demonic is the way in which his demons appear to form anessential part of a cosmos that is completely polarized between thehostile opposing forces of good and evil. Not only are demonsportrayed as wicked, they are consistently contrasted with, andshown as hostile to, everything that is good in the universe. Thisdivision between good and evil provided in turn the basic structurethat underpinned Eusebius’broader thought. Throughout Eusebius’works, wefind every negative concept repeatedly tied to the demonicrealm, while everything good and every benefit to humankind isassociated with God.

A note of caution is needed atthe outset over the use of the term‘dualism’, since this was not coineduntil the early eighteenth century, initially to describe ancient Persianreligion.95It is therefore not a term that Eusebius would have appliedeither to his own thought, or to anyone else’s. Nevertheless, morerecent scholarship has adopted a much broader view of‘dualism’andit can be a useful term for describing particularly polarized systems ofthought. A dualistic religious or philosophical system is usuallyconsidered to consist of two irreconcilably opposed groups or powers,one good and one evil, with no middle ground and no possibility ofcompromise between them.96Yet, even within this broad definition,dualistic beliefs may take a variety of forms, as scholars of dualismhave been keen to emphasize.97Moreover, dualistic views may alsoappear beyond thefields of theological and philosophical speculation,with S. Laeuchli also identifying forms of‘social’,‘psychological’, and‘ethical’dualism.98Dualistic belief systems were not uncommon in the ancient world,and, even among early Christians, Eusebius would not have beenalone in displaying a tendency towards dualism. Several, althoughby no means all, of the texts discovered at Nag Hammadi displayclearly dualistic elements,99while the views of some early Christiangroups later deemed heretical, such as the Marcionites and theValentinians, were condemned by their‘orthodox’opponents for95P.

Gieben, 1986), vol. 6, xxii.96Fontaine, in his multi-volume survey of dualism in the ancient world, offers thefollowing definition of‘dualism’:‘two systems or concepts or principles or groups ofpeople that are utterly opposed and cannot be reduced to one another; they existalongside each other, without any intermediary term; one of the two is always thoughtto be of a much higher quality than the other’:Light and Dark, vol. 1, 263.

Eusebius, after all, strongly condemneddualistic groups like the Manichaeans,103and considered himself partof the‘orthodox’tradition, which proclaimed a faith in one, benevo-lent creator-God.104Furthermore, Eusebius repeatedly emphasizesnot only the moral inferiority of the demons, but also his belief thattheir power and insight were not equal to those of the true ChristianGod. As such, Eusebius avoids outright cosmic dualism, despite thewide polarities which he sees in the universe.Of all the conceptual divisions within Eusebius’thought, the mostobvious is surely the moral divide between good and evil, manifestedin a range of further distinctions between light and darkness, moralityand immorality. Consequently, one might perhaps be justified inspeaking of a‘moral dualism’within Eusebius’thought. Despite thisstark moral divide, Eusebius does not consider the representatives ofthese two moral poles—on the one hand God, and on the other thedevil and his demons—to be entirely independent of each other. Infact, according to the logic of Eusebius’account of the demons’origins, not only demons, but also the devil, must have been part ofGod’s creation. For Eusebius, as we have seen, demons were originallyangels, who had fallen from their blessed state into a state of wicked-ness.105Eusebius also makes it clear that God was the‘maker’(ποιητής) of the angels.106As such, God must also be the‘maker’ofthe demons and their leader, the devil.100Pagels,Origin of Satan, 169; Pagels,Gnostic Gospels,28–9. Such claims were,however, not necessarily accurate, at least in the case of the Valentinians, sinceValentinian texts discovered at Nag Hammadi, such as theGospel of Philip, displayno evidence of dualism: Pagels,Origin of Satan, 171–7.101For example: Matt. 4:1–11, 8:28–34; Mark 5:1–13; Luke 4:1–13, 8:26–33.102Pagels has suggested that a form of‘modified dualism...characterizes the greatmajority of Christian teachings, based...on the conviction that God’s spirit con-stantly contends against Satan’:Origin of Satan, 177.103HE7.31.1–2.104On which tradition, see: Pagels,Gnostic Gospels,28–9.105PE7.16.1–11.106PE4.5.4.

Given theprimarily apologetic aims of the majority of Eusebius’works, it isperhaps unsurprising that he fails to address this question directly.Yet in spite of his reticence, there are some tantalizing hints in hisworks as to how he may have been able to reconcile his belief in thecontinuing presence of such wicked creatures in the universe with abelief in a just and merciful God.One such hint occurs in Eusebius’discussion of the origin of thedemons in book 7 of thePE. Here, after describing how some of thefallen angels were confined to Tartarus by‘the just decision andsentence of the great God’,108Eusebius asserts that:Of these, a petty and small remnant, left behind (καταλειφθέν) aroundthe earth and the air below the moon for the sake of (χάριν) training theathletes of piety, became jointly responsible for the error of polytheism,which is in no way different from atheism, among men.109In its suggestion that different groups of fallen angels had differentfates, this account is somewhat reminiscent of the Enochic story ofthe Watcher angels, in which, while the fallen angels themselves wereimprisoned in darkness at God’s command, the spirits of their off-spring, the giants, remained free on earth to torment humankind.110This passage therefore shows the influence on Eusebius’thought ofjust one of the many accounts of demonic origins that were incirculation at the time. The crucial point here, however, is the impli-cation that above these wicked demons stands a greater power, whichis capable of restraining them, but which for whatever reason haschosen not to do so.

This isclearly a reference to the Christian martyrs of the persecutions. Theportrayal of martyrs as victorious‘athletes’and contestants in theGreek athletic contest, orἀγῶν, was common in much early Christianmartyr literature,111including Eusebius’own.

This sense thatthe role of the demons might in this case ultimately be beneficial isfurther reinforced by Eusebius’use of the wordχάρινhere, since thisword had generally positive connotations, conveying a sense of good-will or favour.114As such, the implication is that, in supplying thedemons as a means of moral training for the pious, God is in factdemonstrating his benevolence, helping people towards salvation. Itis important to note, however, that it would only be by successfullyresisting the hostile actions of the demons that this beneficial effectmight be achieved.There is, of course, no suggestion that the demons might consciouslybe working for the benefit of humankind; rather, they would at best bethe unwitting agents of God’s greater plan for human salvation. More-over, the structure of this sentence leaves intriguingly open the ques-tion of God’s role in permitting the demons to encourage polytheisticworship. The reason they are permitted to remain on earth is given as‘training the athletes of piety’;however,oncetheyhavebeenallowedtoremain, Eusebius suggests that they then proceed to encourage thedevelopment of polytheism. Eusebius seems willing to allow that per-secutions and martyrdoms might have had a potentially corrective orimproving aspect, without being able to see any similar benefitintheexistence of polytheism. He does not make it clear whether he believedthat the demons, once they had been allowed to remain for one,ultimately benevolent, purpose, had then effectively exceeded theirmandate and begun to work other kinds of evil, or whether he feltthat all demonic activity must, in some obscure way, be serving God’sgreater plan. Either way, this one brief phrase demonstrates that,however polarized Eusebius’cosmos, he avoided outright dualism byplacing the demons ultimately under God’s power.Although this suggestion that God might at times use the demonsto serve his own ends is rare in Eusebius, this is not the only placewhere wefind him allowing for the possibility that God mightsometimes permit human suffering in order to achieve an ultimatelypositive goal. Once again, it is only in the context of the persecutionsthat Eusebius seems prepared to entertain this possibility. Describingan abortive attempt by the emperor Aurelian to persecute the church,114LSJ, s.v.χάρις.

Thus, we once againfindEusebius implying that the enemies of the virtuous, be they earthlyor demonic, might take action against the church only when Godallowed.117In this case, Eusebius suggests that God in fact inter-vened to prevent the persecutions, by bringing about Aurelian’sdeath; however, slightly later, wefind God permitting persecutionsto go ahead, by removing his protection from the church.118Euse-bius leaves us in no doubt that he considers this to be entirelyjustified by the growing dissentions and conflicts within the churchat that time: he sees it as a‘godly judgement’(ἡθεία κρίσις), andconsiders that God was simply‘conducting his supervision’(τὴναὐτῆςἐπισκοπὴνἀνακίνει).119Quoting from Psalm 88(89):42, Euse-bius goes even further, claiming that, during these persecutions,God not only removed his protection from the church, but even‘exalted the right hand of his foes’.120Eusebius is thus offering aslightly different interpretation of the persecutions here, in whichthey are not simply the work of hostile and malevolent demons,inflicted on an innocent population, but rather an instrument ofGod’s justice. Their purpose, however, is not simply punitive;instead, Eusebius suggests that God might have allowed this suffer-ing for the essentially merciful purpose of correcting human error,thus leading people back to the path of virtue and salvation.115HE7.30.21.116Eph. 6:12, NRSV trans.117CompareHE8.1.6, where Eusebius asserts that God’s protection prevents a‘wicked demon’from undermining the prosperity of the church.118HE8.1.7–9.119HE8.1.7.120HE8.1.9, NRSV trans.96The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Eusebius’use of the wordπαιδείαςatHE7.30.21 is suggestive: Godwishes to‘educate’people, to help them to improve themselves.Even his punishments might thus, in Eusebius’view, ultimately beseen as evidence of his benevolence.CONCLUSIONSIt therefore seems that, for Eusebius, there was ultimately only onepower in true control of events in the universe, and that power wasthe benevolent Christian God. Thus, while we must see demons inEusebius as a powerful force, capable of disrupting human salvation,enslaving the gullible, and drawing people away from God, there wasclearly no doubt in Eusebius’mind about who the eventual victor inthis greater cosmic conflict would be. The power of the Christian Godfar outweighed that of the demons, who were, ultimately, only part ofGod’s creation. Of course, Eusebius’presentation of the demonicleaves certain questions tantalizingly unanswered. For instance,while Eusebius appears tentatively tofind possible benefits lyingbehind the persecutions, he does not offer a similar explanationof why his benevolent God might have permitted the demons toencourage polytheism, with its attendant suffering and immorality.Eusebius’unmistakable view of demons as a hostile and terrifyingforce to be feared, combatted, and condemned seems at times tosit rather uncomfortably with his faith in the supreme power andbenevolence of God.In view of Eusebius’primarily apologetic aims, we should notexpect tofind a solution to all such questions in his works, since atno point was his purpose principally to outline or explain the func-tion of demons within the universe. Nevertheless, the basic shape ofEusebius’cosmology is consistent and unmistakable. Eusebius envis-aged a universe structured and energized by a fundamental divisionbetween the cosmic forces of good and evil. Ideas about demons, asthe representatives of one of these poles, cannot be neatly excisedfrom other areas of Eusebius’thought, any more than his ideas aboutGod or Christ can be set aside by scholars who wish to understand hisviews.

As an apologist andchurch leader in a period when Christians were adjusting to a newposition of imperial favour, he was able to offer instruction in whathe felt it meant to be a true and virtuous Christian, and how suchvirtue might be achieved. As an historian, he faced the challenge ofexplaining the apparent injustice of earlier persecutions in a mannerconsistent with a belief in a just and omnipotent God. Writing ofConstantine’s career, there was the issue of Licinius’transformationfrom virtuous Christian hero to vicious persecutor to address, andfinally, as the champion of his own doctrinal views, he had to engagewith those‘heretics’he considered to have strayed from the route tovirtue and salvation. Issues of human moral responsibility thereforehad both a theological and a practical significance for Eusebius,occupying a central place both in his understanding of salvationand divine justice, and also in his vision of Christian identity.Few scholars, however, have chosen to examine these issues inmuch detail. Although a number of scholars have previously recog-nized the significance of ideas of‘free will’for Eusebius, their analysishas tended to focus on the longer discussions of moral responsibilityfound in thePraeparatio Evangelica(PE),Demonstratio Evangelica(DE), andTheophania(Theoph.).1While thePEundoubtedly1See, for example: Sirinelli,Les vues historiques, 359; Amand,Fatalisme et liberté,355; Lyman,Christology and Cosmology, 102.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"contains Eusebius’most comprehensive discussion of many of theissues surrounding human responsibility and accountability, most ofEusebius’statements on the subject, particularly in book 6, occur inthe context of a broader rebuttal of the doctrine of an all-powerfulfate.

Eusebius’statements on the subject inhis more philosophical and theological works need to be consideredalongside the examples of human virtue and vice presented in workssuch as theHistoria ecclesiastica(HE) andVita Constantini(VC)inorder to achieve a full picture of his views on such a complex topic.In particular, it is essential to explore how Eusebius presents therelationship between demons and humans when assessing his viewson human responsibility. Eusebius’works provide countless examplesof interaction between demonic and human agents, notably in thecommission of wicked acts and vicious behaviour, which have beenignored in previous scholarship. These examples can provide a freshperspective on Eusebius’understanding of human freedom of actionand moral accountability. They take us beyond the more theoreticaldiscussions of thePEand allow us to observe his views‘in action’,bringing to the fore questions about the balance between externalinfluence and human free choice.

Moreover, observinghow Eusebius presents the relationship between humans and demonscan also help to shed light on how he pictured the opposite relation-ship, between humans and the divine. Above all, the role of thedemonic in encouraging human wickedness ought to be examinedsimply because a threatening demonic presence was central to Euse-bius’understanding of the universe. As David Brakke has noted, earlyChristian‘ethical life...took place within the context of cosmicstruggle’against the devil and the forces of evil.2For Eusebius,questions about how and why humans might be drawn to sin cannotbe separated from questions about precisely how demons, as part oftheir battle against God, act with or upon their human victims. Theissue of human moral responsibility is inseparably connected inEusebius’works with questions about demonic responsibility forwickedness.2Brakke,Demons and the Making of the Monk, 10.100The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"It is important to note at the outset, however, that even whenapproaching Eusebius’understanding of human responsibility fromthis new perspective, there will be aspects of his thought that remainfrustratingly obscure. At times, Eusebius’ideas might appear some-what vague or circular—Sirinelli considered Eusebius’discussion ofthe relationship between human‘free will’and divine providence tobe‘fragile’and‘inadequate’.3Moreover, the challenges involved indealing with subjects as complex as human freedom of action andmoral responsibility are not small. Ancient and modern terminolo-gies rarely correspond in this area. For instance, as with many ancientthinkers, the issue of moral responsibility is discussed by Eusebiusmainly in terms of praise and blame, or reward and punishment,4andwe should therefore not expect tofind a clear and consistent term for‘moral responsibility’in Eusebius’works. Similarly, a term such as‘free will’has become so heavily burdened with the concerns ofcenturies of later philosophers as to pose particular problems foranyone attempting to understand earlier debates. As a result, anyattempt to understand Eusebius’thought in this area must begin, notwith modern terms and later concerns, but with close attention bothto the expressions which Eusebius favoured and to the debates of hisown time with which he was engaging.It is therefore only by treating Eusebius’thought on its own terms,and paying attention to a wide range of his works, that we can hope toreach a proper understanding of his views on human agency andmoral responsibility. This approach makes it clear that, for Eusebius,as for many early Christians, maintaining human accountability wasof central importance to his conception of salvation. The belief thatpeople were responsible and therefore answerable for their decisions,both good and bad, allowed for the administration of justice, particu-larly divine justice, and meant that the reward of salvation could beseen as fairly bestowed. Yet it also reveals that, despite the heavy3Sirinelli,Les vues historiques, 362:‘...la fragilité ou plutôt l’insuffisance de lathèse soutenue par Eusèbe’.4Bobzien has noted that the Stoics similarly discussed moral responsibility interms of praise and blame: S. Bobzien,‘Stoic Conceptions of Freedom and theirRelation to Ethics’, in R. Sorabji, ed.,Aristotle and After(London: Institute of ClassicalStudies, 1997), 73.

His under-standing of human behaviour allowed considerable room for externalinfluence, for better or worse, without, however, removing people’sultimate responsibility for their actions.

Such a view may be characterized as simul-taneously empowering and dispiriting—Eusebius’understanding ofhuman responsibility allowed people a role in securing their ownsalvation, but at the same time placed considerable obstacles in theirpath, most notably in the form of threatening and hostile demons.BACKGROUNDDiscussions of the issues of human agency and moral responsibility—particularly among early Christian writers like Eusebius—are fre-quently approached by scholars in terms of a question of‘free will’.5There are, however, considerable risks involved in applying this termto ideas expressed in the early fourth century. Although for manyyears scholars assumed that free will was such a basic and fundamen-tal concept that all people, including those in the ancient world, musthave shared it, recent scholarship has come to recognize instead that‘free will’is in fact a‘technical, philosophical notion’: one that wasdeveloped by philosophers and gradually changed over time.6As a5See, for example: Lyman,Christology and Cosmology, 6, 161; H.

Eppling,‘A Study of the Patristic Doctrine of Free Will’, Master’s thesis,Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Wake Forest, North Carolina, 2009. This isnot exclusively a problem for early Christian authors—similar concerns have beenraised about scholarship on ideas of agency in Plotinus: E. Eliasson,The Notion ofThat Which Depends On Usin Plotinus and Its Background(Leiden: Brill, 2008), 2.6M. Frede,A Free Will: Origins of the Notion in Ancient Thought, ed. A. A. Long(Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2011), 2. Moreover, as Frede pointedout, the concept of‘free will’is dependent on having an understanding not only of‘will’, but also of‘freedom’, and‘a notion of a will is not necessarily a notion of a willwhich is free’:A Free Will, 7.

Since‘free will’is not afixed, universal notion,but rather a shifting, invented concept, gradually changing and devel-oping over time, applying it to Eusebius’works risks imposing analien, anachronistic idea on his thought.The difficulty with using the concept of free will to approachancient thought is further exacerbated by considerable terminologicalconfusion.

The fact that scholars have come tocompletely different conclusions about the appropriate Greek termfor‘free will’serves only to illustrate the confusion which might arisefrom such an approach.14Thus, rather than trying tofind an expres-sion for‘free will’in Eusebius’works, and thereby perhaps distortinghis ideas, it will be far more helpful to try to consider his thought onits own terms, by paying careful attention to the vocabulary whichEusebius actually employed.

For Christians, the need to reconcile theirbelief in a benevolent divine providence with undeniable examples ofhuman wickedness and suffering in the world made questions of theorigin of evil and human responsibility matters of pressing theologicalsignificance.26Moreover, as a result of their belief in divine providence,early Christians also found themselves accused of determinism by theiropponents.27TheOctaviusof Minucius Felix records the accusationthat Christians simply replaced a belief in fate with a belief in God.28This was immediately followed by the further criticism that, as a result,the notion of afinal judgement was inherently unjust, since it wouldpunish people for actions over which they had no control.29Perhapspartly in order to rebut such accusations, many early Christian writersargued strongly against a determinist view of the universe.30Opposingthe idea of‘fated necessity’(εἱμαρμένηςἀναγκην), Justin Martyr arguedinstead that people possessed‘free choice’(ἐλευθέρᾳπροαιρέσει)overtheir actions.31The only kind of‘fate’which Justin was prepared toadmit was that both the good and the wicked would inevitably receivethe reward or punishment which their actions merited.32Tatian like-wise argued that people possessed freedom of action, which allowed forthe distribution of both praise and blame.33For both Tatian and Justin,defending human freedom of action was linked both to a defence ofdivine justice and simultaneously to the maintenance of a system ofethics. Human freedom and moral responsibility were thus subjects ofdiscussion for both Christian and non-Christian writers in the centur-ies before Eusebius was writing, and were approached both from anethical and a theological standpoint.24See, for example: Justin,1 Apol.43.1–5; Orig.de Princ.3.1.5–6; Tatian,Orat.7.25See, for example:CH45.1–2.26S.

He cites Alexander of Aphrodisias’treatise at length in thePE,35while his claim that a determinist view offate or necessity would remove all basis for praise and blame is alsoreminiscent of the arguments of Tatian and Justin.36For a writer likeEusebius, who frequently uses examples of divine punishment andreward as evidence of the power of the Christian God, maintainingthe justice of such divine interventions would have been of para-mount importance.

Thepolemical nature of these sections provides little scope for a nuancedor complex exposition of his views on human freedom of action.Instead, wefind mainly forthright assertions of the responsibility ofrational creatures for their behaviour.38Although it is, of course,undeniable that Eusebius consistently sought to maintain humanresponsibility, looking beyond these sections of thePEto theexamples of human virtue and vice that appear in some of his morehistorical works suggests that there was rather more to his views thanhis straightforward assertions of human responsibility might imply.AtVC3.26.1, for instance, Eusebius states that‘at one time impiousmen, or rather, the whole race of demons through them, eagerly34ParticularlyPE6.6, which is headed:‘Refutation of the argument concerningfate’.

Similarly, in theHE, Eusebius suggests that accusationsof magical practices levelled against Christians were ultimately thework of the devil, asserting that‘it was through the activity of the devilthat such magicians took on the name of the Christians to slanderzealously the great mystery of piety with magic and, through thesemeans, to disparage the doctrines of the church’.39In both of thesecases, Eusebius appears to suggest that responsibility for the wickedact in question might not lie exclusively with the human beings whocarried it out. These examples bring the question of the relationshipbetween personal responsibility and external influence intriguingly tothe fore. Examining such cases of interaction between humans anddemons can therefore help to shed more light on Eusebius’under-standing of human moral responsibility, by showing if, where, andhow Eusebius set any limits to human responsibility.RESPONSIBILITY ANDΠΡΟΑΙΡΕΣΙΣClearly it is unhelpful, if not inappropriate, to apply the concept of‘free will’to Eusebius’thought. Rather than restricting our discussionof Eusebius’views by imposing on his works a concept which there isno evidence to suggest he possessed, it will be more helpful toconsider what Eusebius may have meant by some of the terms hedid use. Although translators of his works have, in the past, turned arange of words and phrases, such asτὸαὐτεξούσιον,ἡπροαίρεσις, andτὰἐφ’ἡμῖν, into‘free will’,40a careful examination of Eusebius’use of39HE3.26.4. The fact that one of the activities of these magicians was‘to slander’(διαβαλεῖν) the church further connects them and their actions to the devil, since theGreek word for the devil (διάβολος) was derived from the verbδιαβάλλω. On theetymology of this word, see: Riley,‘Devil’, 463. Here, Eusebius is picking up on an ideaexpressed by Justin, who had suggested that Menander was driven to practise magicalarts by demons. Eusebius cites the relevant passage of Justin (1 Apol.26) atHE3.26.3.40Gifford’s translation of thePEis particularly generous in its use of‘free will’,using it to translate a variety of expressions.The Preparation for the Gospel, trans. withintro.

Frequency of appearance alone suggeststhat, of these terms,προαίρεσιςwas the most significant for Eusebius.Eusebius uses forms of the wordπροαίρεσιςalmost forty times in thePEalone, with a further eighteen appearances in quotations. Bycontrast, forms ofαὐτεξούσιοςandαὐθεκούσιοςappear only thirty-one times in total in thePE, of which ten are in quotations.41Settingaside quotations, then, in thePEEusebius usesπροαίρεσιςalmosttwice as much asαὐτεξούσιοςandαὐθεκούσιοςcombined. In Euse-bius’view it wasπροαίρεσις, the capacity for people to choose betweenright and wrong, which allowed praise and blame to be assigned. As aresult, discovering what Eusebius considered the conditions ofπροαίρεσιςto be is essential to understanding how and where he feltmoral responsibility could be attributed.It is in book 6 of thePEthat wefind Eusebius’clearest statementsof the significance ofπροαίρεσις—for him, it isπροαίρεσιςthat leads aperson into either virtue or vice. AtPE6.6.48, Eusebius writes that, byGod’s gift, people are ultimately responsible for themselves, describ-ing humankind as‘free and self-ruling’(ἐλευθέρα καὶαὐτοκράτωρ).He does not suggest, however, that this responsibility is without limit.Rather, Eusebius identifies three types of causation—there are‘thingswhich are up to us’(τὰἐφ’ἡμῖν), things which occur‘accordingto nature’(κατὰφύσιν), and things which are‘accidental’(κατὰσυμβεβηκός).42It is these‘things which are up to us’that most concernEusebius in this passage. He dismisses the idea that evil stems eitherfrom nature or from accidental events, which leaves it as one of those‘things which are up to us’. Moreover, Eusebius makes it clear thatthese‘things which are up to us’are governed byπροαίρεσις,arguingthat evil results only from‘the self-chosen (αὐτοπροαιρέτῳ)movementof the soul’.43This is reinforced a few lines later, when Eusebiusi.163;τῇαὐτεξουσιότητι(DE4.6.8), i.175; Philostratus,The Life of Apollonius ofTyana, The Epistles of Apollonius and the Treatise of Eusebius, ed. and trans.F.

In theCH, the human soul is described as‘self-governor and judge, leader andlord of itself’.45Likewise, the‘things which are up to us’are againlinkedfirmly toπροαίρεσις, being defined as‘those things whichhappen according to choice (προαίρεσίν) and action’.46In associatingπροαίρεσιςwith that which is‘up to us’, Eusebiuswas conforming to a long philosophical tradition reaching back toAristotle.47Aristotle had argued that, while we might wish (βούλησις)for impossible things,48choice (προαίρεσις) was not concerned withthings that were impossible (τῶνἀδυνάτων).49As a result, Aristotleconcludes that‘it seems thatπροαίρεσιςis about the things which areup to us (τὰἐφ’ἡμῖν)’.50Moreover, for Aristotle,προαίρεσιςwasclosely connected with the attainment of virtue.51Similarly, theCHmakes it clear that the things which are‘up to us’include matters ofvirtue and vice, asserting that‘out of the things which are up to us,each person acquires by choice itself an impulse towards one or theother of virtue or wickedness’.52For Eusebius, as for Aristotle, theconcept ofπροαίρεσιςwas inseparable from questions of virtue andvice, and thus from moral responsibility. People were, in his view,responsible for the things that were in their power to control, includ-ing the choice between good and bad.Vitae Homeri, as well as twice in Origen’sExhortatio ad martyriumand once in hisScholia in Matthaeum. Eusebius uses the term far more often than these earlierwriters—the sameTLGsearch returned eight results for Eusebius’works. This surelyreflects the importance ofπροαίρεσιςto Eusebius’thought. Slightly later, this termappears to have been popular with Cyril of Jerusalem, as it appears several times in hisCatecheses ad illuminandos.44PE6.6.51.

Here, as we have seen,the key distinction drawn between the demons and their angeliccounterparts is one ofπροαίρεσις. Demons and angels should not,in Eusebius’view, bear the same name as each other—even thoughontologically they are essentially the same—primarily because theyare different‘in their choice’(τὴν προαίρεσιν).53It is, above all, theirπροαίρεσιςof good or evil that defines each of these groups. Thus, itseems that Eusebius feltπροαίρεσιςto lie at the heart of the respon-sibility not just of humans, but of all rational creatures, be theyhuman, angelic, or demonic.54This means not only that Eusebius’discussions of demonic responsibility can help to shed light on hisviews of the responsibility of other rational beings, but also that anysituation in which theπροαίρεσειςof different rational creaturesinteract to produce either vice or virtue must raise questions aboutwhere he believed moral responsibility principally to lie.Crucially, Eusebius suggests that it was, above all, theirπροαίρεσιςthat made people vulnerable to the attacks of demons. The devil,Eusebius informs us, rapidly discovered that people could‘fall intoevil with ease from their own thoughts through their self-determinedchoice (προαίρεσιν)’.55This is in spite of the fact that Eusebius alsoheld that the soul—the home ofπροαίρεσις—was by nature inclinedto follow a virtuous path.56Such a view would surely have meant thatEusebius considered any person who went against this natural inclin-ation to be even more deserving of condemnation.57Nevertheless, forEusebius it was this very ability of the soul to choose the worse as wellas the better path that made possible the attribution of either praise orblame, as appropriate.58Προαίρεσιςwas therefore at the heart ofEusebius’ethical thought; it also served an important role in histheodicy, helping to absolve God of responsibility for evil. By declar-ing that‘the source of wickedness’(τῆς κακίας πηγή) is to be found‘only in the self-chosen movement of the soul’(ἐν μόνῃτῇτῆς ψυχῆς53PE4.5.5.54It is essential to remember that, in spite of the heavy emphasis which Eusebiusplaced on the irrationality of demonic behaviour, he nevertheless considered them tobe rational creatures:PE13.15.6.55DE4.9.5.

For him, it was what determined virtue or vice,praise or blame and, thus, ultimately, reward or punishment.Προαίρεσις, however, was not a capacity shared by the whole ofcreation; rather, Eusebius held that it was exclusive to rational beingsand linked it repeatedly to the reasoning powers of the soul. ForEusebius, the human soul was characterized above all by its rational-ity, which was not only a gift from God, but also the means by whichhumankind could be said to bear the image of God.60By locatingπροαίρεσιςwithin the soul, Eusebius was therefore associating itclosely with rationality. Indeed, Eusebius went so far as to combine‘reason (λογισμὸν) and the choice (προαίρεσιν) which is up to us’,declaring them to be‘by nature of the soul’.61Likewise in theContraHieroclem(CH), those‘things not up to us’(τὰοὐκἐφ’ἡμῖν)—thingsunconnected withπροαίρεσις—are said to be‘without soul andirrational’(ἄψυχά τεὄντα καὶἄλογα).62This sense that rationality was a key condition ofπροαίρεσιςforEusebius is further strengthened by the striking distinction which hedraws between the soul and the human body, even describing them atone point as‘opposites’(ἐναντίων).63Although Eusebius explicitlydenies that the material body is evil,64he presents it as distinctlyinferior to the soul. Where the soul is rational and immortal, the bodyis irrational and subject to death and decay.65When, in theCH,προαίρεσιςand the‘things which are up to us’are connected to thesoul, the‘things not up to us’are said to be those which‘concern thebody and external things’(περὶτὸσῶμα καὶτὰἐκτός).66Theirrational body thus lies outside the realm of rationalπροαίρεσις.Indeed, Eusebius even suggests that it might be necessary forπροαίρεσις, characterized by reason, to act directly counter to thebody, arguing that‘προαίρεσις, persuaded by wise arguments...strikes away the nature of the body’.67This opposition betweenπροαίρεσιςand the irrational body reinforces the idea that rationality59PE6.6.47.60For example:PE3.10.6.

Yet in associatingπροαίρεσιςso closely with the cap-acity for reasoning, Eusebius leaves open the question of whereresponsibility might lie in cases where rationality is lacking.A second key condition ofπροαίρεσιςforEusebiuswasthatitshould be free and unconstrained.68Eusebius describes human-kind’s‘more divine part’(τῇθειοτέρᾳμοίρᾳ)—the soul, and homeofπροαίρεσις—as possessing its‘own freedom’(τὴνοἰκείανἐλευθερίαν).69This is in contrast to the‘nature of the body’(φύσεισώματος) to which it seems people are enslaved. Eusebius suggeststhat people must‘be slaves to’(δουλεῦον) the body, and furtherdescribes people as‘both slave and free’(καὶδοῦλον εἶναι τὸναὐτὸνκαὶἐλεύθερον) in relation to their body and soul respectively.70For Eusebius, it seems that this human freedom consisted of twomain kinds: freedomfromexternal constraint, and freedomtomakean alternative choice. The idea thatπροαίρεσιςmust be free fromexternal constraint is emphasized by the contrast which Eusebiusdraws betweenπροαίρεσιςand‘external necessity’(τῆςἔξωθενἀνάγκης).71For him, the two stood in opposition to each other, asacting under the constraint of necessity or fate would, in his view,remove any grounds for praise or blame.72This is further reflected in Eusebius’frequent use of words such asαὐτεξούσιος,αὐθεκούσιος, andἐλεύθεροςto describe eitherπροαίρεσις,or related words for choice, such asαἵρεσις.73AtDE4.1.4, forinstance, Eusebius asserts that God created‘the souls of men suppliedby nature with unconstrained freedom (ἐλεύθερον) of self-determinedchoice (τῆςαὐθεκουσίου αἱρεσεως) between the good and the oppos-ite’. Although in modern translations of Christian authors, includingEusebius, the termαὐτεξούσιοςis sometimes rendered as‘free will’,74its original meaning among Greek philosophers was simply‘in one’s68For example, see:CH47.2.69PE6.6.26.70PE6.6.26.71PE6.6.11.

For Eusebius, what this freedom from external con-straint means, it seems, is that people should have the opportunityto make an alternative choice. Eusebius argues that because of‘self-determined freedom’(τῆςαὐτεξουσίουἐλευθερίας) it is possible topraise someone for their‘choice of the better’(τὴντῶν κρειττόνωναἵρεσιν), since they also possess the freedom to choose‘the opposite’(τὴνἐναντίαν).76Thus, in Eusebius’view,προαίρεσις, and conse-quently moral responsibility, are dependent not only on a person’srationality, but also on their freedom to choose between at least twoalternative courses of action.Yet, while Eusebius believed freedom to be a necessary condition ofπροαίρεσις, he also suggests that this freedom could, at times, becompromised or challenged. One source of these challenges was thehuman body, subject as it was to passions and desires. This, however,was not the main challenge, for Eusebius argues that it ought to bepossible forπροαίρεσιςto overcome the weaknesses of the body.77More intriguing is Eusebius’suggestion that a person’sπροαίρεσιςmight be influenced, for better or worse, by other, externalπροαίρεσεις.Eusebius argues that, while the body is affected by external needsand desires,so sometimes alsoπροαίρεσις, troubled by numberless externalπροαίρ-εσεις, is persuaded by its self-determined opinion to deliver itself up toexternal things and sometimes it ends up better and sometimes worse.For just as being with the wicked makes one bad, so again on the otherhand the company of the good makes for improvement.7875See: Frede,A Free Will, 75; Kahn,‘Discovering the Will’, 250.76PE6.6.49. See also:PE6.6.51;DE4.1.4. This notion thatπροαίρεσιςmust be achoice of alternatives was a comparatively recent development. As Frede has shown, itis found in Alexander of Aphrodisias’De fato, in which praise and blame areconnected with the ability to choose the better or worse of two options (Alexanderof Aphrodisias,De fato, 12; Frede,A Free Will, 100), but for earlier philosophers, suchas Aristotle, this had not necessarily been the case. Frede suggests that‘the choice onemakes in Aristotle is not, at least necessarily, a choice between doing X and not doingX...It is a matter of choosing to do X, or failing to choose to do X, such that X doesnot get done’: Frede,A Free Will,28–9.77PE6.6.34–5.78PE6.6.42.114The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"In the past, this passage has been read as referring simply to the influenceof‘a general and pervasive social pressure’.79However, it is unlikely,given Eusebius’strong belief in the threat posed by demons, that hewould have been thinking solely of other humanπροαίρεσειςhere.Indeed, in theLC, Eusebius suggests that while human enemies directtheir attacks against the body, invisible, spiritual enemies focus theirattention on attacking the invisible soul, whereπροαίρεσιςwas located.80This suggests that we should see this reference to externalπροαίρεσειςasreferring as much to spiritual as to other humanπροαίρεσεις. It thereforeseems that, in Eusebius’view, it was possible for demons to compromisethe independence of humanπροαίρεσις, raising the question of whereresponsibility for wickedness might lie in such cases.DEMONIC INFLUENCEFor Eusebius, then, any discussion of the issue of responsibility mustbe approached primarily in terms ofπροαίρεσις. It wasπροαίρεσις—achoice which must be both free and made by a rational being—that inhis view determined between virtue and vice, and thus whether aperson deserved punishment or reward. Yet this close associationbetweenπροαίρεσις, rationality, and freedom leads inevitably to ques-tions about how and if Eusebius believed responsibility shouldbe assigned in situations where one, or both, of the conditions ofπροαίρεσιςwere not met—in other words, where either rationality orfreedom was compromised. This issue is of particular relevance forEusebius’discussions of the relationship between demons andhumans, since he so often presents those humans he believed to bein the power of demons as irrational,81and even, at times, as enslavedto demons.82We must therefore ask whether Eusebius believed that79Chesnut,First Christian Histories, 82, and compare: Chesnut,‘Fate, Fortune,Free Will and Nature’, 178. See also Berkhoff, who suggested, presumably on the basisof this passage, that Eusebius believed a person’s free action could be compromised by‘the free will of other people’(‘durch den freien Willen anderer Menschen’):DieTheologie, 104.80LC7.1.81For example:HE7.31.1, 10.8.9–10;VC1.45.2–3;LC7.7, 9.13;Theoph. 1.78, 2.1;PE4.17.3.82For example:LC5.3;PE4.17.4;DE4.9.8;VC1.13.3.Demonic Influence and Human Responsibility115OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"this demonic influence in any way lessened people’s responsibility fortheir sins.In spite of Eusebius’insistence in thePEthat people must bearresponsibility for their own actions, there is nevertheless some sug-gestion in his other works that those acting at the instigation ofdemons might merit sympathy as much as condemnation. In theVC, Eusebius suggests that Constantine’s response to the behaviourof schismatic congregations in Africa—congregations which Eusebiusbelieved to lie under demonic influence83—was less one of anger thanof pity, reporting that the emperor‘grieved excessively (ὑπεραλγοῦντα)at the senselessness of the mentally injured’.84Similarly, Eusebiusclaims that Constantine believed the Donatists‘should be pitied ratherthan chastised’, because they were‘either entirely deranged or stunginto madness by the wicked demon’.85The suggestion seems to be that,deprived of their rationality by demons, the human agents in this casewere no longer responsible for their crimes.However, in spite of Eusebius’attempts in theVCto tie Constan-tine’s religious views to his own, there are several hints in this workthat the two were not in complete agreement on theological matters.86In particular, Eusebius appears to have felt that Constantine was toolenient in the standards of piety and ethical behaviour required ofnew Christian converts. AtVC4.54.2–3, for instance, Eusebius comescloser than at almost any other point in theVCto criticizing Con-stantine directly. Here, Eusebius refers to people who‘crept into thechurch and falsely assumed the name of Christians’,87clearly describ-ing those who had converted since Christianity had found imperialfavour. He suggests, however, that Constantine was too trusting ofthese people’s‘outer form’(τῷσχήματι),88implying that he thoughtConstantine ought to have required more of those wishing to convertthan simple profession of the Christian name. This apparent83Eusebius repeatedly suggests in theVCthat divisions within the church, includ-ing the Donatist schism, were the work either of a‘wicked demon’or of‘envy’, which,as we have seen, often characterized demonic activity in Eusebius’works:VC1.45.2–3,2.61.3–4, 3.4.1, 3.59.1–2.84VC3.4.1.85VC1.45.3.

Moreover, Eusebius’use of the verbὑπεραλγύνωatVC3.4.1,with its suggestion of excessive grief, implies that he believed theemperor to have taken his sympathy rather too far. We shouldtherefore be cautious about reading these references to Constantine’sreaction as representative of Eusebius’own views. Nevertheless, itdoes suggest that there was more than one acceptable response to theissue of human transgression in this period.The idea that those committing wicked acts might not be entirelyculpable for their actions, but might instead merit sympathy did havesome precedent in earlier Greek thought. In theTimaeus, Plato hadmade the striking claim that it was wrong to blame the wicked fortheir actions,89since wickedness arose, not voluntarily, but rather‘theone who is bad becomes bad through some wicked habit of the bodyand uneducated rearing’.90Thus wickedness might be seen to have, inpart, a physical cause, but also to arise from a failure of education—that is, arguably, from unsuitable external influence. In consequence,Plato suggests that‘the parents are always more responsible than thechildren, and the ones doing the educating more than those edu-cated’.91In other words, it seems that Plato is suggesting that thosewho encourage, or at least fail to check, wickedness in others are moreat fault than those actually committing wicked deeds. At the veryleast, he is challenging the view that a wicked person is entirelyresponsible for their crimes.Although such a view was certainly not representative of Greekphilosophy more broadly, and was not even much repeated inPlatonic thought, Plato’s further claim in theTimaeusthat‘no onedoes wrong voluntarily’was much more widely shared.92Plato made89See: C.

Indeed, the notion that wickedness must be involuntary posedconsiderable problems for early Christian writers who, like Eusebius,were also steeped in the traditions of Greek philosophy, since it wasflatly contradicted by scripture.97As a result, the question of howhuman sin might occur was a pressing one for Christian writers.Moreover, it is clear that, within the philosophical tradition, outrightcondemnation was far from being the only possible reaction to thoseperceived to be acting in an immoral way.It is significant, therefore, that the emphasis throughout Eusebius’works remains very heavily on the punishment of wrongdoers,including those he presents as acting at the instigation of demons.For instance, Eusebius suggests in theVCandDe laudibus Constan-tini(LC) that those of Constantine’s imperial predecessors whopersecuted Christians were in some way enslaved to demons,98surelyimplying that they must lack the freedom necessary forπροαίρεσις.Similarly, he frequently presents thesefigures, and others he felt to bein the power of demons, as acting irrationally, or as in the grip of aform of madness,99again apparently denying them one of the neces-sary conditions ofπροαίρεσις. Yet this did not prevent him describingin graphic detail some of the punishments supposedly inflicted onthese people as a consequence of their actions.100Since Eusebius held93Gill,‘The Body’s Fault?’, 62, citing Plato,Protagoras345d–e;Gorgias, 509e;Laws731c, 734b.94T.

It therefore seems that, for Eusebius, if not necessarily forConstantine, the suggestion of external demonic influence was notenough to remove responsibility from the human wrongdoer. Wemust therefore ask how Eusebius was able to reconcile his evidentbelief in the culpability of his human sinners with the suggestion thatthey were not acting entirely independently.First, it is essential to note that, for Eusebius, the demonic threat tohumankind did not consist solely or even primarily in the kind ofdemonic possession which he believed could be cured through exor-cism. The Gospels famously contain various accounts of Jesus per-forming an exorcism to free a man from the control of demons.101Here the possessed man is not presented as being to blame for hispredicament; he is not punished or held to account for his actionswhilst under demonic control. Rather, on being released from thedemons he appears to have returned to his true state, and his reactionis one of gratitude. This kind of demonic attack therefore involvescausing immediate harm to a person, who is depicted as a victim ofthe demons. This idea that bad demons might bring physical harm inthe form of sickness or natural disasters was also shared with non-Christians.102Eusebius was undoubtedly familiar with this view ofdemons, and we canfind echoes of the Gospel exorcism stories in hisown works.103Eusebius even suggests that exorcisms using Jesus’name to drive out demons continued to be effective in his owntime.104Similarly, in his discussion of oracles in theDE, Eusebius appearsto suggest that some of those making oracular predictions may havefallen so completely under the influence of demons that they were‘like a corpse’(οἷα νεκρὸν) and were no longer capable of actingfor themselves.105Such cases, however, are extremely unusual inEusebius. Even in this example, Eusebius was making a point aboutthe fallibility of pagan oracles, rather than about the nature of thedemonic threat in general. Moreover, Eusebius suggests that the name101Matt. 8:28–34; Mark 5:1–20; Luke 8:26–33.102For example: Porph.Abst.2.40.1.103For example:PE5.17.13;CI95.18–19.104CH4.2.105DE5.Praef.26.Demonic Influence and Human Responsibility119OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"ofμαντείαgiven by the Greeks to this state indicates that it was‘like amadness’(ὥσπερ τινὰμανίαν).106In the suggestion thatμαντείαmaybe comparable to, but is not identical withμανία, it is clear thatEusebius believed that madness could also take other forms. Thus,when Eusebius describes those he believed to be in the power ofdemons as mad or irrational, he would not necessarily have had inmind the kind of complete demonic possession outlined here or in theGospel exorcism stories. In fact, overall, Eusebius’concern about thedemonic threat appears to have focused less on this kind of completepossession than on a more insidious form of attack, which, in leavinghuman responsibility intact, posed a threat not only to the presentwell-being of humankind, but also to its future salvation.Eusebius rarely presents demons as in any way coercing theirhuman victims. Demons, as we saw in the section‘DeceptiveDemons’in Chapter 2,107are associated with trickery and deceit,but there is little suggestion of force—an omission which is of con-siderable importance in maintaining human responsibility. Demonsare not shown as forcing people to worship them. Instead, they adoptsubtler tactics, using their limited powers to create the false impres-sion that they could predict the future, or cure diseases—therebytricking people into worshipping them.108In fact, Eusebius is so farfrom suggesting that demons compel people to act that he evenargues that some humans might at times be capable of coercingdemons. Discussing the practice of magic, Eusebius claims thatsome demons may be‘dragged down and constrained by vulgarmen’.109When this happens, the demons are said to be acting‘byforce and necessity’(βίᾳκαὶἀνάγκῃ).110Eusebius raises this point inorder to argue that such demons are not truly divine,111rather than aspart of a broader discussion of responsibility, and he therefore doesnot elaborate on how blame for any wickedness might be apportionedin such a case. Nonetheless, this suggests that, for Eusebius, in spite ofhumans’ontological inferiority, the demons did not necessarily havethe power to coerce people into sin. Yet this should not be seen asdecreasing the severity of the demonic threat; rather, it is surely theirfailure to compel humans that makes demons so dangerous. Externalcompulsion would have removed one of the necessary conditions ofπροαίρεσις, and thus have removed human responsibility for sin.106DE5.Praef.26.107See Chapter 2.108PE5.2.1;VC3.56.1.109PE5.9.10.110PE5.9.13.111PE5.9.12.120The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"With that human responsibility intact, on the other hand, demonscould not only torment people in this life, but might also lead them toact in a manner that would jeopardize their ultimate salvation.Rather than compelling people to serve them, it seems that Eusebiusbelieved that demons acted on existing human weaknesses in order tolure people into sin. In thePE, Eusebius agrees with Porphyry’ssuggestion that wicked demons‘excite the desires of men’(τὰςἐπιθυμίαςτῶνἀνθρώπωνἐκκαίειν), in order to encourage people to followthem.112Rather than implanting into people a wickedness which isnot already there, it would seem that demons take advantage ofnatural human weaknesses, such as the inclination of the inferiorbody towards passion, in order to incite people to sin.113This ideais reflected in one of Eusebius’most detailed descriptions of how asoul might fall into the power of demons, where the emphasis isagain very strongly on the role of passions in leading to wickedness.In his speech on the Church at Tyre, Eusebius describes how,‘bythe envy and jealousy of the evil-loving demon, it [the soul] becameof its self-determined choice (ἐξαὐτεξουσίου αἱρέσεως) a lover ofpassion (φιλοπαθὴς) and a lover of evil’.114Immediately below,Eusebius shows how this fallen soul was then subjected to still moredemonic attacks, as‘a destructive demon and savage mental beasts(θῆρεςἄγριοι νοητοί)...light afire beneath it with their passions, as ifburning it with the missiles of their own wickedness’.115Demonshave a role to play in encouraging wickedness and vice, but Eusebiusis careful to stress that this encouragement does not remove humanresponsibility, by pointing out that the choice remains‘self-determined’(αὐτεξούσιος). For Eusebius, the demonic threat therefore seems toinvolve exploiting a person’s existing weaknesses in order to lead themto make aflawed choice for which they must then bear responsibility.This is reflected in Eusebius’description of the‘savage beasts’which attack the fallen soul in his speech on the Church at Tyre asνοητός.116Eusebius’frequent association of demons with wild beastsmakes it clear that, by‘savage beasts’, he is again referring todemons.117His use of the wordνοητόςsuggests that he may haveheld a view of demonic influence similar to that found earlier in the112PE4.21.6.

For Eusebius, things which wereνοητόςwere incor-poreal and rational, associated with the mind rather than with thephysical senses.118This therefore corresponds to Eusebius’claim thatdemons mount‘invisible’attacks,119and furtherfixes these attacks ina mental or intellectual, rather than a physical, sphere.This is reminiscent of Origen’s suggestion that demons generatewicked thoughts to encourage people into sin.120Yet Origen is clearthat this external influence does not remove human responsibility.Drawing on the Stoic idea of‘first movements’, in which it was heldthat a person must choose to assent to an initial impression fromoutside before it could become a full internal emotion or passion,121Origen insists that such thoughts are only‘an inducement, provokingus either to good or to evil’.122According to Origen, it is quitepossible for people to‘throw the vicious suggestions away fromus’.123Although Eusebius does not explore this issue in the samedepth as Origen, given his familiarity with Origen’s works he wouldundoubtedly have been aware of this idea. In his suggestion that thedemonic threat is concentrated mainly in mental, rather than phys-ical, attacks, Eusebius appears to be echoing this idea. Temptationand trickery, rather than compulsion, lie at the heart of Eusebius’understanding of the demonic threat, thus leaving human responsi-bility intact. Nevertheless, the process that Eusebius is describing inthese passages from the speech on the Church at Tyre still refers to asoul in which the conditions forπροαίρεσιςare met: the soul is bothrational,124and it is able to act independently. It is only once thisinitial choice has been made that the soul then falls more fully underthe power of demons.125As a result, this description tells us littleabout how Eusebius felt human responsibility might be maintainedeven in those cases where a soul is said to be entirely in the power ofdemons.118PE11.7.1, 11.9.3.

This emerges mostclearly from some of Eusebius’comments in theVCandLC. Evenwhile describing Constantine’s non-Christian predecessors as theslaves of demons, Eusebius is in fact subtly presenting them aspartners in their own enslavement. AtLC5.3, Eusebius suggeststhat a non-Christian ruler would have‘stamped (τετυπωμένος)onhis soul (τῇαὐτοῦψυχῇ) numberless falsely drawn icons of demons’,and thereby have‘attached himself to numberless embittered masters’(ὁμυρίους καθ’ἑαυτοῦπικροὺς δεσπόταςἐφειλκυσμένος). Here, theparticiples used—τετυπωμένοςfromτυπόω,‘to stamp, form, orengrave’, andἐφειλκυσμένοςfromἕλκω,‘to draw or drag’—are bothgiven in the middle voice.126Since the middle voice generally carriedthe sense of a reflexive action—that is, of an action performed on orfor oneself—the use of this voice here gives greater agency in thisprocess to the unnamed rulers than the use of the plain activeparticiple would have done. The implication is that these rulerswere actively involved in bringing about their own enslavement todemons—they have effectively handed themselves over to thedemons. In the case ofἐφειλκυσμένος, this is further reinforced bythe use of the reflexive pronounἑαυτοῦ(himself).Similarly, when describing Constantine’s predecessors in theVC,Eusebius claims that‘by means of the mix-up of the evils oflawless idolatry, theyfirst enslaved themselves and afterwards all oftheir subjects to the errors of wicked demons’(καὶοἱμὲν συγχύσεικακῶνεἰδωλολατρείαςἐκθέσμου σφᾶςαὐτοὺς πρότερον κἄπειτα τοὺςὑπηκόουςἅπαντας πονηρῶν δαιμόνων πλάναις κατεδουλοῦντο...).127Once again, the verb—κατεδουλοῦντο—is given in the middle voice,providing the same sense of an action performed to or upon oneself.These emperors are thus also shown as participating in their ownenslavement; they are not passive victims of the demons. It wouldseem, therefore, that even those humans who were enslaved todemons must bear some of the responsibility for their situation, and126Lunn-Rockliffe has highlighted the need to pay greater attention to grammat-ical agency in early Christian discussions of agency and sin, particularly in relation tothe devil’s fall:‘Diabolical Problem’.127VC1.13.3.Demonic Influence and Human Responsibility123OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"thus for their subsequent actions, since their enslavement was notinvoluntary or imposed on them from outside. Rather, Eusebiusstresses that they made an initial choice to put themselves into thepower of demons. Whether or not their freedom to act, and even theirrationality, was compromised thereafter, their initial choice ofwickedness had met the conditions of responsibleπροαίρεσις.Thus, even in cases where Eusebius presents his human wrong-doers as having fallen entirely under the influence of demons, he isnot removing their responsibility, but presenting almost a partnershipof wickedness, in which the human as much as the demonic agentshave chosen to participate. Whether or not Eusebius would haveagreed that such people deserved pity, he certainly felt that theyalso merited punishment, since, in his opinion, responsibilityoccurred at the moment of the initialπροαίρεσιςof wickedness. Inthis way, Eusebius was able to maintain the justice of divine punish-ments directed even against those he held to be under the influence ofdemons.ESCAPING DEMONIC INFLUENCEFor Eusebius, the fact that human moral responsibility was main-tained, even among those acting under the influence of demons, waskey to the nature of the demonic threat. Rather than simply causingharm in the present life, demons were also able to lead people to act ina way that, because of humanπροαίρεσις, would jeopardize theirsalvation in the next life. As a result, from Eusebius’perspective, itwould have been crucial for people to secure themselves against thisdemonic threat. As scholars have recognized, many early Christiansbelieved that their faith provided them with protection from theattacks of hostile demons.128Indeed, this belief is said to have formedpart of the new faith’s appeal.129To an extent, Eusebius clearly shared this view. There is no doubtthat he held the power of the Christian God to be much greater thanthat of the demons.130In theCHit is said that invoking the name of128Ferguson,Demonology, 129; Martin,Inventing Superstition, 238.129Ferguson,Demonology, 129.130See, for example:PE5.17.13.124The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Christ could be used to drive out and destroy demons in cases ofdemonic possession.131However, when it came to the more insidiousand ultimately more harmful demonic challenge to human salvation,Eusebius’works suggest that simple, passive acceptance of the Chris-tian faith was not, on its own, enough to ensure a person’s safety.While Eusebius was adamant that God would support and protect hisfollowers, he also implied that people must somehow earn this pro-tection. For Eusebius, ensuring security from demonic influencerequired active engagement on the part of humankind, largelythrough the cultivation of virtue.There remains, of course, a strong sense in Eusebius’works that Godcould, and frequently would, intervene in earthly affairs in order toprotect his followers from harm. After all, as several scholarshave already observed, the active involvement of God in the affairs ofhumankind was of considerable importance to Eusebius’understand-ing of history.132While this involvement is often seen in Eusebius’works in the form of divine punishment of human wrongdoers,133attimes Eusebius also shows God acting in advance to protect the churchand promote Christianity. In theHE, Eusebius suggests that theemperor Aurelian, on the point of initiating a persecution of theChristians, was prevented from doing so by‘godly justice’(θείαδίκη).134Hence, it seems, Christians could expect their God to offerthem some protection from their enemies.Nevertheless, Eusebius makes it clear that this protection wasconditional and could be removed at any point.135In particular, itseems that it was only by maintaining high standards of virtue thatpeople could hope to secure God’s protection. Describing the soul’sfall into wickedness and sin as part of his speech on the Church atTyre, Eusebius notes how, once the soul had embraced passion andwickedness,‘God withdrew from it such that it was deprived of aguardian’.136At this point, deprived of the support of God, the soul issaid to have fallen easily and completely under the influence ofdemons.137By abandoning virtue, the soul had also lost God’s pro-tection. This sense that divine protection was conditional upon the131CH4.2.132For example: Lyman,Christology and Cosmology, 83; Hollerich,Eusebius’Commentary on Isaiah, 67; Wallace-Hadrill,Eusebius of Caesarea, 168–89.133For example:Mart.

For a while,Eusebius suggests that the church was able to grow and prosper, since‘no envy held it back, nor did some wicked demon malign it or hinderit with the plots of men, as long as a divine and heavenly handprotected and watched over its own people, as a thing that was indeedworthy’.138However, when the standards of piety within the churchbegan to slip and Christians turned to‘weakness and indolence’,139Eusebius declares that God removed his protection and permitted thedemonic and human enemies of the church to begin the persecu-tions.140For Eusebius, then, we can see that, both at the level of theindividual soul and on a broader scale for the entire church commu-nity, divine protection was available only where it was merited.Simply to be a member of the Christian church was not enough,unless one also abandoned such vices as passion, laziness, andcomplacency.It was therefore not sufficient, in Eusebius’opinion, simply to relyon the protection of God in order to secure oneself against thedemonic threat. In order both to earn this protection in the presentlife, and, just as importantly, to ensure one’s salvation in the next life,a person needed to play an active role in resisting demonic attacks.For Eusebius, these attacks took two main forms, each focusing on adifferent way of straying from the path of salvation. In theDE,Eusebius identifies two principal ways in which a person might puttheir salvation at risk: either by embracing false doctrine, be it heresyor polytheism, or by adopting a vicious lifestyle. Eusebius interpretsthe prophecy concerning the division of the Mount of Olives atZacharias 14:4, in which it was warned that the mountain wouldsplit in four directions, as representing‘the cracks and heresies andethical falling away in life which have happened and are still happen-ing now within the church of Christ’.141Two of these divisions,Eusebius suggests, represent‘two types of behaviour in turn amongthose who fall off from the church—one which is mistaken in ethicsand another which drops off from healthy and correct knowledge’.142Later on, Eusebius reiterates this division of wickedness into twoidentifiable kinds, when he describes‘two groups of unseen enemiesand wicked demonic foes, waging war in various ways against the138HE8.1.6.139HE8.1.7.140HE8.1.7–9.141DE6.18.28.142DE6.18.31.126The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"whole race of men, one of them always and in every place encour-aging among men idolatry and false teachings in our doctrines, whilethe other is working towards the destruction of souls in theirethics’.143In order to obtain salvation people would therefore needto combat demonic attacks on two fronts, by avoiding both moral anddoctrinal error. While embracing the‘orthodox’Christian faith wouldsurely have been enough in Eusebius’view to avoid the latter fault, theequally important question of how virtue was to be achieved in theface of demonic encouragement of vice was considerably moredifficult.For Eusebius, it appears that the key to escaping demonic influencewas the condition of a person’s soul. As we saw in the section‘Responsibility andπροαίρεσις’, Eusebius believed demons to directtheir attacks primarily against the rational human soul and he alsosuggested that it was the quality of a person’s soul that determined thekind of spiritual being that might be able to gain access to it. Accord-ing to Eusebius,‘it is not possible for them [the demons] to draw nearto a pure soul on account of the dissimilarity between them’.144Bycontrast, a soul which has been‘cleansed of every mark and alldefilement, and ordered both by moderation and justice and byother virtues’,145would be ready to receive a‘godly spirit’.146As aresult, the best defence against the temptations and deceits of thedemons was a pure soul.In outlining how a person might set about achieving purity of soul,Eusebius’dichotomy between the body and the soul is once again verymuch in evidence. Eusebius argues that, while the body‘rejoicesaccording to nature in all pleasures’,theπροαίρεσις,‘out of a desirefor virtue, is glad of a life of hard work and roughness’.147Bodily natureis thus shown as incompatible with the attainment of virtue, whichbelongs to theπροαίρεσιςof the soul. In order to achieve virtue then,the soul must overcome‘thenatureofthebody’, with its desires for sex,food, and drink.148Once again, this is a matter ofπροαίρεσις—a personmust independently (αὐθεκουσίως) choose to heed‘ascetic exhort-ations’towards‘abstinence from food’and‘steadfastness’, ignoringthe needs and temptations of the body.149For Eusebius, then, attainingvirtue was the concern ofπροαίρεσις, and, as such, a matter of personal143DE7.1.103.144PE4.21.4.

A virtuous lifestyle began with controlling the body, andevidently necessitated self-discipline and moderation.Resisting the temptations of the body was, however, only one of thechallenges facing those who wished to achieve virtue; there was also theproblem of malign external influencewithwhichtocontend.Aswehave seen, Eusebius felt this too could tempt people away from a life ofvirtue.150In order to combat this, Eusebius advocates practising‘phil-osophy’(φιλοσοφεῖν).151Eusebius does not immediately offer anyexplanation here of what such a practice might involve; however, bytaking account of a range of statements from elsewhere in thePE,wecan see that Eusebius regarded the practice of philosophy as a combin-ation of pious contemplation of the divine with ascetic self-discipline.Later in thePE, Eusebius notes that some rational souls—those of thedemons—succumbed to‘the opposite of the good’because of their‘neglect’(ὀλιγωρίᾳ) of their‘study of the greatest one’.152Since Eusebiushadearliergroupedtogether‘philosophy’(φιλοσοφία)and‘piety’(εὐσέβεια) as two of the valuable pursuits which would have no placein a universe governed by fate,153we may conclude that he consideredphilosophy to include in large measure the contemplation of the divine.It would, however, be wrong to suggest that Eusebius consideredphilosophy to be simply an intellectual pursuit. Towards the end ofPE6.6, Eusebius notes that Christian converts value a philosophy thatis not comprised of doctrines (λόγοις), but of actions (ἔργων).154When taken together with his statements earlier in the same chapterabout the need for people to heed‘ascetic exhortations’in order toresist bodily temptation,155this statement suggests that, for Eusebius,passive acknowledgement of the supremacy of the Christian God wasnot, on its own, enough to provide effective protection from maligninfluence. Rather, a combination of active contemplation of the divinewith self-discipline and personal moderation was required.This sense that an active and engaged form of piety was particularlyto be valued can be seen in Eusebius’presentation of Constantine.Eusebius’pious emperor prays regularly,156consults theologicaladvisers,157and takes a lively interest in matters of theological sig-nificance.158By contrast, Eusebius has a low opinion of those recent150PE6.6.42.151PE6.6.43.152PE13.15.10.153PE6.6.5.154PE6.6.71.155PE6.6.35.156VC4.22.1.157VC3.1.5.158For example:VC2.63.1, 4.29.1–5, 4.41.2–4.128The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"converts at Constantine’s court who appear to him to be less sincerein their faith.159Moreover, we know from theDEthat Eusebiusconsidered the ascetic lifestyle to be of considerable merit. AtDE1.8, Eusebius describes how Christians have been instructed in twodistinct forms of piety—a more advanced form, in which all worldlyties are renounced, and a slightly lower form, in which involvement inworldly pursuits such as marriage and politics is permitted, as long assome time is still set aside for the study of the divine.160For Eusebius,it seems that the maintenance of virtue was an active process, requir-ing, at the very least, considered engagement with Christian teachingand, as far as possible on top of this, the self-moderation of an asceticlifestyle.For Eusebius, then, resisting the attacks of demons was an ongoingtask, calling for constant vigilance. Indeed, he even warns his readersthat‘it is necessary throughout everything to be watchful against thefraudulent wicked arts’of demons and the devil.161In combating thisthreat, Eusebius evidently felt that the cultivation of virtue had a largepart to play. For this, however, people largely had to take responsi-bility themselves. They could not rest complacent in the assumptionof God’s protection. Moreover, it is notable that Eusebius’under-standing of how virtue might be attained appears to involve morethan one rather circular process. For Eusebius, virtue and purity ofsoul are the best defence against demons. Yet, in order to build thisdefence, it isfirst necessary to resist the attacks of demons by livingvirtuously. Similarly, God can offer protection from demons, but willdo so only for those who have already successfully resisted demonicattempts to draw them into wickedness. As a result, it seems asthough virtue for Eusebius must be almost a self-sustaining state.The same would appear to be true of vice: the fallen soul ofHE10.4.57–8 loses the protection of God because it has chosen wicked-ness over virtue. This then leaves it fully under the influence of thedemons, thereby encouraging further wickedness.This sense that virtue and vice could be self-perpetuating mightappear to suggest that Eusebius held the view that a person’s moraldisposition was essentiallyfixed and unchanging.162Such a positionwould also reflect a view common to many schools of ancient159VC4.54.2.160DE1.8.1–4.161PE7.10.15.162This is certainly how Drake reads Eusebius’presentation of character in theVC:Drake,‘What Eusebius Knew’, 34.Demonic Influence and Human Responsibility129OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"philosophy, in which a state, at least of true virtue, once achievedcould not then be lost.163However, the events of Eusebius’lifetimewould surely have made a static view of moral character difficult tomaintain. The persecutions alone would have provided numerousexamples of people renouncing their faith, thereby, in Eusebius’view, moving from a virtuous state to one of wickedness and jeop-ardizing their salvation in the process.164Sure enough, the overallimpression created by a range of examples in Eusebius’historical andbiographical works contradicts the notion that the human charactermust remain permanently set in either virtue or vice. In theHEinparticular, wefind examples of people turning, not merely from viceto virtue, which non-Christian philosophy had been prepared toaccept,165but crucially also from virtue to vice.166In bringing aboutthese transformations, Eusebius implies that external influence, eitherdivine or demonic, was heavily involved. Despite his ideas about howvirtue might be maintained, it therefore seems that Eusebius did notin fact believe virtue to be a secure or a permanent state.As Christopher Gill has shown, the idea that ancient writers had anentirely static view of character is misleading, and stems from amisunderstanding of the nature of ancient biography.167Gill suggeststhat, while many ancient biographies are largely silent on the processby which a personality might develop, the notion that character wasconstantly being formed, even throughout adulthood, was in factcentral to their purpose.168For Plutarch, for instance, one reason towrite biography was to provide examples, either to emulate or toavoid, in order that the reader might improve their own character.169Rather than reflecting the view that character wasfixed, Gill suggeststhat the failure of ancient biographers to engage with questions ofcharacter development was a result instead of the desire of thesewriters to present their audience with fully formed exemplars on163Frede,A Free Will, 29.164See, for example:HE8.2.3. Here, although he refuses to dwell on them,Eusebius does make passing reference to those who had‘completely shipwreckedtheir salvation’in the persecutions, showing that he was fully aware of this difficulty.165C. Gill,‘The Question of Character-Development: Plutarch and Tacitus’,CQ33(1983), 470, 478–82.166For example: vice to virtue:HE8.17.1–2, describing Galerius’decision to endthe persecution; virtue to vice:HE10.8.1–19, describing Licinius.167Gill,‘Character-Development’, 469–87.168Gill,‘Character-Development’, 476.169Plutarch,Life of Aemilius, 1, cited in Gill,‘Character-Development’, 472.130The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"which moral judgements might then be passed.170Moreover, as Gillpoints out, the idea that people in the ancient world had little ideathat character might be subject to change is at odds with the concernsof much philosophical writing, in which considerable attention ispaid to questions of moral and ethical improvement.171Ancientwriters were thus quite comfortable with the idea that a charactermight develop from a state of vice to one of virtue.However, the notion that a person who had truly achieved virtuemight have been capable of falling back into vice was undoubtedlyconsiderably more problematic for ancient thinkers. Many schools ofphilosophy maintained that a virtuous person could only act virtu-ously.172Hence once a person had achieved virtue, it was no longerpossible for them to return to a state of wickedness or ignorance. As aresult, Gill acknowledges that some—although by no means all—ancient biographers, most notably Plutarch, were troubled by examplesof‘degeneration of character in adult life’, because this conflicted withtheir understanding of what it meant to be good, rather than becausethey considered character to be permanentlyfixed.173Of course, by far the fullest portrait of a character provided byEusebius is that of Constantine in theVC. In this case, it is true thatEusebius presents a largely static picture—Constantine is shown asconsistently virtuous throughout his life. However, as has been widelyrecognized, Eusebius was not seeking to provide an accurate repre-sentation of what he saw as Constantine’s personality in theVC, butrather to produce a paradigm of a virtuous Christian ruler.174There170Gill,‘Character-Development’, 472–3.171Gill,‘Character-Development’, 469.

A focus on theVCis therefore hardlyconducive to drawing a balanced picture of Eusebius’views on char-acter and we must look further than the example of Constantine inorder properly to appreciate Eusebius’understanding of character.Moving beyond theVC, it becomes clear that Eusebius did acknow-ledge the possibility of a character changing from a state of virtue toone of vice.The career of Licinius, outlined in theHEandVC, provides Eusebius’most striking example of a character perceived to have turned fromvirtue to wickedness. Here we see afigure, initially lauded by Eusebius inbook 9 of theHEas the virtuous partner of Constantine andpious champion of God,175transformed into a demon-worshippingpersecutor.176Of course, Licinius’complex portrayal in theHEowesmuch to the changing circumstances in which this work was written—Licinius’defeat by Constantine made it politically inexpedient forpositive references to Licinius to remain unaltered.177Similar politicalconcerns also clearly influenced the negative presentation of Licinius intheVC.178Yet what is interesting about Eusebius’presentation ofLicinius in theHEandVCisnotthatitisdistorted—just as the portrayalof Constantine is distorted in the opposite direction—but that Eusebiusfinds a way to make an extreme, negative change of character credible.This owes much to the prominence of demons in Eusebius’cosmology.In both theHEandVC, Licinius’turn towards wickedness is charac-terized above all as a descent into madness and irrationality,179therebyassociating him with demons, who are also frequently characterized inthis way. Moreover, in theVC, Eusebius presents the conflict betweenConstantine and Licinius almost as a conflict between their rivaldeities—with Constantine’s Christian God triumphing over Licinius’175HE9.10.1–3; 9.11.8.176HE10.8.2–19.177On the composition of this work, see Chapter 1, section‘Questions of Datingand Composition’, subsection‘Historia Ecclesiastica’.178Indeed, Stuart Hall has demonstrated that elements of the presentation of Liciniusin theVCwere recycled by Eusebius from his earlier descriptions of Maximinus in theHE:S.G.Hall,‘The Use of Earlier Eusebian Material in theVita Constantini,1.57–59’,Studia Patristica24 (1993), 98.

Such a theme was notunknown to ancient biography and can be found in both Suetonius’and Tacitus’treatment of Tiberius.181Eusebius does in fact suggest thatLicinius was capable of deception in his dealings with Constantine, inan attempt to disguise his true intentions.182However, the idea ofpreviously hidden wickedness does notfit with Eusebius’earlier sug-gestion that God had supported Licinius to his military victories.183Eusebius might have been prepared to suggest that a person couldconceal his or her vicious character from other people, but surely notfrom God. Indeed, according to Eusebius it was God who had revealedLicinius’deception to Constantine.184Moreover, when describing Li-cinius’transformation, Eusebius states that he‘left off the imitation ofthe good and pursued instead the depravity and wicked ways of theimpious tyrants’.185This not only indicates a definite change, but alsosuggests that this change occurred as a result of swapping the influenceof virtuous externalπροαίρεσειςfor wicked external influence, in amanner consistent with that outlined by Eusebius atPE6.6.42. Thissense that Licinius underwent a definite change of character is echoedatVC2.1.1, where Eusebius describes how Licinius‘threw himselfdown (κατεκρημνίζετο) to the depth of those whofight against God’.This phrase, with its idea of movement, similarly suggests an unmis-takable change. In the case of Licinius, Eusebius therefore presents anexample of a character changing from virtue to vice, largely as a resultof a change in the external forces influencing it.Thus it seems that, for Eusebius, even the most dramatic change ofcharacter could be explained. Crucially, it appears that by allowing arole for external influence, particularly demonic influence, in shapingpeople’s choices, Eusebius was able to provide an explanation for a180VC2.4.1–2.10.2.

Williams has also previously noted:Authorised Livesin Early Christian Biography: Between Eusebius and Augustine(Cambridge: Cam-bridge University Press, 2008), 39.181Gill,‘Character-Development’, 482, citing Suetonius,Tiberius, 42.1, 57.1, 61.1,and Tacitus,Annales, 1.4.3, 5.3, 6.51.3.182HE10.8.5.183HE9.10.3.184HE10.8.5–6.185HE10.8.2.Demonic Influence and Human Responsibility133OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"phenomenon that classical philosophers had struggled to understand—the transformation of a previously good character into a state ofwickedness. While this was something of a departure from classicalviews of virtue, Eusebius was not alone among early Christian writersin suggesting that goodness was not a permanent state, at least forhumans. Tatian had insisted that only God was unchangeably good,while the humans, angels, and demons he had created, possessing achangeable nature, were left free to choose between good and evil.186Origen had similarly insisted that people were not permanently set bynature in a state of either goodness or wickedness.187Thus, for Origen,as for Eusebius, even a soul which had reached the peak of virtue wasstill at risk of falling back into wickedness.188The implications of this are significant. For Eusebius, no one, eventhe most virtuous, could ever secure complete immunity from theattacks of the demons. At no point was salvation guaranteed. How-ever, while this might seem a rather pessimistic view, other examplesin Eusebius’works present a more optimistic picture. While themalign external influence of the demons provided a constant chal-lenge to the virtuous, Eusebius also suggests that the beneficentinfluence of God might guide people towards virtue. As a result, aperson need not be trapped, even in a state of the deepest sin, forever.This emerges most clearly from Eusebius’presentation of the deathsof some of the persecuting emperors in theHE. In Eusebius’morehistorical works, particularly theHE,thereisastrongconnectiondrawn between a person’s end and the standard of their behaviour.189Constantine’s father Constantius, an emperor who, in Eusebius’reports, favoured the Christians, is the only member of the imperialcollege permitted a peaceful and pain-free death in theHE.190Thedeaths of his imperial colleagues who are said to have persecutedChristians are, by contrast, preceded by extreme physical suffering.191Yet in dwelling on the obvious, graphic punishments of the186Frede,A Free Will, 120, citing Tatian,Orat.7.1.187Origen,Comm. in Matt.10.11.57–62.

A similar concern famously informs Lactantius’Demortibus persecutorum, written mostly likely in 314–15 and therefore roughly con-temporary with theHE. See Lact.DMP30, 33–5, 49. On the dating of this work, see:J. L. Creed,‘Introduction’, in Lactantius,De mortibus persecutorum, ed. and trans.J. L.

Both Galerius and Maximinus are said to have issued edicts infavour of Christians shortly before their deaths. In both cases, thisfinalchange of heart is reported to have resulted in an immediate reward.Maximinus, we are told,‘suffered less than he should have suffered’,inspite of the considerable physical pain he is supposed to haveendured.192Meanwhile Galerius, whose divinely sent punishment issaid to have encouraged his change of heart, was‘at once, although notfor long, delivered from his sufferings’.193His reward was to be relievedof his pain, albeit through death. For these twofigures, it appears that asingle, virtuousπροαίρεσιςhas been rewarded, although it is notenough to cancel out completely the punishment for their many, earlierwickedπροαίρεσεις. Each and every choice, whether good or bad,mattered. Each would be recognized and duly rewarded or punishedby God. By changing theirπροαίρεσεις, a person might thus freethemselves from sin.Eusebius’belief in the value of every choice for determininga person’s path is further reflected in his attitude towards thoseChristians he would have considered to have‘lapsed’from the faith.In the light of his insistence on the punishment of wrongdoers, itmight appear surprising that Eusebius is tolerant of Christians whohad recanted their faith during the persecutions, but who had laterrepented. Discussing the Novatianist schism of the third century, inwhich the followers of Novatus had refused to admit such Christiansback into the congregation, Eusebius is highly critical, calling thisstance‘brother-hating and very anti-human’.194Instead he applaudsthose‘orthodox’bishops who excommunicated Novatus and declaredthat any lapsed Christians who repented should be welcomed backinto the church. Eusebius was not, of course, condoning their sins, buthe insisted that these people should be‘healed and treated by themedicines of repentance’.195For Eusebius, then, repentance couldhave healing properties, helping to undo the damage caused byprevious sins. Since each individual decision mattered, a personcould change at any point.Moreover, the idea that people were capable of changing for thebetter appears to have been central to Eusebius’understanding of the192HE9.10.13.193HE8.App.1.194HE6.43.2.195HE6.43.2.Demonic Influence and Human Responsibility135OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"purpose of divine punishments. For Eusebius, the punishments sentby God to the wicked were not simply retributive, but, far moreimportantly, corrective. Eusebius insists that God cannot create anykind of evil, and that even his punishments, which might appearharmful, are in fact intended‘not for the harm of those being pun-ished, but for their benefit and use’.196As a result, Eusebius likensGod’s punishments to a doctor’s treatment of his patients—he mayoffer‘painful and sharp treatments’but these are ultimately intendedto cure the patient.197This can be seen in the example of Galerius,whose divinely sent physical suffering is eventually said to have ledhim towards a more virtuous path, by causing him to end his perse-cution of the Christians.198Perhaps even more significant for Eusebius, however, was the rolethat such punishments might play in deterring future wrongdoing byothers. Eusebius suggests that the difference between the deaths ofvirtuous emperors like Constantine’s father Constantius and those ofthe persecutors demonstrates the way in which God will rewardvirtue and vice.199More than once he criticizes Licinius for failingto take heed of the many examples of the punishment of persecu-tors.200It seems that, for Eusebius, Licinius’wickedness was com-pounded by the fact that God had supplied him with many examplesto guide him towards making virtuous choices, leaving little excusefor his failure to do so. Eusebius’understanding of divine justice wasthus underpinned by his belief that people were capable of moralimprovement by changing the choices they made for the better. Forthose who chose to follow it, Eusebius believed that God wouldprovide guidance to help people achieve virtue and salvation.The boundary between virtue and vice was thus a porous one forEusebius. People did not possess afixed nature or predeterminedcharacter, but rather shaped their own path through the choices theymade. Moreover, the significance of every single choice meant that,for Eusebius, virtue and vice were never permanently set. Yet in hisunderstanding of how people might switch between these two oppos-ing states, Eusebius not only had room for human freedom of choice.While this was undoubtedly crucial in his view to maintaining humanmoral responsibility, he also assigned a prominent place to externalinfluence. If wickedness, for Eusebius, was a partnership between196PE13.3.39.197PE13.3.39.198HE8.17.1.199VC1.17.1.200HE10.8.2, 10.8.9;VC1.59.2.136The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"humans and demons, then goodness was likewise a partnershipbetween humans and the divine, whenever people welcomed God’sguidance and correction. In Eusebius’understanding of salvation wethereforefind a combination of God’s grace with human freedom andresponsibility. Salvation might be dependent on a person achievingvirtue in their own right, but Eusebius did not believe that God leftpeople without any guidance on how that virtue was to be achieved.CONCLUSIONSRecognizing the importance ofπροαίρεσιςin Eusebius’thought iscrucial to understanding his views on moral responsibility. It wasthis concept that enabled him to absolve God of responsibility for theevil of the persecutions, allowing him to place the blame squarely withhumankind instead. Moreover, rather than a cruel and mercilesspunishment, the persecutions thus become a generous and mercifulremedy, which, thanks to people’s ability to change theirπροαίρεσεις,can lead people back to salvation. Similarly, the notion ofπροαίρεσιςhelped to explain the dramatic and troubling change of character seenin thefigure of Licinius. For Eusebius, humankind’s freedom toexerciseπροαίρεσιςmeant that people could slip between states ofvirtue and vice. Eusebius has previously been characterized as anoptimist as a result of his belief in human progress,201and, to anextent, this assessment is justified. His message that, as a result oftheir free choice, even the most depraved sinners might attainredemption is certainly a positive one. Yet the associated idea thateveryone, even the most virtuous, remains capable of falling back intosin as a result of this same free choice leaves little room for compla-cency or triumphalism.Forπροαίρεσιςwas not only the key to salvation in Eusebius’thought, it also lay at the centre of his conception of the demonicthreat. Eusebius’demonic threat did not focus primarily on physicalor earthly harm, but rather on attempts to derail the progress of thechurch and undermine human salvation. For Eusebius, it wasπροαίρεσιςthat made this aspect of the demonic threat possible. By allowing201Lyman,Christology and Cosmology, 123; Chesnut,First Christian Histories,119.Demonic Influence and Human Responsibility137OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"humans to be held responsible for their sins, even those committed asa result of external temptation or under malign influence, humanπροαίρεσιςgave demons the opportunity to lead people to jeopardizetheir own salvation. Clearly Eusebius saw salvation as the result of co-operation between divine grace and human free choice;202yet to focusonly on this positive aspect of Eusebius’understanding of moralresponsibility risks distorting his views. Eusebius believed his audi-ence to live in a world populated by a variety of spiritual forces, manyof which he saw as malevolent in intent. The risk of slipping into sinas a result of malign external influence was thus one that could not beignored.This understanding of the relationship betweenπροαίρεσιςand thedemonic threat also helped to shape Eusebius’ideas about Christianidentity, and about the standards of behaviour required of those whowished to be identified as virtuous Christians. Given the importancewhich Eusebius attached to correct belief in securing salvation, mem-bership of the‘orthodox’church would have been thefirst of theserequirements. However, whilst it is clear that, for Eusebius, salvationcould not be secured outside the body of the church, passive andunthinking adherence, even to orthodox doctrine, was not by itselfenough either to indicate or to ensure a person’s virtue. In Eusebius’view, the pursuit of virtue and hence of freedom from demonicinfluence was a struggle that must be undertaken at the level of theindividual soul. In this, people would receive help, both from theirGod-given inclination towards goodness, and from the guidancewhich God supplied in the visible world through the administrationof divine justice. They would also, however, face the challenge ofdemonic temptation. Membership of the church had to be supple-mented by the cultivation of a pious and virtuous lifestyle in order toensure that people did not fall into the power of demons. Thus,Christian identity for Eusebius was tied not merely to membershipof the church community, but to the continual struggle against thedemons, in which each individual soul had an important role to play.202As Lyman argued:Christology and Cosmology, 99.138The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"5Demonic Activity and Historical ProgressEusebius’great value to later historians arguably lies, to a significantdegree, in his position as a witness to the dramatic religious andpolitical changes of the early fourth century. Eusebius lived throughperiods of uneasy toleration for the Christian church, of direct per-secution, and,finally, of official recognition and imperial patronage,and he records many of these changes in his works. Yet Eusebius’presentation of these events is rarely straightforward. While theaccusations of outright fraud levelled against Eusebius by earlierscholars like Jacob Burckhardt are somewhat unfair in seeking tojudge Eusebius by the standards of later historiography,1there canbe no doubt that, as many scholars have noted, Eusebius’attitudetowards the developments of the period—particularly the politicaldevelopments—was heavily shaped by his perception of how theseeventsfitted into the broad sweep of history as a whole.2Eusebius’ideas about history also influenced his reading of the role of thechurch and its leaders and were closely linked to his understandingof how salvation might be achieved. Consequently, an understandingof Eusebius’views on the nature, purpose, and overall direction ofhistory is essential to an accurate appreciation of his presentationof the events and leadingfigures of the Constantinian era.Nonetheless, despite long-standing interest in Eusebius’ideasabout history,3there remain several substantial problems with theexisting interpretations of his views on the subject. First and most1Burckhardt,The Age of Constantine, 283.2See, for example: Hollerich,Eusebius’Commentary on Isaiah, 67; Lyman,Christ-ology and Cosmology, 88; Wallace-Hadrill,Eusebius of Caesarea, 168–89; Ruhbach,‘Politische Theologie’, 236–58, 242.3Important monographs include: Chesnut,First Christian Histories; Sirinelli,Lesvues historiques; Grant,Eusebius as Church Historian.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"serious is the fact that scholars, almost without exception, presentEusebius as a triumphant optimist, so dazzled by the prosperity ofthe church in his later life that he was led to unrestrained celebrationof contemporary political and religious circumstances.4There istherefore a tendency to suggest that Eusebius saw the events of hislifetime as falling at the very end of history, and representing bothits climax and pinnacle.5However, this optimistic picture of Eusebius’thought is somewhat undermined by the repeated appearance ofhostile and threatening demons throughout a range of his works.Demonic activity continues to feature even in some of Eusebius’latestand arguably most triumphalist works, such as theVita Constantini(VC) and later books of theHistoria ecclesiastica(HE),6yet scholarsarguing for Eusebius’triumphalism have so far failed to engage withsuch references to the demonic threat. When demons are restored totheir proper place in Eusebius’historical vision it becomes clear thatthis traditional portrayal of Eusebius as straightforwardly optimisticcannot be so easily maintained. As a result, our understanding of howhe interprets the events of his own day also requires some refining.Stemming from thisfirst problem, there is a second, related diffi-culty, which is that some scholars have tended to try to distinguishbetween Eusebius’view of the‘Church’and that of the‘Empire’.7Yet,as Drake has argued, drawing such a clear division between the two inthis period is‘dangerously and profoundly misleading’.8Havingmade this distinction, scholars have disagreed about which of thesebodies Eusebius supposedly held to be more important. Believing thatEusebius saw his own time as falling at the very end of history, several4See, for example: W. H. C.

Daley’s survey of eschato-logical thought in thefirstfive centuriesCEhighlights such a variety ofviews that it is difficult to see how one can reasonably speak of a‘conventional’doctrine.12Moreover, Daley suggests that one of thefew overarching features of early Christian eschatology was its‘real-ism’, the sense of an intimate connection between this world and thepromised kingdom.13This must lead us to question just how muchmore‘realized’Eusebius’eschatology was than that of other earlyChristian thinkers. Indeed, scholars seem to vary in their assessmentof what was involved in Eusebius’‘realized’eschatology. While theolder view suggests that Eusebius’eschatology involved largely down-playing ideas of a second coming andfinal judgement,14some morerecent scholarship has found a continuing belief in such events tobe completely compatible with a‘realized eschatology’.15A contrast9The expression is used to describe Eusebius’thought by: Hollerich,Eusebius’Commentary on Isaiah, 196–7, 201; by B.

It is not, however, exclusively used ofEusebius. Daley also uses the expression to refer to elements of the thought of Cyprianand desert fathers including Antony:The Hope, 43, 71.10Daley,The Hope, 78. This view of Eusebius’eschatology is widespread, even wherethe precise expression‘realized eschatology’is not used. See, for example: H. G.

The older view, put forward by scholars such asEger, is that by the end of his life Eusebius had come to see God’sprophetic promises as being fulfilled in the newly Christian empireunder Constantine.16Such an interpretation clearly owes far more toEusebius’later panegyrical works on Constantine, theVCandDelaudibus Constantini(LC), than to some of his earlier apologetic andexegetical works.17More recently, however, this view has been chal-lenged by scholars such as Hollerich and Johnson who have stressedby contrast the continuing significance of the church in Eusebius’works.18As a result, Hollerich suggested that it is the church, ratherthan the empire, that should be seen as the locus of Eusebius’‘realizedeschatology’.19However, while this work has been invaluable in challenging tradi-tional assumptions about Eusebius’attitude towards the empire,it not only continues to perpetuate the idea that Eusebius’interestlay principally in either the church or the empire as separate andclearly identifiable bodies, but also suggests that the two must in someway have been in competition for him.

This leaves us free to explore instead howEusebius viewed the events of his lifetime within the broad sweep ofhistory as a whole. When we do this, we can see that Eusebius was lessinterested in either the church or the empire as impersonal‘institu-tions’, than in their leaders as a united group of virtuous Christianexemplars, guiding their followers on their individual journeys awayfrom demons and towards God.The purpose of this chapter is therefore twofold. Firstly, by draw-ing attention to the continuing role of hostile demons in Eusebius’understanding of history, it will challenge traditional assumptionsabout Eusebius’triumphal interpretation of the events of his life-time. Secondly, it will propose an alternative approach to Eusebius’understanding of these events, suggesting that he presents them, notas standing at the culmination of history, but rather as formingsimply one stage in an ongoing process of salvation within history.Moreover, it will show that, since history had not yet reached itsclimax for Eusebius, any celebration of present prosperity was tem-pered in his works by warnings against complacency.THE ROLE OF DEMONS IN HISTORYFor Eusebius, demonic activity was an inescapable feature of history,observable not only in the distant past, but also in more recent events,up to and including the events of his own lifetime. Although severalscholars have already noted that, for Eusebius, history was not drivenexclusively by human activity,21they have tended to focus on the roleof the divine in directing events and have overlooked the importantrole also played by lesser spiritual beings, such as demons and angels,in Eusebius’historical scheme.22Even where scholars in the past have21For example: Chesnut,First Christian Histories,86–7; Lyman,Christology andCosmology, 83; Hollerich,Eusebius’Commentary on Isaiah, 67; Wallace-Hadrill,Eusebius of Caesarea, 168–89; Coggan,‘Pandaemonia’, 62.22For instance, J.

Thus, even if demons are seen tohave had a role in Eusebius’understanding of some historical periods,their activity is held to be safely confined to the distant past. Thisonly contributes further to the sense that Eusebius’attitude was oneof gloating triumphalism, since it suggests that he believed a once-potent threat to have been effectively neutralized.24This picture,however, is based on only a partial reading of Eusebius’works andcannot be sustained when comments from some of his other works,like theVCand later books of theHE, which deal with events from hisown lifetime, are also taken into consideration. What we see when welook at Eusebius’works as a whole is that, in his view, the struggle ofpious humans to escape from demonic influence was an ongoingfeature of all historical time, including his own time. It was, moreover,crucial to his understanding of salvation.Early human history for Eusebius was the story of a rapid declineinto ignorance and barbarism, followed by a slow and difficult pro-gress back towards God.25These changes in the human conditionwere linked, moreover, to the waxing and waning of demonic influ-ence among humankind, as demonic tyranny was gradually replacedby the beneficial instruction of the Logos.26In part, of course, humanfree choice was also responsible for the initial fall of humankind awayCosmology, 99, 102. Lyman uses the term‘free will’without specifying to which Greekterm she is referring, but it seems clear that she has in mind the kind of unconstrainedchoice which Eusebius saw as central to moral responsibility.

In the period immediately afterthe fall, human beings are still not said to have sunk to their lowestpoint. Instead, we are told that God, in his benevolence,‘establishedheavenly angels as their guardians and curators, like leaders of a herdand shepherds’.30Since they were unable to recognize the true God,these angels encouraged the humans under their protection to wor-ship the stars, sun, and moon instead, as the best alternative.31Thathumans then sank still lower, into a state of complete wildness andirrationality, was, for Eusebius, the result of demonic and diabolicalplotting. The devil and his demons, envious of God’s care for human-kind, succeeded in overthrowing the governance of the angels, asthe devil,dragging down the cities from better places, and the souls of many toevery kind of wickedness with the enticements of pleasure, and omittingno manner of contrivance, with shameful stories of the gods andlicentious narratives, put before his captives pleasing things and pleas-ure, through the cunning deceit of the demons.32This suggestion that demons used‘shameful stories of the gods’todraw people away from the true, Christian God would appear tobe a reference to the argument, common among early Christianapologists and fully endorsed by Eusebius,33that demons laybehind and inspired pagan worship. It also recalls Eusebius’earlierdismissal of the‘widespread and more legendary’theology of theGreeks in thePE.34Here Eusebius criticizes the mythologicalstories of the traditional gods andheroes for associating the divinewith actions that would be considered criminal if conducted by27PE7.18.7.28PE7.18.8.

In this process,however, humankind was not alone. Their relentless fall was, inEusebius’view, arrested only by the benevolent intervention of theLogos, who‘shone some short and faint rays of his personal lightthrough the prophet Moses and through the god-beloved men whocame before him and after him’in order to help people improve theircondition.37These early seeds of virtue and understanding werespread atfirst through the Hebrew prophets,38only graduallyfilteringthrough to the other human nations.39It was only once enoughprogress had been made that the time became right for the incarna-tion.40At this point, humankind made a great leap forwards, as theLogos‘mastered with great and divine power’the demons who hadbeen largely in control until that point.41The incarnation was thusclearly an important historical turning-point for Eusebius and acrucial event in the weakening of demonic power. However, thisdoes not mean that it marked the end of the struggle with demonsfor Eusebius.It is worth emphasizing this point, because some scholars havepreviously argued that the incarnation marked a fundamental changein Eusebius’view of the demonic. According to Johnson, the incar-nation and the period immediately following it saw the complete‘destruction of demonic power’in Eusebius’view.42This argument35PE2.4.1–3.36PE2.4.4–6.

Two of these discuss theapparent ending of the practice of human sacrifice,43while onedescribes the‘death’of a demon.44AtPE4.15.6, Eusebius suggeststhat‘thefilth of polytheistic deceit’(ἡτῆς πολυθέου πλάνης λύμη),which he believed to have been encouraged by demons, was‘slack-ened and reduced at no other time than that of Hadrian, when in themanner of a light Christ’s teaching was already shining on everyplace’. However, it is important to note that what Eusebius is describ-ing here is, at most, a reduction in polytheistic worship, which was infact only one of the various methods by which he believed demonsmight try to draw people away from God.Moreover, when this claim is examined in the context of thepassage as a whole, it becomes clear that Eusebius is discussing, notthe end of all polytheistic worship but merely of what he felt to be oneof its worst features—human sacrifice. Immediately before hisremarks atPE4.15.6, Eusebius asks how anyone could imagine thatgood demons, let alone true divinity, would require the‘most profane’(ἀσεβεστάτη) and‘most unholy’(ἀνοσιωτάτη) practice of humansacrifice.45He follows this by arguing that‘some offered their sons,others their daughters, and others even themselves to the sacrifices ofthe demons’.46Eusebius’remarks about the decline of polytheisticworship therefore occur in the context of a discussion of humansacrifice and refer only to the supposed elimination of this practice.A similar statement atPE4.17.4, when considered in the contextof the surrounding discussion, can likewise be seen to refer only tothe ending of human sacrifice, rather than to the destruction of alldemonic influence. Thus, while these passages can legitimately betaken to indicate a weakening, or at least a change, in demonic powerin the wake of the incarnation, they do not suggest that demonicpower had ended completely.The second passage that has been taken by some scholars toindicate Eusebius’belief in the ending of demonic power is found athis time did not believe all demonic activity to have ceased with the incarnation, shenevertheless suggests that the incarnation was believed to have fundamentally changedthe way in which Christians interacted with the demonic:‘Pandaemonia’,194.43PE4.15.5–6, 4.17.4.44PE5.17.1–14.45PE4.15.5.46PE4.15.9.Demonic Activity and Historical Progress147OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"PE5.17.1–14.47Here, Eusebius cites a lengthy passage from Plutarch’sDe defectu oraculorum, in which Plutarch relates the story of thedeath of the god Pan.48Once again, however, it is essential to considerthis passage in the broader context of the work as a whole. ThePEhad a strongly apologetic purpose and sought to demonstrate to itsreaders that Christianity was superior to pagan forms of worship.49Ittherefore served Eusebius’apologetic argument well to suggest thatthe power of the pagan demon-gods was no match for the truly divinepower of the Christian God and his Logos.50By suggesting thatdemons could be subject to death, Eusebius was demonstrating thatthey were not fully divine.Moreover, Eusebius glosses Plutarch’s passage with the commentthat this death took place during the reign of Tiberius, when Christwas‘undertaking his teachings among men’.51Eusebius thus directlylinks the death of this particular demon with the effects of Christ’swork, thereby again demonstrating the greater power of Christiandivinity. There can be no doubt that Eusebius wished to suggest herethat demonic power was considerably weakened at the incarnation ofChrist and even that some demons may have died. However, in viewof the fact that this argument suited Eusebius’apologetic aims so well,we should be very cautious about suggesting that this passage on itsown can provide a full and accurate picture of the effect Eusebiusbelieved the incarnation to have had on demonic power.

AtPE4.16.22, he points to certain supposedly demon-inspired cult practicesthat he claims are still occurring‘even now’—indeed he even claimsthat these practices are similar in nature to earlier human sacrifices.52Such statements suggest that Eusebius must have viewed any weakeningof demonic power as fairly limited. Moreover, when we broaden ourperspective beyond thePEto consider Eusebius’statements in someof his works which deal more thoroughly with the post-incarnationhistory of humankind, such as theHEandVC, we encounter unmistak-able evidence that Eusebius felt demons continued to pose a signifi-cant threat well into his own lifetime. Throughout these works wefindEusebius suggesting that demons and the devil were responsible forattempts to undermine the progress of the Christian church, either byinciting persecutions or by encouraging the spread of alternative doc-trines which Eusebius considered to be heretical.53In theHE,persecu-tions of the past are regularly tied directly to the malign influence ofdemons. Here, we are told that it was the‘envious’(βασκάνῳ)and‘good-hating demon’who encouraged accusations against Christiansduring the reign of Commodus,54while slightly later Origen is said tohave received particularly brutal treatment under persecution at theinstigation of the‘wicked demon’,who‘drew up all his troops incontention with the man, and with every contrivance and powerattacked him, falling especially upon him of all those against whom hewas then making war’.55In this passage we can see the way in whichEusebius envisaged persecutions as being inspired principally by thedevil, ably supported by the demonic‘troops’he commanded.Moreover, this activity should not be seen as confined safely to thedistant past, for Eusebius also shows demons at work in the persecu-tions of his own lifetime. In his panegyric on the Church at Tyre,Eusebius attributes the recent persecutions to the activity of the‘evil-loving demon’.56Similarly, in theVC, Licinius’measures against52Compare:De solemnitate Paschali,PG24.697.20.53See, for example:HE4.7.1–2, 6.39.5, 10.4.14;VC1.49.1, 2.73.1.54HE5.21.2.55HE6.39.5.56HE10.4.14.Demonic Activity and Historical Progress149OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Christians in the eastern provinces—measures which Eusebius wouldhave personally experienced—are said to have been encouraged by a‘wicked demon’.57This demonic activity is, moreover, directly linkedto the growing prosperity of the church. The demon encouragesLicinius to persecute the church partly at least because of resentmentat the benefits being enjoyed by the church in the west underConstantine’s patronage.58Thus, not only did Eusebius believedemonic activity to be continuing, it is clear that he did not considerthe current prosperity of the church to provide any security fromdemonic attack. Indeed, it might even have had the opposite effect ofdriving the demons to redouble their efforts.This sense that the earthly success of the church could not bedepended upon is also seen in theHE, where Eusebius suggests thatthe persecutions were in fact permitted by God after the church fellinto complacency and dissension as a result of its growing success.59For Eusebius, prosperity for the church in one period did not neces-sarily mean long-term security; it was certainly no excuse to relaxone’s guard against the potential attacks of the demons. Thus, successfor the church did not mark the end of history for Eusebius; instead, itbrought with it a new set of demonically inspired challenges, whichneeded to be fought in new ways.That the demonic threat remained ever-present for Eusebius, evenafter the unification of the empire under Constantine, can further beseen from the way in which he attributes the spread of supposedlyheretical doctrines to demonic and diabolical influence. In theHE, theheresies which Eusebius discusses are mainly those of previous cen-turies: Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, is described as the leader ofa‘demonic heresy’or‘sect’, and portrayed as the instrument used bydemons and the devil to thwart human salvation.60Similar languageis also used of Menander, a follower of Simon Magus, and hisdisciples.61The repeated association which Eusebius draws betweenheretics and demonic influence in theHEmakes clear the strength ofhis belief that heresies were ultimately the work of the devil and hisdemonic associates.6257VC1.49.1.58VC1.49.2.

In theVC,wefind similar language beingapplied to the spread of heresies throughout Constantine’s reign:‘anevil demon’, we are told, lies behind the Donatist schism in Africa.63Similarly, the Council of Tyre is said to have been called in an attemptto resolve disagreements that Eusebius considered to be inspired bythe‘good-hating envy’(μισόκαλος φθόνος), which, as we saw in thesection‘Envious Demons’in Chapter 2, was characteristic of demonicactivity for Eusebius.64Even when imperial persecution had ceased,then, Eusebius continued to see demonic activity at work undermin-ing the church. In fact, Eusebius even suggests that the ending of thepersecutions, far from marking the end of demonic attacks againstthe church, might simply lead the devil and demons to adopt a newstrategy. In theHE, Eusebius remarks that, when persecutions werenot an option, the demons would turn to spreading false doctrineinstead:[P]reviously he [the‘good-hating demon’] armed himself against it [thechurch] with persecutions from outside, but, being now shut out fromthis, using wicked men and sorcerers like ruinous instruments andmessengers of destruction for souls, he waged war by other means,contriving in every way that sorcerers and cheats might insinuatethemselves into the same name as our belief, and at the same timeboth lead into the depth of destruction those of the faithful caught bythem, and turn away from the approach to the saving word thoseunaware of the faith, by the things which they did.65For Eusebius, it seems that this alternative form of attack might poseeven more of a threat than the persecutions had done, since it servedthe dual purpose both of discouraging new converts and of leadingexisting Christians away from what Eusebius felt to be a‘correct’understanding of the divine. The idea that any historical event—beit the incarnation, the ending of persecution, or Constantine’spatronageof the church—had already brought humankind to a state of completePaul, those spreading alternative doctrines had been attacked as the‘ministers’(διάκονοι) of Satan (2 Cor. 11:13–15), while in the second century, Irenaeus ofLyons in hisAdversus Haereseshad frequently associated his opponents with thedevil (for example: Iren.Adv.

This contrasts with theHEandVC, where thediscussion focuses almost entirely on events following the incarna-tion, and the role of demons in encouraging either persecution orheresy is more heavily stressed.66This suggests that Eusebius mayhave considered the nature of the demonic threat to have changedfollowing the incarnation, rather than ceasing altogether. As we sawin the section‘Escaping Demonic Influence’in Chapter 4, Eusebiusheld that there were two principal means by which demons mightdivert people from the road to salvation—either by encouraging viceor by encouraging false belief, be that polytheism or heresy.67ForEusebius, it seems that even as the influence of polytheism waned,the demons werefinding new ways to encourage false belief. Theencouragement of polytheism became the encouragement of‘heresy’.With the growing success of the church, the demons were adoptingnew tactics, rather than retreating from the battle. Eusebius’sugges-tion in thePEandDEthat the pagan cults were in decline and that thedemons of these cults were dying should therefore not be taken as anindication that he believed the demonic threat to lie safely in the past.Rather, as Eusebius saw it, the demons in his own time were simply66Sirinelli suggested, by contrast, that‘Eusebius’demonology has no other func-tion than to explain pagan error’,Les vues historiques, 317.

As a result, the emphasis of Eusebius’discussionwould certainly appear to be primarily the role of demons in encouraging polytheism.Coggan similarly felt that the defining feature of Eusebius’discussions of demons wastheir use in his anti-pagan polemic:‘Pandaemonia’, 189. As with Sirinelli, Coggan’sexclusive focus on thePEleads her to miss some of the broader applications ofEusebius’demonology which clearly appear in his other works.

This was not,however, a struggle in which human beings were merely passivepawns; rather it was a struggle for salvation in which humankindwas actively involved. Eger identified two potential driving forces inEusebius’understanding of history: one was the development of freehuman action, the other the struggle between divine and demonicpower.68These he appears to have seen as incompatible, suggestingthat Eusebius emphasizes each of these at different points in theHE.69However, as we saw in Chapter 4, humanπροαίρεσιςmeant thatpeople were in fact drawn into this greater cosmic conflict and ableto choose sides within it. It was partly by exploiting humanπροαίρεσιςthat demons maintained their struggle against God. Thus a distinc-tion between these two historical forces is unnecessary and evenmisleading.Moreover, from the human perspective, the choice of whom tofollow in this cosmic struggle would directly affect their salvation: aperson’s damnation would result from their choice to associate withdemons, while their salvation would be secured only by active co-operation with the divine.70In theDE, Eusebius notes how the Logosacted against demonic influence,‘setting loose and alteringthose whoplaced their dependence on himfrom a licentious to a moderate life,from impiety to piety, from unrighteousness to righteousness, indeedeven from the power of embittered demons to godly apprehension oftrue piety’.71While the promise of salvation offered by the Logoswas open to all, Eusebius suggests here that it remained a matter ofindividual human choice whether or not to take advantage of thatoffer. Similarly, in his discussion of fate and divine providence in thePE, Eusebius notes that providence directs everything that happens,including things that occur as a result of human action, not by68Eger,‘Kaiser und Kirche’, 102–3.69Eger,‘Kaiser und Kirche’, 102, n.34.70Lyman has noted the importance of co-operation between human and divine‘will’to Eusebius’historical scheme, and particularly to his understanding of salvation:Christology and Cosmology, 99, 102–3.

For the end of the nature of manis not thus on earth, not turning downwards into destruction andperdition, but there from where thefirst man strayed.’This suggeststhat, in his understanding of what salvation entailed, Eusebius held aview very similar to that of Origen. For Origen, salvation meant thereturn of humankind to its original state with God.75Eusebius’use of the termἀποκατάστασιςhere should not be takento imply the idea of the universal salvation of all creatures, includingdemons and the devil, such as is often associated with Origen.76Thecontext of the passage atPE7.18.9 makes it clear that Eusebius isreferring only to humankind and it therefore seems that he is usingthe term in an older, less technical sense. Even by the time of Gregoryof Nyssa, later in the fourth century, the termἀποκατάστασιςhadnot yet acquired the exclusive meaning of universal salvation, andretained a broader sense of‘restitution’or‘restoration’.77This isclearly how Eusebius is using the term here—to indicate the ideathat salvation was a journey back to an original state that had been72PE6.6.45.73As, for example, at:Theoph.1.69.74PE7.18.9–10.

In this passage, Eusebius appears to have in mind a state prior tothe fall of Adam—this, was, for Eusebius, a state of immortality,among the‘divine choruses’close to God.78Thus, for him, it seemsthat humankind was not meant to achieve fulfilment on earth, butrather to use its time there in order to strive for the greater, spiritualrewards that awaited the virtuous among the‘divine choruses’ofheaven.That this striving for virtue and hence salvation meant, for Euse-bius, constantlyfighting against the demons is evident from hisdescription of the struggles of the martyrs in theHE. Here, Eusebiusdescribes one of his aims as being to announce‘the resistance of theathletes of piety and their much-enduring courage, and the trophiestaken against demons, and the victories over the invisible enemiesand the crowns over all these things’.79For Eusebius, the victory ofthe martyrs is won over the demons—those demons, presumably,which were attacking the virtuous by means of the persecutions.However, persecution was simply one of several methods by whichEusebius thought the demons might try to derail human salvation.The martyrs might provide the most dramatic example of virtuousChristians achieving victory over the demons and thwarting theirplans, but it seems logical that, for Eusebius, other pious humans,whether by maintaining a virtuous lifestyle in the face of the tempta-tions of pleasure or by avoiding‘heretical’doctrines, were similarlyfighting off the demons to secure the salvation that victory wouldbring them.In this struggle against the demons, however, human beings were byno means alone. Instead, Eusebius repeatedly suggests that human-kind was led away from demons and towards the life of virtue thatwould earn them salvation by divine guidance and instruction. Asmany scholars have noted, the idea of the Logos-Christ as a teacherappears to lie at the core of Eusebius’soteriology, and is particularlyimportant in his understanding of the incarnation.80This is not tosuggest, of course, that Eusebius felt teaching to have been the onlypurpose of the incarnation. More than once, Eusebius shows that hewas familiar with some of the different theories of the incarnation and78PE7.18.7–8.79HE5.Praef.4.80For example: Hollerich,Eusebius’Commentary on Isaiah, 64; Wallace-Hadrill,Eusebius of Caesarea, 102; Lyman,Christology and Cosmology, 83, 122; Young,Nicaea toChalcedon,18;Johnson,Ethnicity and Argument,185;Sirinelli,Les vues historiques, 279.Demonic Activity and Historical Progress155OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"crucifixion that were widespread among early Christian writers.81These included the idea that the crucifixion represented a sacrifice tothe devil to redeem humankind from his power,82as well as the—notentirely compatible—notion that the crucifixion was necessary todemonstrate to the demons that Christ was superior to death.83Yet,while Eusebius was happy to list these various theories, his referencesto them are little more than cursory, and he shows little interest indiscriminating between them. Overall, the repeated references tothe beneficial effect of Christ’s teaching, found throughout a varietyof Eusebius’works, leave a much stronger impression, and suggestthat, in his view, this was by far the most important feature of theincarnation.84In particular, Eusebius often links the spread of divine teaching to adecline in demonic influence. In thePE, Eusebius credits Christ’spreaching with freeing people from their long-standing enslavementto demons.85Similarly, in theDE, we are told thatwhen our saviour was brought bodily into the land of the Egyptians . . .the wicked powers living there before were likely not a little moved byhis inexpressible power and agency, and especially (μάλιστα) when,through his teaching afterwards, a countless number of those living inEgypt,fleeing from the deceits of the demons, still even now agree thatthey know the one God of all.86The use ofμάλισταhere suggests that Eusebius may have seenChrist’s teaching as being even more effective in undermining demo-nic influence in Egypt than his physical presence in the territory as achild had been.For Eusebius, it seems that there were two principal aspects to thisdivine teaching. Firstly, it served to counter false belief—early in thePE, Eusebius notes that as a result of‘our saviour’s teaching’peopleof various nations have abandoned their traditional belief in multi-ple gods and have instead come to recognize only the one, Christian81See, for example:SC15.9–11;Theoph. 3.57–60, 4.9;DE4.12.6–9, 10.Praef.2–7,10.8.37;De solemnitate Paschali,PG24.696.23–7.

Euse-bius claims that, as a result of divine instruction, people no longerpractise such vices as cannibalism, incest, and human sacrifice.88Instead, those who have turned towards the Christian God havelearnt to relinquish passion and to live according to a more exact-ing standard (ἀκριβῶς).89This apparent dual focus of divine teachingcorresponds to Eusebius’belief, highlighted in the section‘EscapingDemonic Influence in Chapter 4, that demons had two main meansof diverting people from salvation—the encouragement of vice andthe instigation of false belief.90Moreover, divine instruction for Eusebius did not begin and end withthe incarnation. He also saw it in the improving influence of the Logos,which Eusebius felt had prepared humankind for the incarnation.91Crucially, however, it is clear that Eusebius also believed this teachingto have continued long after the incarnation, through the preaching ofthe apostles and those who came after them.92In theHE,welearnthatpeople were also freed from demonically inspired polytheism‘by thepower of Christ through the teaching of his disciples and their wonderfulworks’.93Thus, while the incarnation had a part to play in Eusebius’understanding of salvation, it was not, for him, a completely definitiveevent. For Eusebius, salvation and the defeat of the demons were gradualprocesses, in which the long-term instruction of humankind in virtueand piety, rather than any particular one-off event, was key.As a result, Eusebius’interpretation of the events of his later life,however much he might have welcomed these developments, cannotbe seen as quite so straightforwardly triumphalist as has often been thecase in the past. This new focus on the role of the demonic in Eusebius’view of history thus supports the challenge to the traditional reading ofEusebius’attitude which was launched by Thielman in his 1987 articleon Eusebius’eschatology,94but which has rarely been pursued in morerecent scholarship.95Against the traditional argument that Eusebiuswas so delighted by the success of the church under Constantine that in87PE1.4.9.

Moreover, Eusebius’continuing concerns about the potency ofthe demonic threat show that he cannot have seen his own era asthe triumphant climax of the human struggle for salvation. Conse-quently, we cannot continue to accept the suggestion that Eusebiussaw either the church or the empire as the fully realized kingdom ofGod on earth and we must therefore consider afresh how Eusebiusviewed the events and people of his time.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIPClearly Eusebius did not consider himself to be standing trium-phantly at the climax of history, but felt instead that humankindmaintain his interest in the second coming and last judgement far beyond his earlyworks, although this is by no means the main purpose of A.

Achieving this freedom was, in Eusebius’view,greatly facilitated by the spread of divine teaching and instruction,whether that was carried out by the divine Logos, the incarnate Christ,or his disciples. Just as the struggle against the demons was not seenby Eusebius as lying in the distant past, so the divine instructionnecessary to securing salvation was also held by him to continueinto the present day, facilitated now, not by the apostles, but by anew generation of virtuous Christian leaders. For Eusebius, real sig-nificance therefore lay, not in either the church or the empire, butrather in thefigures of their leaders, the bishops, and the Christianemperor.He presents thesefigures as teachers, instructing their followers in‘correct’doctrine and a godly lifestyle in order to free them from thedemons and increase their chances of achieving salvation. They areshown as continuing the teaching of Christ, modelling themselveson his example and thereby spreading the saving Christian message.The conversion of Constantine and his patronage of the church wereundoubtedly significant for Eusebius, yet this significance lay, notin the fact that this marked the end of a historical struggle for salva-tion, but in the fact that, as part of this ongoing struggle, it greatlystrengthened the position of the virtuous. For thefirst time, politicaland religious leadership were united in Christian virtue. No longerwould citizens of the empire be pulled in two different directions—away from demons if they followed the Christian bishops, buttowards them if they chose to imitate their emperor. This wouldboth facilitate the salvation of greater numbers of people and hastenthe further decline of the demons. However, in order for thesebenefits to be maintained, it was necessary for Christian leaders toadopt both a high standard of virtue and a united front againstthe demons. Thus, even in a work which on the surface appearsunshakably triumphant, like theVC, we see Eusebius repeatedlyemphasizing the importance of unity and the need to set high stand-ards of virtue.In order to understand Eusebius’attitude, it is important to notethat, while some earlier discussions of Eusebius’thought have focusedon a division between the‘Christian Church’and‘Roman Empire’,9999In particular: Hollerich,Eusebius’Commentary on Isaiah, 15, 201.Demonic Activity and Historical Progress159OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"thinking of Eusebius’concerns primarily in terms of such impersonalinstitutions or structures is actually somewhat misleading. Through-out Eusebius’works, the emphasis is often far more on the role ofleaders, and particularly on their moral qualities, than on politicalor administrative structures and events.100For Eusebius, as theHEreveals, the Christian church may be largely identified with theepiscopal hierarchy of which he was a part. TheHEopens with apromise to record, among other things,‘the successions from theholy apostles’,101which it does primarily by listing the successivebishops of various major sees,102attempting where possible tomake a connection between thefirst bishop of each see and one ofthe apostles.103As Grant has highlighted, this idea of an unbrokensuccession from the apostles—and hence from Christ himself—servesto underscore, for Eusebius, the validity of the doctrine endorsedby the church, in opposition to both‘heretics’and pagans.104Of course, Eusebius was not thefirst Christian writer to placesuch emphasis on this idea of‘apostolic succession’. Earlier writers,including Irenaeus of Lyons and Clement of Rome, had similarlyargued that‘correct’Christian doctrine had been transmitted uninter-rupted from the apostles by the succession of Christian bishopsand teachers.105However, Eusebius’emphasis on the important roleof church leaders is not confined solely to theHEor to the idea of‘apostolic succession’. Hollerich has drawn attention to the promin-ence accorded to bishops in theCI, to the extent that Eusebiuseven suggests that the hierarchical distinctions of the church will bereplicated after the second coming in the heavenly kingdom.106Elsewhere, Eusebius repeatedly stresses—perhaps for somewhat100As Eusebius himself claims at the opening of theVC, when he declares that hewill not focus on Constantine’s military activities, laws, or peacetime government, butonly on the character of the emperor himself:VC1.11.1.101HE1.1.1.102See, for example:HE3.13.1–15.1, 3.34.1–35.1, 4.1.1, 4.4.1–5.5, 4.19.1–20.1,5.6.1–5, 5.9.1, 5.12.1–2, 5.22.1, 6.10.1–11.1, 7.2.1.103For example:HE3.2.1, 3.4.3, 3.36.1–2, 4.5.3–5.

Consequently, asking what Eusebiusbelieved the role of the church to be is, to a large degree, to askwhat he considered his own role, and that of his peers, to be.In view of the heavy emphasis which Eusebius places on the role ofChristian instruction and‘correct’doctrine in bringing people tosalvation, it is important to remember that the role of the bishopwithin his community would have involved a large element of teach-ing. Through their preaching, the instruction of catechumens, and,it might be hoped, the example of their own lifestyle, bishops andother members of the clergy were in a position to demonstrate totheir congregations how best to develop Christian virtue. AlthoughEusebius’homilies have been largely lost, it is clear from his survivingworks that he took his role as a Christian teacher very seriously.108Many of his writings, such as theQuaestiones Evangelicae, or thenow-lost treatise addressing the question of the large families fatheredby the biblical patriarchs,109served an obviously explanatory purpose,responding to particular questions that either had been, or might be,raised about matters of doctrine or the interpretation of the scrip-tures. Some, like theGeneralis elementaria introductio(GEI), dem-onstrate many of the features of a genre of pedagogical literaturecommon to both pagan and Christian education—theεἰσαγωγή.110Others are more subtly instructive—thePEandDEseek to answer thequestion of who the Christians are, while theHEalso helps to instructChristians in how they should view themselves, by providing themwith an understanding of their past as a community. In theVC,Eusebius expresses the hope that in this work‘the mention of talesbeloved of God may furnish study not without benefit but of great usefor life for those well prepared in their soul’.111107See, for example,VC1.42.1, 3.6.1, 3.15.1, 4.27.2, 4.46.1.108On which, see the excellent recent discussion of Johnson:Eusebius,51–83.109Mentioned atDE1.9.20 andPE7.8.29.110On theGEIas anεἰσαγωγήand its relationship to a similar work by Porphyry,On the Philosophy from Oracles, see: Johnson,‘Eusebius the Educator’,99–118.

By contrast,Eusebius shows little interest in the development of any administra-tive or institutional structures. This corresponds to Allen Brent’ssuggestion that, for earlier Christian writers, the idea of an episcopal‘apostolic succession’was drawn at least in part from the idea ofteaching successions within Greek philosophical schools, such asthose outlined by Diogenes Laertius in hisSuccessions of the Philo-sophers.113For Irenaeus, Brent suggests, it was correct teaching,rather than any priestly or ritual significance, that was preserved bythe succession from the apostles.114Similarly, it seems that, forEusebius, the role of a bishop, as a successor to the apostles, was, ifnot exclusively then at least substantially, that of a teacher.Likewise, Eusebius’interest, especially in theVCandLC—whichhave done so much to fuel the idea of his‘realized eschatology’—isnot in the abstract notion of a Christian empire, but rather in thefigure of Constantine himself, the Christian emperor. There is acrucial distinction to be drawn between Eusebius’view of theRoman Empire itself, particularly the pre-Constantinian empire,and his view of Constantine as a Christian leader who could, in hisown way, be seen as fulfilling a role not unlike that of a bishop.That Eusebius, like Origen and Melito of Sardis before him,115heldthe Roman Empire to have had a providential role in God’s histor-ical design has long been recognized.116For Eusebius, the RomanEmpire had facilitated the growth of Christianity by bringing peacebetween previously hostile nations, thereby making travel easier andenabling the spread of the Christian message.117To Eusebius, it was112For example:HE3.38.1–39.17, 4.21.1, 4.23.1–26.14, 5.26.1, 6.20.1–3, 7.20.1.113Brent,‘Diogenes Laertius’, 368.

In theDE, he argues that thepersecutions made it clear that‘the confirmation of the word came notfrom the design of men, but from the power of God’.120Even when thepersecutions are said to have fulfilled the ultimately beneficial purposeof correcting the errant church, Eusebius is quick to stress that this doesnot remove the need to punish the Roman persecutors.121In Johnson’sview, references such as these allow Eusebius to draw a distinctionbetween Christianity and the Roman Empire, and to highlight theprimary importance of the church, rather than the empire, in facilitat-ing the spread of Christianity.122However, they also demonstrate that,for Eusebius, the character of the empire was shaped largely by thecharacter of its leaders. In spite of his evident sense that Christianityhad benefited from the existence of the Roman Empire, Eusebiusrefused to celebrate the empire itself unreservedly as long as its lead-ership remained hostile to Christians.This, of course, changed with Constantine’s accession to sole rule—a development that led to the passing of legislation in favour of theChristian church, as well as to practicalfinancial support enablingthe building of new churches, and in some cases to the destruction ofpagan shrines. These measures are famously celebrated in theVC.123However, Eusebius’emphasis in this work, as well as in theLC,isnot exclusively on these official actions of the emperor. Just as, oreven more, important were Constantine’s personal qualities, whichallowed him, in Eusebius’view, to fulfil the role of a Christianteacher.124Eusebius makes this point quite explicitly, suggesting in118DE3.7.30–3;PE1.4.4.119Johnson,Ethnicity and Argument, 176–85.120DE3.7.36.121HE8.16.3.122Johnson,Ethnicity and Argument, 179, 193.123See, for example:VC1.42.2, 2.20.1–22.1, 2.44.1–45.1, 3.54.2–56.3, 3.58.1–4,4.28.1.124Constantine’s personal piety and virtuous behaviour are stressed at, forexample:VC1.9.1, 2.14.1, 3.2.2, 4.15.1–18.1, 4.22.1–3, 4.29.1, 4.33.1–2, 4.48.1.

We are told intheVChow he would deliver sermons on religious and moral issuesto his court,129while theLCsuggests that soldiers in the armyreceived similar instruction.130The importance which Eusebiusattached to this aspect of Constantine’s role is further indicated bythe fact that he chose to attach what he claimed was one of theemperor’s own speeches on Christian doctrine to the end of theVC.131In fact, Eusebius likewise suggests that Constantine’s lettersto his subjects on religious matters had the specific effect of‘keepingthose he ruled away from the deceit of demons’.132Even Constan-tine’s actions against paganism are said to have had an instructivefunction—when Constantine orders the destruction of pagan shrinesand the statues of the gods are stripped of their precious metal4.55.1.

Although the authenticity of this speech has been questioned in thepast, for our purposes the important point is that Eusebius felt it necessary toemphasize and, indeed, prove through the inclusion of this document that Constan-tine performed a role in instructing his subjects. Its inclusion thus reinforces Eusebius’presentation of Constantine as a teacher.132VC2.61.1.164The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"exteriors, people are said to have realized the error of their previousreligious practices and to have laughed at the demons they had onceworshipped, rather than fearing them.133Thus it seems that, forEusebius, Constantine’s significance lay principally in his role as ateacher of Christian piety and virtue. Just like the bishops, by activelyspreading the Christian message Constantine was working to under-mine demonic influence and hence helping to forward the divinehistorical plan. As Christian teachers, both bishops and the emperorcould be seen as performing a similarly crucial role in leading peopleto salvation.This idea that Eusebius, or even Constantine himself, might haveseen a parallel between the role of bishops and that of the Christianemperor is hardly new to Eusebian scholarship. Eusebius’report atVC4.24.1 that Constantine described himself as‘a bishop of thoseoutside’(τῶνἐκτὸς...ἐπίσκοπος) the church, together with a similarcomment by Eusebius that Constantine was like‘a shared bishop’(τιςκοινὸςἐπίσκοπος),134has long been the subject of scholarly debate.135This debate, however, has tended to focus on what these commentsmight reveal about either Eusebius’or Constantine’s attitude towardsthe relationship between the church and the empire as separateandevenopposedorganizations,136rather than on what they canshow about Eusebius’understanding of the duties of bishops andthe emperor in their own right. For Johnson, Constantine’sremark,at least in Eusebius’interpretation, if not in Constantine’soriginalintention, is‘an expression of the doctrine of the separation ofChurch and State’.137However Eusebius’designation of the emperorby the same term,ἐπίσκοπος, used to denote the bishops of the churchsurely suggests unity rather than separation. Of course, this parallel133VC3.57.1. See also:LC8.8.134VC1.44.1.135See, for example: C.

In particular, it suggests that Eusebius sawthese earthly leaders as imitating the instructive, supervisory role of theChrist-Logos.In a parallel which has not previously been explored by scholars,Eusebius often uses various forms of the wordἐπισκοπέω(oversee),from whichἐπίσκοποςis derived, to describe divine activity on earth,particularly that of the Christ-Logos.138In theVC, for example,Eusebius suggests that it was only‘the supervision of God (θεοῦτιςἐπισκοπὴ), and the fear of the emperor’that prevented rioting inAntioch.139While Rapp has demonstrated how Eusebius’presenta-tion of Constantine as anἐπίσκοποςwas tied in part to his portrayal ofthe emperor as a‘type’of Moses in theVC, she gives little consider-ation to this further parallel with Christ.140Rapp pointed out that,since Moses was considered by many early Christian writers to be a‘prefiguration’of Christ, the parallel between Constantine and Mosescould suggest a further parallel between Constantine and Christ;141however, this link was also made more directly through the use of thetermἐπίσκοπος. Moreover, sinceἐπίσκοποςwas also used to designatebishops of the church, they too could be drawn into this parallel. InEusebius’works, the supervisory role of anἐπίσκοποςis thus exer-cised in common by the Christ-Logos, by Constantine, and by thebishops of the church. It therefore seems that, for Eusebius, Christianleaders, whether bishops or the emperor, stood almost in the place ofthe Christ-Logos, performing a similar role of instruction and guid-ance to lead people to divine truth.This sense that Christian leaders were acting almost as represen-tatives of the divine on earth is reflected in the kind of language whichEusebius uses to describe them. Eusebius’presentation of Constan-tine as a mimetic image of Christ on earth in theLCandVC, and hisclaim that the emperor had taken the divine likeness into his soul,have often been noted by scholars,142who have at times suggested138See, for example:VC1.15.1, 3.59.2;LC6.9;DE4.10.15, 8.2.5, 8.2.112, 8.2.113,10.4.17;HE3.7.9, 8.1.7, 9.8.15, 9.10.3;De eccl. theol.3.14.1.8.139VC3.59.2.140Rapp,‘Imperial Ideology’.141Rapp,‘Imperial Ideology’, 693.

There are clear parallels between the terms whichEusebius uses of Constantine in theLC, and his earlier description ofBishop Paulinus of Tyre in the panegyric which he delivered at thededication of the new basilica at Tyre in around 315.144In this speech,Paulinus is said to‘carry in his own soul the impression of Christ inwhole, the word, the wisdom, the light’,145and to have created as faras possible earthly images of heavenly‘models’and‘patterns’throughhis actions.146Thus it seems that, for Eusebius, Christianἐπίσκοποι,whether men of the church or the emperor, act at their best asrepresentative images of the Christ-Logos on earth.However, while Eusebius was evidently quite comfortable transfer-ring the language of divineμίμησιςthat he had once used of bishopslike Paulinus to the newfigure of the Christian emperor, this shouldnot be taken as an indication that the emperor had displaced thebishops in Eusebius’eyes. The fact that in theVC, one of his lastworks, Eusebius drew a deliberate parallel between Constantine andthe bishops, through his description of Constantine as anἐπίσκοπος,demonstrates that the importance of the bishops was not diminishedfor him by the existence of a Christian emperor. Rather, in theVC,Constantine is shown as adding himself to the number of the existingbishops. Hence, when Constantine is said to have claimed that he wasalso a bishop, we are told that this comment was made while theemperor was receiving other bishops at a banquet, reinforcing thesense that he is simply one bishop among equals.147Similarly, whenEusebius describes Constantine as being like a‘shared bishop’, theemperor is said to have‘sat in the middle as though one of many’.148Eusebius allows for no distinction between bishops of the church andthe emperor—in terms of their importance in God’s salvific design,they are equal.Thus, in dismissing the idea that Eusebius believed himself to bestanding at the very end of historical time, we are led to reassessthe view that he must have invested particular significance in either143Trompf suggests that, in its descriptions of Constantine, theVCis‘virtuallysanctifying but never divinising’:Early Christian Historiography, 138.144On the date of this speech, see:C&E, 162.

Instead, when we look anew at Eusebius’works, freed from misleading assumptions about his understandingof history, we can see that, for him, real significance lay in the kind ofvirtuous Christian leadership that might be displayed either by thebishops of the church at their best, like Paulinus of Tyre, or by anexemplary Christian emperor, like Constantine. This significancestemmed from the role of these leaders in God’s plan for salvation.As teachers and models of virtue, they could provide the kind ofinstruction in piety that would enable their followers to resist themalign influence of the demons and turn instead towards the trueChristian God. As such, what Eusebius celebrates in his later works isnot the fulfilment of God’s kingdom on earth in either the church orthe empire, but rather the unification of political and religious lead-ership in Christian virtue and the role which that might play infurthering God’s historical plan for salvation.CONCLUSIONSWhile Eusebius undoubtedly welcomed many of the events of hislater life, particularly the new political and religious circumstancesafter the Council of Nicaea, it is important not to confuse thisgenerally positive attitude with a sense of naïve triumphalism. Forall his celebration of Constantine’s patronage of the Christian church,Eusebius was by no means blind to the challenges that continued toconfront the virtuous. In theVC, much as he sought to downplayinternal disagreements within the church, like the Donatist schismin Africa or the dispute over the date of Easter, Eusebius could notcompletely avoid referring to them.149Moreover, his remarks make itclear that he held such disputes to be the work of demons.150Even ina work that was meant to be celebratory and triumphal, then, wefindEusebius still disturbed by the lingering demonic threat. Throughout149VC1.45.2, 2.61.1–5, 2.62.1, 2.73.1, 3.4.1, 3.5.1–3, 3.23.1, 3.59.1–2, 4.41.1–4.150Some of these disputes are attributed directly to demonic activity (VC1.45.2–3); others more obliquely to the work of‘envy’(VC2.61.3, 3.1.1, 3.59.1,4.41.1), which, as we saw in Chapter 2, was immediately identifiable as a characteristicof demons for Eusebius. Some are attributed to both at once:VC2.73.1. AtVC3.5.3,the dispute is said to be the work of an‘unseen enemy’(ἀφανοῦςἐχθροῦ) of the church,in what is surely another reference to demonic activity.168The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"theVC, there is repeated emphasis on the importance of unity withinthe church.151Having seen that, for Eusebius, it was the unity andconsistency of virtuous Christian leadership that was so important forencouraging salvation, we can recognize that such calls for unity hada particular urgency for him. Unless Christian leaders were able tomaintain the high standards of behaviour necessary to imitate thedivine, and the level of unity that would allow them to present astrong front in thefight against the demons, there remained thedanger that the demons—always present and always active—mightfind a way to regain some of their influence.There can be no doubt that Eusebius was alert to this possibility.Modern scholars view Eusebius’works with the benefit of hindsight,aware that after Constantine there would be a largely unbrokensuccession of Christian emperors. But Eusebius had no such know-ledge. The example of Licinius, who had switched from toleration ofChristians to outright persecution, was hardly promising. Indeed, thevery existence of theVC, often read as a‘mirror for princes’, designedto instruct Constantine’s heirs in the requirements of virtuous Chris-tian monarchy,152demonstrates both the importance, in Eusebius’eyes, of ensuring that future emperors maintained high standardsof virtue, and his awareness that such continuity could not beguaranteed.Nor was the unreliability of imperial Christian virtue the onlypotential problem for Eusebius. As we saw in the section‘The Roleof Demons in History’, Eusebius considered‘heresy’to be the work ofdemons and the last years of his life saw him actively involved intheological disputes. Even as he was preparing theVC, Eusebius wasalso composing polemical works directed against the teaching ofMarcellus of Ancyra, theContra Marcellum(CM) andDe ecclesiasticatheologia(De eccl. theol.).153Thus, even at the end of his life, Eusebiuswas troubled by and actively participating in the kind of dispute thathe felt to be the work of demons.

Moreover, Eusebius’ideas aboutsovereignty are not confined solely to those works which focus on thefigure of Constantine. The later books of theHistoria ecclesiastica(HE) also discuss the political affairs of Eusebius’own lifetime andmention a variety of different rulers, portrayed both positively andnegatively.7Even in theDemonstratio Evangelica(DE), wefind occa-sional, brief references to the role of the Roman Empire and its rulersin relation to the spread of Christianity.8Crucially, the widespread idea that Eusebius viewed Constantine as avictorious eschatologicalfigure fails to take account of the continuingpresence of hostile demons in Eusebius’understanding of the uni-verse.9It is hard to reconcile such a positive picture with the accountsin many of Eusebius’works of malevolent demons continuing tochallenge and mislead humankind. As a result, we need tofind a newway of understanding Constantine’splaceinEusebius’thought and toreassess Eusebius’presentation of the role of a Christian sovereign inthe light of his concerns about the continuing demonic threat.To do so, this chapter will approach the question of Eusebius’ideasof kingship from an angle rather different from that usually adopted.Previous scholarship has tended to focus above all on Eusebius’5For example: Williams,Authorised Lives,25–57; Johnson,Eusebius, 155–66.6For example: Rapp,‘Imperial Ideology’, 685–95; M.

This chapter will therefore devote at leastas much attention to Eusebius’presentation of Constantine’s oppon-ents and predecessors, usually portrayed by Eusebius as vicious‘tyrants’, as it will to his presentation of Constantine. In those workswhich deal most thoroughly with matters of earthly sovereignty—theVC,LC, andHE—wefind bad rulers repeatedly linked with demons orthe devil.11Eusebius presents tyrannical and vicious rulers as beingunder the influence of, indeed, enslaved to, demons.12He argues, as aresult, that they are unfit to rule, and incapable of meeting the criteriarequired of a good monarch by traditional Hellenistic kingship theory.Consequently, he is able to present Constantine’s actions againsthis former co-rulers as entirely justified and praiseworthy.More than this, Eusebius’ideas about sovereignty are underpinnedby his continuing concern over the ongoing demonic threat. Hesuggests that, by a process ofμίμησις, or imitation, such tyrantspose a threat not only to their subjects’earthly well-being, but alsoto their spiritual health, and hence to their salvation. Tyrants wouldlead their subjects towards demons and hence, in order to combat thedemonic threat, a virtuous Christian sovereign, free from the influ-ence of demons, is essential. Thus, for Eusebius, Constantine wasimportant, not as the triumphant eschatologicalfigure envisaged inprevious scholarship, but rather as a keyfigure in the ongoing battleto secure people from demonic influence.‘THINKING WITH’TYRANNYBefore progressing further in our examination of Eusebius’represen-tation of the tyrannical in his works, it is important to give someconsideration to the concept of tyranny in the ancient and late antiqueworld more broadly. For several centuries before Eusebius was writing,10See, however, the brief remarks at Johnson,Eusebius, 167–8, and the largelydescriptive discussion of Farina,L’impero, 224–34.11See, for example:HE8.14.5, 8.14.8;VC1.58.3;LC5.2–3, 7.6–7.12For example:LC5.2–3;VC1.13.3.Demonic Tyranny and Virtuous Kingship173OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"tyranny had ceased to be a neutral designation for a particular kindof political constitution.13Rather, from as early as thefifth centuryBCE, it had become a weapon of invective, laden with negativeconnotations.14In Aristotle’sdefinition of various possible politicalconstitutions in hisPolitics, tyranny had represented the negative,inverted form of monarchy.15Moreover, thefigure of the tyrant hadbeen a staple of classical Greek tragedy and in the process becameassociated with a further series ofnegative behaviours and charac-teristics.16By the time it passed from Greek to Roman politicaldiscourse, characteristics such as arrogance, lust, and cruelty wereconsidered standard in thefigure of a negative ruler,17as the trad-itional Greek tyrant became assimilated with the hatedfigure of theRomanrex.18Thus, to label someone a‘tyrant’was to condemn notonly the quality of their rule, but also their character and lifestyle.19Polybius had even suggested that it was hard tofind‘agreaterormore pungent charge’to make against a person, on the grounds thatthechargeoftyranny‘encompasses a meaning of the greatest impi-ety and brings together every injustice and unlawfulness in man’.20Among early Christian writers, the concept of tyranny developedstill further, with the‘tyrant’acquiring yet another negative association—the persecution of Christians.21Justin Martyr and Tertullian donot go quite so far as to label current emperors as‘tyrants’, but theycome close. Both writers suggest that to persecute Christians is to act13Dunkle suggests that, in its original meaning, the termtyrannossimply desig-nated‘a ruler who had gained power by usurpation and did not necessarily signify thatthe ruler was oppressive’: J.

This connection between the persecution of Christiansand tyranny is one that would later also appear in Eusebius.23Christian writers therefore not only preserved, but also extendedthe negative connotations that attached to thefigure of the‘tyrant’.Recognizing the power that the label‘tyrant’held in the ancientworld, a number of scholars have stressed in recent years that theconcept of tyranny could be‘good to think with’, providing a meansby which people could explore what was necessary in a good leaderor political constitution through consideration of its opposite.24Inconsequence, there was a long literary and philosophical tradition,reaching back to the earliest Greek historians, of contrasting the vicesof a tyrant with the equivalent virtues of a good sovereign.25This isa strategy which Eusebius also employs to considerable effect in theVCandLC.26Yet the vices associated with thefigure of the tyrantwere notfixed, but might be added to by different writers as they sawfit.27For instance, Christian writers’belief that persecuting Christianswas characteristic of tyranny would not necessarily have beenshared by non-Christian authors. Thus tyranny was, in Sian Lewis’assessment,‘a malleable construct’, which could change according tocircumstances.28Previous work on the idea of tyranny in late antiquity, however, hastended to focus less on this idea of the tyrant as a concept to‘thinkwith’, and more on the question of legitimacy. It has been suggestedthat the meaning of the term‘τύραννος/tyrannus’changed during the22Justin.1 Apol.3; Tertullian,Apology, 2.13–15.23See, for example:HE8.14.8–9, 9.2.1, 9.4.2; Mart. Pal.

As Alan Wardman haspointed out, with regard to the fourth century it‘is very difficult toissue a satisfying judgement on the way or ways in which emperorsproper were lawfully made’.30This is a problem which GilbertDagron has argued continued into the later Byzantine period, whenhe suggests that the lack of a clearly established system for arrangingthe transfer of imperial authority led contenders for power to basetheir claims on the competing grounds of inheritance and merit.31Both of these claims can similarly be found in panegyrics from earlyin Constantine’s reign,32while the same collection of panegyrics alsocontains several attempts to link the emperor in question to someform of divine patron or ancestor.33This suggests that, both in thefourth century and beyond, there were a range of ways in which rulersmight attempt to justify and strengthen their position. Indeed, thedevelopment of the Tetrarchy under Diocletian can only have madethis question of‘legitimacy’more complex. The creation of a hier-archy of multiple emperors ruling in east and west meant that thedefeated imperial rivals branded as‘tyrants’could now include notonly those who had never held imperial power, but also, as in the caseof Licinius, someone whose rule had been recognized by his co-emperors for some time. This makes any attempt to associate thelanguage of tyranny with a particular understanding of‘legitimacy’extremely problematic. Rather, since it appears that ideas of‘legitim-acy’were constantly being negotiated, we need to look instead at howemperors, and those writing in their honour, sought to justify theiractions and to persuade people that they were the best possible ruler.Moreover, as Barnes sensibly recognized, the apparent proliferationin the use of the term‘tyrant’in the years following Constantine’sdefeat of Maxentius in 312 was surely a result of the fact that the wordhad not yet lost its negative connotations, rather than a sign that it had29For a valuable summary of this debate, see Barnes,‘Oppressor, Persecutor,Usurper’.30Wardman,‘Usurpers and Internal Conflicts’, 225.31Dagron,Emperor and Priest,13–53, esp. 37.

Thus it appears that, at least in the earlyfourth century when Eusebius was writing, the idea of the‘tyrant’remained loaded with negative connotations. Since tyranny was not afixed and neutral designation for a particular political constitution, butrather a constructed and negotiable idea, it is important to pay closeattention to Eusebius’use of the term in order to determine what heunderstood by the concept.Throughout those works in which Eusebius is most concernedwith matters of earthly sovereignty—theVC,LC, and later books oftheHE—he repeatedly describes Constantine’s imperial predeces-sors and rivals using the vocabulary of tyranny.36In theVC,theTetrarchs, with the exception of Constantine’s father, Constantius,are labelled as‘tyrants’,37and Eusebius is careful to emphasize that,despite being raised in the households of these men, Constantine didnot share their moral character.38Thus, even before he is emperor,Constantine is depicted as antithetical to the tyrants—for Eusebius,it seems, it was not simply the manner of a person’srulethatwoulddetermine whether or not they were to be called a tyrant, but theirentire way of life. Similarly, in theHE,thelabelof‘tyrant’is onceagain applied to Constantine’s predecessors and rivals as emperor,39while, in theLC, it is clear that Eusebius wishes to associate earlieremperors with a tyrannical style of government. In theLCwe do notfind any specific individuals accused of tyranny; rather, Eusebiusrefers obliquely to those‘thoughtatsometimetorulewith34Barnes,‘Oppressor, Persecutor, Usurper’,55–6.35Wardman,‘Usurpers and Internal Conflicts’, 223.36For example:HE8.14.1, 8.14.7, 9.1.1, 9.9.3, 9.11.2, 10.9.2;VC1.12.2, 1.26.1,1.27.1, 1.49.2, 2.4.2, 2.18.1;LC5.2.37VC1.12.2:‘The tyrants of our own time’(τύραννοι...οἱκαθ’ἡμας).

Even in places where the terms‘tyrant’or‘tyranny’are used without further elaboration, the degree to whichthey are elsewhere associated with negative characteristics and behav-iours makes it impossible to read these words simply as neutraldescriptions. It therefore seems clear that, in using these words,Eusebius was seeking to tarnish the reputation of Constantine’s rivals.This, then, is one way in which the concept of tyranny functionswithin these works—it allows Eusebius to undermine the authority ofConstantine’s competitors for imperial power. Constantine, by con-trast, is presented as a liberator and any questions about his own—less than straightforward—route to sole rule are tactfully obscuredby this comprehensive attack on the character of his enemies.44Yetthis is not the only role which the idea of the tyrant played in theseworks, for, as we have seen, tyranny was a concept‘good to thinkwith’. The vices attributed by Eusebius to his tyrants help to highlightkey features of his virtuous sovereign as well. In this way, Eusebius’presentation of tyranny contributes to creating his picture of the goodruler. It is also a means of trying to exert some influence over theactions of future sovereigns by suggesting that anyone who acts in avicious manner would become a tyrant rather than a king.

In manycases, there is considerable overlap between Eusebius’tyrannical vicesand those found in the works of earlier non-Christian writers, yetEusebius also added to these another negative association that reflectsthe influence of his Christian beliefs. This was the idea of a linkbetween human tyrants and wicked demons.DEMONIC SLAVERYIn the section‘Further Polarities’of Chapter 3, we saw that Eusebiusassociated demons with an oppressive and tyrannical style of rule; itis clear from his descriptions of earthly tyranny that he likewisesaw human tyrants asfirmly linked to the demonic.

Within Roman society,P. A. Brunt has suggested that, whilst there had been provision inthe earliest, archaic Roman law for a citizen to be enslaved for debt,such a sale would, by law, have had to take place outside Romanterritory, implying that it was considered to be incompatible withromanitas.48Indeed, Aristotle had set out in hisPoliticsa theory of slavery inwhich the condition of slaves was presented as almost less than45For example, human tyrants:VC1.13.3, 1.36.2;HE8.14.6, 9.9.3; demons:VC1.13.3;LC5.3;HE8.12.3 (τῇτῶν δαιμόνων δουλείᾳ);CI294.8–9;GEI,PG22.1073,22.1252;CPs,PG23.1076.34–9.

The idea that tyranny, in effectivelyenslaving a population, was a barbarous form of government isreflected in Eusebius’LC, where Eusebius suggests that rulers heelsewhere characterizes as tyrants are themselves barbarians.Demons, often presented by Eusebius as tyrannical, are described intheLCas‘rougher than all barbarians’.52Slightly later in the speech,Eusebius also suggests that Constantine has‘defeated that dual bar-barian nation’of both demons and godless humans, suggesting thatEusebius also held human tyrants to be barbarous.53However, for Eusebius, earthly tyrants were not simply slave mas-ters in the manner envisaged by Aristotle, but also slaves themselves.Wefind this expressed most fully in theLC, where Eusebius makes itclear that he believed vicious sovereigns to be enslaved to demons. Inthis case, Eusebius is not discussing the example of a particular tyrantbut, more generally, thosefigures who might be‘thought at some timeto rule with tyrannical force’,54showing that he considered thisenslavement to demons to be characteristic of all human tyrants.Here, Eusebius poses his audience a question:‘How,’he asks,can a ruler and lord of the whole world be someone who has attachedhimself to numberless embittered masters, and who is a slave (δοῦλος)of dishonourable hedonism, a slave of intemperate madness for women,49Garnsey,Ideas of Slavery, 113, citing Arist.Pol.1256b20–5 and 1280a31–5.

Concluding the sentencewith the emphatic pairing of wicked demons and spirits ensures that itis these malevolent spiritual forces which linger longest in the audi-ence’s minds. It is surely also significant that this list of traditionalvices is framed here by opening and closing references to‘embitteredmasters’,‘murderous demons’, and‘deadly spirits’.57This implies thatthese traditional characteristics and behaviours of the tyrant are in facta product of their enslavement to demons.In developing this idea of spiritual enslavement, Eusebius drew ona long tradition of earlier thought. It was widely accepted in bothGreek and Christian thought that it was possible for a person who wasnot legally a slave nevertheless to be enslaved in a moral sense. Mostfamous is the Stoic doctrine of moral slavery, elaborated at lengthin Philo of Alexandria’sEvery Good Man Is Free.58This formedonly half of a longer two-part work, which originally included the55LC5.3.

Johannessen,‘Tyrants, Slaves and Demons: The Language of Demonic Slavery in Eusebius of Caesar-ea’sDe Laudibus Constantini’,Studia Patristica72 (2014), 111–22.56Herodotus, for instance, claimed that envy, indiscriminate murder, rape, and alack of respect for the law were characteristic of tyrants: Hdt.Hist.3.80.4–5; Euripidesassociated tyrants with the illegal acquisition of wealth, hedonism and lust: Euripides,Supplices444–55; Plato characterized the tyrannical character (in this case not restrictedto those who occupied positions of leadership) as disposed to theft, murder, impiety,and corruption:Rep.9.575b.57It is clear that Eusebius is thinking of demons in his initial reference to‘numberless embittered masters’, for in the sentence immediately before this, Eusebiushad referred to the same person having similarly associated himself with‘numberlessfalsely drawn icons of demons’(LC5.3).58On Stoic ideas of moral slavery, see Garnsey,Ideas of Slavery, 131–3.

At Romans 6:12, Paul instructshis audience not to‘let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies,to make you obey their passions’.64Elsewhere, he describes how‘withmyflesh I am a slave to the law of sin’.65As Peter Garnsey hasobserved, this Pauline language of enslavement bears considerablesimilarity to the earlier Stoic notion of moral slavery, with slavery tosin replacing slavery to the passions.66There can be no doubt thatEusebius would have been very familiar with Paul’s letters—indeed,he quotes passages from the Epistle to the Romans on many occa-sions.67We also know that he was aware of Philo’s discussions ofslavery.

Several Christianapologists writing in times of persecution had suggested that badrulers were acting under the influence of demons.72For instance,in hisApology, a work which Eusebius appears to have known,73Tertullian wrote to the Roman provincial governors that‘theremight be a power hidden in concealment which directs you againstthe form and against the nature of judgement and also against thelaws themselves’.74For Tertullian, attacks on the Christians were soperverse that they could only be attributed to the malign inspirationof wicked spiritual powers, although Tertullian does not specificallyuse the language of enslavement here. We dofind the vocabulary ofslavery in Justin’sApology, however.75Justin does not go as far asEusebius in claiming that the emperors actually are already enslavedto demons; rather, he frames his suggestion of an association be-tween bad rulers and demons in the form of a warning. He urges hisaddressees—including the emperor Antoninus Pius and his heirMarcus Aurelius76—to be on their guard against the deceitful attacksof the demons, who, he claims, seek to make the emperors their‘slaves and servants’.77Justin raises the idea that rulers might be71Eusebius does quote from Philo’sEvery Good Man Is FreeatPE8.12.1–19.However, the passage which Eusebius quotes is a description of the community of theEssenes and the context of the quotation is not a discussion of slavery, but rather anattempt to prove the superiority of the‘Hebrew’lifestyle. Thus, while it proves thatEusebius had read at least some of Philo’s treatise, we cannot use this quotation todetermine how far Eusebius was influenced by Philo’s understanding of moral slavery.72For discussion of this theme in the works of the early Christian apologists,including Justin, Tertullian, Clement, and Athenagoras, see: Pagels,‘ChristianApologists’, 301–25.73Eusebius quotes from theApologyfive times in theHE(HE2.2.5–6, 2.25.4,3.20.7, 3.33.3, 5.5.7) and Carriker suggests that this was probably the only work byTertullian to which he had access, most likely in a Greek translation: Carriker,Library,261–2.74Tert.Apol.2.14.75It appears that Eusebius also had access to both parts of Justin’sApology, for heincludes them in a list of Justin’s works atHE4.18.1–2.

Eusebius appears to have combined well-established ideas of moral slavery with a long Christian tradition ofassociating bad rulers with demons to produce the idea that‘tyrants’were enslaved to demons. In searching for the cause of a soul’senslavement, either to sin or to the passions, and in identifyingthat cause as an initial enslavement to demons, Eusebiusfirmlygrounds the notion of moral slavery in physical reality. In this, hisunderstanding of moral slavery differs from that of both Philo andPaul. For these writers, the idea of slavery to the passions remainsmetaphorical—we are not led to envisage a physical master externalto the moral slave. In Eusebius’thought, however, wefind the moralslave placedfirmly in the power of external beings—the demons.These, as we have seen, were as powerful and as physical for Eusebiusas any external human master would have been.78Eusebius draws adistinction between the kind of slavery to vice and immorality dis-cussed by Philo and Paul, and a prior slavery to demons. AtLC5.3,Eusebius implies that the vicious character of the bad rulers underdiscussion is at least partly a result of their enslavement to wickeddemons.79Eusebius is therefore not only accusing thesefigures ofbeing morally corrupt, he is actually denying their independence.As a result, Eusebius is able to suggest that thesefigures areincapable of ruling. By framing his suggestion that bad rulers arethe slaves of demons as a rhetorical question, Eusebius is encouraginghis audience to note the striking paradox in the idea that a‘lord of thewhole world’might also be a slave.80He implies that a person’senslavement to demons makes it impossible for him to rule. This iscontrasted with Eusebius’suggestion that Constantine alone may bedescribed as‘truly lord of himself’—clearly Constantine has the leveldivert them from demonic influence: Pagels,‘Christian Apologists’, 307, citing Just.2 Apol.15.78See above: Chapter 2, section‘Physical Demons’.79This suggests a similar relationship between tyrants and demons to that found inTertullian; he suggests that the actions of the persecutors are so wrong-headed thatthey can only be the result of demonic influence: Tert.Apol.2.14.80LC5.3.184The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"of independence necessary to make an effective leader.81Eusebius wascertainly aware that there were other ways, beyond claims to virtue,by which a ruler might seek to justify his position, for he deployssome of them in support of Constantine.82However, by suggestingthat vice is in fact evidence of a ruler’s enslavement, Eusebius effect-ively overrides these other claims to authority. From Eusebius’per-spective, a moral slave simply cannot be an emperor; consequently, itlittle matters whether such a person had gained his position throughinheritance, or even whether he had been widely acknowledged asthe ruler.This sense that even someone who, despite being in all outwardappearance the emperor, might not in fact be a true sovereign recursthroughout theLC. In this work, Eusebius sets up a contrast betweenthe outer form and inner reality of a tyrant’s position. Eusebiusintroduces this distinction to his discussion of sovereignty in theprologue to theLC, when he announces that what will concern himin this speech is the nature of the difference between‘the exemplar ofkingship in our time and the fraudulent impression (τὸχάραγμακεκιβδηλευμένου)’.83The phrase which Eusebius chose to describethe opposite of his model king is worthy of note, since it is powerfullyresonant of counterfeit coinage. The word‘χάραγμα’could refergenerally to official, stamped documents, but also, importantly,to stamped money or coinage,84while‘κίβδηλος’, from the verb‘κιβδηλεύω’(‘to adulterate’), was used of adulterated coinage.85With this phrase, Eusebius is thereby equating the opposite of themodel sovereign to a counterfeit coin, with all its associated conno-tations of falseness. Such a ruler may thus be seen as just as worthlessand, potentially, just as socially damaging as counterfeit coinage.Crucially, however, Eusebius is drawing attention to an important81LC5.4.82In particular, Eusebius stresses that Constantine inherited his position from hisfather:HE8.13.12–13, 9.9.1;VC1.9.2, 1.22.1–2. Williams has noted that ideas ofinheritance were particularly important to Constantine and his sons, arguing thatConstantine’s father Constantius appears in theVC‘above all to show that Constan-tine was a legitimate ruler’:Authorised Lives, 52. See also: Farina,L’impero, 169.Although the terminology of‘legitimacy’is unhelpful, it is nonetheless evident thatEusebius wished to avoid giving the impression that Constantine owed his positionexclusivelyto his virtue. I will demonstrate, however, that the question of virtueremained the most important requirement for sovereignty for Eusebius, even in thecase of the Constantinian dynasty (see the section‘Conclusions’).83LC Prol.5.84LSJ,s.v.χάραγμα.85LSJ,s.v.κιβδηλεία.Demonic Tyranny and Virtuous Kingship185OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"distinction between appearance and reality: a counterfeit coin may‘look the part’, just as a tyrant may dress, act, and even be treated likea sovereign. In reality, however, both are base and without worth.Having established this important distinction at the very startof his oration, Eusebius is then able to pick up on this idea againlater on. AtLC5.2, Eusebius makes his point explicit, saying thatan emperor of this kind‘might be thought at some time to rulewith tyrannical force, but he will at no point be called king intrue speech’.86Finally, atLC7.6, Eusebius describes the rulers of thepast, those who were enslaved to demons, as‘those thought to rule’.Once again, Eusebius makes an important point about the realityof these men’s sovereignty—it is deceptive, existing only in appear-ance but not in reality. As a result, Eusebius is able subtly to suggestthat Constantine, as the true sovereign, did nothing wrong at all inattacking men such as Licinius, for, while they may have appearedto be his co-emperors, the reality was very different.For Eusebius, a tyrant’s vices thus become evidence of a deeperproblem and are only the outer manifestation of his inner condition.Of course these vices are troubling in themselves—in many casesthey are characteristics that would prove unpleasant or even danger-ous for a ruler’s subjects. Yet Eusebius is more concerned with thebad ruler’s enslavement, which, far more than his propensity for vice,is what really disqualifies him from ruling. Eusebius’interest in thetyrants’vices as evidence of their relationship with demons reflectshis understanding of how demons might draw people away fromsalvation. As we saw in the section‘Escaping Demonic Influence’inChapter 4, Eusebius felt that the encouragement of vice was a keyweapon in the demons’arsenal. However, this was not the only meansby which Eusebius believed the demons could lead people to damna-tion; he also stresses their role in promoting false belief.87Thus, sinceEusebius suggests that vice, as a manifestation of demonic enslave-ment, disqualifies a person from ruling, we might also expect a similarsuggestion that‘incorrect’belief be seen as a distinguishing feature ofthe‘tyrant’.Sure enough, in Eusebius’presentation of Constantine’s predecessors,wefind repeated emphasis on the error of their religious beliefs.8886LC5.2.87DE7.1.103.88As Farina noted:L’impero, 225–6, 231–2.186The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Their faith in the pagan demon-gods and particularly the folly oftrusting in these lesser spiritual beings instead of the true ChristianGod is highlighted in Eusebius’descriptions of the various civil warsbetween the Tetrarchs.

Maxentius, for example, is said to have cut open apregnant woman as part of a magical ritual.91This is a practice whichwe alsofind condemned later in the fourth century by the paganhistorian Ammianus Marcellinus.92Licinius is similarly condemnedfor having recourse to magical practices.93For Eusebius, tyrantsare thus characterized both by vice and by religious error, both ofwhich, in his eyes, are manifestations of their enslavement todemons and hence are evidence that they are unsuited to positionsof leadership.Moreover, the kind of‘false’belief encouraged by demons was not,for Eusebius, restricted to pagan practices, but also encompassed‘heterodox’Christian belief. This is less heavily emphasized as afeature of tyranny by Eusebius—unsurprisingly, given that Eusebiuswas mainly describing the‘historical’tyranny of Constantine’s pre-decessors, who were, of course, pagans, rather than Christians of anypersuasion.

The likelihood that Eusebius wished to excludefrom ruling those Christians whose views he regarded as heterodoxcannot be ignored.Early in theVC, when describing the kind of example whichConstantine provides to his subjects, Eusebius repeatedly describeshim as a model of‘θεοσέβεια’.99Here, forms of the word appear threetimes in only eight lines of Winkelmann’s edition of the text, and thisrapid repetition helps to emphasize the importance of this particularvirtue. Moreover, on its second appearance here, it is furtherdescribed as‘απλάνος θεοσέβεια’,or‘undeceived piety’.100The use ofthis adjective, which, as discussed, appears frequently in Eusebius’presentation of the demonic,101was surely deliberate. Eusebius seemsto be emphasizing the importance of Constantine’s orthodoxy here:Constantine’s view of God has not been led astray by the demons who94For example,φιλόθεος:VC1.22.2, 3.29.2, 4.64.2;θεοσέβεια:VC1.3.4, 1.4.1,1.8.2, 1.41.2, 4.52.1;εὐσέβεια:VC1.5.2, 1.6.1, 1.8.4, 1.9.1, 1.12.3, 1.22.2, 1.39.3, 3.29.1,3.54.6, 4.18.1, 4.24.1, 4.52.1.95Eusebius uses forms of the wordθεοσέβειαandεὐσέβειαover ten times each intheVCto describe either Constantine or the kind of attitude which the emperorsought to encourage in his subjects and his sons.

In Eusebius’view, demons are to be characterized asμισάνθρωποςorἀπάνθρωπος.108This demonic inhumanity stands insharp contrast to theφιλανθρωπίαthat Eusebius gives as a character-istic of the divine.109By emphasizingφιλανθρωπίαas a virtue of hisparadigmatic ruler, Eusebius is thus focusing attention, not only on102Forφιλανθρωπίαapplied to Constantine, see, for example:HE10.9.2, 10.9.3,10.9.8;VC1.25.1, 1.43.1, 1.46.1, 2.3.1, 2.11.2, 2.20.1, 4.31.1; forφιλανθρωπίαapplied toConstantius, see:VC1.9.1, 1.14.5–6.103For example:VC4.54.1.104On this and similar virtues in earlier Greek and Roman literature, see: M.

A tyrant may be identified for Eusebius either by hisvicious lifestyle or by his false belief. Thus, both virtue and‘orthodox’Christianity become the primary qualifications for sovereignty inEusebius’view. Of course Eusebius was not thefirst Christian writerto imply—however obliquely—either that earlier, pagan emperorswere tyrants or to suggest that they might be acting underthe influence of demons. Elaine Pagels argues that scholars havefrequently underestimated the subversive core of earlier Christianapologists’political message by disregarding their discussionsof demons.110The same might be said of scholars’treatment ofEusebius’political thought.Of course Eusebius celebrates Constantine as the model of avirtuous Christian king,111but in doing so he also establishes strictcriteria for determining who should be considered capable andworthy of ruling.112At root, it was essential that a ruler should befree from the influence of demons. In view of the demons’role inencouraging both vice and‘false’belief, Eusebius has therefore founda straightforward way of identifying a tyrant, or potential tyrant. Anyruler who inclined either towards vicious behaviour, or towardsreligious beliefs with which Eusebius did not agree, would be dem-onstrating that they were closer to the demons than to God, therebydisqualifying themselves from government. This is a particularlystriking message if we remember that Eusebius wrote at least one ofhis most‘political’works, theVC, not, for the most part, underConstantine, but under his sons.113Since these new emperors hadalready recalled one of Eusebius’theological enemies, Athanasiusof Alexandria, from an exile imposed by, among others, Eusebius110Pagels,‘Christian Apologists’, 314, 323.111As scholars have long recognized—for example: Farina,L’impero, 10; Sansterre,‘Eusèbe de Césarée’, 137, 155.112As Johnson has also previously noted:Ethnicity and Argument, 194.

Itmay have been couched in the language of praise for a Christiansovereign, but Eusebius’message that an unacceptable ruler wasenslaved to demons was potentially no less subversive than JustinMartyr’s earlier suggestion that the emperors Marcus Aurelius andAntoninus Pius were at risk of losing their independence to the powerof demons.115DIVINE AND DEMONICΜΙΜΗΣΙΣFor Eusebius, however, this idea that tyrants and demons were linkedwas not simply a useful means of exerting some degree of moralinfluence over the emperors; rather, the idea that a ruler could beserving the forces of evil had considerable cosmological significance.In Eusebius’view, a ruler’s relationship with either the divine or thedemonic would have a particularly profound impact on the progressof the ongoing struggle against the demons. Where earlier authorslike Justin had urged the pagan emperors to turn to the Christian Godfor their own benefit,116Eusebius did not consider a ruler’s religiousbeliefs to be a purely personal matter. Instead, he suggests that asovereign’s decision to follow either the divine or the demonic had thepotential to affect not only his capacity to rule, but also the salvationand spiritual well-being of his subjects. This was because Eusebiusbelieved that, by a process ofμίμησις, or imitation, a ruler’s religiousbeliefs were likely to be adopted by many of his subjects. Thus, aruler’s choices would affect not only his own salvation, but that ofmany others. As a result, while a Christian sovereign would lead hissubjects away from demons, a non-Christian tyrant would encouragehis subjects to turn towards the demonic, strengthening the positionof the hostile forces in the continuing cosmic battle.The concept ofμίμησιςwas a long-standing and prominent elem-ent of Hellenistic kingship theory and its adoption by Eusebius has114On the return of Athanasius, see:C&E, 263–4; on Athanasius’prior exile by theCouncil of Tyre, see:C&E, 235–40.115Just.1 Apol. 14.116Pagels,‘Christian Apologists’, 307, citing Just.2 Apol.15.Demonic Tyranny and Virtuous Kingship191OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"often been noted by scholars over the years.117However, in focusingon Eusebius’presentation of Constantine as the mimetic image of theChrist-Logos, this scholarship has overlooked the fact that, in a non-Christian ruler, this spiritualμίμησιςmight take a—from Eusebius’perspective—far more troubling form. The idea that a good sovereignwas an image or imitation of the divine was well established inHellenistic thought, to the extent that it has been described as‘simplypart of the general intellectual atmosphere’of the period.118As farback as the second centuryBCE, writers had argued that a ruler’svirtues came from the gods and were a reflection of divine virtues.119By thefirst centuryCEthis idea was widespread: it can be found in thework of both Plutarch and Philo, among others.120Plutarch’s state-ment that‘a ruler is an icon of god’in his treatiseTo an UneducatedRulerneatly encapsulates this theory.121The crucial element of thisidea, as Plutarch expressed it, was that it was chiefly through mirror-ing the virtues of the divine that a ruler would be able to become, insome measure, semi-divine himself. Plutarch asserts that‘throughvirtue he [the sovereign] establishes a resemblance to god’.122Thisappears to have been an extension of the earlier belief that self-controlwas essential for a good sovereign, since it would allow him to governeffectively and virtuously.123Eusebius was clearly influenced by this tradition when developinghis own understanding of virtuous sovereignty, as many scholarshave recognized.124In theVC, for instance, Eusebius suggests thatConstantine has been given‘the icon of his [God’s] sole power’.125Indeed, throughout both theVCand theLC, the concept ofμίμησις117Chesnut,‘The Ruler and the Logos’, 1329–31.

Eusebius introduces the idea early in theLC:And this is the one who rules the whole of this universe, who is aboveeverything and through everything and in everything, both seen andunseen, the penetrating Logos of God, by whom and through whom theking who is a friend of God, carrying the icon of the highest kingdom, asan imitation (κατὰμίμησιν) of the best one [i.e. God], steering the ship,directs as a guide all things on earth.126Here, Eusebius appears to have picked up on several of the essentials ofthis idea as expressed by earlier Greek writers, including the notionthat the good sovereign carried the‘image’of the divine and that heruled‘as an imitation’of God.127The idea is also expressed in termswith which even non-Christians in Eusebius’audience would havebeen familiar. It would, however, be a mistake to suggest that Eusebiuswas therefore simply using the concept in order to appeal to anaudience whose sympathies lay more with Hellenistic philosophythan with Christianity, for similar ideas also run through the moreovertly ChristianVC. Here, in his description of Constantine’svice-nnaliacelebrations, Eusebius writes that the occasion‘seemed as if itwere an imagined icon of Christ’s kingdom’.128In this case, the idea ofμίμησιςis expressed in unmistakably Christian terms. As a result, it isclear that this idea of the ruler as an image of the divine formed animportant part of Eusebius’understanding of virtuous sovereignty.However, despite these similarities, it is misleading to suggest thatEusebius‘simply took over’earlier Hellenistic ideas on the topic ofdivineμίμησις,129for such an assessment overlooks an importantdifference between these earlier views and those of Eusebius. Crucially,in Eusebius’version of the theory, it was not onlyμίμησιςof the divine,but alsoμίμησιςof the demonic, that was possible. In earlier kingshiptheory, a failure on the part of the sovereign to mirror effectivelythe virtues of the divine would undoubtedly mean that he would not126LC1.6.127For similar ideas, see: Plut.Ad princ.780e–f; Ecphantus,On Kingship, 245.5,272.13–14, 274.14–16; Diotogenes,On Kingship, 265.8–12; Sthenidias,On Kingship,270.14–17.

For Eusebius, by contrast, it appearsthat a ruler must be imitating some sort of spiritual power, and if thatwas not the true Christian God, then it could only be the wickeddemons who tried so often to usurp the true place of God.130As aresult, for Eusebius, the failure of divineμίμησιςbecame not simply aregrettable lapse but a dangerous error of choice, in which the rulercame to side with the forces of evil against goodness, virtue, and piety.That Eusebius heldμίμησιςof the demonic to be a worryingpossibility is made clear in theLC, in a passage which contrasts thesoul of the virtuous sovereign with the souls of his tyrannical enemies.Eusebius begins his discussion with what appears to be a fairlystandard expression of the theory of divineμίμησις—Constantine ispraised for‘having admitted into his soul the outpourings from there[i.e. from God]’, and is therefore said to share in God’s wisdom,goodness, justice, and courage.131Eusebius then rapidly switches hisattention to the unnamed tyrannical ruler, who is said to have‘takenthe disfigured and dishonourable into his soul’.132This, Eusebiusmakes clear, is because this tyrant‘has stamped (τετυπωμένος)onhis soul numberless falsely drawn icons of demons’.133The contrastwith the good sovereign, who has the image of God in his soul, isobvious. It is equally clear from Eusebius’juxtaposition of these twofigures that he considered the relationship between the tyrannicalruler and the demons to be an inverted form of the mimetic relation-ship between the virtuous king and the truly divine Christian God.This is made still clearer by Eusebius’suggestion that the bad ruler‘has taken the rage of a savage wild-beast in exchange for kinglygentleness’.134Unrestrained rage may have been a traditional featureof a bad ruler,135but the reference to a‘savage wild-beast’immedi-ately brings to mind the demons which Eusebius elsewhere describes130On the demons’desire to usurp God’s position and honours, see:PE7.16.10.131LC5.1.132LC5.2.133LC5.3. We have already seen (Chapter 4, section‘Demonic Influence’) that thetyrant may be held to account for his association with demons, since he submits tothem through his own free choice.134LC5.2.135See for example: Hdt.Hist.1.73; Philo of Alexandria,Legatio ad Gaium, 366.For further examples, and a discussion of this theme in Greek and Roman literature,see: W.

Thus, while scholars generally focus on the idea ofConstantine’sμίμησιςof the divine in Eusebius’works, there can beno doubt that he also allowed for the more dangerous possibility ofμίμησιςof the demonic.Moreover, Eusebius’use of the verbτυπόω(to stamp) to describehow the tyrant acquires the images of demons in his soul is areminder once again that a bad ruler was not a passive victim of thedemons, but rather an active participant in their wickedness. Thisword is found in earlier Stoic psychology,139appearing in DiogenesLaertius’account of Zeno to describe the way in which an externalimpression (φαντασία) makes a mark on the human soul:Aphantasiais a moulding (τύπωσιν) on the soul,fittingly taking itsname from the impressions (τύπων) which are brought about by asignet ring in sealing-wax.140For the Stoics, receiving such an impression in the soul was not anentirely passive process; rather, it also involved actively accepting theimpression.141Thus people also had a role to play in forming136See, for example:PE4.17.9,VC1.49.1;HE10.4.14;DE10.8.73;Theoph.3.13,3.55.

Schofield,Plato: Political Philosophy(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006),265–70. D. J.

This is best illustrated by Philo, who wrotein hisLegum allegoriae:And sophantasiais composed from the approach of an external thingmoulding the mind through sensation, while impulse, the brother ofphantasia, is composed from the stretching power of the mind, which,stretching out through sensation, fastens on to the thing before it andtravels towards it, longing to attain and come together with it.142Although Philo’s philosophy was by no means exclusively Stoic,143A. A. Long suggests that, in this particular case, Philo’s discussionlargely reflects Stoic ideas.144This passage shows that, in the Stoicview, forming an impression on the soul or on the mind was an activeprocess, in which the human being had to participate. Of course,in this case Eusebius is discussing images of demons, rather thanφαντασίαιin general, but it is hard to believe that he would not havehad this Stoic idea of active participation in mind when selecting theverbτυπόω. We know that Eusebius was familiar with Philo’sLegumallegoriae, for he mentions it in his catalogue of Philo’s works in theHE.145Once again, Eusebius subtly conveys the idea that these badrulers have chosen to collaborate with the demons by allowing thesefalse images to be stamped on their souls.This idea that bad rulers might be engaged in activeμίμησιςof thedemonic has further implications for Eusebius’understanding of thecapacity of a non-Christian to rule. No one enslaved to demonicallyinspired religious error, be that polytheism or‘heresy’, could hope tobe a virtuous sovereign, for as far as Eusebius was concerned theyhave chosen the wrong model to imitate. As long as they do notrecognize the‘correct’divinity, they cannot meet the requirement ofHellenistic kingship theory that the good sovereign should imitate thedivine, for they are modelling themselves and their behaviour on thewrong exemplar. By contrast with the tyrants, whose enslavementto demons is so heavily emphasized, Eusebius in theVCdescribesConstantine as a‘slave’(δοῦλος) and a‘servant’(θεράπων) of God.146142Philo,Leg. 1.30.143On the variety of different influences on Philo’s thought, see, most recently:L.

Eusebiusis thus able, in theVC, to set up a contrast between the‘good’slavery of Constantine and the‘bad’slavery of the tyrants, therebyhelping to emphasize the wide gulf that separates them.Atfirst sight, it might appear somewhat contradictory that Eusebiusis able in one work, theVC, to describe Constantine as a‘slave’,148and in another, theLC, to refer to him as‘truly self-ruling’.149Yet thisdoes not in fact represent any inconsistency in Eusebius’thought;rather, it demonstrates the variety of different traditions which influ-enced his manner of expression. In the Greek and Roman tradition,particularly from the third century onwards, a ruler would often bepresented as a friend or companion of the divine.150It is this metaphorof friendship that Eusebius employs extensively in theLC, althoughhe also describes Constantine in these terms in theVCand otherworks.151At the same time, however, there was also a tradition inJewish literature of describing the pious, particularly prophets andkings, as‘slaves of God’.152Philo, combining Greek and Jewish influ-ences in his thought, had shown himself, like Eusebius, to be familiarwith both possible metaphors for describing this relationship withGod.153Although Philo appears to have preferred the metaphor offriendship to that of slavery, arguing that someone who was wiseshould be described as a friend of God rather than a slave,154he wasnevertheless prepared to use the verbδουλεύω(to be a slave) todescribe a pious person’s relationship to God.155For Eusebius’147VC1.6.1.148VC1.6.1.149LC5.4.150Drake,In Praise of Constantine, 58.

This notion of slaveryto God as a positive condition, even a source of pride, is extremelyprominent in Paul’s letters.156Paul regularly describes himself eitherasδοῦλοςθεοῦorδοῦλοςΧριστοῦἸησοῦ.157Moreover, these are termsthat he also applies to the recipients of his letters.158Thus, withinChristian thought, it was perfectly possible to be enslaved in a positivesense, provided that enslavement was to God or Christ,159rather thanto the devil and his demons.For Eusebius, then, these separate ideas of tyrannical enslavementto demons and ofμίμησιςcombined to suggest that anyone who wasnot an‘orthodox’Christian was incapable of ruling as a virtuoussovereign, according to the requirements set out by long-standingtheories of kingship. Yet Eusebius also envisaged a second level ofμίμησις, which led him to see the tyrant’s enslavement to demonsas a problem of cosmological significance. This was because, inEusebius’view, demonic error might spread through thefigure ofthe ruler to infect the entire state. Eusebius’statement in theVCthatConstantine’s‘tyrannical’predecessors had‘first enslaved themselvesand afterwards all of their subjects to the errors of wicked demons’makes this process clear.160As a result of the ruler’s mistaken faith indemons, his subjects have also been drawn into the power of thedemonic. In this, Eusebius was once again drawing on earlier ideas.According to earlier Greek philosophy, the good ruler, by imitatingthe divine, could lead his subjects towards the divine, encouragingthem to imitate a lifestyle of godly virtue and rationality.161Philo hadwritten that‘the obscure are the emulators of those who are esteemedand, that which they [the esteemed] seem especially to reach outfor, towards such things do they [the obscure] extend their ownimpulses’.162In the context of a tyrannical ruler, this meant that156Paul develops a distinction between‘slavery to sin’and‘slavery to God’in hisletters, the former being a bad condition, while the latter is good: Garnsey,Ideas ofSlavery, 183–6.157See, for example: Rom. 1:1; Phil. 1:1; Titus 1:1.158For example: Col. 3:24.159The idea of slavery to Christ also appears in some of Eusebius’exegetical works.See, for example:CI261.18–21, 294.22–5, 375.28–30;GEI PG22.1069, 22.1097,22.1229.160VC1.13.3.161Chesnut,‘The Ruler and the Logos’, 1312.162Philo,Mos.1.160.198The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"‘whenever a leader starts to revel in luxury and to decline towards aluxurious life, practically all his subjects also fan up the desires of thestomach and others besides those of the stomach, over and abovewhat is necessary’.163In other words, Philo argued that the majorityof a ruler’s subjects would seek to imitate their leader’s behaviour, forbetter or worse. For Eusebius, however, it was not simply the tyrants’behaviour that people would imitate, but—far more worryingly—their devotion to the demons.This would have deep implications not only for the salvation ofthose concerned, but for the progress of salvation history morebroadly. Non-Christian rulers could slow, if not reverse, the declineof demonic power by ensuring that the majority of people continuedto turn to the demons in imitation of their emperors. Indeed, in theDEEusebius is explicit about the fact that, for much of its history, theRoman Empire had done little to assist the spread of Christianity.164Eusebius suggests that the anti-Christian measures put forward byearlier emperors were permitted by God in order to demonstrate thepower of the Christian message. It is important, he argues, thatChristian worship should‘not be thought to have endured becauseof the acquiescence of the rulers’.165The significance of this idea that subjects would imitate a ruler’sreligious beliefs and practices to Eusebius’thinking on kingship isfurther reflected in his presentation of Constantine. In contrast to thetyrants, Constantine in theVCis‘a clear model of a pious life to allmen’,166while, in theLC,he‘calls up (ἀνακαλεῖται) the entire humannation to the knowledge of the best one [i.e. God]’.167The crucialpoint is that, in thefigure of Constantine, God has provided peoplewith the correct model of virtue to imitate. Eusebius’use of the verbἀνακαλέω(to call upwards), with the prefixἀνα- indicating a positivemovement upwards, contrasts strikingly with the kind of languagethat he uses about tyrants and demons. For these rulers, Eusebiusprefers to apply the prefixκατα- to verbs describing their style ofgovernment, suggesting a negative, downwards movement.168WhereConstantine leads people into a better condition, a non-Christian163Philo,Mos.1.160.164DE3.7.36–8.

A ruler likeConstantine, with‘correct’religious beliefs, is able to guide his sub-jects towards God, while a ruler enslaved to demons would lead themdown and away, thereby endangering not just his own salvation, butthat of his subjects.CONCLUSIONSEusebius has often been presented as a pillar of the political estab-lishment, an imperial sycophant who‘placed himself and his penunconditionally at the service of the Emperor’.169Yet our examin-ation of the role which Eusebius believed demons could play in thepolitical system suggests that he was not unreservedly supportive ofthe political establishment. On the contrary, Eusebius had strictrequirements of those wishing to be considered‘true sovereigns’,inwhich both virtue and faith featured heavily. Of course, Eusebius wasnot quite as subversive as those earlier thinkers studied by Pagels.Pagels suggests that writers like Athenagoras had adopted a radicallyegalitarian approach, in which all people, or at least all Christians,were to be considered equal.170Eusebius does not go nearly sofar. Indeed, we know from theDEthat he believed that differentChristians would exercise different levels of virtue, to the extent thathe envisaged two different paths towards God for these differentgroups.171Eusebius is certainly a long way from suggesting that just anyChristian would be capable of ruling. His works consequently offersome other possible justifications for imperial rule, alongside those ofvirtue and religious belief.172Of these, the most prominent is the ideaof inheritance. In both theLCand theVC, Eusebius stresses thecontinuity between Constantine and his sons as rulers of the empire.In theLC, this consists of a brief reference to Constantine sharing the169Quasten,Patrology, 319. For a similar sentiment, see: Brown,World of LateAntiquity, 86.170Pagels,‘Christian Apologists’, 319–20, citing Athenagoras,Legatio25.171DE1.8.1–4.172Farina suggests that Eusebius combines‘the principle of the divine origin ofpower’(‘dell’origine divina del potere’), with that of the‘elective’(‘elettivo’) and‘hereditary’(‘ereditario’) origins:L’impero, 169.200The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"rule of the empire with his sons as Caesars.173However, it is stressedmuch more strongly in theVC, where the idea of the imperial thronedescending from father to son appears both towards the beginning andtheendofthework.174This serves to frame Constantine’s reign withthe idea of a smooth transition of imperial power. AtVC1.9.2,Eusebius describes how‘the throne of the empire’passed from Con-stantius to Constantine and then on to the latter’ssons,stressingtheidea of continuity. Here, Eusebius likens the empire to‘an inheritance’(τις πατρῷος). This word is used again towards the end of the work,when Eusebius discusses how Constantine divided the empire amonghis three sons‘as if allocating something in the nature of an inheritanceto those most dear to him’.175This is a striking word to use, as if tosuggest that the empire belongs by right to Constantine’sfamily.Even so, there remains a sense that this inheritance is a gift of God:in theLCit is God who appoints Constantine’s sons as Caesars.Moreover, this is said to be just one of an increasing number ofrewards which God gives to Constantine,‘in exchange for his holyacts towards him [God]’.176Indeed, while the wordπατρῷοςtrad-itionally referred to something which was inherited from one’sfather,177among Christian writers the word could also refer to some-thing which belonged to God, as the Father.178As such, Eusebius’language here also hints that the empire in fact continues to belong toGod, and remains God’s to give away or to entrust to a chosen ruler.Therefore, while the importance of inheritance is undoubtedlystressed, this remains at root a reward for Constantine’s piety to-wards God—further evidence of the fact that his religious beliefs arethe‘correct’ones. In consequence, it is also an inheritance that mightbe removed in the case of a failure of piety on the part of one ofConstantine’s successors.Eusebius’first loyalty therefore lies with God in the battle againstthe demons, rather than with the emperor and the imperial family.Any failure, either of virtue or of faith, would, according to Eusebius’understanding of sovereignty, see afigure disqualified from govern-ment. If Constantine’s actions against Licinius, who had at one pointbeen presented by Eusebius as a sovereign appointed by God andrewarded for his faith, were valid and justifiable on the grounds of173LC3.1.174Cameron and Hall,Life of Constantine, 334.175VC4.51.1.176LC3.1.177LSJ,s.v.πατρῷος.178PGL,s.v.πατρῷος.Demonic Tyranny and Virtuous Kingship201OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Licinius’later turn towards the demons, then future action againstother emperors who similarly failed to remain true to the ChristianGod might be similarly justifiable.As a result of the foregoing analysis of Eusebius’understanding ofthe broader cosmological significance of the ruler, we are also able tolocate thefigure of Constantine more precisely within Eusebius’historical and cosmological vision. It has been suggested in the pastthat Eusebius identified thepax Romanawith thefinal, eschatological‘Kingdom of Peace’and envisaged a brief future of not more than afew centuries, during which the Constantinian dynasty would rule aseschatological saviour-figures.179This seems implausible in view ofthe fact that Eusebius ended his life theologically on the defensive,eying a future in which it was by no means certain that Constantine’sdescendants would share Eusebius’precise understanding of Chris-tian truth, and hence in his view remain free from demonic influence.Eusebius certainly considered Constantine to have a role to play inbringing people to salvation and driving forward the defeat of thedemons as a result of a process ofμίμησις. This role was significant,however, not because Constantine represented the concludingfigureof human history, but rather because he was operating as partof afinely poised and closely fought battle against the demons.Constantine’s importance for Eusebius is best understood in thecontext of the continuing struggle against demonic influence.179Chesnut,First Christian Histories, 160–1.202The Demonic in the Political Thought of EusebiusOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 9/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"ConclusionsThe aim of this book has been to explore the ways in which Eusebius’ideas about the demonic influenced and interacted with his thinkingon a range of other subjects that comprised his political ideas. It beganwith a survey of Eusebius’oeuvrethat sought to situate the key textsfor understanding his views on demons in the context of the politicaland religious upheavals of the era. This was followed by an essentialexamination of Eusebius’understanding of the demonic,filling a gapin previous scholarship. This showed that Eusebius believedfirmly inthe existence of demonic power, regarding demons as a hostile, activepresence in the universe. Chapter 3 demonstrated how Eusebius’belief in malevolent demonic forces helped to structure his thought,resulting in a cosmology of starkly divided, warring opposites.With the role of demons in Eusebius’cosmology clearly estab-lished, the fourth chapter began to examine how these ideas helpedto shape other areas of Eusebius’thought. This chapter looked at theinterplay between demonic influence and human free choice in Euse-bius’descriptions of wicked activity. It revealed the importance of theconcept ofπροαίρεσιςin Eusebius’understanding of moral responsi-bility and showed that Eusebius regarded the maintenance of highstandards of virtue as essential to securing salvation. Chapter 5 exam-ined the role of demons in Eusebius’understanding of history, chal-lenging the widespread scholarly view that Eusebius believed alldemonic power to have ceased with the incarnation. This showedthat Eusebius considered virtuous, exemplary Christian leadership—of both church and empire—to be essential in an ongoing struggleto resist demonic influence. Finally, Chapter 6 turned to examineEusebius’presentation of imperial sovereignty and thefigure of Con-stantine. It revealed that Eusebius was by no means unconditional inhis support for the Roman emperor; rather, he demanded a particularlyOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 18/8/2016, SPi"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"high standard of‘orthodox’piety from those wishing to be seen as thetrue ruler. Only in this way would the emperor be able to perform theessential role of leading his subjects on the journey towards salvation.Taken together, the conclusions of this study are striking,compelling us to reassess the common conclusion of scholars thatEusebius was complacently triumphalist in his vision of history andhis understanding of the position of the Christian church. At eachstage Eusebius has been revealed as far more cautious than his usualcharacterization suggests and deeply concerned about a continuingthreat to human salvation from malevolent demonic forces. Thisconcern led him to lay great weight on the importance of a virtuousChristian lifestyle in order to avoid the deceits of the demons andremain on the path to salvation. For Eusebius, complete Christiantriumph still lay in the future and was dependent upon the mainten-ance of virtue by all Christian souls.Of course, this work is not thefirst to reassess the traditionalcaricature of Eusebius as a servile imperial sycophant, who‘placed...his pen unconditionally at the service of the Emperor’.1Aaron Johnsonhas already presented us with a far more independent Eusebius, whoseambivalence about the role of the Roman Empire persisted even afterConstantine’sunification of east and west.2Michael Hollerich haslikewise suggested that the importance of high political concernsin shaping Eusebius’thought has been overemphasized in the scholar-ship, highlighting instead the importance of Eusebius’thinking on therole of the church.3In addition, F. S. Thielman has questioned thenotion of Eusebius’‘realized eschatology’.4In questioning this further, long-standing assumption aboutEusebius—that he should be characterized as a triumphal optimist—this study therefore has strong foundations in recent scholarship.Nevertheless, it leaves us with a picture of Eusebius that is strikinglydifferent even from that found in the most up-to-date work onEusebius.5It is a more nuanced picture, in which Eusebius’outlook1Quasten,Patrology, 319.

By focusing on Eusebius’ideas about demons, this studyhas revealed a new side to him. It has also highlighted several possibleavenues for future research.It has not been possible in the space available to examine fully thesources of and possible influences on Eusebius’ideas about demons.We have observed a range of possible influences, from the works ofPlato and Porphyry, to Jewish apocalyptic writings such as 1 Enoch,but further work on this might reveal more both about Eusebius’ownintellectual background, and about trends in Christian demonologyin the late third and early fourth centuries. Eusebius’profoundintellectual debt to Origen has often been highlighted by scholars;6recently, however, some have started to question the extent of Euse-bius’dependence on Origen and to focus instead on areas of differ-ence between the two writers.7Origen’s works contain a rich andintriguing demonology,8and a further, more detailed comparisonbetween the views of Origen and Eusebius on demons might thereforeoffer a valuable new perspective on this debate.Work on the reception of the Enochic story of the Watcher angelssuggests that, by the late third and early fourth centuries, this inter-pretation of Genesis 6:1–4 was falling out of favour among Christianwriters,9to be replaced by an interpretation in which the referencesto‘angels’were reinterpreted to describe pious humans, who hadstrayed from their virtuous lifestyle.10Lactantius is cited in thisscholarship as the last significant writer to adopt the angelic inter-pretation of Genesis 6,11yet, as we have seen,12hints of this story canalso be found in some of Eusebius’works. Examining the traces of this6See, most recently: Penland,‘The History of the Caesarean Present’, esp. 93;Ramelli,‘Origen, Eusebius,Apokatastasis, and Christology’.7For example: Corke-Webster,‘Mothers and Martyrdom’, 55; Hollerich,‘Euse-bius’Commentary on the Psalms’, 164; Zamagni,‘New Perspectives’, 243; Johnson,‘The Ends of Transfiguration’, 201–2.8For example: Orig.Cels. 1.6, 1.67, 2.51, 3.2, 3.29, 3.37, 4.32, 4.92–3, 7.6, 7.35,7.67–70, 8.30;de Princ. 3.2.1–7.

Overlook-ing these references to demons has led scholars in the past to form adistorted picture of Eusebius’ideas, overemphasizing the optimisticelements of his thought to the neglect of his concerns about themaintenance of high moral standards. Recognizing the significanceof Eusebius’views on the demonic has led us to revise our picture ofEusebius’overall outlook, illustrating the value of studying referencesto demons where they have previously been ignored. This bookthereby complements the recent work of Kalleres and MorwennaLudlow,15while also highlighting the gap that still remains in ourunderstanding of fourth-century Christian demonology. Furtherresearch on ideas about demons in the works of other urban Christianintellectuals of the period is still needed. Despite the efforts of Kalleresand Ludlow, there remains scope for much further work on Cappa-docian demonology, for instance.Finally, the exploration of Eusebius’ideas about agency and moralresponsibility in Chapter 4 has not only helped to clarify his thoughton this subject, but has also revealed a wider problem in scholarshipon early Christian ideas about agency. It is not only scholarship onEusebius that persists in using the terms‘will’and‘free will’withoutadequate definition. Rather, it is possible tofind scholars from variousbackgrounds—historical as well as theological—referring to an earlyChristian author’s ideas about‘free will’without fully acknowledgingthat ancient views on agency were expressed in a different vocabulary.13Kalleres,‘Demons and Divine Illumination’; Kalleres,City of Demons.14On Caesarea Maritima in this period, see: J.
