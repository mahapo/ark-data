She sat my brother and me down at the kitchen table, turned on a small TV, and told us to enjoy the movie. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending upon one’s movie preferences), my mother did not take the time to see what was scheduled on prime time that Saturday evening. My brother Jason and I, innocent, young children in the pre-cable era, began watching Th e Exorcist. Occasionally we would look at each other, seeking courage in stupid jokes about the little girl’s spinning head and oat-meal face. But we both knew we would be doomed to years of nightmares. Regan and Max von Sydow would haunt our dreams. More importantly, for better or for worse, my long journey to the publication of City of Demons began that night.Over the years I have spent researching, writing, rewriting, and fi nally now publishing City of Demons, I have tried to maintain a list of the teachers, mentors, colleagues, friends, and family members who have provided invaluable help as I have grappled with “that demon book.” Th e list has grown quite long, and I am now profoundly indebted to a number of truly exceptional people.

Th e project editor, Cindy Fulton, provided tre-mendous help in shepherding my project through its many stages of prolonged production. So too I must thank the two readers invited by the press to conduct the original review of the manuscript; I was incredibly lucky that they both agreed to read and comment upon the earlier manuscript; their thoughtful criticisms and overarching observations have shaped my subsequent thinking during my revi-sions, most certainly for the better. Marian Rogers, the copy editor at the press, possesses a sharp and tireless eye for detail as well as an intuitive sense of language; the manuscript improved immeasurably under her care. Most importantly, I owe a special and emphatic thank you to Eric Schmidt, who not only oversaw the book’s initial stages toward publication but also attended generously and selfl essly to the manuscript’s much more intensive process of resurrection. Eric’s sincere commitment to an author and her manuscript is utterly impressive.Pamela Morgan deserves a second acknowledgment page dedicated completely to her ceaseless labors in editing the manuscript, especially during the book’s fi nal six months prior to publication; I am sincerely grateful for her consummate edit-ing skills, of course; however, I deeply appreciated her enthusiasm for the book. Pamela has managed the impossible: transforming the arduous tasks of editing and proofreading into an enjoyable experience.In the process of my research, I took a few research trips to certain cities fea-tured in the book. I was able to fund this research through the two generous fel-lowships I received from the Hellman Foundation. In the summer of 2008 I received a fellowship to conduct research in Antakya (Antioch-on-the-Orontes), in the Hatay province in Turkey; I had the great fortune of traveling with Wendy Mayer and Tina Shepardson and enjoyed soaking in every bit of wisdom each had to off er as we attempted to conjure within our minds the movements of John Chrysostom and Libanius in the once great city. Conversations with Wendy and Tina during our summer trip and since have directly shaped this book; I cannot imagine writing about Antioch or John Chrysostom if I had not had the experi-ence of learning from the two of them in this unique way. In the summer of 2010, I received a second Hellman fellowship to return to Antakya, where I again joined Tina Shepardson for further travel. We quickly embarked upon a ten-day intensive tour through much of Syria—stretching from Aleppo to Damascus and Syria’s border with Hatay to Deir ez-Zor and the Euphrates. Undoubtedly, this trip would have been impossible if it had not been for Tina’s intrepid, adventurous nature, and her irrepressible optimism. Over the past few years, I have grown increasingly grateful to Tina for her encouragement during our trip, in light of the catastrophic violence and unrelenting war that has fallen upon and demolished so much of Syria and destroyed or uprooted so many among its populations. I can only hope"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Acknowledgments xithat the wonderful people we befriended during our travels have been able to remain safe.Drawing upon remaining funds from the Hellman fellowship, I had the oppor-tunity to travel briefl y to a very rainy Milan in the spring of 2011. My brother, Greg Kalleres, who is a playwright, joined me for the trip; despite the weather, Greg will-ingly spent his days walking with me in the streets of the oldest sections of the city. In the evenings, while drying in warm restaurants and eating delicious food, we turned enthusiastically to the task of reimagining details of the basilica crisis in the various places we visited. My brother has always had a talent for capturing and expressing the humor in almost any situation. Our few days getting lost and wet in Milan off ered him ideal material for our evening conversation over a bottle of wine. Th ank you, Greg, for transforming one of my more successful research trips into one of the funniest as well.Before drawing this to a close I would be remiss if I did not mention in greater detail a few people who have been especially important to the development and pub-lication of this book. Susanna Elm has supported this project since its inception—from the tremendously rich comments she made on my dissertation chapters to the equally rich comments she has off ered on chapters, papers, and articles since. I thank her for the support and encouragement she has readily off ered over the years since we met during her visit at Princeton. Catherine Chin’s shrewd intellect and cunning aca-demic imagination have inspired gratitude as well as jaw-dropping awe in a number of people, and I include myself among the jaw-dropping crowd. I owe Catherine a great deal for the discussions we have had pertaining to historiographical and herme-neutical problems in late antiquity—many of which have directly informed the larger theoretical arguments I am making in this book. To that end, I must also thank Cath-erine for the opportunity to participate in the Late Ancient Knowing workshop that she put together with Moulie Vidas at the University of California at Davis. David Frankfurter’s incredible scholarship has inspired the direction of my own since I was in graduate school. He has kindly read any chapter, article, or manuscript I have thrown his way and then somehow managed to return each piece quickly and with detailed and insightful comments. I will always be indebted to him for the intellectual support that he has off ered over the years, and I have come to depend upon his enthu-siasm for any and all things demonological; just as importantly (and, at times, more importantly), I owe David thanks for his tremendous sense of humor and friendship.I must also mention my gratitude for Peter Brown’s scholarship; this includes his contribution to the construction as well as critique of the world of late antiq-uity. Others have praised his work far more intelligently and elegantly than I ever could, and my own debt to Brown’s corpus will become clear in the introduction. I will only off er here that I am grateful to Peter Brown’s work for creating the pos-sibility for this study."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xii acknowledgmentsFinally, to the three most important people in my life, I off er my sincerest thanks and deepest apology.

While John has a good-sized audience for his homily on the fi rst day of the two-day festival at Antioch, he knows numbers will plummet the next. Many in his audience will happily join certain festivities that will be taking place in Daphne. John is aware of his competition:Choruses of men take over the suburb [Daphne] tomorrow. Oft en the sight of such choruses compels the person who wants to be sober into copying the same indecent behavior against their will. . . . [Th e devil] is present, summoned by the earthly songs, by the shameless words, by the demonic pageantry.2Within the frivolity of the dancing and singing, he recognizes demons laying their ambush for any who should pass by. Demonic possession is insidious and subtle: John describes what amounts to a behavioral conversion of the spectator in Daphne. A good Christian who watches and listens too long will through his own senses become enslaved to the activities on display. Th ose watching, regardless of whether they wish to remain “sober” in terms of their morality and senses of per-ception, will fall into a debauched and licentious state. John speaks in a manner that brings the mechanics of demonic penetration and corruption into close paral-lel with Hellenistic philosophical language in common usage at that time. In this case he adopts and adapts a predominantly materialistic understanding of Stoic theories of cognition and perception.3 IntroductionTh e City in Late AntiquityWhere Have All the Demons Gone?If you grab someone who’s demon-possessed and exhibiting manic behavior and take them into that holy tomb where the martyr’s remains lie, without a doubt you’ll see them jumping back and fl eeing. For they instantly leap right out of the front doors as if about to set foot on hot coals, and they don’t dare to look directly at the coffi n itself.1"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2 IntroductionJohn twists and reframes the details of what would have seemed to most to be an innocuous outdoor festival so that he may reveal the fi gure of the devil in the midst of it. Th e devil acts as a kind of quickening agent as he and his demons work to augment and aggravate a production of malevolent sense data in and around the male chorus. Sounds, smells, tastes, and textures pour forth from the chorus to engulf the Christian audience all too easily. Regardless of their prior sobriety, John’s Christians are compelled to turn their behavior toward a mode of depravity, ensuring their own condemnation.How can John possibly stop such an ambush? In what way can John and his loyal Christians slow the tide of the malevolent behavior overtaking Christian onlookers? To prevent congregants from attending this festival, John plots a dra-matic intervention:Tomorrow let’s occupy the gates [of Antioch] ahead of time, let’s keep a watch to the streets, let’s pull them down from their vehicles [as they travel to Daphne], women pulling women, men pulling men. Let’s bring them back here [to the martyr’s tomb].4Whether or not this action took place, what John proposes has the potential to develop into a violent confrontation. Into the midst of this invited chaos, the priest suggests bringing the relics from Julian’s martyrium. Julian’s relics are powerful, exorcistic objects that cause both the demon-possessed and the demoniac to fl ee instantaneously and to act erratically. John knows this behavior well. But so do those attending the festival. In fact, they may have understood or believed that even greater power than John advertises actually exists in Julian’s corporeal remains.John’s proposed confrontation against Christians who wish to attend the Daphne festival is an example of diabolization.5 In other words, he uses discourse and ritual to construct the undeniable reality of a spiritual war in which stronger Christians must engage in direct battle against demons who are using the male chorus to lure and corrupt weaker members of his congregation.Diabolization diff ers in subtle but essential ways from Jonathan Z. Smith’s con-ceptualization of the term “demonic.”6 As a locative category, the demonic func-tions in religious discourse to mark alterity, to emphasize otherness or monstros-ity; as such it is oft en deployed in an eff ort to measure and maintain a deliberate distance. However, John does not discuss demons primarily to force a distance between his listeners and the Daphne festival. Rather, he depicts frightening images of the demons’ powers to corrupt and invade the human body in order to galvanize Christians to act; he off ers a plan to move closer to the demons’ location and engage with them directly in spiritual warfare. Moreover, he provides a relia-ble antidemonic weapon—the relics of a known saint.By emphatically diabolizing Daphne in this sermon, John creates a situation for a spiritual warfare event. He does indeed intend the combustive moment of ritual confrontation—fl ashes of relics and shouts of exorcistic speech—to announce a"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 3divide that certainly opposes Christians and the male chorus; however, such a con-frontation will not separate or distance the two groups from each other. Instead John describes a boundary that comes into existence through the performance of ritual (exorcistic, apotropaic) contact and proximity. Whether or not such an event occurred is not the point. John’s vivid and emotive description of the encounter—the mere possibility of a clash—projects an image of the ritual attack into the minds of his listeners that will bind the two groups together in spiritual combat.City of Demons presents three richly detailed case studies of urban church lead-ers who are demonologists and active and innovative exorcists in the midst of dangerous, potentially violent religious confl icts dominating their cities. John Chrysostom of Antioch, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Ambrose of Milan have individu-ally been described as exemplary church fi gures, who Christianize their fourth-century cities in ways that contribute to progress rather than to decline. To that end, these three are oft en portrayed in scholarship following the conventional pro-fi le of the bishop: an educated, elite, civilized, and rational hero in a late antique historiographic narrative of the city’s late classical rise from its Gibbonian decline into superstition, irrational thinking, and magic. In contrast, in order to compli-cate current readings of ecclesiastical urban authority this book attends closely to these three leaders’ demonological discourses and related ritual descriptions (e.g., exorcistic, baptismal, apotropaic, divinatory) as they construct the identities of baptized Christian soldiers engaged in “spiritual warfare” in their respective cities; likewise it features the leaders’ manipulations of exorcistic authority in moments of urban crisis. City of Demons argues that each leader’s actions result in the mate-rial transformation (i.e., Christianization) of his respective urban environment.To recover this cultural history, we must provisionally accept a principle that structures the urban reality and the Christianizing processes of the post-Constantinian period: demons are an experiential part of the late antique city, materially impacting the lives not only of Christians, but of all who live there.7 Th e demonological plane of urban experience blends eff ortlessly through ritual prac-tice into the political, economic, social, and religious dimensions that comprise the chaotic and dynamic temperament of the late antique city.Furthermore, this book contends that scholars have largely neglected or misin-terpreted demons and the church’s active ritual stance against them. Since Edward Gibbon, the idea of material belief in and ritual engagement with demons—most especially in the city—has elicited a range of negative reactions from the modern interpreter. Some identify demonology as a sign of urban decay and civilization’s loss of rationality; others reduce the language of demons to metaphorical imagery; still others ignore the mention of demons altogether. In the study of ancient magic, a much diff erent paradigm exists. In an interpretive revolution that took place three to four decades ago, those who studied magical practice purposely adopted the category of “ritual power” to address the uneasy relationship between the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"4 Introductioncategories of magic and religion in the study of the ancient world.8 Consequently, a prevailing focus on ritual agency, instrumentality, and performance dominates and directs this fi eld of study. Th e questions revolving around the issue of personal belief in the reality of demons do not enter into the interpretation.However, the hard-learned lessons in the study of ancient magical texts have not yet been incorporated into the study of ecclesiastical power or the late antique city. Many scholars presume a reductive, anachronistic manner of reading supra-human or supernatural agency within the late antique environment; as a result they dismiss or downplay the manner in which such forces or powers materially impact the social, political, religious, and even economic dimensions of daily life. All too oft en, scholars neglect to consider how a shared perception of human-supernatural ritual interaction contributes materially to the processes of urban Christianization.To that end, this book follows a trend that has been emerging in the study of the late antique world more widely and in the study of demonology more specifi cally. Susan Ashbrook Harvey’s Scenting Salvation: Ancient Christianity and the Olfac-tory Imagination in 2006, followed in 2009 by Patricia Cox Miller’s Th e Corporeal Imagination: Signifying the Holy in Late Ancient Christianity, has fi rmly established a material trend within late antique scholarship in which the embodied and perceiving “Self ” is a central object of analysis in the interpretation of the late antique world.9 A similar directional turn has impacted the study of ancient and late antique demonologies more specifi cally: most prominently, David Brakke’s Demons and the Making of the Monk: Spiritual Combat in Early Christianity in 2006, as well Gregory A. Smith’s 2008 article “How Th in Is a Demon?” in the Jour-nal of Early Christian Studies, for example.10 As we endeavor to recover how belief in and perceived experience of human-demon interactions helps to shape the processes of Christianization of the late antique city, the material turn as well as the category of embodiment will guide many of our methodological and theoreti-cal choices—the fi rst of which, diabolization, provides a very eff ective means of bringing us much closer to understanding the tangibility of demons and the super-natural more generally.DIABOLIZATION, ENCHANTMENT, ANIMISM: ENLIVENING THE LATE ANTIQUE CITYIn Birgit Meyer’s ethnographic study of Pentecostalism and syncretism in Ghana, Translating the Devil: Religion and Modernity among the Ewe in Ghana, Meyer explains that diabolization is a Christian practice in both discourse and ritual.11 First, through sermons, hymns, confession, and prayer, baptized Christian clergy and laity generate a demonological discourse that identifi es all non-Christian, non-orthodox practices as the devil’s and therefore dangerous. Th e church then"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 5supports an aggressive ritual battle against all demonic threats in the urban sphere. Th is ritual activity increases the sense of the demonic and diabolic in the city, which in turn justifi es increased spiritual warfare to combat the devil.In the cases of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Milan, we will see that diabolization is oft en a central mechanism and strategy in the processes of Christianization within a religiously competitive and complex environment. Th is is especially the case during the early post-Constantinian era, when Christianity is fi ghting for a foot-hold in the public sphere, oft en through the construction of church buildings.In order to fully grasp diabolization as a powerful strategy of urban Christiani-zation, we have to recover the diff erence separating modernity and the late antique period: late antiquity is rooted in an enchanted worldview, and people possess a tangible sense of an animated environment. “Enchanted worldview” here refers to a pervasive belief in the supernatural forces and powers that enables people to ritually manipulate their environment in order to curse, attack, protect, empower, or engage in divination. Th e term “animated” connotes the specifi c kinds of forces and powers that populate this environment. In the case of Christianizing the late antique city, these entities are increasingly divided between the divine and the demonic, reorganizing what has been a much more pluralistic and polytheistic atmosphere. City of Demons argues that an enchanted perspective and an ani-mated atmosphere shape a person’s perception of reality in the late antique city and their behavior as political, socioeconomic, and cultural agents.Th is perspective of the late antique world is diffi cult, if not impossible, for many modern scholars to grasp. Several scholars who have investigated the late antique city have radically secularized and disenchanted the urban sphere. While there are studies of the city that speak to the subject of urban demonology, more oft en than not these interpretations reduce demons to a metaphorical expression or rhetori-cal strategy, transforming them into nothing more than an innocuous form of language. In our own eff ort to avoid reductive reading, in this study of ecclesiasti-cal authority and power in the post-Constantinian city we will attend to the category of ritual practice. By focusing closely upon the ritual activity that John, Cyril, and Ambrose describe, we will place demons and demon/human interac-tion in the foreground of our discussion of ecclesiastical authority and power in the post-Constantinian city. Th is study proposes that the increased production of church buildings provides the catalyst for an unprecedented amplifi cation and innovation in sacramental and ecclesiastical rituals. Constantine’s construc-tion projects lay the groundwork for a fanaticism for building—a “lithomania” that pervades the empire.12 Th rough the construction of grand new basilicas, martyria, and other Christian monuments within and just beyond the city walls, the rituals of baptism, exorcism, the Eucharist, and even the sign of the cross, for example, have a much wider reach into the urban sphere. Th e Lateran in Rome, the Great Church in Antioch, the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the Apostoleion in"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"6 IntroductionConstantinople—as sites of ritual experimentation and amplifi cation—force irrev-ocable shift s, both large and small, in society.13Th is period then off ers a tremendous opportunity for the reconceptualization of the place and purpose of sacramental rituals as well as a greater emphasis upon the power inherent in those rituals. And as we will see in our three case studies, sacramental ritual and ecclesiastical rituals in general take on a decidedly diaboliz-ing edge as Christian baptismal identity is carved out of the concept of the once demonic, now exorcised, body. Th rough diabolization, these rituals construct a new individual and congregational Christian identity in the midst of a demoni-cally dangerous city. A material and threatening demonology lies at the root of Christian consciousness beginning in the fourth century. Th rough the antide-monic power of the sacraments, clergy pass on to the baptized laity—the soldiers of Christ—this same power against demons and the diabolic.While we propose a cultural history of urban demonologies and spiritual war-fare, the actual interpretation of the evidence in the manner we propose is hardly a straightforward task. As with any history, various questions regarding historiog-raphy emerge. For example, in what ways have scholars unintentionally reduced or neglected any evidence of urban demonology and the supernatural? In what fol-lows, then, we will examine a few of the central scholarly perspectives that have participated in determining a modern view of demons in the late antique city and established the fundamental principles in the interpretation of the supernatural more generally: Edward Gibbon, Peter Brown, and a growing body of scholarship pertaining to episcopal/ecclesiastical authority in the post-Constantinan city.GIBBON AND THE AGE OF DECADENCETh roughout the nineteenth century and for most of the twentieth, Edward Gib-bon’s concept of an economic, social, and political decline strongly infl uenced the presiding historiographical narrative of the fall of the Roman Empire: a cultural decline in the second century followed by an economic crisis in the third century culminated inevitably in the eventual and complete ruin of the empire by the fi ft h. Gibbon’s depiction of post-Constantinian Christianity’s eff ect on the minds and rationality of the collective Roman population is worth quoting in full:Th e fame of the apostles and martyrs was gradually eclipsed by these recent and popular Anachorets; the Christian world fell prostrate before their shrines; and the miracles ascribed to their relics exceeded, at least in number and duration, the spiri-tual exploits of their lives. But the golden legend of their lives was embellished by the artful credulity of their interested brethren; and a believing age was easily persuaded, that the slightest caprice of an Egyptian or a Syrian monk had been suffi cient to interrupt the eternal laws of the universe. Th e favorites of Heaven were accustomed to cure inveterate diseases with a touch, a word, or a distant message; and to expel the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction 7most obstinate demons from the souls or bodies which they possessed. Th ey famil-iarly accosted, or imperiously commanded, lions and serpents of the desert; infused vegetation into a sapless trunk; suspended iron on the surface of the water; passed the Nile on the back of a crocodile, and refreshed themselves in a fi ery furnace. Th ese extravagant tales, which display the fi ction without the genius, of poetry, have seri-ously aff ected the reason, the faith, and the morals, of the Christians. Th eir credulity debased and vitiated the faculties of the mind; they corrupted the evidence of his-tory; and superstition gradually extinguished the hostile light of philosophy and sci-ence. Every mode of religious worship which had been practiced by the saints, every mysterious doctrine which they believed, was fortifi ed by the sanction of divine rev-elation, and all the manly virtues were oppressed by the servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks. If it be possible to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of Cicero and the sacred legend of Th eodoret, between the character of Cato and that of Simeon, we may appreciate the memorable revolution which was accom-plished in the Roman empire within a period of fi ve hundred years.14While Gibbon’s invective is harsh, unrelentingly so at times, he does not indict earliest Christianity (fi rst–second centuries); instead he focuses heavily upon later Christianity (third–fourth centuries). To that end, he draws important distinc-tions regarding the population’s mental disintegration that later church historians and classicists would maintain: Christian monks in this later period introduce superstitions and magical thinking that ensure a world overrun by a fear of the supernatural. Gibbon captures the problem quite well in his description of a Jeru-salem overrun by hermits in the fi ft h to sixth centuries:[Monks’] visions . . . have aff orded ample materials for supernatural history. It was their fi rm persuasion, that the air, which they breathed, was peopled with invisible enemies; with innumerable demons, who watched every occasion, and assumed every form, to terrify, and above all to tempt, their unguarded virtue. Th e imagina-tion, and even the senses, were deceived by the illusions of distempered fanaticism; and the hermit, whose midnight prayer was oppressed by involuntary slumber, might easily confound the phantoms of horror or delight, which had occupied his sleeping and his waking dreams.15Gibbon describes a corrupt, ritualistic, and even fantastical brand of Christianity that in his opinion had emerged in monastic communities in cities such as Jerusa-lem.16 For Gibbon, Christianity especially aft er Constantine had been overrun by a monastic fanaticism that (as the fi rst quote above puts it) “debased and vitiated the faculties of the mind: [it] corrupted the evidence of history; and superstition grad-ually extinguished the hostile light of philosophy and science.”Gibbon’s narrative of decline—and Christianity’s participation in that decline—determined the dominant interpretations of the city aft er his time.17 For Gibbon and his followers, the third century’s bruising fall into socioeconomic hardship followed by municipal and imperial political chaos facilitates the city’s demise."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8 IntroductionCities are then exposed to an incursion of aggressive charismatic religions in addi-tion to Christianity. Th e Roman civic sphere weakens, and the complete defunding of public urban cult or religio is soon to follow. Whatever remains of an urban-engineered civilization—through the civic and political (polis) institutions of state cults, municipal government, and Greco-Roman culture—descends into supersti-tion, irrationality, and the magical thinking of a rapacious Christianity and pre-sumably other religions (e.g., Manichaeism, Judaism, mystery religions).18 In the fourth century—alongside increasing barbarian invasions—a sudden rise of mag-ical practice overtakes the cities. Anti-magic persecutions of Constantius II and Valentinian I soon follow in the major cities of the empire.Later scholars’ portrayals of an irrevocable urban collapse in the late Roman period are consistent: Christianity spreads superstitious beliefs in demons and magical practice widely, and this overtakes and erases any remnant of Greek culture and rationality.19 An impenetrable dark age has already fallen heavily on the shoul-ders of those who populate the late Roman city by the fourth and fi ft h centuries.Aft er two hundred years of scholarship, certain “truisms” have thus become an indelible part of the historical record: aft er the third-century crisis and moving into the post-Constantinian era, the Roman Empire falls quickly. Borders weaken, and city walls crumble. Th e exoticism and depravity of Eastern religions and beliefs spreads unchecked. What little remains of Greco-Roman culture is crushed easily under the tyranny of the church and the invasion of barbarians; the new populations that emerge without the guidance of Greek philosophy and the civiliz-ing eff ects of state cult are morally and intellectually bereft as well as ethically compromised. Magical thinking, superstition, excessive ritualistic behavior, and the irrational fear of demons plague entire cities, towns, and villages.20 In fact, Gib-bon’s narrative of decline and its related fatalistic outlook of civic decadence has left its mark on most, if not all, of the histories of the later Roman Empire in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.21In the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, Anglo-American scholars began to speak of the historical period of “late antiquity,” a longue durée that stretched from varying points in the later Roman Empire (second to early fourth century) into the later Byzantine and medieval eras. Scholars such as Peter Brown, Glen Bowersock, and Oleg Grabar used this periodization to counter the Gibbonian rational view of civilization’s end as a result of the concomitant fall of the Roman Empire and the cities comprising that empire. Scholars of late antiquity developed an analytic cat-egory of “continuity and transformation” to encounter and critique the presiding categories of “decline and fall” that earlier interpreters had deployed to produce a historiographic narrative from the third century on.22Th e late antique perspective has been largely successful in shift ing perceptions of the post-Constantinian period. For his part, Peter Brown has provided a power-ful means of discussing the prickly concept of urban demonology in his article"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction 9“Sorcery, Demons, and the Rise of Christianity from Late Antiquity into the Mid-dle Ages.” He also takes direct and unerring aim at Gibbon’s narrative of the fall:Th e topic [of sorcery in late antiquity] has been harnessed to the problem of the “decadence” of the ancient world. Th e occult sciences have been studied as marking the nadir of the downward curve of Greek scientifi c rationalism; the rigmaroles of Gnostic demons, as a nadir in the decline of traditional Graeco-Roman religion; and the widespread opinion of historians, that a “terror of magic” was endemic in the fourth century A.D., is held to illustrate a nadir in the morale and culture of the Roman governing classes. It is assumed, therefore, that the “decadence” of the Later Roman Empire is illustrated by a sharp increase in sorcery beliefs. Th e reasons usu-ally given are of studious generality: the general misery and insecurity of the period; the confusion and decay of traditional religions; and more specifi cally for the fourth century A.D., the rise to power in the Roman state of a class of “semi-Christians,” whose new faith in Christ was overshadowed by a superstitious fear of demons.23Peter Brown’s “Sorcery, Demons and the Rise of Christianity” is quite well known—a proverbial gateway essay for late antique enthusiasts. As such, it is hardly necessary to summarize the essay itself. Instead, we will consider some rather signifi cant hermeneutical interventions within it.In the fourth century, Brown notes, Constantine’s Christianizing rule creates the right conditions wherein accusations of magic—a ritual practice involving demons—gain political traction: “Th e incidence of these accusations synchronizes with changes within the structure of the governing class: thus they reach a peak at a time of maximum uncertainty and confl ict in the ‘new’ society of the mid-fourth century.”24 Brown recognizes a parallel increase in sorcery accusations under Augustus in the fi rst century. Both centuries experience a tumultuous reshuffl ing of imperial and governmental institutions, which aff ects social hierarchies. In his study of sorcery accusations, Brown narrowly defi nes or categorizes magical prac-tice that involves demons and thus the phenomena of demons in general as a form of accusatory rhetoric—though admittedly a very powerful form of rhetoric. In doing so, he defl ects attention from the belittling characterizations of weak-minded Christians that we fi nd in scholarship from Gibbon to A. A. Barb. Both scholars, and many in between, eff ectively implanted within the modern imagina-tion a handful of evocatively vivid descriptions of that rising ruling class of “ ‘semi-Christians’ ” who were “overrun by a superstitious fear of demons.” Numerous scholars have contributed to the fortifi ed naturalization of Gibbon’s narrative of decline: Christianity’s superstitious, irrational and magical thinking that took root deeply and increasingly in the urban population ensured the demise of the Late Roman city. Brown overshadows this unfl attering portrait of the urban Christian elite. By focusing on demons as a feature within a rhetorical discourse, he projects a powerful and persuasive image of the new rising class of Christians, a classically educated urban elite who were incredibly savvy in navigating the traditional"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"10 Introductionrhetorical tactics of political competition. In the end, he manages to locate a rational, intelligible site for demons and demonic magic in the urban sphere—in the realm of a particular kind of rhetorical discourse rather than in ritual action.When we consider his 1971 article “Th e Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity,” we see that Brown provides a viable means for reading human-demon ritual practice or material interaction, especially the experience of demonic possession and exorcism, in the late antique world. In this article Brown portrays the holy man as perfectly suited to the rational role of “charismatic ombudsman.”25 Th e holy man is a fi gure who displays demonic mastery predominantly in a non-urban environment; thus, the holy man is the opposite in many ways from a per-son who holds ecclesiastical authority in an urban environment or someone whose authority is rooted in his position in the municipal, regional, or imperial govern-ment hierarchy. Th e holy man stands fi rmly outside the urban arena and therefore beyond the bounds (and bonds) of the kind of ecclesiastic episcopacy that main-tains the civilized status of the city: it is Simeon the Elder in the Syrian desert and not John Chrysostom in Antioch or Ambrose in Milan whom Brown sees as the key fi gure in the battle with demons in individualized spiritual combat and in expelling demons from inside the demon-possessed.Th rough these two articles, Peter Brown has enabled us to see demons, the demonic, and demonology in the late antique world in a new context. He has directed our gaze in precise ways in diff erent parts of that world, and he has done so without shadowing our sight with the concomitant lenses of irrationality, super-stition, and social decay that have conventionally accompanied discussion of demons in the late Roman Empire. In “Sorcery, Demons, and the Rise of Christi-anity,” Brown locates the demonic within the city by containing it as a rhetorical feature within the practice of sorcery accusation. Consequently, then, his focus is on the accusation as an evolving technique within the rhetoric of secular, political power and how that power is well suited to the Christianizing sociopolitical hier-archies of the city: in other words, demons as discourse are an important, if not integral, factor in the city’s shift ing political infrastructure. In this manner, Brown has endeavored to free the late antique or late Roman city from its earlier unilateral reputation as a decadent and decayed sphere of magical thinking and superstitious paranoia. In “Th e Rise and Function of the Holy Man,” Brown situates demons in a much diff erent way: demonic possession, the violent ritual display of exorcism, curses, as well as personalized spiritual warfare—in other words the actual belief in and ritual engagement with demons and the supernatural more generally—all occur outside the city. In the Egyptian desert, in the Syrian wilderness, far removed from any ecclesiastical institution, the non-urban holy man openly and violently displays ritual power over demons.While Peter Brown provides the means to discuss demons in the late antique world, however, he does so at a certain cost. An unspoken, perhaps unrealized,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction 11juxtaposition of these two articles over the years has led to the formation of two very diff erent trajectories in the subsequent study of late antique Christian demon-ology. Scholars have quite productively presumed or imagined the holy man’s rit-ual interactions with demons for the most part outside the city walls in deserts, forests, and desolate mountains. Th e collective study of the holy man’s engagement with demons outside the civilizing eff ects of the city has produced a sense of the non-urban environment as enchanted and full of animistic forces. By contrast, scholars who study the city and especially those who consider episcopal/ecclesias-tical authority within the city view demons reductively: demons are a language of alterity or an othering rhetoric. By viewing demons in this manner, scholars pre-serve a disenchanted and secularized interpretation of both the city and the church in late antiquity.Th e incongruity in these two trajectories is the inevitable result of the late antique scholar’s desire to loosen the late Roman city as well as ecclesiastical insti-tutions within the city from Gibbon’s portrayal of decline. Peter Brown’s brilliant article “Sorcery, Demons, and the Rise of Christianity” began the process of urban rehabilitation. He locates a legitimate, rational, and even politically sophisticated space for the existence of the demonic in the late antique city. His article represents only the fi rst step, however. By defi ning demons as a form of discourse, Brown situates demons in a manner legible to the late antique world, certainly, but he also repackages demons in a manner that aligns with modern standards of rational perception—a construct or category that fi ts naturally within the disenchanted, secular, and desacralized city. In light of late antiquity’s enchanted and animated worldview, though, we have to reconsider and adjust our understanding of the places, spaces, and categories where demons are legible, rational, and familiar phe-nomena to someone who lives in a late antique city. City of Demons will endeavor to take this second step. Before moving forward, then, we must acquire a better sense of the extent to which the disenchanted, secular perspective continues to direct scholarly interpretations of the late antique city and episcopal/ecclesiastical leadership within that city.THE LATE ANTIQUE CITYScholarship has returned to the late antique city with renewed vigor since the late 1990s.26 Growing interest in urban archaeology, the concept of urban transforma-tion, and the material processes of Christianization have inspired a publishing del-uge over the past three decades.27 Our own interest leads us to the fi gure of the bishop and the role he has played in this collection of scholarship.28 Th e urban bishop oft en appears as a civilized and rational fi gure—or at the very least a capa-ble administrator. He oft en appears as an important cultural touchstone, incorpo-rating the best of Stoic moral philosophy and rhetorical skill in his interaction with"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"12 Introductionother municipal and imperial elites. He stands as a fi gure of continuity with ancient Roman civil, municipal, and senatorial authority; and thus he becomes the means of rationalizing and civilizing the city. In other words, scholarship presents the bishop in this post-Constantinian city as a fi gure of secular and sociopolitical authority—far removed from the religious and ritual aspects of his identity. Th e fi gure of the bishop has become a powerful means of rescuing the city from its earlier depictions as a site of moral, intellectual, and cultural decadence.In the inaugural issue of the Journal of Late Antiquity, Cliff ord Ando succinctly captures this problem: “Th e rise of the bishop and the infl uence of episcopal courts . . . now oft en are framed as problems in the history of civic offi ces or civil law; they thereby are reduced to mere analogs of the classical institutions they ultimately replaced.”29 As a result, religion and ritual have to a great extent fallen out of the equation in interpreting both the bishop and the city. Claudia Rapp off ers a similar assessment from a slightly diff erent angle. In her 2005 monograph, Holy Bishops in Late Antiquity, she argues quite persuasively that the secularized, urban bishop is the unfortunate casualty of a deeply embedded and ideologically fl awed historio-graphical narrative that has misdirected our understanding of ecclesiastical and episcopal power and authority.30 She shrewdly observes and deconstructs the interpretive problems inherent in earlier scholars’ all-too-simple chronological division of the church into pre-and post-Constantinian periods—i.e., from an egalitarian, spirit-fi lled, charismatic Christian community beginning in the apos-tolic period, to a secularized, desacralized episcopal fi gure embroiled in managing the late antique city:[Th is highlights] the reign of Constantine as a radical turning point when the ideal-ized, charismatic age of early Christianity came to an end and the church became tainted through its exposure to the empire, a decline that is thought to be accompa-nied, as if in a seesaw, by the rise of the bishops.31Rapp categorically rejects this chronological division, and instead claims correctly that it falsely casts the two eras into opposing portraits of ecclesiastical authority—religious charismatic power versus secular institutional authority. Rapp notes how Max Weber’s category of charisma informs this dichotomy. Th ough she does not elaborate, Weber’s defi nition of charisma warrants further consideration. In Weber’s words: “[Th e charismatic person] is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifi cally excep-tional powers or qualities.”32 He directly opposes charismatic power to institutional authority, a dichotomy he maps onto two ideal types: “the prophet” as charismatic, who stands in opposition to “the priest,” whose identity rests upon his institutional authority and other secular traits such as teaching and moral and ethical counsel. One can easily see how Weber’s paired dichotomies align closely with the chrono-logical division that Rapp criticizes."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction 13All too oft en the narrative portraying urban episcopal power has played out on the fl attened, horizontal terrain of strictly human, social interaction; the city appears as a disenchanted space bereft of most spiritual beings—demons, angels, or indeed any supernatural entity that might suggest the city’s descent once again into superstitious and irrational thinking. Scholars describe bishops and priests as keeping their eyes trained steadily ahead on the business of social interaction: preaching, moral instruction, socioeconomic endeavors, the political roles of municipal government, and colonizing certain aspects of the court system. How-ever, if we listen to Peter Brown, we must shift our gaze to fully capture all the processes of Christianization in late antiquity:Let us fi rst look up to the heavens. . . . Belief in an everlasting universe, at once inhabited and governed by intertwined hierarchies of divine beings and their ethe-real ministers, was an article of faith for most late classical persons. . . . It is this col-lective representation of the divine world that we must install in the back of our minds when we read the late antique evidence. If we do not do so, this evidence will appear to us as crisp and as clear-cut, but as unreal, as a lunar landscape from which the subtle shades imparted by an atmosphere have been drained. Of all the collective representations that had to move, through the slow redrawing of the map of the divine world at the behest of Christian theologians and preachers, the ancient repre-sentation of the mundus was the one that shift ed with the slowness of a glacier.33Th is is not to suggest that scholars have failed to consider the supernatural in their construction of the late antique urban environment. Studies do describe church leaders’ engagement with both the demonic and the divine; however, such interactions take place within the safe confi nes of their churches. Th ese interpreta-tions contain the supernatural in the sacramental rituals of baptism and the Eucharist, for instance, that take place inside the church, and therefore they cut the rituals off and separate their meaning and effi cacy from the rest of the city.34 More oft en than not scholars approach sacramental and other ecclesiastical practices from the perspective of symbolic ritual: in other words, rituals communicate new socioreligious boundaries in the language of demonic versus divine.Late antique interventions into earlier interpretations of the city have produced tremendous benefi ts: the city has almost fully rebounded as an object of study freed from its earlier Gibbonian captivity as tangible proof of decline and decay. Nonetheless, the irrationality, superstition, overwrought religiosity, and magical thinking that Gibbon, A. H. Jones, or even A. A. Barb have emphasized in their depictions of the decayed and dying city have lingered in the collective imagina-tion of recent scholars. As scholars have recovered the survival and growth of a number of late antique cities, certain interpreters have presumed a narrowly modern set of criteria when describing city and civic success—a disenchanted, desacralized, and secularized urban environment. In studies examining a bishop’s"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"14 Introductioncontribution to urban vitality, depictions of that episcopal fi gure’s economic, polit-ical, sociocultural, and—to a lesser extent—religious and liturgical spheres of action and interaction dominate.Th ese interpretations of the late antique city are far from wrong. In fact, City of Demons would not be possible without this collection of scholarship. Rather, the collective interpretation as it currently stands is incomplete. Th e purpose here is not to argue against or disagree with recent urban studies of the late antique world. Instead this book seeks to recover what has been overlooked—the enchanted and animistic dimensions of the late antique city—and asks, How does a consideration of these dimensions broaden and deepen our understanding of urban episcopal and ecclesiastical power? How does a consideration of the church’s diabolization practices aff ect our current understanding of Christianization in the late antique city?When approaching our task, we must overcome our identity as Western modern subjects—products of a post-Cartesian, post-Enlightenment world and worldview. Ironically, we have entered an era of cultural theory that recognizes the enchanted and animistic parts of Western (post)modernity;35 nonetheless as scholars—and as embodied human beings—it takes a good deal of cautious self-refl ection to divest ourselves of our modern perspective before embarking on the task of assuming the perspective of others. Th ere is a residual discomfort in examining the city as an animistic, enchanted space. How might we come to consistently view a city as an environment where the population’s daily ritual interaction with supernatural forces—including demons—is a normal, rational activity? Before we can turn to our project, we must turn to ourselves as our fi nal interpretive obstacle. A brief look at the categories of enchantment, disenchantment, and animism in the construc-tion of the idea of Western modernity will hopefully help us to keep a strong hold over our own perspective and worldview throughout this study.ENTZAUBERUNG/DISENCHANTMENT/ANIMISMMax Weber fi rst introduced Entzauberung in his 1917 lecture entitled “Science as a Vo c a t i o n .”36 Situated in Weber’s thought as a causal principle of civilization’s progress, Entzauberung literally translates to “removing the magic.” Th is has been an important component within a larger discussion involving Western moderni-ty’s growth and hegemony. Weber locates Entzauberung in science’s revelation that “there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. Th is means that the world is disenchanted. One no longer has recourse to magical means in order to master or implore the spirits.”37 Earlier in Th e Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, We b e r ’s Entzauberung gains a decisively Christian valence in its appearance in the Calvinist subject who relentlessly strips himself of all magical modes (i.e., Catholic"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction 15ritualism) in his eff orts toward attaining salvation. As such, Weber portrays this Berufsmensch born in an ascetic Protestant milieu as the fi rst iteration of a person evolving toward a rational individual capable of advancing capitalist progress. Fol-lowing the Weberian formulation, subsequent thinkers have identifi ed several events that have been “emphatic disenchantment[s].”38 Cumulatively, these events have given birth to the modern, Western conceptualizations of the body, the sub-ject, and personhood. Th ey have also supported an assumed superiority of the West. Th us City of Demons, especially in the consideration of demonic possession and exorcism, will attend to the disparities between the late antique body and the modern with particular care.In this approach (including the work of some scholars prior to Weber), Entzau-berung and disenchantment also indicate a radical cosmological shift marking the beginning of a population’s rise out of primitivity and on the evolving path of progress; that is, the possibility of a superior Western civilization can only fi nd stable root following the expulsion of spirits, forces, energies, powers, demons, and angels that previously spanned the immense space between a human being and his/her god. Entzauberung, then, emerges as one of many theories to identify decisive historical points that chart a progressive move from enchantment to dis-enchantment in the Western world. Th ose following Weber’s account have explored the role played by the radical asceticism within Calvinism. Others have argued that this push toward modernity fi nds a more precise origin in Protestant antisac-ramental discourse.39 Still others have probed the chronological expanse of the Enlightenment, during which several thinkers perform irreversible inoculations against pandemic magical thinking.40René Descartes, for example, following the skeptical traditions of the sixteenth century, departs from the Aristotelian view of “the natural world governed by sympathies and correspondences to deploy a mechanistic view of nature.”41 Mechanical operations without consciousness now commandeer space long occu-pied by spirits, demons, and other such forces. Likewise, Descartes’s ontological discrimination between mind (res cogitans) and body (res extensa) eff ects a simple, but powerful, incision that severs the supernatural world from the natural and thus frees an already emergent modern man from what has been consistently viewed as crippling bouts of superstitious thinking. Like an interlinked chain of causal events, Descartes refl ects mechanistic philosophical attitudes that also fi nd sociopolitical expression in works such as Hobbes’s Leviathan—a treatise that situ-ates demons and witchcraft as mere metaphor at best, delusions at worst. Hobbes decries those of an earlier age—Greeks and Jews especially—who believed the devil and demons to be not “phantasms, that is, idols of the brain, but things real, and independent on the fancy.”42 In both philosophers, this position coheres with contemporary works of social liberalism that were likewise ridding the world and man’s mind of such ill-intended beings and allowing space for the conceptual"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"16 Introductionseeds of social contract theory to germinate and evolve into an actual practice of collective self-government.With such tidal shift s in the seventeenth century, it is with little surprise that the eighteenth century witnesses a replacement of the theological perspective by the scientifi c in the task of comprehending cosmological mysteries. Th e world of physical scientists, especially within astronomical theory, secularizes nature so that it transforms into what Randall Styers has called “a deterministic system gov-erned by universal laws”; in this view “all forms of demonic and occult causation were eff ectively expelled from the world.”43 As Michael Buckley once remarked, Cartesian natural philosophy eff ectively “banished the gods from the world”; later eighteenth-century adjustments to Newtonian mechanical physics, particularly those elements that relate to the view of divinity, banish God himself from the realm of experiential life altogether—ushering in an age of atheism.44 In any event, in accord with this authoritative linear chronology of Western progress, several scholars have since pronounced that by the dawn of the nineteenth century the world has fi nally been disenchanted, with fundamental irrevocability. As such, Western civilization, native home to an esteemed vanguard of modernity, has long illustrated material advance over the rest of the non-Western, enchanted world.So much of our own identity as modern, Western, and therefore “civilized” human beings rests upon our refl exive rejection of the supernatural, the cosmo-logical, the divine, and the demonic as irrational—superstitious survivals of our own mental infancy. Th e disenchanted over and above the enchanted defi nes the essence of our progressed modern civilization. Whether “modernity” is rooted in actual and empirical moments, movements, and developments in the past few cen-turies, or fi nds anchor instead in a powerful discourse that constructs and per-suades us of the reality of modernity, is a matter of heated debate in an array of critical disciplines. While we do not have space to enter into the debate here, it is in any event a discussion that is marginal to this study. What is important to bear in mind, however, is the discipline involved in consistently inhabiting or embody-ing a worldview so foreign to our own as we interpret the late antique material. In City of Demons late antique conceptualizations of the supernatural, the cosmos, the divine, and the demonic guide our interpretation of ecclesiastical power in the late antique cities of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Milan.When examining the construction (or fabrication) of the modern Western sub-ject, we must also consider the construction and consequent denigration of ani-mism. Th e two-volume tome Primitive Culture by Sir Edward Tylor contributes substantially to this project.45 Tylor is strongly attracted to social Darwinism in his ethnographic study of humankind. In his totalizing survey of human culture, a defi nitive structure informs his anthropology; as Margaret T. Hodgen has observed, Tylor envisions a “spatial arrangement of [human] forms . . . converted"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction 17into an historical, developmental or evolutionary series.”46 Th e distance between modern Western man and his “savage” ancestor or neighbor can be measured in the birth and progress of science, but also in the birth and progress of religion. In view of both trajectories, Tylor posits a view of modern man associated with higher (Protestantized) religion, not only with a logical, scientifi c worldview. In addition, and perhaps more signifi cant than his portrait of modern man, Tylor establishes an image of the primitive and then savage ancestor (or contemporary neighbor in colonialist territories) as the lowest and most degraded human being, and then saddles that fi gure with animistic beliefs.In two volumes, Tylor manages to describe each end of human history rather thickly. In his characterization of the civilized and advanced human being, he describes belief in an advanced religion, located in England, which expresses mod-est piety in private devotion; religious affi liation of this kind has shed its earlier crude elements such as one fi nds in the excessive ritual practice of the kind of Catholicism still practiced in little villages in Germany. Tylor’s evolved religion is a secular, remote phenomenon that informs his idea of the superior capability of the Western European subject in order to clear space for the economic, political, and juridical projects of social liberalism. It hardly surprises that Tylor’s view refl ects his own religious beliefs as well as the worldview of his English peers.Animism, by contrast, is the principal mark of the lower and unevolved human being. Tylor provides a simple defi nition for animism: it is a belief in spirits that is cultivated by a misinterpretation of dreams, phantasms, shadows, and the like. Animism begins as a view of man’s soul as spirit; this expands quickly into a per-ception of a world pervaded by spirits, many of which are hostile. Belief in spirits is the prevailing principle that guides the primitive’s philosophy and his under-standing of the world; it generates rampant ritualism in society; it shades ambigu-ously into the realm of magic. Animistic thinking, in all its aspects, serves as a marker of the degenerate, primitive other. Tylor locates the expression of base ani-mism in three places: (1) buried deep within the beginnings of a very long Western history; (2) alive and well in contemporary non-Western geographies of the colo-nialist imagination; and fi nally, to Tylor’s dismay, (3) surviving in an otherwise civilized Europe and America—for instance, the inexplicable fascination with spiritualism that had taken hold of many of his peers.Revolving tightly around Tylor’s animism are the dichotomies of enchantment/ disenchantment and irrational/rational—all of these are homologous to the pri-mary division between primitive and civilized human beings. Tylor most eff ec-tively craft s this dichotomy between the primitive savage and the civilized modern in his ethnography of spiritual or demonic possession and expulsion. In his dis-cussion of animism, he introduces the “savage theory of daemoniacal possession and obsession” as the “most genuine and rational in its proper place in [the begin-ning of ] man’s intellectual history”.47"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"18 IntroductionTylor’s fi rst, graphic description of demonic possession lingers vividly in the background as one reads fi ft een pages of additional examples. It is worth quoting in full:Th e possessed man, tossed and shaken in fever, pained and wrenched as though some live creature were tearing or twisting him within, pining as though it were devouring his vitals day by day, rationally fi nds a personal spiritual cause for his suf-ferings. . . . Especially when the mysterious unseen power throws him helpless on the ground, jerks and writhes him in convulsions, makes him leap upon the bystanders with a giant’s strength and a wild beast’s ferocity, impels him, with distorted face and frantic gesture, and voice not his own nor seemingly even human, to pour forth wild incoherent ravings, or with thought and eloquence beyond his sober faculties to command, to counsel, to foretell—such a one seems to those who watch him, and even to himself, to have become the mere instrument of a spirit which has seized him or entered into him, a possessing demon in whose personality the patient believes so implicitly that he oft en imagines a personal name for it, which it can declare when it speaks in its own voice and character through his organs of speech; at last, quitting the medium’s spent and jaded body, the intruding spirit departs as it came.48Th is model of “daemoniacal possession and obsession” helped to shape the Darwinian principles of anthropological interpretation at that time and for a long period thereaft er, but Tylor’s views have never been limited to anthropological circles. Rather, as many recent scholars of religion and anthropology have argued, the theorization of animism is part of a much larger discourse of modernity in the nineteenth and early twentieth century and thus has helped provide the founda-tion for belief in the moral, intellectual, and religious superiority of the hegemonic We s t .E. E. Evans-Pritchard long ago observed that early armchair anthropologists such as Tylor were limited in their study to an unorganized collection of what captured the curiosity of those who had the opportunity to observe other popula-tions; merchants, missionaries, and travelers recorded their impressions of the so-called primitive and savage peoples beyond Western Europe’s civilizing borders. Before ethnographic practice was commonplace in anthropology, those who actu-ally met and studied these individuals only took time to record the “curious, crude, and sensational.”49 Th ey were drawn to what they regarded as the “superstitions, the occult and mysterious . . . the mystical.”50 Descriptions of demon possession were an archival favorite for both anthropologists and laity; the missionary set in Africa and southeast Asia was frequently responsible for the production of these records.Possession passages enlivened the anthropologist’s as well as the untrained observer’s sense of a primitive and savage people overwhelmed and literally brought to their knees by animistic beliefs. Such people—at the bottom of the social evolu-tionary scale—could hardly possess rationality or intellectual ability; instead they"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Introduction 19were overrun by an emotional temperament. Discussion of these materials moved beyond the limited arena of anthropological or socioscientifi c academia, spilling over into public lecture halls and salons of the cultural elite. Recently scholars of religion and anthropology have examined how an early modern discourse involv-ing primitive man’s belief in magic, demonic possession, and an animated environ-ment signifi cantly shaped the larger discourse of modernity and Western hegem-ony.51 Social Darwinism (and animism’s place within it) and Western modernity’s constructed superiority over the so-called primitive or savage character of the other have fueled ideologically based self-defi nition from the early modern period. Th e West’s benevolent off er of various forms of conversion (e.g., colonization, bap-tism, education) for the “primitive, irrational, and magical-thinking” non-Western population introduced an ethical, even divine, justifi cation for Europe’s interven-tions throughout the non-Western world for quite some time.Th e project of modernity—and the place of animism and enchantment within it—was and is vast and pervasive. Is it any wonder that we ourselves might wish to closely consider our own perceptions of the late antique world before attempting to retrieve the worldview of those who actually lived in late antiquity?City of Demons is divided into three parts; each part contains a case study of an individual late antique city—Antioch, Jerusalem, and Milan, in that order. Part One and Part Two each contain three chapters, and thus these two parts are paral-lel in structure to each other. Th e fi rst chapter in each part explores the animistic and enchanted aspects of the city itself (Antioch, chapter 1, and Jerusalem, chapter 4); the second chapters in Part One and Part Two follow the ecclesiastical leaders’ strategies of diabolization (John Chrysostom, chapter 2, and Cyril of Jerusalem, chapter 5). Th ese chapters also present the church leaders’ ways of reforming demon-possessed/oppressed baptizands into baptized and exorcizing soldiers of Christ. In chapters 2 and 5, we draw upon the leaders’ baptismal lectures for most of our information.52 Th e Catecheses ad illuminandos of both John Chrysostom and Cyril of Jerusalem describe the semi-isolated state of the Lenten catechume-nate. Th is lasts several weeks and consists of intense scriptural and creedal instruc-tion as well as ritual preparation for the fi nal baptismal rituals during Easter week-end.53 Daily exorcisms are an important part of this process.54 In fact, City of Demons examines the daily exorcisms as part of the overriding diabolization project underway in these city’s churches.Th e third and fi nal chapter for each part (chapters 3 and 6) selects and explores a particular crisis that is perceived as a threat by the Nicene communities in Anti-och and Jerusalem, respectively. In each case, we closely examine—and ultimately compare—the ways in which John and Cyril employ ritual strategies of diaboliza-tion (particularly the ritual of exorcism) as a means of resituating the apparent crisis in the framework of spiritual warfare. In a sense, then, this third chapter of"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"20 Introductionboth Parts One and Two functions as a test of the evidence presented in the fi rst two chapters of each part. How are Antioch and Jerusalem considered enchanted animistic environments? In what ways do John and Cyril—and their respective clergy and congregations—innovate ritually to diabolize their urban environ-ments? How do they develop spiritual warfare discourse and practice that speak directly to contours of their own city’s enchanted environment and animistic atmosphere?Part Th ree, covering Ambrose and Milan, consists of only one chapter. In this, the fi nal chapter of the book, we consider a series of well-known events that stretch from an ill-fated imperial request in 386 for the use of basilicas to a reburial of the bones of the Nicene martyrs Protasius and Gervasius. As a measure of control in this chapter, we will maintain a tight, narrow focus on the role that ritual—specifi cally sacramental ritual—plays in transforming an ecclesiastical confl ict into spiritual warfare. Th e chapter also presents the conclusion for the book as a whole. In fact, many of the observations made in reference to the basilica crisis and relic discovery in Milan serve a second function of pulling together the over-arching themes of the book.In Antioch, in the early fall of 386 CE and 387 CE a depletion of congregants during the Jewish High Holidays fuels John Chrysostom’s strong diabolizing rhet-oric against Judaizers and, indeed, all Jewish ritual and Jews themselves. In fact, John’s diabolizing rhetoric ties Antioch’s Jews to the Christ killers of the crucifi x-ion; from that day forth, according to John, a Jew, condemned and damned, can only be a hollow, soulless vessel—the perfect vehicle for a demon determined to lure weak Christians into Judaizing practice, rituals, and festivals.In Jerusalem, Cyril draws upon local and literary apocalyptic eschatological traditions depicting the Holy City. Baptism empowers Christians to see through to the true Jerusalem of the crucifi xion and the cross despite the devil’s visual distrac-tions, such as Constantine’s basilica emphasizing the resurrection and the tomb. As the bishop fi ghts to reclaim Jerusalem’s true holiness, Cyril notes a growing diabolism encroaching in the city: outside Acacian infl uences demonically possess the Jerusalemite church’s weaker members, and later Cyril glimpses images of the antichrist in Julian’s plans to rebuild the Jewish temple.In Milan in the spring of 386 CE, Ambrose fi nds himself immersed in a battle against the Arian imperial family over church possession. Under his instruction, baptized soldiers of Christ assume a role as exorcistic protectors; they fi ght to cleanse the dangerously porous Milanese churches from the demonic/Arian plague. Later that summer Ambrose “miraculously” discovers relics, the supposed bones of Protasius and Gervasius; these naturally become essential exorcistic tools in the ongoing Nicene/Arian battle to lay claim to churches as well as to the city itself.To be clear, I intend this book not as a rejection of the late antique hermeneuti-cal approach but as a critical intervention. To that end, I frame this study as"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction 21a hermeneutical addition to or enhancement of our current scholarship in a number of areas: insights into the city in the post-Constantinian era, into the urban church, and into ecclesiastical power and authority. My desire is to add to the conversation about the late antique church and city a reconsidered scholarship that investigates religion in a manner inclusive of the enchanted worldview and related animisms that characterize the late antique period itself.In tackling this problem our study thus directly addresses neglected mecha-nisms and overlooked dimensions of urban transition and transformation (i.e., Christianization) in the post-Constantinian period. It does so from a radically dif-ferent standpoint—a perspective that in fact may be uncomfortable to some—by accepting and portraying the late antique culture of suprahuman presence and power. More to the point, this study of the post-Constantinian urban church spe-cifi cally acknowledges the shared, embodied knowledge of demons that existed at that time.In taking such a direct, unequivocal approach to the supernatural and charis-matic, we take on the question of urban and religious violence from an entirely diff erent point of view. What happens when church leadership diabolizes its sur-rounding animistic environment? What occurs when Christians are baptized into and trained for a new holy, charismatic identity as soldiers of Christ and initiated into the larger material reality of spiritual warfare that is believed to hold the city captive? Does Christian agency extend only to the fi gurative and imaginative? Or do Christian soldiers, acting as charismatic exorcists, bring the battle directly to a physical encounter with the demons possessing Jews, Greeks, and other Christians?Th is introduction intentionally ends with a series of questions. Th is study aims primarily to open up and expand our capacity to ask and to interrogate. Most importantly, the book will, I hope, inspire others to search freely and widely into the diff erent supernatural and demonic populations found throughout the beliefs of the late antique world, and to consider how human ritual interaction with such populations impacts the social, political, cultural, and economic dimensions of day-to-day life. Consequently, then, City of Demons, as a cultural history of demons in late antiquity, is fundamentally and necessarily a historiographic form rooted in experimental inquiry. Its methodology relies as much upon the conjuring magic of the imagination as the anchoring capacity of material and textual evidence. Per-haps, with a bit of luck, the mixture of scholarly interpretation and imagination will inspire others to travel a similar path, in order to chart the enchanted and animated world of late antique demonologies."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"part oneJohn Chrysostom and Antioch"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"25A fever could be a frightening, life-threatening ordeal in late antiquity. Luckily, Antioch off ered the sick an overwhelming array of cures.1 A person, particularly of means, would fi rst visit any number of physicians (Gk. iatroi; L. medici) available in a city as large as Antioch.2 He or she might then seek the services of a divinatory expert (Gk. mantis) to inquire aft er his or her future recovery,3 or travel beyond the city gates to one of the holy men in the caves of Mount Silpius for a wondrous cure.4 A person might also pray at one of the many martyr shrines outside the city, or healing might be obtained from incubation near one of the caves called called Matrona found in association with many of the very ancient synagogues in Daphne.5 Rumors circulated that incantations were off ered by rabbis within the synagogues also, or itinerant healers might sell a healing incantation for a price.6 Th ere were also old drunken women selling their healing amulets. Nurses in homes all over the city were well versed in folk remedies; an old woman healer (Gk. graus; L. anus) might come into the home off ering incantations with a power-ful mixture of Christian and non-Christian divine names.7Antioch’s citizens engaged in tightly entwined healing and ritual practices, drawing upon a wide variety of powers that gave them comfort. Whether they were Greek, Jewish, or Christian, religious identity was superfl uous in most aspects of day-to-day existence. John Chrysostom, however, did not rest easily with the spiritual ambiguity and dangers such ritual pursuits invited into the larger Chris-tian community. Should someone fall victim to a fever, he was quite clear: Chris-tian prayer and ecclesiastical ritual were the only options. All other ritual cures were demonic deceptions. In this he was absolute.

Chapter 1 off ers a tour of Antioch and Daphne that attends closely to the enchanted worldview and the animistic environments as well as John Chrysostom’s related ritual practice. Inhabitants practice a wide range of rituals, and he insists that participation in non-Christian practices produces dangerous spiritual entanglements; in some cases demonic possession may result. While John utilizes the demonization of non-Christian activity, he is far more dependent upon diabolization. In his sermons, and perhaps even more so through his regulation of sacramental practice, Chrysostom transforms the spiritual ambiguity or abun-dance of Antioch into an active and predatory anti-Nicene evil.9Chapter 2 then pieces together several diff erent demonological narratives that exist in his corpus of sermons. John also puts together powerful Nicene images in balance against his depictions of demonic predation. In his baptismal sermons as well as elsewhere he also projects persuasive images of sacramental and ecclesiasti-cal ritual. He promotes these practices as eff ective weapons of spiritual warfare against a growing diabolic power.Chapter 3 fi nally introduces our demonic case study or demonic crisis in John Chrysostom’s Antioch and Daphne. As discussed in the introduction, John’s harsh views against Jews and Judaizers during the High Holidays and Pesach provide material for our consideration of his strategies and tactics of diabolization.Before traveling straight on to Antioch, however, we must fi rst pause to con-sider a few details regarding interpretive language and concepts. Th is kind of study calls for the development of individualized tools to facilitate our examination of the strategies of diabolization in the late antique city. Th is pertains to Antioch, of course, but also to Jerusalem and Milan.A CULTURAL OF SUPRAHUMAN PRESENCE AND RITUAL IN THE LATE ANTIQUE CITYAntioch’s religiously and culturally complex urban environment creates a form of ritualized identity all but inscrutable to our modern, post-Reformation eyes. Isabella Sandwell has recently recaptured a vital sense of how integral ritual prac-tice was to religious identity in Antioch at the time. Signifi cantly, she denies the actuality—and, in fact, desirability—of discrete religious identity in Roman impe-rial society; instead, “practices were shared by people whatever their religious alle-giances.”10 Drawing from Bourdieu’s notion of habitus and his concept of embod-ied ritual dispositions, Sandwell builds an argument for Greco-Roman society’s fl uid play between religious diff erence and religious allegiance; she claims that a"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 27fi nely tuned sense of ritual action allows Antiochenes to feel “right” in the confl ict-ing microenvironments of their social world: “[Antiochenes] would have ingrained in them unspoken dispositions and habits relating to tactful and appropriate ways of dealing with this sensitive situation.”11 She invokes the concept of instinctive ritual play to build her discussion of Antioch’s religious pluralism. In this way, Antioch’s religiously pluralistic society diff used tensions. Once we reach the fourth century, Christian leaders, Chrysostom included, begin developing and imposing ideological rules and clear-cut categories in the construction of religious identity. Th e priest attempts to enforce strict, rule-bound structures upon those accus-tomed to a fl uid approach to religious allegiance/diff erence. He meets with confl ict and inevitable failures, as Sandwell has observed.Sandwell’s use of Bourdieu is smart and insightful, and her argument is extremely persuasive. However, her predominant methodology, i.e., sociology, foreshortens our view into the late antique urban environment to a modern (disenchanted) understanding of Antioch in the 380s. Likewise, I propose that her primary evi-dence—i.e., Chrysostom’s preaching, as she defi nes it, “an explicit, linguistic, ideo-logical, rule-based medium”—eclipses our view into the full and possible range of the elements that inform religious identity in this period, and, moreover, into the construction of that identity in the midst of religious confl ict, change, and vio-lence.12 Sandwell focuses upon the discursive aspects of John’s preaching relation-ship with his various audiences. Th is is perfectly in keeping with the standards of scholarly trends in late antique scholarship; when interpreting issues of religious violence, many have adopted a perspective that attends closely—perhaps exclu-sively—to the visible realm and the horizontal plane of social interaction.Th is study relies wholeheartedly upon the sturdy foundations of Sandwell’s Bourdieusian reading. Still, one cannot help but wonder when reading an inter-pretation that cleaves closely to the visible ground of social interaction, Is it pos-sible that something imagined could be missed? Perhaps we should consider the vague, ostensibly empty, but hardly depopulated, late antique spaces between the abandoned temples and the itinerant ritual agents who invoke those temples’ once-venerated deities. What kinds of suprahuman populations loiter in these charged locations aft er the cult has been minimized or dies out? If we do not con-sider the imagined suprahuman, supernatural forces that people’s rituals invoke, bind, expel, and exorcise as they move in their environment, we are missing subtle expressions of anger that could easily escalate into violence. We also miss the cos-mological shift s that the rituals produce—changes in the heavens that link to and participate in religious transformations on the ground.It is important, then, to note the directions City of Demons will take. Th is chap-ter, and indeed the book as a whole, will ascend from the horizontal and move beyond the visible to pierce through to the enchanted and animistic world of late antiquity. Consequently, in this and the next chapters, ritual practice draws our"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"28 John Chrysostom and Antiochfocus more deliberately and directly than perhaps we see in the work of Sandwell and others who have studied these cities. We examine people’s ritual encounters with locally perceived cosmological and spiritual powers. In this way, we consider the development of the people’s animistic “dispositions and habits,” their habitus, their embodied knowledge of how to act ritually in a wide variety of situations in Antioch and Daphne. We also attend to the generative quality of ritual. Beyond the ability to inculcate or engender a worldview, ritual practice creates and manufac-tures a vivid sense of the supernatural. Ritual sustains demonic and other animis-tic powers; such ritual action also conjures invisible orders that stretch up from the earthly and sublunar realms into the heavenly.Sandwell’s model lucidly accounts for the religious identity of the Greek, Jew, and Christian—a process of construction not beginning until the fourth century. City of Demons supplements her consideration by asking how Antioch’s ritual prac-tices complement or complicate the processes of religious identity construction. Demons engendered and sustained by ritual practice fi ll and overlap “the betwixt and between” of these religious identities. In other words, while the demons of ritual practice may clarify religious diff erences, they may just as easily cultivate an ambiguity blurring the lines delineating Greek, Jewish, and Christian diff erence.13Antioch has been portrayed as a city of enduring religious pluralism, ambigu-ity, and, fi nally, tolerance. Undoubtedly there is truth in all such characterizations. Th at said, in using a term such as “religious pluralism,” scholars favor the socio-logical at the expense of the cosmological and the spiritual—not to mention the enchanted and animistic. Such an interpretive perspective only scratches the sur-face of the interplay of religious identities in Antioch, leaving untouched the ani-mistic forces thought to direct the diverse collection of ritual practices. Of course this view ignores the animated forces fueling and fueled by these novel and incipi-ent movements toward religious diff erence and identity. To understand how the enchanted environment and animistic forces inform religions and parse their dif-ferences in an urban environment, to grasp a sense of the rituals that draw the supernatural into one’s experience of religious identity, we must adjust our view.It is time that we venture past the Cartesian divide and temporarily leave aside the familiar disenchanted categories of modern western interpretation.Th e city’s late antique inhabitants arrange themselves according to socioeco-nomic status, gender, ethnicity—as well as religious affi liation(s): despite these and other expressions of diff erence, however, the people as a whole participate in a loosely shared understanding of Antioch’s supernatural powers.14 In seeking pro-tection, wealth, power, healing, erotic love, and a host of other issues, inhabitants develop a sophisticated ritual agility. Instinctively they know how to leverage generations of ritual knowledge and demons connected to those rituals. For so many it is almost impossible to surrender the embodied ritual and animistic knowledge—even for a golden-mouthed priest."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 29Th eir ritual sense and animistic sensibility—drawing again here on Bourdieu’s idea of disposition or habitus—is a materially embedded and thus embodied form of knowledge. In their very manner of ritually moving through the city day to day, inhabitants continue to feed Antioch’s enduring religious pluralism. Building upon this chapter, chapter 2 will examine the dimensional depth of the clash and confl ict between the inhabitants and John Chrysostom regarding the singular issue of religious identity.In contrast to the inhabitants of Antioch’s day-to-day life that this chapter reviews, we will uncover in chapter 2 a John Chrysostom who sets himself apart from others through asceticism. Th rough his earlier ascetic practice he constructs a diff erently ordered animistic environment and enchanted worldview around himself. Before his ordination, his antidemonic struggles in mind and body carve out a clear, dualistic understanding of the divine opposing the demonic. As a prac-ticing monk within the city, he produces a sense of the demonic that is much more extreme than that of the congregants whom he will eventually lead.15 Upon becom-ing a priest, he attempts to inculcate his congregations in this spiritual warfare: diabolizing images in his sermons regulate a severely agonistic worldview. So too he involves his baptized in the heat of this battle. Th rough the preparation and initiation of ecclesiastical ritual practice and the sacraments, they transform into soldiers of Christ. For John the title is certainly not metaphorical.David Brakke has shown quite clearly that Stoic theories of cognition and per-ception play a central role in the ascetic, antidemonic battles and spiritual-warfare worldview of Evagrian and Egyptian monasticism.16 Th e embodied character of the soul/mind in both Stoic models of knowing off ers a philosophical and psychologi-cal (and especially physiological) foundation to delineate clearly how the demon’s body and the monk’s body touch and battle in spiritual warfare. Gregory A. Smith correctly argues that when our Christian sources describe the material nature of the demon’s body, they do not intend a metaphorical or psychological meaning. Th ough demons may be invisible, and though they may possess subtle bodies, they do indeed possess bodies in the late antique worldview. Th us there exists a material continuity between the demonic body and the soul.17 I have discussed elsewhere the complexity of the spiritual-warfare ideology within the ascetic and ritual writ-ings of Gregory of Nazianzus, for instance, once again involving Stoic theories of cognition and perception.18 Th ere as here I argue that the material (pneumatic) quality of the connectivity between human and demon informs late antique theo-rizations of demonic possession and the effi cacy of exorcism.One of the goals of City of Demons is to demonstrate the degree to which John Chrysostom’s demonology is very much of his time, corresponding, for example, to that of Antony, Origen, Evagrius, and Gregory of Nazianzus not only in com-plexity and philosophical sophistication, but also in conceptualization of material-ity and embodiment. What has separated John’s demonology from that of other"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"30 John Chrysostom and Antiochchurch fathers so far has been the diff erence in context and genre. While Antony’s letters and Evagrius’s treatises are addressed to other monks, and therefore they present their demonology in a fairly straightforward manner, John’s demonology comes to us through the thick and contorted lens of a preacher’s rhetoric molded to an elite audience trained (and expecting) to hear an orator’s speech.Consequently, scholars have understandably focused on the pastoral relations between priest and audience, and many have argued that John spoke to audiences who were generally unlikely to follow his ethical and antidemonic admonishments pertaining to their non-Christian behavior in Antioch. More to the point, though, it is impossible to recover audience reaction. In our approach to Chrysostom, we take the somewhat contrasting view that one thing is clear in John’s demonology: aft er several years spent in rigorous asceticism within an urban environment, John engages actively with the crowded, culturally rich city not only as its Nicene priest but crucially as one of its exorcists. When John therefore assumes ecclesiastical duties, he does not abandon the harsh, dualistic worldview he cultivated during those years alone wrapped in ascetic practice and spiritual warfare. Instead he brings it with him and to his congregants in his sermons, but most especially in ritual. In his sermons he projects his demonology through carefully constructed images. Th ese images also convey a precise understanding of ritual effi cacy—both demonic and divine ritual and power in Antioch.As we move forward through City of Demons, we will see how well the model proposed here for John Chrysostom, including its ancillary elements, also works to explain Cyril’s charismatic hold over Jerusalem and its Christians and fi nally Ambrose’s control of Milan and his own embattled congregation. Now, however, a tour of Antioch follows.INITIAL IMPRESSIONS OF AN ANIMATED AND ANIMATE CITYIn many respects our tour resembles those provided in other studies: a survey of the city’s buildings, statuary, shrines, monuments, and spaces.19 Here, however, close attention is paid to the wide variety of rituals animating Antioch’s urban environment. In fact, the rituals are allowed to paint the picture of the city and its supernatural populations (divinities, deities, and demons). In using the word “ani-mating” here, I intend two meanings. Th e fi rst meaning is familiar from our dis-cussion in the introduction: in the late antique world people believe that they engage with supernatural/cosmological entities, forces, and powers in a material manner through ritual practice and speech. For them, in their time, these super-natural powers are not bodiless, immaterial absolutes or metaphorical symbols; instead they are material, enlivening, and part of local topographies, communities, and histories. Th e second intended meaning is somewhat more complex: it refers"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 31to the manner in which rituals literally move individuals and groups in and around the spaces and places of the city. Th rough that movement they give life or animat-ing power(s) to a space and the objects or monuments in that space. It is a multi-dimensional defi nition of the phrase animating power that directs the mode of cultural and historical interpretation in this and the following chapters.Despite its neglect in scholarship—that is, until recently—Antioch stands as the gravitational center of the eastern Mediterranean world in antiquity from the time of its founding by Seleucus I in the early third century BCE.20 Th is is certainly evident in the fourth century CE as Antioch draws a number of emperors, and their courts and armies, to its territory and becomes caught up in the border tension between the Roman and Persian empires. More importantly perhaps, during the Roman imperial period all eastern roads run through Antioch. It is linked with Alexandretta to the northwest, Laodicea to the southwest, and Beroea to the northeast. Some thirty kil-ometers southwest of Antioch is Seleucia, a port city off ering Antioch vital access to the rest of the empire. As Libanius proudly claims, multiple races and ethnicities have chosen this city as their own.21 Th ese populations feed Antioch’s trade and market-places. Merchants traveling through from as far away as China bring riches to the main Roman street, which stretches along the spine of Mount Silpius.Th e roads bring another kind of traveler to Antioch as well. Itinerant goētes, magoi, divinatory experts (Gk. manteis), theurgic practitioners, and Chaldaei from the farthest reaches of both the Roman and the Persian empires continually move through the city, introducing new forms of ritual practices and bringing promises of cosmological power.22 Diverse charismatic fi gures circulate around the many religious monuments that crowd Antioch’s topography: ancient Greek, Roman, Syrian, and Persian temples, synagogues, churches of opposing theologi-cal factions, martyr tombs, and Jewish incubatory caves in Daphne, as well as the caves of Christian holy men in the foothills of Mount Silpius.We should imagine a city pulsating with spiritual powers. People who live in Antioch intuitively understand the city’s diverse array of invisible forces capable of infl icting harm or off ering healing—as well as much else in between. In other words, through the straightforward activity of urban living—and thus the ordeal of day-to-day survival—inhabitants naturally gain improvisational ritual knowl-edge of their loosely shared, localized understanding of invisible forces.ENDURING TEMPLES AND LINGERING DIVINITIESOver the centuries, temples, shrines, and religious statuary cluster thickly along the streets of Antioch, projecting a complicated mixture of Greco-Roman, Egyp-tian, Persian, and Syrian divinity. As Sarolta A. Takács has astutely observed, “As one of the most important economic centers and one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire, Antioch was home to many gods.”23 Th is is certainly the case in"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"32 John Chrysostom and Antiochthe Hellenistic period through the early imperial period. It will be several centu-ries aft er Constantine before most of the city’s multilayered polytheism is fi nally removed. By the end of the fourth century, very little has been done to erase pagan-ism from the architectural face of Antioch or Daphne, and this raises an important question. As long as temples and other religious structures continue to stand and are a part of people’s sensory environment in and beyond the city, are the divine powers that these monuments once actively represented ever really absent from the collective experience or memory of the city’s inhabitants? Can we defi nitively say that the deities associated with the remaining structures fail to leave a trace in the ritual practices of Antioch’s inhabitants and, therefore, do not aff ect their cos-mological understanding or religious experiences?While Antioch may have off ered a warm and inviting home to many gods over the centuries, we need to ask what kind of residency the city and its buildings and spaces provide to what forms of deity by the late fourth and fi ft h centuries. How can the religious topography shape a people’s sense of their animistic environment? To settle this question we must answer a few others fi rst. What religious structures still stand in Antioch by the late fourth and fi ft h centuries? What is the condition of those structures? What rituals and festivals still occur in and beyond the city at that time? What kinds of opportunities are there for ritual innovation? Or, more to the point, what new forms of ritual engagement with invisible, suprahuman powers begin to emerge, even as older, more traditional forms of cult start to decline?24Very little polytheistic architecture is destroyed in the fourth century.25 In late 362 the statue of Apollo in Daphne burns down in a fi re.26 Th e temple of Nemesis in Daphne’s Olympic stadium is destroyed in 387.27 Libanius derides the monks who have been terrifying the surrounding countryside and tearing down several temples and shrines, but he also notes that they have left untouched the temples of Zeus, Tyche/Calliope, Dionysus, and Athena in the city itself.28 Sandwell observes that anti-pagan vandalism undoubtedly occurs during Gallus’s residence as well as just aft er the emperor Julian’s departure; however, Sandwell adds, our sources’ silence suggests that the damage is negligible.29 Th ese few instances of destruction hardly make a diff erence in Antioch’s impressive collection of Greco-Roman reli-gious architecture. Actually, a variety of factors assures the preservation of many temples. Economic crises of the third century and the growing centralization and bureaucratization of imperial power produce a curial class in the fourth century less engaged in civic euergetism.Th roughout the fourth century the number of abandoned temples increases. However, rather than destroying derelict structures, civic authorities repurpose them. In 355 the temple of the Muses becomes the residence and headquarters of the fi rst Comes Orientalis, Felicianus.30 In 359, the temple of Tyche is stripped and transformed into a classroom.31 In 386, the temple of Dionysus, on the side of Mount Silpius, is used by the governor Tisamenus as a tribunal.32 In Pro templis,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 33Libanius himself makes a plea in which he suggests that abandoned temples be repurposed as houses for tax collectors.33Finally, we will be remiss if we overlook Julian’s contribution to temple preserva-tion. While his eff orts to restore the temple of Apollo in Daphne meet with unmit-igated disaster, it is not altogether destroyed. A fi re that strikes the temple precinct consumes the statue but leaves the temple walls standing. Th is outcome raises the interesting question of what kind of smaller divinatory practices associated with the god Apollo may have emerged aft er the wreckage. However, Julian has better luck with the temple of Artemis in Antioch. He orders the temple’s refurbishment; his predecessor Constantius II had ordered the complete removal of its decoration.Th e ancient temples of Zeus, Artemis, Dionysus, and Calliope continue to stand as formidable monuments and immovable objects in Antioch’s religious landscape for quite some time. Th ey direct the fl ow of the population as it moves through the streets. Th e buildings continue to have an impact on the ritual imagi-nation of Antioch’s inhabitants. Libanius captures the enticing power such build-ings possess in his description of Antioch’s temple of the Nymphs, which “attracts every eye with its gleaming marble, its coloured pillars, its glistening paintings and its wealth of springs amidst the colonnades.”34 Divine statuary also has a decisive eff ect. As people pass by the statue of Tyche or the Mouseion, they are reminded of the city’s long history of divine patronage. Antioch is full of monuments to divini-ties, which capture the attention of inhabitants of the city and fi ll their imagina-tions. Laura Nasrallah has noted insightfully how religious discourse emerges in the “lived experience and practices in the spaces of the world.”35 In “our interac-tions with the images and architecture which surround us, by our movements through cities and other spaces,” as Nasrallah well observes, our ideas of religious piety, justice, true divinity, and correct ritual practice take shape.36Th is is the case in Antioch, as we will see. As the people move around and through the city’s imposing religious remains, these structures—regardless of their state of decay—still continue to imprint their ritual and religious lives. Depending on the “particularities of [their] bodies . . . [some] can walk with confi dence while others walk in fear, in danger” surrounded by such monumentality.37 In the late fourth century, Christians who have long walked in fear and Greeks who have walked even longer with confi dence and entitlement in the public environs of Antioch are in the process of experiencing a radical shift and exchange of positions that only a few generations earlier would have been inconceivable. Still, this is not a period signaling the death of polytheism. Far from it, in fact. Polytheistic prac-tice and thought tied to actual monuments continue in forms that evolve with the changing political, social, and religious conditions of Antioch.While the priesthoods, festivals, and sacrifi ces that once enlivened Antioch’s temples of Zeus, Dionysus, and Athena, and Daphne’s temples of Apollo and Nem-esis, have disappeared, not all of the temples have as yet fallen silent. Libanius and"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"34 John Chrysostom and AntiochJohn Chrysostom describe a city in which a number of festivals have continued to “[function] as temporal markers and also [have] shaped the daily and yearly rou-tines . . . [and thus] forged comprehension of the self within the community and helped link the community as a whole to its shared past, present, and future.”38 Kalends, the popular New Year’s festival, is celebrated across the empire.39 It takes place in Antioch for three days, leaving John to face a congregation that is, as Jaclyn Maxwell has vividly remarked, “at risk of being completely overwhelmed by the tyranny of ancient custom.”40 In the early morning hours, people drink unmixed wine from libation bowls; at night they participate in bawdy choruses, invade the craft smen’s quarters, knock at people’s doors, and engage in jesting. People deco-rate their workshops and compete for the best display of lighted lamps; market-places crop up everywhere, since gift exchange is an important part of the festival. According to Libanius, people come from great distances to exchange gift s. During this brief respite from normal life an atmosphere of generosity and liberality spreads throughout the social hierarchy. On New Year’s Day master and servant play dice together; speech rights are given equally to all. Schoolboys do not need to fear their teachers; slaves are given freedom; servants can enjoy their leisure as well. Th e courts are closed; and even prisoners fi nd a measure of respite. People view the festival as an auspicious time to read omens so that they may discern future pros-pects for the upcoming year. On the third and fi nal day of the festival, chariot races are held and enthusiastically attended by the city’s inhabitants.41Given Antioch’s love of the hippodrome, Kalends is not the only festival to include horse races. In fact, several cultic festivals, which persist well into the fourth century and even longer, feature these events. Th e hippodrome is a site of creative cosmological and animistic production. Ammianus Marcellinus (Res Gestae) describes charioteers who mix together various poisons (L. venefi cii) in the hopes of improving their chances in the races; some charioteers’ ambitious intentions were likely to have had more gruesome ends, however, including the mandating of their beheading.42 More intriguing, for our purposes, is a handful of curse tablets invoking deities and demonic beings that are among those discovered in the Princeton excavations in 1934–35. While dating to a later period in Antioch’s history (the period of the circus factions in the fi ft h–sixth century), the tablets warrant consideration in light of the long history of both magic and the hippo-drome in Antioch. One spell draws our particular attention; it includes an invoca-tion to Hecate and other underworld forces and asks that the infernal deities demolish and overturn the blue faction. Th is text holds a fascination for us, because Diocletian builds an underground shrine to Hecate among other improvements at Daphne at the beginning of the fourth century. Devotees to the goddess of magic and witchcraft as well as the moon can reach the subterranean space by descend-ing 365 steps; in fact, the remarkable descent seems to function to create an inten-tional, ritualized gesture toward the underworld and thus the practices of mystical"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 35if not magical practice.43 Should we assume a link between the hippodrome curse text(s) naming Hecate with the Hecate shrine at Daphne? While an answer to this question will most likely forever elude us, it is worth asking nevertheless.Descriptions of the Antiochene Kalends provide a wealth of detail. By contrast, we have very little information about most of the other festivals that take place in the city and Daphne. Th erefore it is diffi cult, if not impossible, to know what kind of grip these events have on citizens. In fact, only a few passages regarding the Olympic games and the Maiumas festival stand out in the meager collection of testimony for the rest of Antioch’s festivals. Th e Olympic games take place every four years in Antioch, and we know that they occur in 386. Th e games, which begin in the time of Claudius, draw crowds and competitors from around the Roman Empire. Festivities last for forty-fi ve days during July and August. Com-modus builds a complex of buildings in Antioch to prepare for the Olympic games; he also has a grand temple built to Olympian Zeus, patron of the games. Com-modus also orders extensive changes to Daphne, where he orders that competitors receive their laurel crowns; his improvements include a covered running track (xystos) near the refurbished Daphne temple of Athena. He builds a stadium at Daphne as well.44 Much later, Diocletian uses the occasion of the Olympic games to strengthen his dynasty and religious revival. He turns to Daphne and rebuilds the stadium, in which he constructs temples to Olympian Zeus as well as Nemesis; the latter is destroyed in 387. Malalas also informs us that during this refurbish-ment, Diocletian rebuilds the temple of Apollo in Daphne.45Th ese construction projects renew interest in Daphne as a religious site. In addition to serving as a locus for the Olympics, Daphne is the location of a popu-lar, old Syrian cult festival known as the Maiumas, which occurs every three years in May.46 It lasts thirty days and is dedicated to Aphrodite, Dionysus, and Artemis. Th e Maiumas features a salacious nocturnal stage show, and the festival’s popular-ity brings Christian and non-Christian moralists together in protest against its lewd content; as a result the festival is banned several times in the late fourth cen-tury as well as in the fi ft h.47 As already noted in the introduction, John Chrysos-tom expresses extreme displeasure at how easily a lewd performance in Daphne entices Christians away from the celebration at the martyr Julian’s cult site. It is debatable whether or not John is referring to the Maiumas, but at the very least he describes young male mimes who dance salaciously, and the spectacle seems to have ecstatic elements quite close to those of the Maiumas.Soon aft er Kalends is the festival of Poseidon, which, like the Olympic games and other festivals, also features horse races.48 Th e festival of Artemis takes place in May near her temple on the eastern side of town and involves a very popular boxing competition.49 Th e festival of Calliope follows in early summer. Both theat-rical shows and horse races take place during this popular festival: in fact, horse races may have continued in the festival until the late fourth century.50"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"36 John Chrysostom and AntiochTh e festival of Adonis occurs on July 17–18.51 In late summer and early autumn, at the beginning of the wine harvest, a festival celebrates the god Dionysus.52 In addi-tion, in the early fall the Jewish High Holidays are celebrated in Antioch. John Chrysostom’s Adversus Judaeos homilies depict how the festivals and fasts draw par-ticipants from beyond the Jewish and Greek populations. Synagogue culture attracts Christians who are interested not only in Jewish ritual observance but also in exeget-ical practice. Th is is all quite vexing for John Chrysostom, as we will see in chapter 3.Th ere is no question that the civic cults and organized festivals are in an irre-versible decline in John’s time. Th at said, vivid and abrupt fl ashes of a marginalized polytheism can still burst through to the center of city life, bringing an experience of an enchanted atmosphere that can unexpectedly tear bodies away from their everyday routines. More surprising still, perhaps, is who authorized these polytheistic reprieves. In the immediate aft ermath of Julian’s polytheism, the post-Julianic years do not see much in the way of reversal; for example, Valens does little to change the resurgence of Greek cult. Instead, in his eff ort to bedevil and anger Nicene Christians, if we are to believe Th eodoret of Cyrrhus, Valens allows Dionysus to enjoy his ecstatic rites in the public sphere. Th e god holds court in the open, visible spaces of the city as “bacchantes were running through the middle of the forum.”53 Does the decline of a temple cult and so then the potential destruc-tion or abandonment of that cult’s religious monuments mean that the associated divinity no longer off ers any ritual power to people?As long as something of their temples, shrines, and religious statuary remains, we follow the view that the respective divinities continue to project their presence and potency into the inhabitants’ daily religious consciousness and ritual experi-ences. Antioch’s religious structures fi rmly anchor a shared memory of a robust, animated polytheism into the late fourth and early fi ft h centuries. In their day-to-day encounters with declining temples, aging divine statuary, and other religious monuments, Antioch’s various populations maintain some kind of charismatic relationship with these monuments. New and evolving conceptualizations of the animistic powers tied to these structures begin to emerge. Concurrently, divergent forms of ritual expression also emerge. Our problem is methodological: How and where might we fi nd traces of such ritual expression?It is not diffi cult to imagine the emergence of Christian ritual practice at these sites. Christians most certainly are instructed to make the sign of the cross and participate in other apotropaic gestures as they pass these demonic haunts.54 We may also imagine monks performing exorcisms outside of these structures—perhaps the same “black-robed tribe who ate more than anyone” and terrorized the surrounding countryside according to Libanius.55 However, Peter Brown ques-tions the quick leap to identifying Libanius’s monks as actual monks. He argues persuasively that the so-called monks may rather have been among the lower eco-nomic registers of the Christian community who were determined to secure their"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 37Christian piety through collective acts of anti-pagan violence. Moreover, Brown claims episcopal hands are never far from complicity in these actions:Th roughout the empire, bishops and laymen alike remained determined that if Christianity were to triumph through their authority, they alone should have the monopoly of the use of force.56In his discussion of the topography of religion in late antiquity, Jonathan Z. Smith invites us to imagine other rituals emerging in the shadows of Antioch’s ancient temples or at the feet of a divinity’s statue. Smith describes a fundamental shift from religion practiced in a specifi c place—temple cult and domestic reli-gion—to “religions of anywhere.”57 Especially as the public, political, unifying aspect of civic cult begin to decline in the third and fourth centuries, religious rituals are no longer tethered exclusively to cultic tradition, temple precincts, and priestly hierarchies. Rituals of sacrifi ce, divination, incubation, oneiromancy, divinization, initiation, and healing (remedia), for example, fall into vague, shift ing spaces between decaying temples and cluttered domiciles. Itinerant wonderworkers, priests, magicians, soothsayers, and, we should add, Antioch’s lay citizenry become important manufacturers of late antique religion as Smith has defi ned it elsewhere: that is, “manifold techniques, both communal and individual, by which men and women . . . sought to gain access to, or avoidance of, culturally imagined divine power by culturally patterned means.”58 Th ese men and women have the potential to become ritual power brokers in an unsettling era of cosmological disorder and uncertainty but also advantageous supernatural abundance. It seems that the pos-sibilities are endless. Th is is especially so in Antioch, where the architectural sur-roundings preserve the cultural memory of the city’s spiritual entities. Th is state continues for quite some time, overwhelming—or subversively undermining—any possibility for a comfortably settled ecclesiastical and Christian topography.Approaching the endurance of polytheism in this manner, let us turn to a col-lection of temples where public cultic activity has visibly, appreciably, diminished; we will consider briefl y how the monuments—in this case, all dedicated to a single god—continue to shape the ritual imaginations and practices and the enchanted worldviews of diff erent communities in Antioch. Can these religious monuments be anchoring in historical time and place what Smith has defi ned as the shift from locative religion to “religions of anywhere”? In their day-to-day habits and rou-tines, people come to possess an embodied awareness of their religious architec-tural surroundings. Th e accumulated sensations (sights, smells, sounds, touches, tastes, and, we should add, emotions as well) weave easily into shared memories of the robust ritual existence in Antioch, a past life of festivals, celebrations, and sacrifi ces in honor of the gods and goddesses.Even though a few temples have been repurposed for secular use, and a few more completely abandoned, the majority remain standing; temple cult activity"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"38 John Chrysostom and Antiochwill continue in many of these structures into the late 380s. In the simple activity of existing and walking around the city, people (regardless of their religious desig-nation as Greek, Christian, or Jew) naturally develop a raw, sensory connection to their city’s polytheism well into the later fourth and early fi ft h centuries. Th rough-out their existence, temples and their divine powers are part of the urban topogra-phy: the buildings bear a religious presence that spreads through and beyond the city. Gods, goddesses, and lesser powers live in statuary and temple decoration; they live within mythologies that the theater performs and countless mosaics fea-ture in domestic and public spaces.Zeus, Apollo, Calliope, and the like may have received eviction notices that force them ostensibly from their ancient homes, but they never abandon Antioch. Th ey ignite the ritual imaginations of those who pass by their abandoned or destroyed temples, or hear their stories in the theater, or walk over their mosaics; a sense of residual dynameis continues. In new forms of divination, healing, and protective spells, ritual agents continue to perform mythological content that sus-tains a kind of polytheism in Antioch. In the process of cultivating such rituals, the supernatural and animistic orders are transformed, reordered, and remade.59 In fact, all inhabitants in Antioch participate in innovative and imaginative approaches to ritual practice. In a broader sense, as long as the religious structure exists in some form people can imprint its religious meaning and content upon smaller, movable ritual practices in the city.So then the closure, destruction, conversion, or abandonment of a temple is not tantamount to the end of its deity (and its various dynameis); rather, the invisible powers endure in the innovative and expanding practice of smaller rituals.60 In other words, deities continue to exist as well as transform in Smith’s “religions of anywhere.”In what follows, we will consider a single dream. Th e dream primarily revolves around acts of religious sacrilege and abhorrent sacrifi ce: in the dream the body of a sacrifi ced boy had been placed in a temple of Zeus somewhere in Antioch. Describing his dream repeatedly to diff erent friends, Libanius proclaims, “Such news seemed to indicate spells, incantations, and attacks from sorcerers (pharmaka de kai magganeumata kai polemon apo goētōn andrōn).”61 Dreams in late antiquity are a primary means of divine-human communication; Libanius and his closest companions know to turn immediately to the task of determining what the gods may have been trying to communicate through the obscure imagery of his dream. Consequently, sometime later, when someone eventually stumbles across a strange little chameleon in his lecture room, Libanius and his interlocutors set it within the framework of an oneiric discourse. Th ey identify it as clear evidence of an evil sorcery that Libanius’s dream has foretold. At last, Libanius has some insight into the horrible and inexplicable illnesses he has been experiencing for quite some time."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 39DIVINATION AND THE SITUATIONAL EVOLUTION OF RITUAL PRACTICEIn late antiquity, dream divination is one of several practices that off er a measure of religious agency and an opportunity for spiritual innovation to individuals and groups, including Libanius in Antioch. In what follows we will explore how local religious monuments and statuary—whatever their state of repair—shape an indi-vidual’s or a group’s supernatural worldview and thus their religious/ritual agency within that worldview. A well-known text, Libanius’s famous discussion of his dis-covery of a dead chameleon in his lecture hall in the late 380s, provides interesting insights into the practices (individual and community) of dream divination. While scholars have focused on the chameleon for what it reveals regarding contempo-rary beliefs about magical practice, Libanius’s dream retains our focus as we ask the following questions. How do the religious monuments and statuary in Antioch at that time inform his and his community’s understanding of divinatory commu-nication? Likewise, how do these monuments together with his dream shape the shared view of his illness?Soon aft er the New Year’s festival of Kalends in 386 Libanius begins to suff er from a debilitating migraine. Th e doctors are at a loss to explain the cause or fi nd a cure. A mantic is the only one able to off er any benefi cial advice: he advises that Libanius not open his veins. Ultimately, a dead chameleon is discovered in the hall where Libanius lectures, and the orator knows immediately that this is the cause of his suff ering: a competitor has used the chameleon to place a curse on him. A dis-turbing dream precedes the reptile’s discovery and frames its identifi cation as a magical object. Libanius himself describes the dream:I saw two boys who had been sacrifi ced, and the dead body of one was placed behind a door in the temple of Zeus. Aft er I protested against such a sacrilege, I was told that this would be the position until evening, but that when evening came he would be buried. Such news seemed to indicate spells, incantations, and attacks from sorcerers. And so it turned out in actual fact, when those fears had overtaken me and except for death I desired nothing (phoboi te ekeinoi kai plēn teleutēs oudenos epithymia). Th is has been the only topic of conversation with each fresh visitor and of my prayers to heaven.62Directly aft er the dream, Libanius experiences more pain, which an inexplica-ble onset of gout increases. Weeks later, at the point when Libanius is about to give up hope, he discovers a dead chameleon in his classroom. Th e dream that gener-ated Libanius’s suspicion that he is the victim of “spells, incantations, and attacks from sorcerers” is validated. Th e convenient discovery of a mutilated and bound chameleon justifi es those suspicions; in his description Libanius attends closely to every aspect of the tiny, desiccated body as he reconstructs a profi le of his enemy and the intent of the curse. Libanius notes that the chameleon’s head is tucked"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"40 John Chrysostom and Antiochbetween its hind legs, one of which is missing and the other laid across its mouth as if caught frozen in the act of silencing itself or others. He appreciates his “incred-ible stroke of good fortune that what had been deeply buried deep should lie above the ground.”63 Clearly a competing rhetor is attempting to sabotage him.Sarah Iles Johnston has observed that in antiquity the “dream world was . . . a private world, a world shut off to anyone other than the sleeper and the gods.”64 People believe dreams to be a fertile space for human-divine communication. Many dreams are invited and desired, while others are unwanted, even invasive, yet in no way less compelling. In the case of physical or mental illness, people oft en turn to dreams as a means of seeking divine help. Incubation, which is a very familiar form of cultic healing, lies at the center of the cult of the god Asclepius, which had quickly spread throughout the ancient Mediterranean aft er its begin-ning in Epidaurus in the fourth century BCE; the god still has signifi cant presence into late antiquity—though Antioch does not have an Asclepius cult of its own.Aelius Aristides is one of Asclepius’s most famous clients, if only because he leaves behind a sacred diary detailing his two-year stay at Pergamum.65 While we have no evidence of an Asclepian cult in Antioch, Daphne, as we have seen, has the Matrona caves, a Jewish holy site that purportedly provides incubatory cures.66 Th ese kinds of sites oft en have religious/medical specialists on hand to help in translating the received divine messages into therapeutic prescriptions.Th e incubation cults continue to be popular well into the fi ft h and sixth centu-ries. Th ere are other options for those incapable or unwilling to travel to cult sites; one can fi nd relief through a more intimate, personalized kind of ritual practice. Papyri Graecae Magicae (henceforth PGM) off ers numerous texts depicting divina-tion through dreams: some are requested; some, sent in a more hostile manner. Several examples of ritual texts invite the gods into dreams. Th e range of gods and cosmological personalities is wide and varied. Spells invoke Apollo, Osiris, and the archangel Michael, together with Besas (who has to be cautioned against using treachery), “the Bear,” Sabaoth, Raphael, and Gabriel.67 Th e spells also range in form from long and complex to brief, even abrupt. Many make the intriguing request for the true form of a god or one of its many forms. A signifi cant number of the spells contain space for tailored, individualized requests for information. In other words, these spells are not all open-ended formulae. Th e text of the request for information suggests instead that individuals are driven to these ritual measures out of a precise need. Th e ritual practitioner can complete the act within the privacy of his or her own home at a time of his or her own convenience. While many of these spells do require preparations involving sacrifi cial practice, again it is on a small scale.Th e following examples help place Libanius’s own experience in its proper con-text. Both texts (PGM 5.370–446) feature Hermes. Th e texts describe an elaborate ritual involving the creation of a small fi gure of the god. He is molded out of a mixture composed of leaves picked from a laurel tree, virgin earth, wormwood"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 41seeds, and wheat meal, among other elements. An unpolluted boy must carry the separate ingredients before they are pounded together and shaped into an image of Hermes. Someone else then recites a lengthy spell. Aft er several lines of aretal-ogy, that person fi nally reaches his main request:In your own form both graciously appear and graciously render the task for me, a pious man, and render your form gracious to me, NN, that I may comprehend you by your skills of prophecy, by your own wondrous deeds. I ask you, lord, be gracious to me and without deceit appear and prophesy to me.68Aft er this, the spell is inscribed on a piece of papyrus and affi xed on an image or a statue of the god Hermes; then the person who is performing the ritual goes to sleep with the god resting near his head.A second spell, PGM 12.144–52, presents a very similar text, though the ritual prep-arations are less elaborate. In this case the spell is written on a linen strip in myrrh ink and then wrapped on an olive branch and placed beneath the left side of the head before sleeping on a rush mat on the ground. Th e instructions call for quail blood to be used as ink also. Finally, we may note a more aggressive tone with Hermes:Come to me here quickly, you who have the power. I call upon you, the one appointed god of gods over the spirits, to show this to me in dreams. I conjure [you] by your father, Osiris, and Isis, your mother, to show me one of your forms, and reveal con-cerning the things I want.69While the idea of controlling one’s dreams or having the ritual ability to open up one’s dream life to divine communication is compelling, it has its darker side. People can bind demons to the task of sending dreams to their enemies; such dreams, of a less than salubrious nature, are known as oneiropompeia. As Johnston has noted, these dreams inspire fear in many regarding the unprotected nature of the dreamscape. PGM provides some rather disturbing examples of this type.70 Neither of these types fi ts in Libanius’s case, however. He does not mention ritual preparation. Nor does he express fear that someone intending harm has sent the dream. In light of his unhesitating acceptance of—even insistence upon—the dream’s prognosticating power, a third possibility seems the most probable: the god(s) sent the dream freely.Greco-Roman literature from the Iliad to Ovid’s Metamorphoses and the Aeneid contains examples of this type of communication with divinity.71 In an incubatory state, a dreaming person can come into contact with one divinity or more than one. When a person wakes from the dream world, he may be left with confusing, if not inscrutable, fragments of some kind of divine message. A careful examina-tion of the divination text is necessary.People believe that demonic invasion can endanger this mode of human-divine communication: demons can corrupt the message or send their own as counter-feit. While incubation cult sites have religious experts ready to interpret messages,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"42 John Chrysostom and AntiochLibanius wakes up in his home. Th us it is important to note that he shares his dream quickly and widely with his trusted community. We can imagine friends and family well rehearsed in the art of transforming a dream into an object for interpretation, scrutinizing it for clues to Libanius’s condition. Th ey place his dream precisely into the aetiology of his illness and the context of a discussion regarding dream divination: the dream is a puzzle to decode, and the fi rst question to answer is, What kind of dream is it? Th e dream is not enhupnia or phantas-mata—in other words, garbled nonsense. And someone else has not sent it—that is, it is not an aggressive act of oneiropompeia. While Libanius has not invited the dream, the divine message is not unwelcome: the god in question is Zeus. Liban-ius’s good fortune is due—no doubt—to his good standing as a tireless defender of Hellēnismos in Antioch.Th e dream indicates—if nothing else—Zeus’s relevance in the lives of Libanius and his trusted circle; this god is still an active, communicating divinity in the ora-tor’s life as late as 386. Th is is not surprising, given Zeus’s fi rm and protective grip on Antioch from the city’s beginning; his temples and statues still have an impres-sive architectural hold on the landscape in Libanius’s time. Along with Apollo, Zeus still has great honor in the city as one of the patron deities of the Seleucids. Accord-ing to Malalas, a temple of Zeus Bottiaios is the fi rst temple built by Seleucus in Antioch when he founds the city. In the early imperial period Commodus builds a temple to Zeus Olympius in Antioch in honor of the Olympic games; Diocletian builds a temple to Zeus Olympius in Daphne. Zeus Kasios is worshipped at a tem-ple at Seleucia and on Mount Kasios from the Hellenistic period; the temple there is described as “dark with clouds.”72 Zeus on Mount Kasios is visited by three Roman emperors: Trajan, Hadrian, and Julian. According to Libanius, Julian par-takes in a more personalized, even intimate, contact with the god, befi tting an age touched by theurgy. In his description of Julian’s visit to worship Zeus on Mount Kasios, Libanius explains that Julian “saw the god and aft er seeing him . . . received advice.”73 He continues that Zeus, “[as] one of the immortals descended from heaven, took [Julian] by the hair, spoke to him, and aft er listening to [Zeus’s] answer [Julian] departed.”74 In his descriptions of Julian’s intimate counsel with Zeus, Libanius describes a shift in the religious imagination surrounding the god, which had begun long before in the reign of Maximinus Daia. In his Historia eccle-siastica, Eusebius of Caesarea describes a statue in honor of Zeus Philius erected in Antioch by an apparent city offi cial named Th eotecnus. One can, with a little patience, read through the Eusebian anti-pagan language to catch a glimpse and confi rm that Neoplatonic theurgy was involved in the statue worship:[Th eotecnus] ended by erecting a statue of Zeus the Befriender [Philiou: i.e., Jupiter Philius] with certain juggleries and sorceries (magganeiais tisin kai goēteiais), and having devised (epinoēsas) unhallowed rites (teletas te anagnous) for it and ill-omened initiations (myēseis akallierētous) and abominable purifi cations (exagistous"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 43katharmous), he exhibited his wonderworking by what oracles he pleased, even in the Emperor’s presence. And moreover this fellow, in order to fl atter and please him who was ruling, stirred up the demon against the Christians (epegeirei kata Christianōn ton daimona), and said that the god, forsooth, had given orders that the Christians should be driven away beyond the borders of the city and country round about, since they were his enemies.75According to Libanius, this statue is also a favored visitation site of Julian—a particularly interesting point, given the emperor’s theurgic interests as well as his disappointments at other temple sites in Antioch. We may indeed have a situation in which Julian himself does a great deal to advance the personalized, intimate human-divine communication with the divinity of Zeus during his time in the city—a ritualization process not lost on Libanius, it would seem.Perhaps when Libanius describes his dream of the defi led Zeus temple he pro-vides a glimpse of an unexpected instance in which his conscious grasp of Anti-och’s religious topography overlaps with his own personal and deeply religious subconscious. When he and his friends begin to discuss the dream, Libanius par-ticipates in transforming its meaning. He also reconfi gures or reconfi rms the iden-tity of Zeus, who stands once more as a powerful, divine, communicating power in Antioch. Th is discursive process does not serve to weaken the force and authority of Zeus tied to certain temples and statuary in and around the city. It does the opposite. In their collective conversations (about dreams, omens, curses, and so forth), Libanius and his companions, all absolute devotees of Hellēnismos, look to the abandoned temples, the aging statuary and shrines, and they see something else. Th ese religious structures provide an anchor for modifi ed, deeply personal-ized, and intensifi ed modes of ritual communication between the divine and human beings. Libanius’s dream is perhaps for Libanius and his companions, as it is for us, a rare opportunity. For Libanius and his friends, the dream off ers proof of continuing communication with the gods of old, and in a manner of translative ease, relatively speaking. For us it off ers a rare opportunity to catch a glimpse of a transformative process, one in which a random, nonsensical dream gestates into a precious moment of admonitory divine-human contact.On the face of it, a dream of a sacrifi ced boy in a temple of Zeus is quite a stretch from Libanius’s fi nal self-diagnosis as a victim of goēteia. Th is alone could justify dismissing the dream altogether as the fanciful musings of a feverish orator. And yet, viewed from a diff erent angle, it is the only way to read Libanius’s dream. Th e young corpse (an untimely death, associated with magic) is an especially vile sac-rilege in a god’s temple; such a blasphemous transgression in a divine, ritual space would alert Libanius to the possibility of an object of goēteia in locations in his own surroundings that were in a sense “sacred” to him. More important to note, perhaps, is the fact that Libanius does not come to these conclusions alone. From almost the moment he awakes, his dream transforms into a discursive object,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"44 John Chrysostom and Antiochwhich he shares with his intimate circle. Libanius and his community know well the temples and statues in Antioch dedicated to Zeus; more to the point, they also experience the architecture and its geography as the Antiochenes spend their lives (secular and/or religious) walking around or through and, of course, pausing with ritual intent within or near these structures. Libanius and his companions are able to read the meanings of the Zeus cult easily. Th ere are numerous possibilities. In this case the presence of the Zeus temple in Libanius’s dream indicates the god’s protective patronage.Th ese religious monuments help to maintain Libanius’s and his friends’ sense of Hellēnismos in Antioch. Libanius’s dream and the question of its divinatory func-tion spark discussion among friends and family; they also aff ect their actions. In their many conversations, Libanius rehearses the details of the dream; he and his community’s perception of their environment mold to those details. His compan-ions begin to search for signs that someone is practicing ritual sacrilege against Libanius. Libanius claims fearfully that some of his friends have divined his death. Other companions insist that he arrest those whom they suspect of performing secret curses. Inevitably, their shift ing perceptions enable not just Libanius but his friends and family to catch the hidden truth of goēteia in the twisted body of a dead chameleon in the corner of a classroom. Libanius’s dream of temple defi le-ment sparks a discourse that produces a tightly knit community that searches out a supernatural and nefarious cause behind his illness. Th is community fi nally fi nds a cure: they collectively discover something foul and dead lying in his class-room, polluting the great orator in his own “temple.” With the curse exposed, Libanius’s community is now motivated to oversee his return to health.While the thriving cults to Zeus, which existed a century before, or for that mat-ter a generation earlier, are gone, the divinity and animistic forces associated with his temples and statuary still loom large in the daily lives of many within Antioch. Th ese animate forces and powers inform people’s decisions, actions, and movements on a daily basis, as we see in the case of Libanius’s dream. Th e mode and manner of com-munication between human and divine is now more intimate and individuated, but, intriguingly, it still traffi cs in images of temples, statues, shrines, and traditional rituals of the king of the gods. Language and imagery rescued from a declining civic cult can still create a strong sense of community in Antioch.In what follows we continue this line of exploration. What kinds of supernatu-ral and demonic forces are maintained or evolve into something new as people in Antioch engage in a wide array of ritual practices?SPIRITS OF THE MARKETPLACEAll of the major highways and roads linking the western reaches of the Roman Empire with realms beyond Persia run through Antioch. As a result, Antioch is"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 45home to one of the richest collections of marketplaces in late antiquity. On the main Roman street, shops that nestle in between the columns of the street’s colon-nade eventually multiply to encroach on the wide avenue.76 Th is is only one of many locations of commerce throughout the city. Scholars have shown that Anti-och’s marketplaces contribute signifi cantly to the city’s sociocultural, economic, and political vitality. As highly charged, volatile environments, the markets func-tion as a natural catalyst for attempts to secure powerful spiritual aid through various ritual means on a daily basis. Consequently, these spaces enrich the com-plexity and abundance of the city’s animistic atmosphere.Libanius and John Chrysostom describe a highly diverse collection of merchants and craft smen in Antioch: bakers, greengrocers, silversmiths, goldsmiths, tavern keepers, barbers, stonemasons, perfumers, metalworkers, cobblers, weavers, and sellers of cheese, vinegar, fi gs, and wood. Th e markets are large, varied, and eco-nomically fi ckle throughout the fourth century. Guilds, which were formed to pro-tect the interests of merchants and craft smen, only fuel the already fi erce competi-tion. Archaeological evidence has uncovered the ruthless nature of this competition. Excavations by Princeton University in 1934–35 uncovered a number of curse tab-lets in Antioch and Daphne dated to the third–fourth century.77 A large number relate to the marketplace. Most importantly for our purposes, the presence of curse tablets in Antioch’s marketplaces attests to local belief in anyone’s ability to compel demons and other supernatural entities to infl ict harm upon other human beings.As John G. Gager has shown, curse tablets are ubiquitous throughout the ancient Mediterranean world; they provide an accessible ritual means of seeking justice and revenge.78 Th e curse tablet generally consists of a sheet of lead on which are inscribed magic formulae and symbols. Certain rituals are performed over the tablet—including incantation utterances as well as sacrifi cial practices. Aft er this, the tablet is oft en buried in a body of water or placed in the grave of someone who died young. Two of the discovered tablets were found in a well or cistern off the courtyard of the House of the Calendar situated at the base of Mount Staurin, on the northeast side of the city. Both tablets are directed against a greengrocer named Babylas. Th e inscriptions on the tablets invoke Iao and Seth as well as other demons to bind Babylas, “to lay him low, to sink him like lead, to destroy his ani-mals and his house in general.” Florent Heintz, who discusses these and other curse texts, has explained that to fi nd his prey expeditiously, the demon was pro-vided with precise detail.79 In addition to providing the demon with the exact loca-tion in the vegetable stall, the curse tablet lists three diff erent names for Babylas’s mother, presumably to aid the demon in his hunt. Th e inscribed invocation fea-tures the names of multiple deities to ensure demonic compliance. In light of the marketplace’s competitive atmosphere, Heintz suggests that rival greengrocers commissioned the tablets. Silke Trzcionka reaches a similar conclusion, contend-ing that “fi nancial sabotage was the intention of both tablets.”80"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"46 John Chrysostom and AntiochWhile it seems clear that Babylas has multiple and motivated enemies, he is hardly helpless. Antioch’s marketplaces off er far more to the consumer than the products of bakers, blacksmiths, and cobblers. As Heintz has surmised, such arti-facts and descriptions attest to the presence of magic workshops in Antioch throughout late antiquity. Magic workers would surely be advertising an ability both to stymie their clients’ competition and to protect their businesses’ interests. All forms of magic—protective, performance-enhancing, and aggressive—are predicated on a widespread belief in a magician’s ability to engage or ward off supernatural entities by calling on other, more powerful forces. Heintz speaks spe-cifi cally to the marketing and selling of such ritual manipulations as common strategies in “enhancing the economic position and social status of the magician’s client.”81 We can imagine magic workers feeding well off the competition produced in Antioch’s many markets and possibly being drawn to Antioch for this reason. A Syrian silver phylactery discovered in Antioch and dated to the fourth or fi ft h century may also testify to the activities of magicians in the city. Th e object con-sists of a sheet of metal originally rolled up and placed inside a cylindrical case. It was probably worn as a pendant.82 Th e Greek inscription starts with an invocation to thirty-six magical entities who are hailed as “holy, mighty and powerful names of great Necessity” and asked them all to “preserve and protect from all witchcraft and sorcery, from curse tablets, from those who died an untimely death, from those who died violently and from every evil thing, the body, the soul and every limb of the body of Th omas, whom Maxima bore, from this day forth through his entire time to come.”83 We might imagine Babylas seeking to purchase such an object from a magician, especially if he has heard rumors that his own business has been targeted.Because of the city’s proximity to Persia, someone like Babylas, and indeed oth-ers whose livelihood depends on the marketplace, faces another, very diff erent kind of problem. As Roman-Persian tensions intensify in the fourth century, imperial eyes turn their attention to Antioch. In 337, Constantius II arrives, and he remains until 354. He oversees a substantial buildup of the military, a trend that continues long aft er his death. Th e military expansion, together with a growing imperial bureaucracy, aff ects—and oft en radically destabilizes—the city’s socioeconomic dynamics. Th e sudden population growth puts a strain on the city’s resources, as several food shortages in the 380s eventually demonstrate.84 While the growth of the military and the ruling bureaucracy can off er fi nancial advantages, more oft en than not it produces the opposite, as J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz has observed:Ordinary shopkeepers and craft smen had to submit to numerous abuses. Th e tavern-keepers suff ered from the offi cials of the three high dignitaries who had their head-quarters in Antioch, and from other persons of power such as agentes in rebus. All exploited their rank to obtain goods, particularly drinks, without paying for them.

Th e garrison . . . joined in the exploi-tation. Th ese soldiers carried off everything there was in the shops, and if there was no meat, nor anything else that appealed to them, they took money. Th is suggests that the soldiers were exploiting an obligation on the part of the shops to supply the soldier’s rations.85Abuses perpetrated by soldiers and the imperial entourage destabilize a fragile economic market. Vulnerable tradesmen, who may already be suff ering from competitors’ magical attacks, now have to protect themselves from high offi cials’ and soldiers’ intimidation and exploitation. Magicians, who sell protective spells and curses, will have been among the few to benefi t in such diffi cult times. Th e archaeological evidence, though not overwhelming, certainly indicates that this business endures through and beyond the fourth century. In light of the trades-men’s acute vulnerability to the abuses Liebeschuetz describes, we may easily envisage a steady stream of magicians’ clients who request both spells of protec-tion and curses for revenge.Let us step a bit beyond Liebeschuetz’s comments and discuss certain dangers during this tumultuous time that take us beyond the realm of the strictly economic. As soldiers multiply in and around the city, magicians gain new clients, or maintain magical production, for an entirely diff erent reason: for bodily protection. Th e danger of sexual assault against women is quite real at this time—as it is at any time in the (late) ancient world. Soldiers are used to exploiting their privileges over shopkeepers, innkeepers, and craft smen. How, then, might we imagine the young women in their households? Are their daughters forced to live in close proximity to undisciplined soldiers accustomed to laying claim to “free” goods? A young woman and her family from a low, unprotected position in society are relatively helpless to secure suffi cient protection or seek justice in the aft ermath of an assault.More than one of Antioch’s martyr cults highlight the cruel social fact of rape; more intriguingly still, such cults tie the threat of sexual abuse to Roman soldiers. In the martyria outside the city are the celebrated tombs of Domnina and her vir-gin daughters, Berenike and Prosdoke, who during the Diocletian persecution chose to drown themselves rather than suff er probable rape by passing Roman soldiers.86 Antioch is also home to the popular cult of Pelagia, a young virgin who jumped from a roof to escape a similar fate: an annual festival had evolved to honor her bravery as well.87 Cult sites such as these can provide a place of solicitous prayer as well as tearful solace for young women exposed to sexual dangers. Th e locations may also be places of mental and emotional refuge aft er the fact of an assault; it is not diffi cult to imagine these sites developing forms of supernatural power of both protection and revenge tailored for the vulnerable and possibly abused female.While we may never know how the martyr cults may have off ered help to women, we do know that magicians off er amuletic protection of some kind. A"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"48 John Chrysostom and Antiochsilver amulet found in a grave near Beirut provides valuable insight into the kind of protection a young woman in Antioch may have sought.88 A thin band engraved with 121 short lines of text was rolled up and placed in a bronze cylinder and worn around the neck as a protective amulet. Th e third- or fourth-century amulet adjures an unnamed power, quite possibly a corpse demon (nekydaimōn), to pro-tect its owner, Alexandra, from a variety of evils, which included “from every demon and from every compulsion of demons, and from demons and sorceries and binding-spells.” Th e spell assures the help of a demonic power by invoking a large collection of angelic powers; it identifi es their names and their areas of infl u-ence. Angels are named who “sit” (ho kathēmenos) over the fi rst through the seventh heavens, the sea, rivers, and, mountains, as well as roads, cities, and streets. Finally, aft er completing the long list of angelic powers, the spell issues the direct request for help:[P]rotect Alexandra whom Zoê bore from daimones and sorceries and dizziness and from all passion and from all frenzy. I adjure you by the Living God in Zoar of the nomadic Zabadeans, the one who thunders and lightnings . . . that (?) all male and frightening daimones and all bindings-spells (fl ee) from Alexandra whom Zoê bore, to beneath the founts and the Abyss of Mareôth, lest you harm or defi le her, or use magic drugs on her, either by a kiss, or from an embrace, or a greeting; either with food or drink; either in bed or intercourse; either by the evil eye or a piece of cloth-ing; as she prays (?), either on the street or abroad; or while river-bathing or at bath. Holy and might and powerful names, protect Alexandra from every daimon, male and female, and from every disturbance of daimones of the night and of the day. Deliver Alexandra whom Zoê bore, now; now; quickly, quickly. One God and his Christ, help Alexandra.89While this was found in Beirut, it is likely that amulets of a similar nature would have been used in Antioch.90 Th e spell projects a palpable sense of a constant fear of victimization and an anxious, yet pragmatic, belief that there are innumerable dangers that can harm those who are ritually unprotected in a city. Th is invites the question, How many people would have risked walking in Antioch without some form of apotropaic protection? Th e ritual text from Beirut and hundreds of others like it off er the impression that demons have overrun the environment and are ready for any compulsory call to bind (to) anyone in an erotic spell or a curse. But demons also have to respond promptly to a person’s ritual of expulsion or exorcism, if properly performed. Demons have to play by the rules; they have no voluntary power of movement—in general.91 While the human body is always in danger of suff ering victimization in some kind of demonic attack, a person has the ability to defend him/herself and fi ght back through his/her own ritual manipulations.Another area of demonic production to consider is the “demimonde” of prosti-tution—especially in Antioch in light of the theater’s popularity.92 Th e magician in his workshop, the aging prostitute turned procuress, the old woman healer/magic"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"A City of Pluralism and Ambiguity 49worker—each may be in the business of craft ing agōgē spells for the socially elite hetaira, the common pornē in the backstreet brothel, or the occasional wife who wishes to reclaim her husband from an aggressive prostitute or slave. As Christo-pher Faraone has convincingly argued, the hetaira cultivates an aggressive mascu-linity in order to sustain socioeconomic autonomy.93 Her use of erotic magic is completely natural—a tool of the trade in a cutthroat world. Her ability to manu-facture spells on her own would be a sign of how much she excels at all aspects of her craft . Th ough Faraone deals with a much earlier period, he proposes that we can fi nd magic-wielding prostitutes in late antiquity, resting his claim primarily on the evidence of John Chrysostom. Th is presents an intriguing possibility: that hetairai and the socially lower pornai contribute to the production of an animated environment. To a certain extent, whether or not this is actually the case is irrele-vant; people believe that a prostitute has to possess a certain degree of magical knowledge. Incantations, love potions, necromantic practices, and the like are all a part of her trade, tools that help her to maintain the aff ection of her client, even to do away with his wife in extreme cases. Moreover, literature as well as texts included in PGM portray erotic magic and the agōgē spell itself as an especially feared and frightening form of magic that blurs the divide between a demon and a human being. Greco-Roman and late antique Christian literature contain exam-ples that graphically display the dehumanizing eff ects of the agōgē spells: those targeted become screaming, frantic, crazed, and raving victims.94What all these practices communicate to us is that people in late antiquity cannot aff ord to close their eyes to an invisible reality of demons and other suprahuman entities. In fact, their practices—their fears, concerns, jealousies, and hatreds—help to create and regenerate the material realities (ritual practices, objects, and build-ings) of demons and other forces or powers. Th e archaeological and literary record off ers a picture of Antioch’s citizens engaged in rituals of binding and loosening, expelling, and casting away demons and other kinds of cosmological beings in an eff ort to live day to day in what can be an unforgiving urban environment.To that end, the concept of the “magic workshops” provides a handy, hypo-thetical location(s)—an anchor within Antioch’s topography—to consider the production and dissemination of demonic and general animistic knowledge. Spells for horse races, erotic spells, protection against erotic spells, incantations for healing, divination spells, and curse texts are among the many kinds of ritual products recovered in excavations and recorded in the literary record. In much of the recovered material, as well as in comparable evidence from places nearby, we fi nd wide-ranging references to demonic powers as the central mechanism of rit-ual agency. Th ose who make and sell these ritual texts (whether they are magicians or other kinds of ritual experts), as well as those who purchase them, are engaged in the production and regulation of demonic and supernatural knowledge. Th ey also contribute to the commodifi cation of that knowledge. A supply-and-demand"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"50 John Chrysostom and Antiochprinciple guides the local cultivation of Antioch’s spiritual worldview. People with a particular need for protection, love, revenge, and truth, for example, seek out the available magician or other ritual expert (e.g., Greek priest, Christian monk, or rabbi) to whom deities, demons, demigods, and powerful names off er the most power. Which spells are effi cacious? What are the costs? Who are the most reliable practitioners of magic? Such questions drive the production of animistic and demonic knowledge in the city of Antioch.In chapter 2 we turn to consider how well attuned John Chrysostom is to this situation. We will explore the manner in which he uses demons to combat people’s inveterate and inherent ritual sense of various supernatural powers in the city. John does not deny the effi cacy of non-Christian ritual practices or reject the real-ity of the supernatural powers populating populations. Instead, he does the oppo-site. He begs his congregants to seek refuge within the protective walls of the church. He understands the pressing weight of the supernatural populations’ threat; in fact, he amplifi es it. He speaks repeatedly and graphically of the dangers in non-Christian rituals and enhances those dangers until the only eff ective apo-tropaic and protective rituals left are sacramental and ecclesiastical. He claims that the charismatic power that a non-Christian ritual practitioner displays—and whispers into the ears of John’s own congregants—comes from the devil himself. And then John turns around and off ers to perform an exorcism to expel the pollu-tion the congregant has contracted. In other words, Chrysostom attempts to diabolize the rituals and related spiritual orders in Antioch; being the golden-mouthed priest of Antioch, John transforms the practice of diabolization into a rhetorical art as well as an impressive ritual practice.However, a particular kind of Antioch is easily able to withstand and survive John’s demonology and diabolization. And in fact, the depth of ritual life in the city is such that even this far into the Christian period Antiochene bodies are invested with profoundly complex, multilayered ritual knowledge and a living, evolving knowledge of the surrounding invisible forces empowering those rituals. People have tremendous power to create through ritual practice a wide range of animistic powers subversive or indiff erent to the processes of Christianization. To that end, Antioch harbors the potential for tremendous religious and ritual transformation and rejuvenation outside the realm of Christianity for quite some time."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"51In late-fourth-century Antioch Christians still participate in Greek festivals that celebrate the cosmological powers of Tyche, Dionysus, Apollo, Zeus, Calliope, and many others. In a striking contrast, they may also visit the theater, where they can bear witness to a performance depicting the same deities’ immoral escapades. During the High Holidays, Christians dance with Jews as they all celebrate the Jewish god—a divine being freed from a theologically complicated relationship with a son. Jewish amulets heal Christians’ illnesses; Christians’ diseases fi nd cures in incubation temples; nurses place strange mud markings upon Christian babies’ foreheads to protect them from a predatory illness or evil.1 Christians move unre-fl ectively in and out of such non-Christian rituals, to John Chrysostom’s dismay; he agonizes as his congregants experience the power inherent in the diverse array of cosmological entities who inhabit Antioch. John despises the stories of healings that the laity and even a few among the clergy share—testimonies that encourage them all to continue to reach out to non-Christian rituals in moments of sickness, injury, injustice, or simply anxiety and fear.John wishes to convince Christians that demons reside in all forms of Antioch’s non-Christian ritual activity. Along those lines, he also insists that they establish a distinct, prohibitive—if not agonistic—ritual Christian identity specifi c to the socioreligious context of the city.2 However, the congregants’ lifelong exposure to and experience within Antioch’s wider non-Christian ritual environments render them especially resistant to his eff orts.Consequently he fails more oft en than he succeeds: many in his community ignore his insistent claims and warnings. In light of his congregants’ recalci-trance—or simply their lifelong comfort and familiarity with non-Christian ritual— 2Th e Devil Is in the Ritual"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"52 John Chrysostom and Antiochthis is hardly surprising. How then can he hope to shift his congregants’ experi-ence of their world? How might he radically transform their accustomed and cus-tomary sense of deity in parts of Antioch so that they might instead experience the opposite: seeing, hearing, touching, and inevitably attacking the demonic?Th is chapter considers his approach to these formidable challenges.3 Th e time John has to convert his congregation’s behavior, let alone transform their thinking and experience of their environment, is limited; he has to work effi ciently but also subtly, given the frustrating constraints of pastoral communication. In his ser-mons, John craft s several short, striking narratives portraying the demonic cor-ruption contracted when a Christian participates in diff erent rituals throughout the city. We argue that he intends these to persuade his congregants to loosen themselves from their ritual attachments outside the church. While he constructs highly disturbing demonological images, which carry a complex epistemology of ritual practice, he designs these images to work at the ideological level.4 Long aft er his sermons are over and his audience has left the church, he hopes his portraits of demon-plagued Christians will continue to fester in listeners’ imaginations, compelling them inevitably to shed the outer skin of their own urban and ritual identity.In his seminal 1978 article “Towards Interpreting Demonic Powers in Hellenis-tic and Roman Antiquity,” Jonathan Z. Smith refers to the demonic as a “relational or labeling term” to mark the marginal, ambiguous, and protean in the wider envi-ronment.5 A number of recent scholars—though not all—have very helpfully turned to Smith’s work on “the demonic” to trace how Christian leaders use such language to demarcate a clear, distinct Christian identity separate from other reli-gious identities. Th ose who have recently turned to the question of demonology in John Chrysostom’s work have also oft en referenced Smith’s insights.6 In describing John Chrysostom’s demonology, however, we will refrain from using the term “demonic” in the manner that Smith describes. John and many in his congregation have very diff erent, if not oppositional, worldviews regarding animistic power and its relation to ritual practice. Consequently, he does not have the luxury of speak-ing to his listeners from some shared Archimedean point of common morality and notion of identity where they can agree upon what is blasphemous, impious, or impure and then collectively agree to stand apart from it. Rather, John has a quite complex understanding of the “Self,” a formulation that pivots primarily around the issue of baptismal conversion. Th ose who have been baptized have been elevated—as much as is possible in this life—into the spiritual order (ta pneuma-tika) and have gained control over their own perception and reason; they have an ability to move through the world accordingly. By contrast, those who have not been baptized are still part of the sensory order around them (epi tōn aisthētōn), able to discern and maintain stable boundaries between their mind/soul and the surrounding sensory materiality.7 John Chrysostom’s ideas of religious identity—"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 53or, more to the point, personhood and subjectivity—demand a much more pro-found demonology to carve that divide between the sensory and the pneumatic into Antioch and into the mindset of the more devoted in his congregation, par-ticularly those who seek baptism. As we will investigate in this and the following chapter, John informs the baptized in antidemonic and exorcistic tactics of man-aging the more recalcitrant—and the demonically tainted—members of his con-gregation. Beyond that he instructs the baptized, the newly enlisted soldiers of Christ (hoi neoi tou Christou stratiōtai), in how to engage in spiritual warfare against demons in the wider environment of Antioch.8As this chapter demonstrates, John faces a problem of ingrained habits and customs (synthēmata) in several members of his congregation. In John’s view, many of his congregants are the victims of verbal formulae and behavioral patterns that have accumulated over generations in Antioch; the body engaged in these words and actions in a manner that falls below the level of individual conscious thought or intention. Somehow the priest has to convince his listeners to recog-nize this part of themselves (both word and deed) as impious, blasphemous, and polluting, and then voluntarily reject that part. It is his duty as their priest to make all members recognize the reality behind the delusion: to see the insidiously demonic behind what appears to be the familiar, normal, and even mundane ritual practices in their everyday lives. He also encourages communal management. Th e baptized and the more advanced are given greater responsibility over the weaker in the congregation.9 Reliance on straightforward demonization, as Smith describes it, will have been an insuffi cient rhetorical tactic for John’s task. In his sermons, he assiduously constructs a collection of images depicting his commu-nity’s ritual life in Antioch and Daphne; Chrysostom’s pictures follow the con-tours of his congregants’ experiential reality quite closely, diff ering in one essential respect: they off er a chilling view into an invisible, spiritual world that parasitically clings to the experience of human beings. In image aft er image, John describes demons clustering around a wide array of ritual actions and ritual settings through-out and beyond Antioch and Daphne. And while John mentions the random angel who will intervene when invoked, it happens infrequently.10John pulls all of these ritual images together into a larger demonological frame-work of the sensory (demonic/unbaptized) versus the pneumatic (divine/baptized). In expressing the diff erences in the dualities he assembles, John draws upon imagery created within predominantly Stoic theorizations of cognition and sensory percep-tion.11 His images repeatedly portray demons corrupting and perverting sensory matter as well as thoughts (dialogismoi); it is through such corrupted, perceptible material that demons contaminate a Christian’s mind (nous), rational faculty (dianoia), and/or soul (psychē). In conjunction with this, John’s attempts to dislodge his congregants from their ritual habits and customs mirror Stoic and Epicurean strategies of reversing a habit.12 It is not the case that Stoic writing has directly shaped"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"54 John Chrysostom and AntiochJohn’s demonology, however; more probably his perspective derives from an ascetic background already soaked through with Stoicizing (and thus moral and ethical) aspects.13 More to the point, when constructing a demonology relevant for his immediate audience, John draws on a philosophical koinē that his audience largely comprehends. Particularly the educated among his audience are familiar with the Stoic models of subjectivity and personhood. Th ese express the fragility of an embodied human being’s abilities to perceive, to think, and to latch onto a stable sense of true knowledge (epistēmē) in a fl uctuating sensory world.John develops diabolizing imagery that communicates an undeniable and immediate sense (and sensation) of Nicene superiority to his audience; he under-stands this superiority to reside within a complex epistemology of ecclesiastical and sacramental action. Th us, he designs ritual narratives to convey his view of theological truth: Nicene sacramental rituals enable the baptized to attain a sud-den, clear perspective and to grasp fl eeting cognitive knowledge in the thick haze that Antioch’s sensory environment produces. Congregants who unrefl ectively participate in rituals outside the church create a dangerous situation not only for themselves, but also for the community as a whole. As members of the Nicene community, stronger, baptized congregants have obligations toward the spiritual livelihood of other, less advanced members of the community.And yet, as embodied creatures of habit and custom, and in their sensorily indulgent behavior in the larger urban environment, many Christians allow their minds to decay. John expresses this problem in demonological terms: congregants have left themselves vulnerable to demonic invasion, and those demons lead them into further degradation in non-Nicene behavior and thought at the individual level; if not taken care of, this can also spread throughout the communal level as well. John understands demonic infection as contamination and as a contagion: he describes it in diff erent places, but prominently in the Adversus Judaeos homilies, as a disease. Most intriguingly, John defi nes the means of spreading demonic con-tamination widely and quickly: non-Christian ritual. In the case of the Adversus Judaeos homilies, of course, John condemns Judaizing rituals in this manner.14Despite what may seem a hopeless portrait, John off ers quite the opposite in Antioch. He is equally optimistic in his view of the urban, baptized, sacramental life. Prebaptismal exorcisms, baptism, and the Eucharist cleanse the mind of demonic corruption and fortify it against new demonic assault. But as we will see in John’s baptismal instructions, Nicene sacramental rituals do much more than simply return the faculties of rational thought and judgment to Christians; they empower Christians through the rituals of baptism. Th rough baptismal training Christians learn the antidemonic rituals of spiritual warfare. In baptism the Holy Spirit grants them exorcistic authority against the devil. In their postbaptismal life they are now “soldiers of Christ” and obligated to enroll in spiritual warfare against the demons in their environment."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 55Two questions begin this chapter. How does John understand the processes by which the prebaptismal rituals and sacramental rites create such powerful and powerfully antidemonic Christians? What exactly does John intend these Chris-tians to do once they gain such power?Before searching for the answers in John’s sermons, a brief survey of the basic principles of perception and cognition in Stoicism is in order.SENSORY PERCEPTION AND COGNITION IN STOICISMTh e Stoics hold a materialist concept of the soul as well as a materialist under-standing of the mechanics of sense perception and cognition.15 In their writings, the soul/mind overlap and in some cases confl ate with the faculties of reasoning or commanding, which stretch out to the senses through an extension of breath (aisthēsis): e.g., that of sight stretching out toward the eyes; that of hearing stretch-ing out to the ears.16 Th is arrangement enables the commanding faculty to receive external information from sensory experiences; consequently, these sensory expe-riences may involve an extension of the breath beyond to the sensory object (e.g., vision) or the external sensory material reaching the sensory faculty (e.g., hear-ing). Stoics describe several separate components in the act of sense perception. Th e impression (phantasia) is “an aff ection engendered in the soul” by an impres-sor (phantastikon) from without—that is, the sensory material from the original sensory object.17Th e main issue within Stoic cognitive theory pertains to the commanding fac-ulty’s ability to assent to an impression; this ability involves judging the impres-sion’s validity, and then, if the impression is valid, the commanding faculty incor-porates the impression within the mind to build scientifi c, true knowledge (epistēmē). Not all impressions are reliable. Proper versus improper assent to impressions indicates the diff erence between a wise (virtuous) man and a fool. Cer-tain impressions have an ability to reveal their objects truly; these are called cogni-tive (katalepton): “that which arises from what is and is stamped and impressed exactly in accordance with what is.”18 Th e wise or virtuous man possesses epistēmē through the accumulation of cognitive impressions (katalēpseis), which are “secure and fi rm and unchangeable by reason.”19 By contrast, ignorant men incorrectly assent to faulty impressions, which engender false opinions (doxa); this can lead to impulses to act in an improper manner. So too the ignorant as well as the melan-choly or mad are susceptible to assenting to fi gments (phantasmata)—“that to which we are attracted in the empty attraction of imagination (phantastikon).”20Passions (pathē) hold an important position within the Stoics’ mechanical understanding of sensory perception and cognitive thought. Th eorists disagree as to the various passions’ relations to the soul (i.e., the commanding faculty). Still,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"56 John Chrysostom and Antiochthey generally agree that it is the mind’s assent to impressions that can lead to the arousal of the passions. Stoics divide passions into four good elements and four bad. Each element motivates impulses to action, either moderate or immoderate. Repeated assent to false impressions can lead to a hardening of the tenor that con-nects to negative passions; in this way, the process of assent can create the eff ect of hardwiring bad emotions such as greed, sexual perversion, and so forth. While the foolish man repeatedly assents to impressions that exacerbate negative passions, the wise man trains his mind not to assent to such impressions. In this way, the wise man can theoretically control the emotional reactions that lead to improper action. At the bottom line, a human being, or more precisely the commanding faculty, is responsible for the body’s passions and the passions’ impulses to rash, potentially immoral action.We need hardly mention that Stoics are working within a very diff erent cosmol-ogy than Christians. Th e Stoic World Soul is good, rational, and virtuous; it fi lters down to imbue every element in the world, including the individual soul—that is, the commanding faculty, which has innately within it the potential for rational, intelligent judgment. Th ere is no place for external evil agency. Th erefore igno-rance, unbridled passion, and improper action are all due to mistakes in judgment: false assents to false impressions. Imagine, however, the mechanics and materiality of sensory perception incorporated into a Christian cosmology, one in which the devil has the single task of harming human beings—i.e., spiritual warfare.Stoic theories of cognition, in barest outline, inform John Chrysostom’s under-standing of the demonic corruption of the mind/soul. John portrays demons as contaminating a person’s process of sensory perception if that person is engaged in non-Christian (even non-Nicene) ritual practice. Related to this, of course, John also depicts the cleansing and fortifying power of Nicene ecclesiastical ritual and Nicene sacramental rites. What role do demons play in such a scenario? In John Chrysostom’s descriptions, demons are the force behind impressions that bom-bard the commanding faculties of Antioch’s Christians. Th is is their mode of unceasing temptation. At stake is the mind’s capacity to judge correctly and reject such impressions. Th e question of assent in this case then measures the distance between a true Christian (in his/her ability to resist) and a non-Christian (in his/her helpless capitulation).Finally, the materiality of Stoic theory facilitates John’s understanding of the mechanics of demonic corruption/affl iction as well as antidemonic ritual. His graphic images blur the line between demons and the Stoic notion of dispensing impressors that lead to impressions—either demons are the impressors or they are somehow attached to the impressors; it is diffi cult to say, as the text is ambiguous. Several of his passages portray demons as somehow materially embedded within the impressions themselves. Do demons infect the mind with corrupted matter? Or do demons inhabit the mind itself ? Or do they accomplish both? Whatever the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 57answer, John discovers in Stoic ideas a means whereby demons physically touch and possess the mind/soul. Th us, in all of his descriptions of the debilitating eff ects of non-Christian ritual and the rehabilitating effi cacy of Christian ritual, he culti-vates an ambiguous yet sophisticated interweaving of Stoic and demonological explanatory systems.CHRISTIANS UNDER SIEGEIn his baptismal instructions, John projects a bleak picture for the unbaptized Christians who live in Antioch. Demons target the mind or understanding faculty (dianoia),21 conscience (hēgemonikon), or soul (psychē) relentlessly. Should a bap-tizand venture into the marketplace, the devil will attempt to inject “examinations of one’s reasoning” (tōn logismōn zētēseis), which are antithetical to the Nicene church, directly into the candidate’s mind.22 Proselytizing Arians and Sabellians—all are carriers of the corrupting material.23 In so large a city, however, theological thought is not the only danger. Th e devil traffi cs in thoughtless discourse (hē dialexis anoētos),24 the idle word (ho argos logos), ill-timed silly talk (ho phlyaros akairos), and worldly discourse or arguing (hē biōtikē dialexis).25 Th ese can take place in numerous microenvironments throughout the city. John also warns against sounds at the theater, the hippodrome, and circus shows. All these places cultivate communication that conceals the traps of the wretched one (hē tou ponērou pagis);26 omens and oath taking that communicate non-Christian cos-mologies off er their own dangers. All in all, the devil inundates the city with his artifi ces (hē mēchanē tou ponērou diabolou)27 and diabolical deceits (tais apatais tais diabolikais).28 By the simple act of listening in the wrong place and during the wrong time, a person risks the possibility that demons will try to incite the pas-sions, and this will lead to immoral behavior. Luxuriousness (aselgeia) and drunk-enness move a person far from Christ. “Th oughts”—of an endless variety—are the devil’s wretched enticements (ta ponēra deleasmata tou diabolou).29 Th rough these he attempts to trip up (hyposkelizein) humanity.30Outside of the church, demons permeate the environment and wait. Th ey traf-fi c in corrupting thoughts, sounds, smells, and sights, thus depositing their demonic imprint almost eff ortlessly into the minds of unguarded Christians. Demons use every opportunity to darken our reason when Christians are not in church. In a passage in Homiliae in Matthaeum 11, John Chrysostom describes in material terms the soul’s revolving transformation as it moves back and forth between demonic city and divine church:Wipe out the letters (ta grammata) or rather the impressions (ta charagmata) that the devil has imprinted (enetypōse) in your soul, and bring me a heart freed from worldly disturbances that without dread I can write upon (eggrapsai). . . . When I receive your tablets, I am not able to recognize anything. For I do not fi nd the letters that we"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"58 John Chrysostom and Antiochinscribe on you every day; rather these that are his [letters], unintelligible and mis-shapen (asēma kai diestrammena). Th en when we have blotted them out and have written our own through the Spirit, you departing . . . give him again the power to substitute his own characters in you.31John’s images suggest to his listeners the ontological consequence of the demonic violence infl icted on their minds and souls every time they leave the church build-ing. Th e mind/soul is penetrated, injured, raped, mutilated, and scarred by demons; it transforms into a festering wound, a diseased and leprous entity.32 In an especially disturbing passage, John Chrysostom intertwines psychological images of the material degradation of an embodied soul (psychē) or a faculty of reasoning (logismon) with sexualized images of penetration and defi lement. In Hom. Matt. 42, John describes a tribunal where his concept of a disembodied “Self ” is sitting in judgment over the central aspect of him/herself: the faculty of reasoning (logis-mon) or soul (psychē). Th e two (logismon and psychē) confl ate and blur quickly in the passage; both are described as demonically compromised. Th e Self forces the logismon/psychē, which John genders female, to account for the “wretched” thoughts she has allowed inside. Th ese thoughts fester and even reproduce copies of themselves. She counters with excuses; it is the devil, she pleads: “He comes to me, he plots against me, he tempts me.”33 Likewise she defends herself, blaming her own embodiment: “I am entangled with a body, I am clothed with fl esh, I dwell in the world (sōmati sympeplegmai, sarka endedymai, kosmon oikō), I abide on earth.”34 John depicts the soul/conscience as a vulnerable female body, incapable of judging for herself, but also dangerously endowed with reproductive capabilities. He also describes the soul as a virgin daughter who requires Christians’ protec-tion. Rather than keep the devil from her, though, Christians have been all too careless with her purity:We force [the soul] to act as a prostitute and defi le herself (molynesthai), by leading into her innumerable wicked thoughts (ennoias ponēras). And whether it is our love of greed, or of luxury or of shining bodies or of anger . . . we throw open the doors, and draw in [such thoughts] and invite [them] and allow them to mix with her [our soul] without fear of reprisal . . . And what could be more barbaric than this, to over-look our soul that is more worthy than all, and allow her to be maltreated by such debauchers, , and so long in their company, even until they are sated? . . . [W]hen sleep overtakes us, only then do [the thoughts] leave her; or rather not even then, for our dreams and apparitions (phantasia) furnish her with the same images (eidōla). So then, when day has come, the soul stored with such fantasies oft en falls away to the actual performance of those fancies (hē toiauta phantazomenē psychē kai eis to ergon tōn phantasiōn ekeinōn pollakis exepese).35Th ese passages reveal important aspects of John’s demonology and indicate how tightly he weaves it into his material conception of personhood and subject-"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 59hood.36 By identifying thought as one of the primary vehicles of demonic corrup-tion, John describes a model of Self trapped in a perpetual state of cognitive and moral ambiguity. What are one’s own thoughts? What are those of the devil? In the second passage, he heightens that anxiety by suggesting a person’s accidental, but also almost inevitable, complicity in his/her own downfall.By feminizing the soul/reasoning faculty (psychē/logismon), John characterizes these two entities as embodied, naturally weak, vulnerable, and suggestible. John also implies an uncontrollable fertility inherent within this doubled entity. Not only is “she” (i.e., psychē/logismon) a guileless object, she is also easily seduced by the devil, who seeds her eagerly with his wretched thoughts (ennoias ponēras); psychē/logismon also readily reproduces the devil’s fantasies through her body’s own immoral actions—actions that will become ingrained habits. But John does not only off er frighteningly suggestive descriptions of devils and demons sexually assaulting a guileless female soul. In a chilling manner, Chrysostom also presents the reasoning faculty within the Christian Self as the most harmful caretaker of the soul imagina-ble. Rather than jealously protecting the soul’s innocence, the caretaker demon-strates a despicable latitude and prostitutes the soul/mind. In this collection of images, then, John amplifi es the demonic threat dramatically: a Christian’s inatten-tion to the processes of sensory perception and assessment is tantamount to partici-pating in the demonic seduction, rape, and impregnation of the soul.Th e church alone can provide the necessary moral defenses against such attacks; the church can direct a Christian to the sacred places and through its sanctifying activities provide sanctuary for the soul/mind from demonic violence. Only the church performs rituals that forge a defi nitive, implacable boundary between a Christian’s mind and demons seeking to ravage the psychē/logismon again and again with impure thoughts. Baptism, the Eucharist, and other Nicene rituals work to fortify rational thought and free will; sacramental and ecclesiastical rituals pow-erfully establish true Christian epistēmē in the mind of a Christian—in fact, these rituals are the only sure means of doing so. John thus situates sacramental rituals as a kind of ecclesiastical prophylactic: baptism and the Eucharist allow a Chris-tian to return to the world of unmonitored social intercourse in the streets of Antioch—provided, of course, that that Christian always returns to the church to receive the Eucharist or undergo some other cleansing exorcistic ritual.37 Ulti-mately, as we will see, John describes baptism as a means of guarding the soul and/or the mind when it is engulfed in a demonic whirlwind. In other words, baptism provides antidemonic protection in a defensive sense. But baptism and the Eucha-rist provide suffi cient power for an off ensive attack against demons as well. Under their title “soldiers of Christ,” according to John, baptized Christians can and should take the antidemonic power made available to them through baptism and the Eucharist and use it to attack the demons in and around Antioch and drive the devil from their city."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"60 John Chrysostom and AntiochBut congregants resist the church’s guidance. Th ey make their own ritual and behavioral choices. According to John, it is Christians whose minds are already demonically compromised who participate in the Maiumas, Kalends, and the Jew-ish Feast of Trumpets; they engage in healing rituals in incubation shrines and invite itinerant healers and dream interpreters into their homes; they consult auguries about their future and purchase curse tablets against their enemies. In these ritual events, staged and orchestrated by the devil, demons’ infl uence over a Christian’s mind deepens to the point that the person loses his or her identity and sense of Self altogether.John needs to compel people to the baptismal bath. At least they have to with-draw from their ritual lives outside the church. Consequently, John creates vivid, arresting images of everyday ritual life in Antioch: celebrating weddings, making business oaths, healing a sick child, participating in the Jewish High Holidays, attending the theater. All of these events and activities are readily familiar to his audience. As John paints these daily moments in words, the vivid details of the images draw his audience closer; so close, in fact, that he can reveal suddenly the alarming diff erences in his view of their life outside the church. He sheds light on what his congregants fail or refuse to see: devils and demons write the wedding songs; they make actresses’ bodies more alluring and chorus boys’ voices more seductive; demons give fevers to mothers’ little boys and then empower the heal-ing amulets off ered by rabbis and old drunken hags; demons stand behind the omens and prognostications in the Kalends’ nighttime festivities.Should John manage to overwhelm his listeners with the full reality of their ritual life, he will by no means leave them in despair. In his baptismal instructions as elsewhere, he indeed peels back the surface layer of life to expose a raging demonic infection that courses through the city’s veins. He also, however, explains in depth what baptism has to off er to Christians while they still remain on earth, walking through the plague-fi lled streets of Antioch. Th e baptismal seal is an indomitable weapon; it possesses “the strength of a wonderful amulet and a potent incantation.”38 “Call upon that name [Jesus] and every disease will fl ee, every attack of Satan will cease”.39 Likewise, the baptismal formulae (apotaxis and syn-taxis) are intended for a kind of oral warfare against both man and demon in the public spheres of the city, as he expresses to the newly baptized:Never go out without this word. Th is will be a staff for you, this your armor, this an unbreachable tower; and with this word impress the sign of the cross on your fore-head. For not only any man, but neither the devil himself will be able to pervert/damage you in any way, when seeing you everywhere appearing with these weapons.40In what follows, we will fi rst survey John’s narratives of the diabolized rituals per-vading Antioch.

Th e virginal bride who has been “schooled in modesty from earliest child-hood” and raised in secluded isolation is suddenly thrust into the public by the custom (synētheia) of postwedding festivities.41 Th e devil himself has created the nighttime frivolities for the specifi c purpose of capturing the well-hidden and pro-tected bride, putting her on display, and processing her through the marketplace. Th ere she is exposed to the most foul language and song: “Dancing, and cymbals, and fl utes, and shameful words (rhēmata kai aismata aischra) and songs, and drunkenness, and reveling, and all the devil’s great heap (polys ho tou diabolou phorytos) of garbage is then introduced.”42 As she has become a kind of “stage spectacle,” an object of lust for all to see, the unsullied virgin is now also vulnerable to their pollution:[Th e bride] fi nd[s] herself put forward in the midst of wanton and rude men, and unchaste, and eff eminate [men] . . . runaway slaves and convicts: thousands of them and of desperate characters go on with impunity uttering whatever they please, all base and full of indecency. In fact there is a sort of diabolic rivalry among transgres-sors to surpass one another in reproaches and foul words.43Th e bride and fellow Antiochenes participates in the festivities without a sec-ond thought, indiff erent to or unaware of any danger. Th is is because, in John’s words, “the devil has embedded the thing in customs (en synētheiai to pragma katekleisen ho diabolos).”44 John must reveal to them the devil’s ritual manipula-tions if they are ever to wake from the deadening eff ects of what they harmlessly refer to as custom or tradition. To that end, John provides historical background: the devil is aware that the ritual of marriage was expressly created to preserve the bride’s cleanliness. Marriage is intended to obstruct the fl ood of porneia from entering the nubile virgin’s body. Th e devil, eager to fi nd a way around this obsta-cle, ingeniously devised the customs of night revelry, which put her body on dis-play “like a stage spectacle” and thus created an opportunity to penetrate her with his demonic impurity (porneia).As John explains, custom (synētheia) or law (nomos) is the devil’s favored tool to defl ect Christians from thinking about their actions. People unrefl ectively allow their bodies to relax into what they assume to be ageless and trustworthy patterns of behavior, when in reality it is quite something else. Th rough the installation of ancient custom—in this case, the night festival—the devil has established an effi -cient choreography for defi lement that moves Antiochene brides steadily from the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"62 John Chrysostom and Antiochritual of marriage to its consummation in the wedding bed. For a few hours in between, a public procession exposes the bride’s body: she is lit up with torches and conducted on a circuitous route from her father’s house through the market-place to her husband’s. Her open ears are soon full of “disorderly songs, with their foul words, with their devilish harmony,” her body vulnerable to the salacious caress of every lustful eye.45 John describes the crowd’s fi lthy words and songs pen-etrating the bride’s mind and soul, evoking images of sexual assault; similarly, as their collective male gaze violently ravages the bride’s body, men appear to defi le her virginity repeatedly long before she reaches the intimacy of her wedding bed. KalendsIn Homilia in Kalendas, John exposes the dangers lurking within the joyous, diverting festivities of the New Year: “diabolical nighttime festivities in the forum . . . the jests, the abuse, and the nocturnal dances (diaboliakai pannuxides tēmeron, kai ta skōmmata, kai ai loidoriai choreiai)” catalyze the basest instincts in a human being because it is actually “demons [who are] leading a procession in the market-place (alla daimonōn pompeusantōn epi tēs agoras).”46 Demons are also responsible for the frenzied decorating competition that takes place in the artisan and resident quarters; John laments that if people will only devote the same time and energy decorating (kallōpizein) the intellect (dianoia) and soul, they will attract very dif-ferent, more benefi cial spiritual company. He describes the angels, archangels, and master of angels who will cluster near them, crowding out any possibility of demons gaining an unfortunate proximity.47Of particular interest, John targets a handful of activities in one of his more coherent and thorough discussions of the devil’s strategy of intellectual enerva-tion. During the New Year’s festivities, people visit taverns to consult omens and auguries. In addition to these forms of divination, they also engage in the observa-tion of days and the celebration of the new moon. All are “diabolical nighttime festivities” with “demons [who are] leading a procession in the marketplace.”48 Moreover, they are devices created by the devil himself. Th e devil realizes, accord-ing to John, that such activities off er a great way to intentionally derail people’s eff orts to make good of their day: living under the “cycles of the moons, [and] planets” relieves people of responsibility as well as accountability in their daily actions; this is yet another example of the devil’s eff orts “to extinguish the progress (prothymian) of the soul.”49 “For that wretched demon (ho ponēros daimōn) schemes these things, wishing to draw our souls into impiety (asebeian), and lazi-ness (rhathymian).”50 Furthermore, Christians embroiled in such activities slowly forget the larger, wider, all-encompassing “city above,” “the polity” to which they now actually belong—where they might “mingle with angels where light does not give way to darkness, nor day fulfi lled to night, but [where it] is always day, always light.”51"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 63If someone has any memory of true citizenship, John insists that he or she “must fl ee from the methods of the devil (tou diabolou tas methodeias), and cast out this infl uence of thought (tautēn ekbalein tēs dianoias tēn psēphon), and observe not the days.”52 In other words, people will have to refrain from participat-ing in the Kalends festival altogether if they are to have any hope of retaining control over their thought and rationality.Th eaterIn Homiliae in Ioannem 60, John off ers a vivid description of the dangers the spec-tacles of the theater pose to a male audience:[You have] seen those women on the stage, and [the male audience], aft er taking infi nite attacks from them, will seem no better than a tossing sea, when an impres-sion (typos) of [the women’s] faces, the gestures, the speeches, the walk, and all the rest stand before their eyes and besiege their soul.53Blake Leyerle has perceptively noted how Stoic theories of vision and cognition guide John Chrysostom’s depiction of a male audience’s gendered disintegration. Th e male spectator is materially aff ected/tainted by a stage performer’s image as he watches her lascivious spectacle: Christian men “[pollute] their own eyes’ sight, and together with their own eyesight, their soul.”54 Female sexual images of an almost aggressive masculinity emanate from the stage performer’s body and impress themselves on the soul or rational faculty of the male viewer. Th is lustful image, lodged in the man’s soul, stokes the fl ames of desire (epithymia), and he is completely helpless in a complicit unraveling of his own gender’s only apparent solidity. Chaotic irrational passion takes hold. Th e male spectator accepts enslave-ment to the lascivious object of his gaze. In this single optic event, an unnatural hierarchy emerges: an authoritative, sexualized female image rises in the mind of the male spectator to assume the position of masculine domination that the spec-tator/victim relinquishes as his will and gendered identity melt away. At all costs a man who encounters such a gendered monstrosity should, at the very least, look the other way. Otherwise, his debilitation will reach deep within domestic terri-tory and rip apart the delicate fabric of familial hierarchies and power relations. Aft er looking upon her and listening to her, a man will return home with his soul enslaved, emasculated, and fetally wrapped around the embedded image of an actress that he can never have in real life. In John’s words, his soul is “fl uttered and perturbed,” actually tied and bound to the desire (epithymia) to see her again: “Th ey depart, set on fi re, and enter into their own houses, captives.”55 He asks rather pessimistically: “How will you look upon your wife?”56Leyerle has already carefully explained the manner in which John Chrysostom commingles concepts of sexual subversion, ancient optics, and the gendered dynamics of the gaze in a depiction of a Christian’s moral lapse and the resulting"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"64 John Chrysostom and Antiochontological changes that occur due to his corruption. We would draw attention only to how John also inserts the devil into these descriptions. In a particularly illuminating passage in Hom. Matt. 7, John identifi es the amphitheater as the devil’s and characterizes a water show featuring naked female swimmers as the “fountain of the devil” and “the devil’s net.”57 Most importantly, John speaks openly and mechanistically about the devil’s manipulation of the salacious images emanating from female bodies and how those images cultivate a corrosive, even deadly, epi-thymia in the male Christian mind. Th e passage displays some important parallels with John’s discussion in Hom. Matt. 11 (discussed above) of the demonic assault on a female soul. Th ere, too, John envisages the devil’s thoughts (sexually) penetrating and thus transforming a vulnerable and unprotected soul. Even before the prom-ised event of naked female swimmers, the devil titillates the Christian in his dreams:For in the fi rst place, through a whole night the devil preoccupies their souls with the expectation of [the spectacle of the theater]; then aft er showing them what they are anticipating, he binds them at once and makes them captives (edēsen euthys kai aich-malotous epoiēse). For do not think that because you have not been mixed with a prostitute (emigēs tēi pornēi), you are clean from sin; for by desiring it preemptively (prothymiai), you have committed it. For if you are possessed by desire (hypo epithy-mias katexē), you have kindled the fl ame greater (meizona tēn phloga anēpsas).58John fashions the devil as the ultimate magician, casting erotic spells into men’s souls while they sleep. By invading men’s dreams the devil and demons tether them to their own generated desire: in a sense the inserted demonic image acts as bind-ing spell that can self-perpetuate without end. Th is conceptualization of a material corruption, which one suff ers here in the theater, appears in other passages as well. In Hom. Matt. 37, John intensifi es the gendered subversion of the stage:A young man wears his hair long behind, changing his clothes so that he changes his nature into that of a woman to take on the appearance of a tender young woman, striving both in aspect and in gesture. . . . [T]he women, . . . their heads uncovered, stand boldly, speaking with a whole people, so complete is their practice in shame-lessness; and thus they pour forth all impurity into the souls of their hearers.59In this mix of “satanic cries” and “devilish gestures,” John adds, it is “the devil [who] is pouring out for you so much of the strong wine of whoredom, mingling so many cups of unchastity.”60 Following this visual display, John issues an intrigu-ing warning:Th e sorcerers (goētes) too. Where are they? Is it not from [the theater] that in order to excite the people who are idling without object and make the dancing men have the benefi t of much and loud applause, and fortify pornai against those who live in moderation (sōphronousais), they proceed so far in sorcery (magganeias) as not even to shrink from disturbing the bones of the dead.61"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 65What John is describing is akin to erotic magic, though the sorcery in this case is adapted to a commercial purpose rather than personal lust. Erotic magic fi nds root in the principles of the binding spell (katadesmos): that is, the invocation of demonic and supernatural entities for the purpose of binding an individual’s lust to another person, and even augmenting it. Th us John suggests here that those who attend the theater may not be demon possessed when they are watching the spectacle; rather, through a form of magical means, demons bind unsuspecting, vulnerable male spectators to a morally corrosive image. Moreover, in mentioning goētes who practice necromantic magic or magganeias—in other words, a practice that involves “disturbing the bones of the dead”—John is describing the most hei-nous forms of magic, punishable by death.Th e Dangers of DaphneAccording to John, the devil took Daphne long ago:Th e enemy of our salvation, who always perverts the fi gures of God, occupied the site beforehand with a crowd of dissolute youths and the abodes of the demons [i.e., temples], and then bestowed on it a certain shameful myth, by means of which he dedicated the graceful suburb to the demon.62Th e devil has methodically subverted Daphne, transforming it from a place of beauty and tranquility into a land and landscape that perpetuates a form of debauched immorality. He has cleverly seduced “young libertines” to come to the suburb and then “wishing to intensify this evil invented the myth and installed the demon [Apollo] so that this history would be greater fuel for their licentiousness and impiety.”63 Th e myth of which John speaks of course involves Apollo’s pursuit of Daphne, and the demon who has been given authority over the suburb is Apollo himself.John also celebrates the brief chapter in Daphne’s history in which the martyr Babylas came to reside next to Apollo’s temple and miraculously silenced the demon. More importantly still, the mere sight of the martyr had had a sobering eff ect on the suburb as a whole. Consequently, Christians wisely placed the shrine of Babylas near the entrance of the suburb so that just when people came into Daphne they would be “chastened and [become] more pious by the sight” of the martyr’s shrine.64 By naming the faculty of sight as the means of a person’s moral transformation and degradation, John deliberately and meticulously constructs the reverse process of the demonic unraveling that takes hold of a spectator in the theater:When a depraved and licentious person becomes moderate in his behavior, it is as miraculous as recovery from complete insanity. . . . For while youth, recklessness, irrationality, and wine may overcome one’s thinking more extensively than a fl ame, the dew of the blessed one, coming down through the eyes and into the soul of those"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"66 John Chrysostom and Antiochwho see him, [puts] the fl ame to sleep, [stops] the fi re, and [establishes] an over-whelming godly fear in the mind.65Elsewhere, John describes “an imperceptible breeze” that surrounds the martyr’s shrine, then and now.66 It penetrates the souls of those drawn to the shrine. Th is breeze then cleanses the demonically contorted soul in a particular manner: “Ordering it [the soul] decorously in all respects and removing every earthly weight, [it] renews and lightens the heavy-laden and downcast soul.”67 Th ough few traveling to Daphne come to see the saint, Babylas is adept at “lay[ing] a trap” so that they are “caught in a net” of spiritual healing.68Th is all comes to an end in Daphne, however, with the removal of Babylas’s body to the cemetery outside of Antioch at the time of Julian’s visit in 362 and its eventual relocation in the Meletian church in Antioch in 380. Aft er 362, according to John, the famous martyr abandoned the suburb to the devil. And any who travel now to the suburb of Daphne do so at a considerable risk to their souls’ eternal salvation. In De sancto hieromartyre Babyla, written in 377 or 379, John lays heavy emphasis on the diabolization of Daphne’s landscape.During the fi rst day of celebrations for the martyr cult of Julian, being held somewhere outside of Antioch, John denounces a festival in Daphne that will take place the next day. He warns his audience of the alluring bodies of the young male mimes who will happily crowd the streets of Daphne. His description of the festi-val lays out his understanding of how the devil manipulates men’s bodies and voices to seduce any who see them. Even those listening to John at that moment are not safe:Choruses of men take over the suburb [Daphne] tomorrow. Oft en the sight of such choruses compels the person who wants to be sober into copying the same indecent behavior against their will. . . . [Th e devil] is present, summoned by the earthly songs, by the shameless words, by the demonic pageantry.69John portrays male dancers’ “demonic pageantry” in a manner that echoes his diabolization of other performing bodies (e.g., the women on lascivious display in the theater). Both Daphne’s male chorus and Antioch’s notorious actresses pose a sensory threat to audiences; in each case, demon driven bodies emit an endless stream of lewd images and sounds that penetrate a spectator’s faculties of vision and hearing and corrode the soul. Th ere is, however, an important, but subtle, dif-ference here that invites further comment. Rather than reducing the spectator to a possessed and passive being enslaved to desire, as we see in his descriptions of the theater, John describes the conversion of the spectator at Daphne into an active participant. Th ose watching will eventually assume the same debauched and licen-tious character that is on view in the male chorus: “Oft en the sight of such cho-ruses seduces even the person who wants to be sober into copying the same inde-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 67cent behavior against their will.” John intends this description to leave his audience wondering what other diabolic festivals take place in Daphne that may endanger Christians. Should they even set foot on the suburb’s devil-soaked soil now that Babylas rests so far from it?Jewish High Holidays and the SynagogueIn the early autumn of 386 and 387, the fasts, festivals, and celebrations of the Jew-ish High Holidays are draining his congregation of its numbers. During this time, John paints the Jewish rituals as demonic creations that easily lure weaker Chris-tians away from the safety of his congregation. In Adv. Jud. 2, John criticizes Chris-tian husbands who neglect the spiritual care of their wives during this time in particular and have not tried to revive them from their “frivolous indiff erence.”70 Th ese women have become easy prey, chasing the bait off ered by any authoritative voice. Th e devil easily intervenes to sever these female bodies from their male counterparts, as John notes:When the devil calls the wives to the Feast of Trumpets, you do not restrain them as they readily listen to him. You allow them to be seized in accusations of impiety (asebeia); you allow them to be carried off into licentiousness (akolasia).71At the Feast of Trumpets, according to John, Christian wives are surrounded by “prostitiutes and eff eminates and every chorus of dancers.”72 Most importantly, they are surrounded by demons: “Did you fail to hear the reasoning in my last discourse that demonstrated to us clearly that demons inhabit the very souls of Jews and the places in which they come together?”73 Women, then, are precari-ously open to the demonic contagion that is available at the Jewish festivals and that John confi gures in sexual, moral, and theological terms. Th e demons of trans-gression that reside in the Jewish “Christ killers” also dance with wayward Chris-tian wives at the festivals, and John expresses his deep and understandable con-cern: “Are you not afraid that your wife will come back from there aft er a demon has taken her?”74Th us John is equally resolute that Christians not come anywhere near the syna-gogue. He characterizes the building repeatedly as a visible public monument that exudes a demonic presence. Th e diabolized structure draws to it all abandoned by God and embraced by the devil:Th ere where a prostitute has established herself, that place is a brothel. Not only is the synagogue a brothel and a theater, it also is a destination of robbers and a lodging for wild animals. For Jeremiah said: “Your house has become for me the den of a hyena.” He does not simply say “of a wild beast,” but “of a unclean animal.” But again he says, “I have abandoned my house, I have cast off my inheritance.” But when God aban-dons a people, what hope of salvation remains? When God leaves a place, that place becomes one that demons inhabit.75"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"68 John Chrysostom and AntiochFinally, John has had personal experience supporting his claims regarding syn-agogue malevolence. In Adv. Jud. 1.3.4, he interrupts his fl ow of thought to intro-duce an encounter he had had a few days earlier. Chrysostom had seen two people struggling in front of a synagogue in Antioch. Both are Christian, though, as we will discover, each is of a very diff erent Christian caliber: the woman is baptized; the man, a much weaker Christian, most certainly is not. John relates how the woman had called desperately for help while the man appeared to be dragging her into the synagogue against her will. Aft er John rescues the woman, he eventually discovers that the man is trying to force the woman into the synagogue to swear a business oath, because people have informed him that oaths sworn at the syna-gogue are far more to be feared than those sworn anywhere else. John seems to associate her baptismal identity with her ethical and moral characterization. Despite these strong qualities, however, John still depicts the isolated female as no match for the man who has brought her there. John describes him as a perversely inclined and demonically driven Christian male. Seduced by the devil, the man has attempted to overpower the woman and drag her into the synagogue against her will. John describes the man as completely out of control and acting irration-ally. Th e female “believer” is helpless, begging for rescue but incapable of liberat-ing herself from the more powerful, demonically contaminated male. She begs John to stop the “lawless violence (tēn anomon bian).”76 He reacts in an equally violent manner: “I was on fi re with indignation. I became angry. I rose up. I refused to let her be dragged into that transgression (tēn paranomian). I snatched her from the hands of her abductor.”77 In John’s carefully constructed image, the fact of reli-gious violation and ritual transgression is mixed with the suggestion of sexual vio-lation. John’s rousing rhetoric must have left his audience shuddering, if only momentarily, at the thought of what this modest woman’s fate would have been if he had not passed by. When the man fi nally comes to his senses and is asked why he has dragged the woman to the synagogue, he explains that he has heard that the synagogue is a more powerful place to make oaths. In other words, John names the devil as the puppet master behind the man’s irrational thinking and behavior and concludes that “the uninitiated/unaccomplished of the Christians (atelesterous Xristianous)” are all too easily frightened, like little children.78 John manipulates both of these narratives to disclose the deadly, frightening power that Jewish ritu-als hold over simpleminded and, I would propose, unbaptized Christians. Inevita-bly such rituals manage to lure all of the weaker, unbaptized Christians into the “shrines of men who have been rejected, dishonored, and condemned”—and thus into a “place that demons inhabit.”79He designs both narratives to prompt listeners to ask the question, What will simpleminded Christians carry with them once they leave the “dwelling places of demons” and return inevitably to the church? In his depiction of the Christian wife drawn to the Feast of Trumpets, John incites his listeners to imagine a wide range"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 69of pollution possibilities. Scholars have observed that literary depictions of a wom-an’s sexual pollution do not express excessive concern for the fate of the woman herself. Rather, she functions metaphorically as the external pollution’s means of entry into the oikos, and by extension the politeia.80 As we might suspect, then, although John expresses concern for these wives, he is more concerned that they can carry a demon (or demonic contagion) into the Christian household/community. As he extrapolates in a rhetorical address to the women themselves (quoted more fully below), “Please explain to me, then, how do you have the bold-ness, aft er dancing with demons, to come back to the gathering of the apostles?”81 John is trying to protect the community’s integrity. Obedient congregants should not have to face a Jewish contagion smuggled illicitly into their homes in the bod-ies of religiously promiscuous wives. Whatever passes into an individual Judaizing body can easily slip further into an unaware Christian community. Such is the nature of demonic possession, expanding quickly from an initial and contained manifestation in a single Judaizer to a plague of immorality and malevolence over-taking an entire community. Th us John is resolute in his insistence that such indi-viduals be kept out of the church.It would be shortsighted to suggest that John’s concern is limited to maintaining the purity of the community. More importantly, in both narratives he is intent on safeguarding the ritual purity of the sacraments of the church. In Adv. Jud. 2, the devil lures wives to the synagogue and sites of Jewish celebration, where they min-gle with people through Jewish (diabolizing) ritual practices. John portrays the scene in a lewd manner. He vividly suggests the potential for a kind of sexualized/demonic assault. In such locations, through heedless Judaizing, the wife can easily contract a demonic pollution. John’s direct address to the wife is of particular interest:How do you have the boldness, aft er dancing with demons, to come back to the com-munity of the apostles? Aft er you have gone out and joined together those who shed the blood of Christ, how do you come back and share with us in his sacred banquet, and partake of his precious blood? Do you not shiver? Are you not afraid when you commit such outrages? Have you so little respect for this very banquet?82Th e similarities to 2 Corinthians 10 are clear: do not share a table with demons and expect to return to the church and be able to take part in the Eucharist. John frames the Feast of Trumpets as the devil’s best ritual setting and scenario for a Christian to pick up a demonic infection and eventually carry it to Christ’s table. During these events those who “shed the blood of Christ” and are now infested with demons might mix with Christian bodies and pass on their demonic conta-gion to the Christian community. At that point, how easily might this demonic contagion spread to the souls of the baptized and then corrupt the eucharistic blood?

An unbaptized Judaizer must be kept outside the church doors. But if that person is “a believer and already initiated,” she must be “driven from the holy table.”83In both narratives (the baptized woman and the wayward wife), John exposes what he sees as the diabolic intent and demonic ontology of Jewish ritual. He por-trays oath taking and the Feast of Trumpets as traps luring weak-minded Chris-tians (i.e., women), who are then contaminated and sent out to spread their demonic contagion to other Christians in an attempt to infect one of the most sacred Christian rituals. Th us John introduces these events not to delegitimate or negate the power inherent in Jewish ritual. Rather, he suggests that Jewish rituals are extremely powerful—and threatening because of that power. Demons have overtaken Jewish rituals and transformed them into a dark, perverse power through which they seduce and demonically corrupt Christians. In this way, demons attempt to do nothing less than infect and pollute the very core of sacra-mental Christian practice.REMEDIADisease, poverty, famine, natural disasters, imperial rule, and war conspire against the health and longevity of everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. Constan-tine passes a law that recognizes these hardships in an interesting way. Marking a divide between illicit magic and healing remedia, Codex Th eodosianus 9.16.3 (319 CE) condemns “the science (scientia) of those men who are equipped with magical arts (magicis accincti artibus).”84 Individuals discovered to have harmed anyone are punished severely. But then the law starkly deviates, authorizing non-Christian remedia intended for the healing of human bodies. Th e law also shelters ritual actions protecting against natural disasters. At the beginning of the fourth century, then, imperial law essentially legalizes ritual remedia. As the fourth century progresses, however, Christian rituals increasingly gain a fi rm footing in public spaces. Ecclesiastical rituals spill from the church to the street in stational liturgies; martyr cults move from distant cemeteries to crowd the city center. And remedia soon come under increasing suspicion.85As noted in chapter 1, John diabolizes a handful of such ritual practices. In John’s view, many of the small and mobile activities, such as incantational prayers, incubational practices, and amulets manufactured by healers, pose a threat to ecclesiastical authority. Practices oft en take place in private, enclosed spaces; in many cases itinerant healers perform these rituals in a Christian domestic sphere—an environment not yet colonized by ecclesiastical authority. Furthermore, this realm of ritual practice pertains primarily to to those who tend to the sick—in other words, women.

He is quite clear both here in Hom. Col. 8 as well as in Cateche-sis ad illuminandos 12 that none of these “devices” are needed; people should trust only in Christ’s cross and rely solely on the sign of the cross for healing:Do you not realize what an incredible result the Cross has achieved? Is it not some-thing that can be trusted for the body’s health? It has elevated the entire world. And are you unable to take courage in it?89To open the private, unregulated ritual spaces of the home to an itinerant healer is one of the most dangerous things one can do. John claims that one risks nothing less than Christian salvation in extending such a foolish invitation. To make his point he presents a particularly familiar ritual fi gure, an elderly female healer, whom he describes in derogatory terms as a “drunken old hag.” By referring to her in this manner, John deliberately sets her in alignment with female magic workers in Greco-Roman literary accounts. Ridicule is certainly an eff ective and rhetori-cally favored means of undermining her authority.John is disconcerted by what can happen when people untrained and uniniti-ated in ecclesiastical orders administer Christian ritual healing. Th is “drunken old hag” claims to have authority based on her own Christian status. She uses only God’s name in her prayers. But according to John, her ambivalent ritual status and charismatic authority leaves her open to other forces. Th us he declares, predictably:It is for this reason that I especially hate and turn away from her, because she inso-lently misuses the name of God. . . . For even the demons invoked the name of God, but still they were demons.90John’s warnings are stern: a desperate mother’s acceptance of the healing rituals that a so-called fellow Christian off ers can spark a grave cosmological crisis in a Christian household: “Th e Cross is certainly dishonored; these charms (gram-mata) preferred before it. Christ is cast out.”91 More frightening still, Christianity’s future rests on inevitable moments of female weakness. When a mother or a nurse seeks this kind of healing for a sick child, “Christ is cast out, and a drunken old woman is brought in. Our mystery has been trodden upon as the devil dances.”92 Th e implicit message regarding Christological ritual speech and ritual action is clear: any speech or action involving or indicating Christ will ward off the devil—"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"72 John Chrysostom and Antioche.g., Creed, baptismal formulae, statement of joining with Christ (syntagē), sign of the cross. Th ese ritual acts comprise very powerful, cosmogonic elements in lan-guage and gesture. Yet the rituals take place in a sensory environment in which demons hold sway; thus Christological speech and action require an ecclesiastical agent, someone divinely initiated and prepared to participate. Demons cluster around the edges of the spoken name of God and any ritual speech involved in transforming a human being from an unbaptized to baptized status; demons wait avidly for the unbaptized and the unordained or simply those unprepared in some measure who invoke these formulae improperly.John also addresses the topic of remedia in his Adversus Judaeos homilies. In the case of fever, sickness, and disease, congregants go to the synagogue—a place of notable holy power—to seek amuletic healing. His reaction to the Jewish healers who manufacture amulets is similar to his attack on female healers who enter the home. Demons are involved in the practices of ritual healing; in fact they oft en cause the illness in order to seduce the sick into using magical cures. To accept such healing endangers the soteriological “healing” Christ has established in the incarnation, crucifi xion, and resurrection. But John’s descriptions of drunken old hags diff ers from his attack against Jewish healers in one essential respect. Aside from a brief mention in Adv. Jud. 8 of Jews who are “sorcerers and dealers in witch-craft ” and mendaciously off er amulets, incantations, charms, and spells to the suf-fering, human ritualists quickly fade from the images he creates.93 Instead, John encourages his listeners to imagine demons bleeding darkly through a translucent Jewish skin:I wish [demons] would not kill men’s bodies, that [demons] would not plot against men. But they will. Th e demons cast men from Paradise and deprived them of honor from above. Will [demons] cure their bodies? Th at is ridiculous, mere stories. Th e demons know how to plot and do harm, not to cure. Will you cure your body and destroy your soul?94John never declares that Jews are complicit in the demons’ eff orts to seduce Chris-tians with Jewish healing magic. Nor does John identify which rituals are involved. He speaks in intentionally vague terms regarding the actual practices and ritual objects; understandably, this has induced several scholars to suspect the historicity of such Jewish remedia. Despite the vague nature of John’s descriptions, he is clear on a few key points that are consistent with his demonology elsewhere. Demonic agency and duplicitous purpose stand behind the promise of some kinds of Jewish (i.e., non-Christian) ritual healing. Likewise, in John’s view the rituals themselves may actually work, which makes them all the more appealing. Jewish/demonic rituals may cool fevers, heal wounds, and cure disease, but at what cost to the soul? John expresses the diabolic danger that hides deep within an apparent gift of ritual healing:"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 73Even if the Jews seem to bring comfort to your fever with their incantations (epōidais), they are not relieving it.

With what kind of conscience (syneidos) will you actually enter the church? With what kind of eyes will you look at the priest? With what hands will you touch the sacred banquet? With what ears will you listen to the reading of the scriptures there?95In this passage John positions Jewish ritual healing as diametrically opposed to Christian ritual. He does so in a manner that not only contrasts Jewish and Chris-tian rituals, but also draws into focus the unsustainable paradox in the embodied identity of the person who attempts to engage in both. John portrays a conscience that labors to maintain a grip on a quickly fragmenting Christian identity that struggles against interior treacherous forces urging such transgressive ritual action. Th is passage also reminds us of the conscience’s struggle with the soul in Hom. Matt. 42, discussed above. Here, rather than battling dangerous thoughts, the con-stituent aspects of the Self struggle over the prospect of engaging in dangerous rit-ual behavior. Aft er partaking in Jewish ritual, according to John, a person is in danger of transforming into a foreign, unknown entity. What ears, what eyes, what hands are now partaking of the Eucharist? Is this body still comprised of the assem-bled parts of a baptized Christian? Or is this a soul destroyed, transformed into a demonic vessel that moves into the intimate parts of the church and pollutes the holiest of Christian rituals? Synagogues are dwelling places of demons. Jews them-selves are dwelling places of demons. How many Jewish rituals can a Christian engage in before transforming the church itself into a dwelling place of demons?EXORCISM AND BAPTISM: TURNING THE TABLES IN A DIABOLIC CITYIn his baptismal instructions John Chrysostom declares that an unbaptized Chris-tian is fi lled with demons. His or her mind is “a deserted inn without a door,” “a refuge for wild beasts, a dwelling place for demons.”96 John places the blame squarely on the city of Antioch. Th e unbaptized soul (psychē) and mind, or more properly reasoning faculty (dianoia), is a fl awed, deformed entity. It has been sub-jected to Antioch’s diabolic materiality in the city’s theaters, hippodrome, baths, synagogues, marketplaces, pagan shrines, temples, statues, and heretical churches. Slowly, steadily, the soul/mind transforms into a “wrinkled,” “spotted,” “ugly,” and “deformed” monstrosity.97 Th erefore John insists that baptizands separate them-selves as much as possible from this spiritually deforming environment during their ritual preparation before baptism.98"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"74 John Chrysostom and AntiochWhile John Chrysostom’s descriptions are fragmentary, they nonetheless pro-vide valuable and intriguing insight into his theorization of the devil’s means of corrupting souls and minds, means that tie in directly to the social and topo-graphical contexts of Antioch and Daphne; according to John, the media of demonic corruption and/or divine cleansing revolve notably around the practices of speech and language. Moreover, John ties speech practices directly to the recov-ery of the soul/mind. For the remainder of this chapter, we will explore how John Chrysostom constructs his ritual process of baptism. Particular focus will fall upon his quite powerful ontological and cosmological theorization of language and the transformative power of sacramental and scriptural words that he sets specifi cally in the urban sphere. As we laid out in the fi rst half of this chapter, John portrays a demonological pathology specifi cally tied to the city of Antioch. In his baptismal instructions, then, he proposes verbal tactics (as well as behavioral dis-positions) of spiritual warfare: a baptized Christian vies with bodiless powers through “bold speech” (parrhēsia).99As a pre-Cartesian church father living in the enchanted world of late antiquity, John does not “psychologize” or reduce the demonic to a mere rhetorical tool in order to impress on his congregants the importance of moral probity. Rather, if a baptizand speaks with the devil’s language, according to John, he or she damages and deforms his or her soul. Here I again have in mind the crucial observations of Gregory A. Smith. In the recent, theoretically sophisticated scholarship on demon-ology and asceticism/monasticism, Smith recognizes a tendency, even now, to neglect or sideline the physical character of the demon in favor of an overriding interest in the discursive “topos” of demon.100 Th e tendency to overlook the palpa-ble materiality of the demonic is part and parcel of a literary-critical as well as a psychoanalytical approach to the interpretation of demonology and asceticism in general.101 For this reason specifi cally (i.e., scholars’ post-Cartesian neglect of—or discomfort with—the issue of demonic materiality), I have chosen the intertwined perspectives of cultural history and anthropology to preside in our interpretation. Th is allows a focus on the effi cacy of ritual practice and the body (and the embod-ied) in an enchanted worldview.Aft er catechumens have passed through the initial rite of entry into the catechu-menate, priests and exorcists turn to the task of repairing and reshaping the deformity (amorphia) of the candidates’ cognitive and perceptual faculties.102 Men and women with deformed souls cannot be baptized. As John explains, daily exor-cisms are a crucial tool in this process, and the power inherent in “the words of the exorcists” is absolute:103 “even if the demon is fi erce and cruel, aft er these terrifying words and the invocation of the common Master of everything, he has to withdraw with all speed.”104 John understands baptism itself as the fi nal rite in a contingent, lengthy ritual process through which the soul/mind moves progressively from a deformed (amorphia), compromised, and unstable condition to a cleansed, fi rm,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 75and fortifi ed state. Finally, the baptismal seal closes the soul off from any and all demonic corruption; in John’s words, the sight of the cross stamped upon the bap-tized through the chrism “would make all demons tremble.”105 John off ers a visually compelling depiction of the ritual process that conveys the multidimensional nature of baptismal transformation. We gain insight reading John’s idea of transfor-mation from a sociological perspective, of course. However our view is severely limited until we consider the ritual from an ontological and cosmological perspec-tive also. Th e baptized have been transformed into “[t]he newly sealed, the chosen soldiers of Christ.” Th ey are the “new creation” that Paul describes in 2 Corinthians 5:17. John explains the transformation in cognitive terms:Th e grace (charis) of God has entered these souls and remolded them (meteplase), reformed them (meterrhythmēse), and made them diff erent from what they were (allas ant’ allōn autas eirgasato). It did not change their substance, but made over their will (tēn ousian metabalousa alla tēn proairesin metaskeuasasa), no longer allowing the tribunal of the mind’s eyes to entertain an erroneous notion (tōn ophalmōn tēn dianoias to kritērion ouk aphieisa), but by dissipating the mist (lēmēn) that was blinding their eyes, God’s grace made them see the ugly deformity of evil and virtue’s shining beauty as they are.106Aft er being transformed, a baptized Christian can begin to discern subtle dif-ferences in the surrounding mists of sensory ambiguity. Sacramental rituals empower the baptized to illuminate or repair the demonically damaged mind as well as protect that mind from further demonic attacks. Th e ideal medium of attack against the demonic enemy is a well-known form of public ritualized speech outfi tted to this purpose—a Christianized version of parrhēsia: that is, speaking boldly and freely to the demonic enemy.John uses vivid fi gurative language to communicate the ontological and cosmo-logical aspects of the transformation. In his fi rst instruction (Catech. illum. 1.5–16), he depicts baptizands standing in the sensory order (epi tōn aisthētōn) like a new bride in her father’s house.107 Th e bride’s paternal ancestry was originally pure, but since the fall of Adam and Eve, unclean demons have freely invaded and deformed (amorphia) the bride’s soul; aft er this, she relentlessly engages in idolatry that results in drunkenness, licentiousness, and other wayward behavior. Eventually, Christ transforms the bride’s soul, opening up a path of baptism. Th rough the rit-ual process of baptism, an individual works to loosen the bonds that anchor a person’s soul or mind to the corrupted sensory order in order to join the house of the bridegroom in the spiritual order (ta pneumatika).108 Once a person is success-fully baptized, he or she will no longer be a member of a demonically deformed humanity but a Christian soldier. As one of the spiritual order, she or he will now be able to walk through the streets of Antioch invulnerable to the traps of the sen-sory environment."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"76 John Chrysostom and AntiochElsewhere John describes this transformation of the soul/mind using the lan-guage of contracts and agreements, and couches the transition from Satan to Christ in legal terms. At the beginning of humanity God established a formal arrangement between Satan and man known as “the contract of our heritage (chei-rographon patrōn).”109 Adam authors the contract with his fall. Th e subsequent generations of men have compounded the interest with their own failings: “In this contract (to cheirographon) are written a curse, and sin, and death, and the con-demnation of the law.”110 In Hom. Col. 6, John contends that Christ’s crucifi xion has broken the contract. By taking the decree authorizing man’s enslavement to Satan and “nailing it to the Cross” (Col. 2:14), Jesus has erased humanity’s debt.111 He has destroyed death and subjugated the devil. Th e cosmology shift s in that moment. In De coemeterio et de cruce, John once again clarifi es that Christ’s and Satan’s fi rst battle has announced a new hierarchical order to the entire cosmos:Just as a noble king who has vanquished a terrible enemy hangs up that enemy’s and his troops’ breastplates, shields, and weapons on a loft y trophy stand, so too Christ, who, aft er defeating the devil, has hung up all [the devil’s] weapons . . . high on the Cross as on a victory monument so that all the powers above in heaven and men below on earth and the wicked demons who have been conquered may see them.112Th e crucifi xion has not utterly destroyed Satan’s contract with humanity; nor is that Christ’s intention. Instead, the event of the crucifi xion has eff ected a renego-tiation of the contract. For those who choose to remain in their current agreement with Satan, the binding articles will increase with each new sin.113 Th ose who wish to move into a more salutary contractual relationship with Christ can enter the Lenten catechumenate to prepare for this arrangement. Th us, John also under-stands the crucifi xion to presage the baptizand’s own victory over Satan during baptism and later in his/her own battles as a soldier of Christ.114 Th e spoken bap-tismal formulae and the invocation of the Creed on Easter Day produce the sub-stance of a new contract with Christ within the baptizand: “Th is became the signa-ture, this the agreement, this the contract (touto cheirographon egeneto, touto synthēkē, touto grammateion).”115John’s view of the cosmos leads him to insist that each human being has a con-tract with either Christ or Satan. In his cosmology, a person cannot act as a “free agent.” Furthermore, aft er baptism, it is still quite possible to resurrect the older contract if one is not careful about taking care of the new one with Christ. Th ose who neglect their new duties may nullify their alliance with Christ and reestablish their enslavement to Satan. To maintain one’s contractual arrangement with Christ, one has to live up to one’s obligations as a soldier of Christ and an enemy of Satan and his demons.116 Furthermore, John’s language is particularly important. Spiritual warfare is central to his notion of Christian ritual identity. He speaks of"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 77the newly baptized Christian soldier, endowed with aretē and possessing an ability to “fi ght with bodiless powers” (tais asōmatois hamillasthai dynamesi).117What exactly defi nes “spiritual warfare” is the topic of chapter 3.EXORCISMIn Catech. illum. 2, John off ers his most direct description of prebaptismal exor-cisms:It is necessary that you understand why, aft er the instruction daily, we send you to the words of the exorcists (epi tas tōn exorkizontōn hymas phōnas parapempomen). For this rite does not happen without plan or purpose, but you will receive dwelling within you the heavenly King; this is why, aft er you received our warning, those [exorcists] who are assigned to this, as if they were making a certain house ready for a coming royal visit, thus cleansed your intellectual faculty using these fearful words, forcing every wretched artifi ce to fl ee, and making your intellectual faculty worthy for the kingly presence.118Prebaptismal exorcisms are necessary because the unbaptized mind has been utterly corrupted by unclean demons (tois akathartois daimosin),119 and the soul is deformed (amorphia). Th e mind’s dejected state is inevitable aft er years of idle or dangerous conversation (e.g., making oaths or engaging in magical rituals such as defi xiones or katadesmoi) in the theater or in the hippodrome. Th ese social behav-iors and ritual actions aff ord the devil the perfect opportunity to “trip up” human-ity repeatedly by infl aming the passions that lead to behavioral drunkenness (methē) and licentiousness (akolasia). Daily life in a demon-fi lled city has “dark-ened [the] reason,” produced a “loss of understanding,” and induced “a straying of reason from its natural ways.”120 Consequently, the unbaptized, being “subject to the tyranny of the devil, like captives . . . [are] led to this place and that.”121In Hom. Matt. 11 John sheds light on the ontological wear and tear that an unbaptized person endures living in a demonically compromised city. Aft er sev-eral days immersed in urban living, Christians will fi nally enter the church again. At that point the priest has to erase the “unintelligible and misshapen” (asēma kai diestrammena) letters and impressions (ta charagmata) that “the devil has engraved (enetypōse)” on their souls.122 He rewrites a salvifi c inscription through the Spirit. Likewise in De incomprehensibili natura Dei 2.8 John speaks of producing “a mind swept and clean and free to hear God’s word,” but only aft er clearing out the demonic dross his congregants’ minds have collected during time spent in Anti-och’s public spaces.123 However, as soon as his congregants venture out into the city again, they will forget the lessons of his sermon. Th e characters John has impressed on their minds will dull and blur as the devil engraves deeply on their minds thousands of his images and words. In many ways, it is a losing battle."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"78 John Chrysostom and AntiochHowever, the drudgery of a Christian’s psychic or cognitive upkeep can be alto-gether avoided if that person is baptized. Th en, the Creed will stand “exactly planted in our intellectual faculty,” thus actively obstructing the devil’s inscriptions and letters.124Prebaptismal exorcisms are an essential part of the preparation for permanent engraving. John insists that as the mind approaches baptism it has to be made quite diff erent. He informs candidates that on that day they must display the entire change or transformation of their mind that has occurred since they began the baptismal training. On that day “it is necessary that the mind be exactly fi xed in pious faith [i.e., the Creed], and the tongue through its agreement shout forth the resolution of the understanding faculty” (dei gar kai tēn dianoian estērichthai bebaiōs en tēi eusebei pistei kai tēn glōttan dia tēs homologias kēryttein to pepēgos tēs dianoias).125 In other words, the mind must be rehabilitated in both a demono-logical and a Stoic sense. It must be evacuated of unclean demons and become capable of rational thought.It takes several weeks of daily exorcisms to transform a mind crippled by unclean demons into a mind cleansed, fortifi ed, stable, and capable of cognitive clarity. John places a great deal of emphasis on the ritual of exorcism in one’s progress toward baptism. In his ascription of power to the “words of the exorcists,” he refl ects the contemporary belief in the power of ritual speech as well as in a world fi lled with spiritual beings aff ected by such words. Th at is, despite modern suggestions to the contrary, John declares clearly a compulsory, ex opere operato effi cacy inherent in the ritual speech of the exorcisms:Aft er he [a demon] hears that terror-inducing formula, even if he is a dangerous beast, he is not capable of slinking away or lurking in his den, but he makes off and runs away even against his will.126Th ough his form of expression could be metaphorical, here John’s language is unequivocal: he depicts a compulsive, physical force inherent in ritual speech. In Incompr. nat. Dei 3, although his language is vague, John again has in mind the same verbal effi cacy when he briefl y describes the method of helping the demon-possessed. In the midst of this passage John draws his listeners’ attention to a “large crowd” of demoniacs, for whom the congregation would then pray collectively.127 But this passage also displays certain diff erences. John does not describe an act of formal exorcism, let alone a series of exorcisms; instead, he mentions a communal prayer: in other words, the ritualized performance of words—perhaps a well-known scriptural passage—that acts to expel the demonic from those suff ering some kind of demonic possession. Th is passage in De incomprehensibili natura Dei provides insight into the degree to which exorcistic practice fi nds new and variant shapes in late antique ecclesiastical Christianity. It is an era of exorcistic improvi-sation—a period in which congregants have an increasing number of exorcistic"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 79options outside of the church. For example, as noted in chapter 1 of this study, John describes parents who take their sons who have been “manipulated by demons” and trek up Mount Silpius to visit all of the holy men in search of a cure.128In an important way, then, prebaptismal exorcisms stand distinctively apart from general exorcistic and apotropaic practice occurring in the church at that time and in the city. Th ese rituals are performed daily throughout the weeks of baptismal preparation. Th ey are embedded within a day of instruction and other forms of ritual practice. According to John they directly follow catechetical instruction. Furthermore, they prepare the baptizands for the more powerful rit-ual of baptism. Consequently, we are dealing with a ritual process that changes a person fundamentally.Th ere are several very important dimensions of this transformation to consider here. First of all: yes, the transformation is sociological, but understanding the late antique animistic worldview demands a more complicated, rigorous approach than that available in traditional sociological models of conversion. In his reading of the baptismal and sacramental lectures of Cyril of Jerusalem and Ambrose of Milan, Th omas Finn describes a conversion movement from evil to divinity through a repeated exorcistic event that announces to the catechumen his new identity:Th e rite [of exorcism] is an ordeal that seeks to evoke in the baptizands a sense of the power of evil and to elicit confession of sins (we are not told in what form). Th e daily repetition of exorcism seeks to force the evil spirit to give way to the Holy Spirit. Th e intended eff ect is the baptizands’ gradual withdrawal from the power of their culture and their past—a therapeutic rite.129Finn has loosely appropriated Victor Turner’s emphasis on rites of passage to consider the Lenten catechumenate and/or baptismal training, with mixed results. His interpretation favors an ideological and hence symbolic interpretation of the ritual process rather than a reading of instrumental or ontological ritual action. In his view, weeks of repeating the same performative act inevitably accomplish no more than mid-twentieth-century psychological relief: exorcism is a “therapeutic rite.”Finn off ers the term “encapsulation” to serve for Turner’s communitas and to denote “a procedure developed to teach something new, especially a new set of values and way of life.”130 On its own, Finn’s model provides a pragmatic account of processes of edifi cation and ideology production within baptismal training. How-ever, its aim is insular. Th at is, Finn’s model fails to account for the baptized com-munity’s interaction with the rest of the city or, for that matter, to propose a mode of Christian baptism that transforms a person into a ritual (and ritualizing) agent participating in urban transformation. Indeed, it does not account for bap-tismal ritual (both prebaptismal exorcisms and baptism) as an instrumental"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"80 John Chrysostom and Antiochor transformative agent in any fundamental respect related to the larger urban environment.Here, then, we will add to the sociological in a manner that addresses these over-sights. Let us attend closely to the ontology of ritual practice that undergirds John’s discussions of prebaptismal exorcisms, baptism, and the Eucharist. What kind of language might we develop as modern scholars to discuss a baptizand’s cognitively understood and sensorily perceived change from demonic contagion to holiness?Let us be clear in what we intend by the vague phrase “ontology of ritual prac-tice.” Our defi nition is specifi c, as it off ers a critical intervention into the current considerations of ritual effi cacy/instrumentality in late antiquity.131 If we under-stand ritual agency/instrumentality/effi cacy in the full and responsive, interactive animistic atmosphere of the late antique world, we may imaginatively reconstruct the real, material transformations (bodily, social, the perceived cosmological) that people of the time perceive or understand to have taken place in ritual practice. In the case of John Chrysostom we are somewhat fortunate. Th ough John’s descrip-tions are brief and scattered throughout the baptismal homilies as well as other homilies, he consistently conveys the same principles of ritual ontology, ritual agency, transformation, and so forth. In brief, he articulates an ontological trans-formation—that is, an intellectual or cognitive progression of the souls/minds—in material terms. Aft er several weeks of daily exorcisms, John insists, the mind is no longer an inn open and free to all demons. Rather, aft er repeatedly experiencing “the words of the exorcists,” a mind transforms from the demonic to the divine, from the sensual order (epi tōn aisthētōn) to the spiritual order (ta pneumatika).132 Th e baptizand—more specifi cally his or her mind (dianoia)—recuperates. No longer wrinkled, stained, deformed, and ugly—the soul/mind of the baptizand becomes a fortifi ed, cleansed faculty of rational judgment.133 Th at person now pos-sesses a mind capable of assuming agency within an initiation process; the mind participates actively in a fi nal transition from the sensory realm of unstable and fl uctuating doxa to the fi rm and permanent spiritual realm of epistēmē.Turning our attention to the ontology of ritual practice (more specifi cally, the transformative power of ritual words and, related to this, the ontology/materiality of language) allows a diff erent set of questions to move to the foreground. How does John understand (and also construct) daily exorcisms to reshape the souls/minds of baptizands physically? Exactly what kind of language does he use? Like-wise, how precisely does John imagine a baptized Christian’s actions (e.g., making an oath) will alter—even endanger—the ontological improvements that a person’s mind or soul has achieved through sacramental ritual? In what ways does John attach moral and ethical value to the physiology of sacramental and ritual agency? Does John develop an ontology (or materiality) of morality or sin, which he ties in some way to the effi cacy of the sacraments? Are there parallels for John’s language elsewhere in late antiquity, beyond those I have already covered in Stoicism (e.g.,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 81perhaps pollution and purity discourses in Judaism, Greco-Roman religions, or the PGM, for example)?To grasp the ritual agency imparted to the baptizand through the repeated exorcisms and, fi nally, through baptism itself (and hence to consider the fact of transformation—bodily, social, urban, and potentially violent), I return once more to Bourdieu’s notion of habitus. In the ritual actions, gestures, and the word of the scriptures spoken, read, and sung over and over again, the bodies of baptizands come to sense intuitively the demonic in the hippodrome, the theater, heretical and Jewish religious assemblies, and so many other locations in Antioch. In these several weeks of daily exorcisms, baptizands come to apprehend physically—in ritual gestures and verbal formulae as well as through daily ethical instruction—the contours of their own demonic body as it slowly transitions to a holy vessel. Just as importantly, they can also come to realize a demonic city that brings each of them so close to damnation.We can begin to imagine this process of radical transformation by turning to the work of R. L. Stirrat, a cultural anthropologist whose discussion of a Christian exorcism cult in the middle of Buddhist Sri Lanka is extremely illuminating. Stir-rat recognizes a process whereby a person new to the cult transitions from being a passive victim introduced to a demonological worldview to viewing himself or herself as an active participant in the creation of that worldview. He describes a collaborative relationship between exorcists and the exorcised:Regular attenders at shrines such as Kudagama were and are fascinated by the demonic. At Kudagama, demons have a very real existence, as real an existence as people or ani-mals or objects. Th e nature of the demonic is a continual topic of conversation at the shrine. Newcomers . . . who arrive knowing little or nothing about the demons quickly learn their names and habits. Furthermore, during the fi ts and trances of the possessed, more knowledge is generated. Th e world of demons is continually being reshaped and reformed in its details. New demons are discovered; new aspects of their being are made plain. Yet at an overall level certain contours of the cosmos remain constant, in particular the essentially dualistic framework of the Catholic tradition which is made manifest in the continual cosmic battle between the forces of good and evil.134Baptizands in Antioch will have shared the experience of prebaptismal exor-cisms in a similar way. While exorcisms indoctrinate an individual baptizand into the knowledge and correct performance of the Christian ritual formulae, we must also recognize that as baptizands come together they take possession of that knowledge. Most especially, baptizands will have experienced exorcism and demonic contagion through John’s framework of Stoic cognitive theory. Th ey will have come to experience, and then convey, a view of Antioch as demonically cor-rupt and corrupting via its images, words, songs, rituals, and so forth. As bapti-zands and eventually baptized Christians, they will have contributed their own"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"82 John Chrysostom and Antiochpersonal experiences with demonic struggle and exorcistic battle in Antioch in a continuing production and proliferation of that knowledge.Th ird—and closely related to the second dimension—baptismal transforma-tion is cosmological. Th ough the original publications were forty years ago, Stanley Tambiah’s treatment of Sinhalese exorcism rites and magical speech are extremely helpful here. In confi guring the exorcism formulae as performative utterances, Tambiah has argued that they “enact and incarnate cosmological conceptions.”135 Speech-act theory fi gures prominently in his reading. Th e linguistic theorists John Searle and John Austin approach words not simply as vehicles of communication but as agents of action.136 An illocutionary or performative utterance does not merely say something or describe an action; it actually accomplishes that action in the appropriate circumstances.137 Tambiah applies these principles in his descrip-tion of exorcism as a powerful and authority-granting practice. In Tambiah’s view, ritual speech gains its generative or transformative power because the speech act is grounded in a much larger amalgam of ritual speech, action, objects, practitioners, and cosmological structures: therefore, the speaking agent speaks a reality.In “A Performative Approach to Ritual,” Tambiah off ers a strong critical interven-tion, focusing his eff orts on the ways in which rituals do not simply represent or symbolize cosmological structures but in their performance serve to produce a cos-mological reality and reveal the means of accessing the powers rooted in that reality.138John’s exorcisms announce an uncompromising Nicene reality, and in their repeated performance create that reality for the baptizands and the Nicene church over and over again. In Antioch exorcists perform daily exorcisms over baptizands for several weeks. Th ese and other related rituals steadily rehabilitate baptizands’ view of their world, so that newly created soldiers of Christ can perceive their true Christian cosmos clearly. Th rough daily rituals in the several weeks before the day of their baptism—and their assumption of powerful speech (parrhēsia)—they grow reacquainted with the supernatural forces and cosmogonic events that con-nect a person to the Trinity.In his sermons, John does not provide actual exorcism formulae, although he does off er a few clues. Th e exorcist’s words recall (anamimnēskousi) to the candi-dates the “Lord Master,” the punishment (kolasis), the vengeance (timōria), and Gehenna (Geenē).139 John associates these words theologically and liturgically with two cosmogonic events in Christianity: Christ’s crucifi xion and the second com-ing. Both may very well have become standard formulae within baptismal exor-cism formulae by the fi ft h century, if not much earlier.140 While the details are sparse, John provides a brief glimpse of a ritual process, repeatedly announcing a Christian cosmogony, cosmological order, and authorities—episodes in sacred history in which Christ defeats demonic powers. Tambiah would claim that this repeated ritual process enacts or creates a cosmological order within which the candidate comes to recognize his/her own place as well as that of his/her exorcists."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 83BAPTIZED AND BATTLE READYJohn describes the baptizand’s spoken words as actualizing an instant, permanent change. As already mentioned, John describes the baptismal formulae in legal terms: “Th is became the signature, this the agreement, this the contract (touto cheirographon egeneto, touto synthēkē, touto grammateion).”141 Apotaxis and syn-taxis comprise a “written agreement (grammateia) between the contracting par-ties.”142 Just as the crucifi xion drew the attention of all cosmological beings and natural powers, the baptizand’s performance of the baptismal formulae—the Renunciation of Satan (apotagē) and the Attachment to Christ (syntagē)—attracts a similarly large audience:143Th e words are few, but the power (dynamis) of them is great. For the angels who are standing near by and the invisible powers, taking great joy in your conversion, receive your words and take them up to the common master of everything and they are inscribed into the heavenly books (en tais bibliois tais ouraniois autai eggraphontai).144Here, however, instead of acting only as witnesses, angels become active par-ticipants in the fi nal stages of a person’s baptismal transformation. Apotaxis and syntaxis are the basic ritual elements, which enable a person to forge new contrac-tual relations with Christ. In speaking the words of union with Christ, a person, no longer bound to demonic power, stands in cosmological alignment with divinity alone. Just as the entire cosmological population bore witness to the crucifi xion, once again they witness a signifi cant moment when the baptizand fi nally trans-forms into an active ritual agent in his/her own baptism by uttering the ritual for-mulae. Intriguingly, however, it is at this exact point, when the baptizand speaks, that the angels also shift from passive observers to active beings, according to John; they grab the words comprising the two formulae as soon as they are released from the baptizand’s lips and lift them up to heaven where the ephemeral mixture of air and sound is transformed into eternal inscriptions in heavenly books. In a mysterious manner the baptized Christian soldier has been materially and spiritu-ally tethered—as his/her own breath is inscribed into heavenly books—into the divine realm: “you who are the new soldiers of Christ (hoi neoi tou Christou stratiōtai), who have this day been inscribed on the citizen lists of heaven (hoi eis ton ouranon sēmeron politographēthentes).”145Th is cosmological shift is matched by an ontological or cognitive transforma-tion: “You must keep this [truth] fi rmly fi xed inside your rational faculty” (dei gar kai touto pepēgenai en tēi dianoiai tēi hymeterai).”146 Th rough the baptismal ritual, the Creedal formulae come to stand fi rmly rooted in the baptizand’s intellectual faculty (dianoia). John draws on Stoic epistemology here. Candidates spend thirty days learning the Nicene Creed and Creedal apologetics. During baptism, they"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"84 John Chrysostom and Antiochspeak the words aloud, thus fusing them within their rational faculties. Paul uses similar language in Philippians 1:12–29. In the context of religious competition, Paul encourages his community to strive “to stand fi rm” in the correct theological beliefs. In spite of Paul’s opponents hounding them, the Philippians cannot relin-quish this knowledge if they wish to maintain their salvation,.Troels Engberg-Pedersen has commented on the Stoic undercurrent in Paul’s discussion of theological debate. Paul’s notion of “standing fi rm” refl ects the con-cept of katalēpsis, “which is a key term in the Stoic theory of knowledge indicating a complete grasp of the truth which cannot be dislodged by reasoning.”147 John echoes Paul’s epistemological view in his description of the consequent eff ect of embodying the Creed through baptism. In speaking the Creed aloud in baptismal ritual, one comes to embody the verbal elements fi rmly in the manner of a katalēpsis. It transforms the mind, fortifying and stabilizing it and ultimately rescuing it in light of its vulnerable exposure in a sensory world. A Christian emerges from baptism a diff erent person, who is ontologically and cosmologically rooted to the heavenly realm and divine truth. As long as the baptized attend to these embodied inscriptions, their rootedness will not change.Most intriguing, perhaps, is the direct manner in which John characterizes the dual state of “standing fi rm in heaven” and on earth. Th e baptismal seal and the baptismal formulae have been imprinted into the mind and hold apotropaic power. As John explains, the ritual act of speaking the baptismal formulae contin-ues to provide apotropaic protection: speaking the two formulae aloud immedi-ately causes demons to fl ee. Moreover, John ascribes tremendous power to the ritual act of signing the cross and the seal of baptism: “the strength of a wonderful amulet and a potent incantation.”148 Elsewhere John describes the eff ect the seal has on the devil long aft er baptism. When the devil sees that a person’s baptism/seal is shining, “he will not dare to stand close by, because he is terrifi ed by [the seal’s] brightness. Its light blinds him.”149John especially encourages Christians to take advantage of the devil’s sacra-mental phobia and protect the seal’s brilliant luster. Th e primary means of doing this involves the practice of speaking. John asks that the baptized Christian sol-diers, in a sense, strip themselves down in their oral performance, almost to their sacramental core: “Let no simple or purposeless word spring forth”;150 “Let there be from us no worldly, thoughtless, and empty conversation”;151 “Keep your tongue only engaged in hymns and praise, in reading of the divine word, and in spiritual conversation, whatever is good for edifi cation, that it may give grace to the hear-ers.”152 Likewise, the ritual words of baptism function as a protective formula:I beg you . . . to hold tightly to this word as a staff and just as without sandals and cloak none of you would choose to go down to the marketplace, so without this word never enter the marketplace (outō chōris tou rhēmatos toutou mēdepote eis tēn agoran"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Devil Is in the Ritual 85embalēs); but when you are about to pass over the threshold of the gateway (to pro-thyra tou pylōnos), say this word fi rst: “I leave your ranks, Satan, and your pomp, and your service, and I join the ranks of Christ.” And never go forth without this phrase (chōris tēs phōnēs).153With a baptized Christian’s mind sealed and rooted in the constancy of the Christian word, the tongue becomes a weapon of the Spirit, able to “curb their shameless tongues”154—that is, the tongues of heretics, Greeks, and Jews as well as the demons directing their words. In becoming a “soldier of Christ,” a baptized Christian enters into a larger arena of combat, which is not confi ned to human populations but instead is inclusive of demonic foes:Up to now you have been in an open arena; there all of your contests were forgiven. But from today on, the arena stands open, the contest is ready to begin. Not only is the race of men, but also the host of angels is watching [your] combats.155We speak here of baptism; however, John stretches the image liberally to speak of confrontational battles with the devil as soon as the baptized person leaves the church, using words as weapons (parrhēsia). But where, exactly? Before the bap-tisms, John is exceedingly careful regarding the company his baptizands keep. Th ey have made a contract with Christ to stay the course until baptism. Th is is an especially delicate period in which baptizands need extra security and protection. He instructs them to carry in their mind at all times the contract and to be sober and watchful so that the enemy of salvation cannot fi nd an opening. It takes very little for the devil to burrow into the mind. Upon entering baptismal training, John insists that baptizands refrain from wandering around in Antioch and mix-ing with unbaptized, non-Nicene crowds. He is quite clear regarding the dangers involved. As they transition from the discursive and shift ing sensory (aisthēsis) realm (of the unbaptized) to the epistemic permanency of the pneumatic (pneuma) realm (of the baptized), they have to be careful. Th ey must avoid the dangerous social venues where an Arian or Sabellian may be lying in wait to “disturb and confuse” (tarattō, epitholoō) a Nicene Christian by introducing “examinations through his own reason into the dogma of the church (tas ek tōn oikeiōn logismōn zētēseis epeispherōn tois tēs ekklēsias dogmasi).” Th e passage is worth quoting in full:Let no one hereaft er disturb your mind by bringing examinations through his own reason into the dogma of the church as he tries to confuse the teachings that are straight and healthy. But fl ee the companionship of such people as you would fl ee poisonous drugs, which could destroy you. For these people are much more danger-ous. Th e poisons do not only do harm to the body; these people infl ict indignities upon the very salvation of the soul. Th is is why it is fi tting from the very beginning to fl ee such conversations.156"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"86 John Chrysostom and AntiochNow at the end of the baptismal training, baptized Christian soldiers possess the fortifi ed and sealed minds that allow them to reenter the public sphere: with God’s grace enveloping their dianoia and fortifying their judgment (to kritērion), they have moved from a state of “no confi dence” in terms of speech practices to an ability to engage in parrhēsia. John’s message to his congregants, then, is straight-forward: speak loudly, speak oft en, and expel the demons from the streets and bodies of Antioch.In chapter 1 Antioch was shown to be many diff erent things: unorganized, pos-sessing and possessed by ambiguous forces, comprised of diff erent religions, home to a wide variety of peoples, and so forth. While living and preaching in a city that can easily slip into an animistic chaos, John Chrysostom presents a powerful uni-fying principle that undergirds the city’s spiritual environment: fi rst, Antioch is pulsing with suprahuman forces from the sacred groves of the Daphne Gate to the foothills of Mount Silpius; and, second, all of these spiritual powers are arrayed against the unbaptized, unsealed, and therefore unprotected minds in Antioch. By contrast, the baptized carry within them suffi cient protection. In addition to the apotropaic power of their baptismal seal, they retain the power inherent in the spoken words of the baptismal formulae; they also possess the material memory of the Creed—these divine words are inscribed in their minds and thus cast forth a blazing defensive light that forces all demons to fl ee.In his baptismal instructions John Chrysostom envisages a rebalancing of the spiritual order and human minds within that order: a slow, exorcistic conversion of Antioch and the inhabitants within it. Within his theorization of baptismal con-version, most especially in his discussions that revolve around prebaptismal exor-cisms and the antidemonic aspects of baptism and the Eucharist, we can see a microcosm of the city’s transformation. Th e prebaptismal exorcisms in particular serve to indoctrinate the baptizand with a sense of his or her deformed cognitive state prior to entering baptismal preparation. Th e cleansing/healing/expulsion process of exorcisms, day aft er day, injects a baptizand with an exorcist’s zeal to heal others in a similar plight. John insists they take their baptismal formulae to the marketplace as a weapon against any human or demon. Th e baptized Christian should use the ritual phrases to take the fi ght directly to the devil in the streets of Antioch.Quite deliberately, then, John does not construct a religious identity for an indi-vidualized, introspective, peaceful disposition or one aimed inward toward the community only. Instead, John Chrysostom speaks of a spiritual warfare that is directed outward—of fi ghting bodiless powers (tais asōmatois hamillasthai dynamesi). He directs baptismally sealed and, thus, apotropaically protected Christian soldiers into Antioch to engage in bold speech battles (parrhēsia) with those they encounter—both man and devil."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"87In the fall of 386 John is facing a crisis. Numbers have dropped precipitously with the advent of the Jewish High Holidays.1 Rather than listen to his sermons, a number of Christians—Judaizers—are rushing off to participate in the Feast of Trumpets and in Sukkot.2 John’s reaction still registers as a notorious blight in Christian literature. Over the course of the Jewish New Year in 386 and 387, as well as the Pesach (Passover) in between, he delivers the Adversus Judaeos homilies.3 Th ese eight homilies are infamous for their unrelenting invective against Jewish places of worship, rituals, and Jews themselves.4 Th ey are also notable for contain-ing some of John Chrysostom’s most distrubing demonological imagery:Where a prostitute has established herself, the place is a brothel. But the synagogue is not only a brothel and theater, but a nest of thieves, and a lodging of wild animals. For Jeremiah said: “Your house has become for me a place of a hyena.” He does not simply say “of a wild beast,” but “of an unclean wild beast.” And again, “I have left my house, I have left behind my inheritance.” But when God has abandoned a people, what hope of salvation remains? When God has abandoned a place, that place becomes a dwelling place of demons.5For prostitutes, and eff eminates, and the entire dancing chorus from the theater used to run together [to the Festival of Trumpets]. And why do I speak about the fornica-tions that happen [there]? . . . Did you not hear in the earlier discourse the reason that showed you clearly that demons inhabit the same souls of the Jews and the places in which they come together?6Th e Adversus Judaeos homilies provide a rare opportunity to study John Chrys-ostom’s demonology as it evolves over a sustained period of time; the passages we 3Th e Spectacle of Exorcism"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"88 John Chrysostom and Antiochconsider here disclose the priest’s careful delineation of a Jewish diabolism that is ravaging Antioch. He takes a great deal of time and deliberation in his diaboliza-tion of the Jews in Antioch. He is especially careful to present the reasons behind Jews’ fall to the demons: their deviltry feeds upon heteropraxy (e.g., the rituals of Yom Kippur) and/or particular ritualized moments in time (e.g., the High Holi-days in autumn and Pesach in spring).7John verbally conjures a danger that has a palpable reality to it, as this Judaizing demonology closely rides the waves of the tension that issues forth from the need to separate and diff erentiate socioreligious identities: Jew, Judaizer, and baptized Christian. In some places John decrees a wide spectrum that marks the phenom-enal distance between the irredeemable and completely diabolized to those not only impenetrable to demons through the sacramental power of baptism but now in antagonistic relation to demons.Consequently, the homilies off er a good place to pick up the threads of our earlier discussion in chapter 2. What are John Chrysostom’s views regarding the baptized Christian’s purpose in Antioch? Th e sacrament of baptism and the recep-tion of the seal provide antidemonic power and endow the new soldier of Christ with an authority over demons. Is such a person—suddenly in possession of une-quivocal antidemonic power—intent in engaging only in individualized spiritual warfare? Or does such a baptized person turn to a much larger battleground and fi ght against the demonic in the city of Antioch—perhaps in the midst of a congre-gational crisis? In the fi nal chapter of part I, we will consider how John Chrysos-tom instructs baptized Christians—stronger Christians—in the practice of con-gregational spiritual warfare. We fi nd much of this instruction in Chrysostom’s Adversus Judaeos homilies. In this case of spiritual warfare, the soul(s) of the Judaizer(s) stands as the embattled territory. Demons are the enemy; they come to the battle bearing many weapons of war: the demon-fi lled Jew; the demon-fi lled synagogue, and the demon-soaked rituals of Judaism. While the enemy is fi erce, the Christian soldier also comes to the battleground equipped with the tools of war: his or her baptismal formulae, the sign of the cross, and many other forms of Christian ritual language. In these homilies John also instructs his baptized Chris-tians in another essential weapon: the power inherent in Pauline language.As John suggests at the end of Catecheses ad illuminandos 12, Christians are to use the baptismal formulae actively in battle against both human and demonic enemies. As this chapter outlines, John ensures a strong, instructional continuity between the Adversus Judaeos homilies and the Catecheses ad illuminandos lec-tures: the baptized Christian has and should use divine power to battle demon-tainted humans. Likewise, John describes the form of battle as verbal and exorcis-tic. In his homilies John narrowly circumscribes the enemy: demonized/diabolized, decontextualized Jews who emerge only during the High Holidays in autumn and Pesach in spring."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 89Before moving forward, it is important to note that the Jewish enemies we encounter here in John’s works—soulless, demon-fi lled, bestial, Christ killers—are rhetorical creations. Th ey appear periodically and are closely linked to Chrysos-tom’s ritual representation in the High Holidays in autumn and Pesach in spring. Th ese are not actual, historical Jews who are born, live, and die in Antioch in the fourth century. His Jews are ephemeral fi gures: they arrive at the beginning of a season of actual Jewish spectacle in Antioch and disappear once the celebrations have ended. By constructing these fi gures in vivid verbal descriptions, he also then promotes the power within ecclesiastical and sacramental rituals as a protective and off ensive countermeasure. By amplifying their diabolic threat, John creates justifi cation to produce an extremely powerful exorcistic image of clergy and bap-tized laity. Sacramental speech, Pauline excerpts, the sign of the cross—all trans-form into weaponry that Christian soldiers must use to rescue fallen brethren.John instructs his stronger, baptized Christians in how to engage in close, inti-mate, violent, exorcistic encounters with Judaizers, and even ritual battle with Jews themselves. John’s Jews are also targets of Christian ritual assault. It is all too easy to overlook Chrysostom’s instructions to Christian soldiers to initiate exorcistic “spectacles” (my language) in public. In the encounters John models or mandates, he intends a strong Christian/baptized Christian to perform and thus create the diff erence between a diabolic Judaism and a divine Christianity. John describes an intertwining of spiritual and cosmological boundaries in the process.John craft s a much more complex notion of religious boundaries than we see in the rhetorical practice of demonization. John does not use demons only to draw an impenetrable divide between Judaism and Christianity. Nor does he merely por-tray a demonic scourge in the synagogue in order to distance Christians from Jews, their rituals, and their places of worship. Th ough he certainly accomplishes a strict ideological divide through the rhetoric of demonization, Chrysostom also instructs stronger Christians to move directly toward and into enemy territory: he describes a form of ritual intervention requiring proximity, if not physical contact, with a diabolizing Jewish plague. To that end John founds the boundary upon the principle of exorcistic practice in action, and this injects a chilling paradox into his notion of religious boundaries as well as his construction of religious (Christian) identity.In John’s mind, boundaries, in a sense, are created to be broken—for the stronger/baptized soldier of Christ, the Judaizer, and the diabolic Jew, at any rate. Boundaries are created suddenly and—if John has his way—oft en, in a heated fl ash of ritual encounters: Christians exorcise Jews and Judaizers of their demonic con-tagion, or simply carry a vivid image of the act in mind as they move through the city day by day. John intends this moment of dramatic, violent demonic (Judaiz-ing) expulsion to take place in public; Christian soldiers should verbally assault their enemy in front of witnesses. Such a spectacle serves to announce a series of"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"90 John Chrysostom and Antiochinterlocking dichotomies: Christian vs. Jew (or Judaizer); divine vs. demonic; strong exorcist vs. weak, defeated victim of demonic possession. On the other hand, however, a diabolic Judaism is also named in the exorcistic encounter—the performance names and actualizes the Jewish threat. Each exorcistic encounter intensifi es that threat. John is sure that that demonic disease will linger: through weaker Christian souls (and their penchant for Jewish rituals and places) the bor-der will always be porous, ambiguous, and invasive; Judaizing demons can (and do) slip dangerously close to the heart of the ecclesiastical community. As long as Jewish festivals grab hold of public space and the public themselves, weaker, sim-pler Christians will fall under the Jewish demonic infl uence. So too, then, so long as Jewish festivals exist, the demand for strong exorcistic clergy and laity will exist. Th rough spectacles of exorcistic confrontation, Christians, in a manner of speak-ing, can fi ght over control of public spaces in the city.Past readings of the homilies have downplayed John’s demonology, if they have not altogether ignored it. Interpreters have reduced and fl attened John’s demons. Th ey have treated demons as the metaphorical representation of immoral thoughts or unethical behavior. Recently scholars have turned to the demons directly in John’s texts, and they have brought important attention to the discursive power of demons as a distancing or othering device used to defi ne religious boundaries and borders as well as to distance or delegitimate certain religious discourses—an approach that is useful and accurate, but, as we will see, somewhat incomplete. Th e work of Isabella Sandwell and that of Christine Shepardson represent two of the more impressive as well as theoretically intriguing eff orts to date.8As Sandwell notes, religious identity in Christianity shift s as we move from the clearly defi ned outlines of a persecuted minority to an amorphous blending of populations in the post-Constantinian period of legalization. Late antique leaders such as John Chrysostom are faced with a situation “where many practices were shared by people whatever their religious allegiance.”9 In the identitarian ambigui-ties fueled by peace, Christian leaders fi ght to form clear religious identities; here Sandwell invokes Daniel Boyarin’s comments regarding the imperative to “eradi-cate the fuzziness of borders, semantic and social,” between Jew and Christian—as well as Greek, in the case of Antioch—thus contrasting these diff erent identities as essential religious categories oppositionally posed.10Drawing on modern theorists of identity construction such as Th omas Hylland Eriksen and Fredrik Barth, Sandwell argues that John’s notion of Christian identity is relational, built on the marking-out of diff erences from others.11 She contends that John Chrysostom aggressively promotes a dichotomous relation between Christian and Greek as well as Christian and Jew in order that “no space for ambi-guity between the two [could exist,] because religious identity has to be displayed visibly in every action at all times.”12 In her view, the urgency in John’s construc-tions is related to the probable likelihood that, despite the priest’s incessant rule"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 91making and boundary marking, we have a “situation where individuals continue to interact across those boundaries.”13Demons off er a rhetorical medium suited to John’s task. Th us Sandwell notes connections between the rhetoric of the demonic Other in John’s Catecheses ad illuminandos and that in such sermons as the Adversus Judaeos homilies. Th e pomps of Satan that each baptizand renounces include Greek rituals such as amu-let wearing, attendance at the theater and baths, and so forth. Th e devil’s pomps also can be found, and thus should be avoided, at the synagogue: the very bastion of demons. Th e particularly strong language John uses to demonize the synagogue is an indication, then, of the fact that his congregants are not listening. Instead they easily slide back into familiar ritual practices that allow them to blend in comfortably at non-Christian religious events.Christine Shepardson builds on Sandwell’s study of Antioch as “a context of rich religious complexity.”14 Her own focus involves the manner in which John’s spatial rhetoric, especially his demonizing language, transforms space into a reli-giously marked place. She brings into full light the degree to which religious com-petition (among Jews, Greeks, and diverse Christian communities) is founded upon a contestation over the construction of places in the city. Shepardson draws shrewdly from modern theorists of geography who consider the cultural construc-tion of place as a “complex entity within and shaped by forces from well beyond their own notional boundaries.”15 Such perspectives allow her to draw much-needed attention to the intracongregational debates regarding which locations are holy or sacred in Antioch. Like Sandwell, Shepardson focuses on the Adversus Judaeos homilies and on John’s demonizing rhetoric that counters congregants’ perspective that the synagogue is a holy place due to the sacred scriptures housed within. John takes issue with such a positive take on the supernatural (perhaps divine?) potency of the synagogue. By contrast, he conjures vivid imagery of the synagogue as a dangerous demonic (rather than divine) location and sets it in diametric opposition to the church. As John constructs Jewish places as locations of the demonic Other, he can then diff erentiate and distance those places in Anti-och that are authentically Christian. Th us, Shepardson argues, John promotes a Christianization of the city “not only in beliefs and behavior, but in the very geo-graphical landscape that its citizens inhabited.”16To articulate further the eff ect of John’s demonizing rhetoric, Shepardson notes the strategy of diff erentiation in imagining a geography that fuses with an “imag-ined community.”17 Geographer Yi-Fu Tuan’s terms topophilia and topophobia are especially illuminating in Shepardson’s discussion of the synagogue.18 While con-gregants’ avid participation in Jewish religious practice expresses a “topophilia for ‘Jewish’ spaces,” John fi gures the synagogue not only as an improper but also as a highly dangerous location for a Christian.19 He unleashes a barrage of images that project the malevolencies that occur in the synagogue—criminal, sexual, and"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"92 John Chrysostom and Antiochdemonic. Th ese malignities mark the synagogue unequivocally as a place to fear and thus avoid. He concretizes this view further by drawing a parallel between the synagogue and the theater; he emphasizes that both places are replete with a pol-luting diabolism. Th e synagogue is a place of demons, which likewise attracts those from the theater who are “demon-possessed.” In direct comparison, the church appears as a religious structure uncompromised in its sacrality. Moreover, the church has a responsibility to maintain its sanctity, and thus John demands that those weaker, compromised Christians, whom the synagogue and Jewish ritu-als have defi led, must not enter the holy church.Shepardson notes that many have looked at the topography of Antioch; many others, by contrast, have considered the theological confl icts that plague the city. She, however, is the fi rst to do both. She astutely considers the transformation of what was, in a sense, raw, impressionable space into a loose, uneasy collection of culturally, politically, but most importantly socioreligiously constructed places. Antioch’s environment of fi erce religious contestation marked buildings and other structures—of all shapes, sizes, and histories—in a distinctively material manner and thus always with a provisionary status. Her study of Antiochene topography injects a much-needed dynamism and a sense of contingency that few, if any, have pursued when they have viewed the city through the interpretive lens of spatial politics. Shepardson presents a powerful new model for understanding what is at stake for ecclesiastical leaders and to what lengths they will go to defend theologi-cal belief.Sandwell and Shepardson lay the foundation for further investigation into the construction of and contestation over physical places in Antioch; likewise they pose important challenges to previous perspectives on the construction of reli-gious identity. Finally, they both attend to the degree to which John Chrysostom battles his own congregation over many of these issues: they each have observed that his demonizing rhetoric is a primary weapon in what is in all likelihood a los-ing battle.We applaud these eff orts and the critical interventions they have brought to the interpretation of the homilies. Th at said, our approach to the homilies moves in a somewhat diff erent direction. My own interpretation of Antiochene topography and ecclesiastical leadership fi nds root in John’s promotion of raw antidemonic ritual (sacramental) power in the face of a demon-fl ooded city and population. In this chapter and the following, City of Demons places the materiality of ritual practice at the center of this study and considers seriously, but also specula-tively, embodied knowledge of demons gained through these rituals. As we move through Chrysostom’s Adversus Judaeos homilies as well as many other of his sermons, we search for certain ritual practices: for example, the antide-monic potency in baptism, the Eucharist, and other ecclesiastical rituals, as well as the exorcistic power disseminated through several other forms of Chris-"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 93tian ritual speech (select Pauline passages seem to be a particular favorite for John).In John’s meticulous explanations of the demons’ entry into the synagogue, Jews, and their rituals, as well as their means of infecting Judaizing Christians, he complicates (though does not invalidate) demons’ “demonizing”—or distancing—eff ect. Rather than exposing and highlighting the demons in Judaism in order to frighten Christians into maintaining a healthy distance, John gives shape to a demonology intended to compel the stronger Christians (and shame the hesitant) in the congregation into participating in an immediate, forceful, even violent ritual engagement with the enemy.20 Instead of Christians seeking distance from Jews and Judaism, John insists that stronger Christians move as close as possible to the enemy. Stronger Christians must seek out, capture, exorcise, and then drag demon-ically contaminated Judaizers back to the church. Th ere, safe in the sanctifi ying bosom of the church, John and his clergy can fi ght the demonic more thoroughly. John also asks Christians to perform dramatic exorcistic acts with both Judaizers and Jews in the streets of Antioch. Th erefore I propose that while John views Judaizers as the main goal of the hunt, he also targets Jews—or more accurately, the demons within them—who are actively seducing Christians.By turning to focus on demons as well as Jews in the Adversus Judaeos homilies, this reading deviates a good deal from that of previous scholars. Before moving forward to the homilies, let us clarify the parameters of our adopted perspective: our study here will revolve especially around the interpretive notion of demons as a distancing device. John constructs seductive, Judaizing demons that traffi c a boundary between an unsullied Christianity and a morally debased, ritually bro-ken, rejected Judaism. Th is is a boundary of incalculable depth. It is a bottomless chasm that separates the two. Th e boundary also fortifi es a sense of an ethical, moral, and ontological disparity between an exemplary Christianity and an irre-deemable Judaism, and likewise between pious, unimpeachable, baptized Chris-tians and bestial, dehumanized Jews.To that end, demons are most certainly distancing devices—though in a limited sense: that is, John does construct demons in the manner that Shepardson and Sandwell have argued. Th ey mark the synagogue, Jewish rituals, and Jews them-selves as forbidden, marginal, and off -limits, especially during the High Holidays. However, while John does indeed insist on a physical distance and religious/ideo-logical otherness, he simultaneously reminds listeners of the horrifying conse-quences should Christian soldiers fail. Th rough Jewish spectacles and other ritu-als, demons possess, penetrate, and invade a person and thus erase an individual’s sense of identity. In this way, demons bring that distance, otherness, and erasure to the core of a Christian Self.Th us we must be mindful of an important fear in late antiquity: a demon’s abil-ity to penetrate and materially contaminate the human mind/body in variously"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"94 John Chrysostom and Antiochimagined ways. Before we allow ourselves to reduce all demons to textual meta-phor, this chapter reminds the reader of what John tells his Christians: demons have infected, invaded, and penetrated the places and rituals of the Jews. Most importantly of all, perhaps, they have possessed the Jews themselves. Anyone who goes to Jewish places and engages in Jewish ritual will come into contact with the same corrupting, corrosive materiality of Judaizing demons and will contract the same Judaizing diabolism.In light of this material understanding of John’s demonology, I would correct readings of certain passages in the Adversus Judaeos homilies. John is not asking his stronger Christians to stay away from Jews, the synagogue, and Jewish rituals. Quite the opposite, in fact, is the case. Rather, he inundates the Adversus Judaeos homilies with demons in a very controlled, strategic manner. He clusters demons together in the synagogue at precise moments in the calendar year; he infuses only certain Jew-ish rituals and festivals with demons; he fi lls Jewish souls with demons and wraps their nation’s fall in a tight exegetical explanation. And importantly, rather than ask-ing stronger Christians to stay away and maintain distance, he provides this detailed demonology to serve as a map telling those Christians exactly where to go and what to do once they arrive. John demands that his stronger and hopefully strongest—that is, baptized—Christians engage in direct physical and verbal attack against the demonic Judaizing plague. Stronger, exorcising Christians have to be willing to go out into the streets of Antioch and tackle the demons directly in whatever guise they may appear; for example, they have to go to synagogues and drag the demon-possessed, weaker Christians back to the church for healing. Christians must con-tinually seek proximity to diabolized Jews and Judaizers so that they can participate in public ritual confrontation; they should perform an impromptu exorcism of sorts that dramatically marks and verbally displays an irrevocable boundary in Antioch between a divine Christianity and a demonic and diabolic Judaism. Only the closest of ritual contacts, preferably in public and with an avid audience in attendance, will succeed in marking this boundary.John spends a good deal of time within the homilies preparing stronger Chris-tians for confrontational, potentially violent encounters with Judaism’s demoni-cally tainted and possessed victims. He rehearses would-be exorcists in ritual speech techniques and instructs them regarding the places and techniques of encounter. He also introduces them to his view of the deep history and theology of Jewish/demon entanglement—a history that Jews themselves are ignorant of because generations of demonic contamination has muddied their minds. Most importantly, John attempts to ready Christians (as avenging exorcists) for a per-formance that should strive for the status of a public spectacle. As Christian sol-diers ritually harangue and route demons from the souls of Judaizers, if possible they are to do so in Antioch’s public, visible spaces. John wishes his exorcistic spec-tacles to convey, if not promote, important religious, cosmological, and even onto-"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 95logical diff erences to the spectators. As we will consider in his Adversus Judaeos homilies, John trains his listeners in the exorcistic tactics as a form of strategic “spectacle.” Th e Christian’s acts of assault and cleansing of a demonically plagued Judaizer or Jew should take place in public precisely because such exorcistic encounters, as impromptu ritual/religious performances, display for the public and delineate within Antioch an essential hierarchical divide between a divine, salvifi c Christianity and a demonic, damning Judaism.RETHEORIZING DEMONIZATIONMany who have treated the Adversus Judaeos homilies have acknowledged demon-ology’s central role in John’s construction of religious identity: How does John use the category demon to delineate religious space? In fact, moving from “demons” as material entities in the environment to the vaguer qualifying term “demonic,” many have drawn upon Jonathan Z. Smith’s characterization of that category as a “measure of distance, a taxon, a label applied to distinguish ‘us’ from ‘them.’ ”21 John constructs a demonic worldview to establish “a complex system of bounda-ries and limits” to separate his Christian community from the surrounding world.22Th anks to studies such as these, which demonstrate John Chrysostom’s pro-found dependence on the demonic, we are continuing to uncover the extent to which rhetorical strategies of demonization fi gure in late antique Christianity. While these studies are of tremendous importance with respect to the theoretically savvy readings in recent late antique scholarship, they present the word daimōn as a discursive object. Such interpretations view daimōn as an evidentiary token of the powerful ability of rhetoric to create Christian worldviews. As we have seen, scholars generally view daimōn as an ideologically charged, discursive category that measures the distance between the Self and Other; it establishes a complex network of boundaries, borders, and divisions delineating individual and group religious identity. In other words, these studies thoroughly explore the boundary-hatched landscape that the text creates, and the demon’s place in that landscape. Still, they rarely then make any connection with the actual world of living ritual practice and thus material interaction with other religious bodies. Finally, a demonization reading oft en fails to contextualize such a reading within the larger late antique world that everyone in it believes is teeming with material demons.Here we attend more closely to the development of ritual practice and the con-struction of ritual agency in an animated environment, and this leads us to a dif-ferent set of observations within Smith’s article. To be more precise, we are prima-rily interested in expanding on Smith’s comments regarding the placement of “demonic” in his larger project of locative versus utopian mapping in the ancient world and the manner in which such mappings intrinsically tie ritual practice to cosmological construction."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"96 John Chrysostom and AntiochIn a locative cosmology, which features a horizontal map of center and periph-ery, man is in place at the center and the demonic is on the margins or the out-skirts. If the demonic trespasses into the center, it is cast out through ritual: rituals of exorcism, expulsion, and boundary protection, for example. Th e utopian cos-mology, by contrast, rests on a vertical map of “this world” and the “beyond.” While the demonic is fully at home in this worldview, man is out of place. In this scenario, rituals are aimed at the human in order to move him into the next world: rituals of deifi cation, initiation in the aft erlife, and so forth. Th is cosmology involves an apocalyptic worldview.However, neither of these maps satisfi es in our case. Smith off ers a third map that has tantalizing possibilities for explaining the purpose of the power John claims for the “soldier of Christ” aft er baptism. Moreover, Smith’s third map spe-cifi cally attends to the issue of demonic possession and addresses the power and violence of ritual confrontation; his description of this third map, therefore, is worth quoting in full:Th ere is yet a further Late Antique map which returns to the horizontal but which abandoned the cosmological for the anthropological. Here the boundary, which pro-tects man against external, hostile powers, becomes the religious association, the social group. Th e threat is no longer perceived as chaos or exile—but other men, pos-sessed by demons or sorcerers. Rather than place or transcendence of place, the new center and chief means of access to the divine center will be a highly mobile holy man whose chief skill is that of negotiation rather than the older skill of relocation or the utopian power of salvation.23Smith refers here to the holy man and mentions Peter Brown’s roughly contempo-raneous article “Th e Rise of the Holy Man,” particularly in its treatment of this religious fi gure in his terrain outside the urban sphere. Smith’s third and fi nal map fi ts our scene in Antioch quite well, though we should not restrict ourselves to the socioreligious type of holy man or the nonurban geographical terrain when con-sidering possible kinds of displays of exorcistic power.Th at is, the highly mobile holy man does not have to be confi ned to the nonur-ban, nor does he have to be the lone exemplar in holiness. And yet, as I argue in the introduction to this study, this is exactly what we have made of him, and we have done and continue to do so when imagining the locations and fi gures anchor-ing the spectacular and public expression of antidemonic power—particularly in the fi elds of patristic studies and early Christian history. Still directing our gaze over both the holy man and the urban landscape is a residual belief that the city is a rational, disenchanted space, a hermetically sealed vessel for ferrying classical civilization’s values safely through to Western modernity. Th us it has been diffi cult, if not impossible, for moderns to imagine charismatic, antidemonic ritual agents as part of a regular congregational community in a city. But as I argued in chapter"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 972, John develops a model of baptized Christian identity that belies this modern rational view of the city and the church’s place in it. John (rather hopefully) confi g-ures Christian soldiers as highly mobile, aggressive holy men and women. Th is is not a role for every baptized individual, and certainly not for any of the unbaptized and uncommitted congregants. Th at said, John encourages—and in cases of extreme heteropractic threat (such as Jewish High Holidays), implores—stronger Christians to seek out demonically plagued brothers and sisters to exorcise them. In his vivid, perhaps bombastic, display of a baptized Christian’s antidemonic power over the weak, Judaizing Christian or the Jew, John lays the groundwork for boundary—a religious and ritual divide that he hopes will explode into view in a moment of sudden, suprising ritual attack and captivate the accidental or haphaz-ard spectator as well.A MOST DIABOLIC JEWISHNESSTh e late fourth century is an era, and urban Christianity an area, of ritual experi-mentation and competition. Th is is especially the case regarding ritual formula-tions of exorcism and conceptualizations of demonic possession or affl iction. While there is a great deal of variation in practice and belief—perhaps more than consciously realized to date in early Christian scholarship—one principle held true for all cases. Exorcism is predicated fi rst and foremost on the identifi cation of someone or something as demonically possessed or demonically corrupted. With these initial comments set to the side, we may now turn to the Adversus Judaeos homilies. Th roughout, John builds a complex aetiology of a demonic possession of the entire Jewish people. John queries, “Is it not strange that those who worship the one crucifi ed join in celebration with those who crucifi ed [him, i.e., Christ]?”24 In this passage, John does not treat deicide as a past event, or an act confi ned to text; instead, it is a present and future reality: “[Th e Jews] who roar ‘Crucify him, crucify him,’ [say] ‘Let his blood be upon us and upon our children.’ ”25By ahistoricizing and decontextualizing Christ’s crucifi xion, John loosens local Jewish populations from their fi xed identity in this late antique city. Th ese are not individuated Jews constituted from their own actions in fourth-century Antioch. Rather, they are an inextricable part of a corporate, atemporal, homicidal body. Jews had murdered Christ in the fi rst century, and they now exist in intimate prox-imity to Christians in Antioch in the 380s. John uses demonic possession to stretch Jewish homicidal proclivity into the present day. He turns to the language and theology of Romans 1:18–32 to craft this demonology, in particular verse 24, in which God abandons (paradidōmi) mankind. As John explains in the Adversus Judaeos text, as a result of the Jews’ complicity in the crucifi xion “they were aban-doned (prodedomenous) by God.”26 He explains further, “God’s rejection is utterly complete.”27 In Romans, Paul addresses those who, despite having known God,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"98 John Chrysostom and Antiochchoose to worship the creature over the creator. God’s punishment is swift and irrevocable: “Th erefore God gave them up (paredōken) in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the degrading (atimazesthai) of their bodies among themselves.”28Th ese exorcistic encounters, if modeled on John’s own, are to take place in pub-lic, as we have already mentioned. Peter Brown describes the aspect théâtral of the holy man/exorcist, which links the possessed and the exorcist in a ritual dialogue that has “a stylized, articulated quality of an operetta.” Th e exorcist and the exor-cized compel spectators to watch a performance:a dialogue [between the possessed and the exorcist] is worked out as a controlled explosion and interchange of violence. Th e demon in the possessed abuses, and even attacks the holy man: and the holy man shows his power, by being able to bring into the open and ride out so much pent-up rebellion and anger. It is a dramatic articula-tion of the idea of the power of the holy man.29Peter Brown’s still brilliant analysis of the holy man fi ts John’s construction of the stronger and baptized Christians in the Adversus Judaeos homilies; John asks such members in his community to become masters over the demonic, and thus to learn how to diagnose and expel the demons wherever persons controlled by demons threaten to contaminate the lives of Antioch’s citizenry. Th e performative aspect of the exorcistic encounter is of primary importance: the exorcistic per-formance pivots on the themes of violence and authority according to Brown. John understands the eff ectiveness of abusing, taunting, and interrogating a person in order to force the demons into the open. Still, there is a fundamental diff erence between John’s circumstance and Brown’s explanation. Brown describes a situation where both the possessed and the exorcist believe the former to have been pos-sessed, and they each voluntarily enter into the duet or dialogue (for the most part). In the case of John Chrysostom, this priest demands of his baptized Chris-tians an especially diffi cult task: they have to approach others in the community and cajole—perhaps force—them to partake in a kind of exorcistic ritual experi-ence, one that will involuntarily mark them as demonically contaminated with the Judaizing disease.From a diff erent angle, though—that is, from the perspective of performative ritual—we may gain a wider view. John asks his stronger Christians to move out into Antioch in groups, seek out Judaizers, and isolate them. Th en through a relentless, public interrogation, which involves questions intended to shake the authenticity of the Judaizers’ Christianity, these stronger Christians, as exorcists and in fi rm control of the ritualizing situation, are in eff ect to perform a demonic possession on them—discursively (and performatively) at least. Let us reconsider the situation: shell-shocked Christians with a weaker conscience make the mistake of trespassing into Judaizing; they will be completely thrown off guard when one of their baptized brothers or sisters approaches to accuse them. John warns that"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 99some will fl y off into a rage; others may cower and shake in silence. Very few will regain their equilibrium in time to stand and answer calmly. In other words, John’s Christian soldiers/exorcists act as the primary ritual agents (and agitators); as such, they are in control in instigating the Judaizers’ reaction and then in defi ning and directing the meaning of that reaction. If the so-called weaker Christians (or Judaizers) react—perhaps in anger (and justifi ably so)—the exorcising Christians hold the upper hand: he/she can easily translate it within the wide spectrum of demonic reactions. Judaizers, in a reaction of violence, irrationality, simmering anger, even silence, will only helplessly prove the truth of their demonic posses-sion to any spectators. How can they not appear possessed, especially with a help-ful interrogating Christian/exorcist guiding and defi ning the event?First, of course, in their public setting and theatrical tone these events will establish the power of the stronger Christians as the holy men and women of the congregation. According to the homilies, moreover, stronger Christians will not have to wait until an actual exorcistic encounter to establish authority. Th e devil has stolen many of John’s congregation and is now holding them hidden in Juda-ism.30 Th ose struck down with the Judaizing disease will hardly seek help and ask for exorcism; Christians are obligated to hunt for them. Th ey should search in groups of two or three at a time, women rescuing women, men rescuing men, children rescuing children, slaves rescuing slaves.31 If a Christian spots a Judaizer, he must denounce him (kataggellein).32 Another technique involves spreading out “nets of instruction” (diktya tēs didaskalias) so that they will be able to compel those whom Judaizing has made mentally and spiritually incapacitated to bend to the laws of the church.33 John also advises shouting out phrases from the Pauline epistles. What this essentially means is that the Christian on the hunt continually utters Christian language—and thus compels the Judaizer to come forth. In observing silence or engaging in frivolous speech, a Christian is only helping the devil; the Judaizer can remain hidden from his congregation indefi nitely, captured by the devil himself, who now holds the Christian victim tightly within Judaism.34 By contrast, John insists that performative utterances of Pauline excerpts will have an intriguing compulsory eff ect on the Judaizers:For many savage and roused animals, when they lie hidden under thickets and hear the voice of the hunter, spring up out of fear. And oft en, driven out forcefully by the violence of the [hunters’] call, they fall into their nets. And so your brothers lie hid-den in a thicket of Judaism. If they hear the voice of Paul, I well know that they will fall easily into the nets of salvation, and they will escape every error of the Jews.35John demonstrates to the would-be exorcists what words to use, how to per-form ritually, and, fi nally, where to hunt. Searches for Judaizers should cover the city, but, as John’s dramatic narratives relate, a Christian on the hunt will always fi nd Judaizers at Jewish festivals and in the synagogue. Aft er Christians fi nd a"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"100 John Chrysostom and AntiochJudaizer, John commands that they must fi rst “bind [him/her] tight with your words of exhortation (episphiggontes autous tōi logōi tēs paraineseōs).”36 Such exhortations act apotropaically or exorcistically and force Judaizers to come out of hiding. John uses similar language in the Catech. illum. when he discusses the antidemonic power inherent in “the words of the exorcists.”37 Aft er identifying the Judaizer and, in a sense, holding him/her with language, the exorcism, as John defi nes it, begins in earnest. Th e homilies suggest that John elsewhere provided ritual formulae, scriptural phrases, and serial questions for Christians. He also attempts to prepare Christians for their encounters by craft ing scenes of highly choreographed verbal assaults set “in the fi eld,” so to speak—that is, near or in the synagogue: e.g., his interaction with the Christian man in front of the synagogue and his direct address to the Christian wife drawn to the festivals with the Jews (see chapter 2). He provides these scenes to serve as scripts for Christians when they encounter their own Judaizers in the public sphere. In approaching such pas-sages as indoctrinating texts, we can recover certain facts regarding John’s con-struction of exorcistic encounters between stronger Christians and Judaizers.We can perhaps appreciate at this point the localized and situational nature of exorcism. Exorcism is hardly a one-size-fi ts-all ritual. John’s view of exorcising Judaizers departs signifi cantly from the holy man’s exorcistic rituals in the desert. John’s exorcism of Judaizers fi nds anchor in his understanding of the Jews’ demoni-zation and dehumanization. When they killed Christ, God gave them up (paradidōmi); their souls were fl ooded with the demons of lust, sex, desire, and all forms of excess; rationality, self-control, and moderation no longer pertained. Th e same held true for the mind of the Judaizer—in abandoning the church for the synagogue, we see the Judaizer also move from control, rationality, and temper-ance to lack of control, irrationality, and intemperance. Th e Judaizing disease con-sists ontologically of a demonic corruption, which ravages the mind’s ability to engage in self-control and reason exegetically (and thus discern the diff erence theologically between Judaism and Christianity). Th e only means of regaining the health of the mind (dianoia) and establishing thinking once again, especially for navigating through the diff erences between Jews and Christians, is through a pref-erably public exorcistic encounter. In light of the cognitive complexity of the dis-ease, how can the blunt, compulsive force of an exorcism heal a Judaizer? Once again, John does not advocate the holy man’s exorcisms; rather, he understands a delicate ritual choreography that involves strategically aimed and precise forms of speech to cleanse the minds or souls of the Judaizers. In the application of Chris-tian (ritual and therapeutic) language, one must be careful not to use any “sophis-tic, rhetorical, and circuitous arguments.”38 Th is is the devil’s language, not Christ’s. Instead, John off ers a series of questions, which will easily entrap and then help to heal those suff ering from the sickness of Judaism.39 John describes Christian psy-chagogic techniques as delicate tools used in a much more meticulous form of"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 101exorcism—he designs the antidemonic verbal assault to rout the diverse and deeply rooted demonic contaminants of Judaizing:For not all sins need exhortation and counsel (paraineseōs, symboulēs). But there are some sins that, by their nature, require correction by an excision quick and sharp (tomēi syntomōi kai oxytatēi). Th e wounds we can tolerate respond to more gentle cures; those that have become rotten and are incurable and feed off what remains of the body require a cauterizing fi re with the point of steel (aichmēs sidērou deitai phlo-gos). Th us it is with sins; some require lengthy exhortation; others need an abrupt rebuke.40In Adv. Jud. 8, John provides a substantial list of questions intended to conjure to the surface, and past a heavy demon-induced haze, any shred of self-realization remaining in a Judaizing Christian:I will ask each one who is sick [with Judaism], “Are you a Christian?” Why then do you so admire [the rituals] of the Jews? Does not a Persian understand [the rituals] of the Persians? Does not a barbarian admire [the rituals] of the barbarians? Does not one who inhabits the land of the Romans follows our customs of citizenship (politeia)? Tell me, if someone living among us should be captured thinking about rituals of these [others], is he not directly punished without argument and examina-tion, even if he has ten thousand ways of defending himself ? . . . How then aft er you have converted to a such a transgressive form of life (politeia), will you be worthy to be saved?41Th is set of questions underlines an aspect of Brown’s analysis that has great bearing on John’s view of exorcism. Brown specifi cally describes exorcisms as “controlled explosions and interchange of violence.” In John’s view as well, the exorcist holds all power as the person who asks the questions; he moves with his bound Judaizer through a well-rehearsed choreography of questions, formulae, and exhortation that he knows intimately; with well-placed questions and Pauline accusations he can control a Judaizer’s verbal responses and emotional reactions, running the gamut from stunned silence to explosive rage. In the homilies John constructs a model of exorcistic agency that is exceedingly powerful. Th us it is important to note what John prepares his exorcists to expect out in the fi eld. He warns that the verbal methods may have to be more extreme: a Christian may have to use force, strike, insult, or argue with the person. He mentions elsewhere that a diseased brother may retaliate with like force: “Even if he hates you, if he insults you, if he hits you, if he threatens to be your enemy, if he menaces you in any other way,” you must continue.42Th e issue of violence is especially interesting in John’s suggestion that stronger Christians should enter the homes of their weaker brethren even if the weaker Christians do not know them. As long as these Judaizers are rumored to be suff er-ing terribly from the Judaizing disease, an exorcizing Christian can and in fact"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"102 John Chrysostom and Antiochshould enter that home to perform an exorcism. What is particularly intriguing is how quickly John’s instructions shift from unbridled goodwill to deliberate decep-tion. Eventually this seems to trigger his discussion of the expectation of violence; in fact, this text leads one to ask if John is warning the exorcizing Christian of the Judaizer’s inevitable violence, or if he is setting up a situation to ignite the so-called Judaizer’s inner demonic anger.To return to the text, in Adv. Jud. 8.5.2–3 John instructs congregants on the methods of attaining access to the sick man’s home: “If you do not know him, if you have no connection with him, get busy and fi nd some friend or relative of his, someone to whom he pays particular attention. Take this man with you and go into his home.”43 Th ere is no dishonor in this rescue, nor is there shame in starting with a diff erent topic of conversation “so that he does not suspect the real purpose of your visit is to set him straight.”44 John suggests that the Christian entering the stranger’s house should fi rst ease him into a convivial and unsuspecting mood by talking about something other than the active subject of Judaizing. Th en the Christian soldier should turn abruptly to the subject of Judaizing. In this way, the Christian may more easily dislodge false beliefs from the suff ering person’s mind, barraging him with questions that attack the validity of the Jewish religion.45 Here, especially, John warns that the Christian should anticipate (or perhaps we should read “precipitate”) a violent reaction.46John thus constructs a complex, nuanced model of exorcistic encounter with Judaizers for the stronger (i.e., baptized) Christians in his congregation. Th is model pinpoints three variables or factors that when pulled together and interwo-ven into a unifying demonology pull apart Christianity and Judaism (and destroys all the interstitial, ritual tissue connecting the two through ambiguous Judaizing practices) and then properly defi nes a Christianity triumphant over a demonized and dead Judaism in Antioch. Th ese three factors are the following: (1) the Chris-tian exorcist’s unparalleled ritual agency (and/or comprehensive control over all aspects of exorcism), (2) outbursts of violence during exorcism, and (3) exorcism as spectacle.SILENCING THE DEMONS’ JEWSIn the fall of 387, John begins his rally against the Jewish High Holidays early. In Hom. 4 and 5, delivered ten days before the fasts, John explains that the previous year he had not realized the same necessity for vigilance: “But today the Jews, who are more numerous than any wolves, are bent on surrounding my sheep.”47 Th is year John’s congregation has decreased signifi cantly, at that moment of the year in Antioch in which Jews blow trumpets to announce the rituals, festivals, and fasts that God has forbidden outside the land of Jerusalem. For Antioch’s Jews, however, the destruction of the Jewish temple—of Jerusalem itself—is irrelevant. In fact,"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 103according to John, his city’s Jews blithely ignore God’s involvement in these events and thus his purpose—that is, to render these rituals forbidden outside of Jerusa-lem and beyond a certain era. Stubbornly deaf to God and his law, Antioch’s rabbis continue to announce to everyone who will listen that they will be celebrating all ritual aspects of the High Holidays—prayer, worship, fasting, and dancing; the entire population of the city is welcome, and indeed encouraged, to join in.On the eve of the Jewish High Holidays, with the weight of Judaizing already pressing heavily on his congregation, John reminds his listeners of the previous year’s blasphemous excess. He recalls the damage suff ered by the souls of weaker Christians, stretched dangerously thin between the church and the synagogue; moving back and forth between Eucharistic nourishment and the Jewish fasts, religious identity is pulled taut into a frangible ontology. John proclaims to his audience that the salvation of the vulnerable in his congregation is again at stake. But during a time of such entrancing Jewish spectacle, it is a futile exercise to try to persuade Christians to look and listen in a diff erent direction. A rhetorical strat-egy alone, John believes, is insuffi cient to rescue weaker Christians whose senses are keenly eager, if not habituated, to engage in Judaizing during this time of the year. At this point, the way John would have us imagine it, early fall has all of Anti-och ritually salivating for Jewish festivals, dances, and fasts, which are off ered almost orgiastically. How can John possibly hope to cut off sensory communica-tion between his Christians and the Jewish community—especially when Jewish mouths seem to emit more than words, and Jewish words convey something much more insidious than communicative language?In Adv. Jud. 5 John announces an aggressive, off ensive plan of action. He intends to battle with Jews directly; in his words, he will “spar” with them.48 Th ough he provides only a few enigmatic clues regarding his plan to fi ght with the enemy, we can discern a few tantalizingly evocative hints within Adv. Jud. 5: John shares his plan “to silence” (epistomizein) the Jews and their shameless arguments.49 He intends also “to stitch their mouths shut” (aporrhapsai ta stomata).50 Th ese two phrases may not seem to provide much information to the modern eye. Nonethe-less, when put in the proper ritual fi eld of late antiquity—particularly the context of religio-magical ritual texts, the words “to silence” and “to stitch their mouths shut” unfold. Quickly, they reveal a rich worldview of verbal/spiritual combat, simultaneously fought at the human and suprahuman (divine/demonic) levels.51 In fact, this language provides a link between Adversus Judaeos and Catecheses ad illuminandos within the theme of spiritual warfare.While we might understand these phrases in the context of oral debate, in light of what is at stake for John the rhetorical interpretation is unfulfi lling. It leaves too much up to chance with regard to how John perceives the danger and diabolism of the Jewish opposition, as I discuss further below. Instead I argue that there is another, more compelling way to read these phrases, that is, in the literal manner:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"104 John Chrysostom and Antiochthe ability of Christians to silence Jews through the sheer power and authority of their speech. And, as discussed in chapter 2, we understand that language can pos-sess compulsory force; John describes a similar theorization in the effi cacy of lan-guage here. Perhaps an even more persuasive argument presents itself from the material evidence in and around Antioch and Syria. Archaeologists have uncov-ered ritual texts and objects that substantiate a widespread belief in the power of binding rituals (katadesmoi) to prevent people from speaking publicly—in ora-torical performance, court cases, and the theater, for example. It is believed that a person can silence another person through the media of ritual texts, objects, and gestures, thus physically preventing their ability to speak. Moreover, literature attests amply to this practice. A famous and equally convenient example is found in Libanius’s Oratio 1. Already discussed in chapter 1, Libanius attributes migraines, gout, and various illnesses (which do, in fact, prevent him from working) to “spells, incantations, and the hostility of sorcerers.”52 In addition to this example, Libanius mentions several times that he has been accused of engaging in similar binding spells and magical acts to sabotage his competitors’ rhetorical and oratorical gift s.In the growing popularity of the High Holidays and Passover, John recognizes the tightening grip that Judaizing has on his city. He also sees an increasing need to silence instantaneously and irreversibly the Jews who not only have the major festivals of autumn and spring but, between the seasons, deliver exegeses, perform rituals, and provide a place and objects of apparent holiness to stoke the embers of anticipation for the two major festivals: all of the perverse Judaizing noise and spectacle that emerge seductively from the synagogue to beguile and captivate the city’s ears. John and his congregations are quite familiar with the power of kata-desmoi texts; magicians sell these to seal shut one’s enemies’ lips, hold their tongues, steal their voices, or capture their thoughts. Th ough the methods of silencing are diverse, and frequently perverse, the eff ect is oft en the same. It is an easily available and highly adaptable ritual form that is appealing to anyone needing certain voices silenced.In the remainder of this chapter, then, we situate a consideration of John’s terms—“to silence” (epistomizein) Jews and “to stitch up the mouths” (aporrapsai ta stomata) of Jews—in a broad and loosely comparative framework with this sub-group of binding spells.53 In stating our analytical frame up front, we wish to draw attention to certain methodological points. To clarify, this is not a reductive com-parison of John’s “silencing” spectacles with magical “binding” rituals for silencing victims. Frankly, the evidence in John’s corpus is insuffi cient to allow this kind of reading. Neither is this a bare-bones mechanistic or functional juxtaposition in order to conduct a form-critical analysis of the ritual structure.Instead, we loosely juxtapose John’s description of silencing rituals with exam-ples of silencing curses (defi xiones); what is essential in this comparison is that these two forms of ritual language emerge from the same animistic worldview."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 105Th erefore, John’s silencing techniques and the curse spells both fi nd a place and also take shape within the same general framework of ritual instrumental and ver-bal power. Th rough these acts of silencing demons, John attempts to Christianize (and diabolize) that worldview.In his instructions for silencing exorcisms, John Chrysostom articulates intrac-table diff erences between himself and stronger Christians on one side and a steeply sliding diabolic scale of (redeemable) Judaizers to (soulless) Jews on the other. By describing Jews and regular binding spells in the same context, John links ritual speech to performance and spectacle: ritual silencing represents an aggressive competitive spectacle of power and authority over and against other religious spectacles/performances in the public sphere. John describes stronger Christians dramatically silencing and stitching the mouths of Judaizers and Jews at the height of the High Holidays.To understand what John means by silencing techniques or spectacles, we need to compare what John does not intend, by taking a tour through binding rituals in late antiquity. Additionally, it is also essential to delineate how distinctive a target the demonic Jew and Judaizer are in John’s silencing rituals, which involves an analysis of John’s construction of Jewish diabolism in his Adversus Judaeos homilies.In the performative act of silencing a Jew or Judaizer, John and his Christians undoubtedly are creating power and authority for themselves. Such an observa-tion is so commonsensical to religious scholars today as to be practically worth-less. Nonetheless, it yields more useful questions. What is the perceived nature of the power that John and his Christians accumulate? What kinds of authority do they possess? Charismatic? Socioreligious? Political? How can John and members of his congregation sustain this power and authority? How does this power and authority refl ect on their ritual agency? And, related to this, how does the perfor-mative display relate to their religious identity?54Th is crucial distinction organizes John’s understanding of how Nicene Christi-anity’s antidemonic battle maps onto his modeling of ritual encounters with Jews versus non-Jews in Antioch. John describes Jews as a people entwined historically with demons; they have been—and still are—infl uenced by them and helped by them, and have sacrifi ced to them. But, most signifi cantly, they have never been possessed by them. Indeed, John describes a long-term, if not originary, relation-ship between demons and the Jewish people in its entirety: that is, demons relate to Jews at the level of corporate ethnē, not individual anthropos. When they killed Christ, Jews, an already mendacious people, only entered more deeply into a rela-tionship with demons that they had established long before. God then gave demons permission to inhabit or intertwine with the entire Jewish people permanently (paradidōmi). However, this is not the same as possession. Demons have, in a sense, been given sovereignty over the Jewish nation (ethnē); they have not become"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"106 John Chrysostom and Antiochidentical with its members. Each Jew is now only an indistinguishable part of a nation reborn in the aft ermath of that homicidal act and reconstituted from the subsequent cosmogonic fallout; in the process, the Jew was demonically fused or blended into a larger, amorphous shape of Jewish culpability. From that day to this, every man, woman, and child has lost whatever was left of his or her individuality. Th ere is no longer an individuated, discrete soul to save in the Jew; a soul or mind emblematic of the possibility of a rational, free-thinking, controlled Self was lost with the crucifi xion, when God abandoned the project of protecting and fortifying what little remained of the Jewish soul. In John’s estimation Jews had continuously made improper choices even before Christ’s death, leading them down a path of habituated familiarity with a demonic taste for ritual practices—such as sacrifi cial practices—that they have been incapable of abandoning. But until Christ’s death God still tried to help reform their ability to choose to stop their ritual practices; however, at that point, in light of their obstinancy, he abandoned the Jews.BINDINGJohn G. Gager has shown that the use of defi xiones (curse texts) is widespread in lawsuits from classical Athens through the late imperial Roman period.55 A large body of material attests to the shape and form of this practice against judicial or oratorical opponents.56 Th ese texts as well as relevant literature indicate that a defendant purchases or commissions a defi xio from a professional magos, who inscribes the names of the client and the victim on a lead tablet. Oft en these inscriptions include invocations to deities, demons, and corpse demons for the purpose of binding the mind and tongue of the victim in order to render him/her speechless in court.Th e reasons behind the use of such texts are clear. A person feels threatened by the words that another publicly pronounces against him. Th e danger is such that the defendant seeks supernatural recourse to silence the opponent, and the sheer number of defi xiones that we have provides strong evidence of the pervasive belief in the power of words to change the course of events in the realm of public oratory. Words, in a ritualized context, can stop other words. Th e popularity of the practice induces many orators to blame the magical arts for their own failures in public speech. Cicero describes a lawyer who, having forgotten his speech, resorts to blam-ing spells and curses for his lapse.57 More relevant to our purpose, Libanius claims to have been the victim of such magical practice, as discussed in chapter 1. Plagued by migraines, he loses his interest in the written and oral word; he complains, “When-ever I ventured upon [making a speech], I was carried off course, like a boat in a contrary wind, so that, while they kept expecting a discourse, I would fall silent.”Eventually, Libanius and his students discover a dead chameleon in his class-room, “with its head tucked in between its legs, one of its front legs missing, and"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 107the other closing its mouth to silence it.”58 Th ese cases demonstrate that the ancients consider the environment of public oratory to be vulnerable to human interference through supernatural means. Th us people use ritual texts and oral formulae to sabotage public speech.John Chrysostom, in sync with the rest of the population, recognizes that the realms of magic and public oratory overlap. Accordingly, his focus on the cleans-ing of the mind and the tongue not only draws extensively on the Stoic view of the therapeutic eff ect of certain speech practices on the state of the soul; his injunction to employ Christian formulae to “curb” and “stitch shut” the mouths of Jews also draws meaning from the cultural understanding of the relationship between pub-lic oratory and magical practice. Many defi xiones specifi cally target the mind and the tongue. For example, one text dated to 300 BCE mentions several opponents; the client requests that the tongue, soul, and speech of each be bound.59 At one point, the text also asks for the binding of the evidence that one opponent has. In a separate defi xio found in Cyprus, dated to the late second to mid-third century CE, the text petitions the demons under the earth to silence someone by the name of Ariston who apparently spoke in anger against the person who commissioned the defi xio.60 Th is spell employs familiar ritual words to forge an arrangement with demonic powers to silence the verbal opponent: horkizein, exorkizein.61 In eff ect, the defi xio forges an oath between the ritual practitioner and certain invoked demonic powers in the name of other great gods (usually of the underworld) in order that those demons can take away the anger and power of Ariston and make him speechless (aphōnon) and breathless. Th e spell invokes the “king of deaf/voiceless demons” to “bind (katadēsate) and put to sleep (katakoimisate) the tongue of my opponent Ariston.”62 Elsewhere the spell requests that the demons “take away the voice” (paralabete tas phōnas) of and silence (phimōsousin) Aris-ton.63 A second defi xio beseeches the same subterranean demons to take away the voice of the opponent, rendering him speechless, wordless, and without language (alaloi, aphōnoi, aglōssoi).64 Th rough these means, people seek to rob their ene-mies of the power to hurt them verbally.While power in both the silencing curses (defi xiones) and John Chrysostom’s silencing rituals reside in the words themselves, these silencing rituals diff er in their perceived anthropology. A defi xio isolates and condemns another person’s linguistic power. It may be simple witness testimony that is to be silenced—or a more formidable oratorical skill. A tongue—or more to the point a voice—and an education (rhetorical/oratorical) to guide that tongue/voice commands great cul-tural value and symbolic weight in late antiquity in general. Th is wealth of protec-tive and assaultive magic and curse texts, which regulates the relevant practice of public oratory, attests to the cultural importance of these skill sets in late antiquity.By contrast, John wishes to use an antidemonic, holy power in verbal combat against the demons in Judaizers as well as against the demons who have taken over"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"108 John Chrysostom and Antiochthe Jews’ souls. According to John, Christian arguments curb the tongue and silence the mouth of the Jew who tries to entrap the weaker in the congregation, as psychagogy cleanses the mind of the Judaizer. Th e act of the verbal confrontation itself serves to dramatically identify the Jew as the mouthpiece of a demon and his words as the demon’s tricks. A strong Christian’s words will nullify the power that the Jewish words have to entwine, seduce, and alter the entire religious and ritual behavior of weaker Christians.In addition to the anthropological diff erences, cosmology (or the human-daimōn relation) also contrasts in the two ritual practices. In the case of the defi x-iones, a ritual agent forges arrangements with neutral demonic power(s) for the purpose of silencing a free-speaking, self-empowered human speaker. By contrast, John once again views a Christian’s opponent as somehow actually under the con-trol of a demon, who guides his speech and hearing, and consequently his entire behavior, and thus requires expulsion. Chrysostom silences an opponent through exorcistic encounter with a daimōn or, in the case of the Jews, by silencing or bind-ing the demon within.In constructing the diabolism of Jews, John hews closely and faithfully to the language in Romans. Like Paul with the Gentiles, John is unforgiving with the Jews. God has given them up (paradidōmi); there will be no second chances. Th us, in John’s view Christian exorcism is a useless ritual weapon against actual Jews. At the most basic level, for an exorcism to work the possessed has to have an indi-viduated soul, a chance for psychic reformation. While the Jew may not be actually possessed, John views the diabolic or demonized Jew as more dangerous than a person who is demon-possessed. Such a diabolic or demonized person has an ability—a singular purpose—to spread demonic contagion, not just suff er it, and to that extent, John argues, it is imperative to stop that person (if indeed he/she even qualifi es as a person). More importantly, it is imperative that Christians stop the Jews’ method of contaminating others with the Judaizing, demonic disease.John plans to “spar” and do battle with Jews. He will silence them and curb their mouths. But he hardly intends to do this alone. At the same time as he trains Christians to exorcise Judaizers, he is training them for a diff erent form of encoun-ter against Jews. Before going into battle, Christian soldiers fi rst have to know their enemy. In Hom. 4 and 5, John recounts a bleak ritual history of Jews before Christ and describes how an almost congenital religious failing has passed through his-tory and come to express itself with an almost singular intensity in present-day Antioch.John constructs the bestial qualities of Jews easily using biblical texts, referring to Isaiah, who identifi es them as dogs, and Jeremiah, who describes them as mad stallions.65 It is not as though the Jews suddenly take on these characteristics: rather, they “pursued [the] lustful habits of these animals,” which are manifested prominently in a crazed desire for sacrifi ce.66 Indeed, according to John, God rec-"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 109ognizes in his chosen people a lust for sacrifi ce that makes them look worse than the Gentiles. While pagans at least display “fi rmness in their error” in idolatry—a strange form of honor and integrity among heathens—Jews express none of this.67 Instead, sudden waves of rapacious yearning for “worshipping idols and serving demons” systematically erode their faithful adherence to God, and they move back and forth erratically between allegiance to and rejection of God’s strict prescrip-tions against idolatry.68 Jews’ general desire for sacrifi ce is an egregious violation of their relationship with God. God was torn, watching them descend into a kind of ritual depravity:For when [God] saw them maddened in their desire for sacrifi ces, he also saw if they did not seize [upon this desire], they were prepared to go on their own over to the idols. . . . For aft er the celebration which they completed for the wretched demons, [God] allowed the sacrifi ces.69John makes it clear that, although God had been lenient, he acted in the capac-ity of a doctor treating a sick and potentially recoverable patient. He had off ered a kind of medicine: sacrifi ce was strictly controlled through being allowed only in Jerusalem. In a sense God had created a sanitized or sterilized space and time to allow Jews to drive the desire for sacrifi ce safely out of their collective system. Finally, however, God allowed the destruction of the Jewish temple of Jerusalem to bring the practice to an end.70 Th e destruction of Jerusalem in its entirety would ensure that Jews would not and could not lawfully seek sacrifi ce again. By that point, aft er hundreds of years of ritual recuperation in the Jewish temple cult in Jerusalem under God’s care, Jews should have been (for the most part) capable of understanding their proper ritual relation with God. It is not one that consists of sacrifi ce, but rather one in which love and faith are primary. If ever they feel them-selves weakening, the law will soothe their emerging desire for a return to sacrifi ce.John applies a similar philosophy to fasting and Passover.71 Th ere is a time and place for the rituals tied to the memorialization of these sacred events. And while the time of the year is important regarding the ritual practice, and the duration of the ritual even more so, the place in which Passover is celebrated trumps all else. Passover can be celebrated only in Jerusalem. To prove the salutary eff ects of God’s law, John points to the Jews during exile. He makes it quite clear in his reading of Psalm 136 that the Jews in Babylon did not celebrate Passover during any of their long years of exile: “Neither [did they] off er sacrifi ces, nor fast, nor [keep] the feasts.”72 Th ey resisted all such ritual practice, despite the continual prodding of their hosts: “For their barbarian captors were urging them by force and demand to play their musical instruments, ‘Sing to us a hymn of the Lord.’ ”73 Despite tempta-tion, despite their torture, the Jews were able to resist performing any rituals for the Babylonians’ amusement because God had wisely put laws in place. In his medicalization of Jewish ritual practice, we might understand John’s description of"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"110 John Chrysostom and AntiochGod’s law as acting as a kind of inoculating booster (if we may slip into an anach-ronistic metaphor). Whenever Jews feel an inevitable outbreak of sacrifi cial fever (an incurable and chronic condition), they can fi nd relief and strength in a pre-script from the law enabling them to continue on in faith in God alone. And this, John seems to imply with his example of the exilic Jews, has worked with most of the Jews throughout history.74Unfathomably, however, they seem incapable of completely letting go of the now-forbidden rituals. Th ough Antioch’s Jews live in an improper time and place for the performance of most of their ritual practices—a historical truth appreci-ated by all but this particular Jewish population, it seems—the city’s Jews blatantly ignore the law of God. Th e community in Antioch seems immune to or unaware of the law’s salutary eff ects. To underline the audacity of his city’s Jewish popula-tion, John applauds the strength of the Jews forced into Babylonian exile. Th ey were deprived of the comforting familiarity of Passover and other religious rituals; in fact, they chose ritual self-deprivation rather than practice what the law prohib-ited—namely, Jewish rituals in a foreign land.75 Th eir noble, selfl ess choice casts a shameful shadow across the ritual indulgences of the Jews in Antioch. John uses the comparison to reveal further a shocking lineage of Antioch’s neighbors. He traces an almost direct line from the “mad mares compelled by a lustful desire for sacrifi ce” in the pre-exilic period, to those culpable in Christ’s crucifi xion (a sacri-fi ce of another kind), to the Jews dancing in Antioch’s synagogue, fasting, and blowing the trumpets, seeking new forms of sacrifi ce.76 Th e only Jews missing from the Antiochene Jews’ history seem to be those who were exiled to Babylon. Th is genealogy, etched in sacrifi cial blood and demons, explains the Antiochene Jews’ relentless drive to seduce and defi le weaker Christians.But John is quick to point out that there is something that distinguishes the Jews of today from their ancestors. In the past, God sheltered the Jewish obsession with sacrifi ce in a Jewish temple and in His holy city of Jerusalem. Today, however, the Jews have neither a temple nor a holy city protected by God’s hand—and yet they continue to engage in ritual veneration:At the very fi rst I said, if there ever was a time when the violation of God’s law was allowed, soon thereaft er this became a transgression—a justifi cation for ten thou-sand punishments. Th ere was a time when Jews sounded their trumpets, that they had their sacrifi ces, but now [God] did not allow [these practices] to them.77God had allowed the Jews to blow the trumpets over holocausts and feast off erings a long time ago. Th e purpose of the trumpets at that time, according to John, was to help Jews get over the need for sacrifi ce in the safe environment of the temple. With God’s destruction of the temple and Jerusalem, the time for sacrifi ce was over, and the purpose of the trumpets directing them to the locations was at an end. By John’s logic, not only is the blowing of trumpets announcing such rituals"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Spectacle of Exorcism 111no longer needed, but the sound of trumpets is a ritual herald that deceives and misleads everyone around. Moreover, it is a direct aff ront to God. Aft er all, such an action can only be announcing to Jews that the rituals of Jewish sacrifi ce and feast off ering are taking place with God’s approval, which according to the law is not the case.John and the stronger Christians have to stop members of the congregation from joining the Jewish festivals, which are condemned by God. John had seen the power of diabolic Jews the previous year. It had been quite easy for them to Judaize the congregation. Th is year, therefore, he begins his campaign early. He has ten days to protect and divert weaker Christians. If he and his soldiers of Christ can silence the Jews and stitch up their mouths before they even have a chance to com-municate to Christians about the festivals, or to provide theological or soteriolog-ical justifi cation for attendance, it may be possible to save a few Christians from falling prey to the call of the devil’s trumpets.In his Adversus Judaeos homilies, John mandates that stronger, baptized Chris-tians seize weaker Christians and cleanse them of the demonic Judaizing disease. Th e ritualizing spectacle performs the boundary between Christianity and Juda-ism; it inscribes a divide between divinity and diabolism; it clearly projects an ontological disparity between the spirit-fi lled exorcist and the demon-possessed Judaizer. And all of this takes place in the streets of Antioch, in its forums, in its open basilicas, in front of its synagogues—and in the homes of Judaizers, but, as in this last case, always with witnesses.What is essential in all of these cases is the spectacle. Th e spectacle of exorcistic performance announces a power dynamic of the exorcist over and above the abused Judaizer. It follows the shape of the ritual exorcism, the victim of demonic possession falling into the standard position of someone victimized, confused, in pain, and potentially exploding into violent spasms, which Peter Brown describes following anthropological models, and which John Chrysostom repeatedly warns against in the Adversus Judaeos homilies. John describes these demonically pos-sessed Judaizers screaming, hitting, biting, and abusing the exorcist—a most vio-lent case of Judaizing possession. John’s homilies are a fascinating test case for exorcisms forced on an unwilling population. Th e pathology of demon possession and exorcism in this age of experimentation and ritual exploration and competi-tion is very similar to socioreligious outrage and marks the beginnings of or acts as a catalyst to religious violence.A fi nal point before we depart from John’s congregations, Antioch, and the later fourth century for an earlier period of the post-Constantinian age in Jerusalem during the early, tumultuous years of Cyril’s episcopacy. It is important to keep in mind exactly when John intends his stronger Christians to enter the fray and engage with Judaizers in the streets of Antioch. He does not imagine this event as taking place every day of the year, or even any day of the year. Instead, he is"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"112 John Chrysostom and Antiochspecifi c. Th e homilies themselves have been occasioned by the sudden drop in the number of his congregants because of the festivals at the synagogue during Passo-ver and the High Holidays. Scholars have long recognized this. But it is also on these days specifi cally that John asks his Christians to venture out into the streets to encounter Judaizers—and quite possibly Jews. Th is is not accidental; nor is it convenient. On these holiest days of the year for Jews, on the days that Jews are in the streets of Antioch projecting piety, John asks his strongest Christians to engage in a performative ritual play that will potentially project the opposite. He asks Christian exorcists/soldiers of Christ—defenders of the Lord, once cut down by Christ killers long ago—to confront the children of Christ killers in strategic, exorcistic encounters.What does John expect will occur? Does he expect Christians to expose Jews’ demonic nature for all of Antioch to see? I propose that, at the very least, John is striving to accomplish a visible juxtaposition of spectacles: a degraded version of Jewish High Holidays with diabolic Jews and Judaizers on the one hand, and in contrast a superior image of Christian strength or power vanquishing that Judaiz-ing demonism/diabolism—most likely in the person of a Judaizer as demonically possessed—in one of the most recognizable ritual scripts: exorcism.What do people see? How do these performances aff ect outsiders’ views of Judaism? How do these performances aff ect congregants’ views about their own community? Do they attempt to duplicate a similar ritual attitude in their own dealings with outsiders? Whether or not an actual “spectacle” of Christian exorcis-tic strength over and against Jewish diabolism in fact takes place is beyond our ability to know. However, reading from an animistic perspective as I have done here suggests that John projects the image of such spectacle into the minds of his listeners and divides the streets of Antioch even more clearly between Christian (divine) and Jewish (demonic)."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"part t woCyril and Jerusalem"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"115Aelia Capitolina’s bishop, Macarius, writes to Constantine in 325, seeking permis-sion to begin an excavation: he wishes to unearth the site of Christ’s crucifi xion and tomb.1 Constantine grants the request without hesitation.

Just beneath the surface of Aelia Capitolina are the remains of an altogether diff erent urban environment: the Holy City of Jerusalem.

In what ways might we imagine locally shared and contested views of the Holy City as informing Cyril’s reactions to Constan-tine’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre?Eusebius’s narrative provides details of Constantine’s discovery of the tomb and reconstruction of the city.

What of those who actually live in or visit the city? How do they see Aelia Capitolina before Macarius’s request is granted? How might they assess the suitability of Constantine’s buildings in the reawakening of Jerusa-lem? Do local Christians appreciate Constantine’s manner of honoring the discovery of the tomb? Or disagree with it? Finally, what types of interpretive tools and kinds of evidence will enable us to discover the answers to these and many other questions? We have to wait a few years, until 333 CE, to encounter a visitor’s impression of Constantine’s Holy City. Th e Bordeaux Pilgrim’s description is laboriously thor-ough, if somewhat dry.6 As a result it has slipped quietly through generations of scholars’ interpretations, with few noticing that the author buried in his descrip-tions his somewhat critical assessment of the Christianizing eff orts in Aelia.7 Later in this chapter, a close reading through the text will yield a sense of the Pilgrim’s disapproval, especially in the case of Constantine’s basilica. His note of dissent is subtle and easily missed; still, it does invite us to consider who else may have disap-proved of Constantine’s lavish manner of adorning the city of Christ’s crucifi xion.A full generation has to pass before history preserves the impressions of some-one who lives in the city, quite probably witnesses its transformations, and, moreo-ver, declares a defi nitive opinion regarding Jerusalem’s post-Constantinian appear-ance once the emperor’s basilica is fi nished. In 349/50 Cyril begins to preach as the newly appointed bishop of Jerusalem.8 He presents an altogether diff erent if not confl icting approach to defi ning and apprehending the true Holy City of Jeru-salem. Rather than emphasizing the importance of the resurrection and the tomb presented through Constantine’s new, lavish structure—the Church of the Holy Sepulchre—Cyril privileges the eternal event of the crucifi xion that took place in Jerusalem; likewise, he promotes the sign of the cross. Th e young bishop neglects the new imperial construction in present-day Aelia, and instead emphasizes the importance of the ritual process (baptismal rituals) through which a person is able to experience the true Holy City of Jerusalem—an urban environment that perennially experiences Christ’s passion and death. Cyril describes ancient,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 117yet timeless, cosmogonic moments that continue to exist in the Holy City just beyond a person’s perceptual grasp, behind the diabolizing illusions of the present-day city of Aelia Capitolina.Cyril’s Christological choices—crucifi xion over the resurrection—certainly dif-fer from those of Constantine.9 However, more is involved in the measure of dif-ference between the two men. In his baptismal preparation, Cyril moves quickly from mere diff erence of opinion to construct an active stance against the emper-or’s promotion of the resurrection. Cyril oversaw baptismal training that endows a person with ritual agency and power to see the true Holy City of Jerusalem hid-den behind Aelia’s demonic illusions.Cyril desires to bring the local Christian population into experiential coher-ence with the true Holy City: a Jerusalem rooted in the living imagery of Jesus’s crucifi xion and the salvifi c cross as well as other biblical moments. Th rough the ritual process, from the daily exorcisms to the fi nal anointing with oil and the Eucharist, a baptizand progresses from a state of demonic blindness to experienc-ing an indwelling of the Holy Spirit that illuminates the senses. A baptizand begins training trapped by his sensory limitations and capable of perceiving only the sen-sory world. Aft er baptism, a Christian soldier is capable of experiencing an eter-nally existing Holy City of Jerusalem; such a person can see past Constantine’s basilica, spectacles of Greek divination, or Manichaean gatherings and pierce through to the cosmogonic moment of Christ’s crucifi xion in Jerusalem.By the end of the century, according to the pilgrim Egeria’s account of Good Friday, we encounter a Jerusalem transformed and immersed in the cult of the cross. How might Cyril’s conceptualization of the Holy City and his baptismal training have contributed to this shift ?Th e bishop’s chair is placed on Golgotha behind the cross, where he now stands, and he takes his seat.

Th us from the sixth to the ninth hours the lessons are read and the hymns said, that it may be shown to all the people that whatsoever the prophets foretold of the Lord’s Passion is proved from the Gospels and from the writings of the Apostles to have been fulfi lled. And so through all those three hours the people are taught that nothing was [other] than can be conceived, that done which had not been foretold, and that nothing was foretold which was not wholly fulfi lled.

While Constantine has money, bricks, and gems, Cyril has only the ecclesiastical tools of his trade: ritual speech and activity. However, he also lives in an age that has a highly developed visual sense of language: in many ways ritual innovation in word and deed can prove much more powerful than the most expensively jewel-bedecked religious monument.11 Cyril recognizes in his baptismal training the ritual means of converting Christians to his visual under-standing of his environment: that is, the diabolizing illusions of Aelia opposed to the divine illumination of the crucifi xion within the true Holy City of Jerusalem; through their baptism Cyril draft s Christ’s soldiers into a spiritual warfare in order to recover the true Holy City. As we shall discuss in this and chapters 5 and 6, Cyril’s cult of the cross owes at least a degree of its success to the bishop’s ability to speak in a language and through categories of visual and sensory apprehension and revela-tion known to members of his congregation.Th is chapter is occupied with describing the Holy City of Jerusalem’s appear-ance through history. Th us, we trace the structures, spaces, and places in the urban sphere that maintain special meaning through the centuries of foreign conquest and rebellion. We explore tensions that emerge in the disparity between the ide-alization of the Holy City of Jerusalem and the reality of a city perennially vulner-able to the surrounding geopolitical situation and consider how this informs Cyril’s own view of Aelia versus Jerusalem.Th is chapter also explores how people—not only fourth-century Jerusalemites, but those loyal to the city throughout history—have actively visualized, and imag-ined, the Holy City of Jerusalem. How one sees, or visually apprehends, the Holy City and what that image conveys has always been inextricably rooted in the bibli-cal history of Jerusalem as an embattled holy city. Jerusalem’s narrative is straight-forward, almost predictable, in light of its repetition: fi rst, the Holy City suff ers multiple invasions by a much more powerful foreign ruler; next, that foreign authority destroys key religious monuments that have defi ned the holy character"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 119of the city; and fi nally the new authority orders or threatens to order the construc-tion of ideological/religious topography representing its conquering power.Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, Vespasian, and Hadrian, for exam-ple, all leave material marks of the remains of the buildings they destroy as well as ones they build.12 Each of these rulers contributes to an irrefutable sense of the violence that plagues Jerusalem’s relationship with conquering/colonizing foreign powers. As we will discuss in this chapter, the confl uence of archaeological, historical, and most especially literary material helps to generate our portrait of the Holy City of Jerusalem.Modes of perceiving, sensing, and inevitably reacting to the experience of los-ing the Holy City develop in reaction to the harsh reality of a destroyed or drasti-cally altered Jerusalem: ritual practices emerge alongside literary genres to provide a means of surviving and enduring that loss. Th is chapter argues that such memo-rializing practices—long a tradition in Jerusalem—shape Cyril’s own visual under-standing of the Holy City, a mode of experiencing the true city that he attempts to pass along to his baptizands. In this chapter, then, let us set Cyril to the side and look toward his congregants and other local populations as we imagine how they all engage in ancient, local strategies for seeing Jerusalem.In order to see Aelia/Jerusalem though the eyes of fourth-century Jerusale-mites, this chapter is loosely comprised of two parts. Th e fi rst issue pertains to the memorialized history of the Holy City’s foreign rulers—violent invasions followed all too oft en by the total, unforgiving destruction of religious buildings and monu-ments and, in many cases, followed once again by the ruler’s construction of new, foreign religious monuments.13 We will consider the repetition of this pattern: How does the pattern shape the local inhabitants’ expectations? Do people develop a sense of their own individualized visual and sensory relationship with their fallen city? How might a conquered and colonized population somehow retain an image or sense of their Holy City aft er it has been destroyed and replaced? What does the local populace see and experience when they encounter the remains and ruins of their dead city? Do they read a warning? A threat? Or do they see a vener-able memorial to the holiness that once existed and might yet return?Secondly, we will consider the rich apocalyptic literature that arises in direct reaction to foreign conquest and destruction.14 In texts such as 4 Ezra (2 Esdras), 2 Baruch, and Revelation, for example, we have various examples of certain indi-viduals endowed with a divine sight to see through to a Jerusalem and in some cases a Jewish temple that has endured. Th is chapter posits that apocalypticism in general and apocalyptic texts dealing with Jerusalem and the Jewish temple spe-cifi cally help to shape the visual expectations within certain local religious groups in Jerusalem.Various traces of the Holy City of Jerusalem—despite its repeated experiences of imperial persecution and violence—always exist quietly in the shadows, in the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"120 Cyril and Jerusalemcracks and the crevices of Aelia’s vulnerable foundations. Th is chapter surveys his-torical and literary pieces representing the violence, destruction, and persecution in Jerusalem, and then suggests how Jerusalemites use such pieces to animate or reanimate the Holy City of Jerusalem.Starting in the sixth century BCE and then repeating through history, inimical foreign authorities attack Jerusalem and destroy her most sacred religious monu-ments and buildings. Strategic building construction oft en follows, foreign powers planting their own religion into Jerusalem’s brutalized soil. Th is is a consistent theme throughout history; an implacable principle of violence has situated Jerusa-lem in an antagonistic relationship with external foreign powers. Th is situation exists in our period of interest, until fi nally in the early second century Hadrian destroys Jerusalem altogether.In what follows we will examine how Jerusalemites develop a pattern of scrip-tural/textual and ritual practice as a mode of resistance under foreign rule. We will briefl y consider the periods aft er the fall of the temple (70 CE), aft er the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–35 CE), and into the fourth century under both Constantine and Julian. Local populations collect particular strands from Jerusalem’s sacred history and maneuver the assembled material to resuscitate their Holy City.In the fourth century, for example, imperial power has an endless supply of brick, marble, and jewels to defi ne the topographical image of Jerusalem, and the manpower to destroy it. By contrast, Jerusalemite Christians, like many before them, have only texts, language, and rituals through which to animate their sense of the Holy City. As we will see, though, texts, language, and ritual off er a powerful combination. Th rough these three, diff erent people have turned to the task of gen-erating the Holy City of Jerusalem and then have held it at arm’s length, a Jerusa-lem only perceptible to those who have been ritually initiated into a heightened, illuminated, and spiritual mode of perception. A sense of the Holy City’s enchanted nature emerges in the ritual process that alters a person’s sense of the temporal and spatial and moves a person from limited sensory perception to unlimited spiritual illumination. Th is chapter examines these processes closely in the apocalyptic texts of 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch. In the next chapter, we will consider the manner in which Cyril draws upon these earlier texts in developing his own Holy City of Jerusalem.THE FALL OF THE TWO TEMPLESTh e emperor Hadrian demonstrates a keen awareness of how cultural memory interacts with—and can be manipulated by—space to create a strong sense of place. In the tradition of Vespasian and Titus, he continues a “policy of deliberate destruction.”15 In other words, he continues to demolish what remains of Jerusa-lem and strategically leaves in place the Holy City’s surviving rubble and ruins"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 121aft er the Bar Kokhba revolt.16 As Peter Walker explains, nothing of religious sig-nifi cance is left for Jews or Christians to hold on to:Palestine was deprived of the symbol of Jerusalem. For 200 years, the ‘Holy Land’ was without its crowning religious jewel, the mystique of Jerusalem; for 200 years paganism had been seeking to abolish the religious attraction, which Jews had felt towards the ‘holy city’ of Jerusalem. As yet, therefore, Christians had neither the occasion nor the desire to appropriate that mystique and to make Jerusalem a ‘holy city’ of their own. Caesarea now came to the fore in its stead. . . . Th e age-long func-tion of Palestine as a religious center was at its lowest ebb.17Eventually, when Hadrian fi nally rests from the task of overseeing the careful and precise reconstruction over and around what is left of the Jewish city aft er the demolition of 70 CE and the recently renewed destruction of 135, he carefully draft s a deliberately small Roman colonia. In doing so, he draws attention to the shadowy outlines of what had been the religiously consequential, proud, holy city of the Jews, which has not truly existed for over sixty years. Jews have not been living in Jerusalem in any great numbers since 70. Hadrian bans Jews from living in the city altogether, allowing their return only once a year, on the ninth day of the Hebrew month of Av, to mourn; there is scattered literary evidence of this expul-sion of Jews from Jerusalem. (We will return to this topic in greater detail below.) Hadrian also shrinks the city to half the size it was before the destruction of the Jewish temple. Nahman Avigad’s excavations indicate the impressive city of Jeru-salem is reduced to, and renamed as, the insignifi cant provincial town of Aelia Capitolina.18 Th e typical city grid, with the Cardo (north-south) and the Decu-manus (east-west) crossroads, can still be traced in the streets of the present-day city. And, according to Günter Stemberger, the Cardo carries the fl ow of people between the Damascus and the Zion gates; the Decumanus extends into the city from the Jaff a Gate.19 Scholars have traditionally presumed that the Roman army camp of the Legio X Fretensis is located at the city’s highest point, south of the Decumanus, dominating the now-shrunken civic space from the city’s southwest corner.20 Here, near Mount Sion, the army’s permanent presence since 70 con-stantly reminds residents and interlopers in Aelia of Rome’s ability to stop any who contest its rule. Hadrian further amplifi es Rome’s presence by recalibrating the city’s civic anchor: due north of the army camp, on the next highest hill, is the loca-tion where Hadrian erects a forum and his temple to Aphrodite.21 Dio Cassius also describes public baths, a theater, a temple to the Capitoline gods, and a sanctuary to the Nymphs as part of this building project.22 Th e much later Chronicon Pas-chale describes a large ceremonial gate with twelve entrances to a public esplanade, two public baths, and a theater.23“[Hadrian] displaced the Old City with a new, Gentile one, set further to the west. Th is alternative site of Roman power was dedicated to its begetters, the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"122 Cyril and Jerusalememperor himself and Jupiter Capitolinus: Colonia Aelia Capitolina.”24 Th e temple of Aphrodite fl anks the western side of the Cardo Maximus, which cuts through the new, shrunken Roman town. Th e cult site to the goddess of love sits to the north of a market forum, perched above this new, busy section of Aelia.25 Aphro-dite’s temple is the centerpiece of Hadrian’s forum and a cornerstone of his project of urban transformation—a strategic means of erasing, if not off ensively deriding, what little remains of the ancient city of Jerusalem. Some scholars have argued that Hadrian’s Capitoline temple also stands in the southern portion of the forum, making this the new civic center of Aelia and helping to draw attention away from the Temple Mount.26Th e Aphrodite temple, together with other Hadrianic monuments, eff ectively alters the city’s sacred landscape; it also redirects and redefi nes the religious focus of the city. On the level of architectural and topographical aesthetics, the Aphro-dite temple functions to pull inhabitants’ eyes away from the Temple Mount, which—despite its devastated state, or even because of it—continues to demand attention. Moreover, through its cult and priesthood the forum temple also intro-duces a new mode of history in Aelia by ritually organizing the lives of the Hadri-anic city’s new and reshuffl ed inhabitants. Th e Aphrodite temple—together with the Jupiter temple, religious statues, and other sacred monuments in the newly formed Aelia—function to overwhelm any lingering memory of Jerusalem’s par-ticularist history that ties terrestrial roots to biblical prophecy and Jewish eschatol-ogy. Hadrian intends these religious monuments and cultic activity to draw together its citizens in a polytheistic cultic rhythm set within a larger, universal historiography of the Roman Empire. A steady pulse of polytheistic festivals, pro-cessions, and celebrations conveys a totalizing narrative of Roman strength, vic-tory, and religious benefi cence.27Sacred buildings, whether in Jerusalem or Aelia Capitolina, are never simply sacred buildings. Th ey are religious monuments situated in strategic interactive relation with other monumental buildings—the entire urban landscape—as well as with the people who inhabit, visit, or worship in the city. As long as the cult in the Aphrodite temple is active and in full sight of the Temple Mount, it relays a message of Hadrianic imperial victory and, more importantly, the fi nal and defi n-itive defeat of cultic Judaism in Jerusalem. Two centuries later, aft er the cult in the Aphrodite temple has ended, the temple again projects a signifi cant message—though the content of that message will be quite diff erent. Before discussing this shift , however, let us fi rst visit the religious monuments that present an interesting challenge, as well as opportunity, to any conquering force in Jerusalem.Before its destruction, the Herodian temple was one of the largest, grandest, most sacred monuments in the eastern regions of the empire. In the second cen-tury, long aft er the temple’s destruction, the Temple Mount itself still encompasses some thirty-nine acres. It is an elevated space prominently visible, and it had hov-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 123ered impressively over ancient Jerusalem; in the radically shrunken space of Aelia it dominates the landscape to a much greater degree and occupies more than one-fi ft h of the inhabited territory. Th e Temple Mount still manages to demand atten-tion from all inhabitants, wherever they stand.28 No matter what Hadrian builds or destroys on its surface, nothing will take attention away from the simple fact of the Temple Mount itself and the inescapable history or histories it continually forces on the inhabitants of the current Aelia.Much of that history has been neatly, vividly, preserved in Josephus’s Bellum Judaicum:While the holy house was on fi re, everything was plundered that came to hand, and ten thousand of those that were caught were slain; . . . children, and old men, and profane persons, and priests were all slain in the same manner . . . as well those that made supplication for their lives as those that defended themselves by fi ghting. Th e fl ame was also carried a long way, and made an echo, together with the groans of those that were slain, and because this hill was high, and the winds at the temple were very great, one would have thought the whole city had been on fi re. Nor can one imagine anything either greater or more terrible than this noise, for there was at once a shout of the Roman legions who were marching all together, and a sad clamor of the seditious who were now surrounded with fi re and sword. Th e people also that were left above were beaten back upon the enemy and under a great consternation, and made sad moans at the calamity they were under; the multitude also that was in the city joined in this outcry with those that were upon the hill. And, besides, many of those who were worn away by the famine, and with their mouths almost closed, when they saw the fi re of the holy house they exerted their utmost strength, and broke out into groans and outcries again. . . . One would have thought that the hill itself on which the temple stood was seething hot, so full of fi re on every part of it that the blood was greater in quantity than the fi re, and those that were slain more in number that those that slew them, for the ground did nowhere appear visible, for the dead bodies that lay on it.29Josephus’s description permanently inscribes the tragedy of the temple’s destruction in 70 in the Bellum Judaicum and so too in the cultural memory of any who read and share knowledge of Josephus’s text. Th e Jewish historian solidifi es and confi rms in future minds a boldly vivid and provocatively emotive under-standing of one of the pivotal events in the history of early imperial Roman con-quest and control. Th e violence of the temple’s destruction is indeed shocking. Yet the children’s screams, fl owing blood, sizzling fl esh, and crushed bones, as well as the aching, burning misery of a people’s severed connection to their God, are essentially ephemeral, transitory experiences; the survival of those memories is contingent upon capricious interests of history makers as well as the practices of oral history and collective memory as cultivated in diff erent communities. In fact, most who record the temple’s fall neglect this level of detail and strip the event"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"124 Cyril and Jerusalemdown to dehumanizing facts.30 Th us we fi nd an important contrast in Josephus’s description. Th rough his depiction of physical suff ering and fatal violence Josephus constructs a graphic and empathetic memorial that preserves the devastating end of Judaism’s cultic religion. In fact, his narrative gains the impregnable stability of a physical monument in its own right. Even more so—unlike a physical building or statue, his testament is invulnerable to Roman authority’s power to destroy and potentially erase all memory of the religious structures of a rebellious people.Before entering and encountering the city and seeing the Temple Mount, most spectators no doubt have some grasp—however vague—of the terrifying devasta-tion that had occurred upon its surface. Aft er 135, Hadrian turns to this raw space as a focal point and a stage for projecting an image of Rome’s—and Hadrian’s—impregnable and unrivaled power. In consideration of Josephus’s depiction of the violence that took place, it is intriguing to consider what kinds of images inspire the emperor’s views regarding the fallen city and inform his decision not to rebuild Jerusalem but found the city of Aelia Capitolina instead. While this is impossible to determine defi nitively, Annabel Wharton is certainly correct that Hadrian’s “aversion to reconstruction was manifestly political”; it is not impossible that Josephus’s passage may have infl uenced the emperor’s decision to leave a rather sizable amount of temple ruins in place as a physical and visual counterpart to the Jewish historian’s text.31 While most of the temple has been razed to the ground, recent excavations indicate that even as late as the Byzantine period “parts of the Temple to a considerable height must have remained standing.”32 Hadrian also reportedly incorporates stones from the temple into the theater he builds.33 In any age in which precious resources are hard to come by, the reuse of past building materials is certainly not unusual. Nonetheless, Hadrian’s choice to use Judaism’s most sacred building materials for a morally tainted structure such as a theater hardly seems an innocuous choice; rather it is an act bearing a clear message of anti-Jewish disdain. For the most part, though, a great deal of the temple’s and Temple Mount’s ruins are left in place.Hadrian’s decision to leave the rubble conveys a powerful image. Th e aban-doned, scarred surface of the Temple Mount speaks of a city carrying the burdens of a violent religio-political history. It is an undeniable sign of Rome’s defeat of not only Jews but also Judaism. Hadrian intends its surface to declare loudly from the eastern edges of Aelia that the Romans have won and that the Jewish temple—the monument unifying Jews throughout the empire—will never rise again. Th e emperor’s alterations project an insistent declaration of Roman power: in this case, an expression of power over a Jewish population that has already been defeated and crippled.Intriguingly, Hadrian’s dramatic display of crushing conquest and defeat focuses on a population that is supposedly no longer allowed to live in the city. Some have argued that Hadrian intends the display for the populations brought in"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 125to replace the Jews: Syrians and Arabians. Th e Temple Mount—memorial to a colonized population’s ruthless punishment—will then serve as an eff ective reminder to Aelia’s newly transplanted inhabitants of their own subjugated posi-tion. Jews will also see the devastating reminder of their ancestors’ defeat on the one day they are allowed to return to Jerusalem: their annual day of mourning, Tisha B’Av.34Th ere is an important question that we must settle before continuing on to fi n-ish our portrait of Aelia/Jerusalem. What is the state of Aelia’s Jewish population from the Hadrianic era to that of Constantine? What audience does Hadrian intend for the lessons he has carved so violently into Aelia’s topography, especially when we consider the Temple Mount? Th e exclusion order that Hadrian report-edly places on Jews exiles them from Aelia and a large swath of what has been Judaea. For a long time scholars have been satisfi ed with the ancient testimony that indicates the fi rm standing of the ban: for instance, Tertullian and Justin Martyr mention the Hadrianic ban against Jewish entry. Scholars have used their testi-mony to put together a reconstruction of the original edict: “It is forbidden for all circumcised persons to enter or stay within the territory of Aelia Capitolina; any person contravening this prohibition shall be put to death.”35Recently, though, scholars have suggested that the appearance of the law’s invi-olability depends more upon Eusebian insistence than actual practice. While the bishop of Caesarea claims that Hadrian strictly forbids Jews from “gazing on the soil inherited from their fathers,” what actually occurs regarding Jewish presence in Aelia and Palestine during Hadrian’s reign may be beside the point.36 Aft er Hadrian’s death, enforcement of the law may have grown lax; once we reach the third century, economic and military crises trump concerns regarding who resides in Aelia Capitolina. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that Antoninus Pius may have allowed resettlement beginning as early as 138.37Certain scholars have proposed that a small group of rabbis possibly takes up residence in Aelia in the third century. In her exhaustive textual and archaeologi-cal study, Joan Taylor mentions the rabbis Hanina, Jonathan, and Joshua ben Levi, who visit Aelia’s Rabbi Meir and settle there briefl y with a group of pupils.38 Ta y l o r argues that this demonstrates an extreme relaxation of the practice of the law dur-ing this period.39 It also invites speculation. What are the rabbis teaching? What texts interest them? How do they perceive and discuss the fall of Jerusalem? Who listens to them? When it comes to considering the fact of Jewish inhabitance in the next century, debate continues. Traditionally, a number of scholars have insisted that Constantine actually reinstates Hadrian’s anti-Jewish edict. Th is is a time period of imperial and ecclesiastical plans for Christianizing the city and return-ing Jerusalem to its divine status—this time as a Christian holy city. Jewish inhab-itants present too vivid a reminder of the Jews’ precedence in and predominance over Jerusalem’s holy status."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"126 Cyril and JerusalemWhile at fi rst glance this seems plausible, the evidence for Constantine’s harsh action depends upon one source dating to the tenth century. In addition to the paper-thin nature of this evidence, in the fourth century Cyril admonishes his baptizands to stay away from their normal habit of attending the synagogue—a declaration that not only points to the pervasive spread of Jewish activity (and therefore population) but also to Jewish/Christian mixing. It is therefore very likely that there is a Jewish presence in Aelia throughout the fourth century; and, indeed, this is the view of Jan Willem Drijvers, Oded Irshai, and increasingly other scholars.40 Drijvers observes that the Bordeaux Pilgrim refers to seven synagogues on Mount Sion; out of the seven one remains standing in the fourth century.41 He also points to Cyril’s evidence as suggesting that Jews and Gentiles may have mixed in Jerusalem Christian communities during the fourth century. He goes further, though, and makes the bold proposal that in fact Jews are not forbidden from the Temple Mount until the end of the fourth century; in his view it is only aft er that point deep in the Th eodosian era that the Jewish presence is reduced to the right of return once a year. Th is introduces important questions regarding Jewish-Christian interaction, such as how Jewish ritual and exegetical practices intermix with analogous practices in Macarius’s, and later Cyril’s, church. Similarly, to what extent do Jewish and Christian communities share, discuss, or debate conceptu-alizations of Jerusalem as a Holy City?A Jewish presence in Aelia introduces interesting possibilities. Scholars have considered how Hadrian manipulates the debris on top of the Temple Mount to project Roman invincibility as well as the Jews’ and Judaism’s defeat. Aft er 70 and then again aft er 135, however, the Temple Mount arises as a new, undefi ned space. It is available to everyone or to no one. Th e Temple Mount off ers a tabula rasa of sorts to the multitude to create, to interpret, and to enact religious, political, and social meanings. Th ese meanings can overlap, shift , and compete back and forth almost mercurially among diff erent religious populations. From those mourning the Second Temple, which had once stood atop the now-empty Mount, to those rejoicing in its debris-covered surface, to those in need of its eternal emptiness as a sign of Christ’s ability to prophesy the temple’s destruction, to those in anxious fear of the temple’s eschatological return—for all of these, the Temple Mount is generously, obligingly polyvocal, as might be expected in a religiously pluralistic city under a foreign colonialist control.Th e Temple Mount projects a powerful message to anyone who lays eyes upon the site. Th e ruins which rest on top of it cast images of war, devastation, and loss over the entire city. It is relatively easy to discern Hadrian’s message in the rubble strewn across the surface: the Temple Mount bears perennial witness to Rome’s justifi able act of imperial domination over a rebellious—and now utterly defeated and devastated—Jewish population; Jerusalem and Jews will never return to their former state. Th at Hadrian may intend this meaning is hardly surprising. Th at"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 127said, there are other ways to read the ruins atop the Temple Mount than what Roman imperial ideology dictates.Judaism’s covenantal theology presents an altogether diff erent manner of read-ing the site. Th roughout biblical history, as Yahweh’s directions move the chosen people, the Israelites, forward, he imparts upon them a supplemental covenantal agreement (e.g., Abrahamic in Genesis 12–17; Mosaic in Exodus 19–24; Davidic in 2 Samuel 7, also Jeremiah 33; priestly in Exodus 29:44–46). God promises divine pro-tection as well as expansion in land and people through generations and strength in war, for example, in exchange for a commitment to fulfi ll their own promises. While Jews suff er through foreign rule, violence, destructive oppression, and even near-annihilation (e.g., the Assyrian capture of Israel; Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylo-nian exile; Antiochus IV Epiphanes and the Seleucids; and, fi nally, the Romans), the catalyst for each fall is the same: Jews have violated some aspect of the covenant. Th eir arrogance, pride, idolatry, or simple neglect have brought about foreign inva-sion and devastation. So too, then, an opportunity for atonement is always available, followed inevitably by a reinstatement of the covenantal relationship. By renewing and rededicating itself to the principles of the covenant, a forsaken Jewish popula-tion repeatedly has the opportunity to regain God’s favor—whatever that entails. Th e Holy City of Jerusalem can then rise again, fully restored.Th is line of thought presents tantalizing possibilities for imagining Jewish iden-tities carved out in distinctive resistance to or rejection of the Hadrianic city and awaiting the return of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Can anti-Roman behavior/thought—as opposed to obedience and assimilation—lead to divine reward? Can unrelieved fi delity to the idea of the Holy City of Jerusalem and Judaism evoke divine blessing? If such is the case, how might such a discourse shape local Chris-tian views of the return of the Holy City of Jerusalem?SEEING HIDDEN JERUSALEM:APOCALYPTIC VISIONARIESIn the aft ermath of Jerusalem’s and the temple’s destruction, the Holy City contin-ues to exist unharmed and even to thrive in apocalyptic eschatological literature.42 Despite the apparent material devastation that Rome’s armies bring down upon a suff ering populace in Jerusalem, these texts speak of a holy but hidden city that continues to exist untouched by Rome. Th e true Jerusalem is a city of timeless divine endurance; it is a city of eschatological inevitability; it is also a city visible and accessible to a very few. Only those capable of divine visionary experience can see through the illusion of the ruins and rubble to apprehend the reality of the true Jerusalem.43 So too only those individuals able to communicate with angelic medi-ators can develop the ritual means of releasing the hidden and holy city to the surface of their perceptual reality.44 While there are many apocalyptic visionary"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"128 Cyril and Jerusalemtexts from this period, we will explore two. Th e apocalyptic works of 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch share many commonalities pertaining to the relationship between the ritual development of visionary experience (with the aid of angelic mediators) and a personalized revelation of the Holy City of Jerusalem.45 Likewise, these two texts inscribe a harsh division between the visionary who is capable of seeing the true Jerusalem and can gain hope in that experience, and the rest of humanity who are incapable of seeing (or thinking) beyond the destruction and devastation.46 Only “ritual virtuosos” can catch a glimpse of the true Holy City of Jerusalem—and in that ability they fi nd a measure of freedom from the political realities of the city’s actual devastation.4 Ezra (2 Esdras) is written in the reign of Domitian and may thus refl ect, according to Adela Yarbo Collins, the violent persecutions of that reign as well as diffi culties that befall Jewish Christian communities in the wake of the destruction of the temple.47 Th e text of 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) eventually makes it to the Latin West in now-lost Greek translations. Th ough a refl ection of the destruction of the tem-ple in 70 CE, the text depicts the protagonist, Ezra, as he struggles in the wake of the earlier destruction of the temple in 586 BCE. While 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) seems not to have enjoyed an aft erlife in Jewish literature, it is absorbed into Christian circles surprisingly early. Th e text divides into seven sections or seven visions per-taining in some manner to the earthly dilemma of Jerusalem’s destruction; thus, the text is not concerned with heavenly tours or descents into hell, but is situated fi rmly on earthly terrain and concerned with in/visible realities on earth in the present and future. Th e fi rst three sections include dialogues in which Ezra calls to the angel Uriel and laments to him that he does not understand the vision. In each interchange Ezra begins from a point of utter despair, but aft er hearing Uriel’s explanation of the eschatological meaning behind the vision Ezra’s disposition changes and brightens. Th is repetition, a performative establishment of their rela-tionship, establishes Ezra’s heightened ritual status as his relationship with the angel (and thus the supernatural) deepens—a status heightened through specifi c ritual practices. In the fi nal two visionary episodes Ezra reaches a particular enlightened level that enables him to take on his role as the new Moses and assume the task of writing new scripture.Structurally similar to 4 Ezra (2 Esdras), 2 Baruch is written around the same time and is also set in the period of the First Temple’s destruction. Likewise, 2 Baruch also fi nds a fi rm place within the growing genre of early Christian apoca-lypticism. As already mentioned, both texts emphasize the important relationship between ritual practice and visionary experience. Both texts take care to identify who will be granted access to the true, divine vision of Jerusalem; each insists that only those demonstrating pious loyalty to Jerusalem and displaying unyielding belief in what God has promised the city are worthy to see Jerusalem as it truly is. Even so, these exceptional individuals, whose limits have already been tested by"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 129the threat or reality of foreign invasion, must also engage in preparatory ascetic ritual practice before they can receive apocalyptic visions.4 Ezra (2nd Esdras) demonstrates the central importance of completely sur-rendering oneself to the mysterious plan and judgment of the Most High, espe-cially when facing only devastation and misery. To that end, the text repeatedly portrays Ezra as exactly following whatever instructions Uriel off ers. Only com-plete obedience will enable Ezra to receive a vision that reveals the reason for Jeru-salem’s misery. In the conversations between Ezra and Uriel, the angel explains to Ezra that he must pray, weep, and fast for seven-day intervals for each of his visions. While Ezra never questions any of the angel’s commands that lead to the fi rst three visions, he stubbornly refuses to accept each vision’s meaning and thus God’s harsh judgment involving Jerusalem’s earlier destruction and the judgment that only a very few among Israel’s people will be deemed worthy for salvation.48Rather than soothe Ezra’s increasing dismay, Uriel intensifi es the preparatory rituals required to trigger a fourth vision; the angel asks Ezra to travel to a fi eld of fl owers that has been untouched by any kind of manmade structure. Once there Ezra must only eat fl owers for the duration. Ezra’s complete obedience to Uriel’s new and unusual set of instructions produces a powerful and transformative vision. Ezra suddenly sees a mother weeping for her son who died on his wedding night.49 Her grief has left her so distraught that she has abandoned Jerusalem and refused to return. Frustrated with her selfi sh mourning in light of Zion’s destruc-tion, Ezra briefl y forgets his own sense of hopelessness and turns to berate the woman harshly for her failure to recognize the overriding importance of Jerusa-lem. Th e brief interaction between Ezra and the mother inaugurates a concordant shift in Ezra’s own intractable lament for Jerusalem. Due to his willingness to speak the truth to the woman and criticize her selfi sh misery, Ezra is granted an incredible vision: in the middle of the fi eld of fl owers, the woman transforms sud-denly into a rebuilt, gorgeous city. Th e terrifi ed Ezra is then greeted by Uriel, who explains the visionary experience as God’s gift . Ezra’s ritual piety, his continual prayer for the “people of Sion” and for Jerusalem, has persuaded the Most High to reveal to him the future Holy City of Jerusalem, “the brilliance of her glory, and the loveliness of her beauty.”50 Aft er this visual experience, Uriel invites Ezra to return to Jerusalem and experience the destroyed and demolished city in a way no one else can:Th erefore do not be afraid and do not let your heart be terrifi ed; but go in and see the splendor and vastness of the building, as far as it is possible for your eyes to see it, and aft erward you will hear as much as your ears can hear. For you are more blessed than many, and you have been called before the Most High, as but few have been.51Now that Ezra’s view toward the misfortune of Jerusalem and her people has changed and his understanding coheres with that of God’s judgment, he is able to"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"130 Cyril and Jerusalemperceive things diff erently. Ezra no longer needs to engage in ritual preparations and prayer. He is no longer confused by the visions he has. Due to his complete alignment with the Most High, visionary experience is now an embedded, natural part of his being. Th rough dreams or visions, he can easily see and interpret what God eventually intends to restore on earth.In contrast to Ezra, most human beings are unenlightened and are consequently unable to see beyond the ruins of the destroyed city and Temple Mount: a heavy, blinding materiality darkens their vision, and they are cut off from full visual apprehension. Instead, their vision is confi ned to the present moment and con-strained by a linear progression of time. In striking contrast, Ezra’s sight has been released from linear time by his fi erce, unrelenting belief in an eternal, divine Jeru-salem and by his own practiced and tested ritual faith. He sees in full glory the holy Jerusalem that was, is, and will be. As he looks on “the splendor and vastness of the building, as far as it is possible,” Ezra realizes that what appears caught in present time does not matter in the least. It is transient, passing, and a fl icker of a moment.Vigilant ritual and visionary practice have enabled Ezra to increase his under-standing of God’s judgment and the purpose of suff ering. Th rough these means, Ezra has earned the faculty of apocalyptic sight, his now-natural ability to see a Jerusalem released from linear time. Ezra can now visually comprehend what lies behind the diaphanous veil of today’s ruin: the underlying, overlying, and sur-rounding solidity and permanence of Jerusalem’s eternal glory.Another important passage in this regard is 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) 14:21–26, in which Ezra requests from God that he receive the Holy Spirit in order to be able to rein-scribe the lost holy scriptures.52 What inspires Ezra’s request is the fact that “the world lies in darkness, and its inhabitants are without light.” God grants the request, and the following day Ezra receives the command, “Ezra, open your mouth and drink what I give you to drink.” Aft er following the command, Ezra exclaims: “[Immediately] my heart poured forth understanding, and wisdom increased in my breast, for my spirit retained its memory; and my mouth was opened and was no longer closed.”532 Baruch also broaches the issue of ritual practice and apocalyptic sight as well as the dangers of illusory aspects of Jerusalem.54 We encounter the protagonist’s vision of an unharmed, glorious, and inevitably eschatological Jewish temple in contrast with the earthly reality—a Jerusalem bloodied and bruised by the violent waves of history. As in the case of Ezra, it is Baruch’s unyielding piety in thought and ritual action that enables his full, honest, spiritual sight. Th e text opens in a very familiar manner, with the Lord explaining to Baruch that the temple of Jerusalem will be destroyed because of people’s sins. Baruch’s strong, insistent lament regarding their fate receives an intriguing response. Th e Lord explains that the Jerusalem before Baruch was not the city he had shown fi rst to Adam, then to Abraham, and fi nally to Moses: “It is not the building that is in your midst now; it is that which will be"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 131revealed, with me, that was already prepared from the moment that I decided to cre-ate Paradise. . . . Behold, now it [the temple] is preserved with me—as also Para-dise.”55 Th e text opens and extends the conversation to highlight a sacred, eschato-logical history, speaking of the beginning of time and then abruptly shift ing to the present day, as well as including a momentary leap forward into the imminent future; thus the text presents a doubled temporality. Th ere exists the true, divine sense of time, which remains hidden, protected, untainted and, in a sense, unchanging: in this timeline, the true Jerusalem/temple has been preserved and set aside since the time of Adam. All who truly deserve it can perceive it very briefl y. Th en there is an essen-tially duplicitous sense of time that is visible, touched by pain, destruction, corrup-tion, and decay. Very few are aware of the fi rst timeline—only those God considers worthy to experience the enduring holiness of the true Jerusalem and its temple. Everyone experiences the second, and thus a sense of change through the past, present and future. Occasionally the two experiences of time intersect.Baruch departs from the city, to fast and mourn. Th e Lord then proceeds to show Baruch and the reader what might be described as a multidimensional per-ception of the Holy City and its temple. By the following morning, attacking armies have surrounded Jerusalem and are ready to plunder the city; on the cusp of irrevocable catastrophe Baruch’s body is transported suddenly into an ecstatic visual experience of events:And lo! Suddenly a strong spirit raised me, and bore me aloft over the wall of Jerusa-lem. And I saw, and behold, there were standing four angels at the four corners of the city, each one of them with a burning torch in his hands. And another angel came down from heaven and said to them, “Hold your torches, and do not light them before I say it to you. Because I was sent fi rst to speak a word to the earth and then to deposit in it what the Lord, the Most High, has commanded me.” And I saw that he descended in the Holy of Holies and that he took from there the veil, the holy ephod, the mercy-seat, the two tables, the holy raiment of the priests, the altar of incense, the forty-eight precious stones, with which the priests were clothed, and all the holy ves-sels of the tabernacle. And he said to the earth with a loud voice:Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the mighty God,and receive the things which I commit to you,and guard them until the last times,so that you may restore them when you are ordered,so that strangers may not get possession of them.For the time has arrived when Jerusalem will also bedelivered for a time, until the moment that it will be saidthat it will be restored forever.And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up.56Ezra and Baruch are two texts that come together in ways that are incredibly help-ful as we turn below to discuss fourth-century Christians in their creation of a"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"132 Cyril and JerusalemHoly City of Jerusalem. Th ey will provide even more insight when we turn to Cyril in the next two chapters and consider his construction of baptizands as apocalyp-tic prophets whom he ties to Jerusalem in a form of visual sympatheia through daily exorcisms and baptism. For now, let us speculatively consider what 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch throw into the collective cultural atmosphere of the local Jerusalemite population.First and foremost, these texts strongly emphasize that what appears to the naked, unritualized eye is an illusion, an intentional deception. Furthermore, the destruction that fell on Jerusalem and its sacred monuments can only be false. It is incumbent on people to strive to become aware of the much larger, redemptive, enlightening conceptual framework that exists and encompasses the former. Th us both texts describe two notions of time and temporality: the fi rst is fl attened and confi nes a normal person’s experiential, perceptual state to the present moment; time for that person progresses continually and myopically in a strictly linear direction from the past to the future. A person in his or her natural state is incapa-ble of experiencing any other aspect of time than the present: an unaided human being can neither perceive a momentary image from an enduring event in the biblical past nor capture a precocious glimpse into the eschatological shape of the future. According to the second perception of temporality, however, this natural timeline adheres unimaginatively to the present. One’s experience of the sur-rounding world is therefore severely limited: such an individual is perceptually deadened to the other, enchanted, sense of time and place. Th e best example of these temporal dangers is provided in 2 Baruch.Baruch experiences the earth in its fully enlivened state. It is specifi cally his allegiance to Jerusalem and his status as a visionary that renders him capable of seeing what is invisible to everyone else: angels and an animate earth. By com-parison, others are visually restrained and capable of perceiving only illusions wrapped around the image of a fallen Jerusalem. Th e Babylonians see what they think are priceless spoils of war; in reality the holy vessels are vaporous. Th e true precious objects of the tabernacle are hidden safely underground until such time as earth and heaven mutually decide that it is safe for them to be returned to the surface. Th e Babylonians, Jerusalem’s enemy, see reality in a way that gives insight into their own true character. Th ey are capable of visually apprehending only the deceptive image of the treasure (the vessels of the temple); thus what they can see ironically refl ects what they are in their essence: lacking in real substance, illusory, and unsalvageable. By contrast, Baruch’s ability to see through the illusion of a destroyed temple and beyond to the enduring actuality of an untouched temple demonstrates the substance of his core as one of God’s most important visionaries.In this example from 2 Baruch we encounter the two diff erent dimensions of experiential reality. In the fi rst and more straightforward dimension a person is"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 133attached to, and confi ned within, the present moment as that moment continues to extend linearly in temporal progression. Th e second off ers a much more open-ended possibility, which demands more explanation: that a person can experience perceptual reality untethered from the unilinear progression of time. A person is then capable of inhabiting and perceiving all temporal dimensions—past, present, future—simultaneously, or of moving in a continual circularity. We will use the term mundane or disenchanted to describe the fi rst, limited mode of perception of the present within a linear, unidimensional experience of time—as we move from minute to minute, day to day, year to year. Th e second and more robust perception of reality and experience of time we will call supramundane or enchanted. To unpack this a bit further before moving on: a person experiencing mundane/disenchanted temporality perceives only the present moment (remembers the past, imagines the future) in a linear or sequential progression of time. Th at person also has only an individualized experience of reality and time. In other words, such an individual cannot experience time before their birth or aft er their death. By contrast, in the supramundane/enchanted model an Ezra or a Baruch experiences time multidimensionally: through ritual and angelic aid such a person develops the ability to perceive through the present into the past and the future.Th is conceptualization of supramundane/enchanted reality is especially intrigu-ing, and complex, when one considers supramundane/enchanted perception in conjunction with biblical exegesis. We move beyond merely perceiving an endur-ing past to perceiving, even participating in, a layering and interweaving of living biblical moments. We see an example of this understanding when we look at how Cyril trains his baptizands. In Catecheses ad illuminandos 13.9–12, he guides bapti-zands in the collection and performance of “testimonies to the Passion of Christ”: Christ is put in bonds, dragged to the high priest and questioned; his face is “smit-ten by lawless hands”; others spit upon his face; his back is scourged. Interwoven into this graphic and emotionally raw presentation of Christ’s arrest and crucifi x-ion Cyril presents vivid testimony from other doomed prophets whose own deaths support the crucifi xion. Isaiah speaks out against Christ’s tormenters—”Woe unto their soul” (Isa. 3:9, KJV)—before the prophet is cut asunder; Jeremiah is “cast into the mire of the cistern” (Jer. 38:6). Both prophets mix and blur with Christ, so that all three appear to bring salvation and redemption to people through their own suff ering and death. Cyril also lends his voice to Christ: “I gave My back to scourges and My cheeks to smitings; and My face I turned not away from the shame of spittings.”57All ends with the crucifi xion: Jesus’s death, like those of Isaiah and Jeremiah, brings a reversal and salvation to the people. Cyril urges his baptizands, “Look with awe then at the Lord who was judged.” Th e present imperative form here is not an accident. His baptizands should be able to see Jesus before them. Th rough the collection of testimonies, through Cyril’s performance of the testimonies, bap-"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"134 Cyril and Jerusalemtizands transform into living witnesses of living events—apocalyptic visionaries able to release and reveal these events.We see the same in 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch. In both texts, the goal of apokalypsis is tied to the intense preparation of ritual and the preservation of piety in the face of adversity: both Ezra and Baruch earn the ability to see through to deeper dimensional threads of time. In both apocalyptic texts the seer becomes part of the visual scene that he apprehends; in this manner he is transformed. In 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) Ezra becomes engrossed in a form of ritual asceticism that leads to his radical transformation. Similarly, in the act of seeing he merges with what he sees: the spectator becomes part of the spectacle. Ezra’s ability to interact deeply with his environment increases, exemplifi ed in the scene in which he yells at a mother/Jerusalem, which we discuss above. He becomes an actor and an agent, not only a distanced observer. He contributes fundamentally to cosmological change. Similarly, he does not merely see the temple but is allowed to descend among the ruins: “Go in and see the splendor and vastness of the buildings, as far as it is possible for your eyes to see it.”58 Th e seer transcends the distance between himself and the object of his sight—in this case the destroyed temple and Jerusalem—and in this way he becomes a participant in what he sees.In light of Cyril’s view of Constantine’s architectural interference in Aelia, one can easily imagine the benefi ts of being an apocalyptic seer/visionary. Th e power of spiritual perception, which both Ezra and Baruch gain, is an incredible asset in apprehending the true Holy City of Jerusalem. Th e emperor and many others have the fi nancial means to alter the physical appearance of the city in almost any man-ner they choose; by contrast Cyril does not have anything. In the beginning of his episcopacy, in fact, he and his church are utterly impoverished. How might he aff ect the appearance of his surrounding environment at all, especially if an outside for-eign power such as Constantine has already done so in such a dramatic manner? Cyril has to turn to a diff erent set of tools. Ezra and Baruch demonstrate the tre-mendous power inherent in apocalyptic sight—a mode of potency Cyril adopts and adapts to his baptismal ritual program. In their ability to see beyond the boundaries of the mundane or disenchanted sense of linear time, “apocalyptic seers” shake free from their visual fi eld sacred monuments such as the Holy Sepulchre and appre-hend the deeper reality. Th ey see beyond present destruction or neglect, for instance, to the forces of divine protection that inhabit a larger, invisible world. Th e possi-bilities are endless—as they need to be when facing the emperor’s handiwork.CONSTANTINIAN CONSTRUCTION IN AELIA CAPITOLINADuring the Council of Nicaea in 325, Macarius seeks permission from Constantine to begin a most unusual excavation in Aelia Capitolina. He wishes to tear down the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 135temple of Aphrodite in search of Christ’s tomb. Martin Biddle has suggested that Macarius fi rst draws Constantine’s attention to the Palestinian backwater as an initial maneuver in Aelia’s campaign for ecclesiastical recognition.59 Aelia Capi-tolina’s request aff ords the emperor a unique opportunity that eventually leads to the idea of a “Holy Land plan.”60 Before discussing Constantine’s plan, however, I want to take a closer look at this triumphant imperial ruler, who has only just attained that status with the defeat of Licinius at Chrysopolis in 324.Scholars have long maintained that Constantine views Christianity as a religion of victory, in terms of both military power and imperial prowess. From 306 to 324 Constantine enjoys eighteen years of undefeated military campaigns. Indeed, aft er the battle of the Milvian Bridge Constantine adopts Invictus as part of his offi cial title. In fact, Constantine’s religion is very traditional with regard to the military.61 As much as possible he seems to subsume his Christianity into a Roman theology of victory. Th at is to say, he understands his Christian identity as involving an iron grip over his army as the “chief instrument of his political will,” which is matched by the will of his God on the battlefi eld.62 He proves the strength of this alliance yet again on September 18, 324, at the battle of Chrysopolis, where he defeats Licinius and brings a decisive end to the persecution of Christians.Th e same year he founds his victory city, Constantinople, which is offi cially dedicated in 330. Th e new capital off ers a lavish display of Constantine’s military, political, and imperial power. In the center of the city, the Hippodrome features statuary and ancient artwork from throughout the empire; likewise, various relics are translated to the Church of the Holy Apostles and its attached mausoleum, both built by Constantine. Constantinople becomes a beautiful showcase for the emperor as Invictus; he deliberately founds and constructs the city as a nikopolis for a new Christian age.63Constantine then turns to Aelia to cultivate his image of imperial Christian triumph. As we consider Constantine’s plan for Aelia, some questions arise. To what degree does he impose his ideas of military theology and imperial triumph on Aelia? And to what degree does the so-called Holy Land (as well as those who live in it) determine his plan? Annabel Wharton proposes an intriguing notion; she suggests that Constantine automatically turns to the forum, following a pat-tern he has established in Rome, in which he lays claim to a city center by attaching his name to the major monuments that his predecessors have built.64 Th us in Jeru-salem Constantine naturally goes to the temple of Aphrodite, which is located at the city center in Hadrian’s forum across from the Temple Mount. Th e entire north corner of the forum is appropriated for a monumental statement on the part of the emperor, referred to in the earliest sources, Wharton notes, as the Basilica of Con-stantine. Perhaps, Wharton comments skeptically, it is during the preparatory stages of construction that a tomb is fortuitously unearthed, and a narrative of discovery rapidly unleashed.65"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"136 Cyril and JerusalemTh e inhabitants of Byzantium and Aelia assuredly draw parallels between their situations: fresh from his victory over Licinius, Constantine turns to the task of remaking both cities. Sarah Bassett makes the important distinction that while religious concerns infl uence Constantine’s “manipulation of [the] site and plan to create” Constantinople, religious allegiance does not. Bassett claims that “a truth far more compelling, that of unrivaled imperial rule,” dominates the topographical plans for the city.66 Undoubtedly a percentage of those living in Aelia feel increas-ing concern as they watch Constantine’s ultimate intentions unfold and his plans for construction materialize, and, moreover, materialize in a very diff erent way than they themselves would have planned in their own Holy City.As Aelia evolves through its murky transformation from Roman colony to larger urban sphere, some devout Christians probably express concerns. Many would look toward the new imperial capital to the north with fear and ask whether Constantine was establishing a new “Holy Land,” another nikopolis, on top of Aelia. Constantine brings Greco-Roman treasure to the Hippodrome and relics into the churches to adorn his imperial victory city and honor all the battles he has won. Th e emperor recently fi nished Constantinople in this way, projecting powerful images of Christ and himself united in victory over paganism and anti-Christian persecution. What might he bring to his basilica on Golgotha, then, to make a similar statement regarding his power and authority? How might people in Aelia react as Constantine’s militant triumphal theologies are transferred from Constantinople to their city? Can we imagine Christians reacting negatively to Constantine’s building projects? Might some view such projects as blasphemous innovations marring the Holy Land? And if some do view the Constantine basilica in this manner, what tools do they have to express that view?Before attempting to answer these questions, let’s take a closer look at Aelia through Constantine’s eyes. Like the emperors before him, Constantine employs traditional methods of imperial euergetism. Th e spectacle of monuments—especially in the focus on urban infrastructure (baths, temples, hippodromes, aqueducts) as well as imperial cult—is tremendously powerful. By concentrating on ecclesiastical construction, as Richard Krautheimer noted long ago, Constan-tine is working out a new calculus of imperial benefaction and propaganda.67He takes easily to the role of demiurge of a new age in which he controls the architectural patterning of Christian imperium.68 In the frenzy of church con-struction, the basilica rises from a common public building type in Roman archi-tecture to the rank of a powerful visible monument advancing Constantine’s scheme of empire and Christianity. Th e basilica has a long history in imperial propaganda; it off ers benefi ts to the public on a grand scale. In so doing, it pro-motes the emperor’s greatness and authority. Under Constantine’s guidance, according to Krautheimer, this type of building becomes a powerful symbol “expressive of the grandeur of the imperial founder and of the triumph of the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 137religion he had taken under his protection.”69 Th e building projects carried out by Constantine throughout the empire are a potent medium of imperial encomium in brick, mortar, and gold; precious jewels spectacularly laud the emperor and his patronage of Christianity.70 And we ought to consider what this must look like to local populations. Christianity is a religion that has not yet found expression in grand monumentality. Under Constantine’s patronage, it emerges to seize com-manding territory in cities throughout the empire: the Lateran in Rome, the Great Church in Antioch, Hagia Sophia and the Eirene Church, in addition to the Church of the Holy Apostles, in Constantinople, for example. In readjusting the conventional modes of patronage available to him, Constantine imperializes as well as publicizes ecclesiastical Christianity.Indeed, the basilica that emerges aft er the fall of the temple of Aphrodite is an edifi ce of lavish imperial patronage. Its rise heralds a radical transformation of sacred space in the city that will reverberate throughout the empire and is conso-nant with Constantine’s churches in Rome, Constantinople, and other cities. Yet, as Wharton has pointed out, “at the same time that it confi rmed the presence of Rome and Constantine’s imperial authority,” it was a “complex . . . planned to serve as the principal congregational and administrative center of the Christian community of Jerusalem.”71 Capacious cisterns and baptismal baths indicate that it is intended to serve large baptismal communities, and thus the central Jerusalemite community, and to provide episcopal administration, as we see in the Lateran in Rome, for example. But the church is also distinct from Con-stantinian monuments elsewhere. Constantine’s basilica—the Holy Sepulchre or Martyrium—comes to be a site of localized divinity; more precisely, it becomes a church of pilgrimage. Th us the Martyrium anchors the three other churches built by Constantine that fan out into the so-called periphery of Jerusalem, and that also broadcast prominent scriptural moments. Th ese include the church at the Oak of Mamre, the rumored site where Abraham met the angels, and also two cave churches, the Bethlehem Church of the Nativity and the Mount of Olives church.Th e Holy Sepulchre is constructed on a basilica plan contorted into a rather idiosyncratic shape in order to encompass the holy sites of Christ’s passion. I will not venture into the tangled debates regarding the discovery of Christ’s tomb; it suffi ces here to say that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a place of worship, a fully functioning cathedral church with baptismal font. Since the Holy Sepulchre sits atop the site of what had once been a prominent Hadrianic temple, its very construction comes to embody the demonic/divine, pagan/Christian opposition that Constantine wishes to emphasize as his imperial triumph. Th e signifi cance of the basilica’s location and its associations should not be overlooked. As Yoram Tsafrir has noted, the construction of a church directly on top of temple ruins is practically unheard of in this early period of Christian imperium:"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"138 Cyril and JerusalemWorshippers were aware of the demonic powers or the curse of the impure site where the shrine of the demon had once stood. In most cases Christians refrained from building churches directly on top of a pagan shrine . . . unless a solemn purifi cation ceremony was carried out. Only at a later date, at the end of the fi ft h or early sixth century, did Christians acquire enough self-confi dence to build on top of temple ruins.72As already discussed above, Eusebius captures the signifi cance of this project in his description of the temple’s demolition and the discovery of Christ’s tomb. Euse-bius gives the impression that Constantine is actually in Jerusalem at the time—that he is hierophantically guided in his oversight of every step of this project until the resurrection can be recovered in a sudden fl ash of light aft er three centuries:Possessed therefore by the divine Spirit [Constantine] did not negligently allow that place which has been described to remain smothered by all sorts of fi lthy rubbish through the machination of enemies consigned to oblivion and ignorance, nor did he yield to the malice of the guilty; but calling upon God to be his collaborator, he ordered [the temple] to be cleared, thinking that the very space that enemies sullied should especially benefi t from the great work being done through him by the All-good. At a word of command those contrivances of fraud were demolished from top to bottom, and the houses of error were dismantled and destroyed along with their idols and demons. His eff orts, however, did not stop there, but the Emperor gave further orders that all the rubble of stones and timbers from the demolitions should be taken and dumped a long way from the site. . . . Under divine inspiration once more the Emperor gave instructions that the site should be excavated to a great depth and the pavement should be carried away with the rubble a long distance outside, because it was stained with demonic bloodshed. . . . At last against all expectation the revered and all-hallowed Testimony of the Savior’s resurrection was itself revealed, and the cave, the holy of holies, took on the appearance of a representation of the Savior’s return to life. Th us aft er its descent into darkness it came forth again to the light.73In Eusebius’s portrayal of this imagined event, Aphrodite’s temple transforms into a demon-infested and blood-soaked monstrosity; it metamorphoses into an animate entity. Aft er so many infernal, sacrifi cial rituals in the temple, according to the Caesarean bishop, all contaminated rubble—anything touched by sacrifi ced blood—has to be completely expelled from the city. “Divine inspiration” directs Constantine regarding all aspects involving demonic contamination, providing rules and even dimensions for cleansing the site. How deep do they have to dig before workers reach beneath the level of dirt soaked with demonic blood? How far beyond the temple and into the forum do they have to break up the pavement before they fi nally stand on clean ground?In his careful attention to every detail of the construction, Constantine works to fuse his identity with that of Christ in the basilica. Th e theological keystone of"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 139the entire complex is the glory of the resurrection. Th e focus of Constantine’s building plan is inescapably the tomb; as Eusebius tells us, the Anastasis rises majestically above Christ’s tomb to visually dominate the courtyard of the church complex.74 Th us, by making certain architectural choices the emperor is situated as the demiurge of the new Christian empire, working harmoniously with the demi-urge of the entire universe. Eusebius helps confi rm this image in the Vita Constan-tini by weaving Constantine and Christ together seamlessly in images of rescue, power, and victory. Th e stunning monument provides iconographic insurance for the fusion of Constantine’s imperial triumphs with the glory of Christ’s resurrection.Within the actual site of the basilica complex, pilgrims are guided visually and physically to the tomb itself, or more properly to the ornate building engulfi ng the site of the resurrection.75 Th e Holy Sepulchre has been physically altered, cut away from the living rock surrounding it. A series of twelve columns encircles it, further distancing it from its natural landscape. Th ese are topped by twelve bowls. Impor-tantly, a similar stylistic detail exists in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Con-stantinople, linking Constantine’s inevitable resting place with the one Christ graced with his divine presence for just a few days before his resurrection—a bold iconographic and theological statement by a bold new Christian emperor. By the time of Cyril’s lectures, a rotunda encases the whole of the tomb, which would have certainly drawn greater attention to the Anastasis in the courtyard. Constan-tine is quite determined to spare no expense with the decoration of the tomb; this rich description testifi es to the centrality of the resurrection in the emperor’s view:Th is then [the tomb] was the fi rst thing, like a head of the whole, which the Emper-or’s munifi cence decorated with superb columns and full ornamentation, brighten-ing the solemn cave with all kinds of artwork. He then went on to a very large space wide open to the fresh air, which was decorated with a pavement of light-colored stone on the ground, and enclosed on three sides by long surrounding colonnades. On the side opposite the cave, which looked toward the rising sun, was connected the royal temple, an extraordinary structure raised to an immense height and very extensive in length and breadth. Its interior was covered with slabs of varied marble, and the external aspect of the walls, gleaming with hewn stone fi tted closely together at each joint, produced a supreme object of beauty by no means inferior to marble. Right up at the top the material which encased the outside of the roofs was lead, a sure protection against stormy rain; while the interior of the structure was fi tted with carved coff ers and like a vast sea spread out by a series of joints binding to each other through the whole royal house, and being beautifi ed throughout with brilliant gold made the whole shrine glitter with beams of light. Round each of the sides extended twin ranges of double colonnades, in upper and lower stories, their tops also deco-rated with gold. Th ose at the front of the house rested upon huge pillars, while those inside the front were raised under blocks plentifully decorated all round their sur-faces. Th ree doors well placed to face the sunrise received the crowds fl owing in."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"140 Cyril and JerusalemFacing these as the chief point of the whole was the hemisphere attached to the high-est part of the royal house, ringed with twelve columns to match the number of the Apostles of the Saviour, their tops decorated with great bowls made of silver, which the Emperor himself had presented to his God as a superb off ering.Th is then was the shrine which the Emperor raised as manifest testimony of the Savior’s resurrection, embellishing the whole with rich imperial decoration. He adorned it with untold beauties in innumerable dedications of gold and silver and precious stones set in various materials. In view of their size, number and variety, to describe in detail the skilled craft smanship which went into their manufacture would be beyond the scope of this present work.76Th e Anastasis as well as the adjoining courtyard and basilica are famous in their time for their stunning ornamentation. Ornamentation is oft en perceived as a mark of the sacred; and the sparkling and variegated colors draw and hold the spectator’s gaze.77 Such a gift from nobility or royalty frequently elicits equally dazzling praise.In preserved imperial letters we can see how Constantine is striving to fuse his identity with the remnants of Jesus’s physical presence on earth, as well as to inject much-needed wealth into the city. He mandates a large-scale construction project that will occupy the clergy, the provincial government, and craft smen for several years. Eusebius preserves a letter that Constantine sends to Macarius detailing his plans for the church’s construction, in which he orders Macarius’s collaboration with the provincial governor, Dracillianus.78 While Dracillianus provides the fund-ing, the bishop is charged with overseeing the building of a basilica that will be “not only superior to those in all other places, but the other arrangements also may be such that the excellences of every city are surpassed by this foundation.”79 Con-stantine requests that Macarius compile lists regarding materials and supplies, which he is then to dispatch as quickly as possible to the necessary magistrates. Th e emperor covers every detail from expenditures for marble to the required number of laborers and craft smen. With the aid of his clerical staff , Macarius has to decide what type of marble to use for the columns and whether or not to coff er the ceiling of the basilica, as well as what type of lacunary panels should be installed. Most importantly, Macarius is to report every choice to the emperor immediately.Th e result is that the basilica in toto heralds an architectural transformation in religious monuments that will come to encompass the entire empire. While the tomb holds pride of place in the architectural layout, in startling contrast Golgotha is situated in a corner of the courtyard and is starkly unadorned. How long the site of the crucifi xion remains this way is diffi cult to say. We do not know of any spe-cifi c change to the importance of the crucifi xion until we hear from Cyril of Jeru-salem a generation later, who mentions images of Jerusalem, its churches, and tokens of the “true cross” that have spread throughout the Mediterranean world."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 141Th is most certainly encourages the steady stream of pilgrims who travel to the emerging Christian city throughout the fourth century: people grow increasingly more eager to experience the Holy Land and the power of the cross.80 Also, Egeria’s pilgrimage in the 380s and her description of the Easter festivities off er us decided confi rmation of the later importance of Golgotha.However, the 320s are a world apart from the 380s; in the earlier period the imperial family pours a large amount of resources into changing the image of the city. Soon aft er Constantine’s construction begins, in fact, another member of the imperial household also begins to invest in Christianizing Aelia. In the autumn of 326 CE Constantine’s mother, Helena, begins her “imperial progress” to the Holy Land. Her presence deepens the perception of Constantinian benefaction in Aelia and Palestine. Only a short time aft er the discovery of Christ’s tomb and dur-ing the early stages of the Holy Sepulchre’s construction, Helena arrives, bringing with her a large imperial retinue. Palestine, which was condemned to insignifi -cance by Hadrian, is reinvigorated during these months. As Kenneth Holum has observed, the several cities throughout the East that Helena visits surely receive her with an adventus ceremony; Helena no doubt responds in turn by off ering cash gift s to the citizenry and donatives to the troops, as well as listening to petitions and manumitting slaves.81 Holum has discussed the signifi cance of these ritualized interactions; each serves to strengthen as well as Christianize civic/imperial rela-tions. Th e choreographed performances also announce throughout the Eastern cities the strong imperial interest in the welfare and promotion of the Holy Land. When Helena’s journey fi nally brings her to Aelia, she emulates her son’s ecclesias-tical patronage. She dedicates a church in Bethlehem in the reputed cave of the nativity and on the Mount of Olives at the site of Christ’s ascension.In 335, the dedication of Constantine’s basilica, the Martyrium, marks the fi rst Encaenia festival, which opens with liturgical rites inaugurating and consecrating the church space.82 As the Encaenia evolves into a week-long annual event, it comes to include processions, exorcisms, and anointings as well as large feasts and other festivities. Debate continues regarding the actual dates for the festival; for the most part, people have considered the festival’s potential symbolic meaning when trying to discern a specifi c answer. Th e Encaenia honors the building built for Christ, of course, but it also showcases the power and authority of its imperial patron, Constantine. Th e Chronicon Paschale gives September 17 as the inaugura-tion day for the basilica, but Michael A. Fraser makes a compelling argument for September 13, particularly in light of our own view of Constantine’s intention to fuse the basilica with his imperial glory.83 Th e dates of September 13–18 coincide with the anniversary of Constantine’s defeat of Licinius (324) as well as with the dedication of the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline hill in Rome, which Constantine has built to honor the god for the victory over Licin-ius.84 Th e dates are also associated with the “Saving Sign” which led to the erection"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"142 Cyril and Jerusalemof the basilica in Jerusalem and its dedication to the Christian God.85 Finally, the dates in September are auspicious for the Encaenia because they aff ord Constan-tine (and the Jerusalemite church) an opportunity to be distracted from the festi-vals associated with the Jewish temple (the dedication of Solomon’s temple, Yom Kippur, and the Feast of the Tabernacles).Th rough the eff orts of Constantine and Helena, Aelia Capitolina continues to give way to a Christianized Jerusalem. Th e Holy City is emerging from the ground beneath Greek temples. Newly constructed churches are fi lled with clergy who take tremendous pride in Christ’s city, with pilgrims who want to see through the Roman crust to the Holy City underneath, and with its own Christian inhabitants, who are seeking baptism in the place of Christ’s death and rebirth. With so much transformation in such a relatively short time, what kind of Jerusalem is emerging? Constantine and Constantinian imperial ideology are eff ective, or certainly expe-dient, in marking the land as it emerges from underneath a splintering Hadrianic surface. While many welcome and celebrate Constantine’s Holy City of Jerusalem, it is probable that more than a few do not. What dissenting voices can we hear critiquing Constantine’s directions for the Holy City of Jerusalem? What do we know about the Christians, and other groups, who are residing in Aelia when Con-stantine begins construction on the Roman forum? How do they react to his plans for the city? Th ese questions need to be asked, because, I propose, the community’s reaction to Constantine’s plans will inevitably inform Cyril’s more radical diaboli-zation of religious space in Jerusalem.THE BORDEAUX PILGRIM: EDITING MONUMENTALITYIn recent years scholars have taken a close look at the Bordeaux Pilgrim to uncover more of what Oded Irshai has characterized as the “unique religious and cultural transformation that is the Christianization of Jerusalem and of the Holy Land.”86 Attention to this text written in 333 CE has disclosed how pilgrimage and travel discourse begin to shape and enliven the sacred monuments and landscape only eight years aft er the miraculous discovery of Christ’s tomb. Th us scholars have pointed to the anonymous Pilgrim as evidence that we must acknowledge a much earlier date for the beginning of diverse Christianizing processes in Aelia. We will develop this supposition further and propose that this text demonstrates Chris-tians in dialogue, if not confl ict, with imperial and ecclesiastical directions for Aelia’s transformation. Th e text represents an early voice of dissent against Con-stantine’s choices in his eff orts to Christianize the Holy Land, and yet scholars have overlooked the Pilgrim’s criticisms. Th us it is important to consider the particular character of the anonymous Pilgrim’s view of Jerusalem. First, as both Andrew S. Jacobs and Oded Irshai have correctly shown, the Pilgrim is writing from a strong"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 143anti-Judaizing perspective.87 Second, as Glenn Bowman has discussed, his is an apocalyptic, eschatological view steeped in biblical imagery and thus, I would add, apprehensive about any nonbiblical additions to the Holy Land.88 Th us the text also serves as a subtle Kaiserkritik: the anonymous Pilgrim rejects the Constantin-ian plan for Jerusalem, disapproving of the manner in which the imperial churches—and especially the Holy Sepulchre—dominate the landscape.Th e Pilgrim’s early eff orts have beckoned some scholars to a diff erent kind of interpretation as of late: those attuned to the linguistic turn in late antiquity, who have recognized the deeply theological and ideological nature of the text. I will review some of this recent scholarship, especially Irshai’s important work, which has greatly infl uenced my own. Following Jacobs’s lead, Irshai notes the Pilgrim’s strong anti-Judaizing presentation of the Temple Mount in particular.89 While I treat Jacobs’s and Irshai’s work at length, I draw out those elements in the Pilgrim’s experience and in their interpretation of his text that advance my overriding point regarding the animating effi cacy of the Pilgrim’s ritualizing relation to Jerusalem: the Pilgrim perceives the monuments in Jerusalem and expresses that perception in words that enliven the sacrality and a specifi c divine history of chosen buildings and spaces in Jerusalem. Ultimately these stand in collective representation of the Pilgrim’s view of the Holy Land in contrast to other views of Jerusalem, including Constantine’s own. Here especially we see how the Pilgrim’s anti-Judaizing mixes with his antidemonizing rhetoric to mark explicitly and strategically where, when, and how his version of Christ expresses power in Jerusalem. In this way the Pil-grim manages to relocate holy power in Jerusalem, ultimately bringing the Temple Mount and areas surrounding it into direct tension with the Holy Sepulchre. Close attendance to the words of the anonymous Pilgrim reveals the shape of his battle for possession of the Holy City: it is a struggle between imperial and local, build-ing (money) and body (perception and practice). In other words, the Bordeaux Pilgrim illuminates the the transformative power inherent in the body: that is, how an individual person’s acts of seeing, hearing, touching, reading, and, most especially, writing about an urban environment can dramatically aff ect how others perceive the same environment.In her treatment of the Holy Land, Blake Leyerle recognizes the Pilgrim’s delib-erate shift : “the uniqueness of the landscape described by the anonymous pilgrim, pointing out the lack of any mention of humans or fauna and fl ora or descriptive elements of the sites—all in the service of the predetermined focus on the theo-logical veneration and interaction with the past enshrined in the architecture.”90 Bowman also addresses the Bordeaux Pilgrim’s eff orts to carve the Holy Land out of the surrounding landscape; thus he foreshadows Egeria’s ability to create a dis-cursive environment where “scripture begins to dissolve into site.”91 Most impor-tantly, Bowman focuses on the Pilgrim’s eschatological tendencies in his construc-tion of Jerusalem’s appearance. And here Bowman’s comments regarding the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"144 Cyril and JerusalemPilgrim’s desires for those seeking baptism are especially telling, as Bowman remarks that “the text, rather than seeking to direct pilgrims to the holy places of the Roman Empire, works to lead catechumens to gateways which open onto a kingdom not of this world.”92 Th e Pilgrim’s eschatology predates the much more straightforward end-of-days imagery in Cyril’s baptismal lectures.Jacobs and Irshai have properly situated the Bordeaux Pilgrim in the genre of Adversus Judaeos literature. Th us their work is extremely important in establishing a very early date for the development of anti-Judaizing trends in Christianizing rhetoric in Jerusalem. Th is is of particular importance when one considers actual violence against Jews at a later date, especially in the aft ermath of Julian’s failed attempt to build the temple in 363. Jacobs treats the Bordeaux Pilgrim in a much broader study of Christian literature, which positions “the Jew as the colonial sub-altern in the various formulations of imperial Christian identity in the Holy Land in late antiquity.”93 He well confi gures the Jews as the “dominated object of fear, mistrust, envy, . . . a constant shadowy presence necessarily attached to the Chris-tian Self in the discourse of Holy Land geography.”94 For the anonymous Pilgrim, the Jew is Solomon always playing second to a victorious, supercessionist Christ on the Temple Mount. As shameful as Solomon appears next to the triumphant Christ, he is in a sense a necessary historiographic pedestal for Christ, so that Christianity might attain the heights of a divine and deserved inheritance of the Holy Land.Advancing the interpretive insights of Jacobs’s approach, Irshai locates the Bor-deaux Pilgrim’s account fi rmly in the “local Jerusalemite Adversus Judaeos atmos-phere.”95 In tracing the Pilgrim’s close treatment of Jewish sites, Irshai sharply and convincingly argues that it has undeniable supercessionist overtones in creating a mental map that appropriates Jewish biblical history for a Christian Holy Land in the present and future, and in the process completely discounts the two-hundred-year Hadrianic period altogether. According to Irshai, “Th e inherent message of the fi nal product is an image of the predestined plan to create a Christian Jerusa-lem.”96 He fi nds the Bordeaux Pilgrim’s text an inherently polemical enterprise, because it “necessitates the dispossession of the holy city’s space from the hands of its previous occupiers, the Jews, in the course of which the Aelia Capitolina phase is nearly entirely obliterated from memory.”97 Irshai uses the term “appropriation-ist hermeneutic,” or “mechanism of appropriation and dispossession of space and meaning,” to describe the Pilgrim’s strategy of Christianizing the Temple Mount.98In this architectural rubble, which is actually Herodian, the Bordeaux Pilgrim traces the deeds of Solomon, over which the superior acts of Christ cast a chilling shadow. Th e Pilgrim describes a vault near the Temple Mount base as a location where “Solomon used to torture demons.”99 Th e Pilgrim explains that next to the vault there was a “corner of a very loft y tower, which was where the Lord climbed and said to the Tempter, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God, but you will only"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 145serve him.’ ”100 Besides referring to familiar biblical passages (Matt. 4:7, 10; Luke 4:12, 8), this, of course, is a reference to the Testament of Solomon tradition in which Solomon has the power over demons to build the tower, a power that paral-lels Christ’s exorcist powers. Irshai elaborates the comparison: Solomon is second to Christ as earth is second to heaven, defeating demons is second to defeating the devil, and so forth. Solomon is below, while Christ hovers above; Solomon is silent, while Christ speaks; Solomon fi ghts demons, while Christ takes on the devil him-self. As Irshai phrases it, “In this model, Christ relegates the type, namely, Solo-mon, to a mere shadow.”101 Th is is not to repudiate or deny the power of Solomon, however, but to absorb it into Christ’s genealogy, a biblical and antidemonic inher-itance. Irshai draws the reader’s attention to several instances in which the Bor-deaux Pilgrim deliberately incorporates aspects of sacred biblical literature and Holy Land topography into a linear historiography that can only serve to fore-shadow the inevitability of Christ’s appearance and his lingering tangibility in that land. As I discuss below, the Pilgrim’s text fi rmly locates Christ’s power on and near the Temple Mount. Here is the location where Christ speaks: the only place in the text, in fact, where the Pilgrim has Christ speak, and it is to the devil himself. Th is is particularly noteworthy when one considers the resurrection’s eventual lit-eral rise in Constantinian glory with the Anastasis. But rather than showcase the triumphal moments of Christ’s resurrection in Jerusalem, the Bordeaux Pilgrim places him fi rmly near the Temple Mount, laying claim to his biblical inheritance and Solomonic genealogy.Once the Pilgrim leaves the Temple Mount, he manufactures a tightly control-led tour of the Holy City, which moves rapidly from Mount Sion to Golgotha to the Mount of Olives. Let us not forget, too, what the Bordeaux Pilgrim deliberately, but unsuccessfully, omits. Once again, I follow Irshai’s lead, who notes the “the silences, the omissions” in the text and “a mechanism of a deliberately, not to say deceptively, selective presentation.”102 Irshai refers to the Pilgrim’s preference for past Solomonic glory over the grim reality of the Herodian rubble that actually covers the Temple Mount. In fact, the Pilgrim juxtaposes two of the city’s domi-nant religious monuments—the Temple Mount and the Church of the Holy Sepul-chre; he augments the tension between them by contrasting how they are histori-cally perceived: the Temple Mount with its ancient genealogy and biblical history versus the Holy Sepulchre with its air of invention and fraudulent, aberrant inter-vention. We should pay attention not only to what the Pilgrim wrote but also to how much he wrote about the Temple Mount in comparison to the Holy Sepul-chre: he was incredibly eff usive on this topic, in contrast to his otherwise terse descriptions:And in the sanctuary itself, where the temple stood, which Solomon built, there is marble in front of the altar, which has on it the blood of Zacharias—you would think"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"146 Cyril and Jerusalemit had only been shed today. All around you can see the marks of the hobnails of the soldiers who killed him, as plainly as if they had been pressed into wax. Two statues of Hadrian stand there, and not far from them, a pierced stone which the Jews come and anoint each year. Th ey mourn and rend their garments, and then depart.103Th e Temple Mount is a desolate, foreboding, and barren space. Imperial statu-ary and the remains of demolished Jewish buildings stand alone, testifying day aft er day to the power and domination of the Roman Empire. Despite the physical reality of the space, the Pilgrim chooses to fi ll the site with life and activity of a particular kind—he revives a pivotal moment in the pre-exilic period. By the sim-ple phrase “in the sanctuary itself ” he invites those reading his text to see the First Temple whole once more and then to bear witness to the execution of Zacharias, who was stoned to death by order of King Joash for publicly rebuking the king and his people for their growing corruption.Th e Pilgrim’s muted references to the Constantinian churches stand in stark contrast to his depiction of the Temple Mount. He mentions four churches: the Holy Sepulchre, the Eleona church on the Mount of Olives, the church of Bethle-hem, and fi nally the church at Mamre, also known as Terebinth. To grasp their strangeness in this text, we need to return to the topic of the text’s date. Th e Pil-grim’s visit to Jerusalem takes place less than a decade aft er Constantine orders the temple of Aphrodite razed and the construction of his grand basilica honoring Christ has begun shift ing the economic, socioreligious, and cultural balance of the city. Th e date of the Pilgrim’s account is two years shy of a festival honoring the great church, which will draw bishops from surrounding areas and launch the Encaenia. Jerusalem has been utterly overturned by Constantinian construction. It is no doubt impossible at the time of the Pilgrim’s visit to fi nd anyone whose life is not aff ected by the building project. Th e city is awash with others like himself, as well as those seeking work or food. Stories of tragedies and miracles associated with the building and the site it occupies surely are in constant circulation.It is diffi cult to omit a religious site like the Holy Sepulchre from a travelogue with an ideological message, especially for someone wishing to advance Chris-tianization soon aft er the end of Christian persecution in the Holy Land. And yet it seems that the Pilgrim does what he can to downplay the construction of the emperor’s church: “By order of emperor Constantine there has now been built there a ‘basilica’ ”104 Th is is no ordinary building, and yet the Pilgrim off ers nothing but the most ordinary comments. He has nothing complimentary to say about the building, although he comments on the “cisterns of remarkable beauty” that stand nearby and mentions a bath for baptizing children. Th at the Pilgrim compliments the beauty of the cisterns near the Holy Sepulchre, rather than the basilica itself, seems deliberate. Indeed, he mentions the “exceptionally beautiful basilica” several miles away in Terebinth, near Hebron, where Abraham spoke and ate with angels"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Jerusalem to Aelia, Aelia to Jerusalem 147under a tree.105 Th e Pilgrim seems to intentionally deny Constantine’s Holy Sepul-chre the benefi t of any compliment whatsoever. Th us what he does off er is telling.Th e Pilgrim indicates that all the Constantinian basilicas, including the Holy Sepulchre, have been “built by command of Constantine.”106 Th is rhetorical gesture functions to erase the imperial edifi ce from the Pilgrim’s biblicized landscape rather than to memorialize it. Th e rhetorical refrain appears identically four times, for each of the four churches that Constantine built, including the Holy Sepulchre, fi rmly establishing these buildings as part of the present timeline, cutting the Con-stantinian monument off from the timeless sacrality of the biblical landscape itself. In his clipped style, the Pilgrim attempts to demolish Constantine’s Holy Land plan, removing it from his own historiographic vision of Jerusalem and the sur-rounding environment. With a few brief words, placed precisely in the recent past, the Pilgrim excises these gaudy monstrosities from an ancient and yet eternal land-scape, and the land heals itself as the threads of the Pilgrim’s narrative span the rift left by the imperial aberration and are easily woven into the reader’s imagination.Th e Bordeaux Pilgrim places the Temple Mount in an animated temporality that moves perpetually from one temporal current to another with each image. By con-trast, he chokes the time and drains the animation from the unfi nished Constantin-ian structure, trapping it in a foreshortened moment. Th e imperial basilica sits incomplete in his text, overshadowed by the beautiful cisterns nearby. As we will see, Cyril engages in the same temporal strategies in his descriptions of the Holy Sepulchre, Temple Mount, and Jewish temple. Cyril, however, incorporates demon-ology to strike a clear divide between the visibility of Aelia Capitolina, trapped in the present, and the seemingly invisible Holy City of Jerusalem, enduring through all ages.Jerusalem has been the object of foreign imperial interest at many points through-out its long history. Th e majority of those leaders came with the goal of altering—in many cases, destroying—the entire physical topography of the city. Th e monu-mental changes Jerusalem has experienced have rarely, if ever, been carried out with the permission of the city’s inhabitants. Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, and Hadrian, for example, conquer the city with extreme displays of violence. Although Jerusa-lem possesses religious meaning and value that exist entirely apart from its role in history, a central core of its identity as the Holy City of Jerusalem in fact attains its shape within the almost predictable cycle of violence and destruction at the hands of foreign opposition.Th is leaves us with many questions. How do Constantine’s churches and other buildings aff ect the everyday lives of local Christians, Jews, and Greeks? Are all Christians appreciative of Constantine’s exorbitant displays of imperial patronage?

How do his new buildings reorganize or reorder the manner in which diff erent religious groups in Aelia interact with and understand one another? What tools do people of the time pos-sess or develop to reclaim the city in their own terms?We face the challenge of answering these and many other questions. Fortu-nately, Cyril’s catechetical lectures provide tremendous insight. His writings express a certain level of disdain when he describes Constantine’s basilica and how it has altered the material appearance of the land. In fact, in his many descriptions of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site of the resurrection and the crucifi x-ion, Cyril suggests that the emperor’s basilica hinders a person’s perception of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Embedded deeply in the local and locally shared tradition of apocalyptic sight, however, the young bishop develops a baptismal ritual pro-gram that serves to endow baptizands with the power of spiritual perception. By receiving baptism in Jerusalem, one can lay claim to the Holy City, and so too to ultimate salvation."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"149In the spring of 350, baptismal candidates gather regularly in Constantine’s basilica in Jerusalem—an imposing and spectacular monument that glorifi es Christ’s res-urrection. As these men and women prepare in the church for baptism during the weeks of Lent, they are enveloped by the riches of an imperial patronage that fuses Christ’s victory inextricably with that of Constantine.1 In these surroundings, they listen to the words of their bishop, Cyril.2 Slowly and steadily, very diff erent images begin to form in their minds. Th e gleam of precious metals, jewels, and marble starts to fade as Cyril guides the baptizands’ eye to apprehend vivid fl ashes of the torture and humiliation Jesus suff ered before his crucifi xion on the cross; he weaves vivid imagery from the book of Isaiah into elements of the Passion:Th ey tied up Jesus and brought Him into the hall of the high priest. Will you know and see that this has been written also? Isaiah says: “Woe to their souls, because they have taken evil counsel against themselves, saying: ‘Let us bind the just one, because he is a diffi cult individual for us’ ” [Isa.50:6]. . . . But the high priest angrily questions [Jesus] and aft er hearing the truth, the wicked servant of wicked men slaps [Jesus] in the face; and that face, which had shone as the sun, suff ered through the strike by lawless hands.

He lacks the imperial treasury of Constan-tine and Helena, who have commissioned impressive building projects in and just beyond the city. Unlike Jerome, Cyril cannot turn to the patronage of wealthy Roman matrons to implement his ideas regarding Jerusalem’s image. Even if he had the funds, the young bishop does not enjoy suffi cient ecclesiastical autonomy to cross the bishop of Caesarea, Acacius, without serious consequences; moreover, he will be forced to leave his see for exile three times on Acacius’s order, returning just months before Julian orders the construction of the Jerusalem temple.5Despite his diffi culties throughout the earlier part of his episcopate, by the 380s Cyril not only maintains episcopal power, he manages to reshape the image of Jerusalem fundamentally, as discussed in chapter 4. In Egeria’s description of the cult of the cross, Golgotha is the liturgical epicenter of Jerusalem, and a good deal of the city’s liturgical practices revolves around Christ’s crucifi xion and the cult of the cross. Th e cornerstone of the liturgical reformation of Jerusalem is “a gold and silver box containing the holy Wood of the Cross.”6 During the Easter weekend, the bishop is positioned behind this most holy of relics in its presentation to wor-shippers as they pass by it one by one, and so the bishop’s location helps to indicate the integral centrality of the holy cross and the crucifi xion to Jerusalem’s liturgical practice. According to Egeria, “[worshippers] stood down, touched the holy Wood fi rst with their forehead and then with their eyes, and then [they kissed] it.”7In Egeria’s exorbitant description, the Anastasis stands in meager comparison to the cult of the cross. By the century’s end, pilgrims are able to trace a liturgical path of Christ’s pain and torture across Jerusalem, from the “navel of the earth” in the Holy Sepulchre to the monks dying every day on the Mount of Olives. Th anks to Egeria we know that a sizable urban transformation has by now taken place; the city has shift ed from Constantinian spectacle to a very diff erent theologized, ritu-alized environment. Still, the various processes underlying this shift from the 350s to the 380s have been elusive and diffi cult to recover. We can turn assuredly to Jan Willem Drijvers, who in his important monograph Cyril of Jerusalem: Bishop and City has presented a thorough case for Cyril’s role in Jerusalem’s transformation.8 In fact, Drijvers should be commended for the wide array of textual (patristic and liturgical especially) and material evidence he arranges with persuasive clarity in support of Cyril’s involvement in the rise of the cult of the cross. Th is chapter builds upon Drijvers’s arguments as we turn to consider more narrowly how Cyril’s theorization of baptismal transformation and identity construction specifi c to Jerusalem contributes to the cult’s growth.Of fundamental interest, then, is the bishop’s manner of transforming his con-gregants from their unbaptized, demonic condition into divinely cleansed and baptized Christians in the Holy City. A tripartite baptismal transformation—material, ontological, and cosmological—comprises a person’s shift from a demonized state of stunted perception in Aelia Capitolina to spiritual perception"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 151in the true, enduring Holy City of Jerusalem. As Cyril understands it, the unbap-tized condition limits a person to the ability to see, touch, and hear only within the immediate sensory environment—such a person can easily perceive Constantine’s basilica, for example. By contrast, baptism endows a person with spiritual powers of perception: the new soldier of Christ can peer through to a deeper, hidden holiness—through such means a person can apprehend Christ’s crucifi xion and passion. In this chapter, therefore, a tight focus falls upon Cyril’s discussions of the baptismal process and how it advances a shift from a kind of demonic anesthesia to divinely enhanced apprehension; we will trace and untangle Cyril’s manner of interweaving three ingredients in his creation of baptized perception: biblical exe-gesis and performance, interplay of sensation and perception in the Jerusalemite environment, and baptismal rituals. To that end, we will discover ways in which Cyril’s model of baptism—his cultivation of baptismal rituals rooted within Jeru-salem’s holiness—anticipates pilgrimage practices that overtake and transform the city in the later fourth and the fi ft h century.9While Cyril understands baptism to equip a person with spiritual perception, he also declares that baptism in Jerusalem endows the baptized with certain responsibilities and obligations. Cyril trains baptizands to take on the obligation of apocalyptic sight. Once a person receives baptism, he or she, as a newly initiated Christian soldier, is capable of and obligated to help disclose what has been long hidden, or even rendered invisible: the baptized must reveal Jerusalem’s holiness in the present-day city of Aelia Capitolina. Additionally, by means of rigorous rit-ual training and daily exorcisms, baptized Christians daily increase their ability to discern the signs (sēmeia) in Jerusalem’s skies that indicate the Eschaton.In addition to exploring Cyril’s ritual development of baptizands’ powers of spir-itual perception, we will trace exactly how he intends Christian soldiers—invested with apocalyptic sight—to release originary biblical events. Cyril focuses predomi-nantly on enabling their perception or sensory experience of Christ’s suff ering in the crucifi xion. In chapter 6 we will pick up and develop these themes further. Cyril proposes a baptized identity modeled in some ways aft er an apocalyptic prophet: Christian soldiers’ ability to discern the eschatological and reveal the invisible pro-vides the backbone of their power against the devil and demons in Jerusalem. Before we can approach the question of spiritual warfare in Jerusalem, we need to understand how the unbaptized can free themselves from demonic corruption.POWERS OF PERCEPTION REGAINED: BAPTISMAL TRAINING AND REVEALING A HIDDEN HOLY CITYTh rough Cyril’s Lenten catechumenate, baptizands generate the “true sight” of Golgotha, the center of the earth.10 Cyril trains baptizands to develop what we will describe as an atemporal mode of vision, or apocalyptic sight.

Th e only event that can end the experience of this cycle will be the fi nal return—the second coming. Th is special sight enables the baptizands’ participation in Christi-anity’s metanarrative. No longer individuals trapped in the present time of the fourth century, they now mingle with biblical prophets and Jesus’s disciples. To Cyril’s mind, those who have not had the benefi t of baptism are by contrast still trapped in a world of temporal progression. Such people are barraged by diverting spectacles and capable only of chasing futilely aft er inscrutable shadows of a higher truth.In his time with baptizands, Cyril endeavors to transform initiates into wit-nesses to and participants in essential events: “Th e Lord was crucifi ed; . . . you see this place (topos) of Golgotha! You answer by crying out, as though agreeing!” He selects vivid biblical descriptions to puncture, even shatter, the present architec-tural surroundings and reveal a more relevant biblical world, a vivid environment that baptizands will inevitably experience. To bypass present-day visual and sen-sory obstacles, he insists that the baptizands participate in the process of their own transformation: “Let your hand not only be stretched out to receive, but also let it be ready to do work.”11 His style of instruction is primarily interrogative. Th rough a barrage of questions, he cultivates in his catechumens a distrust of their passive relationship with the gospel account. Just as they should not be complacent in their immediate surroundings, neither should they feel secure in their knowledge of the biblical narrative. Only through an intimate relationship with scripture can baptizands hope to manipulate their vision in order to see Jesus:You have heard that His [Jesus’s] side was pierced through by a spear. Are you not obliged to see if this is also written? You have heard that He was crucifi ed in a garden. Are you not obliged to see if this is written also? You have heard that He was sold for thirty pieces of silver. Aren’t you obligated to learn which prophet said this? You have heard that vinegar was given to drink. Learn also where this was written.You have heard that his body had been set aside in a rock and a stone was set upon it. Are you not obligated also to take this testimony from a prophet? You have heard that he was buried with thieves. Are you not obligated to see and confi rm if the things regarding his burial have been inscribed?12Th roughout the two lectures, Cyril interrupts the fl ow of his exegesis to question the listeners intensely regarding the deeper details of events, especially since the present manifestation of these sites has so radically strayed from what Cyril feels is essential. Th rough this strategy, as Peter Walker has pointed out, Cyril encourages baptizands to become deeply acquainted with the biblical text. But while Walker suggests that Cyril wishes baptizands to develop a deeper acquaintance with the text in regard to its discursive relation to the surrounding land—for example,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 153matching the Bible’s description of Christ’s tomb with its actual location—we sug-gest something much deeper and thus directly consequential to the baptizands’ transformation into a baptized Christian soldier. Moving beyond matching a bibli-cal passage to the precise location, Cyril intertwines the threads of anthropology, cosmology, and ontology as he describes the transformation of both the baptized person and the surrounding environment; the evocative power in biblical lan-guage illumines a Christian’s perception as it clears the demonic mists that conceal a biblical event.Herein lies a central conceit in Cyril’s enchanted worldview and his animistic understanding of Jerusalem. If one can ritually engage the correct biblical texts at the proper time and place within the Holy City and under the right bodily condi-tions, space and time fracture just enough to allow a sensory glimpse into biblical realities. For his own part, Cyril focuses on teaching baptizands how to retrieve sensory experience of the Passion—most especially the time leading up to and including the crucifi xion. Th us Cyril claims strongly that developing a paraphras-tic relation with the Bible is insuffi cient. Cyril encourages baptizands to fi nd and presumably memorize the actual words that comprise the descriptions of the loca-tions. In this way only may a baptizand move beyond imagining a biblical moment to actually experiencing it. In his instructions, Cyril encourages the baptizands’ endeavors by blurring their temporal relationship with biblical events; notice, for example, the present and future tenses in this passage:But we search to know clearly where He was buried. Is then [Jesus’s] tomb con-structed by hand? Does [Jesus’s tomb] emerge above the earth like the tombs of kings? And what has been set down upon the tomb? Tell me, O Prophets, the truth of the tomb, where Jesus is laid, and where we will search for him.13Cyril places much attention on the tomb’s construction and manner of display; he asks, for example: “Does [Jesus’s tomb] emerge above the earth like the tombs of kings?” Here he refers to Constantine, who ordered construction of not only the surrounding enclosure of twelve pillars in the Sepulchre shrine but also his Holy Apostles church. Baptizands look into and see the sepulcher as it appeared the day Jesus was entombed: “And they say, ‘Look into the solid rock which you have cut [Isa. 51:1].’ Look in and behold.”14 For Cyril, it is the Bible, and not Constantine or Eusebius, that has the authority to direct and determine a Christian’s visual appre-hension of this holy place: “You have it in the Gospels [Mark 15:46; Matt. 27:60; Luke 23:53]. ‘In a tomb cut in stone, which was cut out of rock.’ And what happens next? What kind of door does the tomb have?”15 With Cyril at the helm of the cat-echumenate, of course, it is very much his Bible inculcating the initiates’ eyes.Cyril is not attempting to recapture the historical exactitude of these events in matching text to location. Rather, as Walker has importantly noted, the desire to restore the original appearance of a site, returning the tomb to its “natural state,”"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"154 Cyril and Jerusalemfor example, accords with a modern, not a late antique, mind-set.16 Just as Cyril instructs his baptizands to “look with awe” (thaumazein) upon the locations of biblical events in Jerusalem, he also encourages the development of his version of spiritual perception.17 Much more is involved than using specifi c biblical passages merely to stir the historical imagination in Jerusalem. Instead, scriptural excerpts help baptizands fully enliven that described moment and bring it completely to the surface of their own experience. Th rough the reading or speaking of a relevant passage, baptizands train their eyes to remove the physical crust of the present day and apprehend originary events: Read, speak, and see through to the Passion. For Cyril, then, the descriptive words in the Bible are essential; they participate in vivifying originary biblical events.In his use of the Bible, Cyril develops a powerful conceptualization of language—the enlivening power of words—and this undergirds his discussion of the baptized Christian’s powers of perception. He is hardly alone in holding a view in favor of the visualizing power of language. In fact, in many ways Cyril’s theories are fi rmly embedded within a general cultural understanding of the relationship between ver-bal power and vision. Specifi cally, in this era of an increasingly visible Christianity several Christian leaders dedicate themselves to answering the same question, How does one make the holy visible? Georgia Frank, Patricia Cox Miller, and others have written about this late antique phenomenon at great length. Th at said, at that time interest in the verbal/visual relationship was certainly not limited to Christians; for example, Frank notes a larger late antique movement launched in the Second Sophistic “to render the unseen visible.”18 It was an era in which word and image were never very far apart. As the meaning of graphē (both “writing” and “painting”) indicates, the divide between language and visibility was slight. Th e evocation of sight through sound was a familiar experience to many late antique men and women, whose minds easily conjured the colors, shapes, textures, sounds, and actions described in a vividly detailed passage.Cyril’s own theorization of language both conforms with and departs from late antique culture’s wider understanding of language and vision. What is clear, though, is that his congregants would have been familiar with visually evoking the spoken word as well. Before returning to Jerusalem’s bishop and his baptizands, let us take a brief look at the verbal and visual in the wider world of late antiquity.Dramatic, enlivening description of this kind is achieved through two rhetori-cal devices—ekphrasis and enargeia. Th ese devices are fi ne-tuned by authors to appeal to the imaginal powers of the reader or listener, enticing him or her to visu-alize the event, person, object, or place depicted.Late antique rhetorical handbooks note the power of ekphrasis in particular to stimulate an audience’s visual imagination. Because of its evocative quality, the ekphrastic technique is used to enhance several late antique compositional types, although it is frequently connected to narrative in ancient rhetorical theory.19 In its"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 155characterization of protagonist, action, time, and setting through abundant visual as well as other sensual detail, ekphrasis brings a narrative composition to life, animating the chronological progression of a story. Th is graphic and dramatic device transforms a reader or listener into a spectator of live action in progress.Th e ekphrastic technique has also been traditionally valued for its ability to “reach beyond the listener’s intellect to their emotions,” as Liz James and Ruth Webb have observed.20 Th us ekphrasis has proven to be an indispensable rhetori-cal device in genres like panegyric and encomium, as well as in law courts. It is no surprise, then, that as Christianity moves into the public, and hence visible, sphere of society in the fourth century, and a desire to “see” holiness comes to dominate religious practice, rhetorical forms such as ekphrasis become the favored weapons in ideological battles over the conceptualization of holy space.21 While Constan-tine, Eusebius, and others lead the movement to celebrate Christianity in its impe-rial manifestation, and thus its future, theirs are not the only Christian voices heard. In this radically new environment, other Christians also devise rhetorical strategies to attenuate the border between what is physically present and the more important core events, ideas, and people of biblical times. In the letter written to Marcella by Jerome in the name of Paula and Eustochium, for instance, “Paula” describes her experience at the tomb, and this illustrates the eff ectiveness of such eff orts:Whenever we enter [the tomb of the Lord] we see the Savior lying in the shroud, and lingering a little we see again the angel sitting at his feet and the handkerchief wound up at his head. We know of the glory of this tomb, long before it was hewn from the rock by Joseph, from the prophecy of Isaiah, where he says, “And his rest shall be in honor.” Th us the place of the Lord’s burial shall be revered by all.22Georgia Frank also describes how Paula falls before the cross at Golgotha, “as if she could see Christ on the cross,” according to Jerome.23 Also addressing the passages in Jerome, Cynthia Hahn appraises the manner whereby Paula’s vision or visuali-zation develops slowly and selectively as it “moves to diff erent aspects of story and its meaning—the piteous body of Christ, the angel messengers, the ‘relic’ testi-mony of the shroud,” and explains that Paula experiences a manner of “visualiza-tion that could be readily encouraged by pictoral imagery and a structuring of the site.”24 Most certainly by the time of the attributed visit to Jerusalem, liturgical practice maintains a pilgrim’s focus tightly upon Christ’s crucifi xion and the pow-erful nature of the cross.Th is practice of seeing through the present illusion to originary happenings is tied to the rhetoric developing within Christian literature.25 Hagiography, ser-mons, and poetry, steeped in scriptural allusion, generate a visual discursivity through which people attempt to “reframe physical perception.”26 Christians pro-fess an ability to apprehend sacred reality, thus reanimating and sanctifying the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"156 Cyril and Jerusalemdead polluted, and thus polluting, material. It is Jerome who fi rst argues that with-out spectators looking at human remains a relic is nothing but a thing of dust.27 Moreover, it is the language surrounding an object that guides one to abandon notions of pollution and instead to rush to experience the saint’s praesentia in the martyr’s shrine within the urban center.28 In their narrative elaborations of a saint’s suff ering, for example, authors focus on bodily pain and destruction. Th ey engage the imagination of listeners, transforming them into witnesses of the original tor-ture and death. Basil of Caesarea’s homily In sanctos quadraginta martyres pro-vides an especially gruesome example:Th e body that has been exposed to cold fi rst becomes all livid as the blood freezes. Th en it shakes and seethes, as the teeth chatter, the muscles are convulsed, and the whole mass is involuntarily contracted. A sharp pain and an unspeakable agony reaches into the marrows and causes a freezing sensation that is impossible to bear. Th en the extremities of the body are mutilated, as they are burned [by the frost] as if by fi re. For the heat is driven from the extremities of the body and fl ees to the inte-rior; it leaves the parts that it has abandoned dead, and tortures those into which it is compressed, as little by little death comes on by freezing.29Undeniably, such an account profoundly implicates the audience’s imagination. Ekphrastic passages such as this, however, off er more than a gripping portrayal, as Patricia Miller has argued. Such graphic descriptions within a narrative stir read-ers’ emotions and render them much more susceptible to persuasion and, hence, inculcation. Th rough this technique an author not only infuses the object with an irresistibly evocative content; he or she also situates the listener in a new experien-tial and devotional relationship with that object. By powerfully enticing listeners to experience the horrible and vivid reality of these remains, therefore, authors can show them the manner in which they should approach such objects: as worthy of veneration.30As Frank has shown in her consideration of pilgrimage literature, instruction in “visual piety” is frequently rooted in a distinctive scriptural exegesis.31 When greeted with unfathomable diversity and even inconsistencies in the faces of monks and ascetics in the Egyptian desert, authors refuse to lose heart in their search for facial holiness. Rather, they use their Bible to look closer: “Th eir linger-ing gaze scoured the cracks and crevices of the present for a means to enter and thereby bear witness to that past.”32 Piercing through the sun-beaten wrinkles of an Egyptian hermit, a pilgrim/author can release Isaiah or Abraham to the surface. In the cultivation of this scriptural gaze, authors identify the sacrality in human fl esh, organizing hundreds of faces around a manageable number of biblical types and tropes. In this manner authors instruct readers how to visualize desert piety.Th e twin formulation of language and sight endow the eyes of an audience, as well as the one choosing the words that direct those listening eyes, with a"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 157tremendous degree of creative power. As Frank has remarked, in late antiquity the power of vision is generative. A pilgrim’s visual perception completes the sacrality of a location or object. Th us rhetorical tools do not just off er the audience mental images for their passive consumption; rather, listeners are encouraged to supply more.33 Th is visual language, which instructs an audience in how to apprehend a relic or location, also enlists them to look more deeply on their own. Asterius of Amaseia’s Ekphrasis on Saint Euphemia speaks to this fi nal point. In his detailed description of a painting of Euphemia, Asterius discusses the emotional tenor of the colors used by the painter to portray her death. He concludes with an intrigu-ing request: “Now it is time for you, if you wish, to complete the painting so that you can decide with accuracy whether I have fallen short of it in my interpreta-tion.”34 In such rhetorical visualizations and appeals, the author and reader/listener work together to reimagine the object described—a collaboration that is fast becoming second nature to many in this culture of discursive visibility.To understand Cyril’s own sense of the vivifying power of language, fi rst a word on the Word. Th e bishop’s development of an idiosyncratic notion of verbal illumi-nation informs a complex, fascinating sacramental and biblical anthropology specifi c—once again—to Jerusalem: the Holy Spirit writing the true image of Jerusalem through the eyes of baptized Christians. We see this in his particular development of the larger late antique aesthetic of “word engenders image,” which is tied to the problem of Jerusalem’s image and rooted in local ritual traditions and literary culture.35Th e challenge of verbally accessing Jerusalem’s biblical reality involves more than Cyril’s understanding of the Holy Spirit’s power. We must also have a fi rm grasp of his view of demons and demonology; here too his thought develops along linguistic lines. In fact Cyril distinguishes two types of visual language, which are opposed to each other. Th e fi rst is the Holy Spirit’s word—the Holy Spirit being the author of the Bible, and the inspiration and author of prophecy (written/seeing). Th is language (all biblical) generates the permanent, living, enduring images of holiness in Jerusalem. For example, the Passion, especially the crucifi xion as described, endures unchanged on Golgotha. Th e second type is the devil’s lan-guage: it is unstable and impermanent, and the images emanating from this lan-guage are ephemeral and transient. In creating an apocalyptic seer through baptis-mal training, Cyril is creating someone who can discern the diff erence in language and image and make the proper choice. In doing so, apocalyptic seers—prophets for a crucifi ed Christ—set an example for others.In unpacking Cyril’s view of language we must also consider the bishop’s under-standing of time. As he helps baptizands grasp Jerusalem’s biblical reality or the originary moment, the shackles of linear historical progression fall away. In Cyril’s view event does not follow event, nor does year follow year. Th e model of chrono-logical history is an illusion and allows only a partial glimpse—not to mention a"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"158 Cyril and Jerusalemmisleading one—of a greater truth. Pamela Jackson has documented Cyril’s prac-tice of gathering many “proofs,” “testimonies,” and “witnesses” of scripture—all of which speak to a single, chosen, temporal moment and place, such as the bapti-zand’s immediate proximity to Golgotha (as the site experiencing the crucifi xion) and/or the tomb (as the site experiencing the resurrection).36 Cyril intends the written texts to aid the baptizand’s ability to dissolve the temporal distinctions of past, present, and future. Here, Jesus on the cross merges with Adam at the gates of Paradise; the tree of life fuses with the wood of the cross; Moses changes a river into blood as Christ emits water and blood from his side; Old Testament prophets speak in earshot of the apostles, Jesus, and Cyril himself; and baptizands transform into disciples. Rather than simple exegetical correspondences, these are actual liv-ing events torn through time to stand in and yet dissolve the limitations of the present moment.37A large part of the baptismal training pertains to Cyril’s wish to position his baptizands in a more intimate relation with Jesus. To do so, he exegetically con-jures a human Jesus with whom Jerusalem Christians can have immediate and intimate contact. Upon establishing this connection, Cyril privileges that moment on Golgotha during which the vulnerability of Jesus’s humanity touches the omnipotence of his divinity—at that instant baptizands bear witness to and expe-rience true, unmediated heavenly power.Cyril gives his catechetical instruction within the Holy Sepulchre complex. In Catecheses ad illuminandos 13 and 14, however, he uses words that transport bapti-zands beyond the walls of the Constantinian church. His vivid descriptions carry them to stand before Golgotha and the tomb in a much larger, untouched biblical landscape. His narrative guides their endeavors to visualize and to animate every element and aspect of the crucifi xion. Cyril’s words move them swift ly from high atop Mount Sion in the ruins of Caiaphas’s house to the depths of the tomb. Th e bishop’s exegesis conjures the sensory details of Jesus’s fi nal days of torture and interrogation, death, and rebirth. Pervading both lectures is a sense of the imme-diacy of these events. Although not directly visible to recently enrolled baptizands, all elements of Jesus’s death and rebirth are impatient to burst forth and displace present appearances. Should anyone doubt the actuality and (albeit elusive) mate-riality of these essential moments that involve the cross and the crucifi xion, Cyril conveys the sense that the individuals, objects, and elements of the environment—all that made up the event of the crucifi xion—have been in an animate state, wait-ing and listening. Either now or in the future they will aggressively come into a dynamic state and violently rebuke the gainsayer:Do not deny [the reality of ] the Crucifi ed. For if you should deny him, there exist many who refute you. Judas, the traitor, will be the fi rst to refute you. . . . Gethse-mane bears witness to where the betrayal occurred. . . . Th e moon in the night bears"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 159witness; the day bears witness and the sun suff ers eclipse. For [the sun] did not bear to see the transgression of the ones who conspired [against Jesus]. . . . If you deny [the reality of ] the Cross, the eternal fi re waits for you. . . . Th e house of Caiaphas denies you by proving through its present state of destruction the power of the per-son who was judged there then. And Caiaphas himself on the day of judgment will resist you. Also the servant who gave Jesus a slap in the face will deny, and those who bound and dragged him away. Both Herod and Pilate will resist you, when they say: “Why do you deny the one who was slandered by the Jews, and who we knew never sinned?” . . . Th e praetorium of Pilate has been destroyed by the power of the one who has been crucifi ed. Th e holy Golgotha itself rises high up and even at this point in time shows how through Christ the rocks were torn apart against the door of his tomb.38Cyril is exquisitely adept in mixing and arranging biblical excerpts using ekph-rasis. He craft s verbal images that strongly revivify the last moments of Jesus’s life on earth for baptizands; more intriguingly still, he redeploys aspects of those events to threaten his baptizands on occasion, as we see in the passage above. Rely-ing on his ekphrastic skills alone, Cyril easily inspires the baptizands’ imaginations to respond. However, by using the Bible as source text—and a divinely empowered one at that—and by drawing upon the holiness of Jerusalem, Cyril goes much further than producing visually evocative descriptions of events far in the past. He seeks rather to erase the bulwark of history that holds his baptizands at so far a distance from the physical experience of biblical events such as Christ’s crucifi x-ion. In his complex theorization of the evocative power of language—spiritual lan-guage more specifi cally—Cyril seeks a transformation of his baptizands wherein they do much more than gain an imaginative hold over biblical events: they actu-ally become part of those moments. However, this is a rare and rarefi ed experi-ence. Before baptizands can hope to attain access to this kind of perception, they have to escape the hold that the present moment has over them. Th is involves nothing less than escaping the demons determined to hold them fast in the con-fusing swirl of illusions and delusions that most of the population of that time believes to be reality.THE DEMONICALLY BLINDED CITYTh e obstacles to Cyril’s spiritual sight are many. First and foremost, demons trap a person’s perception in the present moment. Th erefore baptizands will not be truly free from the limiting eff ects of temporality and capable of perceiving through to timeless biblical moments until they have been baptized and have received the Eucharist. To complicate matters, the devil has been alerted by the initiation cer-emony to the existence of those training for baptism, and he is on the hunt. Cyril warns that the devil waits carefully, selecting and stalking his prey. He counsels his"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"160 Cyril and Jerusalembaptizands to “take care that [the dragon does] not bite [them] and inject his poi-son of unbelief.”39 A baptizand must be on his/her guard and “fl ee every diabolical force and be not persuaded by the apostate dragon,” who lurks in the surrounding landscape.40 Cyril insists that baptizands be distrustful of everyone, including himself if he strays from creedal teaching: “Do not attend to the lips of the one speaking guile but to the spirit of disbelief (apistia) and deceit who works in him.”41 In his list of places and activities that baptizands must avoid, Cyril draws a vivid picture of the city’s religious pluralism:[Do not attend] the fabulous divinations of the Greeks (tais mythōdesi tōn Hellēnōn manteiais). Poison, incantation, and the transgressive things of necromancy (phar-makeian . . . epaoidian . . . ta nekyomanteiōn paranomōtata)—do not allow [Greek magic] within the range of your hearing (mēde mechris akoēs paradechou). Stand apart from every type of intemperance, being neither a glutton nor one who loves pleasure, and, above all else, refrain from every avarice and lending out interest. Do not join in with groups attending the heathen spectacles (theōpiōn ethikois); never use binding spells in sickness. Turn away completely from visiting taverns. You should not go out to join the Samaritans or Judaism. . . . Stand back from observing any of the Sabbaths and turn away from speaking of indiff erent meats as common or unclean. . . . But hate especially all of the assemblies of the heretics.42From one angle this reads as a formulaic text found in most baptismal and cat-echetical texts: a list detailing what someone must surrender of their former life to gain the spiritual benefi ts of a baptized Christian existence. Christians must give up divinatory practice, other forms of magic, and attending other Christian (heretical) congregations; they must abandon the theater, hippodrome, gambling, and so forth. All of this was standard fare as a list of the devil’s pomps. Cyril, how-ever, also includes limits on sensory experience: certain activities should not come within range of a baptizand’s sight, touch, smell, and the other senses. Cyril maps the dangerous areas of the city and indicates where baptizands can travel; they should sever themselves sensorily from the areas where the devil exists: Greek spectacles, especially of magic (e.g., poisons, incantations, and necromancy), tav-erns, the synagogue, and Samaritan and Manichaean locations of worship. Cyril singles out hearing—a sense tied to language—in particular: “do not allow [Greek magic] within the range of your hearing (mēde mechris akoēs paradechou).”In an eff ort to control and regulate baptizands’ movements, Cyril takes special time to describe the devil’s involvement in the wider religious life in Jerusalem, which includes Greeks, Samaritans, Manichaeans, Jews, and heretics. Cyril por-trays an unbaptized Christian population all too vulnerable to the devil’s tricks in the urban sphere; as Cyril insinuates, demons are quite adept at moving through Jerusalem in company with the non-Christian human bodies of Greeks, Jews, and heretics, using those bodies to attract the unwary and foolish. Greeks use “their"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 161smooth tongue” especially to seduce men, leading them astray “for honey drops from the lips of a harlot”; Jews infect a person’s perceptions “by divine scripture which they twist by false interpretations”; and heretics are perhaps the most dan-gerous of all the devil’s foot soldiers, for they take control of the sense of hearing with false doctrine: “By smooth words and fl attery [they] deceive [the] hearts of [the] simple, disguising with the honey of Christ’s name the poisoned shaft s of impious doctrine.”43 In his instructions to baptismal candidates, Cyril paints entire territories beyond the Holy Sepulchre as places that present the ritual temptations of the devil: the fabulous mysteries of Greek divination, miraculous Greek and Jewish healing formulae for the sick, fascinating religious imports such as Man-ichaeanism. Still, he truly fears only those groups that perform a twisting of holy language: that is, Jews and heretics.Th is state of pluralistic demonic dangers has persisted for centuries, from the time of Christ’s death. According to Cyril, within weeks of Jesus’s death demons had taken hold of humankind to spread falsehoods about Christ’s message. In Cat-ech. illum. 6.13ff ., Cyril explains at great length how the devil has worked through arch-heretics over the course of Christian history. In Cyril’s heresiology the devil has managed to pervert tongues and twist mouths for centuries. Th is has led, and still leads, to the downfall of multitudes. Cyril describes the heretic Simon Magus as “the fi rst dragon of wickedness,” who was fi nally defeated; but “when one head had been cut off , the stem of wickedness proved to be many-headed.”44 Cyril draws from a tradition of heretical genealogies; for example, he introduces Simon Magus not simply as chief heretic or even a demonized chief heretic, but as the originator of a kind of demonism that emerges within weeks of Jesus’s death. Th e diabolic sickness is capable of infi ltrating and corrupting the rational faculties of weaker Nicene Christians as well as heretics. As a result, all too many of them are incapa-ble of seeing and perceiving Christian truth. In Cyril’s account, the devil captured Simon fi rst. Aft er that, the devil traffi cked through the compromised minds and mouths of Cerinthus, Menander, Carpocrates, Ebionites, and Marcionites. Cyril then adds Basilides and Valentinus to the list of the heretically contagious.45In addition, Cyril expounds on the devil’s mixture of verbal/auditory/visual interactions with humankind. In Catech. illum. 4.1 he explains that even today “the devil disguises himself as an angel of light [2 Cor. 11:14]”; in this disguise, he is able to “surround in a blinding mist and the poisonous atmosphere of skepticism those who are leading an angelic life.”46 Cyril gives the impression that since Christ’s crucifi xion there has been more demonic delusion and darkness than light. He does not sound the note of the triumphalism and optimism we might expect to hear from the bishop of a basilica within view of the Anastasis. Rather than speak-ing of the glories of the resurrection, Cyril dwells on the deception injected into the world by the devil since Christ’s crucifi xion: “Many wolves go around in the clothing of sheep; while they gain a sheep’s covering for themselves, they do not"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"162 Cyril and Jerusalemtake away their claws and fangs. Dressed in the gentle wool, but seducing the inno-cent by their appearance (schēma), they pour forth the deadly poison of impiety from their fangs.”47 Th us it is imperative that his baptizands perceive their sur-roundings clearly. He therefore provides a graphic and frightening portrayal of the demonic possession of the soul:For when the unclean devil came into the soul of a man . . . like a wolf, he arrived greedy for blood, ready for meat and sheep. [Jesus’s] arrival (parousia) is fi erce. Sen-sation is utterly darkened. Th e mind is dark (skotōdēs ēi dianoia). Both the attack and the seizure of another’s possession happens without justice. [Th e demon] violently uses another’s body and another’s organ. [Th e demon] throws down a person who stands up; . . . he perverts the tongue (paratrepei tēn glōssan), he twists the lips (stre-bloi cheile); there is foam instead of words; a person is darkened (skotoutai); the eye is open, but through it, the soul does not see.48EXORCISM: CLEANSING THE SOULTh e words of the Nicene Creed, or Pistis (literally, “trust” or “belief ”) as Cyril refers to it, have material resonance. Th ey have an exegetical connection to the Bible in proofs and testimony. In baptismal training, however, the Creed is fi rst and foremost a verbal object, a collection of the Holy Spirit’s words; a good number of those words in fact indicate the fi nal moments of Jesus Christ’s time on earth in Jerusalem, his death on Golgotha, his resurrection from the tomb, and his ascension on the Mount of Olives. A baptizand learns the Creed during training, in the usual manner of bib-lical exegesis. However, Cyril also understands the Creed—the words themselves—to become an embodied part of the baptizand’s person through the process of bap-tismal training. With the Nicene Creed, the baptizand takes one step closer to becoming the incarnated key—the apocalyptic seer—in Jerusalem. Baptism itself completes the process: the Holy Spirit fi lls the baptizand with an illuminating light, allowing that person to see the Passion, the crucifi xion, and signs of the Eschaton.Wonderful sights await baptized Christians, provided they survive baptismal training. Before baptism, many obstacles stand in their way. Cyril doubts the abil-ity of baptizands’ souls to grasp any element of the Creed in their prebaptismal state. Th eir souls, minds, and faculties of perception, particularly their visual fac-ulties, have been utterly corrupted by the fi lth spewed forth by demonic images and other sensory material in the city. Th us Cyril proposes a daily exorcistic regi-men, which specifi cally targets the corroding material for removal. In an incredi-bly detailed, and for our purposes fortuitous, passage, Cyril describes the removal of demonic sediments through exorcistic therapy:Receive the exorcisms with all seriousness. Whether you have been breathed upon or exorcised, the ritual (pragma) is your salvation. Th ink about the glistening gold,"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 163mixed together with many materials: copper, and tin, and iron, and lead; We seek to have only the gold; the gold is unable to be cleansed of the accretions without fi re. In the same way the soul is unable to be cleansed without exorcisms; but [exorcisms] are divine, since they are gathered together from scriptures. Your face is covered in order that your mind (dianoia) has leisurely time to think, and so that a roving eye should not make your heart rove as well. But the covered eye does not stop the ears from receiving salvation. For just as there is a way that goldsmiths, through delicate tools, direct a spirit into the fi re, [and] bubble up the gold hidden inside the crucible, by devising a way of rousing the sought-for fl ame, in the same way the exorcists strike fear by means of the divine Spirit and thus renew through fi re the soul in the body’s crucible; our enemy the devil fl ees [and] . . . the soul, purifi ed of its off enses, has salvation.49Th is is an incredibly rich passage, and several details warrant closer examination. Th e central image, which draws heavily from the practices of a goldsmith, seems to convey Cyril’s understanding of embodied, sensory existence. Cyril is describ-ing here the demonic sediments—in terms of copper, tin, iron, and lead—that a mind/soul acquires over time. Moreover, Cyril understands these sediments to have accumulated through the faculty of vision and to a lesser extent through that of hearing (words generating images). Th us thick layers of demonic impurities prevent direct, unmediated visual interaction with the true, holy Jerusalem. Cyril envisages a layer of demonic sensory perception in the soul, cutting the soul off and contorting its direct interaction with the enduring images of Christ’s Passion.Especially fascinating here and elsewhere are the faint traces within Cyril’s overarching demonology of deep, experimental play with Stoic theories of visual perception, also known as haptic theories of vision: the ancients’ model of the tactile nature of sight. In Stoic theory, vision works on the principle of physical contact: either through extramission, in which the eye emits atoms that return with visual information about the surrounding environment, or through intromis-sion, in which objects in the world emit atoms that the haptic nerve catches and transmits to the eye, leaving an impression.50In this age of incipient pilgrimage and relic veneration, Christians understand the act of seeing a relic as, in a sense, grasping divinity in the created world and being altered by it. In recognizing the growing materialism of late antiquity, Patri-cia Cox Miller has written a good deal about Christians’ ideas regarding the tangi-bility of ritualized sight derived from these ancient haptic theories of vision. While Miller and others have noted the positive aspects in the incorporation of haptic theory into the visual engagement with holiness, we must understand that haptic theory also explains the ill eff ects of demonic sight.Even more intriguing, in light of our interest in the ability of apocalyptic seers to reveal or change Jerusalem’s image, is the concept of “visceral seeing,” through which Patricia Cox Miller approaches the metamorphosing function of Christian"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"164 Cyril and Jerusalemvision. In relic veneration, for instance, seeing transforms the static object or non-descript location into a “kinetic presence” that involves “a connective and embod-ied viewing” that creates or recreates the body of the viewer.51 Scholars have situ-ated this experimentation with visuality toward the end of the fourth century, by which time pilgrimage and relic veneration had a fi rm grip on the religious sensi-bilities of the Mediterranean world. I propose, however, that in his works’ eff orts to encourage baptizands to see through to the true Jerusalem, Cyril provides strong evidence for an earlier date for this experimentation.In his description of exorcism, Cyril is clearly working within Stoic materialism and theories of vision but describing something somewhat diff erent and with altogether more frightening consequences. While straightforward haptic theory proposes that atoms leave only an impression of the object seen, Cyril’s description of exorcism suggests a material residue is left and hardens so that it becomes stuck to the soul. Copper, tin, iron, and lead damage the soul and tarnish and hide its golden exterior; they create a crust that severs the soul from true, unadulterated sensory contact with its surroundings. What does a person do once he/she has been contaminated and is coated with the demonic viscosity left by the simple act of perceiving (or taking in) the malevolent images and deceptive words?Cyril’s description of exorcism’s role is precise, given his Christological and his-torical ideas about seeing Jerusalem. What is important to him are the ritual steps necessary to scrape the demonic accretions off the surface of the soul and enable an unimpeded view of originary events and future signs in the Holy City. Th e lan-guage he uses in Protocatechesis 9 is quite specifi c. He directs the “covering of the eyes”; he demands the closure of one sense (eyes) for the opening of another (ears). Although up to this point we have been preoccupied with the sense of sight, Cyril specifi cally names the auditory faculty as the means of cleansing the vision: “Exor-cisms gathered from divine scriptures are divine.”52 In other words, Cyril describes here not only the task of removing demonic accretions from the soul’s surface—in a sense a reversal of the damage sustained in the demonically manipulated mechanics of haptic vision—but also the simultaneous process of fostering recol-lection. And here we encounter a theologized anthropology that is easily missed. In his characterization of a buried memory regained in exorcism, Cyril suggests that the primordial experience of the Passion in holy Jerusalem (specifi cally the crucifi xion) exists in everyone. Words culled from scripture—perhaps quotations from the Passion scenes—will expel the copper, tin, iron, and lead and enable the golden memory of the crucifi xion to rise to the surface.Cyril alludes to a particular event in Jerusalem’s very vivid sacred history, a period that also exists as an embodied part of every human being. As a cosmo-gonic event, the gravity of the crucifi xion is deeply imprinted in humanity’s soul, along with images of the Passion; this ontological constant has existed in every human being from the day of Christ’s death and will continue to do so until the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 165day of his return. However, the day-to-day debris of living—that is, the haphazard clutter of images, thoughts, and sounds, as well as the dross born of family traditions, theological battles, ethnic and cultural particularities, and religious diff erences—covers over those images until they are lost in the soul’s deepest recesses. Cyril puts great stock in the ritual effi cacy of prebaptismal exorcisms as a means of uncovering these core images. More to the point, we can also see that Cyril understands exorcism, the Creed, and baptism as the means of tying Chris-tians—and the image of Jerusalem—irrevocably to the Holy City itself. In eff ect, then, what Cyril proposes is a creedal baptism that provides Christians with a supremely intimate relationship with the Holy City; and Jerusalemite baptism out-paces all others in providing Christians with an authentic recovery of their own ontological piece of the Passion.Consequently, Cyril’s ritual regime is closely linked to the ekphrastic descrip-tions found throughout his baptismal instructions. He guides the baptizand through a kind of visual calisthenics intended to help him or her to see through to the crucifi xion. Th rough Cyril’s instructions and ritual regimen, the baptizand eventually develops the ability to transform his or her own sight in order to visual-ize an originary (biblical) memory. More importantly, perhaps, once that person is baptized and becomes an apocalyptic seer, he may then go out into Jerusalem itself and establish that desired “connective and embodied viewing” with the surround-ings, transforming—or more properly reverting—Jerusalem to its true image.53Th e road to this truth is long, and the person’s soul has been compromised for a lifetime. Th e layers of false images that have lain on the surface of Jerusalem for centuries work in tandem with personal demonic blindness. Th e two create an almost impenetrable barrier that prevents an individual Christian from perceiv-ing—and indeed experiencing—the authentic realities of his/her surrounding environment. As a result an unbaptized person is restricted to a visual and auditory perception that is stranded in an experience of the present only. Timeless Christian realities—such as Christ’s Passion—are imperceptible and unattainable to a mind and soul damaged in this way. Prebaptismal exorcisms enable the soul to receive the Creed, baptismal seal, and Eucharist—all are essential to regaining what Cyril describes as spiritual perception. Only these rituals will enable a person’s unim-peded perceptual experience of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Exorcisms are vital to peel away the layers of illusory visual experience and recapture that perennial real-ity. Th e process involves ritually scraping accretions away to reach the raw percep-tual material of the image of the event that is embedded deeply in the baptizand’s soul, in tandem with a rigorous scriptural retraining of the eyes and ears to stretch out and grasp Jerusalem properly. Th e Creed—a biblical/theological formula situ-ating Christ’s Passion correctly in Christianity’s soteriology—meets that event and can also now rest implanted in the soul. And that person’s eyesight can begin to take notice of the demons in the air."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"166 Cyril and JerusalemSuch progress encourages endurance. Baptizands endure the rigor of the exorcistic procedure. Th e sexes have to be separated. While waiting, men should read a “profi table book”54 or pray or talk about something useful. Virgins, as com-pared to men, should sing hymns or read silently. Cyril speaks regarding the dis-position of the exorcised, and the benefi ts to be gained, during the actual proce-dure: “Allow our mind to be sharpened to the point of reverence; allow your soul to be forged like metal; allow the stubbornness of unfaith (apistia) to be ham-mered on the anvil until the accretions fall off , until the pure iron remains.”55 Th e soul fi nds renewed strength, directing it to the eyes, which will soon be able to cut through to originary events, and the cross itself will be within sight.BUILDING PISTIS INTERNALLYWe anchor our consideration of the baptismal process in Cyril’s Creed, which has been published by Alexis James Doval:We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, of all things visible and invisible (Catech. illum. 9.4). And in one Lord, Jesus Christ (Cat-ech. illum. 7.4), the only-begotten Son of God, who was begotten God of the Father before all worlds, by whom all things were made (Catech. illum. 11.21), Who was crucifi ed and buried and descended into Hell (Catech. illum. 4.10–11; 13.38–39; 14.3, 11, 17, 18), Who rose on the third day, and ascended into Heaven, and sat on the right hand of the Father (Catech. illum. 14.24), and is to come in glory to judge the living and the dead; of Whose kingdom there will be no end (Catech. illum. 15.2). And in one Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, who spoke through the prophets (Catech. illum. 17.3), and in one Baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, and in one Holy Catholic Church, and in the resurrection of the fl esh, and in eternal life (Catech. illum. 18.22).56Some scholars have criticized Cyril’s Creed for its simplicity. In fact, R. P. C. Han-son has characterized Cyril’s formulation somewhat derisively as “curiously devoid of interesting features.”57 For our purposes, it is not the content of the Creed as much as the Creed as a verbal object that is of interest. How does Cyril objectify the Creed as pistis, over and against apistia? Pistis as a material object is comprised of words only. Yet the words, once they have become an embodied part of a bap-tized Christian, can function as a key, unlocking, for the eyes of that Christian, the visual truth of the Holy City of Jerusalem.As mentioned above, Cyril defi nes pistis narrowly. In his instructions he sug-gests that the words of the Creed have a materiality; he is very specifi c regarding the need for secrecy and discretion, ascribing a special nature to the words given to his baptizands’ care; he also stresses the importance of memorization. One should also never casually omit words. Th e words of the Creed not only convey an important discursive message; they are an object in their own right, worthy of veneration:"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 167they serve as a verbal cipher that tightly and precisely brings together historical moments with cosmological consequences. In light of its importance, Cyril’s instruction is worth quoting in full:In learning and professing the Creed, possess and guard (ktēsai kai tērēson) only that which is given over to you by the church, and which all the scriptures confi rmed, . . . that which I wish you to memorize word for word, and to repeat to each other with all zeal, not writing it on paper, but engraving it by memory on the heart. Only be careful, in rehearsing it, that no catechumen chance to overhear what has been deliv-ered to you. Possess this as a provision in the entire length of your life beyond this; receive no other; though we ourselves should change and stand against what we teach now; even though an enemy angel, transformed into an angel of light, should try to lead you astray. For even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel to you other than that which you have now received, let him be anathema.For the present just listen and memorize the Creed (mnēmoneuson tēs pisteōs) as I recite it to you, and you will receive by and by the entire construction from the scriptures for each article (apo tōn theiōn graphōn peri ekastou tōn egkeimenōn). For not according to men’s satisfaction have the articles of faith been composed, but the most important points collected from the scriptures make up one total and complete teaching of the Creed. . . . Th us be careful, brothers, and hold tightly to the teachings which are now given to you, and “write them on the tablet of your heart” (apogra-psasthe autas eis to tēs kardias umōn).With piety guard them so that the enemy may not plunder those who have grown indiff erent or some heretic may not pervert (paratrepsēi) the words entrusted to you. . . . Keep this Creed which is delivered to you without stain (aspilon) until the epiphany of our Lord Jesus Christ.58Cyril insists that once a person memorizes the Creed, once the words of the Creed along with its proofs, witnesses, and testimonies are fused into the baptizand’s mind, in an exact and proper order, that person’s own body becomes a creedal ves-sel, in a very real, material, visible manner. A person is the outer casing, an exterior protection surrounding a deeply embedded and embodied creedal truth. Cyril describes the necessity of carefully assembling all elements of what is contained inside in order to protect the interiority of the baptizand from contamination:Let me think about the catechizing as though it is a building. If we will join the struc-ture [of catechizing] together in a manner conforming with how a house is bound together, so that you discover nothing frivolous, and the house should not become rotten, nothing of our earlier trouble shall help. But stone must follow upon stone in a regular manner, and corner fall upon corner; all excess within the construction must be pulled away; and thus the completed structure rises up. Th erefore I will bring to you, in a manner of speaking, stones of knowledge; you must hear the doctrines of the living God; you must hear the doctrines of the judgment; you must hear the doctrines of Christ; you must hear the doctrines of the resurrection. And many things have to be said in a regular pattern that are currently being joined together in a scattered fashion, but they will be brought together in a regular order."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"168 Cyril and JerusalemBut unless you join everything together into one structure, keeping in your mind the fi rst and the second, the builder builds, but you will have a rotten building.59An improper fi t between the creedal foundation and its proofs, explains Cyril, will compromise the apologetic value of pistis:If you have fi rmly established yourself (hestēkas) in the Creed (pistis), you are blessed; if you have fallen into unbelief (apistia), cast away your unbelief from this day on and be fully confi dent. . . . For [the Holy Spirit] is ready to seal (sphragisai) your soul, and shall give you that seal heavenly and divine at which demons tremble (sphragida hēn tremousi daimones), just as it is written: and when you believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the Promise. But the Holy Spirit tests (dokimazei) the soul; it does not cast pearls before swine. If you pretend, men will now be baptizing you, but the Spirit will not baptize you; but if you approach with pistis, men will minister to you visibly, but the Holy Spirit will bestow on you what is not visible. For you are coming to a great test (exetasin), to a great battle in the space of a single hour; if you are judged worthy of the grace, your soul will be illuminated, and you will receive a power (dynamin) you did not possess before. You will receive arms that are terrifying to demons (opla phrikōdē tois daimosin); and if you do not throw your arms away, but hold the seal upon your soul, the demon will not approach; he will cower away in fear; for by the Spirit of God demons are cast out (en pneumati theou ekballetai ta daimonia).60BAPTISM AND THE INDWELLING POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRITOnce a person has regained the original condition of the soul that was present before demonic accretion, Cyril speaks of enhancing sight in that person. It is not enough to see clearly with the “eyes of the fl esh”; one has to see beyond and to pierce through to originary events. Such power (dynamis) comes with the indwell-ing Holy Spirit and involves the rite of baptism itself. Georgia Frank has already elegantly described Cyril’s declaration of the empowering eff ects of the Eucharist. Th rough this ritual, one can pierce through the obfuscating world of sensory expe-rience to the divine realities beyond the material world. In her analysis of Cyril’s mystagogic sermons, Frank focuses attention on Cyril’s understanding of the care-ful and precise material transformation of various parts of the baptized body (fore-head, eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, breast, hands, feet). As Frank explains, the “piece-meal anointing [in the Eucharist] was signifi cant for Cyril, for with each touch a diff erent spiritual sense was awakened.”61 In Cyril’s words: “Th en upon the ears; to receive ears quick to hear the divine mysteries, the ears of which Isaiah said: ‘Th e Lord gave me also an ear to hear’ [cf. Isa. 50:4]. Th en upon the nostrils, that, scent-ing the divine oil, you may say: ‘We are the incense off ered by Christ to God’ [2 Cor.].”62 And so on."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 169Cyril describes a similar enlivening of perception when he explains the spirit-ual eff ects of baptism. But now it pertains to the sense of sight alone:[Th e Holy Spirit’s] coming is gentle, the perception of him fragrant, his yoke light; rays of light and knowledge shine forth before his coming. He comes with the heart of a true guardian; he comes to save, to cure to admonish, to strengthen, to console, to enlighten the mind fi rst of the man who receives him, then through him the minds of others also. As a man previously in darkness and suddenly seeing the sun gets the faculty of sight and sees clearly what he did not see before, so the man deemed wor-thy of the Holy Spirit is enlightened in the soul and sees beyond human sight what he did not know. Th ough his body is upon the earth, his soul beholds the heavens as in a mirror. He sees, like Isaiah [Isa. 6.1], “Th e Lord seated on high and loft y throne”; he sees, like Ezekiel, “him who is above the cherubim”; he sees, like Daniel, “thou-sands upon thousands and myriads upon myriads”; and little man sees the beginning and the end of the world, the times in between, the successions of kings; in short, things he had not learned, for the true enlightener is at hand. Th e man is confi ned within walls; yet his power of knowledge ranges far and wide, and he perceives even the actions of others.63Th is enhanced visual perception is not for personal edifi cation or piety, however. Rather, Cyril pulls the spiritual charism of baptized vision into a more comprehen-sive demonology, which includes a wider view of spiritual warfare. In Catecheses ad illuminados 17, he provides a substantive explanation regarding the power passed to the baptizand in the rite itself: “[Th e Holy Ghost] is present in readiness to seal your soul, and he shall give you that seal at which evil spirits tremble, a heavenly and sacred seal.”64In its apotropaic power alone, the baptismal seal protects a person from regain-ing the demonic accretions that have deadened his spiritual sight. However, as Cyril makes clear in Catech. illum. 3, this new power (dynamis) is not only protec-tive. A Christian now has the ability and even the duty to battle the devil: “For you go down into the water bearing your sins, but by the invocation of grace, by plac-ing a seal upon your soul, it no longer happens that you are consumed by the fear of the dragon. . . . He gives you the authority to battle with the enemy powers.”65 Th is is an authority (exousia) that is fortifi ed by the fact that the Holy Spirit is now indwelling—a great, incalculable power, the purpose of which we will discuss in chapter 6. Th e baptized are charged with the task of seeing through demonic images to the true Jerusalem. Accomplishing such a task will take much more than the rituals performed on them. Visual retraining is also necessary—a retraining that will fuse them scripturally to the Holy City.Let us return to the Holy Sepulchre, if only briefl y. While this church certainly plays a large role as a ritual setting in their baptismal training, Cyril’s instructions draw baptizands’ attention as well as their physical presence repeatedly beyond its walls. As Cyril describes the abilities endowed by the Holy Spirit, a man may be"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"170 Cyril and Jerusalemconfi ned within walls, but he has a “power of knowledge [that] ranges far and wide.”66 Cyril is preparing the baptizands to receive the Holy Spirit in order that, once they have received baptism, each one then “sees beyond human sight what he did not know. Th ough the [baptized Christian’s] body is on earth, his soul is able to see through to the heavens as if looking in a mirror.” In other words, they will gain visionary power through the Holy Spirit in the same manner as the prophets of old.67 Cyril directs his baptizands to see the true Jerusalem through the words of “divine scripture, which possesses divine power.”68 Cyril ascribes to scriptural words the power to exorcise the demonic from the mind and recapture primordial experiences of the Holy Land; baptizands must learn how to see the true Jerusalem obscured by Constantinian monumentality or the remnants of Hadrianic victory. Instead they must learn the scriptural words, phrases, and narratives revealed through the scriptural language that indicates the living realities lying just beneath the illusory surface covering Jerusalem at present.In the end, then, Cyril’s baptized Christians are engaged in a mode of seeing that is intended not for personal piety but for their role as apocalyptic seers engaged in spiritual warfare. Th us Cyril has much in common with the authors of 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch, and even with the Bordeaux Pilgrim. Lurking beneath the apparent reality of chaos, destruction, and ambiguity in the demonically tainted Aelia are a true image and history of Jerusalem that demands the eyes and souls of those religiously trained to release them. While Cyril intends his baptismal train-ing to restore the true, apocalyptic (revealing/unveiling) vision of Jerusalem and sensory truth to baptizands, there is much more to his program than simply restoring sight. In the rehabilitation of the sensory faculties through the rituals of exorcism, creedal transformation, and baptism, Cyril transforms the physiological shape of baptizands’ minds and bodies for Jerusalem. Likewise, in the intense visual instruction in Jerusalem, he teaches them how to take the Bible to the land and engage in a practical education of fi nding the places in the landscape of Jeru-salem. What we see here is something much more involved than general baptismal training. Is all of this simply to outfi t Jerusalemite baptizands for a blissful, peace-ful life as Christians following baptism? It would be impossible for baptized Chris-tians to return to anything approximating their life before Cyril’s baptismal train-ing. And in light of the rigor of his interrogation in the Protocatachesis Cyril may not have admitted just anyone to his baptismal training.In his training, Cyril develops a mode of apocalyptic sight in exemplary bapti-zands; this mode of vision is intended for spiritual warfare. A baptized person’s eyes, according to Cyril, can see not only into the divine realities of Jerusalem but into the demonic ones as well. And as baptizands’ eyes open to the images of Christ and the apostles surrounding Him, their behavior should alter in accordance with"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Devil in the Word 171this unfolding reality—in prayer, vigils, and biblical readings. Even the simple but striking act of witnessing produces certain behavioral modifi cations. Likewise, as their eyes open up to the daily practice of discerning demons within the spectacles of Greeks, Jews, and Manichaeans in Aelia’s confusing landscape, their bodies will react to and against the diabolic elements within their view. We contend that this is certainly Cyril’s intention in light of the fi erce diabolization in his baptismal training. As the senses are cleansed and readjusted to apprehend the actual reality of Jerusalem, the body will follow in its actions against that environment. Baptism endows them with the power to battle demons.How exactly (and indeed whether) this power would manifest is impossible to say. Perhaps it would be expressed in something as simple as the sign of the cross, or in a more elaborate antidemonic ritual to neutralize demonic illusions—but the actions of the baptized would be visibly altered.Finally, then, we must pause to consider not only what baptized Christians are being trained to see in Jerusalem but also how they are being seen in the city. As they move around Jerusalem, seeing deeper realities of the city, they mingle with other Jerusalemites and pilgrims. One wonders how much of their visual training and related behaviors spreads to infl uence the visual practices of others. How long is it before others look at the theater, baths, and synagogue and see demons that they have to fi ght for the glory of Christ?"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"172Newly sealed Christians greet Jerusalem as entirely diff erent beings. Th e letters of the Creed engraved in their hearts, with the Holy Spirit itself illuminating each letter, they walk through Jerusalem’s streets capable of seeing much more than what is visible to the unbaptized. Th e Holy Spirit has transformed their senses to enable the baptized to see the true Jerusalem; they pierce through the distracting and false images to apprehend the crucifi xion. What are they to do aft er seeing these new visual realities? What kind of guidance does Cyril provide? How does this new sensory ability change their existence day to day? What purpose does their ability to see in a spiritually heightened manner serve? How does Cyril intend their power to aff ect the church or the city as a whole?In chapter 5 we explored how baptized Christians are trained and ritually molded to apprehend originary events—chief among them Christ’s crucifi xion. Th is chapter argues that the enhanced vision serves a second purpose. Cyril is preparing the baptized to assume a particular role related to his belief in the com-ing end of days—for simplicity’s sake, we term this role “apocalyptic prophet,” though Cyril does not use this language. He instructs baptizands in his brand of apocalyptic eschatology, explaining what events, images, and individuals indicate the fi nal end of days. His eschatology pinpoints a core group of loyal Christians as insiders (Jerusalem’s true soldiers of Christ/pistoi) who will protect the cross, set in direct opposition to a group of outsiders (the demonically tainted/apistoi) who do not believe in the centrality of the cross.1 Th e fact that these opposed groups have now reached the height of their confl ict signals that the end of days is imminent, if not already under way. Cyril is not engaging in fi gurative divisions but marking divisions between insiders and outsiders that speak to the actual confl icts and 6Apocalyptic Prophets and the CrossRevealing Jerusalem’s Demons from the Crucifi xion to the End of Days"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 173tensions within contemporary Jerusalem; that is, this language serves to protect Cyril’s true Jerusalem by naming any competing forces or imperial powers who may try to defi ne the city. In fact, Cyril identifi es two threats to his version of Jeru-salem that we will consider: (1) the role Bishop Acacius of Caesarea played in Cyril’s exiles, and (2) Julian’s short-lived plans to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. Consequently, one of the main foci of this chapter pertains to considering Cyril’s dualizing rhetoric (demarcating insider versus outsider) within his overarching eschatology. In redefi ning and deepening the hostility in contemporary confl icts and tensions (i.e., Acacius and Julian) in this manner, Cyril pushes his baptizands and baptized Christians to the edge of interreligious violence.Scholars have long recognized that Catechesis ad illuminandos 15 contains a high degree of eschatological content. For example, the well-known chapters 11–17 describe the coming of an antichrist—a man of “wonders”—who will beguile the Jews into following him once he rises from their temple. Oded Irshai has recently argued that these chapters describe Julian and represent an interpolation that was inserted in the text some time aft er the earthquake in Jerusalem in 362 that had put a stop to any work on rebuilding the temple.2 While Irshai’s arguments are persua-sive, we will propose a slightly diff erent relationship between this text and the rest of a lecture steeped in a rich apocalyptic eschatology; furthermore, there is evi-dence of this worldview in other lectures as well.As we trace the depths of Cyril’s apocalyptic eschatology in Catech. illum. 15 and other lectures, we will consider the following: (1) Cyril’s strategies for inculcating baptizands into his apocalyptic eschatology (What role do they play as apocalyptic prophets?); (2) how this worldview organizes his community (insiders) in their antagonistic relationship with the opposition (outsiders) both ecclesiastical (Acacius) and imperial (Julian); (3) the issue of interreligious violence. In order to stretch into each of these three areas, we turn to recent theoretical conceptualiza-tions of apocalypticism, millennialism, eschatology, and violence. Th is branch of scholarship has arisen in response to recent examples of violent millennialist movements that have engaged in oft en fatal encounters with government forces—a prominent example here is the bloody clash that took place in Waco, Texas in 1992 between the Branch Davidians and the U.S. government forces of the ATF and the FBI.3 Before considering the primary evidence, we will therefore turn to a brief discussion of this theoretical material.APOCALYPTIC ESCHATOLOGY: TOWARD A NEW THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVECatherine Wessinger is part of a larger group of religious-studies scholars invested in understanding the relationship between millennialism and violence in the con-temporary world.4 To that end her particular interest involves discerning the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"174 Cyril and Jerusalemfactors that determine a millennialist or eschatological community’s transforma-tion from an isolated, withdrawn, and thus incidentally nonviolent community into its opposite, a community engaged in direct violence with its perceived enemy.5 In general she argues that millennial movements emerge in social and religious communities that have already been indoctrinated within an eschatological way of viewing the world. She defi nes two separate states within an overarching eschatol-ogy to describe the shift from passive (peaceful) to active (violent) millennialism: “progressive millenarianism” and “catastrophic millenarianism.”6 Wessinger defi nes these terms as two overarching and interweaving patterns of thought about the Eschaton and salvation that work together shaping a community.In both types (progressive and catastrophic), apocalyptic eschatology is an underlying worldview or weltanschauung that shapes a community’s day-to-day reality. In other words, an end-of-the-world narrative defi nes the contours and content of a community’s linear history and thus that group’s grasp of reality and understanding of their place in their world. Th rough a rich mixture of discourse and a ritual activity that occupies the community over a long period of time, the symbols comprising this worldview become deeply embedded in a community’s religious consciousness.A linear, sacred history frames and defi nes the parameters of a community’s day-to-day life; it defi nes their relationship with the divine as well as their relations with other communities. Into this progress divine forces predictably and regularly intrude for regular ritual celebration and reconfi rmation of the validity and authenticity of their eschatological outlook. In the case of Cyril’s Jerusalemite community, their eschatological worldview provides the impression of a relent-lessly steady, temporal progress to an inevitable end-time period that would be punctuated by the sign (sēmeion) of the cross as well as other indicators of an imminent Eschaton.As Wessinger explains, such an eschatological worldview can exist in a com-munity’s background, enabling a passive rather than an active relationship with this understanding of their history. Progressive millennialism connotes this state: the overarching eschatology recedes to the background to provide only the loosest guide for the community as it moves forward in its linear historical trajectory toward the inevitable end of days. In this way, progressive millennialism desig-nates periods of hopefulness and optimism, when the group itself enjoys harmoni-ous relations with larger social and political orders.On the other hand, the second state—catastrophic millennialism—forefronts an oppressive, pessimistic view of humanity and society in which spiritual warfare overtakes the community, pushing them to or just over the brink into violent encounter—a clash signaling the beginning of the end of days. Th e eschatological worldview or symbolic order features dualistic distinctions such as good versus evil, divine versus demonic. Of particular signifi cance, catastrophic millennialism"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 175retains a dualistic order that carries within it the structural potential for radical transformative agency. In Wessinger’s words:Catastrophic millennialism and progressive millennialism are not mutually exclu-sive. If a group experiences some prosperity, some success at building their millen-nial kingdom, the expectations of catastrophe may wane and progressive expecta-tions come to the fore. But if the group experiences confl ict with “cultural opponents,” if it experiences persecution, then the group may be pushed to exaggerated expecta-tions of catastrophe and a radical dualism that tends toward paranoia.7Wessinger emphasizes that radical dualizing is the main aspect of catastrophic millennialism. Dualistic thinking in its most extreme forms leads to a dehuman-izing and demonizing of those who become identifi ed as the “other.” Should a movement begin to express strong millennial consciousness in an eschatologically inclined community, then, that group would move to adhere to strict boundary marking as it emphasizes the overwhelming corruption and imminent destruction of the world, for instance. More than that, Wessinger explains that such a com-munity moves headlong toward potential violence: “Th is radical dualism expects and oft en produces confl ict. It identifi es particular groups and individuals as ene-mies. It is the embattled worldview of people engaging in warfare.”8 Catastrophic millennialism as a dramatic dualistic eschatology eventually extends to laying claim to tangible enemies. In Christian terms, simply put, by portraying and acting within a scripted/scriptural worldview in which one casts Satan, the antichrist, and their followers as one’s mortal enemies, a potential “antichrist” will eventually come within one’s purview to fi ll the role of the demonic enemy.THE END OF DAYS, THE ANTICHRIST, AND JERUSALEMCyril constructs both the progressive and catastrophic forms of millennialism in various degrees throughout his catechetical lectures, though most prominently in Catech. illum. 13 and 15. In an eff ort to inculcate baptizands in Catech. illum. 13, Cyril craft s an optimistic and hopeful eschatology that wraps tightly around his faith (pistos) in a Christ crucifi ed. He identifi es New Testament passages testifying both to the dominating signifi cance of Christ’s crucifi xion within the Passion and to the redemptive power inherent in that moment and in Christ’s cross. Jerusalem’s bishop commands his baptizands to “preach Christ crucifi ed” throughout the city and insists that they reject anyone who denies the salvifi c power of the crucifi x-ion.9 In support of his claims regarding the power of Christ’s crucifi xion, Cyril ends Catech. illum. 13 with a description of the multiple powers available in Christ’s cross—the sign of the crucifi ed Christ. Th e cross is capable of enslaving the Per-sians, healing diseases, sending demons away, and nullifying the powers of phar-"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"176 Cyril and Jerusalemmakeia and charms.10 Finally, Cyril of Jerusalem proclaims that the sign (sēmeion) of the cross culminates in a much anticipated cosmological sign: the symbol of Christ’s crucifi xion and death will return to indicate His return:But what is the sign (sēmeion) of his coming (parousia)? An opposite power (dyna-mis) may not dare to imitate it [the sign]. [Th e prophets] say that the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the heavenly sky. Th e true sign, Christ’s own, is the cross. A sign of a luminous cross comes before the king, revealing the one who was crucifi ed earlier, in order that the Jews who had abused and plotted against [Christ], seeing [the cross], should beat their breasts tribe by tribe. “Th is is the one who was beaten; this is the one whose face those [Jews] spat upon; this is the one whom [the Jews] secured tightly with bindings [Matt. 24:30].” . . .Th e sign of the cross is a thing of fear to enemies [of Christ], and a thing of joy for friends who have believed (pisteō) in him or who have heralded him or who have suff ered on his behalf.11While Catech. illum. 13 speaks of future possibilities, elsewhere Cyril uses simi-larly hopeful and optimistic terms to describe a cosmological sign that has already taken place. In a letter addressed to Constantius II during the same year as the sign (sēmeion), Cyril writes, “a huge cross made of light appeared in the sky above holy Golgotha extending as far as the holy Mount of Olives.”12 Th is took place on May 7, 351, just a few days before Pentecost.13 He declares that the cross is a favorable sign for the emperor in light of recent troubles with the usurper Magnentius. Cyril’s eschatological maneuvering is hardly surprising in the mid-fourth century—a point in time when, as Oded Irshai shrewdly observes, “Christians [were entering] what one might defi ne as the ‘Hot Time Zone’ of intensifi ed Apocalyptic expecta-tion,” eager to fi nd apocalyptic meaning in every historical event or natural disas-ter, “especially when accompanied by supernatural portents and prodigies.”14 Th e appearance of the cross proves a useful portent at the beginning of Cyril’s vulner-able episcopacy to affi rm Jerusalem’s relationship with the imperial court.15 How-ever, we would be shortsighted to reduce Cyril’s meaning to political strategy. Instead, Cyril moves quickly beyond secular concerns in his optimistic portrait of the sign’s unifying power:[Th e sign] prompted the whole populace at once to run together into the holy church, overcome both with fear and joy at the divine vision. Young and old, men and women of every age, even young girls confi ned to their rooms at home, natives and foreign-ers, Christians and pagans visiting from abroad, all together as if with a single voice raised a hymn of praise to God’s Only-begotten Son, the wonderworker. Th ey had the evidence of their own senses that the holy faith of Christians is based not on the persuasive arguments of philosophy but on the revelation of the Spirit and power; it is proclaimed not by mere human beings but attested from heaven by God himself.16We can see parallels in Cyril’s letter to his community in Catech. illum. 13. Th e sign of the cross functions as a form of undeniable divine testimony. It testifi es to the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 177truth that is Christ crucifi ed, as well as to “God’s Only-begotten Son, the wonder-worker. It testifi es, fi nally, to the superlative power of the Spirit over any words uttered by “mere human beings.”17 Epistula ad Constantius II and Catech. illum. 13 both declare and optimistically promote the sign of the cross in its integral role as a cosmological portent (together with prophetic scripture) for Christianity in Jerusalem.Catech. illum. 15 initially presents the same confi dent and optimistic tone: “We declare not only one coming of Christ, but also a second one, much more glorious than the fi rst. Th e fi rst bears a demonstration of his endurance; the second bears the crown of the Kingdom of God.”18 However, as Cyril continues to proff er details regarding Christ’s return, especially his relaying of the scriptural signs, a growing fear begins to shadow the earlier optimism of Catech. illum.13. Th roughout the lecture Cyril wraps the second coming in imagery from Daniel 7:9–14, especially verse 13: “one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven.”19 Daniel 7:13 also forms the backbone of eschatological theory and imagery in Matthew 24, the other biblical text that Cyril uses to establish his eschatological outlook in this catechetical lecture.20 So then Cyril moves quickly from the hopeful, yet vague, description in Catech. illum. 13 of some future apocalyptic expectation of Christ’s return to a fear of God’s vengeful judgment in Catech. illum. 15. In the latter text, Cyril expresses terrifying urgency and desperation that such judgment is immi-nent. Enhancing the terror are Cyril’s subtle suggestions that he and his commu-nity are witnessing the beginning of the end:“And there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in various places [Matt. 24.7].” Th ese things have already happened. And again, “And terrors from heaven, and great storms [Luke 21.11].” Th e savior says, “And many are scandalized, and others will betray each other, and others still will hate each other [Matt. 24:10].”21Cyril augments the terror by off ering frightening biblical imagery that testifi es to the end of days; he leaves very little to the imagination in speaking of God’s fi nal judgment and punishment. In addition to the descriptions of blood, pain, and agony that he uses to characterize those who will not meet with God’s favor, at this point in the text he introduces deep divisions that demarcate and separate the righteous from the unrighteous, the saved from the punished, the insiders from the outsiders. Cyril follows this immediately with strict orders to his audience, comprised of those preparing for baptism or already baptized. All who are listen-ing must take up a vigilant watch over their immediate environment; they must maintain a constant search for imminent signs of the end.22 Cyril proposes a prac-tice that functions to burn his eschatological worldview into their own perception of the environment. His chilling testimonies from Matthew 24—the signs of the end of days—should sweep through and eventually overtake their imaginations as they scrutinize their surroundings repeatedly day by day. Cyril intends his"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"178 Cyril and Jerusalembaptizands’ perceptual relationship with their environment to change as they con-tinue to progress in their watch. Jerusalem’s surroundings—an area that initially seems simple and straightforward—will with time begin to bend to follow the con-tours of his apocalyptic eschatology. To that end, Cyril devotes several chapters to provide a thorough list of apocalyptic guideposts for the baptized and those pre-paring for baptism:For it is not a history of things that have happened, but a prophecy of things that are to come and will certainly happen. We are not prophets (for we are unworthy), but we bring out before [everyone] what has been written, and we speak about the signs. See what sort of things have already happened, what sort of things still remain.23Cyril names fi ve signs of the end of days; he draws them all from the well-known Matthean passage, and as he progresses in his explanation his outlook continues to darken. Th e fi rst warning (echoing Matt. 24:4–5) serves to advance Cyril’s strategy of deepening the divide between insiders (righteous) and outsiders (unrighteous); he draws upon Jesus’s warning: “Look out so that no one should mislead you. For many will come in my name, declaring, ‘I am Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.”24 Cyril provides a deeper context for this warning; naming Simon Magus and Menander as “ungodly heresiarchs,” he off ers a model of others who had sought to trick Christians in the past.25 Th e devil’s eff orts to trick and confuse true Christians about the right path began soon aft er the resurrection and have contin-ued throughout the centuries; Cyril insists that baptizands should expect other false Christs to arrive in their own age. Whether or not this time was the time of the Eschaton, deceit-driven opponents are certain to arrive.Th e second sign (Matt. 24:7) relates to the occurrence of wars; Cyril claims that the current battles between the Romans and the Persians fulfi ll the prophecy.26 Th e third sign (Matt. 24:7) pertains to the many natural disasters that will occur; Cyril also points to many calamities that have already come to pass.27 Th e fourth sign involves the many who, consumed with hate, will betray each other (Matt. 24:10), and once again Cyril seizes upon this opportunity to gesture toward the dividing lines between true and false Christians, righteous and unrighteous, insiders and outsiders. Beyond establishing such divisions, Cyril declares that the simple fact of confl ict and contestation indicates the beginning of the end. In the increasing vis-ibility of ecclesiastical hostilities Cyril can easily claim a potentially violent sign of the end of days: “If you should hear that there have been bishops against bishops, clergy against clergy, people against people until blood is drawn, do not be dis-turbed. For it has been prophesied. Do not carefully attend to the things that are happening, but that they have been written.”28 Th e fi ft h sign (Matt. 24:14) pertains to the universal reach of the Christian message; throughout his lectures Cyril men-tions the great number of populations who have converted to Christianity. In Catech. illum. 16.22, for example, Cyril claims that all of Palestine and the Roman"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 179Empire have been fi lled with Christians; there are large Christian populations among the Indians, Goths, Samaritans, Moors, Libyans, and Ethiopians as well. Of these fi ve signs, Cyril places heavy emphasis on the appearance of false messiahs and prophets who will fl ood Jerusalem seeking to seduce the elect. Th is, together with the fourth sign—an upsurge in polarizing ecclesiastical hostility—reveals Cyril’s dedication to imposing deep divisions among the population. As we know, this is a key factor in catastrophic millennialism.In Catech. illum. 15, Cyril utterly abandons the all-embracing, optimistic imagery of Catech. illum. 13 and instead turns to describe the period of tribulation (thlipsis).29 If this time is at hand—the era of pain and torment before Christ’s return—then the baptized must learn to recognize Satan himself and the antichrist in Jerusalem. Once again, in the ongoing search for (and possible identifi cation of ) these two enemies, baptizands perform and make real the divide that Cyril describes: as baptizands continue to look for any who might seek to mislead them, they engage in a practice that cleaves their surrounding population in two, each baptizand marking diff erentiations and diff erences that organize and substantiate the divine versus demonic, righteous versus unrighteous, honest versus deceitful. Th eir repetitious act of judging produces a series of dualities that organize popula-tions both local and translocal—all of which map onto a primary division of Self versus Other. With this in mind, it is signifi cant that Cyril admonishes the bap-tized to keep watch for deceitful enemies of Christ who are fl ooding Jerusalem and his congregation right now; many people will claim to be Christ or to know the true Christ.30 Th ese men and women will fervently proselytize strangers as well as friends and family. People must labor to select trustworthy companions from among those who stand in exact agreement with the true Creed. Cyril counsels that the slightest divergence from the doctrine that he teaches could prove fatal; Satan can take advantage of the smallest creedal infraction. Using his “signs and lying wonders,” the devil can transform a momentary lapse into incendiary her-esy.31 Heretical manifestations, once reserved for the easily identifi able terrain of distant ecclesiastical squabbles or even the outer streets of Jerusalem, have moved closer to home; a neighbor, a close friend, or a fellow congregant can be the perfect vessel for the injection of deleterious poison into the belly of the Jerusalemite church:While earlier the heretics were apparent, now the church is fi lled with hidden here-tics. And so people are standing apart from the truth and are itching in their hearing. Is this speech persuasive? Everyone listens to it happily. Does the speech lead any turning around? All are turning away. Many have moved away from orthodox words. Rather, they choose the evil instead of preferring the good. Th e apostasy is here, and the enemy will be expected.

Th e church now charges you before the"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"180 Cyril and Jerusalemliving God; before this happens, the church informs you concerning the plans of the antichrist. If this will happen to you during your lifetime, we do not know. But it is good to be informed of these things beforehand.32Eschatological urgency forces Cyril to counsel in this manner. Heretics are waiting for the proper moment to infect the entire community; they might even now be hidden among the congregants within the church and their community. Th e problem, of course, is that the enemy now knows how to disguise himself or herself. We can imagine the force of Cyril’s words, compelling listeners to look nervously at those standing next to them as Cyril asks, “Do not lips frequently kiss, and the face smiles, and the eyes reveal their joy, while the heart is plotting guile, and the man is getting ready to let out evil words?”33 As Cyril explains, if a congre-gant naively trusts such a person and chooses to bring the person into the fold, the congregant’s actions could undermine the Christian pistis that the entire Jerusale-mite community has labored assiduously to build. With Christ’s return likely to happen any time, the community must forge a tight protective net around itself to defend against such threats. Until Christ’s return they must maintain and enforce a clear boundary to protect insiders from predatory outsiders; when Christ fi nally does arrive, he will come to judge everyone, rewarding the righteous and punish-ing the unrighteous.In drawing a strict boundary between insiders and outsiders, Cyril encourages a self-policing environment that is similar to John Chrysostom’s eff orts in his Adversus Judaeos homilies. Like Chrysostom, in constructing frightening portraits of the harbingers of the Eschaton that echo 1 John’s warnings of false messiahs, false Christs, and the antichrist, Cyril surrounds his baptizands with harrowing images that establish the need to defend congregational borders. Yet this imagery could easily also slip into the promotion of active violence against anyone he iden-tifi es as the enemy. As discussed above, Catherine Wessinger argues that radical dualization is one of the primary attributes of catastrophic millennialism. By organizing populations into a dichotomous organization that does not defi ne merely diff erence or distance but rather confl ict and contestation, Cyril situates his baptizands in a frangible relation with the outside world. A small, even negligible, catalyst is all that Cyril’s baptizands require to move from a tentative détente to active violence.What might explain the sudden intensifi cation of Cyril’s eschatological outlook in Catech. illum. 15? How might his escalation from progressive millennialism in Catech. illum. 13 to catastrophic millennialism in Catech. illum. 15 aff ect the day-to-day social dynamics of the community? How can we account for Cyril’s intro-duction of such a sharp apocalyptic eschatology into the intimacy of the baptizand community—especially an eschatology that could inevitably produce a hostile, defensive view toward outsiders? In his other lectures, Cyril declares his fi rm belief"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 181that Jerusalem will be the location of Christ’s return; he describes the city’s emi-nence and presents its role in the Eschaton as a duty of the Jerusalemite see. Only here in Catech. illum. 15, however, does Cyril actually write of the age immediately preceding Christ’s return. Here he succumbs to a fear-driven urgency; he writes of a darkened era that will rip through and potentially destroy the Holy City before Christ returns to bring salvation to its elect. Moreover, he warns that if his audi-ence is not careful there will be a period of time in which the antichrist will arrive and infect the Jerusalemite community.Th e eschatological diff erence between Catech. illum. 15 and the rest of the cat-echetical lectures (especially the entirety of Catech. illum. 13) is palpable. In this lecture, imminent feelings of persecution have emboldened Cyril to issue urgent warnings that expose a dualistic structure of insiders versus outsiders; he also warns of a confl ict with powerful and demonic enemies that may already be under way. Apocalyptic eschatology weighs much more heavily in Catech. illum. 15 also: as the bright, optimistic images of the end of days that he has earlier portrayed darken signifi cantly, he dwells far less on the joy of Christ’s return. He fi xates instead on the terror and anxiety associated with the preceding age of judgment and punishment. Moreover, a thick, suff ocating pessimism enters Cyril’s imagery to help carve a sharp and unrelenting divide between Self and Other. What, if anything, might account for the shift ?Robert D. Baird uses the term “ultimate concern” in his defi nition of religion: religion as ultimate concern defi nes the goal, drive, or principle that is more impor-tant than all else in the universe to a particular person or group.34 In speaking of the violent drive behind millennial groups, Wessinger borrows the phrase. Cata-strophic millennial groups can continue their stubbornly vague prognostications of tribulation and end time as long as the community and its leaders do not encounter confl ict with cultural opponents, what Wessinger describes as “repeated disconfi rmation.”35 In other words, in a situation where a group feels despair about meeting the ultimate goal, continued persecution or obstacles will not lead to the group’s abandoning the ultimate concern. Rather, such persecution or obstacles embolden the “millennial group’s dualism and perception of being locked in a confl ict with powerful and demonic enemies.”36 Wessinger explains:If the group members are pushed to the point of despair about the success of their goal they will not abandon their ultimate concern but instead they will be motivated to take desperate actions to preserve it. A catastrophic millennial group that feels it is persecuted may bring the date for the end closer. Such groups make adjustments in their theologies and actions in response to events. Factors internal to the group, such as having an already endangered ultimate concern, possessing a radical dualis-tic worldview and hiding criminal secrets, can make members of a catastrophic mil-lennial group extremely sensitive, so that even minimal cultural opposition will be viewed as persecution.37"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"182 Cyril and JerusalemWessinger’s use of the concept of ultimate concern off ers a persuasive means of understanding the drastic change in Cyril’s apocalyptic eschatology in Catech. illum. 15. What remains is to uncover the catalyst for such a shift . What within Cyril’s life could have the requisite gravity to account for the darkening shift in his eschato-logical outlook? What helps to explain Cyril’s sudden, ultimately protective, dualis-tic expressions: e.g., insider versus outsider, spiritual versus demonic (or demon-driven), righteous versus unrighteous? In what follows we will consider the potential likelihood that Cyril’s repeated exiles might explain the changes in Catech. illum. 15.A BISHOP OF MANY EXILESCyril comes to the episcopal see under the patronage of Acacius probably in 350, indeed perhaps as late as the early months of 351, according to Jan Willem Drij-vers.38 Th is is not the place to discuss in detail the controversies surrounding Cyril’s election as bishop; it must suffi ce to say that any good relations that may have existed between Acacius and Cyril in the earliest period of Cyril’s episcopacy disintegrate very quickly as the latter’s ambitions for Jerusalem become clear. Acacius soon begins looking for a way to retake control of the see. Th e Caesarean does not have to look for long.In 354 or 355 Jerusalem and the surrounding area are suff ering horribly from famine, which induces the poor to beg Cyril for relief. According to textual evi-dence, in order to purchase food for those suff ering from the famine the naive bishop sells a robe given by Constantine to Macarius; the emperor’s gift to the church is later recognized when it is worn by a stage performer. Th is provides the pretext for Acacius and his episcopal entourage to depose Aelia’s young bishop, probably around 357.39 For two years Cyril refuses to appear before a synod of Pal-estinian bishops tasked with determining his guilt or innocence in the matter of inappropriately selling church property. Eventually he is deposed in absentia, and Eutychius of Eleutheropolis takes over his episcopal role.While living under the protection of Silvanus in Tarsus in the aft ermath, Cyril appeals to Constantius II for a hearing under a secular judge for the injustices he has suff ered. In September 359 he is fi nally heard during a meeting in Seleucia. Th e synod, which is to discuss doctrinal matters as well as irregularities in the cases of other deposed bishops, proves to be a surprisingly ideal arrangement for Cyril. In his association with Silvanus, Cyril fi nds himself part of a new network of like-minded homoiousians now located outside of Palestine. When the Acacian party is deposed and excommunicated temporarily, Cyril is reinstalled without opposi-tion or further delay and manages to enjoy a very brief respite as Jerusalem’s bishop—until further complications arise.40Acacius travels directly to Constantius II to relay the story of Cyril’s alleged role in selling church property. Th at, of course, is all that is required: an order for exile"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 183is issued by the emperor himself. Before Cyril has a chance to settle in at home, he is deposed once again by the Council of Constantinople in 360.41 Th is exile does not last long, however. Constantius’s death brings Julian to the throne for a reign that will wreak havoc on the entire church. Initially, it proves a favorable omen for our troubled bishop. Despite spending more of the previous decade outside Jeru-salem than in it, Cyril returns in 361 to fi nd a loyal community. According to Drij-vers, “Cyril was popular with the people of Jerusalem since Irenaeus seems to have given over his see to Cyril without the slightest resistance”; they provide a “sound powerbase” in Cyril’s bishopric as he then turns to the task of building Jerusalem’s position.42Intriguing possibilities emerge if we consider that Catech. illum. 15 may have been delivered aft er Cyril’s return in either 359 or 361. Whether we are dealing with two or four years in exile, Cyril has had time to grow in his wariness of the episco-pal authority in Caesarea and the amount of infl uence Acacius has managed to establish over the Jerusalem community. Which clergy (priests, exorcists, and dea-cons) now serve as Acacian proxies in Cyril’s ecclesiastical organization? Can Cyril be sure that all within his community are in sync with his view of Christian iden-tity in the Holy City of Jerusalem? Although Drijvers leans toward the proposal that all the lectures date from the same year, he does not rule out the possibility they are delivered year to year and thus bear the mark of modifi cation and updat-ing. In fact, the lectures are recorded in shorthand as they are delivered, according to manuscript notes; the manuscript instructions indicate that Cyril relies on an ex tempore presentation style. Some have suggested that the lectures may not have been published until the late fourth century and therefore that the catechetical lectures, are not a fi xed, closed text until that point. Th is reading of the textual construction of Cyril’s lectures opens up a number of possibilities as we begin to examine the development of Jerusalem-based apocalyptic eschatology in his worldview. Th us both possibilities are plausible: either Catech. illum. 15 bears opti-mistic eschatological content (a form of progressive millenniallism) when it is delivered originally with the rest of the lectures in 350 and then upon his return from exile(s) Cyril redacts it (i.e., intensifying the eschatology from progressive to catastrophic), or Catech. illum. 15, as an entirely new composition aft er his exile, wholly refl ects Cyril’s caution regarding the welfare of his community, so long under Acacian control.In what follows, we will consider the latter possibility: that Cyril delivers Catech. illum. 15 soon aft er he returns from either his fi rst exile in 359 or his second exile in 361. Th us Cyril’s concern that another episcopal power has inserted himself (or themselves) deeply into his Jerusalemite community during his absence initiates the shift to catastrophic millennialism in his thinking. In response, Cyril devises a means of regaining control over his community through a series of steps that he discusses in this catechesis. First and foremost, and what we have already"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"184 Cyril and Jerusalemdiscussed, he creates radical dualizing imagery to provide baptizands and baptized with a means of imposing a clarifying order upon the congregation, the wider local population of Jerusalem, and the even more expansive translocal population of the empire; he arranges people strictly in terms of the following coordinating dichotomies: the righteous versus the unrighteous, the orthodox ver-sus the heterodox, the divine versus the demonic, the insider versus the outsider, and the self versus the other. Naming the dualisms is an essential fi rst step. How-ever, Cyril moves quickly beyond this to underscore the dire nature of their situa-tion: not only is the end of days imminent, perhaps already underway but a har-rowing diabolism attached to that period is certainly now falling upon them. Cyril allows the prophetic voice from 2 Th essalonians 2:3–10 to speak directly to his audience:Th en if any man will say you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Lo, there; believe it not. Hatred of the brethren makes room next for the Antichrist; for the devil prepares beforehand the divisions among the people, that he who is to come may be accept-able to them. But God forbid that any of Christ’s servants here, or elsewhere, should run over to the enemy! Writing concerning this matter, the Apostle Paul gave a man-ifest sign, saying, For that day shall not come, except there comes fi rst the apostasy, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. Do you not remember that when I was yet with you, I told you these things? And now you know that which restrains, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. For the mystery of iniquity does already work, only there is one that restrains now, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming, even him, whose com-ing is aft er the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that are perishing.43Th ough Cyril does not declare unequivocally that they have entered into the fi nal days, 2 Th essalonians 2–10 frames their predicament in such a manner that bapti-zands now totter on a precipice between ecclesiastical strife indicative of normal linear time, although heightened and dangerous, and the eschatological era of tribulation (thlipsis).44Tribulationist eschatology is an eff ective means of building invisible but impen-etrable walls around a religious community; it separates congregants from the out-side world while insulating a leader’s own link to his followers. It is also an eff ective means of diverting attention from one’s shortcomings—a point we will return to below. Logic suggests that the more elaborate and frightening the antichrist (or antichrists) in the rhetoric, the more threatening the external competition in actu-ality. Th e tribulationist rallying cry to split the world into the simplistic structure of right and wrong, divine and demonic, and insiders and outsiders only grows"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 185louder and more insistent as the threat of ecclesiastical (or in Cyril’s case episco-pal) competition intensifi es. Th e potential danger of tribulation helps to under-score the importance for the baptized, as apocalyptic seers, to go beyond an initial acknowledgement of dividing dualisms; they must further engage in the practice of spiritual discernment—testing the spiritual nature of individuals whom they may suspect within the congregation. Th eir mission to discern deceitful, wretched spirits is imperative. Cyril implicitly gestures toward 1 John 4—a text that instructs listeners to test other members of the community:Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits (dokimazete ta pneumata) to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets (pseudoprophētai) have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the fl esh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming; and now it is already in the world.45Cyril’s repeated references to deceitful and errant spirits hidden within the com-munity suggest a dependence upon this passage. In Catech. illum. 4, similarly, Cyril warns of the coming of Satan, intent on deceit by appearing as an angel of light; he also frets about the coming of the antichrist, who wishes to lead astray those within the community searching for Christ. Consequently, Cyril directs his audience to see Christ with the eyes of their mind and hear Christ’s living words from scripture: “Be careful that no one deceives you” (Mark 13:5; Matt. 24:4); he repeats this command of Christ three times before adding the accompanying scriptural words: “For there will be many in My name, saying, ‘I am Christ,’ and will mislead many.”46 As he makes quite clear, these are not simply words recorded in the gospels, but prophecy. In the end of Catech. illum. 4, Cyril directs his bapti-zands to determine which parts of this prophecy have already occurred: in other words, how many deceivers have managed to enter the congregation in Jerusalem, claiming to be members and in the process transforming the spirit of Jerusalem’s church? In Christ’s command that listeners protect themselves against deceit, we may presume Cyril’s direction to listeners that they must test the spirits of those whom they encounter. A person’s true intentions and motivations—the spirit of the mind—are invisible; in Cyril’s admonishing words: “Do not lips frequently kiss, and the face smiles, and the eyes reveal their joy, while the heart is plotting guile, and the man is getting ready to let out evil words?”47 Th erefore, those in allegiance with Satan and the antichrist are able to deceive true Christians all too oft en. It is incumbent upon those preparing to assume the enveloping power of the Holy Spirit to fi ght back by uncovering or revealing those amid their numbers who attempt to hide a deceptive spirit.Cyril redoubles the urgency of their situation in his description of what he sus-pects is happening at this time: that many have departed from the true path as the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"186 Cyril and Jerusalemtime of the apostasy draws closer. In other words, large groups of individuals have already strayed from the true message of Christ: “Before, the heretics were appar-ent; but now the church is fi lled with hidden heretics.”48 Th is state of aff airs increases the need for the baptizands to protect themselves, and to do so they need to know the true intentions of those surrounding them—in other words, those listening to Cyril need to learn how to discern the interior spirits (i.e., theological allegiance) of others. In light of this situation, Cyril insists that baptizands must determine the extent to which Satan’s and the antichrist’s scourge of deceit has infi ltrated the community.Th e text of 1 John provides the basic foundation and principles for testing spir-its, and Cyril certainly has this text in mind. Th at said, Cyril draws upon a wide spectrum of similar early Christian literature to provide further guidance in devel-oping his eschatological imagery, radical dualizing language, and mandate for test-ing spirits. For example, the Didache warns against wandering false prophets who seek to deceive a Christian community. To avoid this danger, a community must limit a prophet’s visit to two days; if he requests three, he is assuredly a false prophet who does not “speak in the spirit” but, instead, desires to establish a subversive foothold in the community.49 Intriguingly, the theme of testing is present in the Didache also—for those prophets “who speak in the Spirit” are to be neither tried nor judged. Th e author of the Shepherd of Hermas refl ects the same dualistic struc-ture in terms of a prophet’s indwelling spirit—though there are far more details constructing the cleavage between the two.50 Th ere, too, the text discusses the necessity that Christians practice the testing of spirits. Th e false prophet, fi lled with the devil’s earthly spirit, lies under a beguiling veneer of Christian truth. Discerning a prophet’s cosmic patronage is not possible with reference to the message alone. A prophet’s true character is detectable in his behavior. Th e divine prophet is humble, quiet, meek (praus esti kai hēsychios kai tapeinophrōn); he speaks only when the Holy Spirit moves him. By contrast, the false prophet speaks in opposite terms “because of a spirit foolish and empty” (peri tou pneuma-tos tou epigeiou kai kenou). Th ough his words are empty for the most part, a false prophet does manage a modicum of veracity: “For the devil fi lls him with his own spirit (ho gar diabolos plēroi auton tōi autou pneumati), so that he might be able to shatter those who are just.” Th e one who is “possessed by an earthly spirit” (eigeion esti to pneuma) can gain command only over those who are doubtful in their faith. Such a false prophet (ton prophētēn . . . ton pseudoprophētēn) has absolutely no power to convince or sway someone fi rm in his faith—someone who is, therefore, in alliance with the Holy Spirit. In this view, only prophets speak Christ’s truth; the rest are the devil’s henchmen, and exceedingly vulnerable when matched in debate with a true prophet. In fact, false prophets’ encounters with the prophets of the Holy Spirit frequently prove disastrous for the former:"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 187When, therefore, [the Devil’s spirit] comes into an assembly of righteous men who have a Spirit of Divinity, and they off er up prayer, that man is made empty, and the earthly spirit fl ees from him through fear, and that man is made dumb, and is entirely crushed, being unable to speak. For if you pack closely a storehouse with wine or oil, and put an empty jar in the midst of the vessels of wine or oil, you will fi nd that jar empty as when you placed it, if you should wish to clear the storehouse. So also the empty prophets, when they come to the spirits of the righteous, are found [on leav-ing] to be such as they were when they came.Th e Shepherd of Hermas is thus similar to Cyril’s dogmatic presentation of the utter incompatibility between Spirit-endowed Christians and the demonic adher-ents of heresy, as well as any who follow the antichrist, and the need to stave off the infl uence of the antichrist by testing. In Catech. illum. 15, Cyril is inculcating bap-tizands in the basics of an important skill that they are able to perfect aft er baptism endows them with the Holy Spirit: the baptized Christian should be able to discern the spiritual nature of a person and act accordingly. Should a diabolic opponent come among Cyril’s community and attempt to deceive, as an apocalyptic seer the baptized Christian will be able to see through to and reveal that person’s true spir-itual nature.Cyril’s insistence that people identify Satan’s and the antichrist’s heretics serves to strengthen the boundaries of the community; however, there is more that lurks within Cyril’s feverish insistence that baptizands test the spirits of those around them in an eff ort to prepare for the antichrist’s arrival. Abraham Malherbe has argued that when a leader’s hold over his community is fragile, tirades detailing the antichrist’s imminent arrival eff ectively defl ect attention from that fragility.51 Th us warnings of false prophets and false Christs such as we see in 1 John indicate a leader’s fear of the competition. Following Malherbe’s logic, Cyril’s emphatic apocalyptic eschatology in Catech. illum. 15 points directly to his own concerns involving rival bishops and episcopal appointees. Both Cyril and the author of 1 John are fi ghting for authoritative control over their respective communities rather than seeking freedom from political or religious oppression. Moreover, Malherbe observes that by suddenly directing the audience’s attention to heaven and hell or, in these cases, the Eschaton, a leader such as Cyril easily situates religious and political competition within a larger cosmological framework that promotes the greater spiritual struggle for eternal salvation; so too that leader distracts from any political competition by foregrounding a catastrophic millennialism that pro-motes the need to test spirits. A fi gure like Cyril thus uses fear of the antichrist to divert attention from his ecclesiastical insecurity. If we cast our minds back to the time of Cyril’s return to his community, it is not too diffi cult to imagine his rising concern in the face of a community he no longer recognizes. Does he, for example, sense a congregation riven by theological confl ict thanks to Acacius’s infl uence?"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"188 Cyril and JerusalemWhile responses to many such questions will forever reside beyond our grasp, reading Catech. illum. 15 in light of Catherine Wessinger’s concept of “catastrophic millennialism” off ers speculative answers that tease the edges of plausibility. How-ever, in light of the interpolations in Cyril’s text, there are other possible targets—that is, potential antichrist identities—that we will now consider.THE AFTERMATH: JULIAN AND THE TEMPLEAs discussed above, in Catech. illum. 15 Cyril declares categorical, infl exible divi-sions between the righteous and the unrighteous, which the fi nal days of trial will delineate. Moreover, there will be much to judge. Sin has inundated the world with theft and corruption, contaminating the earth.52 Every deed of man has been recorded; and just as there will be unending reward, there will also be unending punishment. Implicit in Cyril’s message is that divisions between the righteous and unrighteous will become clear early on in the Holy City. In Jerusalem, above all the places on earth, judgments must be settled before Christ’s glorious return. Most importantly, then, it is imperative that baptized Christians in Jerusalem who possess spiritual power discern in whom evil or divinity resides.Jerusalemite Christians can also expect an era of the antichrist to precede Christ’s return. Th e enemy of Christ will have a very specifi c goal in mind: that he is able to deceive those preparing for baptism. A baptized Christian must be on his or her guard, cautious in every interaction. Already they all are in the age of frac-tious plots and deceit. As mentioned above, they have entered the age when “Satan transform[s] himself into an angel of light” to deceive the most devout.53 Th e anti-christ’s time of arrival is unknown, and in fact it may have already occurred. In Cyril’s opinion, current events are exhibiting unsettling signs.54 Accordingly, the candidates must wait with a watchful eye.Cyril’s apocalyptic eschatology redefi nes his baptizands as a tightly knit group destined to stand against an inevitable antagonist. Cyril, however, is also precise when describing where one should expect to encounter Christ’s enemies, as we have discussed above; hostile outsiders—demon-infl uenced imposters—will insin-uate themselves within the Jerusalemite community. Perhaps this is already the case. Th erefore the baptized members of Cyril’s congregation (and those preparing for baptism) must be ready. If the present age proves to be the appointed time for the antichrist’s reign of terror, they have to be on their guard, forever vigilant, searching for signs of the antichrist: the arrival of false messiahs and false Christs; a rise in heresy; a sudden upsurge in war, earthquakes, and earth-shattering storms. As baptized Christian soldiers—endowed with the Holy Spirit—they are the natu-ral elect to discern these signs as something more than the natural fl ow of history; they should be able to recognize an anomalous current conveying a greater mes-"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 189sage. Cyril is determined that the strongest and most courageous of the baptizands and baptized be prepared.In this manner Cyril’s congregation will create a solid and sealed community of insiders who stand in united stance against a darkened, demonic world of outsid-ers. As baptizands and the baptized engage in strategies of discernment, practicing mutual suspicion, a much darker world—and with much more at stake—slowly reveals itself. Catech. illum. 15 features Cyril’s conceptualization of that part of the end of days known as the period of tribulation (thlipsis), as described in Matthew 24. He warns of a stint of terror, pain, and unimaginable suff ering, all serving to usher in the arrival of Satan’s own, the antichrist (1 Th ess. 2 and 1 John). Wessinger would identify this abrupt shift in Catech. illum. 15 as the beginning of catastrophic millennialism.Th e question fi nally arises, Could Cyril’s congregation—a community affi xed to a state of catastrophic millennialism—engage in physical violence? How easily might Cyril’s community—conceivably ritually shaped and inculcated in such a worldview—succumb to violence? What set of circumstances might serve to ignite his Christians’ aggression—especially in the context of interreligious confl ict? Wessinger would respond that violence or violent action of some kind is a plausi-ble reaction on the part of Cyril’s congregation, especially if provoked. In what follows, we turn to a period of extreme and sudden confl ict for Cyril’s community: Julian’s introduction of a plan to rebuild the temple of the Jews. We will review certain pieces of evidence to determine if Cyril’s extreme tribulationist eschatol-ogy at the time may have led to interreligious violence in Jerusalem.VIOLENCE IN JERUSALEM: IN THE HEAT OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE?Oded Irshai has suggested that chapters 11–17 of Catech. illum. 15 are a wholesale interpolation that speaks directly to Julian’s failed attempt to rebuild the temple.55 Most disturbingly, these chapters place an antichrist directly in the Jewish temple. To be clear, this is not the ambiguous, somewhat blurred antichrist we are accus-tomed to see in New Testament literature. Cyril describes the antichrist in explicit terms that remind the audience of Julian’s interest in Neoplatonic theurgy—or the more pejorative way of referring to his religio-ritual practice, i.e., magika:In the beginning, as though someone learned and cultured, he pretended to be both moderate and kind. By deceiving the Jews as the Christ they have been waiting for through signs and the false wonders of deceptive magic; [the enemy] will be subse-quently marked by all the wicked deeds, desolate and transgressive; aft er conquering all of the unjust and transgressive who are before him, he bears a murderous, relentless, unmerciful, mottled thought against everyone, but most especially us Christians.56"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"190 Cyril and JerusalemWe agree with Irshai’s overall argument: that chapters 11–17 refl ect with unmis-takable detail events related to Julian’s failed plans to rebuild the temple as well as character traits tied to the emperor himself. Nevertheless, our reading moves in a slightly diff erent direction than Irshai’s interolation theory. We propose that Cyril redacts only certain portions of the fi ft eenth catechesis, specifi cally those passages that dwell upon the character and purpose of the antichrist. Th erefore, Cyril is only sharpening the lines of an already existing pessimism; in this way, he sharp-ens the divide between insiders and outsiders in their inculcation not only of Christian identity but also religious positionality in relation to the various kinds of non-Christians in Jerusalem.Let us fi rst take a closer look at chapters 11–17 in the context of the lecture as a whole. Irshai views chapters 11–17 as a discrete unit that comprises a wholesale interpolation into Catech. illum. 15—which as far as we can determine was com-posed at the same time as the rest of the catecheses, in Irshai’s view. Th e majority of these chapters paint a portrait of the antichrist in Julianic hues. Oded Irshai cap-tures the purpose and eff ect of Cyril’s condemning characterization quite well.57Th ere is no doubt that Cyril molds the antichrist in chapters 11–17 aft er the way-ward emperor. However, while Irshai is correct in this matter, we would also point out that we encounter the antichrist much earlier in chapters 4 and 9 and also later in chapter 21. Th erefore the antichrist passages, which provide an essential founda-tion to tribulationist theology and cosmology in the Christian church, extend beyond the chapters relating specifi cally to Julian. Furthermore, while the word tribulation is mentioned in chapter 16—one of the chapters Oded Irshai men-tions—this event is the fi ft h in the series of Matthean end-of-days signs that spans almost the entire length of the lecture.58 Rather than wholesale interpolation, then, I propose that Cyril intensifi es and personalizes tribulationist/antichristic passages that already stand within the text. Cyril’s additions serve to increase the Julianic character of the antichrist as well as tie the antichrist’s actions to the specifi c eff orts of Julian to build the temple.Finally, then, when are these changes added? Irshai is surely correct that Cyril adds chapters 11–17 a year or more aft er the event. In Irshai’s words, “Cyril’s Anti-christ is a Roman king who usurped the throne. He is a Homo Magicus, a person initiated into magic practices, thus echoing Julian’s active participation in magical practices, which was part of the cultus deorum in his brand of the Neoplatonic cult.”59 Irshai suggests that this section, as a vaticinium ex eventu, is inserted into the lecture a year aft er the events surrounding the temple, adding that “Cyril’s eschatological proof shift ed the polemics with Judaism from the past to the future, from history to eschatology, and gave the Christians of Jerusalem a new and deeper sense to their mission.”60In fact, upon hearing and fearing Julian’s plan Cyril undoubtedly touches upon the topic in some manner. In his position as Jerusalem’s and the Holy Sepulchre’s"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 191bishop he is obligated to respond. Furthermore, if we accept that Cyril has already been preaching in the more extreme tribulationist worldview of Catech. illum. 15 since his return from exile, the pessimist worldview has been a part of the com-munity’s literature and baptismal cycle for quite some time. It is not beyond the pale that such a worldview would easily induce Cyril to speak of Julian in espe-cially harsh terms. In light of this reading, then, Catech. illum.15 may represent a steady intensifi cation of a pessimistic eschatology—one in which tribulationist cosmology and theology progressively move from a discussion of imminent future probability (aft er Cyril’s return from exile) to present eschatological reality (in response to Julian’s plans).Wessinger’s model suggests that violence on the part of Cyril and his commu-nity would be a more probable outcome than tolerance during these tense few months in Jerusalem. It would take very little to push Cyril over the precipice and into a headlong fall into some kind of aggressive action. In fact, we do have a rather large, unavoidable sign catapulting all the actors in Jerusalem onto a much larger cosmological stage: an earthquake in May 363 that puts a decisive stop to all of Julian’s plans for rebuilding the Jerusalem temple.In the autumn of 362, Julian decides to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. In the early months of 363, preparations are begun under the supervision of Alypius of Antioch, who formerly served as vice-prefect for Britain.61 Th e project comes to an abrupt end because of earthquakes that hit the entire region, aft er which construc-tion is never resumed. Th e existing record of events presents a far more dramatic account, however. Ammianus Marcellinus describes “terrifying balls of fl ame [that] kept bursting forth near the foundations of the temple, and made the place inaccessible to the workmen, some of whom were burned to death.”62 Christian authors are even more creative, particularly in their anti-Judaizing portrayal of events. Gregory of Nazianzus is especially abrasive in his characterization of Christian-hating Jews who had immediately followed Julian’s orders, their women selling their own jewelry to further construction. Gregory describes the torrential storms and trembling earth that terrorize Jewish workers who seek refuge in the churches in Jerusalem, while “the doors remained closed as though some kind of invisible power had barred their opening.”63 Ephrem the Syrian explains that the Christians had prayed to God to stop the temple project, and God complies by sending earthquakes, storms, and thunderbolts; a fi re breaks out at the temple foundations; many Jews are burned; and the clothes of many more are branded with the sign of a cross, which also appears in the sky above the city.64But what of Cyril’s own reaction to these events? As we have already discussed, Catech. illum. 15.11–17 stands as evidence that he does manage some form of reac-tion. Cyril casts Julian in the role of the antichrist, a role the apostate emperor is well suited to play. Th e redacted chapters blend well with the lecture as a whole and with other places where Cyril develops a construction of the antichrist in close"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"192 Cyril and Jerusalemreference to the New Testament. Up to this moment in time, according to Cyril, Satan has maneuvered more subtly, though ineff ectually, through Simon Magus, Marcion, Valentinus, Mani, and their heretical descendants. At this point, how-ever, Satan has realized that his own punishment will no longer be delayed; conse-quently, he will “no longer fi ght war through his ministers in the traditional way, but in person.”65 Th e antichrist will be Satan’s chosen means of destroying Christ’s elect. Th e antichrist will deploy every deceit and illusion that can possibly sway and corrupt Jews; inevitably he will take aim at Christians themselves.At fi rst, posing as a learned and prudent man, he will pretend to be moderate and benevolent; he will take in the Jews as their hoped-for Messiah by deceitful signs and wonders of his magical craft . Aft erwards he will be so marked by the variety of his cruel and lawless crimes as to surpass all the workers against all men, but especially against us Christians.66In these few passages Cyril describes with fastidious detail the antichrist’s stint in Jerusalem. He will call himself Christ to seduce the Jews. He will trick people into believing he can raise the dead, heal the lame, and give sight to the blind.67 His magical illusions will delude the Jews into accepting him as their messiah. Satan’s last dragon will make his appearance in Jerusalem. Drawing again on the mention of the temple of God in 2 Th essalonians 2:4, which he mentions in Catech. illum. 15.9, Cyril describes how the antichrist will exploit and defi le Judaism with his arrival:[He will give] the suspicious impression that [the enemy] is the one born from the Davidic line who will rebuild the Solomonic temple. But then the antichrist arrives when in the temple of the Jews, not stone on top of a stone should remain according to the declaration of the savior. For when the decay of time or demolition with a view to rebuilding, or other causes, have overthrown all the stones of both the outer circuit and the inner shrine of the cherubim, the antichrist will appear amid all signs and lying wonders.68Surprisingly, to date only a few scholars besides Irshai have recognized that these passages are a later interpolation refl ecting the crisis in 363. And only Irshai has considered the purpose or function of casting both Julian and Jews in an apocalyp-tic framework; more importantly, he is also the only scholar who has drawn atten-tion to the strong anti-Judaizing tone of the passages.What purpose does Cyril’s antichrist serve, especially one allied tightly with Jerusalem’s Jewish community? How does his Christian Jerusalemite audience react to what he unveils for them in chapters 11–17? To answer these questions, we fi rst have to understand what exactly he is attempting to convey with his sharp and vivid images of an antichrist who is enthralling Jews on the Temple Mount in 363. Does he project frightful images of the antichrist to generate some kind of near-"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Apocalyptic Prophets and the Cross 193miss catharsis in the aft ermath of Julian’s disaster, as Irshai seems to suggest as one possibility? Can we then imagine a communal sigh of relief for a Jewish temple that has once again failed to rise on the long-barren Temple Mount?69 More to the point, can we imagine Jerusalemite Christians content with mere condemnation of the enemy (i.e., Jews) when they have been living so near the moment of Christ’s return for perhaps the past two years? Perhaps they allow the recent past to arrange their imminent eschatological future as one of Christ’s return, another possibility also suggested by Irshai? Or is something else happening in these passages? Th ese passages portray Julian in an extravagantly mythologized guise and position him in an awkwardly stretched cosmogony. Is Cyril expending such discursive labor to craft an emperor as the antichrist par excellence simply to subordinate the events of the recent past to possibilities of an unwritten future? What exactly happened in that past? Can this also be a project involving the rewriting of that past as well?A Syriac manuscript known as Harvard Syriac 99, discovered in the 1970s, con-tains a letter ascribed to Cyril.70 Th e letter is dated with a particular date—May 19, 363—and the author claims to be a witness off ering an account of Julian’s failed Jerusalem temple project. From the moment of its discovery this text has sparked complicated debates regarding authorship, manuscript tradition, and so forth; as a result it has remained on the sidelines in scholarship dealing with the Temple Mount, Cyril’s episcopacy, Julian’s project in Jerusalem, and related topics. While scholars correctly deny genuine Cyrillian authorship, still the question of Cyril’s or the Cyrillian community’s infl uence remains and grows. Th e question of local oral tradition has arisen to guide recent discussion regarding whether or not any traces of such infl uence may in fact date back to Cyril’s period as bishop and witness to Julian’s project.Before we delve into the debate about the date of the letter, it is worth quoting portions of the letter that are relevant to our discussion:(6) At the outset, when they wanted to lay the foundations of the Temple on the Sunday previous to the earthquake, there were strong winds and storms, with the result that they were unable to lay the Temple’s foundations that day. It was on that very night that the great earthquake occurred, and we were all in the Church of the Confessors, engaged in prayer. Aft er this we left to go to the Mount of Olives, which is situated to the east of Jerusalem, where our Lord was raised to His glorious Father. We went out into the middle of the city, reciting a psalm, and we passed the graves of the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, and we besought the Lord of the prophets that, through the prayers of His prophets and apostles, His truth might be seen by His worshippers in the face of the audacity of the Jews, who had crucifi ed Him. (7) Now they (sc. the Jews), wanting to imitate us, were running to the place where their synagogue usually gathered, and they found the synagogue doors closed. . . .

And they drove out the demons of the city, and the Jews, and the whole city received the sign of baptism, Jews as well as many pagans, all together, so that we thought that there was not a single person left in the city who had not received the sign or mark of the living Cross in heaven. And it instilled great fear in all. (8) And the entire people thought that, aft er these signs which our Saviour gave us in His Gospel, the fearful (second) coming of the day of resurrection had arrived. With trembling of great joy we received something of the sign of Christ’s crucifi xion, and whosoever did not believe in his mind found his clothes openly reprove[d] him, having the mark of the cross stained on them.71Sebastian Brock, who edited and translated the letter, has argued that, although the manuscript seems to have been written in 1899, its contents are a forgery dat-ing from the early sixth century. Nonetheless, he contends that the letter is related in some way to Jerusalem and Cyril, in light of its similarities to the apocalyptic tenor of Cyril’s Catech. illum. 15.15.72 Philip Wainright disagreed with Brock’s con-clusions and off ered a counterview in an article published in 1986; he concluded that the letter should be included as part of Cyril’s corpus and should be seen as “an important source that sheds new light on this strange episode.”73 Despite Wain-wright’s arguments, however, until quite recently the letter has languished, prima-rily because of these prickly problems of date and authorship—that is, until Drij-vers’s study of Cyril. Drjivers has insisted—correctly in my view—on bringing the letter into the wider socioreligious conversation regarding Jerusalem in the later fourth century, and even into the discussion of what we may be able to glean about the events in 363: “Although it is not very likely that the letter as we have it goes back to an original by Cyril, parts of it may well have a Jerusalem origin and bring us close to Cyril.”74 Drijvers adds: “It is . . . hard to imagine that Cyril, especially in view of the connection he developed between Jerusalem and the cross, as well as the threatening eff ect a restored Temple would have had on the Jerusalem Chris-tian community and his own episcopal see, was not somehow infl uential to the authorship of the text.”75 Stopping short of asserting that this is a true Cyrillian text, he proposes instead that it was written by someone who was closely acquainted with Cyril’s episcopacy. If we accept Drijvers’s assessment, we have an important witness to Cyril’s involvement in the events of that time. Th is letter stands as illu-minating testimony, especially when read in relation to the apocalyptic warnings Cyril provides to baptizands regarding the arrival of the antichrist.What specifi cally, then, might we glean from this curious letter—if anything at all? For our own purposes, it is worth remembering our warning at the outset—we are engaged in a speculative and imaginative exercise within historical inquiry.

So, then, if we adhere only to the large question of Christian violence, what does the letter por-tray?

Th e church that has just been consecrated by Ambrose is one of a small group that the bishop had built—all are outside the city walls, and all have relics. Soon aft er his congregation’s request, the bishop experiences “a rush of presentiment.”1 He then goes to the martyrium of Saints Nabor and Felix in the Hortus Philippi, just outside of Milan.2 While a “rush of presentiment” brings the bishop Ambrose and his retinue to their knees before the grating of the martyrium, something else confi rms the sacrality of that par-ticular spot. As Ambrose relates, “When certain persons were led forward in order that I might lay my hands on them [in blessing], the holy martyrs started driving away [the evil spirit]; consequently, before I had uttered a word one woman was seized and thrown forward at the holy burial place.”3Ambrose meets this sudden display of demonic possession with a decisive response. He orders his clergy to begin to dig. Within minutes, the large and bloody bones of Protasius and Gervasius are unearthed.

It presents an intriguing contrast to Ambrose’s identity as Milan’s erudite and accomplished bishop who has masterfully navigated through the storm introduced to Milan by the imperial family just a few months earlier in the spring of 386. When Valens and Justina insist that they take possession of at least one church, the Portiana, for their use, Ambrose handles their challenge with an impressive dexterity in rhetorical performance and theological argument. Th is is Ambrose of Milan, aft er all: poster bishop for the resurrection of the Christianized late classical city. He presents the perfect model of Roman ideals in ecclesiastical cloth; using nothing more than a bishop’s theologically edged parrhēsia, he is capable of bringing the emperor Th eo-dosius to kneel in a pose of redemptive supplication. How might scholars reconcile the contrast in Ambrose’s charismatic performance during the discovery of the relics with his overall image as episcopal sophisticate? How might they resolve the paradox that arises between these two contrasting Ambrosian fi gures?In this, the fi nal chapter of City of Demons, we propose that the apparent irrec-oncilable disparity that scholars have sensed when considering Ambrose as both the accomplished episcopal leader and the charismatic prophet and exorcist is in fact a fi gment of the modern interpreter’s imagination. Catherine Chin has observed that “the complex series of events in Milan in this period has oft en been analyzed as an early statement of what would later become the relation between church and state.”5 In other words, scholars have followed a rather straightforward path of sociopolitical interpretation in their reading of the basilica crisis as well as the discovery of Protasius and Gervasius. Ascribing political motivations to Ambrose, a number have implied that he consciously decides to take on the role of charismatic prophet, and as with all of his episcopal endeavors he performs mas-terfully. In other words, Ambrose has been portrayed as somehow capable of standing apart from but quite aware of the enchanted worldview that has engulfed those accompanying him. Th us he possesses an uncanny ability to manipulate events to the advantage of the Nicene church in Milan.A modern, secularizing, and disenchanting lens has limited our access to the environment and the world where the events took place in late June, 386 CE. Con-sequently, earlier readings are incomplete and leave much unexplored. To supple-ment and thus balance our understanding, we should contextualize the discovery of Protasius and Gervasius within the enchanted environment and animistic atmos-phere that pervades Milan in the late fourth century. As it stands, scholars have focused intently—but to a varying degree anachronistically and thus myopically—on the evidence. Th eir readings fail to take into account aspects integral to the full late antique perspective; moreover, in some cases, modern interpretations can fos-ter additional misreading.For example, the events in Milan during what is called the crisis over the basil-icas in the spring of 386 CE are familiar to many.6 It is most assuredly the case that"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 201the spring debacle pertains to a confl ict regarding the physical and legal posses-sion of ecclesiastical buildings; however, as we will argue in this chapter, this mod-ern description of the problem also misdirects our attention from other, perhaps more profound, dimensions of the struggle between the Nicene and Arian fac-tions. In fact, Catherine Chin has off ered an illuminating as well as intriguing interpretation in which she deliberately eschews the conventional political reading of the events of that spring; instead, as she attends to the ideological and theologi-cal aspects in the evidence, Chin frames the 386 crisis as “an episode in the politics of extra-bodily embodiment.”7 Driven partially by the need to protect Nicene interests in Milan, in her reading Ambrose comes to identify himself ontologically with his basilicas—the boundaries between himself and church space melting away in the defense of orthodoxy in Milan.We follow a similar path in this chapter by proposing that Ambrose actively engages in reconceptualizing Nicene ritual identity in Milan. In fact, the battle over church possession serves as a catalyst. Th e danger of losing a church—and thus sacramental ritual space—drives Ambrose to reimagine or reconfi gure the ontological relationship between a Christian body (as baptized, sacramental body), a church (as sacramental ritual setting), and Milan (as a larger, ambiguous space for a wide variety of ritual practices). Sacramental and liturgical rituals are Ambrose’s tools for reconfi guring the boundaries among the three. We pursue this line of inquiry through an enchanted, animistic reading.By locating the relics underneath the altar, Ambrose ties their exorcistic eff ect directly to the central location of sacramental power within the Ambrosiana. He thus links the act and eff ect of demonic expulsion—to be precise, the power to expel demonic theological heresy—with the salvifi c eff ect of the Eucharist. In this chapter, we will contextualize these ritual decisions in Milan’s wider Nicene-versus-Arian confl ict—a confl ict that ultimately had begun a generation earlier with the arrival of the Arian bishop Auxentius in 355 CE. By doing so, we will quickly come to realize the greater signifi cance of those few days in June. Th e reburial of Protasius and Gervasius is a small—though fundamental—part of a larger eff ort to redefi ne Christian (Nicene) identity in Milan. Th rough sacramental and liturgical ritual practice, Ambrose and members of his congregation develop a very powerful ritual-ized notion of Nicene Christian identity, one that functions primarily to maintain Milan’s Nicene identity and protect the city from all heretical attacks.Th is fi nal chapter serves two purposes: fi rst, it provides an analysis of Ambrose and Milan that can stand in comparative relation with the book’s other two sec-tions (John/Antioch and Cyril/Jerusalem); second, this chapter functions as a con-clusion for the book as a whole. In other words, we will draw concluding observa-tions for the book as a whole based upon this, our fi nal analysis of urban ecclesiastical authority and Christianization of a late antique city. We will follow the same narrative pattern/structure we have established in parts One and Two:"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"202 Ambrose and Milanurban ecclesiastical and episcopal leaders gain power and authority in and over their city through diabolizing others’ forms of ritual and rhetoric, the public and performative practices that ultimately organize and coordinate the city’s wider enchanted and social environments into a series of coordinating dualities: divine against the demonic, the Nicene party against those who are enemies of Nicene Christianity. With our fi rst two case studies, we devote three chapters to Antioch and Jerusalem, respectively. Th e fi rst chapter of each part presents the city in its entirety from an enchanted and animistic perspective; the second chapter consid-ers the local church leader (John or Cyril) and his strategy of exorcistic encounters that defi ne religious, theological, even political, opposition as demon-possessed or demon-corrupted. Th e third chapter of each part introduces a religious confl ict specifi c to the city and considers the dimension of violence that an enchanted, animistic perspective reveals.As we turn to Ambrose and Milan in this fi nal chapter, we are faced with the chal-lenge of condensing our interpretation from three chapters to one. We will maintain a tight focus by closely examining the issues of ritual agency and effi cacy—more precisely, sacramental ritual agency and effi cacy in the wider context of Milan’s Nicene-versus-Arian confl ict. Th is chapter traces the manner in which Ambrose and the members of his congregation promote the diabolizing effi cacy of sacramen-tal ritual. Th ey use baptism, the Eucharist, and exorcistic practices to forge a produc-tive, generative relationship among three diff erent materialities: city (Milan), place (e.g., church), and body (Nicene baptized body). In other words, Ambrose and his community move toward a model of Nicene Milanese identity that promotes an ontological overlap or union among these three. Th is model of Nicene Milanese identity renders Arian Milanese identity an impossibility at best, a sacramental abomination at worst.As we proceed in this study, a realization quickly emerges: We should not iso-late the events of June 386 in any way. Rather, during those tense few days Ambrose and his congregation are continuing to develop notions of ritual power and effi -cacy that we must understand within a much longer history of theological and ecclesiastical confl ict in Milan. In 355 a sudden upset during a synod in Milan had led to the abrupt, physical removal of the Nicene bishop, Dionysius; in his place, Constantius II places Auxentius, an Arian and Eastern foreigner, who holds the episcopal throne until Ambrose’s own rise to episcopal power in 374. Christians on both sides draw lasting battle lines at that time. Some divisions are theological; some are doctrinal; still others are ideological. Th ere are also deep divisions that slash across the physical topography and geography of Milan. Th e result is a net-work of interlinking dualisms that rips apart the city as thoroughly as it divides Milan’s populations: orthodoxy versus heterodoxy, orthopraxy versus heteropraxy, public versus private, visible versus invisible, open versus hidden, within the city walls versus outside the city walls, and divine versus demonic. All these lines of"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 203confl ict that divide Milan will endure, and inevitably they provide a foundation for Ambrose’s own views of theological confl ict and spiritual warfare.With that in mind, let us now turn to the city of Milan itself.THE CITY OF MILANMilan has long been favored by the Roman Empire, and the city’s fortunes have risen with the empire’s expansion.8 As imperial powers have become increasingly anxious regarding the growing hostilities beyond their own territories, cities along the empire’s northeastern frontier have gained importance. Trier and Sirmium in northern Gaul and cities in the Rhineland and Illyrium, for example, have grown steadily from the fi rst to the fourth century.9 In the northern reaches of Italy, Milan takes center stage. As administrative and military personnel move to Milan and the surrounding areas beyond the Po, they bring a social and economic strength to the region that signifi cantly increases Milan’s wealth; army veterans, as well as a new group of civil servants, elite, and members of the imperial court increase the landholding population, which in turn supports the city. Milan is also favored geo-graphically. It sits at the crossroads of east-west and north-south interests, from the Balkans to Gaul and Africa and from Rome to the Alpines.10 Five major roads radiate out from the city, guaranteeing its importance in political and military aff airs. As in Antioch, trade routes run through the heart of Milan, ensuring its economic prosperity as well as demographic diversity.While favored in its position as a frontier city, Milan’s proximity to Rome, the heart of imperial power, also contributes to its escalating importance. In the fi rst century BCE, Rome declares Milan a municipium (free city); in the age of the Antonines it is again declared a free city.11 By the end of the second century, Milan has become one of the most important cities in the western empire. It is one of the nine great cities that receives special notice of the nomination of Marcus Aurelius as emperor in 235. While it suff ers certain setbacks during the third century, espe-cially during the reign of Valerian (270–75), in 293 it becomes the offi cial seat of the Augustus of the West, Maximian Hercules (293–305), and its fortunes begin to improve once again.12 Aft er Constantine’s death in the fourth century it becomes the offi cial seat of the Augustii in the West. Milan retains that privileged status until 404, when that honor is transferred to Ravenna. While Maximian is in resi-dence, he is the patron of many improvements to the city, the most important of which is a new circuit of walls with a circumference of two and a half miles, built around the city to protect it against barbarian invasions.13 Th ese walls demarcate the city clearly and help to project an image of a wealthy, fortifi ed, and imperially favored city. Once we move into the later fourth century, Milan’s walls once again signal the city’s shape, its wealth, and its strength, though in a diff erent way. Th e walls now emphasize a divide and diff erence, in location if nothing else, between"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"204 Ambrose and Milanthe older churches within Milan (e.g., the Vetus and Nova basilicas) and other evolving ecclesiastical spaces related to Ambrose’s own churches (e.g., the Ambro-siana and the Apostoleon) that rise quickly just beyond the city walls. We will discuss below other ways that Milan’s walls manage the diff erences as well as the similarities in these two sets of churches.In the fourth century Milan reaps the social and cultural benefi ts of being a city that off ers a home to the imperial court. Constantius II lives in Milan the longest, from 352 to 357, and, in Neil McLynn’s view, gives “the Milanese their most pro-longed access to the imperial power in a generation—a whole cycle of ceremonies had helped establish his patronage: victory celebrations, imperial anniversaries and consular accessions all involved him in dealings with the populace.”14 Such public activities help to organize and unify Milanese churches under the Arian bishop loyal to the emperor. In light of Constantius’s long residency, Milan also bears witness to the beginnings of Constantius’s end: from there, in 355, Constan-tius announces Julian as Caesar. Two years later Constantius departs the comforts of Milan for a brief visit to Rome before departing for military campaigns against the Sarmatians, Suevi, and Quadi, across the Danube, and he never returns to Milan. Th e tradition of imperial residency continues during the reign of Valentin-ian I, who stays in Milan from November 364 to November 365 before moving on to Trier with his court, and again beginning in 379, when Gratian arrives in the city with his court in August. Valens and Justina come to the city soon aft er.15Ausonius, leading rhetorician and poet who holds infl uence over Gratian as he assembles his court, passes through the city in 379 en route from Rome to Bor-deaux. He describes Milan as a city that displays centuries of almost unbroken good fortune:At Milan everything is marvelous. It has an abundance of everything: countless beautiful homes, men of great eloquence, a lighthearted populace, a site enlarged by a double wall, a circus and a covered theater which are the delight of the citizens, temples, a royal palace, a splendid mint, famous baths dedicated to Hercules with their porticoes fi lled with marble statues, and walls surrounded by a moat. All of these objects rival one another in beauty and grandeur, and they do not suff er in comparison with those of Rome.16A great deal of archaeological evidence corroborates Ausonius’s descriptions of Milan’s beauty, and especially his emphasis on a sophistication still rooted in the city’s Greco-Roman heritage. Inscriptions found throughout Milan attest to the importance of horse races and the Augustan-era theater.17 A stone from a theater near the Church of St. Victor featuring a portrait of the actor Pilades still sits in the Ambrosian Library; he lift s his mask and receives applause from cives Mediola-nenses.18 Th ere is also an amphitheater that off ers space to gladiatorial events.19 In addition, archaeological evidence demonstrates Milan’s robust religious pluralism."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 205In the city’s archaeological museum there are thirty marble statues of pagan dei-ties. One-third of the extant votive inscriptions are dedicated to Jupiter; other dei-ties include the Matronae, Mercury, Minerva, and Celtic deities of northern Italy.20 Angelo Paredi has described the priestly offi ces attested in inscriptions as well as the public patronage of a variety of religious cults.21 One inscription, for example, describes a Publius Acilius Pisonianus, who reconstructed a Mithraeum and Mithraic grotto; it has been destroyed by the time of Ambrose. Th e archaeological evidence off ers us a sense of a robust religious pluralism somewhat ironically enjoyed in the city where Constantine and Licinius bring an end to Christian per-secution in 313 CE.While we might be tempted to name Milan a city of churches, we do so at the great cost of overlooking or erasing Milan’s rich polytheist and Greco-Roman cul-ture. Th e city’s polytheist culture continually presses upon and rises between the churches in ways we should endeavor to bring to the forefront as we imagine Milan in the late fourth century.MILANESE CHURCHESAs in other large cities of the Mediterranean, churches begin to make their mark on Milan’s religious landscape early in the fourth century. We should not presume that Milanese churches are straightforward religious structures that provide con-ventional ritual settings for Christians’ sacramental practice. Neither, for that mat-ter, should we assume some kind of standardization in ecclesiastical architecture or sacramental ritual practice in Milan at such an early date. In any environment—either in Milan or elsewhere—we would be remiss in pre-suming ritual or architectural conformity or standardization in ecclesiastical buildings at such an early (if indeed any) date. Likewise, contingencies in the local—and in Milan’s case translocal (imperial)—situation infl uence a church’s construction, its initial and later use, and evolving ritual practice. Similarly, eccle-siastical architecture (the strategic memories and meanings these spatial locations inspire) and related ritual practice (that which the church and memories engen-der) are all responding to, reacting against, or in dialogue with structures in the surrounding environment. Th us we should not imagine Milanese churches stand-ing detached from and untouched by the city’s surrounding topography. Rather, church buildings and other ecclesiastical structures are fully immersed in the con-tentious religious pluralism that takes hold within some, though not all, late antique cities.As we move forward to survey what scholars have recorded regarding Milan’s churches, we should bear in mind what many have not considered in their descrip-tions of these buildings or the city itself: the idea or prize that is Milan serves as a battleground for theological, political, and religious confl ict. Th at confl ict hardily"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"206 Ambrose and Milanfuels and galvanizes transformative processes aff ecting the ecclesiastical struc-tures, as well as the meaning (memory) and ritual practices associated with those structures. Fundamental to our understanding of Ambrose’s actions in and just outside of Milan, including his approach to Protasius and Gervasius, is our consid-eration of the churches and their ecclesiastical and sacramental ritual as organic material, and thus acutely responsive to the oft en-tumultuous context of Milan.To this end, Harry Maier deserves renewed recognition for his reading of the Milanese scene in the mid-fourth century.22 From the time of the ordination of the Arian bishop Auxentius in 355, according to Maier, the possession, confi scation, construction, and ritual manipulation of ecclesiastical space quickly becomes the dedicated occupation of both theological factions until the end of the fourth cen-tury. In fact, he insists correctly that we must not consider Milan’s theological con-fl icts and theological tensions as in any way detached from the aggressive confl ict and competition involving ecclesiastical space that indeed yields new forms of both ecclesiastical space and sacramental ritual. Maier draws attention to what might be described as the underbelly of Christian sacramental practice. Domestic dwellings, cemeteries, caves, and other wild outdoor locations off er sanctuary to the ecclesiastically dispossessed from 355 on. Many among the Nicene clergy and laity exiled from their churches hover predatorily on the edges and in the shadows of Milan’s imagined religious topography.Sacramental shift s, however, do not only pertain to a change in location. Many, though certainly not all, have viewed the basilica crisis in relatively straightfor-ward terms: i.e., as a battle over the possession of a religious structure(s) and the socioreligious and political power related to the act of laying claim to such a build-ing. By reducing the crisis in this manner, one very quickly loses sight of the church itself as a dynamic ritual space—a place of ritual activity, creation, and even innovation as well as a location of Christian ritual construction. By considering an ecclesiastical structure/location in this manner—that is, as a fi eld of sacramental possibility—we can recognize how Ambrose and his community reconceptualize Nicene Christian identity in Milan as well as the radical consequences of that reconceptualization; we grasp the processes whereby Ambrose and other Nicene Christians situate, to borrow Catherine Chin’s phrase again, a concept of “extra-bodily embodiment” at the core of Nicene Christian identity in Milan. In other words, in the animated and enchanted environment of Milan, especially in the spiritually fraught atmosphere of Milan during the basilica crisis, Nicene Chris-tians move toward a model of ritualized Christian identity that encompasses a mutually protective relationship between the baptized human body, the sacramen-tal church, and the cleansed city. Th is is a mode of Nicene Christian identity tai-lored for spiritual warfare. As we move through our discussion of Milan’s churches, we should keep this model of religious and ritual identity in the forefront of our minds."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 207Th e Basilica Nova, later rededicated and renamed in honor of Saint Tecla, once stood in the urban center of Milan.23 Remnants of the church were discovered below the piazza west of the Gothic Duomo. Archaeological remains suggest a very impressive church in terms of both size (80 by 45 meters) and decoration. According to Richard Krautheimer, in Ambrose’s time the church is large enough to hold three thousand congregants and is therefore on a par with Constantine’s Lateran Church in Rome. Th e Basilica Nova’s size and location also suggest that its construction “demand[ed] the sacrifi ce of considerable property,” thus dramat-ically altering the sacred balance of the city center.24 Th e church stood adjacent to an octagonal baptistery, which some have suggested is added by Ambrose; at the very least the bishop lays claim to the baptismal space with an inscription.25 Krautheimer proposes that Constans, a strong advocate for Athanasius and the Nicene party, commissions the church in 345–50. Its hasty completion by 353 would make the church available for those in attendance at the fateful synod of 355, during which Arians take hold of Milan. However, McLynn disagrees, and argues instead that the church is not occupied until Auxentius takes power in 355.26Th e now-vanished Basilica Vetus or Basilica Minor was built at an earlier date, although, as Krautheimer notes, it could not have antedated the Edict of Milan in 313.27 Literary evidence indicates a location close to the Basilica Nova; specifi cally, one of Ambrose’s letters suggests that in his time it stands in proximity to the bishop’s palace.28 Despite wider excavations within the Gothic Duomo area, how-ever, the location is still a mystery. While some have suggested that the Vetus is the cathedral church before the construction of the new basilica, McLynn limits the importance of the Basilica Vetus to its baptismal function; he theorizes that it is used in connection with Holy Week liturgy only.29Ambrose of Milan names the Portiana as the basilica requested by the imperial court in 386.30 Th e Portiana has been identifi ed with the present-day San Lorenzo, a church that has been studied exhaustively by archaeologists and art historians.31 Th ere are many aspects of the San Lorenzo that support its identifi cation with the Portiana. Th e basilica’s plan—a tetraconch church, surrounded by four towers, and fl anked by three octagonal buildings—is certainly impressive and indicates an equally impressive patron. Scholars have suggested a wide range of names, including possible imperial fi gures, for this role, including Constans, Constantius II, Valentin-ian I, or Gratian.32 Supporting the theory of imperial patronage, one of three octago-nal buildings may have been intended as an imperial mausoleum.33 Furthermore, materials used in the basilica’s construction include portions of an amphitheater that may have been demolished to clear space for the church. As Marcia Colish has argued, since the amphitheater is a public building—and indeed one of the largest amphitheaters—it is the property of the imperial fi sc; therefore its destruction can take place only by imperial command. Th e San Lorenzo’s southwest location just"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"208 Ambrose and Milanoutside Porta Ticinensis Gate puts it in the general vicinity of a proposed but not proven location of the imperial palace.While this evidence supports the S. Lorenzo’s identifi cation with a palace church, it does not necessarily extend to a confi rmation that it is the Portiana. For his part, McLynn advises caution: “Th e specifi c identifi cation of the Portian Basil-ica with San Lorenzo, although attractive, must remain hypothetical.”34 Neverthe-less, he encourages circumspect identifi cation of the two, if only to recognize in the San Lorenzo some of the relevant physical features that play a role in the basil-ica confl ict. To that end, Colish, who accepts the Portiana/San Lorenzo identifi ca-tion without question, argues persuasively that the San Lorenzo’s baptistery reveals the primary motivation for the basilica confl ict.35 Th e imperial court—more to the point, an Arian imperial court—arrives in Milan with its own clergy. During Lenten season, Easter celebrations and baptism would be an overriding concern. Th e San Lorenzo, to the best of our knowledge—and if it is indeed already built by that time—would be the only church with a baptistery outside the Basilica Vetus’s baptistery and the baptistery adjacent to the Basilica Nova. Colish’s contention that the basilica confl ict was rooted primarily in issues of sacramental practice rather than questions regarding imperial versus episcopal property is compelling, and it is a suggestion that we will consider later in the chapter.Our evidence of ecclesiastical architecture sets the stage nicely for a discussion of the various groups and individuals who are in confl ict over various religious, theological, and sociopolitical issues that extend from 355 CE to the late 380s. In order to have a fi rm grasp of the manner in which Ambrose understands the Milan of his time, its churches, and its Nicene population—and the potential symbiosis among those three elements—we must step back to consider a violent event in Milan’s history: the exile of Bishop Dionysius in 355 CE.THE NICENE COMMUNITY, 355–74: A CHARISMATIC AWAKENINGIn 355 Constantius II has been residing in Milan for three years and has a visibly congenial relationship with the bishop, Dionysius.36 Th e two are seen together, united in many offi cial processions both religious and civic. However, Constantius also has within his court in Milan two Arian priests, Valens and Ursacius, who are conducting a campaign against Athanasius and other Nicene bishops and using Milan as a headquarters of sorts.37 A synod is called in Milan in that year to deter-mine the orthodoxy of Athanasius.38 Th e synod, which may have been held in the vast Basilica Nova (if completed in time) or in the strikingly large Portiana, cer-tainly takes place in a location intended to impress its participants. During the pro-ceedings, the Nicenes quickly fall out of favor, and a number of leading Nicenes are excommunicated. Dionysius, the Nicene bishop of Milan, is deposed and exiled."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 209Dionysius’s exile is the fi rst of a series of public, violent events that serve to restructure Milan into the divided environment that we have already mentioned: Arian versus Nicene, church versus non-church, inside city walls versus outside city walls, public versus private, heteropraxy versus orthopraxy, demonic versus divine. Th ese moments collect into a shared memory that determines Nicene dis-tance and diff erence from Arian opposition. Th is memory of Arian violence and danger informs Ambrose’s sacramental view of Milan and his notion of true Nicene Christian identity in that city.Dionysius’s forced exile from the church is a humiliating and dramatic specta-cle. Soldiers enter the church sanctuary and physically remove the bishop in a rough manner during the offi cial proceedings of the synod. Constantius II’s rela-tionship with Dionysius quickly fades as the emperor maneuvers a speedy ordina-tion for the Arian Auxentius from Cappadocia. It is not long, as Maier has pointed out, before “an impregnable Arian beachhead [has been established] in Milan under the episcopate of Auxentius.”39 Th e sudden reversal in what has been a Nicene city extends far beyond Dionysius’s exile. Th e sequence of events involves a sweep of the Nicenes from the city; those who hold ecclesiastical positions at other churches within the city and who are viewed as closely tied to Dionysius and/or the Nicene party are also exiled. While the majority of congregants cer-tainly blend into Milanese congregations under Auxentius as McLynn has persua-sively suggested, Ursacius and Valens are on hand to help the new bishop identify the more troublesome Nicene priests, deacons, readers, and exorcists. In light of the violent and intentionally humiliating manner in which Constantius handles Dionysius’s exile, it is hard to imagine that Auxentius, upon his arrival, fails to extend similar treatment to other Nicene leaders while thus making room for Arian replacements. Unfortunately, details are few and far between, and we are forced to speculate regarding the degree of violence employed.In the wake of the sudden episcopal switch of 355, the period to follow certainly experiences a degree of the tumult born in Dionysius’s removal. Especially as we consider the subsequent and undoubtedly chaotic reshuffl ing of clergy and reset-tling of congregations, Auxentius, a foreigner to Milan, likely fi nds it diffi cult to legitimize his position.A Nicene city suddenly and inexplicably robbed of its bishop will at the very least be suspicious of this new episcopal leader from Cappadocia, despite the fact that it is the emperor who has placed him in that position—or, perhaps, precisely because the emperor has insisted on Auxentius’s right to the bishop’s throne. A display of strong, unyielding force in the removal of other Nicene clergy—perhaps deliberately performed in a manner to recall to mind Dionysius’s humiliating departure—would strengthen the imagined divide between Arian and Nicene fac-tions and help to market a new power relation of Arian leadership over and above a crippled Nicene community."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"210 Ambrose and MilanOver the next two years, Constantius continues his stay in the Milanese palace and begins a new, quite visible, relationship with an Arian episcopacy, overlaying memories of the aff able ties the emperor and Dionysus had had with new images of Constantius and Auxentius together in public processions and other festivals. In this age of pageantry in Milan, the public procession is a powerful means of defi n-ing political reality. McLynn has observed that the Basilica Nova plays an impor-tant role in the establishment of Auxentius’s position and power among the Mila-nese. Th e church, which in the “quality of its construction, and its lavish decoration [is] set . . . apart from anything else known in northern Italy at this time,” would give Auxentius “considerable advantage when confronting strangers. . . . [B]esides impressing upon the audience the solidity of the bishop’s position, it would have given the challenger an opportunity to see for himself the hold that walls and ceil-ings exercised upon the people of Milan.”40 In other words, we see in Auxentius’s use of the Basilica Nova the fi rst clear example in Milan of the exploitation of an ecclesiastical setting in theological confl icts. During this period, Christians dedi-cated to Nicene Christianity are driven from the churches and forced to meet in secret and, at times, beyond the city walls. Hilary of Poitiers attempts to turn this period of exile into a positive development for the true Christian community in this time of persecution, describing their new “secret meetings in forests and mountains.”41Auxentius’s hold over the churches remains strong throughout the twenty years of Arian reign. Th e city, as McLynn argues, converts to an Arian city for the most part. Earlier arguments that there must be a Nicene “resistance,” which stands strictly apart from the church for twenty years and meets Ambrose with great enthusiasm upon Auxentius’s death, are not supported by the evidence McLynn adds to the discussion.42 More likely than not, most fall in with Auxentius’s congre-gation and become part of the Basilica Nova community. Th eological battles that rip apart and divide the ecclesiastical level of the Christian body hardly touch the concerns of the lay community in Milan. For the most part McLynn’s appraisal is persuasive. Nonetheless, there must be a few former Nicene clergy and perhaps a handful of the more pious among the Nicene laity who react strongly—especially those who are more deeply attuned to the theological divide, its meaning for sac-ramental practice, and the related conceptualizations of ritual embodiment of the holy. Such individuals, as suggested above, would hold themselves apart from this new Arian community in a situation of self-imposed exile. But where? Do they meet in the city? In houses, perhaps? Or do they form secretive ritual communities of their own somewhere beyond the protective walls of a now-Arian Milan? If we might pause to imagine these renegade groups and how they maintain their integ-rity, what comes to mind? We do know of a handful of Nicenes who feel compelled to visit Milan and speak to the Nicene plight. Martin of Tours, Hilary of Poitiers, and Filastrius, who eventually becomes the bishop of Brescia, arrive in Milan at"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 211diff erent times in an eff ort to disrupt the ecclesiastical power of the Arian party; each fails in his eff orts and provokes Auxentius to react aggressively, sometimes violently. In what follows, as we review what little we know of these interactions, we will attend to the manner in which each encounter between one of these Nicene protagonists and Auxentius contributes to an overall understanding of the violent opposition between the Nicene and Arian parties.According to Sulpicius Severus, Martin of Tours settles in Milan with the inten-tion of establishing a monastic cell within the city, and begins to engage in a Nicene campaign. Th is is not to be, however: “Th ere too Auxentius, the chief instigator and leader of the Arians, persecuted him relentlessly; he infl icted many injuries on Martin and expelled him from the city.”43 Maier has suggested, correctly in our view, that Martin’s campaign would have taken place not only in the public eye, but also in the aristocratic households of the Milanese.44 We propose that one of Mar-tin’s main strategies involves exorcism and healing, similar to a strategy he employs in Tours. Sulpicius provides ample discussion of these events. For now, though, let us consider only one exorcism. Sulpicius describes how Martin hesitates to per-form an exorcism on a slave belonging to a man called Taetradus, who is of proconsular rank. Sulpicius claims “that [Martin] was unable to enter a house that belonged to a pagan, an adherent of a false religion.”45 Of course, once Taetradus promises to become a Christian, Martin walks in and exorcises the boy with ease. Making concessions for the heavy literary as well as ideological manhandling of this passage—that is, Martin’s exorcisms function to display the conversion of non-Christians to Christianity—it does not necessarily follow that Martin does not intentionally participate in the fundamental creation of this image in his own exorcism practice. Furthermore, if Martin does engage in exorcistic discernment or discrimination in Tours, then why not in Milan?To answer these questions, let us consider how Martin enters Milan. He refrains from arriving alone and taking up a quiet position within a household or remov-ing himself altogether from the public eye in order that he may ensure his continu-ing, uninterrupted availability to the Nicene community. Rather, he establishes a monastic cell within Milan, in close proximity to Auxentius’s basilica, and thus draws attention to a pious Nicene voice and identity. He performs a form of Chris-tianity that challenges Auxentius in Milan’s center; moreover, he augments the power of his Nicene community through his own reputation as a charismatic healer. In response, according to Sulpicius, Auxentius publicly beats Martin and chases him from the city. If we are to believe Sulpicius, the underlying motivations are intriguing to consider. Sulpicius compliments the placement of the monastic cell as an intentional, perhaps even shrewd, decision on Martin’s part. It would seem that Martin is executing an ecclesiastical strategy that shares parallels with recent practices within the conservative Anglican church in America today: in a situation of internal dissension, Martin is church planting. He anchors a"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"212 Ambrose and Milanconfl icting, perhaps contentious, but certainly “true” and charismatically superior version of Christianity in the midst of churches captured and corrupted by a false brand of the religion. In fact, we may recognize a house-call exorcism that Martin apparently performs in Milan—if he follows the model he has established in Tours—a spectacular performance of Nicene propaganda: for example, an exiting demon testifying to the indomitable power of the Nicene Creed. We may imagine then how Martin’s antidemonic activity helps to shape the exorcistic power in the bones of Protasius and Gervasius. In any event, Martin’s violent expulsion from the city once again demonstrates clearly for all within Milan an aggressive divide between the Nicene and Arian factions. While this situation ends in Auxentius’s favor, establishing his ecclesiastical and civic authority, it also inscribes a corrobo-rating homology: the Arian party as institutional, somewhat tyrannical authority set against the Nicene party associated with charismatic, healing power, and monastic piety.Hilary of Poitiers arrives in the city soon aft er Valentinian comes to power in 364, and he spends some time preaching against Auxentius to the Nicene commu-nity. Soon aft er his arrival, he attempts to dethrone Auxentius in 364 by charging the bishop with heresy. In response to the charges, Valentinian orders an inquest in the marketplace or court by the quaestor and the magister accompanied by ten bishops. Auxentius is cleared of the charges and, in fact, receives an offi cial endorsement from Valentinian. Hilary, on the other hand, is forced to leave the city by the emperor’s command.Aft er his expulsion from Milan, Hilary writes Libra contra Arianos vel Auxen-tium Mediolanensem, which describes the events that have taken place. Scholars have noted the manner in which Hilary uses a demonizing lens to set boundaries between Nicenes and Arians; in fact, Hilary describes Auxentius’s episcopacy as the rule of the antichrist intent on tricking the faithful into entering Arian churches:46One thing I warn: Beware the Antichrist. For it is wrong that love for walls has seized you, wrong that you adore the Church of God in its ceilings and buildings, wrong that you repeat the name of peace inside you. Is there any doubt that it is in these places that the Antichrist will sit?47Hilary proclaims that Auxentius contaminates the physical structure of the church—its walls, its houses, and its buildings—making the church the place of the antichrist, the angel of Satan, who labors intensely to destroy the faith. Hilary, for his part, pre-fers the forests, lakes, and caves—in other words, the natural spaces untouched by man are safer. In nature, Hilary explains, one can still hear the spirit of God proph-esying; there one can feel a greater presence of divinity untainted by Auxentius/the antichrist/the angel of Satan. Hilary may be doing much more than describing the divide between Arian and Nicene camps. Hilary asks Nicene Christians to step"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 213outside the city and worship God correctly in their secreta coenabula—in other words, the area in the cemetery reserved for worship of the dead.48 Neil McLynn has theorized that, in an eff ort to bring focus to a Nicene resistance movement, Hilary is taking advantage of martyrial worship already under way:By tending their graves and celebrating their memory they could demonstrate that they, unlike the time-serving bishop, were more concerned to honor Milanese citi-zens than to keep favor with the palace, and were also able to express their resent-ment against a regime that had been so drastically mistaken in its doctrinal choices. Th e cult therefore helped sustain the identity, and advertise the opposition status, of the Nicene Christians.49In eff ect, Hilary is drawing a clear dividing line that separates ecclesiastical buildings as locations of Arian contagion (antichrist/apocalyptic/eschatology) from all other locations—but especially those untrammeled spaces beyond Milan, and in fact beyond all urban construction. Th e antichrist has thoroughly infected the phys-ical churches of Milan, but his sphere of corruption does not extend beyond the city walls. Instead, in land beyond the city walls, a person might still receive the proph-ecy of the spirit of God. In his eff orts to diff erentiate between Arian and Nicene Christianity, Hilary does much more than mark the diff erences between Arian and Nicene ecclesiastical space and sacramental ritual. He constructs an idea of Nicene orthopraxy and orthodoxy that is rooted to the natural environment. Beyond the city walls that surround a manmade civilization, the true spirit of God continues to off er prophecies in a way that is in tune with—or organic to—the natural environ-ment. He also establishes Nicene orthopraxy in a location associated with charis-matic forms of religious power rather than institutional ecclesiastical authority. By contrast, Hilary describes the Basilica Nova and other churches within Milan as corrupted ecclesiastical vessels—the urban church is a location of Arian contagion (antichrist/apocalyptic/eschatology). Th e antichrist has taken possession of the city’s churches in a manner similar to a demon that takes possession of a body. Th ese urban structures are unsafe places for Nicene Christians.Nearing the end of Auxentius’s life, another Nicene, named Filastrius, again attempts to raise some kind of oppositional momentum against Auxentius.50 We know very little about Filastrius other than he is a zealous defender of orthodoxy who has frequently fought against heresy elsewhere.51 Fairly quickly upon his arrival to Milan, he earns Auxentius’s hatred; he is severely beaten and eventually chased out of the city.52 Fortunately, Filastrius eventually recovers and later becomes bishop of Brescia. Th ough Filastrius’s encounter in Milan is brief, his situation off ers confi rmation of a pattern of violence in Auxentius’s relations with Nicene outsiders and upstarts; this invites us to consider to what extent Nicenes purposely are antagonizing and baiting the bishop in an eff ort to disclose again and again his lack of emotional control as the city’s leader.53"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"214 Ambrose and MilanAMBROSE AND THE NICENE CONGREGATION, 374–86Harry Maier has proposed a provocative view of the Arian threat that Ambrose faces once he becomes bishop; in attending to the landscape of theological confl ict in Milan from 374 to 386, Maier argues for what might be described as an anti-Nicene guerrilla community that begins in Milan only a few short months aft er Ambrose takes the episcopal throne.54 Aft er twenty years of public dominance under Auxentius, Arians are cast out of their public spaces and forced into private dwellings and hidden places. An infl ux of refugees from the barbarian invasions in Illyricum fuels the rapid growth of what amounts to a dissident Arian movement; we should recognize that these private communities swell not only with the addi-tion of Arian laity, but also with ordained priests who are eager to expand their ecclesiastical leadership in Milan. Th e fi rst to arrive is Julian Valens, probably in 375. Th is former bishop of Poetovio in Noricum is compelled to fl ee probably aft er the invasions of the Quadi and Sarmatians into Illyricum.55 He begins gathering a community of Illyricum refugees and Arian militia in Milan, which hardly thrills the city’s bishop. Ambrose’s primary concern pivots around Julian’s “illegal ordina-tions.”56 Th rough these, Ambrose claims, Julian intends to build a clerical com-munity that will corrupt the Nicene community.57 In other words, such ordina-tions will enable Julian to launch a campaign of baptisms and the performance of the Arian Eucharist, spreading a sacramental pestilence throughout the city. Ambrose also worries about Ursinus, a pretender to the Roman episcopate, who has recently arrived in Milan and then allied himself with Julian Valens. In Epistle extra collectionem 5 (Maurist edition 11), Ambrose expresses his concerns in greater detail:[Ursinus] was in union and combination with the Arians, when, in company with Valens, he tried to throw into confusion the Church at Milan, holding secret assem-blies, sometimes before the doors of the synagogue, sometimes in the homes of Ari-ans, and getting his friends to join them. Th en, since he himself could not openly enter their assemblies, teaching and informing them how the peace of the church might be disturbed, he drew fresh courage from their madness when he was able to earn the favor of their supporters and allies.58Maier has drawn much-needed attention to the Expositio Evangelii secundum Lucam, in which Ambrose goes to great lengths to portray the Arian community as a grave threat unrecognized by his community.59 In Exp. Luc. 7.31, for example, Ambrose condemns the Arians as “little foxes” who are deprived of their own house and now wait to ambush those who reside in the house of faith.60 In Exp. Luc. 7.44–54, Ambrose portrays Arians as wolves determined to lead faithful (Christian) sheep from their shelter. In Exp. Luc. 7.95, he insists that “the assem-blies [of the heretics and schismatics] are not of God but of an unclean spirit (immundus spiritus).”61 Likewise, in Exp. Luc. 6.68, Ambrose insists that “[a] heret-"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 215ical teacher disfi gures (deformet) the dwelling he is in,”62 forcing anyone who is faithful to fl ee such a place.As Maier has already observed, Ambrose follows Hilary of Poitiers’s earlier examples in constructing the Arian danger; we should emphasize, however, that Ambrose goes to greater lengths in constructing a spiritual and cosmological divide between the two theological factions. In Exp. Luc. 10, Ambrose draws upon 1 John 4 and 2 Th essalonians 2:7–8 in characterizing the Arians as “false prophets [seeking] to lead catechumens and the baptized from the church.”63 Ambrose also alludes to New Testament passages that speak directly about an antichrist (2 John and 2 Th essalonians) who is eager to divide the Arian and Nicene communities.In light of these passages, Maier envisions an “opposition . . . between an Arian community, devising its strategy and meeting for worship in private, and a bishop jealously guarding the city’s basilicas.”64 He emphasizes that we should understand an underground Arian movement in private dwellings, which cultivates “a hetero-dox topography, which would have been diffi cult, at times impossible, to iden-tify.”65 Th is is certainly the case. In fact, Ambrose uses the elusive nature of the apparent dissident movement to construct rather frightening images of the Arian threat. In Expositio Evangelii secundum Lucam Arians wait calmly hidden in the shadows, enjoying their tactical advantage. By contrast, unprotected Nicene Chris-tians gather in public, open, and visible ecclesiastical structures; Nicene Christians are exposed and vulnerable to attack.Ambrose is now the offi cial bishop, in a position of public, visible, and percep-tible power, while Hilary, by contrast, stood outside the city aft er his violent expul-sion by an enemy who once held the position that Ambrose now seeks to protect. Despite their diff erent positions in relation to Milan and ecclesiastical authority, Ambrose emulates Hilary’s earlier example and frames himself and his congrega-tion as a community that is woefully vulnerable to an Arian threat; this is not only a theological or human threat, but a supernatural power with malevolent intent. He strongly implies the demonically contaminating nature of their meetings: attendance at an Arian gathering can spiritually corrupt an individual. Similarly, Ambrose’s insistence that a heretical (i.e., Arian) teacher disfi gures his environ-ment conveys the same message: a heretical teacher can disfi gure (deformet) the mind, the spirit, the soul of anyone in his company. In eff ect, Ambrose ascribes an animistic taint to Arian identity, and the spiritual impurity that clings to an Arian can, one assumes, spread. If a disguised heretic or schismatic, who carries an unclean spirit (immundi spiritus), should enter Ambrose’s church, what will hap-pen? In fact, how can one know if a church under Ambrose’s control is safe? How can the Nicene community protect their churches against such inimical forces?Ambrose continues and attempts to complete what Hilary, Martin, and Filas-trius had begun much earlier: the complete exposure of the spiritual warfare that currently pervades Milan. Nicene Christianity must struggle day to day against the"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"216 Ambrose and Milanevil forces protecting and fortifying the Arian heresy. One should not be deceived by any of the Arian clergy, displaced by the Gothic invasions as early as 357, who claim only to be seeking refuge in Milan and nothing more. According to Ambrose, not only did they quickly form a dissident movement that is lurking expectantly in the shadows of Milan’s great churches, but they have brought much more with them than a heretical theology; smuggled in their words, their teaching, their rituals is a malevolent spirit (immundi spiritus) eager to disfi gure (deformet) the unsuspecting.With the arrival of the imperial court of Valens and his mother, Justina, at the imperial palaces, the division deepens. Th e manner of deepening the divide pivots on both sides around sacramental practice. Th e court invites its own bishop to the city, a second Auxentius, who will organize a campaign for Milan in the form of a sacramental program that is intent on rebaptizing Nicenes. Inevitably this leads to the famous basilica crisis in 386, in which Valens and Justina request that Ambrose relinquish a church (or churches) for their use. In fact, this has been traditionally read as a confl ict or competition over churches. We propose that much more is involved, however. Ambrose and members of his congregation understand Valens’s and Justina’s request for a basilica as a dangerous spiritual attack—one that leaves only two means of counterattack. Th e fi rst is simply to refuse to surrender the basilica; the second involves strengthening the basilicas through sacramental (antidemonic) ritual practice. In what follows we will consider the basilica crisis from this perspective of spiritual warfare.HOLY WEEK OF 386Th is study does not provide suffi cient space to review the entire series of events in the basilica crisis in the spring of 386. Entering into the very complicated debate regarding the chronology of events and their exact locations would only distract us from our actual purpose. To that end, we follow Neil McLynn’s careful chronology of both the primary and the secondary evidence as suffi cient background for our discussion.66In January 386, Valentinian II issues an edict authorizing public worship by the Arians. Marcia Colish has argued persuasively that this involves an Arian desire for a baptistery during the Easter season. Th us the confl ict is not simply one of church possession, but a battle involving sacramental ritual practice, orthopraxy during the holiest time of the year—Easter. We must take into consideration the consequential meaning.67 Th e previous year, Valentinian had requested use of the Portiana, which Ambrose famously refused. Presumably, the edict is a preemptive step on Valentinian’s part in anticipation of renewed protestations by Ambrose. Th e request of 386 outlines severe consequences for disobedience. To deny the right to public worship is “tantamount” to sedition under civil law, “a capital"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 217crime.”68 At the beginning of Holy Week in 386, Valentinian also requests use of the Basilica Vetus; Ambrose refuses again, protesting that “a temple of God cannot be handed over by a priest.”69 Th is time, however, the emperor will not be opposed. He dispatches the praetorian prefect Eusignius to deliver the request in person. Th e congregation, already stirred up by news of Valentinian’s appeal for use of the Basilica Vetus, meets Eusignius with an overwhelming acclamation in support of their bishop.From that moment on, the confl ict takes on a momentum that comes to engulf a much larger portion of the city’s territory and its populations. Upon hearing that imperial hangings now possessively drape the outside of the Portiana, several of Ambrose’s congregation run over to lay claim to the church by entering and occupy-ing its interior.70 Th e imperial court once again requests the Portiana, and Ambrose refuses, claiming the building’s divine status. While many of his community stage a “sit-in” in the Portiana, he spends the day in the Basilica Vetus. During this period, Ambrose receives word that members of his congregation—possibly on their way to the Portiana—have waylaid an Arian cleric they passed in the streets. Ambrose rushes to the scene to intervene and quell the Nicene crowd’s untethered rage.Th e following morning, a Wednesday, Ambrose wakes to hear that imperial troops are now surrounding the Portiana, and a new crowd of Nicene bodies begins fi lling the interior of the Basilica Nova, claiming possession over that sac-ramental space as well. Tensions are running exceedingly high in a city where imperial and ecclesiastical authority already compete; each side fears what may transpire next. News soon spreads that the imperial hangings have been torn down. Whether this is an act of deliberate rebellion or merely children playing, McLynn has observed that this falls under the rubric of seditious acts and can be met with severe punishment. Aware of the gravity of the event, Ambrose and many of his community spend the night within the Basilica Vetus. It is possible that this is the night Ambrose conducts his community in singing his hymns.71 Th e follow-ing morning the imperial court retreats miraculously and mysteriously, decamp-ing from Milan altogether. Easter week continues on without any changes.In one of his more important sermons during the basilica crisis, Ambrose declares what is at risk in surrendering the churches to the Arians. Th e church as a whole—as an ecclesiastical property—is not the only issue. Ambrose also men-tions a very specifi c aspect of the church that he cannot risk abandoning to the Arians:You observe how many trials are now suddenly launched against me. Goths, weapons, federate troops, the merchants, fi nes, and saints punished. Do you realize what is being ordered to be done when the instruction is given: “surrender the basilica”? It was the equivalent of: speak some word against God and die; and not just “speak against God” but “take action against God.” Th e instructions are “surrender the altar of God.”72"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"218 Ambrose and MilanTh is passage invites us to consider several key issues. What exactly does Ambrose understand to be the “altar of God”? What is inherently precious about this loca-tion, rendering its surrender impossible? Why is its surrender equivalent to speak-ing against God? Why is such a speech a hostile action against divinity?In De mysteriis and De sacramentis, Ambrose presents the altar as the location where a Christian is exposed to what David Frankfurter has called the “broader supernatural pantheon.”73 It is an opening directly to heaven itself. Angels stand by watching as Christians approach to touch their lips to the fl esh and blood of Christ in the Eucharist.74 Ambrose describes the altar itself as “the form of the body of Christ.”75 Th e importance of this location in the ecclesiastical space overall should not be underestimated.With that in mind, let us take a closer look at the paradoxical nature of the altar in Ambrose’s view. It is a place of irrepressible supernatural power, but also—simultaneously—a location of acute vulnerability. Divine praesentia in the Eucha-rist depends utterly on a potent, but delicate, act. A priest has to speak the words of the sacraments (verba sacramenta), and Ambrose is quick to clarify that these cannot be just any words:By what words, then, is the consecration, and by whose expressions? By those of the Lord Jesus Christ. For all the rest that were said in the preceding were said by the priest: [there is] praise to God; prayer is off ered; there is a petition for the people, for kings, for the rest. When it comes to performing a venerable sacrament, then the priest uses not his own expressions, but he uses the expressions of Christ. Th us the expressions of Christ perform this sacrament.76Ambrose is consistent in De mysteriis and De sacramentis in his explanation of the effi cacy of ritual speech.77 Th e Eucharist is performed through the spoken words of Christ (sermo Christi). Th e words of Christ are eternal and heavenly (de sacramento, coelestis sermo). When verbalized, they eff ect (operatur) the transfor-mation of the bread and wine. Ambrose concludes that the transformative power of the Eucharist as well as baptism is rooted in a priest’s invocation (invocantem) of “the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, one operation, one consecration.”78 While Ambrose’s language is straightforward, an intuitive sense of this kind of potency has been lost in the debates regarding the effi cacy of ritual speech that span several of the centuries between the fourth and the twenty-fi rst. Th erefore, to secure a comprehensive view of Ambrose’s understanding of the power inherent in sacra-mental formulae, we need to retrieve a pre-Reformation sense of ritual.In his book To Take Place, Jonathan Z. Smith ponders the signifi cance of four words: “Hoc est corpus meum.”79 Th is liturgical phrase involves the effi cacy of lan-guage and the conjunctive nature of word and thing. On the word est rests the shift from a world in which liturgical speech embodies divinity in action, transforming bread into the body of Christ, to a world that views the relation between the bread"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 219and Christ’s body as symbolic or fi gurative. We see correlative shift s in religion and history from late antique/medieval (enchanted) times to the modern (disen-chanted) period. Of course, it is not quite that simple, as the important Eucharistic debates in the Protestant Reformation indicate. With the shift in language, the enchanted (vertical) world of late antiquity defl ates and falls into our more familiar, fl attened (horizontal) social environment of symbolic expression. As Th omas Greene explains, the pre-Reformation period upholds a conjunctive notion of lan-guage (the word as dynamically tied to its referent, and, therefore, the word as an action that is capable of eff ecting material change in contrast). Beginning with the antiritualistic, antimagic tenor of the Protestant Reformation’s polemic against Catholicism, this conception slowly shift s to a disjunctive notion of language (the word as signifi er severed from signifi ed, and capable only of communicating mean-ing).80 And as Smith describes the primary issue that is our concern in the ill-fated shift from the enchanted (conjunctive) to disenchanted (disjunctive) worldview aft er the Reformation, “[R]itual is not ‘real’; rather, it is a matter of ‘signifi cation.’ ”81More importantly for our purposes, Smith continues: “Th e Protestant insistence on the emptiness of ritual has had a number of additional consequences that per-sist. Perhaps the most signifi cant aff ects the mode of the academic presentation of rituals.”82 Regardless of the period, scholars have tended to view sacramental and liturgical ritual as a mode of symbolic expression. In their view, ritual speech—and this includes Eucharistic, baptismal, and exorcistic formulae—does not actually do anything, and, hence, scholars treat it descriptively or sociologically. However, such an approach mistakes the late antique world almost in its entirety. Late antiquity is an age of ritual. Words are robust, embodied, functional objects. When uttered properly, words act as signs linked to their signifi ed and thus hold great power. Plato’s theory of verbal (and thus also ritual) effi cacy described in the Cratylus had taken root long before the troubles in Milan;83 however, the Eucharistic and baptis-mal debates of the fourth and fi ft h centuries—not to mention the wider realm of competing forms of verbal power—breathe new life into old theoretical terrain.When interpreting Ambrose’s description of the sacraments, denying ritual words/action their effi cacy, especially involving sacramental potency, is tanta-mount to pulling a veil over half the meaning of his text. In uttering these divine words—as well as the Nicene Trinitarian formula—Christians of the time invite divinity to the altar, and it readily appears, along with an entire train of the angelic host to witness the event. In light of the power of these words, the delicate act of invocation and reception of divinity calls for only those physiologically and spir-itually prepared to experience it fully. Ambrose explains in detail the suitability of those who have been recently baptized. Th ey have been scrutinized and exorcised over several weeks. Th ey have already been exposed to the Trinity’s praesentia in their baptism.84 Th e eff ect of their baptism is profound: their bodies have been cleansed; they have moved from a state of iniquity to sanctifi cation; they are rich"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"220 Ambrose and Milanin insignia; they have joined the sacerdotal race.85 Most importantly, in the weeks of rigorous ritual preparations before baptism, they have been stripped of any demonic elements that have invaded their person. Rather than off ering space for demonic habitation, they are now endowed with and embody the Holy Spirit. Because of their transformed spiritual state, they can now experience the praesen-tia as well as the potential at the altar in a way few can. Ambrose insists that they can perceive the full reality of the supernatural presence. He distinguishes sharply between sight through the eyes of the body and discernment by the spirit of the mind. Human perception is temporal; corporeal eyes can see only corporeal things. By contrast, the eyes of the heart, which have been opened through the Holy Spirit in baptism, can see eternal things. Stripped clean of the darkening forces of demons, they, and they alone, can now see the light of the sacraments.With the possibility of great power in ritual comes the discussion of potential dangers as well as vulnerabilities. In introducing Smith’s arguments regarding pre-Reformation sacramental effi cacy into the conversation, we must recognize Ambrose’s understanding regarding not only the divine powers that attend the proper invocation of sacramental formulae but also the divine spirits embodied within ritual agents. We must also consider Ambrose’s view regarding the kind of spiritual powers that may answer an invocation improperly performed. Likewise, what does Ambrose think might happen should a demonically possessed or tainted person participate in such rituals? Th e general scholarly view regarding sacramental ritual practice in late antiquity proposes that the spiritual disposition of ritual agents is irrelevant. It is certainly the case that this is the position in a number of patristic texts: the words themselves hold power regardless of the priests and baptized Christians involved. Th us scholars have presumed that, over-all ecclesiastically, the spiritual disposition of the ritual agents involved does not come into question until we reach the demonizing antiritual propaganda of the Protestant Reformation—in other words, until we reach a major rift within the Christian church.However, we must keep in mind two issues that make Reformation debates regarding sacramental effi cacy relevant to late antique Milan. First and foremost, as we have discussed throughout this book, people in late antiquity adhere, regard-less of religious beliefs and practices, to a view of a very full cosmos comprising not only benevolent but malevolent spiritual entities, as well as all the cosmologi-cal ambiguities in between. We have also discussed repeatedly the notion of a pow-erful verbal formula where the holiness of the agent aff ects the ritual. Further-more, the idea that it is only the words of the formula that matter and not the theological identity of the speaker seems somewhat confused and vague when we have texts that describe the formula of Nicene baptism and the Nicene Creed inscribed, written, tattooed, or branded on the soul/mind of the baptizand; for example, a life as an Arian would not prepare one for the Nicene Eucharistic"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 221formula. Such texts raise a variety of questions. What happens, then, when some-one who has been inscribed by the wrong creedal formula approaches a church’s altar in order to participate in the Eucharist? What kind of otherworldly entities may they invite to the altar setting if they speak the wrong words or the Arian creedal formula rather than the Nicene words? Particularly in the thirty years of heated Nicene/Arian confl ict, we may imagine the Nicenes’ fear, once small and vulnerable but growing steadily into a belief that has by now become quite strong and aggressive in its insistence, that a wrong word or a stray heretical formula can bring the devil into the Basilica Nova—again. One has to maintain a pious current of Nicene speech in the church to maintain its protective piety.Th ere is precedent in Latin Christianity for these concerns regarding sacramen-tal potency and the purity of the person involved. Much earlier, in the mid-third century, Cyprian of Carthage relates several frightening anecdotes about what will happen to impure Christians should they attempt to partake of the Eucharist before being properly reconciled with the church aft er the Decian persecution. Th e holy bread, which has been sanctifi ed with the powerful words of God and transformed into the living body of Christ, creates a torturous experience in the bodies of the lapsed:[An] older girl, already growing up, slipped in secretly among those assisting [our] sacrifi ce. It was not food that she took as much as a sword against herself, and what she swallowed might have been some deadly poison entering her breast. Aft er the fi rst spasms, struggling for breath, she began to choke and, a victim now not of the persecution but of her own crime, she collapsed in tremors and convulsions. Th e guilt which she had tried to hide did not remain long unpunished or concealed. If she had deceived man, she was made to feel the avenging hand of God.86Th e lapsed, should they attempt to partake of the Eucharist, may invite demonic possession, spontaneously lose their hearing, vomit, or violently convulse like the young woman described above. Anxiously, Cyprian asks, “How are there every day those who, refusing to do penance or to confess their guilt on their souls, become possessed by unclean spirits (immundis spiritibus adimplentur); how many are driven out of their senses in a frenzy of fury and madness?”87 In the case of demonic possession, Cyprian draws a careful, horrifying portrait of a very young female child who has been forced to take bread soaked with wine that has touched immo-lated meat. Her lapse is not of her own choosing, or of her parents’—but that of a heartless wet nurse. Nonetheless, the demons bursting inside her are just as intent on torturing her:Th e mother recovered her child. But the girl could not reveal or tell the wicked thing that had been done. . . . Th us, when the mother brought her in with her while we were off ering the Sacrifi ce, it was through ignorance that this mischance occurred. But the infant, in the midst of the faithful, resenting the prayer and the off ering we"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"222 Ambrose and Milanwere making, began to cry convulsively, struggling and tossing in a veritable brain-storm, and for all its tender age and simplicity of soul, was confessing, as if under torture, in every way it could, its consciousness of the misdeed. Moreover, when the sacred rites were completed and the deacon began ministering to those present, when its turn came to receive, it turned its little head away as if sensing the divine presence, it closed its mouth, held its lips tight, and refused to drink from the chalice. Th e deacon persisted and, in spite of its opposition, poured in some of the conse-crated chalice. Th ere followed choking and vomiting. Th e Eucharist could not remain in a body or a mouth that was defi led; the drink which had been sanctifi ed by Our Lord’s blood returned from the polluted stomach. So great is the power of the Lord, so sacred His majesty; under His light the hidden corners of darkness were laid bare, even secret crimes did not escape the priest of God.88While Cyprian’s approach to diabolizing those who are not in communion the-ologically with the church diff ers from that of Ambrose, the outcome is the same: sacramental practice ontologically marks the diff erences in theological belief. Th ose who are Nicene/not lapsed partake in sacraments without incident and, indeed, benefi t by inviting Christ’s divine presence. Th ose who are not-Nicene/lapsed are diabolized. As we have seen, Cyprian provides a startlingly graphic description of diabolization. Th e blunt and vivid demonology in Latin Christian-ity may seem somewhat surprising; however, we propose this is to be expected in light of the intensity of the Decian persecutions in Carthage. In an enchanted envi-ronment—which, of course, includes both the Eastern and the Western halves of the ancient and late ancient Mediterranean world—schismatic tensions involving ritual practice will necessarily draw deep, disturbing, diabolizing lines across com-munities. Th is is even more the case in instances of disagreement involving prac-tices concerning the sacraments, as well as in rituals that cut to the theological, cosmological, and ontological core of the Christian religion. Cyprian, for his part, is a particularly gift ed writer not only when it comes to the topic of the Eucharist, but also in the case of demons. Ambrose is also a brilliant rhetorician, and he ech-oes Cyprian in many places when speaking of the Eucharist, especially regarding the divine indwelling. Th e question of whether or to what degree he matches his Latin predecessor in drawing diabolizing lines in Milan during the basilica crisis remains.Scholars have spent several generations debating the chronology of these events, and Neil McLynn, in my view—and indeed in that of several scholars—solves several of the remaining puzzles of historiography. Moreover, McLynn situ-ates Ambrose’s speeches within a chronological sequence that allows modern readers to fully appreciate their savvy and Ambrose’s power to maneuver events to his advantage. What scholars have left relatively untouched in their discussion is the role of ritual practice. For Ambrose, how does sacramental ritual enhance and tap into the animistic environment and weave a narrative of spiritual warfare"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 223tightly around Milan, its churches, and beyond the walls of the city to inscribe a clear divide between Nicene and Arian powers? In other words, what scholars oft en leave untouched is the simple fact that this all occurred during Easter week, the holiest week of the year, a time during which the Trinitarian presence dwells in baptisteries and the Holy Spirit comes down to dwell in the bodies/souls/minds of baptizands within those baptisteries. Christians who go through this process are forever transformed. Th e question in Ambrose’s mind is, To what end?While the relics of Protasius and Gervasius as well as other relics could ensure the purity of sacramental rituals outside the city walls, Th eodosian law prevented similar measures inside Milan. In what remains, let us explore an obvious question: What, if anything, does Ambrose do to protect churches inside Milan from Arian/demonic contamination? Several scholars have exhaustively discussed the Nicenes’ eff orts to fortify their physical possession of the churches. As we have already noted, however, we are describing the need for protection against a very diff erent—though not unrelated—threat. What exactly is at stake for Ambrose if Arians—or more specifi cally Arian clergy (i.e., Auxentius)—take control of the Portiana, Basil-ica Nova, or Basilica Vetus? We fi nd a probable answer in Ambrose’s Contra Aux-entius 37 when he asks why Auxentius could possibly have considered rebaptism.89Th e issue of rebaptism already had a long history in Christianity. Most famously, Cyprian of Carthage and Stephen of Rome had debated the topic when Novatian heretics were returning to the church in the third century. Stephen contended that they did not need to be rebaptized, and argued that the laying on of hands would suffi ce. Cyprian of Carthage supported rebaptizing Novatianists who returned to the church; he claimed the Novatian baptismal ritual was ineffi cacious. While the topic of demonic possession did not enter into his discussion regarding Novatian-ists and rebaptizing, demons are at the center of his discussion of lapsed Christians and the Eucharist, as we have seen above. As Cyprian’s writings make clear, debates regarding sacramental effi cacy and demonic contamination play a role in theo-logical and ecclesiastical confl icts very much earlier than those involving anti-Catholic propagandists in the sixteenth century.It is diffi cult to say what Ambrose’s precise views are regarding rebaptism. He does not dwell on the topic. Perhaps in introducing it, he intends to reference the crisis aft er the Decian persecutions. Th at said, we have already touched on Ambro-se’s complex understanding of the power in sacramental formulae; he views the ability of ritual speech to interact with and aff ect spiritual orders as absolute. And as we have discussed, Ambrose perceives the Milanese air as pulsating with a vari-ety of spiritual entities, many of them demonic. While the Nicene church off ers space to the Trinity in baptism and in the Eucharist, Ambrose is quite clear that very diff erent kinds of spiritual beings are dwelling among Arians.Most likely, Ambrose does not view Arian rebaptism as ineff ective—quite the opposite, in fact. Instead, he is likely deeply concerned about the unintended and"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"224 Ambrose and Milandangerous spiritual consequences of rebaptism. Arians situate a heretical Trinitar-ian formula at the base of all their sacramental practices. Rather than invoking the Holy Spirit, Arians are invoking other—far less desirable—spiritual entities to inhabit the baptizand who already has a baptismal seal. In light of these potential dangers, what, if anything, can Ambrose do to protect his churches from infernal inhabitants? Let us examine Ambrose’s discussions of the rituals of baptism and closely consider his descriptions of these rituals and their ability not only to trans-form baptizands, but to cleanse, protect, and fortify ecclesiastical space.In his fi rst sermon in De sacramentis, Ambrose clarifi es the antidemonic prepa-rations that must take place in the baptistery: “For, when the priest fi rst enters, he performs the exorcism according to the creation of water”; following this, the priest engages in “an invocation and prayer that the font may be sanctifi ed and that the presence of the eternal Trinity may be at hand.”90 Before the baptizands’ entrance into the baptistery on the day of baptism, then, the proper spiritual enti-ties are in place: “Christ descended into the water, and the Holy Spirit descended as a dove; God the Father also spoke from heaven: You have the presence of the Trinity.”91 In Sacr. 2.5.14 he emphasizes that their presence is actualized by the priest’s invocation:A priest comes; he says a prayer at the font; he invokes the name of the Father, the presence of the Son and of the Holy Spirit; he uses heavenly words. Th e words are heavenly, because they are Christ’s, that we baptize “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” If, then, at the words of men, at the invocation of a holy man, the Trinity was present, how much more is the Trinity present there where eternal words operate?92When baptizands arrive in the baptistery, then, the space has been cleansed of any and all demonic elements. It is now an environment suff used with divinity. However, the priest is not the only ritual agent to cleanse and fortify the baptistery. When the baptizands enter into this space, they engage in their own ritual action, which ensures the expulsion of any lingering demonic elements. Before addressing the specifi cs of that ritual action, we must understand what kind of bodies have entered into the baptistery. As Ambrose explains in Explanatio symboli ad initian-dos, in the weeks leading up to baptism these individuals are cleansed repeatedly by scrutinies and tested by exorcisms. Th us the bodies that enter on the day of baptism itself are already demon-free and thus ready for their fi nal initiation into Nicene Christianity. At the moment of baptism, however, they transform from being the passive objects or vessels upon which or through which ritual activity occurs to active ritual agents in their own right. Th at is to say, bodies that have been repeatedly exorcised in preparation for baptism now turn to expel the devil themselves as they speak the formula of renunciation. As Ambrose declares explic-itly in Sacr. 1.5, a person enters the baptistery, turns to the east, and renounces the"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 225devil. While we can understand this as an insular ritual act, aff ecting their own persons alone, we need to keep our eyes on the ecclesiastical space in which this formula is uttered. Th us baptizands achieve exorcistic effi cacy not only to their own advantage, but over the surrounding ecclesiastical space. Th en, aft er renounc-ing the devil, they complete the baptismal ritual and receive the baptismal seal.Like the Eucharist—as well as the martyr shrine—baptism aff ords an opportu-nity for Frankfurter’s “broader supernatural pantheon” to press upon mundane reality. As an exorcistic and invocational ritual, baptism off ers an opportunity to reinstate proper spiritual order in a church that may have been compromised—at least those churches that possess baptisteries have a chance to fi nd spiritual read-justment in such rituals.In considering the protection and fortifi cation of churches within Milan, I would also consider the primary purpose of baptism during that particular Easter season: it creates Nicene Christian bodies, these bodies that have been rigorously cleansed of any aspect of the demonic—in a sense scrubbed clean ritually. In bap-tism itself they are endowed and sealed with the Holy Spirit. Th us these bodies inherently possess the means of keeping demonic containments at a distance. Th ey embody apotropaic effi cacy. Th eir presence in church functions to maintain a proper spiritual balance in ecclesiastical space.Against this backdrop, a suggestion made by McLynn, which alters the tradi-tional timeline, off ers curious possibilities. McLynn claims that aft er this Holy Week a new confl ict arises. Valentinian II’s court returns to Milan, and this time requests Ambrose’s attendance at the consistory for a debate with Auxentius on the issue of faith. In what might be described as his customary fashion at this point, Ambrose refuses and instead retreats to either the Basilica Nova or the Basilica Vetus. Soldiers soon follow to surround the basilica. McLynn argues that this is not a true siege, and tensions are not as high as earlier. As Ambrose makes clear in the Contra Auxentium, which is delivered at this time according to McLynn, doors are left unlocked and even ajar. Instead, Ambrose tries to cultivate a “siege mentality,” and this may have been the moment when Ambrose directs his congregation in antiphonal singing.93 If this is the case, it would have been an intriguing situation for the recently exorcised, now-baptized Christians, who have just partaken of the Eucharist. What kind of Christic presence do they embody when they engage in antiphonal singing? Do the baptized Christians understand their actions to be protecting the church from the diabolized forces outside it, as Ambrose and the community had long identifi ed those forces?Despite Ambrose’s attempt to transform this siege into a larger confrontation, according to McLynn the bishop’s eff orts are in vain.94 It is some weeks later, per-haps, before Ambrose is next seen in a noteworthy event, consecrating his Ambro-siana, an event that serves as the preamble to the next spectacle in this theological battle: the discovery of the relics of Protasius and Gervasius. Rather than setting"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"226 Ambrose and Milanthe events in June apart from the Holy Week crisis in the spring, let us instead consider the relic discovery as perfectly in tune with the charismatic, animistic, enchanted tonality that has been developing in Milan since the moment spiritual warfare overtook the Nicene/Arian confl ict in 355. In almost all respects, June 17 in no way diff ers from any other day. Th e diff erence here, which Ambrose himself wishes to make clear, is that the charismatic event happens just outside the city in an area consciously at odds with or in a state of otherness in relation to Milan—the cemetery—and leads to one of his churches, and inevitably to one of his altars protecting the city from outside its walls. In other words, all the locations of that day’s events stand in distinct contrast to the internal city of Milan.As for Ambrose and his congregation, we will now consider how they develop a diabolizing view of liturgical and sacramental practices that does much more than defi ne and draw in close the Arian enemy within the city—Ambrose is also protecting the city from beyond its walls through an exorcistic ring formed by his churches. When comparing how Ambrose views sacramental and exorcistic prac-tices within churches inside Milan and those just beyond the city’s walls, we can begin to grasp his powerful model of Nicene Milanese identity—one that recon-ceptualizes the relationship between Christian body (alive or relic), church, and city. First, then, let us take a brief tour of Ambrose’s churches.AMBROSE AND HIS CHURCHES BEYOND MILAN’S WALLSTh e Basilica Apostolorum (San Nazaro), whose foundation is laid in 382, stands on the southeast side of the city, outside the gate to Rome, the Porta Romana. One of the more intriguing aspects of the Apostolorum’s construction is the eff ort made to connect it closely with Constantine’s Apostoleion in Constantinople.95 First, it is built on a cross plan like its sister church in the Eastern capital; it is the fi rst of its kind in the West. Second, the Apostolorum contains relics of the apostles Andrew, Th omas, and John the Evangelist, which are placed in a silver casket whose place of origin (long in doubt) appears to have been Constantinople. Th e relics, given to Ambrose by Th eodosius, are intended to tie the church tightly to Constantine’s Apostoleion, which has had its own apostolic relics—of Luke, Andrew, and Timo-thy—since the early 350s. Th e relics are deposited in the Apostolorum on May 6, 386, under the high altar in the center bay; the signifi cance of this date will be discussed in the next section. In 395 the local martyr Nazarius is interred under a second altar. And as if this were not enough, the Apostolorum stands on the most important road to Rome, a grand, monumental street lined with columns: this is a street designated for the imperial adventus.And we may add an additional church. A medieval text describes San Dionigi as one of Ambrose’s churches. Th e basilica, which is also outside the late antique"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 227walls of the city, is allegedly constructed in 374–75, and at that time Basil of Caesa-rea sends the remains of Dionysius, who died in Cappadocia aft er being exiled in 355 CE, back to Milan for burial. As Maier is quick to point out, if the San Dionigi is indeed one of Ambrose’s churches, it falls well within the parameters of his notion of an anti-Arian church.96Th e third church, the Ambrosiana, is consecrated in the late spring of 386. It is located on the western side of the city “at the site of one of the Christian commu-nity’s most celebrated cemeteries.”97 As we will see, Ambrose designs the church as an ecclesiastical, sacramental structure taking advantage of an animated environ-ment in fl ux—the cemetery aft er all is a place of ritual power both nefarious and the most holy. By planting a church in the midst of or close to that space, Ambrose eff ectively siphons off its power. It is intended to become a mausoleum church eventually, and Ambrose is to be interred under the altar; thus the holy place will project a continual Nicene presence protecting the church and also then Milan. As we have already discussed, the relics of Protasius and Gervasius—Nicene relics—are also laid to rest under the altar. In many of his writings, Ambrose repeatedly characterizes these relics as Nicene “protectors” in the face of Arian threats.Ambrose spends several years encircling the walls of the city with what might be described as Nicene battlements. Just beyond the walls of the city, Ambrose’s churches stand tall—each church armed with the protective, holy power of the martyrs’ relics, each church equipped with the ritual power to defend the city against any enemy foolish enough to attempt to invade and corrupt Milan. Th e discovery of Protasius and Gervasius and their subsequent translatio to the Ambrosiana provides us with an unusual opportunity. In his discussion of the rel-ics’ translation to the Ambrosiana, Peter Brown (Cult of the Saints) has provided great insight: Ambrose certainly intends to forge a link between the charismatic power within a martyr shrine and the sacramental and liturgical ritual practice at the church. Following Brown’s lead, we will push further to examine closely the manner in which Ambrose and the crowd construct this kind of power for the Ambrosiana. Ambrose and the crowd participate in a delicate balance of give and take in their display of ritual power. Moreover, it is imperative that we bear in mind that their improvised ritual collaboration takes place very soon aft er an extremely volatile confl ict. Th e crisis over the basilicas brings a new, violent physi-cal reality to spiritual warfare, and this dualized manner of seeing the world will continue on in Ambrose’s congregation far past June 17.In what follows, we strive to attain a clearer image of the kind of ritual power—a diabolizing ritual power—that Ambrose locates in the church the day he deposits the relics below the altar. To that end, we closely examine the discovery and even-tual translation of Protasius and Gervasius from a point of view that is appropriate to the late fourth century: an enchanted and animistic viewpoint."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"228 Ambrose and MilanFor the most part, in the late fourth century a person’s daily activities with respect to the spiritual world remain invisible and silent. By contrast, a martyr or saint’s shrine is a confi ned location where the chaos and turmoil of the spiritual realm can punch through the relative tranquility elsewhere. Here, in the spectacles of demonic possession and exorcism, a person encounters, with a frightening and inescapable immediacy, the “broader supernatural pantheon.”98 As David Frank-furter and Peter Brown have both made clear, the experience is fundamentally transformative in a variety of ways. First of all, demoniacs “served as authenticat-ing spectacles of shrines.”99 Th ey validate or confi rm the praesentia and potentia of the holy ones. As Peter Brown explains, when encountering the torturous screams of the demon-possessed at saints’ shrines, onlookers “witnessed more clearly and with greater precision the manner in which God through his lords the saints could stretch forth into their midst the right hand of his healing power.”100 In the further words of Gregory of Tours: “In this way [demoniacs] bring home the presence of the saints of God to human minds, that there should be no doubt that the saints are present at their tombs.”101 Such experiences, Augustine tells us, are simultane-ously “miraculous and terrifying.”102 Indeed, the more disruptive the spectacle of demon possession, the more imposing the saint and his or her shrine. As we can see in Saint Paula’s reaction to Holy Land tombs attributed to some important Old and New Testament fi gures, as described in one of Jerome’s letters, such phenom-ena can have a carnivalesque air that utterly overwhelms the spectator:She shuddered at the sight of so many marvelous happenings. For there she was met by the noise of demons roaring in various torments, and, before the tombs of the saints, she saw men howling like wolves, barking like dogs, roaring like lions, hissing like snakes, bellowing like bulls; some twisted their heads to touch the earth by arch-ing their bodies backwards; women hung upside down in mid-air yet their skirts did not fall down over their heads.”103Several accounts of martyr shrines depict similarly chaotic and frightening scenes. Paulinus of Nola notes a sharp rise in the number of demoniacs surround-ing Saint Felix of Nola’s tomb on the anniversary of his death; furthermore the animalistic behavior of those demonically possessed intensifi es: “the devils ignite and blaze more fi ercely than usual. Th eir howls are more tearful.”104 In turn, Felix intensifi es their punishment: “[the demoniacs] are raised aloft and made to hover higher than usual; they are belabored in the empty spaces of the lower air, held fast with bonds invisible as they suff er this extended sojourn in the deserted heav-ens.”105 One demoniac hangs upside down next to the tomb—but, just as in Jer-ome’s account of what he says Paula experienced, his robe stays up, covering his genitals.106 Gregory of Tours describes a demoniac named Paulus who enters the small church next to Saint Martin’s tomb. Paulus suddenly climbs the raft ers above the altar; aft er screaming that his body is on fi re, he fl ings himself down toward"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 229the ground. Amazingly he is unhurt.107 Spectacles such as these serve to showcase the exorcising tortures that the possessing demons suff er in the presence of the saints. Desiderius, a demoniac who travels to Saint Martin’s shrine, spends a night in a nearby cell screaming and “raving madly.” In the morning he “began to shout that the blessed Martin was burning him.” Soon thereaft er he vomits “unfamiliar pus and blood”—a clear sign that the demon has been expelled. Desiderius departs a sane and rational man.108 Th ese extreme performances easily ignite spectators’ imagination; people can almost see the invisible saints abusing the demons who cling tightly—and ultimately in vain—to their victims’ bodies. As Victricius of Rouen describes the phenomenon: “A torturer bends over the unclean spirit, but is not seen. Th ere are no chains here now, yet the being who suff ers is bound. God’s anger has other hooks to tear the fl esh and other racks to stretch invisible limbs.”109In the presence of a holy martyr or saint, the revelation of demonic possession can be abrupt and alarming. As Peregrine Horden has noted, it is the approach to the shrine that oft en exposes an otherwise-unrealized demonic possession.110 Sto-ries abound: “A man visiting St. Artemios’s shrine in Constantinople for a testicu-lar condition turns out also to have an ‘evil spirit’ which leads him to hang sus-pended before the icon of Artemios as though his hand were tied by chains, hovering one cubit above the fl oor, and yelling loudly, so that all . . . were aston-ished by the sight and were cowed by fear.”111 Gregory of Tours relates the story of a man who builds a church for Saint Julian in Rheims; as the man is traveling through a fi eld with the relics for the new church, he passes a plowman who “began to be horribly tormented and to speak as if he had lost his mind.” It is clear imme-diately that this plowman suff ers from demonic possession.112 Similar examples of spontaneous possessions appear in ethnographies of modern exorcism cults. In the course of his work on the Catholic site of Kudagama in Sri Lanka, R. L. Stirrat met a woman by the name of Mary who had suff ered from arthritis for years. Hearing of the curative powers of the Catholic holy site Kudagama, she travels with her husband to seek relief. Aft er receiving a blessing from Father Jayamanne she “collapsed, writhing on the fl oor of the Mission House, screaming and sob-bing.” Th e priest diagnoses what he surmises to be a clear-cut case of demonic possession. Th is leads to an extreme shift in Mary’s self-perception. She begins to identify many other ailments in accordance with the priest’s original discernment of demonic possession; she also regularly visits Kudagama for the next decade.113In his important discussion of demonic possession, David Frankfurter has encouraged recognition of the power and agency that the demoniac possesses in these spectacles.114 A person’s performance of demonic possession and expulsion oft en occurs unaided by exorcists; the violent physicality of these events off ers very convincing evidence of the holiness of a saint’s shrine. Indeed, as Brown had observed much earlier, demoniacs are rarely at a loss for words in these situations. From the mouths of deceitful demons emerge truthful confessions, which oft en"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"230 Ambrose and Milanserve to confi rm the holiness of a saint. Let’s recall our demon-possessed plowman near Rheims. Not only does his behavior alert those around him to his possessed state; he also begins shouting in a manner that is alarming and bewildering to his fellow fi eld-workers: “Behold, the most blessed Julian is approaching! Behold his power! Behold his glory!” Praise soon devolves to screams of agony as the demon begs, “Saint, why do you torment me so? Glorious martyr, why do you infl ame me? Why are you approaching a region that is not indebted to you?”115Demoniacs, then, in their behavioral and verbal performances, exert a great deal of power and control in the construction of holy topography. Frankfurter has noted that the performance of demonic possession and expulsion, as a mode of religious knowledge production, is anchored deeply within complexities of a local context. In his words, “Spirit possession [is] explicitly linked to historical uncer-tainty or . . . to larger confl icts about the locus of the holy in Christian landscape.”116 In recognizing demoniacs as agents, we must also appreciate their relationship with an audience and exorcists in the “performative shaping” of demonic posses-sion and expulsion. Each agent contributes to a delicately improvised choreogra-phy that never strays far from the situational aspects of their immediate environ-ment. I would take this further and argue that their collaborative performance can accomplish much more than the validation of contested holiness in a specifi c loca-tion. Th e engrossing give-and-take performance of demonic possession and exor-cism can be precisely and subtly maneuvered to speak directly to socioreligious, theological, and political confl icts as well—for example, the Nicene-versus-Arian confl ict in Milan in 386.By way of example, let us off er the story of Nicole Obry, a girl of only sixteen, who begins exhibiting signs of possession soon aft er she is married in sixteenth-century France. Nicole’s parents take her to the Dominican father Pierre de la Motte, whose “probative exorcisms” confi rm her possessed state. If the story had ended here, we would have another run-of-the-mill possession during what the historian Sarah Ferber has called a “possession boom” in the Catholic Church.117 However, a relationship forms between Obry and La Motte during these initial rituals that elevates the potential meaning and function of demonic possession to a new level. From November 1565 to August 1566 the two travel together, perform-ing repeated exorcisms of Obry in very public venues. In the process, as Ferber has noted, they construct a complex schema of demonic possession that off ers “a new and potentially powerful propaganda weapon in a time of the intense hostility between French Catholics and the Calvinist Huguenots.”118 Moving from the church in Vervins through various holy shrines to the fi nal destination of the bish-op’s church in Laon, the two perfect the performance of demonic possession and exorcism in behavioral and verbal aspects to promote the Catholic Church. Th e demons confess repeatedly that their possession is due to the sins of Huguenots; likewise, their public exorcism serves to convert Huguenots from their stubborn"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 231blindness. Th e demons are conveniently explicit regarding Huguenot stupidity as well as the importance of the Catholic Church’s Eucharist. Needless to say, these public displays draw huge crowds; and the clergy takes advantage of them to pro-mote the curative properties inherent in the Catholic Eucharist as well as to warn of the spiritual dangers of Huguenot beliefs.By the time the spectacle takes the stage at the bishop’s church in Laon, a great controversy regarding the validity of the possessions is also beginning. Th is con-troversy further exacerbates the divide between the Catholic Church and the Huguenots. Unsurprisingly, many Huguenots claim Obry is a fraud. Others try to exorcise her with their own exorcisms. Rising tensions lead to her arrest and imprisonment for a period of time; at one point her life is even threatened by Huguenots. La Motte suff ers similar hardships. During all of this, the possession/exorcism performances still cleave to party lines. Consequently, in the case of Nicole Obry, we not only have a case of demonic possession and exorcism that serves to demonstrate the holiness of a particular site or individual. We also have an example of how, in the deft hands of a politically embroiled priest and a charis-matically sensitive young woman, a demoniac’s performances can have a polemi-cal edge, deepening the divide between Christian groups in rather theologically sophisticated ways.MAKING MILANESE MARTYRS AND NICENE DEMONIACSSoon aft er the mysterious bones are unearthed that day outside of Milan in 386, a frenzy takes hold of the crowd. Bodies writhe in pain, and their possessing demons testify to invisible tortures that the martyrs Protasius and Gervasius are infl icting on them. As people watch demoniacs reveal themselves, several more begin to shout in agony of the torment they too are enduring. Th e experience is too much to bear, causing the demon in each of the possessed to “speak unwillingly under duress and torment.”119 In addition to confi rming the power of Protasius and Gervasius, the demons have this to say: “No one can be saved unless he believes in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, . . . [and] he is dead and buried who denies the Holy Spirit and does not believe in the omnipotence of the Trinity.” Indeed, the martyrs infl ict such tortures that the demons declare an unexpected curse on those surrounding them in the crowd: “Let the person who denies the divinity of the Holy Spirit be tortured as he [each demon] was by the martyrs.”Who are these demon-possessed individuals who are conveniently confessing the orthodoxy of Nicene theology and cursing its disbelievers—that is, Arians—who are condemning them to demonic torture? Unlike the accounts of the demon possession/exorcisms at St. Felix in Nola or St. Artemius outside of Constantino-ple, where identities remain unclear, we actually have a good idea who these"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"232 Ambrose and Milanindividuals are and, more importantly, the shape of their experiences during the months, indeed years, before the event. During the crisis that spring, Ambrose had found ample support in a surprisingly zealous congregation. Nicenes had risen up spontaneously, according to Ambrose, into an acclamation denying Eusignius’s request for the Portiana. A number of them, independently of Ambrose, had run to the Portiana to occupy it. In their fervor they had come quite close to killing an Arian priest. Ambrose had had to intervene immediately to save the poor cleric’s life. Finally, many had stayed close to Ambrose as he occupied the churches not once but twice. Th e same supportive congregants would have been among those calling for a search for martyrs to adorn the Ambrosiana. We may safely assume that many of these congregants are accompanying Ambrose as he walks as if in a trance to the Nabor and Felix shrine. In other words, Ambrose discovers the bones while surrounded by battle-worn Nicenes—members of his own congregation who have already spent months fi ghting desperately against an anti-Nicene menace. Th is is a group of people indoctrinated in the perform-ance of dramatic, zealous, and spontaneous action in an eff ort to defeat the Arian enemy.While Ambrose’s description of demonic possessions and exorcisms is brief, it is likely an understatement to say that the performances are quite dramatic. For two days, demons scream as they endure the martyrs’ unrelenting tortures. Th e absorbing scene of demonic possession and exorcism induces increasing numbers to realize and express their own possessed state. And yet through all of this, Arians stubbornly resist the seduction of spectacle. Indeed, those audience members pro-test vehemently: “Th ese are not martyrs, nor can they torment the devil nor free anyone. . . . Th e torments of the devils are not real; they are feigned and empty mockery.”120 Arian protestation and denial could have caused a breakdown in the performance of demonic possession. Instead, Ambrose deft ly leverages the skepti-cism of the Arians to advance a more expansive truth: “I have heard of many things being imagined, but no one could ever feign this and pretend that he was a devil. What is it which we see so disturbs [Arians] on whom a hand is laid? Where is there room for deceit? Where is there a trace of pretense?”121Rather than respond to the Arians’ protestations of deception, Ambrose turns the tables in a way that is devastating to their cause. Why can Arians not perceive the spiritual reality exposed in this spectacle? Why can they not see beyond the veil to the praesentia of martyrs, and more importantly the potentia of the martyrs over the demons? Why are they blind to the kind of torture Victricius of Rouen describes? What, in other words, is wrong spiritually/ontologically with, and sen-sorily broken within, the Arian Christians? Th e discovery of the relics of Protasius and Gervasius discloses an incontrovertible diff erence between the two warring factions. While Ambrose and his fellow Nicenes shudder at the exposure of demons and devils in the wake of the relic discovery, Arians see only men and"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 233women screaming and contorting their bodies in a ridiculous display. While Nicenes cheer at the potentia of Protasius and Gervasius, Arians see only bloody bones. What accounts for this Arian blindness? Th e Arians, according to pro-Nicene sources, provide their own answer, claiming the entire spectacle is a hoax and that those claiming demonic possession are only pretending. Somewhat iron-ically, this view has determined the major direction of modern interpretation. However, if we take a moment to consider Ambrose’s words to his sister, we dis-cover a much diff erent answer. He suggests that the Arians’ condition is rooted in a theological deviation that has had grave ontological consequences. What one sees and how one performs in front of the relics indicates one’s theological identity. To “see” the Nicene reliquary power and react in kind is to demonstrate one’s Nicene credentials; to fail to notice or, worse yet, cry foul is to reveal one’s Arian-ism and one’s own form of demonic taint (spiritual blindness, spiritual dumbness). Both the demoniacs and the naysaying Arians are demonically possessed during those two days; it is simply the case that they suff er from diff erent expressions of demonic possession. In eff ect, the events that unfold from the discovery of Nicene relics force Arians to stand in front of Nicene sacramental power—and display their tainted state. By contrast, Nicene bodies—“Nicene” and therefore presuma-bly exorcised, baptized, having partaken of the Eucharist—contain a remnant of divine presence. Th ey are not only protected from demonic corruption, but they also have the ability to discern the spiritual reality before their eyes.Not only do such circumstances indicate the spiritual defi ciency of those who hold Arian beliefs, but Ambrose also suggests that Arians are more susceptible to demonic danger than Nicenes, who can discern spiritual realities more clearly. And Arians in particular are not safe standing before these relics. Aft er all, demons recently expelled from bodies still linger at the site; they are now searching for Arian bodies to inhabit (an interpretation based on Matt. 12:43–45). As demons look about, their recently uttered confessions and curses echo in the mouths of new demoniacs directing them to the Arian bodies that they should now inhabit. While Ambrose only implies this danger, Paulinus develops it fully in his account of Arians in Valens’s court who reject the authenticity of the relics:But God, who usually increases grace for His Church, did not long suff er His saints to be insulted. Th us, one of the number, suddenly possessed by an unclean spirit, began to cry out that those were tortured as he himself was tortured who denied the martyrs or who did not believe the unity of the Trinity as Ambrose was teaching. But they, confused by this statement, although they ought to have been converted and to have done penance worthy of such confession, killed the man by immersing him in a pond, thus adding murder to heresy; for a fi tting urgency led them to this end. Indeed, the holy bishop Ambrose, having become a man of greater humility, pre-served the grace given him by the Lord and increased daily in faith and in love before God and man.122"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"234 Ambrose and MilanAft er the discovery of Protasius and Gervasius, performances of demon posses-sion and exorcism take on a defi nitive shape in the “memories and anxieties of the local sphere.”123 Ambrose and the Milanese demoniacs assume a collaborative role as producers of socioreligious and theological knowledge that is local and polemi-cally edged. Th eir performance defi nes the unidentifi ed bones as holy relics of revered Nicenes that exorcise demons only from those willing to cling to Nicene faith; likewise, the demoniacs’ confessions of Nicene truth construct a new form of demonic possession that threatens only Arians.Ambrose places the martyrs inside the Ambrosiana and refers to them as guards and protectors. But in light of the theological shape of their exorcistic ability—as defi ned by the phenomena of demonic possessions—we should see in his actions much more than the utilization of local religious practice and belief in advancing his ecclesiastical agenda. Rather, the reburial of the relics in the Ambro-siana should be read as a much more ritually sophisticated move than simply locating charismatic power in his Nicene church. Th us we must attend to the exact location in the church Ambrose indicates. Th e relics are not to reside in a side chapel within the Ambrosiana, but at its liturgical center. Th is raises several impor-tant questions. What, if anything, does Ambrose intend by bringing exorcising anti-Arian “protectors,” “guardians,” “Christian soldiers,” to the liturgical center of his church? What exactly are these bones protecting or defending? More impor-tantly, what is the threat? While the reburial of the relics in the Ambrosiana has received much attention, the signifi cance of their precise location has not. But this is an important aspect to consider. By placing the bones in this location, Ambrose is engaging in a very unusual sacramental practice. Th is surely has important con-sequences for his understanding of the ritualized relationship between baptized Christian bodies and Nicene churches throughout the city. No matter what hap-pens there will always be a powerful, exorcistic Nicene body at the sacramental center of the Ambrosiana; Protasius and Gervasius will maintain the spiritual purity of the Ambrosiana against any threat of Arian infection. Priests will always be able to perform the Eucharist in this church, bringing about the presence of the Trinity, and thus the church itself will serve as a protective bulwark for the city of Milan. Ambrose’s sacramental innovation brings a sense of closure to a confl ict that had begun in Milan thirty years earlier—a crisis that has revolved around the question, Which theological faction has the physical possession of Milan’s churches? Ambrose develops the sacramental means whereby the boundaries ostensibly separating a Nicene Christian body, a church, and a city may begin to blur and even disappear, and thus he creates a way of protecting all three simulta-neously and through reciprocal ritual action. Th at is, a baptized Christian’s utter-ance of the statement of renunciation banishes the devil from the church alto-gether; likewise the Eucharist performed at the church’s altar brings the cleansing and protective power of the Trinity to Christians within the church as well as"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 235the church itself; and that power radiates out from the churches to protect the entire city.SOME FINAL REMARKSCity of Demons comparatively investigates urban ecclesiastical demonology. Th us, this book represents an initial attempt to recover the animistic and enchanted dimensions of embodied existence in the post-Constantinian city and is part of a larger hermeneutical project to overcome certain obstacles in the interpretation of late antiquity. While the mere mention of animism still raises the fearful spector of E. B. Tylor for some, others are working to sever ties between animism and the determinative power of social Darwinism.For example, Robin Horton refurbishes animism considerably in his analysis of African spirit-possession cults.124 More recently the anthropologists Tim Ingold and Nurit Bird-David note where this concept facilitates our understanding of embodied experience and epistemologies in local situations.125 Robert Orsi also approaches this issue in his consideration of the discomfort Catholics feel living in Western modernity: How can they express the charismatic aspects of their religion in a supposedly disenchanted, secular existence?126 In what remains, we will dis-cuss how these questions and Orsi’s response shape our interpretive approach throughout City of Demons and beyond.As Orsi correctly insists, Catholic experiences of the supernatural (such as the visitation of Lourdes) possess a “radical presence” or “realness.” Th is diff erentiated sensibility renders the immediate experience vigorously consequential in the decoding of culture, social issues, and history as well.127 Such experiences have the power to alter one’s situation radically. Our modern methods and modes of histo-riography and epistemology, however, reductively label such events and moments as childlike fears, anxiety, delusions, even hallucinations. Modern modes of criti-cal knowledge have robbed “presence,” as Orsi frames the concept, of its power—most crucially its power to transform. Seeking a solution, Orsi looks for a historio-graphical style that refl ects a radical empiricism of visible and invisible events. He seeks to recapture the “radical presence” or “realness”—i.e., that sudden disruptive burst of animistic phenomena into our normative disenchanted existence—that modern historical study has exiled to the fringes of rational society.Orsi suggests the phrase “abundant event” to narrow his search for any exam-ples of overlooked or neglected moments of supernatural experience.128 In his con-ceptualization of an abundant historiography, Orsi has provided a means of resolv-ing many of the interpretive dilemmas we face in our own project. We have chosen three of Orsi’s clusters of interpretive principles to undergird our own approach; they enable City of Demons to largely overcome what Orsi derides as “the safe categories of modernist historiography.”129 Th us we are able to capture a deeper"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"236 Ambrose and Milansense of the culture of suprahuman presence and power within Antioch, Jerusa-lem, and Milan through our own historiographic method; moreover, the heavily animated moments of spiritual warfare in each of these locations draw special attention. In what remains, we will discuss the guidance Orsi’s three principles off er in City of Demons and beyond.First Orsi’s “abundant event” (i.e., similar but not limited to our spiritual-war-fare event) off ers a “focusing lens for the intricacies of relationships in a particular area at a particular time.”130 In other words, a moment of radical presence (of the demonic versus the divine, for instance) abruptly captures and then deeply enhances all details of present social relationships; we can then attend to how such an animated ritual exposes the contingent elements that hold together social webs. Th ese moments also expose the diff erences, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities that pull relationships apart.Second, Orsi explains that place and time bleed into each other fl uidly under the sway of an abundant event; in his words, “the ordinary levels and domains of experience are dissolved into each other.”131 City of Demons considers how an ani-mated event (of spiritual warfare or some other kind of ritual act) aff ects moments of linear time. How do the past, the present, and the future overlap and fold into one another? What infl uence does such a fl exibility in place and time hold over the relationships involved? We explored this point in depth when we considered Cyril of Jerusalem and his apocalyptic worldview.Finally, an abundant event may unlock the mind and unleash the power of an expanded imagination. According to Orsi, “people are more accessible to each other (for good and for ill) in devotional culture, the boundaries of their bodies, minds, and souls less secure.”132 For our purposes this is perhaps Orsi’s most important point as we continue to consider how such moments in late antiquity draw into question a central conceit of modernity: the indivisibility and separate-ness of the self. Analogously, a spiritual-warfare event—and indeed any ritual event directly involving animated forces—forcefully interrogates the integrity of the late antique body. All lingering sense of a self-contained, stable identity explodes in the face of a demonic-divine encounter. Th is pertains especially in the cases of John’s Antioch and Ambrose’s Milan.We are hard pressed to fi nd scholarship that investigates religion in a manner inclusive of late antiquity’s enchanted worldview and related animisms. As inter-preters native to the twenty-fi rst century, despite an emerging awareness of the enchanted elements of our own world, we are still largely comfortable in interpret-ing and discussing what are for the most part secular, disenchanted lives. We are familiar and at ease with the stable agency of our individuated, autonomous selves. In general, we do not spend our days dreading an infl ux or invasion of the sur-rounding environment through our porous materiality into our own subjective core. So, then, examining and writing about the perceived reality and embodied"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Ambrose and Nicene Demoniacs 237knowledge of devils and demons in the late antique city is hardly an intuitive practice. By considering Christians’ embodied experience of demons in the late antique city and the sense of ritual agency and power that Christians develop in such experiences, City of Demons functions fi rst and foremost as an initial foray into a more involved exploration into the deeper complexities of late antiquity’s experiential reality. Consequently, our historiographical style refl ects ongoing interpretive challenges: a style that depends heavily upon vivid description and speculation as much as it requires an intermingling of both the material and textual evidence."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"239ABull Th e Art BulletinACW Ancient Christian WritersAHR American Historical ReviewAIPHOS Annuaire de l’Institut de philologie et d’histoire orientales et slavesAJA American Journal of ArchaeologyAJS American Journal of SociologyANF Ante-Nicene FathersANRW Aufstieg and Niedergang der römischen WeltAnTard Antiquité TardiveAQ Anthropological QuarterlyARelG Archiv für ReligionsgeschichteASH Ancient Society and HistoryASR American Sociological ReviewAug AugustinianumAZK Arbeiten zur KirchengeschichteBAH Bibliothèque archéologique et historiqueBAR Biblical Archaeology ReviewBEFAR Bibliothèque des Écoles françaises d’Athènes et de RomeBHAW Blackwell History of the Ancient WorldBMCR Bryn Mawr Classical ReviewBSOAS Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African StudiesBWANT Beiträge zur Wissenschaft vom Alten und Neuen TestamentByzA Byzantina Australiensia abbreviations"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"240 abbreviationsCA Classical AntiquityCCSL Corpus Christianorum Series LatinaCH Church HistoryCP Classical PhilologyCQ Classical QuarterlyCR Classical ReviewCSCO Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum OrientaliumCSECELT Cambridge Studies in Eighteenth-Century English Literature and Th oughtCSEL Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum LatinorumCSMLT Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Th oughtCSSCA Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural AnthropologyCAnth Current AnthropologyDACL Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgieDi DialogDOP Dumbarton Oaks PapersECF Early Church FathersETL Ephemerides Th eologicae LovaniensesFC Fathers of the ChurchGCS Die griechischen christlichen Schrift steller der ersten [drei] JahrhunderteGRBS Greek, Roman, and Byzantine StudiesHTR Harvard Th eological ReviewHTS Harvard Th eological StudiesICS Illinois Classical StudiesIEJ Israel Exploration JournalJAAR Journal of the American Academy of ReligionJAC Jahrbuch für Antike und ChristentumJACSup Jahrbuch für Antike und Christentum SupplementsJANER Journal of Ancient Near Eastern ReligionsJCR Journal of Contemporary ReligionJECH Journal of Early Christian HistoryJECS Journal of Early Christian StudiesJEH Journal of Ecclesiastical HistoryJHG Journal of Historical GeographyJHSex Journal of the History of SexualityJHS Journal of Hellenic StudiesJIH Journal of Interdisciplinary HistoryJLAntiq Journal of Late AntiquityJMEMS Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"abbreviations 241JNES Journal of Near Eastern StudiesJPICL Th e Joan Palevsky Imprint in Classical LiteratureJQR Jewish Quarterly ReviewJR Journal of ReligionJRA Journal of Roman ArchaeologyJRASup Journal of Roman Archaeology SupplementsJRS Journal of Roman StudiesJRSMono Journal of Roman Studies MonographsJSAH Journal of the Society of Architectural HistoriansJSJ Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman PeriodsJSNT Journal for the Study of the New TestamentJSNTSup Journal for the Study of the New Testament Supplement SeriesJSP Journal for the Study of the PseudepigraphaJSPSup Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha SupplementsJTS Journal of Th eological StudiesLCC Library of Christian ClassicsLCL Loeb Classical LibraryLNSAS Leicester-Nottingham Studies in Ancient SocietyNovTSup Supplements to Novum TestamentumNPNF1 Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series 1NPNF2 Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series 2NRSV New Revised Standard Version (Bible)NTS New Testament StudiesOCA Orientalia Christiana AnalectaOCM Oxford Classical MonographsOECS Oxford Early Christian StudiesOECT Oxford Early Christian TextsPG Patrologia Graeca (= Patrologiae Cursus Completus, Series Graeca, ed.

I have made this choice for the sake of consistency. I have also made this choice due to the fact that we are primarily working within a Christian demonological and thus dualistic context. In the non-Christian context, a daimon’s place on the moral scale depends to a great degree on its relationship with a ritual practitioner: for example, a person may invoke the aid of a (benevolent) daimon for protection, or a person may attempt to exorcize a (malevolent) daimon from another person. In short, there is a greater range of possible meanings for the term daimon and related terms (e.g., pneuma) in the Greco-Roman world of ritual practice and belief. However, this book considers ecclesiastical leaders’ use of daimones (and related supernatural entities) to Christianize and diabolize an urban setting. In this context, daimones and so forth are consistently “demonized” or margin-alized as a monstrous other. It is almost impossible to fi nd a solution that perfectly satisfi es from a semantic point of view. Th e words demon/demons are hardly perfect; nonetheless we will use these terms consistently to try to capture Christian authors’ intended meaning.1.

In this case, he describes sacramental, charismatic identity intensifi ed by the exorcistic power of martyr relics. notes"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"246 Notes to Pages 1–23. Christians are hardly the fi rst and certainly not the only religious or cultural group in late antiquity to conceptualize a demonology based in Stoic foundations; see Keimpe Algra, “Stoics on Souls and Demons: Reconstructing Stoic Demonology,” in Body and Soul in Ancient Philosophy, ed. Dorothea Frede and Burkhard Reis (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2009), 359–87; also available in Demons and the Devil in Ancient and Medieval Christianity, ed.

I take the term “diabolization” in its Christian context directly from the work of Birgit Meyer, Translating the Devil: Religion and Modernity among the Ewe in Ghana (Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press, 1999). See also Birgit Meyer, “Beyond Syncretism: Translation and Diabolization in the Appropriation of Protestantism in Africa,” in Syncretism/Anti-syncretism: Th e Politics of Religious Synthesis, ed. Charles Stewart and Rosalind Shaw (Lon-don and New York: Routledge, 1994), 45–68; and Birgit Meyer, “Modernity and Enchant-ment: Th e Image of the Devil in Popular African Christianity,” in Conversion to Modernities: Th e Globalization of Christianity, ed. Peter van der Veer (London and New York: Routledge, 1996), 199–230.6. I have in mind here Jonathan Z. Smith’s important article “Towards Interpreting Demonic Powers in Hellenistic and Roman Antiquity,” ANRW 2.16.1 (1978): 425–39, esp. 429, in which he refers to the demonic as a “relational or labeling term.” For straightforward examples of Jonathan Z. Smith’s theorization of the demonic in the study of early Christian exorcistic practice, see Elizabeth A. Leeper, “From Alexandria to Rome: Th e Valentinian Connection to the Incorporation of Exorcism as a Prebaptismal Rite,” VC 44.1 (1990): 6–24; also Elizabeth A. Leeper, “Th e Role of Exorcism in Early Christianity,” StPatr 26 (1993): 59–62. Smith’s “demonic” category fi gures prominently in Eric Sorensen’s Possession and Exorcism in the New Testament and Early Christianity, WUNT 2.157 (Tübingen: Mohr Sie-beck, 2002), 12; Sorensen uses the “demonic” category in what is ultimately a genealogical approach to the study of early Christian exorcism. He (1–17) also emphasizes the value inherent in a cultural anthropological approach, which emphasizes the culturally and his-torically contingent and local context of exorcistic beliefs and practices, as well as notions of demonology and possession and the manner in which these categories structure com-munal knowledge and potential behavioral patterns in the actual performance of an exor-cism. See also, for example, Erika Bourguignon, Possession, Chandler & Sharp Series in Cross-Cultural Th emes (San Francisco: Chandler & Sharp, 1976), 79. A popular trajectory within this approach is the consideration of local (and/or historical) categories of illness and health as well as purity and pollution, which also serve as inculcating and socializing structures in an exorcistic event. Such an approach has held special appeal for scholars who have considered the relation between healing miracles and exorcisms in the New Tes-tament and early Christian material: for example, John J. Pilch, Healing in the New Testa-ment: Insights from Medical and Mediterranean Anthropology (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2000). Sorensen himself shrewdly cleaves to scholarship in which methodology (anthropology) dominates and the object of study (in this case, the New Testament) is a secondary interest. A number of these works are reactionary, so much so that at times the integrity of the scholarship is transparently compromised by a confessional undercur-rent and a vested interest in an Historical Jesus agenda. Th us, for instance, it is hardly surprising that regarding the relationship of Jesus’s exorcisms to categories of magic and"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 2–7 247miracle, Sorensen altogether neglects the scholarship of Howard Clark Kee, Medicine, Mir-acle and Magic in New Testament Times, SNTSMS 55 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986).7. I have chosen to focus on issues of diabolization and thus ritual practices in urban Christianization in the fi rst few generations just aft er the Constantinian era for a strategic purpose: to determine the impact of the “Constantinian revolution” on material urban Christianity, particularly as regards the continuation, if not intensifi cation, of charismatic ecclesiology. Regarding the Constantinian revolution and an enduring charismatic ecclesi-ology, see Claudia Rapp, Holy Bishops in Late Antiquity: Th e Nature of Christian Leadership in an Age of Transition, TCH 37 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005), 6–16.8.

See also Karen O’Brien, Narratives of Enlighten-ment: Cosmopolitan History from Voltaire to Gibbon, CSECELT 34 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997).17. Gibbon’s narrative of decline provides a foundation for a subsequent positivist his-torical approach to the study of the city in ancient and late Roman studies: for example, M. I. Rostovtzeff , Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire (Oxford: Clarendon 1926); A. H. M. Jones, Th e Greek City from Alexander to Justinian (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940); compare the much earlier and foundational Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, La cité antique: Étude sur le culte, le droit, les institutions de la Grèce et de Rome, 26th ed. (repr., Paris: Hachette, 1920), which focuses on religious cult in the city; translated as Fustel de Coulanges, Th e Ancient City: A Study on the Religion, Laws, and Institutions of Greece and Rome, trans. Willard Small (Boston: Lee & Shepard, 1874). See also Arnaldo Momigliano, “Th e Ancient City of Fustel de Coulanges,” in Essays in Ancient and Modern Historiography (1977; repr., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), 325–43; originally published as “La città antica di Fustel de Coulanges,” Rivista storica italiana 82 (1970): 81–90.18. For example, Rostovtzeff in particular has argued that outside religious infl uence weakens civic integrity. He includes among these outside infl uences the diff erent forms of Christianity as well as Manichaeanism, Judaism, and other Orientalizing forms of corrupt-ing religiosity; his work in Dura-Europos certainly shaped his views.19. Most notably, e.g., A. A. Barb, “Th e Survival of Magic Arts,” in Th e Confl ict between Paganism and Christianity in the Fourth Century, ed. Arnaldo Momigliano, Oxford-Warburg Studies (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), 100–125.20. For a prominent example of misplaced bias against magical thinking and supersti-tion, see Barb, “Th e Survival of Magic Arts.” Also see Ramsay MacMullen, Enemies of the Roman Order: Treason, Unrest, and Alienation in the Empire (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1966), who describes the excessive practice of magic and sorcery as an indication of the empire’s decline; cf.

For the concept of the death of rationality (intellectualism, science, philosophy) and the rise of irrationality, see Gilbert Murray, Five Stages of Greek Religion: Studies Based on a Course of Lectures Delivered in April 1912 at Columbia University, 2nd ed. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1930), who argues for"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 8–9 249the decline of Greek philosophy from the third century BCE through to mystery religions, and, in a chapter entitled “Th e Failure of Nerve,” describes Christianity as the fi nal fall—in other words, a drop from the heights of Greek rationality and humanism to the irrationality of religious belief. Also see André-Jean Festugière, La révélation d’Hermès Trismégiste, vol. 1, L’ astrologie et les sciences occultes (Paris: Gabalda, 1944), and his Les moines d’Orient, vol. 1, Culture ou sainteté: Introduction au monachisme oriental (Paris: Cerf, 1961), quoting Gilbert Murray’s “failure of nerve” in his description of the decay of religions (21).

Dodds, Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety: Some Aspects of Religious Experience from Marcus Aurelius to Constantine, Wiles Lectures, Queens University, Belfast (1963) (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965).21. For a quite well-known, sweeping statement that generalizes this historical epoch from the early imperial to the late Roman Empire, see Dodds, Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety, 2–7, who characterizes the late Roman world as suff ocating in an “age of anxiety”—a pervasive feeling generated by the population’s shared fears over barbarian invasion and concern for the state of one’s eternal soul. Th e following few titles suggest how widespread the decline/fall perspective has been: e.g., J. B.

Brown dis-cusses demons usually in connection with the holy man’s ability to protect the average Christian. In the early 2000s, and especially in reference to the thirty-year anniversary of Brown’s “Th e Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity,” a number of articles, published symposia, and special volumes in journals were published: e.g., J.

Brown returns to the phrase “charismatic ombudsman” in his Society and the Holy in Late Antiquity (1982; repr., Berke-ley: University of California Press, 1989), 182, where he certainly off ers a much more gener-ous view of an enchanted world in his discussion of the shift ing manifestation of the holy. Locating manifestations of the holy/divine in the urban area—which Brown covers elegantly—is not what is at issue. Th e problem still remains when speaking of powerful ritual agents who actively fi ght against the unholy/demonic in the urban public sphere. Others have followed Brown’s lead in deploying the holy man to criticize Gibbon’s decline perspective; for example, the anthropologist R. L. Stirrat owes his model of a holy man to Peter Brown’s work: “Sacred Models,” Man, n.s. 19.2 (1984): 199–215, esp. 211–14; R. L. Stirrat, Power and Religiosity in a Post-colonial Setting: Sinhala Catholics in Contemporary Sri Lanka, CSSCA 87 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992). Also see Robert Bonfi l, History and Folklore in a Medieval Jewish Chronicle: Th e Family Chronicle of Ahima’az ben Paltiel, Studies in Jewish History and Culture 22 (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 35–36, who attends more to Peter Brown’s “Th e Saint as Exemplar in Late Antiquity,” Representations 2 (1983): 1–25, esp. 9, which projects a saint as a model of morality to emulate rather than as a “char-ismatic ombudsman.” Within the study of late antique Christianity, it is almost too diffi cult to list the number of scholars infl uenced by Brown who have also examined the holy ascetic; one scholar in particular who has examined the Egyptian holy man from a standpoint of ritual power is David Frankfurter: for one of many examples, see David Frankfurter, “Syn-cretism and the Holy Man in Late Antique Egypt,” JECS 11.3 (2003): 339–85.26. Th e bibliography of late antique cities, stretching over the past four decades, has become quite vast; I can off er only a few examples: John Curran, Pagan City and Christian Capital: Rome in the Fourth Century, OCM (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2000); Clive Foss, Ephesus aft er Antiquity: A Late Antique, Byzantine, and Turkish City (1979; repr., Cam-bridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010); Christopher Haas, Alexandria in Late Antiquity:"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Notes to Page 11 251Topography and Social Confl ict, ASH (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997); Helmut Koester, ed., Ephesos, Metropolis of Asia: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Its Archae-ology, Religion, and Culture, HTS 41 (1995; repr., Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004), which includes contributions from Christine Th omas, L.

E r i m , JRSMono 5 (London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, 1989). Very recently, we can see how the material turn has impacted urban studies in Anna Leone, Th e End of the Pagan City: Religion, Economy, and Urbanism in Late Antique North Africa (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), who uses material remains (along with textual evidence) to analyze the processes of religious change and religious endurance in various urban environments in late antique North Africa. A subfi eld has also arisen in the past few decades that provides a smaller stage for revisiting the categories of decline and fall; in this discussion, the question of the late antique/late Roman city is central; see, e.g., Gian Pietro Brogiolo, Nancy Gauthier, and Neil Christie, eds., Towns and Th eir Territories between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, TRW 9 (Leiden: Brill, 2000); J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz, Th e Decline and Fall of the Roman City (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), who in particular interrogates the view of decline predicated on a particular reading of the archae-ological record that suggests the shrinking of city walls, decay of theaters, and replacement of the grid system of streets with a labyrinthine network of souks; also J. H. W. G. Liebes-chuetz, “Th e End of the Ancient City,” in Th e City in Late Antiquity, ed. John Rich (London and New York: Routledge, 1992), 1–49; also John Rich and Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, eds., City and Country in the Ancient World, LNSAS 2 (London and New York: Routledge, 1991), which deals with the Greek to early Roman period.27. In the recent wave of city scholarship in late antiquity, there has been a deliberate eff ort to conjoin the fi elds of archaeology, social sciences, and cultural studies and therefore emphasize material culture in what is so oft en a fi eld dominated by textual witnesses. Many of the collected essays mentioned in note 26 focus directly on the dilemma at hand: how to analyze the urban sphere in a post-Gibbon era aware of the ideological pitfalls of the decline/fall narrative. A number of these collaborative publications include a summary of this discussion as well as a delineation of the subsequent methodologies adopted and devel-oped: a deliberately late antique approach involves the incorporation of both literary (tex-tual) and material (archaeological) data into an analysis sensitive to the inherent biases of the literary material as well as interpreters’ own embedded presumptions as post-Cartesian moderns. Many of these studies struggle to strike a balance between the two analytic for-mulae of “decline/fall” and “continuity/transformation.” See, for example, Luke Lavan, ed., Recent Research in Late-Antique Urbanism, JRASup 42 (Portsmouth, RI: Journal of Roman Archaeology, 2001); Neil Christie and S.

Loseby, eds., Towns in Transition: Urban Evolu-tion in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages (Aldershot, UK, and Brookfi eld, VT: Scolar Press, 1996); Gian Pietro Brogiolo and Bryan Ward-Perkins, eds., Th e Idea and Ideal of the Town between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, TRW 4 (Leiden: Brill 1999); John Rich, ed., Th e City in Late Antiquity, LNSAS 3 (London and New York: Routledge, 1992); Liebeschuetz, Th e Decline and Fall of the Roman City; Bryan Ward-Perkins, “Th e Cities,” in Th e Cambridge Ancient History, vol. 13, Th e Late Empire, A.D. 337–425, ed.

Th e bibliography in Holy Bishops is invaluable and directed me to many of the references that appear in the following notes.31. Rapp, Holy Bishops, 13.32.

Th is anachronistic insistence leads to a reductive sense of ritual action, which also produces a symbolic view of ritual action. See Henry Ansgar Kelly, Th e Devil at Baptism: Ritual, Th eology, and Drama (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985), 145; Hugh Riley, Christian Initiation: A Comparative Study of the Interpretation of the Baptismal Liturgy in the Mystagogical Writings of Cyril of Jerusalem, John Chrysostom, Th eodore of Mopsuestia, and Ambrose of Milan, SCA 17 (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1974), 195, who attempts to explain away what he concedes to be the “faded echo of pagan purifi ca-tion rites” (195) in Christian baptism; and Th omas M. Finn, From Death to Rebirth: Ritual and Conversion in Antiquity (Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 1997), 34–35, who off ers a socio-logical reading of fourth-century baptism and exorcism’s role in that conversion process.

Th e bibliography for exorcism and demonology in the New Testament and early Christianity is quite large and extensive, and space allows only a few examples: Franz Joseph Dölger, Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufritual: Eine religionsgeschichtliche Studie, SGKA 3:1/2 (Paderborn: Schöningh, 1909); Klaus Th raede, “Exorzismus,” RAC 7.5 (1969): 44–117; and studies by Otto Böcher, who has published a number of works that discuss demonology and exorcism in the New Testament and early Christian period, including Christus exorcista: Dämonismus und Taufe im Neuen Testament, BWANT 5.16/96 (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1972); Dämonenfurcht und Dämonenabwehr: Ein Beitrag zur Vorgeschichte der christlichen Taufe, BWANT 5.10/90 (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1970); and Das Neue Testa-ment und die dämonischen Mächte, SBS 58 (Stuttgart: Katholisches Bibelwerk, 1972). Th e bibliography is far too extensive to include here; for a few key examples, see the bibliogra-phy in Sorensen, Possession and Exorcism. Noteworthy again for her theoretical approach, appropriating Jonathan Z. Smith’s category of demonization, is Elizabeth A. Leeper; see especially “From Alexandria to Rome” and “Th e Role of Exorcism.” See also Todd Klutz, Th e Exorcism Stories in Luke–Acts: A Sociostylistic Reading, SNTSMS 129 (Cambridge: Cam-bridge University Press, 2004).

I have also turned to scholarship covering possession and exorcism in"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"256 Notes to Pages 19–25diff erent time periods: for example, Clark, Th inking with Demons; Sarah Ferber, Demonic Possession and Exorcism in Early Modern France (London and New York: Routledge, 2004); René Holvast, Spiritual Mapping in the United States and Argentina, 1989–2005: A Geography of Fear, RIA 8 (Leiden: Brill, 2009); and Brian Levack, Th e Devil Within: Possession and Exorcism in the Christian West (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013). Charles Stewart’s Demons and the Devil: Moral Imagination in Modern Greek Culture (Princeton, NJ: Princ-eton University Press, 1991) has been extremely infl uential in the study of demonology as part of the study of religion and magic in Greco-Roman antiquity.CHAPTER 1. A CITY OF RELIGIOUS PLURALISM AND SPIRITUAL AMBIGUITY1. Peter Brown, Th e Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity, Th e Haskell Lectures on History of Religions, n.s. 2 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 114–15, adapts the tested anthropological model of “medical pluralism” to illuminate the classical-to-late-antique situation, in which a broad spectrum of therapeutic systems (rational medicine, forms of religious healing, magical ritual) coexist, with none attaining fi nal authority. He also appropriates the anthropological term “hierarchy of resort” to describe a sick person’s practice of turning to whatever therapy is immediately available and then exhausting all possibilities in order of availability and accessibility; in other words, no particular form of care rises to ascendancy above any other. Refer on this point also to Les-ley Alexandra Sharp, Th e Possessed and the Dispossessed: Spirits, Identity, and Power in a Madagascar Migrant Town, Comparative Studies of Health Systems and Medical Care 37 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996), 203, 269–70 (for “medical pluralism”), 245 (for “hierarchy of resort”). Regarding the broad spectrum of therapeutic systems, see Vivian Nutton, “Murders and Miracles: Lay Attitudes towards Medicine in Classical Antiquity,” in Patients and Practitioners: Lay Perceptions of Medicine in Pre-industrial Society, ed. Roy Por-ter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), 40ff .; and G. E. R. Lloyd, Magic, Reason, and Experience, Studies in the Origin and Development of Science (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), 38–39, who lists several types of healers in competition with persons (such as Galen) who were practicing medicine (Gk. iatroi; L. medici): root cutters/herb cut-ters (Gk. rhizitomoi; L. herbarii), druggists (Gk. pharmakopōlai), midwives (Gk. maiai; L. obstetrices), gymnastic trainers (L. iatraliptae), diviners, exorcists, and priests in private and public shrines. Old women (L. aniles), magicians (Gk. magoi/goētai), astrologers (L. math-ematici), and dream interpreters (Gk. oneirokritai) can be added to this list. Cf. Rebecca Flemming, Medicine and the Making of Roman Women: Gender, Nature, and Authority from Celsus to Galen (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 33–79. Finally, see Gary B. Fern-gren, Medicine and Religion: A Historical Introduction (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univer-sity Press, 2014), 72.2. Gary B. Ferngren, Medicine and Health Care in Early Christianity (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009), 37ff ., describes the tendency of physicians to congregate in cities, thus providing urban inhabitants greater access to their services. He convincingly argues that at this time physicians (Gk. iatroi; L. medici) play a greater role in the lives of urban inhabitants than previously acknowledged in Brown’s model of “medical pluralism” or that of the “hierarchy of resort.” See also Gary B.

Regarding soothsayers, see Ammianus Marcellinus 19.112.119, 29.1.1–5; Libanius, Ora-tio 1.171 (F.I.I.163). Soothsaying or divination is hardly a practice exclusive to Greek ritual. For example, whether at Matrona or in a nearby synagogue, ritual experts will surely have been available to handle the divinatory aspects of dream interpretation: John Chrysostom, Adversus Judaeos 1.6.2, 1.8.1 (PG 48:852–53, 855–56); see also n. 5 below. Divination is an extremely popular and important practice in the late antique world. Th erefore, a brief sur-vey of recent relevant scholarship is in order: Ciraolo and Seidel, eds., Magic and Divination in the Ancient World, esp. the articles by Peter T. Struck (119–31) and Anitra Bingham Kolenkow (133–44); also Sarah Iles Johnston and Peter T. Struck, eds., Mantikê: Studies in Ancient Divination, RGRW 155 (Leiden: Brill, 2005); Sarah Iles Johnston’s “Introduction” is essential reading for understanding “divination” as an ideologically shift ing object of analy-sis in the history of religion, in particular in ancient religions (1–28). Also signifi cant in this volume are the articles by William E. Klingshirn (52–128) and David Frankfurter (233–54). For a general overview of divination practice in antiquity, see Sarah Iles Johnston, Ancient Greek Divination (Malden, MA, and Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008), 1–30, 109–82; also Valerie Flint, Th e Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univer-sity Press, 1991), 88–91.

Levine, Th e Ancient Synagogue: Th e First Th ousand Years (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2000), 384, who places the Matrona in the context of the syna-gogue’s general reputation in late antiquity as a locus of holiness and therefore healing. Th e Daphne synagogue, Levine argues, will have drawn itself into competitive parallel with the Asclepian cult: during a night’s sleep, a person receives a healing visit from the God of Israel.6. For amulets in synagogues, see John Chrysostom, Adv. Jud. 1.7.5–11; 8.4–7 (PG 48:854–55, 935–38, esp. 936); John also describes Jewish sorcerers who take healing potions to the homes of sick Christians: Adv. Jud. 8.7 (PG 48:937). Th is passage had traditionally been dismissed until the discoveries of Babylonian magic bowls and magical texts such as the Sepher Ha-Razim; see Mordecai Margalioth, ed., Sepher Ha-Razim: A Newly Recovered Book of Magic from the Talmudic Period (Tel Aviv: Yediot Achronot, 1966) (Hebrew); (Eng-lish translation) Michael A.

Since that point, the syna-gogue has been treated as being in a direct competitive relationship with other religious institutions (e.g., the temple, the church, and the martyr shrine) as a place of “numinous power”: Robert L. Wilken, John Chrysostom and the Jews: Rhetoric and Reality in the Late 4th Century, TCH 4 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983), 83–88 (on Jewish magic), 83–84 (on John Chrysostom’s views on Jewish magic specifi cally). Also see Levine, Th e Ancient Synagogue. Gideon Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic, 143, 314–22, supports the “outsider evidence” of Chrysostom’s statement about synagogue magic with “insider sup-port.” Bohak (315) introduces nineteen metal lamellae discovered in a late antique syna-gogue at Horvat Ma’on (near the modern Kibbuz Nirim) in an apse quite close to an ark of the Torah. Th ey were rolled or folded, with some of the original fabric in which they were wrapped still remaining.7. For nurses and folk remedies, see John Chrysostom, Homiliae in epistulam ad Colos-senses) 8 (PG 62:358) (hereaft er Hom. Col.).

He is creating and feeding an imagination that lives and exists through and in cultural memes. John is building upon earlier literary fi gures of the drunken old women who provide frightening magical advice, such as those in Lucian’s Dialogi meretricii. In fact, Dial. meretr. 4 is replete with several examples of drunken old women and prostitutes practicing magic. Names include Melitta and Bacchis of Dial. meretr. 4; also Th eocritus’s Simaetha and Horace’s Canidia. Such famous L. sagae/meretrices of Roman elegists do much more to provide us with a sociocultural sense of prostitutes’ relationship with magical practice in general, and erotic spells and old women in particular. Of course, Lucian is engaging in a literary pursuit and one that is very much tongue-in-cheek.8. John Chrysostom, Hom. Col. 8 (PG 62:357–59); this passage names the apotropaia discussed in note 7 above but places them in relation to a child suff ering from a grave fever and in the context of Christian sacramental identity. Th e passage from John Chrysostom, like others by Athanasius, Augustine, and Gregory of Nazianzus, contributes to the Chris-tianization of remedia; e.g., Augustine, Sermo 306e; (English translation) Augustine, Works of Saint Augustine: A Translation for the 21st Century, ed. John E. Rotelle, trans. Edmund Hill, Part 3, vol. 9, Sermons (306–340A) on the Saints (Brooklyn, NY: New City Press, 1994), 11, 277–78. For discussion of the Augustinian passage, see David Frankfurter, “Beyond Magic and Superstition,” in Late Ancient Christianity, ed. Virginia Burrus, A People’s His-tory of Christianity 2 (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2005), 255–84, esp. 277–78.

Mary Magdeleine Mueller, FC 31 (New York: Fathers of the Church, Inc., 1971), 1:101 (more recently, FC vol-umes have been published by the Catholic University of America Press).9. See the introduction for the distinction between demonization and diabolization.10. Isabella Sandwell, Religious Identity in Late Antiquity: Greeks, Jews, and Christians in Antioch (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 5.11. Ibid. For a brief defi nition of habitus, see Pierre Bourdieu, Outline of a Th eory of Practice, CSSCA 16 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 76–79, 86–88; also Bourdieu’s Logic of Practice (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1990), 52–65, also 66–79. Sandwell argues that Antiochenes of the time develop religious “dispositions and habits” through the act of living in, engaging with, and experiencing the religious and ritual pluralism of Antioch; the practices of religious allegiance and religious diff erence have become a part of the Antiochenes’ embodied knowledge, which they then deploy strategi-cally. Th at is, “they would have acted out religious allegiance and religious diff erence as something that mattered at some times but not at others and that could be put aside when needed” (19). In other words, Sandwell argues that in the beginning of the Roman imperial period recognition of religious diff erence, especially in cities, leads to “a natural and habit-ual sense of how to deal with issues of religious diff erence and religious allegiance” (18).12. When describing “religious confl ict, change, and violence,” I am directing my dis-course toward animistic and ritual exchanges, narrowly construed, in relation to the socio-logical, which is always the dominant epistemological mode of understanding human inter-action. In other words, I ask only that we consider, in a focused sense, how ritual engagement may specifi cally create a sense of violent confl ict—and how the imagined cosmological realms involved would react—and how, then, this may relay ideas of actual change in religious identity that do not register to the modern reader, who interprets strictly in the"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"260 Notes to Pages 27–29sociological, anthropological, or historical method without considering this dimension. Moreover, I imagine this realm working “in tandem” with the “actual” sociological—always pushing it or following it in ritual action. Finally, by considering the animistic and the ritual together, I hope that it may open up possibilities when considering archaeological remains with respect to their purpose and use, especially of smaller ritual objects such as amuletic objects. Here I have in mind Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic, 320–22, a creative and imagina-tive approach to magic practice, amuletic practice, and questions that have long befuddled scholars regarding the synagogue.13. For “the betwixt and between,” and an informative discussion regarding ritual activ-ity more generally, see Frankfurter, “Beyond Magic and Superstition,” 255–312.14. Polymnia Athanassiadi, “Philosophers and Oracles: Shift s of Authority in Late Paganism,” Byzantion 62 (1992): 45–62, has demonstrated that changes occur within the civic authority among Christians, pagans, and other religious groups in the shift ing sociore-ligious frontier of late antiquity; see also Athanassiadi’s comparison between Iamblichus and Eusebius in her article “Dreams, Th eurgy and Freelance Divination: Th e Testimony of Iamblichus,” JRS 83 (1993): 115–30. Not all are contented with this religious and ritual com-petition, however; John Chrysostom continually attempts to dissuade congregations from engaging in divinatory practices: e.g., In Kalendas (hereaft er Kal.) 2 (PG 48:954) (following the observance of days); Hom. 1 Tim. 10.3 (PG 62:552): “omens, observations, origins, sym-bols, amulets, divinations, incantations, magic” (klēdonismous, paratēseis, geneseis, sym-bola, periammata, manteias, epōidas, mageias).15. Martin Illert, Johannes Chrysostomus und das antiochenisch-syrische Mönchtum: Stu-dien zu Th eologie, Rhetorik und Kirchenpolitik im antiochenischen Schrift tum des Johannes Chrysostomus (Ph.D., diss. Kiel, 1998; Zurich: Pano, 2000), contends that the uniquely Syr-ian asceticism that marks John Chrysostom’s character is urban-centered, and his ascetic training did not involve withdrawal from the city. I am indebted to one of the anonymous readers at the University of California Press for pointing out Illert’s work. Th us, John’s brand of asceticism is quite distinct from Evagrian and Egyptian asceticism in terms of location. Th is marks an important departure from and revision of earlier depictions of John Chrys-ostom’s monastic development. Illert’s thesis is well argued and gaining support; see espe-cially the conclusions of Wendy Mayer, “What Does It Mean to Say Th at John Chrysostom Was a Monk?” StPatr 41 (2006): 451–55.16. David Brakke, “Th e Making of Monastic Demonology: Th ree Ascetic Teachers on Withdrawal and Resistance,” CH 70.1 (2001): 19–48; David Brakke, “Ethiopian Demons: Male Sexuality, the Black-Skinned Other, and the Monastic Self,” in “Sexuality in Late Antiquity,” special issue, JHSex 10.3/4 (2001): 501–35; David Brakke, “Th e Lady Appears: Materializations of ‘Woman’ in Early Monastic Literature,” JMEMS 33.3 (2003): 387–402. Th e latter two articles form the basis for chapters in Brakke’s book Demons and the Making of the Monk. As Brakke states (251 n. 5), he follows a psychoanalytic approach in his analysis of monastic demonology; in doing so, he draws upon the defense in Dyan Elliott, Fallen Bodies: Pollution, Sexuality, and Demonology in the Middle Ages (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999). Also see Richard Valantasis, “Daemons and the Perfecting of the Monk’s Body: Monastic Anthropology, Daemonology, and Asceticism,” Semeia 58 (1992): 47–79.17.

Kalleres, “Demons and Divine Illumination: A Consideration of Eight Prayers by Gregory of Nazianzus,” VC 61.2 (2007): 157–88.19. While somewhat outdated, Paul Petit, André J. Festugière, and Glanville Downey are all still essential reading when putting together a picture of late antique Antioch: e.g., Paul Petit, Libanius et la vie municipale à Antioche au IVe siècle après J.-C., BAH 62 (Paris: Geu-thner, 1955); also André J. Festugière, Antioche païenne et chrétienne: Libanius, Chrysostome et les moines de Syrie, BEFAR 194 (Paris: de Boccard, 1959); Glanville Downey, A History of Antioch in Syria: From Seleucus to the Arab Conquest (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1961). Th e late twentieth and early twenty-fi rst centuries have brought additional shift s in interpretive tides as scholars’ eyes have settled increasingly upon Libanius and John Chrysostom and the city that both inhabited. For English translations of some of Libanius’s work, see n. 4 above. Roughly concurrent with Norman are some of J. H. W. G. Liebe-schuetz’s publications that revolve around the bishop’s role in urban development and decline: e.g., J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz, Antioch: City and Imperial Administration (1972; repr., Oxford: Clarendon, 2003); Liebeschuetz, Decline and Fall of the Roman City. Liebeschuetz’s scholarship still holds substantial weight as I write this book; unfortunately, his most recent publication, Ambrose and John Chrysostom: Clerics between Desert and Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), did not appear until my thought process was well advanced. Other important works include Christine Kondoleon, ed., Antioch: Th e Lost Ancient City (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Worcester, MA: Worcester Art Museum, 2000), a collection of essays by experts in the fi eld who cover a wide variety of topics that pertain to the city: religion in general, the Jewish populations, Christianity, jewelry, houses, mosa-ics, furnishings, and so forth. With studies such as these in recent years, the city of Antioch has reemerged and moved into the academic spotlight.20. It is fair to say that in the past decade or so Antioch has in a very material sense exploded onto the academic scene. Th e trend continues with works such as Isabella Sand-well and Janet Huskinson, eds., Culture and Society in Later Roman Antioch: Papers from a Colloquium, London, 15th December 2001 (Oxford: Oxbow Books, 2004), a volume of essays that focus on diff erent aspects of the late Roman period in Antioch; the essays collectively represent an important eff ort toward correcting earlier Antiochene studies, especially by including archaeological material. Th e renewed interest in Antioch is also represented by another conference in Lyon: Bernadette Cabouret, Pierre-Louis Gatier, and Catherine Sal-iou, eds., Antioch de Syrie: Histoire, images et traces de la ville antique [colloque de Lyon, octobre 2001], Topoi Orient-Occident Supplement 5 (Lyon: Maison de l’Orient et de la Médi-terranée–Jean Pouilloux, 2004). Much of this scholarship refl ects the view of Antioch as a bellwether of urban life in the farthest Eastern reaches of the later Roman Empire, near an ever-fl uctuating Persian border: e.g., esp. Isabella Sandwell’s recent work, Religious Identity in Late Antiquity.

For the category of magician (magos) in the Roman context—Republic to late imperial—see Fritz Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, Revealing Antiquity 10 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997), 61–88; David Frankfurter, “Priest to Magician: Evolving Modes of Religious Authority,” in his Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press), chap. 5 (198–237); David Frankfurter, “Ritual Expertise in Roman Egypt and the Problem of the Category ‘Magician,’ ” in Envisioning Magic: A Princeton Seminar and Symposium, ed. Peter Schäfer and Hans G. Kipperberg, SHR 75 (Leiden: Brill, 1997), 115–35, esp. 126–29, which addresses a changing situation in the later empire and has argued for wider fl exibility when considering the overlap between the role of the magos and Egyptian priests, for instance, especially in the third century, when economic crisis besets the temples and thus breaks down boundaries between the two ritual identities. I would suggest a similar scenario in Antioch; while temple decline is a certainly a factor, the constant population fl ow through Antioch also hastens the boundaries in ambiguities in rit-ual power: magicians, priests, old women selling amulets, divinatory experts, astrologers, doctors, rabbis, other unnamed wise men, old women, and monks—all will have off ered their skills in making textual amulets and spells. In the end, it is a competitive, charismatic market fed continuously by trade routes and energized by urban demand.23. Sarolta A. Takács, “Pagan Cults at Antioch,” in Kondoleon, Antioch, 197–216, quote at 199. On all pagan cults, see Liebeschuetz, Antioch, 228–31; Bernadette Cabouret, “Sous les portiques d’Antioche,” Syria 76 (1999): 127–50; Emmanuel Soler, Le sacré et le salut à Antio-che au IVe siècle après J.-C.: Pratiques festives et comportements religieux dans le processus de christianisation de la cité, BAH 176 (Ph.D. diss., Rouen, 1999; Beirut: Institut français du Proche-Orient, 2006).24. Th e problem in answering such questions, of course, involves the dearth of recov-ered archaeological evidence and material culture. A joint Princeton-French excavation uncovered a great deal but primarily concentrated on Daphne and the mosaics: Richard Stillwell, ed., Antioch-on-the-Orontes, vol. 2, Th e Excavations 1933–1936, Publications of the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1938); Richard Stillwell, ed., Antioch-on-the-Orontes, vol. 3, Th e Excavations 1937–1939, Publications of the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1941). Many of the original locations for buildings—including churches, the hippodrome, etc.—have been lost. Th e city has grown up a good deal, making new excavations a near-impossibility, although it is hoped that recent surveys will yield promising information: e.g., several of the articles in Sandwell and Huskinson, Culture and Society in Later Roman Antioch, which focuses on material culture and archaeological sur-veys for the surrounding hill towns and limestone massif, providing information regarding settlement patterns.

Th is fi ts with imperial action—or inaction, as the case may be: Constantine imposes certain restrictions on sacri-fi ce but nothing dealing with the actual temple structures (a policy followed by Constan-tius), in spite of promoting Christianization. Th e period of Julianic polytheistic indulgence is followed by Valens’s clemency for polytheistic cults. I depend heavily here upon Isabella Sandwell’s Religious Identity in Late Antiquity, in which she has assembled a good deal of primarily literary evidence to piece together a vivid picture of the city’s civic religion. I am especially in her debt for her quite thorough reading of civil and religious life in Antioch. Sandwell notes (42), and I agree, that though we have evidence only for the destruction of the Apollo temple in Daphne and the temple of Nemesis in 387, it is probable that many smaller shrines are destroyed during Gallus’s stay in the city as well as aft er Julian’s death.30.

A collection of thirteen curse tablets was discovered in Antioch and the surrounding area during the 1934–35 season. Th e Antioch-on-the-Orontes excavation was conducted by a consortium of institutions that included the Musées Nationaux de France (the Louvre), the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Worcester Art Museum, and Princeton University, joined later by the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard and by Dumbarton Oaks. For a basic discussion of the excavations, see Kondoleon, Antioch, 5–8. Aft er the excavations had concluded, the curse tablets were moved to the Princeton Art Museum, where they have remained in stor-age practically undisturbed. In 1998, Florent Heintz together with Alexander Hollman launched a project of publishing the tablets. Th us far Hollman has published two tablets: the fi rst, “A Curse Tablet from the Circus at Antioch,” ZPE 145 (2003): 67–82; the second, “A Curse Tablet From Antioch against Babylas the Greengrocer,” ZPE 177 (2011): 157–65.

Versnel, “Beyond Cursing: Th e Appeal to Justice in Judicial Prayers,” also in Faraone and Obbink, Magika Hiera, 60–106, who delineates a collection of ritual texts separate from the curse texts—judicial prayers. Th ese texts, according to Versnel (60), are “an irrevocable punishment or . . . a conditional and temporary means of pressure, . . . a form of judicial torment by which the guilty is eventually brought to confess and restitute or compensate for what was owed.” While the collection of agonistic magic found in archaeological excavations is quite large,"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 45–48 267only a small amount has been published.

Kotansky, Greek Magical Amulets, 271, notes that the Jewish angelology in the Beirut amulet is very similar to a number of other magic texts and suggests, for example, PGM 35:1–42 and PGM 22b:1–26.91. For Jewish and Christian liturgical exorcisms in the Great Paris manuscript (PGM 4:3007–86), see Kotansky, “Greek Exorcistic Amulets,” 265ff . Ritual practitioners can access these powers through horkismoi, formulae that forge a contract with the possessing demon, bidding it to remain away from its former host for any ritual purpose (exorcism, erotic spell, curse, etc.). Th e demons, according to Kotansky (265), “by the inherently magic power of the words contained in this subtle like-by-like formulation are to recognize their own limitative"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"268 Notes to Pages 48–52status and to observe boundaries; their home is the abyss, and that is where they belong.” Th e most expedient means of guaranteeing the demons’ departure is to feature within the spell certain epithets that describe God as all-powerful: creator, regulator of the natural order, boundary maker, destroyer of the delinquent, object of praise for the angelic hierarchies, and, most importantly, the overseer of fi ery Gehenna, before which even the mighty moun-tains tremble in fear. When a demon possesses or pesters a human being, he trespasses beyond his natural home: “It is as if the surly daemons had signed an unwritten clause in some unseen cosmological contract, the public reading of which—through the performance of the exorcism—has bound them to their legal obligation.” Kotansky, “Greek Exorcistic Amulets,” 265.

I intend “ideology” here in the Althusserian sense: Louis Althusser, “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses,” in Lenin and Philosophy, and Other Essays (1971; repr., New York: Monthly Review Press, 2001), 127–88. Th e many and varied images that John Chrys-ostom repeatedly projects in the congregants’ imaginations are intended to act as a set of customs or rules, defi ning their worldview as well as establishing implicit moral and ethical limits and boundaries. I am very grateful to Andrew Jacobs for suggesting Althusser aft er reading an earlier version of this chapter.5. Smith, “Towards Interpreting Demonic Powers,” 429.6. We can see the strong infl uence of Smith’s analysis in any recent study of early Chris-tian demonology and exorcism. Sorensen, Possession and Exorcism, 118–221, reads exorcism and demonology in patristic Christianity from Smith’s perspective. Also advantageously relying on Smith is Leeper, “Th e Role of Exorcism.” For early scholarship still indispensible in the fi eld, see Th raede, “Exorzismus,” and Dölger, Der Exorzismus; see also Böcher, Chris-tus exorcista; also still quite important is Böcher, Dämonenfurcht und Dämonenabwehr. For the related background in demonology more generally, see Valerie Flint, “Th e Demonisa-tion of Magic and Sorcery in Late Antiquity: Christian Redefi nitions of Pagan Religions,” in Ancient Greece and Rome, ed. Bengt Ankarloo and Stuart Clark, vol. 2 of Witchcraft and Magic in Europe (London: Th e Athlone Press; Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), 277–348, who provides a consideration of early imperial to late antique demon-ology that is more descriptive than theoretical; also Flint, Th e Rise of Magic, 227–338, esp. 315–38, in regard to demons in late antiquity and Christianization of the spiritual world. As a general reference also see Henry Ansgar Kelly, Towards the Death of Satan: Th e Growth and Decline of Christian Demonology (London: Geoff rey Chapman, 1968); and Henry Ans-gar Kelly, Th e Devil, Demonology, and Witchcraft : Th e Development of Christian Beliefs in Evil Spirits, rev. ed. (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1974). Sandwell, Religious Identity in Late Antiquity, 143–44, relies heavily on the category of “demonization”; Shepardson, “Control-ling Contested Places,” 483–516, ties the demonic to geography. In a less theoretically sophisticated manner, Wilken, John Chrysostom and the Jews, also follows this pattern. He traces Chrysostom’s patterned insults within the tradition of rhetoric: drunkenness and invective, for example (119–21). According to Wilken, John eventually settles upon the theo-logical problems of the Jews themselves and their continuing existence despite Christiani-ty’s rise; see his description of Jews as Christ killers, and thus bodies vacated of souls and abandoned to demons. Wilken also mentions the parallels to Chrysostom found in Consti-tutiones apostolicae 2.2.1.7. John Chrysostom presents much of this material in his fi rst baptismal lecture, a pro-grammatic format dictating the diff erence between the sensory order (epi tōn aisthētōn) and the spiritual order (ta pneumatika) that he follows throughout Catech. illum. 1.5–16. For the Greek in Catech. illum.1–8, see SC 50:111–17. My translations of the catecheses here and through chap. 3 are slightly modifi ed from Harkins, Baptismal Instructions (i.e., ACW 31).8. For the language “the new soldiers of Christ,” see John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 4.6 (SC 50:185; ACW 31:68).9. In this manner, John follows Paul’s thinking quite closely, especially the image of Christ’s body in 1 Cor. 12:12–27."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"270 Notes to Pages 53–5710. See Ellen Muehlberger, Angels in Late Antique Christianity (New York: Oxford Uni-versity Press, 2013), 176–214.11. Of course, once we get to this point in late antiquity it is impossible to speak of unadulterated Stoic theories of cognition and perception; all Hellenistic philosophies have converged, and John Chrysostom, for his part, most certainly relies heavily on a Platonizing cosmology in his dualization of the sensory and the pneumatic. I owe thanks to Catherine Chin for reminding me of this very important point. Th at said, in John Chrysostom’s description of the sensory order and in his understanding of the convergence of the demonic and the bodily he expresses a very strong materialistic view of the processes of perception and cognition, and thus a more Stoicizing interpretation.12. I will discuss this at length in the next chapter. John relies a great deal on the practice of psychagogy—leading the soul/mind to a new belief or knowledge through the process of speech tactics in groups and one on one. It was used quite oft en, especially in Epicurean circles. See Clarence E. Glad, Paul and Philodemus: Adaptability in Epicurean and Early Christian Psychagogy, NovTSup 81 (Leiden: Brill, 1995).13. As a comparative reference to John’s thinking in terms of the Stoic framework, Brakke, Demons and the Making of the Monk, 3–77, provides a comprehensive survey and in-depth analysis of various Egyptian asceticisms and demonologies and their incorpora-tion of Stoic views of cognition and perception. For an extremely useful comparative over-view of Stoic demonology, see Algra, “Stoics on Souls and Demons,” 359–88.14. In Adv. Jud. 1.4.1–5, John indulges in an elaborate mixing of the images of disease, demonic possession, and ritual healing that fi rmly associates the Judaizing disease with John’s depiction of Jewish souls and synagogues full of demons.15. For the relevant Stoic texts, including translations, I have relied upon A. A. Long and D. N.

Regarding the materiality of the soul (and the reasoning faculty) but also the demons: As mentioned in chap. 1, Gregory A. Smith, “How Th in Is a Demon?” has noted (479–512, esp. 481) that in the increasingly sophisticated readings of demons in late antiq-uity, we have gained a great deal of information about the human soul/mind/person and its materiality and thus capacity to interact with the sensory environment. However, as he cor-rectly observes, we oft en lose sight of the perceived physical reality and materiality of the demon itself that is also part of that sensory environment. I most certainly agree with Smith’s astute observation, and in this study of demonic possession and exorcism I take his comments quite seriously; while John does craft a distinct concept of a human interiority (soul/mind in a material relationship with the surrounding sensory world), he carves out"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"272 Notes to Pages 59–63that interiority and its vulnerable relation to the environment using a material theorization of the demonic.37.

Th is impression dwells in the man’s soul, disheveling his ordered emotions, raising epithymia, and eventually driving him back to the theater.

A still formidable guide to the development of stational liturgies in late antique cities is John Baldovin, Th e Urban Character of Christian Worship: Th e Origins, Development, and Meaning of Stational Liturgy, OCA 228 (Rome: Pontifi cum Institutum Orientalium Studio-rum, 1987).

Liturgical practices and ecclesiastical regulations arising with martyr cults pro-moted a Christianization of the temporal and geographical dimensions of the late antique world; classic studies of the transformation/Christianization include R.

John Chrysostom, Adv. Jud. 1.7.5 (PG 48:854; FC 68:29). A debate has long revolved around the question of whether or not we can take Adv. Jud. 1.4.1–5, 1.7.1–8.1, and 8.6.6–11 as evidence that the rabbis in Antioch off ered amuletic and incantational healing. Also fasci-nating is how this debate has closely refl ected contemporary theoretical and methodologi-cal discourses in related fi elds of scholarship; recently Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic, 320–22, makes the case in support of a widely variegated ritual practice with the synagogue as a centralizing location. Wilken, John Chrysostom and the Jews, 83–84, attending to recent discoveries in material culture and the interest in magic, places the church and synagogue in competition over the marketing of “numinous power” in the city. For earlier accounts, see Marcel Simon, Verus Israel: A Study of the Relations between Christians and Jews in the Roman Empire, AD 135–425, trans. H. McKeating, Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (Oxford: Published for the Littman Library by Oxford University Press, 1986), 339–68, who declares that Judaism participated in and contributed to magic avidly, and that through this means a “degraded Judaism” maintained status as a formidable rival to Christianity in the fi rst few centuries.95. John Chrysostom, Adv. Jud. 8.6.11 (PG 48:937; FC 68:229).96. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 10.16 (PK 2:14; ACW 31:155).97. Th e language “wrinkled, spotted” derives from Eph. 5:25–27. John develops the lan-guage of the soul’s corruption in Catech. illum. 1.16–18 (SC 50:116–18): for example, “ugly,” “deformed”: Catech. illum. 1.3, 5, 10 (SC 50:110, 111, 113; ACW 31:24). Also “thoroughly and shamefully sordid”: Catech. illum. 1.3 (SC 50:110; ACW 31:24).98. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 1.46 (SC 50:132; ACW 31:41). John demands that baptizands practice an “abstinence from evil” during the baptismal process; this is tanta-mount to a request for their social withdrawal (i.e., avoiding “the wicked snares of the devil”); likewise, in Catech. illum. 1.46 John requests baptizands to engage in a diverse and diverting collection of linguistic practices that should envelop their lives entirely: “Let us spend the whole day long in prayers and confessions, in reading and compunction.” Th ese activities demarcate a wide swath of territory between their collectively practiced (baptis-mal) lives and the rest of Antioch.99. John develops a Christianized notion of parrhēsia that he links to sacramental bap-tismal identity (the protective eff ects of the sphragis and the potent effi cacy of divinity dwelling within); thus, parrhēsia also means newfound confi dence in postbaptismal speech that possessed antidemonic force. For example, John describes catechumens’ inability to speak with confi dence prior to baptism (“mēdemian parrhēsian,” Catech. illum. 1.17 [SC"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"276 Notes to Pages 74–7550.117; ACW 31:30]), and their gaining parrhēsia through baptism. Essential reading in the Christianization of parrhēsia in late antiquity is still Peter Brown, Power and Persuasion in Late Antiquity: Towards a Christian Empire (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992), 35–70, 122–57. Brown’s work also provides important background for understanding how Chrysostom develops his sacramental or ritual notion of powerful and persuasive speech—a kind of speech available to the baptized only, those engaged in spiritual warfare. Th e “magical” or mystical aspects of oratorical persuasion, rhetoric’s ability to soothe the pas-sions or rally them, for instance, was always part of the equation in language theory. As early as Plato’s Cratylus people pursued questions regarding the function and origins of language: Do words have an inherent connection to the things they signify (natural), or is language composed of arbitrary signs (conventional)? For a thorough reading on the blend-ing of the two types of language, see Pedro Laín Entralgo, Th e Th erapy of the Word in Clas-sical Antiquity, trans. L. J. Rather and John M. Sharp (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1970).100. Smith, “How Th in Is a Demon?” 479–83.101. I do not intend to deny the importance of such interpretations, but rather hopefully to enhance the results by adding a diff erent perspective; exemplary in the psychoanalytic approach, for example, is Brakke, Demons and the Making of the Monk. See also Virginia Burrus, Th e Making of a Heretic: Gender, Authority, and the Priscillianist Controversy, TCH 24 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), 58–74, who provides an incisive reading of the demonological aspects in Priscillian’s Apology mainly against accusations of Man-ichaeanism; Burrus thus demonstrates the manner in which the author also created an image of his own orthodoxy set against Manichaean heresy/demonology in the text.102. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 1.5 (SC 50:111; ACW 31:24).103. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 2.12 (SC 50:140; ACW 31:47–48); also 10.14ff . (PK 2:14). In Catech. illum. 6.23 (SC 50:226; ACW 31:102) John describes the need to keep the baptismal robe clean, and the consequences should someone fail in complying with the necessary upkeep. Similarly, throughout Catech. illum. 9, John gives instructions to cate-chumens to clean up their habit of oath taking/making. Th ey have ten days to remove this habit from their speech. John’s language suggests that if they fail they may be prevented from being baptized; however, he stops short of this cruelty in the end. Compare Robin M. Jensen, Baptismal Imagery in Early Christianity: Ritual, Visual, and Th eological Dimensions (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2012), 2, who mentions baptizands’ potential “insin-cerity of purpose” during the baptismal preparation; baptizands were judged during a host of their baptismal ritual preparations—e.g., scrutinies, fasting, refraining from bathing, giv-ing alms, and keeping vigil—all ritual performances that were assessed by the ecclesiastical staff .104. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 2.12 (SC 50:140; ACW 31:48), 4.5 (SC 50:185; ACW 31:68).105. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 2.12 (SC 50:140; ACW 31:47), 4.5 (SC 50:185; ACW 31:68).106. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 4.14 (SC 50:148; ACW 31:71–72): John discussed Paul’s “new creation” (2 Cor. 5:17) in terms of Stoic cognitive theory: “Th e newly sealed, the chosen soldiers of Christ” were inscribed in the citizen lists in heaven, and due to their baptized state the devil would recognize the diff erence as well (Catech. illum. 4.5–6; SC"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 75–77 27750:185–86; ACW 31:68). Th e passage continues, “[T]he devil will depart in confusion and will not dare to look [him or her] in the face. He cannot endure the brilliance that fl ashes forth from their faces, but his eyes are so blinded by the rays of light that their eyes send forth that he turns his back and fl ees.”107. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 1.7 (SC 50:112; ACW 31:25). Also more generally Catech. illum. 1.14–16 (SC 50:116–17; ACW 31:28–29).108. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 1.14–16 (SC 50:116–17; ACW 31:28–29). Chryso-stom describes the dominance of the intellectual or the spiritual (pneuma) dimension over the sensory. John later characterizes the power inherent in sacramental action to lift one up to the intellectual/spiritual and to illuminate the mind: for example, Catech. illum. 4.20 (SC 50:193; ACW 31:74).109. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 3.21 (SC 50:163; ACW 31:63).110. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 3.21 (SC 50:163; ACW 31:63).

PG 62:342–44; NPNF1 13:286); the phrase “to erase humanity’s death,” which is taken from Col. 2:14, is repeated throughout this homily.112. John Chrysostom, De coemeterio et de cruce (PG 49:398).

Th e cosmological ramifi cations of this single event of the crucifi xion are a recurrent theme in John Chrysostom’s homiletic discourse: e.g., Hom. Col. 6 (PG 62:342–44; NPNF1 13:284–88). Training for an ongoing battle with the devil—i.e., spiritual warfare—begins the moment one enters preparation for baptism (exorcisms, prayer, vigils, bible reading, psal-mody, almsgiving, and so forth). In Catech. illum. 3.8–10 (SC 50:155; ACW 31:58–59) John delineates a shift that occurs in spiritual warfare on the day of baptism and continues in this manner every day thereaft er: “Up to now you have been in training, in the palaistra and the gymnasion; there all your failures were forgiven. But from today on, the arena stands open, the contest is ready to begin. Not only is the race of men, but also the people of angels are watching [your] combats.”115. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 3.20–21 (SC 50:163–65; ACW 31:62–63); compare Catech. illum. 4.31 (SC 50:198; ACW 31:78).116. John Chrysostom describes a strict regime mainly involving the control of language (e.g., on ridding oneself of the habit of swearing), and he contextualizes this pursuit within the larger framework of spiritual warfare: so, for example, in Catech. illum. 4.23 (SC 50:194; ACW 31:74–75). Th ere is a debate about whether John means swearing oaths in the name of a deity, whether Christian or not, and/or whether he means taking God’s name in vain.117. John Chrysostom, Catech. illum. 1.30 (SC 50:124; ACW 31:35). Th is pivotal passage expresses John’s diabology within his sacramental theology. Here he provides more detail regarding the new Christian—a lifelong (verbal/oral) battle against the demonic for the baptized.

Finn, From Death to Rebirth, 205–8, draws upon Arnold van Gennep, Th e Rites of Passage (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1960), and Victor Turner, Th e Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-structure, Lewis Henry Morgan Lectures (1966) (Chicago: Aldine, 1969).130. Finn, From Death to Rebirth, 205–8, appropriates the term “encapsulation” to describe the conversion process, which he defi nes as a “procedure to teach something new, especially a new set of values and way of life.” Finn describes three elements of this process: physical, social, and ideological conversion. In this way, Finn reduces the demons of exor-cism and baptism entirely to the sociological and psychological.131. Informing my thinking here is Catherine Bell, Ritual Th eory, Ritual Practice (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992); also her Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), 81–83. In her deconstruction of ritual, she off ers the alternative of ritualization, informed by Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of practice and habi-tus, to resolve the instrumental/symbolic fi ssure. Critics have argued that Bell’s own view of ritualization is reductive. See Philip Smith, “Review of Ritual Th eory, Ritual Practice by Catherine Bell,” AJS 98.1 (1992): 420–22; he has criticized Bell and argues that in the diffi -culty of her conceptualization of ritualization she has actually maintained the dichotomies she claims to overcome.

Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, “A Performative Approach to Ritual,” in his Culture, Th ought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Uni-versity Press, 1985), 123–66, quote at 130.136. John R. Searle, Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969); John Austin, How to Do Th ings with Words, William James Lectures (1955) (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1962). Austin divides speech utterances into three categories: (1) locutionary (reference; true or false); (2) illocu-tionary (certain conventional force; a performative act that does something that is not sub-ject to the true/false test); (3) perlocutionary (what we achieve by saying something; the utterances of convincing, persuading, misleading, and so on).137. Marriage vows are a famous example of an illocutionary utterance. To say the words “I do take this woman to be my lawfully wedded wife” does not describe what should be done; it actually accomplishes it, completing the action of forming a conjugal relationship: Austin, How to Do Th ings with Words, 6; also Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, “Form and Meaning of Magical Acts: A Point of View,” in Modes of Th ought: Essays on Th inking in Western and Non-Western Societies, ed. Robin Horton and Ruth H. Finnegan (London: Faber and Faber, 1973), 78. Relevant here too are Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, “Th e Magical Power of Words,” in his Culture, Th ought, and Social Action, 17–59; and, once again, Tambiah, “A Performative Approach to Ritual,” 123–68, 130. His ethnographic account of exorcism in Sinhali culture is rich in description; the eleven major sequences span a twelve-hour ritual. Tambiah touches on many issues in this ritual process that are relevant to the prebaptismal exorcisms of the catechetical orations. A Sinhali exorcism ritual indicates the following: (1) the audience’s own level of demonic contamination; (2) the demon’s cosmological location and its direct relation to human illness; (3) certain systems ascribed to the demons through ritual objects—for example, off ers of food, fi re display, and erratic dancing are all attractive to the demonic; (4) a concern for the temporal stages of the rite—for example, texts that invoke the demons’ presence, portray them as actually manifest, or banish them; (5) the objectifi ca-tion of the demon and the illness; and (6) a characterization of the human power in the person of the ritual exorcist.138. In, “A Performative Approach to Ritual” and “Th e Magical Power of Words,” Tam-biah discusses the importance of who is speaking as much as what is being spoken (and enacted through performative speech). In his stance against symbolic, expressive reading of ritual, Tambiah has appropriated Austin’s observation that the performance of illocutionary utterances depends on the wider circumstances of setting. Th e outcome of an illocutionary utterance is not judged in accordance with the same logic found in locutionary speech acts, i.e., with objective notions of truth/falsehood employed in the scientifi c mode. Instead, a large number of variables—the surrounding circumstances as well as the illocutionary utterance itself—determine whether the outcome of such an utterance is felicitous or infe-licitous. Tambiah has employed Austin’s observations to remove the “magical” act or ritual operation from direct comparison with locutionary utterances, thereby creating a space in which the semantics of a magical act are judged by a diff erent set of criteria than logic or causality. Th e felicity or success of a magical act rests on a number of interwoven elements. Ritual speech and ritual action are tightly joined together through analogical associations, comparisons, and transferral of meaning (a complex of metaphor, simile, and metonymy) to create a ritual logic. Th e force of the utterance (i. e., the reality of its content enacted through"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"280 Notes to Pages 82–84performance) exists in the imperative voice of the person speaking—commanding, order-ing, and persuading. Moreover, the felicity of a ritual operation depends on preconditions that must be met: the ritual practitioner’s level of expertise as well as ritual preparations, the time and place of the act, and so on. Compare to Th omas M. Greene’s discussion in “Lan-guage, Signs and Magic,” in Schäfer and Kipperberg, Envisioning Magic, 255–73.139. Extremely helpful here in understanding how Gehenna is a reality for the bapti-zand through the ritual performance of the term is David Frankfurter, “Narrating Power: Th e Th eory and Practice of the Magical Historiola in Ritual Spells,” in Meyer and Mirecki, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, 457–76; Frankfurter describes how the recitation of a mythic episode of great cosmological signifi cance lends the power of past events to a ritual setting by aligning the mythic plot with the unfolding action of the ritual through a narra-tive vignette. Compare Mircea Eliade, Myth and Reality, trans. Willard R. Trask, World Perspectives 31 (New York: Harper & Row, 1963), 21–38. In elucidating Eliade’s articulation of the effi cacy of historiolae, Frankfurter explains that the power of the formulae resides not in the words themselves but in the content of the myth: “Th at is, narrative that describes ‘creative’ miracle intrinsically contains the power of that creative miracle, and thus the reci-tation of such narrative for magical purposes draws those powers into present circum-stances” (464). In a manner similar to the narrative historiolae contained in many magical texts, we can imagine that the crucifi xion epithets John references are drawing power into the daily exorcisms by invoking the power from those events into the present and repeated ritual moment of daily exorcism, with the demons being routed daily from the minds of the baptizands. We can also then imagine that the demonic realm re-experiences daily its prior defeat in direct connection to the baptismal candidate’s progressing cosmological status and position.140. For several examples of these formulae, see F. C. Conybeare and A. J. MacLean, eds. and trans., Rituale Armenorum (Oxford: Clarendon, 1905), 388–93. In Christian liturgical exorcisms of the early church anachōrein was oft en employed as well. Th is formulation can be traced to the third-century-CE text. Th e Testament of Solomon; the word’s frequent appearance in the Christian liturgical context suggests a relationship between Solomonic exorcistic practices and Christian baptismal exorcisms: see Kotansky, Greek Magical Amu-lets, #35, #167–80, esp. #176.

Wilken, Jews and Christians in Antioch in the First Four Centuries of the Common Era, Sources for Biblical Study 13 (Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1978), 25–52, 83–126. For a larger conversation regarding the issue of Judaizers within the church, see Simon, Verus Israel, 305–38, specifi c to John Chrysostom 321–28.2. John Chrysostom mentions the Feast of the Trumpets on fi ve separate occasions: Adv. Jud. 1.1.5, 4.7.4–5.3. For the Greek, see PG 48:843–942. I refer deliberately to the sermons as Adversus Judaeos in order to bring attention back to one of the primary targets of the text: Jews. See the similar comments of John G. Gager, Th e Origins of Anti-Semitism: Attitudes toward Judaism in Pagan and Christian Antiquity (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), 118–19. In the post–World War II era of accountability in Christian scholarship, and with increased interest in the interpretation of Adversus Judaeos literature in particular, scholars grew increasingly more uncomfortable with the unequivocal diabolizing and dehumaniz-ing of Jews found in a great deal of Christian literature. For a historiography of this turn in Christian scholarship, see Adam H. Becker and Annette Yoshiko Reed, eds., Th e Ways Th at Never Parted: Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, TSAJ 95 (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003). In his English translation of the sermons, Paul Harkins (FC 68) intentionally used the title Discourses against Judaizing Christians as part of a noticeable trend in early Christian scholarship to remove the anti-Jewish stain from patris-tic writers such as John Chrysostom. At the same time, debate regarding how to interpret the Adversus Judaeos homilies—in light of this problem—has steadily increased: for rele-vant literature in regard to this debate, see Marcel Simon, “La polémique anti-juive de S. Jean Chrysostome et le mouvement judaïsant d’Antioche,” AIPHOS 4 (1936): 403–21; Adolf M.

All translations of John Chrysostom’s texts are mine, unless otherwise noted. For references to the Greek editions that I have used, see above the Introduction, n. 52.5. John Chrysostom, Adv. Jud. 1.3.1; PG 48:847.6. John Chrysostom, Adv. Jud. 2.3.4–5; PG 48:861. One of the more exciting recent developments in John Chrysostom studies has been the discovery of a large portion of the second homily in the Adversus Judaeos series, which answers a long-standing question regarding the rather abrupt ending to the text; see Wendy Pradels, Rudolf Brändle, and Martin Heimgartner, “Das bisher vermisste Textstück in Johannes Chrysostomus, Adversus Judaeos, Oratio 2,” ZAC 5 (2001): 23–49; and Wendy Pradels, “Lesbos Cod. Gr. 27: Th e Tale of a Discovery,” ZAC 6.1 (2002): 81–89. On the dating of the sermons, see Wendy Pradels, Rudolf Brändle, and Martin Heimgartner, “Th e Sequence and Dating of the Series of John Chrysostom’s Eight Discourses Adversus Judaeos,” ZAC 6.1 (2002): 90–116.7. By referring to diabolization rather than demonization—focusing upon ritual engage-ment rather than rhetorical distancing—this study hopefully provides a diff erent path into the current scholarly conversations on violence in late antique religion. See, e. g., Brent D. Shaw, Sacred Violence: African Christians and Sectarian Hatred in the Age of Augustine (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011); Michael Gaddis, Th ere Is No Crime for Th ose Who Have Christ: Religious Violence in the Christian Roman Empire, TCH 39 (Berke-ley: University of California Press, 2005). My viewpoint aligns closely with that of Th omas Sizgorich in his Violence and Belief in Late Antiquity: Militant Devotion in Christianity and Islam, Divinations: Rereading Late Ancient Religion (Philadelphia: University of Pennsyl-vania Press, 2009). In the chapter “ ‘Th e Devil Spoke from Scripture’: Boundary Mainte-nance and Communal Integrity in Late Antiquity,” Sizgorich claims that John encourages aggressive and confrontational interrogation among congregational members to fortify the community’s borders; in this way, Sizgorich posits, John is attempting to stave off an exter-nal Judaizing threat. Sizgorich’s reading is especially compelling because of his recognition of actual material violence in the creation of religious boundaries; consequently, the priest pushes for a mode of confrontation with not only Judaizers but Jews. Sizgorich’s work is exceedingly important in that it properly removes John Chrysostom’s Adversus Judaeos texts from the narrow designation of ritual and ethical reproof against Judaizers and places it under the rubric of violence in fourth-early fi ft h-century Christianization, a discourse led prominently by Sizgorich’s mentor, Harold Drake; see, e.g., H. A. Drake, ed., Violence in Late Antiquity: Perceptions and Practices (Aldershot, UK, and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2006) (conference publication).8. Sandwell, Religious Identity in Late Antiquity, 89, turns to the broader theoretical world with respect to the discursive/rhetorical effi cacy (i.e., identity-construction capacity) of the accusatory or vituperative labels of “magic” and “demons”: “By characterizing Greek religion as magical and demonic . . . Chrysostom was trying to distance it as far as possible from being a legitimate religious choice.” Signifi cantly and fi nally, Sandwell makes a shrewd interpretive move by incorporating the work of James B. Rives, “Magic in Roman Law: Th e Reconstruction of a Crime,” ClAnt 22.2 (2003): 313–39, and C. R. Phillips III, “Nullum Cri-men sine Lege: Socioreligious Sanctions on Magic,” in Faraone and Obbink, Magika Hiera, 260–76, into her reading of the patristic material, for example.

Once again I promote the theorization of Th omas Sizgorich here, and his choice to disrupt the habit of reading violence metaphorically and instead promote the consideration of such language from the standpoint of physical and material violence; see note 7 above. In his book he models an aggressively confrontational interaction of members in John’s com-munity against the Judaizing threat, though in his opposition the notion of the demonic is much more peripheral. As mentioned in the introduction, I consider my own reading of the Adversus Judaeos as contributing to these conversations also.21. Ibid.22. Smith, “Towards Interpreting Demonic Powers,” 429. Here we can see the semantic and hermeneutical problems that arise in choosing between the transliteration “daimon” and the modern (and Christianized) “demon.” While the Greek employs a variety of terms to indicate something approximate to what we now translate as “demon” (e.g., pneuma), daimōn in texts other than elite Christian literature can refer to a morally neutral spiritual entity. In any event, when using terms such as “demon” or “demonic” in the interpretation"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"284 Notes to Pages 95–99of Christian literature, we run the risk of utterly ignoring the enchanted and animistic envi-ronment of late antiquity and reducing Christian writers’ discussions of demons to the construction of a moral or ethical worldview. We miss entirely a much more vital battle to take control and reform an animated world through both their preaching and their ritual practice.23. Ibid., 438–39.24. John Chrysostom, Adv.

Jud. 1.5.1 (PG 48:850; FC 68:18), quoting Matt. 27:25; John’s rhetoric derives from the well-known rhetorical type known as psogos, the oratorical oppo-site of the encomium. Wilken, John Chrysostom and the Jews, 116, describes this category of sophistic invective as “the use of half-truths, innuendo, guilt by association, abusive and incendiary language, lascivious comparisons, and in all, excess and exaggeration.” Libanius includes many examples in his handbook on rhetoric; the Greek text is available in Liban-ius, Progymnasmata: Argumenta orationum Demosthenicarum, vol. 8 (1915) of Förster and Richsteig, eds., Libanii opera, passim; see also his denigration of monks, Or. 30.8 (F.III.91–92); and see n. 57 in chap. 1 of this study.

John makes a sly and sophisticated argument here that surprises in its subtle justifi cation for the termination of Judaism altogether. Most intriguingly, perhaps, his argument rests on the fact that Antiochene Jews engage in public religious spectacle illegally from the perspective of Jewish law itself. In John’s argument, Judaism is a religion that revolves around the High Holidays in the autumn and Passover in the spring—both public festivals. According to John, Antiochene Jews make the claim that such rituals can take place in any synagogue community, and thus Judaism is a universal (or global) religion from the stand-point of ritual practice. John, however, argues the opposite view, and he, of course, argues God’s view for his Christians. What the Antiochene Jews do not realize, then, is that Juda-ism is only a localized religion and, furthermore, that as a religion rooted in the rituals of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Passover, it is limited to one locality: the Second Temple and Jerusalem. But because God has destroyed both, John concludes, Judaism has in eff ect"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 110–115 287been dead for over three hundred years.

Levine, Studies in the History, Archaeology, Geography, and Ethnography of the Land of Israel 2 (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi Insti-tute; Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 1982), 82–85, who also claims that Constan-tine’s letter to Macarius implicitly refers to the discovery of the cross.2.

Hall, Clarendon Ancient History Series (Oxford: Clarendon, 1999) (hereaft er Cameron and Hall, Life of Constantine). All translations of Cyril of Jerusalem’s texts are mine in chapters 4, 5, and 6, unless otherwise noted. With other ancient authors in this chapter, most of the quo-tations are based on published translations; I indicate in the notes when I have altered the translation aft er consulting the original language.3. Th e authenticity of the site of Christ’s tomb and Golgotha is a subject of great debate. Th is is hardly surprising given how much is theologically, confessionally, and professionally at stake in the answer. See Martin Biddle, Th e Tomb of Christ (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Sutton, 1999), 56–57, who claims that it could be the same tomb, but that there is no archaeological evidence to support it; this tomb amidst others outside Jerusalem in the early fi rst century would have been emptied as the city expands in the second century. Joan E. Taylor, “Golgotha: A Reconsideration of the Evidence for the Sites of Jesus’ Crucifi xion and Burial,” NTS 44.2 (1998): 180–203, has argued that the crucifi xion actually took place further south than Chris-tian tradition has suggested; likewise, that the phrase “Golgotha” in biblical accounts more accurately indicates a large vicinity as opposed to a specifi c location. Regarding the site of the crucifi xion, see Melito of Sardis, Peri Pascha 94, cf. 71. For a political reading of Marcarius’s proposed excavation, see Ze’ev Rubin, “Th e Church of the Holy Sepulchre,” 82–85, who has claimed that Constantine’s letter to Macarius implicitly refers to the discovery of the cross.4. Cyril of Jerusalem, Catecheses ad illuminandos 14.5–9, cf. 13.35 (hereaft er Catech. illum.). Not only is Golgotha marginalized physically in the Holy Sepulchre’s courtyard design, Eusebius, in his descriptions of the church (Vit. Const. 3.29–40), completely over-looks the spot. In fact, more than one scholar has been at a loss to explain Eusebius’s com-plete neglect of Golgotha: Rubin, “Th e Church of the Holy Sepulchre,” 85, refers to it as “baffl ing”; Hunt, Holy Land Pilgrimage, 12, uses the word “puzzling.” See the relevant com-ments of Peter W. L. Walker, Holy City, Holy Places? Christian Attitudes to Jerusalem and the Holy Land in the Fourth Century, OECS (Oxford: Clarendon, 1990), esp. 253, who asks, “How could Eusebius possibly have missed such an important and singular phenomenon?”5. Walker, Holy City, Holy Places? 313–22, contends that the title “Holy City of Jerusalem” comes to assume a rather complicated and charged meaning during the early Cons-tantinian and post-Constantinian era. Cyril understands the Christian Jerusalem as the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"288 Notes to Pages 115–119“legitimate inheritor of the best of biblical Jerusalem” (313). By contrast, Eusebius, most likely in a protective eff ort for Caesarea, claims Christianity requires neither a location nor an object: the religion is personal, moral, and rational, and any idea of a “Holy City” in Christianity refers to an immaterial, heavenly future city, not to the present-day physical location of Jerusalem (Demonstratio evangelica 1.6.73; hereaft er Dem. ev.). For Jerusalem’s holy status and its various meanings, see Lorenzo Perrone, “ ‘Th e Mystery of Judaea’ (Jerome, Ep. 46): Th e Holy City of Jerusalem between History and Symbol in Early Christian Th ought,” in Jerusalem: Its Sanctity and Centrality to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, ed.

(Jerusa-lem: Ariel Publishing House; Warminster, England: Aris & Phillips, 1981), 153–63.7. Th e following scholars have begun to recognize deeper meaning in the Bourdeaux Pilgrim: Jás Elsner, “Th e Itinerarium Burdigalense: Politics and Salvation in the Geography of Constantine’s Empire,” JRS 90 (2000): 181–95; Blake Leyerle, “Landscape as Cartography in Early Christian Pilgrimage Narratives,” JAAR 64.1 (1996): 119–43; Glenn Bowman, “ ‘Map-ping History’s Redemption’: Eschatology and Topography in the Itinerarium Burdigalense,” in Levine, Jerusalem: Its Sanctity and Centrality, 163–87; Andrew S.

For general scholarship covering Cyril of Jerusalem’s life and career: without a doubt, Jan Willem Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem: Bishop and City, VCSup 72 (Leiden: Brill, 2004), stands above the rest. Alexis James Doval, Cyril of Jerusalem, Mystagogue: Th e Authorship of the Mystagogic Catecheses, North American Patristic Society, PMS 17 (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2001), provides an important study of Cyril’s mysta-gogical lectures, arguing for their Cyrillian authenticity. Finally, other helpful biographical works include Edward Yarnold, Cyril of Jerusalem, ECF (London and New York: Routledge, 2000).9. I began to develop this idea in Dayna S. Kalleres, “Cultivating True Sight at the Center of the World: Cyril of Jerusalem and the Lenten Catechumenate,” CH 74.3 (2005): 431–59.10.

Two scholars in particular have done work that covers this development and is piv-otal to my own arguments: Patricia Cox Miller, “ ‘Th e Little Blue Flower Is Red’: Relics and the Poetizing of the Body,” JECS 8.2 (2000): 213–36; Georgia Frank, Th e Memory of the Eyes: Pilgrims to Living Saints in Christian Late Antiquity, TCH 30 (Berkeley: University of Cali-fornia Press, 2000).12.

Th is pattern of violence extends as far as the fourth century and the interpretation of foreign invasion into Jerusalem. For example, Maximinus Daia ignores his uncle Galerius’s edict of toleration of 311 CE and orders the intensifi cation of pagan practices and persecu-tion of Christians in the Palestinian region, predominantly in Caesarea, where he is located but stretching to Aelia; see Eusebius, De martyribus Palaestinae 8.11. For Maximinus’s zeal-ous paganism in general, see T. Oliver Nicholson, “Th e ‘Pagan Churches’ of Maximinus Daia and Julian the Apostate,” JEH 45.1 (1994): 1–10. Lactantius, De mortibus persecutorum 49, composes a fantastic death description for Maximinus that features failed self-poisoning, self-gorging on dirt, visions/delusions of seeing God, and then pleading for Christ’s forgiveness; compare Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 9.10.14.14. On the genre of apocalyptic eschatological literature developed in intimate relation with the memorialization of the violent assaults upon Jerusalem, starting with the Macca-bean Wars, see John J. Collins, Th e Apocalyptic Imagination: An Introduction to Jewish Apoc-alyptic Literature, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1998), 199–200, who specifi cally mentions 4 Ezra (2 Esdras). In the present study, our selection of texts narrows to a small number that focus directly upon the development of future or apocalyptic sight in reaction to Jerusalem’s (and the Jewish temple’s) destruction, primarily 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch. Here I rely on the following editions and English translations: (the Latin edition used as a reference for 4 Ezra [2 Esdras]) Robert L. Bensly, ed., Th e Fourth Book of Ezra: Th e Latin Version Edited from the MSS., Texts and Studies: Contributions to Biblical and Patris-tic Literature 3.2 (Cambridge: Th e University Press, 1895); (2 Baruch) Pierre Bogaert, trans., Apocalypse de Baruch: Introduction, traduction du syriaque et commentaire, SC 144–45, 2 vols.

Marco Rizzi, Millennium Studies in the Culture and History of the First Millennium CE 30 (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2010), 85–109. Aft er the Bar Kokhba revolt Hadrian undertakes extensive leveling and alterations in 135 CE; what exactly this entails is a matter of archaeological debate.

Peter Schäfer (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003), 241–78. Archaeological evidence also suggests much of this campaign of deliberate destruction had already occurred aft er 70 CE, with the Romans destroying city fortifi cations, public buildings, and large residential quar-ters. Excavations on part of the the southwest area of the Temple Mount reveal great piles of gigantic ashlars (squared stones), which covered the public courtyards and streets serving those who came to worship in the temple during the Herodian period (37–34 BCE)."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"290 Notes to Pages 121–122Th ousands of additional ashlars that once were a part of the upper Temple Mount retaining wall seem to have been deliberately ripped away and thrown downward outside the temple enclosure; see Hillel Geva, “Searching for Roman Jerusalem,” BAR 23.6 (1997), who pro-poses that this was punishment for the Jewish prisoners of war, with the ultimate humilia-tion being forced to destroy their own temple.

For a general discussion of Hadrian’s Aelia Capitolina, see Geva, “Searching for Roman Jerusalem,” 34–45, 72–73.19. Avigad, Discovering Jerusalem, notes that recent excavations on the Cardo Maximus and the Decumanus suggest a much smaller area of inhabited space before 324. See the comments in Günter Stemberger, Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the Fourth Century (Edinburgh: T&T Clark, 2000), 53. Th e famous Byzantine Madaba map features a clear image of the Cardo Maximus, running north to south through the city; it also gives an impression of the shrunken size. For this map, see Kurt Weitzmann, ed., Age of Spirituality: Late Antique and Early Christian Art, Th ird to Seventh Century: Catalogue of the Exhibition (New York: Th e Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1979), 584. Th e Decumanus and Cardo gesture toward Roman topography while also tending to the practicality of urban living and facilitation of trade. For an indispensible reading of Hadrian’s architectural makeover, see Stemberger, Jews and Christians, 2–53.20. Stemberger, ibid., 52, observes that there is little to no archaeological evidence to support this conclusion aside from a small room ravaged by fi re that stands as the sole per-manent structure attesting to Legio X Fretensis; the room is located southwest of the tem-ple. Meir Ben-Dov, Th e Dig at the Temple Mount (Jerusalem: Keter, 1982), 198ff ., esp. 192 (in Hebrew), has suggested the room was reserved for a guard to keep Jews away from the for-bidden space of the Temple; for this reference I am in debt to Stemberger’s quite thorough footnotes. Ben-Dov, Th e Dig at the Temple Mount, 251ff ., has also proposed a temporary tent camp, which could easily be moved; see also Hillel Geva, “Th e Camp of the Tenth Legion in Jerusalem: An Archaeological Restoration,” IEJ 34.4 (1984): 239–54.21.

Th ere is some debate as to whether the temple on this site is a temple to Aphrodite; Jerome, Ep. 58.3, for instance, says that a temple to Jupiter Capitolina stood on top of the site of the resurrection, while a statue to Aphrodite stood at the Rock of the Cross. Scholars have also discussed whether the temple of Aphrodite might have been located on the nearby hill"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 122–124 291where presumably the Tenth Roman legion was stationed (see n. 20 above). Archaeological work, though limited, confi rms a monumental public structure on the site of the Holy Sep-ulchre, which could have been a temple, though it need not have been; there simply is not enough evidence either way; see Biddle, Th e Tomb of Christ, 56; Virgilio C. Corbo, Il Santo Sepolcro di Gerusalemme: Aspetti archeologici dalle origini al periodo crociato, 3 vols., SBFCMa 29 (Jerusalem: Franciscan Printing Press, 1981–82), 1:33–37, 221; Gibson and Taylor, Beneath the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, 65–71; Walker, Holy City, Holy Places? 243–46.26. Gibson and Taylor, Beneath the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, 70, mention a second forum closer to the Temple Mount.27. For a discussion of groups in the Palestinian area, especially aft er Hadrian, see, for example, Fergus Millar, Th e Roman Near East, 31 B.C.–A.D. 337 (Cambridge: Harvard Uni-versity Press, 1993), 348–49; and Joan E. Taylor, Christians and the Holy Places: Th e Myth of Jewish-Christian Origins (Oxford: Clarendon, 1993), 48–56. Hadrian’s changes to the city both topographically and in terms of population impart a drastic change to the standing balance of ethnic and religious demographics. For example, the Jewish-Gentile Christian community supposedly disappears mysteriously, only to return slowly; see Walker, Holy City, Holy Places? 8–9, also 12–13, who has provocatively suggested that very shortly aft er Hadrian’s actions, a Jerusalemite church populated by the native Jewish-Gentile population begins to campaign against the new Aelia church comprised of Gentile colonists (Syrian and Arabic populations). From this model of return Walker draws convincing conclusions that are signifi cant for our own arguments: for example, that the Jerusalem church portrays itself as the guardian of Jerusalemite traditions in comparison to the Aelia neophytes. Simi-larly, the Jerusalem church retains the locations of famous gospel sites and can claim apos-tolic succession (Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 4.6.4), which demonstrates an ecclesiastical authentic-ity that easily trumps any comparative off ering of the Aelia church. Moreover, if this were the case, the Jerusalemite Christian community may have conceivably cultivated or at least been drawn to the apocalyptic eschatological genre; we might then posit that this literature helps form the genetic core of the community, extrapolating possibilities for Cyril’s steward-ship of his congregation.28. Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 10–11. Th e powerful eff ect of the Temple Mount’s empti-ness is not lost on Christians in the fourth century—a sign of God’s passing favor as he moves to render his blessings to Christians.

Lee I. Levine and Zeev Weiss, JRASup 40 (Portsmouth, RI: Journal of Roman Archaeology, 2000), 195–214. Perhaps one of the more intriguing aspects of the Byzantine Madaba map (see n. 19) is the fact of the Temple Mount’s absence: see Jacobs, Remains of the Jews, 139–99, who provides a brief summary of the scholarly debate regarding the meaning of the Temple Mount’s absence.29.

See Dio Cassius, 66.4.1–66.7.2 for extensive coverage of Titus’s siege of the Jerusalem temple and also a description of the Roman soldiers who desert Titus and join the Jewish side and Juda-ism, perhaps motivated by a belief in Jerusalem’s invincibility. Also see Philostratus, Vita Apollonii, 6.29. Eusebius describes the Temple Mount’s conversion to a “Roman farm” with “bulls plowing there, the sacred site sown with seed (Dem. ev. 8.3, cf. 4.13). Th ough Wilken, Th e Land Called Holy, 83, reports Eusebius’s information (Hist. eccl. 3.26) without the slight-est concern about ideological biases, more recently other scholars have noted that the Cae-sarean bishop is probably exaggerating for ideological purposes. Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusa-lem, 3–4, helpfully breaks down the evidence for what we can know.31. See Wharton, Refi guring the Post-Classical City, 98–100, on the symbolic and theo-logical importance of erasure as well as construction in Jerusalem; quote at 99.32. Stemberger, Jews and Christians, 51, citing Ben-Dov, Th e Dig at the Temple Mount, 186–91. Stemberger also notes that a large portion of the original city fortifi cations had been allowed to remain standing. Th e ruins of the temple were still signifi cant enough to serve as a protective fortress for the Byzantines during the Islamic conquests in 613; it is probable that even more of the ruins had been standing four centuries earlier. In the fourth century the Bordeaux Pilgrim adds that the remnants of the Spring of Siloam, the Praetorium of Pontius Pilate, and the Pools of Bethesda are also still visible nearby.33. Wilken, Th e Land Called Holy, 289 n. 5.34. Th at the day of mourning, 9 Av, marks the temple’s destruction is mentioned in Itin. Burd. 592.35. Th e reconstructed text is from Michael Avi-Yonah, Th e Holy Land from the Persian to the Arab Conquests, 536 B.C. to A.D. 640: A Historical Geography, rev. ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House, 1977), 50, drawing upon the commentary of Tertullian (Adv. Jud. 13), Justin Martyr (Dial. 16, 1 Apol. 77), and Eusebius (Hist. eccl. 4.6.3). See also Walker, Holy City, Holy Places? 8 n. 12, quoting the same reconstructed text from Michael Avi-Yonah, Th e Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule: A Political History of Palestine from the Bar Kokhba War to the Arab Conquest (New York: Schocken Books; Jerusalem: Magnes Press, Hebrew University, 1984), 50–51. Scholars generally assume that this attitude is relaxed during the Severan period; see, for example, Avi-Yonah, Th e Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule, 80. Avi-Yonah argues that the edict quickly loses its eff ectiveness and falls into disuse in the travails of the third century; for example, in addition to a regular practice of rabbbinic visi-tation to Aelia, Rabbi Meir takes up residency there (see n. 39 below). See also Shmuel Safrai, “Th e Holy Congregation in Jerusalem,” in Studies in History, ed. David Asheri and Israel Shatzman, ScrHier 23 (Jerusalem: Th e Magnes Press, Th e Hebrew University, 1972), 62–78. Rendel Harris, “Hadrian’s Decree of Expulsion of the Jews from Jerusalem,” HTR 19.2 (1926): 199–206, provides a helpful summary of the texts alluding to this law. Millar, Th e Roman Near East, 348–49, concedes we cannot know how well Hadrian’s edicts of exclusion are upheld; still, eff ectively a Gentile population replaces a Jewish one: Belayche, Iudaea-Palaestina, 19. Amos Kloner and Boaz Zissu, Th e Necropolis of Jerusalem in the Second Tem-ple Period, Interdisciplinary Studies in Ancient Culture and Religion 8 (Leuven: Peeters,"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 125–127 2932007), argue that excavations in the necropolis around the city aft er the Second Temple period suggest no new burial chambers between revolts but some evidence of continued use; aft er the Bar Kokhba revolt, all use of the necropolis ceases.36. For “gazing on the soil inherited from their fathers,” see Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 4.6.3.37. See the discussion in Stemberger, Jews and Christians, 40–43.38. Taylor, Christians and Holy Places, 48–56, esp. 49, who has provided (62–78) a col-lection of the rabbinic material attesting to a Jewish presence in Aelia: (for Rabbis Hanina, Jonathan, and Joshua ben Levi visiting Aelia) Genesis Rabbah 32.19, 81.4; (for Rabbi Meir’s brief stay in Aelia with a group of students) Gen. Rab. 32.19, 81.4; (regarding the “holy com-munity which is in Jerusalem”) Beizah 14b and 21a; cf. E. Mary Smallwood, Th e Jews under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian, SJLA 2, 2nd ed.

Taylor, Christians and Holy Places, 49–51; Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 10, speculates that as a result of the relaxation of the law in the Severan period Jews come to visit Aelia “more openly and freely.” Once we move outside of Aelia into other portions of Palestine, our ancient sources attest more defi nitively to a larger Jewish presence; for example, Epiph-anius, Panarion (Adversus haereses) 30.4.1–12.8, describes the cities of Tiberias and Diocae-sarea to the north of Judah as inhabited almost entirely by Jews—by contrast, he claims that other populations (Hellene, Samaritan, Christian) are not present at all. Eusebius, De mar-tyribus Palaestinae 8.1, lends support to some of Epiphanius’s demographics in his descrip-tion of an entirely Jewish community bearing witness to the martyrdom of 97 Egyptian Christians who labored in the Diocaesarean mines.40. For the argument, see Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 9–10. Also, we must consider the recognition of anti-Jewish rhetoric in Cyril of Jerusalem: Jacobs, Remains of the Jews, 139–49; Irshai, “Th e Christian Appropriation of Jerusalem.”41. Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 9; Itin. Burd. 592; cf. Epiphanius, De mens. et pond. 14 (PG 43:261), who makes similar observations.42. For 4 Ezra (2 Esdras), 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch, and Revelation, for example, see Martha Himmelfarb, Th e Apocalypse: A Brief History (Oxford, UK, and Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), 75–95. For Revelation, see also Adela Yarbro Collins, “Th e Book of Revela-tion,” in Th e Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism, vol. 1, Th e Origins of Apocalypticism in Judaism and Christianity, ed. John J.

It is important to note the diff erences in visionary experiences which are developing in Jewish and early Christian literature at this time. For our part, we are interested in apoc-alyptic visionaries revealing earthly realities: for example, disclosing future eschatological realities. Th is stands apart from apocalyptic visionaries who experience tours of hell and"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"294 Notes to Pages 127–129heaven. For this diff erence and how it refl ects upon the genre, see Daniel Merkur, “Th e Visionary Practice of Jewish Apocalypticists,” in Th e Psychoanalytic Study of Society, vol. 14, Essays in Honor of Paul Parin, ed. L. Bryce Boyer and Simon A. Grolnik (Hillsdale: Analytic Press, 1989), 119–48. Regarding scholarly reluctance to treat visionary religious experience in the genre of Jewish apocalypse, see Michael E. Stone, Ancient Judaism: New Visions and Views (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2011), 94, and his response, 95–97. For an interesting diachronic consideration of the history of apocalyptic visionaries, with Jerusalem at its center, see Maria Leppäkari, Apocalyptic Representations of Jerusalem (Leiden: Brill, 2006), 77–127.44. See Benjamin E. Reynolds, “Th e Otherworldly Mediators in 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch: A Comparison with Angelic Mediators in Ascent Apocalypses and in Daniel, Ezekiel, and Zechariah,” in Henze and Boccaccini, Fourth Ezra and Second Baruch, 175–94, who discerns a particular type of angelic aid in 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch, set apart once again from guides in visionary tours of heaven and hell. In the cases of 4 Ezra (2 Esdras), Uriel answers questions that help guide and shape the experience; more importantly, perhaps, Uriel’s answers and instructions to Ezra provide a ritual agenda enabling the visionary experience.45. 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch lend themselves easily to comparative work for the reasons mentioned in the previous note; these two texts are also useful in unpacking the visionary experience Cyril theorizes in Jerusalem. For example, see John J. Collins, Th e Apocalyptic Imagination, 194–232. See also the collection of essays edited by Henze and Boc-caccini, Fourth Ezra and Second Baruch; several essays within this book provide helpful context for fourth-century Aelia/Jerusalem, establishing the ground for comparison: Mat-thias Henze, “4 Ezra and 2 Baruch: Th e Status Quaestionis,” 3–30; Adela Yarbro Collins, “Th e Uses of Apocalyptic Eschatology,” 253–70; Reynolds, “Th e Otherworldly Mediators,” 175–94; and Lester L. Grabbe, “4 Ezra and 2 Baruch in Social and Historical Perspective,” 221–36. On 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch as well as Revelation within a larger survey of Jewish and early Christian literature dealing with the Temple and Jerusalem, see Michael E. Stone, “Reactions to Destructions of the Second Temple: Th eology, Perception and Conver-sion,” JSJ 12.2 (1981): 195–204.46. Both 4 Ezra (2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch are invested in drawing a strict line between insiders and outsiders—a measure of protection or defense in the face of violent persecu-tion. To that end, both texts explore questions of theodicy in the wake of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish Temple; see Tom W. Willett, Eschatology in the Th eodicies of 2 Baruch and 2 Ezra, Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha Supplement 4 (Sheffi eld, England: Sheffi eld Academic Press, 1989). For Cyril, the motivation changes from theodicy to authority: who has the right to claim or dictate the true image of Jerusalem and Jesus Christ’s importance to that image.47.

Similarly, Egeria (Itin. 48.1) later asserts that Constantine dedicated the Martyrium on the same day that Solomon had dedicated the temple centuries earlier. Here is a suitable place to remind ourselves of the religious plurality of both Aelia and Syria Pal-aestina in general. We might consider how aspects of the Holy Sepulchre’s construction not only serve to promote a particular version of Christ, but also how church leaders co-opt its architectural iconography and ritual practice (e.g., the Anastasis) to target and demonize and diabolize specifi c forms of religious competition, such as Judaism, Greek cult, and other Christianities.

Cyril is building upon the basics of a liturgical program left over from the early Con-stantinian period rather than starting new entirely, but his manner of manipulating and changing the program is radical and surely refl ects his episcopal desire to distance his con-gregation from Jews, Samaritans, Greeks, and other Christian groups. See Yarnold, Cyril of Jerusalem, 55; also on liturgical practice in Jerusalem, including Cyril’s own infl uence, 33–55. See also Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 173. Finally, indispensable here is Baldovin, Urban Character of Christian Worship, 83, who pushes an important shift in liturgical studies that has resulted in increased attention to context as much as text; in so doing he counters many long-held assumptions regarding liturgical practices in general and Jerusalem’s stational liturgy in particular; for example, he lodges an important critique against Gregory Dix, Th e Shape of Liturgy, 2nd ed. (London: Continuum, 2005), who proposes that the fourth century introduces a change in the concept of time—moving from earlier eschatological designs.2. In this chapter, all the translations of Cyril of Jerusalem’s Catecheses ad illuminandos, including his Protocatechesis, are my own. For the Greek text I have consulted a standard edition that is still quite valuable: Reischl and Rupp, Cyrilli Hierosolymorum archiepiscopi opera (cited as R&R; for bibliographical information see the introduction of this study,"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 149–151 299n. 53). Although I do not quote from it, an English translation is also available for most pas-sages: Stephenson and McCauley, Th e Works of St. Cyril, 2 vols. (cited as FC 61 or FC 64; for bibliographical information see the introduction of this study, n. 53). Quotations of other ancient authors’ texts are taken from published translations; the information is provided in the notes.3. Th e present quote is a composite of Cyril of Jerusalem, Catech. illum. 13.12, 13, 17 (R&R 2:66, 68–70; FC 64:13–14, 15–16).4. Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 35, also dates Cyril’s baptismal instructions to 350/351.

Constantius 12. In the history of Cyril’s three exiles, one can read a fundamental tension that developed between Acacius/Eusebius and Cyril/Macarius, as well as between Caesarea as the large metropolitan of the Syria Palestina region and Aelia/Jerusalem as a small backwater town: Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 38–45; also Socrates of Constantinople, Hist. eccl. 2.42.6; Sozomen, Hist. eccl. 4.25.1.6.

Of course Cyril’s model of baptismal transformation is hardly the sole model for pilgrimage in the Holy Land; rendering invisible divinity visible long preceded Cyril in Greco-Roman pilgrimage practice. See Jaś Elsner and Ian Rutherford, eds., Pilgrimage in Graeco-Roman and Early Christian Antiquity: Seeing the Gods (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005); see also Béatrice Caseau’s eloquent and important survey “Sacred Landscapes,” in Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World, ed.

Pilgrimage, especially the link between pilgrimage practice and perceiving holiness, has become one of the more fertile areas of late antique scholarship in the past decade, and an exhaustive bibliography is infeasible. Two key titles in the fi eld, which aid in illuminating Cyril’s views as well, are Frankfurter, Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt, and Susanna Elm, “Perceptions of Jerusalem Pilgrimage as Refl ected in Two Early Sources on Female Pilgrimage (3rd and 4th Centuries A.D.),” StPatr 20 (1989): 219–23.

Cyril of Jerusalem, Proto. 16 (R&R 1:22; FC 61:83). Cyril deliberately constructs this entire section using the linked New Testament themes of spiritual discernment, apocalypti-cism, and spiritual warfare, relying on Ephesians 6, 1 John, and 2 Th essalonians. Cyril lays the groundwork here for an apocalyptic framework that reemerges again in his fi ft eenth catechetical lecture when he turns to the same New Testament passages to discuss the rev-elation of the antichrist. For example, Proto. 16 off ers evidence that supports the cohesive and consistent apocalyptic eschatology throughout Catech. illum. 15. We will discuss this in greater detail in the next chapter. Cyril establishes in the Protocatechesis an apocalyptic framework for the whole series, through which he then reveals the antidemonic and spiritual-warfare themes in greater depth in later lectures, especially in Catech. illum. 15. Cyril’s artistry in weaving 1 John 4:1ff . into the Protocatechesis (and later again in Catech. illum. 15) becomes clear through simple comparison. Cyril molds his words—“attend not then to the lips of the speaker of guile, but to the spirit of belief and deceit who works in him”—to echo the much longer, substantive passage in 1 John 4:1–3 (NRSV): “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the fl esh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming; and now it is already in the world.”42. Cyril of Jerusalem, Catech. illum. 4.37 (R&R 1:130–31; FC 61:137–38).

Cyril confers many titles upon Jesus, including calling him the one who “presides over the combatants, and crowns the victors” (Catech. illum. 17.13 [R&R 2:266–68; FC 64:105]). When describing baptism, particularly in reference to Acts 2:2, Cyril describes an almost violent assault upon the body that empowers the baptized to engage in subsequent battle for the kingdom of God: “For suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, signifying the presence of him who was to grant power to men to seize with violence the kingdom of God.” Catech. illum. 17.14 (R&R 2:268; FC 64:105).66.

In scholarship, millennialism no longer refers to the biblical one-thousand-year period of Christ’s reign on earth; current scholarly interpreters of millennialism or millenarianism refer instead to a perfect period on earth or in God’s kingdom when collective salvation is secured and human limitations have been overcome. Millennialism in this defi nition depends upon the view that salvation is imminent. In fact, the imminent nature of expectation infl u-ences the religious pattern strongly: the sense of the imminence expresses a strong power over people, drawing them in to the new organization, compelling them to change their lives. For this defi nition see Catherine Wessinger, “Introduction: Th e Interacting Dynamics of Millen-nial Beliefs, Persecution, and Violence,” in Millennialism, Persecution, and Violence: Historical Cases, ed.

For the earliest accounts, see Socrates of Constantinople, Hist. eccl. 2.38; Sozomen, Hist. eccl."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"306 Notes to Pages 182–1902.20, 4.20; Jerome, Chron. 12 (PL 27.502–3). It is diffi cult, if not impossible, to determine Cyril’s position upon his succession. Socrates and Sozomen report that Acacius of Caesarea and Patrophilus of Scythopolis had conspired to usurp Maximus’s throne by placing Cyril in power.39. Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 39–47.40. Ibid.41. Ibid., 41.42. Ibid., 42 n. 50.43. Cyril of Jerusalem, Catech. illum. 15.9 (R&R 2:164; FC 64:58–59).44. Cyril of Jerusalem, Catech. illum. 15.16 (R&R 2:174; FC 64:63). Cyril expresses grati-tude that the “severe tribulation” God intends will last a few days only—compared to the antichrist, who will last three and a half years. Cyril’s choice of thlipsis moves deliberately away from the word apostasy (apostasia) from 2 Th ess. 2. Apostasia can refer to a revolt, a rejection that involves—in fact forefronts—free will, a voluntary move to react against a ruling power. By contrast, thlipsis means a period of pressure, oppression, affl iction—it can also indicate persecution—like the period that will precede the second coming of Christ. In light of Jerusalem’s past and recent ties to persecution and its problematic, tense relations with both ruling ecclesiastical and imperial power, this word choice is interesting in and of itself. Th lipsis ties Cyril’s apocalyptic language and message more tightly to Th e Shepherd of Hermas (2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 3.6, and the fourth vision in its entirety)—a text we will discuss below.45. 1 John 4:1–3.

Reactions to the letter’s authenticity have been expressed in heated rhetoric; Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 137–38, includes Michael Adler’s early point of view: “[H]ad so noteworthy an event happened in his own see, surely he would have been the fi rst to record it.” By contrast, see the more favo-rable readings in Irshai, “Cyril of Jerusalem,” passim, and Drijvers, Cyril of Jerusalem, 137, both of whom contend that while the author was not Cyril it was someone familiar with Cyrillian episcopal tradition. Both scholars’ arguments are strong and convincing and important contributions to the fi eld of Cyrillian studies. Th e letter’s relevance here relates to its anti-Judaizing aspects, which Irshai correctly addresses. It helps to support the strong sociological infl uence of the violent, dualizing outlook of Cyril’s apocalyptic eschatology, not necessarily immediately, but in the longer term—and, more importantly, in later writ-ers’ continuance of Cyril’s anti-Judaizing vein.71.

By contrast, English trans-lations for all of Ambrose’s other works in this chapter (e.g., De sacramentiis, De mysteriis) are my own. Still seminal in Ambrose scholarship, especially focusing on ecclesiastical/imperial politics, is Hans von Campenhausen, Ambrosius von Mailand als Kirchenpolitiker, AZK 12 (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1929).2. Ambrose, Ep. 77.2 (CSEL 82.3:127; TTH 43:204).3. Ambrose, Ep. 77.2 (CSEL 82.3:127; TTH 43:204).4. Other texts covering the discovery and miracles include Ambrose, Hymn. 11, in Hymnes, ed. Jacques Fontaine and Jean-Louis Charlet et al., Patrimoines–Christianisme (Paris: Cerf, 1992), 487ff .; also Paulinus of Milan, Vita sancti Ambrosii 14; and Augustine, Confessionum libri xiii 9.7.15–16, in which he describes Ambrose’s discovery; cf. the language in Augustine, De civitate Dei 22.8.

Catherine M. Chin, “Th e Bishop’s Two Bodies: Ambrose and the Basilicas of Milan,” CH 79.3 (2010): 531–55, quote at 548 n. 78. In general, a number of scholars have approached the spring crisis—and, more especially, the relic discovery—as a prime exemplum of the shift ing of political dynamics within church/state relations. Th is approach has had the strange, even unintentional, eff ect of catapulting the bishop into modernity as an enlight-ened, rational, and disenchanted Ambrose who quite deliberately chooses to “perform” the"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 200–203 309role of charismatic prophet for an unruly crowd of superstitious, magical-thinking, and easily persuaded Christians. For example, Otto Seeck, Geschichte des Untergangs der antiken We l t , Band 5 (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1913), 5:207, argues that Ambrose stages the Protasius/Gervasius event to support or advance the Nicene cause in Milan—in other words, resolv-ing any tension assumed in a confl ict between Ambrose’s institutional/episcopal (Weber’s priest) and charismatic (Weber’s prophet) actions. Compare a similar view ascribed to Augustine, emphasizing his scepticism; see Courcelle, Recherches, 150. Similarly, von Campenhausen, Ambrosius von Mailand, 189–222, esp. 216, takes both the discovery and the following events in stride as part of his larger sociopolitical reading of church/state rela-tions. By contrast, note the tone of rejection in Edward Gibbon, Th e History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 3:169; cf. Hippolyte Delehaye, Les origines du culte des mar-tyres, 2nd ed., SubsHag 20 (Brussels: Société des bollandistes, 1933), 93. We fi nd a somewhat more complicated reading in Neil B. McLynn, Ambrose of Milan: Church and Court in a Christian Capital, TCH 22 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 212, who compli-ments Ambrose’s ability to manufacture a “signifi cant element of bluff ” in his inventio, in order to take the martyrs to the Ambrosiana as quickly as possible. Signifi cantly, McLynn notes the charismatic signifi cance of the martyr cult as “a channeling of powerful energies too intractable for the bishop to have controlled at will, and too pervasive for him to have thought to try” (215). In this he follows Brown, Th e Cult of the Saints, 37. See also the much more recent Filippo Carlà, “Milan, Ravenna, Rome: Some Refl ections on the Cult of the Saints and on Civic Politics in Late Antique Italy,” RSLR 46.2 (2010), 197–272, esp. 198–211, who focuses on the political importance of the event, but does so within a cultural studies framework and thus attends to the importance of creating a cultural memory that binds the Nicene community together.6. By contrast, Marcia L. Colish, “ ‘Why the Portiana?’: Refl ections on the Milanese Basilica Crisis of 386,” JECS 10.3 (2002): 361–72, esp. 367, has argued convincingly that bap-tisteries and baptismal activity and not basilica possession outright is at the center of the crisis of 386. She notes the relative scarcity of baptisteries in a city with two diff erent Chris-tian communities: one baptistery stands near the Basilica Nova, and another adjacent to the Basilica Vetus; the only other one is at the Portiana, and this baptistery has the double advantage of standing away from the episcopal cluster of buildings at the city center and yet not being outside the city walls.7.

Inscriptions attest to a thriving trade both internationally and nationally. Likewise, inscriptions testify to a thriving construction of buildings, such as mention of the corporation hired to build them. A new problem of crowding also explains the centonarii, a kind of late antique fi re department, and the fabri; see Paredi, Saint Ambrose, 100.

Th ough, as Krautheimer, Th ree Christian Capitals, 70, admits, Milan never manages to attain glory as a caput mundi as did Rome and Constantinople, nevertheless it holds its own among other imperial cities. For Ravenna, see Paredi, Saint Ambrose, 98.13. Paredi, Saint Ambrose, 99. Maximian’s decision to build the walls is prompted by various invasions throughout the third and fourth centuries; during Valerian’s reign (270–275) bands of Marcomanni manage to destroy the surrounding lands and parts of the city; see Paredi, Saint Ambrose, 99.14.

Rather than viewing Justina as a war refugee escaping the dangers in Sirmium, McLynn, Ambrose of Milan, 122, persuasively off ers that a political motivation served as a catalyst for her removal to Milan—that Ambrose’s earlier humiliation of her in Sirmium inspired her decision to start an anti-Ambrose campaign.

Krautheimer, Th ree Christian Capitals, 76–77; noting the quality of construction as well as the chosen location for the church, Krautheimer suggests that no expense was spared. On this point see the laudatory comments made by Athanasius, Apologia ad Con-stantium 7 (PG 25:604ff .).25. Regarding the octagonal baptistery, Colish, “Why the Portiana?” 369, notes a prefer-ence for the octagonal shape in baptisteries; octagonal was the shape conventionally used for mausoleums as well. For the Milanese baptisteries in general, see Enrico Cattaneo, “Appunti sui battisteri antichi di Milano,” Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere: Rendiconti della Classe di Lettere 103 (1969): 849–64. A debate still continues regarding the construction of the baptistery adjacent to the Basilica Nova; see, e.g., Krautheimer, Th ree Christian Capitals, 148 n. 33. Krautheimer proposes that the high quality of the masonry suggests that the baptistery may have attracted the patronage of someone with higher fi nancial fl exibility that Ambrose.

Lorenzo Maggiore in Milano (Milan: Fondazione Treccani degli Alfi eri per la storia di Milano, 1951), are among the fi rst to make the archeological identifi cation of the church with the Portiana. Of seminal importance is Dale Kinney, “Th e Evidence for the Dating of S. Lorenzo in Milan,” JSAH 31.2 (1972): 92–107, who strengthens the case for the Portiana/San Lorenzo identifi cation, arguing that its extramural location suggests it was constructed in a time period of relative calm in imperial/ecclesiastical relations (i.e., during Auxentius’s episco-pacy). Krautheimer, Th ree Christian Capitals, 76–77, 86–92, agrees with the palace church identifi cation, as does Suzanne Lewis, “San Lorenzo Revisited: A Th eodosian Palace Church at Milan,” JSAH 32.3 (1973): 197–222. See also W. Eugene Kleinbauer, “Toward a Dating of San Lorenzo in Milan: Masonry and Building Methods of Milanese Roman and Early Christian Architecture,” Arte Lombarda 13.2 (1968): 1–22, who also argues for a pre-Ambro-sian date for construction. By contrast, McLynn, Ambrose of Milan, 179, cautions against confi rming the identifi cation between the Portiana and the S. Lorenzo.32.

Th e mausoleum is now known as the Sant’Aquilino; theories range widely regarding who was intended for burial in the mausoleum: e.g., Krautheimer, Th ree Christian Capitals, 90–91, suggests it was Gratian; Mark J. Johnson, “On the Burial Places of the Valentinian Dynasty,” Historia 40.4 (1991): 501–6, has also proposed that the mausoleum was intended for Gratian and additionally suggests that the burial of Valentinian II in the mausoleum is likely, but not defi nite. Kinney, “ ‘Capella Regina,’ ” 34–45, and Colish, “Why the Portiana?” 369, both argue that Valentinian I was interred in the chapel.34.

At this point, an ecclesiastic named Damasus is attempting the same, though from a very diff erent position as bishop of Rome; in 371, according to McLynn, ninety bishops gather to discuss the problems that Auxentius poses to Damasus’s plans to establish his leadership of a united and orthodox western church (Ambrose of Milan, 40). However, Val-entian’s continuing support for Auxentius makes it impossible for Damasus and his bishops to do much more than publish and circulate a synodal letter (Confi dimus quidem).51.

Ambrose, Sacr. 3.1.7–2.15 (SC 25:95–100; FC 44:292–94). Within a wide spectrum of late antique sacramental theology, being washed in baptism carries within it, of course, several meanings. Ambrose’s own delineation feeds directly into his understanding of ver-bal power and the eventual power of the baptized Christian in relation to perception spe-cifi c to what can be seen both in the visible and invisible dimensions of Milan. In Sacr. 3, Ambrose describes baptism followed by the “the eff ecting of perception.” First, baptism washes a person free of both personal sin and the endemic error tied to Adam’s fi rst tangle with the serpent: the rite of feet-washing symbolizes the need to wash the venom poured upon Adam’s feet in the primordial phase of sacred history. Secondly, baptism, which initi-ates the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, opens the muddied, blinded, or blocked senses: a person moves from sensory (limited) perception into a state of spiritual perception. Ambrose divides the spiritual senses into seven distinct forms or valences—what he char-acterizes as “virtues”: wisdom, understanding, counsel, strength, knowledge, godliness, holy fear (cf. Isaiah 11:2). Th rough the baptismal washing, a person ascends from a mud-died, blind state of incarnate, corporeal perception to the eyes of the heart and spiritual sight—tantamount to an ability to perceive invisible, cosmological realities fused to the vis-ible and tangible materiality of Milan. Ambrose also discusses the topic in Myst. 8.43 (SC 25:180; FC 44:20–21), where he revels: “Th e people, rich in these insignia, hasten the altar of Christ”; and in Myst. 8.44 he indicates that the sacraments of the church (superior in age and effi cacy to the rituals of the synagogue) can relieve a person’s blindness, extending their visual perception from the visible dimension to the invisible.86.

Orsi, “Abundant History”; he notes (15) an important diff erence between his cri-tique of modern Western historiography and the critiques of Gananath Obeyesekere, Medusa’s Hair: An Essay on Personal Symbols and Religious Experience (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), and Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, Magic, Science, Religion, and the Scope of Rationality, Lewis Henry Morgan Lectures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). While Obeyesekere and Tambiah maintain the binary of modernity and pre-modernity in their critique and in so doing, according to Orsi’s criticism, reify the original dichotomy, he puts presence and modernity into a helix relationship, each swirling around the other. Orsi does, however, generally align his critique of modern historiography with that of Dipesh Chakrabarty, Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Th ought and Historical Dif-ference, Princeton Studies in Culture/Power/History (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000), who has lodged his own critique against modern historiographical and epis-temological regimes. Chakrabarty takes particular aim at the modern insistence “that the human is ontologically singular, that the gods and spirits are in the end ‘social facts’ ” (16).128. Orsi, “Abundant History,” 14; such “abundant events” are ultimately quite separate and deserve their own historiography—as a discourse not of modernity’s dissent but of their own autonomy, refl ecting their own experiences and practices.129.
