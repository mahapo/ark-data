Eventhough separated by time, space and cultural forms, they were linked together by acommon wisdom, a nexus which spans time and space to form a lineage of oral andwritten teaching which continue to this day. In the earliest stages of man’s presentcycle we find records of this tradition in images drawn on cave walls, strange statues,enigmatic diagrams and glyphs too distant to mean much to us now. It is really only inEgypt that we start to find the first records of a fully developed esoteric system, onewhich I may add, still seems unique in its beauty and complexity.The school of Egypt in some sense forms the first link in a chain which spans history,it can be linked to the early esoteric traditions of the Aryans, the Tantric schools ofTartary, the fire priests of Zoroaster and the Mystery Cults of Israel. These form someof the earliest nuclei from which later esoteric traditions evolved and developed. Inthese forms we find some of the most complete occult systems taught and practisedthroughout the Millennia. Since their demise the Gnosis has continued, albeit in adifferent form. While these earlier civilisations offered racial and national centres ofthe Mysteries, the traditions that followed were, for the most part, carried by secretand clandestine bodies. Popularity when it did arrive, did not last for long and soonagain they made a hasty retreat to the shadows. Certainly this was true with theEssene Gnosis as taught by Master Jesus, it was only a very short time after hisTransfiguration before the true teachings could only be passed in secret, and distortedand twisted forms were offered in their stead by the military-political complex thathad become the Church.Taken as a whole the Mystery teachings form what can be best understood as the“Voice of the Gnosis” and it is from this voice that ultimately all authentic esotericteachings come. We have deliberately used the term “Voice” as it represents a livingforce. Far more than just an academic exercise, the Gnosis is alive, it is a lifetransforming vortex, it is the voice originating from a world from which mankind isutterly alienated."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 5The teachings offered in these books may, at first glance, seem to have much incommon with materials you could receive from other occult, esoteric or spiritualorganisation, but there also much that is at variance. The unique thing about theGnostic tradition is that it really comprehends the condition of modern man and hisalienation from the energies which are the source of all illumination. While othertraditions may have “knowledge” to offer, until they come to terms with the natureof the Cosmic battle - the Dualism which is at the centre of modern life, they cannothope to offer real initiation or real spiritual transformation. It is not enough to havethe right techniques or the latest rituals or tools, unless you know why they workand what they need to be used for. Without insight, ritualism is of little or no value.For until we know how to go beyond the things of the lower world there can be noreal wisdom or development. Even if we become masters of matter, unless we havethe power to escape its grip, death still arrives inevitably to the master or student.The form we have used in outlining the Gnosis is to offer the original Mysteryteachings coupled with research and validation from modern sources. We believethat it is of great value to see the way in which philosophical, scientific andpsychological research has validated much of what has been known for centurieswithin the Gnostic schools. But this, of course, has it limits. While modernpsychology and science may agree with us that there are altered states of being,even perhaps other dimensions, it is only the Gnostic who realises that through“correspondence” the altered state can be used as a gateway to explore the worldoutside. Certainly it is also only the Gnostic who undertakes the adventure to getthere.By using the master keys provided in the Gnostic and esoteric traditions andcorrelating these with modern research, The Institute for Gnostic Studies can offeryou techniques and theories which will change the way you experience yourself andthe world forever. And this, by the way, is the aim of the Gnosis, the transformationof lead into gold, man into God, the transfiguration of the student from a seeker ofthe Mysteries to “a partaker of the Gnosis”.In the past such experiences have remained largely unexplored, they have beendimensions only dreamed of by madman, experienced by mystics, mastered by"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 6magicians and embodied by Avatars. However, today, as the Omega Day fastapproaches, we offer the challenge of uncharted dimensions and new worlds, whichcan not only be explored, but used to develop undreamed of levels of post-humanpotential.X"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 7What is truth ? This is a question that is central to understanding life as we know it.It is never an easy question to answer. Two thousand years ago Pilate asked Jesusthe same question and it seems we haven't come much further, though society hasprogressed in many other ways. Gnostic Theurgy is the first of a series of volumeswhich have been meticulously researched to outline what we believe to be a majorre-evaluation of man’s concept of Truth. While nobody can claim to have \"the wholetruth\" we can claim that we have re-discovered the essential Gnosis behind thevarious spiritual systems as they apply to modern man. We have found enoughpieces of the puzzle to offer a comprehensive understanding of what is happeningbehind the world of appearances.What is Truth ?What is Truth ?The best way to understand the question of Truth is to travel back to Ancient Greeceand examine the allegory of the cave as used by Plato. This allegory, beyond allothers, offers us a real insight into the problem of what truth is. Plato sees all ofhumanity as prisoners, each of us has been kept chained in a subterranean cavernfrom birth, facing a dark wall. Only a very small amount of light enters the cavernand this comes from a small opening high overhead. Because of our chains, we lookin opposite direction and hence can only observe the dark shadows which pass alongthe wall we are facing. These shadows are cast by the men and occurrences of theupper world beyond the overhead opening. Our perceptions and hence of theshadows and reflections, Platos major contemplation was on what would occur if oneof us escaped from the cave ?Plato’s answer is found in his work The Republic, where Socrates tells us that at firstthe escaped prisoner would be blinded by the strength of the light of the upper worldand would retreat back to the shadows. But only for a while....."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 8He would need, then, to grow accustomed before he could seethings in that upper world. At first it would be easiest to makeout shadows, and then the images of men and things reflected inwater, and later on the things themselves. After that, it would beeasier to watch the heavenly bodies and the sky itself by night,looking at the light of the moon and stars rather than the Sun andthe Suns light in the day time...Last of all, he would be able tolook at the Sun and contemplate its nature, not as it appearswhen reflected in water or any alien medium, but as it is in itselfin its own domain....And now he would begin to draw theconclusion that it is the Sun that produces the seasons and thecourse of the year and controls everything in the visible worldand moreover is in a way the cause of all that he and hiscompanions used to see .Republic, Plato. 516ff.Plato, then, is illustrating for us the state of Man. His insight is clear and precise.Man is chained by his attachment to matter and his fallen condition. The only realityhe sees is a reflection and forms a illusionary world around him. This is known as theDialectic System or the World of the Archons. The true source of all things is foundin the world of Ideals - the spiritual planes. In the Gnostic school these are known asthe Static System or The Treasury of Light.The allegory of Plato is an important place to start as it gives us a keen understandingof mans search for meaning. Man search is a battle, a Cosmic Battle, between twodistinct systems. In many traditions these two distinct systems are not only seen to beat odds with each other, but in antagonism and conflict. For if the same force that putman in chains is manipulating the reflections, then surely a battle to achieveliberation is necessary. Sometimes this battle is seen in cosmic and \"otherworldlyterms\", while in others it is shown in all its bloodthirsty realism. At the same time,the battle needs to be seen in relation to why we are on earth, who or what put ushere and what the goal of life is. To understand this battle, and what it means formankind requires that we re-evaluate our beliefs and concepts. Over the years that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 9we have researched these volumes, we slowly came to realise that many of ourgenerally held beliefs were actually created and sustained by a system that is totallyalien to our life-stream. Accordingly, when the real truth became obvious to us it wasa shock - quite a shock ! Particularly because it was so radically different fromeverything we had assumed was correct. I realise that starting this volume bydiscussing \"the battle\" will immediately turn people off. What are you talking about,you may ask ? Satan ? Demons ? UFO's ? Before we answer that you will have tostudy this text and reach an understanding of a new worldview, a Gnostic worldview.Preconceptions and GnosisPreconceptions and GnosisWhen we consider lanuage and knowledge, an important issue arises. The issue isthat many (perhaps most) of the concepts, beliefs and mental structures mankind hasare artificial, they have evolved as the \"powers that be\" would like them to evolve.Hence to really understand what we are talking about you need to put aside yourpre-conceptions. Now this will be difficult, so many words have connotations whichhave been deliberately programmed to have us react in certain ways. We havedeveloped certain \"understandings\" of Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Democracy,Politics etc..... all of which may or may not be true, but nevertheless all of whichprobably originated from the system around us, rather than from within ourselves. Itis always important to realise the extent to which language can be moulded to suitdifferent worldviews and used to create specific reactions and impressions. In someways we might agree with the discussion in Alice in Wonderland between HumptyDumpty and Alice...“When I use a word” Humpty Dumpty said... \"it means justwhat I choose it to mean - neither more nor less\".“The question is” said Alice, “whether you can make wordsmean so many different things”.“The question is” said Humpty, “which is to be the Master -that's all”.Through the Looking Glass.Lewis Carroll."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 10To appreciate the Gnostic worldview you will need to put aside your beliefs andassumptions and reconsider most of what you have been taught. It is imperative thatyou understand the terms we use and the context they are used in. Many of the wordsand concepts we present, though obviously from the language of the Christiantradition, have little or no connection to the concepts of the same name in modernChristianity !Through our research, we have begun to reconstruct the Mystery Teachings, theinner teachings of the Gnosis. Hence, what we have discovered is very different fromwhat the \"so called\" Christian Churches, Occult organisations and other organisedreligions and philosophies teach today. Now, stop for a moment and consider thefact that we have already used a number of these programmed \"buzz words\"...Christian, Church, Occult, Esoteric, Mystery teachings.....and each of these will trigger a certain association for you. For example, you wouldprobably relate the term Occult to something sinister and evil, and yet the word itselfsimply means “hidden”. Members of the medical profession, for example, use theterm occult bleeding for bleeding which comes from an unknown source. Hardlysinister or demonic I would suggest. Again and again we must emphasise that tounderstand and appreciate the Gnostic worldview you need to put aside the associa-tions, prejudices and pre-conceptions you have and consider new meanings for theterms that are used. It is important for you to understand the language we use in thecontext of how we use it, and not in terms of prevailing religious terminology. Weare not asking you to just accept everything we say or blindly agree with ourredefinition of old terms. What we are asking you do to is temporally suspenddisbelief, enter into our Gnosis and only make a decision after you have seen thewhole picture.So what do all these strange terms mean ?So what do all these strange terms mean ?The term Gnosis comes from the Greek word meaning “to know”, but it means morethan “head knowledge”, it means to experience, to grasp, to “see”. Gnosis is theprocess through which the seeker of spiritual wisdom experiences the divine and istransformed."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 11The teachings which make this transformation possible are considered MysteryTeachings because they embody the most ancient wisdom, the essential essencebehind the worlds religious and ideological systems.In this sense they are Esoteric, eso - meaning inner, they are the inner teachings thatare behind or beyond the secular, they are core religious wisdom available to thefew.They are Occult in that they are secret, hidden or unknown.They are Religious in the sense that religion means “to bind back”, “to return to thesource or origin”. These teachings are those which lead back to the spiritual world,the Treasury of Light from which we have become alienated.But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that theteachings here, however fragmentary and incomplete, belongneither to the Hindus, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor theEgyptian religion, nor to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or Chris-tianity exclusively.

That is the question. The logical place might be at the beginning,but that opens the biggest “can of worms” within the Gnostic system. For theGnostic, things are not as they seem and the material world is very different from thatwhich is perceived at first examination. If we are to start at the beginning then wehave to consider exactly what we are talking about. The beginning of what ? Thebeginning of everything, you may say, but what exactly are we discussing ? What is“everything” ? This may seem like semantics, but it is imperative that we understandwhat we are discussing clearly, as it forms the very foundation upon which we willbuild. To define what we are discussing, let us suggest that time and all related forces(such as space and matter) may be described in such a way as to form a line, onwhich we can define four major events. That which is before (even beyond) theframework of the line, the start of the line (the Alpha Event), the line itself and theend of the line (the Omega Point). (Fig 1). For ease, let us call this line ‘The CosmicTimeline”. From the Gnostic understanding what which exists before and beyond theTimeline is Perfection, the Treasury of Light (we will return to this soon), the end ofthe Timeline is the Omega Day or the Apocalypse, the timeline itself is formed by thevarious stages of human development, while the Alpha Event is how time, space andmatter began. It is not the point where or when everything began, but only the point Ages or Yugas.Figure OneThe Alpha EventThe Omega Day"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 14at which time and matter began. This is an important point as the central questionsfor the Gnostic are all related to the concept of time. How did the present systemdevelop ? What caused space, time and matter ? By association what caused pain,suffering and death ? For if there is time, there is entropy and therefore there isdecay, suffering and finally cessation of time or death. This Alpha event then is themajor starting point for how we understand the Gnostic system, because how weperceive matter and the development of matter, influences our whole view of life andthe world.The Nature of MythThe Nature of MythOne of the major problems with comprehending the truth of the Alpha Event is thatin the many diverse Gnostic and religious traditions this event is presented in somany different ways and via so many different symbol-systems. On one level wemay read the high-browed philosophical approach of the Greek Mysteries, and onthe other, we may read about the bloody battle between \"the forces of light anddarkness\" or the literal expulsion of Satan from Heaven. At first these traditions mayseem disparate and it may seem advantageous to jettison one or the other dependingon your own level of comprehension. However, if we examine these varioustraditions in more detail, we may discern a common foundation and come to therealisation that the problem is one of religious or symbolic language rather than truth.When we are teaching children about mathematics, we may discuss apples andorange, trees and coins, however, as adults we enter into the world of algebra andequations. Nobody really considers these two different approaches to be in conflict,we simply realise that a different set of metaphors are being used to explain the sameessential truth. In the Gnostic tradition the same is undoubtedly true. Whether, forexample, we speak of an error arising in the divine mind, an opposite appearing as areflection of the Logos or of Satan being expelled from heaven, we are simply usingdifferent metaphors for the same cosmic event. It seems that many twentieth-centuryreligious movements have become so locked into semantics that they end up arguingabout things which are in reality, only different perspectives of the same truth."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 15When we examine the gospels we find ample evidence for different appreciations ofthe divine mysteries, Jesus spends an inordinate amount of time discussing theimportance of parables, and seems to delight in using stories with multiple meanings.Even the numerical descriptions of his disciples in the Gospels have such an applica-tion...there are 12 disciples, 70 outer disciples and then the multitudes. Here we havean obviously hierarchical structure.The Twelve DisciplesWho are symbolic of twelve signs of the Zodiac and the twelve tribes of Israel. Theymay be related to the innermost teachings - The Esoteric mysteries.The Seventy DisciplesWho are symbolic of the seven rays and the seven days of creation etc. They may berelated to the Mesoteric or intermediate teachings.The MultitudesWho are symbolic of the Exoteric or outer teachings.To understand the Alpha Event we need to consider the various myths, legends andreligious stories and deduce the essential event from behind them. Due considerationshould be given to the way in which myth and legend form the language or symbolsystem of the Mysteries. (See Fig 2).Myths and Legends of Cosmic ErrorMyths and Legends of Cosmic ErrorIn the Biblical account we read of an archangel who rebels against the cosmic orderand is thrown from the heavens. His angelic nature is lost and he becomes a fallenbeing. His name Lucifer means light bearer and accordingly, we have a light bearerwho is transformed into a dark force.

(In Gnostic terms the expulsion from Edenrepresents the Soul entering matter). There are many variantions on this theme.In some Gnostic traditions the force of the universe expands and it’s final manifesta-tion is Sophia or Wisdom. Out of a yearning to know the original Creator she givesbirth to a demi-God, Ialdabaoth who in turn creates the material world. He becomesconceited and arrogant, and his creation (matter) becomes fallen and trapped withinhis dominion. In this legend the God of the Old testament is seen as evil and Christis the only emissary of the light world.In another tradition Satanel (the fallen one) creates the physical world, but hiscreation is sterile and marred. Yahweh as the emissary of light rectifies this falsecreation by breathing life into shells Satanel has formed. However, the fallen worldcannot be fully rectified and a mixed system of light and darkness is formed.If we wish to move into another realm of myth, we could try a modern legend.

He sets trapsby showing them intricate mind patterns and they become so immersed in thesepatterns that they become locked inside them. As time progresses they become moreand more restricted within these patterns until physical matter results. Older myths ofa similar vein, but with a more “Star Wars” emphasis are found in the Veda’s, wherewe find quite explicit descriptions of space battles between crafts from differentworlds and, perhaps even different dimensions. Each side has weapons of immensepower and battle it out across space and time. There are many other records of suchdescriptions in the sacred Scriptures of other cultures. Each of these tales, no matterhow exoteric, hides an inner truth, though the language varies, the essential corememory is the same.On a deeper level we have the Kabbalistic interpretation of how evil and matterentered the universe. When the source of all things began to evolve into multiplelevels of being, a plateau was reached, at which stage the cosmic light cast areflection, an opposite. This reflection took on a life of its own and became thenegative of the positive form, this reflection became the essence we understand asevil and as a natural expansion of itself, matter was formed.Whichever myth or legend we accept (and we could continue with many from othercultures, traditions and Scriptures) the essential truth is that the Alpha Event was oneof cosmic error. The line of time, space and matter should not have come into being.It is a fallen system, one which is a mixture of light and darkness, but with a tendencytowards darkness. Entropy is the nature of the day, all things suffer and die. TheAlpha Event caused a split in the spiritual worlds, which resulted in a division, adualism between the higher and lower worlds, (the subject of study three) and thehigher and lower bodies (the subject of study four).The Alpha Event forms the central pivot of the Gnostic worldview. If matter is anerror and “The Particles of Light” or Souls are locked within it, then we can begin tocomprehend the duality between matter and spirit, mind and body, Light andDarkness. We can appreciate why the ruling force of the universe is entropy and whyall things decay and die. It also offers us a unique view of history and the state ofhumanity in general."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 18Matter Contra SpiritMatter Contra SpiritMatter and spirit are in conflict. In contradiction to modern wholistic philosophy theGnostic has always known there is a struggle at the core of human experience.Whether we consider the Biblical view of flesh battling Spirit or the cosmic dualismof the Zoroastrians (where Ahura Mazda and Ahriman battle across the universe),the essential truth is that matter and spirit do not work well together. While man’sphysical existence accelerates and his technology reaches greater and greaterheights, the cost has been great, far greater than may be first appreciated. We maytend to believe that evolution has dragged man from the primeval waters of earth andslowly transformed him into the half-divine animal he presently is.But what of his spirit, his “Light Self”, at what point did he “lose his Soul”.Human history can be categorised in lots of different ways, there are systems whichdivide history into seven, eight, even thirty or forty periods depending on whatperspective of history is taken. For our purposes it is interesting to compare thetraditional evolutionary or technological model of history with the Yuga system ofthe early Veda’s The early Vedic system divided history into four ages or Yugas.The system itself is in some sense Gnostic, as it positions the most cultivated age ofman as the first, and the most brutal as the last. The Sanskrit names for the four agesare Krita or Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga. These can alsobe correlated to the Greek tradition of dividing history into ages of Gold, Silver,Bronze and Iron. The Krita Yuga is the Golden Age, the age of Spirit and from thereonwards things get successively worse until the Kali age, which ends in an apoca-lypse of water and fire.The evolutionary or technological worldview sees human life from a materialisticangle. Life has evolved from amoeba to human, becoming more and more complexwith related advances in culture and technology. When two worldviews as juxtaposi-tioned and considered in the light of the Alpha Event, some interesting things cometo our attention."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 19If we decided to draw a chart using the vertical bar to represents degrees of matterand spirit, matter in the lower corner, spirit in the higher, and we use the horizontalbar to represent the flow of time, the conflict between matter and spirit becomesobvious. (See Fig 3) While the golden age of Spirit was occurring in the higherworlds, matter was only just beginning to bubble and burst in the amoebic stew. Asmatter evolved further and further, spirit in inverse proportion has had less and lessinfluence. As we reach towards the end of our hypothetical timeline (the OmegaPoint), matter has reached it highest pinnacle, while spirit is at its lowest ebb. If youdoubt the validity of the comparison, turn on your television and watch the “News atSeven” and weep. The Alpha Event explains why there is an ongoing battle betweenspirit and matter and why they work in inverse proportions. It also explains the“grand plan” behind nature itself. Since nature is the result of the Alpha Event, weshould be able to see tell-tale signs within the very mechanism of nature itself tosuggest its malevolent goals and its antipathy to spirit.The Nature of NatureThe Nature of NatureThe only reliable thing about nature is its cycle of suffering, decay and death. Now Iknow that it is said that while nature is cyclic, one thing dies and another is reborn,but that is the point. One thing dies, another is reborn. There is no individual ordiscrete permanence, all is transition. This is the great truth Gautama Buddhapronounced 2,500 years ago and it stands the test of time. Human life as a whole issometimes considered negative entropy, but even this is only real, if you considerphysical matter as your point of reference. If you take into account violence,standards of living, conditions of the earth and so forth mankind’s effect has certainlybeen one of destruction, not evolution. Genes and Memes can also come into thisargument.Our genes program us to reproduce and this has a direct relation to jealousy,violence, territorialism and arguably most of the ills our civilisation experiences.Even the battle between the sexes has a genetic basis, and there is a value (to natureat least) keeping men at war, when only the best survive and hence only the beststock reproduces. Accordingly, good genes continue and nature is pleased. Now Irealise there is a lot of debate about nature versus nurture, however, the fact is thathumanity is manipulated by its genetic programming. If we add to this our under-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 20standing of the Alpha Event, then this programming is at the worst malefic, at itsbest, unsavoury. If we extend this argument to include Memes then it becomeseven more relevant. Memes are the mental equivalent to Genes, it is argued thatidea’s can exist in the collective unconscious of humanity and influence and affectlarge numbers of people, nations and countries. Accordingly, if we accept thehypothesis that Genes are fulfilling the programming of a cosmic error, even a“destructive entity or being” (Okay, lets not go too far), then we can extend this tosee how Memes condition the thinking of humanity and create the 'isms' and'ologies' that curtail the possibly of real spiritual development, awakening orrealisation. Nature, in itself, probably cannot be considered ethically evil, it is,however, fallen - designed in error, and therefore a mixture of Light and Darkness.As nature enters the human sphere, then the dualities which existed in potential,SpiritMatterThe TimelineOmega PointMatter ContraSpirit:The Nature ofThe AlphaEvent.Omega Point Chart of Evolutionary Technological cycle Chart of Evolutionary Technological cycleversus Yuga/Spirit cycle.versus Yuga/Spirit cycle.Fig Three"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 21become dualites of an ethical nature. Humanity can critically reason beyond genesand memes, beyond the Archons, beyond the Alpha Event and return to the higherspiritual worlds. This means that mans error cannot be excused. He must awakenhimself and achieve a rectification of the scheme of things. This rectification,however, can only occur after the nature of the system has been truly compre-hended.The scheme of things in the Gnostic worldview, however, goes far beyond thephysical, or for that matter even the mental. If we accept the hypothesis that otherdimensions, planes, even worlds exist, then there must be hierarchies of fallen andunfallen denizens. Worlds that exist beyond time and space, and worlds trapped inthe mesh of matter. These worlds may be populated, there may be other streams oflife, some waiting to help mankind, to liberate him from this prison while others,perhaps, more malefic to the human lifestream, may wish to keep him in bondage.These other realities, then, are the subject of our next chapter.X"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 22When considering the esoteric traditions regarding man and the universe it issometimes difficult to “get a handle” on what these various planes, dimensions andworlds really mean. At times the ancient tabulations can seem more like “counting theangels on the head of a pin” than anything of real practical value. However, in thetwentieth century as research into holography and light revealed many secrets, theseancient traditions suddenly began to make a lot more sense. In this lesson and the onefollowing we are going to examine both the ancient and modern basis for a multi-dimensional model of the universe and man. The scientific basis for this understandingis found in what we call “The Refraction Model of Reality”.The Refraction Model of RealityThe Refraction Model of RealityThe Refraction Model is based on the simple observation of what occurs when light isrefracted through a prism. If a light is shone through a prism the result is a spectrumof colour. (Fig 4). The ancient Gnostics used the rainbow as a symbol for themulti-faceted nature of the universe, and when we consider the refraction model wecan see why. In simple terms, the earthly image of the refraction of light glyphs orsymbolises something more refined. On a spiritual level, we can contemplate thePrimal Light shining through the prism or matrix of manifestation to create the variousdimensions of the scheme of things which now exist. In theological terms the “FirstCause” energises the Logos or the Word (the Matrix) and the multi-faceted universeresults.In this model we can see three distinct stages:"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 231.The Source of Energy.2.The Matrix.3.The Resulting Spectrum.This can be applied to many different levels of spiritual reality. From a universalperspective it can be seen as a way to understand how the seven planes of existenceare formed and how the One becomes the many. When considering humanity ourmodel is even more expressive, energy is received into the mind/brain complex (theMatrix) and it is distributed through the sevenfold systems in the organism. Thesesystems vary depending on the form of energy received, we have the seven states ofconsciousness, the seven Chakras or, on a more physical level, the seven phases ofthe endocrine system and related physiological structures.Ramifications of the Refraction ModelRamifications of the Refraction ModelWhen we begin to contemplate this model we can start to see how eloquent it reallyis. The first consideration is what variations can be made to effect the spectrum’sresults. Two answers come to mind:Fig 41. Source of Energy2. The Matrix.3. The Resulting Spectrum"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 241.The quantity and/or quality of the Light Source.2.The quality of the Matrix.On a simple level, these straight-forward answers are pregnant with truth. As weshall show later if you vary the quality or quantity of the energy, the spectrum itselfsuffers. Accordingly, since we know that in the lower worlds the spiritual light wereceive is actually a mixture of positive and negative forces, then we can understandhow our experience of reality is influenced and conditioned through the energy wereceive. If we go further and contemplate how the brain/mind complex is pro-grammed with painful memories and neuroses, we can appreciate how energydistributed from the spiritual worlds can be distorted by flaws in the Matrix. Wecan also see how the resulting spectrum (our emotional/physical reality) is condi-tioned and influenced by variations in our ourselves (the Matrix) and the energy wereceive.From the refraction model we can be already deduce some of the basic tasks ofEsoteric Technology..1.To assure that only the highest quality Light is received.2.To refine and purify the Matrix.We will return and consider these issues again later in our lessons, especially whenwe come to consider the effect of having two sources of light and giving dueconsideration to the Alpha Event. For now, let us return to our model and examinehow it can be applied to dimensions and worlds.FlatlandFlatlandIf we accept the Refraction Model, then we can theorise that the universe ismulti-dimensional and probably has various levels of existence. If we consider thisfor a moment and ponder how “real” our dimension seems to us, then perhaps other"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 25levels would be perceived as concrete and real as our own from from within their ownvantagepoint. This very concept was the basis of a fascinating story written byEdwin.A.Abbott in 1884 called “Flatland”. Originally published under the pseudonymof Mr.A.Square, it was found to be the work of an English clergyman and Shake-spearean scholar, whose fascination with mathematics led him to publish this tale. Theimportance of Flatland is that it helps us conceptualise the possibility of altereddimensions from the perspective of geometry. Now, I am not Edwin Abbott andhence, I cannot paraphrase his story in a way he would appreciate, but I can give youthe gist of the tale. (I would also suggest you go a buy a copy, it has been reprinted byDover Books and is available in a very economical edition). Imagine a world of onlytwo dimensions, a world of beings who only know “across and side to side” and haveno knowledge whatsoever of up and down. These entities live in a diverse world ofsquares, triangles, circles as well as many other “nationalities”. They live in a worldmuch like our own, except for one thing, they are flat. Imagine one day Mr.Squareenters his flat home, walks across to his flat lounge and sits down (however that ispossible in two dimensions) and begins to read an even flatter book. Suddenly a voicecomes to him from another dimension, this voice is actually coming from Mr.Jones, atraveller from the dimension of Up, but Mr.Square does not know this. Mr.Squarecannot see him because Up does not exist for Mr.Square, all he experiences is a loudbellowing, but disembodied voice.Mr.Square, by now obviously terrified, demands that this being makes himself knownto him. Mr.Jones with the aim to oblige and enter into inter-dimensional communica-tion, lowers himself towards the ground in Mr.Square's home. Mr.Square cannot seethe totality of Mr.Jones, all he sees is the points and lines of Mr.Jones body wherethey connect to the two dimensional lines of his lounge room. Mr.Square comesquickly to the conclusion that he is communicating with a weird selection of lines andpoints. From this conclusion he decides he is either quite mad or that he has had alittle too much to drink from his flat bottle of Gin.Mr.Jones is not happy, he does not like to be thought of as a weird and disjointedcollection of lines and points. He grasps Mr.Square on his two dimensional shirt andlifts him into the air. Mr.Square is ecstatic and very confused, where is he ? He has no"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 26idea of the dimension of Up and hence cannot understand the experience, as hebegins to hover above the ground he see his friends below, but they cannot see him.However, as he returns to his two-dimensional world, at the moment of contact here-appears, seemingly out of nowhere. He tries to explain but how can theyunderstand dimensions beyond their two dimensional perception ?This tale illustrates the hypothesis of other dimensions, if we attempt to translate acube into two dimensions we know that what we arrive at, is nothing but a reflectionor an approximation. We know that in a cube all lines are of the same length, yet, ina two dimensional representation, the length of the lines seem to vary. According tomodern Geometry if we take a cube and apply it into a further dimension we arriveat what is known as a “Tesseract”. This cannot be illustrated as it exists in fourdimensions, all we can see is its reflection as a cube inside a cube. Theoretically,however, we know it exists !Giving some consideration to this tale we may begin to hypothesise about variousplanes, dimensions, worlds or orders of existence. If we project our cube into higherdimensions, we can create an infinite progression until we reach some final point ofconclusion. If we combine this understanding with our Refraction Model we cancome to see that there must be multiple levels of existence. In the ancient traditionsthis has been known for a long time, and depending on the esoteric tradition, thenumber of these planes is either four or seven.Worlds and PlanesWorlds and PlanesThe Gnostic tradition tends to use two systems of structuring the universe, asevenfold system (derived from the Rosicrucian tradition) and an older fourfoldsystem (derived from the Kabbalah). Both interlock and work well in combination.Together these systems illustrate the multi-dimensional nature of reality, the earth isonly the base plane from which other realities are hidden. There can be many viewsof such a structure, ranging from alternative dimensions and discrete planes tomultiple time tracks, each has their place in our understanding.

Since the Gnostic system is self referencing, we have a situation where eachtruth is dependant on an understanding of others. So please be patient, as you studymore and learn more about the nature of man, the Kabbalah, Chakras and other relatedsubjects, you will gain more insight into how all these fields relate and you will slowlybe able to appreciate the developing Gnostic worldview.Now, you will remember that at our last study we drew sevenparallel lines, diagrammatical, illustrating the seven Kosmic ele-ments, in which work the seven Kosmic Forces of Principles - theenergy-consciousness side of Being. Please note this eveningcarefully that these Elements, the Kosmical Elements are worlds.Call them planes if you like, but really they are worlds. I do notmean globes, necessarily, that is, solid spherical bodies. They arearound and in globes, yet they are truly worlds, spheres of action,spheres of consciousness; and each one of these Kosmical Ele-ments, in addition to being a world, is infilled with its ownhumanities, countless, numberless, innumerable, beyond all hu-man computation.Fundamentals of the Esoteric Philosophy, page 398.Dr.De Purucker,Rider and Company, 1938."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 30A Scientific Model of the Seven PlanesA Scientific Model of the Seven PlanesTo help explain these divisions further we should consider the research ofDr.Timothy Leary. Leary is best known for his infamous psychedelic research in theSixties, and subsequent battles with the law. However, less known is his researchinto the fields of personality and altered states. Prior to his dismissal from HarvardUniversity in 1963 he was considered an “up and coming” light in personalitytyping and his Masters degree paper “The interpersonal diagnosis of personality” isstill considered a classic in the field. In 1971 Leary published “The Politics ofEcstasy” in which he outlined a sevenfold structure of personality as related tofields of activity or streams of consciousness. These can be easily referenced to theseven planes. Leary’s system is interesting in that it offers a unconventionalperspective of the Seven planes, his starting point is Void (Body and Flesh) and thehighest plane is seen as the White Light, existing on an atomic level. His under-standing while based on a scientific model focusing on levels of matter has at thesame time a transcendent characteristic. The Directing Intelligence is for Leary thefocal point for the given reality, while the Communication Centre offers thedistribution point for the given state of consciousness. For example, the brain is theDirecting Intelligence on its level, while it’s distribution network is through thesense organs. The descriptions of Science and Religion give us an inkling of thedeeper nature of each level of consciousness. For example, Leary’s description ofhow Buddhism relates to the Atomic state is quite informative..Buddhism attempts to transcend life and cellular manifestationsand to arrive at the White Light of the Void, the unitaryatomic-electronic flash beyond form.While on the emotion level Leary describes the religious imagery as “middle classCatholicism and devil oriented fundamentalism which are based on the arousal ofemotion and fear”. In connection with each state Leary gives a range of correspon-dences.

When we think back to what we have discussed about the “cosmic error”, wecan summarise it in terms of the creation or action of a secondary spiritual source. Inthe Gnostic interpretation of the Biblical myth for example, we have the defection ofLucifer and a battle between Michael and Satan, which results in the creation ofmatter. In the Zoroastrian model we have Ahura Mazda, the Lord of Light, and thesecondary force as Ahriman. Depending on the period, the Zoroastrian model varies,sometimes we have Spenta Mainyu battling Ahriman, other times we have a more“warrior” version of Ahura Mazda doing battle, however, the duality is still thesame. If we decide to use the Biblical mythology for its symbolic value, we wouldarrive at a structure like that seen illustrated in Fig 6. What is interesting about thisstructure is that if we spent a little time and some imagination, it can be readilytranslated into terms of light and relations between objects. When we undertake suchan interpolation we find we have all the elements for the creation of a hologram. (Fig7). While I agree our religious imagery may only reveal the holographic elements inFig 6SourceMichaelSatanelCosmic BattlecreatesMatterThe Alpha Event or Cosmic Battle in the mythological termsThe Alpha Event or Cosmic Battle in the mythological termsof the Old Testament and related Gnostic Traditions.of the Old Testament and related Gnostic Traditions."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 33a very simplistic and elementary form, it is nevertheless certainly present. If we gofurther and re-consider the early religious mythologies about the fall and the creationof matter in the light of Holography it becomes even more obvious.Holograms are made by exposing a piece of film to laser light,which is scattered by the object being holographed. The film isalso exposed to light coming directly from the laser (the referencebeam). The two beams of light interfere when they reach the filmbecause they have taken different paths and are no longer inphase with each other. The film simply records this interferencepattern, which is the hologram. To reconstruct (view) the image,the hologram is illuminated by a beam of light, which is diffractedby the interference pattern on the film. This reproduces theoriginal surface pattern of the object in three dimensions.Encarta Encyclopaedia,Microsoft.(Fig 7 © Microsoft)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 34The three dimensional image of the hologram is created beforeour eyes in space by two beams of coherent light. The wavesoverlap standing wave patterns over a certain region of spacewhich subtract and add to the light field. Our consciousnesssees the image as real even though there is nothing solid inspace. One can put one hands through the the image whichlooks like a real object. The image is created entirely byinteractions of light distributing (the field of the knower) -consciousness.Nuclear Evolution,Christopher Hills.University of the Trees Press, 1968.In very simple terms (very unscientific I am afraid), the addition of a secondaryforce to our Refraction Model creates a hologram. A hologram which symbolisesthe illusionary nature of matter because it shows that matter is not real or stable.Using the terms of holography we could say that “matter is interference in thepattern of spirit”. From this we can begin to see how the Alpha Event fits into ourmodel. However, there is more, since the Alpha Event changed the quality of ourenergy source, it also changed the resulting spectrum - we now have reality as ahologram, a mirage or illusion. This hologram, in terms of the esoteric tradition,contaminated the planes and caused the lowest reaches of the Desire Plane tobecome what we know as “physical”. It also caused a breach in the spiritual world,and formed what is known in Gnosticism as The Great Schism.The Great SchismThe Great SchismThe Church teaches that God is the source of all perfect andthat the whole world, visible and invisible, is His creation. Yetone does not need to be a philosopher to observe that in thisworld of ours moral and physical evil - suffering, cruelty,decay, death - is abundantly present.

To understand this relevance of this division we have to consider variousissues. Before this event, man was in communication with the Pleroma and existedin a spiritual dimension where there was no death and suffering. At this stage theparticles of light were in union with Spirit for there was no conflict. After the AlphaEvent, all this changed, the lower worlds were decimated and man was banished toa world of matter. This is how death and suffering entered the system. Mankind lostcommunication with the higher spiritual principles and descended into the coils ofmatter.This change transformed the very essence of the earth stream, a chasm was createdbetween the spiritual and material worlds, and man became the centre of the CosmicBattle. While certainly the material world in its beauty still reflects the nature ofLight, in its transience and pain, it reflects the fact that it has fallen and is under thedominion of Darkness. Since the spiritual worlds are under the Laws of Light andthe fallen worlds are under the Laws of Darkness, there is an immense barrierbetween man and the higher worlds.

The intermediateplanes are mixed in their characteristics and while under dialectic law are comprisedof both light and dakrness. The highest spiritual worlds are governed by Static Laws.Man is in the centre of the battle between these two orders or hierarchies, each withits own related hierarchies and powers.It is important to understand the extent to which the Dialectic powers extend. Whenthe lifestream fell, it took with it the spiritual worlds. Accordingly, the spiritualsphere surrounding the earth is an amalgam of good and evil forces. For even thoughthe earth receives emanations of light, it is under the dominion of the Dialecticmasters, these Dialectic masters or rulers are known as The Archons. These Archonshave great power, which extends from the astral shield surrounding the earth far intothe spiritual dimensions. The lower world even attempts to duplicate the higherspiritual planes within its own fallen astral realities, offering a false kingdom for theunwary. A superb description of these “false seven planes” is found in the GnosticGospel of Mary, where we read about the inner dimension of the fourth power, or inour terms the four elements.When the soul had overcome the third power, it went upwardsand saw the fourth power which took seven forms. The firstform is darkness, the second desire, the third ignorance, thefourth is the excitement of death, the fifth is the kingdom of theflesh, the sixth is the foolish wisdom of the flesh and the seventhis the wrathful wisdom. These are the seven powers of Wrath.It is also interesting to note that the magicians who designed the Planetary Kamea’sor Talismans knew this very well. Each planet had a Spirit and an Intelligence, aLight side and a Dark Side, a force of Light and a fallen vortex. When we apply ourunderstanding of this Schism to our model of the planes and worlds, we begin to getan accurate representation of the state of the universe.

When this model is analysed we can see how thevariables explain the various errors which the Alpha Event caused. When weconsider the change in the quantity and quality of the source of Light and the flawscreated in human consciousness by the Alpha Event, the model proves veryworkable. Prior to the Alpha Event the Seven Planes were all spiritual, andrepresented degrees of spiritual essence and the spectrum existed as variations withinthe Light field. However, the Alpha Event added a second power into the equation(and polluted the Matrix to boot) which radically altered the structure of the universe.Matter was formed, and a schism or split was created between the worlds. Thecreation of matter can be seen as the creation of a hologram, an illusion so real thatthe human lifestream was deceived by it. Further, the schism created a warzonewhere two schemes, two Lifestreams, two hierarchies now battle each other throughtime and space.

TheRefraction and Holographic Models are one series of analogies which prove of value.While certainly not the only symbol systems (science is as much a symbol system asreligion), they certainly prove effective when used to explain complex spiritualrealities. It is intriguing to note that the refraction model becomes more and moremeaningful as we move from the higher realms to the lower, when we apply it to thenature of earth and man it is particularly expressive.The Nature of EarthThe Nature of EarthIn the Refraction Model we noticed two major variants in relation to the conditioningof the Spectrumor end result.

The Solar Logos (to which we will devote a lesson later) is the doorwaythrough which both Static and Dialectic currents enter our System. Accordingly, theearth receives varying amounts of positive and negative energies. In addition to theSolar vortex, there are other sources of energy which emanate into our system,however as we wish to keep the model simple, and since their effect is not significantat this point, we will ignore them for the moment.To say the earth is a living system is not unusual. Whether we contemplate the oldoccult concept that the earth has a “soul” or the modern “new age” theology of Gaia,we can readily appreciate that the earth is a complex living system. In esotericterminology, the earth is a Logos and forms the Matrix which receives and relaysenergies from the Solar Sphere. Since these energies are both of a positive andnegative nature, so too is Mother Earth. The Gnostic tradition maintains that theessential earth Logos is a light force (even in some traditions Sophia herself) whichhas been locked in an outer physical cage or prison. This is where the Gnosticconcept of earth is radically different from “earth religions”, to worship the earth is toworship a cage, to be subservient to the earth is to risk annihilation. The earth is aliving field, but like everything else on the physical plane, it is in a state of flux anddrifts between light and darkness.The Earth Logos receives mixed energy currents from the Solar Sphere and transmitsthem to the earth system. (Fig 10) The body or form of the earth is covered by aFig 10+-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 43grid-like pattern of energy lines. These lines (like acupuncture points on the humanbody) relay the energies received and condition the physical and psychic environmentson the earth’s surface. In addition to these lines there are seven earth Chakras which,in some sense, mirror the Chakras which exist on the human body. These Chakras formthe spectrum of earth and radiate the prevailing physical and psychic environmentthrough the dimensions and fields which surround the earth sphere. The form of earthis both physical and psychic, the grids exists on both physical and magnetic-astrallevels and the environments created are both physical and psychic. As the earth forceschange, so do weather patterns, vitality of the earth, continental plates and electro-magnetic thought fields. These thought fields also known as “Eggregores” influencenations, multitudes and individuals and work as a sort of “collective thought-control”to sustain the prevailing state of the earth field and related Lifestreams. (See ourdiscussion on Memes).Man lives in interdependence with these fields and interacts with them, whetherconsciously or unconsciously. As man pollutes and destroys the environment bothphysically and mentally, he influences the nature of the earth grid, which in turn,influences the energies received. In turn, man is influenced by the earth grid and man’sability to receive and utilise the solar currents is conditioned. This symbiotic cyclecontinues as man and earth influence each other. As the Kali Yuga accelerates, thefallen systems tend towards destructiveness and both earth and man receive more andmore negative energy. In turn, this negativity influences the system as a wholeexponentially. The net result is a steady decline towards the Omega Day.The Inter-Dimensional Nature of ManThe Inter-Dimensional Nature of ManThe Refraction Model can also be applied to the nature of man, and helps usunderstand the reality which we experience. The human organism receives the negativeand positive solar currents and radiates them through the matrix of being. In the humanform this matrix varies depending on the level we are discussing, but is generallyrelated to the brain-mind complex. As these energies are received, they are filtered bythe programs inherent within the brain-mind and distributed through a variety of“spectrums” or septenary systems. For example, on the physical level there are seven“brain-circuits” and seven phases of the endocrine system. On the spiritual dimension"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 44man has seven Chakras or psychic centres and seven levels of consciousness.Probably most important of all is the seven bodies or dimensions of man’s nature.Each of these systems influence the others and each is influenced by the variantswithin the energies received and variants within the Matrix. As the brain-mindcomplex forms the Matrix within the human system, then memory complexes,neuroses and thought patterns can radically influence both the energies received andthe resulting state of being on all levels. As mankind lurches towards the end of thecycle, then the energies radiated into each individual become more and morecontaminated and a greater effort is required to extract the light from the mixture. Thisin some sense is the individual nature of the Cosmic Battle. The task for the Gnosticin the Kali Yuga is to extract the light from the energies received and to sustain thepurity of the Human Matrix, this is no easy task.When we begin to discuss the bodies or dimensions of man it becomes imperative thatwe really understand what man really is. In the early Hebrew esoteric traditions onwhich the Bible is based, man is a complex being. He is composed of multiple bodiesor levels, each of which represent a specific strata of activity within his nature andeach of which has a differing origin and goal. The structure of man is basicallyfourfold, as is the custom with the Hebrew system, and is related to the four worldsand the four letters of the Tetragrammaron or secret formula of God (YHVH). (SeeFig 11)The GuphThe GuphThe Guph is the physical body and related electro-magnetic fields. It has no innateimmortality and returns to the earth at death. (In pre-fall man the Guph was simply anelectro-magnetic extension of the higher bodies with no related physical form).The NepheshThe NepheshThe Nephesh is roughly defined as the instinctual bodies. It can be divided into upperand lower forms and these could be related to the Astral and the Etheric bodies.

Ultimately then, cessation of existence, after a cycle of livesand many lost opportunities, becomes the end for most of humanity.When man descended into the fallen world of matter, he lost his right to immortalityand hence became truly mortal. His true self, which had evolved through many cycles,was contaminated by the fall and could not survive in his now degenerated state.Accordingly, his Yechidah or self became powerless, locked in a fallen vehicle andcould exist only as a spark of light - a potential. The only way to reactivate this Self isby the application of the Mysteries found on the Path of Transfiguration.This Transfigurative process involves a spiritual technology whereby man is rebornthrough the power of the Treasury of Light, and the Ruach is united with there-awakened Yechidah. The Yechidah, using the energies of the Ruach and Nephesh isre-developed, and the True Self is revealed. The mixed impersonal current whichinvigorates the fallen system is transmutated, and the individual manifests as an eternal,discrete, identity reflecting the glory of the Pleroma. So, yes man is mortal, but there ishope, there is an opportunity for immortality. It is imperative to realise that immortalityis conditional, man has no right to live forever. His post fall constitution is by naturemortal and contaminated. Only by the power of The Treasury of Light can man bechanged into a immortal form which reflects the majesty and beauty of the Pleroma.Now you have a fairly clear picture of the basic elements of man. However, as westudy further you will find that a more comprehensive and descriptive understanding isrequired. Just like we offered you the Kabbalistic structure of the Four Worlds andthese were expanded into Seven Planes, so too the four bodies can be expanded intoseven.

Indeed, it can be found at the heart of most religions. In theearly Christian Church there were many who taught the doctrine of reincarnation.Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Jerome, Gregoras, Augustine and Irenaeus to namebut a few. It was only during the Council of Nicea in 325 AD that the concept ofreincarnation became unpopular. This disavowal was coupled with the developmentof new teachings regarding the Trinity, eternal hellfire and Purgatory that wereimported into the Church for political reasons by Emperor Constantine. It was only inAD 553 at the Second Council of Constantinople that the Church finally and formallycondemned the doctrine of reincarnation. In both Hinduism and Buddhism reincarna-tion is a central doctrine. In the Bhagavad Gita, we find Krishna expounding thetheory of reincarnation to Arjuna, a wise and powerful warrior. The fascinating thingabout this dialogue is its emphasis on spiritual action. Krishna tells does not tellArjuna to abandon the battle and retire to a monastery, but to return and fight andeven die, if the need be, fighting with detachment born of his knowledge ofreincarnation. “Both I and thou have passed through many births”, Krishna tellsArjuna on the battlefield. In Buddhism reincarnation is also taught, but with adifference. Buddhist tradition maintains that there is no soul or immortal essence, onlyenvironmental factors (Sanskaras) which repeat life after life, re-creating a semblanceof identity in each incarnation.In Ancient Egypt the followers of Amen-Ra derived their belief in reincarnation fromthe course of the sun. As it died in the West and rose again in the East at dawn, so thevital forces sank into the underworld to rise again in a different body. Hermes, thegreat Master of the Mysteries, was one of the earliest Egyptian priests to openlyproclaim the once secret teaching of reincarnation."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 51If a soul, when it has entered the body persists in evil, it does nottaste the fruits of life eternal, but is dragged back again, it reversesits course and takes its way back to creeping things and that illfated soul, having failed to know itself, lives in servitude tonoxious and uncouth bodies, in this doom are vicious soulscondemned.Hermes.While we may not agree to the extent he has taken the concept of reincarnation, thisquote does illustrate his acceptance of the doctrine. Turning to ancient Greece we finda very old tale, a story of Proteus, who could change his shape at will. When an oldman attempted to grab him, hoping to ascertain his real form, Proteus was sleeping asa stone. On being touched he became a plant, when approached again he became aserpent and then transformed into a man and finally a spirit, at which time he flew offinto the sky. Here we clearly have a classical myth being used to outline the esotericteaching of reincarnation as taught within the Greek traditions. The Zohar, a Hebrewmystical and Kabbalistic text, tells us that all souls must undergo reincarnation and thatthe souls of men revolve like a stone that is thrown from a sling that has been spunmany times before finally being let go. Those souls that have reached perfection stayin their holy places, only those which have not completed their perfection are subjectto the wheel of reincarnation or Gilgul.The Truth about ReincarnationThe Truth about ReincarnationAt first this may all seem very heartening, however, if we examine the subject closerwe find that the Gnostic view of reincarnation has little in common with the version ofreincarnations commonly found in the various faiths. It probably would be correct tosay that all they have in common is that “something” reincarnates. In the systems of“pop reincarnation” (so prevalent in new age circles today) reincarnation is seen assome sort of evolutionary process whereby human beings slowly get better and betterover long periods of time and many lives. “Pop reincarnation” also seems to suggestthat all of humanity will achieve the final goal, even if it takes some individuals muchlonger than others. The Gnostic view of reincarnation is totally at variance with this.For the Gnostic the fall into matter was a cosmic error, not part of some grand plan andaccordingly, reincarnation is not a phase of the universal evolutionary scheme, but an"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 52emergency measure. The reason for reincarnation is to offer souls an opportunity toenter the spiritual path, a chance for Transfiguration. Certainly, there is an evolution-ary process involved, but this occurs after one has entered the spiritual path, notbefore. The general trend within the lower world is towards decay and dissolution andthat is certainly illustrated in humanity. If we have been evolving through reincarna-tion for millennia why don’t we see any signs of man’s great “spiritual” evolution.Another problem with the whole concept of reincarnation is that many suppose itcontinues eternally and that everyone is at some point reconciled. This is a strange andunusual adaptation of the theory, and not one found in any of the earlier esoterictraditions. The whole gist of reincarnation in earlier esotericism is that it is a “weedingprocess” whereby the awakened achieve immortality and the rest cease to exist. Thisapproach abounds in myth and legend - the twelve labours of Hercules, the search forthe Holy Grail, the quest for the Golden Fleece - all are focused on a tribulation toachieve a goal, with a real sense of ruin if one looses. What is the use of a divine questif everyone achieves the same end with some simply taking more time than others.No, reincarnation is a process of opportunities, opportunities that if missed, have direconsequences. Reincarnation does not go on forever, in the Vedic tradition there arecertainly “Days and Nights of Brahma” - cycles of creation and cessation. If you donot make it in the creative cycle you will not survive the cessation. In the Biblicaltradition it is much the same. When the Bible talks of the period from creation to theend of the world, it is clearly limiting man’s opportunities to be redeemed. Man’sopportunity for Transfiguration is limited, he does not have an eternity to make up hismind. Again and again we find that reincarnation is for a certain time span only andends with either Ascension or annihilation. There is no room for universal reconcilia-tion in the esoteric tradition.Karma ReconsideredKarma ReconsideredWhat about Karma ? To understand the way in which reincarnation works we have toexamine the effects of our actions. In generally held Christian doctrine there is a beliefthat actions do not really have an effect, we ask for forgiveness and the effects of theact are removed. This is obviously not correct, every action has an effect. Even if the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 53moral (and the If is big !) punishment was removed from an act by asking forforgiveness, the natural result of that act remains ! (For example, say I get Hepatitisfrom a heroin injection, while I may be forgiven for actions associated with myaddiction, I still have to deal with the disease !) This process of cause and effect isfound in many different traditions, in some forms of eastern philosophy it is known asSanskaras or Karma.It should also be clear that when we talk of Karma and Sanskaras, we are not talkingof some ridiculous “tit for tat” karma scheme, where someone steals from you becauseyou stole from them. Karma works on a far more subtle level that this, Karma is theprocess whereby your own achievements (or lack of them) come home to roost. Thepsychic and spiritual environments you create are carried with you from life to life andcreate the conditions of life you experience. The thoughts and memories you createcondition the astral matrix that influences your birth into a particular race, body andfamily. This is far more complex than simple “tit for tat” Karma, motive is far morerelevant than moral platitudes. It is imperative that we remove Karma from the schoolof simpleton morality and back to where it belongs.What Actually Reincarnates ?What Actually Reincarnates ?Now we have removed some of the more popular misconceptions regarding reincarna-tion, we need to consider the major issue. Many schools of reincarnation seem tosuggest that we are little Gods skipping from one life to another collecting experiences,much like some semi-divine travelling salesperson. However, this is again simplyanother ludicrous misconception perpetuated by those who know little. Since theGnostic maintains that the Self cannot fully manifest in the degenerate form which isthe physical body, then it is logical to suggest than in most of humanity the self is in atype of hibernation. If this is so, then it seems unlikely that it can it pass from life tolife. Since Self only exists in potential (prior to entering the spiritual path), then theprevalent view of reincarnation seems to be in error. However the question obviouslyarises, if the Self does not reincarnate what does ? To understand this we need todiscuss the Wave and Particle consideration.If we were to draw a line through time, a line that represented the experience of many"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 54lifetimes. This line could represent the nature of you and your reality. If we stop theline, a particle or point is created, and this could also represent you. The question iswhich is correct ? This may seem strange but it is also a quandary at the centre ofmodern physics. When an atom moves, it leaves a trail. This trail proves the atom’sexistence. However, does the atom exist as a singular, discrete point or particle orjust as a trail. Can you take the atom (or Self) outside time and space and postulatea discrete existence.This question is central to our discussion of reincarnation, and really offers twoanswers to our question what reincarnates ? The first answer is the Particle theory. Itstates that there is an immortal self that reincarnates life after life gaining experienceand developing through the accumulation of wisdom. This is the theory most studentsof Occultism are familiar with. The second theory is that there is a sort of “astralmould” that is conglomerate of Karmic factors developed through various incarna-tions. This mould creates the structures of each life and assembles the mental andspiritual environment that gives a semblance of a self. This understanding of reincar-nation is known as the Wave Theory.The Wave and Particle DebateThe Wave and Particle DebateThroughout the history of occultism there has been a debate between these twoviewpoints. Each of which is based on an understanding of the Self far removed fromthe other. The Particle explanation of the Self seems much favoured by Occultists andthose of a traditional religious persuasion, it seems simpler on the surface, but whencritically examined is not all that it seems. The Wave Theory originated in the variousschools of Vedanta and esoteric Buddhism. It was made popular through thephilosophy of Fredrich Nietzsche and is of great importance to the dualist worldviewinherent within the Gnostic tradition. It is especially relevant for the Gnostic, becauseof the unique way it helps us to understand the Self and the conclusions it forces us tomake about the nature of life.Interestingly enough, these problems are also encountered in the realm of science. Inboth biology and physics the question is raised regarding what the building blocks of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 55life really are. The answer is a debate between waves and particles. If we examinelife, it appears as waves and flows from experience to experience without stopping; itchanges form according to environmental factors and hence gives the impression thatthere is “no point of reference” only movement. Of course, if we froze this waveoutside time and space the result would be a particle or point. The question remains,however, can we go beyond the experiment, can we stop time and space since we arelocked within them ? Here we have the debate. Is this frozen particle beyond spaceand time real, or is the wave the building block of physical and spiritual life. (Fig 13)The Mould TheoryThe Mould TheoryThe Gnostic holds that the particle is only a product of the wave of cause and effectthat flows through time. The Self (prior to Transfiguration) has been isolated due tothe Alpha Event and accordingly, the self that exists in everyday life is a semblanceonly. This false or everyday self is a synthesis of environmental factors and memories.These memories and factors work together within the lower spiritual planes to form asense of will or identity. This identity however, is not eternal, not of the light worlds,but is a contingency that exists only in the lower kingdom. It is nothing more than apersonality or persona, it is not a true Self. This persona is formulated and influencedby the psychic memory system that collects and balances the “causes and effects”The Particle or PointFig 13The Wave or Line"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 56(Karma or Sanskaras) of lifetimes. At death the persona starts to dissolve and then isreformulated when the psychic memory system enters a new body. In some sense theexperience of self or identity in everyday life is illusionary, the self we experience issimply a mask that has been generated by our “Karmic” balance-sheet. The true Selfis way beyond this level of experience. This constant process of reincarnation,reformation of the persona and re-creation of experience leads us into a considerationof the nature of eternal re-occurrence.Eternal Re-OccurrenceEternal Re-OccurrenceIf we accept the mould understanding of the everyday self, then we must consider oneof the major ramifications of this theory, that of eternal re-occurrence. If the “mould”or psychic memory system constantly recreates life again and again from similarKarmic factors, then we have a process of eternal re-occurrence or repetition. Thisdoctrine is not as bizarre as it may first seem, especially when we consider that eventhough the technology of humanity may seem to evolve, man’s problems seem to staymuch the same. Every race seems to suffer the same hardships and difficulties, andeven in our own lives the same issues seem to raise their ugly heads time and timeagain. In the terms of the East it is the cyclic wheel of reincarnation. However, thereis no eternal travelling salesman, simply incarnational masks or personas created asproducts of the wave of eternal re-occurrence.This image seems to many a terrifying vision, a meaningless repetition of pain andsuffering, death and destruction. While we may wish to distance ourselves from sucha perception, when we look life straight in the face these experiences appear to beinherent within human existence. Life exists in days and nights, repetitive cycles ofgreater and greater intensity, a constant re-occurrence of experience until either oneawakens - or the cycle ends. (Eternity in this sense is the existence of time and space,the timeline we spoke of earlier, it is not forever, simply for as long as time and spaceexists.).If our lives are eternally repeating then how can we break the cycle ? How can weescape the inevitable cessation of existence at the end of the age ?"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 57Here is the key to solving the riddle of the wave and the particle dilemma. The Alphaevent (or in more Gnostic terms, the fall of man) has caused the wave of creation to bebrought into action. We are carried along with it and naturally head towardsdestruction. Only by breaking away from this wave can a real Self be created. Only byforcing a particle or point outside of the wave, beyond space and time, can a trueidentity be forged. The process by which this revolution is made is that of Transfigu-ration. The mechanism is the Will to Power.The Will to PowerThe Will to PowerThis is the key to the reality of reincarnation. The self only exists as a projection of theKarmic factors that are around it, and these factors repeat age after age, re-animatingconsciousness and recreating life as we understand it. At the Omega Day allconsciousness is dissolved, for there will no longer be lower forms to contain it, onlythose who have been transfigured, those who have developed the Higher Will willsurvive. Only those who have broken free from the cycles of eternal re-occurrencewill ascend. This secret teaching formed one of the inner doctrines of the earlyesoteric schools. The original Brahmins and Buddhists taught it, but only to initiatesof the highest grades. Kendrick in his text on the Druids, states that the Druids alsobelieved in conditional immortality, and taught that only the “warrior aristocracy”could survive death. Others simply returned to the earth, a form of immortality to besure, but only as a dead body disintegrates into the soil, as nutrients return to theearth, not as a discrete and aware being. In Thus Spake Zarathustra FredrichNietzsche discuses the struggle to go beyond using evolution as a symbol of thisbattle. In one memorable passage he states ..All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; anddo you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back tothe beasts rather than overcome man ?Humanity is a species in transition created by the individualisation of the mould orpsychic memory. The only hope for humanity exists within the individual overcomingthe wave of eternal re-occurrence, and forging a higher Will - a Will to Power. Herewe are not talking of a petty will, a brutal desire to violence or warfare, we are talking"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 58of a momentous inner strength that overcomes the restraints of the body and the flesh,and forges from the structures of the psyche a link to the Light world. The True Selfonly exists in potential, it is a light spark locked within the prison of the mould. Thusthe central message of the Gnosis is to develop an overpowering drive, a will sostrong that it breaks beyond the moral and ethical limits of the lower kingdom, andawakens the true Self and fashions a new man. The great mystery of the Gnosis is thatwe must create our own Inner Selves !The need to go beyond the lower forms of morality, to disdain reproduction and torefuse family may seem to some the most frightening aspect of the Transfigurativeprocess. However, as we go beyond all the limits of the lower kingdoms, a higherethic is experienced. This higher ethic is that of the Pleroma, it is a flash of lightningfrom the throne of the Virgin Spirit. It is a vision of the true orbit of the Star Self thathas been awakened.TransfigurationTransfigurationFor the Gnostic the reality of this world is brutal, it is eternal re-occurrence and death.Man is caught in a cage, this cage is called the “Endura”. The Endura is selfperpetuating and the more man surrounds himself with the illusions of his false self,(his false persona) the stronger the illusion becomes and the farther he gets from histrue origin.Beyond the Endura is the Treasury of Light, the Pleroma which is the fullness of Will.The Pleroma represents the highest spiritual planes that are beyond the reach ofconsciousness contaminated by the Alpha Event. Within every being, hidden withinits the very fibre, is the knowledge of how to overcome the Endura and return home.Beyond all Karmic records and factors exists a memory, a glimpse of the First Estate,of the original nature of man. The process of Transfiguration is to break beyond theEndura (the world of the Archons) and retrieve the Gnosis coded within us, burstingforth with the power of divine Will and formulating an identity of Light substance. Inthe tradition of the Barbelo Gnostics, Sophia herself, feeling guilty after giving birth tothe false creator, hid within his very own creation the keys to man’s liberation and theDemiurge’s downfall."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 59Some ConclusionsSome ConclusionsWhen we examine the cycle of eternal re-occurrence and the nature of Transfigura-tion, we can see how wrong traditional views of reincarnation are. Reincarnation isnot some carefully graded developmental process, but an opportunity to escape thelower worlds, to return to the dimension where real evolution takes place. Luckily forus, there is a knowledge, a wisdom, a Gnosis. A knowledge that can awaken us to thefalseness of our everyday masks and personas, and assist in the process of breakingfree to become what we really are. This transformation is never easy. To go beyondeverything that exists in the lower worlds takes a special awareness, a special Willand that is what being a Gnostic is all about.Real integration is a complete existential disappearance from thisentire nature field, by confluence with another life-spirit, and bythe genesis of another existence adapted to this other life-spirit.This is the purpose of the Gnosis !Unmasking,J.Van Rijckenborgh,1958.X"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 60The mind is central to the spiritual system that we know as Gnosis. Indeed, the wordGnosis, in some sense, means knowledge and hence emphasises the importance of theintellectual path within the esoteric tradition. When we contemplate our earlier modelof the nature of man, we can see what a central role the psyche has. If the brain-mindcomplex is the matrix that radiates energy into the various physical and etheric bodilysystems, then its importance cannot be underplayed. At the same time, we must becautious. In the twentieth century there has been a tendency to “psychologise”everything, whether it be Alchemy, Gnosticism, Magic, Demons, Gods or Spirits,there has been an attempt to interpret everything as products of the mind. Whilecertainly the mind does play a paramount part in the Gnostic tradition, it is ridiculousto assume everything exists in the mind alone. Just as there are forces within thepsyche, there are forces outside of it and psychology must be seen in this context. Tocreate a psycho-centric system is as ludicrous as when the Church taught that theearth was the centre of the Solar System.The House with Many RoomsThe House with Many RoomsCarl Jung describes in his works a dream which haunted him. It was a dream about ahouse, his house. Yet when he looked around this house he found it had a extra levelhe could not recognise. It contained rooms he did not know which lead to other roomshe did not know. Concealed levels lead to new wings, new storeys and further rooms.Until, at last, he came across a beautiful old library full of what seemed to be preciousbooks. On examination he could not understand the symbols written on their spines,nor interpret what the language they were written in. Jung’s dream is a superb analogyof the nature of the human psyche. While we tend to think of the psyche as simplyhaving conscious and unconscious (sometimes called sub-conscious) levels, there isactual far more than is first perceived. Since society exists on a hierarchical level (anddevelops in a similar fashion, see our later study on Jacob’s Ladder), then as we delvedeeper into the mind we find hierarchies of memory. (fig 14 ) While on the surfacethere exist individual memories. As we go deeper timelines merge and a Collective"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 61Unconscious results. Insome sense the first floors ofthe house might be our own,but the courtyard and librarybelong to all. As we exam-ine the hierarchy we findstrata on strata of uncon-scious material - familial,national, racial, cultural, hu-man and perhaps even be-yond. Each strata includesmaterial relevant to that spe-cific focus. Within thesememory conglomerates areimages which have been in-vested with certain valueand certain symbolic power.These are known asArchetypes.ArchetypesArchetypesAccording to Jung the contents of the personal unconscious is feeling toned complexes,memories based on the per-sonal and private side of psy-chic life. While the contents ofthe Collective Unconscious isbased on signs and symbols, inthe main it is composed ofArchetypes. Archetypes are“representation collectives”,they are conglomerates of cul-ture and belief which exist inthe unconscious and operate asa language of development.There is a whole world withinthe collective unconscious, aworld which like our own, is amixture of light and darkness,wisdom and error, sufferingand ecstasy. The archetypesare a language which symbol-ise the whole psychologicaland spiritual state of humanity,they also hold wisdom whichis from the highest worlds. Some examples of major archetypes include the Mother,Rebirth, Spirit and the Trickster. The importance of archetypes is that they are part ofRational MindPersonal UnconsciousCollective UnconsciousDeeper and deeper levels ofDeeper and deeper levels ofCollective UnconsciousCollective UnconsciousFig 14"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 62a symbolic language which can be used in spiritual practises to explore and rectify theunconscious. They also provide the reasoning behind our use of correspondences. Anobvious question that arises is what is the value of all these correlations ? What doesit matter that certain planes connect to certain bodily states and to certain postures orsounds ? The relevance is that if all these things are somehow connected, if they somehow vibrate at a certain tone. Then perhaps through the use of related symbols andarchetypes each can be transformed, even transmutated. If Archetypes are thecollective symbol language of the whole of humanity then through their intelligent usethe unconscious can be rectified.EngramsEngramsSince the unconscious is a living world composed of many locales and environments,then we can suppose that there are negative as well as positive forces. Just as there aspersonal memories and Archetypes, there are more dangerous memories and collec-tive forces. These are known as Engrams, Eggregores and Memes. The term Engramoriginally comes from neurology though Dianetics has, in more recent years, given itmuch unwanted press. It literally means memory trace, but is used in a more specificmanner. When an individual experiences great pain, suffering or distress, memories ofthe event are not recorded in a normal fashion, they become locked with theassociated emotions and are stored as Engrams. These Engrams are aberrative innature and irrational in content, they record all related facets of the experience (sound,colour, touch, smell and so on) and lock them together. As more and more Engramsare formed they link together to form chains and begin to cloud the conscious orrational mind. This is why Gurdjieff said that we all live in the past, in any oneindividual there are thousands of personal Engrams clouding and overpowering therational mind. When we consider how the mind is the gateway through which othersystems of the psychic and physical organism receive their sustenance, we can readilysee how Engrams reek havoc in the average person’s life. Here we are not talkingabout neurotics or psychotics, we are talking about average everyday people. Every-one is aberrated, everyone lives in the past, everyone is conditioned by Engrams.Hence, a major task for the Gnostic is the processing of the unconscious, and theremoval of Engrams and their refiling as normal memories."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 63The problem is that Engrams do not just exist in the personal unconscious. Familiescan have Engrams, so can states, countries and races. Accordingly, the collectiveunconscious is a wild place to explore. Freud believed the unconscious was an evilworld, a “Pandora’s Box” of destruction and terror, Jung saw it in far more rosyterms, the truth lies somewhere inbetween. Two of the major Engramic forms thatexist within the collective unconscious are Eggregores and Memes.EggregoresEggregoresAn Eggregore is a collective group mind, it is a form that has been created by thethoughts of a group of people with similar beliefs over a period of time. As timepasses, the energy of that belief takes on a certain “life of its own” and becomeswhat is known as an “Eggregore”. Eggregores are, by rights, not necessarilyEngramic. There are also positive Eggregores of organisations, groups and associa-tions. However, since man is by nature a fallen creature, Eggregores tend to end upout of control and become unwieldy, forming little vortexes of energy in thecollective unconscious and by correspondence, on the astral worlds. Some of themore unusual Eggregores are those which are religious in nature. Many Gods areartificial and created out of fear and insecurity, such gods and deities are real in apsychological sense, but since they lack connection to the light world, they tend towork in destructive and neurotic ways. The degeneration of God-images in Judaismand Christianity can be clearly seen with the replacement of real spiritual forms withpsychologically projected (neurotic) forms, or Eggregores. The difference betweenthese is important and can be readily illustrated.Take for example, a historical figure. After his death we have the facts about thehistorical figure and perceptions of that figure. After a period of time we may evenhave conflicting perceptions of this figure, and hence, have X number of differingperceptions. This process may continue, and schools may develop around theseperceptions, with people pouring emotions and feelings into \"their perception\" of thisfigure. The end result is a series of Eggregores in the lower astral regions and in thecollective unconscious that have little or no connection with the original historicalfigure. These forms are then fed and utilised by the fallen energies that populate thelower plane to their own ends. From one historical figure we have ended up with.."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 641.The Historical figure. (The Thing in Itself).2.Different perceptions of that figure.3. Eggregores or artificial energy forces created of that figure.For example, we may have a Catholic Jesus, a Philosophers Jesus, a Protestant Jesusand even a New Age Jesus. (fig 15) It must be understood that there is an immensedifference between the forms of the mind and those of the universe itself, betweenArchetypes and Gods and between Archetypes and Eggregores. In some cases therecan even be two or more distinct forms of one deity. For example, we have the Jesusof history and the neurotic, twisted forms created by the various Churches anddenominations of Christendom. All exist and are, in some sense, real. One is ofimmense Light power, and the others of great Archonic power. One leads from theLower Worlds into the Static Kingdom, the others perpetuate the Dialectic Cycle.When such images become confused, personal mental components can be fixed ontoexternal deities and thereby become highly destructive. When we start to considerthe nature of the Eggregores we can easily see how the Archons can twist suchimages to their own benefit. Eggregores serve the fallen kingdoms well, they collectenergy from human belief and channel it into degenerative forms. Do not get the ideaFig 15Many different Jesus’Many different Jesus’"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 65that Eggregores are only passive, in conjunction with their comrades, the Memes, theyspread like wildfire through towns and cities controlling thought and influencingemotions. Just as disease can spread from one to the another, so too can Eggregores.Since at some level all of humanity is linked, once false idea can destroy a kingdom.MemesMemesMemes are a recent discovery, but prove an excellent way to understand howEggregores take control of human minds. Memes and Eggregores are similar, but notquite the same thing. In the more radical schools of modern biology the theory has beenput forth that Genes use humanity for their own purpose. Now this may seem strangeuntil you think it over and consider the implications. The genetic structure of mankindis made up of certain programs, these programs have no ethical or moral precedent orlimits, they simply work until their program is completed. Since their program, at leastaccording to Darwinian evolution, is to create more and more physically refined formsof life, then the genes will manipulate mankind more and more as the complexity of theprogram increases. Intelligence will only be of value insomuch as it functions to servea physical end, and the primary focus will be on physical perfection. This is very muchwhat we see happening throughout the chequered history of human relations, all of theclashes between men and women can be reduced to one simple equation - the geneticmanipulation of conflict. Men fight for women and territory, women tend to search forthe ultimate specimen (why do feminists still look for rough working class men andreject the new age wimps their philosophy engenders ?). This certainly is a simplifica-tion but the genetic basis of the conflict has been readily demonstrated in the works ofsuch scientists as Robert Ardrey, Desmond Morris and other socio-biologists. TheLucifer Principle by Howard Bloom (Allen and Unwin, 1995) is an excellent summaryof the field having been written from a nonprofessionals' perspective. Men and womenare both manipulated by the genes desire to reproduce, it is the genes that control andmanipulate, not the individual, our psyche simply creates complex Engrams to justifythe decisions made by our cells. If we correlate the genetic program with the fallennature of matter, we can start to see that the program of humanity is the very antithesisof spirit. As the gene program plays out, more and more of our spiritual essence is lost,exponentially. In some sense we could even go as far as to say that the very buildingblocks of matter are the building blocks of the Demiurge’s kingdom."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 66Genes sit at the centre of each cellular blob, dictating theconstruction of a multi-billion celled body like yours or mine.As genes are to the organism, so Memes are to the superor-ganism, pulling together millions of individuals into a collec-tive creature of awesome size. Memes stretch their tendrilsthrough the fabric of each human brain, driving us to coagu-late into the cooperative masses of family, tribe and nation.And memes - working together in theories, worldviews orcultures - can make a superorganism very hungry.The Lucifer Principle.Howard Bloom,Allen and Unwin 1995.Memes are the collective unconscious equivalent to genes. As man has becomephysically more complex, the Archons needed a strategy to control and manipulatethought. This strategy began in the lower reaches of the collective unconscious. AsEggregores began to take hold of an increasing amount of human thought, theArchons worked to create Eggregores of special power, special destructive value.These specialised mind-traps we can call Memes. They reproduce through humanconsciousness at lightning speed and move from mind to mind, they masquerade astheories, concepts and philosophical systems that bring people together intomindless conglomerates. These conglomerates, group minds or Eggregores arethen easily manipulated. We only need to take a brief trip through history to seehow this has occurred. As we move towards the end of the cycle, Memes areplaying an accelerating role and are bringing together more and more of humanityinto one mindless, physical, Demiurgic superorganism - the New World Order.The Limits of the MindThe Limits of the MindWhen working with models of the mind, we need to appreciate the innate limits toour model. As discussed earlier in this course everything cannot be reduced topsychological equations. In various traditions of Magic, for example, psychologyis a pre-requisite for occult training, indeed Israel Regardie of Golden Dawn famesuggesting eight or nine years of psychoanalysis before any practical occult"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 67instruction should begin. While we may not go that far, it is imperative that theGnostic understand the nature of the mind as well as that of the spirit. In some sensethere are two very distinct forms of occult practice, psychological techniques andspiritual techniques. By their very nature these two systems work on very differentlevels. A prime example of this is the timeline we discussed earlier in the course.While the timelime is certainly central to forms of Gnostic psychology(Psychogenesis) at the same time it has its limits. For example, if the timeline onlyexists as a “time” line then events that occurred before the advent of time, space andmatter cannot be found on it. Accordingly, even if we use the most developed past liferetrieval techniques there is a limit beyond which the mind cannot go. In terms of theseven bodies of man there are two memory systems, the unconscious (at the Astrallevel) and the Mediator Self. This means that while certain problems can be resolvedat the psychological level (the unconscious), some cannot. According the Gnosticmust always be aware of the limits of the mind. A good way to conceptualise theselimits is in what is known as the three A’s.The three A’sThe three A’sThe three A’s are Animal, Adept and Angel. Each represents an image of a certainlevel of human consciousness. The Animal is the body, the Adept the mind and theAngel, the developing higher self. Each can only exist correctly at the level to whichhe is assigned. The Animal and Adept make good servants but very bad masters. TheAnimal is the body which we have as an interface to the physical world, if it isallowed to go its own merry way then it will become our master. It is a difficult beastto control and is manipulated by desires, lusts and, of course, genes. The Adept is themind, it too, is a servant not a master. There are lots of highly intelligent people whohave no sense of the spiritual life whatsoever. The mind is a scribe, a record keeper,even a grand machine, it is not the True Self. The mind is a difficult thing to control,and yet it must be forced to submit. The mind will rebel, demand rights, give usstrange thoughts, dreams and nightmares, yet ultimately it has no real power. It is aglorified computer, a good model, certainly, but a computer no less. (Fig 16)The Angel is the true Self, the spark of Light. It exists only in potential and must bebrought into action through Transfiguration. When the Angel becomes the centre of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 68one's existence the Animal and Adept (and other related systems) fall into place.However, since we are in a fallen system, there will always be a battle until matter isfinally rectified. Even if the Animal and Adpe are forced into obedience, since matterby its very nature is Demiurgic, the war will continue until the Omega Day.The idea of calling the higher self an Angel or even better, the Holy Guardian Angel(HGA) is to destroy intellectual models and concepts. The term HGA sounds soutterly ridiculous, so beyond the intellect, that it serves its purpose. It emphasiseshow alien our true self is to worldly definition. In the Gnostic Tradition there arethree phases of coming into an experience of the True Self, they are the ExternalAngel, Knowledge and Conversation of the HGA and Union with the HGA. Eachstage has its own characteristics and dangers. (fig 17)The Holy Guardian AngelThe Holy Guardian AngelThe First Stage:The External AngelThe First Stage:The External AngelThe first stage in the spiritual life is to experience the HGA as a separate entity.As a novice in the Gnostic tradition we experience the battles with the Animal andAdept, and sense the HGA as a far away goal. In many traditions (such as BhaktiYoga) the HGA is seen as a focus of devotion and veneration. It is even sometimesvisualized as a deity or personal spirit. This stage of the spiritual path is where weMindBodyEmotionLife out of BalanceWorketcLife centred on the True SelfFig 16"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 69work to subjugate the mind and body and awaken the HGA. This stage is probablyone of the most misunderstood aspects of the mystical tradition. Christians talk aboutgiving their life to Jesus, making Christ the centre of their existence and yet do nothave any idea of what this really means. The Christian concept of conversion is acorruption of the mystical transformation that happens when we enter the path ofTransfiguration. The Christ who is the HGA and the Son of God, the Light thatbecomes the centre of our lives is our own True Self. Conversion is the process ofputting the Animal and Adept in their places, destroying links with the DemiurgicKingdom and invoking the true Self. This is the first stage.The Second Stage:The Second Stage:Knowledge and ConversationKnowledge and ConversationThe Second stage is where the Gnostic begins to make contact with his HGA.This is a dangerous period. So many times Gnostics and would be Gnostics confuseMetamorphs (false personalities) with the true Self. Even worse, they confuseFig 17Phase One:External AngelPhase two:Knowledge and Conver-Phase Three:Union: The New ManAdeptHGAHGAAdeptHomoNovus"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 70communication from their own inner self with communication with the Source of all,and become prophets of their own little faiths. It is important that this stage behandled with care, we must not confuse the personal HGA with the Father ofWisdom nor with false personalities. As the Adept confronts the HGA he istransformed, the mind is flooded with light and becomes a new mind. While theAnimal cannot be so transformed, if it was we would surely die since matter cannotfully contain the force of spirit, the Adept, at least, will become a more suitablescribe. As the mind is transmutated and communicates with the HGA the stage is setfor a further transformation. This second stage is known as the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.The Third Stage:The Third Stage:Union, The New ManUnion, The New ManUnion with the HGA is the most dangerous of operations, unless the mind has beenproperly prepared the energy that it invokes will destroy it. Since the light corecomes from the Static Kingdom it cannot fully exist in the lower world, and henceUnion with the HGA can never be fully experienced in a mortal body. The Gnosticsunderstood this, and this is why they went to such pains to explain the real nature ofthe physical form of Jesus. For the Gnostics, the body of Jesus was only partiallyphysical. After his Baptism (initiation) his physical body was transformed andbecame a phantom or shadow. For most of us this sort of transformation is unlikely,and hence, as we communicate further with the HGA a close relationship is formed.However, union with the HGA is normally reserved for the evolutionary cycles afterwe return to the Treasury of Light. There are many dangers at this stage, I cannot listthe number of Gnostics who have tried to artificially bring about union with the HGAand become convinced they are the Lord of Wisdom himself or at least some vastentity. Self delusion is the price they paid and one of the biggest risks on the spiritualpath. There are many risks on the path of Transfiguration, be aware of them ! Theprocess of awakening the Light Self is central to Gnostic practice, but also thwartwith danger. We are living at the end of the age, in the fallen kingdoms - expecttrouble.

However, as the Self awakens, the Gnostic will then truly know his homeand begin to experience genuine spiritual growth and development.The Law of CorrespondenceThe Law of CorrespondenceBy now you should have a sound working knowledge of the foundation stones ofGnostic psychology. The next thing we should provide is a series of correlationcharts. This way you can link what we have discussed about the mind with materialson the seven planes, worlds and later the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. At first all thesecorrelations may seem a bit contrived, but they are for a reason. The Law ofCorrespondence is one of the major philosophical premises of the Gnostic system, itis based on the dictum of Hermes “as above, so below”. Even though the AlphaEvent caused a rift between the worlds, the basic framework of the universe is stillthe same. While matter is certainly fallen, it has fallen on the same patterns orvibrations as all of the forces within the total system. Nothing is totally outside,accordingly, all things are somehow connected, even if only in design or prototype.If we can work out the vibration rates or correlations between varying systems(bodies, planes, worlds, Chakras, colours, sounds etc.) then we can use thisknowledge to bring about influence and change. If we find that, for example, acertain plane, body, state of consciousness, colour, sound, taste and so on arerelated, then it isn’t a far step to using some sort of spiritual practice to influence orchange one or all of the correlations. This is very much the foundation of the ritualtechnology used within the Gnostic system. Some basic correlations are fouund infigures 18 and 19.X"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 73The aim of Transfiguration is the total transformation of the individual. It is notenough to refine or purify the earthly elements (the Dialectic), the earthly must betotally replacedwith elements ofLight. As discussedin our last study thechaotic mind mustbe rectified andtrained to becomethe Scribe or Adept,as the mind changesother transforma-tions will begin inreaction. One of themost important isthe development ofthe Light Body.While the physicalorganism itself can-not be transformedthe essence whichcontrols and moti-vates it (the electro-magnetic field), hasa special role in theTransfigurationprocess. For theGnostic to exploreand learn within thespiritual worlds hemust have a spiri-tual body or vehi-cle. Hence a majortask within the pro-cess of Transfigura-tion is to formulatea body of light fromthe electro-magnetic field. This light body exists in potential within the etheric and astral fields,but only through the trained use of the imagination can it be manifest;this light bodyis known as the Antakarana.The AntakaranaThe AntakaranaThe Sanskrit word Antakarana has no equivalent in English, the closest definition wecan come to is the process of building a psychic antenna. It literally comes from twowords “Antar” meaning inner and “Karana” meaning action. The Antakarana isliterally the body formed by spiritual action. It is the stage where the instincts andelectro-magnetic forces are forged into a spiritual vehicle capable of entering the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 74Treasury of Light. This light vehicle can then be used by the Gnostic to explore thehigher worlds where lower vibrations, such as those of the untransfigured astral oretheric bodies, cannot enter. This is an important consideration for when theuntransfigured man tries to explore the higher worlds he can only go as far as hisuntransformed astral body is capable of taking him. Accordingly, he ends in thelower astral kingdoms, where he will confuse the astral light of the Archons with thereal light of the higher worlds. The process of forming the Antakarana is through theuse of the imagination and is intricately connected to the Seven Chakras or as theGnostics understood them, the Seven Churches. To appreciate this we need tounderstand that the brain/mind complex and the electro-magnetic fields are notisolated in their respective systems. It is too easy to consider the brain/mind as onlyoperating within the physical organ of the brain, but consciousness is more complexthan that. Consciousness exists on seven different levels and manifests in both thebrain (in its seven components sometimes known as the seven brain-circuits or“brains”) and in the seven consciousness centres of the organism. It is the same withthe Antakarana, it is formed through the transformation of the seven psychic centresof the astral-etheric field. These centres are of great importance as they form aninterface between the undeveloped man and the Transfigured man. Through the useof imagination, meditation, ritual and related techniques the energies in these centrescan be refined and the Antakarana and Adept/Scribe created. As further refinementtakes place more energy from the Solar Logos can be received into the psychic/mental structures, while at the same time limiting the receipt of fallen forces This isself perpetuating, as more light is received, the Chakras are further developed andmore light is received again. The Seven Churches or Chakras hence form a centralaspect of the spiritual practice of Transfiguration.TTHE HE MMYSTERY OF THE YSTERY OF THE SSEVEN EVEN CCHURCHESHURCHESThese seven are the eyes of the Lord, which range throughoutthe earth.Zechariah 4:10The Seven Churches of the Revelation of Jesus Christ to St. John have manymeanings.

The seven churches of Revelationeach can be related to the seven psychic centres or Chakras with the teachings givento each Church (warnings, blessings etc.) relating to the consciousness and activityat that level. To begin with, we should examine a basic tabulation of the structure andan explanation of the centres.These attributions illustrate how each Church can be understood as a centre ofenergy within the psychic organism. In his pioneering work, The Theories of theChakras (Quest Books, 1981), Dr. Motoyama is able to show the energy of thesecentres links with the Nadis or force lines of traditional acupuncture. Throughout themental, astral, etheric andphysical organism there arenetworks for the transmis-sion of energy. Nerves,synapses, meridians andMarmas all transmit variousdegrees of Prana to andfrom various systems. Withineach system there are majorreceiving and distributionpoints, these are the sevenChakras. These seven cen-tres are interface stationswhereby energy from the So-lar sphere can be receivedand where, via spiritual prac-tise, the energies of the mindand astral-etheric organismcan be transformed. TheSeven Chakras are locatedwithin the astral and ethericbodies (with links to the vari-ous related levels of con-sciousness) and are seen as asequence of energy receptors an distributors, the term Chakra literally means “Wheelof Energy”. The size of the Chakra tends to be from two to six inches varyingaccording to the degree of spiritual development. Each of these centres is related toa state of consciousness and a colour. The states of consciousness can also bediscovered by a esoteric reading of the seven days of creation in GenesisThe Four Attributes of the ChurchesThe Four Attributes of the ChurchesThe four attributes of each Church help us to appreciate the unique nature of each ofthe energy centres. These centres are central to the process of transforming theelectromagnetic field of the Gnostic from the Dialectic to the Static. The Kundalinior Serpent power based in the lowest centre is energised in such a way that theserpent seed (the Taint of the Archons) is replaced by the Serpent of Wisdom (the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 77Messiah). It is interesting to find that this transition is reflected in the Old Testamenttale of Moses holding up the cross interwined with the serpent to heal the people ofIsrael. The serpent mentioned is numerically equilvant to three hundred and fiftyeight, which is also the number of the Messiah or Christos - the Self awakenedSaviour, the True Self of every awakened being.The four attributes of each Church as given in the Book of Revelation are:1.Characteristics of the Church and City.2.Commendation of the Church.3.Counsel and Warning.4.Promises to Overcomers.The Church of EphesusThe Church of EphesusThe Church of Ephesus is the Base Chakra. It is known as “Desirable” and is that ofthe primal instincts. It is desired by and desires the Sahasrara (Laodicea) Centre. Theunion of these centres locks the organism into the Static currents of the Treasury ofLight.The Characteristic of the City is that of change, the change from earthly to GnosticWorship. This represents the transmutation of purely \"nature\" oriented vibrationsinto forces that serve the spiritual goal. This technology includes the correct use ofpassion and desire with the process of Transfiguration. The key here is that all drivesand goals must be directed towards the Treasury of Light.The Commendation of the Church is given for its patience and labour and it isespecially commended because it has not fainted. These images refer to the immenseeffort and perseverance required to keep control over the energies of the base centre.The ideal situation would be total awareness or in more Biblical terms “not fainting”.The Counsel and Warning is that the Church has left its true love. This clearly refersto the need for the base centre to be totally directed to the Treasury of Light.Whether it is swayed by family, lust, desire or even love, any movement away from"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 78the goal is \"sin\". (The word sin literally means \"to miss the mark\".)The Promise offered to those who correctly use the base Chakra is the ability to \"eatfrom the Tree of Life\". This has many different shades of meaning, ranging from thepromise of immortality to the liberation of the Self through the activation of the Treeof Life.The Church of SmyrnaThe Church of SmyrnaThe Church of Smyrna is the Svadhisthana Chakra in the Hindu system or in ourterms the Sacral Centre. It is known as “Sweet Smelling” and is related to the sexualorgans. The sweet smell refers to the Ojas or psychic force that dwells within theenergy that flows through the organism of both the male and female. It also has aspecific sexual meaning in terms of Tantric practise where it represents the psychicenergy found within the sexual secretions themselves, the smell relating to theripening of the energy at certain times of the year. This correlation of sexualsecretions, time and energy represents one of the inner teachings of Gnosticism aswell as Buddhist and Hindu Tantra.The Characteristics of the city include life, earthquakes, plagues, fires and mas-sacres. These refer to the intense dangers associated with the energies of this centre.It is the centre of sexual fire, and when the base centre is activated and force ismanifested at this level it must be totally controlled so that the energies continue onupwards towards redemption. Loss of control can mean destruction or obsession, arelevant maxim here is that \"all acts of sex are acts of power\". Related to thischaracteristic is the Mystery of the Terrestrial and Celestial Paths, while both pathshave much in common they activate the energy centres in different ways using verydifferent technologies. The very things that are forbidden to those of the TerrestrialPath are used by those of the Celestial to achieve liberation.The Commendation given to the Church is for standing strong in the time oftribulation and persecution. This refers again to the great discipline need to controlthis energy centre. While the base centre refers to all manner of desires, this centre isclearly sexual in nature and demands initiated control.The Counsel and Warning is against hypocrites and blasphemers. These descriptions"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 79refer to those who use esoteric techniques to propagate the World of the Archons, tosatisfy an addiction to pleasure or power. It also refers to the innate error ofreproduction and the propogation of children. It also can be applied to the supposedChristian Churches who have no knowledge of the inner teachings and offer pithymorality and prejudice in the place of wisdom.The Promise is the gift of the crown of Life. That is returning to the Treasury ofLight, reaching the Crown at the pinnacle of the Tree of Life, the top of the headChakra (Kether).The Church of PergamosThe Church of PergamosThe Church of Pergamos is the Solar Plexus Chakra. It is known as “elevation orheight”, for it governs the balance of the organism through its central position. It isalso elevated in that it dominates and controls the lower Chakras.The Characteristic of the city is that of being the capital city where the SupremeCourt and priests of Babylon sat in Judgement. It can hence be understood that thePergamos is the seat of control and discrimination (right thinking). However, there isclearly a great danger, for the priests of Babylon are fallen. Accordingly, it isimperative that our self-control comes from the True Self, not just from sub-personalities or the mind. The mind is a great servant, but a dangerous master.The Commendation of the Church is given because it holds fast to what it has beentaught, has not denied the faith and has accepted the fact there are and will be manymartyrs due to the stand they have taken. This relates to the achievement of balancethrough the Solar Plexus, which demands separation from the world and holdingsecurely to the Static currents, even though there is persecution from the fallenkingdoms.The Counsel and Warning is the message that the Church holds many conflictingdoctrines and must repent. (Repentance means to turn around, to go in the otherdirection.) This can be understood on two levels, firstly, one cannot serve twomasters. Beliefs must be either Static or Dialectic, unless you are totally separatedfrom the world and centred on the Treasury of Light you are under Dialecticdominion (whether you admit it or not). Secondly, within the psyche will be many"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 80Dialectic programs that we carry with us into the spiritual life, they must be rootedout and destroyed.The Promise offered to those who correctly use this Chakra include the eating of theHidden Manna and the Gift of the White Stone with a new name engraved on it.These promises are highly symbolic, the Hidden Manna represents a special stageknown in the Alchemical process of self transformation. It is also sometimes knownas the White Powder, it is a stage prior to the Philosophers Stone. This substance issymbolic of the processes of internal transformation that are working throughTransfiguration.The Church of ThyatiraThe Church of ThyatiraThe Church of Thyatira is the heart or Anahata Chakra. It is known as \"sacrifice orcontrition\" as it involves the sacrifice of the fallen facets of the organism and thethings of the world to the Higher Self (Yechidah).The Characteristic of the city is that it is a manufacturing town with a altar dedicatedto Apollo. These two characteristics are very important; the first represents thepower of the heart centre, when properly activated it manufactures static forces thattransform the organism. The second characteristic represents the importance of theMystery teachings. Through modern scholarship it has been discovered that many ofthe Greek Mysteries completed and fulfilled the ancient Hebrew Mystery teachings,and accordingly Apollo represents the need to complete our understanding of thenature of all things.The Commendation of the church is fourfold...Charity, Service, Faith and Patience.Each of these attributes should be central to the Gnostic Life.The Counsel and Warning is against false teachers, fornication and meat offered toidols. These warnings can be understood in two distinct ways. Firstly, they are awarning against contact with the World of the Archons. False teachers, Fornication(not sex per se but reproduction) and meat offered to idols (Fallen Gods), all imagesreflecting facets of the fallen system. In a more esoteric understanding, these imagescan be related to fallen facets of ourselves. The false teachers are personas within the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 81Psyche that would draw the Gnostic back into the World of the Archons. Fornicationis the desire for union with things of the world and food offered to idols representsthe false Gods or idols we may have within ourselves. How many Gnostics are stillbeguiled by internal demands for fame, money, achievement, material gain, andfamily.The Promise offered to those who use this centre correctly is the Gift of the MorningStar. The Morning Star is Venus or Lucifer and represents the state of \"lightbearing.\" This is an allegorical way to represent the awakening of the Light or Staticfields within the Gnostic.The Church of SardisThe Church of SardisThe church of Sardis is the throat or Visuddha Chakra. It is given the title of \"Thatwhich remains \"as it is the portal before entering the higher Chakras. It has a similarmeaning in the Kabbalistic systems.The Characteristic of the City is Death. It is the centre of warning and echoes eitherpower or destruction. A further characteristic of this city is that it is a city whoseglory has passed away, this emphasises the role of this centre concerning thetransformation of the Mind. The voice or Logos is also indicated by the throat andhence the old mind (Ruach) must pass away and the new mind must be formedthrough the power of the Logos.The Commendation to the Church is that there are a few who have not defiled theMysteries. This is a clear message that only a small number can really use this centrecorrectly and transmute the psyche and achieve communion with the Logos.The Counsel and Warning is hold fast and watch. It is clear and precise, to achievetransfiguration takes steadfastness and awareness.The Promise is that those who correctly use this centre will be confessed before the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 82Father. That is, they will join the Pleroma. It also has a Kabbalistic meaning,confession before the father means crossing the abyss and being reborn as a masterin the Supernals (the top three centres of the Tree of Life). This is to be confessed orwitnessed by the Father, Kether.The Church of PhiladelphiaThe Church of PhiladelphiaThe church of Philadelphia is the third eye or Ajna (Brow) Chakra. It is given thetitle of “Brotherly Love” because of its awesome power. The insight and force of thiscentre can only be understood when experienced through Agape of Divine Love,only by a pure desire to return to the Treasury of Light can this force be correctlyawakened and experienced.The Characteristic of the city is its ability to grow and spread. This is symbolic ofthe great power of this centre, and its ability to transfigure the whole organism at itsawakening.The Commendation of the Church is for its keeping of the Word. The word here isthe Logos, the power manifested in the throat centre, but originating in the Ajna.Only by communion with the Logos can the Ajna be awakened.The Counsel and Warning is that there will be a temptation to make others worshipat your feet. No semblance of fallen self can be allowed to remain when awakeningthis force, any dialectic field will cause destruction.The Promise offered to those who overcome this centre is that they be made a Pillarin the Temple of God. That is, they will have their whole Chakra system activatedand transformed, and will thereby become Static in nature and achieve immortality.The Church of LaodiceaThe Church of LaodiceaThe church of Laodicea is the Sahasrara or Crown Centre. It is located above the topof the head and is known as “Judging the People”. Its name suggests the immenseand awesome power of this centre, it is that of divinity, Godhood and deification.Through this enlightened state the whole universe and world is seen for what it reallyis - and judged accordingly."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 83The characteristic of the city is a final warning, arrogance, compromise anddestruction will be the \"reward\" of those who do not awaken to this state correctly.The characteristic of those who have grown correctly is Godhood.The Commendation has also been removed from the description. There is no secondchance here, either perfection or destruction.The Counsel and Warning is similar, be zealous and not lukewarm.So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, Iwill spew thee out of my mouth.Revelation 3:16The Promise is that those who correctly open this Chakra and unite all the centres asone will achieve Liberation from the fallen worlds.The Creation of the Diamond BodyThe Creation of the Diamond BodyIf we again consider consciousness in terms of our Refraction Model, we mayconceive that if it is refracted through the lens of the brain/mind complex, then aspectrum of seven states of being will result. In some sense this is what occurs withinthe human personality. This spectrum, however, since it is in the Dialectic world andthe energy received is mixed, is of an unstable nature and the consciousness thatresults is fallen and has a tendency towards deterioration. Only by awakening theTrue Self can the mind reform the psychic structure of the organism, so the resultingstates of Cosmic consciousness can be aligned with the Static Kingdom. Thistransformation involves both the creation of the Antakarana and the reformation ofthe Psyche. In the East this process is known as the creation of the Diamond Bodyand is best illustrated in the Tantric forms of Buddhism where there is a secrettradition known as Vajrayana or the Diamond Vehicle. In this esoteric practise,esoteric methods are used to return the astral-etheric body from its fallen to highernature and to combine this redeemed light body with the trained Psyche. When thisis done correctly, they merge together to form a Diamond body, an unbreakablejewel, a light that cannot be extinguished.

This tradition isalso found reflected in the secret Chariot or Merkeva mysticism of the Kabbalistictradition.Seven Days of Re-CreationSeven Days of Re-CreationAnother tradition which expresses this process of re-creation is found hidden withinthe creation tale of Genesis. Emanuel Swedenborg, the Great Swedish mystic, taughtthat hidden with the seven days of creation was a description of our regeneration.Though he did not relate these to the Chakras, if we link them together we can gaina picture of the spiritual regeneration that takes place in the Gnostic life. The keyhowever is to realise that since man is being re-created through the seven days ofcreation, the actions described are being examined from the perspective of theTransfiguration, not the fall of man.The Seven Days of CreationThe Seven Days of CreationBasic Church Correlations of Colour, Consciousness and Creative PrinciplesChurch.Colour.Consciousness.Day of Creation.Ephesus.Red.Action, Sensation.Coming of Light.Smyrna.Orange.Social Consciousness.Waters Above, Below.PergamusYellow.Intellect.Grass, Herbs & Trees.Thyatira.Green.Security and Devotion.Sun, Moon & Stars.Sardis.Blue.Idealism.Fish and Birds.Philadelphia.Indigo.Intuition.Animals,Pre-Adamites and Man.Laodicea.Violet.Imagination.Day of Rest.Fig 22"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 85The First Day of RegenerationThe First Day of RegenerationThe recreation of New Man is the coming of light.

The term Kabbalah comes from the Hebrew word qabal andmeans both “to reveal” and “to receive”, it represents the secret oral teachings ofthe Israelites. Here then is the first hurdle in our discussion, who were the Israelites? According to the Gnostic tradition the Kabbalah was the inner teachings of theIndo-Europeans or Aryans and the Aryans were the original Israelites. The termAryan is not used in the racial sense but as a term of description for a large group ofIndo-European peoples, it comes from the term Arya which means “noble, worthyor holy”. One of the major branches of this teaching was found amongst the peoplesof Sumer and Egypt, and as Egypt deteriorated; amongst the people of Israel. TheIsraelite people were Aryans, the very term Adam means “he who blushes red”.They carried the Kabbalah with them into the deserts and it formed the secret coreof their faith. As time progressed and Israel became a political force in its own right,the esoteric teachings were passed by secret brotherhoods such as the Qadesh. Thislineage of the esoteric wisdom is sometimes known as the “Sethian tradition”, boththe Essenes and Gnostics emphasised this unique designation. It was used in thesense of the genealogy of Genesis, where Seth was the replacement for murderedAbel and he represented the pure wisdom. Cain, on other hand, represented a fallenlineage, he was considered a tool of the Demiurge - an Archon in flesh. This conflictis important because it forms the very foundation of our understanding of the originsof the Kabbalah. In ancient Israel we have the Sethian form of Kabbalah, theAriosophic Mysteries (Ario meaning Aryan and Sophic meaning wisdom), while atthe same time, among the outskirts of the kingdoms of Israel were those whofollowed the Cainite traditions, the distorted teachings which belonged to the lowerworld. After Israel was taken into captivity, first by the Assyrians, and then by theBabylonians they became scattered. It was during this Diaspora the myth of the lostten tribes began. According to the recent research, as the ten tribes travelled, theychanged their names and identities and slowly took on new traditions, manycompleted their migration in Ireland, England and other European countries. Hence"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 89the Ariosophic Mysteries travelled all over the globe to the lands we now see asIndo-European. There were earlier migrations too. The Israelites travelled tosouthern Spain and the Phoenicians settled in the Punjab region of India, but onlythe later migrations concern us here. The Ariosophic Kabbalah is embodied in muchof the later Hermetic and Alchemical traditions and it represents the heritage ofAryan Israel.However, all is not at it seems, during this same period, a false tradition, acounterfeit Kabbalah was being developed. In Babylon the children of Cain createdan amalgam of Babylonian Paganism and Israelite belief which later became knownas the Talmud. As time progressed they stepped into the shoes of the now-believedlost Ten tribes and falsely identified themselves as Jews (of Judea) or as Israel.They edited the Torah to reflect their distorted view of Judaism, and created aapostate faith based on the values of the Talmud. As the deception continued manyof these Babylonian Cainites migrated to other regions, they became known as theEdomites and later on many of their number integrated with the people known as theKhazars. The Khazars were of Turkish stock and converted to the Talmudic form ofJudaism around 900 C.E. this conversion is of great significance. In his book, TheThirteenth Tribe, Arthur Koestler argues that modern Jewry is descended not fromthe people of Israel, but from the Khazars. Accordingly, it is said, they have more incommon with the Turkish people than with the original people of Israel. (By theway, Koestler is not some rabid anti-Semite, he is Jewish !).The relevance of this is not to illustrate some wild historical polemic, but to showthe difference between Sethian and Cainite Kabbalah. This is not simply a racial orcultural debate, but a discussion on the origins of Judaism, Christianity andKabbalah. Just as the Gnostics rejected Christianity as a distortion of the true faith,they totally rejected Talmudic Judaism as a Demiurgic creation. Further to this, weknow that the Essenes were a small group of the lost ten tribes who returned toIsrael after the captivity and that they saw the Pharisees and Saduccees as being ofa dissimilar culture, race and spiritual heritage. The Essenes and Gnostics agreedwith Jesus in his evaluation of those who professed to be the Jews of that periodYe are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father yewill do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 90in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketha lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father ofJohn 8:44,45.As time has progressed the Talmudic form of Judaism has become accepted. Wehave come to call the people who were Khazars - Jews and even have come toaccept their appropriation of the name Israel. The truth of the matter is that theKabbalah is Aryan in origin, it is an Ariosophic tradition and is part of theIndo-European worldview. It is not and never has been “Jewish” in the modernmisuse of the term.Restoring the KabbalahRestoring the KabbalahIt is not easy to restore the Ariosophic Kabbalah. The Gnostics were attacked fromboth sides by the Jews and the Christians, their works were burnt and their livestaken. Luckily for us many Jewish and Christian groups purloined Kabbalistictraditions in an attempt to make them their own. While these traditions have beentwisted and distorted, at least they survive. These teachings are of great value, theycan be seen hidden behind the parables of Jesus and in the works of Valentinus,among many others. In the middle ages Hermeticism and Alchemy kept them alive,while during the Nineteenth century Eliphas Levi and others triggered an OccultRevival, and put into print many of the Hermetic Kabbalistic texts and it is fromhere that so much of our heritage derives. The task is still ongoing, there is muchrestoration to be made.The Foundations of the KabbalahThe Foundations of the KabbalahThe foundation of the Kabbalah is in numbers and shapes. It represents a mathemat-ical and geometrical way to understand the formation of the universe. Since theuniverse has been formed by emanation, stepping down from one level to another,then some framework is needed to comprehend the process. We can deduce thismathematical mysticism in the works of Pythagoras and many of the Greek Schoolas well as in the earliest Christian and Gnostic traditions. In Jesus Christ, Sun of"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 91God (David Fideler, Quest Books 1993) for example, we have an outline of thesecret numerical codes found in the New Testament. In the works of Valentinus, themaster Gnostic, we have an outline of the formation of the universe as a mathemati-cal sequence. Valentinus outlined a meticulous system which charted the movementfrom “divine depth”, to the dyad of depth and silence, to the four principles, to theOgdoad and then onto the Decad and Dodecad. As time progressed the Kabbalisticform of mysticism became codified and the resulting structure came to be called the“Tree of Life”. The tree of life being a geometrical progression from the point, tothe line, to a triangle (two dimensions) and to a pyramid (three dimensions). It is thedevelopment of life in a geometrical form. (fig 23).The story of its form begins with no-thing. This is the state beyond all comprehen-sion, it can have no attributes or form. It is absence, since to be some-thing is to bedefined. In some sense it is even beyond no-thing, for no-thing is a negation of athing. In the Secret Gospel of John it is called the Invisible Spirit.It is not fitting to think of it as divine or something of the sort,for it is superior to deity, nothing presides over it, for nothinghas mastery over it, it does not exist in any state of inferiority,it exists in it alone because it lacks nothing. For it is utterfullness.Secret Gospel of John 1:33-2:4.At some time, before time, (since time and space were not) the Invisible Spirit whothe Kabbalists know as Ain began to transform. It began to think, to expand andcontract - to move. It is impossible to really describe what occurred, and hencelanguage performs only a symbolic task. This expansion is known as eternity,limitlessness, boundlessness and endlessness and is called Ain Soph. As theInvisible Spirit begins to transform further, it becomes blazing endless light. In thiscreative phase it is known as Ain Soph Aur or Limitless Light. Together these threephases of the Invisible spirit are known as the Unmanifest or negative existence.From the Unmanifest the Tree of life manifests. The Tree of life is composed of tencentres known as Sephira (Sephiroth in plural), they are connected by twenty-two"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 92paths. The first manifestation is Kether, the point, the Creator. Kether is the font ofcreation, the focus of light and power.From Kether manifests the two differentiations of Binah and Chokmah. These formthe line, a natural progression from the point. Chokmah is wisdom, illuminatingintelligence, it is related to the active principle and is therefore sometimes known asAbba, the Great Father. Binah is understanding or reflective intelligence. As acentre it is passive and seen as feminine, and is therefore known as Aima, the GreatMother. These two centres can be related to force and form and substance andconsciousness. These three centres form the Supernals, they are seen as somehowseparate from the rest of the tree and are divided from the lower seven centres bythe abyss or barrier. While they are perfect and Static in nature (at least in the worldof Atziluth), the lower seven centres are mixed and offer amalgams of light anddarkness.Fig 23Fig 24"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 93The fourth centre is Chesed or Gedulah. It is known as Mercy and is consideredmale and positive in action. In traditional texts it is known as receptive intelligence.Some descriptions of it include love, majesty and magnificence. The fifth centre isGeburah. It is known as Severity or radical intelligence. While it is seen asfeminine, it has characteristics not of passiveness but of strength and force. It ismartial in tone.The sixth centre is Tiphareth. It is known as beauty or mediating intelligence. It hascharacteristics of harmony and equilibrium. It forms the point of the triangle ofChesed, Geburah and itself. Between Tiphareth and Netzach and Hod is anotherabyss known as the “Lesser Veil” or Paroketh. This forms the dividing line betweenthe mind (and the astral worlds) and the higher dimensions of consciousness.The lower pyramid is formed of Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malkuth. Their charac-teristics are:Netzach.Victory, Occult Intelligence. Emotion or Generation.Hod.Glory, Perfect Intelligence. Mind or Psyche.Yesod.Foundation, Clear Intelligence. Astral.Malkuth.Kingdom, resplendent intelligence.The Gnostic Tradition and the Tree of LifeThe Gnostic Tradition and the Tree of LifeAs we will show later in more detail, the Gnostics saw the development of theuniverse as an emanatory process. As the process of emanation expands, elementsof degeneration manifest themselves. These elements of degeneration can be seen inmany different ways, what we are really describing is the Alpha Event. After theerror occurred, the emanation process continued, albeit, on a lower octave. There isthe Treasury of Light (the Supernals) and the World of the Archons. In the lowerkingdom emanation continues, and there are hierarchies of light and darkness - thereare Aeons and Archons. The Tree of Life documents a model of the emanationprocess, below the dividing line of the “abyss” there is a mixture of light anddarkness, emanations which are fallen but which also hold particles of light. Themedieval writers of the grimoires illustrated this mixture by attributing an intelli-gence and spirit to each planet; a positive and negative force.The barriers that exist within the Tree of Life are of vital importance. While in our"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 94discussions of the Alpha Event we examined the great Chasm, there are actuallytwo breeches in the emanation scheme. There is the great chasm or Abyss betweenthe Supernals and the lower seven centres, and the lesser veil or Paroketh whichdivides the lower tree from the higher spiritual dimensions. The Supernals form theTreasury of Light in the world of Atziluth, while below everything is a mixture ofStatic and Dialectic, Aeons and Archons. In Briah and the upper reaches ofYetzirah the forces are fixed, in the lower reaches of Yetzirah (the astral) there isthe strongest Dialectic presence. The Chasm or Abyss is of great significance to theGnostics. It is the division between the light world and the Archons, it is describedvariously as a Wall, palisade, turnstile and portal. It is seen as the great divide orbarrier (Horos), and is said to be bounded with an embankment of dazzling whitefire flaming walls. Between the higher and lower worlds is a narrow bridge, a rope,a ladder or a gateway through which only the Transfigured can pass. The bestknown symbol of this abyss is the cross (Stauros), it is pre-Christian in origin andincludes pre and post Christian symbolism. It emphasises that only through death tothe world of the Archons and rebirth and resurrection to light, can we enter theTreasury. In the Hermetic tradition, Saturn (Binah) is seen as the Guardian of theAbyss. After the soul has left earth it must venture through the seven planets,however only with correct passwords and codes can it pass each obstacle. When itconfronts Saturn the soul is truly tested, only if it is of the Light Kingdom will it beallowed to pass. If it fails, the soul plummets back through the planets and returnsagain to earth. Since in many traditions Saturn is also the Demiurge, we can see adual nature. Saturn as guardian (in the Static Kingdom) and the dark half of Saturn,existing below the abyss as the Demiurge. The abyss is both a doorway and a seal,it tests and also destroys.The Twenty Two PathsThe Twenty Two PathsEach of the ten Sephira is connected to the others by a sequence of paths. Whilethere are many different forms these paths take, the most accepted system is thatshown in fig 24. Each of these paths is attributed to a Hebrew letter according to theKabbalistic tradition first outlined in the Sepher Yetzirah. To each of these paths amass of correspondences may be added; colours, sounds, Godforms, animals,images and so on. According to one tradition the Tarot cards can be attributed tothese paths as well. The minor cards (1-10) are attributed to the Sephira, the King,Queen, Prince and Page (Princess) cards are attributed to Chokmah, Binah,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 95Tiphareth and Malkuth and the twenty-two trumps are given over to the paths.There is much debate about the exact attribution, we cover this subject in detail inour courses on the Kabbalah and the Tarot.The Four WorldsThe Four WorldsThe tree of life has activity on four levels; known as the four worlds. These fourworlds as seen as the four stages of the secret formula of the Israelites, theTetragrammaton of YHVH.

This can be extended so that there is a further tree of life in each world,thus formulating forty centres.

It seems that in ancient times written text was used in a form similar tomodern day codes and it was used by the priest-class to preserve and transmit arcaneknowledge. It is even quite possible that this use predated the more general use ofwritten forms and that the primary function of the written word was originallyreligious rather than communicative. Some occult historians have even suggestedthat some of the blame for the downfall of Egypt could be placed at the feet of thepriests, who in confusing the hieratic and popular scripts (also causing the mixture ofesoteric and exoteric forms) lost the Great Mysteries which were at the core ofEgyptian society.It is difficult today to conceptualise language in a religious sense, we tend to see thewritten script in a purely utilitarian way. The closest we may get to it is consider thelanguage of a computer. In computer languages the language is only useful in that itis able to create a certain result (i.e. a code produces a function in the givensoftware). These languages have no value except that they communicate certainagreed functions which trigger certain results. The occult languages are the same,their value is in the agreed meaning to the symbols and the resulting increase inknowledge that occurs. In neither occult or computer languages is there a socialelement, the code represents certain actions or realities and causes certain effects.Since language today has a social and communicative function we tend to lose sightof its esoteric significance.

The"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 105three mother letters are the Supernals and when added to the seven double letters- we have the ten Sephira. If we then add the twelve single letters, we have thetwenty two Paths of the tree.If we accept that the letters are symbols or glyphs which represent certainvibrations or energies, then it would be reasonable to say that words are combina-tions of vibrations and therefore can have hidden meanings beyond their writtenform. For example, the word Achad in Hebrew means one or unity, this is itssimple meaning. It is composed of the letters Aleph, Cheth and Daleth, if we addthese together we get thirteen. If we accept that the vibration of the word isrepresented by its letters; then by investigating the number thirteen we can come tounderstand more about the word Achad. In Hebrew another word which isenumerated as thirteen is Ahavah (which means love). Here we have anotherinteresting correlation - unity = love. If add them together we arrive at twenty six.Twenty six is the number of the Tetragrammaton or the four lettered formula whichrepresentatives the true and hidden nature of the universe. So we may concludethat the ultimate truth beyond duality is that unity and love are the same. This isjust a slight indication of how the esoteric secrets of the Hebrew alphabet can bedecoded.GematriaGematriaThis process of exploring the relationship between words and numbers is known asthe Kabbalah of number, there are many different applications of this art; we havechosen three for consideration here. Gematria is the form we have illustratedabove, it uses the simple numerics of each letter and by combining them in variousways and comparing them to other words is able to reach a deeper understanding.It should be noted that this art can be applied to many languages, we are simplyusing Hebrew as an example since it was one of the primary languages used by theGnostics. Two other forms we will consider here are Notariqon and Notariqon ofthe Tenach. Temura is a further form which uses agreed tables of numericalcorrespondence i.e. certain numbers or letters are attributed to other lettersaccording to an agreed formula. Temura is not a popular form of the Kabbalah ofnumber as without the table of attribution the work becomes undecipherable."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 106Notariqon and Notariqon of the TenachNotariqon and Notariqon of the TenachThe art of Notariqon is perfect in its simplicity, in some sense it could beconsidered a sort of Gnostic shorthand. It consists of making new words out of theletters of the original. One of the better examples of this art is found in thealchemical term Vitriol which was used as the codeword for Sulphur. However,when analysed, it has a deeper meaning. (fig 26) In Fig 26 we have a comprehen-sive description of the alchemical process coded into the term used for Sulphur, asuperb illustration of how Notariqon can be used. The Notariqon of the Tenach isused more within the Gnostic and religious communities than within practicalesoteric science. It can be seen primarily as an extension of the Notariqontechnique where parts of a larger word are then used to create other words. Forexample, the term Tenach is the title given to the books of the Old Testament, it iscomposed of three letters Tau, Nun and Kaph (final). These are seen as abbrevia-tions for a further three words.Tau.Torah.The five books of Moses.Nun.N’vee-im.The Prophets.Kaph.K’soovim.Rest of the Old Testament.VVisitaVisitIInteriorathe interiorTTerraeof the earthRRecificandofindIInveniesand rectifyOOccultumthe secretLLapidemstone.Fig 26"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 107The Creation of FormulaeThe Creation of FormulaeBy combining the arts of Gematria and Notariqon it is possible to produceformulae which outline various phases of esoteric practise. The use of suchformulae is especially relevant in relation to ritual and liturgical practise. It allowsus to evoke a wide range of associations by the correspondences related to theletters in the given formulae. Some of the better known formulae used within theWestern Mystery Tradition include INRI and YHVH.The INRI formulaThe INRI formulaThe letters INRI were those which were placed on the top of the cross on whichJesus was crucified. However, as time progressed and centuries passed, these fourletters have gained a variety of esoteric interpretations and have transformed froman historical icon into an occult formula. By Notariqon the letters have beeninterpreted to include...Igne Nitrum Renovatur Integra.The whole of nature is renewed by fire.Igne Nitrum Raris Invenitum.Glittering is rarely found in fire.These two interpretations express divergent views regarding the Alchemicalprocess of self transformation. One is the cosmic no, the other - the cosmic yes.One perceives the fire of passion as the way to renew the fallen world, the otherwarns of its danger. Both are correct and have something to say about the humancondition. Another application given to these letters is to attribute them to the fourelements. (fig 27) This elemental attribution leads to the more esoteric interpreta-tion of this formulae as found within the teachings of The Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, in this interpretation the letters are related to Hebrew letters,astrological signs and the trumps of the Tarot. (Fig 28) Since this is a cyclicformulae, starting at I and ending at I, the final I is inferred and hence droppedfrom the formulae. We are accordingly left with INR. When this is found in theancient Egyptian and Gnostic systems, it is in the secret word IAO. This formulaecan be understood in terms of the old Egyptian myth of the death of Osiris andhence we have Isis, Apophis, Osiris. In the Gnostic Pantheon we can find a similarinterpretation but with O being used to represent Oen or Aeon, the term used for a"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 108IYamWaterNNourFireRRuachAirIYebeshahEarthFig 27IYodVirgoThe HermitNNunScorpioDeathRReshSunThe SunIYodVirgoThe Hermit.Fig 28The Formula of IAOThe Formula of IAOIsis is the IIsis is nature, the fallen world, whose hus-band Osiris (the soul locked in matter) ismurdered byApophis is the AApophis.

(Fig 29)These interpretations of INRI and IAO centre on the death and resurrection of theGnostic and the awakening of the light being within. Of course, this returns us tothe start of the formulae, INRI as written on the top of the cross used to crucifyChrist.The Formula of YHVHThe Formula of YHVHYHVH is another formulae of great importance in the esoteric tradition. Whilemany religious groups have translated this formula as Jehovah and interpreted it asthe personal name of God. It is actually a formula, rather than a name ordesignation. (fig 30) The original ancient Israelites understood this and henceavoided pronouncing this divine name using substitute terms such as Lord andKing. While the Old Testament accounts have corrupted the name and used it todesignate a warrior like Archon, the original formulae is still valid and of value.This again illustrates how the origjnal Gnosis has unwittingly been passed downinside and behind a text which teaches the exact opposite.YYodAtziluthInitial ForceFireHHeBriahDivine PatternWaterVVauTipharethActivityAirHHeMalkuthResultEarthFig 30YodStart of riteStart of operationHeInvocationCalling down forcesVauEvocationCalling up forcesHeManifestationIntegrationFig 31"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 110Yod will represent a swift and violent creative energy, follow-ing this will be a calmer and more reflective but even morepowerful flow of Will, the irresistible force of a mighty river(He).

In ritual activity, for example, we may createthe associations as seen in fig 31. From this admittedly brief examination of theKabbalah of number you should have some idea of its practical use. However, it isimportant not to think that these number systems are isolated to Hebrew. If weaccept our “Gnostic Identity” hypothesis that the lost tribes of Israel traversed theglobe before settling in Ireland, England and Europe, then we should also find thesame Gematria at work in other Indo-European languages. After much research,this is certainly was has been discovered. Sanskrit for example, is believed to havebeen introduced when the Aryans invaded India and has similar forms of Gematriaand code. Though it is certainly more difficult to use since it has fifty two ratherthan twenty two letters ! There are many other languages with developed Gematriafunctions, we have chosen the Druidic, Runic and Enochian to consider here, albeitbriefly.The Celtic LegacyThe Celtic LegacyIn the lands of the ancient Celts the Mysteries were recorded in many differentways. For many years academics believed that the Celts only transmitted theirwisdom orally, however, recent research now suggests that they used specialisedalphabets for ritual purposes. The most commonly used form was known asOgham, named after the Celtic sun god Ogha from whom it supposedly derived.Ogham’s use was primarily esoteric and is believed to have developed on the west"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 111coast of Ireland, probably as a refinement of the finger languages of the Druids.Another esoteric Celtic system is known as the Tree Alphabet. One poetic and nottoo scholarly form of this code was published in “The White Goddess” by RobertGraves (Faber and Faber 1948). The Tree Alphabet or Beth Luis Nion is based onthe Druidic mysteries, it is composed of twenty nine letters divided into fourgroups. Each group is related to various esoteric concepts, seasonal rites andgroups of trees. The major seven letters were known as the Chieftain letters, theywere attributed to the trees Oak, Hazel, Holly, Yew, Ash, Pine and Apple. Eachwas further attributed to a period of the year as were all of the twenty nine letters.However, the Chieftain letters governed the seven most important periods, forexample, the Oak governed from the 10th June to the 7th July and was celebratedwith the feast of Druir, which marked the Midsummer fires.The RunesThe RunesCommunication among the peoples remained a secondaryfunction of the Runic writing throughout it’s long history,much more common was the use of Runes to invoke higherpowers to effect and influence the minds and fortunes of men.Prof. R.M.V. ElliotThe Runes are considered to have developed from the early picture-graphs used bythe Aryan priest-class during the Bronze age. It is thought that even at this earlystage the Runes were used to represent religious and esoteric concepts, rather thanfor communication. These earlier Runic images have been found in abundancethroughout England, Ireland, Scandinavia, and to a lesser extent in other parts ofEurope.While the earlier Runes were in pictograph form, after interaction with the variouscultures of the Mediterranean the symbols began to take on the phonetic represen-tations of language. It is difficult to date this transition, but it is thought to haveoccurred around the second century BCE when the invasion of the Teutons of theItalian peninsula brought them into contact with both the Latin and Etruscanalphabets. After this period of transition, the Runes developed into a mature"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 112alphabet of divination and magic. While certainly the early pictograph forms of theRunes had occult significance, it is primarily since the second century that they havebecome a fully working system.There are different systems of Runic interpretation, one of the more complete isFuthark. In Futhark there is a fully developed symbol system which correlatessound, letters, bodily postures, dates and timing as many other correspondences.Both the Druidic traditions and the Runic seem to have much in common with theAriosophic Hebraic forms. While the outer form may vary, the essential Gnosisremains the same.The Legend of OdinThe Legend of OdinIn Norse mythology Odin is the God of Magic, his name originates from theAnglo-Saxon and means Pure Spirit. He may be equated with Thoth and Mercury,but has many discrete and unique characteristics. Odin is believed to be responsiblefor bringing Runecraft to humanity. As part of his initiatory quest he hung on theWorld Tree (Ygdrassill) for nine days and nights and finally, falling from the Tree,grasped the Runes to his bosom and brought them back to earth. The Kabbalisticimagery here is obvious, and shows how widely the Shamanic practises of theAriosophic tradition had spread across the globe. The Shamanic quest of Odin isbeautifully expressed in the poetic form of the Elder Edda.I trow that I hung on the windy tree,swing there nights all nine,gashed with a blade,bloodied for Odin,myself an offering to myself,knotted to that tree,no man knowswhither the roots of it run,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 113none gave me bread,none gave me drink,down to the depthsI peered,to snatch up the Runeswith a roaring screamand fell in a dizzied swoon.Well-being I wonand wisdom too,I grew and joyed in my growthfrom a word to a word,I was led to a wordfrom a deed to another deed.The legend of Odin symbolises the initiatory quest of Transfiguration. While usingthe Shamanic imagery of the Indo-Europeans, it embodies the transformationprocess albeit expressed in a different, while equally expressive and potent symbolsystem. As we experience the Tree of Life (Ygdrassill) gaining knowledge fromeach of its nine centres (except earth), we must grasp (comprehend) the secretalphabet (the paths), and integrate them whilst still existing in a fallen or earthlyform. This knowledge or Gnosis can then be used to help us grow in wisdom,leading us from “word to word, deed to another deed” until we are new and rebornbeings.The Mysteries of EnochianThe Mysteries of EnochianThe Enochian script is a most unusual form of esoteric language. It is named afterEnoch, who it is rumoured, reached such a high state of illumination that he “walkedwith God and was not”. Enochian as a language or symbol-system did not developor evolve naturally as most languages do, but was “received” through the crystal"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 114gazing visions of John Dee (1527-1608) through the mediumship of Edward Kelly. ohnDee, a respected Scientist and later Alchemist, began experimenting with the occultsciences but found himself most successful in using a crystal with the assistance of asensitive medium. As they began to receive messages they found themselves incommunication with a strange and powerful force which outlined a complete, yetcryptic arcane system, this complex revelation had its own syntax and internalconsistency and was one of great potency. Since it was only of esoteric value, thecorrect pronunciations of the various letters and words triggered, and can still trigger,altered states of consciousness. From these communications Dee developed a systemof Elemental Squares, Calls and Aires associated with terrifying visions and prophe-cies. These were refined and adapted by such later esoteric orders as The HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn and the Aurum Solis (Order of the Sacred Word). Probablyone of the most vivid accounts of the visions and experiences that can be triggered byits use are found in The Vision and the Voice by Aleister Crowley.He will see the beautiful colours within these Enochian names,feel the forces that emanates from them and be transported to astrange world long since passed from this earth.He will walk the great plains and mountains of a strange, ancientkingdom across which pass red-eyed horses bearing strange Godsin glowing robes of pure colour.He will see the sun rise from dark mountains into a sky of violetand gold.Michael A Howard,Runes and other Magical Alphabets, Aquarian Press, 1978.The Practical Use of Occult AlphabetsThe Practical Use of Occult AlphabetsOccult alphabets or alphabets used for occult purposes are not simply psychologicalfiling systems. While certainly they can provide us with structures through whichcorrespondences can be categorised and used, they are far more than just this. Whileit may be popular to reduce the effects of such systems to “unconscious journeys”, it is"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 115not wise. These ancient languages offer a methodology through which it is possibleto experience altered states and realities, to explore dimensions both within andbeyond the human psyche.There are many different systems, many such as Enochian and the Alphabet ofDesire (Austin Spare) are modern and artificial in creation. Others such as Hebrewand Greek have followed the normal organic growth paths of language, but stillhold the codes hidden within them. Others still, like Futhark, are long since deadby the way of social communication, but still resonate with occult power.Each of these languages opens a door to a world of practical application. Forexample, research into the secrets of the Hebrew code has shown that it can beused as a sound system with relationships to physical, astral and etheric parts ofthe human organism and that it encompasses a complex system of Mudra (handmovement) and sound. While there is still a lot of research to do, we are at laststarting to realise the potential of these languages and their relationship to theKabbalah and Gnostic practise. The word rune comes from Runa and means “toWhisper”, in some sense this suggests the great respect shown for these languagesby the original practitioners. To whisper and to speak from mouth to ear - eachsuggests the original oral nature of the alphabets and hence their close relationshipto the Kabbalistic Mysteries. Israel Regardie in his introduction to Enochianstudies gives us some good advice about the its power and dangers, this warningcan certainly be extended to apply equally to the use of all occult alphabets.Enochian is a very powerful system and if carelessly used will bring about disasterand spiritual disintegration. The warnings given are not be to be regarded asplatitudinous moralising but represent knowledge of the true facts.X"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 116If we contemplate our Kabbalistic model in light of the Alpha Event, we come torealise that the finaldivision between the worldsoccurs just below thesolar sphere. This barrier,known as the Paroketh,is a further stepping down inthe emanation process.(fig 32) The upmost world(Supernals) is that ofPure light, the intermediateworlds (between theAbyss and Paroketh) is amixed system but witha large percentage of light.While the lower worlds(below Paroketh) are amixed system with alarge percentage of darkness(Dialectic law), accel-erating until the Archonstake predominance inthe astral and physicalworlds. Contact be-tween the Treasury of lightand the other worlds isonly possible through an in-termediary - the SolarSphere. However, since theintermediate kingdomis also fallen, the SolarSphere transmits bothpure and fallen vibrations, inreligious terms it trans-mits the energies of theTreasury of Light andthe forces of the Archons. Inthe terms of esotericscience, it transmits X andY factors. (Fig 32)To explain this point further, the Treasury of Light, which exists beyond andbehind the sun, uses the Solar Logos as a gateway through which higher forces canre-awaken man. These forces are, in Gnostic terms, the Logos and Sophia. Whenthey are manifested within the life of a Gnostic the True Self is awakened and thestudent becomes Christed. The Logos and Sophia are the twin poles of the Xfactor. At the same time however, the Sun also transmits the destructive currents ofthe Demiurge, these must be resisted and controlled if liberation is to be achieved.Fig 32: Veils on the Tree ofLife"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 117This destructive current is known as the Y factor, and also has twin poles, the X andY factors create a Solar cross of four energy forces. (fig 33) The Solar Sphere is,hence, the focus of the mystery tradition, whether it be Apollo, Mithra, Christ, Horusor Ra, we can see the secret teachings in application. The Solar sphere itself becamea symbol of the hidden mysteries. At rising it is the Logos, at the Height it is theChrist, at setting it is Sophia. This represents the doorway through which fallenmankind can awaken.I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, andshall go in and out, and find pasture.John 10:9The imagery of the Solar Sphere is central to our understanding of the technology ofthe Gnosis. These forces control mankind and influence our religion, philosophy andway of life. We can see in the many sun based cultures of the past, both destructiveand constructive facets of solar imagery. For example, the use of human sacrifice tosatisfy the demands of the Father Sun in Aztec culture obviously marked their loss ofGnosis and domination by the fallen Solar sphere. While the adoration of the threephases of the Sun within the Mithraic tradition helped explain the forces of theLogos, Christ and Sophia. (Fig 34).At the same time, however, we can see thedestruction and degeneration of Mithraic worship in the Caesar cults of Rome.The Solar GatewayX FactorsY FactorsFig 33"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 118We must take care when studying these theologies not to link positive withspiritual light, and negative with spiritual darkness.

While Mithra is seen as a Solar God, at timeshe is also seen as a Saturnian lord ruling over the Sun and Moon. This is becauseSaturn was related to Zurvan, the supreme God of Time (equivalent to the Lord ofWisdom), with the Logos being related to the Sun and Sophia to the Moon. WhilstMithra was a Sun being, the Saturnian imagery indicated to the faithful that theSolar sphere was simply Zurvan's presence in the lower world - this is an importanttruth. This mystery is even more complicated when we realise that Saturn is theguardian of the abyss, and consists two aspects. The lower aspect of Saturn is seenas the Demiurge, while the higher is seen as the Guardian or Watcher. So we haveMithra as a mixed deity, representing both the light Sun ruled by the Guardian,reflecting Zurvan and a hint that the sun also contains the darker force which issymbolised by the Demiurge or negative Saturn.The Treasury of Light cannot exist in the lower worlds, due to the fallen nature ofthe Dialectic kingdoms. Accordingly, the Solar sphere becomes the intermediary,the manifestation and the gateway. In some sense this is where the legend ofincarnation or the Avatar sprang from. The belief that God came into the lowerworlds is an adaptation or analogy to the process whereby the Treasury of Light ismanifested in the currents of Light, via the solar sphere. For the Gnostic, Jesus wasMichael, a created being who incarnated and became Christed, he was not Godmade flesh. There are many other entities who being Old Souls achieve Christhoodand become Son/Suns. In this sense these beings become manifestations of theSun, and accordingly, we can appreciate how the incarnation motif becameaccepted, while not accepting its more anthropomorphic interpretation.SSOLAR OLAR MMYTHOLOGIESYTHOLOGIESThe Solar tradition has many forms. The most common adaptation is that found inthe language of myth and legend where the X and Y factors take on anthropomor-phic forms. For the Gnostic the Logos and Sophia are the twin poles of the Xfactor. One traditional adaptation, for example, was for the Logos to be related tothe Sun and Sophia to the Moon, and this led to a wide range of sexual dualitytraditions using God and Goddess images. While these are fine in their place, it is"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 120important to see them as mythological forms only, to worship the Sun or the Moonis to fall into the greatest error, and comes under the dominion of the Demiurge.Since reproduction is only a thing of the lower world and resulted from the error ofmatter, the images of fertility can only with extreme care be related to the Logosand Sophia. While certainly we can see reproduction as the process of uniting theLogos and Sophia within ourselves, which gives birth to a “child self”, in the Statickingdom, to allow this imagery to degenerate into nature worship or the idolisationof family is a great aberration.It must always be remembered that the Sun being the gateway to the lower worldalso transmits the forces of the Demiurge. The solar sphere can destroy as well asheal, corrupt as well as make whole. This tradition is embodied in many earlymyths and legends. For example, Horus and Set of Ancient Egypt, the twins of theSun, where Horus is the power and glory of the solar sphere, and yet hidden withinhis breast is Set, the fallen and dark one. In nature this can also be readilydiscerned, the Sun can create deserts, as well as sustain the beauty of the forest -the sun burns just as quick as its causes growth.Fig 34Setting Sun (Sophia)Sun At Midday: Mithra/ChristRising Sun (Logos)"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 121The Nature of the Solar CurrentsThe Nature of the Solar CurrentsThe energies which are emanated from the solar sphere have certain distinctcharacteristics. These characteristics help us to appreciate the nature of both X andY forces. The major traits of these energies is that they are all pervasive, andinterpenetrate all levels of the intermediate and lower worlds. (Briah and below).They are contractive and expansive, which means they may be magnified to fill atemple space, or concentrated to act through a talisman or icon.Both energies are manipulatable, that is, they can be modified and utilised throughthe trained will of the Gnostic. At the same time, this manipulation is only valuableif controlled by the True Self, as these energies will bring about subtle changeswhich are not discernible if only controlled by the psyche. Both energies areimitative and contactive, they form links with the objects they contact, and canmodify or be modified to reflect the shape or form of any object.Both energies are absorbent, they can be programmed and imbued with certaincharacteristics. It should be noted that while X and Y factors can be programmed,they have inherent tendencies. X factors trend towards light, Y towards darkness.Both energies are cumulative, but have built in obsolescence. So while the energiescan be collected into a certain form and accumulated, unless this is sustained, theenergy will dissipate. Both X and Y factors tend to polarise, so within the X andY factors there are X and Y poles.These characteristics of the X and Y factors are important, for they illustrate thatboth energies can be used in very similar ways. It is only the long term effects ofthe respective forces that makes the difference. A Gnostic using the X factors anda Sorcerer using the Y may seem little different in practise, however, the resultingtransformation will be markedly variant. The process of using the X factor and"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 122suppressing the Y results in experiencing Transfiguration and Ascension. Using theY factors and suppressing the X will result in disintegration and ultimately Archonicdomination.Solar MeditationsSolar MeditationsWhile discussing the X and Y factors emanated from the Solar Sphere may seem alltoo theoretical, there is a very practical application of such knowledge. If the SolarSphere emanates X and Y factors then it may be suggested that by correspondence,these energies are within the light particles emanated from the physical sun.Accordingly, a system of Solar meditation may be developed. This form of practiseis found in many of the great esoteric systems that have existed throughout time, theEssenes daily greeted the Sun at dawn, their Calendar, in opposition to theprevailing calendar of the Pharisees, was solar rather than lunar based. The ancientHindus had an evolved system of Surya Yoga, the Mayans and Aztecs believed thatthe Sun was a great source of power that had to be honoured and supplicated, andin most of the old pagan traditions the Sun had an honoured place. Probably one ofthe most outstanding examples is found in Akhenaton, the Sun Pharoah of ancientEgypt. For the Gnostic the physical sun is a window through which the Solar Sphereshines, it emanates X and Y factors which influence and control the development ofhumanity. By using Solar meditations it is possible to increase our receipt of Xfactors, and hasten our spiritual development. As the energy is received from theSun the physical rays of light enter the eyes and pass their energy into the physicalsystem, while at the same time the X and Y factors are absorbed into the astral andetheric bodies and circulated through the Meridians, Chakras and Marmas.A Simple Solar MeditationA Simple Solar MeditationSolar meditations do not have to be complex. There are many beautiful prayers tothe Sun in many traditions. The prayer to Aten written by Akhenaton is one primeexample. In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, supplications were offered tothe Sun at four times daily; sunrise, midday, sunset and midnight. The importantthing however, is to create a personal system of meditation, not to learn sometechnique by rote. Some schools like to use Solar meditations four times a day,some only at sunrise or sunset, it is really up to you to find what suits. There are two"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 123simple techniques which can be used with some success. The basic solar meditationis probably most successful at sunrise. You stand facing towards the rising sun. Youshould be awake, relaxed and prepared a few minutes before the Sun rises. Youbegin to meditate on the concept of the “Treasury of Light” and the great fullness(Pleroma), and the power of the Light worlds. As the sun rises you start to feel itslight radiations and feel the light hitting the back of your eyes. (which should beclosed) As the Sun rises you may like to use a prayer, affirmation or supplication,it is up to you.A more advanced technique used within the Meso-American tradition is similar tothe above except that you start to jog on the spot as you are preparing for the sun torise. As the sun ascends you jog faster and faster until a sense of catharsis isexperienced, and you experience an awakening by the Solar force.If you prefer a more formal approach, you can find the more traditional four dailySun meditations in the various books on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,or alternatively, you may like to use some of the Sun prayers found in works ofAkhenaton and the Essenes.Hail unto Thee who art Ra in thy rising,even unto Thee who art Ra in thy strength,who travellest over the Heavens in thy bark at the uprising ofthe Sun.Liber Resh vel HeliosSolar PractisesSolar PractisesThere are other Solar practises which are important in the life of the Gnostic. Theseare based on the belief that if the Gnostic is in a state of spiritual regeneration, thenit is possible to absorb more X factors by exposing yourself to Solar energy. It isimportant that during these exercises the focus is kept on the fullness of the Lightworld, this way the energies received are X not Y factors. Some simple techniques"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 124that have proved useful are as follows, again make them your own.Find a comfortable place where you will not be interrupted, and where you areexposed to the sun. Do not perform it in the middle of the day, choose a sensibleperiod when the heat is not too strong. Lie down either on a comfortable chair orthe ground. Close your eyes, allow the suns rays to fall on the back of the eyes.Meditate on the light world, and visualise yourself absorbing the rays from the Sun.Do this for around 5-10 minutes, it can be increased to around 20 minutes, but notmore each day.An interesting variation is to watch the inside of the eyelids and notice the strangecolours and shapes formed by the light falling on the eyes. Visualise these as Xfactors entering the psychic system of the body and use your visualisation skills toform them into shapes and symbols. The emphasis here is the use of activevisualisation method to increase the amount of X factor received.ConclusionConclusionThe Sun and all of matter are part of a mixed energy field. The lower worlds are amaze of destructive and constructive forces, light and darkness and carry thepotential for liberation or dissolution. The forces that emanate through the sun offeropportunities for life or death, ascension or obliteration. Like the physical Sun, itcan heal or hurt, it can scorch the earth or foster life.

Various ideologies and perspectives are played offagainst each other through many incarnations offering a chance, a glimpse ofimmortality.

The fundamentalist Christian concept of simply giving yourlife to Jesus is utterly alien to the teachings of the Gnosis. The process of being bornagain is just that, a process. Just as a child takes nine months from conception tobirth so the process of being reborn takes a long period of time, perhaps even manylives. The moment of conception is that time when you decide to enter theTransfigurative Path. From that conception you begin to grow and transform from aperson of the flesh, to a being of spirit, from a slave of the Archons to an Aeon ofLight. For most of us, this transformation is not completed within our timeline (ourallotted series of lives) and hence we have to wait until the end of the cosmic cycle,at which time the Transfigured finally return to the Treasury of Light. Accordingly,no one cannot actually be born again until the Omega Day, when those of thePleroma are finally and irreversibly changed from Dialectic to Static substance. Thisis confirmed in 1 John 3:9 where we read...Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seedremainth in him and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.1 John 3:9There a number of key concepts in this verse. Firstly, the concept of “seed” ismentioned. This hints at the radical transformation of the Gnostic (a new seed hasbeen propagated in him). Secondly, it is said that the seed of a reborn person cannotsin ! This is an incredible concept, if you are truly reborn you cannot sin. (Sin meansto miss the mark, not to be in balance with the Light worlds, it does not mean thepetty moral commandment of modern Christianity !) In real terms this means that afully reborn person is permanently one with the Pleroma.

Before anyone can enter the Path of the Serpent of Wisdom (or theCelestial Path) they must have graduated from the Terrestrial path first. TheTerrestrial Path is the path of rebirth for most Gnostics. It transforms the dialecticinto the very substance of the Treasury of Light. In the New Testament it is thePath of the Called.

It is the final secret teaching revealed by Christ to James, his brother andthen to the other Apostles. The teaching was the last stage of the continuingdevelopment of the Mystery teachings. The Mysteries are described in a range ofNew Testament books as The Mystery (Ephesians 3:3), The Mystery of Christ(Ephesians 3:4), The Great Mystery (Ephesians 5:32) and The Administration of theMystery (Ephesians 3;9). This teaching was a special process for a unique class.Certain Gnostics would feel the call to move from the path of Terrestrial Salvationand enter a new phase of development, that of Celestial Deification. This is thenexus of the new specialised teaching, that some of the Gnostic brethren would becalled to become part of the hierarchy itself, in other words, Gods themselves ! Thisspecial Path is known as the Celestial Path, the Path of the Serpent of Wisdom orThe Path of the Chosen Ones. Initiates on this Path were known in the Cathartradition as Parfait; or the Perfected Ones.This Secret doctrine or teaching has been known in many of the Orthodox Churchessince the earliest of days, but has generally been understood by the Orthodox in away that is very different from its original Gnostic meaning.Gods essence is inaccessible. His uncreated and eternal ener-gies (Glory, Light, Love) permeate the universe and makepossible a personal union with man. In its worship the Churchoffers thanksgiving that God has opened the way for man tocome to him and has made union with him possible. This is theOrthodox Churches' teaching of the deification (theosis) ofman, a doctrine based on the Incarnation, which revealed a newperfect humanity.....This union is the goal of prayer and partici-pation in the Sacraments, it involves the co-operation of twowills, divine and human. In this union with God human beingsbecome \"partakers of the divine nature\" (II Peter 1:4) withoutceasing to be creatures.

The problem is that most \"Christians\"have no knowledge of what the word really means ! There is this concept thatrepentance simply means saying “sorry”, in keeping with the traditions of most ofwestern Christianity, you can do whatever you want, as long as you say sorry toGod and receive his forgiveness. However, this is not what the Gnostic tradition(or for that matter the Bible) really says. Yes, there is forgiveness but Grace worksin conjunction with Works. Salvation is a process through which the Treasury ofLight works in conjunction with you ! It is not a one way street ! The actual termrepentance means to turn about, to reverse, to change. It represent the stage atwhich an individual decides his life is going in the wrong direction and turns it"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 134totally about. The term repentance in the Gnostic sense means to awaken to thefact that one's life; being, mind and emotions are chained within the World of theArchons and whatever ones does, one cannot escape. Only by entering the Path ofTransfiguration can liberation be achieved..The first step on the Path (Transfiguration) is to turn away, to repent, to give-up theways of the world (The Dialectic field) and begin the journey to Redemption. Thischange of direction starts with the simple acknowledgement of Transfiguration,and by a conscious effort to start living the life of a true Gnostic.Detachment and Controlled AwarenessDetachment and Controlled AwarenessWhen Buddha said “all life is suffering” he wasn't joking ! The perceptiveness ofGautama Buddha's understanding of how the Dialectic system is perpetuatedcannot be underestimated. As Buddha expressed in his four Noble truthes, all lifeis suffering because we become attached to what happens to us, and attachmentleads to reaction, and reaction to attachment. Buddha's solution is interpreted bymodern scholars of the Buddhist traditions (Himayana and Mahayana) to be totaldetachment. There is a problem however within this interpretation of Buddhism. Ifwe understand that the Dialectic system is sustained by action and reaction, thentotal detachment and total attachment will both have ramifications and by logicaldeduction - reactions. If we see zero, or no linkage to the Dialectic system as thegoal, then Detachment would be negative (-1) and attachment would be positive(+1), both entail actions and reactions. Many Gnostic schools apply westernversions of Buddha's logic (especially those with a moralist orientation), theproblem, however, is that when we attempt to totally detach from the world, thereaction is normally so strong, we end up in total attachment !One of the early stages on the Path is that of \"Controlled Awareness\". ControlledAwareness is becoming totally aware of what is happening within us and aroundus. It involves realising that the process of rebirth involves the \"death\" of the oldterrestrial mind and emotions, and the rebuilding of a new Self. Transfigurationawakens the real self, a Self we have never experienced, and one which is reallyus, and yet so alien - at first. Accordingly, the new Gnostic on the Path must"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 135become aware of the changes that are occurring within him and observe andunderstand the reactions and actions that occur. The \"Controlled\" facet of theawareness is in the fact that the Gnostic must slowly learn to make decisions aboutwhat occurs in his mind and emotions. A pause must be created before an action istaken; an emotion is expressed; a behaviour is enacted, and a decision maderegarding its value in light of the Spiritual Path. In some situations attachment willbe the answer, in others detachment, the key is awareness, and the focus is oncontrolled decision making. Full detachment and full attachment are opposites andhence lead further into the Dialectic rather than away from it, total awareness is theanswer.Study, Conviction and EmotionStudy, Conviction and EmotionThe structure of the psyche must also be taken into consideration. When we readin the Bible and Gnostic texts that we must have no other Elohim (Gods) but the IAM, this has important psychological ramifications. How many of us focus oncareers, money, music, fame or a hundred and one diversions, rather than on ourspiritual goal ? The true Gnostic must be focused on the Spiritual Path and nothingelse. In the Gospels the allegory of giving up everything is used, obviously you arenot expected to give away all your possessions, but you must have no other Gods,but the Lord of Wisdom, and your sole aim must be to reach the Treasury of Light.Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yetlackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distributeunto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: andcome, follow me.Luke 18:22Developing this thought we need to consider the role of the Mind (Ruach) and theEmotions (Nephesh) in our lives. For most of us, prior to entering the Path, ourLords are either the Mind or the Emotions. Yet on the spiritual path this cannot beso, the mind is a good scribe but a bad master, the emotions and the body areexcellent followers but rotten leaders. The new Self which is awakening must take"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 136control of the body (\"Put your House in Order\"), and a restored Mind and Emotionswill take their rightful place beneath it. In the life of the Gnostic there should be asimple set of principles...ÅStudy should come first- study the Scriptures, the Gnostic texts and theRestored Gnostic keys.ÇSecular thinking and belief come second ! Logic and belief must be based on afirm foundation, the foundation of Self and the Lord of Wisdom.ÉThirdly, and definitely only thirdly, comes the body and the emotions. Sure,look after the body, but do so with care ! Just because you wake up one morningfeeling bad does not mean you have fallen off the spiritual path. Remember, theworld is a trap, a Dialectic prison, and accordingly, indulgence (+1) or asceticismand mortification (-1), are both actions and reactions and accordingly are aspects ofthe prison we are caught in.Faith and EducationFaith and EducationOne of the most important steps on the Path is that of education or more correctly,re-education. When the Gnostic begins to study the Bible with the Keys of theMysteries, a whole new understanding will arise and will change the way he looks atthe world forever. Study is one of the major facets of the Path of Transfiguration, andit leads to a radically different way of examining the world. This viewpoint issometimes called faith, but is better described as Conviction. It is a worldview thatgrows out of the experience of the Gnosis. An experiential wisdom that the world isreally a fallen place, and that we are being called home to another world, anotherdimension; another order of being. The process of re-education is constant, as itinvolves a battle. Everyday we are programmed with garbage from the Dialecticsystem. Television, radio, newspapers, novels, books, friends, family members...alloffer us the wisdom of the world. Accordingly, everything we are fed enters into ourminds and conflicts with the new developing Self."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 137This is just the beginning ! Within everyone of us are false selves (Pseudomorphs),little identities created out of desires and unconscious materials (internal Archons).These false selves (like little Gods) demand attention and control. These littleselves are made of unconscious desires and experiences, and hence, are\"restricted\" in focus and knowledge. They are extremely dangerous and destruc-tive. Little Gods of Self Hate, Lust, Narcissism, addictions, etc. control and cloudthe mind and Nephesh. They refuse to allow us to live in the present, replaying pastevents and creating false associations between present events and the past. Theycontrol the mind to such an extent that the Voice of God (the Logos) cannot beheard, and we become lost within our internal fallen worlds. At the same time, theold Ruach (Mind) and Nephesh (emotions) are also false Gods, for their place is insubmission to the awakened Self (True Self) not in domination of it. The structureof the True Man is like a chariot, the body is the Chariot itself, riding in it is theTrue Self, the mind is the reins and the Horses are the emotions. Only when theseconstituents are in their rightful place does the chariot travel in the right direction.The horses are good at their given task, but very bad drivers ! So all things must bein their place, this is the task of Transfiguration. The process of re-educationinvolves a long and arduous battle, in which the old \"Gods\" must die and a newGod is born. The Mind and Emotions are destroyed in the Dark Nights of initiation(see section below on the Dark Night of the Soul for details), and a newmind/emotion complex is formed under the directions of the True Self. Like Osiriswe must rise from the death of our old selves into the new.Lord, I die daily.1 Corinthians 15:30Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: oldthings are passed away; behold, all things are become new.2 Corinthians 5:17"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 138Baptism, Initiation and The AnointingBaptism, Initiation and The AnointingHe went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching abaptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.Luke 3:3Baptism (or immersion into water) represents the first Initiation on the spiritualPath. It is a ritual recognition of the process of rebirth which has been initiated. Therite itself is not the same as the rite of Christening (there is no Gnostic rite for theinitiation of minors). The rite of baptism is by full immersion into water, andrepresents the descent of the “old man” into death (the water) and rebirth as a newcreation. This can be readily seen from Luke 3:3, where Baptism is specificallyreferred to as the Baptism of Repentance. Repentance (as discussed earlier)involves a radical change of life direction, and hence can only be recognised insomeone of mature age. Baptism is the first of the Seven Sacraments used by theGnostic Church. The rite is only available to those who have entered the Path ofTransfiguration. Baptism is one of three Initiations offered by the Gnostic Ecclesia:Baptism by Water, Anointing with the Holy Spirit and Celestial Confirmation. Ascan be seen from the verse below there are two distinct forms of Baptism, both ofwhich are available to those on the Terrestrial Path. There is the Baptism ofrepentance (known in the Bible as the Baptism of Water or John's Baptism), andthere is the Baptism or Anointing with the Holy Spirit or Fire. (The Baptism of theHoly Spirit). The Third Initiation, that of the Celestial Class is a unique rite (not aBaptism) and one we will not elaborate upon in this study.So Paul asked, \"Then what baptism did you receive?\" \"John'sbaptism,\" they replied.Paul said, \"John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. Hetold the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is,in Jesus.\"On hearing this, they were baptised into the name of the LordJesus.Acts 19:3-5"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 139The Anointing of the Holy Spirit is the Baptism with Fire. It is not given with theBaptism of repentance, but is offered later on the spiritual path. As the Baptism ofrepentance is recognition of starting the spiritual path, the Baptism of Fire isrecognition of a certain degree of achievement, and is stimulus for further growth.The Baptism of water symbolises the start of the work of Sophia in cleansing the lifeof the student, it also initiates the growth of the Light Spark in the Gnostic. TheBaptism of fire recognises the growing Spark of Light and accelerates the destructionof the \"Old Man\" within the Gnostic being. As the Spark of Light grows it attemptsto commune with the Mind of God (Logos) to which the Gnostic now has access,however, sin (Dialectic facets) block the way. As the initiate evolves Sophia purifiesand destroys the blockages between the Self and the Logos. This process isrecognised and accelerated by the Initiation of Fire. The Spirit baptism also recog-nises the new Mind and emotions through which the New Man is being formed.Accordingly, as Sophia imparts new gifts and powers. It should be noted that sincethis Baptism initiates new aspects of the Transfiguration process, it should be onlyoffered to mature Gnostics. A Gnostic just on the path, so to speak, by taking thisBaptism can bring on internal experiences beyond his maturity. It is no usedestroying the mind and emotion until you are ready to relinquish control of them tothe new you !There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.There are different kinds of working, but the same God worksall of them in all men.Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for thecommon good.To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom,to another the message of knowledge by means of the sameSpirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts ofhealing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers, toanother prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, toanother speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to stillanother the interpretation of tongues."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 140All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he givesthem to each one, just as he determines.1 Corinthians 12:4-11When they arrived, they prayed for them that they mightreceive the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit had not yetcome upon any of them; they had simply been baptised into thename of the Lord Jesus.Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and theyreceived the Holy Spirit.Acts 8:15-17.Many may argue against separate Baptisms of water and fire and yet clearly in theBook of Acts we have a discussion of the difference between the Baptism in thename of Jesus, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This also leads us to anunderstanding of the esoteric meaning of the name Jesus and the Christ. Jesus as asymbol represents the human principle. In Gnostic literature the name Jesus wassymbolic of the spiritually disciplined life, hence, Baptism in the name of Jesus isthe first Baptism, that of water, discipline and repentance. The Second baptism (oranointing) is that of Fire, it is the Christ Baptism. At this baptism Sophia breaksdown the barriers between the New awakened Self (Pneumatic Spark) and theLogos and the Gnostic enters into communion with the Mind of God. In otherwords, the Lord of Wisdom is present in his soul, he is Christed.Now I realise many traditional Christians (and others) will argue that the Holy Spiritcannot do any harm, it is the spirit of love, and hence these baptisms can be giventogether. But this is just not so, if we continue to read the account in Acts chaptereight, when Simon tries to purchase the power of the Holy Spirit, he is cursed withdeath, he becomes so terrified he asks the disciples to pray and protect him from itspower !In Acts chapter 5 we read of Ananias, who in trying to deceive the Holy Spirit was"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 141killed by the power of God. In addition to these comments we may also note that theonly sin that cannot be forgiven is the \"Sin against the Holy Spirit\" (Mark 3:29).Accordingly, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit or Fire should not be taken lightly.An interesting note on Baptism is found in the Strong's Exhaustive concordancewhere it is considering the difference between two Greek words used for Baptism.Baptizo and Bapto.The note is from the Bible Study magazine (James Montgomery Brice, May 1989).The term used specifically in the New Testament for Baptism is Baptizo...907 baptizo {bap-tid'-zo} Not to be confused with 911, bapto.The clearest example that shows the meaning of baptizo is atext from the Greek poet and physician Nicander, who livedabout 200 B.C. It is a recipe for making pickles and is helpfulbecause it uses both words. Nicander says that in order tomake a pickle, the vegetable should first be 'dipped' (bapto)into boiling water and then 'baptised' (baptizo) in the vinegarsolution. Both verbs concern the immersing of vegetables in asolution. But the first is temporary. The second, the act ofbaptising the vegetable, produces a permanent change. Whenused in the New Testament, this word more often refers to ourunion and identification with Christ than to our water baptism.e.g. Mark 16:16. 'He that believes and is baptised shall besaved'. Christ is saying that mere intellectual assent is notenough. There must be a union with him, a real change, likethe vegetable to the pickle!"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 142Living the Life of a Gnostic:Living the Life of a Gnostic:Overcoming The Dialectic SystemOvercoming The Dialectic SystemIn fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesuswill be persecuted,2 Timothy 3:12Another facet of the Path of Transfiguration is Living the Life. The Dialectic systemis an enemy against which we fight. As we experience more and more of the powerof the Light Kingdoms, then we will battle incessantly against the fallen minions. Infact, anyone who is on the spiritual path will feel the power of the Archons and haveto battle against them. As recommendations for the battle, the Treasury of Lightoffers many guide-lines, these include...ÅKeeping the Sacred Law.ÇSeparation from the World.ÉFellowship.ÑThe Festivals.

Separationfrom the world is of paramount importance. While it is difficult to apply this today,it is abundantly clear that we are keep to our own paths, avoid social contact withthose not of the Gnosis, and sustain our focus on our own tradition.The term fellowship means association, community, communion, joint participation,intercourse, the share which one has in anything, participation, the right hand as asign and pledge of fellowship (Strong's Exhaustive Concordance). It is not simplysocial gathering or friendship, but a communion of those of similar heritage and ofsimilar belief.

However, it is only of value insomuch that thefellowship itself conforms to the dictates of the Gnostic tradition. Fellowship withthe fallen brings destruction.The FestivalsThe FestivalsThe Festivals of Light offer a method of aligning oneself with the Treasury of Light.The festivals are based on agrarian imagery and are therefore aligned with the purityof Pre-Fall man. They celebrate the ebb and flow of the spiritual worlds, and byaligning with them slowly transform our essence from Dialectic to Static. While anextensive study will be made of the festivals, in both theory and practice, in latervolumes, it is useful to appreciate their juxtaposition with festivals of the World.The Feasts of Light celebrate the liberation of man from matter, while traditionalearth festivals used in most Pagan traditions focus on the worship of the earth itself.Earth systems focus on the death and resurrection of the earth and by default makethe celebrator subservient to the earth. Gnostic festivals focus on the death of theDialectic and resurrection of the Static, and by default make the celebrant tri-umphant over earth and a partaker of the powers of Light.Life on the PathLife on the PathLife on the Path is difficult, it is a battle between the things of the world and theTreasury of Light. In the Gnostic traditions there are many descriptions of this battleand what it entails. Within the modern esoteric traditions this battle is posited interms of a force called the \"Dweller on the Threshold\". The dweller guards thecrossroad between the World of the Archons and the Treasury of light and as theGnostic approaches this doorway attacks him without mercy, only those truly on thepath survive. Some Gnostic systems consider this process as a cosmic trek throughthe planets, where at each planet the soul needs special passwords and gestures togain a \"rite of passage\". For others, this battle is seen in terms of an internal quest.For St.John of the Cross, this process was part of the ascent of Mount Carmel,where the Soul would meet its maker. Along the way the soul experiences tormentsand immense pain, as it is purified and prepared for the divine marriage with theDivine."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 144Hence the Dark night with its aridities and voids is the meansto the knowledge of God and self, although the knowledgegiven in this night is not as plenteous and abundant as that ofthe other night of spirit, for the knowledge of this might is as itwere, the foundation of the other.Dark Night of the Soul, St.John of the Cross (N1,12,6 ).(The soul experiencing the Dark Night) resembles one who isimprisoned in a dark dungeon, bound hands and feet and ableneither to move, nor see, nor feel any favour from heaven orearth.Dark Night of the Soul, St.John of the Cross (N2,7,3)Clarifying introduction in brackets ours.In whatever form the Dark Night is experienced it is terrifying. It occurs in thespiritual trek which all who follow the Path undertake. After the initial excitementof entering the Path, and starting the spiritual quest, doubts arise, fears, dreams,terrors, a feeling of abandonment, an inability to study, meditate or concentrate. It isduring this period that the \"old\" mind and emotions are destroyed, so feelings ofdeath and rebirth are not uncommon. It is a truly shattering occurrence. However, itwill be experienced many times along the spiritual path, as the lower vehicles aretransformed and the New Self grows. An excellent description of this process isfound in Alchemical literature. For the Alchemists the product that was beingtransformed into Gold was man himself, and the procedures reflected the spiritualPath.The life of the Gnostic on the Path, involves the total transformation of theindividual from one substance (Dialectic) to another, (Static) and accordingly,involves the greatest revolution in consciousness possible. This transformationcannot be readily expressed in words but needs to be experienced. An interestingdescription of the transformation is given by the German Philosopher FredrichNietszche, when he discusses the process of \"overcoming man\" and becoming theOverman, comparing the gap between Man (Dialectic Man) and the Overman(Static Man) in the following terms...."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 145I teach you the Overman.Man is something that shall be overcome.What have you done to overcome him ?All beings so far have created something beyond themselves;and do you want to be the ebb of this great flow and even goback to the beasts rather than overcome man ?What is the ape to man ?

So many would-be Gnostics seem to accept the Gnostic worldview but tryand live in the same old way, this is simply not good enough. To enter the Path, toexperience Transfiguration - is to transform. The old mind with its associatedcomplexes, reactions and emotions must be dealt with - a new mind, and a new manis needed. We must realise that when we enter the path of Transfiguration the minddoes not change immediately and there is no flash of illumination and all is well.The unconscious is still full of Engrams and the emotions are still tainted. If youtook a group of people out of civilisation and put them in a desert, asking them tobuild a new society, after years of work you would find, to your horror, anotherform of the old civilisation, with all the same evils and all the same problems. Theform may change but things stay the same.The task of the Gnostic is to transform the psyche. Within the Institute for GnosticStudies we have been working on techniques to achieve this goal. We have calledthese techniques Psychogenesis - psycho meaning mind and genesis denotingbeginnings. Psychogenesis thus means the beginning of the mind. In the terms of thegnosis it means the beginning of a new mind or the creation of the soul. Tointroduce you to Psychogenesis, we will examine some basic techniques that haveproved valuable.The Gnostic DiaryThe Gnostic DiaryThe Gnostic diary is a book or folder in which you record your experiences,aspirations and thoughts on a daily basis. In it you should record your successes andfailures, your battles with the “world”, both inner and outer and your spiritualpractises. On a regular basis you should go over what you have written (monthly isa good idea) and analyse what has occurred in your life. It should be kept totallyprivate, shared with no one and in it you should be totally honest. The Gnostic diary"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 147is a useful way to keep track of your transformation. In more romantic times it wasknown as the “Book of Shadows” and the “magicians diary”; for us, it has a morepractical value. While there are more than enough books on the market describingthe process of keeping a spiritual diary, it is important to stress its value and discusssome ways in which it can be used.Dream WorkDream WorkProbably one of the more practical uses of your diary is for dream analysis. It is agood idea to keep your diary by your bed and record your dreams each night. If youfind you are having a particularly difficult time in your spiritual life, set an alarmclock for early in the morning (3 or 4 am) and record your dreams when you awake.Dreams are the unconscious’ way of communicating with the conscious mind, usethem to your advantage. When it comes to interpreting your dreams there are noquick answers. Meditating on your dreams can help, as can reading available dreaminterpretation books, though the “quick dream interpretation cook-books” are oflittle value. A relevant comment to make here is that while dreams use symbolswhich may have common meanings many of the images will only mean somethingto you and hence you are the key to their understanding. So for example, while asnake may have a more general phallic interpretation or may even mean wisdom, ifyou were bitten by a snake as a child it is more likely to have a personal connection,rather than the more generalised interpretation.Some Diary techniquesSome Diary techniquesThere are many techniques for using your diary in a creative way. A couple we willcover here are Elemental Self Analysis and Identity work. For Elemental SelfAnalysis take four pages in your dairy and mark them with the titles of the fourelements. Each day for one month sit down and consider your personality, bebrutally honest with yourself. List your various personality traits and list them underthe element you think they should be related to. For example, enthusiasm may berelated to fire, and over-emotionalism to water. Even when you feel there is no moreto write keep going, consider all major and minor aspects of yourself, good and bad,known and secret and classify them. At the end of the month make some master lists"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 148of what you have found, consider the following questions...Under what element are most of my personality traits ?Under what element are most of my negative traits ?Under what element are most of my positive traits ?After you have done this ask some of your friends (ones you can trust) whatpersonality traits they find notable about you, both good and bad. Add these to yourlists, but in red. Ask yourself the above questions again and compare what otherperceive about you and what you perceive about yourself.When you feel you have learnt enough about yourself date the exercise and return toyour normal spiritual practises. It is sometimes useful to repeat this again at twelvemonths intervals comparing the results.Another useful diary exercise is to make a number of pages with the followingheading -What do I want to be ?What do I want to change ?What do I want to develop ?Over a period of a month write on these pages your answers to each question. Donot read over what you have written the day before, just keep writing your answersand perceptions. At the end of the month read over your lists, cross out repetitionsand classify what you find. Prepare summary lists, and phrase the answers intoaffirmations. For example, “I would like to read more” could be turned into “I willread more”. These affirmations can now be added into your morning meditationsand should be integrated into your daily goal program. If you decide you shouldread more, then you should write a note in your schedule so that everyday you set"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 149aside more time for reading. These are just a few ideas about how you can use yourdiary, there are lots more possibilities and many books available outlining exer-cises and techniques. Read them and develop your own techniques which suit youpersonal temperament and experience.RelaxationRelaxationThere is a lot of baloney said about relaxation today. It seems everybody isconvinced that stress is their enemy and that we must all relax more. The problemis that the more we relax the less we get done. Stress is a motivator and has avaluable role in everyday life. Relaxation is useful, in its place, and I certainlysuggest the budding Gnostic learn the various techniques of relaxation. Again,there are lots of books on relaxation (too many !) and, hence, you don’t need adetailed study here. What I would suggest is that rather than reading aboutrelaxation or buying one of those “new age” relaxation tapes, you create you ownmethods of relaxation. We can divide ways to relax into two different forms,Muscular Relaxation and Auto Suggestion. Muscular Relaxation is based ontensing the various muscles in the body, feeling and noting the stress and thenrelaxing it. This conscious process of tension, hold, relaxation works well. AutoSuggestion is another way to do things. In this technique you visualise things thatmake your relax - fields, forests, countryside. You may also visualise images thathave a particular relaxing effect such as spirals, clouds and water. The besttechnique is a personal combination of both of these methods, a simple relaxationmethod may be like the one below.ÅFind a nice place to lie down, turn off the phone and any noisy appliances,make sure you won’t be disturbed, unplug the phone.ÇPut on some nice music, something that is calming and something you like.Close your eyes, keep your eyes closed during the technique.ÉStart by noting the amount of tension in your body. Tense every muscle youcan, all at once, feel the tension. Hold it until it becomes a little uncomfortable,then relax the muscles with a big out-breath.ÑStart working through the muscles in the body, concentrate on each separateset of muscles. For example, tense the right leg, hold the tension, notice the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 150tension, relax the muscle. As you relax each muscle give an out-breath. Somepeople like to add an affirmation here, such as “It feels good to be relaxed”, otherpeople feel stupid doing this, it is up to you.ÖAfter your have worked through all the muscles of the body shake yourself andmake sure you are relaxed. If there is any tension left go back to that area and do thetechnique again.ÜSense the relaxation of the muscles, and make yourself comfortable where youare sitting. Notice the blackness before your closed eyes, visualise a spiral in frontof you. See it spinning, sense yourself falling into the spiral and falling deeper anddeeper into the depths of the relaxed state. You can add some colour to the spiral ifyou like, blues and greens are normally particularly relaxing.áAs you feel yourself becoming more relaxed, visualise a time in your pastwhere you were very relaxed. If you cannot remember such a time, choose alocation where you would be very relaxed, perhaps a countryside or forest location.Sense the feeling of relaxation. Encourage your experience of the scene, noticecolours, smells, sense the wind.àAs your are feeling more and more relaxed notice more things about yourscene, perhaps you are lying on the grass, then sense the touch of the grass, feelyourself sinking into it. Notice the sky, watch the clouds floating by, notice how big,white and fluffy they are.âIf you feel you are now relaxed enough by now then again see the spiral andsay to yourself, as “I count from ten to one I will become totally relaxed”, thencount yourself down. Ten, more relaxed, nine, relaxing etc., between each numberand the next affirm you are relaxing.äWhen you are fully relaxed you can either just enjoy it, probably a good ideafor the first few time or undertake some spiritual work. Affirmations are useful here,for example, you may wish to repeat some of the “things I want to develop” fromour early exercise.Affirmations should be in a positive frame where possible (I wish to be healthyand slim not I wish to lose weight) and given in short phases.ÄTo awaken, slowly move the body and bring awareness back to the muscles,sit up. Turn off the music, turn on the phone and return."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 151In the above technique we used a range of visualisations, these are an important partof Gnostic practise and we need to consider their value and use.Pranayama and RelaxationPranayama and RelaxationAs an adjunct to relaxation, Pranayama (or Breath control) is a useful art to master.Since the breath is saturated with psychic energy techniques which control and use,the breath can prove of value. A simple Pranayama technique which combines wellwith meditation is called “breath watching”. This is a simple meditation where youbreathe rhythmically in a four - four - four pattern - breath in for four, hold for fourand breathe out for four. At the same time keep your concentration on your breath,ignore any thoughts, as they arrive let them float away, if your attention wanders,bring it back to your breath. This is a simple technique, but valuable in the earlystages of learning to relax and meditate. As you become more proficient, you cancombine this with visualisations, see clear pure blue energy coming in with the inbreath and dirty blue exiting with the out-breath. There is no limit to the variations.The Art of VisualisationThe Art of VisualisationEveryone has in their minds a screen that can be understood to be something like acinema or television screen. On this screen appears images and pictures ofeverything we see in everyday life. We don’t see these images as they go too fast,however, if you sit quietly and consider something that has recently occurred youcan replay the scene. You will notice that not only can you witness the scene, butyou can also, sometimes, hear what is being said, smell, taste even touch what isoccurring. These perceptions vary greatly from person to person, some people onlyhear, some only see, but through practise we can experience all senses related tothese events. The screen in the mind is really an interface to a number of differentsystems, it serves as the recording mechanism from which data is then relayed tovarious memory banks to be recorded. The conscious mind does the recording, theunconscious does the storing. In the unconscious mind there are various libraries inwhich everything that goes across the screen is stored. In practical terms these canbe divided into two forms - Standard Memories and Engrams. Standard Memoriesare those which have no destructive emotional content, while Engrams are events"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 152which are charged with negative emotions. This is a simplistic definition, but willserve us for now.The screen is the interface through which we can explore the mind, it is timeless,and can be used to travel along the “timeline” which is created by our memories andexperiences. Through visualisation we can influence what is projected on the screenand by extension explore and change both Standard Memories and Engrams. Theart of visualisation involves three processes..ÅThe ability to see clearly the images and pictures on the mind screen, and beable to hold these images for a specified period of time.ÇThe ability to explore the various sense perceptions of images on the screenincluding sight, touch, smell, taste etc.ÉThe ability to program images that appear on the mind screen so that data canbe transferred to the unconscious and the ability to retrieve data from the uncon-scious and explore it on the mind screen.It is important at this stage to state that all people visualise. Some people see betterthan others, some people experience different senses to others, but all people insome way or another visualise. It is important for the Gnostic to refine theirvisualisation skills, because it is through this mind screen that advanced proceduresof Psychogenesis are enacted. It is through this mind screen that the unconsciouscan be explored, Engrams reprocessed and programs implanted. The first step toimproving visualisation is through a range of simple visualisation techniques, manyof these are deceptively simple at first examination, but will take some time tomaster."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 153Some Simple Visualisation TechniquesSome Simple Visualisation TechniquesKim’s GameKim’s GameThis is a simple method of memory training which relies heavily on visualisationskills. It is useful as it trains both the memory and visualising abilities. On a trayplace ten objects, stare at them for around thirty seconds, then cover the tray.Attempt to remember what the objects were, write down your answers and thenconfirm them against the objects on the tray.As your experiment with this technique, vary the objects, the number of objects andthe time you have to see them and remember them. As you become more proficientstart experimenting with remembering more about the objects. What colour arethey, what shape are they, create descriptions of each etc.Heightened AwarenessHeightened AwarenessChoose an object to examine. A piece of fruit is a good choice to start. Stare at theobject, notice everything you can about it - colour, size, texture, shadows etc. Thenclose your eyes and attempt to recreate the image on the minds screen. Practise thisuntil the object becomes as clear as the real thing, check the visualise image againstthe original object, note any variations - correct them. As you become proficient, goon to more complex objects, then perhaps try people and buildings....Retracing your stepsRetracing your stepsPlay back an event that occurred earlier during the day. Perhaps an event such asgoing to the store. On your minds screen replay the journey, notice everything youcan about the trip, replay the conversations that occurred, remember every detailyou can. Do this exercise again but choose an event that is often repeated, likegoing to work. Replay the journey each night until you get it totally clear, focus onthe visuals first, then expand the focus to sounds, senses etc. Get the image as clearas possible."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 154Archetypal ExplorationsArchetypal ExplorationsSymbols have meaning. These meanings can vary from the personal to the collectiveunconscious and beyond. Jung believed that many symbols were part of anarchetypal language through which varying levels of the unconscious communi-cated. On a personal level these symbols can be relevant in exploring Engrams andmemories, on deeper levels these symbols can represent levels of personal andinterpersonal spiritual power. When examining a symbol it is important to considerthe various levels on which it can operate. Take for example, the snake; it can havesignificance on varying levels of the unconscious. It can represent a symbol of thephallus, a symbol of personal power, then on deeper levels, it can mean evil (withina Judeo-Christian symbol system) or wisdom (in Eastern and Gnostic systems). Ascan be readily appreciated, a symbol can represent opposing things, depending onthe facet of the unconscious. The snake will mean different things depending onwhether it seen from the perspective of Eggregore (artificial group mind) or anArchetype (group soul). Through visualisation, symbols can be doorways to greatreserves of power, through them you can explore Eggregores and Archetypes. Thefirst step in this process is to do some background reading, study the works ofSigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and gain a good working knowledge of the theoriesregarding dream interpretation, the nature of symbols and in the case of Jung - theCollective Unconscious and Archetypes. Then start experimenting with varioussymbols, consider such images as the Pentagram, Hexagram, Elemental symbols,even religious images and icons. Explore These on various levels, first intellectu-ally, look at your own reactions to the symbol, other people’s reactions, traditionalattitudes etc. Then project it onto your mind screen, see it, move around it, spin itaround, explore it. Then, turn it into a doorway, and go through it. There is a wholeworld waiting within symbols and images.Meditation and ConcentrationMeditation and ConcentrationTo start our consideration of meditation and concentration, it would probably helpif we offered a definition of both terms. Meditation is the art of going within and, byextension, learning to control the mind. Concentration is the art of holding onto andsustaining attention. Both are valuable tools in Gnostic practise."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 155Meditation causes the mind to erupt, it becomes like a wild storm, and only throughperseverance will it be possible (over a long period of time) to bring the mind undercontrol. The aim of meditation and concentration is to bring the mind under theunder the dominion of the True Self, it is a process full of difficulties and problems,and requires long term methodical practise to achieve.The average mind is like an ocean during a storm where thewaters are violently agitated, each gust of wind is a storm ofpassion or desire or of a duty that must be accomplished or onehundred and one other irritations or anxieties and detours of themind to which proper concentration is the cure.Guruni VarameiThere are many different forms of meditative and concentrative practise, we havefound three of these to be of particular value in Gnostic practise.ÅMeditative and Concentrative silence.ÇThe use of MantrasÉProgrammed meditation and concentration.Meditative and Concentrative SilenceMeditative and Concentrative SilenceThere is a sanctuary of holy quiet within you, a place whereGod reigns supreme. Here God thinks his thoughts throughyou, your mind is inspired with knowledge, your eyes areopened to a new vision; your eyes are attuned to the voice ofwisdom;your lips are sealed against idle words; your bodytemple is hallowed by the divine presence. The silence is the“pearl of great value” for when you are really silent before God- when your mind is cleared of personal desire and is ready,receptive, waiting, when your heart is hushed to all except thelove of God - then you are made God conscious.Unity School of Christianity."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 156The above thought, though written from the perspective of mystical Christianity,reflects the importance of inner silence as a method for communing with the Innerwill. In mystical religious traditions (such as the Quakers) this will is identified withGod or a given deity’s presence. For the Gnostic we appreciate that in silence wecontact both our inner selves and the divine.The use of silence as a form of meditation is simple. Place yourself in anenvironment that will not permit interruptions and sit in a position that is comfort-able and can be held for a period of time. It is probably better not to lie down, asthis tends to encourage sleeping rather than silence. Allow yourself to relax, perhapsundertake relaxation exercises. As you start to relax, the mind will start to react,random thoughts will start to stampede their way across your consciousness, imageswill cloud the mind screen. Instead of fighting or suppressing these experiences letthem flow past you and disappear. Try not and let them interrupt your mediation. Atfirst your attention will wander and you will have to bring you attention back to thesilence. Each time this occurs is called a break, traditionally there are five types ofbreaks.ÅÅPhysical.These sort of breaks are when the body reacts to the position it is in. The mostreliable way of dealing with this sort of break is through conditioning the body so itis used to such activities, Asana is a good idea.ÇÇThought.These sort of breaks are caused by the mind wandering. One of the most commonforms of thought breaks are when we go over arguments, problems and situationswhich have occurred in the past. (The “what if ?” is common here). The onlyremedy to this sort of break is perseverance.ÉÉDaydreams.The daydream break is particularly hard to control since it tends to have ended"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 157before you actually consciously realise it started ! Again perseverance is the answer.ÑÑAberration of Control. This sort of break is a very insidious form. It takes place when you start thinkingabout how well you are doing and experience a state of satisfaction with the stateyou have reached. This false form of achievement is yet another break, the solution? Keep on meditating.ÖÖThe Result Itself.This is when the break is a form of Cosmic Consciousness. This is the state whenthe True Self is able to communicate unimpeded through the trained psyche.The Use of MantrasThe Use of MantrasOne of the greatest tools in meditation is the Mantra. The term Mantra is Sanskrit,and literally means “that which liberates the mind”. In common usage it designatesa certain word or phase continually repeated that brings about an altered state ofawareness. The first effect of a Mantra is usually the opposite to what is expected,it is akin to the sting of a scorpion, the mind reacts by developing crazy thoughts,wandering images and even headaches and mysterious emotions. If you perseverehowever, these mysterious symptoms will vanish as quickly as they came, the mindwill relax and the journey itself will begin. You will still have many difficulties(breaks just like those above will occur), but generally Mantra meditation is aneasier path than Silence. There are different perspectives on the choice of a Mantra,some schools prefer the Mantras to have no meaning whatsoever, other suggest itshould be a term which is loaded with religious meaning. Even many of the prayersused in Christian mysticism have in some sense become Mantras. There are manygood books discussing Mantra meditation, and we suggest you study these andchoose a Mantra which suits you. It is important that you feel comfortable with theMantra, and can easily pronounce it and repeat it. When you start with a Mantra itis not wise to change midstream. Some common Mantras include the ever famousHare Krishna, AUM, IAO and Aum Mani Padme Hum."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 158Programmed Meditation and ConcentrationProgrammed Meditation and ConcentrationThis form of meditation uses a combination of relaxation techniques, visualisationand Pranayama. It is the process where the mind is taken into a relaxed statethrough any variation of techniques. As you go further into relaxation, visualisationis used to deepen the state in conjunction with breath techniques. When you are inthe deepest possible state of relaxation, then you can begin your spiritual work.Instead of creating a relaxing environment alone, you can explore symbols; wholeworlds or dimensions. For example, after you have visualised your countryside, thensee a symbol cut into a stone wall, walk through it and explore. A useful experimentis to explore the images of the four elements and astrological signs and come to yourown understanding of each. .It is sometimes useful to have a tape recorder on andrecord what you experience, though talking while in a relaxed state can take somepractise.These are just some of the basic techniques of Psychogenesis. The Institute isworking on a number of manuals outlining the advanced processes of the Psycho-genesis approach. However, for the meantime, we will include various introductoryarticles and processes within the courses presently available.X"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 159DefinitionsDefinitionsCeremony.A formal act to emphasise a specific occasion.Ritual.A formal act to achieve a specific purpose.Ritual and ceremony are forms of intellectual decompression. They lower theresistance of the conscious mind and unconscious filters (Engrams), so that agateway can be formed within the ritual environment. This gateway can lead to theupper or lower facets of the human psyche, or to external dimensions and theirrelated hierarchies and denizens. It is important to realise that ritual can work inboth a subjective and objective manner, and has a valued place in both psychologi-cal and transhuman occult activity. The mechanism of ceremony and ritual is in itsability to limit the interference of the mind and earth Eggregores, so that contactwith the desired forces can be made. For the Gnostic, ritual allows the True Selftime to work unimpeded in the consciousness of the evolving soul (psyche). Ritualcan have many varied uses, it can be used to explore the unconscious or delve intoother dimensions of reality, it can be used to process psychological aggregates suchas Engrams or Archetypes and to contact Demons, Gods or Spirits. Ritual offers a“vehicle” for a temporary change of reality, a place where we may transform ourexperience of the world; and possibly even the world itself.There are three basic types of ritual and ceremony.ÅÅInstinctive Rituals.These types of ritual are best illustrated by animal behaviour. Animals behave incertain ways due to instinct, with little cognitive content. While much animal"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 160behaviour is learned, it is still a form of mimicry rather than conscious behaviouralchoices. A classic example of this is found in the canine submission rituals. Whenattacked, a dog will roll on its back exposing its stomach, by leaving itself open to itsattacker, clearly communicating his submission.ÇÇIntuitive Rituals.These are the rituals in our lives which take place spontaneously. A mundaneexample may be when we “jump for joy” or curl up in a foetal when depressed.While not consciously chosen these intuitive rites represent unconscious forms ofexpression. Another form of intuitive ritual is when we feel drawn to a certainpractise or meditation, but we don’t know why. Sometimes intuitive ritual offers away in which the Higher Self guides us to more formal practises.ÉÉProgrammed Rituals Programmed rituals are the ones we are most interested in. They involve formulatinga rite for a specific purpose and demand the disciplined use of both unconscious andexternal spiritual forces. A pre-requisite for the use of programmed ritual is athorough knowledge of your own spiritual, mental and physical disposition.The Purpose of Ritual and CeremonyThe Purpose of Ritual and CeremonyThere can be many reasons for the use of ritual and ceremony - some good, somebad. The use of ritual as a game or as entertainment is definitely out of the question.Rituals should not have guests, either the participants join in the working or they donot attend. Five good reasons for the use of ritual and ceremony are..ÅÅTo fix events in the unconscious. Particularly in ceremonial practise certain events in a given time frame are found tobe important. These may be individual events or religious festivals and dates.Through the correct use of ceremony these events can be linked into unconsciousArchetypes, so that at these times certain changes in consciousness result."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 161ÇÇTo rectify unconscious forces.Since symbols are the language of the unconscious, it is possible to rectify the fallenand distorted aspects of the unconscious through ritual practise. While manyGnostics prefer a more psychological approach (such as Psychogenesis), the ritualmethods should be not ignored. They are extremely efficient as well as potent.Engrams can be evoked and re-integrated (or banished), Archetypes can be evokedand internal and external forces can be used to stimulate the transformation of theGnostic.ÉÉExploration and Discipline.Since an important of Transfiguration is the transformation of the human psyche andits reconditioning into a useful Scribe and Adept. Ritual and ceremony can have animportant role to play in self exploration and discipline. The power of the untrainedmind cannot be overestimated, and hence, ritual exploration can help us faceaspects of ourselves we would rather ignore.ÑÑInducing altered states.A major part of ritual practise is inducing altered states of consciousness. Ritualforms a safe and structured method through which altered states may be achieved,integrated and balanced.ÖÖTrans-human communication.Ritual and ceremony is not all in the mind. Correctly performed ritual can be usedas a means to open communication with forces beyond the human condition. Theseforces were traditionally seen as Demons and Gods (Archons and Aeons),whatever their classification this sort of working must be handled with care.The Basic Elements of Ritual and CeremonyThe Basic Elements of Ritual and CeremonyGestures and MovementsGestures and MovementsIn every ritual and ceremony gesture and movement is of great importance and sig-nificance. In Vedic practise, for example, every hand gesture (or Mudra) embodies"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 162a certain force or energy. Even dance can be used for evocation. In Siva’s CosmicDance there are 108 poses which embody his nature and invoke the inherent powerinvolved. In individual ritual practise gestures are develop which reflect certain en-ergies, powers and states of mind. This is not as strange as it first seems. In recentresearch into the nature of the mind, the founders of Neuro-Linguistic Programmingfound that it is possible to associate certain emotions with hand gestures and move-ments. A bit like the work of Pavlov (the dog salivates when he hears the bell, be-cause the bell is associated with food), but going much further. The founders ofNLP found how easy it was to lock emotions into certain gestures. This, surely, isthe basis for the age old use of Mudra (hand movement) and gestures in occultpractise. There are many ancient traditions that use such methods of gesture andmovement including; Asana and Mudra in Yoga, Runic postures and the hand let-ters of the Israelite priesthood.Dress and Ritual MaterialsDress and Ritual MaterialsThe clothing of the ritualist can vary according to rite and to tradition. It can be veryelaborate such as the ritual clothes worn in the Temple of Solomon or even nothingat all such as in the Skyclad (naked) tradition of some schools of natural ritualismand Wicca. In Gnostic ritualism a white robe is normally worn by the Psychic and ablack robe by the Pneumatic. In some rites a smaller over-robe is sometimes worn.It varies in colour depending on the ritual. Other materials can include altar pieces,hangings and banners of the four elements. All of these help impress the mind thatthis is a special occasion, and that symbols need to be processed in a differentmanner. Robes are important for they disassociate the wearer from everydaysituations and focus on the special nature of the ritual.ToolsToolsThere is much debate about what tools are needed for ritual practise. Again, thesecan vary greatly from tradition to tradition and also depend on the nature of the rite.In the more formal school of Western Ceremonial Magic, there are four tools.These four tools are related to the four elements with the fifth, or spirit, being theGnostic himself."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 163The Wand.Fire.The Wand is used as an extension of the will or intent of the Gnostic.

It is used to earth the pow-ers that are invoked, at times it is exchanged for a bowl of salt and water.There are many other accessories which can be used in ritual practise, in some senseit is up to you to decide what tools you want to use, and how to use them.Incense.Incense purifies the air and sets the mood. It can also be used for the manifestationof spiritual forces and projection of images.Candles.Candles are traditionally used to give light, they may be a bit of a nuisance, but theyhave far more appeal than electric lighting. They give a minimum of light, and can bevaried in colour depending on the ritual."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 164Bells.Used to mark the commencement and completion of a rite.Ritual StructureRitual StructureThere are many different procedures for rituals and ceremonies, some use Liturgyand high religious language, others use more physical and direct methods. In allrituals, regardless of form, certain characteristics can be noted that are the corestructure within any given rite.LocationLocationThe location is an important part of the rite. A location should be chosen which isprivate and accessible only by those to whom the rite is addressed. Prior to thisstage a decision should have been made about who can attend the rites, require-ments for attendance and the level of privacy required for the rites. These require-ments should be used to make a decision about the location.Preparation and EtiquettePreparation and EtiquetteAll participants should be aware of the requirements of the ritual. It is important thatspecial requirements be honoured. Some standard preparations for any ritual shouldinclude no drugs or alcohol within 12 hours of the ritual, meditative preparation,showering and cleanliness and a state of mental preparation. All participants shouldbe aware of ritual etiquette including what to do if they need to leave the definedritual space.TimingTimingAll participants must arrive 15-30 minutes be the rite. No late arrivals should beallowed. All participants should know what they are required to wear."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 165SettingSettingPreparing the space is the next stage of the ritual. Participants should enter silentlyand be in their positions. Individual meditation should be undertaken. Incense andmusic should be used to set the mood.Cleansing and ContainmentCleansing and ContainmentTraditional methods include a banishment which can be used to clear the area ofany unwanted energies, there are many different rites ranging from the LesserBanishing Ritual of the Golden Dawn to simple visualisations. After this is done, asacred space should be created to contain the energy. This can range from creatinga spiritual temple to drawing a circle with the sword. It is important that this is donecorrectly and strong visualisations used. It is no use using elaborate incantations ifthe visualisations do not match in intensity.DedicationDedicationWhen the sacred space has been created, dedications should be offered. These caninclude invocations of the four elements, prayer, meditations or whatever isrequired. The important thing is that the space is focused on the working you areundertaking.AccelerationAccelerationSome sort of ritual activity should be used to bind the participants together andaccelerate the altered state of consciousness. Chanting, dance, music, poetry - all ofthese can prove of value.WorkingWorkingThis is the space when the participates are ready and the actual working isundertaken. This should be the climax of the process and should not be started untilthe energies are right."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 166IntegrationIntegrationAfter the working is completed some time should be left for the participants tointegrate what they have experienced.Final Cleansing and ContainmentFinal Cleansing and ContainmentThe ritual should be formally closed, a further banishing undertaken and all energieseither returned to their sources or set off to carry out their appointed task.Scale DownScale DownTime should be left for participants to relax and work down after the rite before theyare sent off home.Creating a RitualCreating a RitualThe above gives you some idea of what a ritual is made of, but how would youactually create a ritual ? Let’s take a case study. Let us say that John Smith feels heis ineffectual, he is unable to be firm with those around him, and lacks drive andambition. He decides he wants to confront this fear and give himself some direction,he decides therefore to perform a ritual focused on Geburah in Yetzirah. He haschosen Geburah as it represents Mars - the force of action and has chosen Yetzirahas it represents the world of the unconscious.He starts to collect background information on Mars. He started by examining basicbooks of Kabbalistic lore. Some of these include 777 and other Qabalistic writingsof Aleister Crowley (Samuel Weiser, various editions), Sepher Sephiroth, Godwin’sCabalistic Encyclopaedia (Llewellyn) and the Magicians Companion, Bill Whit-comb (Llewellyn 1993). He finds the following correspondences of interest.Geburah is attributed to Mars. It is related to the four Fives in the Tarot - Wands,Cups, Swords and Discs. The Yetzirah card is Five of Swords.It is connected to four other centres on the Tree of Life:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 167Binah, Tiphareth, Chesed and Hod.These are attributed to the following Tarot Trumps:Geburah- Binah: Chariot.Geburah -Chesed: Lust.Geburah - Tiphareth: Justice or Adjustment.Geburah- Hod: Hanged Man.Geburah is also related to the following correspondences.Egyptian God: Horus and NepthysColours: (Emperor Scale of Colour) Bright Scarlet.Greek: Thor, Aries and Hades.Stone: RubyPlants: Nettle, Oak.Perfume: Tobacco.Believe it or not, here he has all the information required to create his ritual. On theAltar will be the Five of Swords, the major working will be to travel through thiscard and come back with a sense of power. He will place the Tarot Trumps of therelated four centres in each Elemental corner. He will wear a black robe with abright scarlet overlay. He will burn tobacco and perhaps some nettle as his incense.He will play martial music (Mars from Holst’s Planets is effective) and use redthroughout the Temple scheme.He will research and find some prayers and invocations to Mars in the variousmythologies. After his primary working he will re-orient himself to each quarter andvisualise each Tarot trump as related to inner strength. The Chariot as self control,Lust as strength, Justice as honour and the Hanged man as finding the strength andpower within him."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 168There are the rudimentaries of his rite, he will chose a banishing and Elementalinvocation, perhaps with martial overtones and chose a location where he will notbe disturbed and somewhere he can be as loud and strong as he likes without theneighbours complaining !!ConclusionsConclusionsRitual and Ceremony forms an integral part of Gnostic practise. It is not an easything to get used to. It is, in some sense, irrational - and that is why it works. Itsilences the mind, and allows us to explore the realms both within and beyond thepsyche. There is a certain art to ritual and first attempts may seem clumsy.However, sincerity and meaning are far more important than polish. We have seentechnically perfect rituals with absolutely no power ! The best way to start workingwith ritual is to explore the Kabbalah and related correspondences, and startcreating rituals of your own. By far the best rituals are those made by you for you.X"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 169Thoughts have power ! They are a form of energy which can effect ourselves and theworld around us. It is difficult to consider thoughts as “things”; we tend to think ofthem as images that fly across our minds eye, rather than as real objects. In everydaylife we are taught to believe that what we think has no substance - only action counts.However, if you replay a recent event on your mental screen, you can start to considerthe power of thought. Your memories, which are composed of thought, seems veryreal. You can explore the senses of the memory and, if you are not careful, fall into itand lose track of time. (daydreams are a good example of this). These memories seemto be more than just flickering images - they have related senses - smell, touch, tasteand sound. There have been many psychic investigations of the nature of thoughtranging from the charismatic Charles Leadbeater to Kirlian photography. Whileinterpretations may vary, all agree that thoughts have power and form, and have farmore influence than we credit.The Characteristics of ThoughtsThe Characteristics of ThoughtsThoughts exist on multiple planes. They are emanated from the mental plane, and thentake form on the astral worlds. Since many thoughts involve emotions, various levelsof existence are moulded together to create the “form” of a given thought. Thoughtsexist primarily in two ways; as a vibration, and as a form. The thought itself exists asa vibration or resonance in the mental body. If the thought was a simple, pureconceptualisation, then it would only exist in this form. However, most thoughts aremixtures of varying vibrations, and hence, exist on multiple planes between thephysical and the mental. As the thought reaches the astral realms it triggers anassociated emotional response and this combination of vibration and response createsthe form. A trained clairvoyant would experience the vibration as a wave in the mentalplane, but see the form of the thought as a three dimensional reality in the astral. Thebest way to understand these forms is to appreciate their nature."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 170Thought formsThought formsWhen a thought form is created on the astral it can take many different shapes andstructures. There are normally three classifications of these forms:ÅForms which reflect the maker.ÇForms which reflect an object.ÉForms which have their own inner form.The first form is found when we think about themselves. They have both a positiveand negative influence. If we constantly think of ourselves in a way different to howwe are, we create a tension between the created form and our reality. This can beuseful if a change is needed, but disastrous if we are not prepared for the result. (Anexample here is why an Anorexic always sees him/herself as fat. The thought formis fat, the reality is not, and a tension is created).The second form includes a myriad different characteristics. Thoughtforms is thisclass can be images of any physical reality or even of mechanical and fantasydesign. For example, you may create a thought form with hundreds of arms andlegs, or as a unicorn or giant. Any shape than can be thought can be summoned intoa form.The third form is when a thought has taken a natural shape, because it has not beenhave given a form. These forms can range from swirling masses to shapes andspirals of immense beauty or darkness. Many examples of this form can be found inThoughtforms by Besant and Leadbeater (Theosophical Publishing House 1971).Each of these forms has one thing in common, they are made of colour. Dependingon the nature of the form, various colours will manifest. This is the one sure way toappreciate the real nature of a form, while colours can be manipulated by thought,the real vibratory nature of the thought (the real colour) will make itself known insome way.The general principles which are the basis for the production of Thoughtforms are:"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 171ÅThe quality of the thought determines colour.ÇThe nature of the thought determines its form. (Except in artificially createdThoughtforms).ÉThe strength of the thought determines the clarity of the form.Some considerations on the Nature ofSome considerations on the Nature ofThoughtThoughtThoughts (like any energy form) have a tendency towards entropy, they degradeover a period of time. It is necessary, therefore, when working with Thoughtformsto take this into account. For example, some schools divide Thoughtforms into threeclasses, each related to the time-frame they are programmed to operate in..Sustained Thoughtforms.Sustained Thoughtforms.These are usually designed for protective purposes. The best example is a personalor property Watcher. They need to be recharged at regular intervals.Periodic ThoughtformsPeriodic ThoughtformsThese are special Thoughtforms which are programmed to only exist for a pre-destined time period. A classic example here would be the Thoughtforms whichexist at any given religious festival or feast.Solo ThoughtformsSolo ThoughtformsThese exist to achieve one action only. They are programmed to achieve a certaintask or do a certain job.There are some amazing examples of the above classifications. For example, it isthought that the Ancient Egyptians used a sustained thoughform which took it’senergy from the forces around it in the tomb and sand and thus it could exist for animmense time period without degradation.Another interesting consideration, is at what stage a thought becomes an Eggregore.It has to be realised that all out thoughts are not our own. Memes, as special types"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 172of thought, can travel from mind to mind and make themselves feel at home. Theyseem like our own thoughts, but are not. This occurs because certain concepts andthoughts have either achieved one or two forms.1.1.Take on a life of their ownTake on a life of their ownThis occurs because there are so many people thinking on a similar concept that thethoughts coalesce and develop a discrete form of their own, separate from thosethinking them. This form then feedbacks and influences the individuals who thinkabout it, or thoughts related to it.2.2.Principalities and DominionsPrincipalities and DominionsThis is where the Eggregore or discrete thought has become a vehicle for a lowerastral force. This occurs often and is the way in which the Demiurge can influencehuman consciousness.Eggregores are accordingly, group thoughts, which have taken on a discreteidentity. Some are Demiurgic, others are simply semi-autonomous. Semi au-tonomous Eggregores self destruct if people stop concentrating about a given idea,over a period of time the energy degrades, and the idea or thought is forgotten.Demiurgic or Archonic Eggregores are sustained by the fallen field and cancontinue forever.By the way, if you doubt the power of a group thought look at what occurs in apolitical rally or even a football riot.How to Create and Program a ThoughtformHow to Create and Program a ThoughtformA successful Thoughtform is one which has been given existence on the mental andastral planes by clear, precise creation and programming. It may also require a greatdeal of sustainment, depending on your time-frame programming.ÅStart with a clear idea of what Thoughtform you wish to create, and what itshould achieve. Write down your idea, contemplate it, and make it precise. Oncethis idea has been decided on, do not change it.

But lets not lose our heads about it.The first and foremost thing to learn about evil is that itgenerally exists only in your own alarmed imagination.Don’t be afraid of Black Magick.Robert Anton Wilson in Gnostica Feb-March 1977.The above quote is a great place to start when talking about psychic self defence.Too many people today are just plain paranoid and this is not, I repeat, not the stateto start contemplating psychic self defence from. It is all too easy to stand in theposition of being so self righteous, that we attribute psychic attack to all those whodisagree with us. This in itself can be a form of psychic attack, it is known as a“Belief Attack,” and occurs when we project so much paranoia and fear, that itreturns to haunt us. The more we fight it, the stronger it gets.It is important to be objective before you start attributing certain experiences topsychic attack. The first stage of critical examination should involve examining yourown mental and emotional state, and that of those around you. If, after some thought,you still feel something is wrong then, and only then, should you begin to consider"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 176that you might be under psychic attack. With these clarifications in mind, it is truethat psychic attack is more prevalent than we think. Traditional primitive systems ofmagic believed all diseases were a form of psychic attack. Now while we may notaccept this today, certainly disease of sudden and unexpected manifestation,uncontrollable headaches, nightmares, loss of “luck” and other maladies may havea psychic origin. These things, in themselves, do not mean you are under attack,however, in combination, and in the right situation, they are perhaps indicative.The Law of AssociationThe Law of AssociationThe simplest explanation for how psychic attacks work is found in what is knownas the law of association. The most erudite definition of this is found in Real Magicby Bonewits, where he states that “ if any two or more patterns have elements incommon, these patterns interact through these elements, and control of one patternfacilities control over the other(s), depending, among other facts, on the number ofcommon elements involved”. In more simple terms, if two or more people are incontact (or have been in contact) an “astral link” exists between them. This linkmay be used by either party to influence the other. It is also possible to create anastral link through the use of objects which have, in the past, been in contact withthe other party - some common examples would include hair, nails and clothing.The Law of Association gives us a basic idea of how a psychic attack may be ac-complished, however, things are never as simple as they seem. There are four dis-tinct forms of psychic attack.Psychic StaticPsychic StaticThis form of attack could probably be better understood as unconscious thoughtprojection. It usually originates from someone you have known for quite a while,and is more intense when this person is under stress. Many cases of poltergeist ac-tivity can be attributed to psychic static, and can be traced to a teenager with emo-tional problems. In cases of Psychic Static, the originator usually has no knowledgeof what is happening, the force is being projected unconsciously along the primaryastral threads or links the unknowing perpetrator possesses. This form of attackmost commonly causes headaches and minor mental disturbances, while in ex-treme cases poltergeist activity and sympathetic emotional reactions (includingpain) have been noted."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 177Psychic DrainingPsychic DrainingThis sort of psychic attack happens when you open to too many people. The resultof such unreserved openness is a feeling of exhaustion and loss of energy. Thisform of psychic attack occurs regularly, far more than we care to admit. There aremore emotional and psychic “vampires” than we ever realise. These are profes-sional victims, those who demand our constant emotional attention and assistance.Certainly, there are also deliberate psychic vampires (Gurus and cult leaders aregood examples) but these are few and far between. Far more prevalent is the pro-fessional victim, who whines for assistance, affection and help, thus draining youof every ounce of energy you have.Psychic AttackPsychic AttackFull frontal psychic attack is very unusual, but does occur. It is usually by someoneyou know or have at least, had some contact with. Psychic attack by someone un-known to you is unusual, but possible (as long as they have something which con-nects you to them). Full frontal psychic attack can range from the simple nuisanceattack, to curses - which can bring about disease and death.Psychic AtmospheresPsychic AtmospheresPsychic atmospheres come in two forms. The first is the classic haunted house orlocation. When you enter these locations or environments you are linked to them.Usually this attack is impersonal, that is to say, you have no personal connection tothe situation, but this is not always the case. While this category borders on haunt-ing and is not always considered a psychic attack, if you are living in a hauntedhouse and find it is becoming a nuisance then this may be the explanation.The second is what can be best described as Systematic Attack, to fully appreciatethis we need to consider it in some detail.Living in a World Possessed !Living in a World Possessed !I have deliberately chosen an extravagant paragraph heading, as it is important toconsider how alien the Gnostic really is to the fallen world.

When Jesus said you should expect persecution, he was not joking ! When youstart to be reborn, your energy is like a beacon, a flashing light warning the fallensystem, the Archons, Memes, demons and fallen angels to take a special interest. Iam not suggesting you should always be looking over your shoulder, paranoia doesnot help in spiritual transformation, however, you must be aware that you are now astranger in a war torn land and the earth is no longer your home. There are manyskills you need to develop to deal with this, some as outlined below, are psychic andoccult in nature, others are more psychological. Both have their place.Since the physical world is a fallen kingdom, the Demiurge has dominion over it. Inthe New Testament when St.Paul says “Satan is the God of this world”, he isspeaking literally. It is therefore of no use to expect justice, equality and perfectionin our daily lives. While we must fight against injustice and hatred there is a limit -the baseline must be, does it interfere with my spiritual life ? It is of no valuespending your whole life fighting “city hall”, and losing your soul. Within the fallenworld there are many “little tyrants”, meaningless individuals who believe that byclimbing to the top of their little dunghill they have made it. They will fight to thedeath to get to the top, and then fight to the death to stay there. It is self defeatingfor the Gnostic to constantly do battle with these “Gods in their own mind” typepeople. You could spend every day of your life fighting with them and still therewould be more. It is important for the Gnostic to be brutally realistic withthemselves. Too often we fight against some injustice not because it is really thatunjust, but because our ego hurts. The bottom line is that we do not wish to loseface. In many cases the actual loss incurred by simply ignoring a petty tyrant is farless than the time and effort that would be lost in the battle that would result if youchallenged them. There is a difficulty here, we must then control the ego, we mustbe prepared to backdown, to lose face in the eyes of the world. This is a mostdifficult thing. There is a time for battle and bloodshed and a time for retreat. Thereis a time to “go quietly on the earth”, and another to “rage against the night”. TheGnostic must be able to decide what strategy to use in which situation. It is no value"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 179spending your life fighting against the world - judgement has already been passed,the earth is dead. Your task is to transform, to be Transfigured - not to try and saveeverybody else. As part of this strategy the Gnostic needs to learn to keep his owncounsel, to keep separate from the world. Avoid meaningless acquaintances andfriends, cultivate only those who share, (or at the very least) have a strongsympathy in your belief system. The less “psychic links” you have, the less you areopen for them to be abused. Be cunning - use your mind as well as your psychicskills.Techniques of Psychic Self DefenceTechniques of Psychic Self DefenceCutting the CordCutting the CordThere are many simple techniques for dealing with unwanted connections or links,both ritual and psychic. A very simple technique uses a chair (or a partner) andsome string or cord. You enter a meditative state and visualise the person withwhom you have an astral link sitting in the chair in front of you, a cord or piece ofstring can be run from yourself to the chair (or partner). Spend some timecontemplating the nature of the link you have with this person, consider theemotions involved, go over times when you meet them, try and make the link as realas possible. If you are working with a ritual partner get them to “role play” the otherperson - make the experiences as real as possible. If you wish to combinetechnology with the experience, use photographs, videos or tape recordings of theperson. After a period of time you should begin to sense the link, as you sense thelink becoming stronger, focus the link on the cord. (The cord should be tied firmlyto the chair or held firm by your partner). Sense all your connection entering to thecord.After you feel your whole relationship in this cord, use a ritual dagger (or a pair ofscissors if you prefer) to cut the cord. As the cord is cut state firmly that the con-nection to this person is severed. Visualise the psychic connection, that glisteningwhite line of light, being severed between you and them forever.A variation of this technique is to visualise the cord and see it as representing allunwanted connections, name it “acquaintances and business partners”, “distantfamily members” and disconnect accordingly."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 180The DomeThe DomeThis is a simple visualisation technique which can be used to create a protectivepsychic environment. Imagine a dome, a bit like an inverted test-tube. It shouldsurround what you need to protect - yourself, your home, whatever. Try andexperience what the dome you have visualised is like, notice its colour, textures,smell - everything you can. Interact with the dome - using your imagination tell itwhat you want it to be. It should be weightless and unintrusive. It should repelforces which are not sympathetic to your environment, but otherwise not have anyother task. If it is surrounding you, notice it moving when you move. Make sure you(and the Dome) are clear about what has to be accomplished. If you feel you areunder regular psychic attack, then visualise the outside of the Dome as a reflective,shiny surface, bouncing back any destructive forces.Remember to check the Dome often and recharge it !The BellThe BellVisualise a bell between your hands. See it clearly and make yourself aware of allthe senses connected to it. Move the image to your Solar Plexus and sense itextending a field of energy to all parts of your Astral body.

Another variation to use is to visualise a laser which shoots down energieswhich are unsympathetic to your development. The adaptations are endless..FamiliarsFamiliarsA rather fun technique is to create your own Elementals. The way to do this is tovisualise the four elements and attribute to each of them a small creature. You mayuse a Salamander for fire, a frog for water, a bird for air and a mouse for earth It istotally up to you. You can even manifest creatures from fantasy or mythology. Youcan even name them.

You can create a division of labour, whereby each creatureresponds to different types of attacks in their own way. This is a very personalprocess, which is open to your own ingenuity. This is a useful method, as theGnostic will spend much time (and hence energy) bringing these creatures to lifeand hence they are highly effective. You can supplement this method by drawingyour creatures, making models and seeing them as some of your household pets.This was the basis of the charge that Witches kept Familiars, strange animals whichprotected their lives and property.

Since the earliest times man has been sinkingdeeper and deeper into the mire of matter. This view is not popular with thematerialists and exoteric priests of our culture, but is nevertheless a core esoterictruth. In his work “The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times”, ReneGuenon succinctly outlines the process of spiritual degeneration. As man thinks heis evolving, he is simply accelerating his own destruction - living standards andtechnology may advance, but only at the cost of spirit. This metaphysical entropycauses matter to become successively more physical, more solid, and on a spirituallevel - more malefic. Society becomes centred on collectives (witness the NewWorld Order), rather than on nations and individuals and there is an emphasis onscientific advances rather than simplicity. As we reach the later phases of thisdegeneration (the present period), anti-traditions and forms of anti-gnosis arisepurporting to be of spiritual value. The most dangerous facet of this process is how,in the darkest age, fissures will appear in the barrier between the physical world andthe lower astral planes, and there will be an intrusion of the malefic inhabitants ofthis inferior subtle domain. This process of degeneration is codified in the earlyVedic system by dividing history into four ages or Yugas. The Sanskrit names forthe four ages are Krita or Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga.These can also be correlated to the Greek historical tradition as the ages of Gold,Silver, Bronze and Iron. The Krita Yuga is the Golden Age, the age of Spirit andfrom there things get successively worse until the Kali age, which ends in anapocalypse of water and fire. Each age in succession is shorter than it predecessor,is more intense, and more material. The Kali age is the shortest, most materialist andintensely destructive. It is this age we are in now...."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 183The Cycle of the YugasThe Cycle of the YugasThe cycle of the Yugas within the Vedic canon of India are important, for they showthe overall state of the earth itself (with all related Lifestreams). Hence, the Yugascover millions and millions of years, and document the cycle of Earth's history itself.While in other books we will study the history of man prior to coming to earth (andthis later study is a fascinating one), this is way beyond the scope of this volume.However, just to give you a taste, it is possible that man's stay on earth is only onepart of a much greater cycle. In this scheme of things, man had evolved throughthree cosmic cycles before migrating to the earth sphere and the resulting fall. In theworks of Rudolf Steiner, these cycles were known as Saturn, Sun and Earth-Moon,and were related to major changes within the Solar System. These cycles wereinterrupted by the Cosmic Battle, which caused the earth sphere to fall out of theStatic Plane and enter into a fallen, physical existence. While a descent into thelower forms of the astral was part of the normal evolutionary scheme - matter wasnot. The path of Transfiguration returns man to the cosmic cycle, and carries himback to the Static Kingdom of Light. However, it is not the end of man’sdevelopment, by no means. In this grandiose plan, man would still have threefurther cycles to work through (there being seven Great cycles with seven lessercycles in each). This is perhaps only one phase of an even greater scheme.However, enough esoteric speculation ! The cycles of the Yugas as they apply tothe ages of earth (exoteric and esoteric) are important, for they show the state of theearth and its various Lifestreams. The Yugas show man’s degeneration, since theyare from the viewpoint of all of humanity. The four Yugas show the fall from theGolden Age, through to the most destructive age; that of Iron - this is also knownas the Kali Yuga or Age of the Wolf.The Great yearThe Great yearAt the same time as the Yugas are unfolding and man heads for destruction, theTreasury of light is working to offer man the Gnosis.

It is a strange and terrible contradiction that today there is more Gnosisthan ever before, and less people than ever wanting it.The Great Year is a cycle of approximately 26,000 years, it is also know as theprecession of the equinoxes. Because the earth wobbles on its axis it movesbackwards through the signs of the zodiac, a full cycle takes around 26,000 year. Ineach sign energy is radiated into earth consciousness, this radiation is mixed andincludes light and darkness, X and Y factors.In the modern Gnostic view these energy forms radiate from the “Throne of Ra”which is positioned in the centre of our system. This seat exists within the SolarLogos, and these energies emanates from within it. Accordingly, the four forceswhich radiate the planet from this centre are influenced by the astrological age thatthe earth is in. Even the fallen or Archonic forces are influenced by it, though theymanifest a destructive distortion of its formula. For the Gnostic to develop, he mustmaster the formulae of each age (either historically via reincarnation, or within alifetime using various spiritual means). Each period radiates an influence within thehistorical continuum, and brings man to consider his development. Whether thisconsideration is positive or negative depends on the evolution of the individual andthe world as a whole.Each of the ages has a specific formula, and a means of spiritual illumination. Forexample, the age of Pisces can be correlated with the imagery of Horus and is thetime which focuses on reconciliation of man with the Light worlds. However, justas powerful as the formula of Light, is the misuse of the Aeonic force by theArchons to create an unbalanced current. For example, in this same period, theapostate Christian churches (under the direction of Emperor Constantine) re-editedthe Bible and created a political force which has decayed western civilisation eversince.We can correlate the astrological ages with events within history quite easily. Wecan link the age of Aries with the early sacrificial religions, the Age of Pisces withthat of the revelation of Jesus (the imagery of the fish is certainly suggestive) andwe can then see the incoming current as that of Maat or Aquarius.

Is the Sphinx a mixture of feminine and lioncharacteristics ? This is an intriguing and challenging possibility.Heraldic CyclesHeraldic CyclesEvery astrological age lasts around 2150 years, these ages can again be sub-dividedinto 12 minor periods. The last minor period before the dawning of the next age isknown as the Equinox of the Gods or the Heraldic period. It was during this periodthat the priests of old prepared for the great change, modifying God-forms, ritualformulae and temple procedures to fulfil the characteristics of the new incomingsign. This preparatory period is 180 years in length and can be divided into 4 nexusdates and three periods of sixty years each.The present Heraldic Cycle, Equinox of the Gods or Remnant Age represents theexpansion and development of the Mysteries, and a final opportunity for transfor-mation and return to the kingdom of light. Further Gnosis is revealed and perfected,and the message of the Gnosis is heralded as we head into Aquarius and the nexusof the Kali Yuga. The start of this age is usually dated between 1844 and 1910, webelieve 1844 to be the accurate starting point. This is a complex period which,nearing the end of the cycle, involves massive conflicts between the powers of Lightand Darkness. It is also the period when the apostate (false) faiths of Judaism andChristianity (and other Counter Gnostic traditions) have taken hold of the culture atlarge and the Gnostic message only survive underground. The remnant period hasnexus dates at 1844, 1904, 1964 and 2004.And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pourout of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and yourdaughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see vi-sions, and your old men shall dream dreams.Acts 2:17Now it is fitting that the soul regenerate herself and becomeagain as she formerly was."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 186The Soul then moves of her own accord.And she received the divine nature from the Father for herrejuvenation, so that she might be restored to the place whereoriginally she had been.This is the way of the ascent to the Father.The Exegesis of the Soul.Nag Hammadi Library II 134:6-15.AquariusAquariusThe climax of this Heraldic period is the dawning of Aquarius between 2000 and2100. Aquarius is not love and light, its ruler is Saturn which is attributed to Binahon the Tree of Life. Traditional cosmology divided Saturn into two poles, one abovethe abyss and the other operating below. The lower Binah relates to Satan and theDemiurge and represents the destruction of the earth cycle. The higher Binahrepresents Saturn as the tester or purifier who refines the Gnostic until he is capableof passing through the abyss into the Pleroma. In any event, mankind will bedragged kicking and screaming into confrontation with his darkest fears.Return to the Yuga of Gold:Return to the Yuga of Gold:Rectification and RegenerationRectification and RegenerationThe climax of the Age of Aquarius will be the Millennium, the time of rectificationand regeneration. It is the dawning of Maat or Truth.It is the time when the cycle is completed and regeneration occurs. In lesser cyclesit is a time of renewal, in the great cycle it is the final Omega Point, when the systemis rectified and the fallen Dialectic system ceases to be.

As the Yugas unfoldand society advances technologically, and complexities increase, the esoteric faithis forgotten. At the same time, the Gnosis has been refined by generations of secretsects, cults and Ecclesias, working underground to offer man a chance to returnhome.

If we wish to consider the earliestrecorded forms of religion, then we need to consider the finds of archaeology. In themany digs which have occurred around the globe, the oldest finds have been offertility figures with exaggerated sexual organs and images which give evidence ofearly forms of star watching and astronomy. Since these earliest discoveries allseem to fall cleanly into one of two classes, then it is tempting to evaluate them inthe light of the Gnostic tradition. It is likely that the fertility symbols representedthe worship of earth, the desire to reproduce, the submission of mankind to thephysical, while the watching of the stars (the Sky cult) illustrates the earlydevelopment of the Gnostic desire to go beyond. This contradiction is important forit shows that even during the earliest periods, there was a dividing line - a dualitybetween those of the sky cult who knew, and those of the earth cult who were inignorance. For the Gnostic the earth cults and the worship of fertility represents theloss of individual immortality with the life or essence returning to the spirit of thefamily, the totems and ancestors with the result that all realisation is lost (at least forthat life time). The sky cult with its secret calculations, esoteric astrology andmegalithic structures represented the knowledge of the Light Worlds, a desire toreturn to whence we came and a rejection of the values of the fallen earth. Thesetwo contradictory forces can be seen throughout the history of the Gnosis.In many Gnostic schools there was a certain hierarchy, even a caste structure whichincluded both of these traditions. While on an esoteric level the Sky cult hadtranscendence as the focus, on an exoteric level, the earth cult and relatedreproductive characteristics was cultivated, if not encouraged. The “double doc-trine” of Plato is a superb example of how this hierarchy of truth could exist, whilethe esoteric tradition worked in isolation, the exoteric tradition was sustained for thesake of the community, even, at times, denying that the esoteric tradition existed"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 190except to those who were properly prepared. In some sense this is out of a sense ofpragmatism, while reproduction sustains the fallen system, it at least, fulfils the taskof giving bodies for souls to incarnate into and hence gain the possibility ofTransfiguration. In the Gnostic Apostolic Tradition these two cults are reconciled inthe Paths of the Dove and of the Serpent. Historically speaking, there are manyexamples of these cults as opposing traditions, as reconciled in esoteric brother-hoods, or as corrupted by the Demiurgic forces. It should be clearly stated that theearth cult can only be of value in connection with that of the Sky, pagan movements(ancient and modern) which worship the earth are simply sustaining the dominion ofthe Demiurge. As we head towards the Omega day the value of the earth cultbecomes less, anti-traditions and false earth cults take precedence, and reproductionand family becomes less and less justifiable. At the same time the need fortranscendence becomes paramount.EgyptEgyptWe are sorely in need of a truth or self understanding similar tothat of Ancient Egypt.Carl Jung.It is difficult to “put a pin on the map” for where the modern cycle of Gnosis began.We could theoretically go back to Atlantis, Mu and beyond, but then we arevoyaging into meta-history and speculation. It is generally accepted that Egypt wasthe point of origin, at least in the modern cycle. There has been much pioneeringwork done to show that Egypt was not some Middle eastern backwater, but was athriving cosmopolitan empire which had satellites around the world. It formed thenucleus in which much of the esoteric tradition developed. While much of the formof modern Kabbalah originated in Medieval Mysticism, Alchemy and Hermeticism,we can clearly see that the basic mythology and forms was Egyptian in origin.The recorded history of Egypt covers an immense period of time. Even the earliestforms of Egyptian civilisation - which concentrated on the stellar worship of the StarGoddess had a highly evolved structure and form. By the first Dynasty a wide rangeof esoteric and religious cults could be found, and a complex system of burial wasevolved to guide the deceased into the Treasury of Light, bypassing the fallen"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 191worlds. These ceremonies later evolved to include complex mummification pro-cesses and were chronicled in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. It is also believedthat this text (and others) used secret codes to outline the Mysteries as taught withinthe Egyptian occult schools. These teachings were complex and sophisticated. Forexample, it was taught that man was seen as having ten bodies, ranging from theKhu or Self to the Ka or astral body. It is intriguing that these fit so well with theSephiroth of the Tree of Life, however, when we consider that Moses was anEgyptian initiate, the link becomes self evident.The life of the average man or women in Egypt was saturated with magic, there wasno artificial separation between religion and magic. While there certainly was anesoteric craft sustained by a specialised priest class, there was always festivals,feasts and celebrations that catered to the needs of the masses. Medicine wasclosely associated with Astrology and Herbalism and early forms of metallurgywere taught as part of the arcanum of Alchemy. Every facet of Egyptian life was insome way connected to the Mysteries.The Pyramids and the Sphinx are two of the great mysteries of Egypt, they havebeen interpreted as being everything from storage bins for grain to Initiatorytemples. The esoteric tradition holds that they were build by the survivors ofAtlantis and that even their geometry embodies the ancient ways. From thesespeculations a whole system has developed (Pyramidology) which attempts tointerpret the meaning of the shapes, angles and numbers of the great pyramids.From the perspective of the esoteric tradition the greatest legacy that Egypt has leftus is not found in stone, but is found in the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus.The Teachings of HermesThe Teachings of HermesHermeticism takes its name from the person of Hermes Trismegistus. He wasbelieved to be the greatest scholar of Ancient Egypt and while he is reputed to havewritten many texts, only a small number survive. One of the most importantsurviving texts is that of the Poemandres. The basic principle of Hermeticism is thatour supreme goal must be to become part of God, to achieve this goal we mustescape from the cycles of birth, death and rebirth as perpetuated by the Demiurgeand as represented by the planets. There is some debate over exactly howHermeticism sees the world, some commentators see Hermeticism as accepting"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 192matter (and perhaps even the Demiurge) as part of the natural scheme of things,while others offer a more traditional dualistic interpretation. Due to the limits onavailable primary texts perhaps we will never be truly sure. The emphasis on theLogos or Divine Word as the Son of God relates the Hermetic tradition to laterChristian Gnosticism, indeed many early Church Fathers used Hermeticism as partof their apologetics.IsraelIsraelWhere did the people of Israel originate ? It seems that this is a quirk of historywhich will not be easily solved. From Biblical accounts we know that Moses camefrom Sumer and that Abraham was a Chaldean, so the assumption can be made thatthe people of Israel were racially similar to the many tribes of the region (includingthe Sumerians and Egyptians). There is also a suggestion that they were part andparcel of Egyptian society, however, as Egypt became more cosmopolitan and cameto loose its spiritual values, the Israelites slowly developed as a distinct religiouscommunity. As time progressed and Egypt moved towards multiculturalism andreligious syncretism, the religious separatism and character of the Israelites becomea point of contention and they were persecuted. After many confrontations theIsrealites escaped into the deserts and developed a unique identity, indeed, the nameEgypt became synonymous with the fallen world. Israel evolved, at first, into atheocratic state firmly entrenched in the Mysteries, however, as happens withpolitics, compromises were made and the state of Israel distanced from the “OldWays”.As Isreal grew tensions developed between the Stellar religion of the Mysteries andthe fertility rites of surrounding tribes. These conflicts unsettled the homogenousstate and brought about internal conflicts and wars. These resulted in Israelseperating into two states and further degeneration in political and social structurescaused such a lack of cohesion, that Israel could be easily invaded and taken intocaptivity.Captivity however did not mark the end of Israel. It is an esoteric tradition that theten lost tribes migrated to become the Anglo-Saxon Celts. Josephus writing in 70CE states \"The Ten tribes did not return to Palestine, only two tribes serve theRomans after Palestine became a Roman province\". The two tribes who returned to"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 193Palestine became the forerunners of the Essenes, while the ten “lost tribes” formedwhat we consider to be Western civilisation. According to Second Esdras, we findthe ten lost tribes moving a thousand miles west to southeast Russia to become thepeople known as the Scythians.Those are the Ten tribes, which were carried out of their ownland in the time of Osea the King, whom Salmanasar, the Kingof Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over thewaters and so they came into another land. But they took thiscounsel among themselves and they would leave the multitudeof the heathen and go forth into a further country, where nevermankind dwelt, that they might there keep their statutes, whichthey never kept in their own land. And they entered intoEuphrates by the narrow passages of the river. For still theflood till they were passed over. For through that country therewas a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half and thesame region is called Asareth.2 Esdras 13:13-45.Ancient historians such as Ptolemy and Herodotus and modern historians such asGibbons have also affirmed that the captive tribes of Israel were known throughvarious periods as Guta, Getae, Gauls, Goths, Manda, Dacians, Teutons, Normans,Angli, Suka, Scythians and Saxons. All these people were of the same stock asancient Israel - that is Aryan.Now it is possible that Israel disappeared in one section of theworld and the progenitors of the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic peopleappeared in the same place a few years later without the twopeoples being in any way related, but not hardly probable !The overwhelming circumstantial evidence makes it appearthat the lost tribes of Israel and the progenitors of the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic people were one and the same.

The biggest bone ofcontention is the identity of modern Jewry. The answer according to the Gnostictradition is explosive. The people of Israel were of the same racial stock as the firstDynasties of Egypt and Sumer - they were white. The modern Jews who claim theOld Testament have no racial link to Israel whatsoever, according to ArthurKoestler (author of the Thirteenth tribe) the ancestors of the modern Jews did notcome from Jordan, but from the Volga, not from Canaan but from the Cauca-sus....genetically they are more related to the Hun, Uigar and Magyar tribes than tothe Seed to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. (and this is from a Zionist Jewish writer !) Itseems likely that the traditions of modern Jewry were evolved by the Edomite tribeswhile in Babylon, here gained precedence while the real people of Israel migratedto the west. The migration of Isreal created a void and substitute Israelites steppedin. Accordingly, we need to totally review our interpretation of Judaism. When weconsider the great fraud that has been perpetuated, we need to run a critical eye overthe Old Testament as well. When we do, we find some interesting anomalies. TheOld Testament actually includes many different streams which seem to have bewritten by many different authors, many of which had conflicting religious views(for example, Isaiah is said to have been written by at least three different people).Accordingly, the Old Testament represents myths and legends adapted and modi-fied (even twisted) by the beliefs of the prevailing ideological elite. For example, inBabylon, records and legends of the older Qadesh Israelite priesthood wereexpunged and a emphasis placed on the Pharisaic priesthood . These multiplestreams and authors can be discovered by reading any modern text on Biblicalcriticism, however, only when seen in the light of the Aryan-Israelite/Edomite"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 195dichotomy do they take on special relevance.The Druid ConnectionThe Druid ConnectionIt is believed by many that the Druids were the post diaspora priestclass of Israel.Many facets of the early Druid faith resemble what we know of the IsraeliteMysteries. The secret alphabet of the Israelites was used by the Druids and, formnemonic purposes was related to trees (and later to birds and animals). Certainlythe native religion of the Celts and many other Indo-Europeans betray a strongsimilarity to the Israelite traditions. One interesting fact to note is that according toexperts in the field of linguistics Welsh has borrowed more words from Hebrewthan any other language. This and many historical facts suggest that the traditions ofearly England rather than being darkly pagan were actually Gnostic, and embodiedmore truth than what was being taught in the Churches that were attacking them forheresy ! A later tradition regarding the relationship of Jesus to the Druids shedseven further light on these connections.The Essene LinkThe Essene LinkWhen some of the people of Judah returned to Palestine after the captivity, not allaccepted the Roman rule and integrated into the secular state. Though the Phariseesand Saducees continued the corrupt form of Talmudic (Edomite) form of Judaism,some of those who returned, kept the original Israelite-Aryan faith and separatedthemselves off into desert communities.Though this group travelled from location to location, around 180 BCE they formeda secret communal order to sustain the ancient Mysteries, this was located in thedeserts of Palestine. This group taught separation from the people of Palestine andwhile many other returning Judeans mixed with the Edomites and other localpeoples, this group sustained its discrete identity. They upheld the original Israeliteteachings, so as \"Judaism\" in its Pharisaic form became popular they rejected it,refusing to worship in the temple and living a monastic life in the desert. This groupbecame known as the Essenes and forms an important link in the survival of theGnosis through the dark time from Constantine's rule to the present."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 196If it is true as everyone attests, that Moses left an oral law, it isamongst the Essenes that it was preserved. The Pharisees whoflattered themselves so highly on possessing it, only has itsoutward forms, as Jesus reproaches them at every moment. It isfrom these latter that the modern Jews descend.La Langue Hebraique,Fabre D'Olivet.It is from the ranks of the Essenes that Jesus came and re-established the Gnosticfaith. Jesus was not a Jew racially, by geography (he was a Galilean) and he wascertainly not a Jew by religion (Pharisaic or Edomite). He was an Israelite in theEssene sense of the world. In this context we can then see how Gnosticism (or realChristianity) developed out of the Israelite-Essenes, not the Judaism of Palestine.We can also clearly see how Judaism (in the modern sense) developed from theTalmudic schools of Babylon rather than from the traditions of Israel. Accordinglywe get a clear picture that all is not what it seems in modern religious traditions.When we couple this to the fact that Emperor Constantine re-moulded the prevailingJewish and Christian groups into a political amalgam in 325 AD (Nicea), a newperspective on history arises.They (the Essenes) were not waiting to receive the Law - theyalready possessed it. Their aim was to deliver it from therealms of darkness in which it had been engulfed.

TheOlder esoteric traditions which are seen reflected in the rites of Egypt and Israe;provided the framework by which the cultures grew and spread throughout theworld, creating on its way Western Civilisation. However, still there was littleopportunity for individual Salvation and Redemption. The festivals and traditionsoffered some experience of the divine, but a more immediate expression of theteachings was necessary. The early traditions provided a process by which theWorlds of Light revealed themselves to man, by the time of Jesus they had evolvedto a point where a full restoration of the original Mystery teachings was mandatory.The various Essene and Druidic teachings had become too mixed with relatednational and cultural factors and hence a clear revelation of truth was required.Jesus as a pre-existent spirit - the Arch-Angel Michael, took human form so hecould experience and overcome the power of the Archons and the Dialectic World,and show the way through which mankind could do likewise. He was born andlived as a human with the same potential for failing and the same temptations as allhumans - he experienced the Dialectic tides and overcome them. He travelled theworld in his \"so-called\" missing years, studying in both India and Britain, bringingthe divergent threads of the Mystery Tradition to a common climax, while at thesame time achieving a mastery of himself and the world around him. The baptism ofJesus clearly shows his high state of initiation, his energy field has been cleansed ofDialectic elements by Sophia, and in recognition of his achievement, the Father ofWisdom acknowledged his new state. Michael is now Jesus the Christ, the Christstate being the achievement of communication with the Logos.As soon as Jesus was baptised, he went up out of the water. Atthat moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of Goddescending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice fromheaven said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am wellpleased.\"Matthew 3:16,17Jesus was now in a position to transform the human situation, as a Son of God (a"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 198being whose essence is in communication with the Logos and whose actionsembody the Holy Spirit), he went about his task of redeeming the caged particles oflight.Jesus however had more to do that simply teach the Mysteries, Jesus had to initiatethe current which would open the door to deification. It was not enough to justteach, Jesus himself had to spiritually transform the nature of the Dialectic plane sothat an opportunity; a gateway for redemption from the Archons could becomepossible. Prior to the advent of Jesus no escape from the World of the Archons wasavailable ! Even the astral/etheric worlds were under the influence of the fallensystem. Jesus therefore came to demonstrate that the death system of the Dialecticcould be overcome and this is exactly what he did !Throughout the Old Testament the Messiah is foretold in both type and in prophecy.The whole body of law, sacrifice and ceremony foreshadowed the death andresurrection of Jesus; the furniture, fabrics, structure..all aspects of the Tabernacle,hinted at what was to come and the sacrifice of the lamb was to foretell this futurerole.In the cosmology of the Bogomils, as the fall was caused by an immortal, Satanel,so the power of the fall could only be destroyed by an immortal - Michael. Byfulfilling the prophecies and becoming a willing sacrifice Jesus became the freeoffering which illustrated the way in which the World of the Archons could beovercome. What Jesus offered was a new way, a new Path- the Path of Transfigu-ration. This new way leads through the mazes of the Dialectic kingdom to the Fatherand is the only way to immortality for Israel.Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:no man cometh unto the Father but by me.John 14:6At the moment that Jesus died the world was transformed, the veil in the Templewas torn in two. But what does this actually mean ?"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 199The Holy of Holies, which the veil covered was where the High Priest entered tocommune with God in both the Egyptian and Israelite traditions. Now this Taberna-cle was destroyed, Jesus was both the sacrifice and the High Priest and through hisvoluntary death he had opened a way for individuals to achieve their own redemp-tion. But more than this ! Since Jesus was able to overcome death and the World ofthe Archons, individuals could now do the same.The Missing Years of JesusThe Missing Years of JesusThe Missing Years of Jesus have been a matter of scholarly contention for manyyears. It seems likely from available historical information that Jesus was trained bythe Essenes and lived within the Essene Gnostic community. From his birth it wasknown that he was the Chosen One, and hence he was given special training toprepare him for that task. As part of that training he travelled to many locationsaround the world, learning and mastering the spiritual disciplines of the Adamicpeoples, and preparing them for the esoteric traditions he was to reveal when thetime was right. After these travels he returned, and acknowledged his special roleby the act of Baptism under John the Baptist (a Essene recluse) and the rest, youmay say, is history. The evidence for the travels of Jesus is excellent. For example,the Unknown Life or Jesus by Nicholas Notovitch offers us a first hand account ofthe Life of Jesus in a manuscript Notovitch found circa 1877-1878 in a monastery inLeh, the capital of Ladak. This manuscript outlines in quite some detail the life ofSaint Issa (Jesus in Pali) and his travels throughout India and environs. The text isnot only poetic and of some beauty, but covers many aspects of the spiritualteaching, as well as providing historical information regarding the life of Saint Issa.Considering that the early Vedic teachings derived from the Aryan Gnosis it wouldseem likely that Jesus would travel there to learn and teach.And the learned old men asked him this question \" it is claimedthat you deny the Laws of Mossa and teach the people to desertthe Temple of God. And Issa answered \" We cannot demolishwhat has been given by our Heavenly Father and what has beendestroyed by Sinners, but I have recommended the purification"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 200of all stain from the heart, for that is the veritable temple ofGod.

Tree of Life Publications, USA.In regards to Jesus’ travels to Britain the details are sketchy but reliable. Theevidence suggests that Israel was more of a cosmopolitan region than many scholarshave realised. It had links with many peoples and many cultures. Joseph ofArimathea was a very rich man and it is now believed he bought and traded tin aswell as other commodities from bases in England, probably Cornwall and Somerset.We know that after the death of Jesus around AD 63 St.Phillip actually sent Josephand others back to England to preach the Gospel (Refer. Victory of AureliusAmbrosius by Gildad Albanicus). There also are a abundance of legends particu-larly in Somerset about the child Jesus travelling to Britain with Joseph. It is evensuggested that the very location of Glastonbury cathedral is where Jesus and Josephbuilt their hut on their first trip to Britain.In the western confines of Britain there is a certain royal islandof large extent, surrounded by water, abounding in all thebeauties of nature and necessaries of life. In it the firstNeophites of Catholic Law, God beforehand acquainting themfound a Church constructed by no human art but divinelyconstructed (by the hands of Christ himself) for the salvation ofhis people. The Almighty has made it manifest by manymiracles and mysterious visitations that He continues to watchover it as sacred to Himself....A letter from St.Augustine to Pope Gregory."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 201Amazing as it may seem, even the Druids believe that Jesus came to Britain andtaught them the esoteric teachings, for example, Taliesin the Bard and Druid (circa550 CE) states \"Christ, the word from the beginning, was from the beginning ourteacher and we never lost his teachings\".There are many volumes examining the details of Jesus' trek to Britain, some of themore important examine the historical record of Glastonbury which can be tracedright back to the chapel built by Jesus and Joseph. For this reason the site hascontinued to remain sacred and became the centre of other important legends andreligious tales such as those of King Arthur and his knights. Obviously since Britainwas the destination for so many of the lost tribes of Israel we would expect that itwould be of primary importance for the early spreading of the message. From manyaccounts Ireland and England were the first countries outside Palestine to receivethe Christian message.The GreeksThe GreeksThere has been a trend in modern scholarship to overlook the role of Greekphilosophy and mysticism in Gnosticism, and indeed with general reference toChristianity. It is so easy to attempt to interpret the New Testament from theperspective of Semitic social mores and forget the cosmopolitan nature of Israel atthat period and the background of the Greek Mysteries. The Gospel of Johnillustrates this perfectly, it has a strong Hellenic orientation and uses terms thatclearly come from the Greek Mystery traditions. When we consider the GnosticIdentity theory in its full context, then we can consider that the Hebrew and GreekMysteries are simply two phases of one tradition. Indeed it is impossible to deciphermany of the numerical codes of the four gospels without reference to Greekgematria, traditions and social mores.Greek philosophical works were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls and in the NagHammadi finds and it seems likely that the Greek Philosophers not only formed thebackbone for the development of Christian doctrine (in terms of the Roman Catholic"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 202Church), but were an integral part of the Gnostic Canon.The teachings of Plato form, in some sense, the foundation from which much ofmodern Gnostic thought has developed. The world of Ideals, the nature dualism,spiritual Aristocracy and other Gnostic doctrines can be all be seen in early Platonicthought, and certainly while much of Greek philosophy is at variance with theGnostic tradition, there is much similarity also. Plotinus, Iamblichus, Apuleius,Pythagoras and others all prove of value when studying the Greek Mysteries.Indeed it is said that Iamblichus was the originator of a complete system of occultpractise which was destroyed by the Christians in the sixth century. The fragmentswhich survived gave rise to much of the Medieval system of signatures, Grimoiresand planetary magic. The numerical system of Pythagoras which gave birth togeometry (and perhaps music and the arts), also was the basis for much of theAriosophic Kabbalah, Gematria and related numerical, musical and geometricalforms.The esoteric traditions of Ancient Greek such as the Ophite and EleutherianMysteries are certainly considered part of the Gnostic heritage, and indeed as morebecomes known of them will prove of value in our understanding of the develop-ment of early Gnostic thought.The PerataeThe PerataeAs the message of Jesus spread, prevailing ideological structures had to deal withwhat was fast becoming a spiritual revolution. Some tried to attack it head on, butthis proved unsuccessful, accordingly, a process of infiltration and corruptionbegan. As time progressed the esoteric traditions were suppressed and an official,bureaucratic Church was formed. By the time of Emperor Constantine (circa 325AD), the esoteric traditions had gone fully underground. These underground cultswent by many names, today they are generally known as Gnostics. Dating frombetween 140 and 400 AD, the Paerate were a important development of the Gnostictradition. They were founded by Euphrates (born in 160 AD) and represented astrictly dualist view of the material world. They were anti-reproduction, but usedsexuality as a means to stimulate para-physical energies that existed beyond thebody. The Peratae were a secret cult, which operated behind closed doors and had"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 203strict entry requirements.A central Mystery used within their teachings was that of an inner interpretation ofthe trek from Egypt to Jordan via Israel. According to the Peratae Israel was thesoul and the trek outlined (in allegory and myth) the process of returning to theTreasury of Light. It begins with leaving Egypt (the fallen world), the soul thentravels through the waters of corruption, into the deserts of asceticism, facing theattacks of the serpents (temptations and false Gnosis), until at last, the soul ispurified enough that it can reach Jordan (the paradise of light, Peratos). The Perataehad a complex technology of Transfiguration including forms of meditation, tantrickpractise, mantras, postures, rites and celebrations.BasilidesBasilidesBasilides (85 - 145 CE) claimed to be a disciple of Glaucias, the interpreter of Peter,and hence represented his teachings as having Apostolic authority. He was acopious writer, though little of his work survives today. His cosmology is akin totraditional Gnostic dualism with an emphasis on the emanations which existbetween the Lord of Wisdom and the lower worlds. Basilides’ system wasextremely complex involving 365 heavens with related hierarchies and forms.Jehovah was seen as a lowly creation who in turn created the physical world. Whenthe physical world fell into disorder, the Lord of Wisdom sent his son (Christ orNous) to liberate the fallen kingdoms from Jehovah (the creator) and the Archons.The Gnostic practise of Basilides emphasised asceticism and suffering as a path tognosis and centred on secret rites and initiations. Valentinus was one of his pupils.ValentinusValentinusValentinus (110-175 CE) is in some sense the father of Gnosticism. He was anaccomplished and well respected author, poet and teacher. Later in his life hetravelled from his Egyptian home to teach in Rome (135-160 AD). He was close tobeing given a bishropic, which would have certainly changed the face of theChurch, alas this did not occur and he seceded from the Church. Valentinus taughtwhat he claimed were the secret teachings of St.Paul, these included a complexcosmology based on dualism and emanations. His teachings mixed Greek philoso-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 204phy, mysticism and magic with an allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament,they are probably the most intellectual of all the Gnostic traditions.Mysticism, Tantra and esoteric practise were part of the Valentianian system andthis led to claims of sexual excess against his followers by many Church Fathers.The same Fathers, however, admit that Valentinus lead a faultless life and that hiserudition and education was superior to many of the supposed Church academics.His Secret Gospel of Truth is considered one of the major surviving Gnostic texts.The PauliciansThe PauliciansThere is only one thing that separates us from the Romans(Catholics). We say that there is a go who is a heavenly fatherand has no power in this world, but in the world to come andthat there is another god, the Creator, who has power over thepresent world; whereas the Romans recognise the existence ofone sole god, who is both heavenly father and creator of theworld.Historia,Peter of Sicily.The major emphasis in the teachings of the Paulicians was extreme dualism. Theybelieved that the creator of this world is evil and that matter is a prison. Theheavenly Father is way beyond the present scheme of things and exists separately ina dimension of perfection, he can only be experienced through knowledge orGnosis. The Paulicians totally rejected the Old testament identifying its God withthe Demiurge, they saw Jesus as the emissary of the light world and the only chanceof experiencing the divine. Their response to the world was unique in the Gnosticworld, they were militaristic in emphasis and battled, both intellectually andphysically, against the prevailing ecclesiastical authorities. It is rumoured that someof the descendants of the Paulicians joined the Knight Templars. The major periodof Paulician teaching was between 600 and 1100 CE."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 205The BogomilsThe BogomilsThe Bogomils started in Bulgaria around 950 CE. They take their name from theirfounder, the priest we know only as Bogomil. His name meant friend or beloved ofGod. The Bogomils were extreme dualists, railing against the world and reproduc-tion. They encouraged homosexuality as an alternative to family life and this is howthe term bogar or bugger came into the slang vocabulary of the world. They taughtthat not only matter, but the Church and all earthly institutions were of theDemiurge and encouraged a pacifistic and simple life in response. As a result theywere hunted down and killed without mercy.The CatharsThe CatharsThe name Cathars comes from the Greek word Katharos, which literally means thepurified, it is more regularly translated as “the pure ones”. It is the title given to arange of movements which existed between the third and eleventh centuries inArmenia, Assyria, Asia Minor, the Balkans and Europe. Within western Europethese early Gnostics appeared in northern France and the Low Countries toward thelate 11th or early 12th century. Persecuted and expelled from the north, theytravelled south and found success in the semi-independent province of Languedocand the surrounding regions. Here they became known as Albigenses. At theirheight it was said that there were some 50,000 Cathars and 3,000 Parfait. TheRoman Catholic Church initially attempted to bring them back to the fold throughsubtle means. However, when every attempt failed, Pope Innocent III launched theAlbigensian Crusade (circa 1209-29) that annihilated the Cathars and desolatedmuch of southern France. Small groups are believed to have survived in isolatedareas, but were continually pursued by the Inquisition.While beliefs varied from movement to movement (there were some 50 distinctCathar sects), they generally held certain Gnostic doctrines in common. Theseincluded strict dualism and a belief that the material world was the creation ofSatan, this false creator they called Rex Mundi or the King of the World. Theyrejected all of the Old Testament and opposed the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 206Church as well as its liturgy and sacraments. The central rite of the Cathar faith wasthe Consolamentum, a special baptism which initiated those who have moved frombeing Credentes (believers) to Parfait (Perfect Ones). This rite was preceded byfasting and was considered such an important initiation that to break the oath of theParfait meant expulsion from the Cathar community. It is generally believed thatmost Cathars were vegetarian and avoided reproduction. Historically there is muchevidence for contact and communication between the Cathars and Bogomils. It issaid that a Bogomil bishop arranged discussions and meetings with Cathar bishopsin many regions.Brethren of the Free SpiritBrethren of the Free SpiritThe first Gnostic to be known under the appellation of “Free Spirit” was Amalric ofBena (circa 1209), an Italian Antinomian who believed that we must do away withthe priesthood and offer believers a direct experience of the divine. His approachwas even more controversial in that he did not shy away from the use of sexualmysticism (Tantra) as part of his system. Generally, the term Brethren of the FreeSpirit has been used to denote those who combine Antinomianism with sexmysticism. Another example in this class is Heinrich Niclaes (1498-1561 CE), whonot only taught that once you was born again you became free of sin and could liveas you please, but that to become born again you had to experience a secret unionwith Christ through the Gnostic rite of the Bridal Chamber. While doctrines variedthroughout the Free Spirit movement, there was a consensus regarding the nature ofthe ecclesiastical authorities - they were believed to be Babylon, the fallen harlot ofthe Book of Revelation. On the whole, the Free Spirit movements tended to beanti-reproduction, believed that all unions with unbelievers were cursed and that theuse of sex was a major key within the redemption process. Out of all of the FreeSpirit founders the most recognised was Marguerite Porete the authoress of the onlyfully extant Free Spirit Scripture, The Mirror of Simple Souls. Way before her time,she taught the equality of the sexes, the right not to reproduce and the freedom givenby the Gnosis."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 207The AlchemistsThe AlchemistsThe Alchemical tradition is varied and complex, it is difficult to summarise its rolein the continuum of the Gnosis. It primary focus was the transmutation of man intoGod, the techniques for which were transmitted under the guise of chemicaltransformation. The texts of the Alchemists were coded to avoid the inquisition andhence sustained the secret tradition through the veil of symbolism. Some of themajor Alchemical figures include Trithemius (1642-1516), Paracelsus (1493-1541)and Agrippa (1486-1535).The Rosicrucians and Knight TemplarsThe Rosicrucians and Knight TemplarsBoth the Knight Templars and the Rosicrucians are orders steeped in Mystery. TheKnight Templars were, at first, considered to be simply an order for the protectionof the roads along which pilgrims travelled to the Holy Land. However, as theybecome better known, rumours began to circulate about their esoteric knowledgeand occult practises and this resulted in their persecution. Their teachings weredualistic with an emphasis on the union of the opposing male and female facets ofconsciousness, this process was reflected in their use of the image of Baphomet, anandrogynous Pan like figure within their secret shrines. Their origins can probablybe traced to 1188 CE when the Order of Sion split into two opposed factions, ofwhich the Knight Templar was the major. As time progressed and their influencespread, the Knight Templars absorbed esoteric teachings from Arabic alchemy andSufi mysticism - they form an important link in the transmission of the Gnosis.The Rosicrucians are thought to also have originated about the same time as the theKnight Templars. While their teachings are similar, the Rosicrucians had a muchstronger mystical emphasis. The name Rosicrucian is from the image of the RosyCross, a single red rose superimposed on a crucifix. This icon had a wide spectrumof interpretations, but the primary emphasis was on the pain and suffering requiredto find the true Self and awaken it. In the Fourteenth century the Brothers of theRose Cross made a somewhat public appearance by creating the myth of ChristianRosencrantz, a superhuman figure who had supposed lived for 106 years and left hissecrets to the order. This had the desired effect and many Rosicrucian orders arose.In the Seventeenth century a range of manifestoes were penned by many members"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 208of the Order (and many who spuriously claimed membership) and Lodges spread toEngland, France and Russia.

In more recent time a plethora of authorshave claimed membership of the Order. It seems likely that in the 1990’s theRosicrucians are a spiritual rather than physical brotherhood.X"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 209IntroductionIntroductionIt seems such a long time between the revelation of Jesus and 1844, but in somesense things had not changed that much. Light was still battling against Darkness,and the Gnostic message was still being twisted and manipulated by the dominionsof the Demiurge. While the names of the enemies may have changed, their approachwas remarkably similar. As the battle intensified, energies on both sides preparedfor the change that was going to take place. On the side of the Light world manyarose, each of which interpreted the transformation in their own way, and throughthe symbol systems of their own unconscious.However, confusing this may seem at first glance, if we look behind what theywrote and said, and ignore the great variance in symbolism, we can deduce a similarcore vision. Between 1844 and 1914 something momentous occurred, there was achange in the energy which operated through the Seat of Ra. In terms of astrologicalcycles, the Equinox of the Gods had begun. This change was and is of significancebecause it caused an acceleration of the forces of the Kali Yuga and is bringingmankind face to face with his destiny.Observers of the ChangeObservers of the ChangeThe change which began in 1844 was accelerated at the various points of emphasis.As a year has its seasons, the Heraldic age has four nexus dates - 1844, 1904, 1964and 2004. To fully appreciate the nature of these dates and the Heraldic period as awhole we need to come to some understanding of the various schools of thoughtwhich observed it. This is a difficult thing because all of these schools were notnecessarily aware of the nature of the change. Each experienced something, but thatsomething varied according to the symbol-system of the school. In some sense it is"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 210akin to what may happen if we interviewed a range of people about a robbery whichoccurred a week or so ago. Each would have seen the event according to their ownpsychological structure, prejudices and values that are part of their make-up. Whileeach maintain their objectivity and may even vigorously defend their interpretationof events (and in some sense they are being true to what they perceive), each wouldreport only their own perception of the event, not the facts of the actual event itself.In the case of the changeover, The Equinox of the Gods, the observers variedgreatly and saw it in many differing terms. Some saw it in terms of Christianity,others in terms of Sufism and still others in terms of the western magical traditionthen represented in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. This is made all themore awkward by the fact that many of these observers formed religions andorganisations based on their perceptions, many of which still exist today. Accord-ingly, we have a bizarre situation where an observer of a historical and spiritualevent is transformed into the prophet or herald of a religious movement.For the Gnostic, while each of these observers are of value and have importantthings to say, we do not assign religious significance to them individually. Some arecertainly more admirable than others, a number are very difficult to take and in thecase of Aleister Crowley, many would seem him as a malefic rather than inspira-tional figure. The fact however is that morality is somewhat irrelevant, what wewant are perceptions and records of the transition that occurred at the Equinox ofthe Gods. While psychological makeup certainly needs to be considered in evaluat-ing the information we receive, it is the information that is important, not thebehavior and personal whims and fancies of the individual involved. If we acceptthat all observers were biased and interpreted the event according to their psycho-logical makeup, then we can perhaps deduce a core knowledge of what occurred. Itis of little significance what movements, organisations or Churches they formed,since these religious bodies were only founded on their partial understanding orlimited perceptions. In many cases the dictum that “a little knowledge is adangerous thing” certainly applies to the organisations that resulted."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 211The Nature of the ChangeThe Nature of the ChangeThe Heraldic age is in preparation for a transition which is a changeover in theenergy form that exists in the Solar Logos. In simple terms, the archetype which isthe focus of the Seat of Ra will change from Horus to Maat, Pisces to Aquarius.This change will bring about a significant variation in the experience of humanity,both in terms of Light and Darkness, Positivity and Negativity. All aspects of thefourfold Solar Cross (negative and positive X and Y factors) are influenced by thechangeover. As the Heraldic period takes hold, humanity is drawn throught thetransition and experiences vibrations of both a Piscean and Aquarian nature. Ateach of the nexus dates within the Heraldic period, the energies further accelerateand transform.Religious Perceptions of the ChangeReligious Perceptions of the ChangeThere were many who witnessed the start of the Heraldic period from the percep-tion of traditional Christianity. In the Adventist movement people were experienc-ing revelations and visions as early as the 1830’s, as 1844 came close they becameconvinced that Jesus was to return at that date. They were sorely disappointed.Interpreting what they experienced in Christian terms, they came to the conclusionthat they had misunderstood the momentous event. They then evolved a complextheology whereby in 1844 Jesus changed his role and function. Jesus’ moved frombeing a priest in the outer temple, to being the High Priest in the Holy of Holies. Forthe Adventists (now Seventh Day Adventists) there was a tabernacle, like that ofIsrael, in the heavens and starting in 1844 Jesus began to officiate at the judgementof the dead. This doctrine was evolved in association with complex systems ofProphecy taken from the Old Testament which clearly suggested some esotericevent was to occur around this time. The doctrine of investigative judgement placesthe Seventh Day Adventists outside the general doctrinal position of many otherChristian denominations.The theology of the Adventists actually offers a fascinating perception of theEquinox of the Gods. Ellen.J.White and the other visionaries of the Adventistmovement obviously perceived a change in the energies that existed, and evenperceived a change in the nature or focus of these forces. While at first they"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 212interpreted these in traditional theological terms (i.e. the physical return of Jesus),they later evolved a more complex spiritual understanding of the event. In somesense their iconography is very accurate, the energy has changed from a priestly toHigh Priestly function, from sacrifice to Theosis (deification).The Jehovah Witnesses offer another intriguing series of perceptions. While thereare various different interpretations of their doctrine, the early Jehovah’s Witnessesbelieved that Jesus would return in 1914. When he failed to arrive, they came tounderstand that he had returned, but in a spiritual sense. While they look forward toJesus being physically present at the future final Judgement they believe that thereturn of Jesus as prophesied in the Bible has already occurred. This too is ameaningful perception of the Equinox of the Gods, the energies of Pisces arereturning in the form of Aquarius, Jesus has re-appeared in the Heraldic cycle in thesense that the Christ or Solar Logos is undergoing transformation. These areintriguing religious interpretations of a very occult event.Occult perceptions of the ChangeOccult perceptions of the ChangeAliester Crowley is not an easy man to write about. He is worshipped by some andreviled by others, he is seen as either a master magician or an evil genius, a con manor a God. For the Gnostic he is none of these things, he is just a man - nothing more,nothing less. The soul that inhabited the body of Edward Alexander Crowley whenhe came to earth on the 12th October 1875 had spent many centuries preparing. Bythrowing off the restraints of convention, morality and orthodoxy it opened up to thedimensions beyond the physical and beheld the Equinox of the Gods. There was,however, one problem, Crowley was very much the product of a Victorian society,so everything that he experienced, every vision he had, every revelation he received,was filtered through the conditioning he received in his youth and the occult trainingof his adulthood. Crowley's understanding of the change of ages is still, however, ofgreat relevance. If we strip away the grandstanding and arrogance of Crowleyanitywe find a comprehensive record of the Equinox of the Gods. The major differencebetween the Gnostic and Thelemite view is that there is no evidence a new Aeonbegan in 1904. The Aeon of Horus, which many claim began on this date, was theage heralded by Jesus and James and existed since the dawning of the Piscean Age.Crowley's revelation was a re-instatement of the primal Gnosis and a witness to the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 213start of the Heraldic Period, which has been developing since 1844. For the Gnosticit is important to see Crowley and indeed the whole Golden Dawn tradition as partof the Gnostic continuum rather than allowing them to be re-interpreted by thosewho want to emphasize the ritual magic over the intense spiritual vision theypossessed.On 14th March 1904 Crowley and his then wife Rose were in a flat in Cairo. Theyhad prepared a room for ritual invocation, it faced North. Crowley called, as usual,on the Egyptian God Thoth. However this time something strange occurred, his wifeRose fell into a trance state and began to chant “they are waiting for you”. Thiscontinued until the 18th of the month. During this day’s invocation the startled Roseexclaimed “He who is waiting is Horus”. As the story unfolds Crowley invokesHorus and feels that he has communication with a being called Aiwass, who is anancient Egyptian Priest. Aiwass then dictates to Crowley “the Book of the Law”- acryptic book of three chapters.What are we to make of Aiwass and the Book of the Law ? While Aiwass claims tobe a messenger of Horus he does sound a lot like Aleister Crowley, however at thesame time, there are complex numerical codes within the Book of the Law whichsuggest it is not a conscious fraud. Aiwass could be best seen as a personification ofthe innermost Will of Crowley himself. It is that True Self or Will, which beingbeyond time was able to contemplate the transition which was occurring in the SolarLogos. It is ludicrous to see Aiwass as some sort of extra-terrestrial using Crowleyas the medium or Prophet of a new age. Crowley himself had a love/hate relation-ship with both Aiwass and the Book of the Law and conveniently lost it for someyears in his attic !The Book of the Law is classic unconscious material. It is Crowley's individualexperience of the Equinox of the Gods as filtered via his own psychologicalstructure. It could be said to be is his “Selfs” perception of what was occurring inthe spiritual world. It cannot be construed as a Bible as some “Crowleyites” wouldhave it. It is useful in that it offers a good summary of some pertinent aspects ofwhat is changing during the Equinox of the Gods."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 214The central premises of the Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis) can be culledfrom three specific verses...Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.AL 1:40Love is the law, Love under Will.AL 1:57Every man and every woman is a Star.AL 1:3.Every man and every women has the potential to be awakened, this awakening canonly occur through Transfiguration and the forging of the true Will or Self. EveryWill is unique and has its own path (or orbit), the path is the Law for that Star. TrueLove can only be experienced between Stars (those who have awakened their trueself), it is the cohesion between Stars that binds the universe together. There ismuch else of value in The Book of the Law but it must be understood in the contextof the continuum of the Gnosis, to see it as a unique revelation that has started anew movement is to end up as ignorant as the Christians that Crowleyites dislike somuch. It is also clear that it cannot be taken at face value, its symbolism, gematriaand imagery are as complex anything Crowley consciously wrote and hence must bedecoded rather than read.With my Hawk’s head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangson the cross.AL 3:51One of the more interesting verses in the Book of the Law contains its reflection onChristianity, it is found in the third section of the Book of the Law (the seciondedicated to Horus) and its primary thrust is in verse fifty one. This is an importantverse which has many levels of meaning, it is not just trivial blasphemy. Why doesHorus (the Hawk) only peck at the eyes of Jesus ? The answer is because the eyes"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 215represent perspective, perception, even worldview - here the worldview of modernChristianity, as represented by the crucified Jesus, is said to be wrong. The wholeof Christianity is not rejected, the Gnosis is not condemned, it is a matter of the wayin which the teachings of Jesus have been manipulated. This is of great significancewhen we consider the Gnostic revival which has occurred in the Heraldic periodand the need for a re-evaluation of Christianity in light of the Gnostic tradition.There is also a deeper, more esoteric meaning. The eye in Gematria is Ayin, it isrelated to the Devil in the Tarot and represents illusion, emptiness. Another level ofinterpretation is that the Hawk (Horus) is attacking Jesus on the cross because he isa false Jesus, this is hinted at by the focus on the eye or Ayin. The Jesus beingattacked is the false Jesus created by the Apostate Churches and used to control themasses. What emphasizes this inner interpretation is the meaning of the number ofthe verse, fifty one according to Sepher Sephiroth is the number of Edom. Edombeing the name given to the Pharisees or false Israelites who in the Gnositic Identitytradition brought about the apostate form of Christianity in the first place. Both ofthese interpretations give us important clues regarding the message of the Remnantage and its relation to conventional forms of Christianity.Madame BlavasktyMadame BlavasktyMadame Blavaskty was another who felt the great change that was occurring. Shewas born in Russia in 1831 and in her early life trained as a circus hand and pianoteacher, as her skills as a psychic developed she became an assistant to the famousmedium Douglas Home. She travelled widely including such exotic locations asTibet and the Himalayas. In 1873 she began teaching her own form of spiritualism,but this soon gave way to her unique adaptation of the esoteric teachings whichcame to be known as Theosophy. She believed that she was in intimate contact withthe Mahatmas or Secret Chiefs who were the spiritual masters behind mansdevelopment. They outlined to her an esoteric system of thought which was to be ofgreat significance as the Equinox of the Gods unfolded. Her earlier works such asIsis unveiled and the Secret Doctrine offer encyclopaedic interpretations of theMysteries, while later works (and works by other Theosophical authors) seem tofocus more on eastern than Gnostic traditions, they are nevertheless of value.As time progressed Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater (members of the inner"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 216school of Theosophy) became convinced that the change they were sensing wasphysical rather than spiritual and they trained a young man named Krishnamurti tobe the embodiment of the new current. This misinterpretation brought undue stressand finally calamity on the society when Krishnamurti rejected the role of worldMessiah. It is interesting however, to see how occultists and Christians can bothmisinterpret the Equinox of the Gods and look for physical rather than spiritualmanifestations.GurdjieffGurdjieffGurdjieff, like Blavaskty and Crowley, is another character than is either loved orloathed. He was born in 1872 in Alexandropol on the Russian-Persian border andwas initiated as a child into the Yezidi cult. This was followed by a twelve yearexploration of Asia, Europe and Africa. His first teaching took place in the Institutefor the Harmonious Development of Mankind which he founded in Russia, thisInstitute was later moved to France due to the intervention of World War I.The significance of Gurdjieff was that he sensed that the time was right for mankindto awake, he outlined a powerful system in which he taught that man was asleep andthat mankind as a whole spent their whole lives in that state. He emphasised theneed for a superhuman act of Will to go beyond the sleep we are in and the need fora new path for the present age. He argued that the paths of the Fakir, Monk andYogi were for the old age and a new path was needed for the present period.The Philosopher of the Equinox of the GodsThe Philosopher of the Equinox of the Gods- Fredrich Nietzsche- Fredrich NietzscheWe have considered some religious and occult perceptions of the Equinox of theGods, there are obviously many more, we could fill a whole book just consideringmany of the perceptions people had of the change that occurred. When it comes tophilosophy it is much the same, however, one name stands out above the others -that of Fredrich Nietzsche."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 217Nietzsche was born in Rocken in Prussian Saxony in 1844. He studied theology atLeipzig university but soon abandoned his studies as he realised the degenerativestate of German theology. He completed a doctorate in Philology and continued toteach it for some ten years at Basil. He began a study of philosophy first basing hiswork on Schopenhauer and then going beyond to create his own unique systembased on the Will to Power. The philosophy of Nietzsche is an embodiment of theGnosis for the present age, his voluminous works such as Thus Spake Zarathustra,Beyond Good and Evil, the Anti-Christ and many others are of exceptional value inunderstanding the philosophical foundations of the present period.Some of the key concepts found within Nietzsche's philosophy which coincide sowell with the Gnostic tradition include the Will to Power, the Overman, theabandonment of the traditional decayed forms of religion and science, the cycles ofeternal re-occurrence, the need to go beyond mundane forms of morality and thepower of strength, love and Will to achieve liberation.The Dark Side of AquariusThe Dark Side of AquariusThere were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, andthey bare children to them, the same became mighty men whichwere of old, men of renown.And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in theearth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heartwas only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he hadmade man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have createdfrom the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and thecreeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me thatI have made them.Genesis 3:4-8"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 218For I see and behold that demons have begun their seductionsagainst you and against your children and now I fear on yourbehalf that after my death ye will shed the blood of men uponthe earth and ye too will be destroyed.The Book of Jubilees 7:27And he testified to the Watchers, who had sinned with thedaughters of men, these had begun to unite themselves, so as tobe defiled.The Book of Jubilees 4:24These quotes help us to picture a period way before that of our own. What occurredduring this time is truly terrifying, Demonic forces came to earth and mated withthe daughters of men and gave birth to every kind of mutation. These mutatedcreatures, called Nephilim were truly evil and hideous. They are discussed in manytraditional theological works such as those of Clement, Alexander, Tertullian andJustin to name a few early Christian writers and Philo and Josephus to name anumber of others. These beings brought such havoc to earth that after the flood theElder Gods (emissaries from the Pleroma ?) created a special seal across the astraldimension which surrounds the earth and locked them away until the Omega day.According to the New Testament these forces were kept in a spiritual dimensioncalled Tartaros. This is the meaning of verses six and seven in the New Testamentbook of Jude, these uniquely destructive demons are chained until the Last Days.This story may seem unbelievable, but the strange thing is that it is not just found inBiblical literature. Another source of this legend is found in the Old Arab mythologywhich centres on the Necronomicon. This unusual tale is central to many modernscience fiction mythologies as well as to several occult orders. Yet when weexamine modern renditions of the tale they have much in common with the Biblicalepic. Probably one of the better known modern adaptations of the tale is found inthe work of H.P Lovecraft. He is one of the more unusual observers of the NewAeon in that he never accepted his experience of the spiritual world. His childhood"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 219was marred by neurosis and his view of the world alternated between that of anOverman and an neurotic invalid. He had little financial success, working as a ghostwriter for most of his early life. Many of his tales came to embody a mythos heseemed to be consciously unaware of. It was the tale of the Necronomicon.I certainly do not aim to spend much time outlining the Necromonicon myth,however, a basic summary will give you the drift. The Necronomicon outlines aperiod in time when savage and heartless Gods ruled the Earth, these were violentand malefic entities who were called The Old Ones (Archons). At some time in thedim reaches of the past they caused so much havoc on earth that the Elder Godslocked them away in another dimension and sealed the Gateway. Modern Necro-nomicon tales discuss how Atomic energy and the decay of modern society haseroded the seals and that the Old Ones are returning. Legend has it that man willhave to decide on which side to fight in a cosmic battle of frightening proportions.Another modern link with this myth is the work of Occultist Kenneth Grant, aenigmatic figure who originally carried on the research of Aleister Crowley. Hispublished works seem to be obsessed with attempting to manifest the Old Ones,indeed many occultists believe he is perhaps possessed by the very forces heevoked. In his later works, Hecate's Fountain and the Mauve Zone there is little tosave his reputation. Descriptions of alien sexual encounters and the death ofstudents through possession by the Old Ones certainly suggest that Grant and manyothers are under the influence of the Demiurgic kingdom.While we may think some of these occult occurrences are just madness, if wecorrelate the tales with the Biblical story of fallen Angels we begin to see ahauntingly similar pattern. We are moving at lightning speed towards the OmegaDay and the Gateway is opening, if you are not on the side of Treasury of Light(The Elder Gods ?), then you are fair-game for the Old Ones. Perhaps some of thestrange descriptions of the Books of Revelation and Daniel are not that farfetchedafter all !"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 220The Resurfacing of the GnosisThe Resurfacing of the GnosisAs the Heraldic period moves towards Aquarius mankind is heading towards a newperiod of both hope and destruction. The Kali Yuga is also accelerating towards itsconclusion in blood and annihilation, Ragnarok is certainly on the way. At the sametime, as the ages change, the Treasury of Light is working overtime to awaken man.During this century the Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi Library and other findshave offered an unprecedented opportunity for us to be re-aquainted with theGnosis. Gnosticism has become the talk of the town and yet that is all it is for most- talk. Traditional Christianity has reached its most degenerative and barbaric formand is blinding the masses from appreciating their true position. Science continuesto spew forth its nihilistic materialism, but offers little vision. The pleroma isdemanding mans transformation - he must either develop or cease to be. The Path ofTransfiguration is calling those who realise that their only hope is to go beyond thehuman condition, to reject the values of the earth, to fight against the cycles ofeternal re-occurrence and return home to the Treasury of Light. The Equinox of theGods is a final call to mankind, it is the last opportunity before the age ends and theJudgement of Maat begins.X"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 221I teach you the Overman.Man is something that shall be overcome.What have you done to overcome him ?All beings so far have created something beyond themselves,and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even goback to the beasts rather than overcome man ?What is ape to man ?A laughing-stock or painful embarrassment.And man shall be just that for the Overman, a laughing-stock orpainful embarrassment.You have made your way from worm to man and much in youis still worm.Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape thanany ape.Whoever is wisest among you is a mere conflict and a crossbetween plant and ghost.But do I bid you become ghosts or plants.Behold I teach you the Overman.Thus Spake ZarathustraFredrich Nietzsche."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 222Behold ! I teach you the Overman. The Overman is our vision of post-humandevelopment, he is a new creation, a new man. We may visualise the early stages ofmans experience as worm and ape, yet man is a transition between ape and theOverman and his value is as a transition and not an end. The cycles of planet earthcreate a wave, this wave is circular and perpetual. It is the wave of re-occurrence,this wave carries on physical life as we understand it and is collective notindividual. When a creature dies, it does not go to Heaven, the Lands of the Creatoror to some Elysium Gardens, it returns to the wave. There is no separate or discreteindividuality in the wave, only a constant repetition of life and death, returning tothe earth is the nature of the cycle. However, for man to spiritually mature, he mustbreak free from the earth. As a child breaks free from the bosom of its mother, as abird throws its children out of the nest so they may grow, so man must struggle forliberation. It is the greatest in, the only one that cannot be forgiven, to stay at thebosom of mother earth. For to stay in the relative safety of the earth is to destroy theonly opportunity for immortality, the New Man.The New Man is the birth of the true Self, the Overman. He has broken free fromthe eternal cycles of earth and achieved post human status. He has been liberatedfrom the Archonic dominion of the Demiurge and experiences the light of thePleroma. He is strength, lust and nobility. There can be no individual immortality inthe wave, only in the ecstasy of the Overman, this is the essence of the Gnosis.Morality and EthicsMorality and EthicsIt is too easy to speak of morals in a conservative society. There are so manydogmas whether they come from the right or the left, religion or sociology. For theGnostic it is clear that equality is a deception, no one is really equal. While thepoliticians may scream “all men are created equal” reality slaps us in the face andwe realise that this is a matter of social policy rather than everyday experience.Every path to the divine is unique, we experience the flood of past lives in differentways and therefore our present conditions vary greatly. Nobody is the same, nobodyis equal and we must each individually decide whether our personal charade willcontinue. However, one thing we can be sure of, is that the Kali Age is accelerating,mans degeneration is reaching its peak. While technology has become more and"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 223more refined, the content of our lives has become more and more decayed. We havequantity, but little quality. Television, video, computers, virtual reality - all flood ourlives with information, information that seems important, relevant, even necessary -yet that information keeps us asleep, conditioned, stupid and servile. In the pastthere was always time to spare, we could have a family, spend lifetimes exploringand growing, leave our spiritual growth to later in life. The old Hinu tradition wasthat life could be a stroll through its various stages and conditions. We could divideour lives into sectors and as old men and women we could retire to the forest andcontemplate God. Even within the Gnostic tradition we have extolled the virtues ofthe Paths of the Dove and the Serpent and the slow and steady hierarchical progressof the soul.There is one large problem however, that looms in front of us. Time is short !Ragnarok is coming, Armageddon is around the corner. It is no use enrolling in thehigh school if you know that the school will burn down before graduation. As thefinal trumpets begin to blow and the blood laps against our ankles, we need toseriously consider the urgency of Transfiguration. Reproduction was always onlyjust tolerated in the past by Gnostic sects, today it should be viewed aghast. Thetime for family values and children is over - the only new being you should becreating is yourself ! The path of the Dove is useful only insomuch as it leads you tothe wisdom of the Serpent. Do not waste time sprouting moralisms and platitudes,face yourself and become what you are truly meant to be.While morals, ethics, social values have always played a part in the outercourt ofthe Gnosis, it is time to go beyond good and evil and venture within. There are mapsavailable for your inner journey, but you must chart your own course. The verythings that would drive the average man to hell for thousand years may save yourvery soul. Good and evil are the twin sides of one coin, the coin of obedience andrebellion, repetition and denial, all of which keep us safe and sound within cycles ofthe wave of re-occurrence. The Gnosis is an experience, a thunderbolt - which leadsus beyond the yeses and noes of mortal life."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 224The Will to PowerThe Will to PowerWithin the soul herself is the message of immortality, it is the forbidden fruit andwoe to those who pluck it from her breast. The fruit of immortality is the gift of theWill to Power, it is the reason behind existence. It is brutal and strong and is beyondthe qualms and queasiness of little men and petty tyrants. It is pure dynamic force,yet encompasses and goes beyond the Libido of Freud and the integrated Self ofJung. Be aware, however, it is not mindless violence, foolish ego and pettydomination. It is pure unhampered Self, and within it thrust lies the fullness(Pleroma) of individual immortality. It is the flash of light which awakens the soulas it is issued from the Treasury above, it is the transition beyond humanity.I forgot to say that such philosophers are cheerful and that theylike to sit in the abyss below a perfectly clear sky, they needdifferent means from other men for enduring life, for they sufferdifferently (namely from the profundity of their contempt forman as from their love for man). Hence the most sufferinganimal invented for itself - laugher.Fredrich Nietzsche.The Will to Power, No 990 (1885)The Will to power transforms the Gnostic’s view of the world, he sees humanity forhow they really are. This vision of the world, sometimes called The Vision of Pan,can drive the unprepared mad. For to see the futility and stupidity of humanexistence, the meaningless desire to create more anguish, to reproduce, to populate,to pass on the burdens and sins of our forefathers is enough to destroy even thestrongest soul. To see the panorama of human existence as we emerge into each lifenaked, alone, weak and ignorant and leave each life much the same. Mankind is adecayed and malefic species, caught in a cosmic battle from which we cannotescape. As the darkness increases mankind becomes more and more materialistic,believing that science, pleasure and social values will save him and yet, as the newsclearly shows, there is no real development, no redemption, no salvation, only moreviolence, destruction and death. The Gnostic must stand away from humanity, whenthe light within him has been awakened, he has been changed forever. Many will"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 225try and attack that which exposes their sickness and hence to be awakened is to bein danger. We must share the wisdom with thosewho seek it but let the others reapthe crop they have sown.Our VisionOur VisionAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pourout of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and yourdaughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see vi-sions, and your old men shall dream dreamsActs 2:17Transfiguration is not something that can be easily conceptualised. The humanpsyche is dominated by the Archons and the Demiurge, our emotions are floodedwith alien feeling which come from the malefic clouds of dark spirits whichsurround the earth, our bodies are poisoned with instincts alien to our spiritualgoals. We are manipulated by our cellular programs, genes and memes mar ourway. It is impossible to communicate the essence of the dimension, world orreality we originated from, the Treasury of Light and the Lord of Wisdom is so faraway on every possible level. Truth is alien to us because we have never known it,as wisdom is revealed, it is twisted and turned to poison. The Kali Yuga is rollingover the earth and taking mankind with it, at the same time the forces of theConquering sun child of Horus offer man a last chance to wake up and realise hisplight. But be warned, Horus is the god of war as well as of liberation, the sun candry up and parch a desert as quick as it can causes flowers t bloom. If we do notheed the call from the world of Light to awaken and be transformed, then as the KaliYuga ends and time reaches its final days, as the Omega Day explodes onto ourplanet, then we shall surely cease to be and there will be nothing of us left - nothought, record - not even a trace.
