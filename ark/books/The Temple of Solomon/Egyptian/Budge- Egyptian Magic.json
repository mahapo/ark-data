And it is certain that, notwithstanding the continuous progress whichthe Egyptians made in civilization, and the high intellectual development to which theyeventually attained, this belief influenced their minds and, from the earliest to the latestperiod of their history, shaped their views concerning things temporal as well as spiritualin a manner which, at this stage in the history of the world, is very difficult to understand.The scrupulous care with which they performed theirp. viiiinnumerable religious ceremonies, and carried out the rules which they had formulatedconcerning the worship of the divine Power or powers, and their devotion to religiousmagic, gained for them among the nations with whom they came in contact the reputationof being at once the most religious and the most superstitious of men. That this reputationwas, on the whole, well deserved, is the object of this little book to shew.Egyptian magic dates from the time when the predynastic and prehistoric dwellers inEgypt believed that the earth, and the underworld, and the air, and the sky were peopledwith countless beings, visible and invisible, which were held to be friendly or unfriendlyto man according as the operations of nature, which they were supposed to direct, werefavourable or unfavourable to him. In -nature and attributes these beings were thought byprimitive man to closely resemble himself and to possess all human passions, andemotions, and weaknesses, and defects; and the chief object of magic was to give man thepre-eminence over such beings. The favour of the beings who were placable and friendlyto man might be obtained by means of gifts and offerings, but the cessation of hostilitieson the part of those that were implacable and unfriendly could only be obtained bywheedling, andp. ixcajolery, and flattery, or by making use of an amulet, or secret name, or magical formula,or figure, or picture which had the effect of bringing to the aid of the mortal whopossessed it the power of a being that was mightier than the foe who threatened to do evilto him. The magic of most early nations aimed at causing the transference of power froma supernatural being to man, whereby he was to be enabled to obtain superhuman results"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and to become for a time as mighty as the original possessor of the power; but the objectof Egyptian magic was to endow man with the means of compelling both friendly andhostile powers, nay, at a later time, even God Himself, to do what he wished, whether thewere willing or not. The belief in magic, the word being used in its best sense, is older inEgypt than the belief in God, and it is certain that a very large number of the Egyptianreligious ceremonies, which were performed in later times as an integral part of a highlyspiritual worship, had their origin in superstitious customs which date from a period whenGod, under any name or in any form, was unconceived in the minds of the Egyptians.Indeed it is probable that even the use of the sign which represents an axe, and whichstands the hieroglyphic character both for God and \"god,\" indicates that this weapon and.tool was employed in thep. xperformance of some ceremony connected with religious magic in prehistoric, or at anyrate in predynastic times, when it in some mysterious way symbolized the presence of asupreme Power. But be this as it may, it is quite certain that magic and religion developedand flourished side by side in Egypt throughout all periods of her history, and that anyinvestigation which we may make of the one necessarily includes an examination of theother.From the religious books of ancient Egypt we learn that the power possessed by a priestor man who was skilled in the knowledge and working of magic was believed to bealmost boundless. By pronouncing certain words or names of power in the proper mannerand in the proper tone of voice he could heal the sick, and cast out the evil spirits whichcaused pain and suffering in those who were diseased, and restore the dead to life, andbestow upon the dead man the power to transform the corruptible into an incorruptiblebody, wherein the soul might live to all eternity. His words enabled human beings toassume divers forms at will, and to project their souls into animals and other creatures;and in obedience to his commands, inanimate figures and pictures became living beingsand things which hastened to perform his behests. The powers of nature acknowledgedhis might, and wind and rain,p. xistorm and tempest, river and sea, and disease and death worked evil and ruin upon hisfoes, and upon the enemies of those who were provided with the knowledge of the wordswhich he had wrested from the gods of heaven, and earth, and the underworld. Inanimatenature likewise obeyed such words of power, and even the world itself came intoexistence through the utterance of a word by Thoth; by their means the earth could berent asunder, and the waters forsaking their nature could be piled up in a heap, and eventhe sun's course in the heavens could be stayed by a word. No god, or spirit, or devil, orfiend, could resist words of power, and the Egyptians invoked their aid in the smallest aswell as in the greatest events of their lives. To him that was versed in the lore containedin the books of the \"double house of life\" the future was as well known as the past, andneither time nor distance could limit the operations of his power; the mysteries of life and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"death were laid bare before him, and he could draw aside the veil which hid the secrets offate and destiny from the knowledge of ordinary mortals.Now if views such as these concerning the magician's power were held by the educatedfolk of ancient Egypt there is little to wonder at when we find that beliefs andsuperstitions of the most degraded character flourished with rank luxuriance among thepeasantsp. xiiand working classes of that country, who failed to understand the symbolism of theelaborate ceremonies which were performed in the temples, and who were too ignorant todistinguish the spiritual conceptions which lay at their root--to meet the religious needs ofsuch people the magician, and in later times the priest, found it necessary to providepageants and ceremonies which appealed chiefly to the senses, and following theirexample, unscrupulous but clever men took advantage of the ignorance of the generalpublic and pretended to knowledge of the supernatural, and laid claim to the possessionof power over gods, and spirits, and demons. Such false knowledge and power they soldfor money, and for purposes of gain the so-called magician was ready to further anysordid transaction or wicked scheme which his dupe wished to carry out. This magicdegenerated into sorcery, and demonology, and wit craft, and those who dealt in it wereregarded as associates of the Devil, and servants of the powers of darkness, and workersof the \"black art.\" In the \"white\" and \"black\" magic of the Egyptians most of the magicknown in the other countries of the world may be found; it is impossible yet to sayexactly how much the beliefs and religious systems of other nations were influenced bythem, but there is no, doubt that certain views and religious ideas of many heathen andp. xiiiChristian sects may be traced directly to them. Many interesting proofs might be adducedin support of this statement, but the limits of this book will not admit of their being givenhere.When we consider the lofty spiritual character of the greater part of the Egyptian religion,and remember its great antiquity, it is hard to understand why the Egyptians carefullypreserved in their writings and ceremonies so much which savoured of gross and childishsuperstition, and which must have been the product of their predynastic or prehistoricancestors, even during the period of their greatest intellectual enlightenment. But the factremains that they did believe in One God Who was almighty, and eternal, and invisible,Who created the heavens, and the earth, and all beings and things therein; and in theresurrection of the body in a changed and glorified form, which would live to all eternityin the company of the spirits and souls of the righteous in a kingdom ruled by a beingwho was of divine origin, but who had lived upon the earth, and had suffered a crueldeath at the hands of his enemies, and had risen from the dead, and had become the Godand king of the world which is beyond the grave; and that, although they believed allthese things and proclaimed their belief with almost passionate earnestness, they seemnever to have freed themselves from a hankering"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"p. xivafter amulets and talismans, and magical names, and words of power, and seem to havetrusted in these to save their souls and bodies, both living and dead, with something of thesame confidence which they placed in the death and resurrection of Osiris. A matter forsurprise is that they seem to see nothing incongruous in such a mixture of magic andreligion, and the general attitude of the mind of the Egyptian on the point is wellillustrated by the following facts. Attached to the service of Râ, the Sun-god, at Thebeswere numerous companies of priests whose duties consisted as much in making copies ofreligious books and in keeping alive the \"divine traditions,\" as in ministering to the god intheir appointed seasons. The members of these companies who wrote the copies of theBook of the Dead which were buried with kings and queens and personages of royal orexalted rank declared the power and omnipotence of Almighty God, Whose visibleemblem to mankind was the Sun, and His sovereignty over things celestial and thingsterrestrial with no uncertain voice, and we should expect them to believe what theyproclaimed,i.e., that God was sufficiently powerful to protect His emblem in the sky. Yetthe priests of Thebes made copies of works which contained texts to be recited atspecified hours of the day and night, and gave directions for the performance ofp. xvmagical ceremonies, the avowed object of such being to prevent the mythical monsterÂpep from vanquishing the Sun-god. And it is stated in all seriousness that if a piece ofpapyrus upon which a figure of the monster has been drawn, and a wax figure of him beburnt in a fire made of a certain kind of grass, and the prescribed words be recited overthem as they burn, the Sun-god will be delivered from Âpep, and that neither rain, norcloud, nor mist shall be able to prevent his light from falling upon the earth. Moreover,the rubric describes the performance of the ceremony as a meritorious act!E. A.

The facts ofthis statement were derived wholly from native religious works, the latest of which issome thousands of years old, and the earliest of which may be said to possess an antiquityof between six and seven thousand years; the extracts quoted in support of the deductionsset forth in it were intended to enable the reader to judge for himself as to the generalaccuracy of the conclusions there given. Many writers on the Egyptian religion havesomewhat blinked the fact that it had two sides; on the one it closely resembles in.p. 2many respects the Christian religion of to-day, and on the other the religion of many ofthe sects which flourished in the first three or four centuries of our era, and which may besaid to have held beliefs which were part Christian and part non-Christian. In its non-Christian aspect it represents a collection of ideas and superstitions which belong to asavage or semi-savage state of existence, and which maintained their hold in a degreeupon the minds of the Egyptians long after they had advanced to a high state ofcivilization. We may think that such ideas and beliefs are both childish and foolish, butthere is no possible reason for doubting that they were very real things to those who heldthem, and whether they are childish or foolish or both they certainly passed into thereligion of the people of Egypt, wherein they grew and flourished, and were, at leastmany of them, adopted by the Egyptian converts to Christianity, or Copts. Reference ismade to them in the best classical works of the ancient Egyptians, and it is more thanprobable that from them they found their way into the literatures of the other greatnations of antiquity, and through the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and others into thecountries of Europe. In the following pages an attempt will be made to place in thereader's hands the evidence as to the magical side of the Egyptian religion, which wouldhave been out of place in the former work, the object of which was to describe beliefs ofa more spiritual nature. But, asp. 3"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"in the book on the Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life, the facts here given are drawn frompapyri and other native documents, and the extracts are quoted from compositions whichwere actually employed by the Egyptians to produce magical effects.The \"magic\" of the Egyptians was of two kinds: (1) that which was employed forlegitimate purposes and with the idea of benefiting either the living or the dead, and (2)that which was made use of in the furtherance of nefarious plots and schemes and wasintended to bring calamities upon those against whom it was directed. In the religioustexts and works we see how magic is made to be the handmaiden of religion, and how itappears in certain passages side by side with the most exalted spiritual conceptions; andthere can be no doubt that the chief object of magical books and ceremonies was tobenefit those who had by some means attained sufficient knowledge to make use of them.But the Egyptians were unfortunate enough not to be understood by many of the strangerswho found their way into their country, and as a result wrong and exaggerated ideas oftheir religion were circulated among the surrounding nations, and the magical ceremonieswhich were performed at their funerals were represented by the ignorant either as sillyacts of superstition or as tricks of the \"black\" art. But whereas the magic of every othernation of the ancient East was directed entirely against the powers of darkness, and wasp. 4invented in order to frustrate their fell designs by invoking a class of benevolent beings totheir aid, the Egyptians aimed being able to command their gods to work for them, and tocompel them to appear at their desire. These great results were to be obtained by the useof certain words which, to be efficacious, must be uttered in a proper tone of voice by aduly qualified man; such words might be written upon some substance, papyrus, preciousstones, and the like, and worn on the person, when their effect could be transmitted to anydistance. As almost every man, woman, and child in Egypt who could afford it woresome such charm or talisman, it is not to be wondered at that the Egyptians were at a veryearly period regarded as a nation of magicians and sorcerers. Hebrew, and Greek, andRoman writers referred to them as experts in the occult sciences, and as the possessors ofpowers which could, according to circumstances, be employed to do either good or harmto man.From the Hebrews we receive, incidentally, it is true, considerable information about thepowers of the Egyptian magician. Saint Stephen boasts that the great legislator Moses\"was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,\" and declares that he \"was mighty inwords and in deeds,\"1 and there are numerous features in the life of this remarkable manwhich shew that he was acquainted with many of the practices ofp. 5Egyptian magic. The phrase \"mighty in words\" probably means that, like the goddessIsis, he was \"strong of tongue\" and uttered the words of power which he knew withcorrect pronunciation, and halted not in his speech, and was perfect both in giving thecommand and in saying the word. The turning of a serpent into what is apparently aninanimate, wooden stick,1 and the turning of the stick back into a writhing snake,2 are"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"feats which have been performed in the East from the most ancient period; and the powerto control and direct the movements of such venomous reptiles was one of the things ofwhich the Egyptian was most proud, and in which he was most skilful, already in the timewhen the pyramids were being built. But this was by no means the only proof whichMoses gives that he was versed in the magic of the Egyptians, for, like the sage Âba-anerand king Nectanebus, and all the other magicians of Egypt from time immemorial, he andAaron possessed a wonderful rod3 by means of which they worked their wonders. At theword of Moses Aaron lifted up his rod and smote the waters and they became blood; hestretched it outp. 6over the waters, and frogs innumerable appeared; when the dust was smitten by the rod itbecame lice; and so on. Moses sprinkled ashes \"toward heaven,\" and it became boils andblains upon man and beast; he stretched out his rod, and there was \"hail, and fire mingledwith the hail, very grievous,\" and the \"flax and the barley was smitten;\" he stretched outhis rod and the locusts came, and after them the darkness. Now Moses did all thesethings, and brought about the death of the firstborn among the Egyptians by the commandof his God, and by means of the words which He told him to speak. But although we aretold by the Hebrew writer that the Egyptian magicians could not imitate all the miraclesof Moses, it is quite certain that every Egyptian magician believed that he could performthings equally marvellous by merely uttering the name of one of his gods, or through thewords of power which he had learned to recite; and there are many instances on record ofEgyptian magicians utterly destroying their enemies by the recital of a few wordspossessed of magical power, and, by the performance of some, apparently, simpleceremony.1 But one great distinction must be made between the magic of Moses and thatof the Egyptians among whom he lived; the former was wrought by the command of theGod of the Hebrews, but the latter by the gods of Egypt at the command of man.p. 7Later on in the history of Moses' dealings with the Egyptians we find the account of how\"he stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord caused the sea to goback by astrong east wind all that night, and made the sea dryland, and the waters were divided.And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dryground; and thewaterswere a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.\" When the Egyptianshad come between the two walls of water, by God's command Moses stretched forth hishand over the sea, \"and the sea returned to his strength,\" and the \"waters returned, andcovered the chariots, and the horsemen,and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the seaafter them.\"1 But the command of the waters of the sea or river was claimed by theEgyptian magician long before the time of Moses, as we may see from an interestingstory preserved in the Westcar Papyrus.2 This document was written in the early part ofthe XVIIIth dynasty, about B.C. 1550 but it is clear that the stories in it date from theEarly Empire, and are in fact as old as the Great Pyramid. The story is related to kingKhufu (Cheops) by Baiu-f-Râ as an event which happened in the time of the king's father,and as a proof of the wonderful powers of magic which were possessed by the priest3called"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"p. 8Tchatcha-em-ânkh. It seems that on a certain day king Seneferu was in low spirits, and heapplied to the nobles of his royal household expecting that they would find some meanswhereby his heart might be made glad; but as they could do nothing to cheer up the king,he gave orders that the priest and writer of books, Tchatcha-em-ânkh, should be broughtinto his presence immediately, and in accordance with the royal command he was at oncebrought. When he had arrived, Seneferu said to him, \"My brother, I turned to the noblesof my royal household seeking for some means whereby I might cheer my heart, but theyhave found nothing for me.\" Then the priest made answer and advised the king to betakehimself to the lake near the palace, and to go for a sail on it in a boat which had beencomfortably furnished with things from the royal house. \"For,\" said he, \"the heart of thyMajesty will rejoice and be glad when thou sailest about hither and thither, and dost seethe beautiful thickets which are on the lake, and when thou seest the pretty banks thereofand the beautiful fields then shall thy heart feel happiness.\" He next begged that the kingwould allow him to organize the journey, and asked his permission to let him bringtwenty ebony paddles inlaid with gold, and also twenty young virgins having beautifulheads of hair and lovely forms and shapely limbs, and twenty nets wherein these virginsmay array themselves instead of in their own ordinaryp. 9garments. The virgins were to row and sing to his Majesty. To these proposals the kingassented, and when all was ready he took his place in the boat; while the young womenwere rowing him about hither and thither the king watched them, and his heart becamereleased from care. Now as one of the young women was rowing, she entangled herself insome way in her hair, and one of her ornaments which was made of \"new turquoise\" fellinto the water and sank; she ceased to row, and not herself only, but all the other maidensceased to row also. When the king saw that the maidens had ceased from their work, hesaid to them, \"Will ye not row?\" and they replied, \"Our leader has ceased to row.\" Thenturning to the maiden who had dropped her ornament overboard, he asked her why shewas not rowing, whereupon she told him what had happened. On this the king promisedthat he would get back the ornament for her.Then the king commanded that Tchatcha-em-ânkh should appear before him at once, andas soon as the sage had been brought into his presence he said to him, \"O Tchatcha-em-ânkh, my brother, I have done according to thy words, and the heart of my Majestybecame glad when I saw how the maidens rowed. But now, an ornament which is madeof new turquoise and belongeth to one of the maidens who row hath fallen into the water,and she hath in consequence become silent, and hath ceased to row, and hath disturbedthep. 10rowing of those in her company. I said to her, 'Why dost thou not row?' and she replied,'An ornament [of mine] made of new turquoise hath fallen into the water.' Then I said toher, 'I will get it back for thee.'\" Thereupon the priest and writer of books Tchatcha-em-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ânkh spake certain words of power (hekau), and having thus caused one section of thewater of the lake to go up upon the other, he found the ornament lying upon a pot-sherd,and he took it and gave it to the maiden. Now the water was twelve cubits deep, but whenTchatcha-em-ânkh had lifted up one section of the water on to the other, that portionbecame four and twenty cubits deep. The magician again uttered certain words of power,and the water of the lake became as it had been before he had caused one portion of it togo up on to the other; and the king prepared a feast for all his royal household, andrewarded Tchatcha-em-ânkh with gifts of every kind. Such is a story of the powerpossessed by a magician in the time of king Khufu (Cheops), who reigned at thebeginning of the IVth dynasty, about B.C. 3800. The copy of the story which we possessis older than the period when Moses lived, and thus there can be no possibility of ourseeing in it a distorted version of the miracle of the waters of the sea standing like walls,one on the right hand and one on the left; on the other hand Moses' miracle may wellhave some connexion with that of Tchatcha-em-ânkh.p. 11Among the Greeks and Romans considerable respect was entertained, not only for the\"wisdom\" of the Egyptians, but also for the powers of working magic which they weresupposed to possess. The Greek travellers who visited Egypt brought back to their owncountry much information concerning its religion and civilization, and, though theymisunderstood many things which they saw and heard there, some of the greatest ofthinkers among the Greeks regarded that country not only as the home of knowledge andthe source of civilization and of the arts, but also as the fountain head of what has beencalled \"white magic,\" and the \"black art.\" In some respects they exaggerated the powersof the, Egyptians, but frequently when the classical writers were well informed they onlyascribed to them the magical knowledge which the Egyptian magicians themselvesclaimed to possess. A striking instance of this is given in the second book of theMetamorphoses of Apuleius where, it will be remembered, the following is narrated. Thestudent Telephron arrived one day at Larissa, and as he was wandering about in an almostpenniless condition he saw an old man standing on a large block of stone issuing aproclamation to the effect that any one who would undertake to guard a dead body shouldreceive a good reward. When Telephron asked if dead men were in the habit of runningaway the old man replied testily to the effect that the witches all over Thessaly usedp. 12to tear off pieces of flesh from the faces of the dead with their teeth, in order to makemagical spells by means of them, and to prevent this dead bodies must needs be watchedat night. The young man then asked what his duties would be if he undertook the post,and he was told that he would have to keep thoroughly awake all night, to gaze fixedlyupon the dead body, to look neither to the right hand nor to the left, and not to close theeyes even to wink. This was absolutely necessary because the witches were able to getout of their skins and to take the form of a bird, or dog, or mouse, and their craftiness wassuch that they could take the forms of flies and cast sleep upon the watcher. If thewatcher relaxed his attention and the body became mutilated by the witches, the pieces offlesh torn away would have to be made good from the body of the watcher Telephron"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"agreed to undertake the duty for one thousand nummi, and was led by the old man to ahouse, and, having been taken into the room where the dead body was, found a manmaking notes on tablets to the effect that nose, eyes, ears, lips, chin, etc., were untouchedand whole. Having been provided with a lamp and some oil that night he began hiswatch, and all went well, notwithstanding that he was greatly afraid, until the dead ofnight when a weasel came into the chamber and looked confidingly at the watcher; but hedrove the animal--which was no doubt a witch--from the room, and then fell fastp. 13asleep. In the early morning he was suddenly wakened by the trumpets of the soldiers,and almost immediately the widow of the dead man came to him with seven witnesses,and began to examine the body to see if it was intact; finding that no injury had beendone to it she ordered her steward to pay Telephron his fee, and was so grateful to himthat she promised to make him one of her household. In attempting to express his thanks,however, he made use of some inauspicious words, and immediately the servants of thehouse fell upon him, and buffeted him, and plucked out his hair by the roots, and tore hisclothes, and finally cast him out of the house. Soon afterwards, whilst wandering about,he saw the funeral procession pass through the forum, and at that moment an old manwent to the bier, and with sobs and tears accused the widow of poisoning his nephew sothat she might inherit his property and marry her lover. Presently the mob which hadgathered together wanted to set her house on fire, and some people began to stone her;the small boys also threw stones at her. When she had denied the accusation, and hadcalled upon the gods to be witnesses of her innocence, the old man cried out, \"Let, then,Divine Providence decide the truth, in answer to her denial. Behold, the famous prophetZaclas the Egyptian, dwelleth among us, and he hath promised me that for much moneyhe will make the soul of the dead man to return from the place of deathp. 14in the underworld, and to make it to dwell in his body again for a short time.\" With thesewords, he led forward a man dressed in linen, and wearing palm-leaf sandals, who, likeall the Egyptian priests, had his head shaved, and having kissed his hands and embracedhis legs he implored him by the stars, and by the gods of the underworld, and by theisland of the Nile, and by the Inundation, etc., to restore life to the dead body, if only forthe smallest possible time, so that the truth of his accusation against the widow might beproved. Thus adjured Zaclas touched the mouth and the breast of the dead man threetimes with some plant, and having turned his face to the East and prayed, the lungs of thecorpse began to fill with breath, and his heart to beat, and raising his head and shouldershe asked why he had been called back to life, and then he begged to be allowed to rest inpeace. At this moment Zaclas addressed him, and telling him that he had the power,through his prayers, to cause the fiends to come and torture him, ordered, him to makeknown the means by which he had died. With a groan he replied that the wife whom hehad recently married gave him poison to drink, and that he died in consequence. The wifeat once contradicted the words of her husband, and of the people who were standinground some took one side and some another. At length the husband declared that hewould prove the truth of his own words, and pointing to Telephron,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"p. 15who had attempted to guard his body, told those present that the witches after makingmany attempts to elude his vigilance had cast deep sleep upon him. They next calledupon himself by his name, which happened to be Telephron, like that of his watcher, andwhilst he was endeavouring feebly to obey their spells, his watcher rose up unconsciouslyand walked about. Seeing this the witches forced their way into the room through someunknown place, and having taken off the nose and ears of the watcher they placed modelsof these members in their places. Those who heard these words looked fixedly at theyoung man, who at once put up his hands and touched the members, whereupon his nosecame off in his hand, and his cars slipped through his fingers on to the ground.The end of the story does not concern us, and so we pass on to note that the act oftouching the mouth which Zaclas performed is, of course, a part of the ceremony of\"opening the mouth\" which is so often referred to in religious texts, and was consideredof extreme importance for the welfare of the dead,1 and that the power of bringing backthe dead to life which Apuleius ascribes to the priest or magician was actually claimedsome thousands of years before Christ by the sages of Egypt, as we may see from thefollowing story in the Westcar Papyrus.A son of king Khufu (or Cheops, who reigned aboutp. 16[paragraph continues] B.C. 3800) called Herutâtâf, who was famous as a learned man and whosename is preserved in the \"Book of the Dead\" in connection with the \"discovery\" ofcertain Chapters of that wonderful compilation,1 was one day talking to his father,presumably on the subject of the powers of working magic possessed by the ancients. Inanswer to some remark by Khufu he replied, \"Up to the present thou hast only heardreports concerning the things which the men of olden time knew, and man knoweth notwhether they are true or not; but now I will cause thy Majesty to see a sage in thine owntime, and one who knoweth thee not.\" In reply to Khufu's question, \"Who is this man, OHerutâtâf?\" the young man replied, \"It is a certain man called Teta, who dwelleth in Tet-Seneferu, and is one hundred and ten years old, and to this very day he eateth fivehundred loaves of bread, and the shoulder of an ox, and he drinketh one hundredmeasures of ale. He knoweth how to fasten on again to its body a head that hath been cutoff; he knoweth how to make a lion follow him whilst his snare is trailing on the ground;and he knoweth the number of theaptet of the sanctuary of Thoth.\" Now Khufu had for along time past sought out the aptet of the sanctuary of Thoth, because he was anxious tomake one similar for his own \"horizon.\" Though at the present it is impossible to saywhat thep. 17aptet was, it is quite clear that it was an object or instrument used in connection with theworking of magic of some sort, and it is clear that the king was as much interested in thepursuit as his subjects. In reply to his son's words Khufu told him to go and bring the sage"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"into his presence, and the royal barge or boat having been brought, Herutâtâf set out forthe place where the sage dwelt. Having sailed up the river some distance he and his partyarrived at Tet-Seneferu, and when the boats had been tied to the quay the prince set out toperform the rest of the Journey, which was overland, in a sort of litter made of ebony,which was borne by men by means of poles ofsesnetchem wood, inlaid with gold. Whenhe had arrived at the abode of Teta, the litter was set down upon the ground, and theprince came out to greet the sage, whom he found lying upon a basket-work bed ormattress, which had been placed for him in the courtyard of his house, whilst one servantshampooed his head, and another rubbed his feet. After a suitable greeting and referenceto the sage's honourable condition had been made, Herutâtâf told him that he had comefrom a great distance in order to bring to him a message from Khufu his father, and thesage bade him \"Welcome\" heartily, and prophesied that Khufu would greatly exalt hisrank. The greetings ended, Herutâtâf assisted Teta to rise, and the old man set out for thequay leaning upon the arm of the king's son,p. 18and when he had arrived there he asked that a boat might be provided for the transport ofhis children and his books. Two boats were at once prepared and filled with theircomplement of sailors, and Teta sailed down the Nile with Herutâtâf, while his familyfollowed.After a time the party arrived at Khufu's palace, and Herutâtâf went into the presence ofhis father, and reported to him that he had brought Teta the sage for him to see; Khufugave orders that he was to be brought before him quickly, and having gone forth into thecolonnade of the palace, Teta was led in to him. Khufu said to him, \"How is it, Teta, thatI have never seen thee?\" and the sage replied, \"O Prince, he who is called cometh; andsince thou hast called me, behold, here I am.\" Khufu said to him, \"Is it true, according towhat is reported, that thou knowest how to fasten on again to its body the head whichhath been cut off?\" and the sage replied, \"Yea, verily, O my lord the Prince, I do knowhow to do this thing.\" And Khufu said, \"Let a captive who is shut up in prison be broughtto me so that I may inflict his doom upon him,\" but Teta made answer, \"Nay, my lord theking let not this thing be performed upon man, but upon some creature that belongeth tothe sacred animals.\" Then some one brought to him a goose, and having cut off its head,he laid the body of the goose on the west side of the colonnade, and the head on the eastside. Teta then stood up and spake certain words of magical power,p. 19whereupon the body began to move and the head likewise, and each time that they movedthe one came nearer to the other, until at length the head moved to its right place on thebird, which straightway cackled. After this Teta had akhet-âa bird brought to him, andupon it he performed the same miracle which he had wrought upon the goose; and toprove that he had similar power over the animal creation, an ox was brought to him, andhaving cut off its head, which fell upon the ground, he uttered words of magical power,and the ox stood up and lived as before."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The two stories from the Westcar Papyrus given above are sufficient to prove that alreadyin the IVth dynasty the working of magic was a recognized art among the Egyptians, andeverything we learn from later texts indicates that it is well-nigh impossible to imagine atime in Egypt when such was not the case. But the \"wisdom\" of the Egyptians was of twokinds, that is to say, they were possessed of the two kinds of \"wisdom\" which enabledthem to deal with both the material world and the spiritual world; the nations around,however, confused the two kinds, and misunderstood matters in consequence.One of the oldest names of Egypt is \"Kamt\" or \"Qemt,\" a word which means \"black\" or\"dusky,\" and it was applied to the country on account of the dark colour of the mudwhich forms the land on each side of the Nile; the Christian Egyptians or Coptsp. 20transmitted the word under the form Khême to the Greeks, Romans, Syrians, and Arabs.At a very early period the Egyptians were famous for their skill in the working of metalsand in their attempts to transmute them, and, according to Greek writers, they employedquicksilver in the processes whereby they separated the metals gold and silver from thenative ore. From these processes there resulted a \"black\" powder or substance which wassupposed to possess the most marvellous powers, and to contain in it the individualitiesof the various metals; and in it their actual substances were incorporated. In a mysticalmanner this \"black\" powder was identified with the body which the god Osiris wasknown to possess in the underworld, and to both were attributed magical qualities, andboth were thought to be sources of life and power. Thus, side by side with the growth ofskill in performing the ordinary, processes of metal-working, in Egypt, there grew up inthat country the belief that magical powers existed in fluxes and alloys; and the art ofmanipulating the metals, and the knowledge of the chemistry of the metals and of theirmagical powers were described by, the name \"Khemeia.\" that is to say \"the preparation ofthe black ore\" (or \"powder\") which was regarded as the transmutation of metals. To thisname the Arabs affixed the articleal, and thus we obtain the word Al-Khemeia, orAlchemy, which will perpetuatep. 21the reputation of the Egyptians as successful students both of \"white magic\" and of the\"black\" art.But in addition to their skill as handicraftsmen and artisans the Egyptians were skilled inliterary composition, and in the production of books, especially of that class whichrelated to the ceremonies which were performed for the benefit of the dead. We have,unfortunately, no means of knowing what early contemporary peoples thought of theEgyptian funeral ceremonies, but it seems to be certain that it was chiefly by means ofthese that they obtained their reputation as workers of miracles. If by chance anymembers of a desert tribe had been permitted to behold the ceremonies which wereperformed when the kings for whom the Pyramids had been built were laid to rest inthem., the stories that they took back to their kinsmen would be received as sure proofsthat the Egyptians had the power to give life to the dead, to animate statues, and to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"command the services of their gods by the mere utterance of their names as words ofpower. The columns of hieroglyphics with which the walls of the tombs were oftencovered, and the figures of the gods, painted or sculptured upon stelæ or sarcophagi,would still further impress the barbarian folk who always regard the written letter andthose who understand it with great awe. The following story from Mas'ûdî1 will illustratethe views which the Arabsp. 22held concerning the inscriptions and figures of gods in the temples of Egypt. It seems thatwhen the army of Pharaoh had been drowned in the Red Sea, the women and slavesfeared lest they should be attacked by the kings of Syria and the West; in this difficultythey elected a woman called Dalûkah as their queen, because she was wise and prudentand skilled in magic. Dalûkah's first act was to surround all Egypt with a wall, which sheguarded by men who were stationed along it at short intervals, her object being as muchto protect her son, who was addicted to the chase, from the attacks of wild beasts asEgypt from invasion by nomad tribes; besides this she placed round the enclosure figuresof crocodiles and other formidable animals. During the course of her reign of thirty yearsshe filled Egypt with her temples and with figures of animals; she also made figures ofmen in the form of the dwellers in the countries round about Egypt, and in Syria, and inthe West, and of the beasts which they rode. In the temples she collected all the secrets ofnature and all the attracting or repelling powers which were contained in minerals, plants,and animals. She performed her sorceries at the moment in the revolution of the celestialbodies when they would be amenable to a higher power. And it came to pass that if anarmy set out from any part of Arabia or Syria to attack Egypt, the queen made the figuresof its soldiers and of the animalsp. 23which they were riding to disappear beneath the ground, and the same fate immediatelyovertook the living creatures which they represented, wherever they might be on theirjourney, and the destruction of the figures on sculptures entailed the destruction of thehostile host. In brief, the large figures of the gods which were sculptured or painted onthe walls, and the hieroglyphic inscriptions which accompanied them, were considered bythose who could neither understand nor read them to be nothing more nor less thanmagical figures and formulæ which were intended to serve as talismans.The historian Mas'ûdî mentions1 an instance of the powers of working magic possessedby a certain Jew, which proves that the magical practices of the Egyptians had passedeastwards and had found a congenial home among the Jews who lived in and aboutBabylon. This man was a native of the village of Zurârah in the district of Kûfa, and heemployed his time in working magic. In the Mosque at Kûfa, and in the presence ofWalîd ibn Ukbah, he raised up several apparitions, and made a king of huge stature, whowas mounted upon a horse, gallop about in the courtyard of the Mosque. He thentransformed himself into a camel and walked upon a rope; and made the phantom of anass to pass through his body; and"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"p. 24finally having slain a man, he cut off the head and removed it from the trunk, and then bypassing his sword over the two parts, they united and the man came alive again. This lastact recalls the joining of the head of the dead goose to its body and the coming back ofthe bird to life which has been described above.We have now to describe briefly the principal means upon which the Egyptians relied forworking magic, that is to say, magical stones or amulets, magical figures, magicalpictures and formulæ, magical names, magical ceremonies, etc., and such portions of theBook of the Dead as bear upon these subjects generally.FootnotesFootnotes1:1 The series referred to is Books on Egypt and Chaldaea, published by Kegan Paul.

The word \"amulet\" isderived from an Arabic root meaning \"to bear, to carry,\" hence \"amulet\" is \"somethingwhich is carried or worn,\" and the name is applied broadly to any kind of talisman orornament to which supernatural powers are ascribed. It is not clear whether the amuletwas intended first of all to protect the living or the dead body, but it seems that it wasoriginally worn to guard its owner from savage animals and from serpents. As time wenton the development of religious ideas and beliefs progressed, and as a result new amuletsrepresenting new views were invented; and the objects which were able to protect theliving were made, by an easy transitionp. 26in the minds of those who wore them, to protect the dead. Moreover, as the preservationof the corruptible body, with the number of its members complete and intact, was of themost vital importance for the life of the spiritual and incorruptible body which wasbelieved to spring therefrom, under the influence of the new beliefs the dead bodybecame a veritable storehouse of amulets. Each member was placed under the specificprotection of some amulet, and a number of objects which were believed to protect thebody generally from serpents, worms, mildew, decay and putrefaction were laid with alavish hand in, and upon, and about it, and between the bandages with which it wasswathed. When men in Egypt began to lay amulets on their dead cannot be said, and it isequally impossible to say when the belief in the efficacy of such and such an amuletsprang into being; it seems clear, however, that certain amulets represent beliefs andsuperstitions so old that even the Egyptians were, at times, doubtful about their origin andmeaning.Amulets are of two kinds: (1) those which are inscribed with magical formulæ, and (2)those which are not. In the earliest times formulæ or prayers were recited over theamulets that were worn by the living or placed on the dead by priests or men set apart toperform religious services by the community; but it was not in the power of every man toemploy them, and at a comparatively early date words of magicalp. 27"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"power and prayers were cut upon the amulets, which thus became possessed of a twofoldpower, that is to say, the power which was thought to be inherent in the substance ofwhich the amulet was made, and that which lay in the words inscribed upon it. Theearliest name for the formulæ found upon amulets ishekau, and it was so necessary forthe deceased to be provided with these hekau, or \"words of power,\" that in the XVIthCentury B.C., and probably more than a thousand years earlier, a special section1 wasinserted in the Book of the Dead with the object of causing them to come to him fromwhatever place they were in, \"swifter than greyhounds and quicker than light.\" Theearliest Egyptian amulets known are pieces of green schist, of various shapes, animal. andotherwise, which were laid upon the breast of the deceased; these are found in largenumbers in the pre-historic or predynastic graves at several places in Egypt. It is mostunlikely that they were made by the aboriginal inhabitants of Egypt, for, notwithstandingthe various conjectures which have been made as to their object and use, it is prettycertain that, as M. J. de Morgan said,2 they \"belong to the cult.\" According to this writertheir use was exceedingly widespread until the end of the neolithic period, but with theadvent of thep. 28people whom we call Egyptians they become very rare. In the subsequent period theanimal forms disappear, and their place is taken by plaques of schist, rectangular inshape, upon which are inscribed, in rough outline, figures of animals, etc. The theory thatthese objects were intended as whetstones, or as slabs upon which to rub down paint, willnot hold, for the reasons which M. J. de Morgan has given. Moreover, in the green stonescarab which was laid upon the breast of the deceased in dynastic times, we probablyhave a survival of the green schist amulet of predynastic times in Egypt, both as regardsthe object with which it was made and the material. But the custom of writing hekau, orwords of power, upon papyrus is almost as old as that of writing them upon stone, and wesee from the inscription on the walls of the corridors and chambers of the pyramid ofUnas, king of Egypt about B.C. 3300, that a \"book with words of magical power\" wasburied with him.1 Elsewhere2 we are told that the book which Teta, king of Egypt aboutB.C. 3266, had with him \"hath effect upon the heart of the gods\"; and there is no doubtthat the object of every religious text ever written on tomb, stele, amulet, coffin, papyrus,etc., was to bring the gods under the power of the deceased, so that he might be able tocompel them to do his will.p. 291. THE AMULET OF THE HEART,The heart was not only the seat of the power of life, but also the source of both good andevil thoughts; and it sometimes typified the conscience. It was guarded after death withspecial care, and was mummified separately, and then, with the lungs, was preserved in ajar which was placed under the protection of the god Tuamutef. Its preservation wasconsidered to be of such importance that a text1 was introduced into the Book of the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Dead at an early period, with the view of providing the deceased with a heart in the placeof that which had been removed in the process of mummification. The text reads:--\"May my heart be with me in the House of Hearts! May my breast2 be with me in theHouse of Hearts! May my heart be with me, and may it rest there, or I shall not eat of thecakes of Osiris on the eastern side of the Lake of Flowers, neither shall I have a boatwherein to go down the Nile, nor another wherein to go up, nor shall I be able to saildown the Nile with thee. May my mouth [be given] to me that I may speak therewith, andmy two legs to walk therewith, and my two hands and arms to overthrow my foe. Maythe doors of heaven be opened unto me; may Seb, the prince of the gods, open wide hisp. 30two jaws unto me; may he open my two eyes which are blindfolded; may he cause me tostretch apart my two legs which are bound together; and may Anpu (Anubis) make mythighs to be firm so that I may stand upon them. May the goddess Sekhet make me to riseso that I may ascend into heaven, and may that which I command in the House of the Kaof Ptah be done. I shall understand with my heart, I shall gain the mastery over my heart,I shall gain the mastery over my two hands, I shall gain the mastery over my legs, I shallhave the power to do whatsoever myka (i.e., double) pleaseth. My soul shall not befettered to my body at the gates of the underworld, but I shall enter in and come forth inpeace.\"When the deceased had uttered these words, it was believed that he would at once obtainthe powers which he wished to possess in the next world; and when he had gained themastery over his heart, the heart, the double, and the soul had the power to go where theywished and to do what they pleased. The mention of the god Ptah and of his consortSekhet indicates that the Chapter was the work of the priests of Memphis, and that theideas embodied in it are of great antiquity. According to the Papyrus of Nekhtu-Amen,the amulet of the heart, which is referred to in the above Chapter, was to be made oflapis-lazuli, and there is no doubt that this stone was believed top. 31possess certain qualities which were beneficial to those who wore it. It will also beremembered that, according to one tradition,1 the text of the LXIVth Chapter of the Bookof the Dead was found written in letters of lapis-lazuli in the reign of Hesep-ti, king ofEgypt about B.C. 4300, and the way in which the fact is mentioned in the Rubric to theChapter proves that special importance was attached to it."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Nefer-uben-f, a priest, guarding his heart against the destroyer of hearts.(From Naville, Todtenbuch, vol.

To prevent such a calamity no less than seven Chapters of the Book of theDead (Nos. XXVII., XXVIII., XXIX., XXIXA, XXX., XXXA,p. 32and XXXB) were written. The XXVIIth Chapter was connected with a heart amulet madeof a white, semi-transparent stone, and reads:--\"Hail, ye who carry away hearts! Hail, ye who steal hearts, and who make the heart of aman to go through its transformations according to its deeds, let not what he hath doneharm him before you! Homage to you, O ye lords of eternity, ye possessors of everlastingness, take ye not this heart of Osiris1 into your grasp, and cause ye not words ofevil to spring up against it; for it is the heart of Osiris, and it belongeth unto him of manynames,2 the mighty one whose words are his limbs, and who sendeth forth his heart todwell in his body. The heart of Osiris is triumphant, and it is made new before the gods:he hath gained power over it, and he hath not been judged according to what he hathdone. He hath gotten power over his own members. His heart obeyeth him, he is the lordthereof, it is in his body, and it shall never fall away therefrom. I, Osiris, victorious in"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"peace, and triumphant in the beautiful Amenta and on the mountain of eternity, bid thee[O heart] to be obedient unto me in the underworld.\"Another Chapter (XXIXB) was connected with a heart amulet made of carnelian, ofwhich so many examples may be found in large museums; the textp. 33reads: \"I am the Bennu,1 the soul of Râ, and the guide of the gods who are in theunderworld. Their divine souls came forth upon earth to do the will of their doubles, lettherefore the soul of the Osiris come forth to do the will of his double.\" The Bennu wasalso the soul of Osiris, and thus the amulet brought with it the protection of both Osirisand Râ.But of all the Chapters which related to the heart, the most popular among the Egyptianswas that which is commonly known as XXXB, and its importance from a religious pointof view cannot be overstated. The antiquity of the Chapter is undoubted, for according tothe Papyrus of Nu,2 a document of the early part of the XVIIIth dynasty, it dates from thetime of Hesep-ti, king of Egypt about B.C. 4300, and it seems that it formed a pendant orsupplement to the LXIVth Chapter, which professed to give the substance of all the\"Chapters of Coming Forth by Day\" in a single Chapter. In the rubric to the longerversion of the Chapter, given in the same papyrus,3 Chapter XXXB is connected withHerutâtâf, the son of Khufu (Cheops), a man famed for wisdom, and it is there orderedthat the words of it be recited over a hard, green stone scarab, which shall be laid in thebreast of the deceased where the heart would ordinarily be; this amulet would thenperform for him the \"opening of thep. 34mouth,\"1 for the words of the Chapter would be indeed \"words of power.\" From recitingthe words of the Chapter over a scarab to engraving them upon it was but a step, and thisstep was taken as early as the IVth dynasty. The text is as follows:--\"My heart, my mother; my heart, my mother! My heart whereby I came into being! Maynaught stand up to oppose me at [my] judgment; may there be no opposition to me in thepresence of the sovereign princes; may there be no parting of thee from me in thepresence of him that keepeth the Balance! Thou art my double (ka), the dweller in mybody, the god Khnemu who knitteth and strengtheneth my limbs. Mayest thou come forthinto the place of happiness whither we go. May theShenit, who form the conditions ofthe lives of men, not make my name to stink. Let it be satisfactory unto us, and let thelistening be satisfactory unto us, and let there be joy of heart unto us at the weighing ofwords. Let not that which is false be uttered against me before the great god, the lord ofAmentet. Verily how great shalt thou be when thou risest in triumph.\"It was this Chapter which the deceased recited when he was in the Judgment Hall ofOsiris, whilst his heart was being weighed in the Balance against the feather symbolic ofright and truth. From certain papyri it seems as if the above words should, properly,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"p. 35be said by the deceased when he is being weighed against his own heart, a conceptionwhich is quite different from that of the judgment of the heart before the gods.The scribe Nebsent being weighed in a balance against his heart in the presence of Osiris.(From the Papyrus of Nebseni, sheet 4.)2. THE AMULET OF THE SCARAB,From what has been said above it will be seen that the amulet of the heart, which wasconnected with the most important and most popular of the Chapters for protecting theheart, was directed to be made in the form of the scarab at a very early date. We can tracethe ideas which the Egyptians held about this insect as far back as the time of the buildingof the Pyramids,1 and there is no doubt that they represented beliefs which even at thatearly period were very old. Thep. 36Egyptian seems to have reasoned thus: since the physical heart is taken from the bodybefore mummification, and the body has need of another to act as the source of life andmovement in its new life, another must be put in its place. But a stone heart, whethermade of lapis-lazuli or carnelian, is only a stone heart after all, and even though by meansof prayers properly recited it prevents the physical heart from being carried off by \"thosewho plunder hearts,\" it possesses nothing of itself which can be turned to account ingiving new life and being to the body on which it lies. But the scarab or beetle itselfpossesses remarkable powers, and if a figure of the scarab be made, and the proper wordsof power be written upon it, not only protection of the dead physical heart, but also newlife and existence will be given to him to whose body it is attached. Moreover, the scarab"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"was the type and symbol of the god Khepera, the invisible power of creation whichpropelled the sun across the sky. The particular beetle chosen by the Egyptians to copyfor amulets belongs to the family of dung-feeding Lamellicorns which live in tropicalcountries. The species are generally of a black hue, but amongst them are to be foundsome adorned with the richest metallic colours. A remarkable peculiarity exists in thestructure and situation of the hind legs, which are placed so near the extremity of thebody, and so far from each other, as to give the insect a mostp. 37extraordinary appearance when walking. This peculiar formation is, nevertheless,particularly serviceable to its possessors in rolling the balls of excrementitious matter inwhich they enclose their eggs. These balls are at first irregular and soft, but, by degrees,and during the process of rolling along, become rounded and harder; they are propelledby means of the hind legs. Sometimes these balls are an inch and a half or two inches indiameter, and in rolling them along the beetles stand almost upon their beads, with theheads turned from the balls. These manœuvres have for their object the burying of theballs in holes, which the insects have previously dug for their reception; and it is upon thedung thus deposited that the larvæ, when hatched, feed. It does not appear that thesebeetles have the ability to distinguish their own balls, as they will seize upon thosebelonging to another, in the case of their having lost their own; indeed, it is said thatseveral of them occasionally assist in rolling the same ball. The males as well as thefemales assist in rolling the pellets. They fly during the hottest part of the day.1Among the ancients several curious views were held about the scarab, whether of thetypescarabæus sacer or theateuchus Ægyptiorium,2 and Ælian, Porphyry,p. 38and Horapollo declared that no female scarab existed. The last named writer stated thatthe scarab denoted \"only begotten,\" because it was a creature self-produced, beingunconceived by a female. He goes on to say that, having made a ball of dung, the beetlerolls it from east to west, and having dug a hole, he buries it in it for eight and twentydays; on the twenty-ninth day he opens the ball, and throws it into the water, and from itthe scarabæi come forth. The fact that the scarab flies during the hottest part of the daymade the insect to be identified with the sun, and the ball of eggs to be compared to thesun itself. The unseen power of God, made manifest under the form of the god Khepera,caused the sun to roll across the sky, and the act of rolling gave to the scarab its namekheper,i.e., \"he who rolls.\" The sun contained the germs of all life, and as the insect'sball contained the germs of the young scarabs it was identified also with the sun as acreature which produced life in a special way. Now, the god Khepera also representedinert but living matter, which was about to begin a course of existence, and at a very earlyperiod he was considered to be a god of the resurrection; and since the scarab wasidentified with him that insect became at once the symbol of the god and the type of theresurrection. But the dead human body, from one aspect, contained the germ of life, thatis to say, the germ of the spiritual body, which was called into being"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"p. 39by means of the prayers that were recited and the ceremonies that were performed on theday of the funeral; from this point of view the insect's egg ball and the dead body wereidentical. Now, as the insect had given potential life to its eggs in the ball, so, it wasthought, would a model of the scarab, itself the symbol of the god Khepera, also givepotential life to the dead body upon which it was placed, always provided that the proper\"words of power\" were first said over it or written upon it. The idea of \"life\" appears tohave attached itself to the scarab from time immemorial in Egypt and the Eastern Sûdân,for to this day the insect is dried, pounded, and mixed with water, and then drunk bywomen who believe it to be an unfailing specific for the production of large families. Inancient days when a man wished to drive away the effects of every kind of sorcery andincantations he might do so by cutting off the head and wings of a large beetle, which heboiled and laid in oil. The head and wings were then warmed up and steeped in the oil oftheâpnent serpent, and when they had been once more boiled the man was to drink themixture.1The amulet of the scarab has been found in Egypt in untold thousands, and the varietiesare exceedingly numerous. They are made of green basalt, greenp. 40granite, limestone, green marble, blue paste, blue glass, purple, blue and green glazedporcelain, etc.; and the words of power are usually cut in outline on the base. In rareinstances, the scarab has a human face or head, and sometimes the backs are inscribedwith figures of the boat of Râ, of theBennu bird, \"the soul of Râ,\" and of the eye ofHorus. The green stone scarabs are often set in gold, and have a band of gold across andThe scribe Ani holding a necklace with pectoral, on which is a figure of the boat of Râcontaining a scarab, or beetle, in the presence of Anubis, the god of the dead.

Occasionally the base of the scarab is made in the form of a heart, afact which proves the closeness of the relationship which existed between the amulets ofthe heart and scarab. In late times, that is to say about B.C. 1200,p. 41large funeral scarabs were set in pylon-shaped pectorals, made of porcelain of variouscolours, upon which the boat of the Sun was either traced in colours or worked in relief,and the scarab is placed so as to appear to be carried in the boat; on the left stands Isisand on the right Nephthys.1 The oldest green stone funeral scarab known to me is in theBritish Museum (No. 29,224); it was found at Kûrna near Thebes and belongs to theperiod of the XIth dynasty, about B.C. 2600. The name of the man for whom it was made(he appears to have been an official of the Temple of Amen) was traced on it in lightcoloured paint which was afterwards varnished; there are no \"words of power\" on thisinteresting object.When once the custom of burying scarabs with the bodies of the dead becamerecognized, the habit of wearing them as ornaments by the living came into fashion, andas a result scarabs of almost every sort and kind may be found by the thousand in manycollections, and it is probable that the number of varieties of them was only limited by theability of those who manufactured them in ancient days to invent new sorts. The use ofthe scarab amulet passed into Western Asia and into several countries which lay on theMediterranean, and those who wore it seem to have attached to it much the same idea asits early inventors, thep. 42Egyptians. From a Greek magical papyrus translated by Goodwin1 we may see thatcertain solemn ceremonies were performed over a scarab before it was worn, even in theperiod of the rule of the Greeks and Romans. Thus about the \"ring of Horus\" and the\"ceremony of the beetle\" we are told to take a beetle, sculptured as described below, andto place it on a paper table, and under the table there shall be a pure linen cloth; under itput some olive wood, and set on the middle of the table a small censer wherein myrrh andkyphi shall be offered. And have at hand a small vessel of chrysolite into which ointmentof lilies, or myrrh, or cinnamon, shall be put, and take the ring and lay it in the ointment,having first made it pure and clean, and offer it up in the censer with kyphi and myrrh;leave the ring for three days, and take it out and put it in a safe place. At the celebrationlet there lie near at hand some pure loaves, and such fruits as are in season, and havingmade another sacrifice upon vine sticks, during the sacrifice take the ring out of theointment, and anoint thyself with the unction from it. Thou shalt anoint thyself early inthe morning, and turning towards the east shalt pronounce the words written below. Thebeetle shall be carved out of a precious emerald; bore it and pass a gold wire through it,and beneath the beetle carve thep. 43"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"holy Isis, and having consecrated it as above written, use it. The proper days for thecelebration were the 7th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 21st, 24th, and 25th, from thebeginning of the month; on other days abstain.

THE AMULET OF THE BUCKLEThis amulet represents the buckle of the girdle of Isis, and is usually made of carnelian,red jasper, red glass, and of other substances of a red colour; it is sometimes made ofgold, and of substances covered with gold. It is always associated with the CLVIthChapter of the Book of the Dead, which is frequently inscribed upon it, and which reads:--\"The blood of Isis, and the strength of Isis, and the words of power of Isis shall be mightyto act as powers to protect this great and divine being, and to guard him from him thatwould do unto him anything that he holdeth in abomination.\"But before the buckle was attached to the neck of the deceased, where the rubric orderedit to be placed, it had to be dipped in water in whichânkham flowers had been steeped;and when the words of the Chapter of the Buckle given above had been recited over it,p. 44the amulet brought to the deceased the protection of the blood of Isis, and of her words ofpower. It will be remembered that she raised the dead body of Osiris by means of herwords of power, and there is a legend to the effect that she smote the Sun-god Râ withsevere sickness by the magical power which she possessed. Another object of the bucklewas to give the deceased access to every place in the underworld, and to enable him tohave \"one hand towards heaven, and one hand towards earth.\"4. THE AMULET OF THE TET.This amulet probably represents the tree trunk in which the goddess Isis concealed thedead body of her husband, and the four cross-bars indicate the four cardinal points; itbecame a symbol of the highest religious importance to the Egyptians, and the setting upof the Tet at Busiris, which symbolized the reconstituting of the body of Osiris, was oneof the most solemn of all the ceremonies performed in connexion with the worship of"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Osiris. The Tet represents neither the mason's table nor a Nilometer, as some havethought, It is always associated with the CLVth Chapter of the Book of the Dead, whichreads:--\"Rise up thou, O Osiris!

Oncoffins the right hand of the deceased grasps the buckle, and the left the Tet; both aremade of wood, notwithstanding the fact that the rubric to the Chapter of the Te orders theTet to be made of gold.5. THE AMULET OF THE PILLOW,This amulet is a model of the pillow which is found placed under the neck of the mummyin the coffin, and its object is to \"lift up\" and to protect the head of the deceased; it isusually made of hæmatite, and is inscribed with the text of the CLXVIth Chapter of theBook of the Dead, which reads:--\"Thou art lifted up, O sick one that liest prostrate. They lift up thy head to the horizon,thou art raised up, and dost triumph by reason of what hath been done for thee. Ptah hathoverthrown thine enemies, which was ordered to be done for thee. Thou art Horus, theson of Hathor, . . . who givest back the head after the slaughter. Thy head shall not becarried away from thee after [the slaughter], thy head shall never, never be carried awayfrom thee.\"p. 486. THE AMULET OF THE VULTURE,This amulet was intended to cause the power of Isis as the \"divine mother\" to be aprotection for the deceased, and was made of gold in the form of a vulture hovering in theair with outstretched wings and holding in each talon the symbol of \"life\"andwas placed on the neck on the day of the funeral. With this amulet the CLVIIth Chapterof the Book of the Dead was associated, and it was ordered by the rubric to it to berecited over it; this text reads:--\"Isis cometh and hovereth over the city, and she goeth about seeking the secrethabitations of Horus as he emergeth from his papyrus swamps, and she raiseth up his"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"shoulder which is in evil case. He is made one of the company in the divine boat, and thesovereignty of the whole world is decreed for him. He hath warred mightily, and hemaketh his deeds to be remembered; he hath made the fear of him to exist and awe of himto have its being. His mother the mighty lady, protecteth him, and she hath transferred herpower unto him.\" The first allusion is to the care which Isis shewed for Horus when shewas bringing him up in the papyrus swamps, and the second to his combat with Set,whom he vanquished through the might of Isis.p. 497. THE AMULET OF THE COLLAR OF GOLD,This amulet was intended to give the deceased power to free himself from his swathings;it is ordered by the rubric to the CLVIIIth Chapter of the Book of the Dead to be placedon his neck on the day of the funeral, and to be made of gold. The text of the Chapterreads:--\"O my father, my brother, my mother Isis, I am unswathed, and I see. I am one ofthose who are unswathed and who see the god Seb.\" This amulet is very rare, and appearsto have been the expression of beliefs which grew up in the period of the XXVIthdynasty, about B.C. 550.8. THE AMULET OF THE PAPYRUS SCEPTRE,This amulet was intended to give the deceased vigour and renewal of youth; it was madeof mother-of-emerald, or of light green or blue porcelain, and, when the words of theCLIXth Chapter of the Book of the Dead had been recited over it, it was placed on hisneck on the day of the funeral. In the XXVIth dynasty and later it seems as if the amuletrepresented the power of Isis, who derived it from her father, the husband of Renenet, thegoddess of abundant harvests and food. At an earlier period, judging from the text of theCLXth Chapter, the amulet is put by the godp. 50[paragraph continues] Thoth into the hands of the deceased, who says, \"It is in sound state, and Iam in sound state; it is not injured, and I am not injured; it is not worn away, and I am notworn away.\""},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"9. THE AMULET OF THE SOUL,This amulet was made of gold inlaid with precious stones in the form of a human-headedhawk, and, when the words of the LXXXIXth Chapter of the Book of the Dead had beenrecited over it, it was directed by the rubric to the Chapter to be placed upon the breast ofthe deceased. The object of the amulet is apparent from the text in which the deceased ismade to say, \"Hail, thou god Anniu! Hail, thou god Pehrer, who dwellest in thy hall!Grant thou that my soul may come unto me from wheresoever it may be. If it would tarry,then let my soul be brought unto me from wheresoever it may be. . . . Let me havepossession of my soul and of my spirit, and let me be true of voice with themwheresoever they may be. . . . Hail, ye gods, who tow along the boat of the lord ofmillions of years, who bring it above the underworld, and who make it to travel over Nut,who make souls to enter into their spiritual bodies, . . . grant that the soul of the Osiris1p. 51\"may come forth before the gods, and that it may be true of voice with you in the east ofthe sky, and follow unto the place where it was yesterday, and enjoy twofold peace inAmentet. May it look upon its natural body, may it rest upon its spiritual body, and mayits body neither perish nor suffer corruption for ever!\" Thus the amulet of the soul wasintended to enable the soul both to unite with the mummified body, and to be with itsspirit (khu) and spiritual body at will.10. THE AMULET OF THE LADDERIn tombs of the Ancient and Middle Empires small objects of wood and other substancesin the form of ladders have often been found, but the signification of them is not alwaysapparent. From the texts inscribed upon the walls of the corridors and chambers of thepyramids of Unas, Teta, Pepi, and other early kings, it is clear that the primitiveEgyptians believed that the floor of heaven, which also formed the sky of this world, wasmade of an immense plate of iron, rectangular in shape, the four corners of which restedupon four pillars which served to mark the cardinal points. On this plate of iron lived thegods and the blessed dead, and it was the aim of every good Egyptian to go there afterdeath. At certain sacred spots the edge ofp. 52"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"the plate was so near the tops of the mountains that the deceased might easily clamber onto it and so obtain admission into heaven, but at others the distance between it and theearth was so great that he needed help to reach it. There existed a belief that Osirishimself experienced some difficulty of getting up to the iron plate, and that it was only bymeans of the ladder which his father Râ provided that he at length ascended into heaven.On one side of the ladder stood Râ, and on the other stood Horus,1 the son of Isis, andeach god assisted Osiris to mount it. Originally the two guardians of the ladder wereHorus the Elder and Set, and there are several references in the early texts to the helpwhich they rendered to the deceased, who was, of course, identified with the god Osiris.But, with a view either of reminding these gods of their supposed duty, or of compellingthem to do it, the model of a ladder was often placed on or near the dead body in thetomb, and a special composition was prepared which had the effect of making the ladderbecome the means of the ascent of the deceased into heaven. Thus in the text written forPepi2 the deceased is made to address the ladder in these words: \"Homage to thee, Odivine Ladder! Homage to thee, O Ladder of Set! Stand thou upright, O divine Ladder!Stand thou upright, O Ladder of Set! Stand thou upright, O Ladder of Horus, wherebyOsirisp. 53came forth into heaven when he made use of his magical power upon Râ. . . . For Pepi isthy son, and Pepi is Horus, and thou hast given birth unto Pepi even as thou hast givenbirth unto the god who is the lord of the Ladder (i.e., Horus); and thou shalt give untoPepi the Ladder of the god (i.e., Horus), thou shalt give unto him the Ladder of the godSet whereby this Pepi shall come forth into heaven when he shall have made use of hismagical power upon Râ. O 'thou god of those whose doubles (kau) pass onwards, (whenthe Eye of Horus soareth upon the wing of 'Thoth on the east side of the divine Ladder(or Ladder of God), O men whose bodies [would go] into heaven, Pepi is the Eye ofHorus, and when the 'Eye turneth itself to any place where he is, Pepi goeth side by sidewith the Eye of Horus, and O ye who are the brethren of the gods, rejoice ye that Pepijourneyeth among you. And the brethren of Pepi who axe the gods shall be glad whenthey meet Pepi, even as Horus is glad when he meeteth his Eye. He hath placed his Eyebefore his father Seb, and every god and every spirit stretcheth out his hand towards Pepiwhen he cometh forth into heaven from the Ladder. Pepi hath need neither to 'plough theearth,' nor to 'collect the offering'; and he hath (need neither to go to the Hall which is inAnnu (Heliopolis), nor to the Hall of the Morning which is in Annu; for that which heseeth and that which hep. 54heareth shall feed him and nourish him when he appeareth in heaven from the Ladder.Pepi riseth like the uraeus on the forehead of Set, and every god and every spiritstretcheth out his hand to Pepi on the Ladder. Pepi hath gathered together his bones, behath collected his flesh, and he hath gone quickly into heaven by means of the twofingers1 of the god of the Ladder (i.e., Horus). Elsewhere2 the gods Khonsu, Sept, etc.,are invoked to bring the ladder to Pepi, and the ladder itself is adjured to come with itsname, and in another place3 we read, Homage to thee, O thou Ladder that supportest the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"golden vase of the Spirits of Pe and the Spirits of Nekhen, stretch out thy hand to thisPepi, and let him take his seat between the two great gods who (care in the place of thisPepi; take him by the hand and lead him towards Sekhet-Hetep (i.e., the Elysian Fields),and let him take his seat among the stars which are in the sky.\"In the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead the importance of the ladder is alsoseen, for in Chapter CXLIX.4 the deceased says, \"I set up a Ladder among the gods, andI am a divine being among them\"; and in Chapter CLIII. he says, \"Thep. 55[paragraph continues] Osiris Nu shall come forth upon your Ladder which Râ hath made for him,and Horus and Set shall grasp him firmly by the hand.\" Finally, when the custom ofplacing a model of the ladder in the tomb fell into disuse, the priests provided for thenecessity of the dead by painting a ladder on the papyri that were inscribed with the textsfrom the Book of the Dead and were buried with them.111. THE AMULET OF THE TWO FINGERS,This amulet is intended to represent the two fingers, index and medius, which the godHorus employed in helping his father Osiris up the ladder2 into heaven, as has beendescribed above; it is found in the interior of mummies and is usually made of obsidian orhæmatite.12. THE AMULET OF THE EYE OF HORUS,The Eye of Horus amulet, or Utchat, is one of the commonest of all, and its use seems tohave been universal at all periods. It was made of gold, silver, granite, hæmatite,carnelian, lapis-lazuli, porcelain, wood, etc., although the rubric of a late Chapter of theBook of the Dead3 directs that the amuletp. 56should be made either of lapis-lazuli or ofmak stone. The Utchat is of two kinds, onefacing to the left and the other to the right, and together they represent the two eyes ofHorus, one of which, according to an ancient text, was white and the other black; fromanother point of view one Utchat represents the Sun and the other the Moon, or Râ andOsiris respectively. But speaking generally, when the Egyptians wore the Utchat as anamulet they intended it to bring to them the blessings of strength, vigour, protection,safety, good health, and the like, and they had in their minds the Eye of Horus, probablythe white one, or the Sun. In religious texts the expressionmeh Utchat,i.e., the \"filling of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"the Utchat,\" is often used, and from many considerations it is clear that we mustunderstand it to refer to the Sun at the summer solstice; thus the amulet seems to havebeen intended to bring to its wearer strength and health similar to that of the Sun at theseason of the year when it is most powerful. In the CLXVIIth Chapter of the Book of theDead the deceased is made to say, \"The god Thoth hath brought the Utchat, and he hathmade it to rest after it departed, O Râ. It was grievously afflicted by the storm, but Thothmade it to rest after it departed out of the storm. I am sound, and it is sound; I am sound,and it is sound; and Nebseni, the lord of piety, is sound.\" To obtain the full benefit of theUtchat amulet for the deceased it was obligatory top. 57make one in lapis-lazuli and to plate it with gold, and then to offer to it offerings at thesummer solstice; another had then to be made of jasper and, if after the specified Chapter(CXL.) had been recited over it, it was laid on any part of the body of the deceased, hewould become a god and take his place in the boat of Râ. At this solstice twelve altars1had to be lighted, four for Râ-Temu, four for the Utchat, and four for the other gods whohad been mentioned in the Chapter. An interesting example of the use of theutchatoccurs in a Greek spell for the discovery of a thief written as late as the IVth century ofour era.2 In it we are told to \"take the herbkhelkbei andbugloss, press out the juice andburn the crushed leaves and mix the ashes with the juice. Anoint and write upon a wallKhoô with these materials. And take a common piece of wood, and cut a hammer out ofit, and strike with it upon the ear, pronouncing this spell:--'I adjure thee by the holynames, render up the thief, who has carried away such [and such] a thing Khalkhak,Khalkoum, Khiam, Khar, Khroum, Zbar, Bêri, Zbarkom, Khrê, Kariôb, Pharibou, and bythe terrible names αεεηηηιιιιοοοοουυυυυυωωωωωωω {Greekaeehhhiiiiooooouuuuuuwwwwwww}'\"3 Following these words we have a picture of theutchatp. 58with an arrangement of certain vowels on each side of it thus:ωυυιιιιηηηηηεεεεεεααααααα {Greekwuuiiiihhhhheeeeeeaaaaaaa}αεεηηηιιιιηηηηηεεεεεεααααααα {Greekaeehhhiiiihhhhh"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"eeeeeeaaaaaaa}The spell continues, \"Render up the thief who has stolen such [and such] a thing: as longas I strike the ear with this hammer, let the eye of the thief be smitten and inflamed untilit betrays him.' Saying these words strike with the hammer.\"113. THE AMULET OF \"LIFE,\"(ÂNKH).The object which is represented by this amulet is unknown, and of all the suggestionswhich have been made concerning it none is more unlikely than that which would give ita phallic origin. Whatever it may represent, it certainly symbolizes \"life\"; every godcarries it, and it seems, even in the earliest times, to be a conventional representation ofsome object which in the remotest period had been used as an . amulet. In the Papyrus ofAni (2nd edit., plate 2) the Ânkh rises from the Tet, and the arms which project from itsupport the disk of the sun as here seen. This amulet is made ofp. 59various substances, and was chiefly employed as a pendant of a necklace.14. THE AMULET NEFER,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"This amulet signifies \"happiness, good luck,\" etc., and represents a musical instrument; itwas made of carnelian, red stone, red porcelain, and the like, and was a very favouriteform for the pendants of necklaces and strings of beads.15. THE AMULET OF THE SERPENT'S HEAD,This amulet was placed on the dead body to keep it from being bitten by snakes in theunderworld or tomb. It is made of red stone, red jasper, red paste, and carnelian. As thegoddess Isis is often typified by a serpent, and red is a colour peculiar to her, it seems asif the idea underlying the use of this amulet was to vanquish the snakes in the tomb bymeans of the power of the great snake-goddess Isis. This power had been transferred to itby means of the words of the XXXIVth Chapter of the Book of the Dead, which are ofteninscribed upon it. The text reads: \"O Serpent! I am the flame which shineth upon theOpener of hundreds of thousands of years, and the standard of the god Tenpu,\" or asothers say, \"the standard of young plants and flowers. Depart ye from me, for I am thedivine Lynx.\" Somep. 60have thought that the snake's head represents the serpent which surmounts the ram's headon theurhekau instrument used in performing the ceremony of \"Opening the mouth.\"1The Kher-heb priest touching the statue of the deceased with theurhekau instrument toeffect the \"opening of the mouth.\" (From thePapyrus of Ani, plate 15)"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"16. THE AMULET OF THE MENAT,This amulet was in use in Egypt as early as the VIth dynasty, and it was worn or held orcarried with the sistrum by gods, kings, priests, priestesses, etc.; usually it is held in thehand, but it is often worn on the neck. Its object was to bring joy and health to the wearer,and it was believed to possess magical properties; it represented nutrition2 andp. 61strength, and the might of the male and female organs of generation, mysticallyconsidered, was supposed to be united therein. The amulet is made in bronze, stone,porcelain, and other substances, and when laid upon the body of the dead brought to it thepower of life and reproduction.17. THE AMULET OF THE SAM,This amulet is probably intended to represent an organ of the human body, and its use isvery ancient; it is made of lapis-lazuli and other hard stone substances, and in the lateperiod is often found in the swathings of mummies. Its primary meaning is \"union,\" andrefers to animal pleasure.18. THE AMULET OF THE SHEN,This amulet is intended to represent the sun's orbit, and it became the symbol of anundefined period of time,i.e., eternity; it was laid upon the body of the dead with theview of giving to it life which should endure as long as the sun revolved in its orbit in theheavens.

The amulet of the cartouchehas been supposed to be nothing more thanshen elongated, but it probably refers to the ordinary meaning ofi.e., \"name.\"19. THE AMULET OF THE STEPS,This amulet seems to have two meanings: to lift up to heaven, and the throne of Osiris.According to one legend, when the god Shu wished to lift up the goddess Nut from theembrace of the god Seb, so that her body, supported by her stretched-out arms and legs,might form the sky, he found that he was not tall enough to do so; in this difficulty hemade use of a flight of steps, and having mounted to the top of these he found himselfable to perform his work. In the fourth section of the Elysian Fields1 three such flights ofsteps are depicted. In the XXIInd Chapter of the Book of the Dead the deceased praysthat he \"may have a portion with him who is on the top of the steps,\"i.e., Osiris, and infuneral vignettes this god is seen seated upon the top of a flight of steps and holding hisusual symbols of sovereignty and dominion. The amulet of the Steps is usually made ofgreen or blue glazed porcelain.p. 6320. THE AMULET OF THE FROG,This amulet is typical of teeming life and of the resurrection. The frog-headed goddessHeqt, the wife of Khnemu, was associated with the resurrection, and this amulet, whenlaid upon the body of the dead, was intended to transfer to it her power. The frog is oftenrepresented on the upper part of the Greek and Roman terra-cotta lamps which are foundin Egypt, and on one of them written in Greek is the legend, \"I am the resurrection.\"1"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The amulets described above are those which are most commonly found in the tombs andon mummies, but a few others are also known,e.g.,the White crown of theSouth,the Red crown of the North,the horizon, or place where thesun rises,an angle, typifying protection,the horns, disk, andplumes,orthe plummet, etc. Besides these, any ring, or pendant,or ornament, or any object whatsoever, upon which was inscribed the name of a god orhis emblem, or picture, became an amulet with protective powers; and it seems that thesepowers remained active as long as the substance lasted and as long as the name, oremblem, or picture, was notp. 64erased from it. The use of amulets was common in Egypt from the earliest times to theRoman Period, and when the Egyptians embraced Christianity, they, in common with theGnostics and semi-Christian sects, imported into their new faith many of the views andbeliefs which their so-called heathen ancestors had held, and with them the use of thenames of ancient Egyptian gods, and goddesses, and demons, and formulæ, which theyemployed in much the same way as they were employed in the days of old.Footnotes27:1 I.e., Chapter XXIV., which is entitled, \"The Chapter of bringing words of power unto Osiris inthe underworld.\"27:2 Ethnographie Prehistorique, p. 144.28:1 Unas, ed.

But the Egyptians went a step further than this, and theybelieved that it was possible to transmit to thefigure of any man, or woman, or animal, orliving creature, the soul of the being which it represented, and its qualities and attributes.The statue of a god in a temple contained the spirit of the god which it represented, andfrom time immemorial the people of Egypt believed that every statue and every figurepossessed an indwelling spirit. When the Christianized Egyptians made their attacks onthe \"idols of the heathen\" they proved that they possessed this belief, for they alwaysendeavoured to throw down the statues of the gods ofp. 66the Greeks and Romans, knowing that if they were once shattered the spirits which dweltin them would have no place wherein to dwell, and would thereby be rendered homelessand powerless. It will be remembered that it is stated in the Apocryphal Gospels thatwhen the Virgin Mary and her Son arrived in Egypt there \"was a movement and quakingthroughout all the land, and all the idols fell down from their pedestals and were brokenin pieces.\" Then all the priests and nobles went to a certain priest with whom \"a devil"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"used to speak from out of the idol,\" and they asked him the meaning of these things; andwhen he had explained to them that the footstep of the son of the \"secret and hidden god\"had fallen upon the land of Egypt, they accepted his counsel and made a figure of thisgod. The Egyptians acknowledged that the new god was greater than all their godstogether, and they were quite prepared to set up a statue of him because they believed thatin so doing they would compel at least a portion of the spirit of the \"secret and hiddengod\" to come and dwell in it. In the following pages we shall endeavour to describe theprincipal uses which the Egyptians made of the figures of gods, and men, and beasts, towhich magical powers had been imparted by means of the performance of certainsymbolic ceremonies and the recital of certain words of power; and how they could beemployed to do both good and evil.p. 67One of the earliest instances of the use of a magical figure is related in the WestcarPapyrus,1 where we read that Prince Khâf-Râ told Khufu (Cheops) a story of an eventwhich had happened in the time of Neb-ka or Neb-kau-Ed, a king of the IIIrd dynasty,who reigned about B.C. 3830. It seems that this king once paid a visit to one of his highofficials called Âba-aner, whose wife fell violently in love with one of the soldiers in theroyal train. This lady sent her tirewoman to him with the gift of a chest of clothes, andapparently she made known to him her mistress's desire, for he returned with her to Âba-aner's house. There he saw the wife and made an appointment to meet her in a little housewhich was situated on her husband's estate, and she gave instructions to one of thestewards of Âba-aner to prepare it for the arrival of herself and her lover. When all hadbeen made ready she went to the house and stayed there the whole day drinking andmaking love with the man until sunset; and when the evening had come he rose up andwent down to the river and the tirewoman bathed him in the water thereof. But thesteward, who had made ready the house, declared that he must make the matter knownunto his master, and on the following morning as soon as it was light, he went to Âba-aner and related to him everything which had happened. The official made no answer tohisp. 68servant's report, but ordered him to bring him certain materials and his box made ofebony and precious metal. Out of the box he took a quantity of wax, which was, nodoubt, kept there for purposes similar to that to which a portion of it was now to be put,and made a model of a crocodile seven spans long, and then reciting certain magicalwords over it, he said, \"When the man cometh down to bathe in my waters seize thouhim.\" Then, turning to the steward, he gave the wax crocodile to him and said, \"When theman, according to his daily wont, cometh down to wash in the water thou shalt cast thecrocodile in after him\"; and the steward having taken the wax crocodile from his masterwent his way.And again the wife of Âba-aner ordered the steward who had charge of the estate to makeready the house which was in the garden, \"for,\" she said, \"behold, I am coming to passsome time therein.\" So the house was made ready and provided with all good things, and"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"she came with the man and passed some time with him there. Now when the evening wascome the man went down to the water to wash according to his daily wont, and thesteward went down after him and threw into the water the wax crocodile, whichstraightway turned into a living crocodile seven cubits (i.e., about twelve feet) in length,and seized upon the man and dragged him down in the water.p. 69Meanwhile Âba-aner tarried with his king Neb-kau-Râ for seven days, and the manremained in the depths of the water and had no air to breathe. And on the seventh dayÂba-aner thekher heb1 went out with the king for a walk, and invited His Majesty tocome and see for himself a wonderful thing which had happened to a man in his owndays; so the king went with him. When they had come to the water Âba-aner adjured thecrocodile, saying, \"Bring hither the man,\" and the crocodile came out of the waterbringing the man with him. And when the king remarked that the crocodile was a horridlooking monster, Âba-aner stooped down and took it up into his hand, when itstraightway became a waxen crocodile as it was before. After these things Âba-anerrelated to the king what had happened between his wife and the man whom the crocodilehad brought up out of the water, whereupon the king said to the crocodile, \"Take thatwhich is thine and begone\"; and immediately the crocodile seized the man and spranginto the water with him, and disappeared in its depths. And by the royal command Âba-aner's wife was seized, and having been led to the north side of the palace was burnt, andher ashes were cast into the stream. Here then we have already in the IIIrd dynasty theexistence of a belief that a wax crocodile, over which certain wordsp. 70had been said, could change itself into a living reptile at pleasure, and that a man could bemade by the same means to live at the bottom of a stream for seven days without air. Wemay also notice that the great priestly official, the kher heb, was so much in the habit ofperforming such acts of magic that he kept in a room a box of materials and instrumentsalways ready for the purpose; and, apparently, neither himself, nor his king, nor hisservant, thought the working of magic inconsistent with his high religious office.But at the time when Âba-aner was working magic by means of wax figures, probably tothe harm and injury of his enemies, the priests were making provision for the happinessand well-being of the dead also by means of figures made of various substances.According to one very early belief the dead made their way to a region called Sekhet-Aaru, where they led a life which was not very different from that which they had ledupon earth. From the pictures of this place which are painted on coffins of the XIthdynasty, we see that it was surrounded by streams of water, and that it was intersected bycanals, and that, in fact, it was very much like an ordinary well-kept estate in the Delta.The beings who lived in this place, however, had the same wants as human beings, that isto say, they needed both food and drink, or bread-cakes and ale. The existence of breadand ale presupposed the existence of wheat and barley, andp. 71"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"the production of these presupposed the tilling of the ground and the work of agriculturallabourers. But the Egyptian had no wish to continue the labours of ploughing and reapingand preparing the ground for the new crops in the world beyond the grave, therefore heendeavoured to avoid this by getting the work done vicariously. If words of power saidover a figure could make it to do evil, similarly words of power said over a figure couldmake it to do good. At first a formula1 was composed, the recital of which was supposedto relieve the deceased from the necessity of doing any work whatsoever, and when thedeceased himself had said, \"I lift up the hand of the man who is inactive. I have comefrom the city of Unnu (Hermopolis). I am the divine Soul which liveth, and I lead withme the hearts of the apes,\" his existence was thought to be without toil. But, since theinhabitants of Sekhet-Aaru needed food and drink, provision must be made for theirproduction, and the necessary labours of the field must, in some manner, be performed.To meet the difficulty a small stone figure of the deceased was buried with him, butbefore it was laid in the tomb the priests recited over it the words of power which wouldcause it to do for the deceased whatever work he might be adjudged to perform in thekingdom of Osiris, Later, these words were inscribed upon the figure in hieroglyphics,and later still the figure wasp. 72provided with representations of the rope basket, and plough, and flail, such as were employed by the Egyptian labourer in carrying field produce,and in ploughing, and in threshing grain. The formula1 or words of power which wereinscribed on such figures varied at different periods, but one of the oldest, which was inuse in the XVIIIth dynasty, makes the deceased say to the figure, which was called\"Shabti\":--\"O thou Shabti figure of the scribe Nebseni, if I be called, or if I be adjudged to do anywork whatsoever of the labours which are to be done in the underworld by a man in histurn--behold, any obstacles (or opposition) to thee will be done away with there--let thejudgment fall upon thee instead of upon me always, in the matter of sowing the fields, offilling the water-courses with water, and of bringing the sands from the east to the west.\"After these words comes the answer by the figure, \"Verily I am\" here, and [will do]whatsoever thou biddest me to do.\" The Egyptians were most anxious to escape thelabours of top-dressing2 the land, and of sowing the seed, a work which had to be doneby a man standing in water in the sun, and the toilsome task of working theshadûf, orinstrument for raising waterp. 73"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"from the Nile and turning it on to the land. In graves not one figure only is found, butseveral, and it is said that in the tomb of Seti I., king of Egypt about B.C. 1370, no lessthan seven hundred woodenushabtiu inscribed with the VIth Chapter of the Book of theDead, and covered with bitumen, were found. The use of theshabti figure continuedunabated down to the Roman period, when boxes full of ill-shaped, uninscribed porcelainfigures were buried in the tombs with the dead.The next instance worth mentioning of the use of magical figures we obtain from theofficial account of a conspiracy against Rameses III., king of Egypt about B.C. 1200. Itseems that a number of high officials, the Overseer of the Treasury included, and certainscribes, conspired together against this king apparently with the view of dethroning him.They took into their counsels a number of the ladies attached to the court (some thinkthey belonged to theharîm), and the chief abode of these ladies became the headquartersof the conspirators. One official was charged with \"carrying abroad their words to theirmothers and sisters who were there to stir up men and to incite malefactors to do wrongto their lord\"; another was charged with aiding and abetting the conspiracy by makinghimself one with the ringleaders; another was charged with being cognizant of the wholematter, and with concealing his knowledge of it; another withp. 74\"giving ear to the conversation held by the men conspiring with the women of the Per-khent, and not bringing it forward against them,\" and so on. The conspiracy soonextended from Egypt to Ethiopia, and a military official of high rank in that country wasdrawn into it by his sister, who urged him to \"Incite the men to commit crime, and dothou thyself come to do wrong to thy lord\"; now the sister of this official was in the Per-khent, and so she was able to give her brother the latest information of the progress of thedisaffection. Not content with endeavouring to dethrone the king by an uprising of bothsoldiers and civilians, Hui, a certain high official, who was the overseer of the [royal]cattle, bethought him of applying magic to help their evil designs, and with this object inview he went to some one who had access to the king's library, and he obtained from hima book containing formulæ of a magical nature, and directions for working magic. Bymeans of this book he obtained \"divine power,\" and he became able to cast spells uponfolk. Having gained possession of the book he next looked out for some place where hecould carry on his magical work without interruption, and at length found one. Here heset to work to make figures of men in wax, and amulets inscribed with words of magicalpower which would provoke love, and these he succeeded in introducing into the royalpalace by means of the official Athirmâ; andp. 75it seems as if those who took them into the palace and those who received them wereunder the magical influence of Hui. It is probable that the love philtres were intended forthe use of the ladies who were involved in the conspiracy, but as to the object of the waxfigures there is no doubt, for they were intended to work harm to the king. MeanwhileHui studied his magical work with great diligence, and he succeeded in findingefficacious means for carrying out all the \"horrible things and all the wickednesses which"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"his heart could imagine\"; these means he employed in all seriousness, and at lengthcommitted great crimes which were the horror of every god and goddess, and thepunishment of such crimes was death. In another place Hui is accused of writing books orformulæ of magical words, the effect of which would be to drive men out of their senses,and to strike terror into them; and of making gods of wax and figures of men of the samesubstance, which should cause the human beings whom they represented to becomeparalysed and helpless. But their efforts were in vain, the conspiracy was discovered, andthe whole matter was carefully investigated by two small courts of enquiry, the membersof which consisted, for the most part, of the king's personal friends; the king's orders tothem were that \"those who are guilty shall die by their own hands, and tell me nothingwhatever about it.\" The first court, which consisted of sixp. 76members, sat to investigate the offences of the husbands and relatives of the royal ladies,and those of the ladies themselves, but before their business was done three of them werearrested because it was found that the ladies had gained great influence over them, thatthey and the ladies had feasted together, and that they had ceased to be, in consequence,impartial judges. They were removed from their trusted positions before the king, andhaving been examined and their guilt clearly brought home to them, their ears and noseswere cut off as a punishment and warning to others not to form friendships with theenemies of the king. The second court, which consisted of five members, investigated thecases of those who were charged with having \"stirred up men and incited malefactors todo wrong to their lord,\" and having found them guilty they sentenced six of them todeath, one by one, in the following terms:--\"Pentaura, who is also called by anothername. He was brought up on account of the offence which he had committed inconnexion with his mother Thi when she formed a conspiracy with the women of the Per-khent, and because he had intent to do evil unto his lord. He was brought before the courtof judges that he might receive sentence, and they found him guilty, and dismissed him tohis own death, where he suffered death by his own hand.\" The wretched man Hui, whomade wax figures and spells with the intent to inflict painp. 77and suffering and death upon the king, was also compelled to commit suicide.1The above story of the famous conspiracy against Rameses III. is most useful as provingthat books of magic existed in the Royal Library, and that they were not mere treatises onmagical practices, but definite works with detailed instructions to the reader how toperform the ceremonies which were necessary to make the formulæ or words of powerefficacious. We have now seen that wax figures were used both to do good and to doharm, from the IIIrd to the XXth dynasty, and that the ideas which the Egyptians heldconcerning them were much the same about B.C. 1200 as they were two thousand fivehundred years earlier; we have also seen that the, use ofushabtiu figures, which wereintended to set the deceased free from the necessity of labour in the world beyond thegrave, was widespread. That such figures were used in the pre-dynastic days when theEgyptians were slowly emerging into civilization from a state of semi-barbarism is not to"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"be wondered at, and it need not surprise us that they existed as a survival in the earlydynasties before the people generally had realized that the great powers of Nature, whichthey deified, could not be ruled by man and by his petty words and deeds, howevermysterious and solemn. It is, however, very remarkable to findp. 78that the use of wax figures played a prominent part in certain of the daily services whichwere performed in the temple of the god Amen-Râ at Thebes, and it is still moreremarkable that these services were performed at a time when the Egyptians wererenowned among the nations of the civilized world for their learning and wisdom. Onecompany of priests attached to the temple was employed in transcribing hymns andreligious compositions in which the unity, power, and might of God were set forth inunmistakable terms, and at the same time another company was engaged in performing aservice the object of which was to free the Sun, which was deified under the form of Râ,and was the type and symbol of God upon earth, from the attacks of a monster calledÂpep!It will be remembered that the XXXIXth Chapter of the Book of the Dead is acomposition which was written with the object of defeating a certain serpent, to whichmany names are given, and of delivering the deceased from his attacks. In it we have adescription of how the monster is vanquished, and the deceased says to him, \"Râ makeththee to turn back, O thou that art hateful to him; he looketh upon thee, get thee back. Hepierceth thy head, he cutteth through thy face, he divideth thy head at the two sides of theways, and it is crushed in his land; thy bones are smashed in pieces, thy members arehacked from off thee, and the god Aker hath condemned thee, O Âpep,p. 79thou enemy of Râ. Get thee back, Fiend, before the darts of his beams! Râ hathoverthrown thy words, the gods have turned thy face backwards, the Lynx hath torn openthy breast, the Scorpion hath cast fetters upon thee, and Maât hath sent forth thydestruction. The gods of the south, and of the north, of the west, and of the east, havefastened chains upon him, and they have fettered him with fetters; the god Rekes hathoverthrown him, and the god Hertit hath put him in chains.\"1 The age of this compositionis unknown, but it is found, with variants, in many of the copies of the Book of the Deadwhich were made in the XVIIIth dynasty. Later, however, the ideas in it were developed,the work itself was greatly enlarged, and at the time of the Ptolemies it had become abook called \"The Book of Overthrowing Âpep,\" which contained twelve chapters. At thesame time another work bearing the same title also existed; it was not divided intochapters, but it contained two versions of the history of the Creation, and a list of the evilnames of Âpep, and a hymn to Râ.2 Among the chapters of the former work was oneentitled, \"Chapter of putting the fire upon Âpep,\" which reads, \"Fire be upon thee, Âpep,thou enemy of Râ! The Eye of Horus prevails over the accursed soul and shade of Âpep,and thep. 80"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"flame of the Eye of Horus shall gnaw into that enemy of Râ; and the flame of the Eye ofHorus shall consume all the enemies of the Mighty God, life! strength! health! both indeath and in life. When Âpep is given to the flame,\" says the rubric, \"thou shalt gay thesewords of power:--Taste thou death, O Âpep, get thee back, retreat, O enemy of Râ, falldown, be repulsed, get back and retreat! I have driven thee back, and I have cut thee inpieces.Râ triumphs over Âpep. Taste thou death, Âpep.Râ triumphs over Âpep. Taste thou death, Âpep.Râ triumphs over Âpep. Taste thou death, Âpep.Râ triumphs over Âpep. Taste thou death, Âpep.\"These last sentences were said four times, that is to say, once for each of the gods of thecardinal points. The text continues, \"Back, Fiend, an end to thee! Therefore have I drivenflame at thee, and therefore have I made thee to be destroyed, and therefore have Iadjudged thee to evil. An end, an end to thee! Taste thou death! An end to thee! Thoushalt never rise again.\" Such are the words of power, and these are followed by thedirections for performing the ceremony, which read thus:--\"If thou wouldst destroy Âpep, thou shalt say this chapter over a figure of Âpep whichhath been drawn in green colour upon a sheet of new papyrus, and overp. 81a wax figure1 of Âpep upon which his name hath been cut and inlaid with green colour;and thou shalt lay them upon the fire so that it may consume the enemy of Râ. And thoushalt put such a figure on the fire at dawn, and another at noon, and another at eventidewhen Râ setteth in the land of life, and another at midnight, and another at the eighthhour of the day, and another towards evening; [and if necessary] thou mayest do thusevery hour during the day and the night, and on the days of the festivals and every day.By means of this Âpep, the enemy of Râ, shall be overthrown in the shower, for Râ shallshine and Âpep shall indeed be overthrown.\" And the papyrus and the figure \"havingbeen burnt in a fire made ofkhesau grass, the remains thereof shall be mixed withexcrement and thrown upon a fire; thou shalt do this at the sixth hour of the night, and atdawn on the fifteenth day [of the month]. And when the figure of Âpep is placed in thefire thou shalt spit upon him several times each hour during the day, until the shadowturneth round. Thou shalt do these things when tempests rage in the east of the sky as Râsetteth, in order to prevent the coming onward of the storms. Thou shalt do this and sop. 82prevent the coming of a shower or a rain-storm, and \"thereby shall the sun be made toshine.\"In another part of this book the reciter is told to say the following \"firmly with themouth\":-- \"Down upon thy face, O Âpep, enemy of Râ! The flame which cometh forthfrom the Eye of Horus advanceth against thee. Thou art thrust down into the flame it of"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"fire and it cometh against thee. Its flame is deadly to thy soul, and to thy spirit, and to thywords of power, and to thy body, and to thy shade. The lady of fire prevaileth over thee,the flame pierceth thy soul, it maketh an end of thy person, and it darteth into thy form.The eye of Horus which is powerful against its enemy hath cast thee down, it devoureththee, the great fire trieth thee, the Eye of Râ prevaileth over thee, the flame devoureththee, and what escapeth from it hath no being. Get thee back, for thou art cut asunder, thysoul is shrivelled up, thy accursed name is buried in oblivion, and silence is upon it, and ithath fallen [out of remembrance]. Thou hast come to an end, thou hast been driven away,and thou art forgotten, forgotten, forgotten,\" etc. To make these words to be of effect thespeaker is told to write the names of Âpep upon a new papyrus and to burn it in the fireeither when Râ is rising, or at noon, or at sunset, etc. In another part of the work, after aseries of curses which are ordered to be said over Âpep, the rubric directs that they shallbe recitedp. 83by a person who hath washed himself and is ceremonially clean, and when this has beendone he is to write in green colour upon a piece of new papyrus the names of all thefiends who are in the train of Âpep, as well as those of their fathers, and mothers, andchildren. He must then make figures of all these fiends in wax, and having inscribed theirnames upon them, must tie them up with black hair, and then cast them on the ground andkick them with the left foot, and pierce them with a stone spear; this done they are to bethrown into the fire. More than once is it said, \"It is good for a man to recite this bookbefore the august god regularly,\" for the doing of it was believed to give great power \"tohim, both upon earth and in the underworld.\" Finally, after the names of Âpep areenumerated, be who would benefit by the knowledge of them is bidden to \"make thefigure of a serpent with his tail in his mouth, and having stuck a knife in his back, casthim down upon the ground and say, \"'Âpep, Fiend, Betet.'\" Then, in order to destroy thefiends who are in the train of Âpep, other images or figures of them must be made withtheir hands tied behind them; these are to be called \"Children of inactivity.\" The papyrusthen continues, \"Make another serpent with the face of a cat, and with a knife stuck in hisback, and call it 'Hemhem' (Roarer). Make another with the face of a crocodile, and witha knife stuck in his back, and call itp. 84'Hauna-aru-her-hra.' Make another with the face of a duck, and with a knife stuck in hisback, and call it 'Aluti.' Make another with the face of a white cat, and with a knife stuckin his back, and tie it up and bind it tightly, and call it 'Âpep the Enemy.'\" Such are themeans which the Egyptians adopted when they wanted to keep away rain and storm,thunder and lightning, and mist and cloud, and to ensure a bright clear sky wherein thesun might run his course.Under the heading of \"Magical Figures\" must certainly be included the so-called Ptah-Seker-Ausar figure which is usually made of wood; it is often solid, but is sometimesmade hollow, and is usually let into a rectangular wooden stand which may be eithersolid or hollow. The three gods or trinity of Ptah, Seker (Socharis), and Ausar (Osiris),"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"are intended to represent the god of the sunrise (Ptah), the god of the night sun (Seker),and the god of the resurrection (Osiris). The name Ptah means \"Opener,\" and is usuallyapplied to the sun as the \"opener\" of the day; and the name Seker means \"He who is shutin,\" that is to say, the night sun, who was regarded as the sun buried temporarily. Now thelife of a man upon earth was identified with that of the sun; he \"opened\" or began his lifeas Ptah, and after death he was \"shut in\" or \"coffined,\" like it also. But the sun rises againwhen the night is past, and, as it begins a new life with renewed strength and vigour, itbecame the typep. 85of the new life which the Egyptian hoped to live in the world beyond the grave. But thedifficulty was how to obtain the protection of Ptah, Seker, and Osiris, and how to makethem do for the man that which they did for themselves, and so secure their attributes. Toattain this end a figure was fashioned in such a way as to include the chief characteristicsof the forms of these gods, and was inserted in a rectangular wooden stand which wasintended to represent the coffin or chest out of which the trinity Ptah-Seker-Ausar cameforth. On the figure itself and on the sides of the stand were inscribed prayers on behalf ofthe man for whom it was made, and the Egyptian believed that these prayers caused themight and powers of the three gods to come and dwell in the wooden figure. But in orderto make the stand of the figure as much like a coffin as possible, a small portion of thebody of the deceased was carefully mummified and placed in it, and it was thought that ifthe three gods protected and preserved that piece, and if they revivified it in due season,the whole body would be protected, and preserved, and revivified. Frequently, especiallyin the late period, a cavity was made in the side of the stand, and in this was laid a smallroll of papyrus inscribed with the text of certain Chapters of the Book of the Dead, andthus the deceased was provided with additional security for the resurrection of hisspiritual body in the world to come. The little rolls of papyrusp. 86are often inscribed with but short and fragmentary texts, but occasionally, as in the caseof the priestess Anhai, a fine large papyrus,1 inscribed with numerous texts andillustrated with vignettes, was placed inside the figure of the god, who in this instance isin the form of Osiris only.2 It seems that the Ptah-Seker-Ausar figure was much used inthe late period in Egypt, for many inscribed examples have been found which are notonly illegible, but which prove that the artist had not the remotest idea of the meaning ofthe things which he was writing. It is possible that they were employed largely by thepoor, among whom they seem to have served the purpose of the costly tomb.Returning once more to the subject of wax figures, it may be wondered why such a verylarge proportion of the figures of the gods which were worn by the living and attached tothe bodies of the dead as amulets are made of almost every kind of substance except wax.But the reason of this is not far to seek: wax is a substance which readily changes its formunder heat and pressure, and it is also possible that the fact of its having been employedfrom time immemorial for making figures which were intended to work harm and not"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"good to man, induced those who made amulets in the forms of the gods to select someother material. As a matter of fact, however, several figures of godsp. 87Ptah-Seker-Ausar figure with cavity containing a portion of a human body mummified.(British Museum, No. 9736).p. 89made of wax to serve as protective amulets are known, and a set of four, representing thefour children of Horus, now preserved in the British Museum, are worthy of notice. Thefour children of Horus, or the gods of the four cardinal points, were called Mestha, Hâpi,Tuamutef, and Qebhsennuf, and with them were associated the goddesses Isis, Nephthys,Neith, and Serqet respectively. Mestha was man-headed, and represented the south, andprotected the stomach and large intestines; Hâpi was dog-headed, and represented the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"north, and protected the small intestines; Tuamutef was jackal-headed) and representedthe east and protected the lungs and the heart; and Qebhsennuf was hawk-headed, andrepresented the west, and protected the liver and the gall-bladder. The various internalorgans of men were removed from the body before it was mummified, and having beensteeped in certain astringent substances and bitumen were wrapped up in bandages, andlaid in four jars made of stone, marble, porcelain, earthenware, or wood. Each jar wasplaced under the protection of one of the four children of Horus, and as it was hollow,and its cover was made in the form of the head of the god who was represented by it, andas the jar by means of the inscription upon it became an abode of the god, it might wellbe said that the organ of the deceased which was put in it was actually placed inside thegod. The custom of embalming the intestines separately is very old, andp. 90several examples of it in the XIth dynasty are known; even at that early period the fourjars of mummified intestines were placed in a funeral chest, or coffer, which wasmounted on a sledge, and drawn along in the funeral procession immediately after thecoffin. In later times we find that many attempts were made to secure for the deceased thebenefit of the protection of these four gods without incurring the expense ofThe Four Children of Horus.Osiris rising from the funeral chest holding the symbol of \"life\" In each hand.(From thePapyrus of Ani, plate 8.)stone jars; this could be done by burying with him four models or \"dummy\" jars, or fourporcelain figures of the four gods,,,,, or four wax ones. For someunknown reason the set referred to above was made of wax.1 The four children of Horusplayed ap. 91"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"very important part in the funeral works of the early dynasties; they originallyrepresented the four supports of heaven, but very soon each was regarded as the god ofone of the four quarters of the earth, and also of that quarter of the heavens which wasabove it. As the constant prayer of the deceased was that he should be able to go aboutwherever he pleased, both on earth and in heaven, it was absolutely necessary for hiswelfare that he should propitiate these gods and place himself under their protection,which could only be secured by the recital of certain words of power over figures ofthem, or over jars made to represent them.But of all the Egyptians who were skilled in working magic, Nectanebus, the last nativeking of Egypt, about B.C. 318, was the chief, if we may believe Greek tradition.According to Pseudo- Callisthenes, and the versions of his works which were translatedinto Pehlevi, Arabic, Syriac, and a score of other languages and dialects, this king wasfamous as a magician and a sage, and he was deeply learned in all the wisdom of theEgyptians. He knew what was in the depths of the Nile and of heaven, he was skilled inreading the stars, in interpreting omens, in casting nativities, in telling fortunes, and inpredicting the future of the unborn child, and in working magic of every kind, as we shallsee; he was said to be the lord of the earth, and to rule all kings by means of his magicalpowers.p. 92[paragraph continues] Whenever he was threatened with invasion by sea or by land he succeededin destroying the power of his enemies, and in driving them from his coasts or frontiers;and this he did by the following means. If the enemy came against him by sea, instead ofsending out his sailors to fight them, he retired into a certain chamber, and havingbrought forth a bowl which he kept for the purpose, he filled it with water, and then,having made wax figures of the ships and men of the enemy, and also of his own menand ships, he set them upon the water in the bowl, his men on one side, and those of theenemy on the other. He then came out, and having put on the cloak of an Egyptianprophet and taken an ebony rod in his hand, he returned into the chamber, and utteringwords of power he invoked the gods who help men to work magic, and the winds, and thesubterranean demons, which straightway came to his aid. By their means the figures ofthe men in wax sprang into life and began to fight, and the ships of wax began to moveabout likewise; but the figures which represented his own men vanquished those whichrepresented the enemy, and as the figures of the ships and men of the hostile fleet sankthrough the water to the bottom of the bowl, even so did the real ships and men sinkthrough the waters to the bottom of the sea. In this way he succeeded in maintaining hispower, and he continued to occupy his kingdom in peace for a considerablep. 93period. But it fell out on a day that certain scouts came and informed Nectanebus that amultitude of the nations of the East had made a league together against Egypt, and thattheir allied forces were at that moment marching against him. When the king heard thenews he laughed, and having said some scornful words about his enemies, he went intohis private chamber, and pouring water into the bowl began to work magic in the usual"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"way. But when he had spoken the words of power, he looked at the wax figures, and saw,to his dismay, that the gods of Egypt were steering the enemies' ships, and leading theirsoldiers to war against himself. Now as soon as Nectanebus saw this, he understood thatthe end of the kingdom of Egypt was at hand, for hitherto the gods had been wont to holdconverse with him readily, and to lend him their help whenever he had need of it. He thenquitted the chamber hastily, and having shaved off his hair and his beard, and disguisedhimself by putting on common apparel, be took ship and fled to Pella in Macedonia,where he established himself as a physician, and as an Egyptian soothsayer.Omitting, for the present, any reference to the contents of the IVth chapter of Pseudo-Callisthenes, in which the casting of the nativity of Olympias by Nectanebus is described,we come to the passage in which the story of the way in which he sent a dreamp. 94to the queen by means of a wax figure is told. His object was to persuade the queen thatthe Egyptian god Amen would come to her at night. To do this he left her presence, andgoing out into the desert he collected a number of herbs which he knew how to employ incausing people to dream dreams, and having brought them back with him be squeezed thejuice out of them. He then made the figure of a woman in wax, and wrote upon it thename of Olympias, just as the priest of Thebes made the figure of Âpep in wax and cuthis name upon it. Nectanebus then lit his lamp, and, having poured the juice of the herbsover the wax figure of the queen, he adjured the demons to such purpose that Olympiasdreamed a dream in which the god Amen came to her and embraced her, and told her thatshe should give birth to a man-child who should avenge her on her husband Philip. Butthe means described above were not the only ones known to Nectanebus for procuringdreams, for when he wanted to make Philip of Macedon to see certain things in a dream,and to take a certain view about what he saw, he sent a hawk, which he had previouslybewitched by magical words, to Philip as he lay asleep, and in a single night the hawkflew from Macedonia to the place where Philip was, and coming to him told him whatthings he should see in his dream, and he saw them. On the morrow Philip had the dreamexplained by an expounder of dreams,p. 95and he was satisfied that the child1 to whom his wife Olympias was about to give birthwas the son of the god Amen (or Ammon) of Libya, who was regarded as the father of allthe kings who ascended the throne of Egypt, who did not belong to the royal stock of thatcountry.2Here, in connexion with the Egyptian use of wax figures, must be mentioned one or twostories and traditions of Alexander the Great which are, clearly, derived from Egyptiansources. The Arab writer, Abu-Shâker, who flourished in the XIIIth century of our era,mentions a tradition that Aristotle gave to Alexander a number of wax figures naileddown in a box, which was fastened by a chain, and which he ordered him never to let goout of his hand, or at least out of that of one of his confidential servants. The box was togo wherever Alexander went, and Aristotle taught him to recite certain formulæ over it"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"whenever he took it up or put it down. The figures in the box were intended to representthe various kinds of armed forces that Alexander was likely to find opposed to him. Someof the models held in their hands leaden swords which were curved backwards, and somehad spears in their hands pointed head downwards, and some had bows with cut strings;all these were laid face downwards in the box. Viewed by what wep. 96know of the ideas which underlay the use of wax figures by the Egyptians and Greeks, itis clear that, in providing Alexander with these models and the words of power to usewith them, Aristotle believed he was giving him the means of making his enemies tobecome like the figures in the box, and so they would be powerless to attack him.1In the Græco-Roman period2 wax figures were used in the performance of magicalceremonies of every kind, and the two following examples indicate that the ideas whichunderlay their use had not changed in the least. If a lover wished to secure the favours ofhis mistress, he is directed to make a figure of a dog in wax mixed with pitch, gum, etc.,eight fingers long, and certain words of power are to be written over the place where hisribs should be. Next it was necessary to write on a tablet other words of power, or thenames of beings who were supposed to possess magical powers; on this tablet the figureof the dog must be placed, and the tablet is made to rest upon a tripod. When this hasbeen done the lover must recite the words of power which are written on the dog's side,and also the names which have been inscribed on the tablet, and one of two things willhappen:i.e., the dog will either snarlp. 97and snap at the lover, or he will bark. If he snarls and snaps the lover will not gain theobject of his affections, but if he barks the lady will come to him. In the second examplethe lover is ordered to make two waxen figures; one in the form of Ares, and the other inthe form of a woman. The female figure is to be in the posture of kneeling upon her kneeswith her hands tied behind her, and the male figure is to stand over her with his sword ather throat. On the limbs of the female figure a large number of the names of demons areto be written, and when this has been done, the lover must take thirteen bronze needles,and stick them in her limbs, saying as he does so, \"I pierce\" (here he mentions the nameof the limb) \"that she may think of me.\" The lover must next write certain words ofpower on a leaden plate, which must be tied to the wax figures with a string containingthree hundred and sixty-five knots, and both figure and plate are to be buried in the graveof some one who has died young or who has been slain by violence. He must then recite along incantation to the infernal gods, and if all these things be done in a proper mannerthe lover will obtain the woman's affections.1From Egypt, by way of Greece and Rome, the use ofp. 98"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"wax figures passed into Western Europe and England, and in the Middle Ages it foundgreat favour with those who interested themselves in the working of the \"black art,\" orwho wished to do their neighbour or enemy an injury. Many stories are current of how inItaly and England ignorant or wicked-minded people made models of their enemies inwax and hung them up in the chimney, not too close to the fire, so that they might meltaway slowly, and of how the people that were represented by such figures gradually lostthe power over their limbs, and could not sleep, and slowly sickened and died. If pins andneedles were stuck into the wax figures at stated times the sufferings of the living weremade more agonizing, and their death much more painful.Sharpe relates1 that about the end of the VIIth century king Duffus was so unpopular that\"a company of hags roasted his image made of wax upon a wooden spit, reciting certainwords of enchantment, and basting the figure with a poisonous liquor. These womenwhen apprehended declared that as the wax melted, the body of the king should decay,and the words of enchantment prevented him from the refreshment of sleep.\" The twofollowing extracts from Thomas Middleton'sThe Witch2 illustrate the views held aboutwax figures in England in the time of this writer.3p. 99I.\"Heccat.

Thus an old woman at Mendip had a pig that fell ill, and she at once madeup her mind that the animal had been \"overlooked\"; in her trouble she consulted a \"whitewitch,\"i.e. a \"wise\" man, and by his orders she acted thus. She obtained a sheep's heart,and having stuck it full of pins1 set it to roast before a fire, whilst her friends andneighbours sang:--It is not this heart I mean to burn.But the person's heart I wish to turn,Wishing them neither rest nor peaceTill they are dead and gone.\"At intervals her son George sprinkled salt on the fire which added greatly to theweirdness of the scene, and at length, when the roasting had been continued until far intothe night, a black cat jumped out from somewhere and was, of course, instantly declaredto be the demon which had been exorcised. Again, in October, 1882, a heart stuck full ofpins was found in a recess of a chimney in an old house in the village of Ashbrittle; andin 1890 another was found nailed up inside the \"clavel\" in the chimney of an old house atStaplegrove.The art of making such figures King James I. attributes to the \"Divell,\" and says indescribing thep. 101things which witches are able to \"effectuate by the power of their master1\":--\"To someothers at these times hee teacheth, how to make pictures of waxe or clay: That by theroasting thereof, the persons that they beare the name of, may be continually melted ordried away by continuall sicknesse. . . . They can bewitch and take the life of men orwomen, by roasting of the pictures, as I spake of before, which likewise is verie possibleto their Maister to performe, for although (as I said before) that instrument of waxe haveno vertue in that turne doing, yet may hee not very well, even by the same measure thathis conjured slaves, melts that waxe at the fire, may hee not, I say at these same times,subtily, as a sprite, so weaken and scatter the spirites of life of the patient, as may makehim on the one part, for faintnesse, so sweate it out the humour of his bodie: And on theother parte, for the not concurrence of these spirites, which causes his digestion, so"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"debilitate his stomacke, that this humour radicall continually sweating out on the onepart, and no new good sucke being put in the place thereof, for lacke of digestion on theother, he at last shall vanish away, even as his picture will die at the fire? And thatknavish and cunning workeman, by troubling him, onely at sometimes, makes aproportion, so neere betwixt the working of the one and the other,p. 102that both shall end as it were at one time.\" Thus we have seen that the belief in theefficacy of wax figures is at least six thousand years old, and judging from passages inthe works of modern writers its existence is not unknown in our own country at thepresent time.This chapter may be fittingly ended by a notice of the benefits which accrued to aChristian merchant in the Levant from the use of a wax figure. According to an Ethiopicmanuscript in the British Museum1 this man was a shipowner as well as a merchant, andbe was wont to send his goods to market in his own ships; in his day, however, the seawas infested with pirates, and he lost greatly through their successful attacks upon hisvessels. At length he determined to travel in one of his own ships with a number of armedmen, so that he might be able to resist any attack which the pirates might make, andpunish them for their robberies in times past. . Soon after he had sailed he fell in with apirate vessel, and a fight at once took place between his crew and the robbers, in thecourse of which he was shot in the eye by an arrow; he stopped the combat and thensailed for a port which was situated near a monastery, wherein the Virgin Mary wasreported to work miracles by means of a picture of herself which was hung up in it. Whenthe merchant arrived in port he was so ill through the wound in his eye that he could notbe moved, and it was found that a portionp. 103of the arrow which had struck him remained embedded in it; and unless he could obtainthe Virgin's help speedily he felt that his death was nigh. In this difficulty a certainChristian came to the ship and made a wax figure of the merchant, and, having stuck inone eye a model of the arrow which had struck him, carried the figure to the monastery,which was some miles off, and caused the monks to allow him to bring it nigh to thepicture of the Virgin. When this had been done, and prayers had been made to her, thefigure of the Virgin stretched out its hand, and straightway pulled the model of the arrowout of the eye of the wax figure of the merchant in such a way that no broken fragmentremained behind. When the wax figure had been taken back to the ship, it was found thatthe piece of broken arrow had been extracted from the merchant's eye at the very momentwhen the Virgin had drawn out the arrow from the eye of the wax figure. The merchant'seye then healed, and he recovered his sight."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Footnotes67:1 Ed.

Besides this, hebelieved greatly in the efficacy of representations or pictures of the gods, and of divinebeings and things, provided that words of power properly recited by properly appointedpeople were recited over them. If this fact be borne in mind a great many difficulties inunderstanding religious texts disappear, and many apparently childish facts are seen tohave an important meaning. If we look into the tombs of the early period we see paintedon the walls numbers of scenes in which the deceased is represented making offerings tothe gods and performing religious ceremonies, as well as numbers of others in which beis directing the work of his estate and ruling his household. It was not altogether theresult of pride that such picturesp. 105were painted on the walls of tombs, for at the bottom of his heart the Egyptian hoped andbelieved that they were in reality representations of what he would do in the next world,and he trusted that the words of his prayers would turn pictures into realities, anddrawings into substances.

It was ail article of faith among allclasses that unless theka was properly fed it would be driven to wander about and pickup filth and anything else of that nature which itp. 106found in its path, as we may see from the LIInd Chapter of the Book of the Dead, inwhich the deceased says, \"That which is an abomination unto me, that which is anabomination unto me let me not eat.

Therich man, even, was not certain that the appointed offerings of meat and drink could orwould be made in his tomb in perpetuity: what then was the poor man to do to save his kafrom the ignominy of eating filth and drinking dirty water?p. 107[paragraph continues] To get out of this difficulty the model of an altar in stone was made, andmodels of cakes, vases of water, fruit, meat, etc., were placed upon it; in cases where thiswas not possible figures of the offerings were sculptured upon the stone itself; in others,where even the expense of an altar could not be borne by the relatives of the dead, analtar with offerings painted upon it was placed in the tomb, and as long as it existedthrough the prayers recited, theka did not lack food. Sometimes neither altar, nor modelnor picture of an altar was placed in the tomb, and the prayer that sepulchral meals mightbe given to the deceased by the gods, which was inscribed upon some article of funeralfurniture, was the only provision made for the wants of theka; but every time any onewho passed by the tomb recited that prayer, and coupled with it the name of the man whowas buried in it, hiska was provided with a fresh supply of meat and drink offerings, forthe models or pictures of them in the inscription straightway became veritable substances.On the insides of the wooden coffins of the XIIth dynasty, about B.C. 2500, are paintedwhole series of objects which, in still earlier times, were actually placed in the tombswith the mummy; but litt le by little men ceased to provide the numerous articlesconnected with the sepulture of the dead which the old ritual prescribed, and they trustedto the texts and formulæ which they painted on the coffin to turn pictures into substances,andp. 108besides the pillow they placed little else in the tomb.About a thousand years later, when the religious texts which formed the Book of theDead were written upon papyri instead of coffins, a large number of illustrations or"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"vignettes were added to them; to many of these special importance was attached, and thefollowing are worthy of note.It will be remembered that the CXXVth Chapter of the Book of the Dead contains the so-called \"Negative Confession\" which is recited in the Hall of Maâti, and a number ofnames of gods and beings, the knowledge of which is most important for the welfare ofthe deceased. At the end of the Chapter we find the following statement:--\"This chaptershall be said by the deceased after he hath been cleansed and purified, and when he isarrayed in apparel, and is shod with white leather sandals, and his eyes have been paintedwith antimony, and his body hath been anointed withânti unguent, and when he hathmade offerings of oxen, and birds, and incense, and cakes, and ale, and garden herbs.And behold, thou shalt paint a picture of what shall happen in the Hall of Maâti upon anew tile moulded from earth, upon which neither a pig nor any other animal hath trodden.And if thou writest upon it this chapter the deceased shall flourish; and his children shallflourish; and his name shall never fall into oblivion; and bread, andp. 109cakes, and sweetmeats, and wine, and meat shall be given unto him at the altar of thegreat god; and he shall not be turned back at any door in the underworld; and he shall bebrought in along with the Kings of the North and South; and he shall be in the followingof Osiris always and for ever.\" Here, then, we have an excellent example of the far-reaching effects of a picture accompanied by the proper words of power, and everypicture in the Book of the Dead was equally efficacious in producing a certain result, thatresult being always connected with the welfare of the dead.According to several passages and chapters the deceased was terrified lest he should lackboth air and water, as well as food, in the underworld, and, to do away with all risk ofsuch a calamity happening, pictures, in which he is represented holding a sail (the symbolof air and wind and breath) in his hands, and standing up to his ankles in water,1 werepainted on his papyrus, and texts similar to the following were written below them. \"Mymouth and my nostrils are opened in Tattu (Busiris), and I have my place of peace inAnnu (Heliopolis) which is my house; it was built for me by the goddess Sesheta, and thegod Khnemu set it upon its walls for me. . . .\" \"Hail, thou god Tem, grant thou unto methe sweet breath which dwelleth in thy nostrils! I embrace the great throne which is inKhemennu (Hermopolis), and Ip. 110keep watch over the Egg of the Great Cackler; I germinate as it germinateth; I live as itliveth; and my breath is its breath.\"1 But yet another \"exceeding great mystery\" had to beperformed if the deceased was to be enabled to enter into heaven by its four doors at will,and to enjoy the air which came through each. The north wind belonged to Osiris, thesouth wind to Râ, the west wind to Isis, and the east wind to Nephthys; and for thedeceased to obtain power over each and all of these it was necessary for him to be masterof the doors through which they blew. This power could only be obtained by causingpictures of the four doors to be painted on the coffin with a figure of Thoth opening each."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Some special importance was attached to these, for the rubric says, \"Let none who isoutside know this chapter, for it is a great mystery, and those who dwell in the swamps(i.e., the ignorant) know it not. Thou shalt not do this in the presence of any personexcept thy father, or thy son, or thyself alone; for it is indeed an exceedingly greatmystery which no man whatever knoweth.\"2One of the delights coveted by the deceased was to sail over heaven in the boat of Râ, incompany with the gods of the funeral cycle of Osiris; this happiness could be secured forhim by painting certain pictures, and by saying over them certain words of power. Onp. 111a piece of clean papyrus a boat is to be drawn with ink made of greenâbut mixed withânti water, and in it are to be figures of Isis, Thoth, Shu, and Khepera, and the deceased;when this has been done the papyrus must be fastened to the breast of the deceased, carebeing taken that it does not actually touch his body. Then shall his spirit enter into theboat of Râ each day, and the god Thoth shall take heed to him, and he shall sail aboutwith Râ into any place that he wisheth.1 Elsewhere it is ordered that the boat of Râ bepainted \"in a pure place,\" and in the bows is to be painted a figure of the deceased; but Râwas supposed to travel in one boat (called \"Âtet \") until noon, and another (called\"Sektet\") until sunset, and provision had to be made for the deceased in both boats. Howwas this to be done? On one side of the picture of the boat a figure of the morning boat ofRâ was to be drawn, and on the other a figure of the afternoon boat; thus the one picturewas capable of becoming two boats. And, provided the proper offerings were made forthe deceased on the birthday of Osiris, his soul would live for ever, and be would not diea second time.2 According to the rubric to the chapter3 in which these directions aregiven, the text of it is as old, at least, as the time of Hesepti, the fifth king of the Istdynasty, who reigned about B.C. 4350, and the custom of painting the boat uponp. 112papyrus is probably contemporaneous. The two following rubrics from ChaptersCXXXIII. and CXXXIV., respectively, will explain still further the importance of suchpictures:--1. \"This chapter shall be recited over a boat four cubits in length, and made of greenporcelain [on which have been painted] the divine sovereign chiefs of the cities; and afigure of heaven with its stars shall be made also, and this thou shalt have madeceremonially pure by means of natron and incense. And behold, thou shalt make animage of Râ in yellow colour upon a new plaque and set it at the bows of the boat. Andbehold, thou shalt make an image of the spirit which thou dost wish to make perfect [andplace it] in this boat, and thou shalt make it to travel about in the boat [which. shall bemade in the form of the boat] of Râ; and he shall see the form of the god Râ himselftherein. Let not the eye of any man whatsoever look upon it, with the exception of thineown self, or thy father, or thy son, and guard [this] with great care. Then shall the spiritbe perfect in the heart of Râ, and it shall give unto him power with the company of thegods; and the gods shall look upon him as a divine being like unto themselves; and"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"mankind and the dead shall fall down upon their faces, and he shall be seen in theunderworld in the form of the radiance of Râ.\"2. \"This chapter shall be recited over a hawkp. 113standing and having the white crown upon his head, [and over figures of] the gods Tem,Shu, Tefnut, Seb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Suti, and Nephthys, painted in yellow colour upon anew plaque, which shall be placed in [a model of] the boat [of Râ], along with a figure ofthe spirit whom thou wouldst make perfect, These thou shalt anoint with cedar oil, andincense shall he offered up to them on the fire, and feathered fowl,The soul of the scribe Ani visiting his mummified body as it lies on its bier in the tomb.(From thePapyrus of Ani, plate 17.)shall be roasted.

But the ideas which prompted the painting ofother vignettes are not so clear,e.g., those which accompany Chapters CLXII.-CLXV. inthe late or Säite Recension of the Book of the Dead, although, fortunately, the rubrics tothese chapters make their object clear. Thus the picture which stands above ChapterCLXII. is that of a cow having upon her head horns, a disk, and two plumes,p. 115and from the rubric we learn that a figure of it was to be made in gold and fastened to theneck of the deceased, and that another, drawn upon new papyrus, was to be placed underhis head.

It is quiteevident that the words of power, or charm, uttered by Isis-Hathor delivered the god out ofsome trouble, and the idea is that as it delivered the god, and was of benefit to him, evenso will it deliver the deceased and be of benefit to him. The words of power read:--\"OAmen, O Amen, who art in heaven, turn thy face upon the dead body of thy son, andmake him sound and strong in the underworld.\" And again we are warned that the wordsare \"a great mystery\" and that \"the eye of no man whatsoever must see it, for it is a thingof abomination for [every man] to know it. Hide it, therefore; the Book of the lady of thehidden temple is its name.\"An examination of mummies of the late period shews that the Egyptians did actuallydraw a figure of the cow upon papyrus and lay it under the head of the deceased, and thatthe cow is only one figure among a number of others which were drawn on the samepapyrus. With the figures magical texts were inscribed and in course of time, when thepapyrus had been mounted upon linen, it superseded the gold figure of the cow whichwas fastened to the neck of the deceased, and became, strictly speaking an amulet, thoughits usual name among archaeologists is \"hypocephalus.\" The figure on the opposite pagewell illustrates the object.

The first group of gods are:--Nehebkaoffering to Horus his Eye, a goddess with the Eye of Horus for a head, the cow of Isis-Hathor described above, the four children of Horus, two lions, a member of the humanbody, the pylon of heads of Khnemu the god of reproduction, and Horus-Râ. In thesecond are the boat of the Sun being poled along by Horus, and the boat of the Moon,with Harpocrates in the bow. In the other scenes we have the god Khepera in his boat,Horus in his boat, and Horus-Sept in his boat. The god with two faces represents thedouble aspect of the sun in setting and rising, and the god with the rams' heads, who isbeing adored by apes, is a mystical form of Khnemu, one of the great gods ofreproduction, who in still later times became the being whose name under the form ofKhnumis or Khnoubis occupied such an important position among the magical nameswhich were in use among the Gnostics. The two following prayers from the hypocephaluswill illustrate the words of power addressed to Amen,i.e., the Hidden One, quotedabove:--1. \"I am the Hidden One in the hidden place.

Grant thou unto me an entranceand an exit in the underworld without let or hindrance.\"Chapter CLXIII. of the Book of the Dead was written to prevent the body of a manmouldering away in the underworld, and to deliver him from the souls which were sounfortunate as to be shut in the various places thereof, but in order to make it thoroughlyefficacious it was ordered to be recited over three pictures: (1) a serpent with legs, havinga disk and two horns upon its head; (2) anutchat,1 or Eye of Horus, \"in the pupil ofwhich shall be a figure of the God of the lifted hand with the face of a divine soul, andhaving plumes and a back like a hawk\"; (3) anutchat, or Eye of Horus, \"in the pupil ofwhichp. 121there shall be a figure of the God of the lifted hand with the face of the goddess Neith,and having plumes and a back like a hawk.\" If these things be done for the deceased \"heshall not be turned back at any gate of the underworld, he shall eat, and drink, andperform the natural functions of his body as he did when he was upon earth; and noneshall rise up to cry out against him; and he shall be protected from the hands of the enemyfor ever and ever.\"1The words of power which form the CLXIVth Chapter to be effectual had to be recitedover a figure of the goddess Mut which was to have three heads. The first head was likethat of the goddess Pekhat and had plumes; the second was like that of a man and hadupon it the crowns of the South and North; the third was like that of a vulture and hadupon it plumes; the figure had a pair of wings, and the claws of a lion. This figure waspainted in black, green, and yellow colours upon a piece ofanes linen; in front of it andbehind it was painted a dwarf who wore plumes upon his head. One hand and arm of eachdwarf were raised, and each had two faces, one being that of a hawk and the other that ofa man; the body of each was fat. These figures having been made, we are told that thedeceased shall be \"like unto a god with the gods of the underworld; he shall never, neverbe turned back; his flesh and his bones shall be likep. 122those of one who hath never been dead; he shall drink water at the source of the stream; ahomestead shall be given unto him in Sekhet-Aaru; he shall become a star of heaven; heshall set out to do battle with the serpent fiend Nekau and with Tar, who are in the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"underworld; he shall not be shut in along with the souls which are fettered; he shall havepower to deliver himself wherever he may be; and worms shall not devour him.\"1Again, the words of power which form the CLXVth Chapter to be effectual were orderedby the rubric to \"be recited over a figure of the God of the lifted hand, which shall haveplumes upon its head; the legs thereof shall be wide apart, and the middle portion of itshall be in the form of a beetle, and it shall be painted blue with a paint made of lapis-lazuli mixed withqamai water. And it shall be recited over a figure with a head like untothat of a man, and the hands and the arms thereof shall be stretched away from his body;above its right shoulder shall there be the head of a ram, and above its left shoulder shallthere be the head of a ram. And thou shalt paint the figure of the God of the lifted handupon a piece of linen immediately over the heart of the deceased, and thou shalt paint theother over his breast; but let not the god Sukati who is in the underworld know it.\" Ifthese things be done, \"the deceased shallp. 123drink water from the source of the stream, and he shall shine like the stars in the heavensabove.\" It is probable that Chapters CLXIL-CLXV. were composed at a comparativelylate date.Yet another example of the magical pictures of the Book of the Dead must here be given.The vignette of Chapter CXLVIII. contains pictures of seven cows \"and their bull,\" andof four rudders; the seven cows have reference to the seven Hathor goddesses, the bull is,of course, a form of Râ, and the four rudders refer to the four quarters of the earth and tothe four cardinal points. The text of the Chapter contains the names of the cows and ofthe bull, and of the rudders, and certain prayers for sepulchral. offerings. Now thedeceased would be provided with \"abundance of food regularly and continually for ever,\"if the following things were done for him. Figures of the cows and of their bull and of therudders were to be painted in colours upon a board (?), and when Râ, the Sun-god, roseupon them the friends of the deceased were to place offerings before them; theseofferings would be received mystically by the gods and goddesses whom the figuresrepresented, and in return they would bestow upon the deceased all the offerings or giftsof meat and drink which he would require. Moreover, \"if this be done,\" we are told, \"Râshall be a rudder for the deceased, and he shall be a strength protecting him, and he shallmake an end of all his enemies forp. 124him in the underworld, and in heaven, and upon earth, and in every place wherever hemay enter.\"We have seen above, in the description of the amulets which the Egyptians used, howboth the substance of the amulet and the words which were inscribed upon it possessedmagical powers, but we may learn from several instances given in the papyri that thewritten words alone were sufficient in some cases to produce remarkable effects. This is,of course, a very natural development, and charms or words of power which needed"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"nothing but to be written on papyrus or linen to produce a magical effect would bepopular with all classes of men and women, and especially among the poor and theignorant. The written word has been regarded in the East with reverence from timeimmemorial, and a copy of a sacred writing or text is worn or carried about to this daywith much the same ideas and beliefs about its power to protect as in the earliest times. Inancient Egypt the whole Book of the Dead, as well as the various sections of it which areusually copied on papyri, consisted of a series of \"words of power,\" and the modernEgyptian looks upon the Koran in the same light as his ancestor looked upon the olderwork. A curious passage in the text inscribed on the inside of the pyramid of Unas reads(1. 583), \"The bone and flesh which possess no writing are wretched, but, behold, thewriting of Unas is under the great seal, and behold, it is not under the little seal.\" It isp. 125difficult to explain the passage fully, but there is no doubt that we have here an allusionto the custom of placing writings believed to be possessed of magical powers with thedead. Certain passages or sections of the religious books of ancient nations have alwaysbeen held to be of more importance than others, and considering the great length of suchcompositions this is not to be wondered at. Among the Egyptians two forms of theLXIVth Chapter of the Book of the Dead were in use, and there is no doubt whatever thatthe shorter form, as far back as the Ist dynasty, about B.C. 4300, was intended to be asummary of the whole work, and that the recital of it was held to be as efficacious as therecital of all the rest of it.1 It is a remarkable fact that this form is called \"The Chapter ofknowing the 'Chapters of Coming Forth by Day' in a single Chapter,\" and that it isdeclared to date from the time of Hesepti, a king of the Ist dynasty, about B.C. 4300,whilst the \"finding\" of the longer form is attributed to the reign of Men-kau-Râ(Mycerinus), a king of the IVth dynasty, about B.C. 3600. It is interesting to note howpersistently certain chapters and formulæ occur in funeral papyri of different periods, andthe explanation seems to be that a popular selection was made at an early date, and thatthis selection wasp. 126copied with such additions or omissions as the means of the friends of the deceasedallowed or made necessary. One thing is quite certain: every man in Egypt died in thefirm belief that in the course of his journey into the next world he would be provided withwords of power which would enable him to make his way thither unhindered, and givehim abundance of meat and drink. We may see this view which was held concerningwords of power from the following passages:--\"May Thoth, who is filled and furnishedwith words of power, come and loose the bandages, even the bandages of Set which fettermy mouth. . . . Now as concerning the words of power and all the words which may bespoken against me, may the gods resist them, and may each and every one of thecompany of the gods withstand them.\"1 \"Behold, I gather together the word of powerfrom wherever it is, and from any person with whom it is, swifter than greyhounds andquicker than light.\"2 To the crocodile which cometh to carry off from the deceased hiswords of power he says, \"Get thee back, return, get thee back, thou crocodile fiend Sui!Thou shalt not advance to me, for I live by reason of the words of power which I have"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"with me. . . . Heaven hath power over its seasons, and the words of power have dominionover that which they possess; my mouth therefore shall have power over the words ofpower which arep. 127therein.\"1 \"I am clothed (?) and am wholly provided with thy magical words, O Râ, thewhich are in the heaven above me, and in the earth beneath Me.\"2 To the two Sister-Mertgoddesses the deceased says, \"My message to you is my words of power. I shine from theSektet boat, I am Horus the son of Isis, and I have come to see my father Osiris.\"3 \"Ihave become a spirit in my forms, I have gained the mastery over my words of power,and it is decreed for me to be a spirit.\"4 \"Hail, thou that cuttest off heads, and slittestbrows, thou who puttest away the memory of evil things from the mouth of the spirits bymeans of the words of power which they have within them, . . . let not my mouth be shutfast by reason of the words of power which thou hast within thee. . . . Get thee back, anddepart before the words which the goddess Isis uttered when thou didst come to cast therecollection of evil things into the mouth of Osiris.\"5 On the amulet of the Buckle wehave inscribed the words, \"May the blood of Isis, and the powers of Isis, and the words ofpower of Isis be mighty to protect this mighty one,\" etc., and in the address which Thothmakes to Osiris he says, \"I am Thoth, the favoured one of Râ, the lord of might, whobringeth to a prosperous end that which he doeth, the mighty one of words of power, whois in the boat ofp. 128millions of years, the lord of laws, the subduer of the two lands,\" etc.1From the above passages we not only learn how great was the confidence which thedeceased placed in his words of power, but also that the sources from which they sprangwere the gods Thoth and Isis. It will be remembered that Thoth is called the \"scribe of thegods,\" the \"lord of writing,\" the \"master of papyrus,\" the maker of the palette and the ink-jar,\" the \"lord of divine words,\"i.e., the holy writings or scriptures, and as he was the lordof books and master of the power of speech, he was considered to be the possessor of allknowledge both human and divine. At the creation of the world it was he who reduced towords the will of the unseen and unknown creative Power, and who uttered them in suchwise that the universe came into being, and it was he who proved himself by the exerciseof his knowledge to be the protector and friend of Osiris, and of Isis, and of their sonHorus. From the evidence of the texts we know that it was not by physical might thatThoth helped these three gods, but by giving them words of power and instructing themhow to use them. We know that Osiris vanquished his foes, and that he reconstituted hisbody, and became the king of the underworld and god of the dead, but he was only ableto do these things by means of the words of power which Thoth had given to him,p. 129and which he had taught him to pronounce properly and in a proper tone of voice. It isthis belief which makes the deceased cry out, \"Hail, Thoth, who madest Osiris victorious"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"over his enemies, make thou Ani to be victorious over his enemies in the presence of thegreat and sovereign princes who are in Tattu,\" or in any other place. Without the words ofpower given to him by Thoth, Osiris would have been powerless under the attacks of hisfoes, and similarly the dead man, who was always identified with Osiris, would havepassed out of existence at his death but for the words of power provided by the writingsthat were buried with him. In the Judgment Scene it is Thoth who reports to the gods theresult of the weighing of the heart in the balance, and who has supplied its owner with thewords which he has uttered in his supplications, and whatever can be said in favour of thedeceased he says to the gods, and whatever can be done for him he does. But apart frombeing the protector and friend of Osiris, Thoth was the refuge to which Isis fled in hertrouble. The words of a hymn declare that she knew \"how to turn aside evil hap,\" and thatshe was \"strong of tongue, and uttered the words of power which she knew with correctpronunciation, and halted not in her speech, and was perfect both in giving the commandand in saying the word,\"1 but this description onlyp. 130proves that she had been instructed by Thoth in the art of uttering words of power witheffect, and to him, indeed, she owed more than this. When she found the dead body of herhusband Osiris, she hovered about over it in the form of a bird, making air by the beatingof her wings, and sending forth light from the sheen of her feathers, and at length sheroused the dead to life by her words of power; as the result of the embrace whichfollowed this meeting Horus was born, and his mother suckled him and tended him in herhiding-place in the papyrus swamps. After a time she was persecuted by Set, herhusband's murderer, who, it seems, shut her and her son Horus up in a house as prisoners.Owing, however, to the help which Thoth gave her, she came forth by night and wasaccompanied on her journey by seven scorpions,1 called respectively Tefen, Befen,Mestet, Mestetef, Petet, Thetet, and Matet, the last three of which pointed out the way.The guide of the way brought her to the swamps of Per-sui,2 and to the town of the twogoddesses of the sandals where the swampy country of Athu begins. Journeying on theycame to Teb,3 where the chief of the district had a house for his ladies; now the mistressof the house would notp. 131admit Isis on account of the scorpions that were with her, for she had looked out of herdoor and watched Isis coming. On this the scorpions took counsel together and wished tosting her by means of the scorpion Tefen, but at this moment a poor woman who lived inthe marshes opened the door of her cottage to Isis, and the goddess took shelter therein.Meanwhile the scorpion had crept under the door into the house of the governor, andstung the son of the lady of the house, and also set the place on fire; no water couldquench the fire, and there was no rain to do it, for it was not then the rainy season. Nowthese things happened to the woman who had done no active harm to Isis, and the poorcreature wandered about the streets of the city uttering loud cries of grief and distressbecause she knew not whether her boy would live or die."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"When Isis saw this she was sorry for the child who had been stung, and as he wasblameless in the matter of the door of his mother's house being shut in the face of thegoddess, she determined to save him. Thereupon she cried out to the distraught mother,saying, \"Come to me, come to me! For my word is a talisman which beareth life. I am adaughter well known in thy city also, and I will do away the evil by means of the word ofmy mouth which my father hath taught me, for I am the daughter of his own body.\" ThenIsis laid her hands upon the body of the boy, andp. 132in order to bring back the spirit into his body said--\"Come Tefen, appear upon the ground, depart hence, come not nigh!\"Come poison of Befen, appear upon the ground. I am Isis, the goddess, the lady ofwords of power, who doeth deeds of magic, the words of whose voice are charms.\"Obey me, O every reptile that stingeth, and fall down headlong!\"O poison of [Mestet and] Mestetef, mount not upwards!\"O poison of Petet and Thetet, draw not nigh! O Matet, fall down headlong!\"The goddess Isis then uttered certain words of the charm which had been given to her bythe god Seb in order to keep poison away from her, and said, \"Turn away, get away,retreat, O poison,\" adding the words \"Mer-Râ\" in the morning and \"The Egg of the Gooseappeareth from out of the sycamore\" in the evening, as she turned to the scorpions. Boththese sentences were talismans. After this Isis lamented that she was more lonely andwretched than all the people of Egypt, and that she had become like an old man who hathceased to look upon and to visit fair women in their houses; and she ordered the scorpionsto turn away their looks from her and to show her the way to the marshes and to thesecret place which is in the city ofp. 133[paragraph continues] Khebt. Then the words of the cry, \"The boy liveth, the poison dieth! As thesun liveth, so the poison dieth,\" were uttered, and the fire in the house of the woman wasextinguished, and heaven rejoiced at the words of Isis. When Isis had said that the \"son ofthe woman had been stung because his mother had shut the door of her house in her face,and had done nothing for her,\" the words of the cry, \"The boy liveth and the poisondieth,\" were again uttered, and the son of the woman recovered.Isis then continues her narrative thus:--\"I Isis conceived a child, and was great with childof Horus. I, a goddess, gave birth to Horus, the son of Isis, upon an island (or nest) inAthu the region of swamps; and I rejoiced greatly because of this, for I regarded Horus asa gift which would repay me for the loss of his father. I hid him most carefully andconcealed him in my anxiety, and indeed he was well hidden, and then I went away to the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"city of Am. When I had saluted the inhabitants thereof I turned back to seek the child, sothat I might give him suck and take him in my arms again. But I found my sucking-childHorus the fair golden one, well nigh dead! He had bedewed the ground with the waterfrom his eye and with the foam from his lips, his body was stiff, his heart was still, andno muscle in any of his limbs moved.1 Then I uttered a bitter cryp. 134of grief, and the dwellers in the papyrus swamps ran to me straightway from out of theirhouses, and they bewailed the greatness of my calamity; but none of them opened hismouth to speak, for every one was in deep sorrow for me, and no man knew how to bringback life into Horus. Then there came to me a certain woman who was well known in hercity, for she belonged to a noble family, and she tried to rekindle the life in Horus, butalthough her heart was full of her knowledge my son remained motionless.\" Meanwhilethe folk remarked that the son of the divine mother Isis had been protected against hisbrother Set, that the plants among which he had been hidden could not be penetrated byany hostile being, that the words of power of Temu, the father of the gods, \"who is inheaven,\" should have preserved the life of Horus, that Set his brother could not possiblyhave had access to where the child was, who, in any case, had been protected against hiswickedness; and at length it was discovered that Horus had been stung by a scorpion, andthat the reptile \"which destroyethp. 135the heart\" had wounded him, and had probably killed him.At this juncture Nephthys arrived, and went round about among the papyrus swampsweeping bitterly because of the affliction of her sister Isis; with her also was Serqet, thegoddess of scorpions, who asked continually, \"What hath happened to the child Horus?\"Then Nephthys said to Isis, \"Cry out in prayer unto heaven, and let the mariners in theboat of Râ cease to row, and let not the boat of Râ move further on its course for the sakeof the child Horus\"; and forthwith Isis sent forth her cry up to heaven, and made herrequest come unto the \"Boat of millions of years,\" and the Sun stood still and his boatmoved not from its place by reason of the goddess's petition. Out from the boat came thegod Thoth provided with magical powers, and bearing with him the great power tocommand in such wise that the words of his mouth must be fulfilled straightway; and hespake to Isis, saying \"O thou goddess Isis, whose mouth knoweth how to utter charms (ortalismans), no suffering shall come upon thy child Horus, for his health and safety dependupon the boat of Râ. I have come this day in the divine boat of the Disk (Aten) to theplace where it was yesterday. When darkness (or night) ruleth, the light shall vanquish itfor the health (or safety) of Horus for the sake of his mother Isis and similarly shall ithappen unto every one whop. 136possesseth what is [here] written(?).\" What took place next is, of course, evident. Thechild Horus was restored to life, to the great joy of his mother Isis, who was more"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"indebted than ever to the god Thoth for coming to deliver her out of her trouble on thedeath of her son, just as he had done on the death of her husband. Now because Isis hadrevivified both her husband and her son by the words of power and talismans which shepossessed, mortal man thought it was absolutely necessary for him to secure her favourand protection at any cost, for eternal life and death were in her hands. As time went onthe Egyptians revered her more and more, and as she was the lady of the gods and ofheaven, power equal to that possessed by Râ himself was ascribed to her. Indeed,according to a legend which has come down to us, and which written upon papyrus orlinen formed a magical formula against the poison of reptiles of all kinds, she made abold attempt to wrest the power of Râ from him and to make herself mistress of theuniverse. The way in which she did this is told in a hieratic papyrus preserved at Turin,1from which the following rendering has been made; the merit of first discovering thecorrect meaning of the text belongs to M. Lefébure.p. 137THE LEGEND OF RÂ AND ISIS.\"The Chapter of the divine god, the self-created being) who made the heavens and theearth, and the winds [which give] life, and the fire, and the gods, and men, and beasts,and cattle, and reptiles, and the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea; he is the king ofmen and of gods, he hath one period of life (?) and with him periods of one hundred andtwenty years each are but as years; his names are manifold and unknown, the gods evenknow them not.\"Now Isis was a woman who possessed words of power; her heart was wearied with themillions of men, therefore she chose the millions of the gods, but she esteemed morehighly the millions of the spirits (khu). And she meditated in her heart, saying, 'Cannot Iby means of the sacred name of God make myself mistress of the earth and become agoddess like unto Râ in heaven and upon earth?' Now behold, each day Râ entered at thehead of his holy mariners and established himself upon the throne of the two horizons.Now the divine one (i.e., Râ) had grown old, he dribbled at the mouth, his spittle fellupon the earth, and his slobbering dropped upon the ground. And Isis kneaded it withearth in her hand, and formed thereof a sacred serpent in the form of a dart; she did notset it upright before her face, but let it lie upon the ground in the pathp. 138whereby the great god went forth, according to his hearts desire, into his double kingdom.Now the holy god arose, and the gods who followed him as though he were Pharaoh wentwith him; and he came forth according to his daily wont; and the sacred serpent bit him.The flame of life departed from him, and he who dwelt among the cedars (?) wasovercome. The holy god opened his mouth, and the cry of his majesty reached untoheaven; his company of gods said, 'What hath happened?' and his gods exclaimed, 'Whatis it?' But Râ could not answer, for his jaws trembled and all his members quaked; thepoison spread swiftly through his flesh just as the Nile rusheth through all his land. Whenthe great god had stablished his heart, he cried unto those who were in his train, saying,"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"'Come unto me, O ye who have come into being from my body, ye gods who have comeforth from me, make ye known unto Khepera that a dire calamity hath fallen upon me.My heart perceiveth it, but my eyes see it not; my hand hath not caused it, nor do I knowwho hath done this unto me. Never have I felt such pain, neither can sickness cause morewoe than this. I am a prince, the son of a prince, the sacred essence which hath proceededfrom God. I am the great one, the son of the great one, and my father planned my name; Ihave multitudes of names and multitudes of forms, and my being is in every god. I havebeenp. 139proclaimed by the heralds Temu and Horus, and my father and my mother uttered myname; but it hath been hidden within me by him that begat me, who would not that thewords of power of any seer should have dominion over me. I came forth to look upon thatwhich I had made, I was passing through the world which I had created, when lo!something stung me, but what I know not. Is it fire? Is it water? My heart is on fire, myflesh quaketh, and trembling hath seized all my limbs. Let there be brought unto me mychildren, the gods, who possess the words of power and magical speech, and mouthswhich know how to utter them, and also powers which reach even unto the heavens. Thenthe children of every god came unto him uttering cries of grief. And Isis also came,bringing with her her words of magical power, and her mouth was full of the breath oflife; for her talismans vanquish the pains of sickness, and her words make to live againthe throats of those who are dead. And she spake, saying, 'What hath come to pass, Oholy Father? What hath happened? Is it that a serpent hath bitten thee, and that a thingwhich thou hast created hath lifted up his head against thee? Verily it shall be cast downby my effective words of power, and I will drive it away from before the sight of thysunbeams.' The holy god opened his mouth and said, I was passing along my path, and Iwas goingp. 140through the two regions of my lands according to my hearts desire, to see that which Ihad created, when lo! I was bitten by a serpent which I saw not. Is it fire? Is it water? Iam colder than water, I am hotter than fire. All my flesh sweateth, I quake, my eye hathno strength, I cannot see the sky, and the sweat rusheth to my face even as in the time ofsummer.' Then said Isis unto Râ, 'O tell me thy name, holy Father, for whosoever shall bedelivered by thy name shall live.' And Râ said, 'I have made the heavens and the earth, Ihave knit together the mountains, I have created all that is above them, I have made thewater, I have made to come into being the goddess Meht-urt, and I have made the Bull ofhis mother, from whom spring the delights of love. I have made the heavens, I havestretched out the two horizons like a curtain, and I have placed the soul of the gods withinthem.

I have made the hours, I have created the days, I bring forward the festivals of theyear, I create the Nile-flood. I make the fire of life, and I provide food in the houses. I amKhepera in the morning, I am Râ at noon, and I am Temu at even.' Meanwhile the poison"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"was not taken away from his body, but it pierced deeper, and the great god could nolonger walk.p. 141\"Then said Isis unto Râ, 'What thou hast said is not thy name. O tell it unto me, and thepoison shall depart; for he shall live whose name shall be revealed! Now the poisonburned like fire, and it was fiercer than the flame and the furnace, and the majesty of thegreat god said, 'I consent that Isis shall search into me, and that my name shall pass fromme into her.' Then the god hid himself from the gods, and his place in the Boat ofMillions of Years was empty. And when the time had arrived for the heart of Râ to comeforth, Isis spake unto her son Horus, saying, 'The god hath bound himself by oath todeliver up his two eyes (i.e., the sun and moon).' Thus was the name of the great godtaken from him, and Isis, the lady of words of magical power, said, 'Depart, poison, goforth from Ea. O Eye of Horus, go forth from the god, and shine outside his mouth. It is Iwho work, it is I who make to fall down upon the earth the vanquished poison, for thename of the great god hath been taken away from him. Let Râ live, and let the poison die!Let the poison die, and let Râ live!' These are the words of Isis, the mighty lady, themistress of the gods, who knew Râ by his own name.\"Now from a few words of text which follow the above narrative we learn that the objectof writing it was not so much to instruct the reader as to make a magic formula, for weare told that it was to be recited overp. 142figures of Temu and Horus, and Isis and Horus, that is to say, over figures of Temu theevening sun, Horus the Elder, Horus the son of Isis, and Isis herself. Temu apparentlytakes the place of Râ, for he represents the sun as an old man,i.e., Râ, at the close of hisdaily life when he has lost his strength and power. The text is a charm or magical formulaagainst snake bites, and it was thought that the written letters, which represented thewords of Isis, would save the life of any one who was snake-bitten, just as they saved thelife of Râ. If the full directions as to the use of the figures of Temu, Isis, and the twoHorus gods, were known unto us we should probably find that they were to be made toact in dumb show the scenes which took place between Râ, and Isis when the goddesssucceeded in taking from him his name. Thus we have ample evidence that Isis possessedmarvellous magical powers, and this being so, the issues of life and death, as far as thedeceased was concerned, we know from the texts to have been in her hands. Her words ofpower, too, were a priceless possession, for she obtained them from Thoth, who was thepersonification of the mind and intelligence of the Creator, and thus their origin wasdivine, and from this point of view were inspired.From a papyrus of the Ptolemaic period we obtain some interesting facts about the greatskill in working magic and about the knowledge of magical formulæp. 143"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"which were possessed by a prince called Setnau Khâ-em-Uast. He knew how to use thepowers of amulets and talismans, and how to compose magical formulæ, and he wasmaster both of religious literature and of that of the \"double house of life,\" or library ofmagical books. One day as he was talking of such things one of the king's wise menlaughed at his remarks, and in answer Setnau said, \"If thou wouldst read a bookpossessed of magical powers come with me. and I will show it to thee, the book waswritten by Thoth himself, and in it there are two formulæ. The recital of the first willenchant (or bewitch) heaven, earth, hell, sea, and mountains, and by it thou shalt see allthe birds, reptiles, and fish, for its power will bring the fish to the top of the water. Therecital of the second will enable a man if he be in the tomb to take the form which he hadupon earth,\" etc. When questioned as to where the book was, Setnau said that it was inthe tomb of Ptah-nefer-ka at Memphis. A little later Setnau went there with his brotherand passed three days and three nights in seeking for the tomb of Ptah-nefer-ka, and onthe third day they found it; Setnau recited some words over it, and the earth opened andthey went down to the place where the book was. When the two brothers came into thetomb they found it to be brilliantly lit up by the light which came forth from the book;and when they looked they saw not only Ptah-nefer-ka, but his wife Ahura, and Merhutheirp. 144son. Now Ahura and Merhu were buried at Coptos but their doubles had come to livewith Ptah-nefer-ka by means of the magical power of Thoth. Setnau told them that he hadcome to take away the book, but Ahura begged him not to do so, and related to him themisfortunes which had already followed the possession of it. She was, it seems, the sisterof Ptah-nefer-ka whom she married, and after the birth of her son Merhu, her husbandseemed to devote himself exclusively to the study of magical books, and one day a priestof Ptah promised to tell him where the magical book described above might be found ifhe would give him a hundred pieces of silver, and provide him with two handsomecoffins. When the money and the coffins had been given to him, the priest of Ptah toldPtah-nefer-ka that the book was in an iron box in the middle of the river at Coptos. \"Theiron box is in a bronze box, the bronze box is in a box of palm-tree wood, the palm treewood box is in a box of ebony and ivory, the ebony and ivory box is in a silver box, thesilver box is in a gold box, and in the gold (sic) box lies the book. The box wherein is thebook is surrounded by swarms of serpents and scorpions and reptiles of all kinds, andround it is coiled a serpent which cannot die.\" Ptah-nefer-ka told his wife and the kingwhat he had heard, and at length set out for Coptos with Ahura and Merhu in the royalbarge; having arrived at Coptos he went to the temple of Isis and Harpocrates and offeredupp. 145a sacrifice and poured out a libation to these gods. Five days later the high priest ofCoptos made for him the model of a floating stage and figures of workmen provided withtools; he then recited words of power over them and they became living, breathing men,and the search for the box began. Having worked for three days and three nights theycame to the place where the box was. Ptah-nefer-ka dispersed the serpents and scorpions"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"which were round about the nest of boxes by his words of power, and twice succeeded inkilling the serpent coiled round the box, but it came to life again; the third time he cut itinto two pieces, and laid sand between them, and this time it did not take its old formagain. He then opened the boxes one after the other, and taking out the gold box with thebook inside it carried it to the royal barge. He next read one of the two formula-, in it andso enchanted or bewitched the heavens and the earth that he learned all their secrets; heread the second and he saw the sun rising in the heavens with his company of the gods,etc. His wife Ahura then read the book and saw all that her husband had seen. Ptah-nefer-ka then copied the writings on a piece of new papyrus, and having covered the papyruswith incense dissolved it in water and drank it; thus he acquired the knowledge whichwas in the magical book. Meanwhile these acts had stirred the god Thoth to wrath, and hetold Râ what Ptah-nefer-ka had done. As a result the decreep. 146went forth that Ptah-nefer-ka and his wife and child should never return to Memphis, andon the way back to Coptos Ahura and Merhu fell into the river and were drowned; andwhile returning to Memphis with the book Ptah-nefer-ka himself was drowned also.Setnau, however, refused to be diverted from his purpose, and he insisted on having thebook which he saw in the possession of Ptah-nefer-ka; the latter then proposed to play agame of draughts and to let the winner have the book. The game was for fifty-two points,and although Ptah-nefer-ka tried to cheat Setnau, he lost the game. At this junctureSetnau sent his brother Anhaherurau up to the earth to bring him his talismans of Ptahand his other magical writings, and when he returned he laid them upon Setnau, whostraightway flew up to heaven grasping the wonderful book in his hand. As he went upfrom the tomb light went before him, and the darkness closed in behind him; but Ptah-nefer-ka said to his wife, \"I will make him bring back this book soon, with a knife and arod in his hand and a vessel of fire upon his head.\" Of the bewitchment of Setnau by abeautiful woman called Tabubu and of his troubles in consequence thereof we need makeno mention here: it is sufficient to say that the king ordered him to take the book back toits place, and that the prophecy of Ptah-nefer-ka was fulfilled.1p. 1471n connexion with the subject of the magical powers of Isis must be briefly mentionedthe curious small stelæ, with rounded tops, on the front of which are inscribed figures ofthe god Horus standing upon crocodiles: they are usually known as \"cippi of Horus.\" Thelargest and finest example of this remarkable class of object is the famous\"Metternichstele,\" which was found in the year 1828 during the building of a cistern in aFranciscan monastery in Alexandria, and was presented by Muhammad Ali Pasha toPrince Metternich. We are fortunately enabled to date the stele, for the name ofNectanebus I., the last but one of the native kings of Egypt, who reigned from B.C. 378 toB.C. 360, occurs on it, and we know from many sources that such a monument couldhave been produced only about this period. From the two illustrations of it here given wesee that it is both sculptured and engraved with figures of many of the gods of ancientEgypt, gods well known from the monuments of the earlier dynasties, and also withfigures of a series of demons and monsters and animals which have both mythological"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"and magical importance. Many of these are accompanied by texts containing magicalformulæ,p. 148magical names, and mythological allusions. In the principal scene we see Horus, orHarpocrates, standing upon two crocodiles; on his brow is the uraeus, and he wears onthe right side of his head the lock of hair emblematic of youth. In his hands he graspsserpents, a lion, and an antelope, and it is clear by the look on his face that he is in nowise afraid of them. Above his head is a bearded head, which is usually said to representthat of Bes. On his right are:--(1) anutchat,1 with human hands and arms; (2) Horus-Râ,hawk-headed, and wearing the sun's disk and uraeus, and standing on a serpent coiled up;(3) Osiris, in the form of a hawk standing upon a sceptre, and wearing theatef crown; (4)The goddess Isis standing upon a serpent coiled up; (5) The goddess Nekhebet, in theform of a vulture, standing upon a papyrus sceptre. On his left are:--(1) Anutchat withhuman hands and arms; (2) a papyrus standard with plumes andmenats2; (3) the godThoth standing upon a serpent coiled up; (4) the goddess Uatchet, in the form of aserpent, standing upon a papyrus sceptre. Now Horus typifies youth and strength and therising sun, and the head above him. is probably intended to represent that of Râ (or Bes)as an old man; the allusion here is clearly to the god who \"is old at eventide and whobecomes young again.\" Theutchats and the figures of the gods symbolize the solarpowers and the deitiesp. 149"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Clippus of Horus.

Golénischeff, plate 1.)p. 151who are masters of the words of power, both in the South and in the North, by which theyoung god Horus vanquishes all hostile animals, reptiles, and creeping things which livein water and on land. Above and about this scene are several rows of figures of gods andsketches of mythological scenes; many of which are evidently taken from the vignettes ofthe Book of the Dead, and the object of all of the latter is to prove that light overcomesdarkness, that good vanquishes evil, and that renewed life comes after death. The textswhich fill all the spaces not occupied by figures describe certain incidents of the eternalcombat which Horus wages against his brother Set, and tell the story of the wanderings ofIsis with her son Horus and of her sufferings in the country of the papyrus Swamps, asketch of which we have given above (see pp.130-136); besides these, prayers to certaingods are introduced. The whole monument is nothing but a talisman, or a gigantic amuletengraved with magical figures and words of power, and it was, undoubtedly, placed in"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"some conspicuous place in a courtyard or in a house to protect the building and itsinmates from the attacks of hostile beings, visible and invisible, and its power wasbelieved to be invincible. There is not a god of any importance whose figure is not on it,and there is not a demon, or evil animal or reptile, who is not depicted upon it in avanquished state; the knowledge of the ancient Egyptian mythologyp. 152and the skill shewn by the designer of this talisman are very remarkable. The small cippiof Horus contain nothing but extracts from the scenes and texts which we find on the\"Metternichstele,\" and it, or similar objects, undoubtedly formed the source from whichso many of the figures of the strange gods which are found on Gnostic gems werederived. Certain of the figures of the gods on the cippi were cast in bronze in thePtolemaic and Roman periods, or hewn in stone, and were buried in tombs and under thefoundations of houses to drive away any of the fiends who might come to do harm eitherto the living or the dead.The Arab historian Mas'ûdî has preserved1 a curious legend of the talismans which wereemployed by Alexander the Great to protect the city of Alexandria whilst it was beingbuilt, and as the legend is of Egyptian origin, and dates from a period not greatly removedfrom that in which the Metternich stele was made, it is worthy of mention. When thefoundations of the city had been laid, and the walls had begun to rise up, certain savageanimals came up each night from the sea, and threw down everything which had beenbuilt during the day; watchmen were appointed to drive them away, but in spite of thiseach morning saw the work done during the previous day destroyed. After much thoughtAlexander devised a plan whereby hep. 153"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Clippus of Horus. (See Metternichstele, ed. Golénischeff, plate 3.)p. 155might thwart the sea monsters, and he proceeded to carry it into effect. He made a box tencubits long and five cubits wide with sides made of sheets of glass fastened into framesby means of pitch, resin, etc. In this box Alexander placed himself, together with twoskilful draughtsmen, and having been closed it was towed out to sea by two vessels; andwhen weights of iron, lead, and stone had been attached to the under part of it, it began tosink, being guided to the place which Alexander wished it to reach by means of cordswhich were worked from the ships. When the box touched the bottom of the sea, thanksto the clearness of the glass sides and the water of the sea, Alexander and his twocompanions were able to watch the various marine monsters which passed by, and he sawthat although they had human bodies they had the heads of beasts; some had axes, somehad saws, and some had hammers, and they all closely resembled workmen. As theypassed in front of the box Alexander and his two draughtsmen copied their forms uponpaper with great exactness, and depicted their hideous countenances, and stature, and"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"shape; this done, a signal was made, and the box was drawn up to the surface. As soon asAlexander reached the land he ordered his stone and metal workers to makereproductions of the sea monsters according to the drawings which he and his friends hadmade, and when they were finished he caused them to be set up on pedestals along thep. 156sea-shore, and continued his work of building the city. When the night came, the seamonsters appeared as usual, but as soon as they saw that figures of themselves had beenput up on the shore they returned at once to the water and did not shew themselves again.When, however, the city had been built and was inhabited, the sea monsters made theirappearance again, and each morning a considerable number of people were found to bemissing; to prevent this Alexander placed talismans upon the pillars which, according toMas'ûdî, were there in his day. Each pillar was in the shape of an arrow and was eightycubits in height, and rested upon a plinth of brass; the talismans were placed at theirbases, and were in the form of figures or statues of certain beings with suitableinscriptions, and as they were put in position after careful astronomical calculations hadbeen made for the purpose we may assume that they produced the effect desired by theking.Footnotes109:1 See the vignettes to Chapters LIV.-LX. of the Book of the Dead.110:1 See Chapters of Coming Forth by Day, p. 106.110:2 Ibid., p. 289.111:1 See Chapters of Coming Forth by Day, p. 162.111:2 Ibid., p. 212.111:3 I.e., CXXX.120:1 See above, p. 55121:1 See Chapters of Coming Forth by Day, p. 292.122:1 See Chapters of Coming Forth by Day, p. 294.125:1 In a similar way the Arabs attach as much importance to the Fatha, or opening chapter,and to the chapter which declares the Unity of God (CXII.), as to the rest of the Koran.126:1 See Chapter of Coming Forth by Day, p. 70.126:2 Ibid., p. 71127:1 See Chapters of Coming Forth by Day, p. 81."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"127:2 Ibid., p. 81.127:3 Ibid., p. 87.127:4 Ibid., p. 129.127:5 Ibid., p. 150.128:1 See Chapters of Coming forth by Day, p. 340 f.129:1 Chabas, Revue Archéologique, 1857, p. 65 ff.; Ledrain, Monuments Égyptiens, pl. xxii. ff.;and for a recent translation see my First Steps in Egyptian, pp. 179-188.130:1 The story is told on the famous Metternichstele, ed.

It wasbelieved that if a man knew the name of a god or a devil, and addressed him by it, he wasbound to answer him and to do whatever he wished; and the possession of the knowledgeof the name of a man enabled his neighbour to do him good or evil. The name that wasthe object of a curse brought down evil upon its owner, and similarly the name that wasthe object of a blessing or prayer for benefits secured for its master many good things. Tothe Egyptian the name was as much a part of a man's being as his soul, or his double(KA), or his body, and it is quite certain that this view was held by him in the earliesttimes. Thus in the text which is inscribed on the walls inside1 the pyramidp. 158of Pepi L, king of Egypt about B.C. 3200, we read, \"Pepi hath been purified. He hathtaken in his hand themâh staff, he hath provided himself with his throne, and he hathtaken his seat in the boat of the great and little companies of the gods. Ed maketh Pepi tosail to the West, he stablisheth his seat above those of the lords of doubles, and he writethdown Pepi at the head of those who live. The doors of Pekh-ka which are in the abyssopen themselves to Pepi, the doors of the iron which is the ceiling of the sky openthemselves to Pepi, and he passeth through them; he hath his panther skin upon him, andthe staff and whip are in his hand. Pepi goeth forward with his flesh, Pepi is happy withhis name, and he liveth with hiska (double).\" Curiously enough only the body and nameand double of the king are mentioned, just as if these three constituted his wholeeconomy; and it is noteworthy what importance is attached to the name in this passage. Inthe text from the pyramid of another king1 we have a prayer concerning the preservationof the name, which is of such interest that a rendering of it in full is here given: it reads,\"O Great Company of the gods who dwell in Annu (Heliopolis), grant that Pepi Nefer-ka-Râ may flourish (literally 'germinate'), and that his pyramid, his ever lasting building,may flourish, even as the name ofp. 159Temu, the chief of the nine gods, doth flourish. If the name of Shu, the lord of the uppershrine in Annu, flourisheth, then Pepi shall flourish, and his pyramid, his everlastingbuilding, shall flourish! If the name of Tefnut, the lady of the lower shrine in Annu,flourisheth, the name of Pepi shall be established, and this his pyramid shall beestablished to all eternity! If the name of Seb flourisheth at the 'homage of the earth,' thenthe name of Pepi shall flourish, and this his pyramid shall flourish, and this his buildingshall flourish unto all eternity! If the name of Nut in the House of Shenth in Annu"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"flourisheth, the name of Pepi shall flourish, and this his pyramid shall flourish, and thishis building shall flourish unto all eternity! If the name of Osiris flourisheth in the nomeof Abydos, then the name of Pepi shall flourish, and this his pyramid shall flourish, andthis his building shall flourish unto all eternity! If the name of Osiris Khent-Amentetflourisheth, then the name of Pepi shall flourish, and this his pyramid shall flourish, andthis his building shall flourish unto all eternity! If the name of Set, the dweller in Nubt(Ombos) flourisheth, then the name of Pepi shall flourish, and this his pyramid shallflourish, and this his building shall flourish unto all eternity! If the name of Horusflourisheth, then the name of Pepi shall flourish, and this his pyramid shall flourish, andthis his building shall flourish unto allp. 160eternity! If the name of Râ flourisheth in the horizon, then the name of Pepi shall flourish,and this his pyramid shall flourish, and this his building shall flourish unto all eternity! Ifthe name of Khent-merti flourisheth in Sekhem (Letopolis), then the name of Pepi shallflourish, and this his pyramid shall flourish, and this his building shall flourish unto alleternity! If the name of Uatchet in Tep flourisheth, then the name of Pepi shall flourish,and this his pyramid shall flourish, and this his building shall flourish unto all eternity!\"The above prayer or formula was the origin of most of the prayers and texts which hadfor their object the \"making the name to germinate or flourish,\" and which were copied sofrequently in the Saïte, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods. All these compositions show thatfrom the earliest to the latest times the belief as to the importance of the preservation ofthe name never changed in Egypt, and the son who assisted in keeping green his father'sname, and in consequence his memory, performed a most meritorious duty. But in thepresent chapter we are not so much concerned with the ordinary as with the extraordinaryuses to which a name might be put, and the above facts have only been mentioned toprove that a man's name was regarded as an essential part of himself, and that the blottingout of the name of an individual was synonymous with his destruction. Without a nameno man could be identified in thep. 161judgment, and as a man only came into being upon this earth when his name had beenpronounced, so the future life could only be attained after the gods of the world beyondthe grave had become acquainted with it and had uttered it.According to the story of the Creation which is related in the Papyrus of Nesi-Amsu,1before the world and all that therein is came into being, only the great god Neb-er-tcherexisted, for even the gods were not born. Now when the time had come for the god tocreate all things be says, \"I brought (i.e., fashioned) my mouth, and I uttered my ownname as a word of power, and thus I evolved myself under the evolutions of the godKhepera, and I developed myself out of the primeval matter which had evolvedmultitudes of evolutions from the beginning of time. Nothing existed on this earth [beforeme], I made all things. There was none other who worked with me at that time.Elsewhere, that is to say, in the other version of the story, the god Khepera says, Ideveloped ct myself from the primeval matter which I made, I developed myself out of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"the primeval matter. My name is' Osiris,' the germ of primeval matter.\" Here, then, wehave a proof that the Egyptians regarded the creation as the result of the utterance of thename of the god Neb-er-tcher or Khepera by himself. Again, in the story of Râ and Isis,given in the precedingp. 162chapter, we have seen that although Isis was able to make a serpent and to cause it to biteRâ, and to make him very ill, she was powerless to do as she wished in heaven and uponearth until she had persuaded the god to reveal to her his name by which he ruled theuniverse. In yielding up his name to the goddess he placed himself in her power, and inthis example we have a striking instance of the belief that the knowledge of the name ofgod, or devil, or human being, implied dominion over that being. We have seenelsewhere that Râ, the type and symbol of God, is described as the god of \"many names,\"and in that wonderful composition the XVIIth Chapter of the Book of the Dead,1 wehave the following statement:--\"I am the great god Nu, who gave birth unto himself, andwho made his name to become the company of the gods.\" Then the question, \"What doesthis mean?\" or \"Who is this?\" is asked. And this is the answer: \"It is Râ, the creator of thename[s] of his limbs, which came into being in the form of the gods who are in thefollowing of Râ.\" From this we see that all the \"gods\" of Egypt were merelypersonifications of the NAMES Of Râ, and that each god was one of his members, andthat a name of a god was the god himself. Without the knowledge of the names of thegods and devils of the underworld the dead Egyptian would have fared badly, for hispersonal liberty would have beenp. 163fettered, the roads and paths would have been blocked to him, the gates of the mansionsof the underworld would have been irrevocably shut in his face, and the hostile powerswhich dogged his footsteps would have made an end of him; these facts are bestillustrated by the following examples:--When the deceased comes to the Hall of Judgment, at the very beginning of his speech hesays, \"Homage to thee, O Great God, thou Lord of Maâti, I have come to thee, O myLord, and I have brought myself hither that 1 may behold thy beauties. I know thee, and Iknow thy name, and I know the names of the two and forty gods who exist with thee inthis Hall of Maâti.\"1 But although the gods may be favourable to him, and he be foundrighteous in the judgment, he cannot make his way among the other gods of theunderworld without a knowledge of the names of certain parts of the Hall of Maâti. Afterthe judgment he acquires the mystical name of \"He who is equipped with the flowers andthe dweller in his olive tree,\" and it is only after he has uttered this name that the gods say\"Pass onwards.\" Next the gods invite him to enter the Hall of Maâti, but he is not allowedto pass in until he has, in answer to questions asked by the bolts, lintels, threshold,fastenings, socket, door-leaves, and door-posts, told their names. The floor of the Hallwill not permit him to walk upon it unless hep. 164"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"tells not only its name, but also the mystical names of his two legs and feet wherewith heis about to tread upon it. When all this has been done the guardian of the Hall says tohim, \"I will not announce thy name [to the god] unless thou tellest me my name\"; and thedeceased replies, \"'Discerner of hearts and searcher of the reins' is thy name.\" In reply tothis the guardian says, \"If I announce thy name thou must utter the name of the god whodwelleth in his hour,\" and the deceased utters the name \"Mâau-Taui.\" But still theguardian is not satisfied, and he says, \"If I announce thy name thou must tell me who ishe whose heaven is of fire, whose walls [are surmounted by] living uraei, and the floor ofwhose house is a stream of water. Who is he, I say? (i.e., what is his name?)\" But thedeceased has, of course, learnt the name of the Great God, and he replies, \"Osiris.\" Theguardian of the Hall is now content, and he says, \"Advance, verily thy name shall bementioned to him\"; and he further promises that the cakes, and ale, and sepulchral mealswhich the deceased shall enjoy shall come from the \"Eye of Râ,\"In another Chapter1 the deceased addresses seven gods, and says, \"Hail, ye seven beingswho make decrees, who support the Balance on the night of the judgment of the Utchat,who cut off heads, who hack necks in pieces, who take possession of hearts byp. 165violence and rend the places where hearts are fixed, who make slaughterings in the Lakeof Fire, I know you, and I know your names; therefore know ye me, even as I know yournames.\" The deceased, having declared that the seven gods know his name and he theirnames, has no further apprehension that evil will befall him.In one portion of the kingdom of Osiris there existed seven halls or mansions throughwhich the deceased was anxious to pass, but each of the gates was guarded by adoorkeeper, a watcher, and a herald, and it required special provision on the part of thedeceased to satisfy these beings that he had a right to pass them. In the first place, figuresof the seven gates had to be made in some substance (or painted upon papyrus), as well asa figure of the deceased: the latter was made to approach each of the gates and to standbefore it and to recite an address which had been specially prepared for the purpose.Meanwhile the thigh, the head, the heart, and the hoof of a red bull were offered at eachgate, as well as a very large number of miscellaneous offerings which need not bedescribed in detail. But all these ceremonies would not help the deceased to pass throughthe gates, unless be knew the names of the seven doorkeepers, and the seven watchers,and the seven heralds who guarded them. The gods of the first gate were:--Sekhet-hra-âsht-aru, Semetu, and Hukheru; those of the second, Tun-hât, Seqet-hra, andp. 166Sabes; of the third, Am-huat-ent-pehfi, Res-hra, and Uâau; of the fourth, Khesef-hra-âsht-kheru, Res-ab, and Neteka-hra-khesef-atu; of the fifth, Ânkh-em-fentu, Ashebu, andTebherkehaat; of the sixth, Akentauk-ha-kheru, An-hra, and Metes-hra-ari-she; of theseventh, Metes-sen, Ââa-kheru, and Khesef-hra-khemiu. And the text, which thedeceased recites to the Halls collectively, begins, \"Hail, ye Halls! Hail, ye who made theHalls for Osiris! Hail, ye who watch your Halls! Hail, ye who herald the affairs of the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"two lands for the god Osiris each day, the deceased knoweth you, and he knoweth yournames.\"1 The names having been uttered, and the addresses duly recited, the deceasedwent wherever he pleased in the seven Halls of Osiris.But beside the seven halls the deceased had to pass through the twenty-one hidden pylonsof the house of Osiris in the Elysian Fields, and in order to do so he had to declare thenames of the pylon and the doorkeeper of each, and to make a short address besides. Thusto the first pylon he says, \"I have made my way, I know thee and I know thy name, and Iknow the name of the god who guardeth thee. Thy name is 'Lady of tremblings, withlofty walls, the sovereign lady, the mistress of destruction, who setteth in order the wordswhich drive back the whirlwind and the storm, who delivereth from destruction him thatp. 167travelleth along the way'; and the name of thy doorkeeper is Neri.\" At the second pylonhe says, \"I have made [my] way, I know thee, and I know thy name, and I know the nameof the god who guardeth thee. Thy name is 'Lady of heaven, the mistress of the world,who devoureth with fire, the lady of mortals, who knoweth mankind.' The name of thydoorkeeper is Mes-Ptah,\" and so on at each of the pylons. In the later and longer versionof the chapter which was written to supply the deceased with this knowledge he informsthe god of each pylon what purification he has undergone; thus to the god of the firstpylon he says, \"I have anointed myself withhâti \"unguent [made from] the cedar, I havearrayed myself in apparel ofmenkh (linen), and I have with me my sceptre made ofhetiwood.\" After the speech the god of the pylon says, \"Pass on, then, thou art pure.\"When we remember that one of the oldest beliefs as to the future life made it appear thatit would be lived by man in the Sekhet-Aaru, or Field of Reeds, a region which, as weknow from the drawings of it which have come down to us, was intersected by canals andstreams, it is at once clear that in order to pass from one part of it to another the deceasedwould need a boat. Even assuming that he was fortunate enough to have made his ownway into this region, it was not possible for him to take a boat with him. To meet, thisdifficulty a boat and all its various parts werep. 168drawn upon the papyrus, upon which the selection of Chapters from the Book of the Deadhad been inscribed for him, and a knowledge of the text of the chapter which belonged toit made the drawing to become an actual boat. But before he could enter it, the post towhich it was tied up, and every part of the boat itself, demanded that he should tell themtheir names, thus:--Post at which to tie up. \"Tell me my name.\" D.1 \"Lord of the two lands, dweller in theshrine,\" is thy name.Rudder. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Leg of Hâpiu\" is thy name."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Rope. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Hairs with which Anpu finisheth the work of myembalmment\" is thy name.Oar-ruts. \"Tell us our name.\" D. \"Pillars of the underworld\" is your name.Hold. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Akau\" is thy name.Mast. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Bringer back of the lady after her departure\" is thy name.Lower deck. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Standard of Ap-uat\" is thy name.Upper Post. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Throat of Mestha\" is thy name.Sail. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Nut\" is thy name.Leather Straps. \"Tell us our name.\" D. \"Those whop. 169are made from the hide of the Mnevis Bull, which was burned by Suti,\" is your name.Paddles. \"Tell us our name.\" D. \"Fingers of Horus the firstborn\" is your name.Pump (?). \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"The hand of Isis which wipeth away the blood of theEye of Horus,\" is thy name.Planks. \"Tell us our names.\" D. \"Mestha, Hâpi, Tuamutef, Qebhsennuf, Haqau, Thet-em-âua, Maa-an-tef, Ari-nef-tchesef,\" are your names.Rows. \"Tell us our name.\" D. \"He who is at the head of his nomes\" is your name.Hull. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Mert\" is thy name.Rudder. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Âqa\" is thy name; Shiner in the water, hidden beam,\" isthy name.Keel. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Thigh of Isis, which Râ cut off with the knife to bringblood into the Sektet boat,\" is thy name.Sailor. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"Traveller\" is thy name.Wind. \"Tell me my name.\" D. \"The North Wind, which cometh from Tem to the nostrilsof Osiris,\" is thy name.And when the deceased had declared to these their names, before he could set out on hisjourney he was obliged to tell the river, and the river-banks, and the ground their mysticalnames. This done, the boat"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"p. 170admitted him as a passenger, and he was able to sail about to any part of the ElysianFields at will.But among the beings whom the deceased wished to avoid in the underworld were thebeings who \"lay snares, and who work the nets, and who are fishers,\" and who woulddraw him into their nets. It seems as if it were absolutely necessary that he should fall inwith these beings and their nets, for a whole chapter of the Book of the Dead was writtenwith the view of enabling him to escape from them unharmed; the god their leader iscalled \"the god whose face is behind him,\" and \"the god who hath gained the masteryover his heart.\" To escape from the net which was worked by \"the fishers who lay snareswith their nets and who go round about in the chambers of the waters,\" the deceased hadto know the names of the net, and of the ropes, and of the pole, and of the hooks, and ofeach and every part of it; without this knowledge nothing could save him from calamity.We unfortunately understand very few of the allusions to mythological events which arecontained in the names of the various parts of the machinery which work the net, but it isquite certain that they have reference to certain events in the lives of the gods who arementioned, and that these were well known to the writers and readers of religious texts.From the above descriptions of the means whereby the deceased made his way throughthe gates and thep. 171halls of the underworld and escaped from the fowler and his net, it will be readilyunderstood that the knowledge of the name alone was, in some cases, sufficient to helphim out of his difficulties; but in others it was necessary to have the name which waspossessed of magical power inscribed upon some object, amulet or otherwise. Moreover,some gods and devils were thought to have the power to assume different forms, and aseach form carried with it its own name, to have absolute power over a god of many formsit was necessary to know all his names. Thus in the \"Book of Overthrowing Âpep\"1 weare told not only to make a wax figure of the monster, but also to write his name upon it,so that when the figure is destroyed by being burnt in the fire his name also may bedestroyed; this is a striking example of the belief that the name was an integral part of theeconomy of a living creature. But Âpep possessed many forms and therefore manynames, and unless he could be invoked by these names he still had the power to do evil;the above-mentioned book2 therefore supplies us with a list of his names, among whichoccur the following:--\"Tutu (i.e., Doubly evil one), Hau-hra (i.e., \"Backward Face),Hemhemti (i.e., Roarer), Qetu (i.e., Evil-doer), Âmam (i.e., Devourer), Saatet-ta (i.e.,Darkener of earth), Iubani, Khermuti, Unti, Karauememti,p. 172Khesef-hra, Sekhem-hra, Khak-ab, Nâi, Uai, Beteshu, Kharebutu the fourfold fiend,\" etc.All these names represent, as may be seen from the few of which translations are given,various aspects of Âpep, the devil of thunder, lightning, cloud, rain, mist, storm, and the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"like, and the anxiety to personify these so that the personifications might be attacked bymeans of magical ceremonies and words of power seems positively childish.Passing now to certain chapters of the Book of the Dead which are rich in names ofmagical power,1 we notice that the god Amen, whose name meant the \"hidden one,\"possessed numerous names, upon the knowledge of which the deceased relied forprotection. Thus he says, \"O Amen,2 Amen; O Re-Iukasa; O God, Prince of the gods ofthe east, thy name is Na-ari-k, or (as others say) Ka-ari-ka, Kasaika is thy name.Arethikasathika is thy name. Amen-na-an-ka-entek-share, or (as others say) Thek-share-Amen-kerethi, is thy name. O Amen, let me make supplication unto thee, for I, even I,know thy name. Amen is thy name. Ireqai is thy name. Marqathai is thy name. Rerei isthy name. Nasaqbubu is thy name. Thanasa-Thanasa is thy name. Shareshatha-katha isthy name. O Amen, O Amen, O God, O God, O Amen, I adore thy name.\" In anotherplace3 the deceased addresses Sekhet-Bast-Râ, saying,p. 173\"Thou art the fire-goddess Ami-seshet, whose opportunity escapeth her not; thy name isKaharesapusaremkakaremet, Thou art like unto the mighty flame of Saqenaqat which isin the bow of the boat of thy father Harepukakashareshabaiu, for behold, thus is [thename uttered] in the speech of the Negroes, and of the Anti, and of the people of Nubia.Sefiperemhesihrahaputchetef is thy name; Atareamtcherqemturennuparsheta is the nameof one of thy divine sons, and Panemma that of the other.\" And in yet another chapter1the deceased addressing the god Par says, \"Thou art the mighty one of names among thegods, the mighty runner whose strides are might thou art the god the mighty one whocomest and rescuest the needy one and the afflicted from him that oppresseth him; giveheed to my cry. I am the Cow, and thy divine name is in my mouth, and I will utter it;Haqabakaher is thy name; Âurauaaqersaanqrebathi is thy name; Kherserau is thy name;Kharsatha is thy name. I praise thy name . . . . O be gracious unto the deceased, and causethou heat to exist under his head, for, indeed, he is the soul of the great divine Bodywhich resteth in Annu (Heliopolis), whose names are Khukheperuru andBarekathatchara.\"The examples of the use of names possessing magical powers described above illustratethe semi-religiousp. 174views on the subject of names which the Egyptians held, and we have now to considerbriefly the manner in which the knowledge of a name was employed in uses lessimportant than those which had for their object the attainment of life and happiness in theworld to come. In the famous magical papyrus1 which Chabas published2 we find aseries of interesting charms and magical formulæ which were written to preserve itspossessor from the attacks of sea and river monsters of every kind, of which thefollowing is an example. \"Hail, lord of the gods! Drive away from me the lions of thecountry of Meru (Meroë?), and the crocodiles which come forth from the river, and thebite of all poisonous reptiles which crawl forth from their holes. Get thee back, O"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"crocodile Mâk, thou son of Set! Move not by means of thy tail! Work not thy legs andfeet! Open not thy mouth! Let the water which is before thee turn into a consuming fire,O thou whom the thirty-seven gods did make, and whom the serpent of Râ did put inchains, O thou who wast fettered with links of iron before the boat of Râ! Get thee back,O crocodile Mâk, thou son of Set!\" These words were to be said over a figure of the godAmen painted on clay; the rod was to have four rams' heads upon one neck, under his feetwas to be a figure of the crocodile Mâk, andp. 175to the right and left of him were to be the dog headed apes,i.e., the transformed spirits ofthe dawn, who sang hymns of praise to Râ when he rose daily.1 Again, let us supposethat some water monster wished to attack a man in a boat. To avoid this the man stoodbefore the cabin of the boat and, taking a hard egg in his hand, he said, \"O egg of thewater which hath been spread over the earth, essence of the divine apes, the great one inthe heaven above and in the earth beneath, who dost dwell in the nests which are in thewaters, I have come forth with thee from the water, I have been with thee in thy nest, Iam Amsu of Coptos, I am Amsu, lord of Kebu.\" When he had said these words he wouldappear to the animal in the water in the form of the god Amsu, with whom he hadidentified himself, and it would be afraid and flee. At the end of the papyrus in which theabove extracts occur we find a series of magical names which may be read thus:--Atir-Atisa, Atirkaha-Atisa, Samumatnatmu-Atisa, Samuanemui-Atisa, Samutekaari-Atisa,Samutekabaiu-Atisa, Samutchakaretcha-Atisa, Tâuuarehasa, Qina, Hama, Senentuta-Batetsataiu, Anrehakatha-sataiu, Haubailra-Haari. From these and similar magical namesit is quite certain that the Gnostics and other sects which held views akin to theirsobtained the names which they were so fond ofp. 176inscribing upon their amulets and upon the so-called magical papyri. The last class ofdocuments undoubtedly contains a very large proportion of the magical ideas, beliefs,formulæ, etc., which were current in Egypt from the time of the Ptolemies to the end ofthe Roman Period, but from about B.C. 150 to A.D. 200 the papyri exhibit traces of theinfluence of Greek, Hebrew, and Syrian philosophers and magicians, and from a passagelike the following1 we may get a proof of this:--\"I call thee, the headless one, that didstcreate earth and heaven, that didst create night and day, thee the creator of light anddarkness. Thou art Osoronnophris, whom no man hath seen at any time; thou art Iabas,thou art Iapôs, thou hast distinguished the just and the unjust, thou didst make female andmale, thou didst produce seeds and fruits, thou didst make men to love one another and tobate one another. I am Moses thy prophet, to whom thou didst commit thy mysteries, theceremonies of Israel; thou didst produce the moist and the dry and all manner of food.Listen to me: I am an angel of Phapro Osoronnophris; this is thy true name, handed downto the prophets of Israel. Listen to me.2 . . .\" In this passage the name Osoronnophris isclearly a corruption of the old Egyptian names of thep. 177"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"great god of the dead \"Ausar Unnefer,\" and Phapro seems to represent the EgyptianPer-âa (literally, \"great house\") or \"Pharaoh,\" with the articlepa \"the\" prefixed. It isinteresting to note that Moses is mentioned, a fact which seems to indicate Jewishinfluence.In another magical formula we read,1 \"I call upon thee that didst create the earth andbones, and all flesh and all spirit, that didst establish the sea and that shakest the heavens,that didst divide the light from the darkness, the great regulative mind, that disposesteverything, eye of the world, spirit of spirits, god of gods, the lord of spirits, theimmoveable Aeon, IAOOUÊI, hear my voice.

Mus., Greek Papyrus, Nu. CXXIV.--4th or 5th century.)But of all the names found upon Gnostic gems two,i.e., Khnoubis (or Khnoumis), andAbrasax (or Abraxas), are of the most frequent occurrence. The first is usuallyrepresented as a huge serpent having the head of a lion surrounded by seven or twelverays. Over the seven rays, one on the point of each, are the seven vowels of the Greekalphabet, which some suppose top. 180refer to the seven heavens; and on the back of the amulet, on which the figure ofKhnoumis occurs, is usually found the sign of the triple S and bar. Khnoumis is, ofcourse, a form of the ancient Egyptian god Khnemu, or \"Fashioner\" of man and beast, thegod to whom many of the attributes of the Creator of the universe were ascribed. Khnemuis, however, often depicted with the head of a ram, and in the later times, as the \"beautifulram of Râ,\" he has four heads; in the Egyptian monuments he has at times the head of ahawk, but never that of a lion. The god Abrasax is represented in a form which has ahuman body, the bead of a hawk or cock, and legs terminating in serpents; in one hand heholds a knife or dagger, and in the other a shield upon which is inscribed the great nameΙΑΩ {GreekIAW}, or JÂH. Considerable difference of opinion exists as to the meaningand derivation of the name Abrasax, but there is no doubt that the god who bore it was aform of the Sun-god, and that he was intended to represent some aspect of the Creator ofthe world. The name was believed to possess magical powers of the highest class, andBasileides,1 who gave it currency in the second century, seems to have regarded it as aninvincible name. It is probable, however, that its exact meaning was lost at an early date,and that itp. 181soon degenerated into a mere magical symbol, for it is often found inscribed on amuletsside by side with scenes and figures with which, seemingly, it cannot have any connexionwhatever. Judging from certain Gnostic gems in the British Museum, Abrasax is to beidentified with the polytheistic figure that stands in the upper part of the Metternich steledepicted on p. 153. This figure has two bodies, one being that of a man, and the other thatof a bird; from these extend four wings, and from each of his knees projects a serpent. Hehas two pairs of hands and arms; one pair is extended along the wings, each hand holdingthe symbols of \"life,\" \"stability,\" and \"power,\" and two knives and two serpents; the otherpair is pendent, the right hand grasping the sign of life, and the other a sceptre. His face isgrotesque, and probably represents that of Bes, or the sun as an old man; on his head is apylon-shaped object with figures of various animals, and above it a pair of horns whichsupport eight knives and the figure of a god with raised hands and arms, which typifies\"millions of years.\" The god stands upon an oval wherein are depicted figures of various\"typhonic\" animals, and from each side of his crown proceed several symbols of fire.Whether in the Gnostic system Abraxas absorbed all the names and attributes of this godof many forms cannot be said with certainty."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Footnotes157:1 Line 169.158:1 Pepi II.

No Egyptian who believed hisScriptures ever expected that his corruptible body would ascend into heaven and live withthe gods, for they declare in no uncertain manner that it remains upon the earth whilst thesoul dwells in heaven. But that the preservation of thep. 183body was in some way or for some reason absolutely necessary is certain, for the art ofmummification flourished for several thousands of years, and unless there was somegood reason, besides the observance of conservative custom and traditional use, why itshould do so, king and priest, gentle and simple, and rich and poor, would never haveburdened their relatives and heirs with the expense of costly funeral ceremonies, and withthe performance of rites which were of no avail. At first sight, too, it seems strange tofind the Egyptians studying carefully how best to provide the dead with a regular supplyof sepulchral offerings, for when we come to think about it we notice that in arranging forthe well-being of the dead nothing whatever was left to chance. For example, a papyruswill contain several prayers and pictures with appropriate formulæ, the object of each ofwhich is to give the deceased meat and drink; any one of these would have been enoughfor the purpose, but it was thought best in such an important matter to make assurance"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"doubly sure, and if there was the least doubt about the efficacy of one Chapter one ormore of the same class were added. Similarly, the tendency of the natural body afterdeath being to decay, the greatest care was taken in mummifying its various members,lest perchance any one of them should be neglected accidentally, and should, either bythe omission of the words of power that ought to have been said over it, or through thelaxp. 184performance of some ceremony, decay and perish. The Egyptian declared that he wasimmortal, and believed that he would enjoy eternal life in a spiritual body; yet heattempted by the performance of magical ceremonies and the recital of words of power tomake his corruptible body to endure for ever. He believed that he would feed upon thecelestial and imperishable food whereon the gods lived, but at the same time he spared noeffort or expense to provide for his tomb being supplied at stated intervals throughout theyear with perishable food in the shape of offerings of oxen, feathered fowl, cakes, bread,and the like. He mummified his dead and swathed them in linen bandages, and then bythe performance of magical ceremonies and by the recital of words of power sought togive back to their members the strength to eat, and drink, and talk, and think, and move atwill. Indeed, all the evidence now forthcoming seems to prove that be never succeeded inbringing himself to think that the gods could do without his help, or that the pictures orrepresentations of the scenes which took place in the life, and death, and burial, andresurrection of Osiris, upon which he relied so implicitly, could possibly fail to be asefficacious as the actual power of the god himself.The examination of mummies has shown us with tolerable clearness what methods wereadopted in preparing bodies for bandaging and final ornamentation,p. 185and the means adopted for disposing of the more corruptible portions of the body are wellknown from classical and other writers. But for an account of the manner in which thebody was bandaged, and a list of the unguents and other materials employed in theprocess, and the words of power which were spoken as each bandage was laid in itsplace, we must have, recourse to a very interesting papyrus which has been edited andtranslated by M. Maspero under the title ofLe Rituel de l'Embaumement.1 The first partof the papyrus, which probably gave instructions for the evisceration of the body, iswanting, and only the section which refers to the bandaging is at all perfect. The textopens with an address to the deceased in which it is said, \"The perfume of Arabia hathbeen brought to thee to make perfect thy smell through the scent of the god. Here arebrought to thee liquids which have come forth from Râ, to make perfect . . . thy smell inthe Hall [of Judgment]. O sweet-smelling soul of the great god, thou dost contain such asweet odour that thy face shall neither change nor perish. . . . Thy members shall becomeyoung in Arabia, and thy soul shall appear over thy body in Ta-neter (i.e., the 'divineland').\" After this the priest or mummifier was to take a vase of liquid which containedten perfumes, and to smear therewith the body from head to foot twice, taking especialcare"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"p. 186to anoint the head thoroughly. He was then to say, Osiris (i.e., the deceased), thou hastreceived the perfume which shall make thy members perfect. Thou receivest the source[of life] and thou takest the form of the great Disk (i.e., Aten), which uniteth itself untothee to give enduring form to thy members; thou shalt unite with Osiris in the great Hall.The unguent cometh unto thee to fashion thy members and to gladden thy heart, and thoushalt appear in the form of Râ; it shall make thee to be sound when thou settest in the skyat eventide, and it shall spread abroad the smell of thee in the nomes of Aqert. . . .

Thou receivest the oil of thecountry of Manu which hath come from the East, and Râ riseth upon thee at the gates ofthe horizon, at the holy doors of Neith. Thou goest therein, thy soul is in the upperheaven, and thy body is in the lower heaven . . . O Osiris, may the Eye of Horus causethat which floweth forth from it to come to thee, and to thy heart for ever!\" These wordshaving been said, the whole ceremony was repeated, and then the internal organs whichhad been removed from the bodyp. 187were placed in the \"liquid of the children of Horus,\" so that the liquid of this god mightenter into them, and whilst they were being thus treated a chapter was read over them andthey were put in the funeral chest. When this was done the internal organs were placed onthe body, and the body having been made to lie straight the backbone was immersed inholy oil, and the face of the deceased was turned towards the sky; the bandage of Sebekand Sedi was then laid upon the backbone. In a long speech the deceased is addressed andtold that the liquid is \"secret,\" and that it is an emanation of the gods Shu and Seb, andthat the resin of Phoenicia and the bitumen of Byblos will make his burial perfect in theunderworld, and give him his legs, and facilitate his movements, and sanctify his steps inthe Hall of Seb. Next gold, silver, lapis-lazuli, and turquoise are brought to the deceased,and crystal to lighten his face, and carnelian to strengthen his steps; these form amuletswhich will secure for him a free passage in the underworld. Meanwhile the backbone iskept in oil, and the face of the deceased is turned towards the heavens; and next thegilding of the nails of the fingers and toes begins. When this has been done, and portionsof the fingers have been wrapped in linen made at Saïs, the following address is made tothe deceased:--\"O Osiris, thou receivest thy nails of gold, thy fingers of gold, and thythumb ofsmu (oruasm) metal; the liquid of Râ entereth into thee as wellp. 188as into the divine members of Osiris, and thou journeyest on thy legs to the immortalabode. Thou hast carried thy hands to the house of eternity, thou art made perfect in gold,thou dost shine brightly insmu metal, and thy fingers shine in the dwelling of Osiris, inthe sanctuary of Horus himself. O Osiris, the gold of the mountains cometh to thee; it is aholy talisman of the gods in their abodes, and it lighteneth thy face in the lower heaven.Thou breathest in gold, thou appearest insmu metal, and the dwellers in Re-stau receive"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"thee; those who are in the funeral chest rejoice because thou hast transformed thyself intoa hawk of gold by means of thy amulets (or talismans) of the City of Gold,\" etc. Whenthese words have been said, a priest who is made to personify Anubis comes to thedeceased and performs certain symbolical ceremonies by his head, and lays certainbandages upon it. When the head and mouth and face have been well oiled the bandageof Nekheb is laid on the forehead, the bandage of Hathor on the face, the bandage ofThoth upon the two ears, and the bandage of Nebt-hetep on the nape of the neck. Overthe head was laid the bandage of Sekhet, in two pieces, and over each ear, and eachnostril, and each cheek was fastened a bandage or strip of linen; over the forehead wentfour pieces of linen, on the top of the head two, outside the mouth two, and inside two,over the chin two, and over the nape of the neck four large pieces; there werep. 189to be twenty-two pieces to the right and to the left of the face passing over the two ears.The Lady of the West is then addressed in these words:--\"Grant thou that breathing maytake place in the head of the deceased in the underworld, and that be may see with hiseyes, and that he may hear with his two ears; and that he may breathe through his nose;and that he may be able to utter sounds with his mouth; and that he may be able to speakwith his tongue in the underworld. Receive thou his voice in the Hall of Maâti and hisspeech in the Hall of Seb in the presence of the Great God, the lord of Amentet.\" Theaddresses which follow these words have, reference to the delights and pleasures of thefuture life which shall be secured for him through the oil and unguents, which are dulyspecified and described, and through the magical figures which are drawn upon thebandages. The protecting properties of the turquoise and other precious stones are alludedto, and after a further anointing with oil and the placing of grains of myrrh and resin, thedeceased is declared to have \"received his head,\" and he is promised that it shallnevermore depart from him. On the conclusion of the. ceremonies which concern thehead the deceased has the power to go in among the holy and perfect spirits, his name isexalted among men, the denizens of heaven receive his soul, the beings of the underworldbow down before his body, the dwellers upon earth adore him, and thep. 190inhabitants of the funeral mountain renew for him his youth. Besides these things, Anubisand Horus make perfect his bandages, and the god Thoth protects his members by hiswords of magical power; and he himself has learned the magical formulæ which arenecessary to make his path straight in the underworld, and also the proper way in whichto utter them. All these benefits were secured for him by the use of bandages andunguents which possess both magical names and properties, and by the words of poweruttered by the priests who recited the Ritual of Embalmment, and by the ceremonieswhich the priest who personated Anubis performed beside the body of the deceased inimitation of those which the god Anubis performed for the dead god Osiris in remotedays.Next the left hand of the deceased was mummified and bandaged according to theinstructions given in the Ritual of Embalmment. The hand was stretched out on a piece of"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"linen, and a ring was passed over the fingers; it was then filled with thirty-six of thesubstances which were used in embalming, according to the number of the forms of thegod Osiris. This done, the hand was bandaged with a strip of linen in six folds, uponwhich were drawn figures of Isis and Hâpi. The right hand was treated in a similar way,only the figures drawn upon the bandages were those of Râ and Amsu; and when theappropriate words had beenp. 191recited over both hands divine protection was assured them. After these things theceremonies concerning the right and left arms were performed, and these were followedby rubbing the soles of the feet and the legs and the thighs, first with black-stone oil, andsecondly with holy oil. The toes were wrapped in linen, and a piece of linen was laid oneach leg; on each piece was drawn the figure of a jackal, that on the right leg representingAnubis, and that on the left Horus. When flowers of the ânkham plant and othersubstances had been laid beside and on the legs, and they had been treated with ebony-gum water and holy oil, and appropriate addresses had been said, the ceremony ofbandaging the body was ended. Everything that could be done to preserve the body wasnow done, and every member of it was, by means of the words of power which changedperishable substances into imperishable, protected to all eternity; when the final coveringof purple or white linen had been fastened upon it, the body was ready for the tomb.But the Ritual of Embalmment which has been briefly described above seems to belongto a late period of Egyptian history, and although the ideas and beliefs contained in it areas old as Egyptian civilization itself, it seems as if it was intended to take the place of amuch older and more elaborate work which was in use as far back as the period in whichthe Great Pyramid was built, and which was intended to bep. 192recited during the performance of a complex series of ceremonies, some of which are stillnot completely understood. It seems as if the performance of all the ceremonies wouldrequire several days, and it is clear that only the wealthy could afford the expense whichmust have attended such elaborate obsequies; for the poorer classes of men the variousceremonies must have been greatly curtailed, and at a very early period we find that ashortened form of ritual had taken their place. Of all the ceremonies, the most importantwas that of the \"Opening of the Mouth and Eyes,\" which was performed either on themummy itself or upon a statue which represented it. It has already been stated that theEgyptians believed that they could transmit to a statue the attributes of the person inwhose image it was made, and similarly that that which was done to the statue of themummified person was also done to it. The use of a statue instead of the actual mummyhas obvious advantages, for the ceremony could be performed at any time and in anyplace, and the presence of the mummy was unnecessary. As a matter of fact the ceremonywas performed in a chamber at the entrance to the tomb, or outside the tomb at a placewhich had been made ceremonially pure or consecrated, and those who took part in itwere:--(1) TheKher-heb, or chief officiating priest, who held a roll of papyrus in his"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"hand. (2) TheSem priest. (3) TheSmer, who was, perhaps, some intimate friend of thedeceased.p. 193(4)The Sa-mer-ef,1 or man who was either the son of the deceased or his representative.(5) TheTcherau-ur, or woman who represented Isis. (6) TheTcherau-sheraut, or womanwho represented Nephthys. (7) TheMenhu, or slaughterer. (8) TheAm-asi priest. (9) TheAm-khent priest. (10) A number of people who represented the armed guard of Horus. Allthese became actors in scenes which were intended to represent the events which tookplace in connexion with the burial of Osiris, with whom the deceased is now identified;the two women took the parts of the goddesses Isis and Nephthys, and the men those ofthe gods who helped them in the performance of their pious duties. From the scenes2which accompany the texts3 relating to the ceremony of opening the mouth and eyes wesee that it began with the sprinkling of water round about the statue or mummy from fourvessels, one for each quarter of the earth, and with the recital of addresses to the godsHorus, Set, Thoth, and Sept; this act restored to the deceased the use of his head. Thesprinkling of water was followed by a purification by means of incense, also contained infour vases, one for each of the four quarters of the earth. The burningp. 194of this sweet-smelling substance assisted in opening the mouth of the deceased and instrengthening his heart. At this stage theSem priest dressed himself in the skin of a cow,and lying down upon a kind of couch pretended to be asleep; but he was roused up by theAm-asi priest in the presence of theKher-heb and theAm-khent priest, and when theSempriest had seated himself upon a seat, the four men together represented the four childrenof Horus,1 or the gods with the heads of a hawk, an ape, a jackal, and a man respectively.TheSem priest then said, \"I have seen my father in all his forms,\" which the other men inturn repeat. The meaning of this portion of the ceremony is hard to explain, but M.Maspero2 thinks that it was intended to bring back to the body of the deceased its shadow(khaibit), which had departed from it when it died. The preliminary purifications beingended, and the shadow having been joined to the body once more, the statue or mummyis approached by the men who represent the armed guard of Horus; and one of theirnumber, having taken upon himself the character of Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis,touches its mouth with his finger. TheKher-heb next made ready to perform the sacrificewhich was intended to commemorate the slaughter, at some very early period, of thefiends who were the friends of Set. It seems that,p. 195the soul of Horus dwelt in an eye, and that Set nearly succeeded in devouring it; butHorus vanquished Set and saved his eye. Set's associates then changed themselves intothe forms of animals, and birds, and fish, but they were caught, and their heads were cutoff; Set, however, who was concealed in the form of a pig, contrived to escape. Thesacrifice consisted of a bull (or cow) or two, two gazelles or antelopes, and ducks. Whenthe bull had been slain, one of the forelegs was cut off, and the heart taken out, and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"offered to the statue or mummy; theSem priest then took the bleeding leg and touched, orpretended to touch, the mouth and eyes with it four times. The slaughtered gazelles orantelopes and ducks were simply offered before the statue. TheSem priest next said to thestatue, \"I have come to embrace thee, I am thy son Horus, I have pressed thy mouth; I amthy son, I love thee. . . . Thy mouth was closed, but I have set in order for thee thy mouthand thy teeth.\" He then brought two instruments,called \"Seb-ur\" and\"Tuntet\" respectively, and touched the mouth of the statue or mummy with them, whilstthe Kher-heb said, \"Thy mouth was closed, but I have set in order for thee thy mouth andthy teeth. I open for thee thy mouth, I open for thee thy two eyes. I have opened for theethy mouth with the instrument of Anubis. I have opened thy mouth with the instrument ofAnubis, with the iron implement with which the mouths of thep. 196gods were opened. Horus, open the mouth! Horus, open the mouth! Horus hath openedthe mouth of the dead, as he in times of old opened the mouth of Osiris, with the ironwhich came forth from Set, with the iron instrument with which he opened the mouths ofthe gods. He hath opened thy mouth with it. The deceased shall walk and shall speak, andhis body shall be with the great company of the gods in the Great House of the Aged Onein Annu, and he shall receive there theureret crown from Horus, the lord of mankind.\"Thus the mouth and the eyes of the deceased are opened. TheSem priest then took in hishand the instrument calledur hekau,i.e., the \"mighty one of enchantments,\" a curious,sinuous piece of wood, one end of which is in the form of a ram's head surmounted by auraeus, and touched the mouth and the, eyes of the statue or mummy four times, whilsttheKher-heb recited a long address in which he declared that this portion of theceremony had secured for the deceased all the benefits which accrued to the god Osirisfrom the actions of Nut, Horus, and Set, when he was in a similar state. It has been saidabove that every dead man hoped to be provided with the hekau, or words of power,which were necessary for him in the next world, but without a mouth it was impossiblefor him to utter them. Now that the mouth, or rather the use of it, was restored to thedeceased, it was all important to givep. 197him not only the words of power, but also the ability to utter them correctly and in suchwise that the gods and other beings would hearken to them and obey them; four touchesof theur hekau instrument on the lips endowed the deceased with the faculty of utteringthe proper words in the proper manner in each of the four quarters of the world. Whenthis had been done, several other ceremonies were performed with the object of allowingthe \"son who loveth him\" or his representative to take part in the opening of the mouth ofhis father. In order to do this he took in his hand a metal chisel and touched the openingsof the mouth and of the eyes, and then theSem priest touched them first with his litt lefinger, and afterwards with a little bag filled with pieces of red stone or carnelian, withthe idea, M. Maspero thinks, of restoring to the lips and eyelids the colour which they had"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"lost during the process of mummification. The \"son who loves him\" then took fourobjects called \"iron of the South, and iron of the North,\" and laid each of them four timesupon the mouth and the eyes while the Kher-heb recited the proper address in which themummy or statue is said to have had his mouth and lips established firmly. This done, theSem priest brings an instrument called the \"Pesh-en-kef,\"and touches themouth of the mummy or statue therewith, and says, \"O Osiris, I have stablished for theethe two jaw-bonesp. 198in thy face, and they are now separated\"; that is to say, the bandages with which theyhave been tied up can no longer prevent their movement when the deceased wishes to eat.After the Pesh-en-kef had been used theSem priest brought forward a basket or vessel ofsome kind of food in the shape of balls, and by the order of theKher-heb offered them tothe mouth of the mummy, and when this portion of the ceremony was ended, theSempriest took an ostrich feather, and waved it before its face four times, but with what objectis not clear. Such are the ceremonies which it was thought necessary to perform in orderto restore to the deceased the functions which his body possessed upon earth. But it mustbe remembered that hitherto only the \"bull of the south\" has been sacrificed, and that the\"bull of the north\" has yet to be offered up; and all the ceremonies which have beenalready performed must be repeated if the deceased would have the power to go forth atwill over the whole earth. From the earliest times the South and the North were the twogreat sections into which the world was divided, and each section possessed its ownspecial gods, all of whom had to be propitiated by the deceased; hence most religiousceremonies were ordered to be performed in duplicate. In later days each section wasdivided into two parts, and the four divisions thus made were apportioned to the fourchildren of Horus; hence prayers and formulæp. 199"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The ceremony of \"opening the mouth\" being performed on the mummy of Hunefer, aboutB.C. 1350(From the Papyrus of Hunefer, sheet 5)p. 201were usually said four times, once in honour of each god, and the rubrical directions onthis point are definite.In the limited space of this book it is not possible to reproduce all the scenes of theceremony of opening the mouth and the eyes which are depicted in the tombs andelsewhere, but on page 199 is a general view of the ceremony as it is often given in thepapyri of the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties. On the right we see the pyramidal tomb in theTheban hill with its open door, and by the side of it is the funeral stele with a rounded topinscribed with a figure of the deceased standing in adoration before Osiris, and with aprayer to the god for sepulchral offerings. Anubis, the god of the dead, embraces themummy, thus indicating his readiness to take the deceased under his protection.

Incense hathbeen offered unto thee of the incense of Seb, and incense hath been offered unto Seb ofthy incense.'\" The above words are all the text that the scribe considered it necessary togive in the Papyrus of Hunefer, and that he curtailed the representation of the ceremonyof opening the mouth and eyes as much as possible is evident.The performance of the ceremony of opening the mouth was followed by a number ofother less important ceremonies which had for their object the providing of the mummyor statue with scents, and unguents, and various articles of wearing apparel; these werenot essentials, but sufficient importance was attached to them to make the performance ofthem almost obligatory. Among the objects presented to the deceased in these ceremoniesscents and perfumed unguents play a prominent part, and this is not to be wondered at. Tocertain kinds of oil, magical properties have been attached from time immemorial in theEast, and the important place which they occupied in the ceremonies and rituals of manynations proves that remarkable effects were expected to follow their use. The living madeuse of oil to soften the skin and to preserve it from the parching heat of the sun, and thedead were anointed with it during the process of mummification so that their skins might,through thep. 204magical words which were pronounced whilst it was being rubbed on them, remain softfor all time, and so that the curative properties of the oil might heal the wounds which themummifiers had made. A glance at the medical papyri of Egypt will shew that oil appearsin scores of prescriptions, and it was no less useful to the magician1 than to the physicianin producing good or evil results. It seems to have been used with the idea of effectingtransformations by the former, just as it was employed by the priest in the performance of"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"certain important religious ceremonies, and a curious survival of this use is mentioned byLucian,2 who relates that a woman transformed herself into a night-raven by its means.The woman first undressed herself, and going to a lamp threw two grains of incense intothe flame and recited certain words; she then went to a large chest containing severalbottles, and taking out one which, the writer thinks, contained oil, rubbed all her bodywith the liquid, from head to foot, beginning with the ends of the nails, and suddenlyfeathers and wings began to grow upon her, and a hooked, horny beak took the place ofher nose.

Thereis good reason for thinking that some diseases were attributed to the action of evil spiritsor demons, which had the power of entering into human bodies and of vexing them inproportion to their malignant nature and influence,1 but the texts do not afford muchinformation on the matter. Incidentally, however, we have one interesting proof thatforeign peoples believed that the Egyptians were able to cure the diseases caused bydemoniacal possession, and the exercise of their powerp. 207on the occasion described was considered to be so noteworthy that the narrative of it wasinscribed upon a stele1 and setup in the temple2 of the god Khonsu at Thebes, so that allmen might read and know what a marvellous cure his priests had effected. It appears thatking Rameses II. was in Mesopotamia \"according to his wont, year by year,\" and all thechiefs of the countries round about came to pay their respects to him, and they sought toobtain his goodwill and protection, probably even an alliance, by bringing to him gifts ofgold, and lapis-lazuli, and turquoise, and of every kind of valuable thing which the landproduced,p. 208and every man sought to outdo his neighbour by the lavishness of his gifts. Among othersthere came the Prince of Bekhten, and at the head of all the offerings which he presentedto His Majesty he placed his eldest daughter, who was very beautiful. When the king sawher he thought her the most beautiful girl he had ever seen, and he bestowed upon her thetitle of \"Royal spouse, chief lady, Râ-neferu\" (i.e., \"the beauties of Râ,\" the Sun-god), andtook her to Egypt; and when they arrived in that country the king married her. One dayduring the fifteenth year of the king's reign, when His Majesty was in Thebes celebratingthe festival of Amen-Râ, a messenger came to the king and reported the arrival of anambassador from the Prince of Bekhten who had brought rich gifts for the royal lady Râ-neferu. When he had been led into the king's presence, he did homage before him, saying,\"Glory and praise be unto thee, O thou Sun of the nations; grant that we may live beforethee!\" Having said these words be bowed down and touched the ground with his headthree times, and said, \"I have come unto thee, O my sovereign Lord, on behalf of the ladyBent-ent-resht, the younger sister of the royal spouse Râ-neferu, for, behold, an evil"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"disease hath laid hold upon her body; I beseech thy Majesty to send a physician1 to seeher.\" Then the king straightway ordered the books of the \"double housep. 209"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Stele recording the casting out of the devil from the Princess of Bekhten.

This sage having come before the king was ordered to set outfor Bekhten in company with the ambassador, and he departed; and when they hadarrived there the Egyptian priest found the lady Bent-ent-resht to be possessed of ademon or spirit over which he was powerless. The Prince of Bekhten, seeing that thepriest was unable to afford relief to his daughter, sent once again to the king, andentreated him to send a god to his help.When the ambassador from Bekhten arrived in Egypt the king was in Thebes, and onhearing what was asked he went into the temple of Khonsu Nefer-hetep, and besoughtthat god to allow his counterpart Khonsu to depart to Bekhten and to deliver the daughterof the prince of that country from the power of the demon that possessed her. It seems asif the sage Tehuti-em-heb had been sent to Bekhten by the advice of the god, for the kingsays, in addressing, the god, \"I have come once again into thy presence\"; but in any caseKhonsu Nefer-hetep agreed to his request, and a fourfold measure of magical power wasimparted to the statue of the god which was to go to Bekhten. The god, seated in his boat,and five otherp. 212boats with figures of gods in them, accompanied by chariots and horses on the right handand on the left, set out from Egypt, and after travelling for seventeen months arrived inBekhten, where they were received with great honour. The god Khonsu went to the placewhere Bent-ent-resht was, and, having performed a magical ceremony over her, thedemon departed from her and she was cured straightway. Then the demon addressed theEgyptian god, saying, \"Grateful and welcome is thy coming unto us, O great god, thouvanquisher of the hosts of darkness! Bekhten is thy city, the inhabitants thereof are thyslaves, and I am thy servant; and I will depart unto the place whence I came that I maygratify thee, for unto this end hast thou come thither. And I beseech thy Majesty tocommand that the Prince of Bekhten and I may hold a festival together.\" To the demon'srequest Khonsu agreed, and he commanded his priest to tell the Prince of Bekhten tomake a great festival in honour of the demon; this having been done by the command ofKhonsu the demon departed to his own place.When the Prince of Bekhten saw that Khonsu was thus powerful, he and all his peoplerejoiced exceedingly, and he determined that the god should not be allowed to return toEgypt, and as a result Khonsu remained in Bekhten for three years, four months, and fivedays. On a certain day, however, the Prince was"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"p. 213sleeping., and he dreamed a dream in which he saw the god Khonsu come forth from hisshrine in the form of a hawk of gold, and having mounted into the air he flew away toEgypt. The Prince woke up in a state of great perturbation, and having inquired of theEgyptian priest was told by him that the god had departed to Egypt, and that his chariotmust now be sent back. Then the Prince gave to Khonsu great gifts, and they were takento Egypt and laid before the god Khonsu Nefer-hetep in his temple at Thebes. In earlyChristian literatures we find a number of examples of demoniacal possession in which thedemon who has entered the body yields it up before a demon of greater power thanhimself, but the demon who is expelled is invariably hostile to him that expels him, andhe departs from before him with every sign of wrath and shame. The fact that it wasbelieved possible for the demon of Bekhten and the god Khonsu to fraternize, and to bepresent together at a festival made by the Prince of the country, shews that the people ofBekhten ascribed the same attributes to spirits or demons as they did to men. The demonwho possessed the princess recognized in Khonsu a being who was mightier than himself,and, like a vanquished king, he wished to make the best terms he could with hisconqueror, and to be on good terms with him.The Egyptians believed that the divine powers frequently made known their will to themby means ofp. 214dreams, and they attached considerable importance to them; the figures of the gods andthe scenes which they saw when dreaming seemed to them to prove the existence ofanother world which was not greatly unlike that already known to them. The knowledgeof the art of procuring dreams and the skill to interpret them were greatly prized in Egyptas elsewhere in the East, and the priest or official who possessed such gifts sometimesrose to places of high. honour in the state, as we may see from the example of Joseph,1for it was universally believed that glimpses of the future were revealed to man indreams. As instances of dreams recorded in the Egyptian texts may be quoted those ofThothmes IV., king of Egypt about B.C. 1450, and Nut-Amen, king of the Eastern Sûdânand Egypt, about B.C. 670. A prince, according to the stele which he set up before thebreast of the Sphinx at Gizeh, was one day hunting near this emblem of Râ-Harmachis,and he sat down to rest under its shadow and fell asleep and dreamed a dream. In it thegod appeared to him, and, having declared that he was the god Harmachis-Khepera-Râ-Temu, promised him that if he would clear away from the Sphinx, his own image, thedrift sand in which it was becoming buried, he would give to him the sovereignty of thelands of the South and of the North,i.e., of all Egypt. In due course the prince becameking of Egypt under the title of Thothmes IV., and the stelep. 215which is dated on the 19th day of the month Hathor of the first year of Thothmes IV.proves that the royal dreamer carried out the wishes of the god.1 Of Nut-Amen, thesuccessor of the great Piânkhi who came down from Gebel Barkal and conquered all"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Egypt from Syene to the sea, we read that in the first year of his reign he one nightdreamed a dream wherein he saw two serpents, one on his right hand and the other on hisleft; when he awoke they had disappeared.

Thelength and the breadth of the land shall be given unto thee, and the god Amen, the onlygod, shall be with thee.\"2 The two serpents were the symbols of the goddesses Nekhebetand Uatchet, the mistresses of the South and North respectively. As the result of hisdream Nut-Amen invaded Egypt successfully and brought back much spoil, a portion ofwhich he dedicated to the service of his god Amen.Since dreams and visions in which the future might be revealed to the sleeper weregreatly desired, the Egyptian magician set himself to procure such for his clients byvarious devices, such as drawing magical pictures and reciting magical words. Thefollowingp. 216are examples of spells for procuring a vision and dreams, taken from British MuseumPapyrus, No. 122, lines 64 ff. and 359 ff.1 \"To obtain a vision from [the god] Bes.

When the body died the shadow departed from it, and couldonly be brought back to it by the performance of a mystical ceremony; the double lived inthe tomb with the body, and was there visited by the soul whose habitation was inheaven. The soul was, from one aspect, a material thing, and like theka, or double, wasbelieved to partake of the funeral offerings which were brought to the tomb; one of thechief objects of sepulchral offerings of meat and drink was to keep the double in the tomband to do away with the necessity of its wandering about outside the tomb in search offood. It is clear from many texts that, unless the double was supplied with sufficient food,p. 218it would wander forth from the tomb and eat any kind of offal and drink any kind of dirtywater which it might find in its path. But besides the shadow, and the double, and thesoul, the spirit of the deceased, which usually had its abode in heaven, was sometimes tobe found in the tomb. There is, however, good reason for stating that the immortal part ofman which lived in the tomb and had its special abode in the statue of the deceased wasthe \"double.\" This is proved by the fact that a special part of the tomb was reserved fortheka, or double, which was called the \"house of theka,\" and that a priest, called the\"priest of theka,\" was specially appointed to minister therein. The double enjoyed thesmell of the incense which was offered at certain times each year in the tomb, as well asthe flowers, and herbs, and meat, and drink; and the statue of the deceased in which thedouble dwelt took pleasure in all the various scenes which were painted or sculptured onthe walls of the various chambers of the tomb, and enjoyed again all the delights whichhis body had enjoyed upon earth. Theka, or double, then, in very early times was, to allintents and purposes, the ghost of the Egyptians. In later times thekhu, or \"spirit,\" seemsto have been identified with it, and there are frequent allusions in the texts to the sanctityof the offerings made to thekhu, and to their territories,i.e., the districts in which theirmummified bodies lie.Whether there was any general belief that thekap. 219orkhu could or did hold intercourse with his relatives or friends whom he left alive uponearth cannot be said, but an instance is known in which a husband complains to his wife,who has been dead for three years, of the troubles which she has brought upon him sinceher death. He describes his own merits and the good treatment which he had vouchsafedto her when she was alive, and declares that the evil with which she is requiting him isnot to be endured. To make his complaint to reach her he first reduced it to writing uponpapyrus, then went to her tomb and read it there, and finally tied the papyrus to a statue orfigure of his wife which was therein; since her double or spirit lived in the tomb shewould, of course, read the writing and understand it.1 It is a pity that we have no meansof knowing what was the result of the husband's complaint. Elsewhere2 we have afragment of a conversation which a priest of Amen called Khonsu-em-heb, who wassearching for a suitable place in which to build his tomb, holds with the. double or spiritof some person whom he has disturbed, and the spirit of the dead tells some details of his"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"life to the living man. The cemeteries were regarded with awe by the ancient Egyptiansbecause of the spirits of the deadp. 220who dwelt in them, and even the Arabic-speaking peoples of Egypt and the Sûdân, if weexclude the \"antiquity grubber,\" have them in great respect for the same reason.1 Themodern peoples of the Sûdân firmly believe that the spirits of those slain in battle dwellon the field where they fell, or where their bodies are buried, and the soldiers in the tenthbattalion of Lord Kitchener's army declare that the grave of the gallant Major Sidney,who was shot while charging at the head of his regiment, in the battle of Abû Hamed,August 7th, 1897, \"is watched regularly every night by the ghosts of the native soldierswho were killed at Abû Hamed, and who mount guard over their dead commander'stomb, challenging, with every military detail, all passers-by. So implicitly is this legendcredited by the blacks that none ofp. 221them will, after dusk, approach the grave. Any one doing so is believed to be promptlyhalted by a phantom sentry, and even the words (in Arabic), 'Guard, turn out!' are often(so the story goes) plainly heard repeated at some distance off across the desert.\"1p. 222The Egyptians believed that a man's fate or destiny was decided before he was born, andthat he had no power whatever to alter it. Their sages, however, professed to be able todeclare what the fate might be, provided that they were given certain data, that is to say,if they were told the date of his birth, and if they were able to ascertain the position of theplanets and stars at that time. The goddess of fate or destiny was called \"Shai,\" and she isusually accompanied by another goddess called \"Renenet,\" who is commonly regarded asthe lady of fortune; they both appear in the Judgment Scene, where they seem to watchthe weighing of the heart on behalf of the deceased. But another goddess, Meskhenet, issometimes present, and she also seems to have had influence over a man's future; in anycase she was able to predict what that future was to be. Thus we read that she and Isis,and Nephthys, and Heqet, disguised as women, went to the house of Râ-user, whose wifeRâ-Tettet was in travail; when they had been taken into her room they assisted her ingiving birth to triplets, and as each child was born Meskhenet declared, \"He shall be aking who shall have dominion over the whole land.\"p. 223[paragraph continues] And this prophecy was fulfilled, for the three boys became three of thekings of the Vth dynasty.1 The Seven Hathor goddesses also could predict the future of ahuman being, for in the well-known \"Tale of Two Brothers\" it is related that, when thegod Khnemu, at the request of Râ-Harmachis, had created for Bata a wife \"who was morebeautiful in her person than any other woman in all the earth, for the essence of every godwas contained in her,\" they came to see her, and that they spake with one voice, saying,\"Her death will be caused by the knife.\" And this came to pass, for, according to the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"story, when the king whose wife she became heard from her first husband that she hadleft him and had wrought evil against him, he entered into judgment with her in thepresence of his chiefs and nobles, and \"one carried out their decree,\"i.e., they sentencedher to death and she was executed. Similarly, in another story, the Seven Hathors came tosee the son who had been born to a certain king in answer to his prayers to the gods, andwhen they had seen him they said, \"He shall die by means of a crocodile, or a serpent, ora dog.\" The story goes on to say how be escaped from the crocodile and the serpent, andthough the end is wanting, it is quite clear that he was wounded by an accidental bite ofhis dog and so died.2 The moral of all such storiesp. 224is that there is no possibility of avoiding fate, and it is most probable that the modernEgyptian has only inherited his ancestors' views as to its immutability.1 A man's lifemight, however, be happy or unhappy according as the hour of the day or the day itselfwas lucky or unlucky, and every day of the Egyptian year was divided into three parts,each of which was lucky or unlucky. When Olympias was about to give birth toAlexander the Great, Nectanebus stood by her making observations of the heavenlybodies, and from time to time he besought her to restrain herself until the auspicious hourhad arrived; and it was not until he saw a certain splendour in the sky and knew that allthe heavenly bodies were in a favourable position that he permitted her to brine, forth herchild. And when he had said, \"O queen, now thou wilt give birth to a governor of theworld,\" the child fell upon the ground while the earth quaked, and the lightnings flashed,and the thunder roared.2 Thus it is quite evident that the future of a child depended evenupon the hour in which he was born.In magical papyri we are often told not to perform certain magical ceremonies on suchand such days, the idea being that on these days hostile powers will make them to bepowerless, and that gods mightier thanp. 225those to which the petitioner would appeal will be in the ascendant. There have comedown to us, fortunately, papyri containing copies of the Egyptian calendar, in which eachthird of every day for three hundred and sixty days of the year is marked lucky orunlucky, and we know from other papyri why certain days were lucky or unlucky, andwhy others were only partly so1. Taking the month Thoth, which was the first month ofthe Egyptian year, and began, according to the Gregorian Calendar, on August 29th, wefind that the days are marked as follows:--"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"p. 226Now the signmeans \"lucky,\" andmeans \"unlucky\"; thus at a glance it couldbe seen which third of the day is lucky or unlucky, and the man who consulted thecalendar would, of course, act accordingly. It must be noted that the priests or magicianswho drew up the calendar had good reasons for their classification of the days, as we maysee from the following example. The 19th day of Thoth is, in the above list, markedwholly lucky,i.e., each third of it is lucky, and the papyrus Sallier IV.1 also marks itwholly lucky, and adds the reason:--\"It is a day of festival in heaven and upon earth in thepresence of Râ. It is the day when flame was hurled upon those who followed the boatcontaining the shrine of the gods; and on this day the gods gave praises being content,\"etc. But in both lists the 26th day is marked wholly unlucky, the reason being, \"This wasthe day of the fight between Horus and Set.\" They first fought in the form of men, thenthey took the form of bears, and in this state did battle with each other for three days andthree nights. Isis aided Set when he was getting the worst in the fight, and Horusthereupon cut off his mother's head, which Thoth transformed by his words of power intothat of a cow and put on her body. On this day offerings are to be made to Osiris andThoth, but work of any kind is absolutely forbidden. The calendars of luckyp. 227"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"and unlucky days do not, however, always agree as to a given day. Thus in the list givenabove the 20th day of Thoth is marked wholly unlucky, but in the papyrus Sallier IV. it iswholly lucky, but the reader is told not to do any work in it, nor to slay oxen, nor toreceive a stranger; on this day the gods who are in the following of Râ slew the rebels.Concerning the fourth day of the next month, Paophi, the papyrus Sallier IV. says, \"Gonot forth from thy house from any side of it; whosoever is born on this day shall die ofthe diseaseaat.\" Concerning the fifth day it says, \"Go not forth from thy house from anyside of it, and hold no intercourse with women. This is the day wherein all things wereperformed in the divine presence, and the majesty of the god Menthu was satisfiedtherein. Whosoever is born on this day shall die of excessive venery.\" Concerning theninth day it says, \"Whosoever is born on this day shall die of old age,\" and concerningthe fifteenth, \"Go not forth from thy dwelling at eventide, for the serpent Uatch, the sonof the god, goeth forth at this time, and misfortunes follow him; whosoever shall see himshall lose his eye straightway.\" Again, the twenty-sixth day of Paophi was a lucky day formaking the plan of a house; on the fifth day of Hathor no fire was to be kindled in thehouse; on the sixteenth day it was forbidden to listen to songs of joy because on this dayIsis and Nephthys wept for Osiris at Abydos;p. 228a man born on the twenty-third day would die by drowning; and so on. But to the threehundred and sixty days given in the calendars of lucky and unlucky days must be addedthe five epagomenal days which were considered to be of great importance and had eachits peculiar name. On the first Osiris was born, on the second Heru-ur (Aroueris), on thethird Set, on the fourth Isis, and on the fifth Nephthys; the first, third, and fifth of thesedays were unlucky, and no work of any kind was to be undertaken on them. The rubricwhich refers to these days1 states that whosoever knoweth their names shall never sufferfrom thirst, that he shall never be smitten down by disease, and that the goddess Sekhet2shall never take possession of him; it also directs that figures of the five gods mentionedabove shall be drawn with unguent andânti scent upon a piece of fine linen, evidently toserve as an amulet.From the life of Alexander the Great by Pseudo-Callisthenes3 we learn that the Egyptianswere skilled in the art of casting nativities, and that knowing the exact moment of thebirth of a man they proceeded to construct his horoscope. Nectanebus employed for thepurpose a tablet made of gold and silver and acacia wood, to which were fitted threebelts. Upon thep. 229outer belt was Zeus with the thirty-sixdecani surrounding him; upon the second thetwelve signs of the Zodiac were represented; and upon the third the sun and moon.1 Heset the tablet upon a tripod, and then emptied out of a small box upon it models of theseven stars2 that were in the belts, and put into the middle belt eight precious stones;these he arranged in the places wherein he supposed the planets which they representedwould be at the time of the birth of Olympias, and then told her fortune from them. Butthe use of the horoscope is much older than the time of Alexander the Great, for to a"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Greek horoscope3 in the British Museum is attached \"an introductory letter from somemaster of the art of astrology to his pupil, named Hermon, urging him to be very exactand careful in his application of the laws which he ancient Egyptians, with their laboriousdevotion to the art, had discovered and handed down to posterity.\" Thus we have goodreason for assigning the birthplace of the horoscope to Egypt. In connexion with thehoroscope must be mentioned the \"sphere\" or \"table\" of Democritus as a means ofmaking predictions as to life and death. In a magicalp. 230papyrus1 we are told to \"ascertain in what month the sick man took to his bed, and thename he received at his birth. Calculate the [course of] the moon, and see how manyperiods of thirty days have elapsed; then note in the table the number of days left over,and if the number comes in the upper part of the table, he will live, but if in the lowerpart, he will die.\"Both from the religious and profane literature of Egypt we learn that the gods and man inthe future life were able at will to assume the form of any animal, or bird, or plant, orliving thing, which they pleased, and one of the greatest delights to which a man lookedforward was the possession of that power. This is proved by the fact that no less thantwelve2 of the chapters of the Book of the Dead are devoted top. 231providing the deceased with the words of power, the recital of which was necessary toenable him to transform himself into a \"hawk of gold,\" a \"divine hawk,\" \"the governor ofthe sovereign princes,\" \"the god who giveth light in the darkness,\" a lotus, the god Ptah, abennu bird (i.e., phœnix), a heron, a \"living soul,\" a swallow, the serpent Sata, and acrocodile; and another chapter1 enabled him to transform himself into \"whatever form hepleaseth.\" Armed with this power he could live in the water in the form of a crocodile, inthe form of a serpent he could glide over the rocks and ground, in the form of the birdsmentioned above he could fly through the air, and soar up and perch himself upon thebow of the boat of Râ, in the form of the lotus he had mastery over the plants of the field,and in the form of Ptah he became \"more powerful than the lord of time, and shall gain"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"the mastery over millions of years.\" Thebennu bird, it will be remembered, was said tobe the \"soul of Râ,\" and by assuming this form the deceased identified himself withKhepera, the great god of creation, and thus acquired the attributes of the soul of the Sun-god. In the Elysian Fields he was able to assume any form and to swim and fly to anydistance in any direction. It is noteworthy that no beast of the field or wild animal ismentioned as a type of his possible transformations into animals.p. 232Now the Egyptians believed that as the souls of the departed could assume the form ofany living thing or plant, so the \"gods,\" who in many respects closely resembled them,could and did take upon themselves the forms of birds and beasts; this was thefundamental idea of the so-called \"Egyptian animal worship,\" which provoked themerriment of the cultured Greek, and drew down upon the Egyptians the ridicule andabuse of the early Christian writers. But if the matter be examined closely its apparentstupidity disappears. The Egyptians paid honour to certain birds, and animals, andreptiles, because they considered that they possessed certain of the characteristics of thegods to whom they made them sacred. The bull was a type of the strength and procreativepower of the god of reproduction in nature, and the cow was the type of his femalecounterpart; every sacred animal and living thing possessed some quality or attributewhich was ascribed to some god, and as each god was only a form of Râ, the quality orattribute ascribed to him was that of the Sun-god himself. The educated Egyptian neverworshipped an animal as an animal, but only as an incarnation of a god, and the reverencepaid to animals in Egypt was in no way different from that paid to the king, who wasregarded as \"divine\" and as an incarnation of Râ the Sun-god, who was the visiblesymbol of the Creator. The relation of the king to Râ was identical with that of Râ toGod. Thep. 233[paragraph continues] Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans never understood the logical conceptionwhich underlay the reverence with which the Egyptians regarded certain animals, and asa result they grossly misrepresented their religion. The ignorant people, no doubt, oftenmistook the symbol for what it symbolized, but it is wrong to say that the Egyptiansworshipped animals in the ordinary sense of the word, and this fact cannot be too stronglyinsisted on. Holding the views he did about transformations there was nothing absurd inthe reverence which the Egyptian paid to animals. When a sacred animal died the godwhom it represented sought out another animal of the same species in which to renew hisincarnation, and the dead body of the animal, inasmuch as it had once been the dwelling-place of a god, was mummified and treated in much the same way as a human body afterdeath, in order that it might enjoy immortality. These views seem strange, no doubt, to uswhen judged by modern ideas, but they formed an integral part of the religious beliefs ofthe Egyptians, from the earliest to the latest times. What is remarkable, however, is thefact that, in spite of invasions, and foreign wars, and internal dissensions, and externalinfluences of all kinds, the Egyptians clung to their gods and the sometimes childish andillogical methods which they adopted in serving them with a conservatism and zeal which"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"have earned for them the reputation of being at once the most religious and mostsuperstitious nation ofp. 234antiquity. Whatever literary treasures may be brought to light in the future as the result ofexcavations in Egypt, it is most improbable that we shall ever receive from that countryany ancient Egyptian work which can properly be classed among the literature of atheismor freethought; the Egyptian might be more or less religious according to his nature andtemperament, but, judging, from the writings of his priests and teachers which are now inour hands, the man who was without religion and God in some form or other was mostrare, if not unknown.Footnotes206:1 As recently as 1895 this belief existed in Ireland, for according to the Times of April 2, 3, 6,and 8, Michael Cleary was charged on April 1 at Clonmel with having, on March 14, burnt his wifeBridget, aged 27, for being a witch, thus causing her death, at Baltyvadhen, p. 207 countyTipperary. Johanna Burke swore that boiling herbs out of a saucepan on the fire were forceddown the throat of the deceased, her husband asking her in the name of the Father, Son, andHoly Ghost, if she was his wife. He then stripped her naked, threw her on the floor, and pouringparaffin over her, set her on fire. Cleary, assisted by J. Dunne, P. Kennedy, W. Kennedy, andothers, next took her to the fire and forced her to sit upon it in order to \"drive out the witch\" whichpossessed her. She was next laid upon the bed and shaken, while her husband recited the words\"Away with you,\" meaning the evil spirit, or spirits, and at six o'clock on the morning of the 15th ofMarch the priest was sent for to exorcise the spirits with which the house was thought to be filled.A herbalist called Denis Ganey was present at the time, being charged as an accessory beforethe fact.

The following from theTimes of July 7, 1899, is worth quoting:--\"THE GRAVE OF A BRITISH NAVAL OFFICER IN JAPAN.--Recently a report came to the earsof the British Consul at Hiogo that the grave of a British naval officer existed near a village on theisland of Hiroshima, in the Inland Sea of Japan-a place rarely visited by any foreigner-and that,for some reason, it was carefully kept in order by the peasants in the neighbourhood. The Consulaccordingly communicated with the Governor of the prefecture in which the island is situated;inquiries were made, and the Governor was able to send to the Consul a history of the lonelygrave. The story was appended by the Governor to a formal despatch of his own, and wasobviously drawn up by the village headman or some equally humble official, and it is worth givingin full. The Sylvia, the vessel mentioned, was for many years engaged in surveying off the coastsof Japan:--'In the first year of Meiji, corresponding to A.D. 1868, H.B.M.S. Sylvia was proceedingon a voyage through the Inland Sea when an officer on board, named Lake, fell ill. He was landedon the island of Hiroshima, at the village of Hiroshima, in the district of Naka, province of Sanuki,and prefecture of Kagawa. The Sylvia proceeded along the coast of Hiroshima and cast anchor atEnoura Bay, to await the officer's recovery. In a few days, however, he died, and Captain St.John buried his remains in ground belonging to the temple of Ikwoji above Enoura shrine, and,having set up a wooden cross to mark the grave, departed. Several years afterwards, when thismonument had almost decayed from the effects of wind and rain, frost and snow, AwaburiTokwan, Superior of Ikwoji Temple, and others said:--\"Truly it would be too sad if the grave of oursolitary guest from afar, who has become a spirit in a strange land, were suffered to pass out ofall knowledge.\" Thereupon Terawaki Kaemon, head of a village guild, and other sympathisers,such as Oka Ryohaku, set on foot a scheme for the erection of a stone monument, and, the shorefolk all with one accord p. 222 lending their help, the work was finally brought to completion. Thiswas on the 7th day of the eleventh month of the fourth year of Meiji--that is, 1871. Since thennearly 30 winters have passed, during which time the islanders have not neglected to take goodcare of the tomb. In particular, from the 10th to the 16th day of the seventh month, old style, thereare still persons found who every year clean and sweep the grave, and, offering up flowers andincense, mourn for and console the spirit of the dead.'\"223:1 See Erman, Westcar Papyrus, Berlin, 1890, hieroglyphic transcript, pll. 9 and 10.223:2 See Maspero, Contes Égyptiens, pp. 29-46."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"224:1 The uneducated Muhammadan believes that man's fate is written upon his skull, and thatthe sutures are the writing.
