They reflect the images of the ancient Egyptians about the life of a king after physical death and present a rich source of philological material still in need of urgent study. The correct reading of these monumental texts is necessary for an integral understanding of the funerary cult of a king. Important work in the field of the Pyramid Texts has been done by James Allen. Due to the work of this outstanding scholar, we have essentially enriched our knowledge of the language of these ancient texts. Since the editing by Prof. Allen of his translation of the Pyramid Texts in the year 2005 (J. P. Allen. The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts. Society of Biblical Literature, Atlanta), his work has become the standard. However, as our knowledge of language steadily grows it is apparent that there is still much to be done. The present work is an attempt to thoroughly look into the whole PT corpus to add to, and sometimes to contradict, the readings suggested by Prof. Allen. Several new suggestions will be presented on these pages, e.g. the discovery of the collocation bA m \"make an impression/affection on, impress/affect\" (W 134, 2). Moreover, it has been observed that the ending -tj/wtj (as a variant of the t-ending) was a common feature of the attributive forms (relative forms, participles), for instance there is more than one example of the relative perfect spelled sDmtj.n.f (a variant of the more common sDmt.n.f) and many sDmtj.f relative forms (W 155, 4, T 203, 3). The work also proposes that spellings like mrjj n jt(j).f should be interpreted as perfect relative \"whom his father loves\" (i.e. mrjj.n jt(j).f, the same was proposed by James Allen), taking into consideration the number of instances in which the perfect of 3rd-weak verbs has a final double reed-panicle (P 517, 1). One characteristic of the present work is that some words are not considered as independent semantic units but as a variant spelling of (an)other word(s) for the sake of word-play or as an unknown dialectal form. For instance, the verb drp \"feed, present, offer\" may be spelled /dAp/ just to make a word play between this verb and the noun dAb(w) \"figs\" (a case of /A/ ~ /r/ ~ /n/ ~ /l/), the verb wAH \"lie\" could be spelled with two allophones as mnH in the stative form: PT 554, §1371b: abA.k mnH.j m Drt.k ~ Jéquier, Pepi II, pl. 6, col. 709+2: abA.k wAH.j m Drt.k \"your baton lies in your hand\" (W 166, 1). In addition, more instances of a 1ms pronoun have been found (T 204, 1, 4). The work suggests a lot of new readings; it also provides support to many of the readings by Prof. Allen. Of course, the readings proposed in this work do not claim to be the final word on the matter, their aim is to give food for thought on the correctness of translation of some passages in this large corpus..

Moreover, the normal designation for \"toothless, suckling calf\" is bHz jrTt(j) (§27d, lit. \"milk calf\"). The word xAbw or xAb jbHw (due the presence of the bH-{tusk}-F18 sign which is carved much clearer in the copy of Senusert-ankhu (Hayes, The Texts, col. 474)) rather seems to mean \"crooked (teeth)\" or \"crooked of teeth\", from a root SAb/XAb/xAb (for /x/ ~ /X/ ~ /S/ in these word and others, see W 88). \"Calf crooked of teeth\" would be a metaphor for a snake whose only pair of teeth is also crooked (cf. Allen’s note 6, page 61). W 2 (PT 227) §227b: xs(r) Allen \"God-expelling scorpion\" Shmakov \"Expelling scorpion (?)\" The nTr-{cloth wound on pole}-R8 sign seems to stay for s-{folded cloth}-S29, because it faces unnaturally backwards and is inserted between x and {arm holding stick} (cf. similar spelling xs(r) in §§1244b PM, 2158c), which is strange should it really be a \"god\". W 3 (PT 228) §228a: xr Hr r Hr mAn Hr Hr prj nm km wAD r.s Allen \"Face has fallen on face, face has seen face. The dappled knife, all black and green, has emerged\" Shmakov \"Glance has caught (lit. fallen (on)to) glance, face has seen face. The black and green knife has emerged against it\" The word Hr has the meaning \"look, gaze, glance\" in this passage, not the literal \"face\", see T 264, 2. The sign {foxhide}-F27/28 that occurs in this passage isn’t a phonogram sAb \"dappled\". It seems to be a phonogram for nm (occurs in knm (§1197b) and knmwt (§§1226e N, 1462a Pb)), together with nm-{butcher knife}-T35 making nm \"knife\". Hence the sign F27/28 plays the role of the complementary unnecessary sign. Cf. Teti’s version of the similar spell PT 290 (§§431a-b) that has nm km \"black knife\" without F27/28 (the only difference between W and T is the sign for km). Note also that when the {foxhide} stays for sAb the complementary s is usually spelled (§1211c; Urk.I:81:1, 135:9, 177:11; L.D.II:21). Allen ignores r.s in this and §§431a-b passages, however he reads its variant in Neith’s PT 290, Nt 716: prj...r.k \"has emerged...against you\". W 4 (PT 229) §229a-b: ant tw nn nt tm...s.zAt Xnw m wnw Allen \"This is the fingernail of Atum...the one that stripped chaos from Hermopolis\" Shmakov \"This is the fingernail of Atum...that removed disturbance from Hermopolis\" The meaning of the causative verb s.zA is \"remove\", literally \"make betake oneself \", \"make leave\". It may be compared with the verb s.rwj \"remove\", which likewise literally means \"make go away\", \"make depart\". Cf. also PT 518, §1197e: s.zA.jn.sn mnxt.sn \"Then they removed their linen garment\"."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 W 5 (PT 230) §230a: nSfwj.k m tA spHt.k m bAbA Allen \"Your two drops into the earth! Your two ribs into the hole!\" Shmakov \"Your two (poisonous) spittles are in the earth, (snake), your skeleton is in the hole\" The word spHt has the meaning \"bundle, knot (of ribs)\", not ribs themselves. The two {rib}-F42 signs as the determinative of this word came about under the influence of spHt (nt) spr \"bundle (of) ribs\", see P 32, 4, and their quantity (two signs) probably doesn’t indicate the dual number of spHt (cf. CT VII, 3t). In this passage it probably rather has the meaning \"a bundle (of ribs/bones)\", i. e. skeleton, chest, cf. CT V, 208a: psD gbb spHt Ast Snaw nHb-kAw r<n>.s \"its (i. e. bank’s) name is spine of Geb, skeleton of Isis, chest of Apportioner of Kas\" (cf. also ibid, 203d, CT VI, 38e).

PT 285, §426a: jw nSz(wj).k jr Szw(j).k \"(Put) your two (poison) drops to your two cups (i. e. poison-glands ?)!\" (the snake is subsequently ordered to keep the poison within glands).

Thanks to Toby Wilkinson we know it is actually Mafdet-genet’s fetish: \"a sealing of Den from Abydos shows the fetish of Mafdet [i. e. the sign T18 – T. S.] (Petrie 1900: pl. XXXII:39 [Mafdet is climbing the sign-T18 – T. S.]); two fragments of a stone vessel show Mafdet as a lioness, identified as “mistress of the mansion of life” (nbt Hwt anx) (Petrie 1900: pl.

For the identification of Mafdet as a genet (rather than a feline at least originally) we are indebted to Hermann Kees (Kees H., Der Götterglaube im Alten Ägypten. Berlin (DDR), 1956. pp. 33-34). Mihail Korostovcev supported this identification (the following passage was translated into English by the present author): \"The goddess Mafdet, mentioned in the \"Pyramid Texts\", was personified by a small predatory animal – an ordinary genet from the viverra family\" (M. Korostovcev, Religia Drevnego Egypta (The religion of the Ancient Egypt). Chapter I. Fetishism and totemism. A cult of animals. Moscow, Nauka (publisher). 1976). Mafdet-genet’s fetish is often represented in the two solar boats (§§335c T, 336a T, 496a (morning boat); 150a, 335b T, 336a T, 497a (evening boat)), and it occurs in the model solar boat of Imhotep (MMA 14.3.22) with two perches with falcons (cf. the sign {falcon on a perch} in §468a N and two falcons resting on two perches depicted in the two leading (mAatj) boats in §1785b). There are another fetish-signs (or emblem-signs) used in hieroglyphs, such are O44 (fetish of Min), R20 (fetish of Seshat), R22 (emblem of Min), R24 (fetish of Neith) and {Bat emblem} (§§712b TPaMN (see T 284, 1), 1096b). 4) §233b: Sn pt Sn tA Sn (j)m(j)-Dr-bAH HA rxt Allen \"Sky will entwine, earth will entwine, the Male who turns around the subjects will entwine\" Shmakov \"Entwined has been the sky, entwined has been the earth, (once) The Original one in charge of the rxt-people has been entwined\" All Sn’s in the passage are probably passive sDm.f’s. The text probably has a nisbe of the compound preposition (j)m(j)-Dr-bAH \"he who is before\". Actually, we probably have two compounds: m-bAH + Dr-bAH = m-Dr-bAH, cf. the compound preposition m-Dr (§113b, Nt 281: t dwA m-Dr rr.f \"the morning bread in its (proper) time\"). Dr plus {penis} sign is the usual way to write Dr-bAH \"before\" in Old Egyptian (Urk.I:43:5, 45:4, 84:17, 101:4; also with {papyrus scroll} determinative – ibid:106:3, 125:7, 127:11, 129:4, 138:16). Likewise, m plus {penis} sign is the usual way to write m-bAH \"before\" (§§2c, 18a,b, 63c, 490c, 753c, 1189b, 1219c, d, 1774b, 2086c; Urk.I:13:10, 15, 75:14, 223:12, 15). The {penis} sign could not be the determinative of a form of the verb mDr \"turn\", for this verb never has a determinative in the whole PT corpus. So if we were to read mDr, then the {penis} would need to be read as an ideogram-phonogram TA(jj) \"man, male\" (which occurs in §§601b, 1462c), but such a construction (verb (Sn) + verb (mDr) + subject (TA)) is impossible. There is a small possibility that Dr-bAH is independent of (j)m(j), and is the nisbe \"that which is before\", i. e. \"the original/primeval state\", but if so then the sense of the line hardly changes: \"He who is in the primeval state in charge of the rxt-people will entwine\". Cp. it with jmj pAt.f \"who is in his origin/primeval time\" (plural in CT VI, 393l: jmjw pAwt.sn). The present author supposes this is less possible and prefer the first treatment. For HA \"behind, around\" as \"in charge of\", cf.

The rest of the passage is unclear, for the verb xmj, see W 169, 5. The reading by the present author is arguable as it needs emendation in the text: jatj {n} m xmw. The reading by Allen is also arguable as the sign N25 doesn’t seem to be an ideogram nor we have complements to read it xAst \"desert, mounting range\" or z(mjj)t \"desert\".

It is very speculative to translate tjtj as \"Trampled Porphyrite\" because the meaning could be \"twice trampled\", as there also is a verb tjtj \"trample\", and a {stone} determinative is missing. What Allen reads as bj \"Foot-trampled\" is probably (j)bj \"he of the heart\", a term that could refer to a heart’s vessel, the word jbj occurs fully spelled in §426c: Htt jbj \"windpipe, one of the heart\". For note that the {heart} sign is not determinative of the word \"windpipe\", see §§270c, 451c where the sign {head and neck of animal}-F11 is the determinative of this word. Moreover, this jbw \"one of the heart\" occurs in CT II, 130f along with tjw \"long one\" (after Allen).

Literally the whole passage is \"Don’t do that you became free of him: beware, so that you may not do becoming free of him\". The traditional reading of zA as \"beware (lest)\" doesn’t make sense, as then we get a meaningless phrase \"Beware lest you don’t do\".

W 20 (PT 25) §17a: zj zj Hna kA.f Allen \"Someone has gone with his ka\" Shmakov \"(lit.)

It is clear that such a construction was a way in which ancient Egyptian expressed the notion of \"someone, something\", for which a word or word-formation as such did not exist. So Allen’s"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19translation is excellent, but it might be useful to have a closer look at the literal meaning. In such constructions the participle probably has a modal meaning, i. e. the literal translation is probably \"The one who was to go (or \"was going to go\") has gone\", rather than a meaningless \"The one who has gone has gone\". Alan Gardiner writes in his grammar about the ability of participles in ancient Egyptian to have modal meaning: \"Use of the participles to express obligation or the like. Egyptian lacking equivalents for such notions as ‘ought’, ‘have to’, these may be implicit in the meaning of simple participles, whether active or passive\" (Gardiner, E. G., §371, p. 287). Cf. also T 145, 4. Allen himself does not address this topic in his grammar, but does translate a participle as having modal meaning in PT 254, §290c: jw nD.n sw wnjs m-a jrw nn jr.f \"Unis has saved himself from those who would do this against [him]\". He does not read jrw as \"those who did/those who have done/those who do\", but sensibly as \"those who would do\". That is, Unis does not save himself from a negative action that others already did (for that would be too late), but from something they were about to do, but haven’t done, as Unis has saved himself (timely). We can also suggest a translation \"who were going to do (this against [him])\", \"who were to do (this against [him])\", etc.. The same \"modal\" reading by Allen occurs in Nt 779 jr.n(.j) n.f jrt \"I have done for him what should be done\". Some other examples of the construction: Sin.

Part (a) is about natron cleansing and thematically belongs to three previous spells – PT 32, 34, 35. Part (b) is a double of §18c-d, referring to incense burning. Allen opted for \"natron\" as the presented substance, basing himself upon the presence of part (a), having a natron-cleansing theme. But if one would go by part (b), it is rather a pellet of incense that is being presented. You can notice something similar in the spell in Sethy’s I temple at Abydos. The spell is about incense cleansing as is clear from the text and the image of a priest burning incense, but it too contains part (b) with a natron cleansing theme: Sethy I, Abydos II, pl. 30: r n s.wab nswt m s.nTr Dd mdw jn Hrw jwn mwt.f wab Hrw snTr.n.f s<w> m jrt.f nt Dt.f wab nswt mn-mAat-ra wab.n.f sw m jrt Hrw nt Dt.f jw.f wab(.w) Ddwj s.nTr.n.f sw m jrt Hrw nt Dt.f rdj.n.f Htm.f sw jm m rn.f pwy n p(A)Dw n(w) snTr wab nswt mn-mAat-ra jm mj wab sw ra jm wab Asjr(t) xntj Hwt skrj jm.s bd.k bd Hrw TAz-pXr bd.k bd gbb TAz-pXr bd.k bd DHwtj TAz-pXr r n zA ra sty mr.n ptH mj ra r n {n}<bH>z jrtt hr(w) ms s<w> mwt.f jm \"A spell of cleansing the king with incense.

PT 420, §750a: hA tjt pw wab s.nTr Tw n ra \"Ho, Teti! Become clean, cense yourself for the Sun\" (after Allen) The verb snTr probably has the meaning \"cense\", not \"cleanse with natron\", and the derived noun snTr would mean \"censing\", cf.: PT 684, §2053b: Sd.sn pjpj nfr-kA-ra jr pt jr pt Hr Htj n snTr \"They will take Pepi Neferkare to the sky, to the sky on the smoke of censing\" James Allen reads \"on the smoke of incense\", but his interpretation is arguable, as usually the ancient Egyptians wrote snTr (Hr) sDt/xt \"incense (on) the fire\" when they wanted to express the action of \"censing\" nonverbally, as incense itself cannot give smoke. Moreover, this sentence is related to PT 267, §365b: prr.f Hr Htj n jdt wrt \"He will ascend on the smoke from (lit. of) great censing\". The same phenomenon occurs in the following passage: PT 463, §877a: TAw.k s.nTr mHt.k Htj Allen \"Your air is incense; your northwind, smoke\" Shmakov \"Your air is censing; your northwind is smoke (from the censing)\" In the following passage from a spell pronounced by Thoth in the temple of Sethy I at Abydos, a spell which occurs earlier under the reign of Hatshepsut (Naville, Deir el Bahari V, pl. 139) and Thothmes"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23III (Urk.IV:873:13-874:12), the verb s.nTr is used in the section about censing (Part a) while s.wab is used in the section about natron cleansing (Part b): Sethy I, Abydos II, pl. 35, Naville, Deir el Bahari V, pl. 139: dj.f n.k s.ntr Htp kA.k kAp.f tw Hr jrt.k wDAT (sic, i. e. wDAt) s.ntr.f tw Hr prt xnt.k psDt xnm.s stj.k jdt prt m jf.k...s.wab.f tw m bd Hzmn \"(Part a) He will give you incense that your ka may become content, he will fumigate you by means of your sound eye, he will cense you by means of (Hr) the emerged one of your face (i. e. the eye), the Ennead smells your scent, dews emerged from your flesh...(Part b) he will cleanse you with natron (and) soda solution\" The word that is spelled snTr plus {braizer with flame}-Q7 sign, and which Hermann Junker transliterates snTr and reads \"räuchern\" (\"censing\", e.g. Junker, Giza IV, p.101), probably cannot be taken into consideration as another proof for the notion that the verb snTr has the meaning \"cense\". For the inscription in the mastaba of Akhethetep shows that this formation was an abbreviated spelling of snTr (Hr) sDt/xt \"incense (on) the fire\" ~ \"censing\" as it has complementary t after the {brazier} sign in it (Davies, Ptahhetep II, pl.31: snTr-{braizer with flame}-t, i. e. snTr sDt/xt). (snTr plus {braizer with flame} occurs in the mastaba of Sankhuiptah (s.anx-w(j)-ptH \"Ptah has made me live\", Kanawati-Raziq, Sankhuiptah, pl. 67(or 71)), Watetkhethor (wat(j)t-Xt-Hrw \"Unique one of Horus’s (i. e. king’s) belly\", Kanawati-Raziq, Watetkhethor, chamber B5, north and south reliefs of the west wall), and Meriteti (mrjj tjt \"whom (king) Teti loves\", Kanawati-Raziq, Meryteti, pl. 49), snTr with {braizer} determinative (probably determinative rather than ideogram for sDt or xt \"fire\") though is parallel to the action stt mw \"pouring water\" (Sankhuiptah), Djt qbHw \"giving cool water\" (Watetkhethor, Meritety). snTr also occurs in the mastaba of Kaiemankh (Junker, Giza IV, p. 23, Abb.7), but there it does not have {braizer with flame} and is parallel to the noun (not action) qbH \"cool water\").

Harold Hays in his dissertation reads pAt wDAt of this passage similarly as pA.t wDA.t \"a whole Pat-cake\" (Hays, Structure, p.78, note 75). W 38 (PT 50) §37d: Dsrt Allen \"Sweeping the offering table\" Shmakov \"a table (with meal)\" The text has {offering table (with legs) with bread loaves} followed by Dsrt. This likely should not be read as *Dsrt wdHw (or *Dsrt xAwt) as Allen seems to do, for apart from the order of the words, it should be noted that the verb Dsr is a 3-lit. verb, meaning the infinitive \"sweeping\" would be Dsr, not Dsrt. (That there would exist a verb Dsr \"sweep\" is in itself debatable, see W 225). So it would sooner be a piece of cultic furniture: Dsrt. For lists of such pieces of furniture, cf. L.D.II:28: Dsrwt xA \"a thousand of tables\", ibid:44, b: xA xAwt xA Htp xA Dsrt \"thousand of offering tables, thousand of altars, thousand of tables (with meal)\". The option that there’s only one object, Dsrt, could be supported by Neferkare’s version of the text, which has Dsrt followed by an empty offering table as determinative. This word Dsrt is probably the same as the word Dsr \"table\" (Wb.V:617:10) , cf. gsA \"two-legged headrest\" (Murray, Saq. Mas., pl. 2), which is also spelled with t-ending – gsAwt (Moussa-Altenmüller, Niankhhnum, Tf. 62), gst (Brovarski, An Inventory List, p. 119, fig. 1). It is noteworthy that Harold Hays reads Dsrt similarly in his dissertation \"a sacred (offering table)\" (Hays, Structure, p.80, note 88)."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 W 41 (PT 128) §38c: jrt Hrw zx(j)ntj.k Allen \"Horus’s eye, which you should embrace\" Shmakov \"Horus’s eye which you sought\" zx(j)ntj is a relative form of the verb zx(j)n, which is sometimes spelled with jn-pot (§§310e T, 314e), just like in Neferkare’s copy of this spell, and thus probably must be read zxjn. This verb always has the meaning \"seek\" in the PT (cf. §§310e, 314e, 575a, 600c, 1008c, 1799a, 1936a, 1945c, 2059a), as the PT use HjHj \"seek\" very seldom (§§1242b, 2145b), and do not use Dar \"seek\". In the PT, zxn does not have the meaning \"embrace\", the notion of embracing is rather expressed by the phrases Xnw aw(j) (§208b) \"arm(s)’ inside, a hug\", m Xnw a(wj) (§§151e, 212b, 258d) \"inside the arm(s), in a hug\", Sn m Xnw a(wj) (§§160b, 213a) \"encircle inside the arm(s), embrace\", sbx a(wj) HA (§585c) \"enfold arm(s) around, embrace\", d a(wj) HA (§1653a, b) \"put arm(s) around, embrace\", awj HA \"arms around!, embrace!\" (§§189b, 190b, non-verbal imperative, see P 318, 2). The meaning \"seek\" especially applies when referring to the Eye, cf. the New Kingdom copy in the temple of Sethy I at Abydos, which gives (Sethy I, Abydos II, pl.32, 35, col. 6, bottom): jrt Hrw zxn(t).f \"Horus’s eye which he (i. e.

For the latter phenomenon, cf. xfa (Wb.III:272:1) ~ kfa (Wb.V:121:2) \"grasp\" (cf. also Edel, Alta. Gr., §119). A very probable example nkjkj ~ nxjxj may be added, for the root of the verb spelled nkjkj in the following PT passage cannot be nk \"copulate\", as that verb is never spelled nkj; the root is sooner nxj \"endure, last\" (§§256d, 663b, c, 1292a; for the meaning, see T 248, 2): PT 479, §990a: ra nkjkj Xt nwt Xr mtwt Ax jm.s \"Sun, Nut’s belly has grown (lit. endured, lasted) with (lit. having) the seed of the akh who is in her\" (This passage is a variant of PT 325, §532a: hpAT j.TApr Xt pt Xr At mtwt nTr jmjtj.s \"Howler, the sky’s belly has swollen with (lit. having) the force of the god’s seed that is in it\") In that light, the unknown verb nkAkA in PT 690 may probably be equated with nxAxA \"endure\" (CT I, 296c (T9C, Sq3C)), spelled with xA-{shell}-L6 sign, instead of the usual spelling with x (ibid, T2C, B10C), which is a case of xA ~ x, see Edel, Alta.

So in general, the prepositions m and Hr often show interchangeability when used in collocations. In the PT text at hand, the spelling s.fkk is used instead of the usual s.fxx to make a word-play between s.fkk and sfT \"pine oil\", i. e. sfk’ ~ sfT, a case of /k/ ~ /T/, cf.: kw (§218c W) ~ Tw (ibid TMN) \"you\", sk (§§327a T, 483b) ~ sT (§327a W) \"adverbial marker\", Dd.k (§17c) ~ Dd.T (§1800b) ~ Dd.kT (§27c, Nt 88, combined Dd.k + Dd.T = Dd.kT) \"too, as well\", kbw(tj) (§22b) ~ Tbw(t) \"sole, foot\" (§681e) ~ Tbwwt/Tbwtj (§§1297c, 1368c, 2016b, Urk.I:102:13, 105:11, 17, also in the M.K.; in the N.K. also > tbwtj) \"sandals\". See also Edel, Alta. Gr., §111. 2) §51a: sfT Allen \"Pine oil\" James Allen is probably right, as sometimes this oil name is written with a {piece of wood}-M187 sign, see the mastaba of Kaiemankh (Junker, Giza IV, Tf. 16), the mastaba of Nikainisut II (nj-kA(.j)-(n)swt \"My ka belongs to the king\", Junker, Giza III, Abb. 22, between pp. 154 and 155), Kai (Junker, Giza III, Abb.17, p. 135), Nisedjerkai (nj-sDr-kA(.j) \"My ka cannot lie\", Junker, Giza II, p.119-20, Abb. 9, 10), Nefer (Junker, Giza VI, Abb.10, p. 47), Ueri (Junker, Giza VI, Abb. 72, p. 197), Minu (Junker, Giza VI, Abb. 98, p. 236), Ateta (jttj, probably for jtjt, Murray, Saq.

W 49 (PT 75) §51b: jrt Hrw Snmt.n.f Allen \"Horus’s eye, which he rejoined\" Shmakov \"Horus’s eye, which he shielded\" For the meaning of the verb Snm/Xnm, see W 165, 7; cf. also CT VII, 134e (G1T): Asjr(t) N pn mj n.k jrt Hrw jnt.n.f Xnmt.n.f nTrw jm.s \"This Osiris N, take Horus’s eye with which he has brought and shielded the gods\" W 51 (PT 77) §53a: Dj.T Sat.f m jrtj Axw {k}<nb> Allen \"you shall put his ferocity in the eyes of all the akhs\" Shmakov \"you shall inspire (lit. give) the veneration of him in the eyes of all the akhs\" The meaning of the passage is that a feeling of awe and dread is evoked, a feeling that shows in the eyes of the akhs. There is a word-play in the passage between HAt (§52a, b) plus Sat (§53a) and HAt(j)t aS \"first class cedar oil\" (§53b). W 52 (PT 78) §54a: HAt(j)t THnw Allen \"First-class Libyan oil\" Shmakov \"First-class Libyan cedar oil\" It is interesting that this oil occurs with a {piece of wood}-M187 sign as the determinative in the offering-lists of the mastabas of Userinetjer (wsr-nTr(.j) \"My god (i. e. king) is strong\", Murray, Saq. Mas., pl.21, 23); Weeks, Cemetery G 6000, fig. 30 (= L.D.II:49, b); Junker, Giza X, Abb. 64, after p. 166; Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 25:28 (k(A.j)-s.DA-(wj) II), 49:61 (dfDj), 73:80 (= Hassan, Giza VII, fig. 101, p. 104, Htpj), 81:91-92 (nfr-sSm-sSAt), suggesting that the oil originated from the wood of a tree, just like sfT \"pine oil (after Allen)\" (see W 48, 2) and aS \"cedar oil\" (§53b). W 53 (PT 79-80) §54c: s.dm(j.j) n.k jr(t) Hrw wDAt r Hr.k Allen \"Horus’s eye has been painted sound on your face\" Shmakov \"I am attaching the sound eye of Horus to your face for you\" The verb in the passage is likely not sdm \"pencil, outline (eyes)\", but rather the causative of the simplex dmj \"touch\". Firstly, because there is no obvious sense in \"Horus’s sound eye has been outlined to your face\" (passive), for what does \"outline/pencil to (r) a face\" mean? (exactly \"to, towards\", contrary to \"pencil on\", cp. zSA Hr \"write/draw/paint on\"). Secondly, because the passage, as many others, contains a word-play, namely between the verb s.dm(j) \"attach\" and the noun msd(m)t \"(black) eyepaint\" (§54d); were we to take s.dm(j) as sdm \"pencil, outline (eyes)\", then there’s no longer a real play on the words, as sdm and msd(m)t have one semantic root sdm. For normally, a word-play consist of two semantically different words (i. e. words from different roots) that sound alike, for example \"you are full in your identity of fuel tank\" (a word-play on \"full\" and \"fuel\" – words have different roots), contrary to \"you are full in your identity of full tank\" (there is no word-play). This rule seems to hold also for ancient Egyptian word-plays, although exceptions may have existed (§§479a, 785d probably are such an exception, with jAq \"climb\" and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30m.Aqt \"ladder\", Hr \"be far\" and Hrt \"(Celestial) Distance\" being of the same root). Thirdly, Neferkare’s §55d gives s.dmj \"attach\" (the verb in §55d N should be the same as in §55b,c N which is spelled sdm) as well as §54c in the copy of Senusert-ankhu (Hayes, The Texts, col. 143) and §609c (see T 196, 3), while sdm \"pencil, outline (eyes)\" is never spelled with the mj-W19 sign. Moreover, in §283a (both WT) the verb sdm occurs with the {outlined eye}-D7 sign as the determinative, which doesn’t occur in §54c, 55b, c (Neferkare’s editor wrote only the {papyrus scroll}-Y2 sign after s.dm(j) in §55c). Note the omission of the final j is normal for PT and O.K. spellings, cf. sq(j) \"pound, flat\", bn(j) \"become sweet\", dA(j) \"subdue\". Fourthly, CT VIII (PT 79-80, p. 25) definitely gives all the verbs in question as s.dmj \"attach\". The verb s.dm(j) probably was misunderstood in CT VII, 138j, for this M.K. variant of §54c gives sdm with {outlined eye} determinative: Asjr(t) N pn sdm n.k jrt Hr wDAt r Hr.k \"This Osiris N, outline Horus’s sound eye onto your face\", but the following passage uses s.dmj (with {papyrus scroll} det.), 138k: Asjr(t) N pn s.dmj n.k jrt Hr r Hr.k \"This Osiris N, attach Horus’s eye to your face\". There is another word-play in the passage: between wDAt \"sound\" and wAD \"green eyepaint\" (§54d). W 54 (PT 81) §56a: rs.T m Htp rs tAjt m Htp rs tAjt(j)t m Htp Allen \"May you awake in peace! Awake, Ta’it, in peace! Awake, you of Ta’it-Town, in peace!\" Shmakov \"May you awake in peace! Awake, linen fabric, in peace! Awake, you of linen fabric (i. e. linen shroud), in peace!\" In Unis copy of the spell, the word tAjt has the {sheaf of flax}-M38/M178 sign as determinative, and in the copies of Neferkare and Neith (Nt 149-150) also tAjt(j)t has this determinative. So both words were undoubtedly considered as being made of linen fabric. We know for sure that tAjt is a \"linen fabric\": CT I, 254c: tAyt.s rxtt ptH sxtt tAyt Ds.s \"Its linen fabric which Ptah laundered, which Tait braided herself\" In the copy of Senusert-ankhu (Hayes, The Texts, col. 145-146), the sign {falcon on standard which stands on a sandal} (G7 + horizontal S33), a variant of G142/143, which is used to write the word jdmj/dmj \"linen\" (see §816b and Supplemental notes, notes on the signs, 13) follows tAjt, giving us the reading tAjt jdmj probably \"linen cloth\" or the like. The {village plan}-O49 sign which occurs alone or in combination with the {sheaf of flax}-M38/M178 at the end of the word tAjt in §737c4 (also §§1642, 1794a, Leclant, Pepi I, pl.2 A, col.20, pl.11, col.3), probably does not indicate that tAjt would be a toponym (*\"Weaving-town\"), but rather is secondary. For in several instances the sign seems to take the place of other determinatives; cf. the occurrence of the secondary {village plan} sign determinative in words like Htp \"offering\" (§897b M, probably the influence of sxt Htp, cf. §749d M), SsAt \"night\" (Nt 4 = §1761d), swHt \"egg\" (§714b), and in mnH \"lying\" (Jéquier, Pepi II, pl.14, col. +74). The O49-sign also appears in the names-epithets of the deities mAa Hr Tryt \"Pilot covered in gore\" (CT VIII, 150b, T1L, TT240), sAH \"Orion\" (§1763c, spelled without O49 in Nt 807), jw.s aA.s \"She-Comes-(and)-She-Increases\" (see P 467, 8; CT VI, 247g, 283r, 284i), Htp.s xw.s \"She-Rests-(and)-   4 wnx.k m jrt Hrw jmjt tAjt \"get dressed in Horus’s eye which is a linen fabric\"."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31She-Defenses\" (CT IV, 256a, 260b (BqCb, B1P, B5C, BqCa)), nfrw.s \"Beauty-tree\"5 (CT III, 87b, 93g, cf. §1783b with the {tree}-M1 determinative) and jtnw.s \"jtnw-tree\" (CT II, 120a, CT III, 87c, 203b (B3L, here with the {tree} determinative), without O49 in ibid, 240a-241a), ggw.s \"Stare-tree\" (CT III, 90a), Hknw.s \"Jubilation-tree\" (CT III, 108b, without O49 in ibid, 130h (S1C), 138d) and in the epithet of Anubis, jmj wt \"who is in mummy-wrappings\" (cf. Urk.I:268:10 where it occurs without the sign O49 and has the {bandage}-V38 sign instead. In the M.K. mostly without O49), probably likewise as substitute for another sign. Cf. a similar use of the {mountain range}-N25 sign which occurs as the determinative for dangerous beings (§§236c, 245b, 851b N, 1639c N, see P 50). tAjt(j)t is the feminine nisbe of tAjt, literally \"she of linen fabric\" and seems to mean \"linen shroud\". Another indication for the meaning of tAjt and tAjt(j)t lies in their occurrence as objects of the collocations DbA m \"robe, clothe in\" and wnx m \"get dressed in\" in PT and CT: PT 71C, §*49n: [DbA.n sw Hrw <m> tA]j[t] \"[Horus has robed himself <in> linen] fa[bric]\" (James Allen himself reads tAjt in this passage as \"woven cloth\") PT 622, §1755a-b: DbA.n(.j) kw m jrt Hr rnnwt(j)t jtn nrt.n n.s nTrw \"I have robed you in Horus’s eye, this Nurterer of which the gods have become afraid\" PT 634D, §*1793f-g: hA pjpj [nfr-kA-ra DbA.n Tw] Hrw m tA[jt(j)t jmjt] tAjt DbA[.n.f jt(j)].f jm.s DbA[.n.f Asjr jm.s] \"Ho, Pepi [Neferkare]!

Horus’s eye in the Red-Crown enclosures, in peace!\" Shmakov \"(Awake,) Horus’s eye in Dep, in peace, Horus’s eye in the Watery Area’s enclosures (i. e. probably the marshes of Pe), in peace!\" Hwwt nt is probably \"Watery Area’s enclosures\", not \"Red-Crown enclosures\", as the word nt has the meaning \"spring, watery area\" (Wb.II:198:10, see also W 171, 2, W 192, especially P 467, 7, below). According to Allen it was the ancient area of Buto (i. e. Pe (p) and Dep (dp) together) (Allen, Medicine, p. 65) in the Delta, so probably marshy or watery area. The spelling n-t-{red crown} (due to \"Phonetic Influence\", see T 228, 10) was a variant of spellings that, from our point of view, look more correct: n-t-{three ripples of water}-N35a, {three ripples of water}-t (Hassan, Giza I, fig. 25, pl. 2:4, 34:6, 36:7), or only {three ripples of water} sign (which is still nt, not mw), and we may find these different spellings on the same monument, for example: 1) the mastaba of the dwarf Seneb: Hwwt nt (spelled Hwwt + {three ripples of water}, Junker, Giza V, Abb. 29A.) ~ Hwwt nt (spelled Hwwt + nt + {red crown}, Junker, Giza V, Abb. 4a ([n]t, p. 27), 29B. (n(t), p. 109)). 2) the mastaba of Mereruikai: Hwwt nt (Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 62, 76, 133, 207 (=208B), 210D, 211A, B, spelled Hwwt + n-t-{three ripples of water}; pl. 181 (=182), 183, spelled Hwwt + {three ripples of water}-t) ~ Hwwt nt (Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 113, 159, 179 (=182), spelled Hwwt + nt + {red crown}). In the mastaba of Gemnikai it is spelled uniquely Hwwt + n-t-{white crown}-{red crown} (Bissing, Gem-ni-kai II, p. 18 and pl. 34, false door of room VII), but this does not negates what just has been said about the toponym. Firstly, because Mereruikai as a successor of Gemnikai in the office of vizier would have had the same titles, i. e. xrp Hwwt nt of Mereruikai (spelled with {three ripples of water}) ~ xrp Hwwt nt of Gemnikai (spelled with -{white crown}-{red crown}). Secondly, because the toponym is still spelled Hwwt nt, not *Hwwt dSrt HDt: although dSrt HDt could be spelled with ideograms, i. e. with the {white crown}-{red crown} signs like we have here, there would not be a nt before these signs like we have in the variant of Gemnikai. This means that the {white crown} sign in Gemnikai’s spelling of the toponym is either \"Determinative Influence\" (see T 203, 2) or just a space filler (to fill the free space on either side of the {red crown} sign), i. e. nothing more than ornamental. This title also occurs in similar lists of titles: sm xrp SnDwt xrp Hwwt nt \"sm-priest, manager of a kilt, manager of the Watery Area’s enclosures\" (Hassan, Giza I, p. 6, the mastaba of Raweri, (ra wr(.j) \"the Sun is great\")) ~ sm xrp SnDwt nbt xrp Hwwt nt (Bissing, Gem-ni-kai II, p. 18 and pl. 34, false door of room VII), the only difference being the title xrp SnDwt nbt \"manager of every kilt\". That is, the title in the mastaba of Rawer spelled Hwwt {three ripples of water}-t equals the title in the mastaba of Gemnikai spelled Hwwt n-t-{white crown}-{red crown}. See Jones, Titles, ## 2646-2648, for references to the title xrp Hwwt nt. Cf. CT VII, 189d where the word nt of the toponym is spelled n-{red crown}-{three ripples of water}: [...] r Hwwt nt wnm zwr m Hwwt n[t] \"[...] to the Watery Area’s enclosures, eating (and) drinking from the Wat[ery Area’s] enclosures\". Cf. CT III, 145f: tAH zSw Hwwt nt nbj jrt Hrw \"Flooded have been the nests of the Watery Area’s enclosures (and) the flame of Horus’s eye\" and CT VI, 196l: tAHy.j zS(w) Hwwt nt \"I flood the nests of the Watery Area’s enclosures\" – in these two passages we have zSw Hwwt nt \"nests of the Watery Area’s enclosures\", i. e. \"nests of marshes\" which does make sense, while \"nests of the Red-Crown"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34enclosures\" seems rather meaningless. Cf. Graefe, Stundenritual, 3th hour, P: xd.f xnt.f m Hwwt nt \"He will sail north and south in the Watery Area’s enclosures\" Though versions P and B give Hwwt nt \"Enclosures of Neith\", there is no doubt that this is a reinterpretation of an original \"Watery Area’s enclosures\" as is shown by the variant of Sch which gives {red crown inside the enclosure}. Finally, compare §1353c: Hwt Htmwt \"Enclosure of the Htmwt-canal\" (for this body of water, see W 212, 2), and CT III, 214c: Hwt ptrtj \"Enclosure of the dual looking waters\". 3) §57e: r HAt(.j) r HAt(.j) xr Asjr(t) Allen \"To the front! To the front, with Osiris!\" Shmakov \"“(Put) to my front, to my front” says Osiris\" This passage refers to the presentation of two linen stoles and putting them on Osiris. xr in the passage is parenthetic (Allen, M. E., 22.17-18), not a preposition \"to\", cf. Jones, Titles, 1542-50, p. 418-419: m Htp m Htp jn N \"“Welcome, welcome” says N\" m Htp m Htp xr N \"“Welcome, welcome” says N\" where N is a god or the personificated west (jmnt), cf. also CT I, 54j (B3Bo): m Htp m Htp xr ra jmj <X>n pt \"“Welcome, welcome” says Sun who is in the sky’s interior\". For r HAt(.j) \"to my front\", cf. §54a: jn(.j) n.k jrt Hrw...r HAt.k \"I have brought for you Horus’s eye...to your front\", in the current passage this expression is probably a \"non-verbal imperative\" (see P 318, 2). For another example of parenthetic, see also P 7, 1. W 59 (PT 86) §59d: s.Hm n.k s(j) xr.k Allen \"Cause it to revert to you\" Shmakov \"turn it to yourself\" s.Hm n.k s(j) xr.k is \"turn it to yourself\" (lit. \"cause it to turn towards you\") in the sense of \"turn towards, direct to you\", rather than \"revert it to yourself\" as former owner. Just like it does not have the meaning \"cause to revert\" in PT 356, §576a: s.Hm.n.f jb n stS \"He has turned (away) the heart of Seth\" and PT 357, §587c: s.Hm.n n.k sw Hrw \"Horus has turned him (away) from (n) you\". W 61 (PT 88) §60b: jrt Hrw xw nkt.f s(j) Allen \"Horus’s eye: prevent him from trampling it\" Shmakov \"Horus’s eye, keep him from injuring (?) it\" James Allen seems to read here an imperative construction xw n.k t(j).f \"keep for yourself him from trampling\", probably presuming a verb t (N: tj) that would be analogue to the verb tjt \"trample\" that occurs in §73a, a presumption only based on the use of these verbs in both texts to make a word-play with the word t wt \"emmer bread\" (§§60b, 73b). However, rather than presuming an obsolete verb t(j), the present author supposes that there’s rather a verb nkt/nktj in the current passage, that probably derives from the verb nkn \"be injured, be harmed\" which sometimes is spelled just nk(n). Cp. nkt \"injury\", nknkt ~ nkkt \"the injured one (specifically referring to the damaged Eye)\" (HWB 437-438 )."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 2) §60b: t wt Allen \"1 loaf of “trampled” bread\" Shmakov \"one loaf of emmer bread\" In the mastaba of Kai (Junker, Giza III, Abb.17, p. 135) and Khufukhaf (xw.f-w(j)-xa.f \"Khufu shines forth\", Simpson, Kawab, Khafkhufu I and II, fig. 32) this bread has a {ear of emmer}-M34 sign as determinative, thus rather than a hypothetical *t tw \"tw-bread, “trampled” bread\", we probably must read t wt \"a type of emmer bread\". In any case, the nature of word-plays (see W 53) makes it unlikely that the bread’s name straightforwardly contains the mentioned verb (the same applies to the following section). W 62 (PT 89) §60c: jrt Hrw jtHt.n.f / t rtH(t) Allen \"Horus’s eye, which he pulled out. 1 bowl of “pulled” bread\" Shmakov \"Horus’s eye, which he pulled out. 1 bowl of baker’s bread\" The word-play in the passage is no doubt between the relative form jtHt \"which he pulled out\" and the noun rtHt \"baker\" (a case of /j/ ~ /r/, see W 166, 1, i). For the office rtH(tj) \"baker\", see Jones, Titles, # 1848. For the t rtH(t) \"baker’s bread\" spelled in full t rtHt, see Hassan, Giza I, fig. 136, p. 77; Kanawati-Raziq, Hesi, pl. 64a. A similar word-play appears in PT 124, where there is no sound word-play, but there is a word-play between t ASr \"roasted bread\" and jtHt \"which he pulled out\", which hints at rtHt.n.f \"which he baked\". The same reading is for PT 112 (W 74). W 64 (PT 91) §61b: jrt Hrw j.xmxt.n.sn r.f Allen \"Horus’s eye, which they diverted from him\" Shmakov \"Horus’s eye, which they (i. e. gods) know less than him (i. e. Horus) (lit. of which they are ignorant against (i. e. more than) him)\" James Allen translates the double of the passage (PT 147, §89c) differently: \"Horus’s eye, which they enjoyed against him\". The verb form is surely written with graphic transposition and is not to be read as jxxmt, but rather as j.xmxt. We have here a prefixed partially reduplicated 2-lit. verb xm \"not to know, loose knowledge of, forget, negate\" (thus 3-lit. verb, the root pattern ABA6, absent in Allen, M. E., 13.5.3); Allen states the same except for the verb’s origin in Allen, Inflection, §743, p. 583: \"the word...jxxm...is an improbable root pattern, and is possibly calligraphic for j.xmx: that is, prefixed form of the otherwise unattested simplex of causative sxmx(j)\". The causative 3-lit. verb s.xmx that occurs in the expression s.xmx jb \"entertainment, amusement\" (very common, for example §1189b) has probably no difference in meaning from the causative 2-lit. verb s.xm, both having the meaning \"forget, cause to loose knowledge of, cause to forget\". That we have graphic transposition in the current passage and in §89c is further supported by the spelling of the expression s.xmx jb in the N.K. tomb of Nakht where it is twice spelled s.mxx jb (Theban tomb TT52, the transverse chamber, west wall, north side, upper register, see the tempera on paper, MMA 15.5.19e) and by the usual spelling of the verb s.xm, which is s.mx7 (§2118a), i. e. with the same pattern of optimal space use as in the present passage. Moreover, the {stretched arms as a   6 Another verb that has such a root pattern is nxn \"grow up\", see T 248, 2. 7 This graphical transposition was made according to the rule \"a bird sign better fits in the second position\", see Supplemental notes, notes on the signs, 17. The same transposition occurs in the word sxm \"have control\", which sometimes is spelled smx (s-{scepter}-m-x) in the BD, e.g. BD68:5, 82:5 and in hmhmt \"cry\" which once is spelled mhmh[t] (Sethy I, Abydos I, pl.40, o)."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36gesture of negation}-D35 sign between x and m in the spelling of j.xmxt of §89c W shows that both verb forms (j.xmx and s.xmx) are no doubt the derivatives of the 2-lit verb xm (of which D35 is a characteristic feature). Non-prefixed xmx spelled xxm occurs in Nt 13 (ancestor of CT II, 148c): xmx.n nt S(A)b n nb xmnw \"Neith has negated crookedness for the Lord of the Ogdoad\". Finally, in the Middle Kingdom variant of the spells PT 91, §147, namely CT VII, 142d, the verb xm occurs: mj n.k jrt Hrw xmt.n.s(n) r.f xnms n.k s(j) \"Take Horus’s eye which they know less than him, make friends with it\". The full reduplication of the verb xm occurs in CT V, 32g-h (B2L, B2P): nj xmxm Sw jn Ddw TAz pXr \"Shu has not been forgot by Busiris and vice-versa\" (B1C has xmxw, so a partial reduplication just like j.xmx in the PT passage under discussion). The same phenomenon occurs in the causative verb form s.xdx (also with transposition, written s.xxd in the original, CT I, 281b (T1C)), which is formed through the half reduplication of the simplex xd (§685a) \"overturn, become upside down, hang, dangle\", more often in the full reduplicated form s.xdxd. Thus the meaning of xmx is ~ xm, and s.xmx jb \"entertain, amuse\" would literally mean \"cause a heart to forget\", \"cause a heart to become oblivious\", in the sense of \"mental distraction\". It seems that s.xmx alone can have a similar meaning to s.xmx jb. For in Junker, Giza VII, we may find the title (j)m(j)-r s.xmx \"head of recreation\" (Abb. 12, p. 33), so written without jb, and see CT VII, 222d: s.xmx nTr jn nTr which probably means \"the god has been entertained by the god\" (for \"the god has been forgotten/ignored by the god\" would be rather meaningless). For .sn \"they\" referring to the gods, cf. the New Kingdom variant of the spell PT 152 (§91c) in the temple of Sethy I at Abydos (II, pl.32, 35, col. 15, bottom): PT: mnD n Hr dAp sn \"Horus’s breast that fed them\" The temple: mnDwj n Hr drp.n.f nTrw jm \"Horus’s two breasts with which he has fed the gods\" 2) §61b: xnms Allen \"one jug of ale\" Shmakov \"one jug of “Friend” (beer)\" It is possible that xnms is not the designation of a kind of beer/ale itself, but rather the name of some kind of ale or beer, a beer called \"Friend\". For the sign xnms-{man with scepter}/{man with scepter and crook}-A11 is often used as a determinative for xnms-beer, and the beer’s name is also spelled with only the A11 as ideogram (Murray, Saq. Mas., pl. 18, 21, 23, 29, 30; Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 126, Mariette, Mast., D39, p.274). Moreover, in the offering lists this drink is often written H(n)qt xnms \"“Friend” beer\", not just xnms, so we probably have the same phenomenon as with the names of oils, for example sT(j) HAb (mrHt) \"“Festival Scent” (oil)\". W 66 (PT 93) §62c: mA.k n prt jm.k H.s sxt jm Allen \"look at what has come from you, striking the one who is netted in it\" Shmakov \"look at that which has come from you, it will strike woven (?) from (it)\" The unclear word sxt of this passage may occur in PT 283, §424a, see W 189. 2) §63b: Dwj.k kA.k Asjr(t) js xw.f kw m-a Dnd nb nj m(w)t Allen \"You shall summon your ka—namely, Osiris—and he shall defend you from every wrath of the dead\""},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37Shmakov \"You shall summon your ka being Osiris (and) he shall defend you from any raging one of the dead\" Asjr(t) js has, as elsewhere, the meaning \"being Osiris, as Osiris\", not \"namely, Osiris\". W 67-68 (PT 94-95) §64b: Asjr(t) Wnjs m(j) n.k jrt Hrw nSbSbt.n.k Hr.s / Sbw Allen \"Osiris Unis, accept Horus’s eye, on account of which you have burst forth / The meal\" Shmakov \"Osiris Unis, accept Horus’s eye, at which (sight) you have salivated / The meal\" The sense of the passage is \"Horus’s eye, at which your mouth has watered\", \"Horus’s eye, over which you have drooled\". Neith’s copy (Nt 190) has m(j) n.k jrt Hrw nSbSbt.n stS Hr.s \"accept Horus’s eye, at which (sight) Seth has salivated\". The verb nSbSb in the passage is not to be taken as a derivative of the root Sb which occurs in the verb wSb \"feed, eat\", as wSb is not used with the governing preposition Hr (its governing preposition is m, wSb m \"feed on\", see §§117a, 394b, 803b, 805d, 1717c, 1722b also P 334). The verb nSbSb is probably a variant spelling of the verb nSfSf \"shed, drool\" (§1788b, N 74, a case of /b/ ~ /f/, see W 81), with the root nSf which also occurs in the word nSf \"saliva\" (§230a, W 5). These words also share the root nS/nX which occurs in the verb nS/nX \"spit\" (Wb.II:318:14; §§686b (see T 265, 3), 1270b, 1965a) and the noun nXw \"venom (lit. spit)\" (Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 9, col. 39). This root also appears as a fully reduplicated form nSnS \"spit out\" (§205a), and probably in nSz \"drop\" (§§426a, 1569b) and (as partial reduplication) in nSnj \"tempest, rainstorm, rage; to rage\" (if we may interprete the word for tempest as \"spitting of the sky)\" and the word for rage as \"to foam at the mouth, to spit of anger\", cf. the {spitting Seth-animal} determinative for these words in CT IV, 396b, CT VI, 253m, 254p and {Seth-animal with spittle atop him} in §326d — all rather similar to the sign {mouth with spittle}-D154 with which nS/nX/nSnS/nSf is determined). This root also occurs in the word nXnw \"mouth-watering food\", probably literally \"that which makes a mouth water\", \"that over which one drools\": CT IV, 47a-b (B2L): jw wnm.n.j zSt jw mtr n.j nX[n]w m Hwt nTr nt Hwt-Hrw \"I have eaten zSt-ration, proclaimed has been for me a mouth-watering food (nXnw) in the temple of Hathor\" CT VI, 284n: anx N pn m zSwt nXnw anxt Hwt-Hrw jm Hna Hrw.s \"This N lives on a zSt-rations (and) a mouth-watering food (nXnw) on which Hathor lives with her Horus\" CT VI, 334q-335a: wnm.j m wab...aq.sn r Xt.j tn m Sbw ra m nSfwt pw Hwt-Hrw \"I eat of clean water...which (lit. it) enters my belly as food of the Sun, as this mouth-watering food (nSfwt) of Hathor\" CT VI, 137f: wnm.j sStAw sdb.j nSnw m Smsw n Hwt-Hrw \"I will eat sStAw, I will sip mouth-watering food (being) in retinue of Hathor\" (cf. also ibid, 137i, 138e, 141b) CT VI, 383f-g: Szp.j zXt wnm.j <n>Snw Awwt.j jpn \"I will receive a zSt-ration, I will eat mouth-watering food – these are my rations\" CT VI, 341g: wnm.j m <n>Snw anxw \"I will eat of reviving mouth-watering food\""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 In the PT spell under discussion, the phoneme b is used instead of the usual f to make a word-play between the verb nSbSb \"shed, salivate, dribble\" and the noun Sbw \"meal\".

The feminine genitive nt is often omitted, for example In HAt(j)t (nt) aS \"the best cedar oil\" (§53b). In that example, HAt(j)t \"best\" (lit. \"that of the front\") is a feminine nisbe, as mrHt \"oil\" is feminine, and likewise swt(j)t is a feminine nisbe as jrt is feminine. Cf. a comparable but different solution in TLA, lemma-no 129670, \"voller Ersatz für das Horusauge (?)\". The same reading is valid for PT 129 (W 91). W 76 (PT 114) §74a: jn.n(.j) n.k nHrw(j) Hr.k Allen \"I have gotten for you those that resemble your face\" Shmakov \"I have brought you the two ones that elate your face\" nHrw(j) \"be upcast\" is probably the antonym of the verb nxrxr (~ nXrXr) \"be downcast\" in the expression m nxrxrw Hr.k \"don’t let your face be downcast\" (just like the preposition Hr \"upper\" is the antonym of the preposition Xr \"lower\"). Thus we literally have \"the two ones that make your face be upcast (i. e. elated)\". nHrw(j) is probably a dual participle as two nHr-breads are presented. W 78 (PT 116) §74e: xw pAz.f Hr.s Allen \"prevent him from feeling pain from it\" Shmakov \"keep him from turning upside down on it\" The verb is pAz ~ pnz \"overturn, turn upside down\" (a case of the allophones /A/ ~ /n/ ~ /l/), which is well-known as it occurs in the expression pnz tp/DADA.f \"overturn his (i. e. the bull’s) head\" – the command uttered by one of the butchers who is going to cut the bull’s throat on the walls of the Old Kingdom mastabas (also as a description pnz tp/DADA jwA \"overturning the bull’s head\", see Montet, Scènes, p. 163-164; Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 54; Junker, Giza VII, Abb. 87, p. 211, 219). There is a word-play in the passage between the verb pAz and the noun pzn \"flat bread\" (§74f, i. e. one more case of /A/ ~ /n/).

W 79 (PT 117) §75b: S(n)s Allen \"Sns-bread\" Shmakov \"(bread) loaf\" "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40The beginning of the common formula xA t xA H(n)qt xA Ss xA mnxt \"thousand of bread, thousand of beer, thousand of alabaster vases (with ointments), thousand of clothes\" which often occurs under the offering tables scenes in the O.K. private tombs was probably not xA t xA H(n)qt, but rather (at least originally or alternatively) xA Sns xA Dwjw – \"thousand of loaves, thousand of jars\". The sign {bread loaf} taken as t \"bread\", and the sign {jar} taken as H(n)qt \"beer\" could have other meanings. Cf. the following components of the offering list of Dynasty V (e.g., L.D.II:67-70): Sns 1 Dwjw 1 (n) jaw-r \"One (bread) loaf, one (beer) jar (for) breakfast (lit. washing of the mouth)\" (in Unis’ and Neferkare’s pyramids (§72f) briefly written jaw-r {bread loaf}-{jar}) Sns 1 Dwjw 1 (n) Sbw \"One (bread) loaf, one (beer) jar (for) lunch (lit. meal)\" (in Unis’ pyramid (§64a) briefly written Sbw {bread loaf}-{jar}, Neferkare’s version gives Sns {bread loaf} H(n)qt Dwjw (this is more probable than H(n)qt plus {jar} sign as the determinative), i. e. \"a loaf, beer, one jar\") Sns 1Hnt 1 (n) fAt \"One (bread) loaf, one (beer) cup (for) presentation (lit. lifting)\" (in Unis’ pyramid (§61c) briefly written fAt {bread loaf}-{cup}, Neferkare’s version gives t Sns (this is more probable than t plus {bread loaf} sign as the determinative) H(n)t, i. e. \"bread, one loaf, (beer), a cup\") Brief spellings (just {bread loaf} sign, just {jar} sign) and full spellings (Sns plus {bread loaf} sign, Dwjw plus {jar} sign) prove that the {bread loaf} sign was actually Sns \"loaf (of triangle form)\" and not t \"bread\", i. e. Sns as type of bread did not exist, and that {jar} sign was actually Dwjw \"jar\" and not H(n)qt \"beer\". Moreover, note that the rest of the formula is xA Ss xA mnxt \"thousand of alabaster vases (with ointments), thousand of clothes\", i. e. we have containers (vases), rather than their contents (ointments mDt), and general designations (clothes mnxt), rather than specific varieties (for ex. jaA \"kilts\"). This all means that the signs {bread loaf}, {jar}, which we read in the formula as xA t xA H(n)qt, is rather (at least originally) to be read as xA Sns xA Dwjw – \"thousand of loaves, thousand of jars\". Even when it is spelled xA t {bread loaf} xA {jar} it is rather xA t Sns xA Dwjw \"thousand of bread, loav(es), thousand of (beer), jar(s)\". Note also, that the {bread loaf} sign hardly should always be Sns, it could be pAD \"loaf\" as well; likewise, {jar} sign could be ds \"jar\" instead of Dwjw. Cf. Sns written in parallel to ds and Dwjw: jw dj.tw n.f Sns dsj \"he will be given a loaf (of bread), a jar (of beer)\" (Budge, BD99:38, BD125B:51-52), anx.tw...m Sns Dwjw \"one lives on...a (bread) loaf, a beer jug\" (Budge, BD149, I:2) vs t H(n)qt: jmj dj.tw n.f t Hnq<t> \"Let he be given bread, beer\" (Budge, BD30B, V:3). However, sometimes the spelling t-{bread loaf} occurs in the formula (e.g., Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 126; Duell, Mereruikai, pl.113) which probably nothing but an alternative to Sns-{bread loaf}.

This is suggested by the fact that the same construction (imperative plus subjunctive) with the verb mz occurs in §645c: s.ja kw n Hr j.mz.k jr.f \"Elevate yourself to Horus that you may come near to him\". Moreover, there is a word-play in the passage between j.mz \"come near\" and mzt \"liver\" (§82d). "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44That the sign G39 {pintail duck} which occurs in the verb mz (§§44a, 85c, 645с T) has a phonetic value of mz (as well as zA) is shown by the offering-list from the Idu mastaba at Giza, and the Hemra mastaba at Saqqara, where the offering \"she-duck\" is spelled mzt (Simpson, Qar and Idu, fig. 41 (= Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 85:88); Mariette, Mast., C15, p. 141; Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 13:16 (xw-w(j)-ptH), 29:29 (nfr-jrt.n.f), 69:72 (n-k(A)w-ra), 94:93 (jHjj), 111:113 (pnw), 120:119 (s.bAqw I)), instead of the usual spelling zt. This means that the sometimes suggested transliteration mzA for the verb mz, as an attempt to explain the phenomenon of the sign {duck} occurring in the verb in the PT, is mistaken. In addition, in the Middle Kingdom the verb occurs in an imperative form with a prefix j. (j.mz \"bring!\") which is used in the M.K. exclusively with 2-lit. verbs. This conclusion on the presence of the zA-sign in this verb is different from the solution suggested by Edel (Edel, Altag. Gr., §43) and accepted by Allen (Allen, Inflection, §728, p. 545). It is hard to tell apart the verb zA \"go\" spelled with the {duck}-sign (Wb.III:413:1) from the verb mz when there is no A complement; often verbs that look like zA \"go\" are probably mz, cf: PT 544, §1338b-c: j.z j.{duck}z.Tn Xr Asjr(t) N pn...fA sw \"Go, that you may come near under this Osiris N...lift him\" PT 648, §1829a-b: j.{duck}z.Tn Xr N fA.Tn sw \"You shall come near under N (and) lift him\" PT 648, §1829c-d: j.mz.sn jr.k fA.sn Tw \"they have come near to you, they have lifted you\" CT VI, 110g-h (B18C): mz kw Xr.f fA.Tn sw \"bring yourself under him, that you (all) may lift him\" CT VI, 115g (B18C): mj mz kw Xr Asjr(t) N pn \"come, bring yourself under this Osiris N\" j.{duck}zA.sn Xr.k which occurs in PT 368, §637c T is likely a variant of j.mz.sn Xr.k, as P, M, and N probably give j.mz (namely j.{duck}z), not j.zA, which is also used with jr \"to\" as a governing preposition. Cf. also the word-play in PT 138 between the verb mz (§85c) and the noun (m)zt \"she-duck\" (§85d). W 98 (PT 136) §84c: mj n.k tpw stS (j)m(j)w-xt srj(w) Allen \"accept the severed heads of Seth’s followers\" Shmakov \"accept the goose heads of Seth’s followers\" srj (written without any determinative) at the end of the passage is likely a nisbe-adjective of the noun \"sr-goose\" (§1224b, where it has a {goose} determinative); j is either nisbe ending or a combined spelling where r ~ j, i. e. sr + sj = srj. It has been placed at the end of the sentence, though should be placed after tpw, for this cf. P 324, 2. In the New Kingdom copy of the pressent PT passage in the temple of Sethy I at Abydos the relevant word is spelled sr(j)w with a {goose} determinative, i. e. \"goose (heads)\" (Sethy I, Abydos II, pl.32, 35, col. 12, bottom).

This phenomenon, which sometimes can cause misreading, was called by the present author \"Phonetic Influence\", see T 228, 10. Note that Drb is not the only word that uses the jb-{heart} as phonetic sign: it was also used to write the words H(j)b \"stepladder\" (§542b P), jbH \"tooth\" (Wb.I:64:2, spelled jb-H-{tusk}) and mnjb (Wb’s mjnb) \"axe\" (Wb.II:44:7, Gardiner, E.G., Sign List, T7, p. 511)). For a case of probably dialectal /j/ ~ /r/ (hence jb ~ rb), see W 166, 1, i. For /j/ ~ /r/ in the middle position, see T 271.

The verb is probably wnm \"eat\", cf. jmn(j) ~ wnm(j) \"right\" (§§601d PN/T, 1194b P/MN) (a case of allophonic mn ~ nm), and moreover, the verb wnm actually spells wn(m) in PT (cf. §35c W; also wn (M42 or E34) + {two halves of bread} as determinative), thus wn ~ mn (for /w/ ~ /m/, see W 67-68). That the verb has to do with the action of eating is suggested by the parallel in §92c: xw am.f s(j) \"keep him from swallowing it\" (see also §1450b, d).

Allen (Forwarded by Geoffrey Graham) of 27 Jun 1998 and 30 Jun 1998 on the nature of the phoneme /A/. W 108 (PT 146) §89a-b: Dsr(t) wAst(j)t Allen \"2 bowls of whipped cream\" Shmakov \"2 bowls of Theban strong ale\" The beverage presented while this spell is pronounced is Dsrt \"strong ale\" – the same beverage as is presented in the previous spell (PT 145, §88d) and spell PT 90, §61a. In the latter spell, James Allen (as well as many other Egyptologists) translates Dsrt as \"strong beer\", because in PT 90, §61a and standard offering-lists it precedes H(n)qt xnms \"“Friend” beer\" of PT 91, §61b, i. e. it must be some sort of beer/ale too. The only difference is that in §89a-b this Dsrt is specified by a nisbe of a toponym, namely wAst(j)t \"that of Thebes, Theban\" (feminine nisbe of wAst \"Thebes\", because Dsrt is feminine), i. e. we have \"Dsrt-beverage of Thebes\" (in PT was written with honorific transposition as wAst(j)t Dsrt). In offering lists of O.K. tombs it often appears as just wAst(j)t \"that of Thebes\". In some offering lists, cells with Dsrt and Dsrt wAst(j)t are combined, having the common element Dsrt (see Junker, Giza X, Abb. 53; Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 62:67, 78:84), just like in the case of combined cells with different sorts of wine having the common element jrp \"wine\" (see §92b T; Junker, Giza VIII,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47Abb. 56). That the {Seth animal-headed staff}-S40 or {Seth animal-headed staff with feather on standard}-S40a must be read here as wAs, not jAt, follows from Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, plates 13:14 (spelled {the staff}-s) and 86:91-92 (spelled {the staff on standard}-s-t-t), i. e. no doubt the spelling for (wA)st(j)t \"that of Thebes\". Moreover, the sign S40/S40a is very often spelled without one or more {crescent moon}-N11 signs on top of it, i. e. exactly like later spellings of wAst \"Thebes\" (the sign occurs with four {crescent moon}-N11 signs in §131d as the probable ideogram for jAt). It is also possible that in §131d Teti’s editor just changed Unis’s original wAst(jt) \"Theban goddess\" (occurs on Palermo Stone, Djer’s sixth year (PS r.II.8); Hassan, Giza V, p. 276: Hm nTr wAst(jt) \"priest of the Theban goddess\"; also a male divinity labeled with the sign S40 (wAst(j) \"Theban one\") occurs on one of the so-called \"triad of Mykerinos\" (JE 40678), Urk.I:159:6) to jAt-goddess, this means that the sign S40/S40a never had the phonetic value jAt, and actually still has the phonetic value wAs. There probably is a word-play in the spell between jw.sn (WT)/jw.n.sn (N) \"they have come\" and wAst(j)t (i. e. ’wns’ ~ wAs’’, a case of /n/ ~ /A/, see W 78, 1). On the block from mastaba of Izi (4th dynasty), Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, AEIN 896b-c (= Berlev, Stelae, p.31) wAst(j)t occurs with another nisbe of a toponym nbwt(j)t \"Ombite\" (feminine nisbe of nbwt \"Ombos\"): H(n)qt pr(w) HDt wAst(j)t nbwt(j)t \"beer, pr(w)-beer, white beverage, Theban (ale), Ombite (ale)\" (for pr(w) and HDt (white) beverages, see Junker, Giza III, Abb. 9a, 9b). W 113 (PT 151) §91b: H(n)qt sSr Dwjw 2 Allen \"2 bowls of Bowland beer\" Shmakov \"a sSr-bowl and Dwjw-jar of beer (lit. beer, sSr-bowl, Dwjw-jar, 2)\" Or \"two jars of sSr-beverage (?)\" In the passage the {bow}-T9A-vertical sign has the phonetic value sSr (not ztj, as in tA ztj \"*Bowland\"), cf. Wb.V:551:6-7 (Dwjw sSr), §443a: sSr \"to milk\" with a {bow} sign instead of the usual {arrow} sign, and the title jmj-r sSrt \"Overseer of the milk herd\" written with the {bow} sign (El-Sabbahy, JEA 79 (1993), p. 244 = Jones, Titles, # 871). The {bow} sign occurs in combination with the {arrow} sign in the Dwjw sSr of the mastaba of Kaipura (kA.j-pw-ra \"My ka is the Sun\", Mariette, Mast., D39, p. 273-74), and it also occurs in the mastaba of Kahif (Junker, Giza VI, Abb.33, p. 113) and on the coffin of Idu II (Junker, Giza VIII, Abb. 46, p. 103). The {jar} sign after the {bow} sign probably stands for Dwjw \"jar\", rather than being the determinative of sSr. H(n)qt sSr Dwjw occurs in the pyramid of Unis and his sucessors instead of the usual Dwjw sSr (Wb.IV:295:7-8); the word sSr probably means \"sSr-jar\". Two villages are named after these two vessels in the mastaba of Persen: Mariette, Mast., D45, p.300: sSr \"sSr-bowl\", Dwjw \"jug\" (transposed in the original as jwDw, cf. the village named after abS \"wine bowl\" and nmst \"jar\" in Hassan, Giza II, fig.137.1, mnzA \"mnzA-jar\" in Murray, Saq. Mas., pl. 10) These two vessels are separated in the offering lists of Nikainisut and Hemra: Junker, Giza II, p. 155, Abb. 21: Dw(jw) 2 sSr 2 \"two jugs, two sSr-bowls (of beer)\" Mariette, C15, p. 141: Dwjw sSrw(j) \"a jug, two sSr-bowls\" In the offering list of Seankhuiptah these vessels have different determinatives, Kanawati-Raziq, Seankhuiptah, pl. 72, 74: Dwjw {jug} sSr {double jar} The proper sequence in the offering lists is {drink/beverage}, {container}, for example H(n)qt nmst"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48\"beer, jug\" which is \"a jug of beer\", jrTt mr (§32a N) \"milk, jar\" which is \"a jar of milk\" etc., which means that Dwjw sSr could not be \"a jar of sSr-beverage\"9, only \"Dwjw sSr-jar of...\" and as we know from the current passage it probably was \"Dwjw sSr-jar of beer\". Another proof for the reading suggested is the fact that the determinative for this offering list’s item often was {double jar}, which resembles abS-{double jar} for wine. Such a {double jar} could be called Dwjw sSr, as opposed to a single jar (just Dwjw). W 114 (PT 152) §91c: mnD n Hrw dAp sn Allen \"the breast of Horus, which they made a gift of\" Shmakov \"Horus’s breast that fed them (i. e. gods)\" dAp is a participle \"that fed\", not a relative form *dAp.sn, cf. the New Kingdom variant of this spell, in the temple of Sethy I at Abydos (II, pl.32, 35, col. 15, bottom): mnDwj n Hr drp.n.f nTrw jm \"Horus’s two breasts from which he has fed the gods\" Though this variant uses a relative form drp.n.f, nTrw \"gods\" (~ sn of §91c) is still an object of the action, and not a subject. For the reading, cf. Urk.IV:415:7(= 1032:13): drp.t(w).f m mnDwj Hr \"He is fed from Horus’s two breasts\" PT 193, §110: mj n.k jrt Hrw dAp Tw jm \"Take Horus’s eye, feed yourself with it\" The word-play in this spell has been described in W 67-68 above. W 121 (PT 159) §95a: jrt Hrw xnft.n.f xnfw Allen \"Horus’s eye, which he carried off\" Shmakov \"Horus’s eye which he has snatched\" See W 81 for the relevant comments. W 125 (PT 163) §97b: zwt (nt) ag(w)t Allen \"roasted wheat\" Shmakov \"roasted patties of wheat\" The meaning \"dried/roasted grain\" for agt was established by Hermann Junker (Junker, Giza II, p. 171) on the basis of the {braizer with flame}-Q7 sign which once occurs as its determinative in the offering list (Junker, Giza II, p. 155, Abb. 21). As it turns out, Junker was absolutely right as we have enough cases of /g/ ~ /x/ (see M 52) to suggest that this word has the root ag/ax that also occurs in the words ax \"braizer\" (§§558a, 2118b), axwt \"burnings\" (§1961b) and s.ax \"roast, burn\" (§1485b: fst Drw.s j.s.axt jmjt.s \"who cooks her limits, who roasts that which is within her\"). In fact, we even have variant spellings of ag(w)t to support this:   9 However, in the fourth dynasty mastaba of Khafkhufu I it is written sSr Dwjw 2 which suggests the reading \"two jars of sSr-beverage\" (Simpson, Kawab, Khafkhufu I and II, fig.31)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49axwt/axt (Hassan, Giza II, fig. 142, p. 128/Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 31:28) axrt (Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 87:91-92, a variant of the spelling agjt (ibid, pl. 96:99) and agrt (ibid, 79:82), a case of probably dialectal /j/ ~ /r/, see W 166, 1, i) aSwt (~ axwt, Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 71:73, a case of /x/ ~ /S/, see W 88).

Moreover, there is a word-play in the spell PT 163: zxz.f and zt agt (i.e. zx ~ zg), jrt...zxz.f and jt agt (i.e. jt...x ~ jt’g). In §97d (jt ag(w)t), as well as in the O.K. offering lists, the feminine ag(w)t does not agree in gender with the masculine noun jt(j) \"barley\" (t is part of the root, not an ending, just like in jt(j) \"father\"; cf. jt(j) mHj \"the Delta barley\"), which means that ag(w)t is a separate plural noun, probably \"roasted patties/pies\", Moreover, cf. Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 87:88 (jdw): ag(w)t nt z(w)t/jt(j) \"roasted patties of (nt) wheat/barley\", the same occurs in CT VII, 126x-y and Meir II, pl. 8: agwt nt zwt agwt nt jt(j) (Meir has zw(t) and jt(j) mH(j) \"northern barley\"). Literally the current passage is \"wheat, roasted (things)\", i. e. \"roasted patties of wheat\", cf. CT III, 124b (S6C): s.(A)Srrt nt bdtj dSrt \"roasted (pies) of the red emmer\". The scene of \"making roasted patties (of) wheat (and) barley\" (jrt ag(w)t z(w)t jt(j)) remained in the M.K. tomb of Djehutihetep (El Bersheh I, pl.31). It is noteworthy that under the fourth dynasty there also was ag(w)t bdt \"roasted patties (of) emmer\" (Simpson, Kawab, Khafkhufu I and II, fig. 31, 32). The above means that Wb.I:235:5 \"Art Zubereitung des Getreides (Schrot)\" (the way of grain’s preparation (Crudely milled grain)), which can be translated as \"wheat/barley groats\", is incorrect.

The word bAt/bAbA(w)t probably means some way of preparing barley and emmer because it occurs written bAbAt jt(j) 2 bdt 2 \"two bowls of barley groats, two bowls of emmer groats\" (lit. \"groats: barley two bowls, emmer two bowls\") on the offering plate of Iimeri (Junker, Giza X, Abb. 53, after p. 144) and as bAbAt zt 2 bAbAwt jt(j) 2 \"two bowls of wheat groats, two bowls of barley groats\" in the offering lists of Sehemkai and Maakheruptah (Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 39:42 and 87:90).

They refer to bA.k \"your ba\" and both have m as governing preposition, literally \"your ba...making impression (bA) on (m) akhs, having control (sx(m)) of (m) his places\". The sign m has been omitted in sx(m) to avoid having twice m in a row (sxmjm, see P 450, 4). The same omission occurs in §§53a N, 145b, c, 204c W, 300c W, 620a M, 824a M, 837c M, 857c N, 903b N, 1300c N, 1621b, 1624a, 1626, 1824e, 2075b.

See also bA m in P 4, 3; P 45).   10 Allen reads this passage \"they will take you to the sky in your ba, you having become ba as one of them\" (Allen, P. T., p.105). However, the preposition m doesn’t have the meaning \"among\" (which is m-m), hence the feasible reading \"you having become ba among them\" is incorrect. Allen’s reading \"as one of them\" would be m wa jm.sn (§2085b) or mj wa jm.sn (Budge, BD169:26) in Egyptian.

The verb-preposition combinations with special idiomatic meanings (\"collocations\" as they are known in linguistics) have not received the same attention in Egyptology as they have in the study of other languages, because Egyptology was and is occupied with sentence-theory. Take for example the English collocation (verb + preposition in function of an adverb) \"live on\" as an expression of the stable diet that a living being eats. Here we can say \"The goats live on grass\" or \"He lives on bread\" to express that they eat this substance to stay alive, which is different from \"The goats live on the hill\" and \"he lives on the street\", as the preposition \"on\" in these sentences is not a part of a collocation, but a part of the prepositional phrase (cf. also \"A boy looked through the keyhole\" and \"A manager looked through the files\"). Such collocations also existed in Egyptian, and the preposition used in them changed the verb’s meaning just like a preposition in the function of an adverb does in English: anx \"live\"/ anx m \"live on\", prj m \"come out/in\" / prj r \"go up to, ascend to\" / prj Xr \"reveal, divulge (lit. emerge under)\", zXA \"write\"/ zXA m \"record, register (lit. write of)\", xpr \"evolve\"/ xpr m \"become (lit. evolve into)\", sDm \"hear\"/ sDm n \"listen to, take heed to, obey\", pXr \"go around\"/ pXr n \"serve\", zA(j) \"guard, detain, restrain\" / zA(j) n \"watch for\" zbj \"send, reach, spend\"/ zbj Hr \"stand up for, patronize\", aHA \"fight\"/ aHA Hr \"defend (lit. fight for)\"/ aHA xft \"attack, fight against\", Hmsj \"sit\"/ Hmsj Hr \"besiege\","},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52mdwj \"speak\"/ mdwj Hr \"advocate, stand up for, deputize for (lit. speak on behalf of)\"/ mdwj xft \"contest against\"/ mdwj m \"speak against, abuse\", Htp \"be pleased\"/ Htp m \"have enough of, be pleased with\". There also are collocations where a preposition doesn’t change the verb’s meaning, but these are still collocations as the choice of the preposition fully depends on the verb (just like in English in which we use a preposition on with the verb depend and a preposition at with the verb laugh, but not vise-versa). In Egyptian such collocations are: Intransitive: aq r/Hr \"enter\", aq Hr \"enter into presence\", spr r \"arrive at, attain to, reach\", zbj r \"arrive at, attain to, reach\", zmA r/m \"partake of (food)\" (CT III, 21c; Urk.IV:1011:3, 1165:15, 1167:13), njs r \"call to\", tSj r \"part from, come away from\", rwj r \"go away from, leave; go to\" (Urk.IV:114:2, 496:5; CT VI, 273f), Spt r \"be(come) angry with\", Dnd r \"be(come) mad at\", gwA r \"unmoor from\" (T 283, 2), Hrj r \"be far from\" (trans. s.Hrj r \"distance from\"), wA r \"be far from\", bjAj r \"move away from/to\", StA r \"hide from\", SAk / XAk jr \"object to\" (§1162a-b) bST (>bSt) Hr, sbj Hr \"rebel against (lit. on)\", swAj Hr \"pass by\", xpj Hr \"go by (a road), walk on (a road)\", Hmsj Hr/r \"sit on/to\", mAA / dgj n \"look at\".

However, it is important to realize that the existence of a collocation generally does not exclude the occasional use of the verb with the preposition in its usual sense (\"non-collocational uses\" as they are known in linguistics), for example: 1. collocational use of bA m \"impress, make an impression on\": see just above. 2. non-collocational use of bA m: PT 356, §579a: bA.k jm.s sxm.k jm.s \"You will become impressive through it (i. e.

The present author is thankful to Dr. Rune Nyord, of Cambrige University, who kindly discussed and helped to formulate the problem of collocations in Egyptian, and who advised on using the terms \"collocation\" and \"non-collocational use\". W 135 (PT 224) §218c: Hw kw wnjs jnn kw wnjs Allen \"Hey, you Unis! Turn about, you Unis!\" Shmakov \"Announce yourself, Unis, turn yourself, Unis!\" The first verb is in graphical transposition (cf. §218c MN, Nt 347 (Hw Tw)) and is an imperative of Hwj (Wb.III:44:3, Allen, Inflection, 549), the sense of \"announce (yourself)\" is \"make your presence known\". The notion behind \"turn\" is \"turn yourself toward me as I am speaking\", see also W 134 above. PT 628, §1786b: Hw kw pjpj nfr-kA-ra j.nn.k pjpj nfr-kA-ra jnk nbt \"Announce yourself, Pepi Neferkare (and) turn, Pepi Neferkare!

Tend your children and beware\" The verb in the passage is nS \"drool, spit\" with the {drops of liquid} determinative. For its meaning, see W 67-68. j.nD is probably an imperative \"tend (your children)!\", just like the following zA Tw \"beware!\", not a relative form \"the one whom (your children) tended\". Cf. another variant of this passage and spell in the pyramid of Neferkare (PT 225) which has (§224c): j.Sm smsw j.nD.f zA.f \"The elder has gone that he may tend his son\". Teti’s first copy has nDj, with the j-ending which sometimes occurs in imperative forms: j.nDj Asjr(t) pjpj pn \"tend this Osiris Pepi!\" (§1334a), DHwtj jabj pjpj \"Thoth, gather Pepi!\" (§830a), aHAj kAwj \"Fight, you two bulls!\" (?, §425e P).

T., P 281, p. 117, N 309, p. 263, N 524, p. 295, respectively). For the examples of 2S/P statives used as a wish or command are only with intransitive verbs or transitive verbs in non-transitive use. Moreover, it remains unclear what \"be dressed in a person\", or \"get dressed in a person\", would mean. For the meaning of Dt as \"person\" (not loose \"body\"), see W 175, 3. W 136 (PT 199) §115c: wDb Htp nTr Allen \"[Reversion] of the god’s offering\" Shmakov \"Distribution (lit. turning) of the god’s offering\" The noun wDb has the same meaning in this passage as in the Old Kingdom title Hr(j) wDb \"Who is in charge of distribution\" or s.HD pr Hr(j) wDb \"tutor of the department in charge of distribution\" (Jones, Titles, ## 293, 304, 488, 2212, 3407).

The CT VIII (p. 42) version rss with {foot with pot pouring water on it}-D60 as determinative does not prove the meaning \"cleanse\" for this word, but probably shows a Middle Kingdom reinterpretation of the original meaning. The expression wTz jb is probably synonymous to Tzj jb and has a meaning \"cheer up, take heart\", see CT I, 233f:, CT II, 34j:, Sin.

So st is not only baked food, i. e. not only bread, but includes beer. For this word, see also Borchardt, Neuserre, 123 Abb.103.a, Montet, Scènes, p. 248 (Spss ra). The word st undoubtedly derives from the root st \"pour out, put, shoot out\", as the verb st is used in other O.K. tombs in such \"Receiving bread and beer products\" scenes: James, Khentika, pl. 9 (bottom register): st nw r mnx \"pour/leave this properly\", jrt st m H(n)qt \"leaving beer\", jrt st m pzn \"leaving pzn-bread\", jrt <st m> HT(A) \"leaving HTA-bread\", jrt st <m> xt nfr(t) \"leaving good thing(s)\".

Kenzet (knzt) is probably \"the sky’s eastern horizon\" while Izeken (jzkn) is \"the sky’s western horizon\", just like bAXw is \"the earth’s eastern horizon\" and mAnw is \"the earth’s western horizon\" (after Allen, Medicine, cf. also Urk.IV:372:9: tAS jmntj r mAnw \"western boundary up to western horizon\"). Kenzet twice occurs on the east gable in the burial chamber of Unis’s pyramid, in §126b in connection with awakening, in §920c and §1254a Kenzet’s marsh and Kenzet’s canal or lake are the places where cleansing occurs – along with the Marsh of Reed (§920b and §1245b), the usual place for morning cleansing in the east. In §1541a Kenzet’s canal is the boundary of the east: \"You will cross the Curved canal (mr nxA), you will pass the Kenzet canal and fall in the eastern side of the sky\". Izeken as a western region is considered by Allen (“A portion of the western sky”, Glossary, p. 434) on the basis of its mention in §§496b, 497a in connection with the Evening bark. The toponym Kenzet (knzt) perhaps actually reads k(A)nzt, i.e. k(A)-n-z(mjj)t, \"Ka of the desert\". The abbreviated spelling k for the word kA is very common in the Old Kingdom inscriptions (mostly in names, but also in other words ending in A), and the word for z(my)t \"desert\" is always spelled zt in the Old Kingdom.

This part of the spell tells about the king interacting with symbols of food production or satisfaction, like mwt \"moisture (for food production)\" and nxbwt \"fertility (?)\"12, so Swst probably means \"abundance\" or the like.

The word wHa in the inscriptions above is spelled in graphical transposition as Hwa or Haw, just like the verb wHa \"release\" (§§2188a, 2189b), which is spelled Hwa (§1363b), according to the rule \"a bird sign better fits in the second position\", see Supplemental notes, notes on the signs, 17.

But even that can hardly be read as \"one with access to (lit. who enters) the (Sun’s) boat\", for it is written wjA aq, not aq wjA. On the inscribed fragment from the mastaba of Ankhimahor and on one of the walls (Kanawati-Hassan, Ankhmahor, pl. 42, 72, TNE95:F150) the bird sign used in the title (j)m(j)-r wHa Apd \"head of the bird-catcher(s)\" really resembles (and probably is) the aq-{cormorant}-G35 sign. Work teams (jzwt) and phyles (zAw) were named after the names of boat’s parts in ancient Egypt: jmj-wrt \"starboard\", tA wr \"larboard\", jmj-nfrt/nfrt ~ jmj nDst/nDst \"stern\", wADt \"prow\", even thought they did not deal with sailing. This is probably the reason of the occurrence of a {boat} determinative after jmj jrt nTr in §124e (a boat sign can undoubtedly be a determinative, cf. §1228b: jrt Xnm \"(the boat) that Khnum made\"). So, \"Sun’s Eye\" and \"God’s Eye\" are probably the names of working teams. See Roth, Phyles, p. 43: “The clearest connection between boats and phyles is a very rare title [zSA n zA dpt – T. S.], “boatman, scribe of a phyle” or “scribe of a boat phyle.””.

Agb means here probably \"abundance, plenty\" rather than \"flood\", as the latter would be meaningless in this context. That the word has the {three ripples of water}-N35a determinative does not speak against this, for that determinative also occurs in the collocation baHj m \"become satisfied with\", which is about being sated, not about flooding. Moreover, the verb Agby occurs in CT VII, 227q which is a descendant of discussed passage: Agby.j m sxt Htp \"I am being satisfied in the Marsh of Nourishment\". Note the text actually reads sxt Htpt \"Marsh of Nourishment\": the spelling in Unis’s copy is Htpt (cf. also §§284b, 289b W), not Ht(p) (cf. §133c).

Cf. Urk.IV:26:17: Hr HjH(j) Axt n ntjw-jm \"(I) am looking for something useful for those who have passed away\".

The verb ndfdf probably has a meaning that is similar to the verb nSfSf \"shed, drool\" (see W 67-68 and 135, 4, note the {drops of liquid} determinative in TMN), for the image conjured up in this passage is that of Horus’s eye oozing fluid as if drooling over the food which Foremost of Westerners brought. It is not clear what Allen had in mind with \"for it\" (r.f), but as the text has \"he\" (.f) it can refer only to the masculine Dnw-bush, and not to Horus’s eye (jrt) or to the bush (bAt) which both are feminine (though cf. W 24). Htpwt does not have the meaning \"offerings (for deceased)\", but rather it refers to \"nourishment, meal\" for the living as well as the gods and the deceased, as it occurs in an Old Kingdom title along with the word Df(A)w \"provisions\": (j)m(j)-r swt Htpwt DfAw \"head of the places of nourishment and provisions\" (Jones, Titles, ## 827, 922).

Cf. Murray, Saq. Mas., pl. 10 (village name): ptH Htp(.j) Htpt \"Ptahhetep’s nourishment\". Notice the use of a {papyrus scroll} determinative after food designations (Htpt, Awt) in the current passage and in §399c, 399d T, for unknown reasons. DfAw and Htpt are different terms (Allen translates them both as \"sustenance\") even though sometimes they are used side by side, see Urk.IV:245:2-4: rdj.n.n n.s...Htpt nbt xr.n Df(A) nb xr.n \"we have given her all nourishment we have, all provision we have\", ibid:223:13: Dj.n.(j) n.T Htpt nbt Df(A) nb \"I have given you all nourishment, all provision\".)\". Also cf. Kanawati-Raziq, Neferseshemre, pl. 58: s.xp(t) Htpt Df(A)w \"Bringing nourishment (and) provisions\". The current PT passage may be compared to PT 400, §695b (see T 276, 1), which is a variant of this passage: in the variant, a pair of Horuses at the fore of the cookhouses (Hrwj xnt(j)wj xntw) are called to feed Teti, hence the n of the current passage must be genitive n(jw) \"of\" and was used instead of nt probably because DfAw, which is masculine, comes first, though cp. the following passage where Htpt is treated as masculine: CT I, 109b: jw Htpwt.s DA.w Hr a.s \"Her nourishment (Htpt.s) are held out (DA.w) on her arm(s)\" Other sarcophagi give s.DA.y (T1Lb) and s.DA(.w). Cf. also CT IV, 113a: jnk jn Htpt DfAw n bjt(j) pw [jAq/HqA ?] jw n s(j)sr \"I am the one who brings nourishment (and) provision of this king, [ruler ?] of the Isle of Blazing\" The current PT passage probably does not have xnt(j) prw \"foremost of houses\", but rather xnt(j) xntjw, where xntjw is \"food workshops, cookhouses\" with {house}-signs as ideogram. Usually this word is being spelled xnt, but it is actually the nisbe of xnt \"front\" as it occurs spelled xntj in Jéquier, Pepi II, pl. 6, col. 709+19). That this word xnt(j) would have the meaning \"cookhouse\" rather than \"jar-stand\", that is, a workshop that is the source of prepared food, is suggested by the following examples: "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71A person labeled wdpw xnt(j) wr \"butler/cupbearer/cook of the great cookhouse\" often partakes in the ritual named s.nmt Ax \"feeding the akh\" (xnt wr has {house plan} sign as the determinative, Junker, Giza II, Abb. 15, p. 146, 16, p. 147) PT 573, §1482e: s.rwD.f DfA n xnt(j).f jr(j)w tA \"that he may make firm the (supply of) nourishment of (i. e. from) his cookhouse(s) that belong to the earth\" PT 665, Nt 759: jw s.rwD(.j) xnt(j).k t.k \"I have strengthen your cookhouse (and) your bread\" (Allen’s) N 466, Jéquier, Pepi II, pl. 13, col. +30 (restored with CT VI, 105b-c): [nHm.n(.j) msw.k m-a jA]kb s.rwD.n(.j) xnt(jw).k tp(j)w tA n Dt Dt \"[I have saved your children from mou]rning; I have strengthen your cookhouse(s) on the earth for the course of Dt-time (lit. of Dt-time’s ownership)\" CT I, 284a-b: jA N pn mH.n.j Snaw.k xsf.n(.j) xnt(j)w.k \"Oh, this N, I have filled your kitchens, I have promoted your cookhouses\" CT III, 68a: jnk DfA wr xnt(j)w \"I am the sustenance, great one of the cookhouses\" CT V, 100d-101b: xr nTrw pyw xnt(j)w xnt(j)w.sn gm.n.j sn rxt.sn afnwt.sn jw.sn Xr xfAt nTrw jr.sn n.k xfAt m xd pAd m xsfyt \"(led me) to the gods who reside in Pe at the fore of their cookhouses.

The same is true for the word aAbt, which is loosely translated as \"offerings\", but as James Allen noticed it actually has the meaning \"feast\" (i.e. hearty meal), for it also occurs as a food for the living: Urk.IV:86:5-6: dd TAw.f n Sms sw aAbt.f n mjDd mjTn.f \"who gives his air to the one who follows (i. e. serves) him (and) his feast to the adherent of his course\".

Seth’s) hurt: you cannot go (from life) because of his hurt”\" This passage consists of the two parts: the address to Atum and his response. nTr sb(A) is probably \"star-god\", \"a god, a star\". However the reading \"god of star(s)\" is also possible, firstly because it refers to Atum whose representation as a star is unknown, secondly, because CT VIII, §141a (T1NY) gives nTr sbAw \"god of stars\", and cf. §506a which deals with plural \"stars\" (seeing the pronoun .Tn) but employs the singular sHd \"star\" (see W 221, 1). mAn is a subjunctive that follows the imperative, hence the reading \"See me and you will see\", \"See me that you may see\"). Allen overlooked jt(j)w.sn \"their fathers\" in his translation. The passage jt(j)w.sn j.rxw r.sn j.xm sk should be read \"whose fathers, knowing their spell(s), (are) the Imperishable Stars\", because CT VIII, §141b-c (B4Bo, B6C, B19C) gives jt(j)w.sn j.rxw r.sn j.xm sk.k \"whose fathers, knowing their spell(s), (are) your Imperishable Stars\", which also bolsters the reading \"god of stars\" (Imperishable Stars are yours because you are their god). The spelling j.f in §145a is the defective spelling of jj.f \"his hurt\" as is shown by CT VIII, §145a (B6C). The word jj \"hurt\" occurs being spelled jjj in §142b and jj in §§143b, 391a, b, 426b (in the latter paragraphs with the {eye} determinative). The suffix .f \"his\" probably refers to Seth, for it cannot refer to mtwt \"seed\" which is a feminine noun. However, it seems that §145a had been reinterpreted or misunderstood in Neferkare’s copy (Jéquier, Pepi II, pl. VIII, col. 709+55) and in CT VIII (all but B6C): nj zj.k n.f \"you cannot go (from life) because of him\". 2) §142c-143a: ms.n.k pf jwr.n.k pn ms.k Hrw Allen \"That one has been born to you, this one has been conceived to you, for you have given birth to Horus\" Shmakov \"You have born that one, you have conceived this one: you gave birth to Horus\" Probably two sDm.n.f’s, rather than two passives. 3) §145b, c: nj jp.f jb.k nj sx(m).f m HAt(j).k Allen \"he will not claim your mind, he will not have control of your heart\" Shmakov \"he will not subordinate your mind, he will not have control of your heart\" For the meaning of jp as \"subordinate, subject, subjugate\", see T 145, 9; cf.

It is interesting to notice that Egyptian has a couple (or even a triplet) of designations for each body part or organ, cf. jb ~ HAtj \"heart\", Srt ~ fnD (>fnd) \"nose\", anxwj ~ msDrwj \"ears\", ns ~ SsAw \"tongue\", nHbt ~ wsrt ~ bant ~ xx ~ TAz \"neck\", mnt ~ wart \"thigh\" (see T 227), sA ~ psD (>psd) ~ jmAx \"back, spine\", znf ~ dSrw ~ Tr \"blood, gore\", HAt ~ wpt \"forehead, brow\", tp ~ DADA \"head\". The explanation of this phenomenon could be that Egyptian could have had different designations for the body parts and organs of animals and those of humans, and that in time the designations for the parts of animals came to be used for humans. That is, the difference between jb and HAtj would be that jb is the designation of a human heart, while HAtj is the heart of an animal, namely a bull (hence jb is \"mind\" as well as \"heart\", whereas HAtj is normally \"heart\" (as an organ)). Evidence for such a point of view may be found in the images of the cutting out of a bull’s heart (butchering scenes in private tombs of the Old Kingdom and later) that are inscribed with Sdt HAt(j) \"Extracting of the (bull’s) heart\" (e.g., PT §1286b; Moussa-Altenmüller, Niankhhnum, Tf. 86, 89; Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 13, 72, 138) and never *Sdt jb. Cf. also PT 477, §963a-b: Hsq.f HAtjw nw DAt.sn sn m pjpj nfr-kA-ra \"It (i. e. the knife) will cut out the (bulls’) hearts of those who will extend themselves against (lit. for) Pepi Neferkare\" and PT 372, §653a: stp.n Hr xpSw xftjw.k \"Horus has cut off the forelegs of your opponents\" – in both these passages with a butchering association, opponents are considered as having the shapes of bulls, hence in the first passage the word HAtj \"bull’s heart\" is used, and in the second xpS \"bull’s foreleg\". HAt(j) also occurs as \"bull’s heart\" among other body parts of a bull, such as xpS \"foreleg\" and psD \"back\", in §1547c where Seth in the form of a bull is butchered by Horus. The word DADA \"bull’s head\" occurs determined by the {bull’s head} sign and followed by xpS \"foreleg\" in TT 100 (Davies, Rekh-mi-Rē, pls. 92 - 93): rdjt DADA xpS r tA \"Putting of a bull’s head and foreleg to the ground\" (cf. Wb.V:530:7, where the word also has {bull’s head} determinative).

W 152, 1). mrw.f is actually a plural perfective relative form \"the ones whom he wishes/wished\", just like in the following passages: §§155d, 157d, 159c: mrw.f anx.f swt anx.f mrw.f m(w)t.f swt m(w)t.f \"the one whom he wishes to live will live; the one whom he wishes to die will die\". m(w)t.Tn of the passage is either infinitive, subjunctive or even a noun as object of mrw, \"you to die\", \"that you die\", \"your death\".

It is here proposed that the unknown word xwn (used for calves) is a variant spelling of xwrr since the Middle Kingdom, showing that the word was actually xwl (a case of /r/ ~ /n/ ~ /l/, see W 106): CT V, 317b: jw mAa.n.j xwnt mHt(j)t.j \"I have led my northern newborn she-calf (xwnt)\" (a similar expression occurs ibid, 318d) Urk.IV:1080:15: Hr spH tp xwnw r [jr]yt \"tying the head(s) of newborn calves (xwnw) for the stock-taking of cattle\" The occurrence of the {bird} or {duck} sign after xwrr in CT VIII (161a, 163a, 164c, e, 165b, 165d, 166b, d) on B6C, M5C and B10Cb (166b, d) does not advocate the meaning \"fledgling\" as it probably came about due to a misunderstanding of the {sparrow}-G37 (\"bad bird\") sign-determinative which occurs on B10Ca (164c, 165b, 166b) and which determines the meaning \"small, little, young\" (like it does in the word nDs \"little\"). Cf. the same {duck} sign instead of the {bad bird} sign in the word H.wrr \"youth\" (CT III, 78b, also geminated, though there is a non-geminated Hwr (Wb.III:55:5)) and H.aA \"youth\" (CT VI, 378h; both H.wr and H.aA are formed through the prefix H plus the root wr/aA). The {bad bird} sign also occurs as determinative of xwn in the following expression: Wb.III:247:16: jwtj xwn.f \"who has no trifle/littleness (lit. who his trifle/littleness is not)\". Harold Hays in his dissertation reads xwrr in this passage same as \"a *newborn\" (Hays, Structure, p.129, note 89). The word psDt of the current passage is not a variant spelling of the word \"Ennead\", but the reference to the nine arcs of the sky (see N 359, 3): PT 222, §202b: Dj.k jAq wnjs pn psDt Htm.f psDt \"that you may make this Unis rule the Nine (Arcs) (and) provide the Ennead\" CT VIII, 202b (L3Li, L1NY) give pd(w)t psDt \"nine arcs\" instead of psDt \"Nine\" in all other versions.

(second) Anyone who will speak bad of the name of Unis...\" mTnt.f is a participle of the verb mjTn (Wb.II:175:15), not of Tnw \"count, reckon\" as James Allen suggests, for Tnw is spelled in the PT with nw-{pot} and {papyrus scroll}-determinative (cf. §§179c, 1726c). Moreover, CT VIII, 161b (also B6Bo, p.107) clearly gives it as mjTn, as it is spelled with {throw-stick}-T14 + {pintail duck landing}-G41 and {papyrus scroll} signs; B10Cb even spells out a mj-arm. (Cf. also the spelling of the words that have the root mjTn, including mjTn \"way, path\" etc. in Wb.II:176:1-12 and mTn \"lead\" of §952a P which just like the current passage doesn’t have any determinative). For the meaning of the verb jp in this passage, see W 148, 3. The passage includes the noun rmn \"arm from shoulder to fingertips\", not the verb rmnj \"shoulder, support, stand beside/associate with (n)\". The second part may also begin with a sDmt.f participle: the remnant of Pepi I’s version of this passage has mTnt.f nb (Snt rmn [...]), probably \"Anyone who will hand over (?)\" (Leclant, Pepi I, pl.

The one whom you have made revive and live (i.e. Osiris) will live should this Unis live, will not die should this Unis not die, will not perish should this Unis not perish, will not awake should this Unis not awake, will awake should this Unis awake\" The passage is likely to have the subject-sDm.f (subject-imperfective ?) construction, where the subject is expressed with the realative construction Dj.n.k sDb.f anx.f,which rather begins a new clause than continues a previous clause (cf. W 150, 2 where the same construction is used). In this passage the original Osiris (or Osiris-archetype) and Osiris-Unis (or Osiris-hypostasis, though written just \"this"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79Unis\") seem to be present and the passage may state that the well-being of the god-archetype depends on the well-being of the hypostasis. The passage may belong to the type of extortioning spells, in which gods and the current world order are threatened to ensure the deceased’s survival or the realization of some other condition on behalf of a deceased (other spells of this type in PT are PT 254, §§277a-278a; 255, §§296b-299b; 310, §492a-492d). The \"should\" (or \"if\"), unexpressed in hieroglyphs, might be expressed through the intonation and by putting the clauses with .f in first place and with wnjs pn in second place. In this context nhp seems to be a verb with the meaning \"awake (from sleep or death)\", suggesting that the root is related to that in the noun nhpw \"morning\". For the verb occurs determined with {sun with two stroke under it}-N5a sign in CT VIII, PT 219, source B10Ca, and the same determinative is used with nhpw \"morning\". Cf. also the context of the following passage in which nhp is used with verbs expressing resurrection actions: CM JE 51733: Dd.Tn n.j...N sDb.k nhp.k anx.k x(p)r.k m wa m [xA]-bA.s \"You shall say to me:...N, you will revive, you will awake (nhp), you will live, you will become one of (the stars) of the Night Sky (lit.

The verb nhp \"awake\" probably should not be confused with the collocation nhp m-a \"get free of, escape from\", which likely has another root that is spelled alike (§§582b, 652a, 1817b, probably n-prefixed, because there is a variant spelling hp m-a (§§36a, 39a)). But the possibility for nhp m-a to have the same root does exist, for m nhp.f m-a.k could be read as \"don’t let him awake (in sense of \"rise\") from you\", which makes sense. 2) §186b-c: Asjr(t) pS(j) Hr.k mA.k n wnjs pn mtwt.k prt jm.k spdt Allen \"Osiris, turn your face and look at this Unis, your seed that came forth from you active\" Shmakov \"Osiris, turn your face and look at this Unis, your active (lit. sharp) seed that came forth from you\" James Allen treats spdt in the present passage as 3fs stative spd.t(j) which refers to the noun mtwt \"seed\": \"your seed that came forth from you, (it being) active\" (pers. comm. to the present author). However spdt seems to be an adjective rather than a stative. For such cases when a prepositional phrase (a participle with a prepositional phrase as in the present case or an address) precedes an adjective or a genitival adjective (B part in AB indirect genitival construction), see P 324, 2.

W 153 (PT 220) §194b: jw.n.f xr.T nzrt Allen \"he has come to you, Fiery One\" Shmakov \"He has come to you, Fulfiller\" Graphemes s and z are thoroughly distinguished in the Old Kingdom with only rare exceptions (Edel, Alta. Gr., §§116-117, for zAS and snS as rather different verbs, see T 284, for the divinity’s name sSAt as not having the root zSA, see just below). This means that the verbs spelled smn and zmn have absolutely different meanings, the first is \"establish, set, fix\" (caus. 2-lit), while the second is \"introduce\" (3-lit, see P 501, 1-2), and the same applies for zmA \"join\" and smA \"kill\", zmA \"lung\" and smA \"wild bull\", \"side/lock/scalp\", zwA \"sever\" and swA(j) \"pass\", zA \"son\", zA \"protection\" and sA \"back\", zAb \"jackal\", zAb \"to flute\" and sAb \"dappled\", zr/zj \"ram\" and sr \"judge\", swt \"shank\", swt \"value\" and zwt \"wheat\", sjn \"hurry, hasten\" and zjn \"rub\", Hz(j) \"favor, praise\" and Hs(j) \"clap hands and sing\", Hs \"excrement\". According to Allen, z sounded \"perhaps like English th as in think\" (Allen, M. E., 2.4). Whereas the divine name nzrt (§§194b, 196b, Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 2 B, col. 26 (= §194b), Nt 564 (= §194b), 567 (= §196b); Jones, Titles, # 3254 (smA nzrt)) and the shrine name pr-nzr/nz(j) (§852c = Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 3, col. 8; Urk.I:243:13; Hannig, ÄR, p. 453) are spelled in the Old Kingdom with z, the root nsr/ns(j) \"flame\" is consistently spelled with s (§§265b, 276b, 295c, 302a, 323d, 324c, 397c). Also in the Middle Kingdom and even New Kingdom inscriptions, nzrt and pr-nzr are still spelled with z, for example the relief fragment from the mortuary temple of Amenemhat I (MMA 09.180.114) which has pr nzr (other examples are CT V, 234c-235a, CT VI, 194n, CT VII, 163j, B.H.I, pl.7; for nzrt are CT I, 185g, 186a, CT IV, 260c-261c, CT VI, 322q, CT VII, 108k, 163j; nzr \"Fulfiller\" of CT V, 60c; N.K. inscriptions: Urk.IV:265:5, 1071:10, L.D.III:53). Therefore, the root nzr is different from the root nsr, and the {braizer with flame}-Q7 sign that occurs in pr-nzr since the New Kingdom must be a later reinterpretation owing to indistinguishability of s and z (Q7 in pr-nzr: Urk.IV:1071:10, Sethy I, Abydos III, pl. 43; Q7 in nsrt (! not nzrt) CT IV, 260c (B1P) 261c (M57C)). So in the O.K. and M.K, nzrt cannot mean \"Fiery One\", and pr-nzr cannot mean \"Flame-house\" (after Allen, P. T., Glossary, p. 429). The verb nzr occurs in §653d with the probable meaning \"fulfill\" (see T 203, 3), hence the present proposal to read nzrt as \"Fulfiller\" and pr-nzr as \"Fulfilling house\" – such a designation of the ancient shrine of the Delta may mean something like \"shrine answering (i. e. fulfilling) prayers\". The name of the goddess Seshat is also spelled with s (§616b), which means that her name has nothing to do with the root zSA \"write\", although in the New Kingdom she is clearly depicted as scribe-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81goddess. This again may indicate that, after the z and s were no longer distinguished, her name was reinterpreted, namely as \"she-scribe\".

Seeker, Searcher)\", of the root zx(j)n \"seek, search\", in which case the {reedfloat} sign would be merely an influence of zxn \"reedfloat\". Cf. zx(j)n \"seek, search\" of §38с, §575a, with secondary {reedfloat} determinative, and in §455a (W 206, 7) the name zxn wr is spelled without {reedfloat} sign.

The verb wbn is spelled with the sign {ingot of copper}, the Old Kingdom variant of the sign N34, which according to Gardiner “resembles [the sign – T. S.] X3” (Gardiner, E. G., Sign List, p. 490). It also resembles the signs {fig} (with which the word dAb \"figs\" is determined) according to the observations of the present author, see §§590с P, 1454b M.

PT 272, §392a, PT 360, §603a: qAjt nj dmm.s \"Height that will not be penetrated\" (after Allen), CT II, 198c-199a: xm rn.f xmm rn.f \"the one whose name is unknown (and) whose name will be/stay unknown\". 2) §277c: tA nj mdw.n.f gbb nj wA.n.f Allen \"The earth has no spokesman; Geb has no guard\" Shmakov \"The earth cannot speak; Geb cannot fight\" James Allen treats the passage as tA nj mdw n.f gbb nj wA n.f, \"Earth, there is no speaker for it; Geb, there is no guardian for him\", but in the PT, the earth does speak (mdw(j), §§796a, 1014a, 1713a, also Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 8, col.10: mdw tAw jA wr \"The lands shall speak great praise\"), has a mouth (§2169a: wp n.k r n tA mdw n.k gbb \"the mouth of the earth has been opened to you, Geb is speaking to you\"), and even introduces the king (zmjn, §1416b, see P 501, 1-2) in the PT, thus we probably have two sDm.n.f’s in the current passage. 3) §278b: sr Hnt Allen \"The pelican will prophesy\" Shmakov \"The she-pelican will proclaim\" The verb sr has the meaning \"prophesy, predict, proclaim, introduce\".

Cf. the expression sq(j) bnt or sq(j) m bnt \"play on the harp\". Probably the same word occurs in the CT, spelled with the two {ingot}-N32 signs, which then should be read as Dbwj rather than as Hmwj (cp. the word bDtj/Hmtj \"coppersmith\" which has that uncertainty in reading as well): CT I, 74f-g: Ast pw Hna nbt-Hwt {j}m sqr n.k Dbwj m-bAH nTrw \"This is Isis together with Nephthys as the beaters of the gongs for you before the gods\" CT I, 248b: sDm.f sqr n.f m Dbwj \"He hears a beating for him on the gongs\" The descendant of the latter half of the current passage, CT VI, 231r, has rdj bD{n}w (B3L) and rdj Db{n}w (B1L), instead of original sq(j) Db, with nw of bDnw/Dbnw as a result of misreading of {little circle} sign-determinative in the original.

Xnw is \"disturbance\": two sticks (or maces) as the determinative of the word probably express the idea of fighting, rather than of dual. The jmjwt of Teti’s copy is a plural nisbe (also not jm(j)wt(j) \"between\") as the word mHt wrt \"Great Marsh\" is actually plural (cf. its spelling with plural strokes in CT I, 311h (T1C), CT II, 120g, CT V, 212a, 214b, 215a, 217a, 218a, 219b, e etc.), just like any watery object or word in Egyptian. But even if one would assume that the interpretation of the phrase by James Allen is correct and it should be read as \"the two contestants\" (actually \"two disturbers\"), then it can refer only to Horus and Seth; however, we should not forget that these two gods were personifications of the king’s authority, and calling them \"two disturbers\" is not possible. Moreover, there is no dual ending w(j), Xnw of Unis’s copy and Xnnw of Teti’s copy are the usual spellings of the word \"disturbance\". The word mHt is the base in the Old Egyptian words-nisbes mHt(j)w \"fish\" (literally \"those of a marsh\") and mHt(j)w \"marsh-men\" (literally \"those of a marsh\", i. e. hunters and collectors in a marsh). Thus mHt wrt has the meaning \"Great marsh\" (not \"Great Immersion\") and refers to the sky as a big marshy area: Simpson, Mersyankh III, fig. 4: prt m SA Hna nHb(w)t jn mHt(jw).s jn.sn n.s xt nb(t) nfrt jnnt n Spst m kAt sxt \"Coming out of the marsh with lotus blossoms by her marsh-men.

Therefore, both copies of Unas and Teti probably have s.ja, and later, in the Coffin Texts, also s.ja ~ s.jar is used: CT I, 72c: s.(j)arw m(w)t.k stbnw jw.k Ddw n nTr jn sw hrw xbnt \"who bring your death closer, who detain your coming, who say to the god (about you) “The day of blame/guilt has reached him”\".

Cf. it also with another designation for \"blood\": Trw \"red liquid\" (§1263c, undoubtedly liquid as the plural participle prw \"that emerged\" follows it (any liquid is plural in Egyptian, see W 21, 1). In another spell (Allen’s P 540) James Allen himself reads dSrw as \"red blood\" (Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 22, col. 36).

There, just like in Unis’s copy of the present passage, the verb occurs with the {oval bread} sign (X4, X4a, X5) which has the phonetic value of zn. It also occurs with {oval bread} sign in CT I, 401c: s.z(j)n.n.j saHw.sn \"I have destroyed their dignity’sregalia\"; CT II, 252e: s.z(j)n.j jwt(j)w \"I destroy those who do not exist\"; CT IV, 18f: Ax s.z(j)n N pn \"akh whom this N destroys\" (B2Be), jw.f z(j)nn(.w) \"He has expired\" (BH2C); CT VI, 134h, i: [jwtj z(j)]n.n.f \"[who] cannot expire\" (M23C), nj xr.j sk.j nz(j)nzw.j m(w)t.j \"I will not fall, perish, expire, die\" (P.Gard.III), 267x: s.z(j)n.j jzft m DADAt \"I will destroy wrong in the tribunal\", in CT VII, 141i: nj z(j)n.k Xr.s \"You will not expire with it (i. e.

The use of the zn-{oval bread} or zjn-{pot} (§§617a, 637a, 1753a) signs with the verb is not indicative of its meaning as both signs have the phonetic value zn and are used with another zn-verbs: znj \"cut\" (§286b), zn \"open\" (§§1203c, 1361a, 1408a,c-1411a,c PM), znj \"pass\" (§1161a).

Moreover, the verb uses the jn-{pot}-W24 sign just like in jnk \"I, me\", jnj \"bring\", sjn \"run\" (§1462c), wbjn \"coccyx\" (§§547b, 1464b), zxjn \"seek\". Teti’s copy probably reads \"their heirs to paupers (SwAt(j)w, lit. to those of poverty), their houses to ruins (znznwt)\", rather than that the plural dots (behind SwAt, as well as behind znznt) would signal abstractions. Compare SwAt(j)w \"those of poverty\" in Teti’s copy with wASt(j)w \"those of estimation\" in §1296a.

The present author came to the understanding of jn sw as parenthetic \"says he\" (Allen, M. E., 22.17-18) independently from Samuel Mercer who also reads it \"so says he\" (Mercer, P.

It means that James Allen errs in his grammar about j.n.sn (“jnsn is probably the perfect j.n.sn” (Allen, M.

In Unis’s copy and in the copy of Senusert-ankhu (Hayes, The Texts, col. 403) it has {walking legs} determinative, from the verb z(j)z(j) \"catch\" (§§173a, 175a, 271a, 643с, 1285c; CT VI, 17f) as if it is a verbal noun \"catcher\", but this could be a case of \"Determinative Influence\" (see T 203, 2). However, in the CT IV, 46a-b z(j)z(j)w has {sky}-N1 determinative. CT IV, 46a-b: pr.n.j m wnwt wab.n.j m z(j)z(j)w \"I have gone forth into day-hours and become clean in z(j)z(j)w\" In the following passage it has {walking legs} determinative: CT VI, 120j-k: aq.n.j m z(j)z(j)w pr.n.j wab.kw \"I have entered z(j)z(j)w and emerged clean\" For the present author it is unclear how a man can become clean in a dustdevil. 2) §308c-d: Htm.f qd.f m Hwt.f tp tA sD qsw.f dr sDbw.f Allen \"He will end his sleep with his bones broken in his enclosure on earth, and remove his obstructions\" Shmakov \"He destroys his sleep in its (i. e. sleep’s) enclosure on the earth, its (i. e. sleep’s) bones have been broken, its (i. e. made by sleep) obstacles removed\" A very interesting conclusion of this passage is that euphemisms for death, namely \"sleep\" and \"laziness\", could be viewed or embodied as living beings made of flesh and blood and thus could be destroyed, i. e. Egyptians could embody even abstracts. Teti’s editor misunderstood all these \"its/his\" and took the bones and obstacles as Teti’s, not as Sleep’s.

Something similar occurs in PT 338, where Hqr \"hunger\" is being begged not to come to Teti and go to Nu and Inundation: the abstract \"hunger\" has to have at least legs for these actions, i. e. just like in the discussed passage be embodied in a being."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 Moreover, see this passage about keeping the death signs (\"sleep\" and \"lying\") away from the deceased: PT 247, §260a-b: jr wD(.j) msDD qdd s.bAgjj \"Do what I command, you who hate sleep (but) immobilized (lit. made to become slack)\" PT 412, §721d: bwt.f qdd msD.f bAgj \"he abominates sleep, he hates slackness\" (the same passage is §1500c) In this passage from the Coffin Texts sleep is used in parallel to death: CT III, 194j: mj <bwt> ra <pw> qdd <twr> jtmw m(w)t \"like the Sun(’s abomination is) sleep (and) Atum (bewares) of death\" (column is split in the original) 3) §308e: Drt(j) Asjr(t) Allen \"Osiris’s two kites\" Shmakov \"Osiris’s screecher (and) kite\" See W 5. 4) §309b: jw wnjs r pt jw wnjs r pt m TAw m TAw Allen \"“Unis is off to the sky, Unis is off to the sky, in the wind, in the wind”\" Shmakov \"“Unis is off to the sky, Unis is off to the sky, as the wind, as the wind”\" The passage probably has a \"m of predication\", rather than the preposition \"in\", cf.

CT III, 388a-b: Hms n.j kAw nwt m saH.j pw wr n nb kAw \"Sit for me, bulls of Nut, in this my great rank of lord of kas\" Three imperatives following each other: CT III, 387d-e (B1Bo): snD n N pn jd n.f ks n.f \"be afraid of this N, be quiet for him (lit. be deaf for him), bow down for him\" CT IV, 116d-f (= 120d-f, 123g-I, 128i-129b): mA wj jr.Tn my m Sms.j dy n.j jA \"See me, come in my following, give me praise\" CT V, 396i-k (S2C): my n.j m ksw sdA n.j snD n.j dy n.j jA \"Come to me bowing down, tremble for me, be afraid of me, give me praise\" Just like in Unis’s passage three imperatives begin with nominal object and continue with pronominal ones (wnjs...n.f...n.f and n N pn...n.f...n.f). The word Dnnwt(j)t probably derives from the verb Tnj \"distinguish\", thus literally \"She of distinction\", i. e. \"Distinct uraeus\" (a case of D ~ T) (cf. this name with the one of the snake-goddess Tnnt \"Distinct one\" (Wb.V:381:11)).

The word for \"(water-lily) bud\" in the Old Kingdom is nHbt, not nxb, which occurs only in the late New Kingdom (Wb.II:307:3). In the present passage we have a classical spelling of the city name nxb \"Nekheb\" with unknown function of the {pot}-W24 sign, which is probably nothing but a space-filler as the toponym is often spelled without this sign (cf. the spellings with the {pot} sign, §§910b P, 1107b (also in the spell-double, Leclant, Pepi I, pl.8, col.64), 1111b, Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 2 B, col. 44 (Allen’s T 206 ~ CT 517); outside the PT: Urk.I:98:8, 140:4, 8). The title nxb(j) Hr(j)-tp \"Chief Nekhbite\" is often written without a {village plan} sign (see Jones, Titles, # 2374) just like in the present passage. Thus in the passage we have nxb(j) n mwt.f \"the Nekhbite (Wb.II:309:6) of his mother\", which may be compared with nxb(j) Hr(j)-tp n (j)t(j).f \"Chief Nekhbite of his father\" (Jones, Titles, # 2375), jwnwj.k m wnjs ra \"your Heliopolitan is Unis, Sun\" (§482b) and pjpj Ds.f jwnw(j).k nTr \"Pepi himself is your Heliopolitan, god\" (§1507c). In support of such a reading CT VIII, 322b (p. 277) gives this word determined by the {village plan} sign and the {pot} sign also written out. For identification of the deceased with a flower (which is different from what we have in the discussed passage), cf. CT VI, 281s: N pn wnb wa n mwt.f \"This N is the unique flower of his mother\". The word nxbt that occurs in §§4a, 104, a, b (for the reading of these §§, see below and N 246-247), with what looks like a {rush}-M22 (Allen also reads it \"bud\"), is unlikely to be connected with the later word nxb mentioned above, for M22 always comes first with b complement following it when having the meaning nxb. It is more probable that nxbt of §4a has the same root as the divine name that occurs in §§1229c, 1451a, b and Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 9, col. 8, nxbt \"Nekhbet\" and the proper name nxbw \"Nekhbu\" (Urk.I:215:3), both with a {brazier with smoke rising}-Q7 or a {smoke}-Q7b sign and n-x-b complements spelled before it (nxbt divinity here is different from Nekhbet, titulary goddess of Upper Egypt, see Supplemental notes, Notes on gods’ names & epithets and on place names, 3). Nxb spelled this way and with this determinative also occurs in §123b (nxbwt), CT V, 260c (nxb, nxbt), CT VI, 246i (rw nxb.f). That is, in §4a we have a false plant sign that is actually the fire sign carved carelessly and we should read nxbt wrt of §4a as \"great lamp/lighter\" or \"great illuminating one\" (maybe even \"great candle\") – probably a reference to the starry sky at night (see Brovarski, Senedjemib, p. 32 “as a substantive nxbw appears to mean \"lamp\" or \"nocturnal illumination\"”, also ibid note 145). For Q7/Q7b carved as M22, cf. Jéquier, Pepi II, pl. 22, col. 1309+17 (= §1451a); Junker, Giza II, p. 166 and Abb.20 (p. 154), the determinative of fs \"cook\" (in fs wnxw \"cook Unekhu\"), see also references for fs in Jones, Titles, # 1541; Junker, Giza III, p. 129, Abb.14, the determinative of rkH \"lighting (festival)\"; Junker, Giza V, p. 97, Abb.26, second register from above, the determinative for the word ax \"braizer\" (not ax of the first register); L.D.II:28, the determinative of ax \"braizer\"; Block of Izi (I.1.b.322 (4050) = Berlev, Stelae, p. 29 (1:E)): the determinative of rkH \"lighting (festival)\" and"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115the word ax \"braizer\"; Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 4:3, ideogram (?) in t (A)S(r) \"roasted bread\", the determinative in ASrt \"roasted meat\".

For the term sxdw as a reference to the dead, cf. CT I, 188d: nHm.sn Tw m-a DnDn n mwtw Smw sxdy \"They will save you from any raging one of the dead who walk upside down\". W 171 (PT 261) §324d: Dr Swt a Hnbw m wnjs Allen \"when the lightning bolts’ arms have become empty of Unis\" Shmakov \"since the (sunlight) beams’ arm has become empty of Unis\" The word Hnbw probably doesn’t have the meaning \"lightning bolts\", instead the Wb. editors are probably right when they give the meaning of the word as “Bez. für die Strahlen der Sonne” (Wb.III:113:6). For we can pose the question \"Has the lightning bolts’ arm ever had Unis?\", which remains without answer, whereas a similar question in regards to solar beams can be answered without too much imagination: while he lived on earth, Unas could be said to be embraced by the Sun’s warmth, touched and nurtured by its beams. We could even refer to the known reliefs of Akhenaten on which beams (depicted as arms with hands) reach for the king and his family. We also do not have a word \"beams, rays\" in Old Egyptian, having only jAxw \"sunlight\", but we would certainly expect the word \"beams\" to be present in the language of this period like it is present in later stages of the language – stwt, mAwt. In §1212c, the Hnbw are surely of the Sun: bwn(wj).s Hnbw ra \"whose double prong is the Sun’s beams\", whereas \"the Sun’s lightning bolts\" would sound strange. Moreover, cf. Hnmmt which is supposed to be \"the Sunlight’s people (i. e. the Egyptians)\", written with the sign {sunlight}-N8 as the determinative and which could be connected with Hnbw \"sun’s rays\" via a root Hnm/Hnb (for /m/ ~ /b/ see M 365). 2) §325a-b: SAs wnjs Sw nmt.f Akr sn.f nt Allen \"Unis will traverse Shu, travel the horizon, and kiss the Red Crown\" Shmakov \"Unis will traverse Shu, travel the horizon, and kiss (i. e. reach) the Watery area (i. e. the sky)\" nt is not the \"red crown\", which is normally dSrt, but the word is rather \"Watery area\" (see P 467, 7), with the {red crown} sign being the influence from the word nt \"red crown\", just like the {white crown} sign influenced the adjective HDt \"white\" in §729a. For sn \"kiss (i. e. touch with lips or nose)\" as \"reach\", cf. PT 467, §891c: sn pjpj pn pt m bjk \"This Pepi will touch the sky (with the nose) as a falcon\", CT VI, 411i-j: sn.n.f sbAw nww spr.n.f sbA prt r pd \"He has reached (lit. kissed) the gates of Nu, he has arrived at the gate of ascending to the (sky’s) arc\". Compare also sAH \"touch with a toe\" and dmj \"touch\" which also have the meaning \"reach (a place)\". Moreover, \"brook\" absolutely fits the context \"Shu (i. e. air)...horizon...brook\", whereas \"Red Crown\" seems strange after Shu and horizon. Compare also: CT V, 272b-d: SAs.j Sw nmt.n.j Snjt war.n.j nwt \"I have traversed Shu, traveled the storm, ran (to) Nut\""},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116CT VI, 330i: SAs.n.j Sw nmt.n.j Snjt war(.j) pt \"I have traversed Shu, traveled the storm, ran (to) the sky\" CT VI, 140f-141a: Hfd.j Sw [n]mt.j Akr SAs.j Sw nmt.j jAxw SAs.j jAd pH.j jAd \"I have climbed Shu, traveled the horizon, traversed Shu, traveled the sunlight, ran (to) the climbing star, reached the climbing star\" (the last two phrases of this column are split in the original) CT VI, 341k-m: SAsw nmt.j Sn(j)t SAs.j jAd Hfd(.j) jAxw m Sms n Hwt-Hrw \"I will traverse (and) travel the storm, run (to) the climbing star (and) climb sunlight in the following of Hathor\" In all the passages just above, Shu (Sw), horizon (Akr), storm (Snjt), and sunlight (jAxw) are acting as obstacles before reaching the sky (pt, nwt, jAd). For Shu and horizon/horizons as obstacles, see §§658d-e, 2202c; CT II, 112e; CT VI, 46g, 95l-m. 3) §326c: jn.n.f jat n Hrt Allen \"having used the ascent to the above\" Shmakov \"He has reached the ascending path to the (Celestial) Distance\" jn probably has the meaning \"reach\" in this passage (cf. §416a). In this passage, jat is written with {path}-N31 sign. As Unis PT corpus does not use a {path} sign as the determinative for the verb ja(j) \"ascend\", but uses (like in other pyramids) the {mastaba} sign as the normal determinative for the verb, jat should here probably be translated as \"ascending path\". Of course it is nonetheless possible that the scribe merely preferred {path} to the usual {mastaba} sign, and then jat means \"that which ascends\" in a generic sense. W 172 (PT 262) §327a: sT Tw rx.t(j) sw Allen \"since you know me\" James Allen misprinted here – \"since you know him\" is in the original. 2) §334a: swA(j).n Wnjs Hr pr nmt(j) <p>f Allen \"Unis has passed by his ba’s house\" Shmakov \"Unis has passed by that (dangerous) Butcher’s house\" The sign that follows pr \"house\" is neither bA-{cup with stylized incense smoke}-Aa4/W10a sign nor {cup}-W10, as the sign in the original is too tall to fit with these signs. It is rather a variant of nmt-{butcher’s block}-T28/T28A sign (see Nt 762), as it occurs in other spellings of the divinity bA nmt(j) pf \"that Ram-Butcher\" right after the Aa4/W10a sign.

The danger of bA pf \"that Ram\" is also indicated by the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117nmt-{butcher’s block}-T28/T28A sign that occurs as part (determinative ?) of this divinity’s name in Pepi I’s (Leclant, Pepi I, pl.

The expression n Dt \"of the person\" is a way to say \"own, proper, personal\" as designation of relationship and ownership in Egyptian (which didn’t have a word for \"own\", nor the verb \"to have\"). It may be compare to two expressions that are used in the same way: n Xt \"of the belly\" (as designation of relationship), e.g. zA.j n Xt.j \"my bodily son\" (lit. my son of my belly), i. e. \"my own son\", and Ds(.j)/.f \"my/his own\" (§364b, as designation of relationship and ownership widely-used in the M.K.), e.g. MMA 12.183.8, BM 1783: jw DA.n(.j) jwwj m (m)Xnt(.j) Ds(.j) \"I transported the wrecked person in my own ferryboat (lit. probably \"in my ferryboat of my person (?)\")\". The exact meaning of Ds is unknown; the word is a noun, nearly always used with suffix pronoun and linked to another noun by direct genitive. Cf. the similar unique use of Xt.f with direct genitive on the O.K. stelae: zA (n)swt Xt.f \"king’s own son\" (BM 1273, 1274). The designation of ownership in Egyptian through such nouns as Dt \"(of) person\" and Xt \"(of) belly\" suggests that the meaning of the word Ds must be sought in the sphere of the human person as well, and the probability is high that it is a synonym of Dt \"person\". Cf. PT 267, §364b: jb n wnjs n.f Ds.f \"Unis’s own heart (lit. Unis’s heart of his person (?)) is his\" and Nt 742-743: jb.k n.k n Dt.k \"your own heart (lit. your heart of your person) is yours\"; Hrw n Dt.f \"Horus in (lit. of) his person, Horus himself\" (§683b, see T 265, 1), ra Ds.f \"the Sun himself\" (CT IV, 215c (M1N4)) and twt n ra Dt.f \"image of the Sun himself\" (Sethy I, Abydos I, pl. 40, l).

Moscow. 1988, see Bibliography. The term Dt in the Middle Kingdom was studied by Oleg Berlev proceeding from Perepiolkin’s study (Berlev, Trudovoe naselenie, pp.172-254).

James Allen’s reading \"away from the Duat\" was dictated by the context of climbing a ladder (§389b-390a), which is usually a way to ascend to the sky, and by his wish to fit this passage into his idea about the texts of the antechamber (to which this passage belongs). According to this idea, suggested in his work \"Reading a Pyramid\", those texts are about leaving the burial chamber-Duat: a king’s way to the sky begins in the Duat (dwAt, burial chamber), proceeds to the Behind the Horizon (Axt, antechamber), and then leads to the sky (pt, antechamber passage to the corridor). Although this idea is now widely accepted (and the author of the current work also agrees with it), it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of the preposition r in this passage (cf. Hays, Structure, p.252, note 103: Sd=sn(i) sw r dA.t \"they taking him out to the Netherworld\"). The Duat region, in spite of its location below the earth, is not the zone to escape from; we should not forget that it is the place where the dead Osiris had (been) resurrected. However, theoretically, James Allen’s reading is possible, as the preposition r does have the meaning \"away, from\" as a governing preposition of some collocations, bjAj jr has the meaning \"be away from\" as well as \"be away to (the sky)\" (§§801a, 1016a); s.Hrj r \"distance from\" (§§653c, 1622a) as well as \"distance to (the sky)\" (Sin. R7; Urk.IV:896:1). W 179 (PT 272) §392c: wnjs pj Srr jm Allen \"Unis is the little one in it\" Shmakov \"Unis is the youngest\" jm(j) \"who is in/from\" or loosely \"among\" is a nisbe and is probably a superlative marker (not an adverb \"there\", Allen, M. E., 6.8), i. e. \"young one who is from (the young ones, i. e. he is young even among/compared to the young ones)\" ~ \"the youngest\". Cf. PT 336, §548a: aA jmj nTrw \"eldest of the gods\", PT 446, §825d: Twt wr jm ms.s \"You are the eldest of her progeny/children\", literally \"elder who is from the gods\" and \"You are the great one who is from/in her progeny/children\" respectively. The same probably occurs in the word-formation bAk jm(j), i. e. \"servant who is from (the servants)\" ~ \"the most (valuable) servant\" ~ \"(your) humble servant\". The same idea of the king’s youthful age is expressed in the similar spell PT 607, §1701a-b: ms.n nw nmtj-m-zA.f mr.n ra Hr Drt.f jAbt nxn(.j) njj sAAt nmtj-m-zA.f mr.n ra \"Nu has given birth to Nemtiemzaf Merenre on his left hand, he is growing up and without Nemtiemzaf Merenre’s experience\". 2) §392d: jw wnjs pn tp(j) Smsw ra nj wnjs pn tp nTrw tjxtjx(.w)   18 Also probably existed the word of feminine gender or nisba: zSzSt (zSzS(j)t ?) \"(she of ?) water-lily\" (the name of Mereruka’s wife)."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131Allen \"For this Unis is at the head of the Sun’s followers; this Unis is not at the head of the gods of disturbance\" Shmakov \"This Unis is at the head of the Sun’s followers, this Unis is not at the head of the outcast/loner (lit. parted) gods\" For tjxtjx(.w) read txtx(.w) (tj is sometimes used for t (Edel, Altag.

The verb txtx is a variant spelling of the verb tStS/tS(j) \"come off, part\", often as the collocation tS(j) r \"come off, part from\" (cp. txtx (CT IV, 385d) ~ tStS (CT VI, 295h) \"tear\", a case of /x/ ~ /S/ (see W 88)). Allen’s translation \"disturbance\" makes clear he derives the word from a verb listed in the dictionaries as txtx \"mess up, disorder\" (said e.g. of hair, Urk. V:87:4), but in the PT, the word for \"disorder, disturbance\" is Xnw/Xnnw. For the meaning of the verb tStS/tS(j), cf.: CT III, 315b: Hbs.n.j gmt.n.j tS.w \"I have swaddled that which I have found came off (the corpse as a result of rotting)\" (the same expression occurs ibid, 297c) CT IV, 94t: wn.j Hna Hw hrw Hbs tStS(.w) \"I will be with Hu on the day of swaddling of that which came off\" CT VII, 26p-q: jnk wt j.n jnpw jj.n.j Hbs(.j) gmt.n(.j) tSy.w \"“I am an embalmer” – said Anubis, “I have come that I may swaddle that which I have found came off”\" Budge, BD183:27-28: Ast Hna.k nn tS.s jr.k \"Isis is with you and will not part from you\" Urk.IV:32:10: tm tSt r nb tAwj Hr prjt \"without parting from the Lord of the Two Lands on the battlefield\" (similar occur ibid 603:10, 899:13, 901:6, 938:14) Urk.IV:38:11: jwtj tS r nswt Hr prj \"who didn’t part from the king on the battlefield\" The verb’s meaning \"tear\" or \"crush\" (Eb. 69, 12) is secondary of the base \"come off, part\", literally \"part (into pieces)\": CT IV, 385c-e: zwA ar.k txtx mDAwt.k Hr nn mrmr Dd.n.k jry.k r N tn \"Your writing-reed has been broken, your papyrus-scrolls have been torn because of that painful thing which you have said that you are going to do against this N\" CT VI, 295h-i: sD.f xAw.k tStS.f {Htpw}<mDAwt>.k st.f pAs.k r tA \"that he may break your water-pots, tear your papyrus-scrolls (and) smash your ink-pot against the ground (lit. throw your ink-pot to the ground)\" The scribe no doubt misunderstood three mDAt-{papyrus scroll}-Y1/Y2 signs in the hieratic for Htpw, so there is no \"offerings\" or \"peace\" in the just cited passage. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132Cf. also the collocation tS(j) r \"come off, part from\" as the synonym of the collocation wp(j) r \"part from\". These gods also occur in PT 607, §1701c-d, despite the rather different writing of the word (a case of xA ~ x, see Edel, Alta.

The nTrw tjxtjx(.w) \"outcast/deserter (lit. parted) gods\" are the gods who cut themselves off from the group (in this passage from the Smsw ra \"the Sun’s followers\"). For the word’s meaning cf. also the following passage about an amnesty granted by the queen Jahhotpu (jaH-Htp(.w) \"The Moon is content\"): Urk.IV:21:13-14: nw.n.s wtxw.s jnq.s tSw.s \"She has gathered her fugitives, she has collected her outcasts/loners (tSw) (for the new life)\".

The verb nm(j)nm(j) is probably 6-rad., not 4-rad., see T 196, 4. James Allen is here followed in the meaning \"horizons\" for Akrw, cf. CT VI, 270q-r: Hr.tjwn r.j Akrw nw pt Hrt zAAw wAwt m pt mHt(j)t \"Be far from me, horizons of the upper sky, who guard the roads in the northern sky\", cf. also §658d-e where the word is used in parallel to sHdw \"stars\". Dr. Oleg Berlev suggested the reading \"(protective) doorstep\" for Akr (Berlev, Sculpture, p. 359, note еф). 2) §393c: gr r.sn gnmw Allen \"those who move have grown still\" Shmakov \"hastening ones have stopped (lit. grown still)\" When referring to speaking, the verb gr has the meaning \"be(come) silent\", and when referring to an action, the verb has the meaning \"be(come) still, stop\" (this note about the verb is due to J. Allen). The root of the nominalized plural participle (i. e. actually plural noun of agent) gnmw is probably a variant of the geminated root xAmm \"hurry, hasten\" (Wb.III:231:14, Allen, Inflection, §§82, 739), a case of /A/ ~ /n/ (~ /l/, see W 78) and /g/ ~ /x/ (see M 52), i. e. gnm ~ xAm. Note that both verbs have {walking legs} determinative (§§393c T, 1254d P), but there are also cases in which this determinative is omitted (§§393c W, 1254d MN), which often happens to verbs of motion in the PT spellings, cf. the spellings of the verbs zA \"go\" and prj \"emerge, go out\". Moreover, this is not the only case in which a word is spelled with two graphemes-substitutes which are allophones of the more usual phonemes (in this case gn instead of xA), for another cases see W 166, 1. For the meaning of xAmm, cf.: PT 531, §1254d M: jw mr.n ra m wpt Hrw m xAmm \"Merenre is on a commission from Horus as a herald\" PT 613, Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 22, col. 66: [mXnt X]nnt jt(j).f Asjr(t) nt(j)[t ja].tj xAmm.tj \"[the ferryboat] which his father Osiris rows and which has [ascended] and hastened\""},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 pKairo CG 25095 (pMaiherperi), 206-207: m Htp zp 2 mj zp 2 xAmm zp 2 \"Welcome –twice–, come –twice–, hurry –twice\" Budge, BD99(B):3: m Htp zp 2 mj zp 2 xA{a}m zp 2 \"Welcome –twice–, come –twice–, hurry –twice\" In this papyrus (pNu) xAm is without germination. 3) §394c: wnjs pj nb zAbwt Allen \"Unis is the lord of jackal-like rapacity\" Shmakov \"Unis is the lord of issue (i. e. birth)\" The word zAbwt is probably \"issue, outflow\" as a synonym of mswt \"birth\" (in §457b a relative form zAbjj \"which poured out\" also occurs without {flowing liquid} determinative (W 206, 8)), cf. CT IV, 181e-j: jnk pw aAa.j aAat zAb.n.j zAbt jmjtj mntj.sj [m rn.j] pw n zAb jxx...aAa.n wj mwt.j Ast xm.n.s Dt.s Xr Dbaw nb nTrw \"This is me: I have flowed out (as) an outflow, I have issued (zAb.n.j, i. e. was born) (as) an issue (zAbt) between her thighs [in my identity] of Evening Jackal (zAb jxx)...My mother Isis has poured me out having forgot herself under the fingers of the lord of the gods\". The term \"lord of issue\" probably refers to a person who caused his own birth. Note that in PT 273, §394c, this expression is used in parallel to the clause \"whose (own) mother (mwt.f) does not know his identity\", which (via the mentioning of the mother) again suggests that zAbwt is connected to birth. It does not support the idea that zAbwt is to be translated as \"wisdom\", as sometimes is done, and moreover, the word for wisdom is sAA \"experience, wisdom\". 4) §396a-b: jw Hmwswt.f Xr rdwj.f jw nTrw.f tp.f Allen \"his guardian forces under his feet, his gods atop him\" Shmakov \"his guardian/protective (Neith’s) fetishes under his feet, his god’s power atop him\" The determinatives of the word Hmwswt are the classical Neith’s fetishes: {shield and crossed arrows}. nTrw in the passage has the meaning \"god’s power\" rather than \"gods\", just like kAw is \"ka-power\", Axw \"akh-power, akh-magic\", bAw \"ba-power, impressiveness\". Though these words look like plurals they were abstracts, thus actually singular, cf.

The expression \"who ties the towing lashing (of his ferryboat)\" probably refers to making a boat ready and thus creating the ability to leave the place where Unis could go hungry, i. e. the action guarantees food security – the idea expressed in PT 555, §§1375a-1377c (see P 528, 2). 10) §400b: nb jnww xAa wpwwt Allen \"one who has fetchers and sends off dispatchers\""},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137Shmakov \"owner of fetchers who deliver instructions\" Samuel Mercer was probably right about the meaning of the verb xAa as \"to distribute\" referring to the noun jnww \"fetchers\", not to nb \"lord, owner\".

P. Allen of 15 May 2000). Egyptians did not know the word \"old\" or \"old age\", as the one who was old was \"esteemed\" and \"praised\" rather than \"feeble\" or \"senile\". The same is valid in the case of the term jmAx \"honored\" or \"honor\", which is usually a reference to old age in the expression zbj r jmAx \"arrive to the honor\", which is sometimes a synonym for \"get old, reach old age\", but we do not translate jmAx as \"old age\": CT I, 173i: [bw]t.j pw m(w)t r jAwt.j r zbt.j r jmAx \"My abomination is death before I have grown old (or \"become praised/worthy\") and before I have attained to honor\" Urk.IV:64:9-12: pH.n(.j) tnj m njwt rswt jmAx m xft(j)t Hr nb.s \"I have reached distinction in the Southern City (i. e.

In the descendant of PT 274, CT spell 573, CT VI, 181a, the word s.bn is spelled with the {bn-bird} sign (not \"bad bird\" G37), just like the spelling of the verb wbn in §§207d, 209c, 210c, 376a, b, 1652b, 2036a; CT VII, 212g (also in the spelling of the baboon-god name bnt(j) (§§608c, 1437c PM) and bnbn \"tall/erect stone\" (§1652b)). The {crown} determinative in Teti’s copy of §409a hints at the meaning of the verb as a metaphor for coronation (note the parallelism with \"carrying out an appearance\" ~ \"ascending the throne\"). The verb s.bn is a synonym of the verb s.xaj \"show\", lit. \"make appear\", cf. CT VII, 65i: s.xa.s tw m zA.s \"she will show you as her son\", Sethy I, Abydos I, pl.8: mry Asjr(t) s.xa.n.f m (n)swt Hr nst.f \"the one beloved of Osiris whom he has shown as a king on his throne\" (cf. also Urk.IV:357:13, 361:16, 1276:17). The expression wHm xaw \"carry out an appearance\" is a common idiom for \"ascend the throne\", like the verb xaj, which has the original meaning \"shine forth\" (the hieroglyph itself represents {the sun appearing/shining forth from the hill/horizon}), often is a reference to a king’s ascending of the throne (cf. Urk.I:159:8 (cf. also ibid:11): sk Tw xa.t(j) m nswt bjtj Dt \"now when you have shone forth as the Southern and Northern king during Dt-time\"). A king was nTr nfr \"Junior God\", the son of the Sun (zA ra) who was called in turn nTr aA \"Elder God\" (see Berlev, Dva Caria), i. e. a king was supposed to be \"Junior Sun\", hence his ascending the throne was called \"appearance\"/\"carrying out an appearance\" or more precisely \"shining forth/rising\"/\"carrying out of shining forth/rising\", cp. a king’s title nb xaw \"lord of appearance/shining forth\", which can be paraphrased as \"lord of the throne\".

The name of the divinity Shethmu is a noun of agent of an unknown verb, i. e. \"Szm-er\" (Presser ?) (just like in the nouns of agent xnzw \"Traveler\", Smsw \"Follower\", jwaw \"heir\" etc.), probably \"Presser\" seeing that his name is written with a sign {wine press}. 10) §409b: jw Hsb.n.f TAzw bqsww jw (j)T.n.f HAt(j)w nTrw Allen \"the vertebrae of spines have been broken up for him and he has acquired the gods’ hearts\" Shmakov \"He has counted the vertebrae of spines and he has acquired the gods’ hearts\" We cannot be absolutely certain about the meaning of the verb Hsb here, it can be \"count, reckon\" (as the determinative Y2 would suggest) as well as \"break up\". Knowing that the information about the number of something was important in Egyptian religion it is possible to suggest the interpretation of counting in this passage. We also, probably, have two sDm.n.f’s here, just like in the two following lines, §410a: jw wnm.n.f dSrt jw am.n.f wADt \"he has eaten the Red, he has swallowed the Green (crowns)\". 11) §410b: wSb wnjs m zmAw sAAw Allen \"Unis will feed on the lungs of the experienced\" sAAw \"experienced\" is probably a reference to the imperishable stars, cf. §§380b, 997c. 12) §411a: fjw wnjs nsb.f s.bSw jmjw dSrt Allen \"Unis will spit out when he licks the emetic parts in the red\" Shmakov \"Unis will become sated (?) (when) he has gulped down the bloodletting from the red\" Most Egyptologists treat the word sbSw in the passage as the derivative of the caus. 2 gem. verb s.bSS \"cause to vomit, spit out\" and thus translate sbSw as \"emetics\" (Mercer, P. T., p. 94), \"emetic parts\" (Allen, P. T., p. 52), following Wb.IV:93 \"Erkelerregendes\" (\"disgustful stuff\") This treatment of sbSw influenced the meaning of the verb fjw (Wb.I:576 \"sich erkeln\" (\"to be"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149disgusted\")) and Samuel Mercer follows Wb.: “N. is disgusted when he licks the emetics which are in the red crown” (Mercer, P. T., ibid) James Allen understood it differently but in the same way: \"Unis will spit out when he licks the emetic parts in the red\" (Allen, P. T., ibid). So, in his version the verb fjw has the meaning \"spit out\". But still there is the following question: \"Why should the king lick emetics and spit them out?\" As James Allen noticed a verb sbS in PT 302, §458a is the same in Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 72: s.bSt rn jwA jn sSm \"bloodletting of a fattened ox by a butcher\", i. e. \"bleed, let blood\" and not \"to be clear\" (Wb.IV:93) as it occurs in the spell-double (Leclant, Pepi I, pl. VIII, col. 51) with the {knife} determinative. Moreover, see CT VI 312k: wnm N m sbSw jmjw dSrt \"N eats from sbSw that are from the Red Crown\", where sbSw has the determinatives of {knife}-T30 and {plural pellets}-N33a. This all suggests that sbSw in PT derives from the verb sbS \"bleed, let blood\"” and thus has got to have a meaning \"bloodletting\" or \"bleeding\". Hannig (Hannig, ÄR) gives as meaning of sbS \"entkehlen\" (\"disembowel\") in which case we can assume the meaning \"bowels\" for sbSw. The verb nsb has the meaning \"gulp, swallow\" as well as \"leak\": CT VII, 253b-c: Tz Tw jr.k ra jmj kAr.f nsb.k TAww am.k mHwt \"Raise yourself, Sun in his ark, that you may gulp winds (and) swallow north wind\". Thus the verb fjw probably has the meaning \"become sated\", creating a parallel with §410 (\"he is satisfied with living on hearts and their magic\"). 13) §413a: sk bA.sn m Xt wnjs Axw.sn xr wnjs Allen \"For their ba is in Unis’s belly, their akhs is with Unis\" Shmakov \"For their ba is in Unis’s belly, their akh-magic is with Unis\" For the reading of Axw, see W 150, 1, W 180a, 7. 14) §413b: mHA xt.f r nTrw qrrt.n wnjs m qsw.sn Allen \"as the excess of his meal with respect to (that of) the gods, since it was heated for Unis with their bones\" Shmakov \"his meal exceeds (that of) the gods, which Unis has heated by means of their bones\" qrrt is either a passive participle or a relative form qrrt.n wnjs \"which Unis has heated\" The construction of the passage’s beginning is that of PT 357, §588b: wr pHt.k jr.f \"your strength is greater than his\", literally \"great is your strength against his (one)\" where wr is an adjective-verb, thus similarly mHA should be an adjective-verb or a verb as it is being read in the above translation. To read the beginning of the passage as m HA xt.f r nTrw \"in/as excess of his meal against the gods\" doesn’t make much sense (for m HAw, cf. Urk.IV:607:11-12: wAH n.sn Htp nTr aA m mAwt m HAw wnt m bAH \"to lay for them the big god’s offering anew in excess of what was before\"). Moreover, Teti’s copy gives mHAw.f jxt r nTrw, probably \"he will exceed the meal more than (lit. against) (that of) the gods\", and to read m HAw.f jxt r nTrw \"in his excess of the meal more than the gods\" is rather meaningless."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 15) §413c: sk bA.sn xr wnjs Swwt.sn m-a jr(j)w.sn Allen \"for their ba is with Unis, and (only) their shadows are (still) with their owners\" Shmakov \"their ba is with Unis, their shadows are with their attached ones\" The pronoun .sn in jr(j)w.sn \"their attached ones, their those who are attached\" probably refers to the gods, not to the shadows (in Teti’s version, jr(j)w has thrice {god}-G7 determinative). 16) §414a: jw wnjs m nn xa(.j) xa(.j) j.mn(.j) j.mn(.j) Allen \"Unis is in this (state), ever apparent, ever set\" Shmakov \"Unis is this, he has appeared apparently, he has become stable stably\" The two xa(.j) and two j.mn(.j) are probably statives. 17) §414b-c: nj sxm jrw jrwwt m xbs st jb Wnjs m anxw m tA pn Dt r nHH Allen \"Those who do (evil) deeds will not be able to hack up the place of Unis’s heart among the living in this world forever continually\" Shmakov \"Those who execute orders will not have control of hacking up Unis’s liking (and) of the living in this country during Dt-time up to nHH-time\" The expression jrj jrwt probably has a meaning synonymous to jrj wpt \"execute a commission\", otherwise it could be a variant of the expression jrj jrw \"take a stock\", see P 465, the examples from Urk.IV:188:6, 743:11-14.

For the reduction of initial w, cf. s.sx \"widen\" (§§288b, 698a, 1239a, the root is wsx \"wide\"), s.nm \"feed\" (§§120c, 123h in s.nmw \"provisioning\", the root is wnm \"eat\"), s.bn \"show, cause to rise\" (§409a, §2036a, the root is wbn \"rise\"), s.ab \"cleanse\" (§§372b, 838b, 841b, the root is wab \"become clean\"), s.DA \"make sound\" (§704c, the root is wDA \"be(come) sound\"), s.AD \"freshen, make flourish\" (§565c, 696a, b, 704d, the root is wAD \"be(come) green, frash\"), s.DA \"invite to go, let proceed\" (§§1203d, 1418b, 1420b, the root is wDA \"go, proceed\"), s.Tz \"cause to bear, bear\" (§§1148a, 1759b, 2060, 2061a, 2087a, the root is wTz \"bear, support, carry\") and probably sA \"pass\" (§421 P, Urk.I:216:7, 218:3, 7, the root is wA (?)). This is reduction, not omission as these verbs have their infinitive forms with t-ending, just like any caus. 2-lit. verb (see also Allen, M. E., 13.5.9).

James Allen’s translation of §475b-c is grammatically possible, cf. Urk.I:60:8: zSA Hm.f m Dbawj.f \"His Incarnation has written with his two fingers\", i. e. Egyptians wrote with a reed (ar) using thumb and index finger (\"two fingers\" of the passage), but it is hard to see any sense in \"writing with the (one) finger\". Allen, note 77 (page 63): \"The little finger is not used because it was employed in casting curses\" (also Pepi I’s note 131 (page 205): \"the little finger is meant\"). But this idea is too arguable, for two reasons: i) The word Dba can have the meaning \"evil curse\", but in the examples from PT or CT where the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 163word has this meaning it is not indicated which finger is meant: PT 534, §1278a-b: rDjt.f Dba.f jr mr Hwt nTr ptn nt pjpj nt kA.f rDj.n.f Dba.f r Hwt Hrw m qbHw \"who will cast (lit. give) his evil curse (lit. \"finger(-pointing)\") against these – the Pyramid (and) (its) temple of Pepi (and) of his ka, he has cast his evil curse against Horus’s Enclosure in the Cool Waters\" CT VI, 332b-c: j pdtjw Sw xtm r n hAb Dba.f jr mAAt.f \"O those of the (sky’s) arcs of Shu, shut the mouth of the one who sends his evil curse against whom he sees!\" See also two passages with Dba \"evil curse\" in W 48. ii) In PT 540, §1330a a little finger (Dba nDsw) is used for the opening of the mouth, so without negative connotation: PT 540, §1330a: wp r.k jn Hrw m Dba.f pw nDsw \"Your mouth has been parted by Horus by his little finger\" In the following passages from PT and CT the word-formation Dba Sr does not have any \"bad\" meaning either: PT 204, §118c: Dba wnjs Srrw Sd nw jmj SpA Asjr(t) \"Unis’s little finger, extract this which is in Osiris’s navel\" CT VI, 354k: dbn.T pt tn m Dba.T Sr mj zwn \"You will go round this sky through your little finger like Zewen(tjw)\" W 211 (PT 306) §480d: spd js Xr ksbwt.f Allen \"as Sobek under his mangroves\" The text has spdw js Xr ksbwt.f \"being Sopdu under his mangroves\" in the original. 2) §481b: m(j).k jr.k Tw xpr.t(j) Allen \"look, you have become\" Literally it is \"May you see yourself having become\". Similar passage occurs in Jéquier, Pepi II, pl.10, col.757 (= *§1966c-d): m(j).k r.k sw msj.j m(j).k sw TAz(.j) m(j).k sw xpr(.j) \"May you see him born, may you see him sprung up, may you see him evolved\". James Allen writes the following in his grammar about mj.k: \"The particle mj may have started out as an imperative meaning “see!” or the like; it was originally followed by dependent pronouns, like an imperative, rather than the suffix forms\" (Allen, M. E., 16.6.7, p. 189). James Allen is right about the origin of what we know from M.E. as mj.k/mj.T/mj.Tn \"See, Look, Behold\". But the author of the current work thinks that \"it was originally followed by dependent pronouns...rather than the suffix forms\" should be altered to \"there are cases in Old Egyptian when it is followed by dependent pronouns, next to cases that have the suffixal forms\", as these PT passages show. And this means that we actually have ancient 2-lit. verb mj \"see\" (for the spelling with D38-mj sign, see §§603 T, Leclant, Pepi I, pl.

See also Edel, Altäg. Gr., §§612, 613. That m(j) could have an imperative form is also proved by the following passages from the CT, in which it is used in parallel to another imperative, and the autobiography of Sennefer: CT VII, 237b-c: m(j) Tw jj.t(j) Ax.t(j) apr.t(j) s.mn Tw r.k m st.k tn xnt(j)t swt \"See yourself having come, akh (and) equipped, establish yourself in this your place foremost of places\". Urk.IV:547:8: mj wj m Ax pn \"Look I am this akh (lit. see me as this akh)\" To the instance of a sDm.f use of the verb mj probably should be attributed the following passage from \"The story of Sinuhe\": Sin.

The unknown word that is spelled jbt (which also occurs in §1321c, there with {road}-N31 determinative) probably stands for jnbt \"fence\" (of the root jnb \"wall\") with n omitted for the sake of saving space, just like in (n)hp \"set free\" (§36a), j.(n)D \"greet\" (§§468a, 469a, 471b, 487a, b, c, 488a), h(n)jj \"haul (rope)\" (§303d), r(n)pt \"year\" (§965b N), H(n)qt \"beer\" (is always spelled this way), (n)swt \"king\".

The Htmwt-canal could be a variant of Htm \"Goose-canal\" in §1228c. Cf. also W 54, 2 for Hwt Htmwt \"Enclosure of the Htmwt-canal\" (§1353c). As to the strange sense of PT 540, §1329a: Tz.n Tw Htmwt \"The Htmwt-canal has raised you\", the Htmwt-canal can be personified in this passage, just like the xns-canal is in PT 539, §1306a: [r n] mrjj-ra pn m xns wr \"The mouth of this Meryre is that of the great xns-canal\", and like the ptr \"looking waters\" having a {falcon on standard} determinative in §1680b: wn n.k TpHt pt(j) \"the cavern of the looking waters has been opened for you\". W 213 (PT 308) §488a: t(w)ttj jb Allen: \"the two reconciled gods\" In the edition of Neith’s PT corpus t(w)ttj jb is determined with two {woman’s head} signs, so it does not refer to Horus and Seth.

The second problem is analyzing what j.rx sw is. As Kurt Sethe shows (§495b), the older text version had a stative j.rx.k(j) \"I know\", but if the editor of Unis’s corpus would have kept a stative it would have been j.rx(.j) \"he knows\", but we have j.rx sw. There is a possibility to analyze j.rx sw as participle phrase/adjectival predicate \"the one who knows is he\" ~ \"he knows\" (Allen, M. E., 23.11), but it is clear that an imperative fits the context better: \"He belongs to those who know you, so, know him (too, Unis)!\" (a similar idea occurs in PT 262). The third question is what jr pr nb.f might be. It seems unlikely that it is a subordinate noun clause as in Allen’s translation, for there’s no introducing particle such as wnt, ntt, js \"that\", and of course it is not an unmarked clause as there is jr. So it is most likley a main clause; for jr as \"when\" rather than \"if\", see Urk.

The verb forms could also be influenced by the {man beckoning}-A26 sign, see T 282, 1. sHd(w) \"stars\" is plural as there follows a plural .Tn \"you\": \"Unis doesn’t have to give you his magic\". This spell is constructed as a dialogue, instead of a narration, thus Sdw most likely is an imperative instead of a passive prospective, and this is confirmed by a variant of the spell from CT (sp. 426) where an imperative occurs: CT V, 270c-271c: j.Hm sHD nj rdj.j n.Tn HkA.j pn...zy pw HkA.j pn Sd w(j) r pt \"Go back, star(s), I will not give you this magic of mine....“Who is it (speaking)?” (ask the stars) “(It is) this magic of mine (speaking), take me to the sky!”\" (B1Bo gives Sd sw r pt \"take him to the sky!\"). James Allen proposes to read Sdw as passive prospective sDm.f on account of the lack of examples in the PT in which 3rd-weak verbs have a w-ending when imperatives, and he produces as proof the lack of w-ending in the 3rd-weak verb zAj of §253a: zA Tn \"beware, guard yourselves\" (Allen, Inflection, §598, p. 415). However, the latter passage is treated differently in the current work, and moreover, James Allen missed that a damaged w-ending occurs in Neith’s copy of §253a: [zA]w Tn (Nt 725) and in the plural imperative of 3rd weak verb Hwj \"proclaim\", §155a: Asjr(t) Ast j.zjj Hww \"Osiris (and) Isis, go (and) proclaim\". Hence there isn’t any evidence against the reading of Sdw in the current passage as a plural imperative. For the reading of nj sDm.n.f as \"he does not have to hear\" in the current passage, cf. CT V, 55b (BqC, T1L): nj rdj.n.j HAtj.j pn n xppw \"I do not have to give this heart of mine to those who passed on (i. e. the dead)\"; other sarcophagi give a prospective sDm.f: nj rdj.j HAtj.j pn n xppw \"I will not give this heart of mine to those who passed on\", and so does the descendant of the discussed passage (CT V, 270c-271c), and cf.

Cf. also the descendants of this passage, CT V, 271a (S1C): Hms.j sA.j r Dsrt wrt m jwnw \"I have sat with my back to the Great Crier in Heliopolis\", ibid., 400h: aHa.n.j m Dsrt \"I have stood up as the Crier\" (here Dsrt has {sitting woman}-B1 determinative).

The word sbq is used to characterize the imperishable stars (see W 176, 2) and is probably a causative of bAq \"bright, light\", with A in the middle omitted (s.b(A)q) and for this reason spelled with {D56} sign as if sbq \"shank, calf (of leg)\". For the meaning of the verb abS, cf. Hornung, Amduat, p. 133: jw rx st m tmw abS am bA.f \"The one who knows it is the one whose ba cannot be swallowed or gulped down\". For pr m as \"come forth as\" (rather than \"come forth from\"), see T 263. The reference to Sobek as \"great tail\" (sbq xbzt) is probably due to his long crocodile’s tail. 2) §510c-d: wnjs pj nb mtwt jT Hmwt m-a h(j).sn r st mrr wnjs xft Szp jb.f Allen \"Unis is lord of semen, who takes women from their husbands to the place Unis likes according to his heart’s fancy\" Shmakov \"Unis is the one who has semen (and) takes wives away from their husband(s) to the place (when) Unis wants, according to his fancy (lit. to how his heart receives)\" Kurt Sethe indeed has missed the word nb \"lord, owner\" in this passage (it also occurs in CT VIII, §510c). The verb form mrr does not agree with the preceding feminine noun st: if it is not a mistake or omission of the t-ending (it is also absent in CT VIII, §510d), then this point indicates that mrr is probably not a relative form but a non-attributive relative (= nominal, Allen, M. E., 25.1 ff.), and that we probably may read mrr wnjs as \"(when) Unis wants\". For the relative form having the noun st \"place\" as antecedent with the t-ending spelled out, cf. PT 690, §2100c: swt.k mrt.k \"your places that you like\", Naville I, BD 170:5: r st mrtj kA.k \"to the place which your ka loves\". For the relative construction with the noun st \"place\" as antecedent and having non-attributive relative form, cf. Budge, BD171:3: s(w)t.f nb(t) mrr kA.f jm.sn \"all his place(s) where his ka loves (to be)\" (with infinitive wn omitted).

W 223 (PT 318) §512c: nHm.n wnjs wsrt.Tn nTrw Allen \"Unis will take away your power, gods\" Shmakov \"Unis has taken away your (bull’s) neck(s), gods\" The word for \"power\" in the PT (and other texts) is wsr/wsrw (§§320b/290a), while the word wsrt has the meaning \"(bull’s) neck\". Cf. the same phonetic spelling (with the r-{mouth} complementary sign and without the {stroke} sign) of this word by Unis’s editor in PT 254, §286c-d: TAz.n.f tp.f Hr wsrt.f jw wsrt wnjs Hr mkt.f \"He has tied his head onto his neck. Unis’s neck is on his torso\" and PT 217, §157b: DbA(.j) m jnpw Hr wsrt \"robed into Anubis on the neck\". The first copy of Teti of this PT spell also gives: jj.n tjt nHm.f wsrwt.Tn nTrw \"Teti has come that he may taken away your (bull’s) neck(s), gods\", whereas the second copy was reinterpreted: jj.n tjt j.dr.f wsr.Tn nTrw \"Teti has come that he may remove your power, gods\".

CT VII, 319c (B1C): anx.j m xm sw \"I live on the one who would desecrate him (or \"who desecrates him\")\", (B2L): anx m xm sw \"who lives on the one who would desecrate him\"; ibid, 515a: jnk...anx m xm sw \"I am the one...who lives on the one who would desecrate him\". Allen’s reading is grammatically unclear, one would expect *kA janw anx.t(j) m xm.f for \"the bull of baboons, in whose absence one lives\". Moreover, the compound preposition \"in the absence of\" is attested since the M.K. and is strictly spelled m xmt with the sign mt-{penis}-D52 (Gardiner, E. G., §178) which is absent in the current passage as well as the expected \"negative arms\" determinative after xm, the required determinative however is present in the previous §515c (j.xmt) of the current spell (PT 320). All this questions the reading suggested by James Allen.

The meaning of the verb pAx in the current passage is unclear, it may be pAx \"scratch\" that occurs in §440, where Mafdet is scratching eyes, and in the divine name pAxt \"She-scratcher\" (CT V, 399a). The verb pAx also occurs in CT VII, 223i-j, again with unclear meaning: m(j).k jw.f rhn.f m znf pAx.f m Trw.f \"Look, he has come that he may rhn in blood and pAx in his gore\". The initial m is probably an imperative \"don’t\" (cf. its spelling without {negative arms} det. in §§429b W, 429c, 582a,b TPM, 586b PM, 590a PMN, 652a M, 1267b-1272b, 1276a, 1693c, 1855a). James Allen translates §522d: j(n)D(.j) Hr.T m pAx.f xpr.f as \"“Greetings as he first comes into being,” (she says)\", but we have j(n)D(.j) Hr.T in the text with feminine suffix-T, thus a feminine being is being addressed, and we cannot treat this passage as feminine direct speech.

Probably we should rather read jn Drt wTzt as \"by the elevating hand\". The pronoun .s \"her\" of the passage does not likely refer to pt but to jAt \"standard\" which is implied in this passage. The SdSd is a cushion at the front of a standard’s top, and it is the standard that is the means of elevating the King, not some imagined sandal/foot of Nut. The standard has a wpt \"prow\" and apparently that part is attached to another part called Tbwt \"sandal\", which probably stands for a standard’s pole –the vertical part of the standard on which the horizontal part carrying a cushion and a god lies. Cf. the hieroglyph for the word jdmj/dmj \"linen\", a variant of G142/143 – {falcon on standard which stands on a sandal} (G7 + horizontal S33) in §816b (see Supplemental notes, notes on the signs, 13).

Allen, note 5 (page 95): “This term usually refers to the serpent that tried to inhibit the sun’s passage through the Duat. Here, however, it is written with the image of a game board, referring both to the successful conclusion of the game and to escape from the snake, which the game symbolizes.” The serpent mHn is actually the one who helped the Sun, and is viewed as a friendly snake, not a hostile one. Moreover, the {mHn game board} is the usual determinative for the word (cf. §1866a = Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 3, col. 37; Nt 6, 698), so there’s nothing special in its occurrence in the current passage. Cf. Teeter, Treasures, monument 2, page 13: \"The Ancient Egyptian enjoyed a wide variety of board games. One game in the form of a coiled serpent is named Mehen after a serpent deity who was thought to protect the sun god during his passage through the dark hours of the night. Texts indicate that Mehen imprisoned the enemies of the sun god within its coils, while other representations show Mehen protectively encircling the sun god. The objective of the Mehen game was to travel along the coils of the snake’s body to reach the area where, symbolically, the sun god dwelled, and hence, to join that god in his cycle of eternal rebirth\".

James Allen reads tA Dsr as \"Swept Land\", giving the verb Dsr the meaning \"sweep, clear\" because he sees the sign D45/D251 as {forearm with brush} (Allen, M. E., Sign List, p. 427). However, sometimes it is absolutely clear that the sign is actually {arm holding sceptre}. Moreover, he probably compares tA Dsr with its another designation as tA wab \"Clean Land\" (§804d) and the meaning \"sweep, clear\" for Dsr becomes as though proved. James Allen tried to connect the concept of sacred things with the concept of clear, pure, swept things, which is of course right, but it is here proposed that this is incorrect in regards to the word Dsr and that for the Egyptians the concept of \"sacred\" had firstly the meaning of \"restricted, closed, inaccessible\" (cf. Gardiner’s \"to be private\" for Dsr, Gardiner, E. G., Egyp.-Eng. Vocabulary, p. 604).

The literal meaning of the causative s.Dsr \"sanctify\" could be \"restrict access, conceal\". tA Dsr would thus mean \"Restricted Land\", wAt Dsrt \"restricted road\" and the name of Hatshepsut’s temple at Deir-El-Bahari Dsr Dsrw would then mean \"The Most Restricted\" ~ \"The Most Sacred\". 8) §582a: rDj.n Hrw jp<.k> sw m Hr jb.f Allen \"Horus has had you take account of him in his midst\" Shmakov \"Horus has had you subordinate him in his midst\" The verb jp has at least five different meanings: \"count\", \"recognize\", \"subordinate (heart (jb)), become subordinated\", \"withdraw\", \"appoint (jr to)\".

In line with this, these serpent-goddesses are said to do the guarding, namely of the throne, in the next line (§606c): hrw zA.n.sn \"on the day they guarded\". The sense of the spell is that the guarding of Atum by Teti is likened to the guarding of Nu by the four protective-goddesses – Isis, Nephthys, Neith and Selket (§606d).

The present passage must also be such an exception as well as its Neferkare’s variant which also has {cloth}-S28 determinative (Jéquier, Pepi II, pl. XIII, col. +40, it also occurs after Xn ibid, pl. VI, col. 709+10 (= Nt 742): Ax.k n.k m Xn.k \"your akh-magic is for you inside of you\"). Note Pepy I’s variant of the text spells Xn without any determinative which indicats that S28 is the influence (cf T 203, 2) from the very rare Xn(w) \"tent\" (attested only in the following passage): Urk.I:130:11-12: jr sDr.f m grH jr r(m)T jqrw sDrw HA.f m Xn.f \"As to his sleeping at night, appoint trusty men who will spend the night around him in his tent\" Oleg Berlev writes about the phenomenon of false {cloth}-S28 determinative which as I state is rather influence of Xn(w) \"tent, kind of clothes\" or the like (Berlev, Obshestvennie otnosheniya, p. 114-116, the translation from Russian is not word-for-word): \"In the inscription of Beby (bbj) IInd (W.

This ending of the spell is actually the theme of spells 665 (Nt 664-665) and 665A (Nt 743, 750-751). These words are probably not spoken by the four keepers of the four sky staves (§348a) but are a response of the Sun, who has come after Teti’s name has been proclaimed to him.

The first of them undoubtedly refers to the preparation of bread; we cannot be fully certain about what specific act is involved, but let us presume qmA \"knead\", see: PT 485, §1029b-c: bHz n nbw msw pt xAD n nbw qmA HzAt \"the calf of gold whom the sky bore, the dough of gold which Wild-cow kneaded\" CT I, 169i-170a: jsk jnk js jHbnnt.f tp(j)t tA xnfw qmA \"Meanwhile I am a scone of his that is on the earth, a kneaded pancake\" The bread which we know from the offering-lists as qmHw qmA (Wb.V:40:4) occurs in PT 338, §551d and Leclant, Pepi I, pl. II B, col. 79, unexpectedly as just qmHw \"wheat bread\" (after Allen), thus qmA adds extra meaning to qmHw (which could be named by itself), and now we may presume that it is \"kneaded wheat bread\". Having a generic \"produced wheat bread\" would make little sense. In the following passage from CT the verb qmA even has {bread} determinative: CT VI, 98c: pry.j jTy.j qmA.n jnp \"I will go up that I may take what Anubis has kneaded\" The second (derived) meaning of the qmA \"knead\" must have the meaning \"rear (a child)\" – the action likened to kneading, shaping dough, for in the following passage from the CT, the verb is used in parallel to the verb snq \"suckle, nurse\": CT III, 61c-d: jnk...kA HD snqw HzAt jnk aA qmAw Hqt \"I am...the white bull whom Wild-cow suckled, I am the elder one whom Heqet reared (lit. kneaded)\" Cp. also Sethy I, Abydos II, pl. 30: ab.k ab jnpw qmA Hz(A)t \"your purity is the purity of the child whom Wild-cow reared (lit. kneaded)\" cp. also CT IV, 350a: snqw HzAt \"whom Wild-cow suckled\", ibid, 366a: bA...snq HzAt \"the ram...whom Wild-cow suckled\". These passages show that the main occupation of Hezat was \"suckling, rearing\", hence the reading of qmA of PT 485, §1029c and CT III, 61c-d is \"knead, rear\" rather than \"create\". CT VII, 149g-h: ms.n wj mst Hr qmA.n wj SS nTr \"She who gave birth to Horus has given me birth, the god’s nest has reared me\" It would be odd to translate qmA.n wj SS nTr as \"the god’s nest has created me\" as the subject has already been born in the previous 149g passage. The same sequence we see in the following text: PT 247, §258b: qmA.n Tw gbb ms.n Tw psDt"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 196\"When Ennead had given you birth, Geb reared you\". Budge, BD170:11-12: ntk Hrw zA Asjr(t) wtt ptH qmA nwt \"You are Horus the son of Osiris whom Ptah begot (and) Nut reared\" and also in PT 485, §1029c quoted above (qmA + ms, cf. it with §623a: msw...snqw \"whom bore...whom suckled\"); only the context (xAD \"dough\") suggests we must translate there qmA \"knead\", and not qmA \"rear\" as might be expected (§1029c, CT III, 61c-d, and Sethy I, Abydos II, pl. 30, all deal with the Wild-cow). The same case seems to occur in the current passage, §313b, that is, if xnmt relates to bread-making, as is argued below. The noun which Wb.III:294:2, 3 transliterates as xnmtt is actually xnmt t \"bread cook (she-cook of bread)\", which is clear from §131d N, the editor of which fortunately wrote xnmt t-{bread loaf}. The presence of the word t \"bread\" is also confirmed by the O.K. name xnmt \"She-Cook\" (the name of the mother of Kahif, Junker, Giza VI, Abb.32, p. 110, also of a woman in Mariette, Mast., D50, p.313) and the village name xnmt N \"she-cook of N\" (with the word spelled phonetically, see below), which both spell without the second t. Much later there was a (surely derived) noun xnmt \"nurse\" (Wb.III:293:11, 14), which also lacks the second t. Cf. also the name of the divinity ftk t \"Fetekte\" (§120b) which literally means \"He who filters (?, W 140, 2) bread(-dough)\". That a xnmt was involved in providing food, notably the making of bread (rather than nursing which is expressed with the verbs ATj and mna, and nouns ATt, mnat), is shown by numerous passages: CT I, 252b: xnmt t bAw jwnw jj.t(j) Xr aqw n nb r Dr \"The bread cook of the bas of Heliopolis has come with sustenance to the Lord to the Limit\" (B10Cb gives a plain xnmt \"she-cook\" instead). In the following passage xnm t is synonymous to HTAwt t, probably \"baker of bread\", the word HTAwt which also occurs as HTAt (with {bread} det. after t, CT VI, 291n: HTAt rn n mwt \"Baker is the name of a mother\") undoubtedly has the same root as the noun HT(A) \"HTA-bread\" (Wb.III:204:8-9): CT III, 137c-d: jn mj r.f jn.f n.k st jn xnm t pr Hrw HTAwt t bAw jwnw jn.s(n) n.j st \"But who will bring it (i. e. xt \"food portions\") to you?

Due to the determinative of xnmt in §131d M (and also CT VI, 87c (B1Bo)), which is D122 {a sitting woman with kerchief on her head holding crossed sticks} we know that the word also occurs in the mastaba of Ptahhetep II, in the village name xnmt ptH-Htp(.j) \"she-cook of Ptahhetepi\" (Murray, Saq.

The determinative {nurse with child}-B6 that occurs after xnmt in the village name xnmt zSzSt (Junker, Giza III, p.83, Mereruka B3) rather suggests the reading \"Wet-nurse of Zeshzeshet\" (\"Wärterin der zSzS.t\" after Junker).. 2) §314e: zxjn.f Hwwt.f Allen \"This Teti will embrace his enclosures\" Shmakov \"This Teti will seek his enclosures\" The verb zxjn has here the meaning \"seek\", see W 41 (\"embrace enclosures\" is meaningless).

Instead, mr.n means something like “wanted” — i. e., “whom Amun wanted (for his son and successor as king)”\" (Allen, M. E., 24.9, p. 357). However, sometimes the perfect of the verb mr(j) seems to express complited action leading to the present situation, i.e. expresses state, in many respects like stative, cf. the perfect of the verb rx: rx.n.j \"I have learnt\", \"I have known\" that is \"I know\" and the stative rx.kw \"I know\".

Firstly, as it was supposed to have a limit/period, cf. Sin. B212: dj.sn n.k nHH nn Drw.f Dt nn Hntj.s \"May they (i. e. the gods) give you nHH-time without its limit (and) Dt-time without its period\", Urk.IV:182:14-15: [nfr.wj s.nfr.k Hwt nTr]...m kAt mAwt Hntj Dt \"[How good that you have improved the temple]...with the new shape (lit. work) of Dt-time’s period (i. e. which will lasts for Dt-time)\", (the same applies to nHH-time: Sethy I, Abydos III, pl. 58: jrt n[.f] Hwt aAt Spst m kAt Hntj (n)HH \"constructing (lit. making) for [him] the big noble enclosure in the shape (lit. work) of nHH-time’s period\", cf. also Wb.II:302:8). Secondly, as it had \"person\" (Dt), in the common expression n Dt Dt \"of the person of Dt-time, of Dt-time’s own\", i. e. during/for the course of Dt-time (cf. Wb.V:506:3, 510:1, n is probably the genitive, not the preposition \"for\", as in the N.K. it spells in full Dt Dt (Wb.V:506:6) and briefly as Dt zp 2 \"Dt twice\" (Wb.V:509:8), which is Dt Dt with direct genitive (i. e. n Dt Dt with indirect genitive ~ Dt Dt with direct one)) – Urk.VII:48:16: m-xt Htp(.j) jz.j pn m kAt.f nt Dt Dt \"after I have occupied this my tomb in its shape (lit. work) of Dt-time’s person (i. e. which will lasts for Dt-time; can be paraphrased as \"in its continual shape\")\", Urk.IV:147:3, 495:13: nn skt Dt Dt \"without expiring for the course of Dt-time (lit. of Dt-time’s person)\" (James Allen in his grammar translates loosely \"without the body’s expiring forever\" (Allen, M. E., 14.15, p. 169)). That n in the phrase is a genitive is also clear from passages with other time nouns, e. g. Urk.VII:16:6-7: nn wn mAr n hAw.j nn Hqr n rk.j \"There was no oppressed person in (lit. of) my time, there was no hungry person in (lit. of) my epoch\". Thirdly, it had \"length\" (Awt), in the expression m Awt Dt \"in the length of Dt-time\" (Wb.V:509:15) – something that badly combines with \"eternity\" (which could not have such measurable parts as \"length\" and \"period\", as they imply having a beginning and an end), and there even is an expression m Awt nbt Dt \"in any (!) length of Dt-time\" (Mariette, Mast., D38, p.268); nbt \"any\" means that the length of Dt-time was indefinite for Egyptians, i.e. we can paraphrase the quoted example as \"in any length of Dt-time (short or long)\" (cf. also ibid, D2, p. 176: Htp Dj nswt pr(t)-xrw m HAbw nb Awt nbt \"A king-given offering: offering (lit. sending the voice) in all the festivals (and in) any length\"). The Dt-time probably was supposed to be eternal if the king cultivated the natural order \"maat\" (called jr mAat \"do maat\"; mAat \"Leading One, Pulling One\" (see N 32, 2) is feminine just like Dt) and suppressed chaos (dr jzft). The term Dt was probably originally a linear time notion of the Egyptians since this term occurred in the Old Kingdom long before the occurrence and use of the term nHH (which is first attested in the pyramid of Unis). Dr. Oleg Berlev supposed that the term nHH had a meaning something like \"end of days\", \"beginning of a new era\", as it usually occurs in the expression Dt r nHH \"during Dt-time up to nHH-time\" (Berlev, Sculpture, p. 396-397, note ao). Urk.VII:51:9: jp.f st n nswt n Dt Dt \"He counted it for the king (a period) of Dt-time’s ownership\" Similar to n Dt Dt there is another expression which also contains the idea of possessing: n m-xt nHH \"of that which nHH-time owns\" (Wb.II:301:10; for the meaning of m-xt, see P 338): Belegstellen II, 301:10: s.xA.tw rn.j Hr r.sn n m-xt nHH"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 202\"my name will be remembered on their mouth(s) during (lit. of) that which nHH-time owns\" Sethy I, Abydos I, pl. 40, j: wAH jb.f r jrt n ms s(w) mnw.f nb mnx n m-xt nHH nj thh zp.f n Dt \"May his heart be disposed to make for the one who gave him birth all his efficient monuments of that which nHH-time owns.

Compare this use of xr with its use in the very common dj.n(.j) n.k/.T C Y Z xr(.j) \"I have given you (man or woman) C Y Z which I have/of my posession\" (see Allen, M.

Summarizing what was said above we can suppose that the term Dt (as well as nHH) whose meaning is undoubtedly close to our notion of eternity rather express time that could be eternal.

For the use of m/Dr/m-Dr rr.f , and a link to meals/meal preparation, cf. also §113b: t dwA m-Dr rr.f \"the morning bread in its (proper) time\", Nt 759-760: t.k Dr rr.f t.k dwA Dr rr.f \"your bread in its (proper) time, your morning bread in its (proper) time\", §553b: t dwA jw m rr.f \"morning bread coming in its (proper) time\". 2) §650a: wtt(.tj) jr.f Allen \"you are senior to him\" Shmakov \"you are firstborn to him\" For the meaning of the verb, see M 50. 3) §650b: Twt jt(j) n Hrw wtT sw m rn.k n wtT Allen \"You are the father of Horus, the one who begot him, in your identity of Begetter\" Shmakov \"You are the father of Horus, the one who begot him, in your identity of waldrapp\" As is shown by the {waldrapp (Hermit Ibis)}-G25 (Akh-bird) determinative the word is not \"begetter\", but \"waldrapp\". There is a play on words in the passage between wtT \"beget\" and wtT \"waldrapp\"22. The {waldrapp} sign that sometimes occurs in the spelling of the verb wtT \"beget\" (§§650b T, 691b, 1834a) is an unnecessary phonetic complement (just like the SsA {head of bubalis} sign of SsA \"bubalis\" in SsAw \"tongue\" (§127b MN) and SsAt \"night\" (§§568a P, 1761d). The same phenomenon of \"Phonetic Influence\" (see T 228, 10) occurs in the following words: Hsq \"owl\" and {owl} sign in the verb Hsq \"cut off\" (§§227a, 635c MN, 962b, 963a); Htm \"goose\" (§1228c) and {goose} sign in the verbs Htm \"end, destroy\" (§§308c, 843b) and Htm \"provide, furnish\" (§§40b, 901a); Hp \"goose\" and two Hp-{goose} signs in the divine names Hpwj \"Hapi\" (son of Horus) and Hpwj \"Apis-bull\" (§279d W, also one {goose} sign in §§286e, 279d T); Db \"hoopoe\" {hoopoe bird}-G22 sign in the noun Dbt \"mudbrick\" (§572e M); sdA \"egret\" (§126c T) and {egret}-G 33 sign in sdA \"shake, tremble\" (the verb also occurs without the {egret} sign, proving that it was an unnecessary phonetic complement, §§281a T, 393b T, 549a T); dSr \"red flamingo\" and dSr \"red\". Similarly, in Unis’s copy of §394b, the sign {horned viper} is not used in the spelling of the noun jt(j) \"father\", whereas Teti’s copy does use it (cf. also §§482c, 1225b,d) – it means that the {horned viper} sign is an unnecessary phonetic element in the word and that \"horned viper\" in Egyptian was jt or jtj, cp. the block from the Sanctuary in the Temple of Mentuhotep II at Deir el-Bahri (MMA 07.230.2) where jtjw \"fathers\" is spelled without complementary t (which means that {horned viper} must   22 Cf. PT 658A, §*1854f-1855a: sbx n.k [awj.k HA.f zp 2 m rn.k n ...] \"Clasp [your arms all around him in your identity of the dove]\" (Allen, P.

That I9, the sign representing the jt \"horned viper\", has a phonetic value (namely f) unrelated to the animal’s name is a phenomenon also seen in other instances. E.g., \"penis\" in Egyptian is Hnn, but the {penis} signs (D52, D53) can have three absolutely different phonetic values: mt (for instance in mtwt \"seed, semen\"), TA (in TA \"male\" and TA(tj) \"visier\" (Jones, Titles, # 3708), bAH (in m-bAH and Dr bAH, both \"before, formerly\").Another examples are Hnn \"hoe\", with the {hoe}-U6 sign having the phonetic value mr, sXat/sxat \"hare\" (Wb.III:268:11) and the {hare}-E34 sign which has the phonetic value wn, Hsq \"owl\" and the m-{owl}- sign. In some of these cases the phonetic value seems to have been determined by an older or alternative name of the object in question that became obsolete in Classical Egyptian (cp. Akkadian marru \"hoe\", Latin marra \"hoe\" (Vycichl, Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue Copte, p. 42); Demotic mt \"penis\", Cushitic mute \"penis\" (Takács, Etymological Dictionary of Egyptian, Vol. I, p. 122)).

However, the verb Sa \"cut\" often had the {bundle of papyrus roots} as secondary determinative through the influence from Sa \"combine\" – the same phenomenon occurs for the verb xma \"gather\" which has {grasping hand}-D49 determinative as secondary determinative from xma(j) \"grasp\" (for ex. §615a T and vice-versa {bundle} sign for xma \"grasp\", §547b PM). Because of such writing influences it has thusfar not been realized that there existed a verb Sa \"combine\" (3rd weak ?) that was different from (2-lit.) Sa \"cut\" and that (at a very early time) was the source of the unlogical determinative in Sa \"cut\". The {bundle of papyrus roots} determinative expresses the idea of \"combining\" and \"gathering\", just like the sign {sheaf of barley} (M182) in the verb mAx \"combine barley into a sheaf, sheaf\" and {sheaf of flax} (M38, M178) in the verb dmA \"combine flax into a sheaf, sheaf\". The use of the verb Sa \"combine\" seems to be restricted to the stative form in the PT, to generate the meaning \"combined (i.e. altogether, in a body)\" Cf. the similar function of other verbs in N 404. The {knife}-T30 determinative occurs in the paronyms of Sa \"cut\" – Sat \"veneration\" (§940c P, Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 10, col. 29 (Allen’s P 432)) and Sat \"knife\" (§257b), in Sa \"cut\" (Jéquier, Pepi II, pl. 14, col. +54 = §442c), also combined (Y10 + T30) in Sa \"cut\" of §442c, cf. the combined determinative of smA \"kill\" {pole axe}-{bull} in §481b (as the influence of smA \"wild bull\"). The verb Sa \"combine\" had disappeared by the M.K. and the original {bundle of papyrus roots}-Y10 sign was"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 207reinterpreted as {vertebrae}-F41.

Though the use of Sa as \"combine\" is probably restricted to the stative form in the PT, this passage could create doubts about that statement: PT 519, §1212e: j.Sa pjpj tpw.sn jm \"with which (i. e. a harpoon) Pepi will cut off their (i. e. adversaries’) heads\" Reading \"will combine (i.e. gather) their heads\" is an option, as a harpoon is sooner a thrust weapon than a cutting weapon. But in that case the supposition that Sa \"combine\" only occurs as a stative, as a frozen expression, would be invalid. Egyptian verbs and nouns did influence each other, which could be called \"determinative influence\" (as opposed to \"phonetic influence\" (see T 228, 10)), as shown by these examples, yet it is not always clear if it is determinative or phonetic influence:"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 208 The influence of the verb hb \"destroy\" (CT VI, 174b, c, d, e) on the verb hb \"plow, dig (into the ground)\" (§§285a T, 670c, occurrence of the secondary determinative {falling wall}-O118), Tnj \"alight\" on Tnj \"distinguish, be distinct\" (§283b T, {bird flying}, cf.

We should not treat it as the derivative from the root nsr/ns(j) \"flame\" as s and z are thoroughly distinguished in the Old Kingdom (see W 153). For the preposition m as \"against\", see W 166, 2.

The word in question should undoubtedly be read mrtj, not mSrtj, for the sign S-{pool/canal}-N37 in this word is actually a variant representation of mr-{canal}-N36.

Moreover, the word mSr \"evening\" would not fit here as it always has {sun with rays}-N8 sign as determinative (§§403b, 404b, 1048d, 1779c). For some reasons the words mrtj and mr (in nzr mr) were spelled with mr-{canal}-N37 and alphabetical signs m and r as its complements rather than with the usual mr-{hoe} sign plus its duplicate mr-{canal}.

The tj-ending can also be spelled wtj- in final-weak verbs (3rd-weak (see the example of the relative perfect spelled jrwtj.n(.j) in T 204, 4, below), 4rd-weak), verbs with more than three radicals, and causatives (cf. Allen, M. E., 23.8). We should be aware of the fact that the tj/wtj-ending was not the feature of the relative forms only, but all the attributive forms as well (i. e. participles (including suffixal sDmtj.fj) and relative forms), see T 196, 7. We also should know that the -tj ending doesn’t add any special meaning or feature to the verb form and is just a variant spelling (probably a full spelling) of the t-ending. We see here at work the PT editor’s preference of how to spell words, in this case the preference about where to place a biliteral sign, as there are four ways: (a) place it before complementary signs, (b) place it between complementary signs, (c) place it after complementary signs, (d) place it after all the signs of the word. It is clear that in our case method (b) was preferred, the same way as in: zn \"open\" in §984a, z-{block of stone}-n (P) usually spelled z-n-{block of stone} (MN); wa \"alone\" in §877c, P gives w-a-{harpoon}, while N (w)-{harpoon}-a; 3-cons. sign dbn {bowels}-F46 in dbn \"go around\" in §130d, WMN give d-b-n-{bowels}, while T’s choise is d-b-{bowels}-n; sbH \"scream\" in §1004d, s-b-{F18}-H (N.) usually spelled s-b-H-{F18} (PM); dmD \"unite\" in §577b, with biliteral sign S23 {knotted cloth}, d-{S23}-m-D (N) and as a variant d-m-{S23}-D (T); jab \"gather\" in §584b, j-a-{cup}-b (N), usually spelled j-a-b-{cup} (TP); tAjt \"Ta’it\" in §737c, t-{kiln}-A (TM) and as a variant {kiln}-t-A (N); sHd \"star\" the sign F18 which is usually between H and d (i. e. s-H-{F18}-d) occurs after them s-H-d-{F18}; the sign {ingot of copper}, which has a phonetic value of bn, occurs in the word wbn"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 212\"rise\" either after the bn-bird or b-n (§§207d N, 209c WN, 1465d, e) or between the bn-bird and n (§§207d W, 210c). It is interesting that Kurt Sethe also suggested the reading mr-tj for this group of signs in §653d while translating PT for the Wb. (see http://aaew2.bbaw.de/tla/index.html, document DZA 25.275.300). The unknown god’s name \"Desire-Fulfiller\" (nzr mr/nz(j) m(j)) (a bull standing on a sledge or on a standard) (PT 372, §653d, PT 667B) is probably an epithet of the god TA-zp or TA-zp.f. Teti’s and Merenre’s copies (§653d) gave us the determinative of this god – {bull standing on sledge} first, and the most crucial {bull standing on a standard} second. The god Tjazepef has the same determinative {bull standing on a standard} in Urk.I:155:13, 15. He also occurs in CT VI, 281u spelled {bull standing on a standard}-zp.f. For occurrences of the god Tjazepef, see Simpson, Mersyankh III, fig. 14, sarcophagus; also p. 21 and note 48; Urk.I:155:13, 15; Jones, Titles, p 584-585, No 2141, in the queens’ title Hm(t)-nTr TA-zp/TA-zp <p>f \"priestess of Tjazep(p)ef\", common for the Old Kingdom. For a discussion on god’s name vs. epithet, see Supplemental notes, Notes on gods’ names & epithets and on place names, 1. Teti’s and Pepi’s copies give this god’s epithet as nzr mr, whereas Merenre’s copy gives it as nz(j) m(j). It thus belongs to a group of words in Old Egyptian that shows a variation r ~ j, mostly at the end. Scholars used to think that in such cases, the r variant was always the original one, followed by r > j, but that has rightly been challenged and the accepted theory must be incorrect, for we find words originally writtem with j, which later, in the Middle Kingdom, had r, for example jn(j) > jnr \"stone\", bnj > bnr \"sweet\", dA(j) > dAr \"subdue\" etc (see also W 166, 2, i).

Raise yourself, this Teti, for I have taken your head for you, I have assembled your bones for you, I have collected your limbs for you, I have cleared away the earth from your flesh for you, I have taken your bread for you\" The verb forms in this passage are perfective sDm.f with 1ms suffix unwritten, not passive sDm.f (the same occurs in PT 413, §735b-c; PT 419, §747a-b; PT 536, §1292c; PT 553, §1363a-b; PT 612, §1732a-b; PT 664D, §1887a-b; PT 665B, §1908b (or Nt 729); PT 676, §§2008a-09b; PT 700, §2182c). This spell was pronounced by an attendant in the role of Horus or of the deceased’s son or by the deceased’s son himself. If one were to follow all the PT-translators, then the most important actions of resurrection (receiving the head, assembling bones, collecting limbs, clearing away the earth) would be performed by an anonymous person (as a reading of passive sDm.f ’s would imply) or, even more improbable, by the deceased himself (! cf. Allen, P. T., N 37, p. 355: \"gather your bones for you, join your limbs for you, and get your heart for you in your body\"), but in the PT corpus the action of resurrection always has a definite actor: §§101e, 584b TMN, 617a-b, 635a, 1684b-c, CT VI, 394c (Horus); 584b P, 623b, 631b, 1981b-c (Isis and Nephthys); 592a (Isis); 616a, 1789 (Nephthys); 639b, 830a (Thoth); 616e, 828a-c, 835a-c, 1036c-37b (restore 1036c-37b as jr [tp.f dmD.T tp.f jr qsw.f]) (Nut); 840b, 843a (Geb, see P 45, 2); 577b, 645a (gods); 739a-b (Tait); 980b (any akh or any god, see N 418, 4); 1008b (Selket); *1793c-d, 1801b-c (Horus’s eye). The expression Szp(.j) n.k tp.k \"I have received your head for you\" (also occurs in §§840b, 843a, see P"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 21345, 2) is similar to the following expressions: Szp a.k jn ra \"Your arm has been received by the Sun\" (§473c N, also Szp a.k jn j.xmw sk \"Your arm has been received by the imperishable stars\" (§2183b)), [nDr.T tp.f] Tz.T [jf.f] \"[You shall seize his head] (and) raise [his flesh]\" (PT 634C, §*1793c), Szp a.k jn ra Tz tp.k jn psDtj \"Your arm has been received by the Sun, your head has been raised by the Dual Ennead\" (§819b, also Tz tp.f jn ra \"his head has been raised by the Sun\" (§721c)), Szp a.k jn bAw jwnw nDr a.k jn ra Tz [tp.k jn psDtj] \"Your arm has been received by the bas of Heliopolis, your arm has been taken by the Sun. [Your head has been] raised [by the Dual Ennead]\" (§1261c-62a), Szp(.j) n.k awt.k \"I have received your limbs for you\" (§1732a). For example the presence of 1st person suffix .j in the following passage was indicated only by the use of a sDm.n.f form in the subsequent \"farming\" passage (cf. also section 3, just below): (Allen’s) P 553, Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 22, col. 75: Tz Tw jr.k d(.j) tp.k Hr r(m)nwj.k...s.kA.n(.j) jt Azx.n(.j) bdt [jr.n(.j) rnp]w[t.k jm] \"So, raise yourself! I have placed your head on your shoulders...I have farmed barley, I have reaped emmer [of which I have made your fresh provisions]\" In the following passage the presence of 1st person suffix .j is also clear by the use of the sDm.n.f form: PT 631, §1789: jab.n(.j) sn(.j) dmD.n(.j) awt.f \"I have gathered my brother and joined together his limbs\" The PT spell just below is spoken by the deceased’s son: PT 355, §§572b-74c: hA nmtj-m-zA.f mr.n ra p T(A)z(.j) n.k tp.k jr qsw.k T(A)z(.j) n.k qsw.k jr tp.k wn(.j) n.k aAwj pt s.nxbxb(.j) n.k zw(j) wrw(j) sTA(.j) n.k Dbt m HAt aAt...jw.k xr(.j) jw.k xr(.j) jw.k A xr(.j) Hrw js nD.n.f jt(j).f Asjr(t) jnk jnpw wt.k Dj.k(j) a.k m tA m.aHA.k m jAt wrt wnwn.k jm.f m-m Axw \"Ho, this Nemtiemzaf Merenre!

I am Anubis, your wrapper: I have given (Dj.k(j)) your arm in the earth and your fighting arm in the Great mound, that you may move about by means of it among the akhs\" Teti’s and Neferkare’s editors have misunderstood the original 1st person jnk jnpw wt.k \"I am Anubis, your wrapper\" and it was read as \"Teti is Anubis, your wrapper\". Dj.k actually has 1ms stative suffix .k(j), cf. also its occurrence in P 41b, 3. In the next spell the presence of the 1st person suffix is obvious because of the initial phrase, though, just like in the current passage, not a single suffix was spelled out: PT 606, §§1683b-85a: jnk p zA.k jnk Hrw jj.n(.j) jr.k wab(.j) Tw s.wab(.j) Tw s.anx(.j) Tw jnq(.j) n.k qsw.k sAq(.j) n.k nb.k jnq(.j) n.k dmAwt.k n jnk js Hrw nD (j)t(j).f \"It is I, your son: I am Horus.

PT 440, §815b: xtm.k w aAwj pt xsf.k w xsfw.s \"(Then) you should not close the sky’s (door-)leaves, you should not oppose its barriers (from opening)\" (for the reading, see P 36, 1). 3) §655d: Sd.f Tw jr pt xr jt(j).k gbb Allen \"that he might take you to the sky away from your father Geb\" Shmakov \"that he may take you to the sky, to your father Geb\" For the meaning of “r {place} xr {person}” as “(move) to(ward) the {place} to the {person}”, see W 207, 6. The location of the earth-god in the sky should not confuse us, as Geb is just a god of the earth, the earth’s personification, and as a god he could be everywhere. Cf. PT 214, §139b: jAq jr.k jr bw Xr jt(j).k jr bw Xr gbb \"Ascend to the place where your father is, to the place where Geb is\" – this passage has the verb jAq \"ascend\" that suggests that \"the place where Geb is\" is the sky, to which the deceased should ascend. Thus all instances of .f \"he\" in §656a-c refer to Geb, not to Khentimenutef (\"Thighs Forward\", §655c); this is also proved by §657d: m wDDt jrt n.k jn jt(j).k gbb \"as what has been commanded by your father Geb to be done for you\", and the fact that Khentimenutef cannot take the king to the sky and then \"be aroused at meeting\" (§656a) the king (as he has just been in touch with the king). Note James Allen’s earlier reading which is identical to the one of the present author: \"that he might take you to the sky, to your father Geb. He (Geb) will be excited at meeting you...\" (Allen, Inflection, §390, p. 263).

Although Montet reads the verb in example number 4 from the mastaba of Akhethotep (Davies, Ptahhetep II, pl. 7) differently as \"pull out (flax)\" (H mHa), the example should be in the list as there is no scene of \"pulling out of flax\" on the wall, whereas a threshing scene does occur on the wall (ibid, pl. 8, threshing by asses and bulls (ng)), so this is actually \"threshing\" (H). To the instances gathered by Pierre Montet should be added the instance from the tomb chapel of Raemkai (ra-m-kA(.j), MMA 08.201.1b): Hw zpt nt jt(j) bdt \"threshing a stack of barley (and) emmer\". Pierre Montet (Montet, Scènes) translates the verb H as \"fouler\", Hannig, ÄR, page 781:14 \"dreschen (a. durch Tiere)\", H m spt \"dreschen auf der Tenne\" Moreover, see the inscriptions in the mastaba of Ti, Steindorff, Ti, Tf 131: mAA swH gnw H jArrt kAt nb(t) nt sxt \"Review of the catching of orioles, the pressing of (lit. treading on) grapes, (and) every marsh-work\" ibid, Tf. 130: jnt jA(rrt) r H \"bringing the grapes for pressing (lit. treading)\" Moussa-Altenmüller, Niankhhnum, Tf. 57: Hw m zpt \"Threshing on the threshing floor\"."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 217 El Bersheh I, pl.31 (the inscription above asses threshing): [...] r H zp 2 H r m H [...] \"[...] thresh, thresh, thresh...thresh [...]\" Note that in his earlier work James Allen reads H as \"thresh\", §657a: \"Barley has been threshed for you\" (Allen, Inflection, §29, p. 17).

Associate the god to his brother\" Shmakov \"Ta’it on the lip of the great nest which makes the god fraternize to his brother\" snsn is a participle which refers to the noun jwn \"nest\" (this interpretation was reached independently from Samuel Mercer who also gives it as a participle). jwn \"nest\" actually has the literal meaning \"gathering-place\" and derives from the root jwn \"gather together\" (cf. T 145); cf. the word Xnm \"nest\" from the root Xnm \"join\" which occurs in the mastabas: Moussa-Altenmüller, Niankhhnum, Tf. 5, 74-75: Hsb [Xnm] Apd, Hsb Xnm Apd \"hunting nest(s) of birds with a throwstick\" (the word for bird is written with bird signs, not phonetically; Xnm has a {nest with chicks} determinative in Gebrawi, I, 5), Kanawati-Raziq, Seankhuiptah, pl. 69: Hsb Xnm \"hunting nest(s) with a throwstick\" which occurs in Deir el Gebrawi, I, 5: ama(A) Xnm Apd \"hunting nest(s) of birds with a throwstick\". Thus we literally have: \"gathering-place that makes the god fraternize to his brother (namely because of the physical closeness to each other in the same nest)\".

W 178, 1), but the actual meaning of the passage is really \"to the Behind the Horizon\".

Moreover, it would be strange to use a passive verb and then two active ones (rww, DAm); sooner one would expect three active verbs in the passage, \"arms move, feet drum, hands wave\".

But there are exceptions: Merenre’s copy of §745c gives this word with {alabaster vase}-W30 determinative, just like the previous word mrHt \"ointment\"; in the following mastabas and slab stelae the word also has the {alabaster vase} determinative: Manuelian, Slab Stelae, pl. 3-4, 5-6, 7-8; Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 57, 62, 63(= 64), 113, 207; Kanawati-Raziq, Watetkhethor, chamber B5, south and north walls of the alcove; Kanawati-Raziq, Meryteti, pl. 15(=49), 50; Ptahshepses II (Murray, Saq.

These exceptions show that during the Old and Middle Kingdom the word Ss does have the meaning \"alabaster vase (with unguent)\". Moreover, the word mnxt already has the meaning \"linen cloth\", so it would be superfluous for Egyptians to present \"linen\" twice. During the New Kingdom the original meaning of Ss probably disappeared because since the Middle Kingdom the sign is written in the free space of the mnxt sign, and step by step its original meaning disappeared, cf. Urk.IV:195:16: mnxt Ss(j) nswt \"linen clothes, king’s linen\" and ibid:821:2: mnxt nt Ss(j) nswt \"linen clothes of king’s linen\" (in this passage the word Ss(j) (< sSr ~ Ssr) \"linen\" is written with a {stone} sign as the determinative probably under the influence of Ss \"alabaster\").

Giving linen cloth (by) his sister (i. e. wife) Meryt\" Here Ss is written inside the mnxt sign but only two pieces of linen cloth are presented by Meryt, and no alabaster vases, as is shown by the image below the inscription. However, the situation is not absolutely clear when the formula xA t xA H(n)qt xA Ss xA mnxt \"thousand of bread, thousand of beer, thousand of alabaster vases (with ointments), thousand of clothes\" sometimes has an additional offering xA mrHt \"a thousand of ointment\" as in the current passage. It would be illogical if xA Ss would here still stand for \"a thousand of alabaster vases (with unguent)\", unless in this case the alabaster vase had a contents that differed from mrHt or unless an empty alabaster vase as the package for mrHt was meant (Junker, Giza VI, Abb. 33, p. 113, Abb.38a, p. 122: xA mrHt; Mariette, Mast., E7, p. 396: xA mrH(t); Murray, Saq. Mas., pl. 29, 30; Simpson, Kawab, Khafkhufu I and II, fig. 31, 32). It may be interesting to note that hieroglyph V6 for the word \"alabaster vase\" in the expression xA Ss sometimes is written upside down as V7 (which has the phonetic value Sn), see Junker, Giza I, Abb. 36, p. 186; Junker, Giza VIII, Abb. 58; Mastaba of Izi, block in Copengagen (= Berlev, Stelae, p. 32); ASAE 38, page 35, fig. 2 (the stela of Inikaf); Simpson, Qar and Idu, fig. 41; Duell, Mereruikai, pl.57, 62, 63(=64), 113, 207; Kanawati-Raziq, Meryteti, pl. 15(=49), 50; Murray, Saq.

So the veneration in the gods’s hearts is as natural and selfevident as a crown on a king and a braid on a beduin. xpr is probably an infinitive, not sDm.f, literally \"evolving, arising, coming about, happening\".

Of course usually feathers are just feathers, but in such cases (i.e., to characterize \"two feathers\" as real feathers) the adjective qA(j) seems to be used rather than Aw(j), cf.

Urk.IV:111:8: nb Swtj wrtj \"who has two great feathers\". Or such feathers are explicitly qualified as the feathers that occur as head-dress of gods: CT V, 257i: Swtj spdw m wpt.f Atf \"the two feathers of Sopdu on the top of his head (are that) of the Atf-crown\"; CT V 33g: Swtj.j m tp.j mj mn gbtjw(j): \"My two feathers on my head are like (those of) Min from Koptos (lit. the Koptosian)\".

The same root occurs in the verb s.nx26 \"rear, bring up\", literally \"make endure, make grow up, add lifetime\" (§§465b N, 1111b N, 1966b, has the same {child with hand to mouth} determinative), also in nouns nxnjw \"child, one growing up\" (§548b MN, Leclant, Pepi I, pl.8, col.56) and nxnw \"childhood\" (Wb.II:312:2-3), literally \"enduring\", i.e. \"growing up, maturation\". It is Marina Sokolova (Moscow) who first noticed this — here is the relevant fragment from the article published in Russian in 200927 on the subject (translated into English by the present author):   26 With variations depending on either the first consonant reduplication (s.nxn) or the second (s.nxx), cf. sxsxd (CT III, 126k (S1C)) and sxdxd (ibid, 128j (S1C)) \"overturn, become upside down\". 27 M.

Wb.II:313:2-3: nxx — parallel zu anx von Personen und vom Namen, vgl. nxj (belegt Pyr., Totb.) (Wb.II:306:1: nxj — vom andauern des Namens (belegt Pyr.)). Wb. also gives two words nxx with the meanings “neu geboren werden” (II:313:4) and “alt werden” (II:313:8). There are reasons to think that the meanings of the word nxx “endure” and its derivatives are not sufficiently considered. Giving two roots with the meaning “endure” (nxj and nxx), Wb. does not consider the causative s.nxx: the dictionary gives only the causative from the root nxx “to be newborn”, Wb.IV:170:2-4: s.nxx — verjungen (trotz (A19)) (besides this causative, Wb. considers only the word s.nxjt “das Alter” (Wb.IV:169:8)). In his dictionary, Hannig takes only two meanings of the root nxx into consideration: “alt werden, lange leben” and “*erneuern” (Hannig, MR, 1324) as well as the same causative s.nxx “s. verjungen, verjungen” (ibid, 2263). Faulkner gives only the meaning “be old” for nxx, and inconsequently gives “rejuvenate oneself” for s.nxx (Faulkner, Dictionary, p. 138, 233). The only dictionary that gives two meanings of causative s.nxx is the dictionary of R. van der Molen: “rejuvenate oneself” and “let grow old” (Molen, HDECT, p. 512). There are reasons to think that the distinction of the two roots nxx with the meaning “endure” and “grow old” is mistaken: it is very likely that we deal with one root with two meanings — an original one and a derivative one; there is also a causative from this root that is considered only in R. van der Molen’s dictionary, but with a not too exact meaning. Before going into the argumentation of the supposition, a couple of words should be said about the word’s root. In the Pyramid Texts, it occurs in the form nxj: the presence of the final j could indicate that it is a verb with so-called strong j. E. Edel suggested that the word nx(j)x(j) was derived from it by partial reduplication; it appeared as nxx in the text (Edel, Altäg. Gr., §§433, 439. James Allen agrees with the opinion of E. Edel and considers the form s.nxx as caus. 5-lit. s.nx(j)x(j) with the meaning “cause to mature” (Allen, M. E., 22.12)). There is no marked difference in meaning between the forms nxj and nx(j)x(j) as in the case of their causatives s.nxj and s.nx(j)x(j). It is notable that CT prefer s.nx(j)x(j) to s.nxj used in the Pyramid Texts (for example PT 508, §1111a-b: Sdjj.n sw mwt.f bAst(j)t j.s.nx.n sw Hr(j)t-jb nxb “His mother Bastet has brought him up, She who is in the midst of Nekheb (i. e. Nekhebet) has reared him”; the example of using the form s.nx(j)x(j) in the Coffin Texts, CT I, 167e-f (= I, 176k), is given below). Arguments: 1) Taking into account the fact of existence of the root jAwj “be/become old” and taking into consideration presumption (5) [the presumption states: different roots — different meanings: there are no two different roots with absolutely same meanings (the principle “Plurality must never be posited without necessity” – T. S.], it is quite conceivable that the meaning “become old” of the root nxx derived from the basic meaning “endure”. 2) The fact that the verb really had the meaning “endure”, not “grow old”, appears from CT I, 296, a-c: jnk zA.k jnk Hr j.n.j jry(.j) n.k sw s.Axw pn nxx.k “I am your son, I am Horus, I have come to perform it for you, this akh-making ritual, that you may endure (nxx) ”. Since it refers to the afterlife, the meaning “grow old” does not fit evidently, as there is no growing old in the post-existence. 3) The existence of causative s.nxx with the meaning “prolong, make old” is proved from CT I, 167e-f (= I, 176k): nj Sdt.j TAw.j nj s.nxxt.j swHwt.j “I have not yet brought up my nestlings, I have not yet hatched (lit. “have not prolonged, made old”) my eggs”. The described meanings of the root nxx and its causative s.nxx allow to refine the translation of the passage from Teaching for king Merikara (P 106): jw zAw<wt> s.nxx.<s> rnp<w>t “caution prolongs years” (i.e., caution adds lifetime). This is close to the translation given by M. Lichtheim (Literature, p. 104: “Caution prolongs life”), which is obviously based on the general sense of the passage rather than the dictionary meaning of the word s.nxx. However, in the published Russian translations by R. I. Rubinshtein and A. E. Demidchik the passage is translated: “A cautious one is the one who rejuvenates years” (Rubinshtein, Chrestomatia, p. 34. In the first published translation (VDI. 1950. no. 2) this"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 229phrase was rendered a bit differently: “he who is on his guard rejuvenates years”), and “cautious ones are the ones young of years” (Demidchik, Piramida, p. 199). Aforesaid arguments in connection with presumption (1) (= meaningfulness of the text) provide a reasonable ground for conclusion that “caution prolongs years” is much more intelligible than “caution rejuvenates years”. It is quite obvious that caution is not a rejuvenating remedy and it does not provide rejuvenation. Hence there is sufficient basis for, on the one hand, giving preference to the translation of M. Lichtheim, and on the other hand, defining more precisely the sphere of use of the word nxx, and its causative which occurs not only in mortuary texts, but in the literary texts of the Middle Kingdom as well.” Such meanings of nx(j) as \"grow up, mature, evolve\" can be taken as secondary. The same phenomenon of secondary meaning occurs in the verb sAj \"become sated\", of which the secondary meaning is \"become wise, experienced\" (cf. the determinative of sAA \"experienced\" (§854b N) and sAAt \"experienced\" (§1701b N) which is {man with hand to mouth} – the same has sAj \"become sated\" (§551c,e MN)).

On the plates 88-89 only the determinative of wdHw has survived.

Hannig, MR, p. 2590, gives \"festmachen\" i. e. \"unmoor\". Faulkner does not give something that comes close to a navigation theme. The present author has arrived at the meaning \"push/cast off, unmoor\", independently from Hannig, as is shown by the examples from CT: III, 97e; IV 13d, 164e; VI 9d, 19a, 24m, 32a, 36f, 269i, 279g, 280d, 282l, 285a; VII 180e. The most striking are: CT IV, 13c-d: hAy N pn jr.f gwA N pn r rwd.k \"This N will board it (i. e. the boat, lit. \"will descent to\") (and) this N will push off from your mound\" CT IV, 164e-j: gwA.n Asjr(t) N pn r rwd...sSm Asjr(t) N pn wAt r jdb jzkn \"This Osiris N has pushed off from the mound...this Osiris N will lay the way to the bank of the (sky’s) western horizon (Izeken)\" CT VI, 32a-b: wart tw gwAt.T r.s wart tw pw mjnjt nTrw r.s \"The district from which you have pushed off is the district to which the gods moor\" CT VI, 279g-i: gwA.n.j r rwd...zmA.j tA r pt jmnt(j)t"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 238\"I have pushed off from the mound...I will land at the western sky\" cf. it with CT V 213b: wD.k r pt rswt Xnj.k r pt mHt(j)t \"You will push off from the south sky and row to the north sky\" T 284 (PT 407) §712b-c: wp.n tjt r.f wbA.n tjt Srt.f zAS.n tjt msDrwj.f wDa tjt mdw wp.f snnw(j) Allen \"Teti’s mouth has been parted for him, Teti’s nose has been opened up for him, Teti’s ears have been unplugged for him. Teti will decide cases and part the two (assailants, Horus and Seth)\" Shmakov \"Teti has opened his mouth, Teti has opened up his nose, Teti has cleared out his ears, that Teti may decide cases (and) part a pair (of litigating ones)\" There are probably three sDm.n.f’s in this passage, rather than passive sDm.f’s, as it is not a resurrection spell, and Teti should be able to do these actions himself. Though the verbs zAS and snS are undoubtedly related (/AS/ ~ /nS/, a case of /A/ ~ /n/ ~ /l/, see W 78), they are different verbs, not only because z and s are thoroughly distinguished in Old Egyptian with rare exceptions (see Edel, Alta. Gr., §117), but also because of the different determinatives – zAS has {Bat emblem} determinative that is {cow’s neck, ears and horns with human face}, while snS normally has {bull’s ear} determinative (§§1673b, 1727a, 2084b (= Nt 29), CT III, 13b, 14a, 74e). Thus the two verbs are here read differently: zAS (TPMN) as \"clean/clear out\" and snS (P second) as \"unplug\", following James Allen’s reading. In his translation James Allen identifies snnw(j) \"a pair\" as referring to Horus and Seth, but a general meaning is preferable because such a self-reference as being a fair judge is quite common, cf. wp.n(.j) snnw(j) r Htp(t).sn \"I parted (i. e. judged) a pair (of litigating ones), so that they were satisfied (lit. to their contentment)\" (Urk.I:195:13, 199:1, 200:16, 222:13, 255:7, 269:4, 271:5; Urk.VII:63:11), also wp.n(.j) snnw(j) r Htpt.sn m sxmt.n(.j) jm \"I parted a pair, so that they were satisfied in that which I had control of\" (Kanawati-Raziq, Hesi, pl. 52) and Urk.IV:971:13: wp zj [2 r Htp(t).s]n \"the one who parts a pair, so that they are satisfied\", cp. also Urk.VII:19:18: Dd mAat wp.f snnwj \"who says maat when he parts a pair\". So this heavenly epithet is not about making a decision in one specific case only (namely in the dispute between Horus and Seth), but about deciding the cases of any confrontation between two gods in general (hence the two gods determinative in Neferkare’s copy). Moreover, Horus and Seth are usually referred to as rHwj \"two comrades\", cf. Urk.IV:1072:11: wp rHwj \"who parts the two comrades\" (said about a king). 2) §713a: wD tjt mdw n wr jr.f Allen \"Teti will govern for the one who is older than he\" Shmakov \"Teti will give command(s) befitting (lit. of) the one older than he\" Cf. §938b,d: wD pjpj mdw n Ax m r.f nb apr \"Pepi will give command(s) of (i. e. just like) any akh equipped with his spell(s)\", i. e. he will give commands that are usual for any equipped akh, and the same is valid for the discussed passage: he will give commands that are usual for the one older than he.

The context of §§789c, 1357b, speaks of sitting and eating bread with one’s ka, and it is of course not mean that this will be done incessantly, without stopping (Wb.II:222), but that it is an option or routine that is firmly in place and that can be done whenever desired, without it being stopped by lack of food or other outside forces - so the notion is invariability rather than continuity. 4) §790b: {s}<H>r.k m-bAH.k jAwj.k tp-a.k Allen \"your sceptre before you and your praise preceding you\" Shmakov \"(put) your face in front, (as) your praise is before you\" sr in Pepi’s copy is probably the sculptor’s mistake for Hr \"face\", cf.

Hsbwt are \"bird farms\", they occur as an offering in the mastaba of Rahotepi at Medum (Petrie, Medum, pl.15), with determinatives which represent three times {plan of a bird farm} and which are also used to determine the word Hr(j)t mw \"bird farms\" (see Montet, Scènes, p.116 ff; Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 23; Kanawati-Raziq, Hesi, pl.56, p.34) – however, in this PT passage Hsbwt has the determinative {bird cage} that belongs to the word Sbtw (Wb.’s Stbw, but see below) \"poultry houses\".

Sbtjwj (§811d) ~ Sbtwj (§865c, CT I, 283g) \"two bundles\"). The form Sptjw occurs in the early Old Kingdom title wa wr Sptjw (Jones, Titles, # 1356), which is used along with wa wr HAb \"sole one great of catch\", as a couple (Jones, Titles, # 1353, for HAb as \"catch\" not \"festival\", cf. the determinative of the title’s HAb in B.H. I, pl.VII which is {a bird and a fish}). Thus wa wr Sptjw has the meaning \"sole one great of poultry houses\", which can be compared with the title xrp jbTtjw (~ jbTtw) \"manager of the bird-traps(’ keepers, i. e. fowlers)\". In the tomb inscriptions above, the word Sbt(w) \"poultry houses\" spells Stb or Stbw, but this is actually graphical falsification: this is the rule the present author would call “jb is good, bj is bad” or “the leg sign better fits in the second position”, cf. the following spellings: Stb – bSt \"rebel\" (Urk.IV:269:15, 271:16, 648:7) qHb – qbH \"become cool\" (§§1204c, 1877d) dHb – dbH \"ask, beg\" (Murray, Saq.

Cp. jTj Hpt n/r \"sail to (lit. take the course to)\" (Wb.III:67:13-15), literally \"take hold of the Hpt towards\", hence \"set course to\".

Note also that kA pt \"the sky’s bull\" (§803a) follows this passage, i. e. we have two divinities as subjects of the actions, not two localities. The expression sq(j) D(j)t jr \"take (lit. clap) the hand to\" is probably synonymous to the expressions nDrj a jr \"take (lit. hold) an arm to (a place)\" (§§856e, 1123b, Nt 762, Leclant, Pepi I, pl.

Merenre’s and Neferkare’s version of the current passage in a similar spell (PT 610) is different: §1717a-b: sq(j) n.k rdw j<r> dAt jr bw nt(j) sAH jm Szp jH pt a.k \"A stairway has been laid down for you to the Duat, to the place where Orion is, and the Sky’s Ox shall receive your arm\". 7) §804a: zAtj bjt(j) tptj.f nbt(j) wrt(j) Allen \"The hereditary king’s two daughters—the red ones upon him in his two boats, the great ladies\" Shmakov \"son (and) daughter of the Northern king, the two upon him, the two great ladies\""},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 254 Toby Wilkinson writes about these deities (zAtj bjt(j)): \"The hieroglyphs themselves resemble birds’ nests, but instead are probably to be identified as cult boats, perhaps for use in royal ceremonies (Anthes 1957:80, 83 fig 2)\" (Wilkinson, Annals, p. 97 (Djer’s third year)). Wilkinson’s first assessment is absolutely right and his doubts about what the hieroglyphs represent are not needed – as Merenre’s copy of §804a shows it are undoubtedly {two nests with two birds in each} (in Pepi’s version one bird in each). Fortunately, Merenre’s editor has depicted two genets (Genetta Viverridae) climbing the two nests; such representations of a genet climbing a papyrus growth to reach bird’s nests are very common in the Old Kingdom private tombs; besides a genet, such scenes often include an Egyptian mongoose (which has bigger ears), likewise attacking bird’s nests (the mastabas of Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 113; Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 10, 19; Davies, Ptahhetep II, pl. 13; Sankhuiptah, pl. 69(=76); Kanawati-Raziq, Hesi, pl.54; Kanawati, Inumin, pl.39; L.D.II:60, 77, 106a; Meir IV, pl.7). Allen accepts Anthes’s incorrect interpretation of the two complex hieroglyphs that follow zAtj bjt(j), and sees the birds inside those hieroglyphs as flamingos (G27, dSr), hence his reading of the two hieroglyphs as <the red ones (dSr) in (his) two boats>. The name of the Mafdet-genet is probably formed by the prefix m plus the root Afd of which the meaning is unknown, but which probably is related to Hfdj \"climb\" (cf. CT V, 142a, variation between mAfdt and Hddt, though we do not have a case of /A/ ~ /H/), as genets are often represented climbing papyrus roots; thus the name Mafdet probably has the meaning \"Climbing one\" (m-Afd-t, see T 159). On the Palermo Stone she climbs the {crook with package attached}-sign T18 (see W 5, 3). For the definition of Mafdet as a genet we are indebted to Hermann Kees (Kees H., Der Götterglaube im Alten Ägypten.

Your father is the great wild bull; your mother is the lass\". 2) §810c-811b: wn n.f TpHt wrt jwnw wrt Hts wr-a nj xnt(j) jmntjw Dj.s n.k mw...jr tp mDdjwnwt Allen \"he to whom the great cavern has been opened, the Heliopolitan, he of the great baton, the great one of the sedan chair of Foremost of Westerners. She shall give you water...at the middle of the months\" Shmakov \"he to whom the great cavern of Heliopolis has been opened, the great one of the baton, the sedan chair-dwarf of Foremost of Westerners. She shall give you water...at the first (day) of the half-monthly festivals\" Neferkare’s version gives the classical spelling of the queen’s title wrt Hts \"great one of Hts-sceptre\" (Jones, Titles, # 1481), Pepi’s version undoubtedly gives the same title with t in wr(t) omitted (cf. Urk.I:155:15 wr(t) Hzt \"great of favor\") and Hts-sceptre with t complement, cf. Jones, Titles, # 1476 (and Sabbahy, Development, p. 22 and nn. 14-17 (wrt Hts not wrt jmAt)). Thus the passage §§810c-11a probably deals with the \"great cavern\", with the two titles (wrt Hts, wr-a) referring to it, not to Horus foremost of Letopolis (mentioned in §810b, the .f in the present passage). The original has \"at the first (day) (tp(j)) of the half-monthly festivals\", James Allen meant it by writing \"at the first of the months\" which comes first, but then he should have written \"and the middle of the months\" rather than \"and at the middle of the months\" to avoid misunderstanding by the reader. 4) §811d: Sbtjwj n.k Hr nmt xnt(j) (j)mntjw Allen \"You have ribs from the butcher’s block of Foremost of Westerners\" Shmakov \"Two bundles (of ribs) are for you from the butcher’s block of Foremost of Westerners\" The word Sbt has the meaning \"bundle\", not \"ribs\" or \"rib meat\"; it is determined with the sign {rib}-F42 and is a synonym of spHt, which has a variant of the same determinative, F43, though F42 also occurs in the spelling. spHt means \"bundle, knot\", not \"rib meat\" as usually is presumed, for it derives from the root spH \"tie, lasso\" (see W 165, 9) and occurs in the epression spHt sprw \"a bundle (of) ribs\""},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 256(lit. \"a bundle, ribs\"), spHt nt sprw \"a bundle of ribs\" (Wb.IV:105:14, for ex.

Montet’s reading \"réunion, quartier de côtes\" (Montet, Scènes, p. 168)). It often is spelled without spHt, just spr(w) 4 \"four ribs\" (Junker, Giza II, p. 155, Abb. 21). In Sbt, the t belongs to the root, thus the word is masculine (just like xt \"wood\", twt \"statue\"); it is usually used in PT and CT in the dual form Sbtwj \"two bundles (of ribs)\", which sometimes is spelled Sbtjwj (graphic design with the aim to not have to write the ending with the signs X1-G43 {bread}-{quail chick}). P 35 (PT 439) §814a: H(A)b n pjpj nbt Htpt Allen \"The mistress of contentment will be in festival for Pepi\" Shmakov \"(Give) a catch (of birds) for Pepi, mistress of nourishment!\" For \"non-verbal imperative\", see P 318, 2. For HAb as a \"catch\", not \"festival\", even without {bird} determinative, see §§791b, 1358c. For Htpt with {papyrus scroll} determinative as \"meals\", see §133c. P 36 (PT 440) §815b: xsf.k w xsfw.s Allen \"you should not bar its barriers\" Shmakov \"you should not hinder its barriers (doorleaves) (i.e. not block them from opening up)\" The meaning \"shut\" that has the verb \"bar\" is due to English, while in Egyptian xsf could hardly have such a meaning, hence the reading of xsf with its primary meaning as \"hinder, impede, oppose\" seems more correct. 2) §815c-d: Dr Sdt.k kA n pjpj r pt tn rx Spsw nTr n mrw nTr Allen \"before you have taken the ka of Pepi to this sky, to him whom the god’s nobles...know, to him whom the god desires\" Shmakov \"until you take the ka of Pepi to this sky, the one (i. e. the ka) whom the god’s nobles know, to the beloved ones of the god (lit. those whom the god loves)\" rx Spsw nTr is probably a relative form with the antecedent kA n pjpj \"Pepi’s ka\".

Of course, not the king’s head is meant, but the whole body, the whole person is meant, hence probably James Allen’s avoidance of the literal translation.

It is possible that pSr/pXr has the literal meaning \"serving\", but due to the {tall bread loaf, beer jug, flat and round bread loaf} determinative its non-literal meaning can only be \"food supply\" or the like, cf.: Mariette, Mast., C15, p. 138: mAA pXr jnn m nwwt n(wt) pr Dt r prt-xrw \"Review of the food supply brought from villages of the personal farm (lit. house) to feed/offer (from them)\" Mariette, Mast., E6, p. 394: s.xpt stpwt pXr xr r-pr jn s.HD Hmw-kA \"Bringing the meat cuts (and) food supply to the (tomb’s) chapel by the enlightener of ka-servants\" ibid, C15, p. 139: zSA m pXr jn DADAt \"recording the food supply by administration\" ibid, C16, p. 144: [m]AA pXr jnn m nwwt.f n(w)t pr Dt r prt-xrw ra nb \"Review of the food supply which is brought by his villages of the personal farm (lit. house) to feed/offer (from them) every day\" Simpson, Mersyankh III, fig. 6: wAH n.s pXr \"laying a food supply for her\" Hassan, Giza I, fig. 136, p. 77, fig. 142, p. 82: wAH n.f pXr xt nb(t) nfrt \"laying for him a food supply (and) every good thing\" (the word pXr has the {tall bread loaf, beer jug, flat and round bread loaf, head of duck (fig. 136)/head of ox (fig. 142)} determinative) L.D.II:22: mA zSA pXr \"Review of the list of food supply\" (pXr has the {tall bread loaf, beer jug, flat and round bread loaf, head of ox} determinative), Hassan, Giza IV, fig.122 (= L.D.II:35): wdn xt pXr \"Presenting the meal (and) food supply\", Junker, Giza II, Abb. 29, p. 183: mA zSA n pXr \"Review of the list of food supply\" (pXr has the {tall bread loaf, beer jug, flat and round bread loaf} determinative), Junker, Giza III, p. 169, Abb.30: mA zSA n pXr \"Review of the list of food supply\" (pXr has the {beer"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 259jug}, bread (two kinds) and {ox’s head} determinatives), Junker, Giza VII, Abb. 87, p. 211, 214: xA pXr \"thousand of food supply\", Hassan, Giza II, fig.39, p. 44: pXr nb \"every food supply\". pXr in the O.K. offering list (Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 16:14, 32:28-36, 40:41-42-44, 48:46-49, 56:55-56-64, 64:65-66, 72:71-76, 80:82-83-84, 88:87-88-89-91, 96:93-94-95-97-98-99-100, 105:5, 113:110-111-112-113-114-115-116-117, 130:130-132-133-134, 141:135-136-138; Kanawati-Raziq, Hesi, pl. 64) CT IV, 136e: jnk jr pXr n Asjr(t) m Agb wr \"I am the one who makes food supply for Osiris as the Great Flood\" (on the S1Chass. we also have pXr with the t sign belonging to pXr determinative {bread}).

Mas., pl. 21, bottom register; pl. 22).

Cf. also the spellings of dwAt (d-wA-{star}{bread}) in §§1082b, 1083a P, 1527a, 1527c. Moreover, see Nt 696: m dwAwt (the word is in plural and is spelled d-wA-{bread}{star}{star}{star}) which James Allen himself translates as \"in the mornings\". Thus, undoubtedly the spelling d-wA-{bread}{star} = d-wA-{star}{bread}, both meaning \"morning\". The sign {star}-N14 in the word dwAt \"morning\" is the phonogram dwA, not a determinative – the determinative of the word is the sign {sun with two strokes}-N5a (see §404a). Thus the position of the sign {star} is not important and depends on the editor’s preference, just like the position of the sign qbH-{water jar in a jar-stand with pouring water}-W16 in the word qbHw \"Cool Water (i. e. the sky)\" in §§465b, 467c: Unis’s editor placed it after all the signs of the word: q-b-H-w-{W16}, while Neferkare’s editor placed it more correctly after qbH: q-b-H-{W16}-w. Moreover, the designation for the morning-star is nTr dwA \"morning god\" (§§132b, 357a, 732a, 805a, 935c) or sbA dwA \"morning star\" (§871b) (i. e. the planet Venus), hence the existence of a second designation would be strange. For another passages with dwAt \"morning\", see W 173, 5, P 458, 1, P 519, 3. 4) §822b: stt sSmw(.s) Tn jr wAwt nfr<t> jmjt pt Allen \"she is the one who will lead you two...to the perfect paths in the sky\" Shmakov \"she is the one who will lead you two...to the right/straight paths in the sky\" With wAt \"way, path, road\" the adjective nfr rather has the meaning \"right, straight\" than \"beautiful, good\", cf. the meaning of nfr in O.K. expressions of saying right thing(s) (Dd nfr) and carrying out right thing(s) (wHm nfr) (see W 180b, 8, ii), moreover cf. Urk.I:71:9: jnk [mr.f nf]rt msD.f <S>Abt \"I am the one who loves straight and hates crookedness\", i.e. I love truth and hate falsehood.

The verb in the passage is probably an imperative jp n.T, not sDm.n.f. It might be supposed that \"she in the sedan-chair\" would be rpt(j)t (i. e. nisbe), while we have just rpt.

He alternates between these two meanings as the verb can derive from the root gA \"stork\" (i. e. \"make a sound like a stork\" ~ \"groan\", the reading which is rather arguable as storks do not groan, cf. his notes for Teti’s PT corpus, No 16, p. 95 and Pepi I’s PT corpus, No 89-90, p. 204) or from the root gAw \"need, lack\". 3) §829a-c: wn.k xnt(j) tp(j)w rdwj.k wD.k mdw n jm(j)w.k s.rwD.k(j) pr.k m-xt.k xw.k(j) msw.k m-a jAkb Allen \"You shall be at the fore of those at your feet and govern those in your wake; you shall make firm your house in your wake and defend your children from mourning\" Shmakov \"You shall be at the fore of those before you (lit. upon your feet) and govern those in your wake, for I have strengthened your house after you, I have defended your children from mourning\" A similar passage occurs in PT 450, §836a-c MN.

II B, col. 64/ibid, pl. 22, col. 15), a name which the present author renders as \"Hostile one\", usually occurs in the Pyramid Texts with the personal pronoun .k as nwt.k nw \"your Hostile one\" (cf. jmj.f rd \"his impediment\" (CT VI, 396q)). In Pepi I’s pyramid, the name is spelled without determinative (§851b P; also in the pyramid of Merenre, 851b M, 1639c M, and Neith, Nt 415-16), or with the {rope} (Leclant, Pepi I, pl. II B, col. 64) and {net}-T24 (Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 22, col. 15) determinatives. In Neferkare’s pyramid, it is spelled with the {mountain range}-N25 determinative (§§851b N, 1639c N), or with the {snake} with {mountain range} determinatives; in the latter case the {snake} is placed after nwt, and the {mountain range} stands after nw, Jéquier, Pepi II, pl. VI, col. 709+16: [n]wt {snake}.k nw { mountain range}, the remnants of the snake sign of nwt.k nw are also in the following col. 709+17. In Neith’s pyramid the name occurs with a {man with a walking stick}33 (Nt 749, 751) and {mountain range} (Nt 665) determinatives. The sign {mountain range}-N25 determines the whole word (not only nw) for it also occurs as the determinative for dangerous beings in the words jatj \"Iati(-monster)\" (§236c), hjw \"monster\" (§245b), and three signs after plural zzw \"catchers\" (Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 9, col. 34, probably the same beings that occur in §271a). This means that N25 in this word is not the determinative of nw, and that the word doesn’t have the meaning or connection with \"hunter’s hunt\" (see also W 169, 7).

The sign {root}-M30 in Pepi’s copy proves nothing and is used as a space-filler with actual phonetic value bn, that is why Neferkare’s copy does not use it; cf. the following passage in which the sign {root}-M30 is probably used in the verb s.(w)bn \"show, manifest\" (see W 180b, 8), not s.bn(j) \"sweeten\": Urk.I:53:13: s.bn Hmt nb(t) xr nswt \"who causes every craft to appear to the king\" (cf. also Urk.I:82:13) PT 690, §2105a: bjn Asjr(t) bjn pjpj nfr-kA-ra pn bjn kA psDtj \"Osiris has become erect, this Pepi Neferkare has become erect, the Dual Ennead’s bull has become erect\" The middle j sometimes occurs in 2-lit verbs, cf. sjn \"smell\" (§1027b), njk \"accuse\" (§§1041d, 1042a; spelled nk in §1468a, b), ajn \"adorn\" (Urk.I:20:5), mjz \"bring/come near\" (normally mz, but with D38-mj sign in CT I, 182h (B10Cb, B12C), 259f (B10Cc, B4C) ), thus bjn (§2105a) ~ bn (§875b)."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" 274 Temple of king Sethy I at Abydos (Mariette, Abydos, T. 1.

An occurrence of the {ingot of copper}-bn sign (={small circle}-sign: for such a treatment of the sign, see W 160, 2) in the verb bAn in §894a-b proves that the verb is actually bn, the spelling bAn shows that it is a case of /A/ ~ /n/ ~ /l/ (see W 78), i. e. bn (§875b, 2105a, Nt 607, CT VI, 103b-c (BqC)) ~ bA (CT I, 287e: m rn.k n bA (T9C, B10C)) ~ bAn (§735a, 894a-b, Nt 737, CT I, 287e; CT VI, 103b-c).

In the mastaba of Khentikai the tomb owner is portrayed while writing, and he holds the writing reed between his thumb and index finger (James, Khentika, pl. 10). Moreover these two fingers are used to hold any small object, such as little vases with perfumes, lids of censers, etc. PT §1208a: Dj.k n Pjpj pn Dbawj.k jpw \"Give to this Pepi these your two (most used) fingers\" Two fingers are used as the determinative in the words mtr/mt(j) \"straightforward\" (also \"testify\", §952b P) and aqA \"exact, precise\". 3) §891b: gp.n Pjpj pn jr pt m aHaw Allen \"This Pepi has clouded the sky as a heron\" Shmakov \"This Pepi has soared to the sky as a heron\" gp \"soar, shoot upwards\" is used in the passage as an intransitive verb (gp jr pt), while James Allen translates it as a transitive one. Moreover, \"clouded the sky as a heron\" doesn’t make sense. The {sky with rain}-N4 sign is probably a secondary determinative as an influence of the verb gp \"to cloud\" (cf. T 203, 2). The same note is valid for PT 521, §1225a: j.gp pjpj mj aHaw \"Soar, Pepi, as a heron\" and PT 699, §2179a: j.gp.k mj bjk \"You shall soar as a falcon\". 4) §891d: pHr.n pjpj pn pt m Hrw Axt(j) njj ra Allen \"This Pepi has run the sky as Horus of the Akhet.

The sign {stretched arms as a gesture of negation}-D35 is used in Pepi’s I copy just as a space filler (for the space between n and jj), Neferkare’s copy, which is without the {stretched arms}-nj, probably shows that a nisbe was actually meant. 5) §892c: nj jr.n Pjpj pn jhAbw m wr-a"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 279Allen \"this Pepi does not make uproar in the sedan chair\" Shmakov \"This Pepi does not have to perform (lit. make) (any) dancing and singing (i. e. to make a performance) as a sedan chairman (i. e. as a dwarf)\" The word jhAbw which James Allen translates here as \"uproar\" (following Wörterbuch’s \"unerlaubte Handlung\" (Wb.I:118:11)) is probably the same word that appears in Urk.I:300:3, 301:17 and in Wb I:118:12-17 as jhb/jhAb \"tanzen\": jAhbw/jAhbjj (Urk.I:300:3, 301:17) ~ jhAbw (§892c) ~ jh(A)b (Wb.I:118:12-17).

The word jhAbw is undoubtedly in graphical transposition: according to the rule \"the bird sign better fits in the second position\" (see Supplemental notes, notes on the signs, 17), the A-vulture has been placed after h, though its proper place is probably before it. Cf. the words with the sign {vulture}-G1 spelled in the second position: pAd – Apd \"bird\" (§1484a N); kHA – kAH \"kind of bread\" (§102b, Abu-Bakr, Giza, 52 fig.38, probably like this as the word-play in §102b is with the word kA); zbA – zAb \"to flute\" (for this correct reading (not zbA), see Junker, Giza VI, Abb.43, after p.136); HAt – AHt \"field\"; tAjAt – tAjt (§56a W); wAxA – wAx (§1158d N); dbA – dAb \"figs\"; zbA – zAb \"jackal\" (§457b); mAHA – mAH \"clap\" (Montet, Scènes, p. 366); dtA – dAt \"Duat\" (§390b W); sHA – sAH \"touch\" (Duell, Mereruikai, pl.32); bAqA – bAq \"bright\" (Urk.IV:896:6); aApA – aAp \"guilt\" (Urk.I:174:6); bAD – bDA \"mould\" (Montet, Scènes, p.237); dgA – dAg \"Dwarf\" (man’s name, Hassan, Giza II, fig.50, p.55); HbA – HAb \"The one who celebrates\" (man’s name, Mariette, Mast., E8, p.398, 400). But we cannot exclude the option that the spelling jAhbw/jAhbjj of Urk.I:300:3, 301:17 was actually transposed, as the signs Ahb spelled after each other take less space and fill the imaginary rectangle better than when spelled hAb.

In his mastaba the title is determined with the sign {dwarf sitting in the sedan chair} (Junker, Giza V, pp. 3-122).

The phenomenon when a prepositional phrase precedes an adjective may be observed in the other passages, cf.: PT 80, §55d: s.dmj n.k jrt.k r Hr.k wDAt \"attach your eye to your face sound\" (your sound eye to your face); PT 518, §1197d N: stj.jn.sn Tbwt.sn jr tA HDt \"Then they threw their sandals to the ground white\" (their white sandals); PT 582, §1562c: abA.f m-a.f bjAj \"his sceptre is in his arm copper\" (his copper sceptre); Kanawati-Hassan, Ankhmahor, pl. 42 ~ Urk.I:202:2: nj zp StA HkA nb jr(.j) jqr \"never any magic hide from me mighty (lit. did not happen that any magic hide from me mighty)\" (any mighty magic hide from me). Also in case of a genitival adjective (B part in AB indirect genitival construction): Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 64: s.xpt twt(w) r jz n Xr(j)-nTr nw smr wat(j)...Tjj \"Bringing the statues to the necropolis’ tomb of the unique companion...Ti\" (statues of the unique companion...Ti to the tomb, nw \"of (pl.)\" refers to the plural \"statues\", not to the singular \"tomb\"); CT VI, 4h: rdj.n.f HDt m tp.f nt xsbD \"where he has placed the white crown on his head of lapis-lazuli\" (white crown of lapis-lazuli on his head). The word r \"spell\" is very common, cf: PT 215, §141c: j.rxw r.sn \"who know their spell(s)\"; Junker, Giza VIII, Abb. 62, p. 134: jnk Ax jqr rx r.f \"I am a mighty akh who knows his spell(s)\"; Urk.I:122:13: jnk Ax jqr apr Xr(j) H(A)b(t) rx r.f \"I am an excellent (and) equipped akh, a lector-priest who knows his spell(s)\"; CT IV, 30f-g (Sq3C): nHm.n.f HkAw.Tn Axw nbw rxw r.sn \"He has taken away your magic, (you) all akhs who know their spell(s)\"; CT VII, 18w: nj jnk js m(w)t xm r.f \"I am not at all a dead who does not know his spell(s)\"; Torino 1534: Ax nTrj saH mnx nTr rnpw rx r.f mm anxw \"divine, dignified, mighty akh, young god who knows his spell(s) among the living\" (similar on CM CG 20088); CT IV, 326k: jr xm nb r pn nj aq.n.f nj pr.n.f \"As to anyone who does not know this spell: he cannot enter, he cannot emerge\". Harold Hays in his dissertation reads r in this passage similarly as \"utterance\" (Hays, Structure, p.281). 3) §930d: jm(j) rr.k jn sn jr pjpj nfr-kA-ra Allen \"“Who are you?” they say about Nemtiemzaf Merenre\" (Merenre’s copy) Shmakov \"“Who are you?” – they say to Pepi Neferkare\" James Allen is absolutely right when he reads this strange spelling of m(j) rr.k (cf. CT III, 59b: Twt mj tr) in the original as \"Who are you?\", and this reading is clear from the context. The spelling of the interrogative pronoun mj was influenced by the spelling of the negative verb jm(j) \"not do, not act\", while the interrogative particle rr (~ tr ~ trj, see Edel, Alta. Gr., §§838, 842) was spelled as if it were the word jrtj \"two eyes\". Cf. the following passage in which the preposition r \"to\" was spelled with the {eye} sign: CT VI, 288c: jj.n.k tr r mj \"What have you come for (lit. to what)?\". From the texts we also   35 Ax apr occurs in PT 627, §1771a: pjpj nfr-kA-ra pw Ax apr \"Pepi Neferkare is an equipped akh\"."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 286know about the opposite case in which the verb jrj \"do, make\" is spelled without the {pupil} carved in the {eye} sign (i. e. spelled like the {mouth} sign): §1752b and Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 20 (= 21, in jr Tw r.f wrt). 3) §§938b, 938d: wD pjpj mdw n Ax m r.f nb apr Allen \"Pepi will govern every akh with his mouth equipped\" Shmakov \"Pepi will give command(s) of (i. e. just like) an akh experienced in his every spell\" Just like in §930b-c: S(j) sHsH m.zwr n Ax m r.f nb apr \"Stork Lake, the drinking place of an akh experienced in his every spell\", and in §937e-f: mr mna m.zwr n Ax m r.f nb apr \"the Nurse Canal, the drinking place of an akh experienced in his every spell\", the n in the present passage is not a preposition, but rather a genitive \"of\" (otherwise it should be *wD pjpj mdw n Axw m r.sn apr \"Pepi will govern akhs experienced in their spell(s)\"36, i. e. plural, just like in §§930a, e, 931b, not singular). The passage is not about governing the akhs (which would be strange as Pepi has just been questioned by them), it is about ranking him among the experienced akhs – he will sit on the lip of the stork canal just like they do (§§930b, 938c), and he will command just like they do. For \"an akh experienced in his every spell\", cf. CT V, 304b-305a (S14Ca): jj.n.j r tA Ax.kj apr.kj m HkA.j \"I have come to the land being an akh (and) experienced in my magic\". 4) §936a: jw pjpj pn Hna.Tn Allen \"This Pepi will come with you,54\" Allen, P. T., 203 note 54: \"Sothis and the morning god\" Allen’s note that suffix .Tn \"you\" would refer to \"Sothis and the morning god\" is curious, as it would imply a sharp change in theme. That is, after the akhs question \"How has this happened to you,...that you have come to this place more special than any (other) place?\" and its answering (§§932-935с), the theme of the spell would sharply change from a dialog between the akhs and the king to a narration about what the king will do with Sothis and the morning god. Such a sharp change would be even more strange in light of §§937e-38d in which the talk is clearly about the king sharing the life of the akhs. Hence, it is absolutely clear that the .Tn \"you\" refers to the akhs and the whole passage (§§936a-38d) narrates about the king sharing the life of the akhs.

The prepositions Xr \"under\" and xr \"with\" can be used for the same purpose; e.g., bw Xr ra \"the place which has the Sun, the place where the Sun is (lit. the place under the Sun)\" (§756b), Htp xr.f \"an offering he has (lit. with him)\" (§897b M), Htpt nbt xr.n Df(A) nb xr.n \"all nourishment we have (lit. with us)\" (Urk.IV:245:3). The notion connected with being \"behind, in the wake of\" (m-xt) someone is that of following someone, i.e. being in the service of someone, hence of belonging to someone, while the notion of being under (Xr) something is that of carrying something, i.e. holding it, hence of possessing or containing something.

This expression suggests that wdnt is not an offering at all. The word wdnt occurs exclusively in the expression sq(j) wdnt, the meaning of which will be discussed below. a) wdnt is not a food offering, as all food offerings or meals have a special determinative in the Pyramid Texts and in the private Old Kingdom tombs: it is the {tall bread loaf, beer jug, flat and round bread loaf} determinative, cf. wAHt (§101c), pXr (§818a), wdHw (§696a), jxt/xt (§§558b, 559c, 707d), jStt (§§121c, 717b), hmt (§334b), Htp nTr (§772b), aAbt (§§130c, 310b, 880d), baHt (§555b), xfAt (§880d), snt (§716a), Dnjt (§716b), jaw (§716a), st (§§120a, 123f), Htp (§130b), Sb(w) (§290d T), mswt (§§291a, 716b), prt-xrw (§1649a), moreover, swH (Hassan, Giza II, fig.137.1; Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 112 (transposed in the original as sHw)), dbHt Htp (Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 109, 135) in the private Old Kingdom Tombs."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" 297We know of wdnt and sq(j) wdnt only from the Pyramid and Coffin Texts, which is unusual, for we know other kind of offerings (meal, furniture or implements) from the offering-lists in the private O.K. and later tombs. For example the expression sq(j)/sqr t HD \"lay down a white bread\" (Wb.IV:307:9) often occurs in temple inscriptions. b) The Old Kingdom inscriptions usually use different word-formations to express the notion of laying down the offering meal: wAH xt \"lay down a meal\" (Simpson, Qar and Idu, fig. 22, cf. also P 37), e.g. Urk.IV:430:11: pr.f Hr njs wAH xt m jz.j n Xr(j)-nTr \"he will go forth to a call of the depositor of meal in my tomb of the necropolis\". c) If wdnt is somehow a kind of an offering, then we need to see any action with it or an actor, but the discussed passage has none; wdnt is used with the verb sq(j)/sqr in the Pyramid and Coffin Texts, so in our case it could be *Hr xrw sq(j) wdnt \"at the voice of the depositor of the wdnt\" to make sense, cf. OIP 102, plate 8 and 10A: dj.f prt m bA anxy Hr xrw n wAH xt n kA n N \"he gives: emerging as a living ba at the voice of the depositor of meal for the ka of N\". The same verb sq(j) is used in the expression sq(j) bnt or sq(j) m bnt \"play on the harp\", and sqr bDwj/Hmwj \"beat a gong\": CT I, 74f-g: Ast pw Hna nbt-Hwt {j}m sqr n.k bDwj/Hmwj m-bAH nTrw \"This is Isis with Nephthys as the beaters of the gong for you before the gods\" Cf. sq(j) wdnt tp-awj N of the current passage with sqr bDwj/Hmwj m-bAH nTrw \"beat a gong before the gods\". CT I, 248b: sDm.f sqr n.f m Hmwj \"He hears a beating for him on the gong\" Moreover, in §1110a-b the gods are probably \"moving, dancing\" (Agbgb ~ Axbxb, see T 225, 2; M 52) at the sound of the wdnt. This all suggests that wdnt could be a kind of musical instrument, such as a gong or a harp. The expression sq(j) wdnt also occurs in the Coffin Texts: CT V, 292c-d: j.zj m Htp Asjr(t) N pn j.zj m Htp xbs.t(w) n.k tA sqr.t(w) n.k wdnt jr.t(w) n.k xt xAw m xm \"Go in peace, this Osiris N!

For the meaning of the verb s.nx, see T 248, 2. The name of the goddess Bastet probably has the meaning \"Bast-resident, She of Bast\" as the town with this name occurs as the residence of this goddess in Urk.IV:432:9: bAst(j)t Hr(j)t jb bAst \"Bastet in the midst of (i. e. residing in) Bast\". This is another divinity’s name formed as a nisbe of a town name, cf. the name of the goddess Nekhbet, nxb(j)t \"Nekhbite, Nekheb-resident\" (see §696d nxb(j)t where it is spelled with {village plan} determinative). 4) §1118b: jw.n.f xr nrtj.f jptwt(j) nrt(j) Allen \"[he has come to] those [two mothers of his], the vultures\" Shmakov \"he has come to these two shepherding vultures of his\" The first two {vulture} signs are nrtj \"two vultures\", and those signs are a little bit different from those for mwt \"mother\" (the tail of the nr-{vulture} is carved more precisely than that of the mwt-{vulture}, see also §1229c for nr-{vulture}). Moreover, there is no complementary t and it would be strange to use the demonstrative pronoun jptwt(j) \"these\" after the word for \"mothers\".

Merenre’s and Neferkare’s version is clearer: nj wDA jb.n \"We have not been informed about your descent\" – the verb form is passive sDm.f, so literally \"our heart has not been made sound\".

The verb is zmjn, not zmn, as is shown by the mj-sign after zmn; moreover, see the word-play between the verb and the word zmjn \"soda solution\" in the spell T 226 (PT 420). The verb is spelled z-mn-mj = zmjn because of the graphic rule to spell words in a square or rectangle without free space, thus the spelling of §26a zmjn is not graphically correct and is usually avoided. The spelling of the verb also involves the secondary determinative {pestle and mortar} as influence from the verb zmn, probably \"beat dough\" (Hannig, ÄR, differently \"prüfen\", zmn t \"das Brot prüfen\", p. 1126 (follows Junker, Giza XI, Abb. 64, p. 162)); in the N.K. a verb s.mn \"establish\" in its turn is spelled with this secondary determinative. The collocation zmjn m probably has a meaning synonymous to the collocation bz Hr \"introduce to\". We should not confuse this verb with the verb s.mn \"establish, set, fix\", which is the causative of the 2-lit. mn \"be firm, remain\". For s and z are thoroughly distinguished in the Old Kingdom, meaning that zmjn and s.mn are clearly distinct verbs with nothing in common. jm.Tn does not have the meaning \"among you\" in the passage, it is just the verb’s governing preposition written in the full form before the suffix-pronoun, just like sxm.k jm.sn does not have the meaning \"you have control among them\", but rather \"you have control of them\", cf. W 134, 2. 3) §1419a: Hft nt Snwt Allen \"Granary\" Shmakov \"Hft of the Granary (?)\" *Hftnt (with O 51 as supposed determinative) would be an unknown word (a hapax), so it could alternatively be presumed that the text must actually be read as Hft nt Snwt, i. e.

It can also be read as \"This Pepi does not have to swallow Horus’s eye (in spite of the fact that) people...This Meryre does not have to swallow a limb from Osiris(’s body) (in spite of the fact that) the gods...\" (see W 221, 1).

This Pepi will lean with you on a staff of authority and an electrum staff\" The meaning of Dsr is \"raise, lift\" (see below), so the collocation Dsr Hr probably means \"tower / be elevated upon\", \"tower due to / straighten oneself with the help of / be elevated by means of\" or similar, with Hr «(up)on» having the sense of \"by means of, because of, due to\". The picture invoked by the Dsr Hr Dam is person standing straight up with the help of the staff. For the meaning of Dsr Hr, cf. PT 64, Nt 309: Asjr(t) N Dsr.k Hr.f.../ Dsr \"Osiris N, tower upon it.../ Dsr-staff\"; CT IV, 68b-d (T1C): j Hrw mj r.k r Ddw Dsr.k Hr.j mAn.k jrw.j \"Oh Horus, come pray to Busiris that you may tower upon me and see my form\".

From §348a-b, fdw jpw nTrw aHaw Hr Damw pt \"these four gods who stand on the sky’s electrum staves\", it is clear that the staves are the four staves supporting the sky, and the four four gods who Dsr/aHa/Hms/twA on these staves are keepers of the sky’s staves. The passages about staves cited above suggested that the collocations aHa Hr ~ Hmsj Hr, lit. \"stand up on\" and \"sit upon\", have the meaning \"be in charge of, wield\", for to \"sit on\" or to \"stand (up) on\" a staff would be meaningless and odd. For the meaning of Hmsj Hr, cf. CT VII, 338c, 518n: jnk Hms Hr jrt Hrw \"I am the one who is in charge of Horus’s eye\" (\"who sits on Horus’s eye\" doesn’t make sense at all). For the meaning of aHa Hr, cf CT IV, 59q: npr aHa(.w) Hr tp N pn \"Grain is in charge of this N’s head\" (\"Grain has stood on this N’s head\" doesn’t make sense at all); Leb. 51-54: wAH jb.k bA.j sn.j r"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" 329xprt jwaw.j drp.tj.fj, aHa.tj.fj Hr HAt hrw qrs, sAy.f Hnkyt nt Xrt nTr \"Be favorable (lit. let your heart last), my ba, my brother, until my heir has come into being, who will feed, who will be in charge of the mastaba on the day of burial\"; Manassa, Underworld, p. 125 (the reading is by the present author): nmtyw iryw nmt aHayw Hr qn mwtw \"O slaughterers, who are attached to the slaughtering places, who are in charge of the punishment of the dead\".

Both words are spelled same and have the sign {foxhide}-F27/28 that occurs in the second copy of this passage in Pepi’s pyramid This title is usually written in a pair with the title mdw rxt \"the walking-stick (i.e. patron) of rxt-people\" (Jones, Titles, # 1698). On this ground it has been suggested that knmwt in the title is a class of people just like rxt-people. For the reason of the {bird} sign that occurs after knmwt in §1226e PM it has been suggested to read this word as \"blackbird\". It is notable that the same {bird} sign occurs after the name of a snake in §429a W: hkrt-{bird}-{snake}. knmwt with the {bird} sign also occurs with uncertain meaning in CT VII, 53r: jj.n N pn xr.k wab(.w) m knmwt \"This N has come to you having become clean in knmwt\". 4) §1464a: pjpj pw jns pr m Ast dSr pr m nbt-Hwt Allen \"Pepi is the red linen that came and the redness that came from Nephthys\" Shmakov \"Pepi is the pink-colour that came from Isis (and) the redness that came from Nephthys\" jns is just \"the pink stuff\", evidently having the root of jnsj \"pink cloth\", hence the {fringed cloth}-S28 determinative in §1464a Pb, but the following line (\"Pepi is the redness which issued form Nephthys\") suggests it refers to menstruation blood (cf. the {pouring liquid} determinative after dSr of §1464a M) and/or the sun’s color at dawn rather than linen. Thus the passage is probably about the Sun’s birth/rise, considering previous lines and the following §1464c: \"Pepi is the Sun’s replacement\" and §1465d-e: \"This Pepi will rise in the eastern side of the sky like the Sun who rises in the eastern side of the sky\". 5) §1463e: nj qnjt jrt Hrw Allen \"when Horus’s eye had not yet been gouged out\" Shmakov \"when Horus’s eye had not yet been cut by half\" The verb has the {halfmoon} sign as the determinative, and Kurt Sethe also noticed this while translating PT for the Wb. (see http://aaew2.bbaw.de/tla/index.html, document DZA 30.390.410 \"Halbmond\"). Thus we probably have a metaphor \"reduced, cut by half\" that refers to the gouging out of Horus’s eye, like \"untied\" (sAd) is used to refer to the pulling off of Seth’s testicles. Cf. CT IV, 232a-236a: jw mH.n.j jrt m-xt Xqs.s hrw pw n aHA rHwj...m-xt wdt.f sTA m Hr.f \"I have filled the eye after it was reduced on the day of the fighting of the two Comrades, after he did harm to (lit. against) his face\".

Note the determinative {half-bent downward directed arm with pointing index finger} (bit like an empty D248) that occurs in the words having the meaning of accusation: xbn \"accuse, charge\", xbnt \"accusation\" (§§462b, 1041d, Leclant, Pepi I, pl.

E., 24.9, where he joins the traditional treatment of such a construction as perfective passive participle with a following indirect genitive, a treatment that was not revised even in the second, revised, edition of his grammar released in 2010)40. The Pyramid Texts have examples of perfect with final double reed-panicle spelled out in case of 3rd-weak verbs. The seven examples attested in the Pyramid Texts are: §§302c T (djj.n), 334a T (nhjj.n.f), Jéquier, Pepi II, pl.7, col. 709+33 = §334a (nhjj.n), 1111a P (Sdjj.n), Jéquier, Pepi II, pl.11, col.1013 (H(w)jj.n.f), 1248b N (wdjj.n.f) and Nt 833 (Hnjj.n(.j)) (see also Allen, Inflection, §§65B and 450 (Allen gives here only four examples of final double reed-panicle in perfect); Edel, Alta. Gr., §§533, 540). Moreover, such a spelling occurs outside the PT: Urk.I:217:16, 218:16: jn jw mrjj.n.Tn Hz Tn nswt \"Do you want the king to praise you?\" (cf. ibid:205:2, 205:12, 218:8 with sDm.f: jn jw mrjj.Tn Hz Tn nswt), ibid:232:10: mrjj.n Hm(.j) wDA.f wrt \"My Incarnation has wanted him to be very sound\". The same double reed-panicle may be present in perfect relative forms as the BD passage above shows, thus the common O.K. expression mrjj n Y Hzjj n Z may actually be mrjj.n Y Hzjj.n Z, e.g. in the most common mrjj.n jt(j).f Hzjj.n mwt.f \"the one whom his father loves (and) his mother praises\" or, if to follow Allen, \"the one whom his father desired (and) his mother blessed\" (ibid:76:15-16, 79:4, 6, 109:17, 122:3-4, 143:4-5, 145:17-146:1, 197:6, 255:8, 263:7). We also should take into account the fact that sometimes this expression is spelled with relative perfective, jnk mrjj (j)t(j).f Hzjj mwt(.f) (ibid:216:6), and is followed with relative phrase mrr snw.f (snwt.f) \"whom his brothers (and sisters) love\" (ibid:122:3-5, 197:6, 255:8 and 145:17-146:2). Other variants of this expression are: Urk.I:152:2-3: jnk mrjj.n nb.f Hzjj.n HqAw.f \"I am the one whom his lord loved (and) his rulers praised\" Kanawati-Raziq, Geref, pl.53: Hzjj.n nswt mrjj.n r(m)T nb \"the one whom the king praised (and) all people loved\" Against the treating of mrjj in this construction as perfective passive participle is the spelling with only one reed-panicle: mrj.n-kA.f \"the one whom his ka loves\"41 (Duell, Mereruikai, pl.113). However, such writings as Hzjjt nt Hwt-Hr \"Hathor’s favourite\" (Jones, Titles, #2407) contradict Allen’s and the present author’s reading and suggest that we need to read mrjj n ra \"Sun’s beloved\".

Moreover, such a construction (god’s name plus following verb) normally contains an imperative (cf. §§275e-f, 519c,   40 James Allen also reads PT 684, §2059b as having relative perfect: pjpj nfr-kA-ra wa jm.sn Hzjj.n kA pt \"Pepi Neferkare is one of them, whom the sky’s bull has blessed\" (Allen, P.

Just like in the spelling of jmntt in the discussed passage, the name smntt has two t’s, and it is clear that the first t belongs to the root of the noun (j)mnt \"west\", while the second t is that of the (nominalized) participle, and the initial s should be a causative prefix. Thus we probably have something like s.(j)mnt.t \"Westernizer\", \"She who makes to become a westerner\"; compare it with s.xAj \"darken\" (§1151c) (from the root xAw \"evening\"), s.dwA, and s.mSr (CT III, 96k-97a (BqC)) – causatives with uncertain meaning from the roots dwA \"morning\" and mSr \"evening\".

This definition roots in the idea that the pDwt 9 in this and other passages of the Pyramid Texts would be the same as the traditional term for the neighbors–enemies of Egypt, but the term psDt pDwt in the current passage (and in others) probably refers to the sky’s arcs which are often referred to as just psDt \"Nine\" (§§161a, 163a, 164c,e, 165b, 165d, 166b,d, 794a, 1238c, 2158c, Jéquier, Pepi II, pl.14, col. +74) or pDwt \"arcs\" (see W 151, P 31, 1).

PT 672, §1989b: nD.j Hr.k pjpj nfr-kA-ra \"I greet you, Pepi Neferkare\"), but he is incorrect on the verb’s meaning and the meaning of Hr. Hr is not a preposition as in a collocation nD Hr \"inquire about\". We can find examples in the texts which show that Hr was actually the noun \"face\", like in the discussed passage, in which we have Hr n \"face of\" (for we cannot have Hr \"on\" and genitive or preposition \"to, for\" in a row). The verb nD probably has its basic meaning \"tend\" in the expression. Thus j.nD(.j) Hr.k N was an idiom for \"Greetings, Hail to\" with the probable literal meaning \"I have tended50 your face, N\" (probably a perfective sDm.f, not a subjunctive (\"May I...\") as James Allen suggested). As to the idiomatic meaning of the literal reading (\"tend someone’s face\"), compare the expression wDa-mdw \"judge\", which literally is probably \"separate/cut the words\". Cf. the full spelling of the word face in §186b (Hr-r-k) instead of that with a {stroke}, cf. also PT 677, §2019c: nD.t(j) Hr.f jn Hrw m Axt \"his face is tended by Horus in the Behind the Horizon\"   50 However, the literal meaning \"I have inquired after your face (i.e. after your mood?)\" cannot be ruled out taking into account the meaning of nD in such word-combinations as nD sxr \"inquire after the condition\" and nD xrt \"greet, inquire after the state\"."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":" 373 Hr in the passage is written with the {stroke} sign for ideograms, not in full form (when r is written out) which is the case when preposition Hr comes with a suffix.

Thus Pepi’s and Neith’s (Nt 491) versions have Swwt.k tp qaHwj.k \"your plumage on your elbows\". The sign {cup with smoke and stylized fire} is used in the verb qaH in §§470c, 914a, 1432b. Pepi’s version of the sign in §914a and burial chamber, south wall, col. 76 undoubtedly represents {cup with smoke} (cf. its determinative in Urk.I:124:14, 126:1; CT V, 103c (Sq2Sq) which is {smoke}-Q7b).

Urk.IV:114:9: baba.k m xr(j)t jb.k \"you will exult (baba) at (m) the state of your heart\", followed by Urk.IV:114:17: xntS.k m a(w)t.k nbt \"you will marvel (xntS) at (m) (the state) of all your limbs\" There is a transitive verb baba which does have the meaning \"drink, slurp\", but we should not confuse it with the intransitive verb used in the discussed passage:"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":" 390(Naville I, BD 134:11; Naville II, BD 134:11, Aa) wab.f m snf.tn baba.f dSrw.tn \"He will become clean in your blood, he will slurp your gore\" This BD spell alters between abab \"become purified\" and baba \"slurp\" as is shown by another version of the spell (ASAE 63, pp. 51-78): wab.f m snf.tn abab.f m dSrw.tn \"He will become clean in your blood, he will become purified (abab) in your gore\" 2) Nt 833-35: Hnjj.n(.j) Tw jm.k nznznw wDa(.j) sAj.k Hrw <js> jmj pr.f...s.kA.n(.j) jt(j) Azx.n(.j) bdt Allen \"they will service you, so that you will not pass away.

If the Egyptians would not have written these epithets after Neith’s name (and would only have written them separately), many would be tempted to think that we have here two different deities evidently distinct from Neith. But fortunately, the Egyptians combined name and epithets in some instances, so that if we ever find these epithets written separately, we will know that Neith is meant and not an unknown god. Likewise written together is the combination jnpw xnt(j) jmntjw \"Anubis, Foremost of the Westerners\", occurring six times in the PT corpus (§§57d, 220c, 745a, 1833c, 2198b (= Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 22, col. 49), Leclant, Pepi I, pl. II B, col. 52) and once xnt(j) jmntjw has a {Anubis-jackal} determinative (§592b MN, Nt 442). Moreover, the combination occurs in the mastaba of Iidjefa (jj-DfA \"Provision has come\", L.D.II:101, a): Htp Dj nswt jnpw xnt(j) (j)mntjw \"A royal offering of Anubis, at the fore of the Westerners\", the mastaba of Duahip(ui) (dwA-Hjp(wj) \"The one who adores the Apis-bull\", Mariette, Mast., D59, p.336): Htp Dj jnpw xnt(j) (j)mntjw \"An offering which gives Anubis, at the fore of the Westerners\", and the mastaba of Akhetihotepi (Davies, Ptahhetep I, pl. 21): jmAxw...xr jnpw xnt(j) jmntjw \"Honored regarding...Anubis at the fore of the Westerners\". See also references in Jones, Titles, ## 66, 67, and cf. Dümichen, Resultate, pl. 14: wnn jmAx.f xr jnpw xnt(j) jmntjw \"his honor will be regarding Anubis at the fore of the Westerners\". Based on these instances it is suggested here that there was no separate deity hiding behind that epithet (a deity that originally would have been worshipped at Abydos in Dynasty I, and later transformed into an epithet of Osiris), as usually is presumed, but that Anubis always was Foremost of the Westerners, and that he is the deity on the famous Abydos cylinder seal. There is a rare Anubis’ epithet that supports this suggestion: Neferseshemre refers to himself in his mastaba as mAa Hr jb jnpw nb jmnt \"rightful in the opinion (lit. on the heart) of Anubis, lord of the West\" (pl. 44), and the same epithet occurs in the mastaba of Mererurkai, pl. 204, B: jmAxw xr jnp nb jmnt \"Honored regarding Anubis, lord of the West\" and in Jéquier, Tomb. part., p. 106. Compare also PT 665B, Nt 730: xftjw rDjw.n n.k jnpw xnt(j) zH nTr m wdt.f Tw nt pw xnt(j) jmntjw \"your opponents that Anubis at the fore of the god’s booth gave you when he put you, Neith, at the fore of the Westerners\" – only Anubis who himself is at the fore of the Westerners could put the queen at their fore. Likewise, Sed (sd) and Path Discerner (wp wAwt) are supposed to be one and the same god, wp wAwt being an epithet and not the name of an independent god. In fact, this is a case in which the epithet (wp wAwt) was used more widely than the name (cf. Brovarski E. J. (1984) \"Sed\", LÄ V: 779-80; Hm-nTr sd, Hm-nTr-priest of Sed – Jones, Titles, no. 2133, page 581). The reason why Anubis had the epithet xnt(j) jmntjw should be clear: Anubis was the original god of the dead while Osiris received this epithet only when he got worshipped at the same level as Anubis. It is important to notice that Osiris got the original epithet of Anubis as equal divinity, rather than by forcing Anubis out and hence appropriating his epithet. Andrey Bolshakov writes in his book (quote translated into English by the present author): \"Early monuments do not mention the name Js.t-jr.t at all, it occurs only in the texts of the pyramid of Wnjs. In tombs of Giza its mention occurs only on the boundary of dynasties V and VI (see Junker, Giza IV, p. 18), in Saqqare slightly earlier, possibly at"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":" 392Jzzj, but, anyway, later than N(j)-wsr-ra(w) (cp. [Bolshakov, 1992]). Before that point in time, the domination of the primordial god of the dead Jnp(w) is absolute, but then Js.t-jr.t gradually gains importance at the expense of Jnp(w), until at the end of the Old Kingdom Js.t-jr.t is mentioned approximately as often as Jnp(w)\" (Bolshakov, A man and his ka, p. 104). 2) The god \"He of the Atfet district (12th U.E. nome)\" (Atftj) (§§461d, 1358d) is probably the god Nemti (nmtj, \"He of the (sky’s) span (?)\"), see the stela of the M.K. – Bruxelles E.2161: Hr wDHw n nmtj nb Atft \"from the offering table of Nemti, lord of the Atfet-district\". The name of Nemti is written with the sign G7b {falcon in a boat} on the stela. It is also notable that Henku, who was a nomarch of the Atfet-district, was \"honored regarding Nemti\" jmAxw xr...nmtj (Urk.I:76:10-11). The present author came to this conclusion independently from Dylwin Jones, who writes \"Nemty (the god of U.E. 12)\" (Jones, Titles, ## 1295, 1381), unfortunately without any reference on how this conclusion was arrived at. 3) The name of the goddess nxbt that occurs in §§1229c, 1451a, b and Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 9, col. 8, and that is a participle, is evidently distinct from the nisbe-name nxb(j)t “Nekheb-resident”, see Wb.II:308:14-15. The name of “Nekheb-resident” is spelled in the Old Kingdom exactly like in §696d (see also Jones, Titles, ## 1969, 1970, Hm-nTr nxb(j)t) – with the nxb-{rush}-M22 sign that always comes first, b complement and {village} sign after it, whereas nxbt is spelled with the phonetic nxb-{brazier with smoke rising}-Q7 sign or a {smoke}-Q7b sign (cf. Junker, Giza III, p. 129, Abb.14, the determinative of rkH \"lighting (festival)\"; Junker, Giza V, p. 97, Abb.26, second register, the determinative of the word ax \"braizer\"; Block of Izi (I.1.b.322 (4050) = Berlev, Stelae, p. 29 (1:E)): the determinative of rkH \"lighting (festival)\" and the word ax \"braizer\"; Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 4:3, ideogram (?) in t (A)S(r) \"roasted bread\", the determinative in ASrt \"roasted meat), with n-x-b complements spelled before it. (Of course, the fire sign Q7 resembles the plant sign M22). Moreover, “Nekheb-resident” is determined in the Old Kingdom texts with {vulture on basket}-G14a sign, whereas nxbt in §1229c is just determined with {vulture} sign. Finally, “Nekheb-resident” does not occur with the epithet given to Nekhbet in §1451b: Hr(j)t jb Hwt sr jmjt jwnw \"she who (is) in the midst of the Judge’s Enclosure in Heliopolis\". The meaning of the name nxbt is \"Lighter, Illuminating one\", cf. the name nxbw with nxb-{brazier with the smoke rising} sign (Urk.I:215), which also has the meaning \"Lighter\" (for this see W 170, 3). 4) Allen \"Firstborn’s Thing (jxt wtt). jxt/xt wtt is probably actually jxt wtt(t) \"Firstborn Thing\", with the third genitive t being left out to avoid three t’s in a row; cf. wtt(tj) \"two firstborn goddesses\" in §902b (cf. Allen, M. E., 17.2, 2S, 3FS, ommited suffixes in nxt.(tj) and m(w)t.(tj)); also Urk.IV:362:4: wtt(t).n ra \"she whom the Sun begot\"). Cf. also CT where the goddess is also designated as wtt \"Firstborn one\" (CT I, 186e) and the designation for another goddess as jxt wrt \"Great thing\" (§198b, c), which shows that wtt(t) of jxt wtt(t) describes jxt and is not a separate \"firstborn one\". 5) The name of the god Andjety (anDtj) has the meaning \"He of the Land of Dawn\": anD(j)t is feminine nisbe of the noun anD \"dawn\", thus \"locality of dawn\", and anDtj is the masculine nisbe of this nisbe. 6) Allen \"god’s two countrysides (spAtj nTr, §§1120b, 1394c, 1561d, 1770c). "},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":" 393The term \"God’s Two Districts\" seems to be the designation for the sky or Nut, cf. PT 509, §1120a-b: mdw pt sdA tA nmnm gbb nhmhm spAtj nTr \"The sky has spoken, the earth has trembled, Geb has quaked, the God’s Two Districts have yelled\" (the latter combination also occurs in §§1394c: nhmhm spAtj nTr and 1561d: nhmhmw n.f spAtj <nTr>). The four lines of this passage clearly form two pairs of parallels: one about the trembling earth/quaking Geb, the other about the speaking sky/yelling spAtj nTr. Note that the action performed by the \"God’s Two Districts\", namely \"yelling\", is often performed by the sky in the PT (see T 145). Moreover, cf. §1770c: rDj n.f spAtj nTr \"the God’s Two Districts have been given to him\" with §§479b: rDj pt n wnjs \"the sky has been given to Unis\", 961a: rDj n.k pt and 1010b: Dj n.k pt \"the sky has been given to you\". Neferkare’s version of §1561d also makes sense: hAw spAtj nTr n pjpj nfr-kA-ra \"the God’s Two Districts have descended for Pepi Neferkare\", i.e. the sky has lowered for Pepi that he may easily ascend it. 7) The god whose name James Allen translates as \"Thighs-Forward\" probably has a name with another meaning. The spellings of §§285a, 1015a N, 1719c cast doubt on the correctness of Allen’s interpretation, for these spellings are xnt(j) mjnt.f, and whereas the j is a mark of mjnj \"moor\", it does not occur in the word for \"thigh\", mnt. Admittedly, the name occurs in the PT with {thighs} determinative, but this probably is nothing but a graphical (or phonetical?) influence of the word mnt \"thigh\", and we probably should understand this determinative as a secondary one. Thus the name of the god probably has the meaning xnt(j) mjnwt.f \"Foremost of His Mooring Posts\". 8) The epithet nTr nfr \"Young God\" or \"Junior/Younger God\" used for Kings is the opposite of the epithet nTr aA \"Senior God\" or \"Elder God\" that is employed for the Sun and Osiris (and other gods). A King is the Young Sun on the earth, son of the Senior Sun in the sky. Oleg Berlev was the first who showed this in his article \"Dva Caria, Dva Solnca\" [\"Two Kings, Two Suns\"], Stephen Quirke (ed.), Discovering Egypt from the Neva: The Egyptological Legacy of Oleg D. Berlev, Berlin, 2003. pp. 1–18; in Russian at http://www.egyptology.ru/berlev/2-2.pdf). See also Berlev, Stelae, p.37, note b, Berlev (together with Svetlana I. Hodjash), Several Middle Kingdom Stelae of the Moscow Fine Arts Museum, p. 11-12, note 47 (http://static.egyptology.ru/sharing/berlev/Berlev_Several%20Middle%20Kingdom%20Stelae.pdf). To the evidence produced by Berlev the present author can add the O.K. title xrp apr nfr(w) \"manager of a crew of young recruit(s)\", in which nfr has the {child}-A17 sign as the determinative (Jones, Titles, # 2575) and CT I, 12d: nTr pn rnpw nfr jmj \"this young (and) the most (jmj) junior god\" (Th.T.319 has nTr pn nfr jmj \"this youngest god\"). Moreover, in the mastaba of Merefnebef (Myśliwiec, Merefnebef) the owner has four names and he enumerates all of them in four horizontal lines of his facade lintel: rn.f wr mr.f-nb.f \"his great name is Merefnebef (He loves his lord)\", rn.f nfr ffj \"his junior name is Fefi\", rn.f nDs wnjs-anx(.j) \"his younger (or little) name is Unisankhi ((the king) Unis is alive)\", rn.f aA mr.f-nb.f \"his elder name is Merefnebef (He loves his lord)\". Here rn nDs51 \"little (or junior) name\" is opposed to rn wr \"great name\"; rn nfr \"junior name\" probably refers to how man was called since he was young (nfr), while rn aA \"elder name\" refers to how he was called when he has become adult (aA) and is normally solemn and includes a king’s name. Hence we have two pairs of anthonyms: nDs / wr and nfr / aA, where nDs ~ nfr, wr ~ aA52.   51 The sign is nDs (G37, the tail is rounded), not wr (G36, the tail is forked), nDs in Merefnebef’s tomb is also clear on account of the lack of the r phonetic complement below it. 52 In his work Berlev refers to antonymous pairs rn aA and rn nfr (James, Khentika, p.12, 67. pl.28; Kanawati-Hassan, Ankhmahor; p.2, 29. pl.36; Kanawati-Raziq, Neferseshemre, p.11. pl.58; Davies, Ptahhetep II, pl.26 (upper register); Mariette, Mast., D43, p.297; Hassan, Giza II, fig.208, p.175; Hassan, Giza III, fig.107, p.122; Junker, Giza VIII, p.61, Abb.18, p. 69 and p. 79, Abb.34, Abb.51, Abb.89), rn aA and rn nDs (Hassan, Giza V, fig.141., p.281; Mariette, Mast., D.11., p.201, E.8., p.399-400; Davies, Ptahhetep II, pl. 24 (upper register)) and comes to the conclusion nfr ~ nDs."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":" 394Cf. also nautical terms: jmj-nfrt, nfrt is probably a variant of jmj-nDst, nDst \"stern\" (jmj-wrt \"starboard\", tA-wr \"larboard\", wADt \"prow\"). 9) The name Tefnut (tfnt/tfnwt) probaly has the meaning \"Sneezed one\" (or \"Sneezer\"?) as it has the root tfn \"sneez\" (cf. the determinative of tfnt in CT VI, 126d (T2L)). The w that occurs in the spelling tfnwt must be the ending of a perfective passive (Allen, M. E., 23.5) (of a noun of agent? cf. P 479, Allen, ibid). 10) The name Nefertum, nfr-tm(.j) (since the M.K. nfr-tm(.w)), has the meaning \"The beautiful/young one is complete\" (subject-stative construction). Compare it with Osiris’s epithet wnn nfr(.w) \"He who exists (in a state of being) young\". 11) Axt \"Behind the Horizon, the Transhorizontal (realm/area)\" Axt is literally \"effective place\" – it was an area behind the visible line of the horizon from which the Sun rose (see Allen, M. E., Essay 2, p. 21; Allen \"The Egyptian Concept of the World\" (in Mysterious Lands, edited by David O’Connor and Stephen Quirke), p. 27: \"The Akhet, often loosely translated “horizon”, was a liminal zone between the Duat and the visible horizon. It represents the Egyptian explanation for the fact that light remains for some time after the sun has set and appears before the sun has risen\"). In the Old Kingdom there is a notion of only one Axt in the east of the sky, in the Middle Kingdom occurs a notion of a western (jmnt(j)t, Berlin 24031, BM 159, Louvre C 3) and thus an eastern \"Behind the Horizon\". Foreigners from Wadi Hammamat (i. e. from the south-east of Egypt) were called Axtjw \"those of the Behind the Horizon\" (Urk.I:128:16, 130:1; Couyat-Montet, Hammamat, p. 98), i. e. dwellers of a distant region (= \"behind the horizon\", i. e. invisible for human), while Wadi Hammamat itself was called tA Axtjw \"the land of those of the Behind the Horizon\" (ibid). The present author is thankful to Marina Sokolova who invented the term \"Behind the Horizon\" (\"Zagorizont’e (Загоризонтье)\" in Russian). 12) Allen, Glossary (p. 426) \"Bakhu (bAXw). Mounting region in which the sun sets\" In the New Kingdom Bakhu is doubtless the eastern horizon from which the sun rises (Wb.I:422:9). Probably we have the same concept of Bakhu in PT. 13) Allen, Glossary (p. 429): \"Dual Crown (sxmtj). The Red Crown and White Crown united\" James Allen doesn’t give a literal reading of sxmtj, which is \"Dual (female) Power-bearers\". 14) Allen, The Pyramid Texts of Unis (p. 16): \"the so-called “Cannibal Hymn” (Spell 180), through which the spirit absorbed the essence and power of all the forces of the universe\" Allen’s explanation of the meaning of the \"Cannibal Hymn\" is accurate. There is a work by Olga Zubova which shares almost the same idea (the original is in Russian)): \"Utterance 273/274 of The Pyramid Texts (the so-called “Cannibal Hymn”): An attempt of Exegesis\", published in Trudi Gosudarstvennogo Ermitaga XLV.

We can observe a similar notion in the Chapter XI of Bhagavad Gita (XI, 20-30), in the well known apparition of Arjuna\". In chapter eleven Krishna is beseeched by Arjuna to reveal his universal form showing all of existence. Thus this chapter is entitled: The Vision of the Universal Form: [20] \"Verily the space between the heavens and the earth and all directions are pervaded by You alone; O greatest of all, by seeing this wonderful and terrible form of Yours, the three worlds tremble with fear [21] Verily all these groups of demigods are entering into You, some of them out of fear are offering prayers with folded hands saying all glory...

Originally, the nine gods incorporating the physical creation of the world: Atum; Shu and Tefnut; Geb and Nut; Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys, known as the Big Ennead (psDt aAt); also a term for any number of gods conceived as a group, and for all the gods as a whole. The Big Ennead also represented the gods of Lower Egypt, in contrast to the Elder Ennead (psDt wrt), also known as the Little Ennead (psDt nDst), which consisted of the gods of Upper Egypt. Together, these two Ennead were known as the Dual Ennead (psDtj).\" The Elder Ennead (psDt aAt) was first of all considered as Heliopolis’s Ennead (cf. §§14c, 770d, 845b, 895b, 1655a, 1660a; CT V, 208b; Meir II, pl. 6; Budge, BD151:11 (first version), BD151:8-9 (second version)) or as Atum’s Ennead (cf. CT II, 18f: psDt aAt zAt jtm, 22b: psDt aAt tm, 52i: psDt aAt n(t) tm) rather than as the Ennead that represented the gods of Lower Egypt. The Great Ennead (psDt wrt) was also located in Heliopolis, §1689c: jn psDtj wrt aAt xnt(j)t(j) bAw jwnw \"say the Great and Elder Enneads that are at the fore of the bas of Heliopolis\", and probably was headed by Geb. 16) Allen, Glossary (p. 426): \"Apis (Hpw).

"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":" 396Phonetic notes and notes on signs 1) The sign Aa1 has two main colors in the Old Kingdom inscriptions: green (most often) and yellow – exactly the two possible colors of {reed panicle}-M17, {reed basket}-V30 and {reed mat}-Q3. For example, in the mastaba of Merib (IV dynasty, L.D.II.19, 21) both Aa1 and V30 are yellow with red traces, and for a yellow {reed panicle}-M17 (the color of dry reed), see Manuelian, Slab Stelae. Moreover, {reed basket}-V30 has the same horizontal traces which we can see in Aa1. Color and pattern, together with a sometimes visible wattled ornament (cf. Abu-Bakr, Giza, page 34, fig. 28), all speak in favor of the idea that Aa1 would be a {reed basket lid}, as was suggested in Hannig’s dictionary (Hannig, Wb, p.1101) and in Borghouts’Ancient Egyptian grammar (vol. II, p. 62, note 296). 2) The sign V97 is used in the Old Kingdom as a determinative for \"First (day) of the year and New Year festivals\" (tpj rnpt wp rnpt), \"Thoth festival\" (DHwtjt), \"Supplying festival\" (wAg, §§820a, 1880b, 2185b), \"Flourishing festival\" (s.(w)AD), \"Great festival\" (HAb wr), rkH \"Burning festival\" (Mariette, Mast., C3, p.116), \"gift\" (Hnkt, §101c, Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 64:67, 72:71, 105:104), \"god’s offering\" (Htp nTr, §115c M), \"(first day of) monthly festival\" ((tp) Abd, Mariette, Mast., C3, p. 116, D40, p. 284), \"(first day of) half-monthly festival\" ((tp) mDdjwnt, ibid), \"everything sweet\" (xt nb(t) bn(j)t, Hassan, Giza VI, Part II, pl. 32:29), and \"every fresh provisions\" (rnpt nb(t), ibid). This sign is an image of a {wickerwork box} or {hamper}. It is this box that is carried full of gifts by servants on the relief L.D.II:25 (= Junker, Giza II, p. 181, Abb.27), it is carried by one servant on the left thickness of the mastaba of Sekhemkai (L.D.II:89), it is used as a container (as it is written in the square for containers) for xt nb(t) bnjt rnpt nb(t) Hknw \"every sweet thing, every (kind of) vegetable, gifts: one box\" in the offering-list on the image L.D.II:70, it is carried full of gifts by women-servants in the mastaba of Niankhhnum and Khnumhotepi (Moussa-Altenmüller, Niankhhnum, Tf. 66, 67; the women are labeled as follows: Tf. 66: the woman with the box full of rolls Hbnnwt n Xnm-Htp(.j) \"rolls for Hnumhetepi\"; Tf. 67: the woman with the box full of bread pDw n Xnm-Htp(.j) \"bread halves for Hnumhetepi\", the woman with the box full of birds Apd nb n Xnm-Htp(.j) \"all (kinds of) bird for Khnumhetepi\"), it is carried by a woman in the mastaba of Raweri (Hassan, Giza I, pl. 6B) and the tomb chapel of Raemkai (MMA 08.201.1b), by men and women in the mastaba of Neferi (Abu-Bakr, Giza, 52 fig. 38), and a kneeling priest is shown placing his hand palms down on the box-V97 in the mastaba of Sankhuiptah (pl. 67(or 71)) and others, (Duell, Mereruikai (pl. 61c (partly destroyed), 67); Kanawati-Raziq, Watetkhethor, (chamber B5, north and south reliefs of the west wall); Meritety (pl. 19, register 4, pl.49-50); Kaiemankh (hands of the priest are in the box, Junker, Giza IV, p. 23, Abb.7); Duauvashi (hands of the priest are in the box, Hassan, Giza IX, fig. 23, p. 54)). To judge by its appearances the sign is a variant of the signs Aa17 and Aa18, which are explained in Gardiner’s grammar as \"back of something\" and in Allen’s grammar closer to the truth as \"lid\". The closest correspondence of the sign is to the sign Aa18, with as only difference a {handle} (?) being attached to the lid of the box in the sign Aa18 (a handle that also appears in {harpoon} sign T21). Gustave Jéquier was probably the first who reached the same conclusion about what the sign represents (Jéquier, Note). Hermann Junker also writes about the sign’s representation: Junker, Giza IV, p. 24 – \"V97-Kasten\". Finally Edward Brovarski mentions it in Brovarski, Boxes, p. 32, notes 9 and 10. On the facade lintel of the mastaba of Merefnebef (Myśliwiec, Merefnebef) the sign determines \"Thoth festival\" (DHwtjt) and \"Supplying festival\" (wAg) and is carved in its variant form – Q6A {box}. In the mastaba of Nisedjerkai (n–sDr-kA(.j)) the sign has three pots on the lid (which in Egyptian graphic conventions means that the pots are inside of the chest). "},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":" 3973) The sign {knotted cloth}-S23 actually has the phonetic value of dm, not dmD as grammars teach us (Allen, M. E., Sign List, p. 441; Gardiner, E.G., Sign List, p. 506). This is shown by the fact that the sign is used in the verb dm \"penetrate, pierce\" (§§392a, 603a T, 962a), \"sharpen\" (§962a), \"pronounce (name)\" (Urk.IV:257:16, 260:15-16) and for the writing of the name Dem (dm, spelled d-S23-m, d-m-S23, one of the sons of Ti, Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 17-19). It is also indicated by the regular spelling of the final D (later d) hieroglyph in the verb dmD during the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, to make a distinction between the verbs dm and dmD \"unite\" (exceptional cases of dmD being written without D are §§279a W, 577b M, 835b P, 1023b P, 1475a P). The sign dm enclosed in d and m, i. e. d-S23-m, occurs in §§123b, 279a T, 318a, 577b N, 617b T, 623b TPM, 635a TPM, 645a TPM, 577b N, 835b PM, 961c P, 1801b; S23 after dm and before D, i. e. dm-S23-D, occurs in §§623b N, 961c M. 4) In the Old Kingdom the verb mnx \"to chisel, carve\" sometimes is determined with the {tubular drill} U27 sign (Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 119-120; the tomb of Iymery, Weeks, Cemetery G 6000, p. 34 {2.28}, fig. 30, pl. 13). From this we may deduce that the sign U27 probably did not represent a {tubular drill} in the Old Kingdom, but rather a {chisel carving a chink}. For in the mentioned relief in the mastaba of Ti (Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 119-120), the verb mnx is four times determined with a {chisel}-U23 sign, without a chink under it, and twice with the {chisel carving a chink} sign (looks like U27). 5) The sign {rope}-V12 that is used in the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms as a determinative for the word dAb \"figs\" (§§91d, 1511b; Manuelian, Slab Stelae, pl. 5-6; Petrie, Medum, pl.20) is written in the Old Kingdom more precisely as {a rope with figs threaded on it} (see Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 3, in the village name dAb Tjj \"Ti’s figs\"; Manuelian, Slab Stelae, pl. 3-4, 11-12; Mariette, Mast., D41, p. 286). Selim Hassan writes about it: “Dried figs, pierced by a central hole for threading on a string, were found by Petrie in the Tomb of King Dn at Abydos...Such figs, threaded on a string, are undoubtedly represented by the sign...which frequently determines the entry of figs in the offering list” (S. Hassan, Excavations at Giza, Cairo, 1934-1935, Volume 6.2). 6) The sign {throw-stick} T14 has a phonetic value THn and is not “Ideogram for THnw \"Libya\"” as James Allen (Allen, M. E., Sign List, p. 443) labels it, for it is used in the word THnnt and THn \"glister\" (§§561d, 699c MN) where the sign is enclosed in THn (TH-T14-nnt). When it is used with nw-{pot} to write THnw \"Libya\" the model is the same as with the word rmnwtj \"companion\" where the {arm with shoulder}-rmn sign is written with half-complementary nw sign as well (rmn-nw-tj \"companion\", THn-nw \"Libya\"). Moreover, in Kanawati-Raziq, Hesi, pl.64, HAt(j)t nt THnw \"The best of Libyan oil\" is spelled without nw sign, i. e. just TH-T14-{three pellets}, which can be explained if the sign T14 has a phonetic value THn and the nw complement is thus unnecessary. 7) The sign R9 is usually explained as a composition of the signs R8 and V33, i. e. {cloth wound on pole with one end loose} and {bag}, because of the word sTj \"scent\" in which V33 is the determinative. However, in the Old Kingdom, the sign R9 can undoubtedly represent a composition of the signs R8 and {incense pellet with stylized fire or smoke} as well, see Murray, Saq. Mas., pl. 3; Junker, Giza II, p. 155, Abb. 21 (top reg.: snTr, sD(t) snTr; fifth reg from the top: bd); Manuelian, Slab Stelae, pl. 1-2 (note that the color of the {incense pellet} on which the sign R8 rests is the same black as is found with the {four little pellets} on the {cup} sign which is the determinative of snTr \"incense\"), pl. 5-6 (bd), pl. 7-8 (snTr, bd), pl. 23-24 (snTr); Petrie, Medum, pl.16, 20; L.D.II:3, 5 (snTr); Abu-Bakr, Giza, 52 fig. 38, 61 fig. 40, and detailed image on pl.38, sign 35 (Murray, Saq. Mas.). In the latter source , the sign"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":" 398R9 occurs in the title of Kaiemhzut xnt(j) Hwt snTr \"who is at the fore of the Incense’ Enclosure\", and what was interpreted as a bag is clearly a pellet, and the three lines which were interpreted as the ends of a bag are rather stylized fire or smoke (moreover, it is very strange to image the ends of a bag with three lines). The same lines represent stylized fire or smoke from the censers full of incense pellets on Plates 21 (third register, No 2 from the left) and 23 (first register, No 6 from the right (not clear), fifth register, No 2) from the mastaba of User Netjer. Moreover, sign R9 sometimes is carved without such lines (§§26f W, 27a, b, c, e W, 28b, c, 29a; Murray, Saq. Mas., pl.1), i. e., the hieroglyph represents R8 + {natron pellet}. But it needs to be emphasized that we just have three different ways in which the sign R9 is represented, so the above observations on the sign do not reject the accepted interpretation. The same lines were drown on the three \"petals\" of the sign Q7 {brazier with smoke rising} in the mastaba of Seneb (Junker, Giza V, p. 97, Abb.26, first register, determinative for the word ax \"braizer\"), which means that this sign on this wall actually represents {burning and smoking incense pellet} – the incense pellet is clearly drown in the middle of the sign, it is undoubtedly not a {brazier} as the brazier is drown in the second register (where also the word ax \"braizer\" occurs) in its archaic {rectangle} form (a variant of Q7F). As the brazier did have \"petals\" as is shown by §558a, it is almost impossible to say where Q7 is a {brazier with smoke rising} and where it is {burning and smoking incense pellet}, only when \"petals\" were drown with lines one can tell the difference. 8) The sign which is used as the determinative of the word wdr (~ jdr ~ dr) \"herd\" in §1467b (for w ~ j, cf. wpwtj ~ jpwtj \"messenger\" §1440c M) represents a {ox’s heart with vessels}. The latter sign occurs as the determinative of the same word jd(j) \"herd\" (a case of j ~ r) in the mastaba of Nisutnefer (actually Nineferisut n(j)-nfr(.j)-(n)swt \"My fairness belongs to the king\", Junker, Giza III, p. 181, Abb.27, Tf. VI). Cf. the same sign (only without blood vessels) as the determinative of the word HAt \"heart\" in the mastabas of Ti (Steindorff, Ti, Tf. 13, 127); Murray, Saq. Mas., pl.7 (bottom, left), pl.11; Kanawati-Hassan, Ankhmahor, pl. 49 (middle register, Dj HA(t) pn wn \"Give this heart, hurry up\"); Kanawati, Inumin, pl.52 (middle and bottom registers, r Sdt HA(t) pn \"to extract this heart\", Dj m(j) HAt(j) jf HA(t) \"give please the heart (and) fillet\"); Kanawati-Raziq, Nikauisesi, pl. 60 (Sd HAt pw \"Extract this heart!\"); L.D.II:67. Hearts of this form are depicted as being placed on the carcasses of oxen and oryxes in the mastaba of Mereruikai (Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 208 A, B; Mariette, Mast., D39, p.277 Sdt HA(t)). 9) The two signs which determine the word mntj \"thighs\" represent {crocodile’s hindlegs}, as is shown by the form and the long paws (see for example §§262a, 804c N, 1087c P, 1273c), cf. crocodile’s hindlegs in the mastaba of Mereruikai (Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 10-11). 10) In PT 422, §756c and PT 573, §1480a N occurs the verb s.nzn \"pull open\" – a causative from the prefixed root n.zn/zn \"open\". The authors of Wb. and James Allen do not recognize this, giving the verb form as s. zn (Wb.IV:274.5) and s. nz (Allen, Inflection, p. 591), but it is written s.nz(n) (not s.nz or (transposed) s.zn), with a {large block of stone} sign that is not the determinative (because the determinative for zn \"open\" is the {door-leaf} sign, cf. §796b), that looks very similar to N37, and that has a phonetic value zn (see §§739a-b (z(n)w), 984a P where it is enclosed in z-{block of stone}-n, also CT VI, 130f (M12C), Urk.IV:520:7). Because of the latter, the last n in s.nz(n) is not spelled; cf. the spelling of the beer-bread p(j)zn as pz(n), as the sign {oval bread}-X4 has the phonetic value zn. 11) In PT 440, §816b the word jdmj/dmj \"linen\" is written with a very rare sign, a variant of G142/143 – {falcon on standard which stands on a sandal} (G7 + horizontal S33). See the temple of king Sethy at"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":" 399Abydos (I: pl. 20, 28; II: pl. 8, 12, 16, 19), where it is written jdmj + the sign, with {sandal} sign carved much clearer than in §816b in the spells entitled r n Hbs m mnxt aAt \"spell of clothing in significant cloth\" and r n DbA mnxt HDt \"spell of dressing in white cloth\". 12) The sign {seat}-Q1 is used as a phonogram s in the verb Hms(j) \"seat\" (§§57c, 129b WN, 134b, 214b, 391c N, 473b N, 573b N, 873a N, 1680a N; Urk.IV:257:9) as the sign {vulva}-D280a has only phonetic value Hm, not as the verb’s determinative (the det. of the verb is {upper part of kneeling man}, {lower part of kneeling man (i.e., knees)} (cf. §§800d, 805b) or {portable seat} (cf. §§1093d, 1154b, 873a P). 13) Sometimes the Egyptian scribe just did not use signs that were seen as dangerous or impure. For example, PT do not use the {fish} sign, probably because of its impurity, i. e. its ability to rot and cause a bad smell (rather than being a danger). In such cases, the PT scribes used the {plant growing from a spring} sign (N22 + M2) as the determinative of the word bwt \"abomination\" (§§127c, d, 128a), instead of the more standard {fish}-K2 sign,as well as the aD {spool}-W25 sign in the title aD-mr \"governor\" (§804d), instead of the {mullet fish}-K3 sign that was employed in the O.K. mastabas. 14) The word which we know as jtn \"Sun Disc\" from the M.K. originally was spelled jTn (Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 8, col. 58). We thus have a development T > t in this word by the M.K., which means that the N.K. spelling jTn was a hypercorrect spelling. The toponym mdnjt \"Medenit nome\" was originally spelled mDnjt, for the sign {hoe} used in the spelling of this toponym (e.g., Urk.I:101:11, 105:13) has the phonetic value Dnj (the {hoe} sign comes from Dnj \"to dam\", cf. §278c T), as is shown by its occurrence in the spelling of the word Dnjt \"seventh-day meal\" (§716b T; CT III, 23b, c, 26a, 62d, 101c, 115d, k, 159a; also in Naville, Deir el Bahari IV, pl. 114 (dnjt < Dnjt)), so we may know that this toponym experienced a D > d transition. 15) Note that the god Dedun has the sign {bee-eater} (wADAD, §1017a) as determinative (cf. §§803c, 994d, 1476b M, 1718a M). 16) The toponym nxb \"Nekheb\" and the goddess name nxbt \"Nekhbet\" are sometimes spelled in the M.K. with the sign {water-lily}-M12 (nxb: Urk.VII:11:7, 20:11; Meir II, pl. 6; CT I, 281e (TlC, B10C), CT V, 202a, CT VI, 106g, 211d; nxbt: CT I, 48b, CT IV, 5a, CT V, 149b CT VII, 168g-p, 170l, 172a-f-o, 173g-m, 174l, 175b-e, 176a). This means that we must either admit that M12 has the phonetic value nxb (besides the usual value xA) or admit that nxb-sign M22 doesn’t represent {rush} but actually is {water-lily} without above-water leaf and without a hillock under the stalk. 17) Graphical transpositions of bird signs and other signs for optical reasons. In the PT, bird signs are regularly written in second position, when in reality they occur at the start of a word or in third position: Words with the sign {owl} in the second position: smdt – msd(mt)/msd(m)t \"black eyepaint\" (§54d), smd – msd \"paint eyes\" (§283a W), Hm – mH \"fill\" (Leclant, Pepi I, pl. 11, col.19), Hmj – mHj \"flood, swim\" (§388a W), Hma – mHa \"flax\", Asm – Ams"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":" 400\"sceptre\" (§§274a, 1166a), xnsm – xnms beer name, probably \"Friend\" (§61b), DAmt/DAmDt – mDAt \"chisel\" (Junker, Giza IV, TAF.

A complementary m when spelled in mj/mr \"like\" is normally placed after the mj/mr sign (cf. §§732b, 742c M, 874b N, 881b, 888a, 901c). The word mdwj \"speak\" normally is spelled with m (if spelled) in the second position just after the {walking stick} sign (exceptions are rare: §§195b N, 480a M, 573b M, 866c N, 1009b M, 1475b M). When a word starts with xm, the sign x could be placed in the free space behind the {owl}’s head, i. e. after m: mxa – xma \"grasp\" (Budge, BD126:12), mx – xm \"shrine\" (Sethy I, Abydos III, pl. 49). Words with the sign {quail chick} in the second position: Hwa – waH \"carob beans\" (§99d), Hwa – wHa \"cargo boat\" (see W 141); Hwa – wHa \"release\" (§1363b), Hwt – wH(A)t \"cauldron\", Tzw – wTz \"raise, support\" (§260a), DAw – wDA \"be sound\" (§§123k N, 513b, 893b, 900a P), wDw – wD \"command\" (§§120b,c, 123g,h), bwn – wbn \"rise\" (§§207d W, 209c W, 210c, 283a T), maHw – mawH \"oar\" (§602a), ttw – twt \"statue\", xwrt – wxrt \"dockyard\" (Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 149 (= 150), Jones, Titles, # 2771), bwjn – wbjn \"coccyx\" (§547b), Hwd/Hwdw – wdHw \"offering ration\" (MMA 08.201.1b (the name of the settlement), ), jw – wj \"me\" (§1527a), wAHw – wAH \"wreath\" (§1213d, e N), t tw – t wt \"emmer bread\" (§60b), wH – Hw \"proclaim\" (§§214a, 218c WT), wsrwr – wsr (§129c W), Ttw – Twt \"you are\" (§§198d, 251c, 587c M, 619a M, 877b,c N, 882b P), jtw – jwt(j) \"who is not\" (§§483c, 877d), jtw – jwt \"coming\" (§624c MN); SnDtw – SnDwt \"kilt\" (§§369 W, 546b T); rnntwt – rnnwt(j)t \"Nurturer\" (§302b W); twT – wtT \"beget\" (§447b); swx – wsx \"become wide\" (§887c), xAwxtj – wxAtj \"a pair of reed sandals\" (§219c); jnwnn – jnnw \"brought\" (L.D.II:67, 69); xAw – wxA \"clear away, shake off\" (§1837c); dwAw – dwA \"morning\" (in nTr dwA \"morning god\", w is a complement of wA, thus it is not dwAw, as is also shown by the spellings without complementary w, §§132b T, 357a, 805a PM, 820a, 871b M, 929b PM, 935c PM, 1001b P, 1207a), dwAwt – dwAt \"morning\" (§1434c, see §1152c P for the correct place of w before wA in dwAt); jmsw – jm(j)w.s \"(water) which is in it\" (§88a W); zwnwnT – zwnT \"Zunetj\" (§1094c P); rjw – rwj \"drum, dance\" (§§1005a, 2014a). The preposition jmjwt(j) \"between\" (Wb.I:76:3: imj-wtj) is sometimes spelled jmjtw (§§797b P, 1211a P), and all the grammars transliterate it the same way, but as is clear from PT spellings it is nothing but a graphical transposition of jmjwt(j) (with dual tj-ending as one is usually between two persons): jmjwt (§§472d, 797b M, 951b P, 1093d, 1188f PM, 1205a, 1211a, 1249a PM, 1253c, 1707b, 1750a) in full form jmjwtj (§§683d, 960c N, 1087c MN, 1125a P, 1249a N, Nt 830). Words with the sign {jabiru}-G29 in the second position: sbAst(j)t (lit. s-bA-bAs-tt, §892b P) – bAst(j)t (N) \"Bastet\", j.snbAsbA – j.snbAbA s(j) \"j.snbAbA it\" (§98a W). Words with the sign {guinea-fowl}-G21 in the second position: DnH \"wing\" usually is spelled with nH-bird in the second position, though sometimes against the rule (§§387b M, 461c N, 976a); HnHbw kAw – nHbw kAw \"Nehebkau\" (§229b). "},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":" 401Words with the sign {vulture}-G14 in the second position: tmwt – mwt \"mother\" (§§303c T, 394c W).

Words with the sign {cormorant}-G35 in the second position: qaq – aq \"enter\" (§308b T). We could term the above phenomenon the \"A bird sign better fits in the second position\" rule. Graphical transpositions also happen for optical reasons, to create sign patterns that are pleasant to the eye: Words with graphical transpositions because of a horizontal sign in the middle (i. e. to avoid an unbalanced pattern I–I ), with the wish to spell a word into an imagined rectangle: sHa – saH \"dignity’s regalia\" (§§220a M, 224a, 297a W, 297b, 407d T, 411c T, 743c, 754a MN, 800b), mwd – mdw(j) \"speak\" (§§218d-f W, 277c W, 278c W, 816d P), Hwa – waH(w) \"carob beans\" (§99d), bHat – baHt \"abundance\" (Jones, Titles, ## 448, 449), xtf – xft \"before, against\", Hba – Hab \"play (a game)\" (Wb.III:62), zj – jz \"tomb, mastaba\" (Duell, Mereruikai, pl. 26 (= 27)); TnHw – THnw \"Libya\" (Myśliwiec, Merefnebef); Words with graphical transpositions because of a vertical sign in the middle, with the wish to spell a word into an imagined rectangle: aS(b)/aSb – abS \"wine bowl\" (§92d W, L.D.II:28, L.D.II:35, Hassan, Giza II, fig. 137.1), sDrt – Dsrt \"restricted\" (Kanawati-Raziq, Hesi, pl.52), mrHrt – mrHt \"oil\" (L.D.II:44c; Jones, Titles, ## 545-547), TptH – TpHt \"cavern\" (§§245a W, 682a, 852d M), sptH – spHt \"bundle\" (Myśliwiec, Merefnebef), pxs – psx (~ psg) \"spit\" (Leclant, Pepi I, pl.
