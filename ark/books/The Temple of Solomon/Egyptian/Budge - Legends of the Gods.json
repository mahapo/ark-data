Wallis BudgeLondon, 1912[Editorial note: Throughout the text \"####\" represents images which cannot be transcribed.]PREFACEThe welcome which has been accorded to the volumes of this Series, andthe fact that some of them have passed into second and third editions,suggest that these little books have been found useful by beginners inEgyptology and others. Hitherto the object of them has been to supplyinformation about the Religion, Magic, Language, and History of theancient Egyptians, and to provide editions of the original texts fromwhich such information was derived. There are, however, many branchesof Egyptology which need treatment in a similar manner in this Series,and it has been suggested in many quarters that the time has nowarrived when the publication of a series of groups of textsillustrating Egyptian Literature in general might well be begun.Seeing that nothing is known about the authors of Egyptian works, noteven their names, it is impossible to write a History of EgyptianLiterature in the ordinary sense of the word. The only thing to bedone is to print the actual works in the best and most complete formpossible, with translations, and then to put them in the hands of thereader and leave them to his judgment.With this object in view, it has been decided to publish in the Seriesseveral volumes which shall be devoted to the reproduction inhieroglyphic type of the best and most typical examples of the variouskinds of Egyptian Literature, with English translations, on a muchlarger scale than was possible in my \"First Steps in Egyptian\" or in my\"Egyptian Reading Book.\" These volumes are intended to serve a doublepurpose, i.e., to supply the beginner in Egyptian with new material anda series of reading books, and to provide the general reader withtranslations of Egyptian works in a handy form.The Egyptian texts, whether the originals be written in hieroglyphic orhieratic characters, are here printed in hieroglyphic type, and arearranged with English translations, page for page. They are printed asthey are written in the original documents, i.e., the words are notdivided. The beginner will find the practice of dividing the words forhimself most useful in acquiring facility of reading and understandingthe language. The translations are as literal as can reasonably beexpected, and, as a whole, I believe that they mean what the original"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"writers intended to say. In the case of passages where the text iscorrupt, and readings are mixed, or where very rare words occur, orwhere words are omitted, the renderings given claim to be nothing morethan suggestions as to their meanings. It must be remembered that theexact meanings of many Egyptian words have still to be ascertained, andthat the ancient Egyptian scribes were as much puzzled as we are bysome of the texts which they copied, and that owing to carelessness,ignorance, or weariness, or all three, they made blunders which themodern student is unable to correct. In the Introduction will be foundbrief descriptions of the contents of the Egyptian texts, in whichtheir general bearing and importance are indicated, and referencesgiven to authoritative editions of texts and translations.E.

This papyrus wasacquired by the late Mr. A. H. Rhind in 1861 or 1862, when he wasexcavating some tombs on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes. He didnot himself find it in a tomb, but he received it from the BritishConsul at Luxor, Mustafa Agha, during an interchange of gifts when Mr.Rhind was leaving the country. Mustafa Agha obtained the papyrus fromthe famous hiding-place of the Royal Mummies at Der-al-Bahari, with thesituation of which he was well acquainted for many years before itbecame known to the Egyptian Service of Antiquities. When Mr. Rhindcame to England, the results of his excavations were examined by Dr.Birch, who, recognising the great value of the papyrus, arranged topublish it in a companion volume to Facsimiles of Two Papyri, but thedeath of Mr. Rhind in 1865 caused the project to fall through. Mr.Rhind's collection passed into the hands of Mr. David Bremner, and thepapyrus, together with many other antiquities, was purchased by theTrustees of the British Museum. In 1880 Dr. Birch suggested thepublication of the papyrus to Dr. Pleyte, the Director of the EgyptianMuseum at Leyden. This savant transcribed and translated some passagesfrom the Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys, which is the first textin it, and these he published in Recueil de Travaux, Paris, tom. iii.,pp. 57-64. In 1886 by Dr. Birch's kindness I was allowed to work atthe papyrus, and I published transcripts of some important passages andthe account of the Creation in the Proceedings of the Society ofBiblical Archaeology, 1886-7, pp. 11-26. The Legend of the Creationwas considered by Dr. H. Brugsch to be of considerable value for thestudy of the Egyptian Religion, and encouraged by him[FN#1] I made afull transcript of the papyrus, which was published in Archaeologia,(vol. lii., London, 1891), with transliterations and translations. In1910 I edited for the Trustees of the British Museum the completehieratic text with a revised translation.[FN#2][FN#1] Ein in moglichst wortgetreuer Uebersetzung vorglegter Papyrus-text soll den Schlussstein meines Werkes bilden. Er wird den Beweisfur die Richtigkeit meiner eigenen Untersuchungen vollenden, indem erdas wichtigste Zeugniss altagyptischen Ursprungs den zahlreichen, vonmir angezogenen Stellen aus den Inschriften hinzufugt. Trotz mancherSchwierigkeit im Einzelnen ist der Gesammtinhalt des Textes, den zuerstein englischer Gelehrter der Wissenschaft zuganglich gemacht hat, suchnicht im geringsten misszuverstehen (Brugsch, Religion, p. 740). Hegives a German translation of the Creation Legend on pp. 740, 741, anda transliteration on p. 756.[FN#2] Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum, London, 1910,folio.The papyrus is about 16 ft. 8 in. in length, and is 9 1/4 in. in width.It contains 21 columns of hieratic text which are written in shortlines and are poetical in character, and 12 columns or pages of textwritten in long lines; the total number of lines is between 930 and940. The text is written in a small, very black, but neat hand, and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"may be assigned to a time between the XXVIth Dynasty and the PtolemaicPeriod. The titles, catch-words, rubrics, names of Apep and hisfiends, and a few other words, are written in red ink. There are twocolophons; in the one we have a date, namely, the \"first day of thefourth month of the twelfth year of Pharaoh Alexander, the son ofAlexander,\" i.e., B.C. 311, and in the other the name of the priest whoeither had the papyrus written, or appropriated it, namely, Nes-Menu,or Nes-Amsu.The Legend of the Creation is found in the third work which is given inthe papyrus, and which is called the \"Book of overthrowing Apep, theEnemy of Ra, the Enemy of Un-Nefer\" (i.e., Osiris). This workcontained a series of spells which were recited during the performanceof certain prescribed ceremonies, with the object of preventing storms,and dispersing rain-clouds, and removing any obstacle, animate orinanimate, which could prevent the rising of the sun in the morning, orobscure his light during the day. The Leader-in Chief of the hosts ofdarkness was a fiend called Apep who appeared in the sky in the form ofa monster serpent, and, marshalling all the fiends of the Tuat,attempted to keep the Sun-god imprisoned in the kingdom of darkness.Right in the midst of the spells which were directed against Apep wefind inserted the legend of the Creation, which occurs in no otherknown Egyptian document (Col. XXVI., l. 21, to Col. XXVII., l. 6).Curiously enough a longer version of the legend is given a littlefarther on (Col. XXVIII., l. 20, to Col. XXIX., l. 6). Whether thescribe had two copies to work from, and simply inserted both, orwhether he copied the short version and added to it as he went along,cannot be said. The legend is entitled: Book of knowing the evolutionsof Ra [and of] overthrowing Apep.This curious \"Book\" describes the origin not only of heaven, and earth,and all therein, but also of God Himself. In it the name of Apep isnot even mentioned, and it is impossible to explain its appearance inthe Apep Ritual unless we assume that the whole \"Book\" was regarded asa spell of the most potent character, the mere recital of which wasfraught with deadly effect for Apep and his friends.The story of the Creation is supposed to be told by the god Neb-er-tcher. This name means the \"Lord to the uttermost limit,\" and thecharacter of the god suggests that the word \"limit\" refers to time andspace, and that he was, in fact, the Everlasting God of the Universe.This god's name occurs in Coptic texts, and then he appears as one whopossesses all the attributes which are associated by modern nationswith God Almighty. Where and how Neb-er-tcher existed is not said, butit seems as if he was believed to have been an almighty and invisiblepower which filled all space. It seems also that a desire arose in himto create the world, and in order to do this he took upon himself theform of the god Khepera, who from first to last was regarded as theCreator, par excellence, among all the gods known to the Egyptians.When this transformation of Neb-er-tcher into Khepera took place theheavens and the earth had not been created, but there seems to haveexisted a vast mass of water, or world-ocean, called Nu, and it musthave been in this that the transformation took place. In thiscelestial ocean were the germs of all the living things whichafterwards took form in heaven and on earth, but they existed in astate of inertness and helplessness. Out of this ocean Khepera raisedhimself, and so passed from a state of passiveness and inertness into"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"one of activity. When Khepera raised himself out of the ocean Nu, hefound himself in vast empty space, wherein was nothing on which hecould stand. The second version of the legend says that Khepera gavebeing to himself by uttering his own name, and the first version statesthat he made use of words in providing himself with a place on which tostand. In other words, when Khepera was still a portion of the beingof Neb-er-tcher, he spake the word \"Khepera,\" and Khepera came intobeing. Similarly, when he needed a place whereon to stand, he utteredthe name of the thing, or place, on which he wanted to stand, and thatthing, or place, came into being. This spell he seems to haveaddressed to his heart, or as we should say, will, so that Kheperawilled this standing-place to appear, and it did so forthwith. Thefirst version only mentions a heart, but the second also speaks of aheart-soul as assisting Khepera in his first creative acts; and we mayassume that he thought out in his heart what manner of thing be wishedto create, and then by uttering its name caused his thought to takeconcrete form. This process of thinking out the existence of things isexpressed in Egyptian by words which mean \"laying the foundation in theheart.\"In arranging his thoughts and their visible forms Khepera was assistedby the goddess Maat, who is usually regarded as the goddess of law,order, and truth, and in late times was held to be the femalecounterpart of Thoth, \"the heart of the god Ra.\" In this legend,however, she seems to play the part of Wisdom, as described in the Bookof Proverbs,[FN#3] for it was by Maat that he \"laid the foundation.\"[FN#3] \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before hisworks of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, orever the earth was. When there were no depths I was brought forth . .. . . . . Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was Ibrought forth: while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,nor the highest part of the dust of the world. When he prepared theheavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:when he established the clouds above: when he strengthened thefountains of the deep: when he gave to the sea his decree, . . . . . .when he appointed the foundations of the earth: then I was by him, asone brought up with him. . . . . . .\" Proverbs, viii. 22 ff.}Having described the coming into being of Khepera and the place onwhich he stood, the legend goes on to tell of the means by which thefirst Egyptian triad, or trinity, came into existence. Khepera had, insome form, union with his own shadow, and so begot offspring, whoproceeded from his body under the forms of the gods Shu and Tefnut.According to a tradition preserved in the Pyramid Texts[FN#4] thisevent took place at On (Heliopolis), and the old form of the legendascribes the production of Shu and Tefnut to an act of masturbation.Originally these gods were the personifications of air and dryness, andliquids respectively; thus with their creation the materials for theconstruction of the atmosphere and sky came into being. Shu and Tefnutwere united, and their offspring were Keb, the Earth-god, and Nut, theSky-goddess. We have now five gods in existence; Khepera, the creativeprinciple, Shu, the atmosphere, Tefnut, the waters above the heavens,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Nut, the Sky-goddess, and Keb, the Earth-god. Presumably about thistime the sun first rose out of the watery abyss of Nu, and shone uponthe world and produced day. In early times the sun, or his light, wasregarded as a form of Shu. The gods Keb and Nut were united in anembrace, and the effect of the coming of light was to separate them. Aslong as the sun shone, i.e., as long as it was day, Nut, the Sky-goddess, remained in her place above the earth, being supported by Shu;but as soon as the sun set she left the sky and gradually descendeduntil she rested on the body of the Earth-god, Keb.[FN#4] Pepi I., l. 466.The embraces of Keb caused Nut to bring forth five gods at a birth,namely, Osiris, Horus, Set, Isis, and Nephthys. Osiris and Isismarried before their birth, and Isis brought forth a son called Horus;Set and Nephthys also married before their birth, and Nephthys broughtforth a son named Anpu (Anubis), though he is not mentioned in thelegend. Of these gods Osiris is singled out for special mention in thelegend, in which Khepera, speaking as Neb-er-tcher, says that his nameis Ausares, who is the essence of the primeval matter of which hehimself is formed. Thus Osiris was of the same substance as the GreatGod who created the world according to the Egyptians, and was areincarnation of his great-grandfather. This portion of the legendhelps to explain the views held about Osiris as the great ancestralspirit, who when on earth was a benefactor of mankind, and who when inheaven was the saviour of souls.The legend speaks of the sun as the Eye of Khepera, or Neb-er-tcher,and refers to some calamity which befell it and extinguished its light.This calamity may have been simply the coming of night, or eclipses, orstorms; but in any case the god made a second Eye, i.e., the Moon, towhich he gave some of the splendour of the other Eye, i.e., the Sun,and he gave it a place in his Face, and henceforth it ruled throughoutthe earth, and had special powers in respect of the production oftrees, plants, vegetables, herbs, etc. Thus from the earliest timesthe moon was associated with the fertility of the earth, especially inconnection with the production of abundant crops and successfulharvests.According to the legend, men and women sprang not from the earth, butdirectly from the body of the god Khepera, or Neb-er-tcher, who placedhis members together and then wept tears upon them, and men and women,came into being from the tears which had fallen from his eyes. Nospecial mention is made of the creation of beasts in the legend, butthe god says that he created creeping things of all kinds, and amongthese are probably included the larger quadrupeds. The men and women,and all the other living creatures which were made at that time,reproduced their species, each in his own way, and so the earth becamefilled with their descendants which we see at the present time.Such is the Legend of Creation as it is found in the Papyrus of Nes-Menu. The text of both versions is full of difficult passages, and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"some readings are corrupt; unfortunately variant versions by which theymight be corrected are lacking. The general meaning of the legend inboth versions is quite clear, and it throws considerable light on theEgyptian religion. The Egyptians believed in the existence of God, theCreator and Maintainer of all things, but they thought that theconcerns of this world were committed by Him to the superintendence ofa series of subordinate spirits or beings called \"gods,\" over whom theybelieved magical spells and ceremonies to have the greatest influence.The Deity was a Being so remote, and of such an exalted nature, that itwas idle to expect Him to interfere in the affairs of mortals, or tochange any decree or command which He had once uttered. The spirits or\"gods,\" on the other hand, possessing natures not far removed fromthose of men, were thought to be amenable to supplications andflattery, and to wheedling and cajolery, especially when accompanied bygifts. It is of great interest to find a legend in which the power ofGod as the Creator of the world and the sun and moon is so clearly setforth, embedded in a book of magical spells devoted to the destructionof the mythological monster who existed solely to prevent the sun fromrising and shining.II.THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.The text containing the Legend of the Destruction of Mankind is writtenin hieroglyphs, and is found on the four walls of a small chamber whichis entered from the \"hall of columns\" in the tomb of Seti I., which issituated on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes. On the wall facingthe door of this chamber is painted in red the figure of the large \"Cowof Heaven.\" The lower part of her belly is decorated with a series ofthirteen stars, and immediately beneath it are the two Boats of Ra,called Semketet and Mantchet, or Sektet and Matet. Each of her fourlegs is held in position by two gods, and the god Shu, withoutstretched uplifted arms, supports her body. The Cow was publishedby Champollion,[FN#5] without the text. This most importantmythological text was first published and translated by Professor E.Naville in 1874.[FN#6] It was republished by Bergmann[FN#7] andBrugsch,[FN#8] who gave a transcription of the text, with a Germantranslation. Other German versions by Lauth,[FN#9] Brugsch,[FN#10] andWiedemann[FN#11] have appeared, and a part of the text was translatedinto French by Lefebure.[FN#12] The latest edition of the text waspublished by Lefebure,[FN#13] and text of a second copy, very muchmutilated, was published by Professor Naville, with a Frenchtranslation in 1885.[FN#14] The text printed in this volume is that ofM. Lefebure."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"[FN#5] Monuments, tom. iii., p. 245.[FN#6] Trans. Soc. Bibl.

Arch., vol. viii., p. 412 ft.The legend takes us back to the time when the gods of Egypt went aboutin the country, and mingled with men and were thoroughly acquaintedwith their desires and needs. The king who reigned over Egypt was Ra,the Sun-god, who was not, however, the first of the Dynasty of Gods whoruled the land. His predecessor on the throne was Hephaistos, who,according to Manetho, reigned 9000 years, whilst Ra reigned only 992years; Panodorus makes his reign to have lasted less than 100 years.Be this as it may, it seems that the \"self-created and self-begotten\"god Ra had been ruling over mankind for a very long time, for hissubjects were murmuring against him, and they were complaining that hewas old, that his bones were like silver, his body like gold, and hishair like lapis-lazuli. When Ra heard these murmurings he ordered hisbodyguard to summon all the gods who had been with him in the primevalWorld-ocean, and to bid them privately to assemble in the Great House,which can be no other than the famous temple of Heliopolis. Thisstatement is interesting, for it proves that the legend is ofHeliopolitan origin, like the cult of Ra itself, and that it does notbelong, at least in so far as it applies to Ra, to the PredynasticPeriod.When Ra entered the Great Temple, the gods made obeisance to him, andtook up their positions on each side of him, and informed him that theyawaited his words. Addressing Nu, the personification of the World-ocean, Ra bade them to take notice of the fact that the men and womenwhom his Eye had created were murmuring against him. He then askedthem to consider the matter and to devise a plan of action for him, forhe was unwilling to slay the rebels without hearing what his gods hadto say. In reply the gods advised Ra to send forth his Eye to destroythe blasphemers, for there was no eye on earth that could resist it,especially when it took the form of the goddess Hathor. Ra acceptedtheir advice and sent forth his Eye in the form of Hathor to destroythem, and, though the rebels had fled to the mountains in fear, the Eyepursued them and overtook them and destroyed them. Hathor rejoiced inher work of destruction, and on her return was praised by Ra, for what"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"she had done. The slaughter of men began at Suten-henen(Herakleopolis), and during the night Hathor waded about in the bloodof men. Ra asserted his intention of being master of the rebels, andthis is probably referred to in the Book of the Dead, Chapter XVII., inwhich it is said that Ra rose as king for the first time in Suten-henen. Osiris also was crowned at Suten-henen, and in this city livedthe great Bennu bird, or Phoenix, and the \"Crusher of Bones\" mentionedin the Negative Confession.The legend now goes on to describe an act of Ra, the significance ofwhich it is difficult to explain. The god ordered messengers to bebrought to him, and when they arrived, he commanded them to run likethe wind to Abu, or the city of Elephantine, and to bring him largequantities of the fruit called tataat. What kind of fruit this was isnot clear, but Brugsch thought they were \"mandrakes,\" the so-called\"love-apples,\" and this translation of tataat may be usedprovisionally. The mandrakes were given to Sekti, a goddess ofHeliopolis, to crush and grind up, and when this was done they weremixed with human blood, and put in a large brewing of beer which thewomen slaves had made from wheat. In all they made 7,000 vessels ofbeer. When Ra saw the beer he approved of it, and ordered it to becarried up the river to where the goddess Hathor was still, it seems,engaged in slaughtering men. During the night he caused this beer tobe poured out into the meadows of the Four Heavens, and when Hathorcame she saw the beer with human blood and mandrakes in it, and drankof it and became drunk, and paid no further attention to men and women.In welcoming the goddess, Ra, called her \"Amit,\" i.e., \"beautiful one,\"and from this time onward \"beautiful women were found in the city ofAmit,\" which was situated in the Western Delta, near LakeMareotis.[FN#15] Ra also ordered that in future at every one of hisfestivals vessels of \"sleep-producing beer\" should be made, and thattheir number should be the same as the number of the handmaidens of Ra.Those who took part in these festivals of Hathor and Ra drank beer invery large quantities, and under the influence of the \"beautifulwomen,\" i.e., the priestesses, who were supposed to resemble Hathor intheir physical attractions, the festal celebrations degenerated intodrunken and licentious orgies.[FN#15] It was also called the \"City of Apis,\" (Brugsch, Dict. Geog.,p. 491), and is the Apis city of classical writers. It is, perhaps,represented by the modern Kom al-Hisn.Soon after this Ra complained that he was smitten with pain, and thathe was weary of the, children of men. He thought them a worthlessremnant, and wished that more of them had been slain. The gods abouthim begged him to endure, and reminded him that his power was inproportion to his will. Ra was, however, unconsoled, and he complainedthat his limbs were weak for the first time in his life. Thereupon thegod Nu told Shu to help Ra, and he ordered Nut to take the great god Raon her back. Nut changed herself into a cow, and with the help of ShuRa got on her back. As soon as men saw that Ra was on the back of theCow of Heaven, and was about to leave them, they became filled withfear and repentance, and cried out to Ra to remain with them and to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"slay all those who had blasphemed against him. But the Cow moved onher way, and carried Ra to Het-Ahet, a town of the nome of Mareotis,where in later days the right leg of Osiris was said to be preserved.Meanwhile darkness covered the land. When day broke the men who hadrepented of their blasphemies appeared with their bows, and slew theenemies of Ra. At this result Ra was pleased, and he forgave those whohad repented because of their righteous slaughter of his enemies. Fromthis time onwards human sacrifices were offered up at the festivals ofRa celebrated in this place, and at Heliopolis and in other parts ofEgypt.After these things Ra declared to Nut that he intended to leave thisworld, and to ascend into heaven, and that all those who would see hisface must follow him thither. Then he went up into heaven and prepareda place to which all might come. Then he said, \"Hetep sekhet aa,\"i.e., \"Let a great field be produced,\" and straightway \"Sekhet-hetep,\"or the \"Field of peace,\" came into being. He next said, \"Let there bereeds (aaru) in it,\" and straightway \"Sekhet Aaru,\" or the \"Field ofReeds,\" came into being. Sekhet-hetep was the Elysian Fields of theEgyptians, and the Field of Reeds was a well-known section of it.Another command of the god Ra resulted in the creation of the stars,which the legend compares to flowers. Then the goddess Nut trembled inall her body, and Ra, fearing that she might fall, caused to come intobeing the Four Pillars on which the heavens are supported. Turning toShu, Ra entreated him to protect these supports, and to place himselfunder Nut, and to hold her up in position with his hands. Thus Shubecame the new Sun-god in the place of Ra, and the heavens in which Ralived were supported and placed beyond the risk of falling, and mankindwould live and rejoice in the light of the new sun.At this place in the legend a text is inserted called the \"Chapter ofthe Cow.\" It describes how the Cow of Heaven and the two Boats of theSun shall be painted, and gives the positions of the gods who stand bythe legs of the Cow, and a number of short magical names, or formulae,which are inexplicable. The general meaning of the picture of the Cowis quite clear. The Cow represents the sky in which the Boats of Ra,sail, and her four legs are the four cardinal points which cannot bechanged. The region above her back is the heaven in which Ra reignsover the beings who pass thereto from this earth when they die, andhere was situated the home of the gods and the celestial spirits whogovern this world.When Ra had made a heaven for himself, and had arranged for acontinuance of life on the earth, and the welfare of human beings, heremembered that at one time when reigning on earth he had been bittenby a serpent, and had nearly lost his life through the bite. Fearingthat the same calamity might befall his successor, he determined totake steps to destroy the power of all noxious reptiles that dwelt onthe earth. With this object in view he told Thoth to summon Keb, theEarth-god, to his presence, and this god having arrived, Ra told himthat war must be made against the serpents that dwelt in his dominions.He further commanded him to go to the god Nu, and to tell him to set awatch over all the reptiles that were in the earth and in water, and todraw up a writing for every place in which serpents are known to be,containing strict orders that they are to bite, no one. Though theseserpents knew that Ra was retiring from the earth, they were never toforget that his rays would fall upon them. In his place their father"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Keb was to keep watch over them, and he was their father for ever.As a further protection against them Ra promised to impart to magiciansand snake-charmers the particular word of power, hekau, with which heguarded himself against the attacks of serpents, and also to transmitit to his son Osiris. Thus those who are ready to listen to theformulae of the snake-charmers shall always be immune from the bites ofserpents, and their children also. From this we may gather that theprofession of the snake-charmer is very ancient, and that this class ofmagicians were supposed to owe the foundation of their craft to adecree of Ra himself.Ra next sent for the god Thoth, and when he came into the presence ofRa, he invited him to go with him to a distance, to a place called\"Tuat,\" i.e., hell, or the Other World, in which region he haddetermined to make his light to shine. When they arrived there he toldThoth, the Scribe of Truth, to write down on his tablets the names ofall who were therein, and to punish those among them who had sinnedagainst him, and he deputed to Thoth the power to deal absolutely as hepleased with all the beings in the Tuat. Ra loathed the wicked, andwished them to be kept at a distance from him. Thoth was to be hisvicar, to fill his place, and \"Place of Ra,\" was to be his name. Hegave him power to send out a messenger (hab), so the Ibis (habi) cameinto being. All that Thoth would do would be good (khen), thereforethe Tekni bird of Thoth came into being. He gave Thoth power toembrace (anh) the heavens, therefore the Moon-god (Aah) came intobeing. He gave Thoth power to turn back (anan) the Northern peoples,therefore the dog-headed ape of Thoth came into being. Finally Ra toldThoth that he would take his place in the sight of all those who werewont to worship Ra, and that all should praise him as God. Thus theabdication of Ra was complete.In the fragmentary texts which follow we are told how a man may benefitby the recital of this legend. He must proclaim that the soul whichanimated Ra was the soul of the Aged One, and that of Shu, Khnemu (?),Heh, &c., and then he must proclaim that he is Ra himself, and his wordof power Heka. If he recites the Chapter correctly he shall have lifein the Other World, and he will be held in greater fear there thanhere.

Z., 1883, p. 27 ff.[FN#18] Die Religion, p. 29.[FN#19] Aegypten, p. 359 ff.[FN#20] Les Origines, V. 162-4.[FN#21] First Steps in Egyptian, p. 241 ff.It has already been seen that the god Ra, when retiring from thegovernment of this world, took steps through Thoth to supply mankindwith words of power and spells with which to protect themselves againstthe bites of serpents and other noxious reptiles. The legend of theDestruction of Mankind affords no explanation of this remarkable fact,but when we read the following legend of Ra and Isis we understand whyRa, though king of the gods, was afraid of the reptiles which lived inthe kingdom of Keb. The legend, or \"Chapter of the Divine God,\" beginsby enumerating the mighty attributes of Ra as the creator of theuniverse, and describes the god of \"many names\" as unknowable, even bythe gods. At this time Isis lived in the form of a woman who possessedthe knowledge of spells and incantations, that is to say, she wasregarded much in the same way as modern African peoples regard their\"medicine-women,\" or \"witch-women.\" She had used her spells on men,and was tired of exercising her powers on them, and she craved theopportunity of making herself mistress of gods and spirits as well asof men. She meditated how she could make herself mistress both ofheaven and earth, and finally she decided that she could only obtainthe power she wanted if she possessed the knowledge of the secret nameof Ra, in which his very existence was bound up. Ra guarded this namemost jealously, for he knew that if he revealed it to any being hewould henceforth be at that being's mercy. Isis saw that it wasimpossible to make Ra declare his name to her by ordinary methods, andshe therefore thought out the following plan. It was well known inEgypt and the Sudan at a very early period that if a magician obtainedsome portion of a person's body, e.g., a hair, a paring of a nail, afragment of skin, or a portion of some efflux from the body, spellscould be used upon them which would have the effect of causing grievousharm to that person. Isis noted that Ra had become old and feeble, andthat as he went about he dribbled at the mouth, and that his salivafell upon the ground. Watching her opportunity she caught some of thesaliva of the and mixing it with dust, she moulded it into the form of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"a large serpent, with poison-fangs, and having uttered her spells overit, she left the serpent lying on the path, by which Ra travelled dayby day as he went about inspecting Egypt, so that it might strike athim as he passed along. We may note in passing that the Banyoro in theSudan employ serpents in killing buffaloes at the present day. Theycatch a puff-adder in a noose, and then nail it alive by the tip of itstail to the round in the middle of a buffalo track, so that when ananimal passes the reptile may strike at it. Presently a buffalo comesalong, does what it is expected to do, and then the puff-adder strikesat it, injects its poison, and the animal dies soon after. As many asten buffaloes have been killed in a day by one puff-adder. The body ofthe first buffalo is not eaten, for it is regarded as poisoned meat,but all the others are used as food.[FN#22][FN#22] Johnston, Uganda, vol. ii., p. 584. The authority for thisstatement is Mr. George Wilson, formerly Collector in Unyoro.Soon after Isis had placed the serpent on the Path, Ra passed by, andthe reptile bit him, thus injecting poison into his body. Its effectwas terrible, and Ra cried out in agony. His jaws chattered, his lipstrembled, and he became speechless for a time; never before had besuffered such pain. The gods hearing his cry rushed to him, and whenhe could speak he told them that he had been bitten by a deadlyserpent. In spite of all the words of power which were known to him,and his secret name which had been hidden in his body at his birth, aserpent had bitten him, and he was being consumed with a fiery pain.He then commanded that all the gods who had any knowledge of magicalspells should come to him, and when they came, Isis, the great lady ofspells, the destroyer of diseases, and the revivifier of the dead, camewith them. Turning to Ra she said, \"What hath happened, O divineFather?\" and in answer the god told her that a serpent had bitten him,that he was hotter than fire and colder than water, that his limbsquaked, and that he was losing the power of sight. Then Isis said tohim with guile, \"Divine Father, tell me thy name, for he who utterethhis own name shall live.\" Thereupon Ra proceeded to enumerate thevarious things that he had done, and to describe his creative acts, andended his speech to Isis by saying, that he was Khepera in the morning,Ra at noon, and Temu in the evening. Apparently he thought that thenaming of these three great names would satisfy Isis, and that shewould immediately pronounce a word of power and stop the pain in hisbody, which, during his speech, had become more acute. Isis, however,was not deceived, and she knew well that Ra had not declared to her hishidden name; this she told him, and she begged him once again to tellher his name. For a time the god refused to utter the name, but as thepain in his body became more violent, and the poison passed through hisveins like fire, he said, \"Isis shall search in me, and my name shallpass from my body into hers.\" At that moment Ra removed himself fromthe sight of the gods in his Boat, and the Throne in the Boat ofMillions of Years had no occupant. The great name of Ra was, it seems,hidden in his heart, and Isis, having some doubt as to whether Ra wouldkeep his word or not, agreed with Horus that Ra must be made to take anoath to part with his two Eyes, that is, the Sun and the Moon. Atlength Ra allowed his heart to be taken from his body, and his great"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and secret name, whereby he lived, passed into the possession of Isis.Ra thus became to all intents and purposes a dead god. Then Isis,strong in the power of her spells, said: \"Flow, poison, come out of Ra.Eye of Horus, come out of Ra, and shine outside his mouth. It is I,Isis, who work, and I have made the poison to fall on the ground.Verily the name of the great god is taken from him, Ra shall live andthe poison shall die; if the poison live Ra shall die.\"This was the infallible spell which was to be used in cases ofpoisoning, for it rendered the bite or sting of every venomous reptileharmless. It drove the poison out of Ra, and since it was composed byIsis after she obtained the knowledge of his secret name it wasirresistible. If the words were written on papyrus or linen over afigure of Temu or Heru-hekenu, or Isis, or Horus, they became a mightycharm. If the papyrus or linen were steeped in water and the waterdrunk, the words were equally efficacious as a charm against snake-bites. To this day water in which the written words of a text from theKur'an have been dissolved, or water drunk from a bowl on the inside ofwhich religious texts have been written, is still regarded as a never-failing charm in Egypt and the Sudan. Thus we see that the moderncustom of drinking magical water was derived from the ancientEgyptians, who believed that it conveyed into their bodies the actualpower of their gods.IV.THE LEGEND OF HERU-BEHUTET AND THE WINGED DISK.The text of this legend is cut in hieroglyphics on the walls of thetemple of Edfu in Upper Egypt, and certain portions of it areillustrated by large bas-reliefs. Both text and reliefs were publishedby Professor Naville in his volume entitled Mythe d'Horus, fol., plates12-19, Geneva, 1870. A German translation by Brugsch appeared in theAhandlungen der Gottinger Akademie, Band xiv., pp. 173-236, and anotherby Wiedemann in his Die Religion, p. 38 ff. (see the Englishtranslation p. 69 ff.). The legend, in the form in which it is heregiven, dates from the Ptolemaic Period, but the matter which itcontains is far older, and it is probable that the facts recorded in itare fragments of actual history, which the Egyptians of the late periodtried to piece together in chronological order. We shall see as weread that the writer of the legend as we have it was not wellacquainted with Egyptian history, and that in his account of theconquest of Egypt he has confounded one god with another, and mixed uphistorical facts with mythological legends to such a degree that hismeaning is frequently uncertain. The great fact which he wished todescribe is the conquest of Egypt by an early king, who, having subduedthe peoples in the South, advanced northwards, and made all the people"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"whom he conquered submit to his yoke. Now the King of Egypt was alwayscalled Horus, and the priests of Edfu wishing to magnify their localgod, Horus of Behutet, or Horus of Edfu, attributed to him theconquests of this human, and probably predynastic, king. We mustremember that the legend assumes that Ra, was still reigning on earth,though he was old and feeble, and had probably deputed his power to hissuccessor, whom the legend regards as his son.PLATE I.Horus holding the Hippopotamus-fiend with chain and spear.

From Nubia Ra-Harmakhis sailed down the river to Edfu,where Heru-Behutet entered his boat, and told him that his foes wereconspiring against him. Ra-Harmakhis in answer addressed Heru-Behutetas his son, and commanded him to set out without delay and slay thewicked rebels. Then Heru-Behutet took the form of a great winged Disk,and at once flew up into the sky, where he took the place of Ra, theold Sun-god. Looking down from the height of heaven he was able todiscover the whereabouts of the rebels, and he pursued them in the formof a winged disk. Then he attacked them with such violence that theybecame dazed, and could neither see where they were going, nor hear,the result of this being that they slew each other, and in a very shorttime they were all dead. Thoth, seeing this, told Ra that becauseHorus had appeared as a great winged disk he must be called \"Heru-Behutet,\" and by this name Horus was known ever after at Edfu. Raembraced Horus, and referred with pleasure to the blood which he hadshed, and Horus invited his father to come and look upon the slain. Raset out with the goddess Ashthertet (`Ashtoreth) to do this, and theysaw the enemies lying fettered on the ground. The legend hereintroduces a number of curious derivations of the names of Edfu, &c.,which are valueless, and which remind us of the derivations of place-names propounded by ancient Semitic scribes.[FN#23] i.e., Ra on the horizon."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PLATE V.Horus standing on the back of the Hippopotamus-fiend, and spearing himin the presence of Isis.PLATE VI.The \"Butcher-priest\" slicing open the Hippopotamus-fiend.In gladness of heart Ra proposed a sail on the Nile, but as soon as hisenemies heard that he was coming, they changed themselves intocrocodiles and hippopotami, so that they might be able to wreck hisboat and devour him. As the boat of the god approached them theyopened their jaws to crush it, but Horus and his followers came quicklyon the scene, and defeated their purpose. The followers of Horus herementioned are called in the text \"Mesniu,\" i.e., \"blacksmiths,\" or\"workers in metal,\" and they represent the primitive conquerors of theEgyptians, who were armed with metal weapons, and so were able toovercome with tolerable ease the indigenous Egyptians, whose weaponswere made of flint and wood. Horus and his \"blacksmiths\" were providedwith iron lances and chains, and, baying cast the chains over themonsters in the river, they drove their lances into their snouts, andslew 651 of them. Because Horus gained his victory by means of metalweapons, Ra decreed that a metal statue of Horus should be placed atEdfu, and remain there for ever, and a name was given to the town tocommemorate the great battle that had taken place there. Ra applaudedHorus for the mighty deeds which be had been able to perform by meansof the spells contained in the \"Book of Slaying the Hippopotamus.\"Horus then associated with himself the goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet,who were in the form of serpents, and, taking his place as the wingedDisk on the front of the Boat of Ra, destroyed all the enemies of Rawheresoever he found them. When the remnant of the enemies of Ra, sawthat they were likely to be slain, they doubled back to the South, butHorus pursued them, and drove them down the river before him as far asThebes. One battle took place at Tchetmet, and another at Denderah,and Horus was always victorious; the enemies were caught by chainsthrown over them, and the deadly spears of the Blacksmiths drank theirblood.After this the enemy fled to the North, and took refuge in the swampsof the Delta, and in the shallows of the Mediterranean Sea, and Horuspursued them thither. After searching for them for four days and fournights he found them, and they were speedily slain. One hundred andforty-two of them and a male hippopotamus were dragged on to the Boatof Ra, and there Horus dug out their entrails, and hacked theircarcases in pieces, which he gave to his Blacksmiths and the gods whoformed the crew of the Boat of Ra. Before despatching thehippopotamus, Horus leaped on to the back of the monster as a mark ofhis triumph, and to commemorate this event the priest of Heben, thetown wherein these things happened, was called \"He who standeth on theback ever after.\"The end of the great fight, however, was not yet.

Thither Horus and hiswell-armed Blacksmiths pursued them, and came up with them at the towncalled Per-Rerehu, which derived its name from the \"Two Combatants,\" or\"Two Men,\" Horus and Set. A great fight took place, the enemies of Rawere defeated with great slaughter, and Horus dragged 381 prisoners onto the Boat of Ra, where he slew them, and gave their bodies to hisfollowers.PLATE VII.Horus of Behutet and Ra-Harmakhis in a shrine.PLATE VIII.Horus of Behutet and Harmakhis in a shrine.PLATE IX.Ashthertet ('Ashtoreth') driving her chariot over the prostrate foe.PLATE X.Left: Horus of Behutet spearing a Typhonic animal, and holding hisprisoners with rope.Right: Horus of Behutet, accompanied by Ra-Harmakhis and Menu, spearingthe Hippopotamus-fiend.Then Set rose up and cursed Horus because he had slain his allies, andhe used such foul language that Thoth called him \"Nehaha-her,\" i.e.,\"Stinking Face,\" and this name clung to him ever after. After thisHorus and Set engaged in a fight which lasted a very long time, but atlength Horus drove his spear into the neck of Set with such violencethat the Fiend fell headlong to the ground. Then Horus smote with hisclub the mouth which had uttered such blasphemies, and fettered himwith his chain. In this state Horus dragged Set into the presence ofRa, who ascribed great praise to Horus, and special names were given tothe palace of Horus and the high priest of the temple in commemorationof the event. When the question of the disposal of Set was beingdiscussed by the gods, Ra ordered that he and his fiends should begiven over to Isis and her son Horus, who were to do what they pleasedwith them. Horus promptly cut off the heads of Set and his fiends inthe presence of Ra and Isis, and be dragged Set by his feet through thecountry with his spear sticking in his head and neck. After this Isisappointed Horus of Behutet to be the protecting deity of her son Horus.The fight between the Sun-god and Set was a very favourite subject withEgyptian writers, and there are many forms of it. Thus there is thefight between Heru-ur and Set, the fight between Ra and Set, the fightbetween Heru-Behutet and Set, the fight between Osiris and Set, and thefight between Horus, son of Isis, and Set. In the oldest times thecombat was merely the natural opposition of light to darkness, butlater the Sun-god became the symbol of right and truth as well as oflight, and Set the symbol of sin and wickedness as well as of darkness,and ultimately the nature myth was forgotten, and the fight between thetwo gods became the type of the everlasting war which good men wage"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"against sin. In Coptic literature we have the well-known legend of theslaughter of the dragon by St. George, and this is nothing but aChristian adaptation of the legend of Horus and Set.After these things Horus, son of Ra, and Horus, son of Isis, each tookthe form of a mighty man, with the face and body of a hawk, and eachwore the Red and White Crowns, and each carried a spear and chain. Inthese forms the two gods slew the remnant of the enemies. Now by somemeans or other Set came to life again, and he took the form of a mightyhissing or \"roaring\" serpent, and hid himself in the ground, in a placewhich was ever after called the \"place of the roarer.\" In front of hishiding-place Horus, son of Isis, stationed himself in the form of ahawk-headed staff to prevent him from coming out. In spite of this,however, Set managed to escape, and he gathered about him the Smai andSeba fiends at the Lake of Meh, and waged war once more against Horus;the enemies of Ra were again defeated, and Horus slew them in thepresence of his father.PLATE XI.Horus of Behutet and Thoth spearing human victims with the assistanceof Isis.PLATE XII.Horus of Behutet and Thoth spearing Set in the form of a crocodile.Horus, it seems, now ceased to fight for some time, and devoted himselfto keeping guard over the \"Great God\" who was in An-rut-f, a districtin or near Herakleopolis. This Great God was no other than Osiris, andthe duty of Horus was to prevent the Smai fiends from coming by nightto the place. In spite of the power of Horus, it was found necessaryto summon the aid of Isis to keep away the fiends, and it was only byher words of power that the fiend Ba was kept out of the sanctuary. Asa reward for what he had already done, Thoth decreed that Horus shouldbe called the \"Master-Fighter.\" Passing over the derivations of place-names which occur here in the text, we find that Horus and hisBlacksmiths were again obliged to fight bodies of the enemy who hadmanaged to escape, and that on one occasion they killed one hundred andsix foes. In every fight the Blacksmiths performed mighty deeds ofvalour, and in reward for their services a special district wasallotted to them to dwell in.The last great fight in the North took place at Tanis, in the easternpart of the Delta. When the position of the enemy had been located,Horus took the form of a lion with the face of a man, and he put on hishead the Triple Crown. His claws were like flints, and with them hedragged away one hundred and forty-two of the enemy, and tore them inpieces, and dug out their tongues, which he carried off as symbols ofhis victory.Meanwhile rebellion had again broken out in Nubia, where about one-third of the enemy had taken refuge in the river in the forms of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"crocodiles and hippopotami. Ra counselled Horus to sail up the Nilewith his Blacksmiths, and when Thoth had recited the \"Chapters ofprotecting the Boat of Ra\" over the boats, the expedition set sail forthe South. The object of reciting these spells was to prevent themonsters which were in the river from making the waves to rise and fromstirring up storms which might engulf the boats of Ra and Horus and theBlacksmiths. When the rebels and fiends who had been uttering, treasonagainst Horus saw the boat of Ra, with the winged Disk of Horusaccompanied by the goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet in the form ofserpents, they were smitten with fear, and their hearts quaked, and allpower of resistance left them, and they died of fright straightway.When Horus returned in triumph to Edfu, Ra ordered that an image of thewinged Disk should be placed in each of his sanctuaries, and that inevery place wherein a winged Disk was set, that sanctuary should be asanctuary of Horus of Behutet. The winged disks which are seen abovethe doorways of the temples still standing in Egypt show that thecommand of Ra, was faithfully carried out by the priests.PLATE XIII.Horus of Behutet in the form of a lion slaying his foes.V.LEGEND OF THE BIRTH OF HORUS, SON OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.PLATE XIV.The Procreation of Horus, son of Isis.The text which contains this legend is found cut in hieroglyphics upona stele which is now preserved in Paris. Attention was first called toit by Chabas, who in 1857 gave a translation of it in the RevueArcheologique, p. 65 ff., and pointed out the importance of itscontents with his characteristic ability. The hieroglyphic text wasfirst published by Ledrain in his work on the monuments of theBibliotheque Nationale in Paris,[FN#24] and I gave a transcript of thetext, with transliteration and translation, in 1895.[FN#25][FN#24] Les Monuments Egyptiens (Cabinet des Medailles et Antiques),In the Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes, Paris, 1879-1882,plate xxii. ff.[FN#25] First Steps in Egyptian, pp. 179-188."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The greater part of the text consists of a hymn to Osiris, which wasprobably composed under the XVIIIth Dynasty, when an extraordinarydevelopment of the cult of that god took place, and when he was placedby Egyptian theologians at the head of all the gods. Though unseen inthe temples, his presence filled all Egypt, and his body formed thevery substance of the country. He was the God of all gods and theGovernor of the Two Companies of the gods, he formed the soul and bodyof Ra, he was the beneficent Spirit of all spirits, he was himself thecelestial food on which the Doubles in the Other World lived. He wasthe greatest of the gods in On (Heliopolis), Memphis, Herakleopolis,Hermopolis, Abydos, and the region of the First Cataract, and so. Heembodied in his own person the might of Ra-Tem, Apis and Ptah, theHorus-gods, Thoth and Khnemu, and his rule over Busiris and Abydoscontinued to be supreme, as it had been for many, many hundreds ofyears. He was the source of the Nile, the north wind sprang from him,his seats were the stars of heaven which never set, and theimperishable stars were his ministers. All heaven was his dominion,and the doors of the sky opened before him of their own accord when heappeared. He inherited the earth from his father Keb, and thesovereignty of heaven from his mother Nut. In his person he unitedendless time in the past and endless time in the future. Like Ra hehad fought Seba, or Set, the monster of evil, and had defeated him, andhis victory assured to him lasting authority over the gods and thedead. He exercised his creative power in making land and water, treesand herbs, cattle and other four-footed beasts, birds of all kinds, andfish and creeping things; even the waste spaces of the desert owedallegiance to him as the creator. And he rolled out the sky, and setthe light above the darkness.The last paragraph of the text contains an allusion to Isis, the sisterand wife of Osiris, and mentions the legend of the birth of Horus,which even under the XVIIIth Dynasty was very ancient, Isis, we aretold, was the constant protectress of her brother, she drove away thefiends that wanted to attack him, and kept them out of his shrine andtomb, and she guarded him from all accidents. All these things she didby means of spells and incantations, large numbers of which were knownto her, and by her power as the \"witch-goddess.\" Her \"mouth wastrained to perfection, and she made no mistake in pronouncing herspells, and her tongue was skilled and halted not.\" At length came theunlucky day when Set succeeded in killing Osiris during the war whichthe \"good god\" was waging against him and his fiends. Details of theengagement are wanting, but the Pyramid Texts state that the body ofOsiris was hurled to the ground by Set at a place called Netat, whichseems to have been near Abydos.[FN#26] The news of the death of Osiriswas brought to Isis, and she at once set out to find his body. Alllegends agree in saying that she took the form of a bird, and that sheflew about unceasingly, going hither and thither, and uttering wailingcries of grief. At length she found the body, and with a piercing cryshe alighted on the ground. The Pyramid Texts say that Nephthys waswith her that \"Isis came, Nephthys came, the one on the right side, theother on the left side, one in the form of a Hat bird, the other in theform of a Tchert bird, and they found Osiris thrown on the ground inNetat by his brother Set.\" The late form of the legend goes on to saythat Isis fanned the body with her feathers, and produced air, and that"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"at length she caused the inert members of Osiris to move, and drew fromhim his essence, wherefrom she produced her child Horus.[FN#26] Pepi I., line 475; Pepi II., line 1263.This bare statement of the dogma of the conception of Horus does notrepresent all that is known about it, and it may well be supplementedby a passage from the Pyramid Texts,[FN#27] which reads, \"Adoration tothee, O Osiris.[FN#28] Rise thou up on thy left side, place thyself onthy right side.

By a carefulexamination of the construction of the text he proved that thenarrative on the stele was drawn up several hundreds of years after theevents described in it took place, and that its author was butimperfectly acquainted with the form of the Egyptian language in use in"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"the reign of Rameses II.

Zeit., 1883, pp. 54-60.[FN#37] Maspero, Les Contes Populaires, 3rd edit., p. 166.The legend, after enumerating the great names of Rameses II., goes onto state that the king was in the \"country of the two rivers,\" by whichwe are to understand some portion of Mesopotamia, the rivers being theTigris and Euphrates, and that the local chiefs were bringing to himtribute consisting of gold, lapis-lazuli, turquoise, and logs of woodfrom the Land of the God. It is difficult to understand how gold andlogs of wood from Southern Arabia and East Africa came to be producedas tribute by chiefs who lived so far to the north. Among those whosent gifts was the Prince of Bekhten, and at the head of all histribute he sent his eldest daughter, bearing his message of homage andduty. Now the maiden was beautiful, and the King of Egypt thought herso lovely that be took her to wife, and bestowed upon her the name \"Ra-neferu,\" which means something like the \"beauties of Ra.\" He took herback with him to Egypt, where she was installed as Queen.During the summer of the fifteenth year of his reign, whilst RamesesII. was celebrating a festival of Amen-Ra in the Temple of Luxor, onecame to him and reported that an envoy had arrived from the Prince ofBekhten, bearing with him many gifts for the Royal Wife Ra-neferu.When the envoy had been brought into the presence, he addressed wordsof homage to the king, and, having presented the gifts from his lord,he said that he had come to beg His Majesty to send a \"learned man,\"i.e., a magician, to Bekhten to attend Bent-enth-resh, His Majesty'ssister-in-law, who was stricken with some disease. Thereupon the kingsummoned the learned men of the House of Life, i.e., the members of thegreat College of Magic at Thebes, and the qenbetu officials, and whenthey had entered his presence, he commanded them to select a man of\"wise heart and deft fingers\" to go to Bekhten. The choice fell uponone Tehuti-em-heb, and His Majesty sent him to Bekhten with the envoy.When they arrived in Bekhten, Tehuti-em-heb found that the Princess"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Bent-enth-resh was possessed by an evil spirit which refused to beexorcised by him, and he was unable to cast out the devil. The Princeof Bekhten, seeing that the healing of his daughter was beyond thepower of the Egyptian, sent a second envoy to Rameses II., and besoughthim to send a god to drive out the devil. This envoy arrived in Egyptin the summer of the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Rameses II., andfound the king celebrating a festival in Thebes. When he heard thepetition of the envoy, he went to the Temple of Khensu Nefer-hetep \"asecond time,\"[FN#38] and presented himself before the god and besoughthis help on behalf of his sister-in-law.[FN#38] Thus the king must have invoked the help of Khensu on theoccasion of the visit of the first envoy.Then the priests of Khensu Nefer-hetep carried the statue of this godto the place where was the statue of Khensu surnamed \"Pa-ari-sekher,\"i.e., the \"Worker of destinies,\" who was able to repel the attacks ofevil spirits and to drive them out. When the statues of the two godswere facing each other, Rameses II. entreated Khensu Nefer-hetep to\"turn his face towards,\" i.e., to look favourably upon Khensu. Pa-ari-sekher, and to let him go to Bekhten to drive the devil out of thePrincess of Bekhten. The text affords no explanation of the fact thatKhensu Nefer-hetep was regarded as a greater god than Khensu Pa-ari-sekher, or why his permission had to be obtained before the lattercould leave the country. It is probable that the demands made uponKhensu Nefer-hetep by the Egyptians who lived in Thebes and itsneighbourhood were so numerous that it was impossible to let his statuego into outlying districts or foreign lands, and that a deputy-god wasappointed to perform miracles outside Thebes. This arrangement wouldbenefit the people, and would, moreover, bring much money to thepriests. The appointment of a deputy-god is not so strange as it mayseem, and modern African peoples are familiar with the expedient.About one hundred years ago the priests of the god Bobowissi ofWinnebah, in the Tshi region of West Africa, found their business solarge that it was absolutely necessary for them to appoint a deputy.The priests therefore selected Brahfo, i.e., \"deputy,\" and gave outthat Bobowissi had deputed all minor matters to him, and that hisutterances were to be regarded as those of Bobowissi. Delegates wereordered to be sent to Winnebah in Ashanti, where they would be shownthe \"deputy\" god by the priests, and afterwards he would be taken toMankassim, where he would reside, and do for the people all thatBobowissi had done hitherto.[FN#39][FN#39] Ellis, Tshi-speaking Peoples, p. 55.When Rameses II. had made his petition to Khensu Nefer-hetep, thestatue of the god bowed its head twice, in token of assent. Here it isclear that we have an example of the use of statues with movable limbs,which were worked, when occasion required, by the priests. The king"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"then made a second petition to the god to transfer his sa, or magicalpower, to Khensu Pa-ari-sekher so that when he had arrived in Bekhtenhe would be able to heal the Princess. Again the statue of KhensuNefer-hetep bowed its head twice, and the petition of the king wasgranted. The text goes on to say that the magical power of the greatergod was transferred to the lesser god four times, or in a fourfoldmeasure, but we are not told how this was effected. We know from manypassages in the texts that every god was believed to possess thismagical power, which is called the \"sa of life,\" or the \"sa of thegod,\".[FN#40] This sa could be transferred by a god or goddess to ahuman being, either by an embrace or through some offering which waseaten. Thus Temu transferred the magical power of his life to Shu andTefnut by embracing them,[FN#41] and in the Ritual of the DivineCult[FN#42] the priest says, The two vessels of milk of Temu are the \"saof my limbs.\" The man who possessed this sa could transfer it to hisfriend by embracing him and then \"making passes\" with his hands alonghis back. The sa could be received by a man from a god and thentransmitted by him to a statue by taking it in his arms, and thisceremony was actually performed by the king in the Ritual of the DivineCult.[FN#43] The primary source of this sa was Ra, who bestowed itwithout measure on the blessed dead,[FN#44] and caused them to live forever thereby. These, facts make it tolerably certain that the magicalpower of Khensu Nefer-hetep was transferred to Khensu Pa-ari-sekher inone of two ways: either the statue of the latter was brought near tothat of the former and it received the sa by contact, or the highpriest first received the sa from the greater god and then transmittedit to the lesser god by embraces and \"passes\" with his hands. Be thisas it may, Khensu Pa-ari-sekher received the magical power, and havingbeen placed in his boat, he set out for Bekhten, accompanied by fivesmaller boats, and chariots and horses which marched on each side ofhim.[FN#40] Text of Unas, line 562.[FN#41] Pyramid Texts, Pepi I., l. 466.[FN#42] Ed. Moret, p. 21.[FN#43] Ibid., p. 99.[FN#44] Pepi I., line 666.When after a journey of seventeen months Khensu Pa-ari-sekher arrivedin Bekhten, he was cordially welcomed by the Prince, and, having goneto the place where the Princess who was possessed of a devil lived, heexercised his power to such purpose that she was healed immediately.Moreover, the devil which had been cast out admitted that Khensu Pa-ari-sekher was his master, and promised that he would depart to theplace whence he came, provided that the Prince of Bekhten wouldcelebrate a festival in his honour before his departure. Meanwhilethe Prince and his soldiers stood by listening to the conversationbetween the god and the devil, and they were very much afraid.Following the instructions of Khensu Pa-ari-sekher the Prince made"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"a great feast in honour of the supernatural visitors, and then thedevil departed to the \"place which he loved,\" and there was generalrejoicing in the land. The Prince of Bekhten was so pleased with theEgyptian god that he determined not to allow him to return to Egypt.When the statue of Khensu Pa-ari-sekher had been in Bekhten for threeyears and nine months, the Prince in a vision saw the god, in the formof a golden hawk, come forth from his shrine, and fly up into the airand direct his course to Egypt. Realizing that the statue of the godwas useless without its indwelling spirit, the Prince of Bekhtenpermitted the priests of Khensu Pa-ari-sekher to depart with it toEgypt, and dismissed them with gifts of all kinds. In due course theyarrived in Egypt and the priests took their statue to the temple ofKhensu Nefer-hetep, and handed over to that god all the gifts which thePrince of Bekhten had given them, keeping back nothing for their owngod. After this Khensu Pa-ari-sekher returned to his temple in peace,in the thirty-third year of the reign of Rameses II., having beenabsent from it about eight years.VII.A LEGEND OF KHNEMU AND OF A SEVEN YEARS' FAMINE.The text of this most interesting legend is found in hieroglyphics onone side of a large rounded block of granite some eight or nine feethigh, which stands on the south-east portion of Sahal, a little islandlying in the First Cataract, two or three miles to the south ofElephantine Island and the modern town of Aswan. The inscription isnot cut into the rock in the ordinary way, but was \"stunned\" on it witha blunted chisel, and is, in some lights, quite invisible to anyonestanding near the rock, unless he is aware of its existence. It is infull view of the river-path which leads from Mahallah to Philae, andyet it escaped the notice of scores of travellers who have searched therocks and islands in the Cataract for graffiti and inscriptions. Theinscription, which covers a space six feet by five feet, was discoveredaccidentally on February 6th, 1889, by the late Mr. C. E. Wilbour, adistinguished American gentleman who spent many years in research inEgypt. He first copied the text, discovering in the course of his workthe remarkable nature of its contents and then his friend Mr. Maudslayphotographed it. The following year he sent prints from Mr. Maudslay'snegatives to Dr. Brugsch, who in the course of 1891 published atranscript of the text with a German translation and notes in a workentitled Die biblischen sieben Jahre der Hungersnoth, Leipzig, 8vo.The legend contained in this remarkable text describes a terriblefamine which took place in the reign of Tcheser, a king of the IIIrdDynasty, and lasted for seven years. Insufficient Nile-floods were, ofcourse, the physical cause of the famine, but the legend shows that the\"low Niles\" were brought about by the neglect of the Egyptians inrespect of the worship of the god of the First Cataract, the great god"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Khnemu. When, according to the legend, king Tcheser had been made tobelieve that the famine took place because men had ceased to worshipKhnemu in a manner appropriate to his greatness, and when he had takensteps to remove the ground of complaint, the Nile rose to itsaccustomed height, the crops became abundant once more, and all miserycaused by scarcity of provisions ceased. In other words, when Tcheserrestored the offerings of Khnemu, and re-endowed his sanctuary and hispriesthood, the god allowed Hapi to pour forth his streams from thecaverns in the Cataract, and to flood the land with abundance. Thegeneral character of the legend, as we have it here, makes it quitecertain that it belongs to a late period, and the forms of thehieroglyphics and the spellings of the words indicate that the text was\"stunned\" on the rock in the reign of one of the Ptolemies, probably ata time when it was to the interest of some men to restore the worshipof Khnemu, god of the First Cataract. These interested people couldonly have been the priests of Khnemu, and the probability that this wasso becomes almost a certainty when we read in the latter part of thetext the list of the tolls and taxes which they were empowered to levyon the merchants, farmers, miners, etc., whose goods passed down theCataract into Egypt. Why, if this be the case, they should have chosento connect the famine with the reign of Tcheser is not clear. They mayhave wished to prove the great antiquity of the worship of Khnemu, butit would have been quite easy to select the name of some king of theIst Dynasty, and had they done this, they would have made the authorityof Khnemu over the Nile coaeval with Dynastic civilization. It isimpossible to assume that no great famine took place in Egypt betweenthe reign of Tcheser and the period when the inscription was made, andwhen we consider this fact the choice by the editor of the legend of afamine which took place under the IIIrd Dynasty to illustrate the powerof Khnemu seems inexplicable.Of the famines which must have taken place in the Dynastic period theinscriptions tell us nothing, but the story of the seven years' faminementioned in the Book of Genesis shows that there is nothing improbablein a famine lasting so long in Egypt. Arab historians also mentionseveral famines which lasted for seven years. That which took place inthe years 1066-1072 nearly ruined the whole country. A cake of breadwas sold for 15 dinanir, (the dinar = 10s.), a horse was sold for 20, adog for 5, a cat for 3, and an egg for 1 dinar. When all the animalswere eaten men began to eat each other, and human flesh was sold inpublic. \"Passengers were caught in the streets by hooks let down fromthe windows, drawn up, killed, and cooked.\"[FN#45] During the faminewhich began in 1201 people ate human flesh habitually. Parents killedand cooked their own children, and a wife was found eating her husbandraw. Baby fricassee and haggis of children's heads were ordinaryarticles of diet. The graves even were ransacked for food. An ox soldfor 70 dinanir. [FN#46][FN#45] Lane Poole, Middle Ages, p. 146.[FN#46] Ibid., p. 216.The legend begins with the statement that in the 18th year of the reign"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"of King Tcheser, when Matar, the Erpa Prince and Ha, was the Governorof the temple properties of the South and North, and was also theDirector of the Khenti men at Elephantine (Aswan), a royal despatch wasdelivered to him, in which the king said: \"I am in misery on my throne.My heart is very sore because of the calamity which hath happened, forthe Nile hath not come forth[FN#47] for seven years. There is nograin, there are no vegetables, there is no food, and every man isrobbing his neighbour. Men wish to walk, but they are unable to move;the young man drags along his limbs, the hearts of the aged are crushedwith despair, their legs fail them, they sink to the ground, and theyclutch their bodies with their hands in pain. The councillors aredumb, and nothing but wind comes out of the granaries when they areopened. Everything is in a state of ruin.\" A more graphic picture ofthe misery caused by the famine could hardly be imagined. The kingthen goes on to ask Matar where the Nile is born? what god or goddesspresides over it? and what is his [or her] form? He says he would liketo go to the temple of Thoth to enquire of that god, to go to theCollege of the Magicians, and search through the sacred books in orderto find out these things.[FN#47] i.e., there have been insufficient Nile-floods.When Matar had read the despatch, he set out to go to the king, andexplained to him the things which he wished to know. He told him that,the Nile rose near the city of Elephantine, that it flowed out of twocaverns, which were the breasts of the Nile-god, that it rose to aheight of twenty-eight cubits at Elephantine, and to the height ofseven cubits at Sma-Behutet, or, Diospolis Parva in the Delta. He whocontrolled the Nile was Khnemu, and when this god drew the bolt of thedoors which shut in the stream, and smote the earth with his sandals,the river rushed forth. Matar also described to the king the form ofKhnemu, which was that of Shu, and the work which he did, and thewooden house in which he lived, and its exact position, which was nearthe famous granite quarries. The gods who dwelt with Khnemu were thegoddess Sept (Sothis, or the Dog-star), the goddess Anqet, Hap (orHep), the Nile-god, Shu, Keb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Horus.Thus we see that the priests of Khnemu made him to be the head of aCompany of Gods. Finally Matar gave the king a list of all the stones,precious and otherwise, which were found in and about Elephantine.When the king, who had, it seems, come to Elephantine, heard thesethings he rejoiced greatly, and he went into the temple of Khnemu.The priests drew back the curtains and sprinkled him with holy water,and then he passed into the shrine and offered up a great sacrifice ofbread-cakes, beer, geese, oxen, and all kinds of good things, to thegods and goddesses who dwelt at Elephantine, in the place called \"Couchof the heart in life and power.\" Suddenly he found himself standingface to face with the god Khnemu, whom he placated with a peace-offering and with prayer. Then the god opened his eyes, and bent hisbody towards the king, and spake to him mighty words, saying, \"I amKhnemu, who made thee. My hands knitted together thy body and made itsound, and I gave thee thy heart.\" Khnemu then went on to complainthat, although the ground under the king's feet was filled with stones"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"and metal, men were too inert to work them and to employ them inrepairing or rebuilding of the shrines of the gods, or in doing whatthey ought to do for him, their Lord and Creator. These words were, ofcourse, meant as a rebuke for the king, who evidently, though it is notso stated in the text, was intended by Khnemu to undertake therebuilding of his shrine without delay. The god then went on toproclaim his majesty and power, and declared himself to be Nu, theCelestial Ocean, and the Nile-god, \"who came into being at thebeginning, and riseth at his will to give health to him that labourethfor Khnemu.\" He described himself as the Father of the gods, theGovernor of the earth and of men, and then he promised the king to makethe Nile rise yearly, regularly, and unceasingly, to give abundantharvests, to give all people their heart's desire, to make misery topass away, to fill the granaries, and to make the whole land of Egyptyellow with waving fields of full ripe grain. When the king, who hadbeen in a dream, heard the god mention crops, he woke up, and hiscourage returned to him, and having cast away despair from his heart heissued a decree by which he made ample provision for the maintenance ofthe worship of the god in a fitting state. In this decree, the firstcopy of which was cut upon wood, the king endowed Khnemu with 20schoinoi of land on each side of the river, with gardens, etc. It wasfurther enacted that every man who drew water from the Nile for hisland should contribute a portion of his crops to the god. Fishermen,fowlers, and hunters were to pay an octroi duty of one-tenth of thevalue of their catches when they brought them into the city, and atithe of the cattle was to be set apart for the daily sacrifice. Themasters of caravans coming from the Sudan were to pay a tithe also, butthey were not liable to any further tax in the country northwards.Every metal-worker, ore-crusher, miner, mason, and handicraftsman ofevery kind, was to pay to the temple of the god one-tenth of the valueof the material produced or worked by his labour. The decree providedalso for the appointment of an inspector whose duty it would be toweigh the gold, silver and copper which came into the town ofElephantine, and to assess the value both of these metals and of theprecious stones, etc., which were to be devoted to the service ofKhnemu. All materials employed in making the images of the gods, andall handicraftsmen employed in the work were exempted from tithing. Inshort, the worship of the god and his company was to be maintainedaccording to ancient use and wont, and the people were to supply thetemple with everything necessary in a generous spirit and with aliberal hand. He who failed in any way to comply with the enactmentswas to be beaten with the rope, and the name of Tcheser was to beperpetuated in the temple.VIII.THE LEGEND OF THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF HORUS, AND OTHER MAGICALTEXTS."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The magical and religious texts of the Egyptians of all periods containspells intended to be used against serpents, scorpions, and noxiousreptiles of all kinds, and their number, and the importance which wasattached to them, suggest that Egypt must always have produced thesepests in abundance, and that the Egyptians were always horribly afraidof them. The text of Unas, which was written towards the close of theVth Dynasty, contains many such spells, and in the Theban and SaiteBooks of the Dead several Chapters consist of nothing but spells andincantations, many of which are based on archaic texts, againstcrocodiles, serpents, and other deadly reptiles, and insects of allkinds. All such creatures were regarded as incarnations of evilspirits, which attack the dead as well as the living, and therefore itwas necessary for the well-being of the former that copies of spellsagainst them should be written upon the walls of tombs, coffins,funerary amulets, etc. The gods were just as open to the attacks ofvenomous reptiles as man, and Ra, himself, the king of the gods, nearlydied from the poison of a snake-bite. Now the gods were, as a rule,able to defend themselves against the attacks of Set and his fiends,and the poisonous snakes and insects which were their emissaries, byvirtue of the fluid of life, which was the peculiar attribute ofdivinity, and the efforts of Egyptians were directed to the acquisitionof a portion of this magical power, which would protect their souls andbodies and their houses and cattle, and other property, each day andeach night throughout the year. When a man cared for the protection ofhimself only he wore an amulet of some kind, in which the fluid of lifewas localized. When he wished to protect his house against invasion byvenomous reptiles he placed statues containing the fluid of life inniches in the walls of various chambers, or in some place outside butnear the house, or buried them in the earth with their faces turned inthe direction from which he expected the attack to come.PLATE XVII.The Metternich Stele--Obverse.PLATE XVIII.The Metternich Stele--Reverse.Towards the close of the XXVIth Dynasty, when superstition in its mostexaggerated form was general in Egypt, it became the custom to makehouse talismans in the form of small stone stelae, with rounded tops,which rested on bases having convex fronts. On the front of such atalisman was sculptured in relief a figure of Horus the Child(Harpokrates), standing on two crocodiles, holding in his hands figuresof serpents, scorpions, a lion, and a horned animal, each of thesebeing a symbol of an emissary or ally of Set, the god of Evil. Abovehis head was the head of Bes, and on each side of him were: solarsymbols, i.e., the lily of Nefer-Tem, figures of Ra and Harmakhis, theEyes of Ra (the Sun and Moon), etc. The reverse of the stele and thewhole of the base were covered with magical texts and spells, and whena talisman of this kind was placed in a house, it was supposed to bedirectly under the protection of Horus and his companion gods, who had"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"vanquished all the hosts of darkness and all the powers of physical andmoral evil. Many examples of this talisman are to be seen in the greatMuseums of Europe, and there are several fine specimens in the ThirdEgyptian Room in the British Museum. They are usually called \"Cippi ofHorus.\" The largest and most important of all these \"cippi\" is thatwhich is commonly known as the \"Metternich Stele,\" because it was givento Prince Metternich by Muhammad `Ali Pasha; it was dug up in 1828during the building of a cistern in a Franciscan Monastery inAlexandria, and was first published, with a translation of a large partof the text, by Professor Golenischeff.[FN#48] The importance of thestele is enhanced by the fact that it mentions the name of the king inwhose reign it was made, viz., Nectanebus I., who reigned from B.C. 378to B.C. 360.[FN#48] See Metternichstele, Leipzig, 1877. The Stele was made forAnkh-Psemthek, son of the lady Tent-Het-nub, prophet of Nebun, overseerof Temt and scribe of Het (see line 87).The obverse, reverse, and two sides of the Metternich Stele have cutupon them nearly three hundred figures of gods and celestial beings.These include figures of the great gods of heaven, earth, and the OtherWorld, figures of the gods of the planets and the Dekans, figures ofthe gods of the days of the week, of the weeks, and months, and seasonsof the year, and of the year. Besides these there are a number offigures of local forms of the gods which it is difficult to identify.On the rounded portion of the obverse the place of honour is held bythe solar disk, in which is seen a figure of Khnemu with four ram'sheads, which rests between a pair of arms, and is supported on a lakeof celestial water; on each side of it are four of the spirits of thedawn, and on the right stands the symbol of the rising sun, Nefer-Temu,and on the left stands Thoth. Below this are five rows of smallfigures of gods. Below these is Harpokrates in relief, in the attitudealready described. He stands on two crocodiles under a kind of canopy,the sides of which are supported by Thoth and Isis, and holds Typhonicanimals and reptiles. Above the canopy are the two Eyes of Ra, eachhaving a pair of human arms and hands. On the right of Harpokrates areSeker and Horus, and on his left the symbol of Nefer-Temu. On the leftand right are the goddesses Nekhebet and Uatchet, who guard the Southof Egypt and the North respectively. On the reverse and sides arenumerous small figures of gods. This stele represented the power toprotect man possessed by all the divine beings in the universe, and,however it was placed, it formed an impassable barrier to every spiritof evil and to every venomous reptile. The spells, which are cut inhieroglyphics on all the parts of the stele not occupied by figures ofgods, were of the most potent character, for they contained the actualwords by which the gods vanquished the powers of darkness and evil.These spells form the texts which are printed on p. 142 ff., and may bethus summarized:--The first spell is an incantation directed against reptiles and noxiouscreatures in general. The chief of these was Apep, the great enemy ofRa, who took the form of a huge serpent that \"resembled theintestines,\" and the spell doomed him to decapitation, and burning and"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"backing in pieces. These things would be effected by Serqet, theScorpion-goddess. The second part of the spell was directed againstthe poison of Apep, and was to be recited over anyone who was bitten bya snake. When uttered by Horus it made Apep to vomit, and when used bya magician properly qualified would make the bitten person to vomit,and so free his body from the poison.The next spell is directed to be said to the Cat, i.e., a symbol of thedaughter of Ra, or Isis, who had the head of Ra, the eyes of theuraeus, the nose of Thoth, the ears of Neb-er-tcher, the mouth of Tem,the neck of Neheb-ka, the breast of Thoth, the heart of Ra, the handsof the gods, the belly of Osiris, the thighs of Menthu, the legs ofKhensu, the feet of Amen-Horus, the haunches of Horus, the soles of thefeet of Ra, and the bowels of Meh-urit. Every member of the Catcontained a god or goddess, and she was able to destroy the poison ofany serpent, or scorpion, or reptile, which might be injected into herbody. The spell opens with an address to Ra, who is entreated to cometo his daughter, who has been stung by a scorpion on a lonely road, andto cause the poison to leave her body. Thus it seems as if Isis, thegreat magician, was at some time stung by a scorpion.The next section is very difficult to understand. Ra-Harmakhis iscalled upon to come to his daughter, and Shu to his wife, and Isis toher sister, who has been poisoned. Then the Aged One, i.e., Ra, isasked to let Thoth turn back Neha-her, or Set. \"Osiris is in thewater, but Horus is with him, and the Great Beetle overshadows him,\"and every evil spirit which dwells in the water is adjured to allowHorus to proceed to Osiris. Ra, Sekhet, Thoth, and Heka, this last-named being the spell personified, are the four great gods who protectOsiris, and who will blind and choke his enemies, and cut out theirtongues. The cry of the Cat is again referred to, and Ra is asked ifhe does not remember the cry which came from the bank of Netit. Theallusion here is to the cries which Isis uttered when she arrived atNetit near Abydos, and found lying there the dead body of her husband.At this point on the Stele the spells are interrupted by a longnarrative put into the mouth of Isis, which supplies us with someaccount of the troubles that she suffered, and describes the death ofHorus through the sting of a scorpion. Isis, it seems, was shut up insome dwelling by Set after he murdered Osiris, probably with theintention of forcing her to marry him, and so assist him to legalizehis seizure of the kingdom. Isis, as we have already seen, had beenmade pregnant by her husband after his death, and Thoth now appeared toher, and advised her to hide herself with her unborn child, and tobring him forth in secret, and he promised her that her son shouldsucceed in due course to his father's throne. With the help of Thothshe escaped from her captivity, and went forth accompanied by the SevenScorpion-goddesses, who brought her to the town of Per-Sui, on the edgeof the Reed Swamps. She applied to a woman for a night's shelter, butthe woman shut her door in her face. To punish her one of theScorpion-goddesses forced her way into the woman's house, and stung herchild to death. The grief of the woman was so bitter and sympathy-compelling that Isis laid her hands on the child, and, having utteredone of her most potent spells over him, the poison of the scorpion ranout of his body, and the child came to life again. The words of thespell are cut on the Stele, and they were treasured by the Egyptians asan infallible remedy for scorpion stings. When the woman saw that her"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"son had been brought back to life by Isis, she was filled with joy andgratitude, and, as a mark of her repentance, she brought largequantities of things from her house as gifts for Isis, and they were somany that they filled the house of the kind, but poor, woman who hadgiven Isis shelter.Now soon after Isis had restored to life the son of the woman who hadshown churlishness to her, a terrible calamity fell upon her, for herbeloved son Horus was stung by a scorpion and died. The news of thisevent was conveyed to her by the gods, who cried out to her to come tosee her son Horus, whom the terrible scorpion Uhat had killed. Isis,stabbed with pain at the news, as if a knife had been driven into herbody, ran out distraught with grief. It seems that she had gone toperform a religious ceremony in honour of Osiris in a temple nearHetep-hemt, leaving her child carefully concealed in Sekhet-An. Duringher absence the scorpion Uhat, which had been sent by Set, forced itsway into the biding-place of Horus, and there stung him to death. WhenIsis came and found the dead body, she burst forth in lamentations, thesound of which brought all the people from the neighbouring districtsto her side. As she related to them the history of her sufferings theyendeavoured to console her, and when they found this to be impossiblethey lifted up their voices and wept with her. Then Isis placed hernose in the mouth of Horus so that she might discover if he stillbreathed, but there was no breath in his throat; and when she examinedthe wound in his body made by the fiend Aun-Ab she saw in it traces ofpoison. No doubt about his death then remained in her mind, andclasping him in her arms she lifted him up, and in her transports ofgrief leaped about like fish when they are laid on red-hot coals. Thenshe uttered a series of heartbreaking laments, each of which beginswith the words \"Horus is bitten.\" The heir of heaven, the son of Un-Nefer, the child of the gods, he who was wholly fair, is bitten! Hefor whose wants I provided, he who was to avenge his father, is bitten!He for whom I cared and suffered when he was being fashioned in mywomb, is bitten! He whom I tended so that I might gaze upon him, isbitten! He whose life I prayed for is bitten! Calamity hath overtakenthe child, and he hath perished.Whilst Isis was saying these and many similar words, her sisterNephthys, who had been weeping bitterly for her nephew Horus as shewandered about among the swamps, came, in company with the Scorpion-goddess Serqet, and advised Isis to pray to heaven for help. Pray thatthe sailors in the Boat of Ra may cease from rowing, for the Boatcannot travel onwards whilst Horus lies dead. Then Isis cried out toheaven, and her voice reached the Boat of Millions of Years, and theDisk ceased to move onward, and came to a standstill. From the BoatThoth descended, being equipped with words of power and spells of allkinds, and bearing with him the \"great command of maa-kheru,\" i.e., theWORD, whose commands were performed, instantly and completely, by everygod, spirit, fiend, human being and by every thing, animate andinanimate, in heaven, earth, and the Other World. Then he came to Isisand told her that no harm could possibly have happened to Horus, for hewas under the protection of the Boat of Ra; but his words failed tocomfort Isis, and though she acknowledged the greatness of his designs,she complained that they savoured of delay. \"What is the good,\" sheasks, \"of all thy spells, and incantations, and magical formulae, andthe great command of maa-kheru, if Horus is to perish by the poison of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"a scorpion, and to lie here in the arms of Death? Evil, evil is hisdestiny, for it hath entailed the deepest misery for him and death.\"In answer to these words Thoth, turning to Isis and Nephthys, bade themto fear not, and to have no anxiety about Horus, \"For,\" said he, \"Ihave come from heaven to heal the child for his mother.\" He thenpointed out that Horus was under protection as the Dweller in his Disk(Aten), the Great Dwarf, the Mighty Ram, the Great Hawk, the HolyBeetle, the Hidden Body, the Divine Bennu, etc., and proceeded to utterthe great spell which restored Horus to life. By his words of powerThoth transferred the fluid of life of Ra, and as soon as this cameupon the child's body the poison of the scorpion flowed out of him, andhe once more breathed and lived. When this was done Thoth returned tothe Boat of Ra, the gods who formed its crew resumed their rowing, andthe Disk passed on its way to make its daily journey across the sky.The gods in heaven, who were amazed and uttered cries of terror whenthey heard of the death of Horus, were made happy once more, and sangsongs of joy over his recovery. The happiness of Isis in her child'srestoration to life was very great, for she could again hope that hewould avenge his father's murder, and occupy his throne. The finalwords of Thoth comforted her greatly, for he told her that he wouldtake charge of the case of Horus in the Judgment Hall of Anu, whereinOsiris had been judged, and that as his advocate he would make anyaccusations which might be brought against Horus to recoil on him thatbrought them. Furthermore, he would give Horus power to repulse anyattacks which might be made upon him by beings in the heights above, orfiends in the depths below, and would ensure his succession to theThrone of the Two Lands, i.e., Egypt. Thoth also promised Isis that Rahimself should act as the advocate of Horus, even as he had done forhis father Osiris. He was also careful to allude to the share whichIsis had taken in the restoration of Horus to life, saying, \"It is thewords of power of his mother which have lifted up his face, and theyshall enable him to journey wheresoever he pleaseth, and to put fearinto the powers above. I myself hasten [to obey them].\" Thuseverything turned on the power of the spells of Isis, who made the sunto stand still, and caused the dead to be raised.Such are the contents of the texts on the famous Metternich Stele.There appears to be some confusion in their arrangement, and some ofthem clearly are misplaced, and, in places, the text is manifestlycorrupt. It is impossible to explain several passages, for we do notunderstand all the details of the system of magic which they represent.Still, the general meaning of the texts on the Stele is quite clear,and they record a legend of Isis and Horus which is not found so fullydescribed on any other monument.IX."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE HISTORY OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.The history of Isis and Osiris given on pp. 248 is taken from thefamous treatise of Plutarch entitled De Iside et Osiride, and forms afitting conclusion to this volume of Legends of the Gods. It containsall the essential facts given in Plutarch's work, and the only thingsomitted are his derivations and mythological speculations, which arereally unimportant for the Egyptologist. Egyptian literature is fullof allusions to events which took place in the life of Osiris, and tohis persecution, murder, and resurrection, and numerous texts of allperiods describe the love and devotion of his sister and wife Isis, andthe filial piety of Horus. Nowhere, however, have we in Egyptian aconnected account of the causes which led to the murder by Set ofOsiris, or of the subsequent events which resulted in his becoming theking of heaven and judge of the dead. However carefully we piecetogether the fragments of information which we can extract from nativeEgyptian literature, there still remains a series of gaps which canonly be filled by guesswork. Plutarch, as a learned man and a studentof comparative religion and mythology was most anxious to understandthe history of Isis and Osiris, which Greek and Roman scholars talkedabout freely, and which none of them comprehended, and he madeenquiries of priests and others, and examined critically suchinformation as he could obtain, believing and hoping that he wouldpenetrate the mystery in which these gods were wrapped. As a result ofhis labours he collected a number of facts about the form of the Legendof Isis and Osiris as it was known to the learned men of his day, butthere is no evidence that he had the slightest knowledge of the detailsof the original African Legend of these gods as it was known to theEgyptians, say, under the VIth Dynasty. Moreover, he never realizedthat the characteristics and attributes of both Isis and Osiris changedseveral times during the long history of Egypt, and that a thousandyears before he lived the Egyptians themselves had forgotten what theoriginal form of the legend was. They preserved a number ofceremonies, and performed very carefully all the details of an ancientritual at the annual commemoration festival of Osiris which was held inNovember and December, but the evidence of the texts makes it quiteclear that the meaning and symbolism of nearly all the details wereunknown alike to priests and people.An important modification of the cult of Isis and Osiris took place inthe third century before Christ, when the Ptolemies began toconsolidate their rule in Egypt. A form of religion which would beacceptable both to Egyptians and Greeks had to be provided, and thiswas produced by modifying the characteristics of Osiris and calling himSarapis, and identifying him with the Greek Pluto. To Isis were addedmany of the attributes of the great Greek goddesses, and into herworship were introduced \"mysteries\" derived from non-Egyptian cults,which made it acceptable to the people everywhere. Had a high priestof Osiris who lived at Abydos under the XVIIIth Dynasty witnessed thecelebration of the great festival of Isis and Osiris in any large townin the first century before Christ, it is tolerably certain that hewould have regarded it as a lengthy act of worship of strange gods, inwhich there appeared, here and there, ceremonies and phrases whichreminded him of the ancient Abydos ritual. When the form of the cult"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"of Isis and Osiris introduced by the Ptolemies into Egypt extended tothe great cities of Greece and Italy, still further modifications tookplace in it, and the characters of Isis and Osiris were still furtherchanged. By degrees Osiris came to be regarded as the god of deathpure and simple, or as the personification of Death, and he ceased tobe regarded as the great protecting ancestral spirit, and the all-powerful protecting Father of his people. As the importance of Osirisdeclined that of Isis grew, and men came to regard her as the greatMother-goddess of the world. The priests described from tradition thegreat facts of her life according to the Egyptian legends, how she hadbeen a loving and devoted wife, how she had gone forth after herhusband's murder by Set to seek for his body, how she had found it andbrought it home, how she revivified it by her spells and had union withOsiris and conceived by him, and how in due course she brought forthher son, in pain and sorrow and loneliness in the Swamps of the Delta,and how she reared him and watched over him until he was old enough tofight and vanquish his father's murderer, and how at length she seatedhim in triumph on his father's throne. These things endeared Isis tothe people everywhere, and as she herself had not suffered death likeOsiris, she came to be regarded as the eternal mother of life and ofall living things. She was the creatress of crops, she produced fruit,vegetables, plants of all kinds and trees, she made cattle prolific,she brought men and women together and gave them offspring, she was theauthoress of all love, virtue, goodness and happiness. She made thelight to shine, she was the spirit of the Dog-star which heralded theNile-flood, she was the source of the power in the beneficent light ofthe moon; and finally she took the dead to her bosom and gave thempeace, and introduced them to a life of immortality and happinesssimilar to that which she had bestowed upon Osiris.The message of the cult of Isis as preached by her priests was one ofhope and happiness, and coming to the Greeks and Romans, as it did, ata time when men were weary of their national cults, and when thespeculations of the philosophers carried no weight with the generalpublic, the people everywhere welcomed it with the greatest enthusiasm.From Egypt it was carried to the Islands of Greece and to the mainland,to Italy, Germany, France, Spain and Portugal, and then crossing thewestern end of the Mediterranean it entered North Africa, and withCarthage as a centre spread east and west along the coast. Whereverthe cult of Isis came men accepted it as something which supplied whatthey thought to be lacking in their native cults; rich and poor, gentleand simple, all welcomed it, and the philosopher as well as theignorant man rejoiced in the hope of a future life which it gave tothem. Its Egyptian origin caused it to be regarded with theprofoundest interest, and its priests were most careful to make thetemples of Isis quite different from those of the national gods, and todecorate them with obelisks, sphinxes, shrines, altars, etc., whichwere either imported from temples in Egypt, or were copied fromEgyptian originals. In the temples of Isis services were held atdaybreak and in the early afternoon daily, and everywhere these wereattended by crowds of people. The holy water used in the libations andfor sprinkling the people was Nile water, specially imported fromEgypt, and to the votaries of the goddess it symbolized the seed of thegod Osiris, which germinated and brought forth fruit through the spellsof the goddess Isis. The festivals and processions of Isis wereeverywhere most popular, and were enjoyed by learned and unlearnedalike. In fact, the Isis-play which was acted annually in November,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"and the festival of the blessing of the ship, which took place in thespring, were the most important festivals of the year. Curiouslyenough, all the oldest gods and goddesses of Egypt passed into absoluteoblivion, with the exception of Osiris (Sarapis), Isis, Anubis thephysician, and Harpokrates, the child of Osiris and Isis, and these,from being the ancestral spirits of a comparatively obscure Africantribe in early dynastic times, became for several hundreds of years theprincipal objects of worship of some of the most cultured andintellectual nations. The treatise of Plutarch De Iside helps toexplain how this came about, and for those who study the EgyptianLegend of Isis and Osiris the work has considerable importance.THE HISTORY OF CREATION--A.THE BOOK OF KNOWING THE EVOLUTIONS[FN#49] OF RA, AND OF OVERTHROWINGAPEP.[FN#49] Kheperu.

Her heart turned away in disgust from the millions of men, andshe chose for herself the millions of the gods, but esteemed morehighly the millions of the spirits. Was it not possible to become evenas was Ra in heaven and upon earth, and to make [herself] mistress ofthe earth, and a [mighty] goddess--thus she meditated in her heart--bythe knowledge of the Name of the holy god? Behold, Ra entered [heaven]each day at the head of his mariners, establishing himself upon thedouble throne of the two horizons. Now the divine one had become old,he dribbled at the mouth, and he let his emissions go forth from himupon the earth, and his spittle fell upon the ground. This Isiskneaded in her hand,[FN#66] with [some] dust, and she fashioned it inthe form of a sacred serpent, and made it to have the form of a dart,so that none might be able to escape alive from it, and she left itlying upon the road whereon the great god travelled, according to hisdesire, about the two lands. Then the holy god rose up in thetabernacle of the gods in the great double house (life, strength,health!) among those who were in his train, and [as] he journeyed onhis way according to his daily wont, the holy serpent shot its fanginto him, and the living fire was departing from the god's own body,and the reptile destroyed the dweller among the cedars.

Though it be the wise man's duty, O Clea,[FN#259] to apply to thegods for every good thing which he hopes to enjoy, yet ought he moreespecially to pray to them for their assistance in his search afterthat knowledge which more immediately regards themselves, as far assuch knowledge may be attained, inasmuch as there is nothing which theycan bestow more truly beneficial to mankind, or more worthy themselves,than truth. For whatever other good things are indulged to the wantsof men, they have all, properly speaking, no relation to, and are of anature quite different from, that of their divine donors. For 'tis notthe abundance of their gold and silver, nor the command of the thunder,but wisdom and knowledge which constitute the power and happiness ofthose heavenly beings. It is therefore well observed by Homer (Iliad,xiii. 354), and indeed with more propriety than be usually talks of thegods, when, speaking of Zeus and Poseidon, he tells us that both weredescended from the same parents, and born in the same region, but thatZeus was the elder and knew most; plainly intimating thereby that theempire of the former was more august and honourable than that of hisbrother, as by means of his age he was his superior, and more advancedin wisdom and science. Nay, 'tis my opinion, I own, that even theblessedness of that eternity which is the portion of the Deity himselfconsists in that universal knowledge of all nature which accompaniesit; for setting this aside, eternity might be more properly styled anendless duration than an enjoyment of existence."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"[FN#259] She is said to have been a priestess of Isis and of ApolloDelphicus.II. To desire, therefore, and covet after truth, those truths moreespecially which concern the divine nature, is to aspire to bepartakers of that nature itself, and to profess that all our studiesand inquiries are devoted to the acquisition of holiness. Thisoccupation is surely more truly religious than any externalpurifications or mere service of the temple can be. But moreespecially must such a disposition of mind be highly acceptable to thatgoddess to whose service you are dedicated, for her especialcharacteristics are wisdom and foresight, and her very name seems toexpress the peculiar relation which she bears to knowledge. For\"Isis\"[FN#260] is a Greek word, and means \"knowledge,\" and\"Typhon,\"[FN#261] the name of her professed adversary, is also a Greekword, and means \"pride and insolence.\" This latter name is welladapted to one who, full of ignorance and error, tears in pieces andconceals that holy doctrine which the goddess collects, compiles, anddelivers to those who aspire after the most perfect participation inthe divine nature. This doctrine inculcates a steady perseverance inone uniform and temperate course of life, and an abstinence fromparticular kinds of foods, as well as from all indulgence of the carnalappetite, and it restrains the intemperate and voluptuous part withindue bounds, and at the same time habituates her votaries to undergothose austere and rigid ceremonies which their religion obliges them toobserve. The end and aim of all these toils and labours is theattainment of the knowledge of the First and Chief Being, who alone isthe object of the understanding of the mind; and this knowledge thegoddess invites us to seek after, as being near and dwellingcontinually with her. And this also is what the very name of hertemple promiseth to us, that is to say, the knowledge and understandingof the eternal and self-existent Being (tou ontas)-now, it is called\"Iseion,\" which suggests that if we approach the temple of the goddessrightly, and with purity, we shall obtain the knowledge of that eternaland self-existent Being (to on).[FN#260] The Egyptian form of the name is As-T, ####, ####, or ####.Plutarch wishes to derive the name from some form of {greek oida}.[FN#261] In Egyptian, Tebh.III. The goddess Isis is said by some authors to be thedaughter[FN#262] of Hermes, [FN#263] and by others of Prometheus, bothof them famous for their philosophic turn of mind.

Now, by the former ofthese are meant such who carry about them looked up in their souls, asin a chest, the sacred doctrine concerning the gods, purified from allsuch superfluities as superstition may have added thereto. And theholy apparel with which the Hierostoli adorn the statues of thesedeities, which is partly of a dark and gloomy and partly of a morebright and shining colour, seems aptly enough to represent the notionswhich this doctrine teaches us to entertain of the divine natureitself, partly clear and partly obscure. And inasmuch as the devoteesof Isis after their decease are wrapped up in these sacred vestments,is not this intended to signify that this holy doctrine still abideswith them, and that this alone accompanies them in another life? Foras 'tis not the length of the beard or the coarseness of the habitwhich makes a philosopher, so neither will these frequent shavings, orthe mere wearing of a linen vestment, constitute a votary of Isis. Healone is a true servant or follower of this goddess who, after he hasheard, and has been made acquainted in a proper manner with the historyof the actions of these gods, searches into the hidden truths which lieconcealed under them, and examines the whole by the dictates of reasonand philosophy.[FN#264] The Hermopolis here referred to is the city of Khemenu inUpper Egypt, wherein was the great sanctuary of Thoth.[FN#265] i.e., Righteousness, or Justice. The goddess referred to isprobably Maat.IV. Nor, indeed, ought such an examination to be looked on asunnecessary whilst there are so many ignorant of the true reason evenof the most ordinary rites observed by the Egyptian priests, such astheir shavings[FN#266] and wearing linen garments.

They are continually mourning fortheir gods, therefore they shave themselves. The light azure blossomof the flax resembles the clear and bloomy colour of the ethereal sky,therefore they wear linen\"; whereas the true reason of the institutionand observation of these rites is but one, and that common to all ofthem, namely, the extraordinary notions which they entertain ofcleanliness, persuaded as they are, according to the saying of Plato,\"none but the pure ought to approach the pure.\" Now, no superfluity ofour food, and no excrementitious substance, is looked upon by them aspure and clean; such, however, are all kinds of wool and down, our hairand our nails. It would be the highest absurdity, therefore, for thosewho, whilst; they are in a course of purification, are at so much painsto take off the hair from every part of their own bodies, at the sametime to clothe themselves with that of other animals. So when we aretold by Hesiod \"not to pare our nails whilst we are present at thefestivals of the gods,\"[FN#268] we ought to understand that he intendedhereby to inculcate that purity wherewith we ought to come preparedbefore we enter upon any religious duty, that we have not to makeourselves clean whilst we ought to be occupied in attending to thesolemnity itself. Now, with regard to flax, this springs out of theimmortal earth itself; and not only produces a fruit fit for food, butmoreover furnishes a light and neat sort of clothing, extremelyagreeable to the wearer, adapted to all the seasons of the year, andnot in the least subject, as is said, to produce or nourish vermin; butmore of this in another place.[FN#266] A rubric in the papyrus of Nes-Menu in the British Museumorders the priestesses of Isis and Nephthys to have \"the hair of theirbodies shaved off\" (No. 10,188, col. 1), but they are also ordered towear fillets of rams' wool on their heads.[FN#267] Probably the ram of Amen. Animal sacrifices were invariablybulls and cows.[FN#268] This saying is by Pythagoras--{greek Para dusianmh`onuxizou}.

Now, the priests are so scrupulous in endeavouring to avoideverything which may tend to the increase of the above-mentionedexcrementitious substances, that, on this account, they abstain notonly from most sorts of pulse, and from the flesh of sheep and swine,but likewise, in their more solemn purifications, they even exclude"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"salt from their meals. This they do for many reasons, but chieflybecause it whets their appetites, and incites them to eat more thanthey otherwise would. Now, as to salt being accounted impure because,as Aristagoras tells us, many little insects are caught in it whilst itis hardening, and are thereby killed therein-this view is whollytrifling and absurd. From these same motives also they give the ApisBull his water from a well specially set apart for the purpose,[FN#269]and they prevent him altogether from drinking of the Nile, not indeedthat they regard the river as impure, and polluted because of thecrocodiles which are in it, as some pretend, for there is nothing whichthe Egyptians hold in greater veneration than the Nile, but because itswaters are observed to be particularly nourishing[FN#270] andfattening. And they strive to prevent fatness in Apis as well as inthemselves, for they are anxious that their bodies should sit as lightand easy about their souls as possible, and that their mortal partshould not oppress and weigh down the divine and immortal.[FN#269] It is quite possible that Apis drank from a special well, butthe water in it certainly came from the Nile by infiltration. In allthe old wells at Memphis the water sinks as the Nile sinks, and risesas it rises.[FN#270] On account of the large amount of animal matter contained init.VI. The priests of the Sun at Heliopolis[FN#271] never carry wine intotheir temples, for they regard it as indecent for those who are devotedto the service of any god to indulge in the drinking of wine whilstthey are under the immediate inspection of their Lord and King.[FN#272]The priests of the other deities are not so scrupulous in this respect,for they use it, though sparingly. During their more solemnpurifications they abstain from wine wholly, and they give themselvesup entirely to study and meditation, and to the hearing and teaching ofthose divine truths which treat of the divine nature. Even the kings,who are likewise priests, only partake of wine in the measure which isprescribed for them in the sacred books, as we are told by Hecataeus.This custom was only introduced during the reign of Psammetichus, andbefore that time they drank no wine at all. If they used it at anytime in pouring out libations to the gods, it was not because theylooked upon it as being acceptable to them for its own sake, but theypoured it out over their altars as the blood of their enemies who hadin times past fought against them. For they believe the vine to havefirst sprung out of the earth after it was fattened by the bodies ofthose who fell in the wars against the gods. And this, they say, isthe reason why drinking its juice in great quantities makes men mad andbeside themselves, filling them, as it were, with the blood of theirown ancestors.

It is the \"On\" of the Bible.[FN#272] The Sun-god was called Ra.VII. As to sea-fish, the Egyptians in general do not abstain from allkinds of them, but some from one sort and some from another. Thus, forexample, the inhabitants of Oxyrhynchus[FN#273] will not touch any thathave been taken with an angle; for as they pay especial reverence tothe Oxyrhynchus Fish,[FN#274] from whence they derive their name, theyare afraid lest perhaps the hook may be defiled by having been at sometime or other employed in catching their favourite fish. The people ofSyene[FN#275] in like manner abstain from the Phagrus Fish[FN#276]; foras this fish is observed by them to make his first appearance upontheir coasts just as the Nile begins to overflow, they pay specialregard to these voluntary messengers as it were of that most joyfulnews. The priests, indeed, entirely abstain from all sorts ingeneral.[FN#277] Therefore, upon the ninth day of the first month,when all the rest of the Egyptians are obliged by their religion to eata fried fish before the door of their houses, they only burn them, nottasting them at all. For this custom they give two reasons: the firstand most curious, as falling in with the sacred philosophy of Osirisand Typhon, will be more properly explained in another place. Thesecond, that which is most obvious and manifest, is that fish isneither a dainty nor even a necessary kind of food, a fact which seemsto be abundantly confirmed by the writings of Homer, who never makeseither the delicate Pheacians or the Ithacans (though both peoples wereislanders) to feed upon fish, nor even the companions of Ulysses duringtheir long and most tedious voyage, till they were reduced thereto byextreme necessity. In short, they consider the sea to have been forcedout of the earth by the power of fire, and therefore to lie out ofnature's confines; and they regard it not as a part of the world, orone of the elements, but as a preternatural and corrupt and morbidexcrement.[FN#273] The Per-Matchet.[FN#274] Probably the pike, or \"fighting fish.\"[FN#275] In Egyptian, SUNU, the Seweneh of the Bible, and the modernAswan.[FN#276] A kind of bream, the an of the Egyptian texts.[FN#277] Compare Chap. CXXXVIIA of the Book of the Dead. \"And behold,these things shall be performed by a man who is clean, and isceremonially pure, one who hath eaten neither meat nor fish, and whohath not had intercourse with women\" (ll. 52, 53)."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"VIII. This much may be depended upon: the, religious rites andceremonies of the Egyptians were never instituted upon irrationalgrounds, never built upon mere fable and superstition, but founded witha view to promote the morality and happiness of those who were toobserve them, or at least to preserve the memory of some valuable pieceof history, or to represent to us some of the phenomena of nature. Asconcerning the abhorrence which is expressed for onions, it is whollyimprobable that this detestation is owing to the loss of Diktys, who,whilst he was under the guardianship of Isis, is supposed to havefallen into the river and to have been drowned as he was reaching aftera bunch of them. No, the true reason of their abstinence from onionsis because they are observed to flourish most and to be in the greatestvigour at the wane of the moon, and also because they are entirelyuseless to them either in their feasts[FN#278] or in their times ofabstinence and purification, for in the former case they make tearscome from those who use them, and in the latter they create thirst.For much the same reason they likewise look upon the pig as an impureanimal, and to be avoided, observing it to be most apt to engender uponthe decrease of the moon, and they think that those who drink its milkare more subject to leprosy and such-like cutaneous diseases thanothers. The custom of abstaining from the flesh of the pig[FN#279] isnot always observed, for those who sacrifice a sow to Typhon once ayear, at the full moon, afterwards eat its flesh. The reason they givefor this practice is this: Typhon being in pursuit of this animal atthat season of the moon, accidentally found the wooden chest whereinwas deposited the body of Osiris, which he immediately pulled topieces. This story, however, is not generally admitted, there beingsome who look upon it, as they do many other relations of the samekind, as founded upon some mistake or misrepresentation. All agree,however, in saying that so great was the abhorrence which the ancientEgyptians expressed for whatever tended to promote luxury, expense, andvoluptuousness, that in order to expose it as much as possible theyerected a column in one of the temples of Thebes, full of cursesagainst their king Meinis, who first drew them off from their formerfrugal and parsimonious course of life. The immediate cause for theerection of the pillar is thus given: Technatis,[FN#280] the father ofBocchoris, leading an army against the Arabians, and his baggage andprovisions not coming up to him as soon as he expected, was thereforeobliged to eat some of the very poor food which was obtainable, andhaving eaten, he lay down on the bare ground and slept very soundly.This gave him a great affection for a mean and frugal diet, and inducedhim to curse the memory of Meinis, and with the permission of thepriests he made these curses public by cutting them upon apillar.[FN#281][FN#278] Bunches of onions were offered to the dead at all periods ofEgyptian history, and they were regarded as typical of the \"whiteteeth\" of Horus. The onion was largely used in medicine.[FN#279] The pig was associated with Set, or Typhon, and the blackvariety was specially abominated because it was a black pig whichstruck Horus in the eye, and damaged it severely.

To thispurpose, likewise, is that inscription which they have engraved uponthe base of the statue of Athene[FN#282] at Sais, whom they identifywith Isis: \"I am everything that has been, that is, and that shall be:and my veil no man hath raised.\" In like manner the word \"Amoun,\" oras it is expressed in the Greek language, \"Ammon,\" which is generallylooked upon as the proper name of the Egyptian Zeus, is interpreted byManetho[FN#283] the Sebennite[FN#284] to signify \"concealment\" or\"something which is hidden.\"[FN#285] Hecataeus of Abdera indeed tellsus that the Egyptians make use of this term when they call out to oneanother. If this be so, then their invoking Amoun is the same thing ascalling upon the supreme being, whom they believe to be \"hidden\" and\"concealed\" in the universal nature, to appear and manifest itself tothem. So cautious and reserved was the Egyptian wisdom in those thingswhich appertained to religion.[FN#282] The Egyptian goddess Net, in Greek {greek Nhid}, the greatgoddess of Sais, in the Western Delta. She was self-existent, andproduced her son, the Sun-god, without union with a god. In an addressto her, quoted by Mallet (Culte de Neit, p. 140), are found the words,\"thy garment hath not been unloosed,\" thus Plutarch's quotation iscorrect.[FN#283] He compiled a History of Egypt for Ptolemy II., andflourished about B.C. 270; only the King-List from this work ispreserved.[FN#284] He was a native of the town of Sebennytus.[FN#285] Amen means \"hidden,\" and AMEN is the \"hidden god.\"X. And this is still farther evinced from those voyages which havebeen made into Egypt by the wisest men among the Greeks, namely, bySolo, Thales Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and, as some say, even byLycurgus himself, on purpose to converse with the priests. And we arealso told that Eudoxus was a disciple of Chnouphis the Memphite, Soloof Sonchis the Saite, and Pythagoras of Oinuphis the Heliopolite. Butnone of these philosophers seems either to have been more admired andin greater favour with the priests, or to have paid a more especial"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"regard to their method of philosophising, than this last named, who hasparticularly imitated their mysterious and symbolical manner in his ownwritings, and like them conveyed his doctrines to the world in a kindof riddle. For many of the precepts of Pythagoras come nothing shortof the hieroglyphical representations themselves, such as, \"eat not ina chariot,\" \"sit not on a measure (choenix),\" \"plant not a palm-tree,\"and \"stir not the fire with a sword in the house.\" And I myself am ofthe opinion that, when the Pythagoreans appropriated the names ofseveral of the gods to particular numbers, as that of Apollo to theunit, of Artemis to the duad, of Athene to the seven, and of Poseidonto the first cube, in this they allude to something which the founderof their sect saw in the Egyptian temples, or to some ceremoniesperformed in them, or to some symbols there exhibited. Thus, theirgreat king and lord Osiris is represented by the hieroglyphics for aneye and a sceptre,[FN#286] the name itself signifying \"many-eyed,\" aswe are told by some[FN#287] who would derive it from the wordsos,[FN#288] \"many,\" and iri,[FN#289] an \"eye,\" which have this meaningin the Egyptian language. Similarly, because the heavens are eternaland are never consumed or wax old, they represent them by a heart witha censer placed under it. Much in the same way are those statues ofthe Judges at Thebes without hands, and their chief, or president, isrepresented with his eyes turned downwards, which signifies thatjustice ought not to be obtainable by bribes, nor guided by favour oraffection. Of a like nature is the Beetle which we see engraven uponthe seals of the soldiers, for there is no such thing as a femalebeetle of this species; for they are all males, and they propagatetheir kind by casting their seed into round balls of dirt, which affordnot only a proper place wherein the young may be hatched, but alsonourishment for them as soon as they are born.[FN#286] The oldest form of the name is As-Ar, ####; the first sign,####, is a throne, and the second, ####, is an eye, but the exactmeaning represented by the two signs is not known. In late times asceptre, #### took the place of the throne, but only because of itsphonetic value as or us. Thus we have the forms #### and ####.[FN#287] This is a mistake.[FN#288] In Egyptian, #### ash, \"many.\"[FN#289] In Egyptian, #### art, Coptic ####, \"eye.\"XI. When you hear, therefore, the mythological tales which theEgyptians tell of their gods, their wanderings, their mutilations, andmany other disasters which befell them, remember what has just beensaid, and be assured that nothing of what is thus told you is reallytrue, or ever happened in fact. For can it be imagined that it is thedog[FN#290] itself which is reverenced by them under the name ofHermes[FN#291]? It is the qualities of this animal, his constantvigilance, and his acumen in distinguishing his friends from his foes,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"which have rendered him, as Plato says, a meet emblem of that god whois the chief patron of intelligence. Nor can we imagine that theythink that the sun, like a newly born babe, springs up every day out ofa lily. It is quite true that they represent the rising sun in thismanner,[FN#292] but the reason is because they wish to indicate therebythat it is moisture to which we owe the first kindling of thisluminary. In like manner, the cruel and bloody king of Persia, Ochus,who not only put to death great numbers of the people, but even slewthe Apis Bull himself, and afterwards served him up in a banquet to hisfriends, is represented by them by a sword, and by this name he isstill to be found in the catalogue of their kings. This name,therefore, does not represent his person, but indicates his base andcruel qualities, which were best suggested by the picture of aninstrument of destruction. If, therefore, O Clea, you will hear andentertain the story of these gods from those who know how to explain itconsistently with religion and philosophy, if you will steadily persistin the observance of all these holy rites which the laws require ofyou, and are moreover fully persuaded that to form true notions of thedivine nature is more acceptable to them than any sacrifice or mereexternal act of worship can be, you will by this means be entirelyexempt from any danger of falling into superstition, an evil no less tobe avoided than atheism itself.[FN#290] The animal here referred to must be the dog-headed ape, ####,which we see in pictures of the Judgment assisting Thoth to weigh theheart of the dead. This dog-headed ape is a wonderfully intelligentcreature, and its weird cleverness is astonishing.[FN#291] The Egyptian Tehuti, or Thoth.[FN#292] ####.XII. Now, the story of Isis and Osiris, its most insignificant andsuperfluous parts being omitted, runs thus:--The goddess Rhea,[FN#293] they say, having accompanied withKronos[FN#294] by stealth, was discovered by Helios[FN#295] whostraightway cursed her, and declared that she should not be deliveredin any month or year. Hermes, however, 'being also in love with thesame goddess, in return for the favours which he had received from her,went and played at dice with Selene,[FN#296] and won from her theseventieth part of each day. These parts he joined together and madefrom them five complete days, and he added them to the three hundredand sixty days of which the year formerly consisted. These five daysare to this day called the \"Epagomenae,\"[FN#297] that is, thesuperadded, and they are observed by them as the birthdays of theirgods.[FN#298] On the first of these, they say, Osiris was born, and ashe came into the world a voice was heard saying, \"The Lord ofAll[FN#299] is born.\" Some relate the matter in a different way, andsay that a certain person named Pamyles, as he was fetching water fromthe temple of Dios at Thebes, heard a voice commanding him to proclaimaloud that the good and great king Osiris was then born, and that forthis reason Kronos committed the education of the child to him, and"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"that in memory of this event the Pamylia were afterwards instituted,which closely resemble the Phallephoria or Priapeia of the Greeks.Upon the second of these days was born Aroueris,[FN#300] whom some callApollo, and others the Elder Horus. Upon the third day Typhon wasborn, who came into the world neither at the proper time nor by theright way, but he forced a passage through a wound which he made in hismother's side. Upon the fourth day Isis was born, in the marshes ofEgypt,[FN#301] and upon the fifth day Nephthys, whom some call Teleute,or Aphrodite, or Nike, was born. As regards the fathers of thesechildren, the first two are said to have been begotten by Helios, Isisby Hermes, and Typhon and Nephthys by Kronos. Therefore, since thethird of the superadded days was the birthday of Typhon, the kingsconsidered it to be unlucky,[FN#302] and in consequence they neithertransacted any business in it, nor even suffered themselves to take anyrefreshment until the evening. They further add that Typhon marriedNephthys,[FN#303] and that Isis and Osiris, having a mutual affection,enjoyed each other in their mother's womb before they were born, andthat from this commerce sprang Aroueris, whom the Egyptians likewisecall Horus the Elder, and the Greeks Apollo.[FN#293] i.e., Nut, the Sky-goddess.[FN#294] i.e., Keb, the Earth-god.[FN#295] i.e., Ra.[FN#296] i.e., Aah.[FN#297] In Egyptian, \"the five days over the year,\"[FN#298] In Egyptian thus:--I. Birthday of Osiris,II. Birthday of Horus,III. Birthday of Set,IV. Birthday of Isis,V. Birthday of Nephthys[FN#299] One of the chief titles of Osiris was Neb er tcher, i.e.,\"lord to the uttermost limit of everything.\"[FN#300] i.e., Heru-ur, \"Horus the Elder.\"[FN#301] It was Horus, son of Isis, who was born in the marshes ofEgypt.[FN#302] This day is described as unlucky in the hieroglyphic texts.[FN#303] Set and Nephthys are regarded as husband and wife in thetexts; their offspring was Anubis, Anpu.XIII. Osiris having become king of Egypt, applied himself tocivilizing his countrymen by turning them from their former indigentand barbarous course of life. He taught them how to cultivate and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"improve the fruits of the earth, and he gave them a body of lawswhereby to regulate their conduct, and instructed them in the reverenceand worship which they were to pay to the gods. With the same gooddisposition he afterwards travelled over the rest of the world,inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, not indeedcompelling them by force of arms, but persuading them to yield to thestrength of his reasons, which were conveyed to them in the mostagreeable manner, in hymns and songs, accompanied with instruments ofmusic. From this last circumstance the Greeks identified him withtheir Dionysos, or Bacchus. During the absence of Osiris from hiskingdom, Typhon had no opportunity of making any innovations in thestate, Isis being extremely vigilant in the government, and always uponher guard. After his return, however, having first persuaded seventy-two other people to join with him in the conspiracy, together with acertain queen of Ethiopia called Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt atthat time, he formed a crafty plot against him. For having privilytaken the measure of the body of Osiris, he caused a chest to be madeof exactly the same size, and it was very beautiful and highlydecorated. This chest he brought into a certain banqueting room, whereit was greatly admired by all who were present, and Typhon, as if injest, promised to give it to that man whose body when tried would befound to fit it. Thereupon the whole company, one after the other,went into it, but it did not fit any of them; last of all Osirishimself lay down in it. Thereupon all the conspirators ran to thechest, and clapped the cover upon it, and then they fastened it downwith nails on the outside, and poured melted lead over it. They nexttook the chest to the river, which carried it to the sea through theTanaitic mouth of the Nile; and for this reason this mouth of the Nileis still held in the utmost abomination by the Egyptians, and is nevermentioned by them except with marks of detestation. These things, somesay, took place on the seventeenth day of the month of Hathor, when thesun was in Scorpio, in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Osiris,though others tell us that this was the year of his life and not of hisreign.XIV. The first who had knowledge of the accident which had befallentheir king were the Pans and Satyrs, who inhabited the country roundabout Chemmis,[FN#304] and they having informed the people about it,gave the first occasion to the name of Panic Terrors, which has eversince been made use of to signify any sudden fright or amazement of amultitude. As soon as the report reached Isis, she immediately cut offone of the locks of her hair, and put on mourning apparel in that veryplace where she happened to be; for this reason the place has eversince been called \"Koptos,\" or the \"city of mourning,\" though some areof opinion that this word rather signifies \"deprivation.\" After thisshe wandered round about through the country, being full of disquietudeand perplexity, searching for the chest, and she inquired of everyperson she met, including some children whom she saw, whether they knewwhat was become of it. Now, it so happened that these children hadseen what Typhon's accomplices had done with the body, and theyaccordingly told her by what mouth of the Nile it had been conveyed tothe sea. For this reason the Egyptians look upon children as enduedwith a kind of faculty of divining, and in consequence of this notionare very curious in observing the accidental prattle which they havewith one another whilst they are at play, especially if it be in a"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"sacred place, forming omens and presages from it. Isis meanwhilehaving been informed that Osiris, deceived by her sister Nephthys, whowas in love with him, had unwittingly enjoyed her instead of herself,as she concluded from the melilot-garland which he had left with her,made it her business likewise to search out the child, the fruit ofthis unlawful commerce (for her sister, dreading the anger of herhusband Typhon, had exposed it as soon as it was born). Accordingly,after much pains and difficulty, by means of some dogs that conductedher to the place where it was, she found it and bred it up; and inprocess of time it became her constant guard and attendant, andobtained the name of Anubis, and it is thought that it watches andguards the gods as dogs do men.[FN#304] In Egyptian, Khebt, in the VIIIth nome of Lower Egypt.XV. At length Isis received more particular news that the chest hadbeen carried by the waves of the sea to the coast of Byblos, and theregently lodged in the branches of a bush of tamarisk, which in a shorttime had grown up into a large and beautiful tree, and had grown roundthe chest and enclosed it on every side so completely that it was notto be seen. Moreover, the king of the country, amazed at its unusualsize, had cut the tree down, and made that part of the trunk whereinthe chest was concealed into a pillar to support the roof of his house.These things, they say, having been made known to Isis in anextraordinary manner by the report of demons, she immediately went toByblos, where, setting herself down by the side of a fountain, sherefused to speak to anybody except the queen's women who chanced to bethere. These, however, she saluted and caressed in the kindest mannerpossible, plaiting their hair for them, and transmitting into them partof that wonderful odour which issued from her own body. This raised agreat desire in the queen their mistress to see the stranger who hadthis admirable faculty of transfusing so fragrant a smell from herselfinto the hair and skin of other people. She therefore sent for her tocourt, and, after a further acquaintance with her, made her nurse toone of her sons. Now, the name of the king who reigned at this time atByblos was Melkander (Melkarth?), and that of his wife was Astarte, or,according to others, Saôsis, though some call her Nemanoun, whichanswers to the Greek name Athenais.XVI. Isis nursed the child by giving it her finger to suck instead ofthe breast. She likewise put him each night into the fire in order toconsume his mortal part, whilst, having transformed herself into aswallow, she circled round the pillar and bemoaned her sad fate. Thisshe continued to do for some time, till the queen, who stood watchingher, observing the child to be all of a flame, cried out, and therebydeprived him of some of that immortality which would otherwise havebeen conferred upon him. The goddess then made herself known, andasked that the pillar which supported the roof might be given to her.Having taken the pillar down, she cut it open easily, and having takenout what she wanted, she wrapped up the remainder of the trunk in finelinen, and having poured perfumed oil over it, she delivered it again"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"into the hands of the king and queen. Now, this piece of wood is tothis day preserved in the temple, and worshipped by the people ofByblos. When this was done, Isis threw herself upon the chest, andmade at the same time such loud and terrible cries of lamentation overit, that the younger of the king's sons who heard her was frightenedout of his life. But the elder of them she took with her, and set sailwith the chest for Egypt. Now, it being morning the river Phaedrussent forth a keen and chill air, and becoming angry she dried up itscurrent.XVII. At the first place where she stopped, and when she believed thatshe was alone, she opened the chest, and laying her face upon that ofher dead husband, she embraced him and wept bitterly. Then, seeingthat the little boy had silently stolen up behind her, and had foundout the reason of her grief, she turned upon him suddenly, and, in heranger, gave him so fierce and terrible a look that he died of frightimmediately. Others say that his death did not happen in this manner,but, as already hinted, that he fell into the sea. Afterwards hereceived the greatest honour on account of the goddess, for thisManeros, whom the Egyptians so frequently call upon at their banquets,is none other than he. This story is contradicted by those who tell usthat the true name of this child was Palaestinus, or Pelusius, and thatthe city of this name was built by the goddess in memory of him. Andthey further add that this Maneros is thus honoured by the Egyptians attheir feasts because he was the first who invented music. Others againstate that Maneros is not the name of any particular person, but a werecustomary form of complimentary greeting which the Egyptians usetowards each other at their more solemn feasts and banquets, meaning nomore by it than to wish \"that what they were then about might provefortunate and happy to them.\" This is the true import of the word. Inlike manner they say that the human skeleton which is carried about ina box on festal occasions, and shown to the guests, is not designed, assome imagine, to represent the particular misfortunes of Osiris, butrather to remind them of their mortality, and thereby to excite themfreely to make use of and to enjoy the good things which are set beforethem, seeing that they must quickly become such as they there saw.This is the true reason for introducing the skeleton at their banquets.But to proceed with the narrative.XVIII. When Isis had come to her son Horus, who was being reared atButo,[FN#305] she deposited the chest in a remote and unfrequentedplace. One night, however, when Typhon was hunting by the light of themoon, he came upon it by chance, and recognizing the body which wasenclosed in it, he tore it into several pieces, fourteen[FN#306] inall, and scattered them in different places up and down the country.When Isis knew what had been done, she set out in search of thescattered portions of her husband's body; and in order to pass moreeasily through the lower, marshy parts of the country, she made use ofa boat made of the papyrus plant. For this reason, they say, eitherfearing the anger of the goddess, or else venerating the papyrus, thecrocodile never injures anyone who travels in this sort ofvessel.[FN#307] And this, they say, hath given rise to the report thatthere are very many different sepulchres of Osiris in Egypt, for"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"wherever Isis found one of the scattered portions of her husband'sbody, there she buried it. Others, however, contradict this story, andtell us that the variety of sepulchres of Osiris was due rather to thepolicy of the queen, who, instead of the real body, as she pretended,presented to these cities only an image of her husband. This she didin order to increase the honours which would by these means be paid tohis memory, and also to defeat Typhon, who, if he were victorious inhis fight against Horus in which he was about to engage, would searchfor the body of Osiris, and being distracted by the number ofsepulchres would despair of ever being able to find the true one. Weare told, moreover, that notwithstanding all her efforts, Isis wasnever able to discover the phallus of Osiris, which, having been throwninto the Nile immediately upon its separation from the rest of thebody,[FN#308] had been devoured by the Lepidotus, the Phagrus, and theOxyrhynchus, fish which above all others, for this reason, theEgyptians have in more especial avoidance. In order, however, to makesome amends for the loss, Isis consecrated the phallus made inimitation of it, and instituted a solemn festival to its memory, whichis even to this day observed by the Egyptians.[FN#305] In Egyptian, the double city Pe-Tep. See the texts from theMetternich Stele printed in this volume.[FN#306] The fourteen members are: head, feet, bones, arms, heart,interior, tongue, eyes, fists, fingers, back, ears, loins, and body.Some of the lists in Egyptian add the face of a ram and the hair. Thecities in which Isis buried the portions of his body are: Koptos,Philae in Elephantine, Herakleopolis Magna, Kusae, Heliopolis,Diospolis of Lower Egypt, Letopolis, Sais, Hermopolis of Lower Egypt,Athribis, Aq (Schedia), Ab in the Libyan nome, Netert, Apis.[FN#307] Moses was laid in an ark of bulrushes, i.e., papyrus, and wasfound uninjured.[FN#308] We meet with a similar statement in the Tale of the TwoBrothers, where we are told that the younger brother, having declaredhis innocence to the elder brother, out off his phallus and threw itinto the river, where it was devoured by the naru fish.XIX. After these things Osiris returned from the other world, andappeared to his son Horus, and encouraged him to fight, and at the sametime instructed him in the exercise of arms. He then asked him what hethought was the most glorious action a man could perform, to whichHorus replied, \"To revenge the injuries offered to his father[FN#309]and mother.\" Osiris then asked him what animal he thought mostserviceable to a soldier, and Horus replied, \"A horse.\" On this Osiriswondered, and he questioned him further, asking him why he preferred ahorse to a lion, and Horus replied, \"Though the lion is the moreserviceable creature to one who stands in need of help, yet is thehorse more useful in overtaking and cutting off a flyingenemy.\"[FN#310] These replies caused Osiris to rejoice greatly, forthey showed him that his son was sufficiently prepared for his enemy.We are, moreover, told that amongst the great numbers who were"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"continually deserting from Typhon's party was his concubineThoueris,[FN#311] and that a serpent which pursued her as she wascoming over to Horus was slain by his soldiers. The memory of thisaction is, they say, still preserved in that cord which is thrown intothe midst of their assemblies, and then chopped in pieces. Afterwardsa battle took place between Horus and Typhon, which lasted many days,but Horus was at length victorious, and Typhon was taken prisoner. Hewas delivered over into the custody of Isis, who, instead of puttinghim to death, loosed his fetters and set him free. This action of hismother incensed Horus to such a degree that he seized her, and pulledthe royal crown off her head; but Hermes came forward, and set upon herhead the head of an ox instead of a helmet.[FN#312] After this Typhonaccused Horus of illegitimacy, but, by the assistance of Hermes, hislegitimacy was fully established by a decree of the godsthemselves.[FN#313] After this two other battles were fought betweenHorus and Typhon, and in both Typhon was defeated. Moreover, Isis issaid to have had union with Osiris after his death,[FN#314] and shebrought forth Harpokrates,[FN#315] who came into the world before histime, and was lame in his lower limbs.[FN#309] The texts give as a very common title of Horus, \"Horus, theavenger of his father.\"[FN#310] There is no evidence that the Egyptians employed the horse inwar before the XVIIIth Dynasty, a fact which proves that the dialoguehere given is an invention of a much later date than the originallegend of Osiris.[FN#311] In Egyptian, TA-URT, the hippopotamus goddess.[FN#312] According to the legend given in the Fourth Sallier Papyrus,the fight between Horus and Set began on the 26th day of the month ofThoth, and lasted three days and three nights. It was fought in ornear the hall of the lords of Kher-aha, i.e., near Heliopolis, and inthe presence of Isis, who seems to have tried to spare both her brotherSet and her son Horus. For some reason Horus became enraged with hismother, and attacking her like a \"leopard of the south,\" he cut off thehead of Isis. Thereupon Thoth came forward, and using words of power,created a substitute in the form of a cow's head, and placed it on herbody (Sallier, iv., p. 2; see Select Papyri, pl. cxlv.).[FN#313] Horus inherited the throne by his father's will, a fact whichis so often emphasized in the texts that it seems there may be someground for Plutarch's view.[FN#314] This view is confirmed by the words in the hymn to Osiris,\"she moved the inactivity of the Still-Heart (Osiris), she drew fromhim his essence, she made an heir.\"[FN#315] In Egyptian, HERU-PA-KHART, \"Horus the Child.\"XX. Such then are the principal circumstances of this famous story,the more harsh and shocking parts of it, such as the cutting up of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Horus and the beheading of Isis, being omitted. Now, if such could besupposed to be the real sentiments of the Egyptians concerning thosedivine Beings whose most distinguishing characteristics are happinessand immortality, or could it be imagined that they actually believedwhat they thus tell us ever to have actually taken place, I should notneed to warn you, O Clea, you who are already sufficiently averse tosuch impious and absurd notions of the God, I should not, I say, haveneed to caution you, to testify your abhorrence of them, and, asAeschylus expresses it, \"to spit and wash your mouth\" after the recitalof them. In the present case, however, it is not so. And I doubt notthat you yourself are conscious of the difference between this historyand those light and idle fictions which the poets and other writers offables, like spiders, weave and spin out of their own imaginations,without having any substantial ground or firm foundation to work upon.There must have been some real distress, some actual calamity, at thebottom as the ground-work of the narration; for, as mathematiciansassure us, the rainbow is nothing else but a variegated image of thesun, thrown upon the sight by the reflection of his beams from theclouds; and thus ought we to look upon the present story as therepresentation, or rather reflection, of something real as its truecause. And this notion is still farther suggested to us as well bythat solemn air of grief and sadness which appears in their sacrifices,as by the very form and arrangement of their temples, which extend intolong avenues and open aisles in some portions,[FN#316] and in othersretreating into dark and gloomy chapels which resembled the undergroundvaults which are allotted to the dead. That the history has asubstantial foundation is proved by the opinion which obtains generallyconcerning the sepulchres of Osiris. There are many places wherein hisbody is said to have been deposited, and among these are Abydos andMemphis, both of which are said to contain his body. It is for thisreason, they say, that the richer and more prosperous citizens wish tobe buried in the former of these cities, being ambitious of lying, asit were, in the grave with Osiris.[FN#317] The title of Memphis to beregarded as the grave of Osiris seems to rest upon the fact that theApis Bull, who is considered to be the image of the soul of Osiris, iskept in that city for the express purpose that it may be as near hisbody as possible.[FN#318] Others again tell us that the interpretationof the name Memphis[FN#319] is \"the haven of good men,\" and that thetrue sepulchre of Osiris lies in that little island which the Nilemakes at Philae.[FN#320] This island is, they say, inaccessible, andneither bird can alight on it, nor fish swim near it, except at thetimes when the priests go over to it from the mainland to solemnizetheir customary rites to the dead, and to crown his tomb with flowers,which, they say, is overshadowed by the branches of a tamarisk-tree,the size of which exceeds that of an olive-tree.[FN#316] Plutarch refers to the long colonnaded courts which extend ina straight line to the sanctuary, which often contains more than oneshrine, and to the chambers wherein temple properties, vestments, &c.,were kept.[FN#317] In what city the cult of Osiris originated is not known, butit is quite certain that before the end of the VIth Dynasty Abydosbecame the centre of his worship, and that he dispossessed the localgod An-Her in the affections of the people. Tradition affirmed that"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"the head of Osiris was preserved at Abydos in a box, and a picture ofit, #### became the symbol of the city. At Abydos a sort of miracleplay, in which all the sufferings and resurrection of Osiris werecommemorated, was performed annually, and the raising up of a model ofhis body, and the placing of his head upon it, were the culminatingceremonies. At Abydos was the famous shaft into which offerings werecast for transmission to the dead in the Other World, and through theGap in the hills close by souls were believed to set out on theirjourney thither. One tradition places the Elysian Fields in theneighbourhood of Abydos. A fine stone bier, a restoration probably ofthe XXVIth Dynasty, which represented the original bier of Osiris, wasdiscovered there by M. Amelineau. It is now in the Egyptian Museum atCairo.[FN#318] Apis is called the \"life of Osiris,\" ####, and on the deathof the Bull, its soul went to heaven and joined itself to that ofOsiris, and it formed with him the dual-god Asar-Hep, i.e., Osiris-Apis, or Sarapis. The famous Serapeum at Memphis was called ####.[FN#319] In Egyptian, Men-Nefer, i.e., \"fair haven.\"[FN#320] Osiris and Isis were worshipped at Philae until the reign ofJustinian, when his general, Narses, closed the temple and carried offthe statues of the gods to Constantinople, where they were probablymelted down.XXI. Eudoxus indeed asserts that, although there are many pretendedsepulchres of Osiris in Egypt, the, place where his body actually liesis Busiris,[FN#321] where likewise he was born.[FN#322] As toTaphosiris, there is no need to mention it particularly, for its veryname indicates its claim to be the tomb of Osiris. There are likewiseother circumstances in the Egyptian ritual which hint to us the realityupon which this history is grounded, such as their cleaving the trunkof a tree, their wrapping it up in linen which they tear in pieces forthat purpose, and the libations of oil which they afterwards pour uponit; but these I do not insist on, because they are intermixed with suchof their mysteries as may not be revealed.[FN#321] In Egyptian, Pa-Asar-neb-Tetu, \"the house of Osiris, the lordof Tetu.\" In the temple of Neb-Sekert, the backbone of the god waspreserved, according to one text, but another says it was his jaws(?)and interior.[FN#322] This view represents a late tradition, or at all events onewhich sprang up after the decay of Abydos.[FIRST EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]XXII. Now as to those who, from many things of this kind, some of"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"which are proclaimed openly, and others are darkly hinted at in theirreligious institutions, would conclude that the whole story is no otherthan a mere commemoration of the various actions of their kings andother great men, who, by reason of their excellent virtue and themightiness of their power, added to their other titles the honour ofdivinity, though they afterwards fell into many and grievouscalamities, those, I say, who would in this manner account for thevarious scenes above-mentioned, must be owned indeed to make use of avery plausible method of eluding such difficulties as may arise aboutthis subject, and ingeniously enough to transfer the most shockingparts of it from the divine to the human nature. Moreover, it must beadmitted that such a solution is not entirely destitute of anyappearance of historical evidence for its support. For when theEgyptians themselves tell us that Hermes had one hand shorter thananother, that Typhon was of red complexion, Horus fair, and Osirisblack, does not this show that they were of the human species, andsubject to the same accidents as all other men?[FN#323] Nay, they gofarther, and even declare the particular work in which each was engagedwhilst alive. Thus they say that Osiris was a general, that Canopus,from whom the star took its name, was a pilot, and that the ship whichthe Greeks call Argo, being made in imitation of the ship of Osiris,was, in honour of him, turned into a constellation and placed nearOrion and the Dog-star, the former being sacred to Horus and the latterto Isis.[FN#323] Red is the colour attributed to all fiends in the Egyptiantexts. One of the forms of Horus is described as being \"blue-eyed,\"and the colour of the face of Osiris is often green, and sometimesblack.XXIII. But I am much afraid that to give in to this explanation of thestory will be to move things which ought not to be moved; and not only,as Simonides says, \"to declare war against all antiquity,\" but likewiseagainst whole families and nations who are fully possessed with thebelief in the divinity of these beings. And it would be no less thandispossessing those great names of their heaven, and bringing them downto the earth. It would be to shake and loosen a worship and faithwhich have been firmly settled in nearly all mankind from theirinfancy. It would be to open a wide door for atheism to enter in at,and to encourage the attempts of those who would humanize the divinenature. More particularly it would give a clear sanction and authorityto the impostures of Euhemerus the Messenian, who from mereimagination, and without the least appearance of truth to support it,has invented a new mythology of his own, asserting that \"all those ingeneral who are called and declared to be gods are none other than somany ancient generals and sea-captains and kings.\" Now, he says thathe found this statement written in the Panchaean dialect in letters ofgold, though in what part of the globe his Panchaeans dwell, any morethan the Tryphillians, whom he mentions at the same time with them, hedoes not inform us. Nor can I learn that any other person, whetherGreek or Barbarian, except himself, has ever yet been so fortunate asto meet with these imaginary countries."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"[In Sec. XXIV. Plutarch goes on to say that the Assyrians commemorateSemiramis, the Egyptians Sesostris, the Phrygians Manis or Masdis, thePersians Cyrus, and the Macedonians Alexander, yet these heroes are notregarded as gods by their peoples. The kings who have accepted thetitle of gods have afterwards had to suffer the reproach of vanity andpresumption, and impiety and injustice.][SECOND EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]XXV. There is another and a better method which some employ inexplaining this story. They assert that what is related of Typhon,Osiris, and Isis is not to be regarded as the afflictions of gods, orof mere mortals, but rather as the adventures of certain great Daemons.These beings, they say, are supposed by some of the wisest of the Greekphilosophers, that is to say, Plato, Pythagoras, Xenocrates, andChrysippus, in accordance with what they had learned from ancienttheologians, to be stronger and more powerful than men, and of a naturesuperior to them. They are, at the same time, inferior to the pure andunmixed nature of the gods, as partaking of the sensations of the body,as well as of the perceptions of the soul, and consequently liable topain as well as pleasure, and to such other appetites and affections,as flow from their various combinations. Such affections, however,have a greater power and influence over some of them than over others,just as there are different degrees of virtue and vice found in theseDaemons as well as in mankind. In like manner, the wars of the Giantsand the Titans which are so much spoken of by the Greeks, thedetestable actions of Kronos, the combats between Apollo and thePython, the flights of Dionysos, and the wanderings of Demeter, areexactly of the same nature as the adventures of Osiris and Typhon.Therefore, they all are to be accounted for in the same manner, andevery treatise of mythology will readily furnish us with an abundanceof other similar instances. The same thing may also be affirmed ofthose other things which are so carefully concealed under the cover ofmysteries and imitations.[In Sec. XXVI. Plutarch points out that Homer calls great and good men\"god-like\" and \"God's compeers,\" but the word Daemon is applied to thegood and bad indifferently (see Odyssey, vi. 12; Iliad, xiii. 810, v.438, iv. 31, &c.). Plato assigns to the Olympian Gods good things andthe odd numbers, and the opposite to the Daemons. Xenocrates believedin the existence of a series of strong and powerful beings which takepleasure in scourgings and fastings, &c. Hesiod speaks of \"holydaemons\" (Works and Days, 126) and \"guardians of mankind,\" and\"bestowers of wealth,\" and these are regarded by Plato as a \"middleorder of beings between the gods and men, interpreters of the wills ofthe gods to men, and ministering to their wants, carrying the prayersand supplications of mortals to heaven, and bringing down thence inreturn oracles and all other blessings of life.\" Empedocles thought"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"that the Daemons underwent punishment, and that when chastened andpurified they were restored to their original state.][Sec. XXVII. To this class belonged Typhon, who was punished by Isis. Inmemory of all she had done and suffered, she established certain ritesand mysteries which were to be types and images of her deeds, andintended these to incite people to piety, and, to afford themconsolation. Isis and Osiris were translated from good Daemons intogods, and the honours due to them are rightly of a mixed kind, beingthose due to gods and Daemons. Osiris is none other than Pluto, andIsis is not different from Proserpine.][Sec. XXX. Typhon is held by the Egyptians in the greatest contempt, andthey do all they can to vilify him. The colour red being associatedwith him, they treat with contumely all those who have a ruddycomplexion; the ass[FN#324] being usually of a reddish colour, the menof Koptos are in the habit of sacrificing asses by casting them downprecipices. The inhabitants of Busiris and Lycopolis never usetrumpets, because their sounds resemble the braying of an ass. Thecakes which are offered at the festivals during Paoni and Paopi arestamped with the figure of a fettered ass. The Pythagoreans regardedTyphon as a daemon, and according to them he was produced in the evennumber fifty-six; and Eudoxus says that a figure of fifty-six anglestypifies the nature of Typhon.][FN#324] The ass is associated with Set, or Typhon, in the texts, buton account of his virility he also typifies a form of the Sun-god. Ina hymn the deceased prays, \"May I smite the Ass, may I crush theserpent-fiend Sebau,\" but the XLth Chapter of the Book of the Dead isentitled, \"Chapter of driving back the Eater of the Ass.\" The vignetteshows us the deceased in the act of spearing a monster serpent whichhas fastened its jaws in the back of an ass. In Chapter CXXV. there isa dialogue between the Cat and the Ass.[Sec. XXXI. The Egyptians only sacrifice red-coloured bulls, and a singleblack or white hair in the animal's head disqualifies it for sacrifice.They sacrifice creatures wherein the souls of the wicked have beenconfined, and through this view arose the custom of cursing the animalto be sacrificed, and cutting off its bead and throwing it into theNile. No bullock is sacrificed which has not on it the seal of thepriests who were called \"Sealers.\" The impression from this sealrepresents a man upon his knees, with his hands tied behind him, and asword pointed at his throat. The ass is identified with Typhon notonly because of his colour, but also because of his stupidity and thesensuality of his disposition. The Persian king Ochus was nicknamedthe \"Ass,\" which made him to say, \"This ass shall dine upon your ox,\"and accordingly he slew Apis. Typhon is said to have escaped fromHorus by a flight of seven days on an ass.]"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"[THIRD EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]XXXII. Such then are the arguments of those who endeavour to accountfor the above-mentioned history of Isis and Osiris upon a suppositionthat they were of the order of Daemons; but there are others whopretend to explain it upon other principles, and in more philosophicalmanner. To begin, then, with those whose reasoning is the most simpleand obvious. As the Greeks allegorize their Kronos into Time, andtheir Hera into Air, and tell us that the birth of Hephaistos is noother but the change of air into fire, so these philosophers say thatby Osiris the Egyptians mean the Nile, by Isis that part of the countrywhich Osiris, or the Nile, overflows, and by Typhon the sea, which, byreceiving the Nile as it runs into it, does, as it were, tear it intomany pieces, and indeed entirely destroys it, excepting only so much ofit as is admitted into the bosom of the earth in its passage over it,which is thereby rendered fertile. The truth of this explanation isconfirmed, they say, by that sacred dirge which they make over Osiriswhen they bewail \"him who was born on the right side of the world andwho perished on the left.\"[FN#325] For it must be observed that theEgyptians look upon the east as the front or face of the world,[FN#326]upon the north as its right side,[FN#327] and upon the south as itsleft.[FN#328] As, therefore, the Nile rises in the south, and runningdirectly northwards is at last swallowed up by the sea, it may rightlyenough be said to be born on the right and to perish on the left side.This conclusion, they say, is still farther strengthened from thatabhorrence which the priests express towards the sea, as well as salt,which they call \"Typhon's foam.\" And amongst their prohibitions is onewhich forbids salt being laid on their tables. And do they not alsocarefully avoid speaking to pilots, because this class of men have muchto do with the sea and get their living by it? And this is not theleast of their reasons for the great dislike which they have for fish,and they even make the fish a symbol of \"hatred,\" as is proved by thepictures which are to be seen on the porch of the temple of Neith atSais. The first of these is a child, the second is an old man, thethird is a hawk, and then follow a fish and a hippopotamus. Themeaning of all these is evidently, \"O you who are coming into theworld, and you who are going out of it (i.e., both young and old), Godhateth impudence.\" For by the child is indicated \"all those who arecoming into life\"; by the old man, \"those who are going out of it\"; bythe hawk, \"God\"; by the fish, \"hatred,\" on account of the sea, as hasbeen before stated; and by the hippopotamus, \"impudence,\" this creaturebeing said first to slay his sire, and afterwards to force hisdam.[FN#329] The Pythagoreans likewise may be thought perhaps by someto have looked upon the sea as impure, and quite different from all therest of nature, and that thus much is intended by them when they callit the \"tears of Kronos.\"[FN#325] Plutarch here refers to Osiris as the Moon, which rises inthe West."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"[FN#326] According to the texts the front of the world was the south,khent, #### and from this word is formed the verb #### #### \"to sail tothe south.\"[FN#327] In the texts the west is the right side, unemi, #### inCoptic, ####.[FN#328] In the texts the east is the left side, abti.[FN#329] Each of these signs, ####, except the last, does mean whatPlutarch says it means, but his method of reading them together iswrong, and it proves that he did not understand that hieroglyphics wereused alphabetically as well as ideographically.[Secs. XXXIII., XXXIV. Some of the more philosophical priests assert thatOsiris does not symbolize the Nile only, nor Typhon the sea only, butthat Osiris represents the principle and power of moisture in general,and that Typhon represents everything which is scorching, burning, andfiery, and whatever destroys moisture. Osiris they believe to havebeen of a black[FN#330] colour, because water gives a black tinge toeverything with which it is mixed. The Mnevis Bull[FN#331] kept atHeliopolis is, like Osiris, black in colour, \"and even Egypt[FN#332]itself, by reason of the extreme blackness of the soil, is called bythem 'Chemia,' the very name which is given to the black part or pupilof the eye.[FN#333] It is, moreover, represented by them under thefigure of a human heart.\" The Sun and Moon are not represented asbeing drawn about in chariots, but as sailing round the world in ships,which shows that they owe their motion, support, and nourishment to thepower of humidity.[FN#334] Homer and Thales both learned from Egyptthat \"water was the first principle of all things, and the cause ofgeneration.\"[FN#335]][FN#330] Experiments recently conducted by Lord Rayleigh indicate thatthe true colour of water is blue.[FN#331] In Egyptian, Nem-ur, or Men-ur, and he was \"called the lifeof Ra.\"[FN#332] The commonest name of Egypt is Kemt, \"black land,\" as opposedto the reddish-yellow sandy deserts on each side of the \"valley ofblack mud.\" The word for \"black\" is kam.[FN#333] Plutarch seems to have erred here. The early texts call thepupil of the eye \"the child in the eye,\" as did the Semitic peoples(see my Liturgy of Funerary Offerings, p. 136). The Copts spoke of the\"black of the eye,\" derived from the hieroglyphic \"darkness,\"\"blackness.\"[FN#334] There is no support for this view in the texts.[FN#335] It was a very common belief in Egypt that all things arosefrom the great celestial ocean called Nu, whence came the Nile."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"[Sec. XXXVI. The Nile and all kinds of moisture are called the \"efflux ofOsiris.\" Therefore a water-pitcher[FN#336] is always carried first inhis processions, and the leaf of a fir-tree represents both Osiris andEgypt.[FN#337] Osiris is the great principle of fecundity, which isproved by the Pamylia festivals, in which a statue of the god with atriple phallus is carried about.[FN#338] The three-fold phallus merelysignifies any great and indefinite number.][FN#336] Plutarch refers to the vessel of water, with which the priestsprinkles the ground to purify it.[FN#337] He seems to refer here to the olive-tree: Beqet, \"oliveland,\" was one of the names of Egypt.[FN#338] Plutarch seems to be confounding Osiris with Menu, the god ofgeneration, who is generally represented in an ithyphallic form. Thefestival of the phallus survived in Egypt until quite recently.[Sec. XXXVIII. The Sun is consecrated to Osiris, and the lion isworshipped, and temples are ornamented with figures of this animal,because the Nile rises when the sun is in the constellation of theLion. Horus, the offspring of Osiris, the Nile, and Isis, the Earth,was born in the marshes of Buto, because the vapour of damp landdestroys drought. Nephthys, or Teleute, represents the extreme limitsof the country and the sea-shore, that is, barren land. Osiris (i.e.,the Nile) overflowed this barren land, and Anubis[FN#339] was theresult.[FN#340]][FN#339] The Egyptian Anpu. The texts make one form of him to be theson of Set and Nephthys.[FN#340] Plutarch's explanations in this chapter are unsupported bythe texts.[Sec. XXXIX. In the first part of this chapter Plutarch continues hisidentification of Typhon with drought, and his ally Aso, Queen ofEthiopia, he considers to be the Etesian or north winds, which blow fora long period when the Nile is falling. He goes on to say:--]As to what they relate of the shutting up of Osiris in a box, thisappears to mean the withdrawal of the Nile to its own bed. This is themore probable as this misfortune is said to have happened to Osiris inthe month of Hathor, precisely at that season of the year when, uponthe cessation of the Etesian or north winds the Nile returns to its ownbed, and leaves the country everywhere bare and naked. At this timealso the length of the nights increases, darkness prevails, whilstlight is diminished and overcome. At this time the priests celebrate"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"doleful rites, and they exhibit as a suitable representation of thegrief of Isis a gilded ox covered with a fine black linen cloth. Now,the ox is regarded as the living image of Osiris. This ceremony isperformed on the seventeenth and three following days,[FN#341] and theymourn: 1. The falling of the Nile; 2. The cessation of the northwinds; 3. The decrease in the length of the days; 4. The desolatecondition of the land. On the nineteenth of the month Pachons theymarch in procession to the sea, whither the priests and other officialscarry the sacred chest, wherein is enclosed a small boat of gold; intothis they first pour some water, and then all present cry out with aloud voice, \"Osiris is found.\" This done, they throw some earth,scent, and spices into the water, and mix it well together, and work itup into the image of a crescent, which they afterwards dress inclothes. This shows that they regard the gods as the essence and powerof water and earth.[FN#341] The 17th day is very unlucky; the 18th is very lucky; the19th and 20th are very unlucky. On the 17th day Isis and Nephthys madegreat lamentation for their brother Un-nefer at Sais; on the 19th noman should leave the house; and the man born on the 20th would die ofthe plague.[Sec. XL. Though Typhon was conquered by Horus, Isis would not allow himto be destroyed. Typhon was once master of all Egypt, i.e., Egypt wasonce covered by the sea, which is proved by the sea-shells which aredug out of the mines, and are found on the tops of the hills. The Nileyear by year creates new land, and thus drives away the sea further andfurther, i.e., Osiris triumphs over Typhon.][FOURTH EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.][Sec. XLI. Osiris is the Moon, and Typhon is the Sun; Typhon is thereforecalled Seth,[FN#342] a word meaning \"violence,\" \"force,\" &c. Heraklesaccompanies the Sun, and Hermes the Moon. In Sec. XLII. Plutarch connectsthe death-day of Osiris, the seventeenth of Hathor, with theseventeenth day of the Moon's revolution, when she begins to wane. Theage of Osiris, twenty-eight years, suggests the comparison with thetwenty-eight days of the Moon's revolution. The tree-trunk which ismade into the shape of a crescent at the funeral of Osiris refers tothe crescent moon when she wanes. The fourteen pieces into whichOsiris was broken refer to the fourteen days in which the moon wanes.][FN#342] In Egyptian, ####, or #### which Plutarch seems to connectwith set, ####."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"[Sec.

XLIV. The philosophers say that the story is nothing but anenigmatical description of the phenomena of Eclipses. In Sec. XLV.Plutarch discusses the five explanations which he has described, andbegins to state his own views about them. It must be concluded, hesays, that none of these explanations taken by itself contains the trueexplanation of the foregoing history, though all of them together do.Typhon means every phase of Nature which is hurtful and destructive,not only drought, darkness, the sea, &c. It is impossible that any onecause, be it bad or even good, should be the common principle of allthings. There must be two opposite and quite different and distinctPrinciples. In Sec. XLVI., Plutarch compares this view with the Magianbelief in Ormazd and Ahriman, the former springing from light (Sec.XLVII.), and the latter from darkness. Ormazd made six good gods, andAhriman six of a quite contrary nature. Ormazd increased his own bulkthree times, and adorned the heaven with stars, making the Sun to bethe guard of the other stars. He then created twenty-four other gods,and placed them in an egg, and Ahriman also created twenty-four gods;the latter bored a hole in the shell of the egg and effected anentrance into it, and thus good and evil became mixed together. In Sec.XLVIII. Plutarch quotes Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Aristotle, and Plato insupport of his hypothesis of the Two Principles, and refers to Plato'sThird Principle. Sec. XLIX. Osiris represents the good qualities of theuniversal Soul, and Typhon the bad; Bebo[FN#344] is a malignant beinglike Typhon, with whom Manetho identifies him. Sec. L. The ass,crocodile, and hippopotamus are all associated with Typhon; in the formof a crocodile Typhon escaped from Horus.[FN#345][FN#344] In Egyptian, Bebi, or Baba, or Babai, he was the first-bornSon of Osiris.[FN#345] See the Legend of Heru-Behutet, {pr. 67}.The cakes offered on the seventh day of the month Tybi have a"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"hippopotamus stamped on them. Sec. LI. Osiris symbolizes wisdom andpower, and Typhon all that is malignant and bad.]The remaining sections contain a long series of fanciful statements byPlutarch concerning the religion and manners and customs of theEgyptians, of which the Egyptian texts now available give no proofs."}]
