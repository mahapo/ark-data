Chapter 3 is a wholly new addition, using material originally gathered for the earlierwork. Other modifications in the body of the text are relatively minor; the passage of five years has entailedno changes in the original analyses or opinions but has necessitated an expansion of the footnotes toincorporate subsequent bibliography. The manuscript was closed as of May 1992, and only sources availableto me by that date have been included. The reader may be struck by an apparent inconsistency in the use ofhieroglyphic fonts throughout this volume. The use of \"Normalschrift\" fonts has been confined only to genericreferences to individual words and signs. In contrast, whenever a specific textual passage or edition isexcerpted (whether in hieroglyphic, hieratic, or Demotic script), an attempt has been made to reproduce theoriginal text or edition by computer scanner. It is hoped that any loss in aesthetics will be counterbalanced byan increase in accuracy.In the preparation of this study, I have benefited from the sagacity, experience, and endurance of many,and it is a pleasure to acknowledge their contributions. The original dissertation committee comprised Drs.Klaus Baer, Robert D. Biggs, Janet H. Johnson, and Edward F. Wente, chairman and early source ofinspiration. As teachers and colleagues, they have contributed to the fruition of this project in countless ways.In particular, Janet Johnson has continued to provide unflagging support, and our association on the ChicagoDemotic Dictionary Project has been of primary importance for my scholastic development. Her invaluablecomputer skills have also enabled the use of textual scans in this volume. The untimely death of Klaus Baerhas deprived Egyptology of a singularly rigorous scholar and irreplaceable teacher. His insistence onprecision in methodology and detail has shaped the themes of my own work, from our first lessons in theEgyptian language. His enthusiasm for the present study remains a source of pride. Dr. George R. Hughes,who came out of retirement to guide my initial study of Demotic, has been a constant source ofencouragement-especially helpful on days when the thought of researching yet another footnote wasunendurable. Additional thanks are due to colleagues and students who offered support, advice, orinformation: William Brashear, Hans D. Betz, Susan Clark, Walter Farber, Richard Jasnow, Charles Jones,Joe Manning, John Nolan, Martha Roth, Terry Wilfong, and the late David Wilmot. Proffered suggestions andreferences are acknowledged individually within the relevant footnotes; responsibility for all otherphraseology, opinions, and citations remains exclusively that of the author.Family and friends have been unstinting in their support. Chief among them are my parents, Robert andMargaret Ritner, and my brother and sister-in-law, Richard and Jody Ritner, and their family.

Most often, thedetermination of \"magic\" has relied solely upon the subjective interpretation of the attitudeof the ancient practitioner as surmised from the contents of recited spells. In keeping withthe early anthropological theories of Frazer and Malinowski, \"magic\" was to bedistinguished from \"religion\" by the former's threatening attitude and its limited, personalgoals. Unfortunately, these criteria are inadequate for delineating Egyptian practice, asthey frequently characterize standard cultic (\"religious\") texts as well. As a result, thesame texts have been labeled \"magical\" by certain scholars though \"religious\" by others. Acommon solution has been the adoption of the noncommittal phrase \"magico-religious,\"and certain scholars, following Claude L6vi-Strauss, have suggested that the category beabandoned altogether.Justification for the retention of the category \"magic\" is suggested by the existence ofnative terminology (ik:) which was ultimately equated with Western \"magic\" in the Coptic(Christian) period. However, an examination of the older Egyptian concept and itsassociated vocabulary, mythology, and theology reveals fundamental distinctions betweenthe range and meaning of \"magic\" within the two cultures. Rather than imposing auniversal definition of \"magic\" on both, the present thesis adopts an \"emic\" approach inwhich Egyptian and Western concepts are evaluated independently, and in their own terms.In order to obtain a \"working definition\" of the Western definition of \"magic,\" a newmethod was selected in which activity serves as the diagnostic criterion. For the purposes ofthis study, any activity that seeks to obtain its goal outside the natural laws of cause andeffect is designated as \"magical\" in the modern Western sense. Using such a \"workingdefinition,\" the identification of \"magical\" elements within spells, rituals, literature, andarchaeological artifacts is relatively simple, and a brief selection of these are surveyedregarding both synchronic distribution and diachronic development: circumambulation,spitting, blowing, licking, swallowing, the use of images, superposition, trampling, binding,I"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICEthe use of red, breaking, the use of sand, burning, numerological symbolism, piercing,decapitation, reversal, burial, the use of the dead, and oracular consultations. Cross-culturalparallels are noted for contrast and comparison. The identity of the magician, his socialrole, and his significance in the continuity of this tradition are also examined. The \"private\"magician is revealed to be none other than the cultic priest, in \"private practice\" duringinterims in temple service. Thus can be explained the identity of \"magical\" acts in privateand public ceremonies, as well as the similarity of ritual texts and \"magical\" spells; allwere composed, compiled, and performed by the same individuals.To date, no treatment of Egyptian magic has concentrated upon the actual practice ofthe magician. Both general studies and textual publications have emphasized instead thereligious elements in the contents of recited spells, while the accompanying instructionswith their vignettes and lists of materials, instruments, and ritual actions remaineduninvestigated. This study represents the first critical examination of such \"magicaltechniques,\" revealing their widespread appearance and pivotal significance for allEgyptian \"religious\" practices from the earliest periods through the Coptic era, influencingas well the Greco-Egyptian magical papyri. Performed by priests as the technique ofreligion, Egyptian \"magic\" cannot be opposed to religion, and the Western dichotomy of\"religion vs. magic\" is thus inappropriate for describing Egyptian practice. This continuumof \"magical mechanics\" vitiates as well the oft-repeated suggestion of religious declineand magical increase in the later periods.Corresponding to the merger of Egyptian religion and magic as obtained from theWestern definition, Egyptian concepts of magic are shown to be pivotal for indigenousreligious life, underlying not merely cultic practice but all sacral speculation, forming an\"imagistic theory\" that bonds the tenets of religion to the techniques of religion. Only withthe conversion of Egypt to Christianity is this theology abandoned, and \"magic\" reinter-preted in the debased meaning which it maintains in the modern West."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1TOWARD A DEFINITION OF MAGICDenn die Zauberei und alles was damit zusammenhaingt, ist uraltes Erbgut des AgyptertumsWilhelm Spiegelberg 1932b, p. 101Ten measures of magic have come into the world.Egypt received nine of these, the rest of the world one measure.Talmud, b. Qid. 49b"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICEIn any discussion of magical spells and techniques, one is at once confronted by thecomplete absence of any shared criteria for exactly what constitutes \"magic.\" All too often,the religious and medical practices of one culture or era become \"magic\" when viewedfrom the perspective of another. Perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in the case of thedeveloping Christian church, which was prosecuted for magical acts by pagan Rome, inturn persecuted pagans and \"heretics\" for the same offense when it attained power, and,finally, was again the subject of denunciations for magical practices by schismaticProtestant groups.' Similarly, many of the medical prescriptions of the Roman author Plinywould certainly be considered \"magical\" today, despite the author's denunciation ofmagicians and their practice.2 This vagary inherent in the modern word \"magic\"-beingapplied by personal whim to beliefs stigmatized as evil or false-parallels the derogatoryevolution of the word \"myth\" and, like it, seems to be a legacy of the Greco-Roman world.3So ingrained has this viewpoint become in Western thought that two very seriousconsequences have arisen for all modern Egyptological studies of the concept. First, thenegative connotations of \"magic\"-whether as fraudulent sham or misguided \"science\"have prevented truly sympathetic treatments of the phenomena in Egypt. Thus previousscholars, when constrained to discuss the topic, expressly state their distaste for thematerial.4 Bounded by religion on the one hand, and on the other by medicine, magic hasbeen considered inferior to both and has often received only perfunctory treatment in thei. For an overview of the reciprocal accusations of magic by pagan and Christian, see Poupon 1981;Brown 1970; Barb 1963; and MacMullen 1966, pp. 95-127. Protestant accusations of magic againstCatholicism are discussed in Thomnas 1971, pp. 51-77 and passim.2. Compare Pliny. Natural History, 30.25 for the use of a dead serpent as an amulet, 30.49 foraphrodisiacs, and note 30.30, where Pliny turns to magical remedies in the case of quartan fevers forwhich \"ordinary medicine\" was felt to he useless. These prescriptions all appear in a chapter whichbegins with an expos6 of magic as \"the most fraudulent of arts\" (30.1). The question of Pliny'srelationship to Roman magic is discussed in Tavenner 1916, pp. 56-59 and 74-75.3. The pejorative use of the term \"magic\" to describe the beliefs and practices of one's enemies (incontrast to the term \"religion\" reserved for one's own beliefs and practices) is skillfully traced in Segal1981. The complexity of this development, and the consequent confusion of categories of \"religion\"and \"magic\" within the Greco-Roman world itself, is clearly surveyed in Morton Smith 1983.4. E.g., H. Brugsch 1891, p. 77: [Magical texts] \"haben kaum einen andern wissenschaftlichen Werth alsden, welchen sie den Studien der Schrift und Sprache darbieten\"; Budge 1901, p. xi: \"beliefs andsuperstitions of the most degraded character\": Erman 1907, p. 148: \"it is precisely the youthfulunsophisticated nations that are most readily attracted by it\"; and Lexa 1925. vol. 1, p. 12: \"Plus laculture nationale est basse et plus le nombre d'hommes clair6s est restreint, plus est grandel'influence de la magie.\" These last statements are demonstrably false. In western Europe, the socialrepercussions of belief in magic and witchcraft were far greater in the Renaissance than in the MiddleAges, and the beliefs were stronger among the educated than among the general population (Douglas1970, pp. xxxi-xxxiii)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"TOWARD A DEFINITION OF MAGICstudy of either.5 Second, the very uncertainty of the exact lines of demarcation (if anyexist) of the boundaries between religion, magic, and medicine has rendered thetheoretical distinctions between them untenable in practice. The designation of any giventext as \"magical\" as opposed to \"religious\" or \"medical\" is often highly problematic andsubjective. The very presence of a spell within a medical context has sufficed to stigmatizethat recipe as \"magical\" even when the accompanying format for treatment is indistin-guishable from others within the same papyrus.6 With regard to religion, emphasis hasbeen placed upon the phraseology of the recitation and the attitude of the speaker. Seenalways from a Western perspective, \"religion\" was to be distinguished from magic by thepious attitude of the practitioner, the humble supplication of its prayers, and the noble, all-inclusive world view of its rituals and theology. In contrast, magic demanded hubris andblasphemy of its devotees, its spells did not beg but threaten, and its goals were immediate,limited, and personal.7 The limitations of this approach become readily apparent when oneattempts to apply it to actual texts. Most notably, the funerary literature-Pyramid Texts,Coffin Texts, Book of the Dead, and various texts in the royal tombs of the New5. For the supposed inferiority of magic to religion, see n. 3, above. With regard to medicine, themagisterial nine volume Grundriss der Medizin der alten Agypter, edited by Grapow, van Deines, andWestendorf (1954-73) devotes only sixteen pages (Grapow 1955, pp. 11-26) to magic, and then onlyto a discussion of recited spells. Techniques of medical magic are not analyzed. Similarly, magicalpractitioners are dismissed as \"non-medical\" in Ghalioungui 1983, p. 68 and compare p. 48: \"I alsoexclude any magicians who were not at the same time swnw.\" This reflects modern-not ancient-categorization. An early reaction against this common disinterest was voiced by W. M. Muller in hisreview of Erman's Zauberspriiche fiir Mutter und Kind: \"So viel Interessantes bieten nun freilich nichtalle magischen Texte, aber man sieht es: es durfte sich verlohnen, tiber das herrschende Vorurteilgegen Magisches etwas after wegzusehen\" (1902, col. 349).6. Papyrus Edwin Smith, case 9, col. 4/19-5/5, in Breasted 1930, pp. 217-24. Despite Breasted's ratherharsh judgment (p. 217) of this prescription as a \"grotesque product of superstition\" and a\"characteristic product of the recipe-hawking physician (as contrasted with the surgeon),\" it is not soaberrant in its composition, which comprises an examination and treatment including a compress andbandaging. The presence of magical elements in this prescription need not reflect, as Breasted thought,an interpolation by a later scribe, but more likely results from the nature of the injury to be treated, afractured skull incurable by contemporary medicine. Compare the reaction of Pliny to magicaltreatment of quartan fever in n. 2, above. The absence of additional magical elements in Pap. EdwinSmith seems equally a result of the type of injuries discussed. Most are simple fractures of obviousphysical origin and correspondingly straightforward treatment. Had the text dealt with disease,recommendations for magical practice might well have been more numerous (Wilson 1952). Magicaltreatments are increasingly recognized as complementary, rather than opposed, to \"rational\" Egyptianmedical practice (Walker 1990).7. See Moret 1906; H. I. Bell 1953, p. 12; Morenz 1973, p. 98; and Barb 1963, pp. 100-01. The mostcomplete formulation of this theory is found in Goode 1949, pp. 172-82 and 1951, pp. 50-55.

Clearly designed for a singleindividual (the tomb owner), these \"personal\" texts yet provide the greatest insights intothe broader religious concerns of the country, including the relation of gods to men, theconception of the afterlife, the judgment of sins, et cetera. Moreover, there is littlehesitancy on the part of the speaker of these spells to mingle praise and threats, respectful\"prayer\" and demands.8 Opinions as to the nature of this literature has, accordingly,varied.9These limitations become far more acute, however, when one finds that the same textmay appear in both \"magical\" and \"religious\" contexts. Thus the Harris \"Magical\" Papyruswhose title describes it as containing spells to enchant crocodiles includes well-knownhymns to the god Shu found equally in \"mainstream\" religious usage upon temple walls atPhilae and Hibis.1o Divorced from their context, these texts are indistinguishable.

In refutation of the assumption that prayer is antithetical to magic, see the comments on the image ofthe god of magic (Hteka) praying the universe into being in te Velde 1970, p. 183.9. Compare Erman 1907, p. 10)0: \"All these anxieties and all this magic scarcely appear in the Pyramidtexts, with the exception of a series of spells against snakes,\" with Borghouts 1974, p. 7: \"It is a currentopinion that the whole body of Pyramid Texts and its successors ... may be called magical in itsapproach to the world of things unseen,\" following Morenz 1973, p. 99: \"... mortuary texts, althoughthey contain religious material, are not themselves religious but magical in nature and purpose,\" andibid., p. 229: \"To put it in a nutshell, mortuary texts are magical texts.\"10.

The originally perceived magical elements were stillclear to Borghouts in 1972 when he felt compelled to include the papyrus in his study ofmagical texts, even while accepting its reclassification as \"ritual.\"16If present methods have been unsuccessful in uniformly isolating magical materials, thefault may lie not only in undue emphasis placed upon the spoken spell, but also in theoperative definitions of \"magic\" utilized by different scholars. Such variance in theunderlying definition of magic has obviously influenced the differing interpretations ofPapyrus Salt 825 as mentioned above. Most often, no formal definition of magicaccompanies studies of the subject as the investigator has assumed-wrongly-that hispersonal understanding of the term is both appropriate for an Egyptian context andimplicitly shared by his colleagues.'7 To the evidence already adduced in refutation of thelatter assumption of shared criteria may be added the common disagreement, encounteredalso in Classical and anthropological studies, whether oracles and divination are to beincluded among magical practices.'8 Certain scholars, most notably Budge among14.

A similar lack of unanimity is found in anthropological treatments; see the comments inEvans-Pritchard 1937, p. 8.

A cursory survey of entries offered by just one such source will suffice toreveal the imprecision of modern parlance for ancient practice.Magic may be loosely defined as an endeavour through utterance of set words, or theperformance of set acts, to control or bend the powers of the world to man's will.20Such a definition places undue stress upon the role of man in the practice of magic, foras is seen below, it is primarily the gods who were felt to excel in the art. Indeed, mostprivate magical texts require the assimilation of the practitioner to a deity in order to besuccessful. This sanctioning of the use of magic by the gods has profound implications forattempts to distinguish magic from religion.Magic is \"the use of means (as ceremonies, charms, spells) that are believed to havesupernatural power to cause a supernatural being to produce or prevent a particular result(as rain, death, healing) considered not attainable by natural means.\"21Within this definition a clear dichotomy is postulated between the supernatural methodsof magic and a normative natural system of cause and effect. For the Egyptian, however,the activity which he designated \"magic\" was felt to be not supernatural butquintessentially a part of nature, being coeval with the creation of the natural order andused daily by the gods to maintain-not violate-that order.2 2Magic is 'the art of producing unusual illusions of legerdemain.'2 3No suggestion of trickery is ever implied in Egyptian terms for magic. Even wheretheatrical feats are described in literature, there is no indication that writer or audience19. Budge 1901, pp. 206-34; so also in Wiedemann 1905, pp. 9-11.20. Webster's, p. 1358.21. Ibid., p. 1358.22. The question of the natural status of magic is a complicated one, and is discussed below with regard tothe term hk?. It must be admitted, however, that this power has been described as \"prenatural orsupernatural\" even in the study which most clearly shows its fundamental importance in themaintenance of the natural created order. See te Velde 1970, especially contrast p. 176 \"prenatural\"and pp. 179-80 \"vital potential or creative energy\" (for the creation of the cosmos, the birth ofchildren, the preservation of the sun, etc.).23.

Social anthropology in particular has been highlyinfluential in its formulations of magical theory, and as certain of its tenets have recentlyfound acceptance in Egyptological literature,26 it is of some importance to examine itsconclusions within an Egyptian context. Although it is beyond the scope of the present workto trace anthropological trends in any but a most cursory manner, even this brief overviewwill suffice to show the original parallelisms and present divergences of the twodisciplines.Among the earliest and most persistently influential of anthropological theories ofmagic is that propounded by Sir James G. Frazer in his epochal The Golden Bough,which--despite its age-yet underlies all discussions of the subject in Egyptology. Like hisEgyptological contemporaries, Frazer postulated an explicit dichotomy between religionand magic based on the pious or threatening attitude of the practitioner.27 His moredistinctive contribution, however, is his definition of magic as sympathetic in nature, beingdivided into two categories: Ilomeopathic and Contagious. The former variety makes use ofthe belief that \"like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause,\" whereas thesecond operates on the principle that \"things which have once been in contact with eachother continue to act on each other at a distance after physical contact has been severed.\"28These principles could be readily combined in practice so that, for example, themanipulation of a voodoo doll would embody Homeopathic magic, while the inclusion of24. Compare the miraculous events narrated in Pap. Westcar, Setna I, and Setna II, in Lichtheim 1973, pp.215-22 (Pap. Westcar) and 1980, pp. 125-51 (Setna I and Setna II). Further tales of magicians appearin Spiegelberg 1912 (Jug A for magician HI-, r and Jug B for magician Si-Wstr); idem 1917b(magician Hi-Hr); idem 1932 (magician N;-nfr-k?-Skr); and Posener 1985 (magician Mry-R').25.

Nor were these categorieslimited to any particular magical act, culture, or era; all magical practice fell under one orboth of these principles. So pervasive has this theory become outside of the social sciencesthat few authors since the publication of The Golden Bough have been able to resist theterm \"sympathetic magic.\"29 Egyptology has yet to question its \"Frazerian\" attitude to thesubject, and finds its perfect analog in the writings of B. Malinowski. Expanding upon thework of Frazer, Malinowski's Magic, Science and Religion upholds the religion/magicdistinction, stresses the spoken spell, and insists that the primary focus of magic is man, notnature.30 The fundamental difficulties arising from the application of these criteria toEgyptian magic are detailed above. In the social sciences, the recognition of similardeficiencies has long since led to a re-evaluation of Frazer's theory, which has ultimatelybeen challenged as much on the question of its usefulness as on its validity. By virtue of itsreductionistic nature, it is incapable of distinguishing the differences in magical practices ofone culture or era from another; for both Frazer and Malinowski the activities of magiciansamong the tribesmen of modern Australia are to be analyzed no differently from thoseamong the sophisticated classes of antique Rome.3 1 Moreover, Frazer's theory fails toaccount for the remarkable persistence of the \"pathetic or ludicrous\" activities which hefinds so devoid of truth or value.32As a reaction to these deficiencies, newer theories have arisen stressing the functionalrole of magic, its inseparability from religion, and its value in individual societies. Chiefamong these theories is that of E. E. Evans-Pritchard. In attempting to avoid theindifference of general theories to cultural distinctions, Evans-Pritchard devised a newvocabulary for magical acts based exclusively upon and designed to represent a specificculture: the Zande of the Sudan.3 3 Concentrating primarily upon the harmful aspects ofmagic, he distinguished two sub-categories: witchcraft and sorcery. The latter designatesthe conscious performance of illicit or immoral magic by external methods such as spells orrites, while the former refers to a \"supposed psychic emanation\" from an internal bodily29. See inter alia Gardiner 1922, p. 265b and Wilson 1952. p. 76. The term is far from obsolete inanthropological discussions as well. Thus Tambiah (1968, p. 194) feels compelled to dispute Frazer'sinterpretation, and it is still used with approval in Becker 1980, p. 20.30. Malinowski 1948, pp. 19ff. and 50-71, especially p. 54: \"To the natives knowledge of magic meansknowledge of spell\"; 56: \"It is not directed so much to nature as to man's relation to nature\"; and 68:\"It is always the affirmation of man's power to cause certain definite effects by a definite spell andrite.\"31.

Magic was to beviewed not as the \"great delusion\" of Frazer, but as an important force in sustaining a staticsociety by providing an expedient explanation for misfortune.36Despite a change in emphasis from a homeostatic to a confrontational model,37 theanalysis of Evans-Pritchard has so far replaced that of Frazer in social anthropology thatcollections of essays devoted to \"witchcraft and sorcery\" presume the knowledge of histheories and terms, and a special memorial volume was dedicated to the thirtiethanniversary of his initial study of the Azande.38 In Egyptological literature, his terminologywas introduced for the first time in 1980.39 It is particularly ironic that the culturally-specific terms selected by Evans-Pritchard should have become standardized for generalapplication to dissimilar cultures, since he was among the first to advance a so-called\"emic\" approach \"whereby definitions, distinctions, and values are derived from the actorsthemselves rather than imposed on them by the observer.\"40 The dubious wisdom ofgeneralizing Zande concepts was clearly evident to M. Douglas in her introduction to the34. Evans-Pritchard 1937, p. 9 (mangu).35. For a discussion of the critical importance of Evans-Pritchard's study on successive theorists, seeDouglas 1970, pp. xiii-xxxviii.36. Evans-Pritchard 1937, pp. 109-17. For an appraisal, see Douglas 1970, pp. xvi-xviii.37. In reaction to the model of witchcraft accusations as an institution for the maintenance of social har-mony, recent theories have noted the increase of such accusations during periods of crisis and stressedtheir role as a challenge to authority when social relations are ill-defined. This interpretation has theadvantage of accommodating both African and European data (Douglas 1970, pp. xviii-xxxvi).38. Compare Marwick 1970, p. 19. For the memorial volume on the anniversary of the publication ofEvans-Pritchard's study of the Azande, see Douglas 1970.39. Borghouts 1980, col. 1144.

Explanations, therefore, will befound embodied in my descriptive account and are not set forth independently of it.\" The term \"emic\"is discussed in Harris 1968, especially p. 571: \"Emic statements refer to logico-empirical systemswhose phenomenal distinctions or 'things' are built up out of contrasts and discriminations significant,meaningful, real, accurate, or in some other fashion regarded as appropriate by the actors themselves.\"11"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICEmemorial volume for Evans-Pritchard, for she expressly declines to follow her colleaguesin their use of terminology.4 1The failure of more recent scholars to adhere to this \"emic\" approach is all the moresurprising in the case of ancient Egypt, for the superimposed term \"witchcraft\" that was socrucial in Zande belief is without any Egyptian referent, save only the \"Evil Eye.\" Egyptianmagic was definitely believed to reside in the body of the magician, but its use required theconscious manipulation of spell and rite.42 Egyptian magic thus cuts across the distinctioninherent in its Zande counterpart. Moreover, neither the methodology of Evans-Pritchardnor that of his successors can be perfectly consonant with that of the Egyptologist. For theanthropologist, the malevolent sorcerer or witch is a fictitious creature, and all accusationsof witchcraft are presumed false.43 The Egyptologist, on the other hand, is confronted byunmistakable archaeological and textual evidence of hostile magic, and must presume thataccusations of magical practice could well be true. Although the efficacy of the practicemay be subject to belief, its existence is not.Just as a simplistic adoption of anthropological terminology provides no deeper insightsinto the nature of Egyptian magic, so the present vogue for sociological terminologyregarding magic in the fields of comparative religion and biblical study is equally ill athome within Egyptology. Seizing upon the early theories of Emile Durkheim and MarcelMauss which stigmatize magic as anti-social and illegal behavior, Jonathan Z. Smith hasrecently argued that illegality is the \"one universal characteristic\" of magic.44 In response,David Aune has preferred to place magic within the framework of recent studies of socialdeviance, and considers magic to be \"universally regarded as a form of deviant behavior,\"where the latter term is defined as \"conduct that departs significantly from the norms setfor people in their social statuses.\"45 Neither of these generalizations is satisfactory, for41. Douglas 1970, p. xxxvi, n. 1.42. Compare CT spells 30, 33-37, and passim. For discussion, see Borghouts 1980, col. 1140.43. See Douglas 1970, p. xxxiv: \"Anthropologists have usually approached witchcraft from the point ofview of the accuser, always assuming that the accusation is false. This has made it hard for us tointerpret witchcraft confessions.\" This stance, noticeable also in the works of cultural historians,derives from a basic confusion between belief in sorcerers/witches and belief in the efficacy ofsorcery/witchcraft. Admittedly, misfortunes have often been attributed to unknown and very likelyfictitious witches, but this does not mean that individuals who practice witchcraft (and are thereforewitches) do not exist. For a similar distinction between the witches of European folk belief and actualcontemporary practitioners of sorcery, see Cohen 1970, pp. 11-12.44. J. Z. Smith 1978, p. 192, following Brown 1970 and Morton Smith 1973, pp. 220-37. All of these the-ories ultimately derive from Roman law as extrapolated by Mauss 1972 and Durkheim 1965. pp. 57ff.45.

However magic may be defined, in Egypt the practice was in itself quitelegal. Only one trial for sorcery is preserved from ancient Egypt, involving the use of waxfigures in a plot against the throne, but the trial record is careful to state that the books ofmagic used by the prisoners came from the king's own collection.46 Sorcery against theking, not sorcery per se, was illegal. In other instances, kings, priests, and commoners usedthe same methods on a daily, normative, and legal basis. Thus King Amenophis II states onthe Amada Stela (1. 5) that \"he made execration figures of his enemies and the Nine Bows(the traditional enemies of Egypt) likewise.\"4 7 Similar figures made by priests forfoundation deposits are well known.48 Private individuals are specifically urged to use thesame methods in the so-called \"Apophis Book\" (Papyrus BM 10188), making figures of theenemies of Re, Pharaoh, and \"all foes male and female whom your heart fears.\"49 Thethematically similar \"Rite for Repelling the Angry One\" (Papyrus Louvre E 3129) is evenmore precise: \"If this spell is recited against any enemy of NN, evil will happen to him for7 days.\"50 In both texts the reciter is said to participate in the destruction of divine, royal,and personal enemies with no distinction as to method or legality. It should be stressed thatboth texts were also performed in the daily liturgies of the chief temples of Amon-Re andOsiris, and are thus an integral part of the religious norm, and by no means constitute\"deviant\" behavior. So inextricably mixed do magic and religion seem in these instancesthat any formal distinction between them might well seem artificial and improper. Indeed,E. E. Evans-Pritchard has suggested that anthropology abandon the terms \"religion\" and\"magic,\" while the sociologist David Pocock, following Claude L6vi-Strauss, would disposeof the category of \"magic\" altogether.5' Is there any rationale for maintaining the concept\"magic\" in Egyptology, and can it be distinguished from religion?

Thus, the sorcery of Simon Magus mentioned above in Acts 8:9 (P 21K) is termedTMNTM OC, \"the quality of MroC, magic\" in Acts 8:11.53 Similarly, in the Oration inPraise of Saint GeorgiOs Diosppwlis by Theodotos of Ancyra, the saint, when accused ofbeing a magician (FTnl MZFOC), is berated for TCK METPC91P21K, \"your magic practices.\"54Succinct explanation is offered in the Maryrdonm ofJGeorgis:TTY )M1 oY PCIE3P2IK n c C80X TEN NC'-M rIX'1TX 0 NXNEMWA)N CP TOY HTICNMOO EBOXThis man is a magician (PCC1P21K) because by means ofhis magic (MdFl ) he set demons before us.5 5As an explanation of the foreign term, the words are conjoined in the Coptic Ms. 40, 50of the Pierpont Morgan Library: MD~roC NPC'P?1K, \"a magician-NrOC.\"5 6 In the formPEcP2IK, the word translates other Greek terms for \"magician\" as well, includingpappaK6;, \"sorcerer\" in Deuteronomy 18: 10, and Fxoi6O;, \"enchanter\" in Daniel 4:4.5752.

Spell 261, a charm \"To Become the God Heka,\" constitutes the longesttheological exposition on magic, placed in the mouth of the deity himself. Within the spell,Heka addresses the gods in the presence of the creator and declares his origin and powers.O noble ones who are before the Lord of the universe (\"the All\"),69 behold, I havecome before you. Respect me in accordance with what you know. I am he whomthe Unique Lord made before two things (\"duality\") had yet come into being in thisland by his sending forth his unique eye when he was alone, by the going forth fromhis mouth ... when he put tlu (\"Logos\") upon his mouth.1 am indeed the son of Him wio gave birth to the universe (\"the All\"), who wasborn before his mother yet existed.

Descend, you whohave come in the end. I am HIeka.70The role of Heka thus outlined presents most of the salient features of this god and theconcept he embodies. First of the creations of Re-Atum, Heka appears before theemanation of Hu (the creative word or \"Logos\") from the mouth of the creator. This\"authoritative utterance\" he infuses with his magic vitality, thereby bringing the gods andthe cosmos into existence. The intimate association of magic and word is here givenontological explanation; magic resides in the word itself.71 Described as a son of thecreator, Heka is in actuality the hypostasis of the creator's own power which begets thenatural order. This primordial generative aspect of Heka is further stressed in Coffin Textsspell 648:His powers put fear into the gods who came into being after him, his myriad ofspirits is within his mouth. It was Heka who came into being of himself, at seeingwhom the gods rejoiced, and through the sweet savor of whom the gods live, whocreated the mountains and knit the firmament together.7 269. The word tm (de Buck 1947, pp. 382b and 384d) has been translated by scholars as either \"theuniverse\" or the god, \"Atum,\" but even in the former case a clear pun would be intended on the nameof Alum who is expressly mentioned as the father of Heka (ibid., p. 388c).

Compare Homung 1963, vol. 2, pp. 131ff. and te Velde 1970, pp. 177-78.Hornung's interpretation is based on a passage in the Sphinx Stela of Tuthmosis IV, which follows amention of Seth by one of HkI smsw.

There is thus no interrelationshipbetween Seth and Hk-smnsw, but rather a list of independent gods, as recognized already by Kees(1930). Most recently, Hornung's interpretation has been restated in Cannuyer 1985, pp. 83-84, whorecopies the critical sign as an unambiguous writing of Hkl: .Because of the generaldisagreement on the form of this hieroglyph, I personally inspected the Sphinx Stela on June 24, 1986in the company of Dr. Ann Roth with the assistance of Dr. Ahmed Moussa of the Egyptian AntiquitiesOrganization. The sign (in line 7) is undamaged, unaltered, and absolutely clear: .Cannuyer'sreading is thus completely excluded, and although the sign does not show the \"kidney-bean\" shapeoften attested for Dww, the form is well within the range of \"ovals\" used to write the god's name atGiza. Only the raised and slanted positioning of the \"oval\" above its standard on the Sphinx Steladistinguishes the writings. Compare S. Hassan 1941, pl. 37 (= p. 117): .The Sphinx Stela maythus provide further evidence for the existence of a local cult of Dww in the vicinity (Kees 1980, p.109 [near Heliopolis?]; denied by Helck 1954, p. 37).78. This transfer of power from single deity to general divine property finds its inverse development in theevolution of wr(.t)-hk?.w (\"Great of Magic\") from a common divine epithet to a specific divinepersonification as a protective cobra goddess. Thus, on a \"magical wand\" from the New Kingdom inthe collection of University College London, the relation between Hu (\"Logos\") and Heka istransformed: \"Hu, son of the kas of She-who-is-Great-of-Magic\" (Petrie 1974, p. 58 [Â§112, no. 318]and pl. 51).

Ptolemaicoffering rituals include a purifying incantation against the poisoning of their food bysorcery.8 5 The demon Apophis, who is destroyed by ik' (and Heka), nonetheless possesseshis own, albeit ineffectual hlk: which he marshals against Re:good to him; he who does evil, He does the like to him.\" Drioton interprets this as a warning against aperceived scribal tendency to subordinate all religion to the practice of magic (1928, p. 54), and hisinterpretation is modified in Traunecker 1983, pp. 76-77, where the text is interpreted to mean thatonly the righteous pilgrim will be cured by the statue's magical spells. The discussion of righteousnessrefers not to the pilgrims, however, but to the statue's donor. The statue's praise of Re is made onlyafter an appeal to visitors to praise the donor as a \"noble spirit in her town, who did what the heart ofher god desired\" ( s.t m niw.t s it' )b t ntr- s). The concluding pious remarks about Re seemdesigned to bolster this assertion of the donor's piety, and thus assure the desired gesture oi favor fromtemple visitors-which was the underlying reason for the statue's erection. No suggestion of hostilityto \"magic\" should be implied-especially on a statue which would have been covered in \"magical\"formulae and intended (by the donor!) to provide \"magical\" aid to those suffering from scorpion andsnake bite. On the contrary, it is the erection of the curing statue with its \"magical\" formula that ispraised here as that which \"the heart of her god desired,\" and which proves the donor worthy of beinga \"noble soul of her town.\" For her benefaction she expects to receive praise from the temple visitors,and blessings from Re who rewards good deeds with goodness. Drioton (1927b) had previously soughtto find evidence of a conflict between cult and magic within a spell on a similar Ptolemaic statue basein the Indjandjian collection. As with the Louvre text, however, the supposed conflict derives from atextual misinterpretation. A standard threat to halt cult offerings if the poison continues to circulate ismistranslated as a declaration of the relative ineffectiveness of cultic versus magical healing.82.

Borghouts' 1980 attempt (cols. I 139-40), to equate Egyptian and Zande conceptions isdiscussed above, pp. I11-12. Contrary to the statements of Borghouts, loc. cit., magic in Egypt is viewedalways as a force (like \"life\" or \"strength\") which is consumed and which permeates the body, butnever as a tangible, material \"substance\" (like Zande mangu). The same objections apply to thestatements of Sauneron 1962b, pp. 260-61. Borghouts (1987a, p. 35) now repeats his opinion withreference to magic being eaten, smelled, etc. Magical power may certainly be made to permeate atangible object and thus be manipulated in these ways (see Chapter 3, below), but this does not meanthat magic is itself inherently tangible.94.

Magic (hkw) is my name.136The deity Heka possesses both hk \" and ,hw \"mingled in his body,\" and the two terms occurfrequently in parallel usage.137 Thus, in another description of the creation in Papyrus BM10188, the creator describes the same act by using a verbal derivative of ?thw: t.n -y mibr y, \"I made spells in my heart.\"1 38 In the \"Litany of Re,\" the separation of heaven andearth-accomplished elsewhere by k? -is attributed to hw.13 9 Re is praised as:Unique one who raised the earth through his ;1w.14 0The creative power of both hk: and livw enables Re to sail without water or hauling in theseventh hour of the Amduat: \"It is by means of the magic (hkw) of Isis and the ElderMagician and by the spells (:rhw) on the mouth of this god (Re) himself that he travels.\"14 1Te Velde has even argued that both hk: and ,ijw are found as expressions of general135.

This almost exclusive interest in the spoken and written spell isquite understandable in view of the many Egyptian statements which also stress this aspectof hk?'. Thus Thoth, the god of writing, is regularly qualified as \"excellent of magic\" (mnihk:) in his capacity as \"Lord of hieroglyphs\" (nb mdw-ntr).16 Similarly, hk? may bedirectly identified with the spoken word. Spells are specifically labeled as \"god's words\"(mdw-ntr),16 1 and in the \"Apophis Book,\" the reciter warns the demon: \"Retire, turn backat this magic which has come forth from my mouth for Pharaoh!\"162 Depictions of the godHeka are also instructive. As a ka of Re, he is described at Dendera as \"excellent ofwords,\" a quality which he bestows upon the local deity Hathor, who is in consequence158. For examples, see below, nn. 202 and 203. The translation of qi as \"effective\" is certain in thesestandard recommendations; compare the Demotic equivalent using ir w, \"to be valuable/useful/effective\" in the London and Leiden Magical Pap., col. 29/30: \"It is effective for a youth, and it iseffective for you yourself alone\"; in Griffith and Thompson 1904, pp. 168-69.

The basic study on this technique of \"lists\" is Massart 1959.

The latter term appears inNaville 1892, pl. 20, applied to dwarfs in procession with lector priests (pry-!ib), and was translated\"police\" (Aufseher) in Spiegelberg 1920b, p. 60.

Thus even the application and removal of bandagesand the measurement of drugs may become a ritual accompanied by the recitation ofspells.26 5ENCIRCLINGThe suggested root of the word for remedy, phr.t, is the verb phr, A \"to goaround/encircle,\" whose own magical connotation \"to enchant\" may lie at the heart of thatof phr.t: \"that which encircles/contains/controls\" > \"that which enchants/protects/potion.\"266 As an example of Egyptian terminology expressing magic by rite, phr exhibits along and complex development which well repays study.

In fact, a Demotic version ofa much-copied solar hymn replaces the hieroglyphic \"walking-legs\" determinative of \"togo around\" with the \"man-with-hand-to-mouth\" determinative of \"to enchant.\"286 Ratherthan being an error on the part of the copyist, this may instead reflect a clarification (orlater re-interpretation) of the ancient text.Forming a divine counterpart to the coronation procession about the walls and desert,the circuit of Re both delineates the universe and establishes his sovereignty over it. In thecourse of the development of Egyptian theology, participation in this cosmic circuit hadbeen extended to the king (already in the Pyramid Texts), and the privilege was ultimatelyclaimed by the blessed dead (Book of the Dead) in funerary texts which had as their statedgoal the subjugation of the universe to the needs of the deceased.28 7 From the very nature284.

Earliestof the Demotic funerary texts, the papyrus contains transformation spells in which thedeceased becomes a \"dog enchanted in all his limbs\" (iwiw p/r m 'twe f nb) that \"his bago about as a dog on earth and the underworld daily\" (phr sp 2 by ifm iwiw mrne by. f miw, IlT t tv ,.t m hr-hirw).2 88It is within the context of these funerary texts that one must understand the formulawhich is recited in Setna I \"to enchant heaven, the underworld,\" et cetera. Providing notmerely the logical origin of the formula's terminology, the funerary corpus constitutes aswell the only antecedent for the spell's purpose. The implications of this relationship areclear; Setna's spells are funerary spells used with equal facility by the living, and the phrinvolved is not simply figurative, but-as in the case of the mortuary literature from whichit derives-represents a fusion of the magician with the god Re in his circuit. Thelikelihood of such an assertion is confirmed by the accompanying formula in Setna.Designed for seeing the bark of Re in heaven from both the underworld and the earth, thespell is expressly stated to be of use for both living and dead, corresponds directly to Bookof the Dead spells 133-34, and contains within itself the means for effecting a circuit of\"Spell for letting a man return (p/r) to see his house (on earth),\" in Naville 1886, vol. 2, p. 342 andAllen 1974, p. 108.

The accompanying directions, which areexplicitly designed for a living \"initiate\" (\"do riot use for anyone except yourself\"), include thepreparation of a bowl painted with an image of the solar bark. Filling the bowls with water or oil mayhave enhanced their use in scrying; BD spell 134 recommends that the image of the person to bevisualized in the solar boat should be anointed with oil. Unrecognized evidence for the actual practiceof this rite is forthcoming from the tomb of T-,n-n( r)-hh.w (Bresciani. Pernigotti, and Silvis 1977, pp.73-75., and pl. 27). A similar bowl, misinterpreted as a terracotta hypocephalus and suggested to be ofGreco-Roman date, appears in Maspero 1902, p. 285.

Indeed, Egyptian magical riteshave been characterized as commonplace, and their study dismissed as unrewarding.309Nonetheless, as evidenced by the analysis of phrr, sufficient information survives to provideinsights by no means trivial. Nor is the supposed \"universality\" of Egyptian ritual groundsfor disregard. Thus, although ritual encirclement is well documented in many cultures, thecentrality of the rite in Egyptian magic is striking, and its uses and terminology uniquelyEgyptian.3 1( In any case, it is the viewpoint of the Egyptian practitioner, and not that of thecomparative historian, which determines the significance of the rite. That the rite was offundamental significance to the success of Egyptian magic is evident not merely by thepresence of specified directions in rubrics and depictions in literary, religious, medical, andeven historical texts, but also by the very turns of phrase which the Egyptian employed todescribe magic. Thus in addition to the simple ir- ik:, \"doing magic,\" there are found suchexpressions as sp, \"spell\" (literally \"deed\"); sp nI s, \"deed of a scribe/magical act\"; i,* sp\"spell making\"; ii mI:.t, \"perform a magical book/rite\"; and t-iwy.t, \"taking security!exercising magical control.\"311 Such terms are not, of course, restricted to instances of308.

They are, however, indicative of a fundamentalunderstanding of magic as \"a thing done\"-not simply \"a thing said\" or \"a thingpossessed.\" As the only member of the \"magical triad\" broad enough to include the othertwo, magic by rite is the logical point of departure for an investigation of the range andsignificance of Egyptian hk?. By focusing upon the magical act rather than the spoken spell,the investigator avoids the subjective ambiguities discussed above in Chapter 1, and is ableto formulate an objective criterion for judging the \"magical\" nature of any given act.For the purpose of this study, any activity which seeks to obtain its goal by methodsoutside the simple laws of cause and effect will be considered \"magical\" in the Westernsense. To what extent this \"working definition\" of magic conforms to the Egyptianunderstanding of hk will, it is hoped, become clearer in the course of investigation. Justsuch an approach to Egyptian hk? was suggested in 1925 by Lexa, who added a significantcaveat: Western and Egyptian conceptions of magical actions will not always conform, forcertain acts which seem dependent upon the law of causality to one culture may be viewedas \"magical\" by another.312 Thus, a remedy for graying hair which incorporates the bloodof a black bull could reflect a \"primitive\" understanding of blood as the carrier andtransmitter of the animal's qualities, while another culture might see in the act only \"magicspells.\" Unrecognized examples are found in ibid., pp. 67-68 (0.

To arbitrarilyexclude aspects of magic from discussion because \"it is fully in accordance with thepractice of Egyptologists\"316 in no way provides insight into the fundamental nature ofmagic and severely and artificially limits the scope of investigation. There can be no\"wide\" and \"narrow\" magic. Nor does the concentration upon action in any way excludethe possibility of grasping these fundamentals, as is clear from the analysis of phr. Whetherthe Egyptians consciously recognized a \"law of normal causality\" is open to dispute.3 17Despite the statement of Lexa to the contrary, no Egyptian term corresponding to \"naturalforces\" can be identified.31 8 One Egyptian term which has been suggested to apply to both\"the (ordinary) force of nature\" and the force of hk? is hp, the word for \"custom\" or\"laW.\"319 In the two Demotic Setna stories (as well as in an unpublished Berlin papyrus)the word appears in the combination lip ii sij (\"a hp of writing\") as an expression for awritten spell.32 Although Nims has sought to explain this usage as indicating \"customary\"313. See Lexa 1925, p. 16, for his discussion of spells 29 and 30 from Pap. Ebers. With his analysis shouldbe compared the comments of Frazer 1971, pp. 17-18 and 37 on Hindu and Greek parallels.314. Roeder 1928, p. 197.315. Roeder, ibid., p. 197.316. The statement is from Gardiner 1922, p. 263a. Like Roeder, Gardiner recognized a broad and narrowapproach to magic. Unlike his contemporary, however, Gardiner (in his \"broader\" view) even insistedupon the essential unity of magic and religion. Nevertheless, he bowed to \"custom\" and excluded fromhis study rites for the dead and for the gods.317. See the remarks of Gardiner 1922, p. 262, who suggests that the distinction between magical andordinary actions was never consciously made.318. Lexa 1925, vol. 1, p. 17, suggests that nht.w. nht.t, or wsr.w describe natural law. Rather, all theseterms mean simply \"strength\" or \"power\" (Wh 1: 362-63 and 2: 317).319.

By implication, magic and ordinary natural force would beundifferentiated by the Egyptians.322 However, the reading IHk? is far from clear, and thesupposed *Pr-h p, ' 4., 1A, is in actuality pr- 'nh, \"scriptorium.\"32 3 The relation of hk? toordinary nature thus remains to be specified. As noted above, hk? is certainly a part of thenatural cosmic order. It would not seem, however, to be part of the normal mundane order.The effects of hk\" are not \"supernatural\"; they are \"supernormal\" or \"extraordinary.\"The implications of Lexa's definition of magic have yet to be realized, and to date notreatment of Egyptian magic (including that of Lexa) has concentrated primarily upon theactual practice of the magician. As a result, the instructions which accompany spells in theso-called \"rubrics\" with their vignettes and lists of materials, instruments, and ritual actionsremain largely uninvestigated. Fifty years after Lexa's recognition of the importance ofrubrics for the identification of magic, Morenz urged a study of them to settle the questionof the \"magical\" nature of funerary texts and their potential use by the living; hisdesideratum is still unfulfilled.324 The present study seeks not only to correct this deficiency(compare the discussion of Setna's use of funerary spells, above, pp. 61-64), but towax by hp-n-sh, \"magical formula.\" For a synopsis of this text, see Zauzich 1978, p. 36.

Nims 1948, p. 2 4 5.Contra Nims, ibid., p. 245, nn. 22 and 23, the Egyptian magician Hor is specificallydescribed as using a hp-n-shj only once (col. 6/15, not cols. 6/14 or 6/20). Elsewhere, both he and theNubian use simply hyq. See col. 5/17, and cf. col. 5/13 in which the book of Thoth used by Hor is calledt rnmdy n hyq, \"the book of magic,\" in Griffith 1985, pp. 186-87. The term hIyq/.tks requires no modifierto mark it as Egyptian. Nims was correct, however, in recognizing that the nuance of \"custom\" in theterm hp,Q probably provides the explanation for its use in these passages. As the meaning \"law\"of hp derives from the nuance of \"customary patterns\" of activity, so hp-n-sih should reflect acustomary written pattern, or \"formula.\" It is interesting to note that recently published Egyptian \"lawcodes\" are formulated strictly according to the notion of \"pattern\" (Mattha and Hughes 1975, p. 22 andpassim: \"If a man does X ... here is the pattern of the petition (etc.) which he shall make\"). Thesimilarity of legal and magical phraseology is also notable in Greek papyri (Levi 1975).322. Reymond 1977, pp. 153 and 200 (Pap. Vienna D. 6614, 1. 2).

The practical directions for using the spell involve not spitting butlicking, and are discussed below.The creative power of spittle as envisioned in these Egyptian tales finds numerousparallels, ranging from Akkadian creation mythology3 39 to contemporary English andFrench expressions describing a child as the \"spitting image\" of its parent. In tacitdeference to the Freudian theory of dislocation/displacement, this generative aspect ofspitting has been explained as deriving from a psychological pairing of spittle with semenand mouth with vulva.34 0 Within Egyptian thought, the parallelism of semen and saliva isconfirmed by the myths of Shu and Tefnut, who are variously described as begotten fromAtum by spitting or by masturbation.It was I who created excitement with my fist; I copulated with my hand;I let fall from my own mouth. I spat forth as Shu; I expectorated as Tefnut.34 1The same pairing seems evident in Book of the Dead spell 110, quoted above, where-ifcorrectly reconstructed-the deceased contrasts the fertility of his semen with the spittle ofRe. The suggested \"equivalence\" of mouth and vulva is less certain in Egyptianspeculation, however, for if the irregular birth of Seth from \"the Pregnant One\" may bedescribed in terms of spitting,34 2 the conception of Shu and Tefnut takes place not in themouth but in the hand:335.

The feminine gender of the word for \"hand\" (dr.t) may have strengthened this concept. Thesesymbolic associations are seemingly overlooked in Sourdive 1984.

Zandee 1972, p. 151, (tacitly reversing his own interpretation in 1948, pp. 69 and 92) objects to thetraditional understanding of Atum's creative gestures as complementary, insisting that the god firstejaculated into his own mouth, and only then spit out the divine twins Shu and Tefnut. Unnoted byZandee, the same suggestion was long anticipated by Budge 1904, vol. 1, pp. 297 and 310, and vol. 2,p. 17. This interpretation derives from the phrase hr mi i?, which the authors understand as \"fall into themouth\" in CT spell 77 (de Buck 1938, p. 18a-e): \"when he created orgasm, when the 'Chosen' (='semen') fell into his mouth\"; and Pap. Bremner-Rhind, cols. 28/27-29/1: \"My desire came in myhand, semen fell into my mouth.\" Although hr m may have this nuance, in both cases \"fall from\" is thebetter translation since it is also syntactically acceptable and yields a typical (and expected) referenceto Atum's creation by spittle. The description of spittle \"falling from\" Atum's mouth parallels othermentions of Atum's spittle \"coming from his mouth\" (pr m r. f); cf. CT spell 80 (de Buck 1938, p.31).

Theterm stp in CT spell 77 should be understood as \"spittle\" rather than \"Chosen/semen\"; see Wb 4:357/15: \"drip,\" and the unrecognized example in Urk. 6: \"He (Seth) has spat into the sea of the I.tm.t-cow\"; Schott 1929, pp. 22-23, 1. 20, mistranslated \"versiegen(?).\" Further proof, if any be needed, isafforded by the determinative of \"fall\" in the parallel passage in Pap.

Zandee's citation (1972, p. 151, n. 91) of the unrelated CT spell 576 (\"Semen isin my mouth\"; de Buck 1956, p. 191 e) demonstrates only the known link between semen and saliva; itproves no relationship between mouth and vulva.

The ejection of bodily fluids is obviously common to both, and it is as bodily fluidsthat the pairing of semen and spittle most likely arose. The perceived bond is thus not anexclusive relationship, but shared among all bodily emissions. Divinity was felt to residewithin the creator, and was therefore inherent in the god's tissues and fluids. Examples ofmythological creation by semen or saliva should be understood no differently from tales ofthe creation of mankind from the creator's tears, the goddess Sakhmet from his eye, plantsand minerals from divine sweat, blood, et cetera.34 7 In each instance, the cast off portion ofthe god's body retains divine power and may engender new life. Traditional theory wouldcategorize such a concept as \"magic by contagion\"348 or \"synecdochism,\"3 49 the rationalefor both the veneration of relics and the inclusion of personal effects (oiato) in magicalrites.350SPITTLE AS REMEDYSurely deriving from this same rationale is the ritual use of spittle in the transmission ofhealing and blessing.3 5 1 This is perhaps clearest in texts of purification, in which salivaserves as a medium to convey the invigorating power, and thus the \"blessing\" or skill of agod:My purification is the purification of the spittle which issued from the mouth of Re-Atum.35 2347.

Incontrast to New Testament ritual, Old Testament references stressed the negativeassociations of spittle, which was seen as a symbol of madness (1 Kings 21:13) andworthlessness (Isaiah 40:15), and as a source or transmitter of impurity (Leviticus 15:8).Such common negative associations reappear in Coptic extra-biblical literature, wherespitting is typically linked with raging men, camels, and demons,431 and the practice iscondemned for defiling ritual purity:[Priests] shall not put sandals on their feet when they gointo the church, nor shall they spit in the sanctuary.432This very prohibition motivated the thirtieth wonder of the Arabic \"Life of Saint Pisentius,\"in which a careless priest is struck dead for spitting before the altar. The priest hadunwittingly struck the wing of one of the invisible cherubim, and the angel retaliated byinflicting paralysis and death.433 Spitting at pagan deities is altogether another matter,however, and Samuel of Kalamun is praised for spitting at the rising sun during thereligious services of his Berber master.434429.

The final days of the archimandriteApollo produced the following \"mystery of the faith\":He fell into a great illness when his inward parts were stricken, and thereafter hecontinued to spit blood and phlegm for the rest of his days.

O the sickness that became the healer of another'ssickness! For the sickness constrained our father to expectorate such things. It isholy spittle, one might say. At once when it dropped upon the ground, the sick mantook it in perfect hope and swallowed it. And suddenly the grace of faith becamethe healing of the believer through that holy spittle. And so the man was healed.4 3 7The nadir of this technique is found in the Ethiopic life of Takla Haw~ry~t, in which thesaint lunges forward to consume an expectorated piece of communion bread, whichtransmits healing as \"the body of Christ.\"4 38 In all such tales, holy spittle now functions as a\"bodily relic,\" deriving its power from divinity inherent in the saintly figure. The samenotions of indwelling divinity had sanctified the fluids of the ancient gods, but theveneration of human saints made such materials more accessible.

The existence of similar beliefs in foreign cultures in no way invalidatesthe significance of the concept within Egyptian thought,443 and the complexity of nativephenomena has been little illuminated by the reductionistic categories of \"folk medicine,\"\"homeopathic\" or \"contagious\" magic.444 Nor should these spitting practices be classed assubreligious \"superstition,\" since in each case they are direct expressions of orthodoxtheological concepts, following the precedents of religious leaders whether gods, kings,emperors, or prophets.LICKINGIf spitting serves as an all but universal ritual practice, the related technique of lickingis more rarely encountered.

In so far as the action is but a variant of spitting in thephysical transfer of saliva, the underlying \"mechanics\" should be understood similarly.Like spitting, also, the practice may encompass a variety of meanings, ranging fromcurative to cursing. Egyptian references to \"magical licking\" have received little scholarlyattention, however, and a survey of examples is thus necessary to establish the traditionalpatterns.446Funerary literature again provides the most plentiful source for this magical technique,which serves a variety of purposes already in the Pyramid Texts.

While such negative usage of licking is attested and is discussedbelow, it would seem that these passages refer instead to the healing of Horus's eye by thegods, so that the king is presented with the \"Sound Eye of Horus.\" Elsewhere, therestoration of the eye is attributed to the curative force of divine saliva, and \"licking\"would here parallel \"spitting\" as a \"medico-magical\" technique.449 As previously noted,the \"magical\" transfer of health or blessing by saliva reflects such \"naturally\" observablephenomena as the licking of wounds.

Like much of the supposedly\"funerary\" corpus, this text was certainly devised for use by the living, and its directionsshould be understood literally.46Â°) Daily licking of the hand restores the ritualist's flesh, andechoes the mythological passage in the spell wherein Shu boasts that the sun god Atum\"kissed me every day.\" Such a solar blessing may be expressly equated with licking, as inCoffin Texts spell 1053: \"1 am the Lord of the Horizon, and the daily flame licks me.\"46 1Variants state \"Khepri shines and licks me,\" reinforcing the association of solar \"licking\"with the rays of early dawn.46 2455.

Papyrus Turin 54003, an early Twelfth Dynasty manuscript containing olderspells from the First Intermediate Period, includes among its ophthalmological recipes thefollowing:My eyes are opened by the Great One; My eyes are opened by the Opener; The Eyes[of Hathor] are opened in the House of the Statue; The Eyes of Hathor are opened inthe [House of] Gold, that she might look at that red [...]-animal(?) when he opens hismouth, when he opens his jaws(?), when he looks at that pupil of gold, faience,quartz, and carnelian which flourishes (literally 'grows') on the eye of the majesty ofPtah. When Isis bent over it, she licked it; When I bent over my eye, I licked it. Fromthis my face, from this my eye, I dispelled the blow of a god, goddess, dead man, ordead woman. Dispelled is the obscurity, being thoroughly stripped away. As Shu haslicked what was done to him, so Maat(?) has licked what was done to her. To be saidby a man as he puts water into his eyes.4 63Emulating divine prototypes, the human reciter restores his injured vision by figuratively\"licking\" his own eye through the administration of \"eyedrops.\" Such an eye cure by lick-ing supports the similar interpretation of Pyramid Texts spell 166 and 181, discussed above.From the end of the Middle Kingdom, a literal example of protective licking appears withinthe collection of priestly papyri discovered beneath the Ramesseum (late Twelfth Dynastyto Thirteenth Dynasty). The rubric of the fragmentary Papyrus Ramesseum 14 stipulates:\"This spell is [to be written] on ... fresh ... It should be licked off (nsb) by a man.\"46 4The therapeutic licking of spells and images drawn on the hand continues in Ramessidemagical manuals. The best-known example accompanies the anti-scorpion spell of PapyrusTurin 1993, \"The Legend of Isis and the Secret Name of Re,\"46 5 This extensive spellconcludes:Words to be recited over an image of Atum and of Horus-of-Praise, a figure of Isis,and an image of Horus, drawn (on) the hand of the sufferer and licked off by the man;do likewise on a strip of fine linen, placed on the sufferer at his throat.

Such \"consumption\" of written spells is discussed in greater detailbelow.Even where complemented by notions of \"swallowing,\" however, the curative functionof licking probably still finds its basis in the simple licking of wounds. This is expressedclearly within a third century Demotic remedy for wound treatment, which yet retains theold methodology. Papyrus London and Leiden, col. 20, 11. 1-27, a spell to cure scorpionsting, begins with an historiola directed to the wound itself, detailing the injury of Anubisand his subsequent cure by Isis. In the mythological recitation, Isis instructs Anubis:Lick from your tongue to your heart and vise versa, up to the edges of the wound!Lick to the edges of the wound up to the limits of your strength! What you shalllick, you shall swallow. Do not spit it out on the ground, for your tongue is thetongue of Shay (Fate); your tongue is that of Atum.468The spells' directions then instruct the practitioner regarding his own wound: \"And youshould immediately lick it with your tongue while it is bleeding.\"469 The patient,assimilated to Anubis, is thus depicted as a dog licking his wounds. The spell concludeswith the topical application of enchanted oil. The two incantations which bracket the spellare each designed to \"charge\" fluids with curative power: the flowing blood that is lappedand the oil that is applied. As in Papyrus Turin 1993, the healing spell is rendered tangible,and administered both internally and externally.A further significant feature which links this spell to Papyrus Turin 1993 and the yetearlier Coffin Texts spell 81 is the specific mention of the god Atum, whose kiss, lick, ortongue is invoked within each recitation. Such mentions are clearly motivated by themythological significance of the god's creative saliva. By association with this creatordeity, the lick bestowed by the practitioner acquires generative force, exactly parallelingthe use of \"healing spittle.\"As spittle may be both \"healing\" and \"corruptive,\" so licking may also acquire hostileor dangerous overtones. In \"The Cannibal Hymn\" of the Pyramid Texts (spells 273-74),the king is said to be \"disgusted when he licks the emetics which are in the Red Crown.\"470467.

Here licking is again related to swallowing,4 7 1 but with hostileintent; the king consumes the emetics of the crown just as he devours the hearts and lungsof the gods.Snake remedies provide yet a further link between negative instances of spitting,licking, and swallowing. In the recitation against serpents of Pyramid Texts spell 228, it isstated: \"it has swallowed for itself that which it has licked.\" Though this passage has beenjustly described as obscure,47 2 it would seem that the term licking is used here to describethe method by which a serpent emits its venom, paralleling the common use of \"spitting\"imagery found elsewhere in the Pyramid Texts.4 73 As in these other spells, the intent of therecitation is to make the venom recoil upon the snake itself,4 74 so that the hostile reptile isforced to \"swallow for itself' the poison that it has ejected by licking.This interpretation is confirmed by a Middle Kingdom spell against the Rerek-serpentcarved on a stone box in the Louvre (inv. E 25485).47 5 Within the spell, the serpent isdirectly addressed as: \"licker who has come forth from the cavern! You have swallowedthe eye of Re, you have licked the eye of Baba.\"4 76 As the serpent is later styled the \"sonof Baba\" (literally \"hole-inhabitant\"?),4 7 7 the reptile is thus told that he has attacked hisown father while attacking Re.4 78 An ironic echo of this legend may survive in the latePapyrus Jumilhac, in which Baba attempts to slander Thoth by declaring that \"it is Thothwho has taken what belonged to Re, who has eaten Re, his abomination.

A Demoticexample of curative licking is already cited above, and a further instance appears within arevelation ritual (ph-nr) designed to elicit a direct vision of the healing god Imhotep. InPapyrus Louvre E 3229, col. 7, the god is summoned by the traditional method of licking aformula inscribed on the hand (1. 10).487 The text then instructs the ritualist:You should open your mouth to the ground in a cry saying: [...] 'The Sound Eye,the Sound Eye is what I ate.' You should open your mouth to it in order to lick it (or'when he has licked'). Awake at dawn. You should say: 'Horus is my name. I amHorus the triumphant.'488The surrounding context is fragmentary, and varying interpretations of the ritual scenarioare possible. Nonetheless, the recited spell does allude to the injury and restoration of theSound Eye of the god Horus, who is proclaimed \"triumphant\" at its conclusion. Given thebivalent qualities of ceremonial licking and swallowing, however, it is unclear whether\"eating\" the Sound Eye is to be seen as a hostile reenactment of its injury, or as a positivereference to ingesting its efficacy.489 Correspondingly, licking could be either the physicalenactment of the proclaimed consumption, or a remedy for it.The ritual employment of licking is found in several of the Egyptian magical manualspreserved in the Greek language, and is but one of many indications of the inherently486.

Andhaving kept yourself pure for 3 days in advance, come at morning to face thesunrise; lick off the leaf while you show it to the sun, and then he [the sun god] willlisten to you attentively ... Now this is the name: \"IEE OO IAI.\" Lick this up so thatyou may be protected.4 9 1As in Coffin Texts spell 81, approximately two and one half millennia earlier, the licking isperformed before the rising sun to elicit the god's favor.

Regarding one, you are to cleanseyourself thoroughly; then lick off the name, break it, and throw it away. Hold theother in your partially open right hand and show it to the sun at dawn ... Thenspeak the formula 7 times, crack the egg open, and swallow its contents. 492Recalling Ramesside practice in Papyrus Turin 1993, licking and swallowing are hereassociated as complementary means of internalizing divine force.In PGM XIII (Papyrus Leiden I 395), the traditional methodology occurs in no fewerthan five procedures, entailing the licking of inscribed natron plaques, gold lamellae, andleaves. Three of these instances are found in textual variants of the revelation spell knownas \"The Eighth Book of Moses,\" a composition otherwise dependent upon contemporaryEgyptian temple cosmologies.4 93490. Licking is occasionally accorded magical force in Greece; two similar mythological examples arementioned in Halliday 1967, p. 83 (snakes lick the ears of future prophets, who thereby obtain theability to understand the language of birds). For the relationship between the Greek and nativeEgyptian spells, see Ritner 1995.491. Licking appears in 11. 785 and 789 (Preisendanz 1928, pp. 98-100 and M. W. Meyer 1986, p. 53). Theinscription of a sacred name on the persea leaf recalls Thoth's use of the leaves of the ished-tree, oftenidentified with the persea, for inscribing the names of kings.492. The mention of licking is found in 1. 522 (Preisendanz 1931, p. 24; and H. Martin 1986, p. 132). Theterm \"male eggs\" signifies eggs which will hatch a male offspring (see the discussion by H.

Morton Smith 1984. Smith's hypothetical source criticism appears on pp. 687-88. Despite abridgmentsor reordering of sections, the texts yield a largely consistent ritual order for the licking procedure:recitation of the natron stela (A: 11. 54 and 127; B: 11. 424-25; C: 1.684); licking (A: 1. 132; B: 1.435; C:1. 690); washing off the text (A: 11. 132-33; B: 11. 435-36; C: I1. 690-91); petitioning [the intercessorgods of hour and day] (A: II. 54-55 and 136; B: 11. 424-25 and 440; C: 1. 695); drinking the dissolvedspell (A: 1. 135; B: 1. 441; C: 1. 694); reclining on a mat (A: 1. 136; C: 1. 696); and reciting the\"Hermetic\" spell (A: 11. 138ff.; B: 11. 442ff.; C: 11. 697ff.). Smith's list of textual inconsistenciesbetween the variants (Betz 1986, p. 184, n. 90) conflates the petition of the hour gods with theHermetic spell. Smith (1984, p. 687) is disturbed by the appearance of the angel intercessor toward theconclusion of B, following the deferred description of the invocation to be written on the natron stela:\"to have an angel come at the end of the first invocation and anticipate the god's revelation isstructurally anticlimactic and only to be explained by the supposition that there was an earlier, simplerform which used only one invocation, after which, without any licking, drinking, or repetition, therevelation would occur.\" Despite Smith's discomfort with such an \"anticlimax,\" the appearance ofdivine intermediaries prior to the main revelation is well attested; compare Pap. London and Leiden,cols. 1/1-3/35, using Anubis (J. H. Johnson 1986c, pp. 195-200). Nor does the deferred placement ofthe natron text imply that it was originally only a terminal, spoken spell. Its proper position within theritual is clearly stated (II. 424-25 and 430), and similar deferral of technical subsections is common inmagical texts; cf. the ritual of Pap. London and Leiden, col. 5/1-33 (J. H. Johnson 1986c, pp. 201-03),which appends both its initial invocation and its ointment recipe. Smith's suggestion of an original,simplified version is a non sequitur. Given the great antiquity of the magical techniques of licking andswallowing, it is hardly accurate to suggest that \"when the notion came in that the magician must getthe prayer inside him before he could utter it, the original form was changed ... \" (Smith 1984, pp. 687-88).

At the initiation, this is said six times witheverything else. One writes the 7 vowels on the gold lamella for licking off, and the7 vowels on the silver one for the phylactery.4 97A final example in the papyrus occurs in a spell to repel fear and anger, and entails thestandard solar blessing and amulet.Take a laurel leaf, and write the characters on it thus. Having shown it to the sun,say: 'I call on you ... ' When you have said this three times, lick off the leaf, andkeep the lamella with you.4 98The choice of laurel leaf betrays Greek cultural influence, but the procedure is otherwisecanonically Egyptian.This native procedure has now been followed through three millennia, from thePyramid Texts through the Roman era, and its patterns of ceremonial employment areclear. Where licking serves primarily to transfer saliva, it is but a variant of ritual spitting,and may be construed as a blessing, a cure, or a curse. Where licking serves primarily as ameans of consumption, however, it is but a variant of ritual swallowing, employed either toingest divine force, or to devour hostile figures.SWALLOWINGThe rationale for the technique of magical swallowing is intuitively obvious, beingderived by analogic reasoning from the mundane act of eating.

Suchcommunity stelae were often incorporated within \"healing statues\" that depicted a cippusclasped by the donor, whose image was virtually blanketed with protective spells. Despitethe standard presence of these curative texts, the primary method of utilizing the stelae andstatues involved not reading, but ingested water. Water poured over the stela or statueabsorbed the efficacy of the spells and images and was subsequently drunk by the sufferer.Smaller, portable cippi may have been immersed in bowls of water, but larger healing stat-ues and stelae were provided with shallow basins to collect this curative water, and similarreceptacles are indicated at a healing shrine at Karnak by the remains of inset basins, con-duits, and jars.522 This association is particularly obvious on a little-known cippus examplein Cairo, carved directly on the side of a stone vase, 523 while the texts of the Tyszkiewickzhealing statue in the Louvre explicitly designate the patient as \"this man who drinks thiswater.\"524 The water's restorative function may well be twofold on donated stelae-serving both as medicine for the patient and as a libation for the spirit of the donor.525Late association of consumption with knowledge extends well beyond the common useof cippi.

The existence of an identical practice in Egypt is documentedby numerous examples, the most striking of which is a clay figurine in the Louvre of abound female pierced by thirteen nails (see fig. 2) which was found near Antinoopolis in aclay vase with an inscribed lead plate, or lamella.543 Both the figure and its accompanyingGreek inscription correspond directly to a procedure described in the great magical papyruspreserved in the Bibliothbque Nationale of Paris (PGM IV, 11. 296-466) in which themagician is instructed as follows:Take wax (or clay) from a potter's wheel and make two figures, a male and afemale. Make the male in the form of Ares, fully armed, holding a sword in his lefthand and threatening to plunge it into the right side of her neck. And make her withher arms behind her back and down on her knees. And you are to attach the'personal effects' (ouota) to her head or neck ...

To tracethe development of this tradition, and the position of the Louvre figurine within it, one mustfirst examine the techniques not of private but of royal magic, attested from the earliestremains of ancient Egypt.THE BOUND PRISONER MOTIFIn a predynastic royal tomb of Gerzean date (ca. 3400-3200 B.C.) at Hierakonpolis(modern Kom el-Ahmar) was discovered a wall painting whose wide-ranging subjectmatter provides the first examples of numerous artistic themes which were to becomecanonical throughout the remainder of Egyptian history.

The reason for their appearance is not difficult to discover, and is explicitlypresented on the famous Narmer palette of Dynasty \"0\" from the temple precinct ofHierakonpolis.54 7 On the \"recto\" of this palette, as the standing king grasps his kneelingenemy by the hair and raises his mace to strike, he faces the falcon god Horus who standsatop an anthropomorphic symbol of the defeated territory with its head tethered by a ropeheld in the god's claw. In both posture and meaning, the acts of king and god are identical.The victory of the king, as the god's representative on earth, is ipso facto the victory of thegod. Conversely, the political opponents of the king are transgressors against the god,demonic agents of chaos and death in an unending holy war. The king's sacrifice of thekneeling captive, like the palette which records it, is offered to the god not tocommemorate the conquest, but to perpetuate it. Rendered tangible and permanent instone, the image was designed not simply to reflect, but to create reality, guaranteeing by\"sympathetic magic\" the victory of the state and the gods. So pervasive was this image tobecome, that the exterior walls of virtually every Egyptian temple were provided with arendition of the scene, which rapidly acquired more of a ritual than an historical validity.548The fully developed motif is exemplified by the great pylon of Medinet Habu, on whichRamses III sacrifices prisoners before Amon, while the base line upon which both stand iscomposed of a series of anthropomorphic symbols of foreign lands, which are crushedunderfoot by king and god alike in imitation of Horus on the Narmer palette.549 Forming a545.

From the earliest temple sector inAbydos, and dated to the First or Second Dynasty, derive two small stone figurines in aLucerne collection which depict kneeling prisoners with their hands bound behind theirbacks.552 On one of these carvings (A 55), the neck is drilled to permit the captive to besuspended from a string (see fig. 3b). The figure is thus a three-dimensional rendering ofthe image found on the Hierakonpolis wall-painting and the predynastic palettes, beingdesigned to enable the possessor to have his enemy physically by the throat.553 That theuse of such statuettes was not isolated is shown by the discovery at Hierakonpolis of asimilar figure in glazed pottery of equal date.554 As in the case of the palettes, these werepresumably votive objects for the benefit of god and king.Designed more specifically for royal benefit are the numerous stone statues ofprisoners discovered within the funerary complex of Pepi I.555 Clearly distinguished bytheir physiognomy as Nubians, Libyans, or Asiatics, the statues do not represent individualenemies, but serve instead as symbols of the neighbors, and thus traditional enemies, ofEgypt.

With peg for pin, the figure is pierced not once but eternally; for withevery motion of the door leaf, the peg is ground deeper into the back of the haplessprisoner. The complement to this representation is found in a description of a door socket inhell, written in the second Demotic romance of Setna Khamuas. Within an episode oftencompared to the parable of Dives and Lazarus, the heroes visit the underworld to witnessthe outcome of the funerals of a poor and a wealthy man. On entering the fifth portal of thenetherworld, the heroes find that \"the pivot of the door of the fifth hall was fixed in theright eye of a man who was pleading and lamenting loudly.\"559 The recipient of this fatewas the wealthy man, whose impious acts on earth qualify him as an enemy of the gods,and the counterpart of the terrestrial enemy of gods and king depicted in the First Dynastydoor socket.They found his misdeeds more numerous than the good deeds which he had doneon earth.

The fundamentaldifference between them is the result of a gradual, internal religious modification, wherebythe ethical misdeeds of an individual have come to outweigh the political misdeeds of aforeign enemy.561 The ethically recast imagery of the Setna tale was in turn influential andis still invoked in ninth century Coptic stories of the miscreant Symmachus: \"The tormentor558.

Contemporary with the door socket, and deriving from thesame temple precinct, is an ivory figure of a kneeling bound captive which served as thefoot of a ceremonial chair (see fig. 4a).56 3 The chair's occupant would thus rest upon theback of the prisoner exactly as the god Horus had perched atop the conquered enemy onthe Narmer palette. Two Second Dynasty statues of an enthroned figure of kingKhasekhemwy from the same site reveal an elaboration of this theme. Running along thebase of the statues, below the feet and chair of the king, a sprawling jumble of enemies iscarved lying prostrate in slaughter, crushed beneath the feet of the monarch.564 Thetrampling underfoot of the enemy, depicted unambiguously here, becomes a permanentfeature of Egyptian royal seated (and striding) statues-with a slight modification.Replacing the literal images of the vanquished enemies is a series of Nine Bows, thesymbols of the traditional foes of Egypt, carved as if protruding from beneath the feet ofthe ruler.56 5 In conformity with the divine prototype of the image, statues of the king asOsiris may display the same feature.566 Figures of trussed captives (often tied to thesymbol of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt) continue to appear, however, upon562.

Remains of mummy linen still adhered to the upper sideof the left sole. Lacking archaeological context, stylistic dating is necessary and would suggest a lateNew Kingdom date. In the excavation \"Teilungsliste.\" Holscher even suggested that the sandals mightderive from the mummy of Ramses III! Further validating such images are the Book of the Dead spellscopied on Late Period coffins that promise the subjugation of enemies beneath the sandals of thedeceased; compare Rowe 1938, pp. 183-84 (= BD spell 151b, Â§S3). Contra Corcoran 1988, pp. 111-12, the physical placement of these spells elsewhere on the coffin does not invalidate their importancefor the inspiration or continued depiction of the motif.

I. Bell 1953, p. 64, quotingG. Elliot Smith and Warren R. Dawson. The hostile nuance of trampling, implicit in the placing of aname or image on a sandal, is still current and provocative.

These three-dimensional enemy heads, themselves thedescendants of the free-standing prisoner statues of the Old Kingdom, thus provide thearchitectural setting for the fusion of the two traditional techniques of ritual conquest-thestatic symbolism of relief known from the Narmer palette and the pylon facades, and the\"inherent kinetics\" of the Hierakonpolis door socket, footstools, et cetera. Architecturalsetting provides yet a third, unnoted dimension to the symbolism, for the placement of thewindow at head height establishes the king directly above his audience as well.578 As theking and his image are equated by standing above the base line, so the audience and thecarved prisoners must correspond by lying beneath that line. From a distance, the visualimpression-and concomitant symbolism-of the king atop his audience would beunmistakable. Developing simultaneously with the motif of the bound prisoner, the themeof the subservient Egyptian population, symbolized as rhy.t-birds (a^), had been used inconjunction with the former in the decoration of throne, dais and statue bases, windows ofappearance, et cetera.579 At Medinet Habu, the king was quite literally Hr hr tp rby.t,\"Horus atop ('on the heads of') the masses.\"580 Although ornate, the Medinet Habu palacewindow is by no means unique.

Such an examination reveals atonce that the motif is not an element of popular or folk decoration generally current oncommon wares or utensils.584 Rather, it is confined to the ornamentation of state and583. For the stelae of \"Horus on the Crocodiles,\" see above, Chapter 3, nn. 518-19, and below, p. 207, n.956. For the hostile, Sethian nature of the crocodiles and other wild animals on these cippi, see below,n. 743. The traditional understanding of these animals as defeated and trampled enemies has beenquestioned by Quaegebeur 1984, pp. 131-43, repeated in summary in 1987, p. 187. Quaegebeur wouldview these dangerous animals as emissaries or assistants of the superior deity, ultimately positive innature. The primary notion of such images, however, is to express the deity's mastery over thebeasts-regardless of whether the animals' aggression is felt to be directed \"inward\" against the godor \"outward\" toward other noxious forces. The animal is shown to be subject/subservient to the god,whether as assistant or opponent. In either case, the iconologic notion remains \"superposition =control.\" The distinction between \"assistant\" and \"opponent\" need not be as great as posed, since theprimary magical method of neutralizing serpents, et cetera, is to make their attack recoil uponthemselves (\"evil to turn away evil\"), with force directed \"inward\" rebounded \"outward.\" Whensnakes are directed against snakes, opponents are made to function as allies, and \"assistant\" meansonly \"subjected opponent.\" The cobra is first and foremost a dangerous animal; its dangerous forcemay be controlled and thus directed by a god-only thus is it beneficent. The image of a god walkingon (\"controlling\") a uraeus is therefore not so surprising, contra Quaegebeur 1984, p. 136. By the samerationale, Horus' scorpion wife T?-Bt.t, or Isis iddy.t, can subjugate and repel scorpions; their functionis to restrain or destroy their own \"emblematic\" animal. This does not make the scorpion a \"good\"animal, merely a \"subjugated\" one. Contra Quaegebeur ibid., p. 143, the myths of Horus establishclearly that such \"trampled\" animals were a genuine threat to the deity. Horus' triumphant depictionon cippi as \"master of the animals\" (a posture attested from Pre-Dynastic times in the Asiatic-inspiredGebel el Arak knife handle) shows his ability to throttle his helpless enemies in his hands, whilereducing his crocodile opponents to subservience \"beneath his feet,\" as in common Egyptian idiomsexplicitly quoted on cippi: \"Every male and female serpent, every snake, every lion, every crocodile isunder the feet of this god\" (Whitehouse 1990-91, p. 5). There need be no great contrast here withimages of Bes atop frogs as symbols of fertility (Quaegebeur 1984, pp. 140-42, fig. 17). In both casesthe deity controls and directs the force which the animal incarnates. On this question, compare thedisputed case of Tutu and the disease demons, in Ritner 1989b, pp. 111-12. Further confirmation of thetraditional assessment of the trampled animals is afforded by an unpublished fragment of Ptolemaic(?) mummy cartonnage deriving from Dendera (EEF 1897-98), OIM no. 4784 (see here fig. 8). Halfof the bottom of a footcase, the cartonnage depicts a scorpion crushed beneath the sole of themummy's sandal, a representation directly comparable to late footcases provided with bound prisonersin identical position (see above, n. 571). The equation of hostile prisoner and scorpion is thusobvious-both are trod beneath the sandals of the victorious deceased.584. Being neither used by the general populace nor displayed chiefly for their benefit-contra Hayes1990, vol. 1, p. 113, who suggests that it provided \"a naive sense of satisfaction and security.\" Many ofthese images (the sandal soles, for example) would have been invisible to all but the king (and thegods); they could hardly qualify as propaganda.

Even for such public rituals, the intended chief beneficiaries of this \"propaganda\" were thegods. Bound prisoners are not a typical decorative theme on common pottery, mirrors, cosmetic items,et cetera, but their use is restricted to royal, votive, and religious contexts. Thus, while captives mayappear on the \"mummy sandals\" of deceased (and ritually divinized) private individuals, they wouldnot have appeared on the sandals used by such individuals in daily life.

In each case, the incorporation of theimage as handle or support requires that it be grasped or crushed. Like the Hierakonpolisdoor socket, the inherent use of the object produces the symbolic result. Simply by makinga state appearance, the king becomes a passive actor in the ritual destruction of theenemies of Egypt.What artistic and archaeological evidence suggests, textual evidence confirms.Although the earliest inscribed example of the \"subjugated prisoner\" motif, the Narmerpalette, fails to label the central scene, one might reasonably expect that the Egyptiandescriptive term would have comprised a verb of striking (sqr, hwi, etc.)-especially sincethe native expression for captive, sqr- 'nih, meant literally \"one who is stricken yetliving.\"586 In fact, however, that does not often appear to have been the case. Whendescriptive labels do accompany these scenes, the action is generally termed ptpt,\"trampling,\" even where the visual suggestion of trampling is secondary, or even non-existent.587 On the Narmer palette as elsewhere, the fundamental significance of the imageand rite lies not in the action of the king, but in that of the god Horus which the kingevokes. Quite simply, the motif of the prisoner, like that of the r hy.t, makes concrete the\"superiority\" of the victor as \"Horus atop the masses.\" Physical elevation producespolitical, social, and cosmic domination.58 8 So inextricably mixed are the notions of585. The distinction is confused by Hayes 1990, vol. 2, pp. 337-38, who improperly contrasts Ramessideexamples of this hostile ritual motif with earlier, (non-ritual) peaceful scenes of foreigners as an indexof Egypt's worsening foreign relations. Genuinely comparable imagery, like the Hierakonpolis doorsocket, statue bases of all periods, and the Tutankhamun objects, disproves Hayes' suggested contrast.Ramesside imagery may differ in quantity, but not in nature.586.

It is important to note that not all execrationfigurines are provided with text, and the stress here laid on named figurines should not devalue themany uninscribed images probably linked to their victim by oral recitations. For a selection of these,see Petrie 1902, p. 26 (no. 39) and pl. 53 (clay torso with arms bent behind back, from the temenos ofthe Osiris temple at Abydos, \"early dynasties\"); Petrie, Griffith, and Murray 1888, p. 73, Â§70 and pl.40, nos. 8-13 (thirty to forty limestone figures, Saite); Schoske and Wildung 1985, pp. 83 (no. 65,prone limestone figure of a tied Nubian, Nineteenth Dynasty) and 162-63 (at least six broken clayfigures of Asiatics, Ptolemaic period).612. An intermediate position between the specificity of the execration texts and the generality of the\"prisoner motif\" is found in the Ramesside Statue Base Cairo 755 with prisoner heads labeled \"chiefof vile Mitanni\" and \"chief of vile Cush,\" in Borchardt 1930, pp. 75-76 and Wildung 1973, pp. 112-13.Where the current ruler was unknown, the execration texts followed this same pattern.

Completing the later pattern isan enumeration of generally threatening forces, including evil speech, slander, plots, strife,nightmares,622 et cetera. Whereas previous sections defend against political or militarythreat, these concluding designations serve to ward against magical assault, perhaps inanticipation of similar execration magic by Egypt's foes.623In any individual find, the entire sequence of foreigners, Egyptians, and forces mayappear in multiple copies by different scribes, and, like the Old Kingdom (and NewKingdom) examples, the resulting assemblage is most often interred within a traditionalnecropolis.

The texts of the Middle Kingdom assemblages show progressive development from Old Kingdomprototypes, providing internal evidence for their chronological sequence: the Cairo alabaster figurines(Sesostris I), the Mirgissa deposit (Amenemhat II-Sesostris II), the Berlin bowls (mid TwelfthDynasty), and the Saqqara figures (end of Twelfth Dynasty).

The perception of a Nubian magical threat is still in evidence in the Roman period, seethe second Setna tale in Lichtheim 1980, pp. 138-51. Actual adoption of Egyptian execrationtechniques by the Hebrews (Amos 1:2-2:16) has been suggested in Bentzen 1950; followed by West1971, p. 244; but denied by Weiss 1969. For this question, see the obvious execration rite of the brokenpottery in Jeremiah 19:1-11 (noted also in Koenig 1990, p. 101): \"Thus said the Lord, 'Go, buy apotter's earthen flask, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests, and goout to the valley of the son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the wordsthat I tell you' ...

It should be noted, however, that the term sqr \"strickenone/prisoner\" is applied prospectively to foreign soldiers who have not been captured,628and the form of the figurines themselves constitutes a \"wish fulfillment\" projected upon the624. See the discussions by Sethe 1926, pp. 7-13 and 18ff.; Posener 1940, pp. 20-24; and Koenig 1987a,p. 306.625. The desire to ensure that the records were kept current is reflected by the updating of the names ofrulers and states (Sethe 1926, pp. 42, 62, and 70; Posener 1940, pp. 24-25; idem 1976a, pp. 438-39;idem 1987, p. 18; and Koenig 1990, p. 104, textual note d [successive heirs of Kit]).626. Compare the remarks of Posener 1966, p. 284, n. 1; noted in Koenig 1987a, p. 306 and idem 1990, p.102. The central figures of the Mirgissa deposit were made of limestone, not local to the area and thuspresumably sent by the royal chancellery. Posener suggests that these figures were dispatched alreadyinscribed to serve as a model for the other textual copies at the site.627. Versus Sethe 1926, pp. 62-69 (followed by Wilson 1969c, p. 329), who was unaware of the feminineexamples and interpreted mwt as the optative form of the verb \"to die,\" yielding the translation \"LetNN die.\" Posener's re-interpretation of the term as a noun was first advanced hesitantly in 1939b, p. 46and more forcefully in 1958, pp. 265-70. For the question of local input in these rites, see ibid., p. 269and Posener 1976a, pp. 439-40. Egyptians not described as \"dead\" occur in the Giza texts discussed inAbu Bakr and Osing 1973, pp. 129-30; the alabaster figures in Posener 1987, pp. 55-56 and comparethe Cairo \"tablets\" discussed in Posener 1976a, p. 439.

For the reading sqr (phonetic spelling), see Posener 1966, p. 283 and 1940, pp. 26-28 versus van deWalle 1940, pp. 108-09, who accepts a variant reading hnk, \"trusted ones,\" for the Berlin texts(following Sethe 1926, pp. 15-16). The anticipatory use of the term sqr is acknowledged by Posenerhimself (1977, pp. 504-05). Such usage is perfectly in accord with standard Egyptian practice;compare the common application of the word hsy, \"wretched/defeated,\" to the names of Cush, Khatti,etc. (Wb 3:399/11).141"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICEassociated individuals.62 9 The term \"deceased\" could be similarly anticipatory,630 and therelated Bremner-Rhind ritual specifically includes enemies of both king and practitioner\"whether dead or alive.\"63 1 Private influence is probable also in those finds consisting onlyof Egyptian names on individual figures. Lacking the \"rebellion formula\" (and thus anyclear indication of state interest), these figures may nonetheless retain the term mwt, andare subjected to the same treatment as figures in ostensible state productions. Despite theimplication of a private impetus for these deposits, they have been analyzed as forming aunity with the Egyptian section, whose social implications are discussed below.BINDINGAside from the one certain and one possible use of wishful terminology, the execrationlists contain nothing which, in itself, could be called magical, serving merely to identify theindividual, nation, or force with the inscribed pot or figure.6 32 The desired magical effect ofthese assemblages must thus derive not frome te text, but from the ritual to which they weresubjected.6 33 Just what might constitute this ritual has been the subject of some dispute.629. See the remarks of Posener 1974, p. 400: \"Couleur et attitude portent malheur aux victimes, ellesconstitutent un pr6envoftement.\" The phrase is echoed in Koenig 1987a, p. 302.630. The \"dead man\" determinative ,(Gardiner Sign-list A 14) after foreign names on the Berlin bowls(Sethe 1926, p. 19) has the same implications.631. See col. 26/2: \"Now make for yourself every enemy of Re, every enemy of Pharaoh, dead or alive,together with every accused one in his heart\" (Faulkner 1933, pp. 56 and 1937b, p. 171); and col.28/17-18: \"Then inscribe for yourself these names of all male and female enemies whom your heartfears as the enemies of Pharaoh, whether dead or alive\" (Faulkner 1933, p. 69 and 1937b, p. 175).632. Notably, no verbs of cursing appear anywhere in the standard text, producing an extended list whosesignificance is clear only from its context on prisoner figurines or broken pottery. Compare the remarksof Sethe 1926, pp. 19-20 (discounting his example of mwt, \"Let NN die\"). Posener 1987, p. 1, n. 2,thus insists that the common designation \"execration text\" is inappropriate, accepting only the term\"proscription.\" However, some cursing elements do occur, such as the selection of red ink and enemydeterminatives, and the prospective use of sqr (and possibly rmwt) just mentioned. The Cairo alabasterfigures follow the names of Nubian princes with insults to produce the pattern: \"NN, against whom onesays, 'Is there anyone attached to him?' (var. 'Are you an adversary,' 'Bull born of a [female ape],''Calf,' etc.)\" (Posener 1987, pp. 20-31 and 1977, pp. 503-04). Mud tablets from Lisht also qualify theintended enemies as \"separated from\" (wl r) former names and titles (Hayes 1955, pp. 57-58 andVernus 1974, pp. 121-23). Such derogatory epithets are not simple expressions of pique, but knowncursing techniques-as acknowledged by Posener 1987, p. 21: \"le ridicule tue.\"633. Contra Posener 1975b, p. 407, who emphasizes the spell with reference to the late execration ritualagainst Seth (Schott 1929); similarly in Posener 1974, p. 401, where the operative force is said to bepsychological rather than magical: \"L'effet recherch6 est obtenu non par un moyen sumaturel, mais defamon indirecte en atteignant I'imagination, par une sorte de contrainte psychologique.\" One mightwell wonder how the \"contrainte psychologique\" of an act carried out in an Egyptian graveyard wouldaffect a chieftain in a hilltop village in Palestine, a tent in Libya, or a hut in Nubia.142"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"IMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIESWith regard to the figures, at least, one obvious constituent was bondage, for in addition tothe summary indication of tied limbs on representations in alabaster and wood,634 clayexemplars from Giza and Saqqara reveal holes for binding or suspension with cords.6 3 5Such images parallel the archaic prisoner figurine from Abydos discussed above (p. 116),and provide but the first of many correspondences between the execration rite and torturesenacted on earth, in the netherworld, and in temple cult and private enchantment.636 As thetangible counterpart to the \"surrounding\" (Sni) and \"encircling\" (phr) so prominent in theEgyptian vocabulary of magic, physical binding is correspondingly \"bivalent,\"6 37 signifying634.

A concise discussion of the significance of binding derived largely from German folklore appears inMorenz 1958, with which cf. the entirely \"cross-cultural\" interpretation of Petrie 1972, p. 29. Whilesuch interpretations of shared symbols are broadly correct, they cannot elucidate the specific range ofmeaning within individual societies. Thus, in contrast to the German \"Bindezauber,\" the French \"nouerl'aiguillette a quelqu'un,\" the Greek Krt T.&Ft;, and the Latin \"ligatio\" (see Kropp 1930-31, vol. 3, p.199) or even \"religio,\" Egyptian terminology generalized the notion of \"surrounding\" in preference tothat of \"binding.\" The distinction is of some significance as a reminder that even such common cross-cultural magical phenomena as \"magical knots\" are evaluated and understood differently by differingcultures (as is magic itself) and should be analyzed in cultural context. Contrast the \"culturally-specific\" analysis of \"sealing\" in Ritner 1984b, pp. 209-21. \"Binding\" as an expression for \"magic\" israrely used in Egyptian texts. The term ts.t in the late Pap. Salt 825 has been translated \"conjuration\"by Derchain, but only the literal nuance of \"knot\" (as \"phylactery\") may be intended: \"(a rite) thatoverthrows magic (hk?.w), ties/firms knots, fixes knots, and subjugates the entire world\" (cols. 5/10-6/1; see Derchain 1965, pp. 139, 7*, and pls. 5-6). Amuletic knots are used throughout this rite;Derchain, ibid., pp. 140 (cols. 7/9, 8/1, and 8/5) and 143 (col. 15/6). A single, highly uncertain Demoticexample of \"binding\" (mrL.t) as a technical term for \"magic\" has been suggested in Spiegelberg1917a, pp. 34-35 (col. 12/13) and p. 144 (no. 330). Coptic use of binding terminology is more commonbut may derive from Greek precedent, see MOYP, \"binding magic\" as a type of spell in Crum 1939, p.181b, and cf.

The protective aspect of binding (ts) and knots (ts.t) derives from the nuance of \"joining/comingtogether\" both in acts of creation and as protection from threatened dissolution. Thus the same word tsis used when semen \"comes together\" in conception (Wh 5: 398/3-5), Atum punningly \"joins together\"his fist at the world's creation by masturbation (Pap. Bremner-Rhind, col. 28/22), a deity \"comestogether\" in the egg (CT spell 938 and Wh 5: 398/1), Isis \"joins\" the severed limbs of Osiris, and thedeceased \"knits together\" his own limbs (Wh 5: 397/15-20). Embodied in the royal cartouche (seeGardiner 1973, p. 74), the positive significance of knots is metaphorically applied to the red crown inCT spell 684: \"it ties up life for me\" (see Faulkner 1977, p. 250 = de Buck 1956, p. 314). For adiscussion of the root meaning of ts as \"to congeal/make firm/solidify,\" see Roquet 1984, pp. 355-85.639.

At theLuxor temple, Amenhotep III performs the ceremony before Amon-Re by striking two ofthese pots together.656 The use of such red vessels (dir.w) continues into the Ptolemaicperiod, where as in the archaic liturgy-they are carried about the site to be purified.6 57While the sources explicitly linking the \"Breaking of the Red Vases\" with offeringmeals are strangely silent about the significance of the act, the earliest reference to the ritein the Pyramid Texts is quite specific; breaking the red vases inflicts terror upon one'senemies.658 The aggressive nature of the ritual is reinforced by the simultaneousbutchering of a bull in the slaughterhouse of the pyramid temple.659 The pairing wasfundamental, and, relocated before the private tomb, the sacrifice accompanies NewKingdom performances as well.60 The breaking of the vessels corresponds to thesectioning of the bull, and in a subsequent libation, the strewn water was perhaps equated653.

Anintact deposit of broken vessels from such a funerary meal appears in G. T. Martin 1985, pp. 3 and 47-48. The relationship of this rite to that of the Pyramid Texts (and execration texts) was denied bySethe as quoted in Borchardt 1929, p. 16. n. 8. because the earlier ritual seems to have beenaccomplished by pestle, whereas the New Kingdom examples show vessels simply thrown to theground. However, the discovery by Moret of an example of sd d. r.w performed by smashing twovessels together shows that it is not the method of breaking, but the breaking itself which is the basis ofthe rite.

Oh Re, expelhim from his place and set me in his place.672Although this text might seem straightforward without symbolic nuance, its CoffinTexts descendant suggests that the opposite is true.

It is difficult to resist the conclusion that these Coffin andPyramid Texts spells actually pertain to the rite, and that the unidentified enemy (or atleast an enemy) repelled from offering meals by breaking the serving vessels was thevulture.Whether or not this identification is correct, the ritual nature of \"breaking\" in the CoffinTexts is clear.

Thus by the Middle Kingdom, the serpent Apophis is characterized as\"He of the broken kas\" (Idu-k: .w).6 80 In the second Semna stela of Sesostris III, the kingbelittles his Nubian opponents as \"wretches, broken of hands and hearts.\"681 The imagery676.

The elements of this initiatory rite, though enigmatic, seem to relate to the Osiriscycle: 1) rejoicing in the land of Phoenicia (cf. the finding of Osiris in Byblos, in Griffiths 1970, p.141); 2) the severed haunch representing the leg of Seth which struck Osiris; 3) the water in whichOsiris was drowned (cf. te Velde 1977, pp. 84-91); and 4) the torch for repelling Seth (Griffiths 1958,pp. 5-7).

But while theBerlin collection, purchased from a Luxor dealer, was incomplete and without context, thein situ Mirgissa assemblage has revealed a rite far richer in both the quantity andcomplexity of its elements. For the \"deposit\" actually comprises four separate but relatedinterments involving 197 broken inscribed red vases (and ostraca)-as compared with 80in Berlin-in addition to 437 broken uninscribed red vases, 346 assorted mud figures, 3limestone prisoner figurines with the head of a fourth, and the remains of a human691. Posener (1940, pp. 19-20) noted that the breakage of the Brussels figurines was accidental. But in1939b, p. 45, he suggested that the burial of figurines constituted a parallel ceremony to that of thebreaking of the red vases. Both breaking and burial were features of the Giza ritual (Osing 1976a, p.156 [figures broken prior to deposition in pot and burial]).692. Ritual breaking of these figures was suggested by J&quier 1940, pp. 26-29 but denied by Lauer 1969-70, pp. 42-43 and Lauer and Leclant 1969. See now Verner 1985, p. 149.693.

For while scattered finds from the comparable sites of Uronartiand Shelfak could corroborate the existence of a similar, standardized rite for the Nubianfortresses of the Middle Kingdom,699 intact deposits within Egypt from the Old, Middle,and New Kingdoms are manifestly not identical,70 0 and the Saite descendant of theMirgissa rite, at the fortress of Defennah, consisted only of some thirty to forty limestoneprisoner figurines, buried and often broken (see fig. 13b).701 Nonetheless, many of theelements of the Mirgissa deposit recur in differing combinations within the less complexvariations of the rite, and it is as an index against which to compare these variations thatthe Mirgissa assemblage is most valuable.Situated some 600 meters from the fortress itself, the deposit lay within a small sandydepression beside a granite outcrop well removed from the normal thoroughfares of the fortand its adjacent town. Vila, the discoverer and excavator of the deposit, has attempted toexplain its placement by suggesting that the Egyptians adhered to a hypothetical list of696. The revised tabulation of pots and figures appears in Vila 1973, p. 630.697. The magical intent of these ancestors to modern cornerstones is clearly demonstrated in the deposit ofclay disks recovered from the Middle Kingdom Nubian fortresses of Kuban, Buhen, Areika, andUronarti (contemporary with the Mirgissa assemblage) which depict Egyptian soldiers leading bound(Nubian) enemies (Siave-Sderbergh 1941, pp. 132-35 and Posener 1958, p. 254). Although, Posener(ibid.) doubts that there could be \"une relation quelconque avec les figures d'envoutement,\" theidentity of purpose in the two rites is obvious: the eternization of the destruction and subjugation ofEgypt's enemies.

Into this pit were placed five unbroken crucibles of dried mud,duplicates of the crucible used for copper smelting which Petrie had recovered from theturquoise mines at Serabit el Khadem.725 Although the significance of these objects atMirgissa has yet to be noted, there can be little doubt but that they represent the \"furnaceof the coppersmiths\" (mn.t n.t hmty.w var. ww?, \"furnace\") specifically stipulated by the722.

From the fracturemarkings on the reconstructed vessels, it is clear that Sethe's original suggestion wascorrect, and that the pots were broken by percussion with a striker, perhaps the stonespheroid found near the top of the central deposit.7 36 Both inscribed and uninscribed redpots were broken, with the latter predominating (at the ratio of one inscribed sherd to tenuninscribed sherds at the bottom, one to twenty at the top). The preponderance ofuninscribed vessels should not be dismissed as simply \"filler,\" for it is their presence whichfirmly links the execration rite with the \"breaking of the red pots\" performed in funeral andtemple ceremony.737 Although the only enemies that the fortress would have been likely toface were Nubians, the entire execration formula was nonetheless systematically copied byseveral scribes, with a complete series apportioned over as many as four vessels.738 Somepreference does seem to have been shown to the Nubian section, however, for it is the onlytext currently identified at all levels of the deposit.739FIGURINESAt seven regular intervals, the stream of broken pottery was interrupted by the castinginto the pit of a standard collection of mud figures comprising a severed human head or734.

A suggested link between this ritual and the Mirgissa finds isnow suggested also by Koenig 1987a, p. 311, n. 10.749. The number seven figures prominently in Egyptian theology in the seven Hlathors who decree fate, theseven creative utterances who begat fate (ts, var. dis, discussed above, pp. 46-47), the seven uraeiwho guard Re, the seven gates of the underworld palace of Osiris, the seven horns of the goddess ofwriting, et cetera. Perhaps influenced by these associations with deities of creation and authority, thenumber abounds in religious and magical literature from the Pyramid Texts through the Coptic period.In the Coffin Texts alone, the number appears in spells 164, 398, 401,406-09, 479, 612, 662, 691, 695,729, 744, 772, 997, 1011, 1027, et cetera.

Corresponding injuries on Brussels figurines, pierced by three holes inthe crown of the head, probably attest to a similar practice at Saqqara.752 At Mirgissa, yetfurther ritual striking must have occurred, for although the group was undisturbed, one ofthe figurines was found reduced to small fragments. This suspicion is confirmed by the OldKingdom deposits from Giza in which the clay figures were shattered before their burial injars.75 3 The single head may derive from a similar destruction prior to burial, or (like themud head in the central pit?) allude to the sacrificed Nubian, whose severed skullconstitutes the major component of the third deposit.754HUMAN SACRIFICEIt is the content of this third deposit which yields the most curious and unexpectedelement of the Mirgissa find, for it provides the first indisputable evidence for the practice750. By virtue of its association with the cardinal directions, four is the most common symbol of\"completeness\" in Egyptian numerological symbolism and ritual repetition (Sethe 1916, pp. 31-33).For the common ritual use of four enemy figurines, see the examples discussed in Parker, Leclant, andGoyon 1979, pp. 61-65. Although four is the expected number of figures, an illegal excavation atHelwan(?) produced five alabaster examples later acquired by the Cairo Museum (see Posener 1939a,pp. 313-17; and the complete publication in idemrn 1987). Though the five figures could correspond tothe sections of the execration litany, Posener posits the original existence of a sixth for symmetry(1939a, p. 314). The preserved figures contain duplicate copies of all but the first (Nubian) section,which might have been copied on a lost, sixth statuette.751. Vila 1973. p. 631 and 1963, p. 147. With this \"mutilation in production\" compare the argument formagical significance in the use of clay images fired prior to being inscribed, advanced above, p. 158.752. Posener (1940, p. 19) notes that the careful placement of the holes argues against their being the resultof later blows. However, he does not recognize that these could still represent intentional mutilation,and he theorizes instead that they might have been filled with hair, feathers, or knives. Of thesesuggestions, the last (itself a form of intentional mutilation) is the most likely, see below, p. 166.753. See the comments of Osing 1976a, p. 156.754. Versus the suggestion by Vila 1973, p. 638, that the head might be \"the conventional sign\" forcommanding the decapitation of a real prisoner (an Egyptian counterpart to the ring of Herod inWilde's Salome). One would expect that the rite had made use of four originally complete figurines;see n. 750, above, and now Koenig 1990, p. 101.

Lying a further 5cm from this broken pottery was a flint blade, the traditional ceremonial knife for ritualslaughter.758 That the skull derived from a ritual sacrifice cannot be denied, as it was theinitial discovery of a nearby decapitated and disarticulated skeleton which had led to thefind of the execration assemblage.759 Clearly, the head had belonged to the adjacent body,which appeared less buried than discarded. Examination of the fragile remains suggested aNubian origin for the sacrificed individual-a human counterpart to the broken enemyfigurines.760KNIVESThe close correspondence between the destruction of such substitute images and theMirgissa sacrifice is underscored by the design of clay figurines from Giza (Old Kingdom)and Saqqara (late Middle Kingdom) whose rudimentary modeling suggests the depiction of755.

Wb 5: 485-86) for knives dates from Egyptian prehistory, providing the basicEgyptian term for knife (ds, literally \"flint object,\" cf. Wb 5: 486), and thus attaining traditional andsacred status. In the Book of the Dead, for example, it is specifically used against the enemies of thegods; see BD spell 172, Â§S5, in Allen 1974, p. 180: \"(your) nails like knives of flint against the facesof them that do these (things) against thee.\" Similarly, the \"Apophis Book\" stipulates that images ofApep be struck with knives of flint, compare Faulkner 1933, pp. 44-45 and 56 (cols. 22/20-23 and26/4) and 1937b, pp. 168 and 171 (the significance of flint is ignored by Faulkner, who translates only\"knives\"). Flint knives are used as well in the cultic sacrifice of the oryx, like foreign enemies asymbol of Seth (see above, p. 132; see also Rochemonteix et al. 1984-87, p. 77/13-14 and Derchain1962b, pp. 58/7 and 59).

It came forth from Ra to repel his enemies by means of it\" (Derchain1965, pp. 139 and 7* [col. 6/5]).

You cannot come into being, for you are upside down.78 4Nor is the similarity exhausted by the pairing of these punishments, for the netherworldlyAmduat rite reproduces the execration ritual's burning of the severed enemies (substitutingdeceased spirits for wax figurines), and duplicates even the location of the act, withdestruction and burial in sandy pits (h :d) in the desert.78 5 In fact, so closely does theAmduat rite evoke the ceremony at Mirgissa that in essence they are identical, comprisingthe incineration, decapitation, dismemberment, overturning, and burial of enemy figures.Only the form of the victims-not their identities-distinguishes the two rites, withsimulacra (pots or figurines) on earth replaced by spirits in the underworld.78 6 Common toboth is the human corpse, condemned in the netherworld by Horus, and in Mirgissa byHorus' earthly incarnation, the pharaoh.

InPapyrus Jumilhac, Seth is depicted upside down in a pit beneath the throne of Osiris, ademonic counterpart to the human enemies of the royal tombs and the Mirgissa sacrifice(see fig. 15a).790The dependence of underworld tortures upon the execration rite is logical enough, asboth are primarily symbolic performances. Nonetheless, it should not be forgotten that theexecration rite is itself derivative of actual public executions whose capital punishments itre-enacts. Decapitation is already attested in the predynastic Narmer palette, and refer-ences to public incineration are increasingly frequent in later Egyptian history.791 \"Over-turning\" appears in the biography of the Eighteenth Dynasty vizier Rekhmire, who declaresthat he \"caused the liars and thieves(?) to be upside down.\"792 From context, it is unclearwhether this describes a genuine torture or is a derived metaphor paralleling the English787. A vestige of this ritual origin is perhaps to be noted in the description of the divine executioners \"whoperform mrnsw, 34 b, among the enemies of Osiris\"; Hornung 1963, vol. 1, p. 191.Although conventionally translated \"slaughter\" in the religious texts to which it is generally confined,tnmsw means literally \"redness\" (especially in reference to hostile red ink, see Wb 5: 370/2-6) andreadily evokes the ancient ritual of the red vases. As a reference to the magical red ink of this andsimilar rites, tmsw may be the Egyptian term for \"ritual execration\" rather than a rare expression for\"slaughter.\" For related nuances of tmns as \"evil,\" \"crime,\" \"injustice,\" or \"punishment,\" see Lefebvre1949, pp. 74-75; Zandee 1960, pp. 292-93: Goyon 1972, p. 123 (Â§345); and Sander-Hansen 1937, p.58 (1. 133): \"She is not reckoned (to) the Book of tmsw (execration list?).\" Alternatively, Gardiner hassuggested that this writing may serve as the antecedent of the Coptic T&OMC, \"to bury\" (1925, p. 74).788. The site of the ceremony at Mirgissa was in direct view of the occupied fortress, and the rite could thusnot have been performed secretly; see the remarks of Vila 1973, pp. 634-35.789. For the adaptation of the \"royal funerary literature\" from earthly rites, see Wente 1982, pp. 161-79.The apparent relationship of the Amduat ritual with Middle Kingdom practice provides furtherevidence for maintaining the traditional dating of these \"underworld texts\" to the Middle Kingdom orFirst Intermediate Period; for the controversy, see Wente ibid., pp. 175-76 and the rejoinder inHomrnung 1980, p. 9.790.

Performed after the death of the ene-mies, the act of overturning is here of magical and symbolic significance, a \"backfor-mation\" from ritual onto public execution.79 5 At Meroe, ritual and execution may again beconjoined in a political reversal of the earlier Egyptian rite at Mirgissa. Embedded within atemple wall, a defleshed and jawless skull lay behind a mural of bound prisoners, while abronze head severed from a statue of Augustus was buried before the threshold.79 6 Thisreciprocity of imagery between execution and execration finds a distant echo in the praxisof a fifth century Greek magical papyrus which effects a curse by placing a pierced waxfigurine upside down in a pot of water.7 97 At Mirgissa, the interdependence of rite andexecution is expressed concretely-by the corpse of the human sacrifice.793. Amada Stela, 1. 17; see Helck 1955b, p. 1297 and Cerny 1967, pls. 3 and 7; translation in Gardiner1961, p. 199.794. Compare Sethe 1926, pp. 71-72.795. The suggestion of ritual motivation in this act is strengthened both by the fact that the king himself per-formed the execution, and by the mention of the king's having made \"execration figures\" (rs.t) of hisenemies (1. 5, on which see below, p. 187). The passage (11. 16-17) describing the slaying of the chief-tains is grammatically ambiguous, and subject to two interpretations: il.n hm f m ?w.t-ib n itf4 'lmnsm?.n rfp, wr.w 7 m lls ;f ds -sf, \"Joyfully, His majesty came to his father Amon after he had slain the 7chieftains with his own mace\" (sm-.n f as circumstantial), or \"Joyfully, His majesty came to his fatherAmon. With his own mace he slew the 7 chieftains\" (smt.n.fas emphatic). The second interpretationseems preferable, producing a poetic parallel structure (two emphatic clauses) and explaining theseven victims as sacrifices before Amon in Thebes (cf. Breasted 1906, p. 313, though doubted byYoyotte 1980-81, p. 37, n. 29). However, the first translation has been generally adopted, though itremoves the reason for the king's return to Amon and would require that the victims' corpses had beenhung from the royal ship for the entire journey back from Lebanon. As six bodies were subsequentlysuspended from the walls of Thebes and a seventh dispatched to Napata, one might wonder just whatwould have remained to display after such a journey. In fact, reliefs substantiate the display of livingprisoners, probably destined for subsequent execution, suspended from ships in wooden cages (Karnaksecond pylon, reign of Tutankhamun; see Grimm 1987).

Said to derive from the First Dynasty royal tombsat Abydos, the fragmentary Boston statuette is thus to be distinguished from the variousfigurines of the \"prisoner motif' recovered from the temple precinct at that site.80 2Justification for the importance of burial has been based on neither royal nor templesources, however, but on the rubric of Coffin Texts spell 37, a spell for vindication againstpersonal enemies:To be spoken over a figure of the foe made of wax and inscribed with the name ofthat foe on his breast with the bone(?) of a synodontis fish: To be put in the groundin the abode of Osiris (scil.

As aspell against personal enemies, this text should be compared with the \"Apophis Book,\" col. 28/16-18,see below, p. 184. There is no justification for Posener's suggestion (1987, p. 11) that the burial of afigure of wax (rather than of clay) is \"6videmment un usage impropre.\"804. Only the phrase, \"he having departed from(?) his companions upon earth\" (Faulkner 1973, p. 28 = deBuck 1935, pp. 153-54), requires a funerary setting and may be an interpolation. The translation of thephrase is uncertain, however, as most versions have \"laugh at\" rather than \"depart from.\"805. Faulkner 1973, p. 28 (= de Buck 1935, pp. 154-56).

The use of\"etc.\" (hm.t-r?') after the mention of \"foe\" allows for the insertion of the name of theconjured enemy in the curse, and it is this personal enemy whose inscribed figure is buried.If the enemy, though \"among men,\" is also \"in the necropolis,\" it is because the burial ofthe ritual figurine has put him there.806While the act of breaking or piercing has been shown to constitute a ritual \"killing\" ofobjects that they may be associated with the dead, the burial of such objects is an evenmore obvious method for producing this association. Its practice at funerals in all periods ofEgyptian civilization is and was so commonly recognized that any ritual burial necessarilyevoked this funerary context,807 with the dispatching of the buried object to the realm ofthe dead. That this is no less true for human images than for the more commonly offeredfoodstuffs or other grave goods is expressly shown in Coffin Texts spell 103, which isdesigned to send one's own soul from the earth to the underworld and is recited \"over animage of clay(?) ... [The name of] the man is to be placed upon it in the ground.\" 808 In theexecration texts, the same result is produced, albeit with hostile intent.The actual depiction of this result appears in the \"mythological papyri,\" wheredispatched foreign prisoners are bound beneath the throne of Osiris,809 and the essence ofthe ritual is embodied in the netherworld creature Nkiw-nnt, \"The Vanquished One at theStake,\" a god shown as a bound foreign captive whose existence repels evil (see fig.15b).810 The obvious association of this figure with the execration rite is underscored by his806. Such phrases also allow for the possibility that the foe might be a god, demon, or dead man; see thestandard recitation of potentially threatening beings in CT spells 47, 455, 585, etc.807. This seems true even for agricultural rituals of plowing and planting; compare the \"hacking of theearth\" (hbs-t?, Wb 3: 256/1-7) performed at the sowing season for Sokar, god of the dead, discussed inKees 1980, pp. 94-95; Gaballa and Kitchen 1969, pp. 22-23; and Griffiths 1960, pp. 61-62 (construedas the burial of the blood of Seth's confederates).

For morerecent examples and bibliography, see Jordan 1975 and 1985, especially pp. 165-67 for the burial ofthese tablets in older tombs. Jordan, however, fails to understand the reason for the presence of thesetablets in tombs, assuming (pp. 165-66) that they had served the tomb owners as amulets in life andwere buried \"as a treasured possession.\" On the contrary, the tablets found in tombs were deposited asa magical act on the behalf of living individuals well after the original burial, and never belonged tothe tomb owner. The Egyptian element of the spell in the Vigna Codini tablet is discussed in Griffiths1985. For an example from Autun in Burgundy, see Marcillet-Jaubert 1979. The (unrecognized)Egyptian origin of even this text is made manifest in the magical phrase KOMTIe (ibid., p. 185),garbled on the tablet from KOM4Q.C (ibid., p. 186), and deriving from the KOM TO of Crum 1939, p.109a and Cerny 1976, p. 59 < qmr; (p;) t', \"earth creator\" (var.

Egyptian influence on certain defixiones is now denied by Faraone 1985, p. 153, onthe basis of their date (end of the fifth century B.C.). As should be clear, however, Egyptianantecedents long precede even these first Greek texts.833. See Jordan 1985, p. 167.

Demotic examples are published in Hughes 1958 (especially pp. 4-5 for the best discussion of the phe-nomenon); 1968; and 1969.

The spell is directed to various underworld deities (Pluto, Persephone, Adonis, Hermes-Thoth, Anubis,\"the son of Ptah\"), but special prominence is given to the spirit of the dead Antinous. Theidentification of the vEKi6atov 'AvrivoE with Antinous the favorite of Hadrian was first recognizedby du Bourguet (1975, p. 256), though he recanted this position in 1980 (p. 227) following the denialby Kambitsis (1976, p. 217, n. I). Kambitsis prefers to identify this Antinous with an otherwiseunnamed, prematurely deceased Egyptian in whose tomb the assemblage was placed. The originalidentification is correct, however, since I) the placement in graves of letters to deities is an attestedpractice, exemplified by this spell with regard to Pluto et cetera, 2) the divine Antinous was associatedwith the underworld (as an aspect of Osiris) and was himself \"prematurely deceased\" so that he is inproper company with Pluto et al. and is particularly appropriate for these spells, 3) the prematurelydead are distinguished from the more exalted Antinous whom they are to assist, and most importantly4) Antinous is invoked by name, unlike the invariable practice in the PGM where the deceasedrecipient is unnamed so that the spell might be generally applicable. It is just this general characterwhich most clearly distinguishes these spells from the traditional \"letters to the dead.\"181"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICEbe buried in older tombs thus utilizes the traditional mechanism of \"letters to the dead\" toensure the aid of the spirit as an agent or intermediary. The identical placement of earlierstate execration rites in or beside extant private tombs must reflect the same intent.Indications that this is so appear already on the Old Kingdom execration deposits fromGiza, which each bear the name of a private individual, determined by the \"seated noble\"hieroglyph A (Gardiner Sign-list A 50) usually reserved for the revered dead.843 Althoughthese individuals have been considered \"dedicators\" of the deposit or agents associatedwith its delivery, 844 the determinative of their names suggests that they are deceased,845and the \"name\" of one of them is otherwise unattested as a personal name, though it servesas the fundamental title of the blessed dead: t-iqr, \"Excellent Spirit.\"84 6 While no moreverifiable than earlier speculation, the suspicion is nonetheless tempting that theseindividuals should be identified as the intended recipients of the jugs, deceasedintermediaries between earth and the underworld.847The similarity of technique between the \"letters to the dead\" and the state execrationritual extends also to the use of inscribed red bowls and vases.84 8 When used as \"letters,\"these bowls may once have held food offerings for the deceased recipients.84 9 The843.

In no case, however, were these deposits found in tombs of similarly named individuals, and theassociation of certain deposits with any specific tomb is unclear (Abu Bakr and Osing 1973, p. 127).Burial in the graveyard alone would have to serve as the method of contact (as in CT spell 37,discussed above). But see the comments in Junker 1947, pp. 31 and 38. If \"Excellent Spirit\" is only atitle, any tomb would have sufficed for that deposit, paralleling the indiscriminate placement ofdeposits in the Demotic and Greek spells.848.

The use of bowls is a characteristic feature of the \"lettersto the dead,\" and the custom may have spread, under Egyptian influence, to Crete, Palestine, andMesopotamia, serving as the origin of the Aramaic and Mandaean \"incantation bowls\" (see C. H.Gordon 1969). For recent discussion of these incantation bowls, see Naveh and Shaked 1985, pp. 13ff.Like the Egyptian letters, the incantation bowls are often found in cemeteries (ibid., pp. 15-16), butthey are usually found inverted.

In formatand purpose, it is both a \"letter to the dead\" and a \"private execration rite\" directlycomparable to the contemporary Louvre assemblage with its tortured figure. Takentogether, the Louvre and Oxyrhynchus love spells display the same interchange of bowland figurine already noted in the state rite of the Middle Kingdom.Designed as a prisoner, bound, pierced, enclosed, and entombed with the dead, theLouvre figurine may now be seen to derive its \"magical mechanics\" from a purelyEgyptian milieu.852 Its constituent elements have been traced from Egyptian prehistory tothe Christian era, appearing indiscriminately in royal, temple, and private contexts. Theinterdependence of these contexts is particularly striking given the long-standing attempt toisolate private ritual as \"magic.\" With regard to \"execration magic,\" however, any attemptto dissociate private from state and temple technique is clearly suspect. Nor can private ritebe dismissed as \"derivative\" or \"debased.\" On the contrary, the apparent affiliation of thestate rite to the private custom of \"letters to the dead\" necessarily raises the question of thedegree of influence exerted by private custom on public ceremony and challenges therelevance of maintaining strict distinctions between private and public rites.PRIVATE VERSUS STATE MAGICIndeed, the fundamental identity of private and state \"execration magic\" has alreadybeen tacitly recognized by commentators who have explained the significance of the latterby reference to the private Coffin Texts spell 37. The question of private use of theexecration format is even more pertinent in the many finds of small sets of buried figurinesinscribed not with the \"execration formula\" but with individual names.853 Best understoodas the evidence of personal vendettas (and thus the direct ancestors of the Louvre850.

Traditional attempts todistinguish personal magic from state religion must of necessity be frustrated in such casesas these, where practice is identical and only the notion of \"private versus state\" remainsas a distinguishing criterion. Even this criterion becomes unclear in the Egyptian section ofthe official ritual where private and state concerns may overlap,854 and it disappearsentirely in the state ritual of the execration of Apophis, which enjoins the practitioner todestroy not only the image of Apophis and the enemies of pharaoh, but also one's ownpersonal foes:This spell is said over Apep drawn on a new papyrus with fresh ink and placedwithin a coffin ...

Though performed primarily on behalf of the monarch, the execrationcould easily have included personal enemies of the donors among the intermingledEgyptians and foreigners-exactly as is stipulated by the later \"Apophis Book.\"8 56Potential trespassers against the funerary estate of Amenhotep son of Hapu are threatenedwith just such a fate, with their names being added to the list of the condemned in the riteagainst Apep: \"They are for the knife on the day of destruction; Let them be termed Nkiw(\"The Vanquished One,\" a name of Apep).\"857854.

The statuettes had been attributed tothe Predynastic Period on the basis of the crudity of the work (Munro 1972, p. 28, notes that the facesresemble hamsters more than humans), but execration figures of all periods are invariably crude, andworkmanship cannot be used to determine date. Thus Posener (1958, p. 255) speaks of this shoddyworkmanship as \"une vieille tradition, car les figurines d'envoItement sont presque toujours malfaconnees.\" Ironically, these unidentified figures were published together with an obvious prisonerfigurine of a bound female (Kestner Museum 1926.200, also crudely modeled and thus misidentifiedas a foreign product), a prototype of the Roman period Louvre figurine. Like the two parallels citedfrom the British Museum (Munro 1972, p. 29, BM 56914 and 56928), this female figurine is identicalin meaning (if not in modeling) to the \"hamster-faced\" images; it does not represent \"ein ganz anderesMotiv\" (contra Munro 1972, p. 28).

The partially preserved trial records of their failed attempt document theindictment of twenty-eight men and an undetermined number of women, and the executionor enforced suicide of all but five (four of whom were mutilated by the loss of nose andears). They also constitute the only evidence of a trial or accusation for sorcery knownfrom ancient Egypt. Having failed to designate either a \"Great Royal Wife\" or a crownprince, Pharaoh Ramses himself had provided the necessary preconditions for theconspiracy.886 Interestingly, these prerequisites appear to correspond closely to thoseanticipated by the current anthropological model for witchcraft accusations, in which thedetermining factors are social instability and the absence of defined channels of power.887The pertinent sections of the conspiracy records are as follows:885.

Beset byforeign invasion, political instability, and work strikes at home, and the loss of colonial possessionsabroad, the Twentieth Dynasty marks the end of the New Kingdom and the cultural self-satisfactionthat had characterized it. Unlike later European (or American) \"witchcraft\" accusations, however,there seems little reason to doubt the reality of the crime or the veracity of the court proceedings.

A furtherexample may be forthcoming from a notation on Pap.

Massart (1957, p. 183)translates simply \"writing materials.\" That the term can be used simply for \"documents\" is clear fromPap.

Goedicke (1963, p. 78) translated the sentence: \"And it happened because of (the feastof) the Arrival of the God,\" by which he understands the conspiracy to have occurred during the \"Feastof the Valley\" (pp. 81-84). This central feature of Goedicke's historical reconstruction is, however,untenable. A p/i-ntr need have no relation with Amon even in Thebes, is not restricted to major festi-vals but could be done privately, and is not the \"Arrival (of the) God\" but rather \"arriving (to the)God.\"905.

The notion of horizontal depth implicit in the term md.t is herestrengthened by the use of the verb p/h, \"to penetrate.\" Goedicke's translation \"high,\" (1963, pp. 78 and85) is unacceptable and his attempted identification of the site with the high gate of Medinet Habu isthus excluded.

Comparable to a sword,magic was a weapon for the Egyptians,917 and the legality of its usage was dependent uponthe identity of the intended victim. The records of the Harim Conspiracy thus reveal acondemnation of sorcery against the king, not a condemnation of sorcery itself.The truth of this statement is evident from a comparable use of execration technique inseemingly identical circumstances not by the consnirators, but by agents of the king.Evidence for this harim conspiracy is forthcoming from the \"Instructions of Amenemhat I,\"ostensibly dictated by the ghost of that assassinated monarch to his son and co-regent,Sesostris I.

The first of these is \"thedeceased Intefiker,\" whose parents are Intefiker and Satsisobek.920 The elder Intefiker canbe identified,92 1 and was none other than the vizier of the murdered Amenemhat I. That thevizier and his family fell from grace is clear not only from these texts, where all of theirnames are determined by the hieroglyph for \"enemy,\"922 but also by the willful destructionanciently inflicted upon images of the vizier in the Theban tomb belonging to his family.9 23The reason for the suppression of Intefiker is unknown, as is its date. Until recently, it hadbeen assumed that the career of the vizier spanned at least from the tenth year ofAmenemhat I (attested by graffiti from Korosko in Nubia) to the seventeenth year ofSesostris I (suggested by Papyrus Reisner II, dated to year 17 of an unnamed king), aperiod of more than thirty years.924 However, recent analysis suggests that the evidencelinking \"year 17\" to Sesostris I is unsupported, and that the date could refer instead to thereign of Amenemhat 1.925 Thus there is no longer any proof that Intefiker's career survivedthe transition of reigns,92 6 and, consequently, there is every reason to suspect that thedamnatio memoriae inflicted on himself and his son was connected with the purge ofofficials implicated in the successful assassination of Amenemhat.

For the identification of the family, see Posener 1976a, p. 441 and the brief remarks in1987, p. 55.922. Posener 1976a, p. 442 and 1987, p. 55 and pls. 4-5.923. For the destruction of TT 60 (of Senet, mother? of Intefiker the vizier), see Davies, Gardiner, andDavies 1925a, pp. 5 (deliberate burning) and 6-7 (erasure of Intefiker throughout). Contra Gardiner(p. 5), the presence of graffiti from the Eighteenth Dynasty praising the tomb decoration need notimply that the burning took place later than that period. Ancient antiquarians may have been attractedto ruins no less than their modern counterparts; compare the activities of Khaemwese, discussed inGomah 1973. Posener (1976a, p. 441) is suspicious of linking the erasures of Intefiker the vizier withthe mention of his son on the execration plaques. However, both father and son are defamed on theplaques (p. 442), and both could have been involved in the harim conspiracy.924. Posener 1976a, pp. 441-42.925.

The appearance of an erased Intefiker before Sesostris I in TT 60 (Davies, Gardiner, and Davies1925a, p. 13) need not prove that the vizier functioned during the independent reign of that monarch.Of course, the discovery of the vizier's complicity-if such were the case-might not have been madeimmediately, and he could have continued to act as vizier for an unknown length of time.200"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"PRIESTS AND PRACTITIONERSvizier in such a plot was probably not without precedent; Amenemhat I had himself beenthe vizier of the preceding king Nebtawyre Montuhotep, whose fate is unknown.9 2 7Yet another example of a harim conspiracy combated by execration rites appears to berepresented by the famous Berlin red pots, the first discovered exemplars of the genre.Now dated to the reign of Sesostris III or later, the Berlin texts are notable for the presencein the Egyptian section of \"names characteristic of the 12th dynasty royal family\" and\"functionaries of women who seem to be princesses or queens.\"9 2 8 Despite the absence ofdefinite corroborating evidence, the ritual cursing of these deceased(?)929 royal ladies andtheir retainers almost certainly derives from the suppression of a conspiracy originating inthe harim, and the texts have been suggested by van Seters to illustrate the discordant his-torical context decried in the literary \"Admonitions of Ipuwer.\"930 Although the correlationis far from certain, one passage from the \"Admonitions\" is of particular pertinence for thediscussion of the \"Harim Conspiracy\" and the \"private\" use of execration ritual:927.

See above, pp. 141-42, especially n. 627. Following the original edition of Sethe, Wilson (1969c, p.329) translates \"May NN die.\" Whereas the interpretation of Sethe and Wilson construes the texts asthe work of the conspirators (designed to effect a coup), the retranslation \"deceased\" suggests insteadthat they are the product of royal agents (as does the presence of the African, Asiatic, and Libyansections) dictated after the failure of a plot. The very fact that such confusion of authorship is possibleunderscores the fundamental unity of method utilized by conspirator and king alike.930. Van Seters 1964, p. 22 and 1966, p. 120.

Men have ventured to rebel against the uraeus ...\" Although the textsdisplay similar anxieties, these lists of potential enemies are standard at all periods of Egyptianhistory, and it is hazardous to assume a specific relation. The attempt to link both the \"ExecrationTexts\" and the \"Admonitions\" to the Second Intermediate Period is unconvincing, as much of vanSeters' argument depends upon the now-discredited theory of a peaceful absorption of Egypt by theHyksos.201"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICEIndeed, magical spells (!ik?.w) are divulged; oracles (sm.w)9 3 1 and spells of seeking(?)(shn.w)9 32 are made dangerous (snhr) because they are remembered by men.93 3The rare term snh _, 3 , here translated \"made dangerous,\" meansliterally \"to make rough.\"934 As recognized by Gardiner, the editor of the \"Admonitions,\"the word in this passage is susceptible to two quite opposite interpretations, signifyingeither that-by repetition-spells were made \"threatening\" (through uncontrolled usage)or \"frustrated\" (diminished in efficacy by overuse).9 35 After reflection, Gardiner opted forthe latter interpretation.

It was only when magic was used for illegal purposes,as in the case described by the Lee-Rollin papyri, that it became punishable; in suchinstances it was the end, not the means, that incurred the penalties of the law. 947Using identical methods-and identical texts-royal and private magic are heredistinguished exclusively by self interest. Even this distinction grows evanescent onceit is realized that the \"categories\" themselves are only illusory, for there areno truly \"royal\" or \"private\" magical spells in ancient Egypt, only priestly spellsused for royal or private benefit. Of necessity, the ability to compose, copy, or recitesuch spells was limited to the king, the priests, and the scribes who alonecomprised the approximately one percent of the population able to read or write.948 Neitherking nor commoner freely composed written spells or rites; the former did not9 49 andthe latter could not. Rather, as exemplified by the warnings for secrecy quoted above,the composition and preservation of magical incantations (as well as hymns, rituals,and even medical potions) was the prerogative of the \"House of Life,\" -C- (pr- 'nh),946. Contrast the praise given ancient authors in Pap. Chester Beatty 4, vo. 3/9-10, in Gardiner 1935, vol. 1,p. 39: \"They hid their magic from the masses. It is read in their Instructions,\" with the punishmentaccorded to Setna, who \"had no occupation on earth but to unroll the book (of Thoth) and read from itto everyone\" (col. 4/38 in Lichtheim 1980, p. 133).947.

For literacy as a fundamentalrequirement for priesthood in the Late Period, see Sauneron 1962a and Fairman 1958, p. 87, n. d.Sacerdotal authorship of magical texts continues unabated throughout later Egyptian history, contraSadek 1971, who unjustifiably characterizes later magical papyri as \"most often the work of not veryliterate commoners\" (p. 113); for full discussion, see Ritner 1995.949. For the non-scribal role of the literate king, see Baines and Eyre 1983, pp. 77-81. The priestsconcemrned with magical spells on behalf of the king (si md4.t ntr n nb t?.wy, \"scribe of the divine bookof the Lord of the Two Lands\") are discussed in Wessetzky 1984a. The non-royal composition of evensuch \"royal\" texts as the Pyramid Texts is evident from obvious insertions, cf. PT spell 467: \"I have notopposed the king,\" in Faulkner 1969, p. 156 and n. 6 (\"I\" explained as \"the successor to the throne?\").A similar transition from the private to the royal sphere is suggested for the anti-serpent spell inAltenmUller 1979, attested in papyri, on private statuary, and on the curative statue of Ramses III atAlmazah (spell VI); see Drioton 1939 and 1957. In all cases, however, the spell was surely ascriptorium product, and the Almazah statue represents a royal benefaction for public benefit. Anytransition is simply a question of patronage (the hazy distinction between temple and king); neitherauthors nor audience has changed.204"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"PRIESTS AND PRACTITIONERSthe sacred scriptorium attached to temples throughout the country.9 50 Thus, there need belittle surprise that \"spells\" and \"hymns\" so often overlap,9 5 1 since they were composed bythe same sacerdotal group and derive from the same theology. A similar rationale shouldbe held to account for the apparent relationship previously noted between the \"private\"execration ritual of Coffin Texts spell 37 and the \"royal\" execration (and Amduat) texts(above, pp. 168-70 and 173-74). Identical in practice and purpose, such spells sharepriestly authorship as well, differing only in application. In fact, the general limitation onliteracy severely circumscribes the whole notion of \"private magic\" in ancient Egypt.Leaving funerary compositions aside, the \"private\" ownership of magical books was950. The basic study remains Gardiner 1938: \"It is in the -''- that medical and religious books werewritten and it was there that all questions relating to such learned matters were settled\" (p. 159); \"...magical spells intended for the use of the living came within the scope of the House of Life\" (p. 164);\"No doubt the Books of the Dead ... were characteristic products of the House of Life\" (p. 178).

Diodorus Siculus 1933, vol. 1, pp. 172-73 (1.49.3) records that the temple library of the Ramesseum was designated i lruf iottpeiov,\"Healing Place of the Soul.\" The Egyptian temple origin of the Demotic spells and most-if not all-of the PGM collections is discussed at length in Ritner 1995. The bulk of the Demotic and PGM\"grimoires\" probably derives from a single Theban temple archive acquired by Anastasi in the earlynineteenth century (subsequently dispersed through auctions of his collection).953. Aside from the Ramesseum magician's collection (see below, pp. 222ff.), the evidence for such\"borrowings\" all dates from the Late Period. This proprietary attitude toward temple property isindicative of the late, hereditary priesthood which regularly derived its income and status from theexploitation of temple assets. For the phenomenon, compare J. H. Johnson 1986b. Among the magicaltemple papyri appropriated for \"private\" use by priests are the \"Apophis Book\" (Pap. Bremner-Rhind)copied by the god's father and prophet Nesmin (who adapted as well the liturgical \"glorifications\" ofPap. BM 10208 and 10209); the Osirian rituals of Pap. MMA L 23.79.3 modified for the priestImhotep; the rituals against Seth (Schott 1929) which include Pap. Louvre E 3129 belonging to thegod's father Pasherenmin; Pap. BM 10252 adapted for the god's father Pawerem; and the prophylacticPap. BM 10288 also modified for the god's father Pawerem. See Faulkner 1933, pp. 32-34; idem1937a, pp. 10-11; Haikal 1972; Goyon 1969, p. 26, n. 3; Schott 1929, pp. 2-3; and Caminos 1972, pp.205-24. Literate priestly redactors are certainly responsible for the \"private\" adaptation of theoriginally royal protective rites published in Sauneron 1970a. Access to royal ritual papyri would havebeen impossible for \"commoners with little refined knowledge of the current cults and a frequentlyconfused sense of mythology\"; contra Sadek 1971, p. 114. A temple origin is certain for the Metternichstela (copied by the god's father Nestem \"after he had found it removed from the domain of OsirisMnevis\"), and other \"healing statues\"; see Borghouts 1978, p. 71, Â§95 and Jelinkovi-Reymond 1956,pp. 4-6 (for dedicator as chief doorman of the temple of Hor-Khenty-Khety at Athribis) and 132-33(for texts copied from temple rolls, the bL.w R '). For such adaptations, see also n. 855, above. For thequestion of the \"private\" magical practitioner, see below, pp. 211-12 and 220ff.954. Thus the \"Dream Book\" and other magical rolls from the Chester Beatty collection were the propertyof the scribes Amennakhte and Keniherkhepeshef, and the latter copied (though he did not compose)spells against demons and ghosts. It is notable, however, that Pap. Chester Beatty 8 is said to havebeen a temple text: \"This writing was found in the library, (in a) room of the temple\" (col. 4/3); seeGardiner 1935, vol. 1, p. 68 and compare vol. 1, p. 74 (vo. 7/7): \"to be recited by the chief lectorpriest.\" For the ownership of magical texts at Deir el-Medineh, see Gardiner ibid., vol. 1, pp. 8 and 26;fern 1973, pp. 334-36; and Pestman 1982. For the copies of Keniherkhepeshef, see Edwards 1968and Koenig 1981. The attribution of these copies is made certain by distinctive paleography; otherpreserved charms from Deir el-Medineh may be the work of specialized \"magicians\" within thecommunity, and need not have been copied by their intended beneficiary-for example, Pap. Deir el-Medineh 36, published by Sauneron (1970b). Clear evidence of the circulation of magical papyriamong the scribes of Deir el-Medineh is afforded by the dockets on the verso of Pap.

Nevertheless, such influence in no way minimizes the central role of thepriest as redactor of the execration rite in all its various manifestations, which include notonly those intended for \"private\" or \"royal\" benefit, but numerous temple execrationrites957 which entail the destruction of figures for the benefit of the gods and the cosmos:15274, which record the \"giving of spells for extracting poison\"; see vo. 2/1-6, vo. 6/1-3, and possiblyvo. 4/2 (reference to a delivered *r ;-'-si), in Massart 1957, pp. 182-83 and pl. 38 and Kitchen 1983b,pp. 133-34 and 144.

For this term meaning \"magician,\" seebelow, pp. 229-31.

Nor let any man put himself at the disposal of those whoinquire about this nor answer in any way whatsoever. If any person is detectedadhering to this profession, let him be sure that he will be handed over for capitalpunishment ...1013Apparently promulgated only within Egypt, this prohibition of oracles encompassed thesuppression of both the ph-ntr and amuletic decrees which are at once dismissed asnonreligious \"charlatanry\"-despite their accepted role in later Egyptian religion! As inRome itself, the prohibition was unsuccessful, for in 359 an Egyptian oracle (of Bes atAbydos) again troubled Roman authority, prompting Constantius to decree a generalabolition of oracles throughout the empire.1014 Coptic evidence shows that even thisattempt was without success.10o5Nonetheless, official Roman condemnation of these activities did produce a significantchange. What had constituted public religion was now driven underground, becomingexclusively private practice.10 16 Though of priestly origin, all Demotic examples of the phi-ntr (as well as the related Greek a{atcat; and abT6tnro) are for private use only,performed secretly in secluded quarters.10 17 Only now could the practice be termed1012.

Egyptian reaction to the Roman prohibition is epitomized in the second centuryGreek tale of Thessalos, a physician from Asia Minor who traveled to Egypt in search ofsecret botanical cures. 1018 Having befriended priests in Thebes, Thessalos asked them ifanything remained of Egyptian magical power (it i; payuci; vEpyEfa;) to conduct anaudience with the gods or the dead. Although most appeared scandalized (pEp6vtov) bythe question, an old priest agreed to conduct the rite with the aid of a bowl filled withwater. After preparations and fasting, Thessalos was led to a secluded room-perhapswithin a temple'0 19-where in a vision he confronted Aesclepius/Imhotep who answeredhis questions. The techniques of this procedure (bowl,10 20 fasting, seclusion) accordperfectly with those in contemporary \"private\" Demotic (and Greek) papyri. Fear ofRoman punishment for magia may have made the priests wary102 1 and the rite secretive,but the ph-ntr experienced by Thessalos was still administered by an Egyptian priest as aidentification, see J.

The practice may be representedalready in Middle Kingdom statuary that depicts individuals bending over a large vat or bowl-unlessthese figures are to be associated with brewing; see Capart 1944.

He poured spring water into hisbasin, and with his hands created ships and men from wax, and set the men upon the ships and putthem into the basin.\" The Egyptian element in this tale is striking; similar manipulations of model shipsand wax men are recorded of the Egyptian magicians Si-Wsir and Hir s? Pl-wnl, see above, n. 320.1021. Traditionally, the priests' initial shock at the question of Thessalos has been interpreted in light ofRoman prohibitions of magic, which entailed capital punishment for both performer and teacher. J. Z.Smith (1978, p. 179), however, has argued that it is rather an indication of their disbelief in theefficacy of magical power. This reinterpretation is unconvincing, given I) the centrality of hkI. toEgyptian religion even in the latest periods (which would entail priests professing disbelief in thereligion which they serve), 2) the severity of Roman punishment for magic, and 3) the fact thatThessalos was a stranger to the priests, and a foreign Greek stranger at that. The most likelyinterpretation would be that the priests were unwilling to risk capital punishment for imparting secret(and sacred) knowledge to a foreigner who could not be trusted, and who should be excluded fromsuch knowledge in any case.219"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICEreligious rite.1022 Despite imperial sanctions, Egyptian and Roman conceptions of \"magic\"did not merge until the Coptic period when Christian hostility stigmatized all paganpractices-Roman as well as Egyptian-with the derogatory magia. Stripped of its ancienttheological significance, Coptic ?lK was now reduced to the same strictured range ofmeaning.1023THE IDENTITY OF THE MAGICIANThe foregoing analysis of the ph-ntr reveals the intersection of religion and magic notmerely in practice, but in practitioner, for as the priest was the author and compiler ofmagical spells and rites, so he was also the performer and \"magician.\" The role of theEgyptian priest as magician has long been recognized, especially for the , hry-hb.

Contra J. Z. Smith's attempt (1978, pp. 180ff.) to describe the epiphany in the Thessalos tale as areversal of the traditional priestly/temple context in favor of \"temporary sacrality sanctified by amagician's power\" (p. 182). The rite may well have taken place in a temple, and the magicianresponsible for the vision was definitely not Thessalos, but the traditional Egyptian priest trained intraditional temple practice.

Instead, the term isapplied to pagans and heretics: see above, p. 14.

Only as ritual became codified through writing was the inspiredshaman replaced by the literate lector priest, whose office was in turn subjected to bureaucraticreorganization and hierarchical ranking.1025.

Includedamong the last were four female dolls, a Beset03 7 statuette holding snakes, a bronzeuraeus \"entangled in a mass of hair,\" and an ivory herdsman carrying a calf. The exteriorsurface of the box was covered with a white plaster slip, and the figure of a jackal wassketched in black ink atop the lid.Although the excavator did not recognize the significance of the find, a study of thecontents of the papyri revealed the magical nature of the collection, for aside from twoliterary works, the texts are all ritual, magical, or \"medico-magical\" in substance.1038 Theassociated objects are equally at home within the sphere of magical accouterments:1036. In the northern corner of the Ramesseum precinct; for discussion, see Quibell 1898, p. 3 and pls. 2-3.Aside from the papyri, the general contents of the box have received no further serious study.Significant inaccuracies flaw the popular treatment in Brier 1980, pp. 46-50, though the brief summaryby David (1991, pp. 37-39) notes important similarities between these finds and the discovery of aBeset figurine, clappers, and a Bes mask buried in a \"magician's house\" at Kahun.1037. The excavator, unaware of the existence of a female Beset, identified the figure as a dancer wearing amale Bes mask. For Beset, see Bosse-Griffiths 1977. The Ramesseum apotropaic knives and Besetfigure are noted on pp. 102-03, though Bosse-Griffiths follows Quibell in describing the image as anude woman with a mask. The same attribution was given in Wild 1963, pp. 7 9 and 81. Both Wild andBosse-Griffiths note the existence of a single Bes mask, but that does not require that the statuetterepresent a masked figure. Despite a recent attempt to overemphasize ritual masking, the statuette-probably used in healing rituals (Bosse-Griffiths 1977, p. 103)-should be interpreted as the goddessand not as a human impersonator; see below, n. 1041. A statue, like a masked priest(ess), is an imageused as an intermediary or conduit for divine power. A masked statuette is unnecessarily redundant-an image of an image of a deity. Wolinski 1986 and 1987 provides no cogent proof for her ill-conceived assertion that all deities with \"bizarre\" or ill-fitting (to Western sensibilities) heads aremasked priests. Were such \"incongruities\" always to be explained by ritual masking, then the Gizasphinx must represent a lion wearing a human mask, criosphinxes would be lions masked as rams, andHorus-Sobek would be a crocodile wearing the mask of a hawk! For these hybrids, see Merz 1978 andte Velde 1980, especially p. 79. This statuette and a comparable example from Kahun are stillconsidered \"masked\" in David 1991, pp. 37-38.1038.

Brier'sstatement (1980, p. 46) that the discovery of wax sons of Horus in the tomb shaft was \"the first cluethat this was a magician's tomb\" is not credible. In the first place, these wax figures were explicitlyrecognized by the excavator as being of the \"XXllnd dynasty style\" (Quibell 1898, p. 3) and thusintrusive, with no relation to the earlier Middle Kingdom box. In the second place, such figures arestandard burial equipment, and the use of wax in no way implies that they were intended for amagician (see Raven 1983, pp. 14-16).223"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICEamulets (and beads as amulets'l39) for healing and security, apotropaic knives used toprotect infants from demons,1040 statues of protective deities (the uraeus and Beset), andhuman figurines.

Scribal training is equally clear from the presence ofpapyri which would have to be consulted and of pens with which to write amuletic charms.The appearance of state and funerary rituals10 70 among the papyri emphasizes his priestlyaffiliation, while the literary texts have given rise to the suggestion that he \"combined withthe sterner purposes of his profession the function of a local story-teller andentertainer.\"10 71 It is the decoration of the box itself which provides the clearest indicationof the professional identity of the Ramesseum magician, for the painted jackal atop the lidreproduces the hieroglyphic title T, hry-sst, \"He who is over the secrets.\"1072 Perhapsoriginally an epithet of Anubis guarding the Canopic chest of Osiris,1073 the title is applied1066.

It would certainly have posed no professional difficulty, since except for thevery highest ranks, Egyptian priests did not work full time in the temple, but served ingroups or \"phyles\" in rotation.10 78 With four or more such phyles in service, priests wouldhave had fully three quarters of the year off duty, and thus plenty of time for a \"private\"practice. Combining in himself the roles of composer, compiler, and performer, it is thepriest alone who constitutes the \"private\" magician in ancient Egypt.As is evident from the title C4>PXNA (< \"scribe of the House of Life\"), an echo of thisrelationship between priest and magician survived even in Coptic terminology, when thesuppression of pagan cults and clergy had long since recast the magician in the modernstereotype of a secretive, isolated seeker of arcane and forbidden knowledge. Of necessity,the scribal character of the magician remained, and is recognized in the term C2 NPECMOYT6, \"magician scribe.\"l0 79 Further Coptic terms for \"magician\" include the general, XKO1o80 or Pcp PFIK, \"magician\"; 10 81 the descriptive PFCMOYTC (2y 0y MOYTE), \"enchanter\"1074.

One final question remains with regard to the box: why was it buried in a private tomb with papyriwhich were presumably temple property? Two answers may be suggested. Since not a single completemanuscript was recovered from the box, the damaged condition of the papyri (and other objects) mayhave led to their interment, corresponding to the customary burial of damaged sacred utensils, statuary,et cetera. The fragmentary state of the texts was already evident to the excavator; see Quibell 1898, p.3 and Gardiner 1955b, p. 7, who suggests modem damage to account for the absence of complete texts.Alternatively, the Ramesseum box may represent a simple usurpation of temple property for \"private\"use, anticipating the practice of the Late Period; for which see above, n. 953.1078.

Its suggested components are disputed,1094 and those criteria generallyadopted depend primarily upon perceived emotions and attitudes of the practitioner-adding yet another level of subjectivity to a classification already vague. Given the failureof such criteria to delineate an unambiguous sphere of \"magic,\" a new approach wasattempted in which \"activity\" was selected as the diagnostic criterion. Maintaining thetraditional interpretation of magic as unorthodox practice, and selecting the \"rationalcausality\" of the post-\"Enlightenment\" to represent orthodoxy, magic in the modernWestern sense is defined as any activity which seeks to obtain its goals by methods outsidethe simple laws of cause and effect.109 5 Using such a \"working definition,\" theidentification of \"magical\" elements within spells, rituals, literature, and archaeologicalartifacts is relatively simple, and a brief selection of these are surveyed: circumambulation,spitting, licking, swallowing, the use of images, superposition, trampling, binding, the useof red, breaking, the use of sand, burning, numerological symbolism, piercing, reversal,burial, the use of the dead, and oracular consultations.This definition of \"magic\" yields explicit results by accepting certain equally explicitpresuppositions. \"Magic\" is not seen as a universal category of equal applicability acrosstime and space (contra all early anthropology, certain modern theorists of comparativereligion, and most Egyptological treatments). Inherent in the term is the subjectivity ofcultural bias, and thus \"magic\" must be understood with reference to a specific culturalcontext. This working definition openly recognizes and incorporates the Western bias of thepresent scholarly category. Rather than intuit the attitude and bias of the ancient (orforeign) practitioner, this approach openly declares those of the researcher. Thus areproduced results which are useful for description and organization within a specificscholarly framework, but which must not be confused with ancient (or foreign)Christianity. Astratole's remarkable descent into hell was \"magic\"; his equally remarkable ascent wasnot; see Mina 1937, pp. 18-19 and 62-63; Reymond and Barns 1973, pp. 102-03 and 203; and White1926, pp. 102-03 (where Astratole is ultimately cast as a martyr). The capricious nature of theseaccusations was already evident to Celsus in his contemporary critique of early Christian propaganda:\"Is it not a silly sort of argument to reckon by the same works that one man is a god whilst his rivalsare mere 'sorcerers?'\" (Hoffmann 1987, p. 66).1094.

Few would argue that \"verb\" is an invariable,universal concept, that the Egyptian \"verb\" must be analyzed exactly as the English \"verb,\"or that the Egyptian \"verb\" must have been understood similarly by ancient speaker andmodern scholar. The previous sentence would no longer be true were \"magic\" to besubstituted for \"verb.\" Scholarly terminology should be recognized for what it is: imposeddescriptive approximations and not found universal \"truisms.\" In particular, \"magic\" and\"religion\" (like \"verb\") are Latin concepts specifically meaningful within Latin culture, itsderivatives and descendants. They can only represent an artificial framework for studywhen used of alien cultures. 1098The Aristotelian \"urge to classify\" so central (as to be subliminal) in Western thoughtoften obscures the synthetic nature fundamental to all classification. Almost unavoidable isthe resultant tendency to assume that classifications are universally valid \"objects\" to bediscovered rather than artificial (if not arbitrary) tools contrived for descriptive purposes.As a consequence, outmoded classifications are jealously maintained, contrary classifica-tions devised, and new categories are proliferated as ends in themselves.1099 Such has1096. This incongruity of modern and ancient categories is equally notable in discussions of Egyptian botany,zoology, anatomy, and color terminology. Thus the color term wid, conventionally translated \"green,\"included both modern \"blue\" and \"green,\" while dir, \"red\" included shades of \"orange,\" \"yellow,\"\"pink,\" et cetera. The danger of confusing Egyptian with modern categorization in these areas is welldiscussed in Weeks 1979. Mesopotamian color terminology is no less \"culturally specific\" (seeLandsberger 1969).1097. The artificial nature of traditional grammatical terminology is easily documented: the \"adjective\" inCoptic is rather a \"noun\" in an attributive position, \"aorist\" in Egyptian grammar does not have thesame range of meaning as in Greek grammar (from which the term is taken), et cetera. Paralleling theambiguity of the categories \"magic\" and \"religion,\" present grammatical categories are also notmutually exclusive, with such terms as \"nominalized participles,\" \"nominalized adjectives,\" and\"verbal nouns\" (infinitive). Recent attempts to modify terminology produce similarly artificialstructures, see the summarizing remarks in J. H. Johnson 1986a, pp. 401-02.1098. Compare the common designation of American Indian or African \"charged substances\" as\"medicine\"-while comparable materials in Europe or the Near East are designated \"magic.\"1099. See my remarks (1987). A particularly flagrant example of multiplying categories as ends inthemselves can be found in the five divisions offered by Gordon for Sumerian \"proverbs\" (cited inThissen 1984, p. 8). The suggested technical distinctions between \"precept,\" \"maxim,\" \"truism,\"\"adage,\" and \"byword\" are obviously arbitrary formulations since the terms are merely synonyms inEnglish. Their descriptive usefulness for modern study is doubtful, and the terms certainly do notderive from, nor do they reflect, Sumerian thought.238"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"FROM hk> TO QIK: QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION AND DECLINEclearly been the case with many of the modern discussions of \"magic.\" The anthropologicalmisuse of Evans-Pritchard's Zande category of \"witchcraft\" is noted above (pp. 10-12),and the attempted \"discovery\" of this category within Egyptian magic by Borghouts(above, p. 11) displays clearly the inherent weakness of such generalizations, since inEgypt \"witchcraft\" is but a category without content. The cultural strictures on thissubsection of \"magic\" are no less applicable to the concept of \"magic\" as a whole.Though generally abandoned in anthropology, the global approach to magic has notbeen laid to rest. In 1982, sociologist Daniel O'Keefe published Stolen Lightning: TheSocial Theory of Magic, an attempt to present \"a general theory of magic: that means acomplete explanatory account of the whole thing, past and present, all the provinces, ratherthan a single hypothesis.\"100 Dismissing contextual studies as \"too slack to explainanything,\"\"0'l O'Keefe propounds a \"non-deductive\" approach using \"theories asdata.\"1102 The ensuing analysis, synthesis, and generalizations are thus conducted almostentirely within the framework of competing modern Western theoretical interpretations. Ifthe discussions and conclusions thereby engendered say much about these varyingtheoretical approaches, they say very little about actual practice within individual societies.This is particularly evident where the author strives to incorporate Egyptian evidence. Byproclaiming dogmatically that \"magic is, in general, a case of expropriating socialforces,\"1103 and \"symbolism expropriated to protect the self against the social,\" 1104O'Keefe enshrines the Western conception of magic as \"contrary\" activity, antithetical toestablished religion, state, and society. Egyptian institutionalized \"magic\" simply cannot beseen in these terms, and thus the author is forced to devise a special category (\"religiousmagic\") which is only \"magical 'in the weak sense'.\"110 5 By circular argument, O'Keefefinds that established \"religious magic\" is not (by his definition) true \"magic\" since it is notI 100.

O'Keefe declares that \"magic isreal\" precisely because his cultural and theoretical background has utilized the concept,however unsystematically. The title of the work itself betrays this unrecognized culturalbias, for \"stolen lightning\" refers to the Greco-Roman myth of the theft of fire byPrometheus for mankind-for O'Keefe as for Aeschylus (Prometheus Bound) and Shelley(Prometheus Unbound) a symbol of the revolt of the individual against authority. In Egypt,\"magic\" as hk was not a theft but a gift from the gods, and thus \"stolen lightning\" is aninappropriate metaphor, and the implied antithesis of \"state religion\" and \"individualmagic\" is false. As eloquently phrased by Patrick Grim in a review of Stolen Lightning:'Magic,' after all, is a term stemming from our cultural traditions, and is laden withthe particular associations, ambiguities, and overtones of its place within thatcultural tradition. ... [Like 'marriage' and 'political party',] it may be that thenotion of 'magic' does not export well. These terms have an established use athome in our culture, of course, but that is no guarantee that they will be fruitful oreven usable in trying to understand some other culture. What a careful reading ofthe ethnographic data shows, I suggest, is that voodoo and mana and taboo are verydifferent things in their different cultural and historical contexts. ... Perhaps weignore or distort important differences by calling these all 'magic' or by groupingthem all under any one term. Perhaps we will have to learn more about them,1 106. O'Keefe 1983, p. 213. As an example of \"true magic\" in relation to \"religion,\" O'Keefe (following thereligion/magic dichotomy advanced by Budge) calls attention to threats against the gods as religiousrites \"burlesqued, done backwards or otherwise travestied, because magic has its own aims which arealways somewhat illicit and often hostile to religion\" (p. 124). While this description fits the \"BlackMass\" of Christian tradition which was the author's obvious source of inspiration, it is absolutelyinapplicable to Egyptian tradition in which such threats are not \"burlesques of religious rites\" but oftenan integral, legal part of those religious rites! O'Keefe's notions of what should constitute religion,piety, legality, and magic are rigidly circumscribed by Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian values;outside this narrow sphere they have limited or no validity.1107. Compare the extremely oversimplified analysis (merging Marx and Wittfogel) offered by O'Keefe(1983, pp. 366-68), which construes Egyptian religion and magic as govemrnment monopolies designedto be tools of domination by promising the \"magic goal of immortality.\" Sumerian religion and magic,though still government monopolies, are somehow less \"magical\" since \"the Sumerian cities,organized on a religious basis, did not preach the magic goal of immortality as did the magician kingsof Egypt\" (p. 368). This blanket condemnation of \"religious magic\" (O'Keefe's category) provides noinsights into Egyptian (or Sumerian) \"religion\" or \"magic\"; it merely presents the author's ownopinions on the subject of religion and immortality.

Nor is the determination of \"magic\" simplifiedby making the distinction of \"magic versus religion\" contingent upon that of \"magicianversus priest\" and \"magical spell versus ritual recitation or prayer.\" As the present studydemonstrates and as Gutekunst has tacitly recognized, within the Egyptian world viewthere is no distinction between magician and priest, spell and prayer, nor ultimatelybetween religion and magic since a recognized category of \"religion\" did not even exist. Ifreliance upon the \"natural law of causality\" (or any other criteria, for that matter) producesonly a Western interpretation and not a universal definition of magic, it is because \"magic\"is a distinctly Western concept, and a universal definition simply cannot exist. Each \"worldview\" must be examined individually.

Since the same text, ritual activity, and performer were involved regardless ofwhether the ceremony was enacted at regular intervals or when individual need (\"crisis\")arose, the contrast of calendrical and crisis rites proves to be but a distinction without adifference.More fundamental objections can be raised against Silvio Curto's suggestion of atripartite division (derived from anthropological models of civilization stages), in which\"magic\" describes the world view of the primitive hunter and gatherer (pre-First IndustrialRevolution), \"religion\" that of the post-Revolution farmer, and \"neo-magic\" the outmoded,irrational survival of archaic \"magic\" in the \"cultural substratum\" of the post-Revolutionsystem, ready \"to re-emerge whenever advanced culture declines.\"112 1 Though simple, thissystem is clearly unworkable as a descriptive paradigm for Egypt, since the world view ofthe primitive Egyptian hunter (Curto's \"magic\") is largely unknown and unknowable, andwhere survival of this world view may be supposed it is not relegated to an inferior culturalsubstratum, but is fully incorporated in the world view of the \"post-Revolution\" civilization,leaving no distinction between Curto's \"religion\" and \"neo-magic.\"1122 The diachronic\"revolutions\" in thought which his analysis presupposes simply cannot be traced, though thesources for his theory can. The inspiration for Curto's category of \"neo-magic\" is certainlyEgypt's well-known cultural conservatism with its retention of ancient rites, myths, etcetera throughout its documented (\"post-Revolution\") history. There is, however, nojustification for assuming that these \"survivals\" were merely outmoded \"cultural baggage,\"1119.

On the contrary, as is witnessed bythe continuity of execration practice from the Old Kingdom through the Greco-Romanperiods, it seems that traditional religious elements were maintained precisely becausethey did conform or could be assimilated to contemporary thought.Underlying Curto's suggestion that a recrudescence of \"neo-magic\" would accompanythe decline of higher civilization is the oft-repeated but fully unsubstantiated belief that\"magical\" practices increased at the expense of \"religion\" as Egyptian history \"declined\"after the New Kingdom,' 123 culminating in the debased and foreign magic of the Greco-Roman eras.1124 The evidence adduced for this supposed \"increase\" does not, however,1123.

The assumption of \"drearyformalism\" is no more than an unsubstantiated guess to explain the rise of Christianity at the expenseof Egyptian cultic religion. Coptic sources, however, often reveal the devotion of their paganopponents (in hostile terms, of course) even during the period of the Christian triumph, when paganswere frequently converted by the threat of torture or of property seizure; compare the tale of Macariusof Tkou translated in Lexa 1925, vol. 2, pp. 219-22 and that of Macedonius translated in Budge 1977b,p. 961.

In any case, thepopular practice of \"material\" and \"trivial\" magic (as understood by H. I. Bell) continued unabated inthe Coptic period.

The increase in the availability of these constantfeatures is a result of the progressive \"democratization\" of Egyptian religious prerogatives,comparable to the increase in (\"magical\") funerary texts from the restricted royal PyramidTexts to the more common upper-class Coffin Texts to the widely distributed, popular Bookof the Dead, Book of Breathings, et cetera.112 8 The development of new forms of healinggenerally share not only the same mythology with older Egyptian spells, but also the same \"worldview,\" symbolism, purpose, as well as verbal and ritual methodology. In particular, the present studyseeks to demonstrate the direct affiliation of Demotic \"love spells, catching spells,\" and \"spells forharming people\" with traditional execration procedures (see above, Chapter 4). As noted frequentlyabove, the similarity of Demotic spells to the Greek magical papyri most often derives from thecommon use of older Egyptian sources by bilingual Egyptian scribes; see further the extensivediscussion in Ritner 1995.1125.

The development in the New Kingdom of a town-centered bureaucratic and artisan \"middle class\" with disposable income readily provided the marketfor such culturally-desirable goods. Had peasants of previous periods been able to afford such objects,an industry would have certainly developed to provide them.

Being the essence of religion, theycannot grow at the expense of religion. Even the presence of foreign elements in the latestDemotic spells does not constitute an \"alien magic,\" divorced from traditional religion. Thepractice simply continues the syncretistic nature of Egyptian theology, absorbing Nubian,Greek, and Semitic elements1130 as the New Kingdom had assimilated the gods (Baal,Astarte, Reshep, and Huruna) and spells of its neighbors (Cretan and Semitic).1131 Farfrom being stagnant and moribund, late Egyptian religion still assimilated its traditions tocontemporary thought. The clearest expression of this dynamic interaction betweentraditional practice and contemporary thought is found in the Egyptian influence upon thedevelopment of Neoplatonist Theurgy (\"performing the works of god\"), a melding of1129. E.g., the cippi of \"Horus on the Crocodiles,\" noted above, p. 207, n. 956. These amuletic statuettes areinnovations in form only, being part of a continuum of \"healing images\" attested at all periods thatincludes not only other small amulets and figures of faience, clay, wax, wood, metal, or stone, but alsovignettes on papyrus and large scale images of healing \"intermediaries\" depicting a deity (the portableimage of Khonsu in the Bentresh Stela), the divine king (the \"healing statue\" of Ramses III), or theblessed dead (Amenhotep son of Hapu's statue at Thebes, the \"healing statue\" of Djed-hor, etc.), andeven living and dead sacred animals. The underlying rationale for the effectiveness of such figureswas no different than for the cult image in the temple. If that principle is to be called \"magic,\" then\"magic\" was necessarily a constant element in Egyptian religion that cannot be meaningfully said tohave increased or decreased. Even the Amarna period probably does not constitute an exception, sinceit merely substituted one set of numinous imagery for another. Akhenaton's zealous destruction offigures of Amon is a traditional response to the \"magical\" potency of imagery.1130. For Nubian spells, see Pap.

Amoral and quintessentially effective (?h), apower to which gods, men, and all of nature were subject, it was still the same forcewhether used by god, king, priest, private individual, rebel, or foreign enemy, whetherhostile or beneficent, sanctioned or suppressed. As the pre-eminent force through which thecreator engendered and sustained the ordered cosmos, it was necessarily the dynamic\"energy\" which Egyptian religious ritual sought to channel that it might effect its identicalgoal, the preservation of the creator's universe. The cultic manipulation of this \"energy\" byrecitation, substance, and ritual thus constituted a sophisticated system of \"practicaltheology,\"\"33 a \"theurgy\" in which the priest quite literally \"performed the works of god.\"Conforming to the classical anthropological terminology of Arnold van Gennep, Egyptian\"magical\" acts are best understood as the technique of religion, the \"magical mechanics\"of cultic worship.1134These mechanics are sanctioned not merely by practice, but by patron. \"Before dualityyet arose,\" Heka was formed to generate the multiplicity of creation, and the means bywhich he performed this task illuminates not only the methodology of the force of Ihk, butits larger significance in the Egyptian understanding of the nature of the universe as awhole. Heka did not fabricate the universe ex nihilo; rather he reproduced as terrestrial\"doubles\" (kas, k?.w) the acts and logos of the demiurge.' 135 As Nb-k .w, \"Lord ofDoubles,\" the \"magical\" deity Heka thus presides over the dissemination of consecratedimages, the transformation of a numinous primordial unity into a myriad of reflected forms.This \"ka-theology\"' 136 of which Heka is the patron begets the \"imagistic principle\" whichis fundamental to all Egyptian theological speculation on the unity of creation: the1132. Egyptian sacerdotal influence on Theurgy is clearest in lamblichus' De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum; for thetext and translation, see lamblichus 1966. For Theurgy and its distinction from Greco-Roman magiaand yorfotE, see now Luck 1985, pp. 20-23.

See van Gennep 1960, p. 13: \"... religion, whose techniques (ceremonies, rites, services) I callmagic.\"1135. For Heka as the consecrator of the kas of the creator, the Lord of kas with a \"myriad of ka-spirits\" inhis mouth, see CT spells 261 and 648, discussed above, pp. 17 and 23-25.1136.

Evidence from the Old Kingdom reveals that the root meaning of the basic Egyptian word for god issimply \"image\" (Spiegelberg 1930, pp. 120-21). This unity and equality of \"the One and the Many\"renders the question of \"monotheism versus polytheism\" irrelevant to Egyptian thought, a dichotomyas alien as that of \"magic versus religion.\" The ultimate unity of the creator and his creation (whethergods, men, animals, etc.) is expressed succinctly in such divine epithets as \"the one god who madehimself into millions\" (ntr w' ir sw m ihh), attested from the New Kingdom through the Greco-Romaneras; see the discussion and examples in Zandee 1964, pp. 255-56; Assmann 1983, pp. 186-87(especially 186/4) and 188-90 (especially 188/7: \"who came into being alone, who begot himself asmillions\"); and idem 1975, pp. 244 and 566 (no. 105/4 and no. 106/7 = idem 1983, pp. 186/4 and188/7), 290/60 (no. 128), and 293/1 (no. 129); adding Wb Beleg. 3, p. 43 to Wb 3: 153/12: \"who cameas one that he might differentiate himself as millions,\" \"who made himself into millions of gods,created from his limbs.\" Compare also Griffith and Thompson 1904, p. 67 (col. 9/6): \"Every god isyour name.\" See also the \"pantheistic figures\" of divine emissaries discussed in Sauneron 1960 andRitner 1989b, pp. 111-12.1138. The function of sacred animals as images of an indwelling god are well known. Thus the \"Buchis\" bullis literally the \"Embodied ba\" of Re (b:-htr-h.t); for this ancient etymology of the name, see Fairman1934, pp. 38-40. For the lion as the image of the king, see above, n. 573. For wild animals in ritualhunting and sacrifice as images of enemies and demons, see above, p. 160 and n. 743. The process isstated succinctly in Pap. Insinger, col. 24/8: \"Even the small scarab (is great) through its secret image\"([as the sun god Khepri] Lichtheim 1980, p. 204).1139. See Hornung 1973. Morenz's sharp distinction between the deity and images of the deity (1973, pp.318-19, n. 71) reflects modern preoccupation with the category of \"idolatry\" (the worship of \"emptystatues\"), a concept irrelevant to Egyptian notions of consecrated images.1140. For the divine birth of the king and the role of Heka within it, see above, n. 110. The king as image ofHorus is well known and codified in the royal \"Horus name\" (Gardiner 1973, p. 72). For the reigningmonarch's affiliation with the archetypal \"royal ka,\" see L. Bell 1985a; idem 1985b; and Murnane1985. The king as \"living image\" is concretely expressed in the royal name \"The Living Image ofAmon\" borne not only by Tutankhamun (Twt- 'n- 'lmn), but by virtually all reigning Ptolemies afterPtolemy II (Sim- inh-'Irn for Ptolemies III, IV, V, VIII, IX, and XII; var. Snn- nh- Irn for Ptolemy Xand Alexander I); see Gauthier 1916, pp. 245, 263, 275, 307, 346, 366 (but correct Gauthier's iry-M?'.tSnn- 'nht-n-R '-'Irn to fry-M '.t-R' Snn- 'nft-n- 'imn ), and 392.

Indistinguishablefrom this pattern of images is the \"magical\" use of figurines, reliefs, vessels, the dead,animals, plants, et cetera, in funerary cult, execration rite, and medical practice. Ritual actsare no less imagistic, rendering concrete (by encircling, superposition, burning, trampling,etc.) their intangible \"doubles\" (dominion, superiority, victory, etc.). The effectiveness of\"magical\" words and names must be understood within the same continuum, the pictorialcharacter of the Egyptian script (with representational determinatives) adding a furtherbond between the written word and the object which it embodies.1144If the force of hk > is to be understood primarily as the power of effective duplication or\"empowered images,\" then the techniques discussed within this study constitute \"magicalmechanics\" in both the Western and Egyptian sense-though for very different reasons.The use of hk: could hardly be construed in Egyptian terms as \"activity outside the law ofnatural causality\" since hk) is itself the ultimate source of causality, the generative force ofnature. It is the notion of hk, which unites the tenets of Egyptian religion to the techniquesof Egyptian religion.An _ niw fpw1141. Since the king was in theory the chief priest of each temple, he necessarily designated \"represen-tatives\" to enact his role in daily ritual. In light of the thorough methodology of \"designated images\" inEgyptian theology, it is possible that these \"royal substitutions\" should not be considered only politefictions of convenience. Should some reflected aspect of royal divinity be attributed to the liturgicalperformer-at least during the performance of the rite? The \"royal\" attributes of the high priestHerihor are perhaps an elaborate development of such a notion.1142. Compare the ritual \"Songs of Isis and Nephthys\" in Pap. Bremner-Rhind, performed by two purevirgins \"with the hair of their bodies removed, their heads adorned with wigs, tambourines in theirhands, and the names 'Isis' and 'Nephthys' inscribed on their shoulders\" (col. 1/2-4 in Faulkner 1933,p. I and 1936, pp. 121-22). Comparable to the practice with execration figures, the application of thename (Isis, Nephthys) to the figure (priestess) effects the identity. Masks of Anubis and Bes wereused for similar identifications during ritual (Murray 1935-38 and Wild 1963, pp. 78-81). Thesignificance of such masking is distorted beyond reason in Wolinski 1986 and 1987; see above, n.1037. Priestly impersonators of Anubis regularly appear in funerary ceremonies, and are styled simply'Inpw, \"Anubis\" or rnt- 'Inpw, \"Anubis-men\"; see Faulkner 1951, pp. 48-49: ink 'Inpw, \"I am Anubis\"(line 6); Reymond 1973, pp. 120-23 (misunderstood, p. 123, n. 12); and de Cenival 1972b, pp. 18, 33,34, and 57, n. 25.
