People acquainted with the system, which with us in the west bears the name of occultism, during their study of it, run up against the method of operating with figures known under the appelation of theosophical addition.

But all the while it has a deep significance for the man who has come to know the unity of existing things and who has the key thereto, reducing all multiform cycles to the basic facts which govern them. The number connects up with the geometrical form of the symbol -- the number in the symbol pours out into form. They mutually complete and outline each other. To those acquainted with the kabbalah I may give a passing reminder also of the symbolice of letters and of the combined symbolics of words. Word, number, and form, when combined, give a still more perfect symbol. It is not possible for me to dwell in detail on every aspect of symbolism. For the sake of those acquainted with occultism in its different parts, I can only mention the system of the great symbols called \"Tarot?, and the symbols of magic, astrology and alchw, each of which represents a symbolical system, i.e. the path leading to a knowledge of the truth of unity. C But in order to tread this path, its symbolism must not be approached with a ltliteralll understanding and interpreta- tion. As I pointed out, it is necessary I to experience them, discover them, and by delving deep down into yourself to make them your own property3 ghe symbol expressing the laws of the unity of the infinitely multiform has an infjinite multitude of sides or points of view from which to consider it just as an -2 algebraical formula of the roots of quadratic equations may be applied to the solution in numbers of an infinite multitude of problems of the section ruled by the formula. In the case of one man who already possesses all the data for knowledge, the symbol synthesizes him (these data3. In another, it awakens even the processes hidden deep down within him, uncovers them and gives significance and life to them. Symbols, transiiosed into words of our language, and handed down in those words, harden into a Siloment, they tarnish and may give rise to fatal errors in people who do not understand the symbols or understand them literally. Truth gets encased in a shell of error, and to enable the approacher to get near to it a great effort is required on his part."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"What monstrous errors have arisen from the symbols of alchemy, particulhrly of magic, in those people who, literally and onesidedly, without possessing the all-comprehensive knowledge of unity, adopted its symbolst The symbol is a barricade against words, it delves into the thing, taken by itself, and taken in its own reality. A Knowledge of the symbol leaves no room to dispute, it deepens the understanding and does not remain merely theoretical, but presses on to the real result of being able to do, to the result of knowing and being, to the realization of great doing, Pure knowledge is not transferable, and by being expressed in words, is veiled by them, but whoever wishes and is able.to see this veil, will find it transparent. And in this sense it is possible to speak of the symbolism of speech, but it is not everyone who can understand even merely this symbolism. To understand the spoken inner meaning of the thought and its spirit is possible only to a certain stage of development and with an effort on the part of the hearer. In those cases where a person is simply disputing in the ordinary sense of the words, by merely contending for his own opinion, he wastes his time in vain without acquiring anything new. In order to be able to understand speech when it is used symbolically, it is first of all necessary to learn and to be able to listen. In cases of profound knowledge, any attempt at understanding literally is foredoomed to failure, and, at the best, will yield nothing, and less favorably, may lead to error and absurdity. Truth is taken by force and tt is possible to him who uses force to get at it. Necessity compels me to dwell on this SO long because in our conditions of modern culture and education it is in our nature to aspire to scholastical defini.tions, and, without noticing it ourselves, we unconsciously fetter ourselves with our soi-disant desire for accuracy in that sphere, right from the moment when we set foot upon its territory until we reach the centre.

T do not mean by that, that accurate and concrete definitions do not exist; on the contrary, they do exist, and possess in the full sense of the word, the diversity of these qualities, but not just in what and in tha manner we anticipate.

Nobody will ever be able to give him what he has never yet possessed, nobody will be able to perform for him the work which he, and only he himself, can and must perform. All that another can do for him is to jog him on to work, but the work itself he must do. And from this point of view symbolism, rightly received, plays the part of this jog to our knowledge. I have in mind presently to acquaint you briefly with one of these symbols and would therefore wish that all that I have said should assist you to come to an understanding of it in such a way that the explanations I shall broadly OUtlin8 might serve a8 a jog to those who are desirous of penetrating more deeply into a knowledge of the nature of the laws and at the same time help them to synthesize the material I have on different occasions given them here. C I now speak of the basic law of the unit of t.h8 many, the law of the octaves. It has repeatedly been stated that this law is all-comprehensive, that every process in its gradual development, independently of its scale, is fully determined by the law of the construction of the T-toned gamtjt. In other words the T-toned gamut in its structure shows forth all the properties of this law. It has also been said that every completed process is form&d from an elementary phenomenon considered as \"do\", and from a derivative phenomenon -- do of the succeeding octave, higher or lower according as the process is evolutive or involutive. Every note, every tone of the gamut, on another scale, is again in the same way a whole octave, as it were a closed sound cycle. Every interval between two contiguous tones is again a whole"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"-9- octave. Those intervals between Mi.~~ and r8fah11, and between nsi.rr and I'doll, which cannot be bridged ln the process we are considering on their own energy and require in order to pass on outside assistance -- assistance from the outside only -- thereby connect their own process up with other processes. In other words, the law of the octaves conneots all processes of world creation and offers to the initiated the scale by which he can pass on and the law of the structure of the octave, and makes it possible for Mm to know everything and every phenomenon just as they are and in all their reciprocal relations together with the things and phenomena connected with them. And so for the synthesization of all knowledge relating to the law of the structure of the octave, there exists a symbol with the form of a geometrical figure. But before passing on to the description itself of the symbol I shall say a few words about the teaching that utilizes this symbol, and its relation to other systems that have recourse to symbolic methods for handing down knowledge.

Therefore theoretical facts serving as fundamentals and theses in one direction may be explained from the point of view of theses in another direction, and vice versa. That is why the symbols I have touched on today can be applied in explaining the theory of the teaching we have under consideration. c)wing to this property it is possible to form an intermediate direction serving as it were as a middle way between two adjacent directions. And in the absence of a full knowledge of the main dlroctionn such a mlcirllo cnorso cnrl lend only to :L constant chnnrn of the directions and to their confusion and can only lead to complication and errors. And instead of approaching the centre, a man going the intermediate road, gets hopelessly entangled, loiters about, and lTJ.nds no issue.

Two"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"-lO- of the directions resulting from the mixing up of the others, and which are hopelessly involved in consequence of this mlxlng, although they contain particles of the truth they have received but failed to comprehend, are at the present time theosophy and occultism. For this same reason the practice of both of them without complete knowledge leads to disastrous results. It is impossible for me to dwell in greater detail on this extraordinarily interesting question of the different directions and their origin. This question will in due course be made the theme of a separate lecture. I wish to emphasize the fact that the teaching whose theory is now being expounded here by us, is completely alone in its direction, is independent of other directions and unknown by us. We will not go into its theory and origin now. As in the case of other directions, it makes use of the symbolic method and I now intend to acquaint you with one of its symbols. Of course, the superscriptions surrounding the symbol have been translated into expressions that are comprehensible to us* Its general structure, which links it up, in the geometrical figure, with the full ex- pression of the IRW of the octaves, is somewhat more complicated than the structure I am going to set before you, but it fully synthesizes the internal laws of one octave and of the knowledge of the nature of the things considered in itself, - that is to say, existing in isolation, as it were, only as regards its processes and life. This symbol is formed as follows: The circle is divided into five different parts, 6 points connected by a figure which is symmetrical in relation to the diameter passing through the top point of division and the centre of the circle, and which is drawn, as they say, with one stroke of the pen. Furthermore the top point of division is the apex of a regular triangle connecting up the points of division on the complicated figure. This symbol will be met with in the study of occultism either in books or in the oral tradition. Such tremendous significance is attached to it by those who know that it has never at any time or at any place been published or communicated in entirety. But allusions to it are found even in occult literature. For certain reasons I shall not say where, but you may come across such a translation of this vory symbol: Double binary of the ternaries, taken in"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"-11- pairs, giving the quaternary is neutralized into an elongated pentagram by the big Sree ternary. And thlu Is formed as follows: Meanwhile you will never find any explanations on this figure, or on this formula. Nearly all the elements are really available here geometrically: 4 small triangles connected in pairs, the quaternary in the form of the double binary of the ternaries and the big triangle, the free ternary. Only one point of division is here lacking. There are 8 spices, or if we count them outside of the sketch of our figure, we get 5, which are united by the elongated pentagram. Evidently this symbol is sometimes delineated by the septenary which is peculiarly formed, that is to say by a heptagon with a point inside; this is interpreted quite arbitrarily and therefore I will not quote this interpretation, but will only reproduce the figure itself. It is drawn thus Leaving aside all these fragments of a distorted and incomprehensible symbol, we will now proceed to examine it in the form in which I quoted it. I have already said that this is the symbol of the octave. The octave comprises 7 tones and the 8th serves as a repetition of the first. Together with two external shocks to fill up what we will call the Srgaps\"' in the octave, we have before us 9 elements. Having stopped up the second gap in the spiral ascent of the octave, i.e. \"si-dohll, we get in reality what is an already closed cycle, and ipso facto, the ninth element being there to close the cycle, this completes the symbol as a whole. The isolated existence of the thing or phenomenon which is under consida&tion is a closed circle of the process of the change of the life of the thing considered, whcich process is for ever renewing itself and flows on without interruption. It is symbolized by the circle of the figure. The separate points of division of the circle of uninterrupted change symbolizes the successive fundamental steps of the process. The whole symbol in its"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"-12- entirety is Ildo\", is something according to law and which exists whole. It is a circle, a complete cycle, it is th3 \"rlou~~tlt\" 01 our decimal system of numbers, representing by its own outline a closed cycle. It has everything within it self for its own existence. It is isolated from what surrounds it. The sequence of the stages of the process must be bound by the sequence of the cycle of the remaining numbers from 1 to 9. Where are the places of these figures to be? I have already mentioned that the 9th step being forthcoming to fill up the gap -- I'si-do\" it thus completes the cycle, i.e. it closes the circle which begins anew at that point. The top of the ternary closes the binary, its basis, receiving from itself, as a principle, the possibility of manifestation and incarnation in a multitude of forms; in the same way as the apex of the triangle multiplies eternally in the line of its base, and therefore every beginning and completion of the cycle is found at the apex of the triangle, is synthesized at one point in which beginning and end meet, the circle closes, sounding in the uninterrupted flow of the cycle like the two \"do's\" in the octave. But the ninth step closes and again starts the cycle. Therefore in the top point of the triangle corresponding to \"Do\" will be the Figure 9. All the remaining points will be numbered in s . We will get: 1 Let us now proceed to examine the complex fig&e enclosed try to find the law of its structure. To that end I will in the circle and remind you that the laws of unity are reflected in all phenomena. The so-called decimal system of calculation in vogue with us, is in its profoundest principles only very, very imperfectly known to us in the theory of numbers that is built upon the basis of these eternal laws. Taking the ulrit, just as we have dorlc hcra, as the symbol of the existence of the whole octave in one note, we must, in order to secure a passage from one tone of this octave to another, split up the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"-13- unit into 7 parts. I make the reserve that what we understand by the unit shall here in its symbolical meaning correspond to the V1noughtl* of the symbol under consideration. Now, in order to get the distance of any one of the tones from the primary tone, we must take the corresponding number of the seventh part of the unit, &.e. 2/7, 3/&, and so forth. Let us work out all these parts as decimal fractions which are based on the same laws as the whole of our decimal system of reckoning. Here is this series: 0 1 17 0,(1&2,67) : : 0,(28571b) 0,(428571) SL : 0,(571438) 0,(7142&) 1;; 0,(657142) 0,(999999) In contemplating this series you will at once notice, that the period of these fractions, except in the case of the last one, is made up of the same numbers running in a definite sequence, and by knowing the initial number of the period you can immediately re-establish the whole period in full. But if we dispose them in a circle in their natural sequence, after linking them up by a closed broken line, we shsll get, a certain fifiyrs, i.e. if all 9 numbers are arranged in a circle in their natural sequence as we did in the symbol under consideration the closed line of the period of the denomination seven gives us the interior figure of the symbol. According to this figure, by merely taking the direction of its structure as a guide, we shall establish the period in full in every separate instance. The unit llDohll , or seven-sevenths, is symbolized by the one point 9. The numbers 3 and 6 also enter into the period, which in conjunction with the 9 will give the independent triangle - the free ternary of the symbol. I may remark briefly that if we use the theosophical addition, i.e. by taking the sum of the CiDherS of the period, we shall get 9, i.e. a whole unit in correspondence with our symbol, i.e. in each note we shall again find a whole octave, subject within itself to the same laws as the primary octave, of which the tone under consideration is a part.

Its form is pre-determined by the fact that it serves to express the law of the 7 whereon the octave is built. It is septimal relative to the tone aDoh1', i.e. in a certain sense the toneWoh7t may be considered neutrali& ing. When it was a question here of applying the laws of the octave to the structure of chemical elements, every substance derived on the basis of laws was symbolically termed a hydrogen of various graduations of density and other qualities which went to define it as a substance. By the law of the 3, it was built up from active , passive and neutral substances correspondingly termed oxygen, carbon and azote (RF nitrogen), i.e, the following structure was obtained: 0 CN H 3 In the same sense as the tone rlDoh\", through being a resultant, is at the same time a neutralizer of the octave, so, too, the, hydrogen was at the time mentioned as simultaneously being a resultant and a neutralizer, i.e. it was related to nitrogen. The substance of hydrogen is the synthesis, the result of the reciprocal action of three substances: of the active oxygen, the oassive carbon, combined with the neutral nitrogen, that is to say, it is built up according to the law of the triunity. In the same way, too, the tone \"doh\" the apex, marked by the number 9, is in its completion constructed on the same law and constituting the trinngle 9 , 3, 6 binding into one the three dots which do not enter into the period (as we will name the complex geometrical figure within the symbol) ties into one the law of the 7 and of the 3.

But that is not all: by carrying the gap to what seems to be not its own place, it thereby shows to him who knows how to read it, what shock is needed, and when and wherein, to carry from tlsirl to uI30h~~ , which in its turn explains the circumstance already.mentioned in the lecture of the mechanics of the world structure, namely that the transition from rllat' to llsi\" is, from the point of view of the difference in the number of vibrations of the tones, of greater length than all the other transitions in the octave.

The thing is absolutely the same throughout all the processes, If we will proceed to examine the processes of the nourishing and working of the human organism, we shall find in them - as we have more than once mentioned here, these same gaps and shocks.

Three kinds of food are taken in by man* Each of them is the beginning of its own ocatve (lst, 2nd and 3rd Doh.)

The food we take by eating and drinking is introduced into our body in the overwhelming majority of cases in greater quantities than are needed. It cannot be fully assimilated,i.e. the chemical process by which the substance necessary for the maintenance of life is produced in our body, requires the component parts to be in strict correspondence. To elucidate this let us take any example from chemistry. Kitchen salt is the union, in certain circomstancas, of the mincrcil natron with choral gas ( Na ce ). If we take 23 lbs, of natron and 35.8 lbs. chlorine, we shall get exactly 56.5 tbs. household salt, If with the same quantity of chlorine we took 30 lbs. natron, instead of 23# in that case 7 lbs. natron would not amalgamate. In exactly the same way, if we took 1~0 Lbs. of chlorine to 23 lbs. natron, b lbs. of the former would remain free. In both cases there would be 58.5 lbs,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"common salt. In other words natron and chlorine combine in constant conditions as to weight in the proportions of 23: 35.5. All chrtmlcfil alomerlta poanoen thif3 property of proportional constancy, and that property of theirs gave the basis on which their atomic weights were deduced. Similarly, for the production in the organism of a substance which is characterized by definite properties, it is necessary to bring the original substance into strictly definite correspondence with another, with which it centers into reciprocal re-action. This bears on the qualitative as well as the quantitative side of the phenomenon. The food which is taken into man's organism is also converted from the substance produced at the stage of the 3rd *lrnill into the substance at the stage of the 3rd *Ifall with the aid of a chemical admixture from Itdotr of the air. This means that the process of breathing enters into re-action with the process of assimilation and digestion of food. The final substance of this process will be the substance at the state of the 3rd II sill, which in order to pass into the completed rrdo*t requires a fresh shock. AS the scheme we have submitted shows that 3 octaves participate in this process, their influence affects the final. result by defining; its quality, i.e. in the graduated transition from one stage to another, there are everywhere exact determinants. The substance of stage 3 must set out to receive a result known beforehand which defines the requisite quantity and quality of the substance we are considering. This is the reason why any breathing exercises without an accurate knowledge of all the laws will not give the result that is required. But let us even suppose that a man can regulate two of the component parts of the process, two of its determinents - food and breathing. Here again this will not be safficient. It is in such case necess:n-y to know and to be able to regulate the 3rd determinant - the food of the top storey - the first octave, that which we have here agreed to call 11impressions19. Only with a full and harmonious correspondence of all three kinds of food, by strengthening or weakening the different parts of the process do we get the required result. That is why all sorts of breathing and other exercises that are not in strict correspondence with other processes connected with them may inflict irremediable injury on the one doing them. The shock"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"which comes from outside, by the substantial nature of the air in the mechanical process of breathing, and which fills up the gap l*mi-fah\" is similar to the shock that bridges this gap in any other octave. And the very process of the development of the octave within the human body, the transmutation of the \"3rd Doh\" of food over a series of stages into the trDohll of the next octave, is similar to the same processes in other places. When we constructed the first cosmic octave of our already existing world ray (passing through the sun and earth), its separate tones were disposed as follows: Absolute Then this original octave according to the law of All stars Sun All planets Earth the triunity was split up into three subordinate octaves, and this same ray was constructed somewhat differently namely: Organic life &YS Absolute All suns lah sol fah mi re Sun lah sol fah All planets In this way the cosmos resembled by the three- storeyed nature of its structure the same three- storeyed structure of man. Where in the cosmic octaves of the 2nd order, the gap *qfah-milt is placed under the action of all influences that here come together, a process occurs similar to the process of the passage of food in the human organism - by the conversion of the \"Doh\" of one octave into the Doh of the next octave. That is why at these places are outlined the %achines\", in a manner of speaking, that are there, similar to the human body. very roughly the process of transition \"fah-mill may be represented thus: The cosmic llfahll goes into that 'fmachinel' similar to the food of the bottom storey"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"mi r-e Earth and begins the cycle of changes. Consequently, at iLa begJ.mrlrrg It eountl~ irr the michirw PCI *'dohI', the 3rd \"DohI'. The substance of the note \"So11 lah of the cosmic octave, which assists the tone 'lrnilc sol (3rd) within the machine to pass into the tone fah ~~fah\" (Jrd), filling up the interval between them Organic and sounding as \"Doh\" (2nd) serves as the substance life of the earth entering into the middle story similarly to the air mi when breathing. At its own place the cycle of the re tone of cosmic Itlah\", which enters the top storey Doh of the machine as first \"Dohll, joins up with the, so to say doubled cycle which we have not got. In the final sum total of the process rtfah\", which has come into the machine as 3rd Wohl' is converted into the 3rd r*Dohlr an octave higher, and leaves the machine as a tone which is able to pass into the adjacent tona. Before this T said that llfahlt, without changing its tonality, acquires the property of llsol\", and also its ability to pass into the next tone, i.e. into lrmjll in the case now considered, What I meant by this as we see, the machine's food are the cosmic tones IIlahrl \"~01\" tlFahlt, In the order of their sequence, by the law of the triunity lllahl will be the active, llsol\" the neutralizing, and 'Ifah\" the passive principle. The active, re-acting (linking up with the aid of the neutralizing) with the passive gives some result. It has been pointed out at another time that if the number defining the qualities of the active is 'lnu, than the same figure for the passive - lSNlf, and for the result 112n11, i.e. it may be outlined symbolically thus: IJ If, in the places of these magnitudes we substitute the tones that feed the machine we shall get this symbol: wh%ch at the same time shows that tine substance \"fah\" by blending with the substance \"lab\" gives in the result 1~ fc substance '8s01\". but as this process occurs within the octave, which as it"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"L.. were unfolds itself inside the tone fffahu in the manner indicated for lfdohll, when examining the symbol, it may be stated that l'fah\" w3 thout ctrallging its tonality, acquires the properties of l~sol\". We have in a way bean diverted from our original aim of examining the symbol. As a matter of fact, those of us who know how to listen have approached nearer to an understanding of it. As a perfect synthesis it contains in itself all elements of knowledge of the law expressed by it, and out of it may be deduced and developed in detail in the most accurate fashion all that we have just oeen saying. By all I have said today, I have not exhausted even the smallest part of what can be said on the subject. In the future we shall once more return to it and dwell on it in greater detail. I by no means think that I have been able to explain anything, as I did not pursue that aim. My task was to give my listeners a sensation of the task of understanding with which one must approach the search after the laws of truth. Once more I repeat: in order to understand in these matters, constant efforts are necessary. Before closing the Octave, I wish to say a few words on what is termed ltJnitiation\". Initiation is customarily regarded as some act whereby one man \"The Knower\" transfers to another man \"The non-knower )I knowledge and powers hitherto not peculiar to him and without any trouble on his part; assigning it as a thing which becomes his inalienable possession. But from all that has been said by me to-day, you will already be able to understand, that there is no such transfer and can not be. There is only self-initiation, which is got by constant and stubborn work and constant efforts. No one conceals the knowledge of truth. It simply cannot be transferred, just as the finest mathematical ideas cannot be transferred to a man unacquainted with mathematics. And in questions relating to the transfer of a knowledge of Truth, matters are more COi?IpliGated than in the example quoted. You have been able to convince you- selves of this today. It is possible to teach a man mathematics, but an under- standing of the truth he conquers for himself. And woe to man, if under the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"-22- ingluence of the poison of what seems Truth, and striving after npracticalll results wibhvut possessing a perfect understanding and knowledge of what must be done and how to do it, he starts experimenting on himself, often doing himself ' irreparable harm. Harmony is destroyed and it is incomparably better to do nothing at all than to do without possessing the knowledge. What I have just said shows how difficult it is to convert the language of symbols into our own language, how little purpose there is in interpreting the symbol to a man who has not attained to an understanding of it. And however strange it may be, the fact remains that the sense of the symbol, the discovery of its nature, can only be given to, and received by, him who previausly knew already, and for him the symbol will be the synthesis of his knowledge, the same formula for the expression of knowledge as it was to him who constructed it. Mill a man unacquainted with this system of symbols understand a great deal if he is told that the knowledge of unity by the means of self-knowledge and self-perfection for man is the neutralization of the binary by the ternary and ite transmutation into the quaternary in order to close the pentapram and realize the \"Seal of Solomon\", or if I draw thus: But let us suppose tha-t we are talking of the harmonic body, and as the law is everywhere one we apply the stated formula to this development. How can we translate the quoted formula in that relation? What must we substitute in order to decipher it? All sensations, impressions, feelings and thoughts of man are divided into correct and incorrect, necessary ones and useless ones, pleasant and unpleasant, \"Pleasure\" and pain. This is the binary along which all recepts, or impressions, all life of man, travel*"}]
