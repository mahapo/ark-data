C. The tradition is that Orpheus and his followers instituted them. According to other sources they are older still, and were given to the Pelasgian women by the Danaids, initiates from Egypt, subsequently destroyed by the Dorian invaders, and reformed by Orpheus. The account of the Myth of Demeter and Kore follows a sixth century homeric hymn. The following dialogues and scenes take place about 800 B. C. The Achaean kingdoms have vanished. Athens has ceased to be a kingdom: it is an aristocratic Republic. Eleusis has made a treaty with a late king or early archontes of Athens, and has been merged into the Attic state."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE ELEUSINIAN MYTH OF DEMETER AND THE RAPE OF KORE1 ALL-MOTHER Demeter whose hair is blown wherever winds carry the wheat and chaff from swinging swingle to the sound of threshing, whose gold-red cloak unrolls its border by the summer path, wide-breasted, crowned with the holy diadem of wall and towers, Demeter dwelt at peace amongst the gods. One day her daughter Kore descended to earth to meet the Okeanides in the plain of Nysa where they used to play.2 While they danced and sang Zeus watched them and with cunning lie sprinkled the deep grass with flowers, violets and the wild orchid in the green shade, saffron and blue irises behind large boulders, the briar rose on the forest wall.3 The young girls began to pick flowers; Kore, her arms already filled, went far afield, and now she saw a golden daffodil with its multiple bells on a straight stem.4 One, ten, a hundred more. The plant exhaled a sweet hypnotic scent. The Maid knelt down; joy turned to breathless desire and wonder to obsession. Intent on the flower of death, she was seen by the Cronide, Lord of many Names, the Dark One, Spirit of Gravity and Ruler of the Deep. A child of heaven, through forgetfulness, had come too near the radius of his power. The ocean swelled, the earth was rent, infamous vapours veiled the light of day. The ground split open; on his chariot drawn by two immortal steeds Aidoneus halted, framed in smoke and flames. He ravished Kore and carried her away in a fast flight. She cried out loudly to her fattier Zeus but neither god nor men heeded her voice. She struggled hard and lost not hope as long as she could see the mountain chains and the veiled violet sea gyrate below during the infernal journey. Hecate heard her cry, and great Apollo, but ne was busy in his cave receiving the allotted sacrifices. The chariot went down and with it went the sole witness of the scene, the swineherd Eubuleus and his beasts. Swallowed by a crevass Kore saw the light of day no more."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DEMETER heard her child's last desperate cry. She started from her lion-footed bed. She knew her daughter had met with a bad fate; she held her temples in distraction, she tore her head band and she wailed. She wrapped herself in seven darkening veil and descended to earth. Carrying a lighted torch, she wandered for nine days in earthly gloom until she met Hecate who told her that she had heard the cry but did not know who had ravished Kore. Together the goddesses visited all-seeing Apollo, who alone knew that Zeus had promised Kore to Aidoneus, who was Demeter's own brother, for a wife. When Demeter heard this she was angered with the gods. She left her home amongst them and took her cruel sorrow to the cities of men. And no one, for a period, recognized her for she hid her divine beauty well. DURING HER wanderings Demeter came to fragrant Eleusis by the sea, ruled by Celeus from his walled city. On a hot day tasting of dust, cikadas marking endless time, she came within view of the acropolis on the ancient hill. Sadly she sat down to rest by a clear-flowing spring, for she was weary indeed. The towns-people came that far to draw sweet tasting water.5 Demeter leaned in the cool shade of an olive tree, the trembling leaves marked her veil and gown with mottled pattern. She might be taken for a peasant or a palace nurse. Presently came three young girls with copper pitchers;6 they were the king's daughters. Neither of them recognized the stranger. While they drew water they looked curiously at her and one of them spoke to her, surprised to find such an old woman outside the city walls and all alone on a hot day: \"Why are you not in the town, good lady, in a cool shady house where younger women can take care of you?\" While thus addressing her the princess wondered, for she could not make out Demeter's station She seemed poor and humble enough yet there was something grand about her as of royal breeding. It was difficult to know how to address her. Demeter told her story: \"Good day, dear children, may the gods grant you kind husbands and the blessing of children. I am a stranger in this country, maidens, and my name is Dos. I come from Crete. We have been carried off by pirates and with many others I was brought to these shores, as far as Thoricos."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"We anchored there, for many more women were to be brought on board. That evening a feast was held on the shore, near our landing place. During the revelling I fled, hiding in the dark woods. I have been wandering since in search of a home. I do not know your country or your people. Dear children, have pity on me; help me find some work; a house in need of one who knows how to nurse a baby, make the master's couch, look after things and supervise the women\". Hearing this sad tale they felt pity for the aged stranger and one of them replied: \"Good lady, life is often harsh and painful; we must bear what the gods ordain\". 7 The three princesses conferred what to do, and decided to speak to their father. There were the large households of Triptolemus, Diodes, Polyxenus and Eumolpus, also their own, the royal household of Queen Metaneire to consider; one would have to see. They returned to the palace and told Celeus what they had seen and heard. The king listened attentively and at once despatched his daughters back to fetch the stranger, offering her a post as nurse to his small son, the late-born Demophoon, with generous pay. So now Demeter followed the three princesses heading for the palace, walking behind them who were fair as flowers, clad in her black veil. They entered the gate of the royal palace. It was there that Metaneire awaited them, seated on a hunch of the solid slope, holding the baby to her breast. Now Demeter's manner proved in no wise that of a suppliant stranger. As she touched the threshold, surrounded by the curious women of the royal household, the portal and vast hall were flooded with divine clarity. The queen grew pale with fear and, filled with respect, offered her throne to the stranger. But Demeter declined and remained silent, with downcast eyes, until Iambe had placed in front of her an ordinary massive seat of stone, covered with a white fleece. 8 On this Demeter seated herself and covered her head with her veil. For a long time she remained in silent dolour, refusing food and drink, without taking notice of anyone, until the moment when lambe, who was later to become her favourite, began to dance for her; she danced a pantomime of plants and animals and men coming together in the mating season and of the comeliness of sex."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"As lambe swayed and lifted up her skirt, Demeter smiled, and then laughed out aloud. Now Metaneire offered her sweet wine but she declined, saying that it was forbidden her, but asked instead for a mixture to be prepared of flower and water, and a kind of mint. This the honourable Dos accepted in order to found the holy rites. While she drank of it, the women pressed around her and the queen addressed her thus \"Hail, woman, I believe indeed that you were not born of common parents, they surely were of noble birth, for your features betray a dignity and grace such as do those of our just kings. Alas, in spite of our griefs we must bear what the gods ordain; we are mere mortal men and their yoke weighs heavy on us. But now that you have come, all I own is at your disposal. Please consent to bring up this child of mine given me by the inrmortals, this late-born son, unhoped for, object of all my prayers. If you raise him to reach the age of manhood I will reward you generously\". Crowned Demeter replied, \"May the gods accord their gifts to you. I will gladly undertake to nurse your son. I do not think his nurses' imprudence will cause him to suffer a bad fate or corroding ill. I know of an antidote to evil, stronger by far than pierced wood, and of a goodly remedy that drives away the evil fates\". With these words Demeter took the child to her immortal breast and held it close. His mother was glad to see this happen. And Demeter nursed and raised the boy, fine son of prudent Celeus. He grew like a divine being, without taking the human breast and indeed without any sort of ordinary food. Demeter rubbed him with ambrosia and fed him with her divine breath. It was her design to make a god out of the mortal child. It was a marvel to everyone how he grew, resembling a god; and Demeter would have freed him from old age and death but for the folly of Metaneire. IT HAPPENED in this manner: During the night Demeter stirred a fire in the hearth and placed the infant in it, skilfully increasing the heat and duration of this secret treatment. But Metaneire suspected something and hid one night to see what was happening. When she saw her child laid in the glowing hearth, she shrieked aloud with horror:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"My son, the stranger hides you in a great fire and makes me cry and suffer bitterly!\" And the barbarous queen moaned, her knees gave way and she sat down, rocking to and fro, beating her thighs. Demeter turned and faced her with royal wrath. Angry, she took the child out of the fire and placed him away from her, on the stone floor. And she called out: ''I swear by the river Styx by which all the gods swear that I would have made your son into a god! Folly has made you commit the grossest error. I would have given him imperishable privilege. Now he cannot escape the fate of death. After the cycle of years is closed, the sons of Eleusis will fight each other forever, and the only immortality granted him will be that of fame!\" The palace became illuminated with Demeter's presence. Old age left her and she appeared in her true form, scented with summer and exuding light. She passed from room to room. For a long time Metaneire remained speechless without even a thought for her cherished son. His sisters, attracted by his lamentable cries, appeared. One of them took him in her arms, another revived the fire, yet another raised his mother to her feet and led her away. Pressed round the cliild they bathed him who kicked and howled, used to different hands. Demeter returned and spoke once more: \"Let the people of Eleusis build me a temple at the foot of the Acropolis, above the clear-flowing spring, on the summit of the hill. There I will found my mysteries. There you shall pray to me and celebrate them reverently\". AT DAWN, after a night passed in sleepless vigil. Queen Metaneire and her attendants hastened to the king and recounted all that had come to pass. He in turn summoned his people, and a temple was planned and erected according to divine request. Demeter dwelt there, and continued to mourn for her lost child. The years were barren. Oxen ploughed dry ground. Corn would not sprout and barley came up dry and pale like madmen's hair. THIS ZEUS saw and he reflected on the matter. He sent down winged Iris and other gods to placate Demeter, but she refused his gifts and would not listen to their pleadings. Finally Zeus despatched Hermes to Erebos; Argeiphontes of the golden wand. Him he instructed to exhort Hades with gentle speech, and to bring back holy Persephoneia from dark mists into the light, to dwell amongst the gods. And Hermes delayed not;"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"rapidly he plunged from Olympus into deep Borboros. Hermes found Pluto reclining by his listless wife. \"Dark-haired Aidoneus, return Persephoneia or Demeter will destroy mankind; she will not leave her temple on the rocks. Have mercy on the race of men\". Hades looked at his queen, reflecting gravely upon the matter. Finally he aquiesced: \"Go Persephatta, go to your black-veiled mother. But remember that the husband you have in me is not unworthy amongst the immortals. When here with me you will ever reign over all beings that live and move;9 you will be privileged amongst the gods\". When Persephone saw him thus relent she was glad; she changed under his eyes, life came back into her gaze, joy flooded her limbs and she began to dance. But before she departed with Hermes, Pluto gave her the seed of a pomegranate to eat.10 This he did secretly, while glancing furtively about him, his object being to charm Persephone, and bring her back for part of the year, preventing her from staying forever with her mother in the upper region. Then he himself attached the steeds to his golden chariot. Persephone mounted it and at her side, holding the reins and whip with powerful grip. Argeiphontes traversed the subterranean palace. The horses flew obedient to his touch. They drove through sounding caverns and emerged from a grotto by the shore filled with transparent water and with rings and sheaves of reflected light. Neither the sea nor rivers nor grassy vales arrested their immortal flight. Fast they ascended to the hills, cutting through dense white clouds. HERMES STOPPED in front of the fragrant temple where Demeter dwelt. When she perceived her child, Demeter, like a maenad, leaped for joy. They ran towards each other, but even amidst the joy of mutual greetings Demeter thought of something and she enquired anxiously: \"My child, tell me the truth. Have you accepted food or drink before leaving Hades? If you have not, you could live henceforth with me and your immortal Father\". \"Mother\", replied Kore. \"by using ruse and force my husband made me eat the ripe seed of a pomegranate. I am his willing wife and he has power over me\". And she related to her mother the story of her rape and of the life below, and how she had parted from her dark-haired husband."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"Since you have eaten of the cursed seed\", said Demeter, \"you must annually return to the Land of Shades, but for two parts of the year you shall be with me and the other immortals. When the earth turns green and fragrant with flowers, you shall ascend from the dark mists, a marvel to both gods and men\". Mother and daughter passed the rest of the day in each other's company, united in heart and mind, giving and receiving a thousand tokens of mutual love, and now at last tlieir hearts ceased to ache. Later Hecate joined them; she who precedes and follows Persephone in the mysteries, and she gave to the goddess many signs of her attachment. The storm god gave his assent to Persephone's annual return-He sent down Rhea to summon Demeter to heaven, and the shining goddess descended to the plain of Rharia to meet her daughter there. Demeter obeyed the decrees of the highest god. Now in the barren plain she made the corn sprout, made leaves and blossoms grow, and soon fat furrows filled with greeneared corn. She instructed the just kings, Triptolemus, Diodes, the Master of the Carriage, powerful Eumolpus and Celeus, chief of the people. She taught them the accomplishment of her sacred mysteries, and revealed to them the lovely rites, the royal rites impossible to divulge, to penetrate or to transgress. Blessed those amongst mortal men who have been initiated in these mysteries! Those who have not taken part in the holy rites do not have the same fate, not even in Hades. As an expression and an outer symbol, and as the basis for her work she gave the Greeks knowledge of the culture of the soil. Soon noble-ordered grain swelled the plain of Rharia like gentle breath, the ears of corn moved in measure like a choir of dancers, rare poppy flashed, like grace, in the wide field. The hills of Attica were terraced and planted with vine, and in the orchards ripened heavy fruit. After having established these mysteries, the goddess joined the other gods in high Olympus. There the two deities remained with Zeus of the thunderbolt. Blessed him whom they deign to love: to his mansion they send Pluto, giver of true wealth. NOBLE DEO of fragrant Eleusis, and Paros girded by the waves, and rocky Antron, you who bestows the gifts of the seasons, and you, beauteous Persephone, grant me a life according to my heart's desire. Let me remember you with other songs."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE LESSER MYSTERIES I DISCOURSE of a mystagogue on the eve of the Small Eleusinian Festival held. at Agra on the Ilisus, outside Athens. End of February. He is addressing older mustai and new neophytes at Athens. FRIENDS new and old, we have come together this day so as to clear our minds, and see the meaning of tomorrow's rites. Those amongst you who have been initiated in previous years will know what is meant, but will do well to recollect themselves tonight, and to refresh their memories. Those who are here for the first time should try and reflect in their own minds: What is it that you want? How does your aim and the experiences that brought you here to our sacred telete relate to the rites of spring? Did not, while you unquestioningly belonged to the circle of again­becoming, the coming of the deity mean plentiful crops, the fertile heifer in your stable, a god glowing in the grape, in the lust, too, that tightens limbs like sails, known with your husband, lover, wife or slave, and only that? You may have known these things, and they are good; good as the cloudy blossoms, spawning fish, the nesting birds. And yet, the earth is full of ills, and ills the sea.1 You have found life wanting, you have come. Could not your feelings and your intimations, different from each to each, yet be likened to a breath of spring? You have been dead; and now new life has begun to stir. The god in you was absent. We herald his coming. You were asleep like seed in wintry soil; obscure longing born of divine discontent has come to your dreams. Like Kore you had fallen into generation. Like Persephone of the lulled eyes you lived below, in bondage, amongst your herds and houses, children, goods."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Like Demeter great Love has mourned for you. Now Light is kindled in the darkness. The Wisdom of the gods, like Hermes of the golden wand, has come to rescue, and conducts you during our ascent. Does the past life lie behind you like a barren dream? Or have you always known, and loved, and waited in the dark? Have you come here for grief and loss, satiety, a questing mind, for expiation of a burdening wrong? From the passion of hot youth or the disillusion of age, fear of death or any of the gnawing hungers? Has the god claimed you as his own; do you, like Ariadne, wait for the true Love? Or have you, like Semele, known the fertilizing flash of divine lightening, death rehearsed?2 There are these and other motives for return. You have begun to die, and we teach you to die and be reborn. Tomorrow, by the banks of the Ilisus, take in the beauty of the world, the detail and the Whole; remember, try to apprehend how behind nature of the seven veils Mind remains stable, ancient and unchanged. In generation, Chronos' realm, place is always and only place, and time is always and only time. This and individuation is the cause of ill. The universe, the world in time and place are the imperfect image of the One. The God whose garment is the sensible world is free of time and its conditions. Him we shall celebrate with our epoptic hymns. Each blade of grass, each furry beast, the sprouting shoot upon the tree, to seeing eyes shines with the fulgent light of Dionysos. Those manifold changes that he suffers into winds and water and earth and stars and the birth of plants and animals are called Disappearances and New Births and the song sung to him is full of sufferings and wanderings, but also of great joy in another Birth.3 Now I want you to understand that near the Metroon of Demeter, during the festival of spring, we abstrain from mourning;4 we do not mourn our losses nor bewail our infirmities. Come to the holy place without your woes and your desires. You then may feed on Greater Life; you may perceive the way we lead.

AGRA. A kurotrophos — one who teaches the young — is talking to a visiting priestess of the bearded Aphrodite of Perga. She is a short muscular woman with fleshy features and a neck that juts forward from rounded shoulders. She has an air of concentrated vitality and alertness. Doric Pamphilia, of which Perga is the capital, is her home. That part of southern Asia Minor is still cut off from the other Greek colonies, and Perga a stronghold of Asian religious tradition. The priestess is of Hittite race; she knows the dialect of Pamphilia and has learnt Greek; she has become discontented with the formalized traditions of a crumbling empire. She has sailed down the Cestus, and, passing through Cyprus, has come to Greece. Kurotr: What you have told me, noble Mezulla, of your cities and sanctuaries south of the Taurus ridge is of great import. The founders of the Mysteries had much contact with Egypt and Phoenicia, especially in the past, but our knowledge of the Eastern empire, in spite of Phrygian conquests, has been restricted. It will be pleasing to the gods that you have mastered Greek, and that the winds and Fates have brought you here. Let me now, since this is your earnest desire, speak of the Mysteries of Agra. They are most venerable, like your own, though not as ancient. Therefore the sap of life still courses in them lustily. Orpheus founded them, the Thracian Bard, in order to effect purification from a bloody deed. Of our hero Hercules you know.2 Mezulla: By Tesup, the pyres with his effigies burn annually on our coast. The peoples of the south call him Baal, or Sandon, and it is said in our land that he gained initiation from our priests. Near the Pontic confines of our empire he won the double-headed axe from them.3"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Kurotr: The emblem of the Heraclydae. And what it signifies we know. Now, as you saw, the sanctuaries on the Ilisus; founded to purify Heracles, who was not Greek and could not be admitted to Eleusis, belong to Kore and the Mother, to Artemis Agrotera, the Huntress; chaste Artemis who hunts down the wild beast out in the hills and in the breast, who delivers from mad passions, who purifies and hits the mark, she who directs the choir of the Muses, the same that you and past generations of Melissai have served.4 At Agra she shares honours with anotlier: Telepinu, if I remember rightly, you have called him. Mezulla: The Divine Son of Tesup. Kurotr: Zeus. We call him Dionysos; Zagreus is his Asian name with us, and it signifies great Hunter — of darkness and barbarous ignorance. The Divine Incarnation of immortal creed. Together the great gods ensure fertility. Medulla: And so with us, in the heroic past. Kurotr: Now in the month of Anthesterion we celebrate the annual preliminary initiation here. The visitors, our neophytes and the Athenian people, come down from Athens and pitch their tents in the sacred grounds. This to remind them of a barbarous state before the goddess gave us agriculture. We take the throng down to the river and there asperse them with the sacred water. Public lustrations are for all to see, and are a rite. The inner meaning is expounded to the neophytes, and are, for them, a preparation. 5 They then receive instruction on the meaning of true poverty, and are sworn into lifelong silence. Our mystagogues perform the sacred dance with clashing bronze,6 like the great planetary gods revolving round the human soul from birth. The immortals themselves initiate the mystae, in truth revolv­ing round him day and night, as sun and stars. And God supreme, is he not the great coryphaeus of the universe?7 He is not telling anything. This is philosophy. Orpheus brought us these from Thracian Samos, and there, if you were initiated, is a choregie and play.8"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Mezulla: The dances have been known in our cult. Kurotr: And to the Phrygians after you. Have they not come from Media and Baktria, and beyond? — so Dionysos said, the roaring god whose servitude is sweet.9 A pause. The two remain in deep thought. Kurotr: With these and similar ceremonies we speak to the new neophytes, Athenians mostly,10 seldom strangers who have come to settle here, or who inhabit other parts of Greece. And speech we use but sparingly at our Mysteries of Spring. But it so happens that people who have never heard of truth and have reflected little, find their minds are opened; such is the action of the Divine on the sleeping soul. A pause. Sometimes, within the sacred precinct, the god comes in a dream. We use the juice of poppy and essence of mint. Mezulla: Across our northern ranges, so I leamt, lie fields of a black poppy on a table land. The Idaean priests distil the juice from them.11 The poppy is the sacred flower of the Mother. Kurotr: Only Demeter knows of its right use. Mezulla: Most true, I have seen it abused in Eastern ports. Kurotr: Well, you will understand that what we show with rite and song, is a first introduction into a cycle of ideas. We chose our people, and during the six months that divide from the Great Eleusinians, we give oral instruction to our neophytes — here for artists at the temple of the Ilissidian Muses — at Athens, and in Eleusis. We teach the knowledge of the self, gnome, the power of right decision, cosmology, arithmetic, astronomy, the sciences, medicine and the crafts and their right use in daily life; other things too ,according to the needs that rise from year to year.

One day in early summer. Kerykes: I have asked you, Poimander, to come and visit us so soon in the year in order to discuss the coming Dromena. Have you thought about it yet? Have you begun to work on it? Poimander: I have thought much, Hermippus, but have written nothing. We spoke about it at Lysander's house. We agreed that the myth has a triple meaning: that the descent of Kore symbolizes the fall of the soul into generation and multiplicity, descent into a netherworld at physical death, and the way as taught in the Mysteries: the craft of dying practised in this life. We have not decided which, if any one, of these meanings we should stress in the coming Dromena. Kerykes: Good. Whichever you choose — unless you wish simply to represent the Rape of Kore as laid down in the sacred hymns — abide by it and do not mix the lines of thought. One interpretation, if rightly put, implies the others. It will be pleasing to the goddess if you do something different from the Dromena four years ago, when we enacted Her myth, with dances. A pause. Do you think you could divide the chorus to show the parallel between bodily death and death in initiation? Poimander (reflects). It could be done, but not by me. Two choruses are difficult to handle and have never been tried. Kerykes: Do as you deem best. Poimander: I have some notes on the theme of Royal Initiation. It is very high, very far from where I am; these are only thoughts on what we have heard.

He who has been made whole, and known the flight of the alone to the Alone, can still fall back, then reascend. 3 Things recorded of the Royal Initiate, of his Birth and Growth and the true doctrine, and greater magistrature; how, gods and divine men having chosen Him, He acceded to great command­ment, and how He established Himself, and how a conjuration arose against Him and until what point it succeeded, though not finally; these things are worthy of being remembered and have been told. They have been told of holy Osiris;4 we could tell a similar tale. Kerykes (reflects). Very beautiful. But not this year. There are many new neophytes, from Boeotia too, and the islands.

After a few days of festive preparation inT Athens the procession of mustai start for Eleusis in the forenoon. The sacrificial pigs and travelling bags have been sent ahead. The statue of lacchos is to follow. The pilgrims carry as yet no sacred objects, but bread and goat cheese for the day. They leave the city along the paved sacred road that crosses the Cesiphus bridge, the plain and wooded outskirts of Athens and climbs the height to the Aigaelaos pass flanked on both sides by ancestral graves. Early in the day the procession reaches the bridge that spans the Cesiphus. It is here that, following an ancient custom, the participants make fun of each other's weaknesses and bad features, and this they do with gusto, giving full scope to their quick Attic wit. The theory has been put forward that Athenian comedy had its origin here. The people approach the bridge with mirthful expectation, some apprehension too. As they draw near jibes and laughter begin to fly about and loosen the ranks. The wife of a senior Kerykes, who has been in Athens to visit a friend and is returning this way, mounted on a mule, leaves the procession and stations herself near the bridge head. She is well known for her caustic gift of observation and quick tongue. A Thracian by birth, she has the high cheekbones and pale grey eyes of the North, a homely figure and a commanding presence. Her deep-set eyes wander with amusment over the known faces. They come to rest on the wife of an Athenian aristocrat, a wealthy member of the Areopagus, a tall slim woman with hooded eyes and a proud mouth. She walks near the head of the procession. \"Room, room for Galaxoroe!\" the priestess cries, giving her mule a spur so that it starts. \"Slaves, where is her barge, eh, clear the landingplace\".

She has been brought up on her father's estate and there has known her equals only, and the humble farmers that worked the fields for him. She has married a steady, unexciting noble. Citizens of every rank come to Eleusis, and she had not liked mixing with them when she first came. Occasionally she is still visited by dreams and aspirations of mythical grandeur and eminence that find no scope in small Athens, and certainly none in the strict discipline of Eleusis. But now the priestess has spotted a fine girl with the tight glowing skin of youth and a big, graceful body. With her almond shaped dark eyes and secret smile she is the living image of the Maid. She does not look her best today, sweating and with untidy hair bound at the top of her head. Always looking for appraisal she knows what is coming to her and tries to behave unconcerned. With an exaggerated gesture the priestess throws up her arms, places one elbow in a cupped hand and her chin in the other; a frequent attitude of the girl who tries to hide a slightly receding chin in this manner. \"Kallimache\", she mimics her, \"Help with the washing? But there is my dancing lesson to attend, and I want to go to the beach. Oriander says I have improved my carriage, every one looked at me as I crossed the agora yesterday, like a caryatid he says. I must have that Tyrian linen; father really might give it me, instead of buying another dreary piece of land\". The girl reddens under her tan, the neighbours giggle and a young man shouts: \"Better be noticed, beauteous Kallimache, than to be ignored. That never happens to you, eh?\" And he makes his way to her side with protective male arrogance. He has Ionian blood, and looks and is a promiscuous young man, attracted to the girl and to many others. The priestess knows his cockiness but for the moment leaves him alone, since an impulse mixed of sex and kindness brought him to the girl's side; she rides to the end of the line where shouts and laughter soon betray her presence."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Then she returns: \"O Hernander, stiff in the buttocks, turkey-cock!\" And she blows herself up and hollers like a turkey. The youth flashes angry dark eves at her but she laughs good-naturedly and taps a passing youth on the shoulder: \"Come on you, carry on now, go on, do it\". But he is too shy. Instead a short stocky man with blunt features leaves the ranks. He whisks out a tear jar and steals up behind a young woman who tends to make up situations. Just now she fancies herself in love with the husband of a friend. The man, who looks like, and is called Silenus in jest, silently thrusts the jar under her nose and saunters off. She looks startled. But already he has spotted another victim. Me snatches off his pointed travel hat with a wide brim that shades the eyes and is turned up at the back and, bowing abjectly, like a beggar, he runs alongside a citizen who is known to be tight-fisted. \"A coin for Hermes, one coin only\", he chants in a whining voice. And in his ordinary manner: \"Can you bear it, does it pain you badly?\" The others, entering the game, clutch at their satchel with a pained expression; and Silenus: \"Come, act it\". The citizen: \"But I always...\". A Chorus: \"Give plenty at the temple and for the poor\". The citizen decides then and there to increase his donation to Eleusis. What he does not know is that it will not be accepted, since it will be done to be seen of men. He has a lot to learn, but he will. Silenus has spotted a small corpulent woman with a pitiful expression. \"No, I am not enjoying myself, how could I enjoy myself like other people. I feel miserable, things are different for me\". After some more of this, instead of laughing, the woman's face puckers and she begins to cry. She is hard of hearing and in poor health. The teachers try to wean her from self-pity. Instantly the others surround her and Silenus hugs her: he has given her more than she can take. Another older woman gets off her mule, and they seat her on it. Silenus pats it on the buttocks: \"There, there\". The kindness and attention has restored her and she is glad to ride. Trot, trot, the animal takes her along the paved road. Silenus looks along the ranks once more. \"Ah, there he is, and she right beside him\". He reaches into his pocket and makes for a couple. He sidles up to the man."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"\"How about a visit to the slave market, Colonus. Too busy, eh, with the ware houses and affairs of State\". And in a stage whisper, with hunched shoulders he mimics a Phoenician merchant: \"Leetle Nubian girls, only twelve years old\". He brandishes some tablets with satirical drawings but quickly hides them. The girls round the two look away, people laugh and the man, who tends to pomposity, looks interested. Now Silenus brings out a phallic amulet and dangles it before his eyes, then gallops off, laughing like a goat. This scene was aimed at the wife of Colonus, who has eyed it with dark suspicious eyes. Her nose is too long and she is gaunt, with fine eyes. She has followed her husband, seeking initiation more out of a somewhat mean sexual jealousy than other reasons. This the teachers know, but they also know that underneath her sharp nosed irritation is genuine affection for her husband and a sensitive emotional nature. An elderly neighbour who knows her jealousy better than she does herself, chaffs her: \"Look out, august Hera of the snowy arms, do not let them get away with it\". She is about to reply sharply when she thinks the better of it; one must not show anger at Cesiphos. \"Just wait, I will give her a piece of my mind back in Athens\". But now the bridge has been left behind. Hilarity subsides, Silenus is seen talking earnestly to a man at the end of the line who has not been ragged. The procession crosses the plain which is partly wooded and partly cultivated, and from the farms situated in the fields come husbandmen, their women and their children with offerings of grapes and figs, and with gourds of water mixed with wine or honey. At midday the procession halts where the road begins to rise, to rest and feed under some ancient pines that exude freshness even in the midday heat. Fern and heather grow beside the mastic bushes. The animals are left to graze and drink from a way-side trough. After a rest and sleep of some of the older people, the pilgrims set out again, for the pass is still well ahead of them. The hillside resounds with solemn hymns and prayers. Silenus plays a flute, and distant shepherds answer his in a dialogue of question and answer, and these are old Arcadian melodies. Some girls have made garlands of flowers, vine leaves and grapes plucked from the wayside."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Now Silenus discards his hat and staff, his cloak and peplum. Almost naked, hairy and shining like red glazed clay, he really looks like a satyr emerged from the woods. A cymbal starts the rhythm for a slow dance. Silenus passes his flute to a youth who takes up the tune and he begins to dance ahead of the procession. He seems a sylvan disciple of Bacchus, carrying out some simple steps with intricate variations, expressing reverence, a search, and joy. The people watch him. quietly. Later, the olive trees cast marked shadows east, the bees are fewer, freshness meets them from the heights. And as the shadows overtake them, the pilgrims reach the pass, and on the other side lies Eleusis across the bay of Salamis. As they descend a slow winding road a mild still night begins to fall. When they finally reach the shore at the foot of the hill, the procession stops for a last rest; many people discard their clothes and are wading into the shallow water. At some distance from the shore where it is still shallow enough to stand, deep enough to swim: Kallimache: It is good that it should be dark. So many men. Older woman: Better for me than for you, my dear. Third woman: Never too tired or too dirty to be thinking of Them, eh? Fourth woman: We should remember the meaning of this rite. Older woman: Come, come Melissa, we do remember, no need to be preaching. Besides the day of purification is tomorrow.2 A silent girl swims out with fast strokes. Lies on her back and looks at the immense and starry sky oned with the dark diaphanous sea which is deep green, almost black; on the curving beach she has seen how it unrolls a fine border of foam, as from a woman's garment. The girl feels the water on her naked skin. She is a conscious part of the Whole, and it is infinite, and beyond speech or thought. This is ecstasy. Wrapped in the living cloak of the Divinity she prays: \"Heavenly Aphrodite, great Urania, whose spangled cloak unfurls a gleaming hem with gentle rhythm, unfold me . . .\"."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE MAJOR MYSTERIES III FOR FOUR days the mustai have stayed at Eleusis, have bathed and fasted, offered their sacrificial pigs and played strenuous competitive games.

Kerykes: Not yet. The dusk of Salamis awaits another light. Let us go down the sacred way and meet the god. The mustai fall into rows of two and two and, always watching the pass, slowly descend to the shore. The mediterranean sky deepens and now, over the mountain ridge appears a pinpoint of light. The epheboi with the statue have come within sight of Eleusis. Their distant chant is faintly heard. The light is that of a single torch carried ahead of the god. Absorbed, the mustai watch the light advance. Melissa: The first-born Star of Night: In a flash she sees many things together. Kerykes: Star form the East. Hail Iacchos! Hail the Light!

They are wearing their usual clothes and over them the skins of animals, mostly of fawn or goat to protect them from the cold.1 Each carries a small cushion to sit on. The people are in a state of deep religious emotion and mental alertness induced by the impressions and experiences of the past few days; by a catharsis of mind, feeling and the bodily system, and by a drug used at Eleusis. A housewife, shivering a little, in a low voice to her neighbour: Did they give you the mixture to drink? A Physician: Yes, as soon as we awoke, it was stronger than on previous days.

An ephebe pyrophoros enters carrying a lighted torch with which he kindles torches held aloft by two epheboi dressed in black and white peplums respectively, facing each other across the scene of action. The light reveals the following scene: In the centre of the paved space which fronts the steps and temple wall, on what seems a couch or bier covered with furs and linen clothes lies a woman in an attitude of sleep or death. She wears festive clothes and elaborate gold jewels; her hair is curled and banded; at her head are placed a bowl and a jug of clay. The action of the Dromena is played in a highly stylized manner. The protagonists move as figures on a frieze or in a sacred dance. The chorus alternatively speaks or chants for them, as the text requires. Chorus: Mountainous homeland, veined great-breasted sea; the coast, a shining sodden floor where Thetis' stallions race with unbound manes. Islands that draw our pentecosters of the curved prow.2 The hamlet in the wood, white smoke rising in a straight line from homely hearth. The cool, serrated panoply of shade, ripe gourd out in the field. And bees intent on the erect corolla. The winds of Greece on the warm stone fashioned by Ge, or made noble by man. Stem rocky home of kings, ringed round with lake and marsh, Or girded city, work of Erechtheus: Agora, temple, alcove, laughter, tears. Exchange of gold and ware, caress and thrust of sword, and death. A carcass in the asphodels, a festive bier. Beyond, barbarous shores, Herculean Gates and pathless waterways. And to the West, the Island of the Blessed. Fish, insect, fowl and beast. The race of men. This Cosmos: earth and moon, sun, planets, fixed stars, galaxies.

From being one, your self is broken in the prism of time. For twenty centuries of stony sleep you dreamt a dream.3 Often you stirred, and listlessly sank back, fed by unholy pomegranate and dark caress. But now your hour has come. Rise up, entrust yourself. To divine guidance of the holy creed, And follow Hermes of the golden wand. Arise, of the water of forgetfulness. Drink. Of the water of remembrance. Drink! The woman slowly opens her eyes and sits up. She picks up the jug and empties it to the left. She picks up the bowl and, turning her head to the right, she drinks of it. She looks around her as if trying to make out where she is. She tries to rise to her feet but fails, and sinks halfway back. Chorus: As yet you dream that you have wakened. Demons and vengeful shades lurk in the gloom. The low dream holds you in its grip.4 Resist it. The two epheboi lower their torches one after the other. It grows dark. Enter three daemoniac masked apparitions with dim glowing torches. They dance round Psyche while the chorus speaks.

Chorus: Pray to the gods, awake, lend them no force. Psyche stirs with an effort to awaken from the nightmare. She lifts an arm, passes it over her eyes; it sinks back. The demons fade. Enters Triptolemus with a lighted torch. He is played by the Hierophant of Eleusis and wears the purple Asiatic cloak with narrow sleeves. Silently he stands over the sleeper, and his being expresses calm, infinite compassion, stern, conscious love. This is the Good Shepherd. He touches her on the forehead but she cannot see him, except in her dream. He lowers his torch. Simultaneously the erynies appear in the background; a close knit group with masks and live snakes coiled round their heads and necks. They advance as one, taking short leaps and shaking their torches at the sleeping figure. She turns away as if in anguish and hides her head in her arm. While the Chorus speaks she turns as if giving them half a backward glance, but quickly hides her head again. Chorus: Do not look back or the erynies will get you And cast you back into the pit, and this is second death. There is no going back, only a going forward or a going under. The sacred precinct shields you from their wrath, Enter, remain therein; it is in you.

Psyche takes off her necklace, armbands and tunic. She remains in a short white peplum, symbol of the eidolon or vehicle, the body; or what is essential in contrast to what is inessential and acquired. The erynies fade. It is dark. A pause. When it grows light Psyche is not there. Enters Demeter, holding aloft her torch, clad in her seven dark veils. The part is played by the Hierophantess of Eleusis who moves with impressive dignity. She seeks her daughter. Chorus (this is a dirge): Kore, my child! I have scanned earth and sky Asia and Europe, the blind, cruel sea, The hidden mountain caves ever shrouded in mist The crowded cities of the East. In vain! Forgetting and forgotten, my Beloved, by gods and men You are yet present in a Mother's heart and I shall wait, and never rest from toil until My deathless eyes behold you once again. But who can show a way? Demeter sits down and veils herself. Enter Hecate from the other entrance. Growling and alert, three powerful dogs strain a chain she firmly holds. They are the fierce trained animals that guard the temple precinct which it is forbidden to enter without permission. In the Dromena they symbolize the three-headed dog of Hecate, which stands for right attention in the Eleusinian teaching.

By your dark thunderclouds I swear: I shall not rest from toil nor wear Immortal youth, nor dwell in my true home until I find and bring to you our child, the human soul. She turns and faces Hecate. With a gesture she beckons to her to lead the way. Hecate bows to her, the goddesses leave. Follows a interval of perfect starlit silence. The mustai become aware how still it has become; even the distant sea is sleeping, and this hour animal life is hushed. But now, from the hillside some distance away, comes the sound of flutes, a slow dirge which gathers momentum, then breaks off and starts again on a livelier note. This is no coincidence but part of the Dromena. Some hieraules, consecrated musicians, have been waiting in the hills for a light signal from the Telesterion, and. are now playing parts of an ancient Phrygian shepherd's song recorded by Orpheus and his followers. They symbolize the 'Satyrs' or thyrsos­bearers, the voice of the mysteries reaching the soul engrossed and lost in sense-based life, and we imagine them moving with lighted torches through the dense woods, espied from afar. Perhaps wakened by the sound, the cocks of Eleusis begin to crow on nearby and distant farms8 It grows imperceptibly lighter. Dew has begun to fall. Psyche has come in and, as if seeing the thyrsos bearers in the distance, above the heads of the spectators, has slowly raised her arms in a gesture of hope and humble greeting."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chorus: Psyche, Beloved of the gods, rejoice!

The following action closely corresponds to the one in the myth of Demeter. One epopt places the fleece on the seat. Another leads Psyche to it and beckons to her to sit down which she does, with her back to the audience. The third places the lighted torch in her hand. The first opens the cist and extracts the objects of the cult one by one. The figurantes stay in a row, as on a vase-painting or frieze and pass the objects from hand to hand. Triptolemus stands in front of Psyche. First, a veil is taken from the cist and placed over Psyche's head. Chorus: Initiation is death. Initiation is a marriage. Be seated on the fleece of the slain god. Receive the veil of ignorance; Mystae, veiled one I declare you. To know that you know nought is the new knowledge, Dwell in it fast and sealed, speak not.

At this moment the flutes accompanied by cymbals are heard again much nearer, perhaps within the enclosure of the Telesterion, and their tune is urgent and joyful. A sigh, a shiver of deep feeling and enthusiasm runs through the rows of mustai. When the tune has been played the instruments fade with the exception of a single flute. Crescendo it accompanies the following words. Chorus: Broken the troubled silence of a sleeping world Forget dark Erebos, blind Night, shed the low dream, And meet the dawn, the hope, new Birth of man. The flute stops. The sea, stirred by the morning winds that blow towards the shore, sounds in the distance, like the sea heard in a shell. It is dawn.

The Homeric hymn was preserved for a long time on mount Athos. An Orphic hymn tells of Demeter's arrival at Eleusis as the guest of Dysaules, the ill-housed, and his wife Baubo, the Anatolian goddess. Demeter taught their son Eubuleus, the swine herd, and Triptolemus. Other traditions speak of Musaion and Eumolpus, son and grandson, or else disciples of Orpheus. Eumolpus founded th e priestly dynasty of Eleusis. On accession the Hierophant laid down name and assumed the name of Musaion or Eumolpus alternatively. Orphic hymns are short and com­pressed, Homeric hymns are long and descriptive. The Homeric hymn falls into four sections: the Rape of Kore; the tale of failure over Demophoon; the Ins­titution of the Mysteries; the ascent of Persephone, and the Myth of the Chariot elaborated by Plato in the Phaidros.
